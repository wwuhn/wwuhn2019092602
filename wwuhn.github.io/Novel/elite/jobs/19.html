<p>When Jobs was losing  his footing at Apple in the summer of 1985, he went for a walk with Alan Kay,  who had been at Xerox PARC and was then an Apple Fellow. Kay knew that Jobs was  interested in the intersection of creativity and technology, so he suggested  they go see a friend of his, Ed Catmull, who was running the computer division  of George Lucas鈥檚 film studio. They rented a limo and rode up to Marin County  to the edge of Lucas鈥檚 Skywalker Ranch, where Catmull and his little computer  division were based. 鈥淚 was blown away, and I came back and tried to convince  Sculley to buy it for Apple,鈥?Jobs recalled. 鈥淏ut the folks running Apple  weren鈥檛 interested, and they were busy kicking me out anyway.鈥?/p>

<p>The Lucasfilm computer  division made hardware and software for rendering digital images, and it also  had a group of computer animators making shorts, which was led by a talented  cartoon-loving executive named John Lasseter. Lucas, who had completed his  first <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy, was embroiled in a contentious divorce, and he  needed to sell off the division. He told Catmull to find a buyer as soon as  possible.</p>

<p>After a few potential  purchasers balked in the fall of 1985, Catmull and his colleague Alvy Ray Smith  decided to seek investors so that they could buy the division themselves. So  they called Jobs, arranged another meeting, and drove down to his Woodside house.  After railing for a while about the perfidies and idiocies of Sculley, Jobs  proposed that he buy their Lucasfilm division outright. Catmull and Smith  demurred: They wanted an investor, not a new owner. But it soon became clear  that there was a middle ground: Jobs could buy a majority of the division and  serve as chairman but allow Catmull and Smith to run it.</p>

Every month or so they  would gather for a board meeting, usually at NeXT headquarters, where Jobs  would focus on the finances and strategy.

<p>Initially the revenue  was supposed to come from the hardware side. The Pixar Image Computer sold for  $125,000. The primary customers were animators and graphic designers, but the  machine also soon found specialized markets in the medical industry (CAT scan  data could be rendered in three-dimensional graphics) and intelligence fields  (for rendering information from reconnaissance flights and satellites). Because  of the sales to the National Security Agency, Jobs had to get a security  clearance, which must have been fun for the FBI agent assigned to vet him. At  one point, a Pixar executive recalled, Jobs was called by the investigator to  go over the drug use questions, which he answered unabashedly. 鈥淭he last time I  used that . . . ,鈥?he would say, or on occasion he would answer that no, he had  actually never tried that particular drug.</p>

<p>Jobs pushed Pixar to  build a lower-cost version of the computer that would sell for around $30,000.  He insisted that Hartmut Esslinger design it, despite protests by Catmull and  Smith about his fees. It ended up looking like the original Pixar Image  Computer, which was a cube with a round dimple in the middle, but it had  Esslinger鈥檚 signature thin grooves.</p>

<p>There was, however,  one company that was eager to automate the rendering of animators鈥?drawings  into color images for film. When Roy Disney led a board revolution at the  company that his uncle Walt had founded, the new CEO, Michael Eisner, asked  what role he wanted. Disney said that he would like to revive the company鈥檚  venerable but fading animation department. One of his first initiatives was to  look at ways to computerize the process, and Pixar won the contract. It created  a package of customized hardware and software known as CAPS, Computer Animation  Production System. It was first used in 1988 for the final scene of <em>The  Little Mermaid</em>, in which King Triton waves good-bye to Ariel. Disney bought  dozens of Pixar Image Computers as CAPS became an integral part of its  production.</p>

<p>The digital animation  business at Pixar鈥攖he group that made little animated films鈥攚as originally just  a sideline, its main purpose being to show off the hardware and software of the  company. It was run by John Lasseter, a man whose childlike face and demeanor  masked an artistic perfectionism that rivaled that of Jobs. Born in Hollywood,  Lasseter grew up loving Saturday morning cartoon shows. In ninth grade, he  wrote a report on the history of Disney Studios, and he decided then how he  wished to spend his life.</p>

<p>When he graduated from  high school, Lasseter enrolled in the animation program at the California  Institute of the Arts, founded by Walt Disney. In his summers and spare time,  he researched the Disney archives and worked as a guide on the Jungle Cruise  ride at Disneyland. The latter experience taught him the value of timing and  pacing in telling a story, an important but difficult concept to master when  creating, frame by frame, animated footage. He won the Student Academy Award  for the short he made in his junior year, <em>Lady and the Lamp</em>, which  showed his debt to Disney films and foreshadowed his signature talent for  infusing inanimate objects such as lamps with human personalities. After  graduation he took the job for which he was destined: as an animator at Disney  Studios.</p>

<p>After Jobs came onto  the scene, he and Lasseter began to share their passion for graphic design. 鈥淚  was the only guy at Pixar who was an artist, so I bonded with Steve over his  design sense,鈥?Lasseter said. He was a gregarious, playful, and huggable man  who wore flowery Hawaiian shirts, kept his office cluttered with vintage toys,  and loved cheeseburgers. Jobs was a prickly, whip-thin vegetarian who favored  austere and uncluttered surroundings. But they were actually well-suited for  each other. Lasseter was an artist, so Jobs treated him deferentially, and  Lasseter viewed Jobs, correctly, as a patron who could appreciate artistry and  knew how it could be interwoven with technology and commerce.</p>

<p>Jobs and Catmull  decided that, in order to show off their hardware and software, Lasseter should  produce another short animated film in 1986 for SIGGRAPH, the annual computer  graphics conference. At the time, Lasseter was using the Luxo lamp on his desk  as a model for graphic rendering, and he decided to turn Luxo into a lifelike  character. A friend鈥檚 young child inspired him to add Luxo Jr., and he showed a  few test frames to another animator, who urged him to make sure he told a  story. Lasseter said he was making only a short, but the animator reminded him  that a story can be told even in a few seconds. Lasseter took the lesson to  heart. <em>Luxo Jr.</em> ended up being just over two minutes; it told the tale of  a parent lamp and a child lamp pushing a ball back and forth until the ball  bursts, to the child鈥檚 dismay.</p>

It didn鈥檛 win, but Jobs became committed to making new animated shorts each  year, even though there was not much of a business rationale for doing so. As  times got tough at Pixar, he would sit through brutal budget-cutting meetings  showing no mercy. Then Lasseter would ask that the money they had just saved be  used for his next film, and Jobs would agree.</p>

<p>Grove also played  mentor when Jobs proposed that Pixar give Intel suggestions on how to improve  the capacity of its processors to render 3-D graphics. When the engineers at  Intel accepted the offer, Jobs sent an email back saying Pixar would need to be  paid for its advice. Intel鈥檚 chief engineer replied, 鈥淲e have not entered into  any financial arrangement in exchange for good ideas for our microprocessors in  the past and have no intention for the future.鈥?Jobs forwarded the answer to  Grove, saying that he found the engineer鈥檚 response to be 鈥渆xtremely arrogant,  given Intel鈥檚 dismal showing in understanding computer graphics.鈥?Grove sent  Jobs a blistering reply, saying that sharing ideas is 鈥渨hat friendly companies  and friends do for each other.鈥?Grove added that he had often freely shared  ideas with Jobs in the past and that Jobs should not be so mercenary. Jobs  relented. 鈥淚 have many faults, but one of them is not ingratitude,鈥?he  responded. 鈥淭herefore, I have changed my position 180 degrees鈥攚e will freely  help. Thanks for the clearer perspective.鈥?/p>

<p>Pixar was able to  create some powerful software products aimed at average consumers, or at least  those average consumers who shared Jobs鈥檚 passion for designing things. Jobs  still hoped that the ability to make super-realistic 3-D images at home would  become part of the desktop publishing craze. Pixar鈥檚 Showplace, for example,  allowed users to change the shadings on the 3-D objects they created so that  they could display them from various angles with appropriate shadows. Jobs  thought it was incredibly compelling, but most consumers were content to live  without it. It was a case where his passions misled him: The software had so  many amazing features that it lacked the simplicity Jobs usually demanded.  Pixar couldn鈥檛 compete with Adobe, which was making software that was less  sophisticated but far less complicated and expensive.</p>

<p>Even as Pixar鈥檚  hardware and software product lines foundered, Jobs kept protecting the  animation group. It had become for him a little island of magical artistry that  gave him deep emotional pleasure, and he was willing to nurture it and bet on  it. In the spring of 1988 cash was running so short that he convened a meeting  to decree deep spending cuts across the board. When it was over, Lasseter and  his animation group were almost too afraid to ask Jobs about authorizing some  extra money for another short. Finally, they broached the topic and Jobs sat  silent, looking skeptical. It would require close to $300,000 more out of his  pocket. After a few minutes, he asked if there were any storyboards. Catmull  took him down to the animation offices, and once Lasseter started his  show鈥攄isplaying his boards, doing the voices, showing his passion for his  product鈥擩obs started to warm up.</p>

Escaping under the couch, Tinny finds other frightened toys, but when the baby  hits his head and cries, Tinny goes back out to cheer him up.</p>

<p>The new team at  Disney鈥擬ichael Eisner the CEO and Jeffrey Katzenberg in the film division鈥攂egan  a quest to get Lasseter to come back. They liked <em>Tin Toy</em>, and they  thought that something more could be done with animated stories of toys that  come alive and have human emotions. But Lasseter, grateful for Jobs鈥檚 faith in  him, felt that Pixar was the only place where he could create a new world of  computer-generated animation. He told Catmull, 鈥淚 can go to Disney and be a  director, or I can stay here and make history.鈥?So Disney began talking about  making a production deal with Pixar. 鈥淟asseter鈥檚 shorts were really  breathtaking both in storytelling and in the use of technology,鈥?recalled Katzenberg.  鈥淚 tried so hard to get him to Disney, but he was loyal to Steve and Pixar. So  if you can鈥檛 beat them, join them. We decided to look for ways we could join up  with Pixar and have them make a film about toys for us.鈥?/p>

<p>By this point Jobs had  poured close to $50 million of his own money into Pixar鈥攎ore than half of what  he had pocketed when he cashed out of Apple鈥攁nd he was still losing money at  NeXT. He was hard-nosed about it; he forced all Pixar employees to give up  their options as part of his agreement to add another round of personal funding  in 1991. But he was also a romantic in his love for what artistry and  technology could do together. His belief that ordinary consumers would love to  do 3-D modeling on Pixar software turned out to be wrong, but that was soon  replaced by an instinct that turned out to be right: that combining great art  and digital technology would transform animated films more than anything had  since 1937, when Walt Disney had given life to Snow White.</p>
