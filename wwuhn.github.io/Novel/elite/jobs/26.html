<div class="left">  <h3><a name="s1"></a>Jony Ive</h3>
<p>When Jobs gathered his  top management for a pep talk just after he became iCEO in September 1997,  sitting in the audience was a sensitive and passionate thirty-year-old Brit who  was head of the company’s design team. Jonathan Ive, known to all as Jony, was  planning to quit. He was sick of the company’s focus on profit maximization rather  than product design. Jobs’s talk led him to reconsider. “I remember very  clearly Steve announcing that our goal is not just to make money but to make  great products,” Ive recalled. “The decisions you make based on that philosophy  are fundamentally different from the ones we had been making at Apple.” Ive and  Jobs would soon forge a bond that would lead to the greatest industrial design  collaboration of their era.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><h3>乔尼·艾弗</h3>

<p>1997年9月，乔布斯重返苹果公司出任iCEO，他将高管层召集在一起进行动员讲话。在听众席上有一位细腻又充满热情的英国人——乔纳森·艾弗（JonathanIve）,30岁，是苹果公司设计团队的主管。大家都叫他乔尼。他当时正打算辞职。他受够了公司一心想要把利润最大化而疏于产品设计的做法，而乔布斯的讲话动摇了他辞职的念头。“我记得非常清楚，史蒂夫宣布我们的目标不仅仅是赚钱，而是制造出伟大的产品，”艾弗回忆道，“基于这一理念所作出的决策会与从前有本质的不同。”艾弗和乔布斯很快就一拍即合，成为了他们那个时代最伟大的工业设计搭档。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Ive grew up in  Chingford, a town on the northeast edge of London. His father was a silversmith  who taught at the local college. “He’s a fantastic craftsman,” Ive recalled.  “His Christmas gift to me would be one day of his time in his college workshop,  during the Christmas break when no one else was there, helping me make whatever  I dreamed up.” The only condition was that Jony had to draw by hand what they  planned to make. “I always understood the beauty of things made by hand. I came  to realize that what was really important was the care that was put into it.  What I really despise is when I sense some carelessness in a product.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>艾弗在伦敦东北部的清福德镇长大。父亲是一名银匠，在当地的大学教授传统技艺。“他是一名极其出色的工匠，”艾弗回忆道，“他给我的圣诞礼物，就是带我到学校工作坊里度过一天。圣诞节假期时学校里没有人，他会帮我做我想要的东西。”但前提是，乔尼必须把想要做的东西亲手画出来。“我一直都很欣赏手工制品的美。我开始意识到对产品付出的心血至关重要。我最无法忍受的就是从产品中感觉出草率的态度。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Ive enrolled in  Newcastle Polytechnic and spent his spare time and summers working at a design  consultancy. One of his creations was a pen with a little ball on top that was  fun to fiddle with. It helped give the owner a playful emotional connection to  the pen. For his thesis he designed a microphone and earpiece—in purest white  plastic—to communicate with hearing-impaired kids. His flat was filled with  foam models he had made to help him perfect the design. He also designed an ATM  machine and a curved phone, both of which won awards from the Royal Society of  Arts. Unlike some designers, he didn’t just make beautiful sketches; he also  focused on how the engineering and inner components would work. He had an  epiphany in college when he was able to design on a Macintosh. “I discovered  the Mac and felt I had a connection with the people who were making this  product,” he recalled. “I suddenly understood what a company was, or was  supposed to be.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>艾弗进入了纽卡斯尔理工学院（NewcastlePolytechnic）学习，并利用业余时间和暑假在一家设计顾问公司工作。他曾经设计了一支钢笔，笔帽上有一个可以拨弄的小球，让使用者和钢笔建立有趣的“情感互动”。他的毕业设计是一套麦克风和听筒，由单一的白色塑料制成，用于和有听力缺陷的儿童交流。艾弗的公寓里摆满了发泡材料模型，这些模型帮助他获得了更完美的设计。此外，他还设计过一台自动取款机和一款流线型电话机，这两个作品都曾获得英国皇家艺术学院奖。和其他设计师不同，他不仅能勾画出精美的草图，还关注工程学以及内部元件的工作原理。大学时期，乔尼在使用麦金塔做设计时突然开窍了：“我开始了解Mac，并且觉得我和制造这个产品的那群人们在冥冥之中有种联系，”他回忆道，“我突然理解了公司是什么，或者说，‘应该是什么’。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>After graduation Ive  helped to build a design firm in London, Tangerine, which got a consulting  contract with Apple. In 1992 he moved to Cupertino to take a job in the Apple  design department. He became the head of the department in 1996, the year  before Jobs returned, but wasn’t happy. Amelio had little appreciation for  design. “There wasn’t that feeling of putting care into a product, because we  were trying to maximize the money we made,” Ive said. “All they wanted from us  designers was a model of what something was supposed to look like on the  outside, and then engineers would make it as cheap as possible. I was about to  quit.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>毕业之后，艾弗和人合伙在伦敦成立了一家名为蜜橘（Tangerine）的设计公司，并和苹果公司签订了咨询合同。1992年，乔尼移居到加州的库比蒂诺，开始在苹果公司的设计部门工作。1996年，这一年恰好是乔布斯回归前夕，乔尼成为设计部门的主管，却很不开心。阿梅里奥并不看重设计。“没有那种为产品付出心血的感觉，因为我们都在努力扩大利润，”艾弗说，“这些髙管只要求我们这些设计师设计产品的外观，然后工程师再把成本压到最低。我准备辞职了。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>When Jobs took over  and gave his pep talk, Ive decided to stick around. But Jobs at first looked  around for a world-class designer from the outside. He talked to Richard  Sapper, who designed the IBM ThinkPad, and Giorgetto Giugiaro, who designed the  Ferrari 250 and the Maserati Ghibli. But then he took a tour of Apple’s design  studio and bonded with the affable, eager, and very earnest Ive. “We discussed  approaches to forms and materials,” Ive recalled. “We were on the same  wavelength. I suddenly understood why I loved the company.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>直到乔布斯重新接管苹果之后讲了那一番话，艾弗才决定留下来。起初，乔布斯打算从外面招聘一个世界级的设计师。他找过IBMThinkPad笔记本的设计师理查德·萨珀，还有曾设计过法拉利250和玛莎拉蒂Ghibli—代跑车的乔吉·乔治亚罗（GiorgettoGiugiaro）。后来他去苹果的设计工作室走了一圈，决定跟和蔼热情、为人诚实的艾弗成为搭档。“我们讨论了产品在形式和材料方面的种种可能，”艾弗回忆道，“我们的看法一致。我突然明白了自己为什么会爱上这家公司。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Ive reported, at least  initially, to Jon Rubinstein, whom Jobs had brought in to head the hardware  division, but he developed a direct and unusually strong relationship with  Jobs. They began to have lunch together regularly, and Jobs would end his day  by dropping by Ive’s design studio for a chat. “Jony had a special status,”  said Laurene Powell. “He would come by our house, and our families became  close. Steve is never intentionally wounding to him. Most people in Steve’s  life are replaceable. But not Jony.”</p>
<p>Jobs described to me  his respect for Ive:</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p><p>最初，艾弗是向乔恩·鲁宾斯坦汇报的，鲁宾斯坦是乔布斯指派的硬件部门主管，但是艾弗后来和乔布斯发展成了一种直接的、异常牢固的伙伴关系。他们开始定期一起吃午餐，而乔布斯每天下班之前都要去艾弗的设计工作室聊一聊。“乔尼的身份很特殊，”乔布斯的妻子鲍威尔说，“他常来我们家玩，两家人之间的关系也变得更亲密。史蒂夫从来不会故意伤害他。在史蒂夫的生活中，大多数人都是能够被替代的，唯独乔尼不是。”</p>

<p>乔布斯随后向我表达了他对乔尼的尊敬：</p></div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The difference that  Jony has made, not only at Apple but in the world, is huge. He is a wickedly  intelligent person in all ways. He understands business concepts, marketing  concepts. He picks stuff up just like that, click. He understands what we do at  our core better than anyone. If I had a spiritual partner at Apple, it’s Jony.  Jony and I think up most of the products together and then pull others in and  say, “Hey, what do you think about this?” He gets the big picture as well as  the most infinitesimal details about each product. And he understands that  Apple is a product company. He’s not just a designer. That’s why he works  directly for me. He has more operational power than anyone else at Apple except  me. There’s no one who can tell him what to do, or to butt out. That’s the way  I set it up.</p>

  <p>Like most designers,  Ive enjoyed analyzing the philosophy and the step-by-step thinking that went  into a particular design. For Jobs, the process was more intuitive. He would  point to models and sketches he liked and dump on the ones he didn’t. Ive would  then take the cues and develop the concepts Jobs blessed.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p><p>乔尼给苹果公司乃至全世界带来的改变是巨大的。在各方面他都是一个极聪明的人。他懂得商业概念和营销概念，接受新事物的速度很快。他比其他任何人都更为理解苹果公司的核心理念。乔尼是我在公司里的“精神伴侣”。大多数产品都是我们一起构想出来的，然后我们会再把其他人拉进来，问他们“嘿，你们觉得怎么样？”对每一个产品，他既有宏观的见解，又能考虑到细枝末节。他明白，苹果是一家注重产品的公司。他不仅仅是一个设计师。这也就是为什么他向我直接汇报工作。他是整个公司里除我之外最有运营权力的人。任何人都无权干涉他做什么或不做什么。这也是我的意图。</p>
<p>和大多数设计师一样，艾弗喜欢分析某个特定设计背后的理念以及如何一步步地构思出这个设计。对于乔布斯来说，他的判断更注重直觉。他会明确指出自己喜欢的模型和草图，放弃那些不喜欢的。而艾弗接下来会按照乔布斯的思路和喜好，进一步完善设计理念。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Ive was a fan of the  German industrial designer Dieter Rams, who worked for the electronics firm  Braun. Rams preached the gospel of “Less but better,” <em>Weniger aber besser</em>,  and likewise Jobs and Ive wrestled with each new design to see how much they  could simplify it. Ever since Apple’s first brochure proclaimed “Simplicity is  the ultimate sophistication,” Jobs had aimed for the simplicity that comes from  conquering complexities, not ignoring them. “It takes a lot of hard work,” he  said, “to make something simple, to truly understand the underlying challenges  and come up with elegant solutions.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>艾弗的偶像是为博朗（Braun）电器公司工作的德国工业设计大师迪特尔·拉姆斯。拉姆斯崇尚的设计理念是“少而优”（Wenigeraberbesser）。同样，乔布斯和艾弗也在为如何能让每一个新设计变得简洁而绞尽脑汁。自从在第一本苹果手册里宣称“至繁归于至简”以来，乔布斯就以追求简洁为目标。追求简洁不是要忽视复杂性，而是要化繁为简。“要把一件东西变得简单，还要真正地认识到潜在的挑战，并找出漂亮的解决方案。”他说，“这需要付出很多努力。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>In Ive, Jobs met his  soul mate in the quest for true rather than surface simplicity. Sitting in his  design studio, Ive described his philosophy:</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>在艾弗这里，乔布斯终于找到了“灵魂伴侣”。他要的是真正意义上的简洁，而不是表面功夫。有一次，艾弗坐在他的设计工作室里，表达了他对简洁的看法：</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Why do we assume that  simple is good? Because with physical products, we have to feel we can dominate  them. As you bring order to complexity, you find a way to make the product  defer to you. Simplicity isn’t just a visual style. It’s not just minimalism or  the absence of clutter. It involves digging through the depth of the  complexity. To be truly simple, you have to go really deep. For example, to  have no screws on something, you can end up having a product that is so  convoluted and so complex. The better way is to go deeper with the simplicity,  to understand everything about it and how it’s manufactured. You have to deeply  understand the essence of a product in order to be able to get rid of the parts  that are not essential.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>为什么我们认为简单就是好？因为对于一个有形的产品来说，我们喜欢那种控制它们的感觉。如果在复杂中有规律可循，你也可以让产品听从于你。简洁并不仅仅是视觉上的，也不仅仅是把杂乱无章的东西变少或抹掉，而是要挖掘复杂性的深度。要想获得简洁，你就必须要挖得足够深。打个比方，如果你是为了在产品上不装螺丝钉，那你最后可能会造出一个极其烦琐复杂的东西。更好的方式，是更深刻地理解“简洁”一词，理解它的每一个部分，以及它是如何制造的。你必须深刻地把握产品的精髓，从而判断出哪些不重要的部件是可以拿掉的。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

  <p>That was the  fundamental principle Jobs and Ive shared. Design was not just about what a  product looked like on the surface. It had to reflect the product’s essence.  “In most people’s vocabularies, design means veneer,” Jobs told <em>Fortune</em> shortly after retaking the reins at Apple. “But to me, nothing could be further  from the meaning of design. Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made  creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>这就是乔布斯和艾弗所一致认同的基本原则。设计不仅是关于产品的外观，而且必须要反映出产品的精髓。“在大多数人看来，设计就和镶嵌工艺差不多，”乔布斯在重新接管苹果后对《财富》杂志说，“但是对于我而言，‘设计’一词绝无任何引申含义。设计是一个人工作品的核心灵魂，并最终由外壳表达出来。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>As a result, the  process of designing a product at Apple was integrally related to how it would  be engineered and manufactured. Ive described one of Apple’s Power Macs. “We  wanted to get rid of anything other than what was absolutely essential,” he  said. “To do so required total collaboration between the designers, the product  developers, the engineers, and the manufacturing team. We kept going back to  the beginning, again and again. Do we need that part? Can we get it to perform  the function of the other four parts?”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>这样一来，苹果公司的产品设计过程就和工程及制造结合到了一起。艾弗这样描述苹果PowerMac系列：“只要不是绝对必需的部件，我们都会想办法去掉，”他说，“为达成这一目标，就需要设计师、产品开发人员、工程师以及制作团队的通力合作。我们一次次地返回到最初，不断问自己：‘我们需要那个部分吗？我们能用它实现其他4部分的功能吗？’”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The connection between  the design of a product, its essence, and its manufacturing was illustrated for  Jobs and Ive when they were traveling in France and went into a kitchen supply  store. Ive picked up a knife he admired, but then put it down in  disappointment. Jobs did the same. “We both noticed a tiny bit of glue between  the handle and the blade,” Ive recalled. They talked about how the knife’s good  design had been ruined by the way it was manufactured. “We don’t like to think  of our knives as being glued together,” Ive said. “Steve and I care about  things like that, which ruin the purity and detract from the essence of  something like a utensil, and we think alike about how products should be made  to look pure and seamless.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯和艾弗在法国的一家厨具店闲逛时，悟出了产品设计、产品本质和产品制造这三者之间的联系。艾弗看中了一把刀，把它拿起来，但很快就失望地放下了。乔布斯也是同样。“我们都发现了刀把和刀片之间有一丝胶粘的痕迹。”艾弗回忆道。他们后来讨论了好的设计是怎么被制造给毁了的。“我们都不愿去想，自家的刀是被粘接起来的，”艾弗说，“史蒂夫和我都很看重这种问题，这种设计会破坏作为一件厨具应有的纯粹和本质，我们的想法很一致，就是如何让我们的产品看起来纯粹且浑然天成。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>At most other  companies, engineering tends to drive design. The engineers set forth their  specifications and requirements, and the designers then come up with cases and  shells that will accommodate them. For Jobs, the process tended to work the  other way. In the early days of Apple, Jobs had approved the design of the case  of the original Macintosh, and the engineers had to make their boards and  components fit.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>对于大多数公司来说，设计是被工程技术引领的。工程师们制定产品的规格和要求，然后设计师们再据此设计模型和外壳。但对于乔布斯来说，这个过程截然不同。在苹果公司创立之初，乔布斯首先确定了Mac电脑的外壳之后，工程师们才依此制造合适的主板和元件。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>After he was forced  out, the process at Apple reverted to being engineer-driven. “Before Steve came  back, engineers would say ‘Here are the guts’—processor, hard drive—and then it  would go to the designers to put it in a box,” said Apple’s marketing chief  Phil Schiller. “When you do it that way, you come up with awful products.” But  when Jobs returned and forged his bond with Ive, the balance was again tilted  toward the designers. “Steve kept impressing on us that the design was integral  to what would make us great,” said Schiller. “Design once again dictated the  engineering, not just vice versa.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>在乔布斯被迫退出之后，这一过程又变成了以工程师为主导。“在史蒂夫回来之前，工程师会指着处理器硬盘说‘这些是内部元件’，然后设计师们会想办法把这些部件装进外壳，”苹果公司的营销副总裁菲尔·席勒（PhilSchiller）说，“按这种方式来做，你只会得到糟糕的产品。”但是当乔布斯回来与艾弗成为搭档之后，天平又向设计师这一端倾斜了。“史蒂夫一直在影响着我们，设计是我们的成功之道席勒说，“设计师再次主导工程师了，而不是‘反之’。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>On occasion this could  backfire, such as when Jobs and Ive insisted on using a solid piece of brushed  aluminum for the edge of the iPhone 4 even when the engineers worried that it  would compromise the antenna. But usually the distinctiveness of its  designs—for the iMac, the iPod, the iPhone, and the iPad—would set Apple apart  and lead to its triumphs in the years after Jobs returned.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>双方偶尔也会出现争执。比如，乔布斯和艾弗坚持在iPhone4的边缘使用拉丝铝材料，而工程师担心这会造成天线信号不佳（详见第三十八章）。但在通常情况下，苹果产品——包括iMac、iPod、iPhone和iPad——的独特设计让苹果与众不同，并在乔布斯回归后的几年里走上了巅峰。</p></div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><h3><a name="s2"></a>Inside the Studio</h3>
<p>The design studio  where Jony Ive reigns, on the ground floor of Two Infinite Loop on the Apple  campus, is shielded by tinted windows and a heavy clad, locked door. Just  inside is a glass-booth reception desk where two assistants guard access. Even  high-level Apple employees are not allowed in without special permission. Most  of my interviews with Jony Ive for this book were held elsewhere, but one day  in 2010 he arranged for me to spend an afternoon touring the studio and talking  about how he and Jobs collaborate there.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p><p>工作室探奇</p>

<p>乔尼·艾弗所在的设计工作室位于苹果公司园区无限循环路2号楼的一层，隐在染色玻璃窗和厚重的钢制大门之后。走进去，会看到一张玻璃接待台和两名接待员。甚至公司的大多数员工都不被允许人内。我为完成本书与乔尼所作的大部分采访都是在别处进行的，不过在2010年的一个下午，他邀请我去他的工作室参观，并谈到了他和乔布斯是如何在这里合作的。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>To the left of the entrance  is a bullpen of desks with young designers; to the right is the cavernous main  room with six long steel tables for displaying and playing with works in  progress. Beyond the main room is a computer-aided design studio, filled with  workstations, that leads to a room with molding machines to turn what’s on the  screens into foam models. Beyond that is a robot-controlled spray-painting  chamber to make the models look real. The look is sparse and industrial, with  metallic gray décor. Leaves from the trees outside cast moving patterns of  light and shadows on the tinted windows. Techno and jazz play in the  background.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>大门入口的左边是一组年轻设计师的工位；右边是一个类似洞穴的大房间，里面有6张长条钢桌，用来展示和试验设计中的产品。大房间的旁边是一间由计算机辅助的设计工作室，里面全都是工作站。再往里走的一个房间有几台铸型机，可以把电脑屏幕上的设计制成发泡材料模型，另外还有一台机器人控制的喷漆机器，可以让模型看起来更逼真。银色的金属装溃让整个房间看上去空旷又富有工业气息。外面的树叶透过染色玻璃窗投下移动的光影，电子乐和爵士乐回荡在空气中。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Almost every day when  Jobs was healthy and in the office, he would have lunch with Ive and then  wander by the studio in the afternoon. As he entered, he could survey the  tables and see the products in the pipeline, sense how they fit into Apple’s  strategy, and inspect with his fingertips the evolving design of each. Usually  it was just the two of them alone, while the other designers glanced up from  their work but kept a respectful distance. If Jobs had a specific issue, he  might call over the head of mechanical design or another of Ive’s deputies. If  something excited him or sparked some thoughts about corporate strategy, he  might ask the chief operating officer Tim Cook or the marketing head Phil  Schiller to come over and join them. Ive described the usual process:</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>当乔布斯身体状况尚佳而且不外出时，几乎每天，他都会和艾弗一起吃午餐，然后去工作室看一看。他一进门，就会查看几张桌子上那些正在设计的产品，看看它们是否符合苹果公司的发展战略，并亲手检查每一个产品的演进设计。通常都是他们两人单独相处，其他设计师见到了也会和他们保持礼貌的距离。如果乔布斯要处理具体的事情，他就会把负责机械设计的主管或者艾弗的助手叫过来。如果某些想法让他感到兴奋，擦出了有关企业战略的思想火花，他就会让首席运营官蒂姆·库克或者营销副总裁菲尔·席勒加入他们的讨论。按照艾弗的描述，这就是他们的工作常态：</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>This great room is the one place  in the company where you can look around and see everything we have in the  works. When Steve comes in, he will sit at one of these tables. If we’re  working on a new iPhone, for example, he might grab a stool and start playing  with different models and feeling them in his hands, remarking on which ones he  likes best. Then he will graze by the other tables, just him and me, to see  where all the other products are heading. He can get a sense of the sweep of  the whole company, the iPhone and iPad, the iMac and laptop and everything  we’re considering. That helps him see where the company is spending its energy  and how things connect. And he can ask, “Does doing this make sense, because  over here is where we are growing a lot?” or questions like that. He gets to  see things in relationship to each other, which is pretty hard to do in a big  company. Looking at the models on these tables, he can see the future for the  next three years.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>在这间体大的屋子里，你可以看到所有我们正在研发的产品。史蒂夫一进来，就会坐在其中一张桌子前。举例来说，假如我们正在设计一款新的iPhone,他就会搬个凳子坐在那儿，把玩桌上不同的模型，用手去感受它们，评价哪一个才是他最喜欢的。然后，我们再一起去看其他桌子上的产品，看看那些产品设计的情况。他能够把握公司的全局，包括iPhone、iPad、iMac和笔记本电脑，以及其他我们正在考虑的产品。这可以令他看清公司的主要任务是什么，以及各种事物之间的联系。他会问：“有意义吗？它是否会让我们快速成长？”或者类似的问题。他能够看出事物之间的联系，这对于一个大公司的管理者来说绝非易事。单凭桌上的模型，他就能看出公司在未来3年的发展。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Much of the design  process is a conversation, a back-and-forth as we walk around the tables and  play with the models. He doesn’t like to read complex drawings. He wants to see  and feel a model. He’s right. I get surprised when we make a model and then  realize it’s rubbish, even though based on the CAD [computer-aided design]  renderings it looked great.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>在我们的设计过程中，对话占据了很大一部分。当我们在桌旁把玩模型的时候，有些对话是反复进行的。他不喜欢看复杂的固纸。他需要亲眼见到并感受这些模型。他是对的。当我发现我们做出的模型只是一堆垃圾时，我惊讶极了，虽然它们从计算机辅助设计的角度来讲是没有问题的。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>He loves coming in  here because it’s calm and gentle. It’s a paradise if you’re a visual person.  There are no formal design reviews, so there are no huge decision points.  Instead, we can make the decisions fluid. Since we iterate every day and never  have dumb-ass presentations, we don’t run into major disagreements.</p>
  <p>On this day Ive was  overseeing the creation of a new European power plug and connector for the  Macintosh. Dozens of foam models, each with the tiniest variation, have been  cast and painted for inspection. Some would find it odd that the head of design  would fret over something like this, but Jobs got involved as well. Ever since  he had a special power supply made for the Apple II, Jobs has cared about not  only the engineering but also the design of such parts. His name is listed on  the patent for the white power brick used by the MacBook as well as its  magnetic connector with its satisfying click. In fact he is listed as one of  the inventors for 212 different Apple patents in the United States as of the  beginning of 2011.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p><p>他喜欢来这里，因为这里安静而温馨。如果你是一个注重视觉感受的人，你一定会觉得这里是天堂。这里没有死板的设计评价，所以也没有气氛严肃的表决。我们会顺利地作出决定。正因为我们每天都保持沟通，而且从来也没有死气沉沉的汇报，所以我们也没有大的分歧。</p>
<p>我前去拜访的那天，艾弗正在监督两款模型的制作，其中一个是为欧洲市场设计的新插头，另一个是为Mac电脑设计的连接线。几十个彼此之间只有细微差异的泡沫模型在喷漆之后被展示出来，等待检查。有些人会觉得奇怪，设计主管竟然会为这种工作操心烦恼，而乔布斯也会如此。自从有了为苹果二代特制的电源，乔布斯就不仅仅关注工程部分，还关注此类部件的设计。他被列为MacBook配套的白色变压器及磁性连接器的专利人。事实上，截至2011年初，乔布斯已成为美国212项专利的发明人之一。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Ive and Jobs have even  obsessed over, and patented, the packaging for various Apple products. U.S.  patent D558572, for example, granted on January 1, 2008, is for the iPod Nano  box, with four drawings showing how the device is nestled in a cradle when the  box is opened. Patent D596485, issued on July 21, 2009, is for the iPhone  packaging, with its sturdy lid and little glossy plastic tray inside.</p>

<div class="right"><p>艾弗和乔布斯对苹果产品的包装也相当痴迷，并申请了多项专利。比如，2008年1月1日，美国将D558572号专利授予了iPodnano包装盒。一打开盒子，就会看到4张图片说明iPod是如何被放置进像摇篮一样的盒子里的。2009年7月21日，D596485号专利授予了iPhone的包装盒——配有坚硬的上盖以及内部光滑的塑料小托盘。</p></div></div>

<p>Early on, Mike  Markkula had taught Jobs to “impute”—to understand that people <em>do</em> judge  a book by its cover—and therefore to make sure all the trappings and packaging  of Apple signaled that there was a beautiful gem inside. Whether it’s an iPod  Mini or a MacBook Pro, Apple customers know the feeling of opening up the  well-crafted box and finding the product nestled in an inviting fashion. “Steve  and I spend a lot of time on the packaging,” said Ive. “I love the process of  unpacking something. You design a ritual of unpacking to make the product feel  special. Packaging can be theater, it can create a story.”</p>

<div class="right"><p>早些时候，迈克·马克库拉就教过乔布斯“灌输”这一招。要知道，人们会根据封面来评判一本书的好坏——同理，苹果产品漂亮的外部装饰和包装也能说明里面是个好产品。无论是迷你iPod还是MacBookPro，苹果用户都很享受这种感觉：打开精致的盒子，产品总是以迷人的方式躺在里面。“史蒂夫和我在包装上花了很多时间，”艾弗说，“我很享受打开包装的过程。一旦拆包被设计成一种仪式般的程序，产品也就变得特殊起来。包装就像一座剧场，它能够制造故事。”</p></div></div>

<p>Ive, who has the  sensitive temperament of an artist, at times got upset with Jobs for taking too  much credit, a habit that has bothered other colleagues over the years. His  personal feelings for Jobs were so intense that at times he got easily bruised.  “He will go through a process of looking at my ideas and say, ‘That’s no good.  That’s not very good. I like that one,’” Ive said. “And later I will be sitting  in the audience and he will be talking about it as if it was his idea. I pay  maniacal attention to where an idea comes from, and I even keep notebooks  filled with my ideas. So it hurts when he takes credit for one of my designs.”  Ive also has bristled when outsiders portrayed Jobs as the only ideas guy at  Apple. “That makes us vulnerable as a company,” Ive said earnestly, his voice  soft. But then he paused to recognize the role Jobs in fact played. “In so many  other companies, ideas and great design get lost in the process,” he said. “The  ideas that come from me and my team would have been completely irrelevant,  nowhere, if Steve hadn’t been here to push us, work with us, and drive through  all the resistance to turn our ideas into products.”</p>

艾弗也有着艺术家的敏感，有时也会因为乔布斯抢了他太多风头而懊恼。多年来，乔布斯的这个习惯也让其他同事感到很不舒服。艾弗对乔布斯的个人情感有时过于强烈，所以很容易受伤。“他在得知我的一些想法之后说，‘不好，这个想法不怎么妤，我更喜欢另一个。’”艾弗说，“然后我坐在听众席上听他阐述刚才的想法，说得就像他自己想出来的一样。我格外注重一个点子的出处，甚至会用笔记本记下它们。所以，当他把设计的功劳归于自己的时候，我觉得很受伤害。”当外面的人把乔布斯奉为苹果公司的创意之源时，艾弗也会很生气。“这让公司显得很脆弱。”艾弗诚恳地说，不过语气变得缓和多了。随后，他话锋一转，肯定了乔布斯在公司里的真正角色。“在其他很多公司里，创意和杰出的设计常常会淹没在流程中，”他说，“如果不是史蒂夫在这里催促着我们，和我们一起工作，并且排除万难把我们的想法变成产品，我和我的团队想出来的点子肯定早就灰飞烟灭了。”
