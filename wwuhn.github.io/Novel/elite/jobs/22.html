<div class="left">  <h3><a name="s1"></a>Jeffrey Katzenberg</h3>
<p>“It’s kind of fun to  do the impossible,” Walt Disney once said. That was the type of attitude that  appealed to Jobs. He admired Disney’s obsession with detail and design, and he  felt that there was a natural fit between Pixar and the movie studio that  Disney had founded.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><h3>杰弗里·卡曾伯格</h3>

<p>“挑战不可能完成的任务，其乐无穷。”沃尔特·迪士尼曾经这样说。这种处事态度很合乔布斯的口味。他赞赏迪士尼对细节和设计的执著，感觉皮克斯跟迪士尼创建的电影制片厂是天生的一对。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The Walt Disney  Company had licensed Pixar’s Computer Animation Production System, and that  made it the largest customer for Pixar’s computers. One day Jeffrey Katzenberg,  the head of Disney’s film division, invited Jobs down to the Burbank studios to  see the technology in operation. As the Disney folks were showing him around,  Jobs turned to Katzenberg and asked, “Is Disney happy with Pixar?” With great  exuberance, Katzenberg answered yes. Then Jobs asked, “Do you think we at Pixar  are happy with Disney?” Katzenberg said he assumed so. “No, we’re not,” Jobs  said. “We want to do a film with you. That would make us happy.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>沃尔特·迪士尼公司已经获得了皮克斯计算机动画制作系统的使用授杈，并由此成为皮克斯公司计算机的最大用户。有一天，迪士尼电影部的负责人杰夫·卡曾伯格邀请乔布斯到伯班克的工作室观看制作技术。当迪士尼的一行人陪同参观时，乔布斯突然转身问卡曾伯格，“迪士尼对皮克斯满意吗？”卡曾伯格兴髙采烈地说满意。接着乔布斯又问，“那你认为我们皮克斯对迪士尼满意吗？”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Katzenberg was  willing. He admired John Lasseter’s animated shorts and had tried  unsuccessfully to lure him back to Disney. So Katzenberg invited the Pixar team  down to discuss partnering on a film. When Catmull, Jobs, and Lasseter got  settled at the conference table, Katzenberg was forthright. “John, since you  won’t come work for me,” he said, looking at Lasseter, “I’m going to make it  work this way.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>卡曾伯格说他觉得应该满意吧。“错，我们不满意。”乔布斯说，“我们想跟你们合作一部电影，那样我们才会满意。”卡曾伯格很愿意。他很欣赏约翰·拉塞特制作的动画短片，也曾经想诱惑他回迪士尼，但没有成功。于是，卡曾伯格邀请皮克斯团队来讨论合拍电影。卡特穆尔、乔布斯和拉塞特在会议室一落座，卡曾伯格就看着拉塞特，开门见山地说：“约翰·，既然你不愿意来为我工作，我们就用这样的方式来合作吧。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Just as the Disney  company shared some traits with Pixar, so Katzenberg shared some with Jobs.  Both were charming when they wanted to be, and aggressive (or worse) when it  suited their moods or interests. Alvy Ray Smith, on the verge of quitting  Pixar, was at the meeting. “Katzenberg and Jobs impressed me as a lot alike,”  he recalled. “Tyrants with an amazing gift of gab.” Katzenberg was delightfully  aware of this. “Everybody thinks I’m a tyrant,” he told the Pixar team. “I <em>am</em> a tyrant. But I’m usually right.” One can imagine Jobs saying the same.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>不仅迪士尼公司跟皮克斯彼此之间有一些共同点，卡曾伯格跟乔布斯也是如此。两人都善于施展魅力，当兴之所至或情绪高涨时也都富有攻击性（甚至更糟）。即将离开皮克斯的阿尔维·雷·史密斯当时也参加了这次会议。“卡曾伯格跟乔布斯的相像给我留下了深刻印象，”他回忆说，“都是具有惊人口才的暴君。”卡曾伯格对此自鸣得意。“所有人都认为我是个暴君，”他告诉皮克斯团队，“我也确实是个暴君。但我通常是正确的。”可以想象，乔布斯也会这么说。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>As befitted two men of  equal passion, the negotiations between Katzenberg and Jobs took months.  Katzenberg insisted that Disney be given the rights to Pixar’s proprietary  technology for making 3-D animation. Jobs refused, and he ended up winning that  engagement. Jobs had his own demand: Pixar would have part ownership of the  film and its characters, sharing control of both video rights and sequels. “If  that’s what you want,” Katzenberg said, “we can just quit talking and you can  leave now.” Jobs stayed, conceding that point.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>同样富有激情的卡曾伯格和乔布斯，两人之间光是谈判就用了好几个月。卡曾伯格坚持要皮克斯授杈迪士尼使用其专利技术制作3D动画。乔布斯说不行，最终他胜利了。乔布斯也有他自己的要求：皮克斯要对制作的电影及其角色拥有部分所有杈，并共同控制影片版权和续集。“如果那是你想要的，”卡曾伯格说，“我们就不用谈了，你现在就可以走。”乔布斯没走，在这个问题上作出了让步。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Lasseter was riveted  as he watched the two wiry and tightly wound principals parry and thrust. “Just  to see Steve and Jeffrey go at it, I was in awe,” he recalled. “It was like a  fencing match. They were both masters.” But Katzenberg went into the match with  a saber, Jobs with a mere foil. Pixar was on the verge of bankruptcy and needed  a deal with Disney far more than Disney needed a deal with Pixar. Plus, Disney  could afford to finance the whole enterprise, and Pixar couldn’t. The result  was a deal, struck in May 1991, by which Disney would own the picture and its  characters outright, have creative control, and pay Pixar about 12.5% of the  ticket revenues. It had the option (but not the obligation) to do Pixar’s next  two films and the right to make (with or without Pixar) sequels using the  characters in the film. Disney could also kill the film at any time with only a  small penalty.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>两位同样痩削的公司首脑剑拔弩张、针锋相对，这给拉塞特留下了极为深刻的印象。“单单看着史蒂夫和杰弗里那个架势，我就佩服得五体投地，”他回忆说，“那就像一场击剑比赛，他们都是高手。”但在当时，卡曾伯格拿的是重剑，而乔布斯拿的只是把花剑。当时皮克斯濒临破产，远远比迪士尼更需要这次合作。另外，迪士尼资金雄厚，可以负担整个项目，而皮克斯不能。1991年5月达成的协议是，迪士尼将完全拥有影片及其角色的版杈，给皮克斯大约12.5%的票房分成，迪士尼控制创作杈，可以在任何时候以很少的违约金为代价停掉这部影片，有杈利（而无义务）制作皮克斯接下来的两部电影，也有权（不一定跟皮克斯一起）用该影片的角色制作续集。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The idea that John  Lasseter pitched was called “Toy Story.” It sprang from a belief, which he and  Jobs shared, that products have an essence to them, a purpose for which they  were made. If the object were to have feelings, these would be based on its  desire to fulfill its essence. The purpose of a glass, for example, is to hold  water; if it had feelings, it would be happy when full and sad when empty. The  essence of a computer screen is to interface with a human. The essence of a  unicycle is to be ridden in a circus. As for toys, their purpose is to be  played with by kids, and thus their existential fear is of being discarded or  upstaged by newer toys. So a buddy movie pairing an old favorite toy with a  shiny new one would have an essential drama to it, especially when the action  revolved around the toys’ being separated from their kid. The original treatment  began, “Everyone has had the traumatic childhood experience of losing a toy.  Our story takes the toy’s point of view as he loses and tries to regain the  single thing most important to him: to be played with by children. This is the  reason for the existence of all toys. It is the emotional foundation of their  existence.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>约翰·拉塞特的创意称为“玩具总动员”（ToyStory），灵感来自他和乔布斯共有的一个信念：产品是有灵魂的，是为了一个使命才被生产出来的。如果一个物体是有情感的，它的情感应该是基于它想实现自己价值的渴望。例如，杯子的使命是盛水；如果它有情感，它会在满的时候高兴，空的时候悲哀。计算机屏幕的使命是跟人互动。独轮车的使命是在马戏团被人骑行。而玩具，它们的使命就是供孩子们玩耍，因此它们的恐惧就是被抛弃或被新的玩具取代。所以，一个最受喜爱的旧玩具和一个闪闪发亮的新玩具搭档出演的兄弟电影，是极富戏剧效果的，尤其是所有活动都围绕着一些跟主人分开的玩具所展开。如原脚本开篇时所说：“每个人都有在童年时失去玩具的痛苦经历。我们的故事从玩具的视角展开，他一度失去并努力重新得到对他来说最重要的事情：跟孩子们玩。这是所有玩具存在的原因。这是他们存在的情感基础。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The two main  characters went through many iterations before they ended up as Buzz Lightyear  and Woody. Every couple of weeks, Lasseter and his team would put together  their latest set of storyboards or footage to show the folks at Disney. In  early screen tests, Pixar showed off its amazing technology by, for example,  producing a scene of Woody rustling around on top of a dresser while the light  rippling in through a Venetian blind cast shadows on his plaid shirt—an effect  that would have been almost impossible to render by hand. Impressing Disney  with the plot, however, was more difficult. At each presentation by Pixar,  Katzenberg would tear much of it up, barking out his detailed comments and  notes. And a cadre of clipboard-carrying flunkies was on hand to make sure  every suggestion and whim uttered by Katzenberg received follow-up treatment.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>经过反复讨论，两个主角的名字最终定为“巴斯光年”（BuzzLightyear）和“胡迪”（Woody）。每隔两周，拉塞特和他的团队就会把最新的脚本或片段给迪士尼的合作伙伴看。在早期试镜时，皮克斯制作的动画显示了惊人的技术水平，例如有一幕，胡迪在一个梳妆台上，光透过百叶窗洒进来，影子投在他的格子衬衫上——这个效果几乎是不可能通过手工渲染来实现的。但是，要让迪士尼对情节方面满意，就难上加难了。每次皮克斯作演示，卡曾伯格都会推翻大部分情节，大声道出他的具体评论和意见。旁边总有一群手捧记事本的随从，确保卡曾伯格说的每个建议和奇思怪想都能得到后续落实。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Katzenberg’s big push  was to add more edginess to the two main characters. It may be an animated  movie called <em>Toy Story</em>, he said, but it should not be aimed only at  children. “At first there was no drama, no real story, and no conflict,”  Katzenberg recalled. He suggested that Lasseter watch some classic buddy  movies, such as <em>The Defiant Ones</em> and <em>48 Hours</em>, in which two  characters with different attitudes are thrown together and have to bond. In  addition, he kept pushing for what he called “edge,” and that meant making  Woody’s character more jealous, mean, and belligerent toward Buzz, the new  interloper in the toy box. “It’s a toy-eat-toy world,” Woody says at one point,  after pushing Buzz out of a window.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>卡曾伯格着力推动的一点，是要让两个主角的个性更尖锐。他说，虽然这是部叫“玩具总动员”的动画电影，但是它不应该只以儿童为目标观众。“一开始它没有情节，没有真正的故事，没有矛盾冲突，”卡曾伯格回忆说，“故事没有真正的驱动力。”他建议拉塞特看一些经典的兄弟电影，例如《逃狱惊魂》（TheDefiantOnes）或《48小时》（48Hours）,其中都有两个迥然不同的角色不得不同舟共济的故事。另外，他一直强调他所说的“尖锐”，这意味着胡迪这个角色要更有嫉妒心、更尖刻，挑衅巴斯这个游戏箱里新来的入侵者。“这是个玩具吃玩具的世界。”一处情节中，胡迪把巴斯推出窗外后说。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>After many rounds of  notes from Katzenberg and other Disney execs, Woody had been stripped of almost  all charm. In one scene he throws the other toys off the bed and orders Slinky  to come help. When Slinky hesitates, Woody barks, “Who said your job was to  think, spring-wiener?” Slinky then asks a question that the Pixar team members  would soon be asking themselves: “Why is the cowboy so scary?” As Tom Hanks,  who had signed up to be Woody’s voice, exclaimed at one point, “This guy’s a  real jerk!”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>经过卡曾伯格和其他迪士尼负责人的多轮修改，胡迪几乎被去掉了所有的魅力。有一幕，他把其他玩具扔下床，还命令弹簧狗（Slinky）来帮忙。正当弹簧狗犹豫不决的时候，胡迪吼道：“谁说你的工作是思考了，弹簧香肠？”然后弹簧狗问了一个不久以后皮克斯团队总会自问的问题：“这牛仔为什么这么可怕！”正如给胡迪配音的汤姆·汉克斯有一次感叹的，“这家伙实在太讨厌了！”</p></div></div>

 

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><h3><a name="s2"></a>Cut!</h3>
<p>Lasseter and his Pixar  team had the first half of the movie ready to screen by November 1993, so they  brought it down to Burbank to show to Katzenberg and other Disney executives.  Peter Schneider, the head of feature animation, had never been enamored of  Katzenberg’s idea of having outsiders make animation for Disney, and he  declared it a mess and ordered that production be stopped. Katzenberg agreed.  “Why is this so terrible?” he asked a colleague, Tom Schumacher. “Because it’s  not their movie anymore,” Schumacher bluntly replied. He later explained, “They  were following Katzenberg’s notes, and the project had been driven completely  off-track.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><h3>停！</h3>
<p>1993年11月，拉塞特和他的皮克斯团队做好了电影的前半部分，到伯班克给卡曾伯格和其他迪士尼管理层看。动画长片部门的总监彼得·施奈德（PeterSchneider）从未喜欢过卡曾伯格让外人为迪士尼做动画的想法，他当场宣布这个电影简直一团糟，命令停止制作。卡曾伯格也同意了。“为什么会这么糟糕呢？”他问同事汤姆·舒马赫（TomSdmmacher）。“因为这已经不再是他们的电影了。”舒马赫直言不讳地说。他后来解释说，“他们遵从了杰弗里·卡曾伯格的所有修改意见，这个项目也被完全带走样了。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Lasseter realized that  Schumacher was right. “I sat there and I was pretty much embarrassed with what  was on the screen,” he recalled. “It was a story filled with the most unhappy,  mean characters that I’ve ever seen.” He asked Disney for the chance to retreat  back to Pixar and rework the script. Katzenberg was supportive.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>拉塞特意识到舒马赫说得没错。“我坐在那儿，屏幕上放映的东西令我感觉很尴尬，”他回忆说，“那个故事里充斥着一群我见过的最不开心、最尖刻的角色。”他请迪士尼给他一次机会，回皮克斯去返工。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs did not insert himself  much into the creative process. Given his proclivity to be in control,  especially on matters of taste and design, this self-restraint was a testament  to his respect for Lasseter and the other artists at Pixar—as well as for the  ability of Lasseter and Catmull to keep him at bay. He did, however, help  manage the relationship with Disney, and the Pixar team appreciated that. When  Katzenberg and Schneider halted production on <em>Toy Story</em>, Jobs kept the  work going with his own personal funding. And he took their side against  Katzenberg. “He had <em>Toy Story</em> all messed up,” Jobs later said. “He  wanted Woody to be a bad guy, and when he shut us down we kind of kicked him  out and said, ‘This isn’t what we want,’ and did it the way we always wanted.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯跟埃德·卡特穆尔承担了该片联合执行制片人的角色，但他自己没有过多参与创作过程。考虑到他那么有控制欲，尤其是在审美和设计方面，在这件事上他的自我克制显示了他对拉塞特和皮克斯其他艺术家的尊重——也显示了拉塞特和卡特穆尔让乔布斯保持距离的能力。但是乔布斯还是帮忙协调跟迪士尼的关系，皮克斯团队也对此很感激。当卡曾伯格和施奈德叫停《玩具总动员》的制作后，乔布斯用个人资金支持工作继续进行。他也站在拉塞特他们一边反对卡曾伯格。“他把《玩具总动员》都搞乱了，”乔布斯后来说，“他想把胡迪写成一个坏人，当他叫停这个项目时，我们就把他踢了出去，我们说，‘这不是我们想要的’，然后按照我们一直希望的去做。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The Pixar team came  back with a new script three months later. The character of Woody morphed from  being a tyrannical boss of Andy’s other toys to being their wise leader. His  jealousy after the arrival of Buzz Lightyear was portrayed more  sympathetically, and it was set to the strains of a Randy Newman song, “Strange  Things.” The scene in which Woody pushed Buzz out of the window was rewritten  to make Buzz’s fall the result of an accident triggered by a little trick Woody  initiated involving a Luxo lamp. Katzenberg &amp; Co. approved the new  approach, and by February 1994 the film was back in production.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>3个月之后，皮克斯团队拿出了一个新版本。胡迪的形象从统领安迪其他玩具的暴君式老板，转变成了他们的英明领导者。他在巴斯光年到来后表现出的嫉妒被描绘得更值得同情，配乐用了兰迪·纽曼（RandyNewman）的歌《奇怪的事》（StrangeThings）。胡迪把巴斯推出窗外的那一幕，被改写成是胡迪发起的一个小把戏引起的一场意外，其中还出现了顽皮跳跳灯（向拉塞特的第一部获奖动画短片致敬）。卡曾伯格和迪士尼公司通过了这个新版本，1994年2月，电影恢复制作。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Katzenberg had been  impressed with Jobs’s focus on keeping costs under control. “Even in the early  budgeting process, Steve was very eager to do it as efficiently as possible,”  he said. But the $17 million production budget was proving inadequate,  especially given the major revision that was necessary after Katzenberg had  pushed them to make Woody too edgy. So Jobs demanded more in order to complete  the film right. “Listen, we made a deal,” Katzenberg told him. “We gave you  business control, and you agreed to do it for the amount we offered.” Jobs was  furious. He would call Katzenberg by phone or fly down to visit him and be, in  Katzenberg’s words, “as wildly relentless as only Steve can be.” Jobs insisted  that Disney was liable for the cost overruns because Katzenberg had so badly  mangled the original concept that it required extra work to restore things.  “Wait a minute!” Katzenberg shot back. “We were helping you. You got the  benefit of our creative help, and now you want us to pay you for that.” It was  a case of two control freaks arguing about who was doing the other a favor.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>卡曾伯格对乔布斯的成本控制意识印象深刻。“即使是在早期的预算过程中，史蒂夫对成本都非常关注，希望尽量可以低成本髙效率。”他说。但是迪士尼批准的1700万美元的预算后来不够用了，尤其是在卡曾伯格迫使他们把胡迪的个性锐化以后，必须要作很多重大改动。所以乔布斯申请更多经费来完成这部电影。“听着，我们是说好了的。”卡曾伯格对他说，“我们把运营控制权给了你，你也同意了我们提出的资金规模。”乔布斯大发雷霆。他给卡曾伯格打电话或干脆飞去找他，用卡曾伯格的话说，“只有乔布斯能那么疯狂地没完没了。”乔布斯坚持说，迪士尼应该对成本超出预算负责，是卡曾伯格把最初的构思搅得一团糟，因此才需要做额外的返工。“等一等！”卡曾伯格反击道，“我们是在帮你。你得益于我们那么富有创造性的帮助，而你现在却要让我们因此付钱给你。”两个控制狂互不相让，争论到底谁帮了谁的忙。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Ed Catmull, more  diplomatic than Jobs, was able to reach a compromise new budget. “I had a much  more positive view of Jeffrey than some of the folks working on the film did,”  he said. But the incident did prompt Jobs to start plotting about how to have  more leverage with Disney in the future. He did not like being a mere  contractor; he liked being in control. That meant Pixar would have to bring its  own funding to projects in the future, and it would need a new deal with  Disney.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>埃德·卡特穆尔比乔布斯要圆滑得多，他能够解决问题。“我对杰弗里的看法比其他一些做这部电影的同事要正面得多。”他说。但是这件事确实促使乔布斯开始策划如何在未来对迪士尼有更大的影响力。他不想仅仅做个承包商。他喜欢控制局面。这意味着皮克斯未来必须把自己的资金带进项目，并且跟迪士尼重新燁判。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>As the film  progressed, Jobs became ever more excited about it. He had been talking to  various companies, ranging from Hallmark to Microsoft, about selling Pixar, but  watching Woody and Buzz come to life made him realize that he might be on the  verge of transforming the movie industry. As scenes from the movie were  finished, he watched them repeatedly and had friends come by his home to share  his new passion. “I can’t tell you the number of versions of <em>Toy Story</em> I  saw before it came out,” said Larry Ellison. “It eventually became a form of  torture. I’d go over there and see the latest 10% improvement. Steve is  obsessed with getting it right—both the story and the technology—and isn’t  satisfied with anything less than perfection.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>随着电影制作的进展，乔布斯越来越为之兴奋。他跟很多公司谈过出俜皮克斯——从贺曼贺卡（HallmarkCards）到微软——但是看到胡迪和巴斯的诞生，他意识到他可能即将改变电影业。当电影一幕幕完成后，他会反复观看，并邀请朋友到他家分享他的新愛好。“我都没法儿跟你说我在《玩具总动员》出品前总共看了多少个版本，”拉里·埃利森说，“到最后，这就变成了一种折磨。我要去他家看最新的那10%改进的内容。史蒂夫执迷于把一切都做好——无论是情节还是技术，任何不完美的东西他都不会满意。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs’s sense that his  investments in Pixar might actually pay off was reinforced when Disney invited  him to attend a gala press preview of scenes from <em>Pocahontas</em> in January 1995 in a tent in Manhattan’s Central Park.  At the event, Disney CEO Michael Eisner announced that <em>Pocahontas</em> would  have its premiere in front of 100,000 people on eighty-foot-high screens on the  Great Lawn of Central Park. Jobs was a master showman who knew how to stage  great premieres, but even he was astounded by this plan. Buzz Lightyear’s great  exhortation—“To infinity and beyond!”—suddenly seemed worth heeding.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>1995年1月，迪士尼在曼哈顿中央公园一处帐篷里举行了电影《风中奇缘》（Pocahcmtas、的新闻发布会，乔布斯受邀参加。这次活动进一步加强了他认为对皮克斯的投资会有所回报的想法。在现场，迪士尼CEO迈克尔·艾斯纳（MichaelEisner）宣布，《风中奇缘》的首映式将在中央公园的大草坪举行，将采用80英尺高的巨幅屏幕，观众将达10万人。乔布斯本身就是表演大师，知道如何举办一场成功的首映式，但即使是他都被这个计划震惊了。巴斯光年的那旬口号——“飞越太空，宇宙无限！”（toinfinityandbeyond）——突然看似值得留意了。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs decided that the  release of <em>Toy Story</em> that November would be the occasion to take Pixar  public. Even the usually eager investment bankers were dubious and said it  couldn’t happen. Pixar had spent five years hemorrhaging money. But Jobs was  determined. “I was nervous and argued that we should wait until after our  second movie,” Lasseter recalled. “Steve overruled me and said we needed the  cash so we could put up half the money for our films and renegotiate the Disney  deal.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯决定，那年11月发布《玩具总动员》的时候，就是皮克斯上市的最佳时机。然而，即使那些一贯非常积极的投资银行家也都觉得不靠谱，认为那根本不可能。皮克斯烧钱已经烧了5年。但是乔布斯决心已定。“我有些紧张，我认为我们应该等到第二部电影推出之后，”拉塞特回忆说，“史蒂夫否定了我的建议。他说我们需要钱，我们可以用一半资金做电影，然后跟迪士尼重新谈合同。”</p></div></div>

 

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><h3><a name="s3"></a>To Infinity!</h3>
<p>There were two  premieres of <em>Toy Story</em> in November 1995. Disney organized one at El  Capitan, a grand old theater in Los Angeles, and built a fun house next door  featuring the characters. Pixar was given a handful of passes, but the evening  and its celebrity guest list was very much a Disney production; Jobs did not  even attend. Instead, the next night he rented the Regency, a similar theater  in San Francisco, and held his own premiere. Instead of Tom Hanks and Steve  Martin, the guests were Silicon Valley celebrities, such as Larry Ellison and  Andy Grove. This was clearly Jobs’s show; he, not Lasseter, took the stage to  introduce the movie.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><h3>飞越太空！</h3>
<p>1995年11月，《玩具总动员》共举行了两场首映式。迪士尼在洛杉矶的埃尔卡皮坦大剧院（ElCapitan）举办了一场，还在隔壁建了一个游乐屋，展示所有的电影角色。皮克斯也有一些入场券，但是当晚的活动和邀请嘉宾的名单基本都是迪士尼决定的；乔布斯甚至都没去参加。第二天晚上，乔布斯在旧金山租用了与前者不相上下的雷根西剧院（Regency），举办了他自己的首映式。到场嘉宾不再是汤姆·汉克斯和史蒂夫·马丁这些影星，而是硅谷的那些大腕：拉里·埃利森、安迪·格鲁夫、斯科特·麦克尼利，当然还有史蒂夫·乔布斯。很显然这是一场史蒂夫的演出，他，而不是拉塞特占据了舞台，向观众介绍影片。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The dueling premieres  highlighted a festering issue: Was <em>Toy Story</em> a Disney or a Pixar movie?  Was Pixar merely an animation contractor helping Disney make movies? Or was  Disney merely a distributor and marketer helping Pixar roll out its movies? The  answer was somewhere in between. The question would be whether the egos  involved, mainly those of Michael Eisner and Steve Jobs, could get to such a  partnership.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>这种双首映式的安排凸显出一个日益严重的问题。《玩具总动员》到底是一部迪士尼电影还是一部皮克斯电影？皮克斯只是帮助迪士尼制作电影的动画承包商吗？抑或是，迪士尼只是帮助皮克斯出品电影的发行商和营销商？正确的答案在某个折中位置。问题是其中牵涉到的大腕们，主要是迈克尔·艾斯纳和史蒂夫·乔布斯，能否达成这样的合作关系。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The stakes were raised  when <em>Toy Story</em> opened to blockbuster commercial and critical success. It  recouped its cost the first weekend, with a domestic opening of $30 million,  and it went on to become the top-grossing film of the year, beating <em>Batman  Forever</em> and <em>Apollo 13</em>, with $192 million in receipts domestically  and a total of $362 million worldwide. According to the review aggregator  Rotten Tomatoes, 100% of the seventy-three critics surveyed gave it a positive  review. <em>Time</em>’s Richard Corliss called it “the year’s most inventive  comedy,” David Ansen of <em>Newsweek</em> pronounced it a “marvel,” and Janet  Maslin of the <em>New York Times</em> recommended it both for children and adults  as “a work of incredible cleverness in the best two-tiered Disney tradition.”</p>

<div class="right"><p>当《玩具总动员》获得巨大的商业成功和业界认可后，抉择变得更为艰难。影片第一周上映就收回了成本，美国国内公映的票房达到3000万美元&接下来，该影片打败了《永远的蝙蝠侠》（BatmanForever）和《阿波罗13号》（Apollo13），成为当年的票房冠军——美国国内收入1.92亿美元，全球总收入3.62亿美元。根据著名影评网站“烂番茄”（RottenTomatoes）的统计，接受调査的全部73个影评家100%都给出了好评。《时代》杂志的理查德·科利斯（RichardCorliss）称其为“本年度最具想象力的喜剧”；《新闻周刊》的戴维·安森（DavidAnsen）赞叹“不可思议、《纽约时报》的珍妮特·马斯林（JanetMaslin）认为该影片孩子和成人都要看，是“一部难以置信的智慧之作，体现了迪士尼最好的双层次作品的传统”。</p></div></div>

<p>The only rub for Jobs  was that reviewers such as Maslin wrote of the “Disney tradition,” not the  emergence of Pixar. After reading her review, he decided he had to go on the  offensive to raise Pixar’s profile. When he and Lasseter went on the <em>Charlie  Rose</em> show, Jobs emphasized that <em>Toy Story</em> was a Pixar movie, and he  even tried to highlight the historic nature of a new studio being born. “Since <em>Snow  White</em> was released, every major studio has tried to break into the  animation business, and until now Disney was the only studio that had ever made  a feature animated film that was a blockbuster,” he told Rose. “Pixar has now  become the second studio to do that.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>对乔布斯来说，唯一的问题就是，像马斯林这样的评论家在谈论“迪士尼传统”，而不是皮克斯的出现。事实上，她的影评里根本没提皮克斯。乔布斯很清楚，这是必须要加以改变的一个观念。当他和约翰·拉塞特参加《查理·罗斯秀》（CharlieRmeShow）时，乔布斯强调《玩具总动员》是一部皮克斯电影，他甚至想说明这个新制片厂的诞生是具有历史意义的。“自从《白雪公主》出品以来，每一家主要的电影制片厂都在试图打入动画产业，而到目前为止，迪士尼是唯一一家做出动画长片而且大获成功的。”他对罗斯说，“皮克斯现在成了第二家。”</p></div></div>

<p>Jobs made a point of  casting Disney as merely the distributor of a Pixar film. “He kept saying, ‘We  at Pixar are the real thing and you Disney guys are shit,’” recalled Michael  Eisner. “But we were the ones who made <em>Toy Story</em> work. We helped shape  the movie, and we pulled together all of our divisions, from our consumer  marketers to the Disney Channel, to make it a hit.” Jobs came to the conclusion  that the fundamental issue—Whose movie was it?—would have to be settled  contractually rather than by a war of words. “After <em>Toy Story</em>’s  success,” he said, “I realized that we needed to cut a new deal with Disney if  we were ever to build a studio and not just be a work-for-hire place.” But in  order to sit down with Disney on an equal basis, Pixar had to bring money to  the table. That required a successful IPO.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯立场鮮明地把迪士尼说成是皮克斯电影的发行商。“他一直说，‘我们皮克斯的人是干实事的，你们迪士尼的人都是笨蛋’”迈克尔·艾斯纳回忆说，“但正是我们让《玩具总动员》成功的。我们帮着塑造了这部电影，我们集各部门之力，从市场部到迪士尼频道，才让这部电影一炮而红。”乔布斯得出结论：“这是谁的电影”这个根本问题，必须通过合同解决，打口水仗没有意义。“《玩具总动员》大获成功后，”他说，“我意识到，我们必须跟迪士尼重新签合同，这样我们才能建一个电影公司而不是只当个供应商但是为了能和迪士尼平等地坐下来谈判，皮克斯必须有资金。这就需要一次成功的IPO。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The public offering  occurred exactly one week after <em>Toy Story</em>’s opening. Jobs had gambled  that the movie would be successful, and the risky bet paid off, big-time. As  with the Apple IPO, a celebration was planned at the San Francisco office of  the lead underwriter at 7 a.m.,  when the shares were to go on sale. The plan had originally been for the first  shares to be offered at about $14, to be sure they would sell. Jobs insisted on  pricing them at $22, which would give the company more money if the offering  was a success. It was, beyond even his wildest hopes. It exceeded Netscape as  the biggest IPO of the year. In the first half hour, the stock shot up to $45,  and trading had to be delayed because there were too many buy orders. It then  went up even further, to $49, before settling back to close the day at $39.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>股票公开发行在《玩具总动员》上映整一周后进行。之前乔布斯赌电影会成功，这个冒险的赌局有了巨大回报。和之前苹果公司的IPO—样，早上7点，主承销商在旧金山办公室开庆祝会，届时股票发售开始。原计划股票发行价格是14美元，以确保可以卖掉。乔布斯坚持定价22美元，这样一来如果发行成功，公司可以获得更多资金。然而事实证明，发行之成功甚至超出了他最大胆的想象，一举超过网景成为当年最大的IPO。开盘半小时，股票价格就飙升至45美元，因为买盘太多交易不得不延迟进行。接下来，价格继续上升至49美元，并在当天以39美元收盘。</p></div></div>

<p>Earlier that year Jobs  had been hoping to find a buyer for Pixar that would let him merely recoup the  $50 million he had put in. By the end of the day the shares he had retained—80%  of the company—were worth more than twenty times that, an astonishing $1.2 <em>billion</em>.  That was about five times what he’d made when Apple went public in 1980. But  Jobs told John Markoff of the <em>New York Times</em> that the money did not mean  much to him. “There’s no yacht in my future,” he said. “I’ve never done this  for the money.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>那年早些时候，乔布斯还曾经希望把皮克斯卖掉，收回他投资的5000万美元。而股票公开发行第一天结束时，他持有的公司80%的股票价值就已经涨到原来的20多倍，达到惊人的12亿美元。那相当于1980年苹果上市时他获得收益的5倍。但是乔布斯吿诉《纽约时报》的约翰·马尔科夫（JohnMarkoff），钱对他来说意义不大。“我的未来不需要游艇，”他说，“我做这个从来都不是为了钱。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The successful IPO  meant that Pixar would no longer have to be dependent on Disney to finance its  movies. That was just the leverage Jobs wanted. “Because we could now fund half  the cost of our movies, I could demand half the profits,” he recalled. “But  more important, I wanted co-branding. These were to be Pixar as well as Disney  movies.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>IPO的成功意味着皮克斯不再需要依靠迪士尼的资助才能完成电影。这正是乔布斯想要的砝码。“因为我们现在可以承担电影一半的成本了，我就可以要求一半的利润，”他回忆说，“但更重要的是，我想要品牌联合。这些电影将既是皮克斯的，也是迪士尼的。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs flew down to have  lunch with Eisner, who was stunned at his audacity. They had a three-picture  deal, and Pixar had made only one. Each side had its own nuclear weapons. After  an acrimonious split with Eisner, Katzenberg had left Disney and become a  cofounder, with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen, of DreamWorks SKG. If Eisner  didn’t agree to a new deal with Pixar, Jobs said, then Pixar would go to  another studio, such as Katzenberg’s, once the three-picture deal was done. In  Eisner’s hand was the threat that Disney could, if that happened, make its own  sequels to <em>Toy Story</em>, using Woody and Buzz and all of the characters  that Lasseter had created. “That would have been like molesting our children,”  Jobs later recalled. “John started crying when he considered that possibility.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯飞去跟艾斯纳共进午餐，艾斯纳被他的大胆惊呆了。他们之前签的是三部电影的合同，皮克斯刚刚制作了一部。双方都有自己的撖手锏。当时，卡曾伯格在跟艾斯纳决裂后已经离开了迪士尼，斯蒂芬·斯皮尔伯格（StevenSpielberg）和戴维·格芬（DavidGeffen）—起创立了梦工厂（DreamWorksSKG）。乔布斯说，如果艾斯纳不同意跟皮克斯重签合同，一旦原定的三部影片完成，皮克斯就会去跟另一家电影公司合作，比如卡曾伯格的新公司。而艾斯纳手里的砝码则是，一旦那样，迪士尼就会自己制作《玩具总动员》的续集，使用胡迪、巴斯以及所有拉塞特创造的角色。“那就像是要猥亵我们的孩子，”乔布斯后来回忆说，“约翰一想到那种可能性就哭了。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>So they hammered out a  new arrangement. Eisner agreed to let Pixar put up half the money for future  films and in return take half of the profits. “He didn’t think we could have  many hits, so he thought he was saving himself some money,” said Jobs.  “Ultimately that was great for us, because Pixar would have ten blockbusters in  a row.” They also agreed on co-branding, though that took a lot of haggling to  define. “I took the position that it’s a Disney movie, but eventually I  relented,” Eisner recalled. “We start negotiating how big the letters in  ‘Disney’ are going to be, how big is ‘Pixar’ going to be, just like  four-year-olds.” But by the beginning of 1997 they had a deal, for five films  over the course of ten years, and even parted as friends, at least for the time  being. “Eisner was reasonable and fair to me then,” Jobs later said. “But  eventually, over the course of a decade, I came to the conclusion that he was a  dark man.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>最终双方达成了和解方案。艾斯纳同意皮克斯为将来制作的电影注入一半资金并享有一半利润。“他不认为我们会制作出很多大片，所以他认为他给自己省了些钱。”乔布斯说，“这个安排最终对我们非常好，因为皮克斯接下来会连续制作出十部大片。”他们也就联合品牌达成协议，虽然经历了很多次讨价还价。“我最初的立场是，这是迪士尼的电影，由迪士尼出品，但是后来我让步了。”艾斯纳回忆道，“我们开始谈判迪士尼的字号多大，皮克斯的字号多大，就像4岁小孩一样。”到1997年初，他们签订了合同——未来10年制作5部影片——甚至还成了朋友，至少在当时是这样。“那时候艾斯纳还是很讲道理的，对我也还公平，”乔布斯后来说，“但是经过10年的时间，我得出的结论是，他是个阴暗的人。”</p></div></div>

<p>In a letter to Pixar  shareholders, Jobs explained that winning the right to have equal branding with  Disney on all the movies, as well as advertising and toys, was the most  important aspect of the deal. “We want Pixar to grow into a brand that embodies  the same level of trust as the Disney brand,” he wrote. “But in order for Pixar  to earn this trust, consumers must know that Pixar is creating the films.” Jobs  was known during his career for creating great products. But just as  significant was his ability to create great companies with valuable brands. And  he created two of the best of his era: Apple and Pixar.</p>

在给皮克斯股东的一封信里，乔布斯说明，赢得所有电影跟迪士尼平等共享品牌的杈利——包括广告和玩具——是这项合作里最重要的方面。“我们希望皮克斯成长为一个跟迪士尼享有同等信誉的品牌，”他写道，“但为了让皮克斯赢得这种信誉，消费者必须要知道是皮克斯在创作这些电影。”在职业生涯中，乔布斯因创造伟大的产品而闻名于世。然而，他创造伟大的公司和品牌价值的能力同样不凡。他创造了他的时代中最好的两个品牌——苹果和皮克斯。
