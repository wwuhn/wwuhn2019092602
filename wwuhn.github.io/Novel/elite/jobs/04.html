<h3>Atari</h3>

<p>In February 1974,  after eighteen months of hanging around Reed, Jobs decided to move back to his  parents’ home in Los Altos and look for a job. It was not a difficult search.  At peak times during the 1970s, the classified section of the San Jose Mercury  carried up to sixty pages of technology help-wanted ads. One of those caught  Jobs’s eye. “Have fun, make money,” it said. That day Jobs walked into the  lobby of the video game manufacturer Atari and told the personnel director, who  was startled by his unkempt hair and attire, that he wouldn’t leave until they  gave him a job. </p>

<p>Atari’s founder was a  burly entrepreneur named Nolan Bushnell, who was a charismatic visionary with a  nice touch of showmanship in him—in other words, another role model waiting to  be emulated. After he became famous, he liked driving around in a Rolls,  smoking dope, and holding staff meetings in a hot tub. As Friedland had done  and as Jobs would learn to do, he was able to turn charm into a cunning force,  to cajole and intimidate and distort reality with the power of his personality.  His chief engineer was Al Alcorn, beefy and jovial and a bit more grounded, the  house grown-up trying to implement the vision and curb the enthusiasms of  Bushnell. </p>

<p>Their big hit thus far was a video game called Pong, in which two  players tried to volley a blip on a screen with two movable lines that acted as  paddles. (If you’re under thirty, ask your parents.) </p></div>
<div class="right">


<h3>雅达利</h3>
<p>1974年2月，在里德学院晃荡了18个月之后，乔布斯决定搬回父母在洛斯阿尔托斯的住处，然后找一份工作。这并不是什么难事。20世纪70年代，《圣何塞水星报》（SanJoseMercury）的分类广告版面上，科技类的招工广告最多时曾达到60页。其中的一则广告吸引了乔布斯的目光。“在享乐中赚钱”，广告语是这么说的。那一天，乔布斯走进了游戏制造商雅达利公司（Atari）的大厅，对着被他不修边幅的发型和装扮吓了一跳的人事主管说，得不到一份工作他是不会离开的。</p>
<p>雅达利当时是非常热门的公司。它的创始人是髙大健壮的企业家诺兰·布什内尔（NolanBushnell），此人是个充满魅力、能说会道的梦想家——换句话说，又一个时代偶像。成名之后，他喜欢开着劳斯莱斯四处转悠，吸食毒品，在浴缸里开员工会议。他有一项能力——是弗里德兰也具有的、乔布斯日后也学会了的——就是将个人魅力转化为说服力，通过个性的力量进行劝诱、胁迫以及扭曲事实。他手下的首席工程师叫做阿尔·奥尔康（AlAlcom），一个健壮、快乐又很理性的人。他就像个家长一样，一方面要帮助布什内尔实现他的梦想，另一方面又要控制住他的狂热。</p>

<p>1972年，布什内尔指派奥尔康研发一款视频游戏《乒乓》（Pong）的街机版。游戏中两名玩家分别操纵屏幕上两根移动的光标充当球拍，拦截充当乒乓球的小光点（如果你不到40岁，问问你的父母）。</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>When Jobs arrived in  the Atari lobby wearing sandals and demanding a job, Alcorn was the one who was  summoned. “I was told, ‘We’ve got a hippie kid in the lobby. He says he’s not  going to leave until we hire him. Should we call the cops or let him in?’ I  said bring him on in!” </p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>当乔布斯穿着凉鞋来到雅达利公司要求工作时，有人通知了奥尔康。“我被告知：‘有个嬉皮士小子在大厅里，他说我们不雇他他就不走。我们该打电话报警还是让他进来？’我说，快带他进来！”</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Jobs thus became one  of the first fifty employees at Atari, working as a technician for $5 an hour.  “In retrospect, it was weird to hire a dropout from Reed,” Alcorn recalled.  “But I saw something in him. He was very intelligent, enthusiastic, excited  about tech.” Alcorn assigned him to work with a straitlaced engineer named Don  Lang. The next day Lang complained, “This guy’s a goddamn hippie with b.o. Why  did you do this to me? And he’s impossible to deal with.” Jobs clung to the  belief that his fruit-heavy vegetarian diet would prevent not just mucus but  also body odor, even if he didn’t use deodorant or shower regularly. It was a  flawed theory. </p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>乔布斯由此成为了雅达利公司第一批50名员工之一，职位是技术员，薪水每小时5美元。“现在想想，雇用一名里德学院的辍学生真有点儿不可思议，”奥尔康说，“但我在他身上看到了一些东西。他非常聪明，富有激情，对技术狂热。”奥尔康让乔布斯与一个叫唐·朗（DonLang）的工程师一起工作，此人的思想极其保守。第二天朗就开始抱怨了：“这家伙是个该死的有体臭的嬉皮士。你为什么要这么对我？还有，我裉本没法儿跟他相处。”乔布斯坚信，他以水果为主的素食习惯不仅会消除黏液，也会去除他的体味，就算他不用香体剂，也不常常洗澡。这是个错误的理论。</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Lang and others wanted  to let Jobs go, but Bushnell worked out a solution. “The smell and behavior  wasn’t an issue with me,” he said. “Steve was prickly, but I kind of liked him.  So I asked him to go on the night shift. It was a way to save him.” Jobs would  come in after Lang and others had left and work through most of the night. Even  thus isolated, he became known for his brashness. On those occasions when he  happened to interact with others, he was prone to informing them that they were  “dumb shits.” In retrospect, he stands by that judgment. “The only reason I  shone was that everyone else was so bad,” Jobs recalled. </p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>朗和其他人想赶走乔布斯，但布什内尔想出了一个解决方案。“他的体味和行为举止对我来说并不是问题，”他说，“史蒂夫是很麻烦，但我挺喜欢他。所以我让他上夜班。这样就可以把他留下了。”乔布斯会在朗和其他人下班之后过来上班，工作一整晚。即便已经隔绝到如此地步，他还是因为自己的鲁莽无礼出了名。在一些碰巧跟人交流的场合，他会肆无忌惮地称别人为“蠢货”。现在回想起来，他依然坚持自己的评判。“我那么耀眼的唯一原因就是，其他人都太糟糕了。”乔布斯回忆说。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Despite his arrogance  (or perhaps because of it) he was able to charm Atari’s boss. “He was more  philosophical than the other people I worked with,” Bushnell recalled. “We used  to discuss free will versus determinism. I tended to believe that things were  much more determined, that we were programmed. If we had perfect information,  we could predict people’s actions. Steve felt the opposite.” That outlook  accorded with his faith in the power of the will to bend reality. </p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>尽管他很傲慢——或者正是因为他的傲慢——他获得了雅达利公司老板的青睐。“他比其他与我共事过的人更加有哲学气质，”布什内尔回忆道，“我们曾经讨论过自由意志和宿命论的比较。我倾向于认为事情都是命中注定的，我们的人生都是被规划好的。如果有足够的信息的话，我们可以预知一个人的行动。史蒂夫的观点与我正相反。”这一观点与他“意志的力量可以改变现实”的信念是一致的。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Jobs helped improve  some of the games by pushing the chips to produce fun designs, and Bushnell’s  inspiring willingness to play by his own rules rubbed off on him. In addition,  he intuitively appreciated the simplicity of Atari’s games. They came with no manual  and needed to be uncomplicated enough that a stoned freshman could figure them  out. The only instructions for Atari’s Star Trek game were “1. Insert quarter.  2. Avoid Klingons.” </p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>乔布斯在雅达利学到了很多。他通过改进芯片，作出了更有趣的设计和更人性化的人机交互，进而完善了公司的一些游戏。布什内尔夸大事实的本事以及按自己规则办事的意愿影响了乔布斯。除此之外，乔布斯还很欣赏雅达利开发的游戏的简单性。游戏没有使用手册，简单到即便是一个喝醉酒的初学者也能很快上手。雅达利的《星际迷航》游戏仅有的说明就是：“1.投入硬币；2.躲开克林贡人。</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Not all of his  coworkers shunned Jobs. He became friends with Ron Wayne, a draftsman at Atari,  who had earlier started a company that built slot machines. It subsequently  failed, but Jobs became fascinated with the idea that it was possible to start  your own company. “Ron was an amazing guy,” said Jobs. “He started companies. I  had never met anybody like that.” He proposed to Wayne that they go into business together;  Jobs said he could borrow $50,000, and they could design and market a slot  machine. But Wayne  had already been burned in business, so he declined. “I said that was the  quickest way to lose $50,000,” Wayne  recalled, “but I admired the fact that he had a burning drive to start his own  business.” </p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>并不是所有同事都讨厌乔布斯。他与一个叫做罗恩·韦恩（RemWayne）的绘图员成了朋友，此人之前经营着自己的公司，生产老虎机，但之后生意失败了。然而乔布斯觉得开一家自己的公司这主意很吸引人。“罗恩是个很了不起的人乔布斯说，“他开过公司。我从没有遇到过他这样的人。”乔布斯向罗恩·韦恩提议两人一起做生意；他说自己可以借来50000美元，然后他们可以设计并销售老虎机。但是韦恩曾经在生意场上吃过苦头，所以拒绝了。“我说那是损失50000美元最快的方法，”韦恩回忆说，“但我很佩服他，他有很迫切的欲望去开始自己的事业。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>One weekend Jobs was  visiting Wayne at his apartment, engaging as  they often did in philosophical discussions, when Wayne said that there was something he needed  to tell him. “Yeah, I think I know what it is,” Jobs replied. “I think you like  men.” Wayne  said yes. “It was my first encounter with someone who I knew was gay,” Jobs  recalled. “He planted the right perspective of it for me.” Jobs grilled him:  “When you see a beautiful woman, what do you feel?” Wayne replied, “It’s like when you look at a  beautiful horse. You can appreciate it, but you don’t want to sleep with it.  You appreciate beauty for what it is.” Wayne  said that it is a testament to Jobs that he felt like revealing this to him.  “Nobody at Atari knew, and I could count on my toes and fingers the number of  people I told in my whole life. But I guess it just felt right to tell him,  that he would understand, and it didn’t have any effect on our relationship.” </p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>一个周末，乔布斯到韦恩的公寓拜访，像往常一样讨论哲学问題。这时韦恩说有些事情要吿诉乔布斯。“我想我知道你要说什么，”乔布斯回答，“我觉得你喜欢男人。”韦恩承认了。“那是我第一次遇到熟人中有同性恋，”乔布斯回忆，“他给我灌输了关于同性恋的正确观点。”乔布斯追问他：“你看到一个漂亮的女人会有什么感觉？”韦恩答道：“就好像你看到一匹漂亮的马，你欣赏它，但你不想和它上床。你只是纯粹欣赏它的美。”韦恩说自己就是想把这个告诉乔布斯。“雅达利公司没人知道，在我的一生中知道这件事的人也屈指可数，”韦恩说，“但我觉得告诉他没有任何问题，、他会理解的，而且这也不会影响到我们的关系。”</p>


</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><h3><a name="s3" id="s3"></a>India</h3><p>One reason Jobs was  eager to make some money in early 1974 was that Robert Friedland, who had gone  to India  the summer before, was urging him to take his own spiritual journey there.  Friedland had studied in India  with Neem Karoli Baba (Maharaj-ji), who had been the guru to much of the  sixties hippie movement. Jobs decided he should do the same, and he recruited  Daniel Kottke to go with him. Jobs was not motivated by mere adventure. “For me  it was a serious search,” he said. “I’d been turned on to the idea of  enlightenment and trying to figure out who I was and how I fit into things.”  Kottke adds that Jobs’s quest seemed driven partly by not knowing his birth  parents. “There was a hole in him, and he was trying to fill it.” </p></div>
<div class="right">
<h3>印度</h3>
<p>1974年初，乔布斯急切地想要赚钱，原因之一就是前一年夏天去过印度的罗伯特·弗里德兰鼓励他也去印度进行一次精神之旅。弗里德兰在印度师从尼姆·卡罗里大师（也就是马哈拉杰-吉），尼姆是20世纪60年代嬉皮士运动的精神导师。乔布斯决定也要去印度，还叫上了丹尼尔·科特基与他同行。驱动乔布斯的并不单纯是冒险精神。“对我来说这是一次很严肃的探索，”他说，“我迷上了自我启蒙的想法，想要弄清楚我到底是什么样的人，我该怎样融入这个世界。”科特基补充说，乔布斯的这次探索之旅，也有一部分是因为他不知道自己的亲生父母是谁。“他心里有个洞，他想把它填上。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>When Jobs told the  folks at Atari that he was quitting to go search for a guru in India,  the jovial Alcorn was amused. “He comes in and stares at me and declares, ‘I’m  going to find my guru,’ and I say, ‘No shit, that’s super. Write me!’ And he  says he wants me to help pay, and I tell him, ‘Bullshit!’” Then Alcorn had an  idea. Atari was making kits and shipping them to Munich,  where they were built into finished machines and distributed by a wholesaler in  Turin. But  there was a problem: Because the games were designed for the American rate of  sixty frames per second, there were frustrating interference problems in Europe, where the rate was fifty frames per second.  Alcorn sketched out a fix with Jobs and then offered to pay for him to go to Europe to implement it. “It’s got to be cheaper to get to  India  from there,” he said. Jobs agreed. So Alcorn sent him on his way with the  exhortation, “Say hi to your guru for me.” </p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>
当乔布斯告诉雅达利的同事们自己要辞职去印度寻找精神导师的时候，奥尔康被逗乐了。“他走进来，盯着我，然后宣布：‘我要去寻找我的导师了。’我说：‘不会吧！太棒了！记得给我写信！’然后他说希望我能承担他的费用，我告诉他：‘做梦！’”奥尔康有了一个主意。雅达利在生产一些配件，这些配件要运往慕尼黑，在那里组装完毕后由都灵的一家批发商负责配送。但是有一个问题。因为游戏都是为美国市场设计的，帧频是60帧每秒，到了欧洲就会有让人沮丧的冲突，因为那里是50帧每秒。奥尔康简单地向乔布斯描述了补救方案，然后花钱送他去欧洲解决问题。“从那里去印度路费会便宜一点儿。”他说。乔布斯同意了。就这样，奥尔康送走了乔布斯，还叮嘱他：“代我向你的导师问好。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Jobs spent a few days  in Munich,  where he solved the interference problem, but in the process he flummoxed the  dark-suited German managers. They complained to Alcorn that he dressed and  smelled like a bum and behaved rudely. “I said, ‘Did he solve the problem?’ And  they said, ‘Yeah.’ I said, ‘If you got any more problems, you just call me, I  got more guys just like him!’ They said, ‘No, no we’ll take care of it next  time.’” For his part, Jobs was upset that the Germans kept trying to feed him  meat and potatoes. “They don’t even have a word for vegetarian,” he complained  (incorrectly) in a phone call to Alcorn. </p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>
乔布斯在慕尼黑待了几天，解决了游戏机的冲突问题，但在这一过程中他把一群西装革履的德国经理搞得很困惑。他们向雅达利公司抱怨，说乔布斯的穿着和身上的味道像个流浪汉，而且举止粗鲁。“我说：‘他解决问题了没有？’他们回答：‘是的。’我说：‘下次你们再有什么问题，尽管给我打电话，我这儿还有很多像他那样的人！’他们说：‘不用，下次再有问题我们自己会解决的。’”乔布斯方面，德国人老是让他吃肉和土豆，这使他非常不高兴。“他们甚至没有素食这个词。”他在给奥尔康的电话中抱怨。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>He had a better time  when he took the train to see the distributor in Turin, where the Italian pastas and his  host’s camaraderie were more simpatico. “I had a wonderful couple of weeks in Turin, which is this  charged-up industrial town,” he recalled. “The distributor took me every night  to dinner at this place where there were only eight tables and no menu. You’d  just tell them what you wanted, and they made it. One of the tables was on  reserve for the chairman of Fiat. It was really super.” He next went to Lugano, Switzerland,  where he stayed with Friedland’s uncle, and from there took a flight to India. </p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>
他乘火车来到都灵见批发商后，日子好过了一点儿，意大利面和主人的热情招待让他很高兴。“我在都灵度过了很美妙的几个星期，这是座充满活力的工业城市，”他回忆说，“那个批发商是个很棒的人。他每天晚上都带我去一个地方吃饭，那儿只有八张桌子，没有菜单。你只需要告诉他们自己想吃什么，他们就会给你做。其中一张桌子是为菲亚特的董事长预留的。那个地方真是太好了。”接下来他去了瑞士的卢加诺，见了弗里德兰的叔叔，然后从瑞士搭航班到了印度。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>When he got off the  plane in New Delhi,  he felt waves of heat rising from the tarmac, even though it was only April. He  had been given the name of a hotel, but it was full, so he went to one his taxi  driver insisted was good. “I’m sure he was getting some baksheesh, because he  took me to this complete dive.” Jobs asked the owner whether the water was  filtered and foolishly believed the answer. “I got dysentery pretty fast. I was  sick, really sick, a really high fever. I dropped from 160 pounds to 120 in about a week.” </p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>
到了新德里，一下飞机，乔布斯就感觉到跑道上扬起的阵阵热浪，尽管那时候才四月份。之前有人给了他一家酒店的名字，但是那家酒店客满了，所以他去了出租车司机竭力推荐的另一家。“我敢肯定他拿了酒店的小费，因为那地方实在太糟糕了。”乔布斯问老板酒店里的水是否过滤过，并且傻乎乎地相信了他的回答。“我很快就得了痢疾，我病了，病得很严重，发高烧，一个星期内我的体重从160磅掉到了120磅。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Once he got healthy  enough to move, he decided that he needed to get out of Delhi. So he headed to the town of Haridwar, in western India  near the source of the Ganges, which was  having a festival known as the Kumbh Mela. More than ten million people poured  into a town that usually contained fewer than 100,000 residents. “There were  holy men all around. Tents with this teacher and that teacher. There were  people riding elephants, you name it. I was there for a few days, but I decided  that I needed to get out of there too.” </p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>
等他恢复到可以行动的时候，他决定离开新德里。于是他去了印度北部城市赫尔德瓦尔，那里靠近恒河的源头，每三年就会有一次盛大的宗教集会。恰巧，1974年举行的是12年一轮的最大规模的集会，被称为“大壶节”（KumbhaMela）。超过1000万人涌进了这座常住人口不到10万、面积接近帕洛奥图的小镔。“到处都是教徒，帐篷里住着这个导师、那个导师。还有人骑着大象，无奇不有。我在那儿待了几天之后决定离开。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>He went by train and  bus to a village near Nainital in the foothills of the Himalayas.  That was where Neem Karoli Baba lived, or had lived. By the time Jobs got  there, he was no longer alive, at least in the same incarnation. Jobs rented a  room with a mattress on the floor from a family who helped him recuperate by  feeding him vegetarian meals. “There was a copy there of Autobiography of a  Yogi in English that a previous traveler had left, and I read it several times  because there was not a lot to do, and I walked around from village to village  and recovered from my dysentery.” Among those who were part of the community  there was Larry Brilliant, an epidemiologist who was working to eradicate  smallpox and who later ran Google’s philanthropic arm and the Skoll Foundation.  He became Jobs’s lifelong friend. </p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>
他换乘火车和公共汽车来到了喜马拉雅山脚下，一座靠近奈尼塔尔（Nainital）的村庄。那里是尼姆·卡罗里大师居住（或者曾经居住过）的地方。乔布斯到达那里的时候，大师巳经不在人世了，至少不在今世。乔布斯从一户人家那里租下了一个房间，房间的地上有一块床垫。这户人家给他吃素食，帮他恢复了健康。“之前的一个旅行者留下了一本英文版的《一个瑜伽行者的自传》，我读了好几遍，因为也没什么其他可千的事。我在各个村落之间游荡，痢疾症状也消失了。”一起在此处静修的有一个叫做拉里·布里连特（LarryBrilliant）的流行病学家，他在印度致力于根除天花，后来负责管理谷歌的慈善机构以及斯科尔（Skoll）基金会。他成为了乔布斯的终生好友。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>At one point Jobs was  told of a young Hindu holy man who was holding a gathering of his followers at  the Himalayan estate of a wealthy businessman. “It was a chance to meet a  spiritual being and hang out with his followers, but it was also a chance to  have a good meal. I could smell the food as we got near, and I was very  hungry.” As Jobs was eating, the holy man—who was not much older than  Jobs—picked him out of the crowd, pointed at him, and began laughing  maniacally. “He came running over and grabbed me and made a tooting sound and  said, ‘You are just like a baby,’” recalled Jobs. “I was not relishing this  attention.” Taking Jobs by the hand, he led him out of the worshipful crowd and  walked him up to a hill, where there was a well and a small pond. “We sit down  and he pulls out this straight razor. I’m thinking he’s a nutcase and begin to  worry. Then he pulls out a bar of soap—I had long hair at the time—and he  lathered up my hair and shaved my head. He told me that he was saving my  health.” </p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>
有一次，乔布斯听说一个年轻的印度教圣人要举办信徒聚会，地点是一名富商位于喜马拉雅山脉的住处。“我有机会遇到一个有灵性的人并且和他的信徒交流，也有机会好好吃上一顿。我们走近房子的时候就能闻到食物的香味儿了，我非常饿。”乔布斯在吃的时候，那位圣人——其实也不比乔布斯大几岁——从人群中选中了他，指着他，然后开始疯了一样地大笑。“他跑过来，抓住我，发出两声‘嘟嘟’声，然后说：‘你就像个小孩一样。’”乔布斯回忆道，“我并不喜欢他的这些举动。”圣人抓着乔布斯的手，带他离开了那群虔诚的信众，走上了一处高地，那儿有一口井和一小方池塘。“我们坐下来，他拿出了一把剃刀。我以为他是个疯子，开始有点儿担心，这时候他又拿出了一块肥皂——我当时留着长发——他给我的头发打上肥皂，然后给我剃了个光头。他告诉我他是在拯救我的健康。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Daniel Kottke arrived  in India at the beginning of  the summer, and Jobs went back to New    Delhi to meet him. They wandered, mainly by bus,  rather aimlessly. By this point Jobs was no longer trying to find a guru who  could impart wisdom, but instead was seeking enlightenment through ascetic  experience, deprivation, and simplicity. He was not able to achieve inner calm.  Kottke remembers him getting into a furious shouting match with a Hindu woman  in a village marketplace who, Jobs alleged, had been watering down the milk she  was selling them. </p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>
丹尼尔·科特基在那年的初夏到了印度，乔布斯回到新德里去见他。他们坐着公共汽车，漫无目的地晃悠。这个时候，乔布斯已经不是在寻找传授智慧的导师了，而是在通过苦行体验、感官剥离和返璞归真寻求启蒙。他做不到内心的平和。科特基记得他曾在村里的集市上与一个印度妇女有过一次激烈的争吵，乔布斯称这个女人在她出售的牛奶里掺了水。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Yet Jobs could also be  generous. When they got to the town of Manali,  Kottke’s sleeping bag was stolen with his traveler’s checks in it. “Steve  covered my food expenses and bus ticket back to Delhi,” Kottke recalled. He also gave Kottke  the rest of his own money, $100, to tide him over. </p></div>
<div class="right">



　　但乔布斯有时候也很大方。他们来到靠近中国西藏的马纳里镇（Manali），科特基的睡袋被偷了，他的旅行支票也在里面。“史蒂夫承担了我的饮食开销，还给我买了回新德里的车票。”科特基回忆说。他还把自己剩下的100美元都给了科特基，帮他渡过难关。

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>During his seven  months in India, he had  written to his parents only sporadically, getting mail at the American Express  office in New Delhi when he passed through, and  so they were somewhat surprised when they got a call from the Oakland airport asking them to pick him up.  They immediately drove up from Los    Altos. “My head had been shaved, I was wearing Indian  cotton robes, and my skin had turned a deep, chocolate brown-red from the sun,”  he recalled. “So I’m sitting there and my parents walked past me about five  times and finally my mother came up and said ‘Steve?’ and I said ‘Hi!’” </p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>
在印度待了7个月后，那年秋天乔布斯启程回家，途中在伦敦逗留，拜访了一个他原本想在印度碰面的女人，然后从伦敦搭乘一班便宜的航班回到了奥克兰。在印度期间，他只零星地给父母写过几次信——那是他经过新德里时到美国运通公司驻当地办事处取邮件的时候——所以当接到他从奥克兰机场打来的电话让他们去接他的时候，他的父母还很惊讶。他们立刻从洛斯阿尔托斯开车出发。“我的头发被剃光了，身上穿着印度棉袍子，皮肤也被晒成了又黑又红的颜色，”他回忆说，“所以我坐在那儿，他们俩从我身边走过了差不多5次，妈妈才终于走上来说：‘史蒂夫吗？’我说：‘嗨！’”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>They took him back  home, where he continued trying to find himself. It was a pursuit with many  paths toward enlightenment. In the mornings and evenings he would meditate and  study Zen, and in between he would drop in to audit physics or engineering  courses at Stanford. </p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>
乔布斯被带回了洛斯阿尔托斯的家，在那里试着找回自己。他会通过各种途径来追求精神启蒙。早上和晚上他会冥想和禅修，其他时间会去斯坦福大学旁听物理学或者工程学的课程。

<div class="left"><h3><a name="s3" id="s3"></a>The Search </h3><p>Jobs’s interest in  Eastern spirituality, Hinduism, Zen Buddhism, and the search for enlightenment  was not merely the passing phase of a nineteen-year-old. Throughout his life he  would seek to follow many of the basic precepts of Eastern religions, such as  the emphasis on experiential praj?ā, wisdom or cognitive understanding that is  intuitively experienced through concentration of the mind. Years later, sitting  in his Palo Alto garden, he reflected on the  lasting influence of his trip to India: </p></div>

<h3>探寻</h3>
<p>乔布斯对东方精神、印度教、佛教禅宗以及探寻个人启蒙的浓厚兴趣，并不仅仅是一个19岁青年的心血来潮。纵观他的一生，他追随并遵循着许多东方宗教的基本戒律，比如对“般若”的强调——通过精神的集中而直观体验到的智慧和认知。多年之后，乔布斯坐在自己位于帕洛奥图的花园中，回想起了印度之旅对他的深远影响：</p>




</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Coming back to America was, for me, much more of a cultural  shock than going to India.  The people in the Indian countryside don’t use their intellect like we do, they  use their intuition instead, and their intuition is far more developed than in  the rest of the world. Intuition is a very powerful thing, more powerful than  intellect, in my opinion. That’s had a big impact on my work. </p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>我回到美国之后感受到的文化冲击，比我去印度时感受到的还要强烈。印度乡间的人与我们不同，我们运用思维，而他们运用直觉，他们的直觉比世界上其他地方的人要发达得多。直觉是非常强大的，在我看来比思维更加强大。直觉对我的工作有很大的影响。</p>




</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Western rational  thought is not an innate human characteristic; it is learned and is the great  achievement of Western civilization. In the villages of India, they never learned it. They  learned something else, which is in some ways just as valuable but in other  ways is not. That’s the power of intuition and experiential wisdom. </p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>西方的理性思维并不是人类先夭就具有的，而是通过学习获得的，它是西方文明的一项伟大成就。而在印度的村子里，人们从未学习过理性思维。他们学习的是其他东西，在某些方面与理性思维同样有价值，那就是直观和经验智慧的力量。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Coming back after  seven months in Indian villages, I saw the craziness of the Western world as  well as its capacity for rational thought. If you just sit and observe, you  will see how restless your mind is. If you try to calm it, it only makes it  worse, but over time it does calm, and when it does, there’s room to hear more  subtle things—that’s when your intuition starts to blossom and you start to see  things more clearly and be in the present more. Your mind just slows down, and  you see a tremendous expanse in the moment. You see so much more than you could  see before. It’s a discipline; you have to practice it. </p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>在印度的村庄待了7个月后再回到美国，我看到了西方世界的疯狂以及理性思维的局限，如果你坐下来静静观察，你会发现自己的心灵有多焦躁。如果你想平静下来，那情况只会更糟，但是时间久了之后总会平静下来，心里就会有空间让你聆听更加微妙的东西一一这时候你的直觉就开始发展，你看事情会更加透彻，也更能感受现实的环境。你的心灵逐渐平静下来，你的视界会极大地延伸。你能看到之前看不到的东西。这是一种修行，你必须不断练习。</p>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Zen has been a deep  influence in my life ever since. At one point I was thinking about going to Japan  and trying to get into the Eihei-ji monastery, but my spiritual advisor urged  me to stay here. He said there is nothing over there that isn’t here, and he  was correct. I learned the truth of the Zen saying that if you are willing to  travel around the world to meet a teacher, one will appear next door. </p>



<p>Jobs did in fact find  a teacher right in his own neighborhood. Shunryu Suzuki, who wrote Zen Mind,  Beginner’s Mind and ran the San Francisco  Zen Center,  used to come to Los Altos  every Wednesday evening to lecture and meditate with a small group of  followers. After a while he asked his assistant, Kobun Chino Otogawa, to open a  full-time center there. Jobs became a faithful follower, along with his  occasional girlfriend, Chrisann Brennan, and Daniel Kottke and Elizabeth  Holmes. He also began to go by himself on retreats to the Tassajara  Zen Center,  a monastery near Carmel  where Kobun also taught. </p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>禅对我的生活一直有很深的影响。我曾经想过要去日本，到永平寺修行，但我的精神导师要我留在这儿。他说那里有的东西这里都有，他说得没错。我从禅中学到的真理就是，如果你愿意跋山涉水去见一个导师的话，往往你的身边就会出现一位。</p>

<p>事实上，乔布斯确实在他洛斯阿尔托的家附近找到了一个导师。《禅者的初心》一书的作者铃木俊隆管理着旧金山禅宗中心，他每周三晚上会去那里开讲座，并和一小群追随者一起冥想。一段时间之后，乔布斯和其他人觉得不够，于是铃木让自己的助手乙川弘文（KobunChino）开办一家全天候开放的禅宗中心。乔布斯和女友克里斯安·布伦南，以及丹尼尔·科特基和伊丽莎白·霍姆斯都成了忠实的追随者。他还开始一个人去塔萨加拉禅宗中心（TassajamZenCenter）修行，这所寺庙靠近卡梅尔，是乙川弘文的另一处教学点。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Kottke found Kobun  amusing. “His English was atrocious,” he recalled. “He would speak in a kind of  haiku, with poetic, suggestive phrases. We would sit and listen to him, and  half the time we had no idea what he was going on about. I took the whole thing  as a kind of lighthearted interlude.” Holmes was more into the scene. “We would  go to Kobun’s meditations, sit on zafu cushions, and he would sit on a dais,”  she said. “We learned how to tune out distractions. It was a magical thing. One  evening we were meditating with Kobun when it was raining, and he taught us how  to use ambient sounds to bring us back to focus on our meditation.” </p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>科特基觉得乙川弘文很有趣。“他的英语非常糟糕，”他回忆说，“他说话就像是在吟诵俳句，话语极富启发性。我们就坐在那儿听他讲，有一半的时间我们根本不知道他在说什么。我把这个看做轻松的插曲。”他的女朋友霍姆斯则更加投入。“我们会去参加乙川弘文的冥想，我们坐在蒲团上，他坐在讲台上，”她说，“我们学会了怎样不理会外界的打扰。这是很神奇的一件事。有一天晚上，我们在和乙川弘文一起冥想，这时外面下起了雨，他就教我们怎样利用环境声音让自己集中注意力继续冥想。”</p>




</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>As for Jobs, his  devotion was intense. “He became really serious and self-important and just  generally unbearable,” according to Kottke. He began meeting with Kobun almost  daily, and every few months they went on retreats together to meditate. “I  ended up spending as much time as I could with him,” Jobs recalled. “He had a  wife who was a nurse at Stanford and two kids. She worked the night shift, so I  would go over and hang out with him in the evenings. She would get home about  midnight and shoo me away.” They sometimes discussed whether Jobs should devote  himself fully to spiritual pursuits, but Kobun counseled otherwise. He assured  Jobs that he could keep in touch with his spiritual side while working in a  business. The relationship turned out to be lasting and deep; seventeen years  later Kobun would perform Jobs’s wedding ceremony. </p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>而乔布斯的投入是全身心的。“他变得非常严肃，妄自尊大，让人难以忍受。”科特基说。乔布斯开始每天都和乙川弘文见面，每几个月都会一起静修、冥想。“与乙川弘文的碰面对我来说是一段意义非凡的经历，我后来尽可能多地与他待在一起，”乔布斯回忆说，“他有一个在斯坦福做护士的奏子，还有两个孩子。他妻子常常上晚班，所以我总是晚上去他们家找他。她一般会在午夜时分到家，然后把我赶走。”他们有时候会讨论，乔布斯是否应该完全投身到精神追求中，但乙川弘文不赞成这么做。他说乔布斯可以边工作边保持精神修行。他们两人的关系是深厚的，也是持久的：17年后，乙川弘文主持了乔布斯的婚礼。</p>




</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Jobs’s compulsive  search for self-awareness also led him to undergo primal scream therapy, which  had recently been developed and popularized by a Los Angeles psychotherapist named Arthur  Janov. It was based on the Freudian theory that psychological problems are  caused by the repressed pains of childhood; Janov argued that they could be  resolved by re-suffering these primal moments while fully expressing the pain—sometimes  in screams. To Jobs, this seemed preferable to talk therapy because it involved  intuitive feeling and emotional action rather than just rational analyzing.  “This was not something to think about,” he later said. “This was something to  do: to close your eyes, hold your breath, jump in, and come out the other end  more insightful.” </p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>乔布斯对自我意识的疯狂追寻也导致他开始尝试原始尖叫疗法，这一疗法由洛杉矶的精神治疗医师亚瑟·亚诺夫（ArthurJanov）发明，当时刚刚开始流行。这一疗法基于弗洛伊德的理论：心理问题都是由受到压抑的儿童时期的痛苦造成的。亚诺夫认为这些问题可以通过再次经历那些痛苦时刻来治愈——通过尖叫来完整地发泄那份痛苦。在乔布斯看来，这一疗法比谈话疗法要好，因为这其中包含了直观的感受和情感上的活动，而不仅仅只是理性的分析。“这种疗法不需要你去思考，”他后来说，“而需要你去行闭上眼睛，屏住呼吸，全身心投入其中，这之后你就会获得更深刻的见解。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>A group of Janov’s  adherents ran a program called the Oregon  Feeling Center  in an old hotel in Eugene that was managed by  Jobs’s Reed College guru Robert Friedland, whose All  One Farm commune was nearby. In late 1974, Jobs signed up for a twelve-week  course of therapy there costing $1,000. “Steve and I were both into personal  growth, so I wanted to go with him,” Kottke recounted, “but I couldn’t afford  it.” </p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>一群亚诺夫的信徒在尤金市的一座老旧酒店里经营着一家名为“俄勒閃感觉中心”的机构，而负责管理的正是乔布斯在里德学院的精神导师罗伯特·弗里德兰，他的团结农场就在附近。1974年底，乔布斯报名参加了那里一个为期12周的治疗，花费了1000美元。“史蒂夫和我都在追求个人成长，所以我想和他一起参加，”科特基说，“但是我没有那么多钱。”</p>




</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Jobs confided to close  friends that he was driven by the pain he was feeling about being put up for  adoption and not knowing about his birth parents. “Steve had a very profound  desire to know his physical parents so he could better know himself,” Friedland  later said. He had learned from Paul and Clara Jobs that his birth parents had  both been graduate students at a university and that his father might be  Syrian. He had even thought about hiring a private investigator, but he decided  not to do so for the time being. “I didn’t want to hurt my parents,” he  recalled, referring to Paul and Clara. </p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>乔布斯曾经向自己的密友透露过，他参加治疗是因为饱受童年痛苦：被领养并且对亲生父母毫无所知。“史蒂夫非常渴望了解自己的亲生父母，这样他就可以更好地认识自己。”弗里德兰后来说。乔布斯曾经从养父母那里听说过，自己的亲生父母都是大学毕业生，父亲可能是叙利亚人。他甚至曾经想要雇用一名私家侦探，但还是决定暂时不那么做。“我不想伤害我的父母。”他回忆说，这里指的是他的养父母。</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>“He was struggling  with the fact that he had been adopted,” according to Elizabeth Holmes. “He  felt that it was an issue that he needed to get hold of emotionally.” Jobs  admitted as much to her. “This is something that is bothering me, and I need to  focus on it,” he said. He was even more open with Greg Calhoun. “He was doing a  lot of soul-searching about being adopted, and he talked about it with me a  lot,” Calhoun recalled. “The primal scream and the mucusless diets, he was  trying to cleanse himself and get deeper into his frustration about his birth.  He told me he was deeply angry about the fact that he had been given up.” </p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>“自己被领养这一事实让他很挣扎，”伊丽莎白·霍姆斯说，“他觉得这是自己在情感上需要控制的一个问题。”乔布斯承认了这些，他说：“这件事一直困扰着我，我要把精力集中在这上面。”他对格雷格·卡尔霍恩更加坦诚。“对于被领养一事，他作了很多自我剖析，也跟我说了很多，”卡尔霍恩说道，“原始尖叫疗法和非黏液饮食，都是他用来净化自己的方法，并希望借此来洞彻其身世带给他的沮丧。他告诉我，他的父母握弃了他，他感到非常偾怒。”</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>John Lennon had  undergone the same primal scream therapy in 1970, and in December of that year  he released the song “Mother” with the Plastic Ono Band. It dealt with Lennon’s  own feelings about a father who had abandoned him and a mother who had been  killed when he was a teenager. The refrain includes the haunting chant “Mama  don’t go, Daddy come home.” Jobs used to play the song often. </p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>约翰·列侬（JohnLernioii）在1970年也接受了同样的原始尖叫疗法，那年的12月，他和塑胶洋子乐队（PlasticOnoBand）发布了歌曲《妈妈》。这首歌描述的是列侬对于一个抛弃了自己的父亲以及一个在他少年时期就死去的母亲的感情。副歌部分有一段让人无法忘怀的旋律：“妈妈不要走，爸爸快回家……”霍姆斯记得乔布斯经常放这首歌。</p>




</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Jobs later said that  Janov’s teachings did not prove very useful. “He offered a ready-made,  buttoned-down answer which turned out to be far too oversimplistic. It became  obvious that it was not going to yield any great insight.” But Holmes contended  that it made him more confident: “After he did it, he was in a different place.  He had a very abrasive personality, but there was a peace about him for a  while. His confidence improved and his feelings of inadequacy were reduced.” </p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>乔布斯后来说，事实证明亚诺夫的方法并没有什么效果。“他提供的只是一个现成的、老套的解决方法，太过简单了。很明显，它不可能促成任何自我省悟。”但霍姆斯坚信，治疗让乔布斯变得更自信了。“他接受完治疗之后有了改变，”她说，“他原本性格是很粗暴的，但那段时间他很平静。他的自信心增强了，自卑感减弱了。”</p>




</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Jobs came to believe  that he could impart that feeling of confidence to others and thus push them to  do things they hadn’t thought possible. Holmes had broken up with Kottke and  joined a religious cult in San    Francisco that expected her to sever ties with all  past friends. But Jobs rejected that injunction. He arrived at the cult house  in his Ford Ranchero one day and announced that he was driving up to  Friedland’s apple farm and she was to come. Even more brazenly, he said she  would have to drive part of the way, even though she didn’t know how to use the  stick shift. “Once we got on the open road, he made me get behind the wheel,  and he shifted the car until we got up to 55 miles per hour,” she recalled.  “Then he puts on a tape of Dylan’s Blood on the Tracks, lays his head in my  lap, and goes to sleep. He had the attitude that he could do anything, and  therefore so can you. He put his life in my hands. So that made me do something  I didn’t think I could do.” </p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>乔布斯开始相信自己可以把自信心传递给其他人，推动他们去完成以前认为不可能的事情。霍姆斯与科特基分手后，加入了旧金山的一个邪教组织，该组织希望成员切断与过去所有朋友的联系。伹是乔布斯完全无视这条禁令，有一天，他开着自己的福特牧场主（FordRancheiro）客货两用车来到了邪教的大本营，他对霍姆斯说自己要开车去弗里德兰的苹果农场，她也必须一起去。更过分的是，他说她也得开上一段路，尽管她根本不会开手动挡的车。“我们到了开阔的路上之后，他让我坐在驾驶座上，他负责换挡，直到我们的时速达到每小时55英里，”她说，“然后他开始放迪伦的磁带《路上的血迹》（BloodontheTracks），把头枕在我的膝盖上，睡着了。他的态度就是他什么都会做，因此你也要什么都会。他把自己的性命交到了我手里，让我做到了以前我认为自己做不到的事情。”</p>




</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>It was the brighter  side of what would become known as his reality distortion field. “If you trust  him, you can do things,” Holmes said. “If he’s decided that something should  happen, then he’s just going to make it happen.” </p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>这就是日后成为他“现实扭曲力场”个人魅力的美好的一面。“如果你相信他，你就能做成事情，”霍姆斯说，“如果他认为某件事应该发生，那他就会尽力让它发生。”</p>

<div class="left"><h3><a name="s4" id="s4"></a>Breakout </h3><p>One day in early 1975  Al Alcorn was sitting in his office at Atari when Ron Wayne burst in. “Hey,  Stevie is back!” he shouted. </p></div>

<h3><strong>打砖块</strong></h3>
<p>1975年初的一天，阿尔·奥尔康正坐在雅达利公司的办公室里，罗恩·韦恩冲了进来。“嘿！史蒂夫回来了!”他喊道。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>“Wow, bring him on  in,” Alcorn replied. </p></div>
<div class="right">



<p>“天哪，快让他进来。”奥尔康回答。</p>





</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Jobs shuffled in  barefoot, wearing a saffron robe and carrying a copy of Be Here Now, which he  handed to Alcorn and insisted he read. “Can I have my job back?” he asked. </p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>乔布斯光着脚走了进来，穿着一身橘黄色的袍子，手里拿着一本《此时此地》，他把书递给奥尔康，坚持要他也看看。“我能回来工作吗？”他问。</p>




</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>“He looked like a Hare  Krishna guy, but it was great to see him,” Alcorn recalled. “So I said, sure!” </p></div>

<p>“他看起来像个哈雷·克里希纳寺的僧人，但见到他我很高兴，”奥尔康回忆，“于是我说，当然！”</p>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Once again, for the  sake of harmony, Jobs worked mostly at night. Wozniak, who was living in an  apartment nearby and working at HP, would come by after dinner to hang out and  play the video games. He had become addicted to Pong at a Sunnyvale bowling alley, and he was able to  build a version that he hooked up to his home TV set. </p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>为了公司内的和谐，乔布斯再次被安排上晚班。沃兹尼亚克当时在惠普工作，就住在附近的一处公寓，他会在晚饭后去找乔布斯玩游戏。他在森尼韦尔的一家保龄球馆里爱上了《乒乓》游戏，他还开发出了一个版本，可以连接到自家的电视机上。</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>One day in the late  summer of 1975, Nolan Bushnell, defying the prevailing wisdom that paddle games  were over, decided to develop a single-player version of Pong; instead of  competing against an opponent, the player would volley the ball into a wall  that lost a brick whenever it was hit. He called Jobs into his office, sketched  it out on his little blackboard, and asked him to design it. There would be a  bonus, Bushnell told him, for every chip fewer than fifty that he used.  Bushnell knew that Jobs was not a great engineer, but he assumed, correctly,  that he would recruit Wozniak, who was always hanging around. “I looked at it  as a two-for-one thing,” Bushnell recalled. “Woz was a better engineer.” </p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>1975年夏末的一天，对当时盛行的“球拍类游戏即将完蛋”的言论嗤之以鼻的诺兰·布什内尔，决定开发《乒乓》的单机版本：玩家不再跟对手竞争，而是将球击向一堵墙，每击中一次，墙上就会减少一块砖。他把乔布斯叫进办公室，在自己的小黑板上画出了草图，然后叫他去设计。布什内尔告诉他，如果使用的芯片少于50个，那么每少用一个，就会有一笔奖金。布什内尔心里清楚乔布斯并不是一个伟大的工程师，但是他猜测——也猜对了——乔布斯会招来总在附近晃悠的沃兹尼亚克。“我把这看做是买一赠一，”布什内尔回忆道，“沃兹是个更加优秀的工程师。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Wozniak was thrilled  when Jobs asked him to help and proposed splitting the fee. “This was the most  wonderful offer in my life, to actually design a game that people would use,”  he recalled. Jobs said it had to be done in four days and with the fewest chips  possible. What he hid from Wozniak was that the deadline was one that Jobs had  imposed, because he needed to get to the All One Farm to help prepare for the  apple harvest. He also didn’t mention that there was a bonus tied to keeping  down the number of chips. </p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>当乔布斯邀请沃兹帮忙，并提出两人平分收入的时候，沃兹很兴奋。“这是我人生中受到的最美妙的一次邀请，我可以真正设计一款人们会用到的游戏。”他回忆说。乔布斯说任务必须在4天内完成，并且要使用尽可能少的芯片。乔布斯没有告诉沃兹，截止日期其实是自己定的，因为他需要赶去团结农场帮忙迎接苹果丰收。他也没有提到少用芯片会有奖金。</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>“A game like this  might take most engineers a few months,” Wozniak recalled. “I thought that  there was no way I could do it, but Steve made me sure that I could.” So he  stayed up four nights in a row and did it. During the day at HP, Wozniak would  sketch out his design on paper. Then, after a fast-food meal, he would go right  to Atari and stay all night. As Wozniak churned out the design, Jobs sat on a  bench to his left implementing it by wire-wrapping the chips onto a breadboard.  “While Steve was breadboarding, I spent time playing my favorite game ever,  which was the auto racing game Gran Trak 10,” Wozniak said. </p></div>
<div class="right">



<p>“这样的一款游戏需要耗费大多数工程师几个月的时间，”沃兹回忆说，“我觉得我肯定完成不了，但史蒂夫让我相信自己一定可以。”于是他接连4天没有睡觉，完成了任务。白天在惠普上班的时候，沃兹就在纸上画设计草图。下班之后，匆匆吃上一顿快餐，他就会赶到雅达利，在那儿待一晚上。沃兹尼亚克在设计的时候，乔布斯就坐在他左边的凳子上，将芯片布线到电路板上。“史蒂夫捣弄电路板的时候，我就玩我最爱的赛车游戏《极速赛道10》（GranTrak10）。”沃兹尼亚克说。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Astonishingly, they  were able to get the job done in four days, and Wozniak used only forty-five  chips. Recollections differ, but by most accounts Jobs simply gave Wozniak half  of the base fee and not the bonus Bushnell paid for saving five chips. It would  be another ten years before Wozniak discovered (by being shown the tale in a  book on the history of Atari titled Zap) that Jobs had been paid this bonus. “I  think that Steve needed the money, and he just didn’t tell me the truth,”  Wozniak later said. When he talks about it now, there are long pauses, and he  admits that it causes him pain. “I wish he had just been honest. If he had told  me he needed the money, he should have known I would have just given it to him.  He was a friend. You help your friends.” To Wozniak, it showed a fundamental  difference in their characters. “Ethics always mattered to me, and I still  don’t understand why he would’ve gotten paid one thing and told me he’d gotten  paid another,” he said. “But, you know, people are different.” </p></div>
<div class="right">



<p>令人惊讶的是，他们真的在4天时间里完成了任务，而且沃兹只用了45块芯片。虽然后来对此事的描述有多个版本，但在多数版本中，乔布斯只给了沃兹基本酬金的一半，而节省5枚芯片得到的奖金被他独吞了。直到10年以后，沃兹尼亚克才知道乔布斯得到奖金的事情〖他看到了一本讲述雅达利公司历史的书《咔嚓》（Zap）中的故事〗。“我想史蒂夫需要那笔钱，他只是没有告诉我事实而已。”沃兹如今这样说道。当他说起这件事的时候，停顿了很长时间，他也承认这事让他很痛苦。“我希望他当时能对我实话实说。如果他告诉我他需要那笔钱，他应该知道我肯定会把钱给他的。他是我的朋友，帮助朋友是天经地义的事情。”对沃兹尼亚克来说，这件事展现了他们两人性格上的差异。“对我来说道德总是很重要的，我直到现在都不明白，他明明收到了那笔奖金却告诉我他没有拿到，”他说，“但你也知道，每个人都是不同的。”</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>When Jobs learned this  story was published, he called Wozniak to deny it. “He told me that he didn’t  remember doing it, and that if he did something like that he would remember it,  so he probably didn’t do it,” Wozniak recalled. When I asked Jobs directly, he  became unusually quiet and hesitant. “I don’t know where that allegation comes  from,” he said. “I gave him half the money I ever got. That’s how I’ve always  been with Woz. I mean, Woz stopped working in 1978. He never did one ounce of  work after 1978. And yet he got exactly the same shares of Apple stock that I  did.” </p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>10年之后，这个故事被报道了出来，乔布斯给沃兹尼亚克打电话否认。“他告诉我他不记得做过这事，如果他做过这种事的话他应该会记得，所以他应该没有做过。”沃兹回忆。当我直接询问乔布斯的时候，他很反常地变得很安静，很迟疑。“我不知道那些传言都是从哪儿冒出来的，”他说，“我拿到的钱，分了一半给他。我跟沃兹之间一直都是这样的。沃兹1978年起就不再工作了，1978年之后他就再没做过任何工作。但他在苹果的股份还是和我一样多。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Is it possible that  memories are muddled and that Jobs did not, in fact, shortchange Wozniak?  “There’s a chance that my memory is all wrong and messed up,” Wozniak told me,  but after a pause he reconsidered. “But no. I remember the details of this one,  the $350 check.” He confirmed his memory with Nolan Bushnell and Al Alcorn. “I  remember talking about the bonus money to Woz, and he was upset,” Bushnell  said. “I said yes, there was a bonus for each chip they saved, and he just  shook his head and then clucked his tongue.” </p></div>
<div class="right">



<p>会不会众人的记忆都混乱了，乔布斯事实上真的没有少付沃兹钱呢？“有这样的可能，我的记忆全是错的、混乱的。”沃兹告诉我，但停顿了一会儿之后改口了，“但不是这样的，我记得这件事的细节，那张350美元的支票。”他和诺兰·布什内尔以及阿尔·奥尔康都进行了复核。“我记得我跟沃兹谈论奖金的时候，他很不高兴，”布什内尔说，“我说是的，你们每省下一枚芯片都会得到一笔奖金，然后他就摇了摇头，咂了哩嘴。”</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Whatever the truth,  Wozniak later insisted that it was not worth rehashing. Jobs is a complex  person, he said, and being manipulative is just the darker facet of the traits  that make him successful. Wozniak would never have been that way, but as he  points out, he also could never have built Apple. “I would rather let it pass,”  he said when I pressed the point. “It’s not something I want to judge Steve by.” </p></div>
<div class="right">



<p>不管事情真相到底如何，沃兹都坚持说，这件事情不值得再讨论了。他说，乔布斯是个复杂的人，善于耍手段只是展现了那些助他成功的诸多特性中的阴暗面。沃兹尼亚克永远不会那样，伹正如他所说，他也永远创建不了苹果公司。“我宁愿让这件事就这么过去了当我再三提起这件事时，他如此回答我，“我不想因为这件事就评判史蒂夫。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>The Atari experience  helped shape Jobs’s approach to business and design. He appreciated the  user-friendliness of Atari’s insert-quarter-avoid-Klingons games. “That  simplicity rubbed off on him and made him a very focused product person,” said  Ron Wayne. Jobs also absorbed some of Bushnell’s take-no-prisoners attitude.  “Nolan wouldn’t take no for an answer,” according to Alcorn, “and this was  Steve’s first impression of how things got done. Nolan was never abusive, like  Steve sometimes is. But he had the same driven attitude. It made me cringe, but  dammit, it got things done. In that way Nolan was a mentor for Jobs.”</p>
<p>Bushnell  agreed. “There is something indefinable in an entrepreneur, and I saw that in  Steve,” he said. “He was interested not just in engineering, but also the  business aspects. I taught him that if you act like you can do something, then  it will work. I told him, ‘Pretend to be completely in control and people will  assume that you are.’”  </div>

<p>雅达利的这段经历帮助乔布斯完成了他走上商业和设计道路的入门课。他非常欣赏雅达利“投入硬币一躲开克林贡人这样的游戏筒洁性和用户友好性。“那种简洁性影响到了他，让他成为了一个十分注重产品的人。”与乔布斯在雅达利共事过的罗恩·韦恩如是说。乔布斯还吸收了诺兰·布什内尔那股强势的态度。“诺兰是不允许别人对他说不的，”奥尔康说，“史蒂夫最初以为这样才能做成事情。诺兰从不会谩骂别人，史蒂夫有时候会。但他有同样积极的态度。这种态度让我惧怕，但它确实能办成事情。在这一方面，诺兰称得上是乔布斯的导师。”</p>

<p>布什内尔也同意这一说法。“企业家身上有一种很难描述的气质，我在乔布斯身上看到了那种气质，”他说，“他感兴趣的不仅仅是工程，还包括商业方面的一些东西。我教他，如果你表现得好像你能做某件事，那就能起到作用。我告诉他，装得好像你掌控了一切，别人就会以为你真的掌控了一切。”</p></div>
