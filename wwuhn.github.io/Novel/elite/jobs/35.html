<div class="left">  <h3><a name="s1"></a>Cancer</h3>
<p>Jobs would later  speculate that his cancer was caused by the grueling year that he spent,  starting in 1997, running both Apple and Pixar. As he drove back and forth, he  had developed kidney stones and other ailments, and he would come home so  exhausted that he could barely speak. “That’s probably when this cancer started  growing, because my immune system was pretty weak at that time,” he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><h3>癌症</h3>
<p>乔布斯后来推测，自己之所以会得癌症，是因为1997年辛苦工作了一整年，同时管理着苹果公司和皮克斯。由于两头奔忙，他患上了肾结石和其他疾病，到家后会虚脱得说不出话来。“癌症可能就是那个时候开始生长的，因为当时我的免疫系统非常弱。”他说道。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>There is no evidence  that exhaustion or a weak immune system causes cancer. However, his kidney  problems did indirectly lead to the detection of his cancer. In October 2003 he  happened to run into the urologist who had treated him, and she asked him to  get a CAT scan of his kidneys and ureter. It had been five years since his last  scan. The new scan revealed nothing wrong with his kidneys, but it did show a  shadow on his pancreas, so she asked him to schedule a pancreatic study. He  didn’t. As usual, he was good at willfully ignoring inputs that he did not want  to process. But she persisted. “Steve, this is really important,” she said a  few days later. “You need to do this.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>并没有证据表明疲劳和免疫系统薄弱会导致癌症。不过，乔布斯的肾脏问题间接让医生发现了癌症。2003年10月，乔布斯偶然碰到了自己的泌尿科医生，她让乔布斯作一下肾脏和输尿管的CAT扫描；他之前一次CAT扫描检查还是在5年前。这一次的扫描显示肾脏没有问题，但却发现胰脏有一层阴影。于是，她叫乔布斯安排一次胰腺检查，但他并未听从。一如既往，乔布斯会刻意忽视自己不想处理的事情，但是医生坚持一定要作检查。“史蒂夫，这很重要，”几天后她对乔布斯说，“你需要检查一下。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Her tone of voice was  urgent enough that he complied. He went in early one morning, and after  studying the scan, the doctors met with him to deliver the bad news that it was  a tumor. One of them even suggested that he should make sure his affairs were  in order, a polite way of saying that he might have only months to live. That  evening they performed a biopsy by sticking an endoscope down his throat and  into his intestines so they could put a needle into his pancreas and get a few  cells from the tumor. Powell remembers her husband’s doctors tearing up with  joy. It turned out to be an islet cell or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor,  which is rare but slower growing and thus more likely to be treated  successfully. He was lucky that it was detected so early—as the by-product of a  routine kidney screening—and thus could be surgically removed before it had  definitely spread.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>她的语气十分迫切，乔布斯不得不听从。他一大早就去了医院，在研究过扫描结果后，医生们告诉了他一个坏消息，他的胰脏上有个肿瘤。其中一位医生甚至建议他尽快安排好后事，换言之，就是说乔布斯只有几个月的寿命了。当天晚上，医生们将内窥镜从乔布斯喉咙放入肠内，以便将一根探针深入他的胰脏，从而获取一些肿瘤细胞，进行活组织切片检查。鲍威尔回忆说，医生检查完后高兴得哭了。因为那是胰岛细胞或是胰腺神经内分泌肿瘤，很少见，但生长较慢，因而更容易成功治愈。乔布斯很幸运，能及早发现这一肿瘤，这也算是定期肾脏检查的意外发现，这样，医生就能够在肿瘤大面积扩散前进行手术切除。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>One of his first calls  was to Larry Brilliant, whom he first met at the ashram in India. “Do you still  believe in God?” Jobs asked him. Brilliant said that he did, and they discussed  the many paths to God that had been taught by the Hindu guru Neem Karoli Baba.  Then Brilliant asked Jobs what was wrong. “I have cancer,” Jobs replied.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>拉里·布里连特是乔布斯第一批电话通知的人之一，两人当年在印度静修时相识。“你还相信上帝吗？”乔布斯问他。布里连特说相信，然后两人开始讨论印度大师尼姆·卡罗里·巴巴曾教给他们的通向上帝的几条路径。布里连特询问乔布斯有什么不妥，乔布斯回答说：“我得了癌症。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Art Levinson, who was  on Apple’s board, was chairing the board meeting of his own company, Genentech,  when his cell phone rang and Jobs’s name appeared on the screen. As soon as  there was a break, Levinson called him back and heard the news of the tumor. He  had a background in cancer biology, and his firm made cancer treatment drugs,  so he became an advisor. So did Andy Grove of Intel, who had fought and beaten  prostate cancer. Jobs called him that Sunday, and he drove right over to Jobs’s  house and stayed for two hours.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>亚瑟·莱文森当时是苹果公司董事会成员，他正在主持自己的基因泰克公司的董事会会议，电话响了，屏幕显示是乔布斯打来的。会议休息时间刚到，他就赶忙打给了乔布斯，得知了肿瘤的消息。莱文森有癌症生物学背景，基因泰克公司研制癌症治疗药物，于是莱文森成了乔布斯的顾问。英特尔公司的安迪·格鲁夫也一样，他成功对抗了前列腺癌。乔布斯在那个周日联系了格鲁夫，他立刻驱车前往乔布斯家，一待就是两小时。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>To the horror of his  friends and wife, Jobs decided not to have surgery to remove the tumor, which  was the only accepted medical approach. “I really didn’t want them to open up  my body, so I tried to see if a few other things would work,” he told me years  later with a hint of regret. Specifically, he kept to a strict vegan diet, with  large quantities of fresh carrot and fruit juices. To that regimen he added  acupuncture, a variety of herbal remedies, and occasionally a few other  treatments he found on the Internet or by consulting people around the country,  including a psychic. For a while he was under the sway of a doctor who operated  a natural healing clinic in southern California that stressed the use of  organic herbs, juice fasts, frequent bowel cleansings, hydrotherapy, and the  expression of all negative feelings.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>令朋友和妻子感到害怕的是，乔布斯不愿进行肿瘤切除手术，而手术是唯一可行的治疗方法。那之后几年过去，乔布斯对我说，“我当时真的不想让他们把我的身体切开，因此我努力寻找其他可行的方法。”言语中略带一丝遗憾。具体来说，他找的方法就是实行严格的素食，摄入大量新鲜胡萝卜和果汁。除此之外，他还进行针刺疗法，尝试各种草药疗法，有时也会采用在互联网上或在美国各地寻医问药获得的疗法，甚至还请过灵媒。有一阵子，他受到一位在加利福尼亚州南部开设自然疗法诊所的医生影响，这个医生主张使用有机药草，果蔬汁断食，经常洗肠、水疗，并发泄自己所有的负面情绪。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>“The big thing was  that he really was not ready to open his body,” Powell recalled. “It’s hard to  push someone to do that.” She did try, however. “The body exists to serve the  spirit,” she argued. His friends repeatedly urged him to have surgery and  chemotherapy. “Steve talked to me when he was trying to cure himself by eating  horseshit and horseshit roots, and I told him he was crazy,” Grove recalled.  Levinson said that he “pleaded every day” with Jobs and found it “enormously  frustrating that I just couldn’t connect with him.” The fights almost ruined  their friendship. “That’s not how cancer works,” Levinson insisted when Jobs  discussed his diet treatments. “You cannot solve this without surgery and  blasting it with toxic chemicals.” Even the diet doctor Dean Ornish, a pioneer  in alternative and nutritional methods of treating diseases, took a long walk  with Jobs and insisted that sometimes traditional methods were the right  option. “You really need surgery,” Ornish told him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>“最大的问题在于他还没准备好要开刀，”鲍威尔回忆说，“很难强迫一个人这样做。”但她还是尝试了。她对乔布斯说，“身体是为精神而存在。”乔布斯的朋友也多次劝他接受手术和化疗。“有一次，他告诉我他尝试通过吃些杂七杂八的草根进行治疗，我说你疯了吧。”格鲁夫回忆道。莱文森说，自己“每天恳求”乔布斯进行手术治疗，却发现“挫败感非常强烈，因为自己没法儿说服他”。这种分歧甚至差点儿让两人友谊破裂。“癌症不是这么治的，”当乔布斯谈论自己的饮食疗法时，莱文森坚持说道，“不动手术，想依靠这些有毒的化学物质来除掉肿瘤，根本不可能。”饮食医生迪恩·奥尼什（DeanOmish）是使用替代疗法和营养疗法的先驱，在一次陪乔布斯长时间散步时，甚至他也坚持认为传统的手术治疗有时是正确的选择。“你真的需要动手术。”奥尼什对乔布斯说。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs’s obstinacy  lasted for nine months after his October 2003 diagnosis. Part of it was the  product of the dark side of his reality distortion field. “I think Steve has  such a strong desire for the world to be a certain way that he wills it to be  that way,” Levinson speculated. “Sometimes it doesn’t work. Reality is  unforgiving.” The flip side of his wondrous ability to focus was his fearsome  willingness to filter out things he did not wish to deal with. This led to many  of his great breakthroughs, but it could also backfire. “He has that ability to  ignore stuff he doesn’t want to confront,” Powell explained. “It’s just the way  he’s wired.” Whether it involved personal topics relating to his family and  marriage, or professional issues relating to engineering or business  challenges, or health and cancer issues, Jobs sometimes simply didn’t engage.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>自2003年10月肿瘤确诊以来，乔布斯顽固地坚持了9个月。这部分是因为其现实扭曲力场的不良影响。“我觉得，史蒂夫强烈渴望世界按照自己所设想的那样运行，”莱文森推测道。“有时这是行不通的，现实是无情的。”另一部分原因则在于，乔布斯有着可怕的意志，能够完全忽略自己不想处理的事情。这给他带来了许多重大突破，但也可能造成适得其反的效果。“他能够忽略自己不想面对的东西，”他的妻子解释说，“他天生就是这样。”无论是与家庭和婚姻有关的个人问题，还是涉及工程或业务的专业问题，或是癌症和健康问题，乔布斯有时干脆就置之不理。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>In the past he had  been rewarded for what his wife called his “magical thinking”—his assumption  that he could will things to be as he wanted. But cancer does not work that  way. Powell enlisted everyone close to him, including his sister Mona Simpson,  to try to bring him around. In July 2004 a CAT scan showed that the tumor had grown and  possibly spread. It forced him to face reality.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯认为自己能把事情变成所希望的样子——他妻子称这为“异想天开”——以前，他也的确能够如愿以偿，然而他的癌症却是个例外。鲍威尔发动了乔布斯所有亲近的人，包括他的妹妹莫娜·辛普森，想要让他回心转意。最终，2004年7月，CAT扫描结果显示肿瘤已长大并可能扩散。这令他不得不面对现实。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs underwent surgery  on Saturday, July 31, 2004, at Stanford University Medical Center. He did not  have a full “Whipple procedure,” which removes a large part of the stomach and  intestine as well as the pancreas. The doctors considered it, but decided  instead on a less radical approach, a modified Whipple that removed only part  of the pancreas.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>2004年7月31日，周六，乔布斯在斯坦福大学医学中心接受了外科手术。他所进行的并非是完整的“惠普尔手术”——切除大部分胃和肠道，及全部胰脏。医生们考虑过实施完整的手术，但最终决定不采用如此彻底的做法，而只是切除了乔布斯的部分胰脏。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs sent employees an  email the next day, using his PowerBook hooked up to an AirPort Express in his  hospital room, announcing his surgery. He assured them that the type of  pancreatic cancer he had “represents about 1% of the total cases of pancreatic  cancer diagnosed each year, and can be cured by surgical removal if diagnosed  in time (mine was).” He said he would not require chemotherapy or radiation  treatment, and he planned to return to work in September. “While I’m out, I’ve  asked Tim Cook to be responsible for Apple’s day to day operations, so we shouldn’t  miss a beat. I’m sure I’ll be calling some of you way too much in August, and I  look forward to seeing you in September.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>手术后第二天，乔布斯在医院病房用PowerBook连接到AirPortExpress无线基站，给公司员工发送了一封邮件，宣告自己完成了手术。他安慰员工们，自己所患的胰腺癌类型“在每年确诊的各种胰腺癌病例中只占1%，如果发现得及时（我就是），可通过手术切除治愈”。他表示自己不需要化疗或放疗，并计划于9月复工。“在离开的这段时间，我已让蒂姆·库克负责苹果公司的日常运营，因此我们不应该乱了阵脚，”他写道，“我敢肯定，8月份，我会经常联系你们中的一些人，并期待在9月见到你们。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>One side effect of the  operation would become a problem for Jobs because of his obsessive diets and  the weird routines of purging and fasting that he had practiced since he was a  teenager. Because the pancreas provides the enzymes that allow the stomach to  digest food and absorb nutrients, removing part of the organ makes it hard to  get enough protein. Patients are advised to make sure that they eat frequent  meals and maintain a nutritious diet, with a wide variety of meat and fish  proteins as well as full-fat milk products. Jobs had never done this, and he  never would.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>手术带来的一个影响对乔布斯来说很成问题，原因在于他近乎强迫的饮食习惯，以及从十几岁起就一直坚持的节食和禁食的怪异实践。胰脏会分泌出一种酶，让胃消化食物并吸收营养，部分胰脏被切除后，人体就难以获得足够的蛋白质。因此，患者应该多餐，并保持营养丰富的饮食，食用各种肉类、鱼类蛋白质，以及全脂牛奶。但乔布斯从来没有这样做过，也永远不会这样做。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>He stayed in the  hospital for two weeks and then struggled to regain his strength. “I remember  coming back and sitting in that rocking chair,” he told me, pointing to one in  his living room. “I didn’t have the energy to walk. It took me a week before I  could walk around the block. I pushed myself to walk to the gardens a few  blocks away, then further, and within six months I had my energy almost back.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>他在医院住了两周后，挣扎着进行力量恢复。“我记得回来以后，坐在那个摇椅上，”他边说边指着客厅里的那张摇椅，“我没有力气走路。休养了一个星期后，我才能在街区走动。我强迫自己走到几个街区之外的花园，然后再走到更远的地方，不出6个月，我的精力基本都恢复了。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Unfortunately the  cancer had spread. During the operation the doctors found three liver  metastases. Had they operated nine months earlier, they might have caught it before  it spread, though they would never know for sure. Jobs began chemotherapy  treatments, which further complicated his eating challenges.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>不幸的是，癌细胞扩散了。在手术中，医生们发现肝脏上有三处转移。如果不是拖了9个月才手术，医生们也许可以在癌细胞扩散前就把整个肿瘤切除，虽然这也不一定。乔布斯开始接受化疗，这进一步加剧了他在饮食上面临的挑战。</p></div></div>

 

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><h3><a name="s2"></a>The Stanford Commencement</h3>
<p>Jobs kept his  continuing battle with the cancer secret—he told everyone that he had been  “cured”—just as he had kept quiet about his diagnosis in October 2003. Such secrecy  was not surprising; it was part of his nature. What was more surprising was his  decision to speak very personally and publicly about his cancer diagnosis.  Although he rarely gave speeches other than his staged product demonstrations,  he accepted Stanford’s invitation to give its June 2005 commencement address.  He was in a reflective mood after his health scare and turning fifty.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><h3>斯坦福大学毕业典礼演讲</h3>
<p>乔布斯隐瞒了他继续与癌症抗争的实情，告诉大家，他已被“治愈”了，这一如他2003年10月癌症确诊后的缄口不言。这样保密并不稀奇，它是乔布斯本性的一部分。更为令人惊奇的是，他决定公开谈论自己的健康问题。除了登台演示产品，乔布斯平时很少作演讲，但他仍然接受了斯坦福大学2005年毕业典礼的演讲邀请。在癌症确诊之后，即将50岁的他，处于一种反思状态。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>For help with the  speech, he called the brilliant scriptwriter Aaron Sorkin (<em>A Few Good Men,  The West Wing</em>). Jobs sent him some thoughts. “That was in February, and I  heard nothing, so I ping him again in April, and he says, ‘Oh, yeah,’ and I  send him a few more thoughts,” Jobs recounted. “I finally get him on the phone,  and he keeps saying ‘Yeah,’ but finally it’s the beginning of June, and he  never sent me anything.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>为了完成演讲，乔布斯找到了杰出的编剧艾伦·索金（AaronSoridn），其作品包括电影《好人寥寥》（AFewGoodMen）和《白宫风云》（TheWestWing）。索金答应帮忙，于是乔布斯给他发了电子邮件，表达了自己的一些想法。乔布斯回忆道：“当时是2月，他没有回复。于是4月的时候我又发了一次邮件，他说‘哦，好啊。’然后我又发了些新想法给他，后来终于电话联系上了，他不停地说‘嗯’，但是一直到6月初，他什么都没给我。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs got panicky. He  had always written his own presentations, but he had never done a commencement  address. One night he sat down and wrote the speech himself, with no help other  than bouncing ideas off his wife. As a result, it turned out to be a very  intimate and simple talk, with the unadorned and personal feel of a perfect  Steve Jobs product.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯有点儿不安。以前产品展示的脚本都是他自己写的，但是他从来没有在毕业典礼上作过演讲。一天晚上，他开始自己撰写演讲稿，除了征求妻子的意见，没有其他任何人的帮助。他写出了一篇非常亲切简涪的讲话稿，充满朴实的个人感受，是完美的乔布斯作品。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Alex Haley once said  that the best way to begin a speech is “Let me tell you a story.” Nobody is  eager for a lecture, but everybody loves a story. And that was the approach  Jobs chose. “Today, I want to tell you three stories from my life,” he began.  “That’s it. No big deal. Just three stories.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>美国作家亚历克斯·黑利（AlexHaley）曾说过，演讲最好的开场是“我来给你们讲个故事吧”。没人愿意听别人说教，但是人人都喜欢听故亊。而这正是乔布斯选择的演讲方式。他的开场白是这样的：“今天，我想向你们讲述我人生中的三个故事，就是这样，没什么大不了的，三个故事而已。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The first was about  dropping out of Reed College. “I could stop taking the required classes that  didn’t interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more  interesting.” The second was about how getting fired from Apple turned out to  be good for him. “The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the  lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything.” The students  were unusually attentive, despite a plane circling overhead with a banner that  exhorted “recycle all e-waste,” and it was his third tale that enthralled them.  It was about being diagnosed with cancer and the awareness it brought:</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>第一个是从里德学院退学的故事。“我不用再去上自己不感兴趣的必修课，可以去听更有趣的课程。”第二个故事是被苹果公司解雇如何变成了对自己有益的经历。“成功的沉重又重新被初学者的轻松所代替，对所有事情都不再那样确信。”尽管现场有架飞机挂着一张敦促乔布斯“回收所有电子废物”的条幅，不停地在演讲场地上方盘旋，但是学生们都听得异常专注。不过，深深吸引他们的是第三个故事——确诊患有癌症及这一事实所带来的想法。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Remembering  that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help  me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything—all external  expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure—these things just  fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.  Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap  of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason  not to follow your heart.</p>
  <p>The artful minimalism  of the speech gave it simplicity, purity, and charm. Search where you will,  from anthologies to YouTube, and you won’t find a better commencement address.  Others may have been more important, such as George Marshall’s at Harvard in  1947 announcing a plan to rebuild Europe, but none has had more grace.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p><p>记住自己很快就要死了，这是我面对人生重大选择时最重要的工具。因为，几乎一切——所有外界的期望，所有骄傲，所有对于困窘和失败的恐惧——这些东西都在死亡面前烟消云散，只留下真正重要的东西。记住自己终会死去，是我所知最好的方式，避免陷入认为自己会失去什么的陷阱。你已是一无所有，没理由不追随内心。</p>
<p>乔布斯的极简主义，令这场讲话简单、纯粹，充满魅力。无论文集里还是YouTube上，你都找不到更好的毕业演讲了。有些演讲可能更重要，如乔治·马歇尔（GeorgeMarshall）1947年在哈佛大学的演讲，宣布重建欧洲的计划。但是，没有哪个演讲比乔布斯的更富魅力。</p></div></div>

 

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><h3><a name="s3"></a>A Lion at Fifty</h3>
<p>For his thirtieth and  fortieth birthdays, Jobs had celebrated with the stars of Silicon Valley and  other assorted celebrities. But when he turned fifty in 2005, after coming back  from his cancer surgery, the surprise party that his wife arranged featured  mainly his closest friends and professional colleagues. It was at the  comfortable San Francisco home of some friends, and the great chef Alice Waters  prepared salmon from Scotland along with couscous and a variety of  garden-raised vegetables. “It was beautifully warm and intimate, with everyone  and the kids all able to sit in one room,” Waters recalled. The entertainment  was comedy improvisation done by the cast of <em>Whose Line Is It Anyway?</em> Jobs’s close friend Mike Slade was there, along with colleagues from Apple and  Pixar, including Lasseter, Cook, Schiller, Clow, Rubinstein, and Tevanian.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><h3>50岁的雄狮</h3>

<p>乔布斯的30岁和40岁生日都是同硅谷名人及各界名流共同庆祝。但是，2005年，在他做完癌症手术后，妻子为他的50岁生日举办了一个惊喜派对，主要邀请了他最亲密的朋友和同事。派对在朋友们位于旧金山的家中举行，著名大厨爱丽丝·沃特斯呈上了来自苏格兰的鲑鱼、北非名菜库斯库斯，还有各种田园时蔬。沃特斯回忆说：“场面温馨亲密极了，大人小孩都坐在一起。”娱乐活动是一出即兴表演，由《对台词》（WhoseLineIsItAnyway?）的演员表演。乔布斯的好朋友迈克·斯莱德（MikeSlade）也去了，还有来自苹果公司和皮克斯的同事，包括拉塞特、库克、席勒、克劳、鲁宾斯坦和泰瓦尼安。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Cook had done a good  job running the company during Jobs’s absence. He kept Apple’s temperamental  actors performing well, and he avoided stepping into the limelight. Jobs liked  strong personalities, up to a point, but he had never truly empowered a deputy  or shared the stage. It was hard to be his understudy. You were damned if you  shone, and damned if you didn’t. Cook had managed to navigate those shoals. He  was calm and decisive when in command, but he didn’t seek any notice or acclaim  for himself. “Some people resent the fact that Steve gets credit for  everything, but I’ve never given a rat’s ass about that,” said Cook. “Frankly speaking,  I’d prefer my name never be in the paper.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>在乔布斯病休期间，库克把公司打理得很好。在他的带领下，苹果公司个性十足的员工们表现良好，同时，库克又避免让自己进入公众视线。在某种程度上，乔布斯喜欢强势的人，但是他从未真正让他人代理自己的工作或分享自己的舞台。做他的替补很难，出风头了该死，不出众也该死。库克成功避开了这些危险。在发号施令时，他冷静果断，但同时，他并不追求别人的注意与喝彩。“有些人反感什么好处都算在史蒂夫头上，但是我对这些从来都不在乎，”库克表示，“老实说，我希望自己的名字从不出现在报纸上。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>When Jobs returned  from his medical leave, Cook resumed his role as the person who kept the moving  parts at Apple tightly meshed and remained unfazed by Jobs’s tantrums. “What I  learned about Steve was that people mistook some of his comments as ranting or  negativism, but it was really just the way he showed passion. So that’s how I  processed it, and I never took issues personally.” In many ways he was Jobs’s  mirror image: unflappable, steady in his moods, and (as the thesaurus in the  NeXT would have noted) saturnine rather than mercurial. “I’m a good negotiator,  but he’s probably better than me because he’s a cool customer,” Jobs later  said. After adding a bit more praise, he quietly added a reservation, one that  was serious but rarely spoken: “But Tim’s not a product person, per se.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯病假结束回到苹果后，库克重新做回自己以前的工作——紧密地整合苹果公司各个行动部门，也依然平静地面对乔布斯的怒气。“我知道，人们会把史蒂夫的一些评论误会成大叫大嚷或干脆反对，但事实上那只是他表达激情的方式。我就是这样面对他的情绪化作风的，我从不觉得他是在针对我。”在很多方面，库克都和乔布斯截然相反：他镇定，情绪稳定（正如NeXT机器中安装的辞典所解释的那样），属于土星型而非水星型的。“我是个谈判髙手，但他可能比我更好，因为他大胆又冷静。”乔布斯后来表示。又夸赞了库克几句之后，乔布斯不动声色地说出了自己的保留意见，“但蒂姆本身不是搞产品的人。”他是认真的，但很少这么说。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>In the fall of 2005,  after returning from his medical leave, Jobs tapped Cook to become Apple’s  chief operating officer. They were flying together to Japan. Jobs didn’t really <em>ask</em> Cook; he simply turned to him and said, “I’ve decided to make you  COO.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>2005年秋，乔布斯任命库克为苹果公司的首席运营官。当时他们共同飞往日本，乔布斯并没有征询库克的意见，直接告诉他说：“我决定让你担任首席运营官。”</p></div></div>

<p>Around that time,  Jobs’s old friends Jon Rubinstein and Avie Tevanian, the hardware and software  lieutenants who had been recruited during the 1997 restoration, decided to  leave. In Tevanian’s case, he had made a lot of money and was ready to quit  working. “Avie is a brilliant guy and a nice guy, much more grounded than Ruby  and doesn’t carry the big ego,” said Jobs. “It was a huge loss for us when Avie  left. He’s a one-of-a-kind person—a genius.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>那段时间里，乔布斯的老朋友乔纳森·鲁宾斯坦和阿维·泰瓦尼安决定离开苹果。他们分别是硬件和软件方面的团队管理者，1997年，乔布斯回归苹果后重新聘用了他们。泰瓦尼安已经赚了很多钱，准备退休。“阿维是个出色的家伙，人很好，比鲁比更踏实，不自大。”乔布斯说，“阿维的离开是苹果公司的一个巨大损失，他独一无二，是个天才。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Rubinstein’s case was  a little more contentious. He was upset by Cook’s ascendency and frazzled after  working for nine years under Jobs. Their shouting matches became more frequent.  There was also a substantive issue: Rubinstein was repeatedly clashing with  Jony Ive, who used to work for him and now reported directly to Jobs. Ive was  always pushing the envelope with designs that dazzled but were difficult to  engineer. It was Rubinstein’s job to get the hardware built in a practical way,  so he often balked. He was by nature cautious. “In the end, Ruby’s from HP,”  said Jobs. “And he never delved deep, he wasn’t aggressive.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>鲁宾斯坦的离职略有争议。他对于库克的晋升感到不满，也因为他在乔布斯手下工作了9年，身心疲惫。他们的争吵越发频繁。还有一个实际问题：鲁宾斯坦曾多次与乔尼·艾弗发生冲突，艾弗曾在鲁宾斯坦手下工作，现在直接向乔布斯汇报。艾弗经常挑战工程制造的极限，作出目眩神迷但难以实现的设计。鲁宾斯坦天性谨慎，他的工作则是用一种可行的方式来组建硬件，于是他常常否决艾弗的设计。话说回来，鲁比以前是在惠普工作，”乔布斯说道，“他从来不会深入探究，他没什么进取心。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>There was, for  example, the case of the screws that held the handles on the Power Mac G4. Ive  decided that they should have a certain polish and shape. But Rubinstein  thought that would be “astronomically” costly and delay the project for weeks,  so he vetoed the idea. His job was to deliver products, which meant making  trade-offs. Ive viewed that approach as inimical to innovation, so he would go  both above him to Jobs and also around him to the midlevel engineers. “Ruby  would say, ‘You can’t do this, it will delay,’ and I would say, ‘I think we  can,’” Ive recalled. “And I would know, because I had worked behind his back with  the product teams.” In this and other cases, Jobs came down on Ive’s side.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>有一次，苹果需要为PowerMacG4制作用来固定提手的螺丝。艾弗认为这些螺丝也应该进行抛光和塑形。但鲁宾斯坦认为，这样做的成本将是“天文数字”，而且会将项目推延数周，于是否决了这个想法。他的工作是提供产品，也就意味着有权衡决策的权力。艾弗认为这种做法不利于创新，于是直接越过鲁宾斯坦找到乔布斯，同时还绕过他联系中级工程师。“鲁比会说，不能这么做，会拖延工期。我就说，我觉得可以。”艾弗回忆道，“我也确实知道可以，调为我已经背着他找过产品团队。”在这次和其他事件中，乔布斯都站在艾弗这边。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>At times Ive and  Rubinstein got into arguments that almost led to blows. Finally Ive told Jobs,  “It’s him or me.” Jobs chose Ive. By that point Rubinstein was ready to leave.  He and his wife had bought property in Mexico, and he wanted time off to build  a home there. He eventually went to work for Palm, which was trying to match  Apple’s iPhone. Jobs was so furious that Palm was hiring some of his former  employees that he complained to Bono, who was a cofounder of a private equity  group, led by the former Apple CFO Fred Anderson, that had bought a controlling  stake in Palm. Bono sent Jobs a note back saying, “You should chill out about  this. This is like the Beatles ringing up because Herman and the Hermits have  taken one of their road crew.” Jobs later admitted that he had overreacted.  “The fact that they completely failed salves that wound,” he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>有时，艾弗和鲁宾斯坦互不相让，几乎大打出手。最后，艾弗跟乔布斯说：“选我还是他。”乔布斯选择了艾弗。至此，鲁宾斯坦已经准备离开。他和妻子在墨西哥购置了一处地产，他想休息一段时间，在那儿建造一个家。后来，他进入奔迈公司（Palm）工作，该公司想要与苹果公司的iPhone竞争。对于奔迈公司聘请自己的前员工，乔布斯十分偾怒，开始向波诺抱怨。波诺是一家私人股本集团的联合创始人，该集团由苹果公司前首席财务官弗雷德·安德森掌管，并持有奔迈公司的控股杈。波诺给乔布斯回信道：“你应该淡定点儿。你这样就好像披头士因为赫尔曼的隐士（Herman-sHermits）乐队带走了自己的巡演工作人员而发毛一样。”乔布斯后来承认自己反应过度。“他们的彻底失败减轻了这件事造成的伤害。”他说。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs was able to build  a new management team that was less contentious and a bit more subdued. Its  main players, in addition to Cook and Ive, were Scott Forstall running iPhone  software, Phil Schiller in charge of marketing, Bob Mansfield doing Mac  hardware, Eddy Cue handling Internet services, and Peter Oppenheimer as the  chief financial officer. Even though there was a surface sameness to his top  team—all were middle-aged white males—there was a range of styles. Ive was  emotional and expressive; Cook was as cool as steel. They all knew they were  expected to be deferential to Jobs while also pushing back on his ideas and  being willing to argue—a tricky balance to maintain, but each did it well. “I  realized very early that if you didn’t voice your opinion, he would mow you  down,” said Cook. “He takes contrary positions to create more discussion,  because it may lead to a better result. So if you don’t feel comfortable  disagreeing, then you’ll never survive.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯建立起了一支新的管理团队，争议更少，服从更多。除了库克和艾弗，主要成员还包括：斯科特·福斯托（ScottForstall），运营iPhone软件；菲尔·席勒，负责市场营销；鲍勃·曼斯菲尔德（BobMansfield），制作Mac硬件；埃迪·库埃，处理网络服务I以及彼得·奧本海默（PeterOppenheimer）,担任首席财务官。虽然这一顶级管理团队的成员看似一样——都是中年白人男性，但他们风格各异。艾弗情绪化，富有表现力；库克如钢铁般冷静；他们都知道自己应该对乔布斯恭敬有加，但同时也需要反驳他的想法并乐于与之争论。这个平衡很难拿捏，不过他们都做得很好。库克说：“我很早就意识到，如果你不说出自己的意见，他就会把你赶走。他会采取对立的立场以激发更多讨论，因为这样做可能会带来更好的结果。因此，如果你不习惯反对他的想法，那么就无法在苹果待下去。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The key venue for  freewheeling discourse was the Monday morning executive team gathering, which  started at 9 and went for three or four hours. The focus was always on the  future: What should each product do next? What new things should be developed?  Jobs used the meeting to enforce a sense of shared mission at Apple. This  served to centralize control, which made the company seem as tightly integrated  as a good Apple product, and prevented the struggles between divisions that  plagued decentralized companies.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>自由发表意见的重要场所是每周一上午的管理团队会议，上午9点开始，持续三四个小时。库克会用10分钟作图表展示，说明公司的运转状况，之后大家会就公司的每样产品进行广泛讨论。讨论的重点常常着眼于未来：每款产品接下来该怎么做，应该开发哪些新东西？乔布斯会利用这个会议加强苹果公司的共同使命意识。这种集中式控制，使得苹果公司犹如一个完好的苹果产品那样紧密整合在一起，并且防止了部门之间的斗争，这种斗争令分散式管理的企业陷于窘境。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs also used the  meetings to enforce focus. At Robert Friedland’s farm, his job had been to  prune the apple trees so that they would stay strong, and that became a  metaphor for his pruning at Apple. Instead of encouraging each group to let  product lines proliferate based on marketing considerations, or permitting a  thousand ideas to bloom, Jobs insisted that Apple focus on just two or three  priorities at a time. “There is no one better at turning off the noise that is  going on around him,” Cook said. “That allows him to focus on a few things and  say no to many things. Few people are really good at that.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯还利用这个机会强调公司的焦点所在。当年在罗伯特·弗里德兰的农场，他的工作是给苹果树剪枝，以让它们茁壮成长，这一举动后来成为了他精简苹果公司的隐喻。乔布斯不鼓励每个团队出于营销的考虑增加产品线，也不允许主意满天飞，他坚持苹果公司一次只着重于两三个优先项目。“在无视身边噪音这方面，没有人比乔布斯做得更好。”库克说道，“这样，他就能够集中精力于几件事情上，拒绝其他许多事情。很少有人擅长于这一点。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>In order to  institutionalize the lessons that he and his team were learning, Jobs started  an in-house center called Apple University. He hired Joel Podolny, who was dean  of the Yale School of Management, to compile a series of case studies analyzing  important decisions the company had made, including the switch to the Intel  microprocessor and the decision to open the Apple Stores. Top executives spent  time teaching the cases to new employees, so that the Apple style of decision  making would be embedded in the culture.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>In ancient Rome, when  a victorious general paraded through the streets, legend has it that he was  sometimes trailed by a servant whose job it was to repeat to him, “Memento  mori”: Remember you will die. A reminder of mortality would help the hero keep  things in perspective, instill some humility. Jobs’s memento mori had been  delivered by his doctors, but it did not instill humility. Instead he roared  back after his recovery with even more passion. The illness reminded him that  he had nothing to lose, so he should forge ahead full speed. “He came back on a  mission,” said Cook. “Even though he was now running a large company, he kept  making bold moves that I don’t think anybody else would have done.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>在古罗马，当胜利的将军凯旋时，传说会有一个仆人，在他身边重复“死亡警示”（mementomori）。意思是，记住你终会死亡。必死的警示有助于英雄们正确地看待事物，培养谦逊的性格。乔布斯的死之警示来自医生，但这并未让他谦逊起来。相反，在手术恢复后，他的叫嚷更富激情，生怕自己用来完成使命的时间所剩无多。正如他在斯坦福大学演讲时所说的那样，疾病提醒着自己，已没有什么可失去的，因此他应该全速向前、锐意进取。“他带着一种使命回来了。”库克说，“虽然他现在是在掌管一家大企业，但他不断采取一些大胆的举动，我觉得除了他任何人都不会这么做。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>For a while there was  some evidence, or at least hope, that he had tempered his personal style, that  facing cancer and turning fifty had caused him to be a bit less brutish when he  was upset. “Right after he came back from his operation, he didn’t do the  humiliation bit as much,” Tevanian recalled. “If he was displeased, he might scream  and get hopping mad and use expletives, but he wouldn’t do it in a way that  would totally destroy the person he was talking to. It was just his way to get  the person to do a better job.” Tevanian reflected for a moment as he said  this, then added a caveat: “Unless he thought someone was really bad and had to  go, which happened every once in a while.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>有那么一阵子，有迹象，或者至少有希望表明，乔布斯的个人风格有所缓和，癌症和50岁的来临让他在心烦意乱的时候少了几分粗野。泰瓦尼安回忆说：“手术后刚回到公司的时候，他完全没有耐心。如果他不髙兴，他会冲人大吼大叫，或者怒气冲天地咒骂对方，但是不会做出彻底摧毁对方的举动他那样只是为了让对方做得更好。”泰瓦尼安说完沉思了片刻，然后补充道：“除非他觉得某人真的很差，必须走人，这种情况每过一阵子就会出现。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Eventually, however,  the rough edges returned. Because most of his colleagues were used to it by  then and had learned to cope, what upset them most was when his ire turned on  strangers. “Once we went to a Whole Foods market to get a smoothie,” Ive  recalled. “And this older woman was making it, and he really got on her about  how she was doing it. Then later, he sympathized. ‘She’s an older woman and  doesn’t want to be doing this job.’ He didn’t connect the two. He was being a  purist in both cases.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>然而不管怎样，坏脾气的人毕竟回来了。大多数同事对此早已习惯，而且他们也知道如何应付。最让他们心烦的地方在于，乔布斯的怒气会惹恼陌生人。艾弗回忆说：“有一次我们去全食超市买沙冰，做沙冰的是个年纪比较大的女人，乔布斯抱怨她做沙冰的方式，把对方搞得很烦。后来他又很同情那个女人，说‘她年纪比较大，也不想做这种工作。’他根本就没有把这两件事联系起来，一副全然与此无关的样子。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>On a trip to London  with Jobs, Ive had the thankless task of choosing the hotel. He picked the  Hempel, a tranquil five-star boutique hotel with a sophisticated minimalism  that he thought Jobs would love. But as soon as they checked in, he braced  himself, and sure enough his phone rang a minute later. “I hate my room,” Jobs  declared. “It’s a piece of shit, let’s go.” So Ive gathered his luggage and  went to the front desk, where Jobs bluntly told the shocked clerk what he  thought. Ive realized that most people, himself among them, tend not to be  direct when they feel something is shoddy because they want to be liked, “which  is actually a vain trait.” That was an overly kind explanation. In any case, it  was not a trait Jobs had.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>在与乔布斯的一次伦敦之行中，艾弗负责挑选酒店，这是份吃力不讨好的差使。他最终选择了亨佩尔酒店（TheHempel），这是一家静谧的五星级精品酒店，有着精致的极简主义风格，艾弗觉得乔布斯会喜欢。然而刚一登记入住，艾弗就打起精神，准备迎接乔布斯的责难，果然，一分钟后电话响了。“我讨厌这房间，”乔布斯说道，“狗屎一样，我们走。”于是，艾弗拿上自己的行李，来到前台。面对一脸惊愕的服务员，乔布斯直截了当地说明了自己的想法。艾弗意识到，包括他自己在内的大多数人，如果觉得某样东西很拙劣，通常不会直接说出来，因为不愿招人厌恶，“这其实是一种虚荣的性格。”这种解释过于宽容。不管怎么说，乔布斯没有这种特质。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Because Ive was so  instinctively nice, he puzzled over why Jobs, whom he deeply liked, behaved as  he did. One evening, in a San Francisco bar, he leaned forward with an earnest  intensity and tried to analyze it:</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>艾弗天性善良，因此很困惑乔布斯这样一个让他深深喜爱的人，为什么会有这种行为。一天傍晚，在旧金山一间酒吧里，他俯下身来，认真地向我分析了这一点：</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>He’s  a very, very sensitive guy. That’s one of the things that makes his antisocial  behavior, his rudeness, so unconscionable. I can understand why people who are  thick-skinned and unfeeling can be rude, but not sensitive people. I once asked  him why he gets so mad about stuff. He said, “But I don’t stay mad.” He has  this very childish ability to get really worked up about something, and it  doesn’t stay with him at all. But there are other times, I think honestly, when  he’s very frustrated, and his way to achieve catharsis is to hurt somebody. And  I think he feels he has a liberty and a license to do that. The normal rules of  social engagement, he feels, don’t apply to him. Because of how very sensitive  he is, he knows exactly how to efficiently and effectively hurt someone. And he  does do that.</p>
  <p>Every now and then a  wise colleague would pull Jobs aside to try to get him to settle down. Lee Clow  was a master. “Steve, can I talk to you?” he would quietly say when Jobs had  belittled someone publicly. He would go into Jobs’s office and explain how hard  everyone was working. “When you humiliate them, it’s more debilitating than  stimulating,” he said in one such session. Jobs would apologize and say he  understood. But then he would lapse again. “It’s simply who I am,” he would  say.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p><p>他是个非常非常敏感的人。这就是他有反社会行为、粗鲁和如此肆无忌惮的原因之一。我明白脸皮厚和绝情的人为什么会很扭鲁，但是我不明白敏感的人为什么也会这样。有一次我问他，为什么会对一些事情如此生气。他回答说：“但是我没有一直生气。”他就是有这种非常孩子气的特点，会为某些事情格外较真儿，但又不会一直这样。但是说真的，也有另一些时候，他非常沮丧的时候，他的宣泄方式就是去伤害别人。我觉得，他认为自己有这样做的自由，社交的正常规则并不适用于他。因为他非常敏感，也清楚地知道如何能够真正地伤害某人。他也碥实会这样做，但并不经常如此，只是偶尔。</p>
<p>乔布斯失控时，经常会有一个聪明的同事把他拉到一边，让他平静下来。李·克劳便是个中髙手。“史蒂夫，我能跟你谈谈吗？”他会在乔布斯公开贬低别人时轻声说道。克劳会走进乔布斯的办公室，向他解释大家是如何努力工作的。有一回，克劳说：“你羞辱别人，只会让对方变弱，而起不到激励作用。”这时，乔布斯就会道歉，说自己明白了。但是之后，他还是老样子。“我就是这样。”他会这样说。</p></div></div>

<p>One thing that did  mellow was his attitude toward Bill Gates. Microsoft had kept its end of the  bargain it made in 1997, when it agreed to continue developing great software  for the Macintosh. Also, it was becoming less relevant as a competitor, having  failed thus far to replicate Apple’s digital hub strategy. Gates and Jobs had  very different approaches to products and innovation, but their rivalry had  produced in each a surprising self-awareness.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>然而，在对比尔·盖茨的态度上，乔布斯确实更加成熟了。1997年，微软曾同意继续为麦金塔电脑幵发优秀的软件，但一直谈判未果。此外，微软一直以来在复制苹果公司的数字中枢战略上都失败了，这也弱化了作为苹果竞争对手的身份。盖茨和乔布斯在产品和创新上采用了截然不同的方式，而两人之间的竞争也给彼此带来了惊人的自我意识。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>For their All Things  Digital conference in May 2007, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> columnists Walt  Mossberg and Kara Swisher worked to get them together for a joint interview.  Mossberg first invited Jobs, who didn’t go to many such conferences, and was  surprised when he said he would do it if Gates would. On hearing that, Gates  accepted as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p><p>2007年5月的数字大会（AllThingsDigital）上，《华尔街日报》的专栏作家沃尔特·莫斯伯格和卡拉·斯威舍（KamSwisher）努力想让盖茨和乔布斯接受一次联合采访。莫斯伯格先邀请了乔布斯，乔布斯并不经常参加这样的会议，他表示如果盖茨去自己就会去，这令莫斯伯格感到惊讶。听闻此事后，盖茨也接受了采访邀请。</p>

<p>但是，《新闻周刊》对盖茨的采访差点儿令该计划搁浅。该周刊的记者斯蒂芬·列维就苹果公司的“Mac对决PC”电视广告发问时，盖茨爆发了——该系列广告拿Windows用户开涮，将其塑造成十足的笨蛋，而将Mac描绘成新潮的产品。“我不明白他们为什么要表现得自己高人一等的样子，”盖茨说道，情绪越来越激动，“诚实在这些广告里不重要吗？或者，就算你真的很酷，是不是就意味着能随心所欲地撒谎？这里面一丝一毫的事实都没有。”列维又火上浇油，询问新的Windows操作系统Vista是否抄袭了Mac的许多特性。“如果你真的关心事实，可以自己去查一下，看看到底是谁先展现出这些东西的，”盖茨回应道，“如果你只是想说，‘史蒂夫·乔布斯造出了世界，我们其他人只是跟着他亦步亦趋’，那随便你。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Mossberg wanted the  evening joint appearance to be a cordial discussion, not a debate, but that  seemed less likely when Jobs unleashed a swipe at Microsoft during a solo  interview earlier that day. Asked about the fact that Apple’s iTunes software  for Windows computers was extremely popular, Jobs joked, “It’s like giving a  glass of ice water to somebody in hell.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯打电话给莫斯伯格表示，鉴于盖茨在《新闻周刊》采访中所说的话，进行联合采访没什么意义。但是莫斯伯格成功将事情扳回芷轨。他希望这一晚间联合采访是一次亲切友好的讨论，而不是辩论会。但是当天早些时候，乔布斯单独接受莫斯伯格采访时，对微软进行了猛烈抨击，莫斯伯格的希望似乎要落空了。当提及苹果公司为Windows电脑制作的iTunes软件非常受欢迎时，乔布斯开玩笑说：“这就像是往地狱里的某人身上浇冰水一样。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>So when it was time  for Gates and Jobs to meet in the green room before their joint session that  evening, Mossberg was worried. Gates got there first, with his aide Larry  Cohen, who had briefed him about Jobs’s remark earlier that day. When Jobs  ambled in a few minutes later, he grabbed a bottle of water from the ice bucket  and sat down. After a moment or two of silence, Gates said, “So I guess I’m the  representative from hell.” He wasn’t smiling. Jobs paused, gave him one of his  impish grins, and handed him the ice water. Gates relaxed, and the tension  dissipated.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>当晚的联合采访开始前，乔布斯和盖茨会在嘉宾休息室里见面，莫斯伯格很担心。盖茨与助手拉里·科恩（LarryCohen）先到达，科恩之前已经向盖茨简要汇报了乔布斯的评论。几分钟后，乔布斯缓步走了进来，从冰桶里拿出一瓶水，坐了下来。片刻沉默之后，盖茨开口了，脸上全无笑意，“我猜我就是那个地狱里的人。”乔布斯顿了一下，露出了自己招牌式的顽皮微笑，把冰水递给了盖茨。盖茨情绪有所缓和，紧张的气氛一扫而光。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The result was a  fascinating duet, in which each wunderkind of the digital age spoke warily, and  then warmly, about the other. Most memorably they gave candid answers when the  technology strategist Lise Buyer, who was in the audience, asked what each had  learned from observing the other. “Well, I’d give a lot to have Steve’s taste,”  Gates answered. There was a bit of nervous laughter; Jobs had famously said,  ten years earlier, that his problem with Microsoft was that it had absolutely  no taste. But Gates insisted he was serious. Jobs was a “natural in terms of  intuitive taste.” He recalled how he and Jobs used to sit together reviewing  the software that Microsoft was making for the Macintosh. “I’d see Steve make  the decision based on a sense of people and product that, you know, is hard for  me to explain. The way he does things is just different and I think it’s  magical. And in that case, wow.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>这次联合采访最终成为两人之间的精彩对话，两位数字时代的天才谨慎进而热情地谈论彼此。最令人印象深刻的是，当坐在观众席的技术战略家丽丝·拜尔（LiseBuyer）提问，两人从对方身上学到了什么时，他们给出了直率的回答。“好吧,我愿意放弃很多东西来拥有史蒂夫的品位。”盖茨回答道。现场爆发一阵笑声，气氛有些紧张；十年前，乔布斯曾说过一句话，他不满意微软是因为它完全没有品位。但是盖茨坚称自己说这话是认真的，乔布斯的“直觉品位是与生俱来的，无论是对人还是产品”。他回忆起自己和乔布斯当年坐在一起，检查微软为麦金塔开发的软件。“史蒂夫能够根据对人和产品的感觉作出决定，你们懂的，对我来说这甚至很难解释清楚。他做事的方式非常不同寻常，我认为很神奇。既然如此，我也只能感叹‘哇’。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs stared at the  floor. Later he told me that he was blown away by how honest and gracious Gates  had just been. Jobs was equally honest, though not quite as gracious, when his  turn came. He described the great divide between the Apple theology of building  end-to-end integrated products and Microsoft’s openness to licensing its  software to competing hardware makers. In the music market, the integrated  approach, as manifested in his iTunes-iPod package, was proving to be the  better, he noted, but Microsoft’s decoupled approach was faring better in the  personal computer market. One question he raised in an offhand way was: Which  approach might work better for mobile phones?</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯盯着地板。他后来对我说，盖茨的诚实和风度让他震动。轮到乔布斯回答时，他也一样诚实，尽管并非像盖茨那样有风度。他描述了苹果和微软的理念鸿沟，苹果欲打造端到端一体化的产品，微软则将自己的软件开放授权给彼此竞争的硬件厂商。他指出，在音乐市场，集成的做法更好，这个已经有iTunes/iPod组合可以证明，伹是在个人电脑市场，微软的分离政策发展得更好。这番话随即引出了一个潜在的问题：在手机市场，哪种方法会更好？</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Then he went on to  make an insightful point: This difference in design philosophy, he said, led  him and Apple to be less good at collaborating with other companies. “Because  Woz and I started the company based on doing the whole banana, we weren’t so  good at partnering with people,” he said. “And I think if Apple could have had  a little more of that in its DNA, it would have served it extremely well.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p><!--中文-->
接着，他提出了一个精辟的观点。在设计理念上的差异导致他及苹果公司更不善于同其他公司合作。“因为沃兹和我创办公司的时候，所有东西都是自己在做，因此我们不是很善于与人合作，”他说道，“我认为，如果苹果天生能够多一点点合作精神，会非常好。”
