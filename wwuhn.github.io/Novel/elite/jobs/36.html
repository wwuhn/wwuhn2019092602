<div class="left"><h3>An iPod That Makes Calls</h3>
<p>By 2005 iPod sales  were skyrocketing. An astonishing twenty million were sold that year, quadruple  the number of the year before. The product was becoming more important to the  company’s bottom line, accounting for 45% of the revenue that year, and it was  also burnishing the hipness of the company’s image in a way that drove sales of  Macs.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><h3>可以打电话的iPod</h3>

<p>至2005年，iPod销量暴涨，当年售出2000万台，数量惊人，是2004年销量的4倍。该产品对于苹果公司的营收越发重要，占当年收入的45%。同时，iPod还带动了Mac系列产品的销售，为苹果公司塑造出时髦的企业形象。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>That is why Jobs was  worried. “He was always obsessing about what could mess us up,” board member  Art Levinson recalled. The conclusion he had come to: “The device that can eat  our lunch is the cell phone.” As he explained to the board, the digital camera  market was being decimated now that phones were equipped with cameras. The same  could happen to the iPod, if phone manufacturers started to build music players  into them. “Everyone carries a phone, so that could render the iPod  unnecessary.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>而这也是乔布斯担忧的地方。“他总在担心有什么会让我们陷入困境。”苹果公司董事会成员亚瑟·莱文森回忆道。乔布斯得出结论：“能抢我们饭碗的设备是手机。”他向董事会说明，手机都开始配备摄像头，数码相机市场正急剧萎缩。同样的情况也可能发生在iPod身上，如果手机制造商开始在手机中内置音乐播放器。“每个人都随身带着手机，就没必要买iPod了。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>His first strategy was  to do something that he had admitted in front of Bill Gates was not in his DNA:  to partner with another company. He began talking to Ed Zander, the new CEO of  Motorola, about making a companion to Motorola’s popular RAZR, which was a cell  phone and digital camera, that would have an iPod built in. Thus was born the  ROKR. </p>

<p>It ended up having neither the enticing minimalism of an iPod nor the  convenient slimness of a RAZR. Ugly, difficult to load, and with an arbitrary hundred-song  limit, it had all the hallmarks of a product that had been negotiated by a  committee, which was counter to the way Jobs liked to work. Instead of  hardware, software, and content all being controlled by one company, they were  cobbled together by Motorola, Apple, and the wireless carrier Cingular. “You  call this the phone of the future?” <em>Wired</em> scoffed on its November 2005  cover.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p><p>乔布斯曾当着比尔·盖茨的面承认自己天生不善于合作，而此刻，他的第一个策略就是与另一家公司合作。摩托罗拉公司新任CEO埃德·赞德和他是朋友，于是，乔布斯开始商议与摩托罗拉的畅销手机刀锋（RAZR）系列合作。该系列手机配有摄像头，双方准备合作，在其中内置iPod。摩托罗拉ROKR手机就此诞生。</p>

<p>但是，该系列手机既没有iPod迷人的极简风格，也没有刀锋系列便捷的超薄造型。它外观丑陋，下载困难，只能容纳近百首歌曲。这是典型的委员会讨论之下形成的产品，与乔布斯喜欢的工作方式相悖。RAZR系列手机的硬件、软件和内容并非由同一家公司控制，而是由摩托罗拉公司、苹果公司及无线运营商辛格勒（Cingular）共同拼凑而成。《连线》杂志在其2005年11月号的封面上嘲讽道：“你们管这叫未来的手机？”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs was furious. “I’m  sick of dealing with these stupid companies like Motorola,” he told Tony Fadell  and others at one of the iPod product review meetings. “Let’s do it ourselves.”  He had noticed something odd about the cell phones on the market: They all  stank, just like portable music players used to. “We would sit around talking  about how much we hated our phones,” he recalled. “They were way too  complicated. They had features nobody could figure out, including the address  book. It was just Byzantine.” George Riley, an outside lawyer for Apple,  remembers sitting at meetings to go over legal issues, and Jobs would get bored,  grab Riley’s mobile phone, and start pointing out all the ways it was  “brain-dead.” So Jobs and his team became excited about the prospect of  building a phone that they would want to use. “That’s the best motivator of  all,” Jobs later said.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯怒不可遏。在一次iPod产品评述会议上，他对托尼·法德尔及其他人说：“我受够了跟摩托罗拉这些愚蠢的公司打交道。我们自己来。”他注意到市场上手机的奇怪之处：他们都很烂，就像以前的便携式音乐播放器一样。“我们会坐在一起谈论有多么讨厌自己的手机，”他回忆说，“它们太复杂，有些功能没人能槁明白，包括通讯簿。简直就跟拜占庭一样混乱不堪。”律师乔治·莱利还记得自己当时坐在会议室里检查法律问题，乔布斯觉得厌烦了，于是拿起莱利的手机，历数各类缺陷，指出这完全就是“脑残”设计。乔布斯及其团队十分兴奋，因为他们看到了打造一款自己想用的手机的前景。“这是最好的动力。”乔布斯后来说道。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Another motivator was  the potential market. More than 825 million mobile phones were sold in 2005, to  everyone from grammar schoolers to grandmothers. Since most were junky, there  was room for a premium and hip product, just as there had been in the portable  music-player market. At first he gave the project to the Apple group that was  making the AirPort wireless base station, on the theory that it was a wireless  product. But he soon realized that it was basically a consumer device, like the  iPod, so he reassigned it to Fadell and his teammates.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>另一个动力是潜在的市场。2005年，全球手机销量超过8.25亿部，消费者从小学生直至上了年纪的祖母。由于大多数手机都很烂，因此一款优质时髦的手机会有市场空间，就像之前在便携式音乐播放器市场一样。起初，乔布斯把这个项目交给了研发AirPort无线基站的团队，理由是该手机是一款无线产品。但是他很快意识到，这实际上是一款消费类电子设备，和iPod—样，于是又将该项目重新分配给法德尔及其团队。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Their initial approach  was to modify the iPod. They tried to use the trackwheel as a way for a user to  scroll through phone options and, without a keyboard, try to enter numbers. It  was not a natural fit. “We were having a lot of problems using the wheel,  especially in getting it to dial phone numbers,” Fadell recalled. “It was  cumbersome.” It was fine for scrolling through an address book, but horrible at  inputting anything. The team kept trying to convince themselves that users would  mainly be calling people who were already in their address book, but they knew  that it wouldn’t really work.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>他们最初设想在iPod的基础上制作一款手机，让使用者用滚轮选择手机功能，并且不用键盘就能输入数字。但这样的设计并不自然。“使用滚轮有很多问题，尤其是拨号的时候法德尔回忆说，“会很麻烦。”用滚轮浏览通讯簿很方便，但是想输入点儿什么就很不方便。团队一直在努力让自己相信，人们的电话主要是打给已经存储在通讯簿里的人，但是他们知道，这样其实是行不通的。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>At that time there was  a second project under way at Apple: a secret effort to build a tablet  computer. In 2005 these narratives intersected, and the ideas for the tablet  flowed into the planning for the phone. In other words, the idea for the iPad  actually came before, and helped to shape, the birth of the iPhone.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>当时，苹果还有一个项目处于进行中：秘密打造一款平板电脑。2005年，项目组之间互相交流后，平板电脑的理念融入了手机计划之中。换言之，iPad的想法实际上先于iPhone出现，并且帮助塑造了iPhone。</p></div></div>
 

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><h3><a name="s2" id="s2"></a>Multi-touch</h3> </p>
<p>One of the engineers  developing a tablet PC at Microsoft was married to a friend of Laurene and  Steve Jobs, and for his fiftieth birthday he wanted to have a dinner party that  included them along with Bill and Melinda Gates. Jobs went, a bit reluctantly.  “Steve was actually quite friendly to me at the dinner,” Gates recalled, but he  “wasn’t particularly friendly” to the birthday guy.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><h3>多点触控</h3>
<p>乔布斯夫妇有一位朋友的丈夫是微软的工程师，当时在进行平板电脑的研发。这位工程师50岁生日时举办了一场晚宴，邀请乔布斯夫妇和盖茨夫妇出席。乔布斯有些不情愿地去了。“其实史蒂夫那天晚上对我挺友好，”盖茨回忆说，但却对寿星“不是特别友好”。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Gates was annoyed that  the guy kept revealing information about the tablet PC he had developed for  Microsoft. “He’s our employee and he’s revealing our intellectual property,”  Gates recounted. Jobs was also annoyed, and it had just the consequence that  Gates feared. As Jobs recalled:</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>那位工程师不停地透露微软平板电脑的情况，这让盖茨很恼火。“他是我们的员工，掌握着我们的知识产杈。”盖茨回忆道。乔布斯同样很恼火，盖茨担心会引发自己不想看到的后果，他的担心成真了。乔布斯回忆道：</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>This  guy badgered me about how Microsoft was going to completely change the world  with this tablet PC software and eliminate all notebook computers, and Apple  ought to license his Microsoft software. But he was doing the device all wrong.  It had a stylus. As soon as you have a stylus, you’re dead. This dinner was  like the tenth time he talked to me about it, and I was so sick of it that I  came home and said, “Fuck this, let’s show him what a tablet can really be.”</p>
  <p>Jobs went into the  office the next day, gathered his team, and said, “I want to make a tablet, and  it can’t have a keyboard or a stylus.” Users would be able to type by touching  the screen with their fingers. That meant the screen needed to have a feature  that became known as multi-touch, the ability to process multiple inputs at the  same time. “So could you guys come up with a multi-touch, touch-sensitive  display for me?” he asked. It took them about six months, but they came up with  a crude but workable prototype.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p><p>这个家伙缠着我说，微软这款平板电脑软件将如何彻底改变世界，淘汰所有的笔记本电脑，苹果应该使用他开发的微软软件。但是他设计的这个产品完全错了。就是因为配有一支手写笔，而只要有手写笔，这产品就废了。晚宴上他跟我说了近十遍这些玩意儿5我都烦死了，回到家我就说：“去他妈的，让我们告诉他真正的平板电脑应该是什么样。”</p>
<p>第二天，乔布斯一来到公司就召集自己的团队说：“我要做一款平板电脑，不要键盘和手写笔。”用户能够通过手指触摸屏幕输入，这意味着，平板电脑的屏幕需要使用一种被乔布斯形容为“多点触控”（multi-touch）的技术，能够在同一时间处理多个输入。“你们能做出一个多点触控、反应灵敏的样品给我吗？”他问道。团队成员花了6个月左右时间，做出了一个粗糙但可行的样机。乔布斯把样机交给了苹果公司另一位用户界面设计师，一个月后，这位设计师建议增加卷页功能——让用户能够轻扫屏幕移动图像，就像在实际生活中移动一张照片一样。乔布斯回忆说：“我很喜欢这个想法。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jony Ive had a different  memory of how multi-touch was developed. He said his design team had already  been working on a multi-touch input that was developed for the trackpads of  Apple’s MacBook Pro, and they were experimenting with ways to transfer that  capability to a computer screen. They used a projector to show on a wall what  it would look like. “This is going to change everything,” Ive told his team.  But he was careful not to show it to Jobs right away, especially since his  people were working on it in their spare time and he didn’t want to quash their  enthusiasm. “Because Steve is so quick to give an opinion, I don’t show him  stuff in front of other people,” Ive recalled. “He might say, ‘This is shit,’  and snuff the idea. I feel that ideas are very fragile, so you have to be  tender when they are in development. I realized that if he pissed on this, it  would be so sad, because I knew it was so important.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>但在乔尼·艾弗的记忆中，多点触控技术的研发不是这样来的。他说，当时自己的设计团队已经在为苹果MacBookPro的触控板研发多点触控输入技术，他们还多方实验，试图将这种技术移至电脑屏幕。他们还用投影仪在墙上演示了这项技术。艾弗对团队成员说：“这将改变一切。”但他很谨慎，没有立即展示给乔布斯。由于团队是在业余时间研发这项技术，因此他不想打击大家的积极性。“因为史蒂夫会很快给出意见，所以我不会在有别人在场的时候向他展示东西，”艾弗回忆说，“他可能会说，‘这就是一堆狗屎’，然后打消掉我们的想法。我觉得这些想法还很脆弱，还处在孕育之中，需要温柔对待。如果他对此不屑一顾，那就太可惜了，因为我知道这项技术很重要。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Ive set up the  demonstration in his conference room and showed it to Jobs privately, knowing  that he was less likely to make a snap judgment if there was no audience.  Fortunately he loved it. “This is the future,” he exulted.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>于是，艾弗选择在自己的会议室里私下向乔布斯展示团队的想法。他知道，在没有观众的情况下，乔布斯不大会作出草率的判断。幸运的是，他很喜欢这项技术。“这就是未来。”乔布斯高兴地说。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>It was in fact such a  good idea that Jobs realized that it could solve the problem they were having  creating an interface for the proposed cell phone. That project was far more  important, so he put the tablet development on hold while the multi-touch  interface was adopted for a phone-size screen. “If it worked on a phone,” he  recalled, “I knew we could go back and use it on a tablet.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>事实上，这个主意非常好，乔布斯意识到，可以用它解决手机界面的问题。由于手机项目更为重要，于是乔布斯暂时搁置了平板电脑的研发，将多点触控界面用于手机大小的屏幕上。“如果能用在手机上，”他回忆说，“那么我就知道，我们还能再回过头来把这个技术用在平板电脑上。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs called Fadell,  Rubinstein, and Schiller to a secret meeting in the design studio conference  room, where Ive gave a demonstration of multi-touch. “Wow!” said Fadell.  Everyone liked it, but they were not sure that they would be able to make it  work on a mobile phone. They decided to proceed on two paths: P1 was the code  name for the phone being developed using an iPod trackwheel, and P2 was the new  alternative using a multi-touch screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯召集法德尔、鲁宾斯坦和席勒前往设计部门的会议室，进行秘密会议，艾弗在会上演示了多点触控技术。法德尔不禁惊呼“哇”，每个人都喜欢这项技术，但是还不确定能否在手机设备上予以实现。他们决定兵分两路：一组人马研发滚轮手机，代号P1；另一组人马研发多点触摸屏手机，代号P2。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>A small company in  Delaware called FingerWorks was already making a line of multi-touch trackpads.  Founded by two academics at the University of Delaware, John Elias and Wayne  Westerman, FingerWorks had developed some tablets with multi-touch sensing  capabilities and taken out patents on ways to translate various finger  gestures, such as pinches and swipes, into useful functions. In early 2005  Apple quietly acquired the company, all of its patents, and the services of its  two founders. FingerWorks quit selling its products to others, and it began  filing its new patents in Apple’s name.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>特拉华州一家小企业FingerWorks已经制作出一系列多点触控板。该公司的创始人约翰·埃利亚斯（JohnElias）和韦恩·韦斯特曼（WayneWestermen）是美国特拉华大学的学者。FingerWorks公司已经研发出具有多点触控功能的平板电脑，并申请专利，保护自己将手指动作转化为有用功能的技术，如触控缩放和滑动浏览。2005年初，苹果公司悄悄收购了该公司及其全部专利，两位创始人也受雇于苹果。FingerWorks不再将其产品销售给他人，并将新专利归入苹果公司名下。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>After six months of  work on the trackwheel P1 and the multi-touch P2 phone options, Jobs called his  inner circle into his conference room to make a decision. Fadell had been  trying hard to develop the trackwheel model, but he admitted they had not  cracked the problem of figuring out a simple way to dial calls. The multi-touch  approach was riskier, because they were unsure whether they could execute the  engineering, but it was also more exciting and promising. “We all know this is  the one we want to do,” said Jobs, pointing to the touchscreen. “So let’s make  it work.” It was what he liked to call a bet-the-company moment, high risk and  high reward if it succeeded.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>滚轮P1项目和多点触控P2项目进行了6个月后，乔布斯把核心圈子成员召至自己的会议室，进行最终抉择。法德尔一直以来都在努力研发滚轮模型，但他承认团队还未找出简单的拨号方式。多点触控方案风险更髙，因为不确定能否将其工程化，但是该方案也更激动人心，更有前景。“我们都知道，这就是我们想做的东西乔布斯意指触摸屏，“那么，就让我们实现它吧。”这就是他所谓的拿公司一搏的时刻，风险高，但如果成功了，回报也髙。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>A couple of members of  the team argued for having a keyboard as well, given the popularity of the  BlackBerry, but Jobs vetoed the idea. A physical keyboard would take away space  from the screen, and it would not be as flexible and adaptable as a touchscreen  keyboard. “A hardware keyboard seems like an easy solution, but it’s  constraining,” he said. “Think of all the innovations we’d be able to adapt if  we did the keyboard onscreen with software. Let’s bet on it, and then we’ll  find a way to make it work.” The result was a device that displays a numerical  pad when you want to dial a phone number, a typewriter keyboard when you want  to write, and whatever buttons you might need for each particular activity. And  then they all disappear when you’re watching a video. By having software  replace hardware, the interface became fluid and flexible.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>考虑到黑莓手机的流行，几位团队成员主张配备键盘，但乔布斯否决了这种想法。物理键盘会占用屏幕空间，而且不如触摸屏键盘灵活、适应性强。“物理键盘似乎是个简单的解决方案，但是会有局限，”乔布斯说道，“如果我们能用软件把键盘放在屏幕上，那你想想，我们能在这个基础上作多少创新。赌一把吧，我们会找到可行的方法。”最后，产品出来了，如果你想拨号，屏幕会显示数字键盘；想写东西，调出打字键盘。每种特定的活动都有对应的按钮可以满足需求，但当用户观赏视频时，这些键盘都会消失。软件取代硬件，使得界面流畅而灵活。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs spent part of  every day for six months helping to refine the display. “It was the most  complex fun I’ve ever had,” he recalled. “It was like being the one evolving  the variations on ‘Sgt. Pepper.’” A lot of features that seem simple now were  the result of creative brainstorms. For example, the team worried about how to  prevent the device from playing music or making a call accidentally when it was  jangling in your pocket. Jobs was congenitally averse to having on-off  switches, which he deemed “inelegant.” The solution was “Swipe to Open,” the  simple and fun on-screen slider that activated the device when it had gone  dormant. Another breakthrough was the sensor that figured out when you put the  phone to your ear, so that your lobes didn’t accidentally activate some function.  And of course the icons came in his favorite shape, the primitive he made Bill  Atkinson design into the software of the first Macintosh: rounded rectangles.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯花了半年时间协助完善屏幕显示。“这是我所拥有过最复杂的乐趣，”他回忆说，“就像参与到《佩珀中士》变奏曲中一样。”很多现在看似简单的功能，都是当时创意头脑风暴的结果。例如；手机团队担心手机放在口袋里不小心碰到会播放音乐或拨号，他们就会思考如何解决这个问题。乔布斯打心眼儿里讨厌开关切换，他觉得这样“不优美”。解决方案是“滑过打开”，屏幕上简单有趣的滑块，用来激活处于休眠中的机器。另一个突破是，在用户打电话的时候，传感器能够作出判断，不会认为是手指在进行操作，从而避免出现耳朵意外激活某些功能的问题。当然，图标都是按照乔布斯最喜爱的形状进行设计的，这是比尔·阿特金森为第一款麦金塔电脑设计的软件形状：圆角矩形。</p></div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">


<p>In session after session, with Jobs immersed in every detail, the team members  figured out ways to simplify what other phones made complicated. They added a  big bar to guide you in putting calls on hold or making conference calls, found  easy ways to navigate through email, and created icons you could scroll through  horizontally to get to different apps—all of which were easier because they  could be used visually on the screen rather than by using a keyboard built into  the hardware.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>会议一个接一个，乔布斯参与到每个细节的讨论之中，团队成员们成功想出简化手机其他复杂功能的方法。他们添加了一个大指示条，用户可以选择保持通话或进行电话会议；找到了一种浏览电子邮件的简单方法；创造了能够横向滚动的图标，用户可以选择启动不同的应用程序。这些改进使得手机更加易于使用，因为用户可以直观地在屏幕上进行操作，而无需使用物理键盘。</p></div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><h3><a name="s3" id="s3"></a>Gorilla Glass</h3> </p>
<p>Jobs became infatuated  with different materials the way he did with certain foods. When he went back  to Apple in 1997 and started work on the iMac, he had embraced what could be  done with translucent and colored plastic. The next phase was metal. He and Ive  replaced the curvy plastic PowerBook G3 with the sleek titanium PowerBook G4,  which they redesigned two years later in aluminum, as if just to demonstrate  how much they liked different metals. Then they did an iMac and an iPod Nano in  anodized aluminum, which meant that the metal had been put in an acid bath and  electrified so that its surface oxidized. Jobs was told it could not be done in  the quantities they needed, so he had a factory built in China to handle it.  Ive went there, during the SARS epidemic, to oversee the process. “I stayed for  three months in a dormitory to work on the process,” he recalled. “Ruby and  others said it would be impossible, but I wanted to do it because Steve and I  felt that the anodized aluminum had a real integrity to it.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><h3>金刚玻璃</h3>

<p>乔布斯很喜欢在做一样东西时尝试用不同材料，就像他对待某些食物时那样。1997年，他回归苹果后，开始着手制造iMac，用半透明和彩色塑料做出了漂亮的产品。接下来是金属，他和艾弗用光滑的钛板制作出PowerBookG3,淘汰了塑料外壳的PowerBookG3,两年后又用铝制材料对该款电脑进行了重新设计，似乎只为了证明他们非常喜欢尝试不同的材料。之后，阳极电镀铝板被用在了iMac和iPodNano上，这种材料是将铝进行酸浴和电镀，使其表面氧化。乔布斯得知这种材料的产量达不到他们的需要后，就在中国兴建了一家工厂进行生产。非典期间，艾弗前往该厂监督流程。“我在宿舍里住了3个月，改进流程，”他回忆道，“鲁比和其他人认为不可能做到，但是我想做，因为乔布斯和我都觉得阳极电镀铝能够真正让产品完美起来。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Next was glass. “After  we did metal, I looked at Jony and said that we had to master glass,” said  Jobs. For the Apple stores, they had created huge windowpanes and glass stairs.  For the iPhone, the original plan was for it to have a plastic screen, like the  iPod. But Jobs decided it would feel much more elegant and substantive if the  screens were glass. So he set about finding a glass that would be strong and  resistant to scratches.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>再接下来是玻璃。“在搞定金属材质后，我看着乔尼说，我们必须掌握玻璃材质的使用。”乔布斯说道。在苹果店，他们做出了巨大的玻璃窗和玻璃楼梯。而对于iPhone，苹果公司原计划像iPod—样，使用塑料屏幕。但是，乔布斯认为玻璃屏幕会更好，感觉更优雅实在。于是，他开始寻找结实耐划的玻璃。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The natural place to  look was Asia, where the glass for the stores was being made. But Jobs’s friend  John Seeley Brown, who was on the board of Corning Glass in Upstate New York,  told him that he should talk to that company’s young and dynamic CEO, Wendell  Weeks. So he dialed the main Corning switchboard number and asked to be put  through to Weeks. He got an assistant, who offered to pass along the message.  “No, I’m Steve Jobs,” he replied. “Put me through.” The assistant refused. Jobs  called Brown and complained that he had been subjected to “typical East Coast  bullshit.” When Weeks heard that, he called the main Apple switchboard and  asked to speak to Jobs. He was told to put his request in writing and send it  in by fax. When Jobs was told what happened, he took a liking to Weeks and  invited him to Cupertino.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>很自然地，他们将眼光投入了亚洲，苹果店的玻璃就产自那里。但是乔布斯的朋友约翰·西利·布朗（JohnSeeleyBrewn）建议他先同温德尔·威克斯（WendellWeeks）谈谈。威克斯是位于纽约北部的康宁公司（ComingGlass）的CEO,年轻而充满活力；布朗是该公司的董事会成员。于是，乔布斯拨通了康宁公司的总机，报上了自己的名字，说想要同威克斯通话。威克斯的助理接了电话，说会把电话内容转达给威克斯。“不，我是史蒂夫·乔布斯，”他回答说，“叫他接电话。”助理拒绝了。乔布斯打电话给布朗，抱怨自己遭遇了“典型的东海岸那一套”。威克斯听说此事以后，打到了苹果公司总机，表示要与乔布斯通话。结果总机要求他写下自己的请求传真过来。乔布斯得知以后，喜欢上了威克斯，并邀请他来到库比蒂诺。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs described the  type of glass Apple wanted for the iPhone, and Weeks told him that Corning had  developed a chemical exchange process in the 1960s that led to what they dubbed  “gorilla glass.” It was incredibly strong, but it had never found a market, so  Corning quit making it. <p>Jobs said he doubted it was good enough, and he started  explaining to Weeks how glass was made. This amused Weeks, who of course knew  more than Jobs about that topic. “Can you shut up,” Weeks interjected, “and let  me teach you some science?” Jobs was taken aback and fell silent. Weeks went to  the whiteboard and gave a tutorial on the chemistry, which involved an  ion-exchange process that produced a compression layer on the surface of the  glass. This turned Jobs around, and he said he wanted as much gorilla glass as  Corning could make within six months. “We don’t have the capacity,” Weeks  replied. “None of our plants make the glass now.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p><p>乔布斯向威克斯描述了自己想为iPhone寻找的玻璃类型，威克斯告诉他，康宁公司在20世纪60年代就研发出一种化学交换过程，能够做出一种被他们称为“金刚玻璃”的材料。这种玻璃非常结实，但当时找不到市场，于是就停产了。</p>
<p>乔布斯怀疑他们的玻璃不够好，开始解释玻璃是如何制成的。威克斯被逗乐了，因为在这个话题上，他可比乔布斯在行得多。“你能闭嘴吗，”威克斯插话道，“让我来给你讲讲科学好吗？”乔布斯吃了一惊，陷入沉默。威克斯走到白板前，开始讲解金刚玻璃的化学原理——离子交换反应在玻璃表面产生一个压缩层。乔布斯打消了疑虑，并希望康宁公司在6个月内生产尽可能多的金刚玻璃。威克斯回答说：“我们没有这个能力，我们的工厂现在都不生产这种玻璃。”</p></div></div>

<p>“Don’t be afraid,”  Jobs replied. This stunned Weeks, who was good-humored and confident but not  used to Jobs’s reality distortion field. He tried to explain that a false sense  of confidence would not overcome engineering challenges, but that was a premise  that Jobs had repeatedly shown he didn’t accept. He stared at Weeks unblinking.  “Yes, you can do it,” he said. “Get your mind around it. You can do it.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>“别害怕。”乔布斯回答。这让威克斯目瞪口呆，他虽然是个幽默自信的人，但还不习惯乔布斯的现实扭曲力场。他努力向乔布斯解释，不切实际的信心并不能克服这一工程难题，但是乔布斯一再拒绝接受他的说法。他目不转睛地盯着威克斯说：“行的，你们能做到，动动脑子，你们能做到的。”</p></div></div>

<p>As Weeks retold this  story, he shook his head in astonishment. “We did it in under six months,” he  said. “We produced a glass that had never been made.” Corning’s facility in  Harrisburg, Kentucky, which had been making LCD displays, was converted almost  overnight to make gorilla glass full-time. “We put our best scientists and  engineers on it, and we just made it work.” In his airy office, Weeks has just  one framed memento on display. It’s a message Jobs sent the day the iPhone came  out: “We couldn’t have done it without you.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p><p>威克斯回忆这件事的时候，摇了摇头，一副不可置信的表情。“我们在6个月内做到了，”他说，“我们生产出了从未制造过的玻璃。”康宁公司在肯塔基州哈里斯堡有一家工厂，之前主要生产液晶显示器，一夜之间改头换面，开始全面生产金刚玻璃。“我们把自己最优秀的科学家和工程师都用在这个项目上，我们成功了。”威克斯的办公室很通风，里面只摆放着一个纪念品，是iPhone推出后乔布斯发来的信息。“如果没有你，我们做不到。”</p>

<p>威克斯最后同乔尼·艾弗成为了朋友，艾弗偶尔会前往纽约州北部，造访威克斯的湖畔度假屋。“我会给乔尼展示相似的玻璃材料，他仅凭感觉就能知道这些玻璃不一样，”威克斯说道，“只有我们公司的研究负责人能做到这一点。当你给史蒂夫展示东西的时候，他当下就会表示喜欢或讨厌。但是乔尼会摆弄它，进行思考，找到这个东西的微妙之处和潜在用途。”2010年，艾弗带领自己的高层团队成员来到康宁公司，和厂里的领班一起制作玻璃。当时，康宁公司正在研发—种更为结实的玻璃，代号“哥斯拉玻璃”（GodzillaGlass）。该公司希望，有一天能够做出足够坚韧的玻璃和陶瓷材料，用于iPhone生产，这样iPhone手机就无需使用金属外框。“乔布斯和苹果让我们更优秀，”威克斯说，“我们所有人都对自己的产品非常狂热。”</p></div></div>

<div class="left"><h3><a name="s4" id="s4"></a>The Design</h3> </p>
<p>On many of his major  projects, such as the first <em>Toy Story</em> and the Apple store, Jobs pressed  “pause” as they neared completion and decided to make major revisions. That  happened with the design of the iPhone as well. The initial design had the  glass screen set into an aluminum case. One Monday morning Jobs went over to  see Ive. “I didn’t sleep last night,” he said, “because I realized that I just  don’t love it.” It was the most important product he had made since the first  Macintosh, and it just didn’t look right to him. Ive, to his dismay, instantly  realized that Jobs was right. “I remember feeling absolutely embarrassed that  he had to make the observation.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><h3>设计</h3>
<p>在许多重大项目上，如《玩具总动员1》和苹果专卖店，乔布斯都会在其接近尾声的时候叫停，要求作出重大修改。iPhone的设计过程也逃不开这个命运。其最初设计是将玻璃屏幕嵌入铝合金外壳。一个周一早晨，乔布斯走到艾弗跟前说：“我昨晚一夜没睡，因为我意识到我就是不喜欢这个设计。”这是自第一台麦金塔问世后乔布斯最重要的产品，可他就是看不顺眼。艾弗瞬间意识到，乔布斯说的没错，于是很沮丧：“我记得自己当时感到非常繼尬，因为居然要等到他来发现这个问题。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The problem was that  the iPhone should have been all about the display, but in their current design  the case competed with the display instead of getting out of the way. The whole  device felt too masculine, task-driven, efficient. “Guys, you’ve killed  yourselves over this design for the last nine months, but we’re going to change  it,” Jobs told Ive’s team. “We’re all going to have to work nights and  weekends, and if you want we can hand out some guns so you can kill us now.”  Instead of balking, the team agreed. “It was one of my proudest moments at  Apple,” Jobs recalled.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>问题在于，iPhone的重点是屏幕显示，而他们当时的设计是金属外壳和屏幕并重。整个设备感觉太男性化，太注重效能，是一款任务驱动型产品。“伙计们，在过去9个月你们为了这个设计拼死拼活，恨不得杀了自己，但是我们要改掉它。”乔布斯告诉艾弗的团队，“我们要没日没夜没有周末地工作，如果你们愿意，我现在就给你们发几把枪，把我们全干掉。”然而团队成员并没有迟疑，同意修改。“这是我在苹果最值得骄傲的时刻之一。”乔布斯回忆说。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The new design ended  up with just a thin stainless steel bezel that allowed the gorilla glass  display to go right to the edge. Every part of the device seemed to defer to  the screen. The new look was austere, yet also friendly. You could fondle it.  It meant they had to redo the circuit boards, antenna, and processor placement  inside, but Jobs ordered the change. “Other companies may have shipped,” said  Fadell, “but we pressed the reset button and started over.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>新的设计出来了，手机的正面完全是金刚玻璃，一直延伸到边缘，与薄薄的不锈钢斜边相连接。手机的每个零件似乎都是为了屏幕而服务。新设计的外观简朴而亲切，让人忍不住想要抚摸。而这也意味着，必须重新设计制作手机内部的电路板、天线和处理器，但是乔布斯认可了这种改动。“其他公司做了这么长时间可能都已经发货了，”法德尔说，“但是我们按下了复位键，重新来过。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>One aspect of the  design, which reflected not only Jobs’s perfectionism but also his desire to  control, was that the device was tightly sealed. The case could not be opened,  even to change the battery. As with the original Macintosh in 1984, Jobs did  not want people fiddling inside. In fact when Apple discovered in 2011 that  third-party repair shops were opening up the iPhone 4, it replaced the tiny  screws with a tamper-resistant Pentalobe screw that was impossible to open with  a commercially available screwdriver. By not having a replaceable battery, it  was possible to make the iPhone much thinner. For Jobs, thinner was always  better. “He’s always believed that thin is beautiful,” said Tim Cook. “You can  see that in all of the work. We have the thinnest notebook, the thinnest  smartphone, and we made the iPad thin and then even thinner.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>这款手机完全密封，这不仅体现了乔布斯的完美主义，也展现了他的控制欲。手机无法打开，也不可能更换电池。就像1984年最早的麦金塔一样，乔布斯不想让人在里面乱动。事实上，2011年，发现第三方修理店能够打开iPhone4后，苹果公司放弃了之前使用的小螺丝，而改用一种五角形防撬螺丝，用市售的螺丝刀无法打开。由于无需更换电池，iPhone可以更薄。对乔布斯来说，总是越薄越好。“他始终以纤薄为美，”蒂姆·库克说道，“从我们所有的产品上就能看出。我们有最薄的笔记本电脑，最薄的智能手机，我们的iPad也很薄，而且以后会更薄。”</p></div></div>
 
<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><h3><a name="s5"></a>The Launch</h3> </p>
<p>When it came time to  launch the iPhone, Jobs decided, as usual, to grant a magazine a special sneak  preview. He called John Huey, the editor in chief of Time Inc., and began with  his typical superlative: “This is the best thing we’ve ever done.” He wanted to  give <em>Time</em> the exclusive, “but there’s nobody smart enough at <em>Time</em> to write it, so I’m going to give it to someone else.” Huey introduced him to  Lev Grossman, a savvy technology writer (and novelist) at <em>Time</em>. In his  piece Grossman correctly noted that the iPhone did not really invent many new  features, it just made these features a lot more usable. “But that’s important.  When our tools don’t work, we tend to blame ourselves, for being too stupid or  not reading the manual or having too-fat fingers. . . . When our tools are  broken, we feel broken. And when somebody fixes one, we feel a tiny bit more  whole.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><h3>iPhone发布</h3>
<p>iPhone即将发布时，乔布斯决定像往常一样，让某家杂志独家参与发布会预演。他通过电话联系到时代集团总编约翰·休伊，开始了自己惯用的夸张言辞。“这是我们做过的最好的东西。”他说道，他本来想把这个独家报道机会给《时代》杂志，“但是《时代》杂志的人都不够聪明，不配写，于是我打算给别人。”休伊把他介绍给列夫·格罗斯曼（LevGrossman）——《时代》杂志一位悟性高、精通文字的作家。格罗斯曼在其独家报道中一针见血地指出，iPhone并没有真正发明许多新功能，而只是让这些功能实用了很多。“但这很重要。如果工具不顺手，我们往往会觉得是自己太傻，没有阅读使用手册，或者手指太肥……如果工具很糟，我们会觉得自己也很逊。如果有人改进了工具，我们会觉得自己也完美了点儿。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>For the unveiling at  the January 2007 Macworld in San Francisco, Jobs invited back Andy Hertzfeld,  Bill Atkinson, Steve Wozniak, and the 1984 Macintosh team, as he had done when  he launched the iMac. In a career of dazzling product presentations, this may  have been his best. “Every once in a while a revolutionary product comes along  that changes everything,” he began. He referred to two earlier examples: the  original Macintosh, which “changed the whole computer industry,” and the first  iPod, which “changed the entire music industry.” Then he carefully built up to  the product he was about to launch: “Today, we’re introducing three  revolutionary products of this class. The first one is a widescreen iPod with  touch controls. The second is a revolutionary mobile phone. And the third is a  breakthrough Internet communications device.” He repeated the list for  emphasis, then asked, “Are you getting it? These are not three separate  devices, this is one device, and we are calling it iPhone.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>2007年1月，iPhone在旧金山Macworld大会亮相。乔布斯邀请了安迪·赫茨菲尔德、比尔·阿特金森、史蒂夫·沃兹尼亚克，以及1984年首款麦金塔的研发团队，就像之前iMac发布时一样。在其辉煌的产品演示生涯中，这可能是乔布斯最好的一次。“每隔一段时间，就会出现一个能够改变一切的革命性产品。”他开场说道。乔布斯举出了两个较早的例子：最早的麦金塔，它“改变了整个计算机行业”，以及第一台iPod,“改变了整个音乐产业”。接着，经过一番小心翼翼的铺垫，他引出了自己即将推出的新产品。“今天，我们将推出三款这一水准的革命性产品。第一个是宽屏触控式iPod，第二个是一款革命性的手机，第三个是突破性的互联网通信设备。”他又将这句话重复了一遍以示强调，然后他问道；“你们明白了吗？这不是三台独立的设备，而是一台设备，我们称它为iPhone。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>When the iPhone went  on sale five months later, at the end of June 2007, Jobs and his wife walked to  the Apple store in Palo Alto to take in the excitement. Since he often did that  on the day new products went on sale, there were some fans hanging out in  anticipation, and they greeted him as they would have Moses if he had walked in  to buy the Bible. Among the faithful were Hertzfeld and Atkinson. “Bill stayed  in line all night,” Hertzfeld said. Jobs waved his arms and started laughing.  “I sent him one,” he said. Hertzfeld replied, “He needs six.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>5个月后，即2007年6月底，iPhone上市销售，乔布斯和妻子前往位于帕洛奥图的苹果专卖店，感受人们的兴奋。由于乔布斯经常在新产品开始销售的第一天去店里，所以有些粉丝已等在专卖店里期待他的到来，他们跟他打招呼，就好像他们能碰到摩西去买《圣经》的情形一样。赫茨菲尔德和阿特金森也出现在忠实粉丝中间。“比尔排了一晚上的队。”赫茨菲尔德说。乔布斯挥了挥手臂，笑了起来；“我送了他一部。”赫茨菲尔德回答：“他要6个。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">

<p>The iPhone was  immediately dubbed “the Jesus Phone” by bloggers. But Apple’s competitors  emphasized that, at $500, it cost too much to be successful. “It’s the most  expensive phone in the world,” Microsoft’s Steve Ballmer said in a CNBC  interview. “And it doesn’t appeal to business customers because it doesn’t have  a keyboard.” Once again Microsoft had underestimated Jobs’s product. By the end  of 2010, Apple had sold ninety million iPhones, and it reaped more than half of  the total profits generated in the global cell phone market.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>iPhone立刻被博客写手们奉为“耶稣手机”。但是苹果公司的竞争对手强调，售价500美元很难成功。“这是世界上最贵的手机微软公司的史蒂夫·鲍尔默（SteveBallmer）在接受美国全国广播公司财经频道（CNBC）的采访时这样说道。“但它确实对商务人士没有吸引力，因为没有键盘。”微软又一次低估了乔布斯的产品。至2010年底，苹果公司已售出9000万部iPhone，其利润占全球手机市场利润总额的一半以上。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>“Steve understands  desire,” said Alan Kay, the Xerox PARC pioneer who had envisioned a “Dynabook”  tablet computer forty years earlier. Kay was good at making prophetic  assessments, so Jobs asked him what he thought of the iPhone. “Make the screen  five inches by eight inches, and you’ll rule the world,” Kay said. He did not  know that the design of the iPhone had started with, and would someday lead to,  ideas for a tablet computer that would fulfill—indeed exceed—his vision for the  Dynabook.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p><!--中文-->
“史蒂夫了解人的欲望。”艾伦·凯说道。凯是施乐PARC的先驱，他在40年前就设想过推出一台Dynabook平板电脑。凯善于作出预言性的评价，于是乔布斯询问他对于iPhone的看法。“把屏幕做成5英寸宽，8英寸长，世界就是你的了。”凯说。而他当时并不知道，iPhone的设计源自平板电脑的想法，并将用于平板电脑上，而苹果的平板电脑实现了并且实际上超越了凯所设想的Dynabook。
