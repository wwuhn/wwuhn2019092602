<div class="left">  <h3><a name="s1"></a>Warner Music</h3>
<p>At the beginning of  2002 Apple faced a challenge. The seamless connection between your iPod, iTunes  software, and computer made it easy to manage the music you already owned. But  to get new music, you had to venture out of this cozy environment and go buy a  CD or download the songs online. The latter endeavor usually meant foraying  into the murky domains of file-sharing and piracy services. So Jobs wanted to  offer iPod users a way to download songs that was simple, safe, and legal.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><h3>华纳音乐</h3>
<p>2002年初，苹果公司遇到了一个挑战。iPod、iTunes软件和计算机之间的无缝连接以让你更方便地管理音乐，但是如果要得到新的音乐，你必须要离开这样一个“舒适”的环境，去外面购买CD，或者在网上下载歌曲。如果选择第二种方式，就意味着要涉足文件分享和盗版服务的灰色地带。所以，乔布斯希望给iPod用户提供一个简单、安全且合法的下载音乐的方式。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The music industry  also faced a challenge. It was being plagued by a bestiary of piracy  services—Napster, Grokster, Gnutella, Kazaa—that enabled people to get songs  for free. Partly as a result, legal sales of CDs were down 9% in 2002.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>音乐产业也面临着一个挑战。它其实已经受到了一系列盗版的侵害——Napster,Grokster、Gnutella,Kazza——人们可以从这些服务商那里下载免费歌曲。正是在一定程度上受到了这样的冲击，2002年正版CD的销量下降了9%。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The executives at the  music companies were desperately scrambling, with the elegance of  second-graders playing soccer, to agree on a common standard for  copy-protecting digital music. Paul Vidich of Warner Music and his corporate  colleague Bill Raduchel of AOL Time Warner were working with Sony in that  effort, and they hoped to get Apple to be part of their consortium. So a group  of them flew to Cupertino in January 2002 to see Jobs.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>音乐公司的髙层们都陷入了极度混乱，不过却不能像启斯东警察②般在疯狂中保持精确的思考，他们迫切地需要制定保护数字音乐版权的通用标准。当时，华纳音乐的保罗·维迪奇（PaulVidich）和同属AOL时代华纳集团的比尔·拉杜切尔（BillRaduchel）为此正在和索尼公司合作，协同制定规则，他们希望把苹果公司也拉进来。于是，一行人在2002年1月飞到库比蒂诺去见乔布斯。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>It was not an easy  meeting. Vidich had a cold and was losing his voice, so his deputy, Kevin Gage,  began the presentation. Jobs, sitting at the head of the conference table,  fidgeted and looked annoyed. After four slides, he waved his hand and broke in.  “You have your heads up your asses,” he pointed out. Everyone turned to Vidich,  who struggled to get his voice working. “You’re right,” he said after a long  pause. “We don’t know what to do. You need to help us figure it out.” Jobs  later recalled being slightly taken aback, and he agreed that Apple would work  with the Warner-Sony effort.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>会议进行得并不顺利。维迪奇因为感冒喉咙嘶哑，所以他让助理凯文·凯奇（KevinGage）来作介绍。乔布斯坐在会议桌的主导位置，不耐烦地晃来晃去，看起来还有些愤怒。凯奇讲了4页幻灯片之后，乔布斯摆手打断了他：“你们可以自己解决的！”他说道。所有人都转过头来看维迪奇。维迪奇努力地清了清嗓子：“没错。”停顿了很久之后他又说：“但我们不知道该做什么。你要帮助我们找到方向。”乔布斯后来回忆，他当时确实有点儿吃惊。不过他最后同意了让苹果公司和华纳及索尼合作。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>If the music companies  had been able to agree on a standardized encoding method for protecting music  files, then multiple online stores could have proliferated. That would have  made it hard for Jobs to create an iTunes Store that allowed Apple to control  how online sales were handled. Sony, however, handed Jobs that opportunity when  it decided, after the January 2002 Cupertino meeting, to pull out of the talks  because it favored its own proprietary format, from which it would get  royalties.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>如果音乐公司达成了一致，为了实现音乐文件保护而开发一个标准化的编码解码器，那么各种网上商店就会激增。这样的话，乔布斯要建立一个用来控制网上销售的iTunes商店就难了。不过，索尼公司给了乔布斯这个机会。在2002年1月的库比蒂诺会议之后，索尼公司决定退出上述计划，因为它希望拥有自己专有的格式，并可以从中获得版税收益。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>“You know Steve, he  has his own agenda,” Sony’s CEO Nobuyuki Idei explained to <em>Red Herring</em> editor Tony Perkins. “Although he is a genius, he doesn’t share everything with  you. This is a difficult person to work with if you are a big company. . . . It  is a nightmare.” Howard Stringer, then head of Sony North America, added about  Jobs: “Trying to get together would frankly be a waste of time.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>索尼公司的CEO出井伸之（NobuyukiIdei）在接受《红緋鱼》杂志的编辑安东尼·帕金斯采访时说：“你知道史蒂夫，他有自己的打算。虽然他是个天才，但是他不愿意和别人分享一切。大公司很难与他合作·那简直是一场噩梦。”索尼公司北美区总裁霍华德·斯金格（HowardStringer）补充道：“说实话，寻求与他合作简直就是在浪费时间。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Instead Sony joined  with Universal to create a subscription service called Pressplay. Meanwhile,  AOL Time Warner, Bertelsmann, and EMI teamed up with RealNetworks to create  MusicNet. Neither would license its songs to the rival service, so each offered  only about half the music available. Both were subscription services that  allowed customers to stream songs but not keep them, so you lost access to them  if your subscription lapsed. They had complicated restrictions and clunky  interfaces. Indeed they would earn the dubious distinction of becoming number  nine on <em>PC World</em>’s list of “the 25 worst tech products of all time.” The  magazine declared, “The services’ stunningly brain-dead features showed that  the record companies still didn’t get it.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>后来，索尼公司和环球音乐集团合作，创建了一个叫做Pressplay的订阅服务。同时，AOL时代华纳、贝塔斯曼（Bertelsmann）及百代唱片（EMI）和里尔网络合作，推出了MusicNet。这两个平台都不会把自己的歌曲授权给对方，所以它们各自拥有一半的资源。而且它们仅为用户提供播放功能，不提供下载，所以如果你的订阅过期了，就无法再访问。另外，它们还有诸多复杂的限制条款和笨拙的界面。事实上，这两款软件因为“不分伯仲”，在《计算机世界》杂志（PCWorld）评选出来的“历史上最差的25款科技产品”中并列第九。杂志上这样写道：“这些产品惊人的愚蠢功能说明唱片公司仍然没有理解用户需求。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>At this point Jobs could  have decided simply to indulge piracy. Free music meant more valuable iPods.  Yet because he <em>really</em> liked music, and the artists who made it, he was  opposed to what he saw as the theft of creative products. As he later told me:</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>本来，乔布斯完全可以放任盗版的存在。免费音乐意味着能卖掉更多的iPod。但是，因为他真的热爱音乐，也热爱创作音乐的艺术家，所以他反对这种偷窃创意产品的行为。他后来告诉我：</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>From  the earliest days at Apple, I realized that we thrived when we created  intellectual property. If people copied or stole our software, we’d be out of  business. If it weren’t protected, there’d be no incentive for us to make new  software or product designs. If protection of intellectual property begins to  disappear, creative companies will disappear or never get started. But there’s  a simpler reason: It’s wrong to steal. It hurts other people. And it hurts your  own character.</p>

</div>
<div class="right"><p>从苹果公司创立之初，我就意识到，我们的成功是来自知识产权。如果人们可以任意复制或偷取我们的软件，我们早就破产了。如果知识产权不受到保护，我们也没有动力再去制作新软件或设计新产品了。如果没有了对知识产杈的保护，那么很多创意公司就会消失，或者根本不会出现。其实说到底，道理很简单：偷窃是不道德的。这样做会伤害其他人，也有损自己的名誉。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

  <p>He knew, however, that  the best way to stop piracy—in fact the only way—was to offer an alternative  that was more attractive than the brain-dead services that music companies were  concocting. “We believe that 80% of the people stealing stuff don’t want to be,  there’s just no legal alternative,” he told Andy Langer of <em>Esquire.</em> “So  we said, ‘Let’s create a legal alternative to this.’ Everybody wins. Music  companies win. The artists win. Apple wins. And the user wins, because he gets  a better service and doesn’t have to be a thief.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>然而他知道，阻止盗版的最佳办法——其实也是唯一办法——就是提供一个比那些音乐公司推出的愚蠢服务更加吸引人的选择。他告诉《君子》杂志的安迪·兰格（AndyLanger）：“我们相信，有80%下载盗版的人都是不得已的，只是没有给他们提供合法的选择而已。所以我们说：‘我们创立一个合法的途径吧。’这样大家都会受益。音乐公司能赢利，艺术家能赢利，苹果公司也能赢利，而用户也会有所收获，因为他们既享受到了更好的服务，又不必偷窃。”</p></div></div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>So Jobs set out to  create an “iTunes Store” and to persuade the five top record companies to allow  digital versions of their songs to be sold there. “I’ve never spent so much of  my time trying to convince people to do the right thing for themselves,” he  recalled. Because the companies were worried about the pricing model and  unbundling of albums, Jobs pitched that his new service would be only on the  Macintosh, a mere 5% of the market. They could try the idea with little risk.  “We used our small market share to our advantage by arguing that if the store  turned out to be destructive it wouldn’t destroy the entire universe,” he  recalled.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>就这样，乔布斯开始创立“iTunes商店”，并争取五大唱片公司的数字音乐的销售权。他回忆道：“我从来不会花太多时间去说服人们做对自己有利的事。”这些公司都担心定价模式和专辑的拆分,乔布斯回应说这项新服务只会在麦金塔上使用，只占有5%的市场。虽有小小的风险，但可以尝试。他说：“我们把市场份额小作为优势来说服音乐公司，即使iTunes商店失败了，也不会造成太大损失。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs’s proposal was to  sell digital songs for 99 cents—a simple and impulsive purchase. The record  companies would get 70 cents of that. Jobs insisted that this would be more  appealing than the monthly subscription model preferred by the music companies.  He believed that people had an emotional connection to the songs they loved.  They wanted to <em>own</em> “Sympathy for the Devil” and “Shelter from the  Storm,” not just rent them. As he told Jeff Goodell of <em>Rolling Stone</em> at  the time, “I think you could make available the Second Coming in a subscription  model and it might not be successful.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯计划把每首歌曲的价格定为99美分——这是个简单又容易让人心动的价格。唱片公司将从中抽取70美分。乔布斯坚持认为，这种做法比音乐公司喜欢的月度订阅的模式更有吸引力，因为他认为（后来也被证明是正确的），人们和他们喜欢的歌曲之间有一种情感联系。他们希望拥有《给恶魔的同情》③和《暴风雨中的庇护》④，而不仅仅是租用。他对《滚石》杂志的杰夫·古德尔（JeffGoodell）说：“我觉得也可以发起第二波订阅服务模式，但是它恐怕不会成功。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs also insisted  that the iTunes Store would sell individual songs, not just entire albums. That  ended up being the biggest cause of conflict with the record companies, which  made money by putting out albums that had two or three great songs and a dozen  or so fillers; to get the song they wanted, consumers had to buy the whole  album. Some musicians objected on artistic grounds to Jobs’s plan to  disaggregate albums. “There’s a flow to a good album,” said Trent Reznor of  Nine Inch Nails. “The songs support each other. That’s the way I like to make  music.” But the objections were moot. “Piracy and online downloads had already  deconstructed the album,” recalled Jobs. “You couldn’t compete with piracy  unless you sold the songs individually.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯还坚持在iTunes商店出售单首歌曲，而不仅是整张专辑。这就造成了和唱片公司之间最大的分歧，因为他们赚钱的模式是在一张专辑中主打两三首好歌，另外填充一些一般的作品，然后一起打包出售。为了获得想要的歌曲，消费者就必须买下整张专辑。一些音乐人也从艺术家的立场反对乔布斯“拆分专辑”的做法。九寸钉乐队（NineInchNails）的主唱特伦特·雷泽诺（TrentReznor）说：“一张好的专辑具有一定的连贯性，所有歌曲之间是互相支持的。这也是我喜欢制作音乐的原因。”但反对无效。乔布斯回忆道：“盗版和网上下载早已将专辑分解了。如果你不能出售单首歌曲，那你也无法和盗版竞争。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>At the heart of the  problem was a chasm between the people who loved technology and those who loved  artistry. Jobs loved both, as he had demonstrated at Pixar and Apple, and he  was thus positioned to bridge the gap. He later explained:</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>问题的核心是热爱科技的人和热爱艺术的人之间的分歧。乔布斯两个都爱，这一点在他为皮克斯公司和苹果公司工作时都有所体现，因此他也为二者之间建立了桥梁。正如他后来所说的：</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>When  I went to Pixar, I became aware of a great divide. Tech companies don’t  understand creativity. They don’t appreciate <em>intuitive</em> thinking, like  the ability of an A&amp;R guy at a music label to listen to a hundred artists  and have a feel for which five might be successful. And they think that  creative people just sit around on couches all day and are undisciplined, because  they’ve not seen how driven and disciplined the creative folks at places like  Pixar are. On the other hand, music companies are completely clueless about  technology. They think they can just go out and hire a few tech folks. But that  would be like Apple trying to hire people to produce music. We’d get  second-rate A&amp;R people, just like the music companies ended up with  second-rate tech people. I’m one of the few people who understands how  producing technology requires intuition and creativity, and how producing  something artistic takes real discipline.</p>

</div>
<div class="right"><p>当我去皮克斯公司工作时，我开始意识到这个巨大的分歧。科技公司不懂创意，他们也不欣赏依赖直觉的思维方式，比如唱片公司的A&R部门⑤听了100个人演唱之后就能感觉到哪5个人会成功。他们之所以认为创意人员只是整天窝在沙发里，自由散漫，是因为他们从来没见过在皮克斯这样的地方，创意人员是多么富有紧迫感和专业素养。另一方面，音乐公司也对技术完全没概念。他们认为他们总能从外面雇到一些技术人员。但是这就像苹果公司去找人制作音乐一样。我们只能得到二流的A&R人员，就像音乐公司只能找到二流技术人员一样。我属于少数人，既懂得发明技术需要直觉和创逡力，也知道制作艺术作品需要接受真正的专业训练。</p></div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

  <p>Jobs had a long  relationship with Barry Schuler, the CEO of the AOL unit of Time Warner, and  began to pick his brain about how to get the music labels into the proposed  iTunes Store. “Piracy is flipping everyone’s circuit breakers,” Schuler told  him. “You should use the argument that because you have an integrated  end-to-end service, from iPods to the store, you can best protect how the music  is used.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯与时代华纳旗下的AOL的CEO巴里·舒勒（BarrySchuler）是老交情，于是开始就如何把唱片品牌融入iTunes商店寻求他的建议。舒勒告诉他：“盗版颠覆了所有人的认知。而能够与之抗衡的就是把iTunes做成一种端到端一体化的服务，从iPod到商店，你就能最好地保护这些音乐。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>One day in March 2002,  Schuler got a call from Jobs and decided to conference-in Vidich. Jobs asked  Vidich if he would come to Cupertino and bring the head of Warner Music, Roger  Ames. This time Jobs was charming. Ames was a sardonic, fun, and clever Brit, a  type (such as James Vincent and Jony Ive) that Jobs tended to like. So the Good  Steve was on display. At one point early in the meeting, Jobs even played the  unusual role of diplomat. Ames and Eddy Cue, who ran iTunes for Apple, got into  an argument over why radio in England was not as vibrant as in the United  States, and Jobs stepped in, saying, “We know about tech, but we don’t know as  much about music, so let’s not argue.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p><p>2002年3月的一天，舒勒接到了乔布斯的电话，并决定要维迪奇加入到这个电话会议中。乔布斯问维迪奇，是否可以带上华纳音乐的总裁罗杰·艾姆斯（RogerAmes）—起来库比蒂诺开会。这一次乔布斯表现得很有亲和力。艾姆斯是个幽默风趣又聪明的英国人，属于乔布斯喜欢的类型（就像詹姆斯·文森特和乔尼·艾弗）。所以“好脾气的史蒂夫”出现了。在会议初期，乔布斯甚至还搞起了“外交”。当iTunes的主管埃迪·库埃和艾姆斯争论起为什么英国的广播没有美国的那么有活力时，乔布斯打断了他们，说：“我们虽然懂技术，但不算懂音乐，所以不要争了。”</p>

<p>会议一开始，艾姆斯请乔布斯支持一种新的带有防复制功能的CD格式。乔布斯很快就同意了，然后把话题转向了他想讨论的内容。他说，华纳音乐应该帮助苹果公司建立一个简涪明快的网上iTunes商店，然后再向整个业界进行推广。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Ames had just lost a  boardroom battle to have his corporation’s AOL division improve its own  fledgling music download service. “When I did a digital download using AOL, I  could never find the song on my shitty computer,” he recalled. So when Jobs  demonstrated a prototype of the iTunes Store, Ames was impressed. “Yes, yes,  that’s exactly what we’ve been waiting for,” he said. He agreed that Warner  Music would sign up, and he offered to help enlist other music companies.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>艾姆斯之前在一次董事会会议中提出，希望集团的AOL部门能够提升他们刚起步的音乐下载服务，但没有获得支持。他回忆道：“当我用AOL下载了歌曲，我在我那台烂电脑上怎么也找不到这首歌。”所以，当乔布斯展示了iTunes商店的雏形时，艾姆斯大为震撼。他说：“对，对，这恰恰是我们一直期待的模式。”他同意华纳音乐加入，并负责聚拢其他的音乐公司。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs flew east to show  the service to other Time Warner execs. “He sat in front of a Mac like a kid  with a toy,” Vidich recalled. “Unlike any other CEO, he was totally engaged  with the product.” Ames and Jobs began to hammer out the details of the iTunes  Store, including the number of times a track could be put on different devices  and how the copy-protection system would work. They soon were in agreement and  set out to corral other music labels.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯飞到美国东部，向时代华纳的其他高层展示iTunes服务。维迪奇回忆道：“他坐在一台苹果机前，就像是一个孩子在玩他心爱的玩具。和其他CEO不同，他对他的产品全心投入。”艾姆斯和乔布斯开始敲定iTunes商店的一些细节，包括一首歌曲能被下载到不同设备上的次数，以及防复制系统怎么运作。他们很快就达成了一致，并开始集结其他的唱片公司——

<div class="left"><h3><a name="s2"></a>Herding Cats</h3>
<p>The key player to  enlist was Doug Morris, head of the Universal Music Group. His domain included  must-have artists such as U2, Eminem, and Mariah Carey, as well as powerful  labels such as Motown and Interscope-Geffen-A&amp;M. Morris was eager to talk.  More than any other mogul, he was upset about piracy and fed up with the  caliber of the technology people at the music companies. “It was like the Wild  West,” Morris recalled. “No one was selling digital music, and it was awash  with piracy. Everything we tried at the record companies was a failure. The  difference in skill sets between the music folks and technologists is just  huge.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><h3>“放养猫”</h3>
<p>环球音乐集团的CEO道格·莫里斯（DougMorris）是他们要拉拢的关键人物。他旗下有很多“必备艺人”，包括U2乐队、艾米纳姆（Eminem），以及玛利亚·凯莉（MariahCarey），还有魔域唱片（Motown）和Interscope-Geffen-A&M（IGA）两大巨头。莫里斯很希望能够合作。他比任何人都更担心盗版问题，也受够了唱片公司里那些二流技术人员的水平。莫里斯回忆道：“这简直就像当年荒蛮的西部。没有人愿意卖数字音乐，他们宁愿和盗版同流合污。我们在唱片公司里所作的努力全部失败了。音乐人和科技人员之间的技能属性差距太大了。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>As Ames walked with  Jobs to Morris’s office on Broadway he briefed Jobs on what to say. It worked.  What impressed Morris was that Jobs tied everything together in a way that made  things easy for the consumer and also safe for the record companies. “Steve did  something brilliant,” said Morris. “He proposed this complete system: the  iTunes Store, the music-management software, the iPod itself. It was so smooth.  He had the whole package.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>艾姆斯和乔布斯一起徒步前往莫里斯在百老汇的办公室，在路上，艾姆斯向乔布斯简要地提示了一下稍后要谈的内容。这些提示收到了效果。让莫里斯惊叹的是，乔布斯把一切都整合在iTunes商店里了，方便了用户的同时也保证了唱片公司的利益。莫里斯说：“史蒂夫做了一件伟大的事。他提出了一个完整的系统——iTunes商店、音乐管理软件和iPod。整个过程非常顺畅，他把这些服务都打包了。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Morris was convinced  that Jobs had the technical vision that was lacking at the music companies. “Of  course we have to rely on Steve Jobs to do this,” he told his own tech vice  president, “because we don’t have anyone at Universal who knows anything about  technology.” That did not make Universal’s technologists eager to work with  Jobs, and Morris had to keep ordering them to surrender their objections and  make a deal quickly. They were able to add a few more restrictions to FairPlay,  the Apple system of digital rights management, so that a purchased song could  not be spread to too many devices. But in general, they went along with the  concept of the iTunes Store that Jobs had worked out with Ames and his Warner  colleagues.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>莫里斯承认乔布斯具有唱片公司普遍缺乏的技术视野。他和自己的技术副总裁说：“我们当然要依靠乔布斯来做这些。因为环球音乐集团里没有一个人了解技术方面的知识。”但这番话并没有使技术人员愿意与乔布斯合作，莫里斯只能压制住他们的反对意见，并快速促成合作。他们给苹果的数字版杈管理系统FakPlay又增加了一些限制条款，保证已购买的歌曲不会被下载到太多设备上。但是总的来说，他们都比较认同乔布斯与艾姆斯及其华纳的同事研究出来的iTunes商店的概念。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Morris was so smitten  with Jobs that he called Jimmy Iovine, the fast-talking and brash chief of  Interscope-Geffen-A&amp;M. Iovine and Morris were best friends who had spoken  every day for the past thirty years. “When I met Steve, I thought he was our  savior, so I immediately brought Jimmy in to get his impression,” Morris  recalled.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>莫里斯很欣赏乔布斯，他立刻打电话给音乐集团旗下公司IGA的董事长吉米·约维内（JimmyIovine），他是个语速很快又有些急性子的人，和莫里斯是很好的朋友，在过去30年中几乎每天都有交流。莫里斯回忆道：“当我遇到史蒂夫，我就感觉到他是我们的救世主，所以我立刻把吉米找来，给我们增加点儿印象分。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs could be  extraordinarily charming when he wanted to be, and he turned it on when Iovine  flew out to Cupertino for a demo. “See how simple it is?” he asked Iovine.  “Your tech folks are never going to do this. There’s no one at the music  companies who can make it simple enough.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯也可以在自己愿意时表现出超乎寻常的好脾气，在约维内飞到库比蒂诺来会面时，他就展露了这一面。“看，多简单。”他对约维内说，“你们的技术同事永远不会做这个，在唱片公司里没有人可以把它变得足够简单。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Iovine called Morris  right away. “This guy is unique!” he said. “You’re right. He’s got a turnkey  solution.” They complained about how they had spent two years working with Sony,  and it hadn’t gone anywhere. “Sony’s never going to figure things out,” he told  Morris. They agreed to quit dealing with Sony and join with Apple instead. “How  Sony missed this is completely mind-boggling to me, a historic fuckup,” Iovine  said. “Steve would fire people if the divisions didn’t work together, but  Sony’s divisions were at war with one another.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>约维内马上给莫里斯打了电话，他说：“这家伙的确与众不同！你说得没错，他有个现成的解决方案。”接下来两人又抱怨了他们是如何在过去两年里与索尼公司合作，却一无所获。约维内告诉莫里斯：“索尼永远解决不了问题。”他们最终达成一致，终止与索尼的合作，加入苹果阵营。约维内说：“索尼错过这个好机会的原因让我简直不敢相信，这真是个可以记入史册的大错。如果部门之间合作不力，史蒂夫会解雇有关人员，但是索尼内部一直搞得一团糟却没人出面解决。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Indeed Sony provided a  clear counterexample to Apple. It had a consumer electronics division that made  sleek products and a music division with beloved artists (including Bob Dylan).  But because each division tried to protect its own interests, the company as a  whole never got its act together to produce an end-to-end service.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>实际上，索尼给苹果提供了一个清晰的反面教材。他们的消费电子产品部门能制造出时髦漂亮的产品；他们的音乐部门也签约了当红的艺人（比如鲍勃·迪伦）。但是由于每一个部门都在竭力保护自己的利益，所以整个公司也无法合作推出端到端的服务。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">

<p>Andy Lack, the new  head of Sony music, had the unenviable task of negotiating with Jobs about  whether Sony would sell its music in the iTunes Store. The irrepressible and  savvy Lack had just come from a distinguished career in television journalism—a  producer at CBS News and president of NBC—and he knew how to size people up and  keep his sense of humor. He realized that, for Sony, selling its songs in the  iTunes Store was both insane and necessary—which seemed to be the case with a  lot of decisions in the music business. Apple would make out like a bandit, not  just from its cut on song sales, but from driving the sale of iPods. Lack  believed that since the music companies would be responsible for the success of  the iPod, they should get a royalty from each device sold.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>索尼音乐的新总裁安迪·拉克（AndyLack）面临着一项艰巨的任务——和乔布斯谈判，争取把索尼的音乐放进iTunes商店里出售。拉克是一个精明能干、不服输的人。他曾是哥伦比亚广播公司的制片人、全国广播公司的总裁，在电视新闻界是个响当当的人物。他看人很准，而且很有幽默感。他意识到，对于索尼来说，在iTunes商店出售音乐是一个既疯狂又必要的选择——对于唱片行业来说很多决定都是这样作出的。苹果将采用一种强盗式的做法，不仅要从歌曲中抽取利润，还要连带促进iPod的销售。拉克认为，既然是唱片公司促成了iPod的成功，那么他们也应该从iPod的销售利润中分一杯羹。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs would agree with  Lack in many of their conversations and claim that he wanted to be a true  partner with the music companies. “Steve, you’ve got me if you just give me <em>something</em> for every sale of your device,” Lack told him in his booming voice. “It’s a  beautiful device. But our music is helping to sell it. That’s what true  partnership means to me.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯可以和拉克在许多问题上达成一致，他也对拉克表示，想要成为音乐公司真正的合作伙伴。“史蒂夫，如果我们合作，你要答应每出售一台iPod就要给我一些好处。”拉克提髙了声调对他说，“虽然你的机器不错，但是我们的音乐也促进了它的销售。这就是我认为的真正的合作关系。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>“I’m with you,” Jobs  replied on more than one occasion. But then he would go to Doug Morris and  Roger Ames to lament, in a conspiratorial fashion, that Lack just didn’t get  it, that he was clueless about the music business, that he wasn’t as smart as  Morris and Ames. “In classic Steve fashion, he would agree to something, but it  would never happen,” said Lack. “He would set you up and then pull it off the  table. He’s pathological, which can be useful in negotiations. And he’s a  genius.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>“我答应你的条件。”乔布斯不止一次说出这样的话，但是之后他就会到道格·莫里斯和罗杰·艾姆斯那里去抱怨，带着一丝“明谋”意味，说拉克根本没弄明白，他对音乐产业并不在行，而且也没有莫里斯和艾姆斯聪明。拉克说：“经典的史蒂夫风格就是，他会同意一些事，但永远不会实现。他会把你设进一个局，然后置之不理。他的表现是病态的，但这点在谈判中很有用。他的确是个天才。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Lack knew that he  could not win his case unless he got support from others in the industry. But  Jobs used flattery and the lure of Apple’s marketing clout to keep the other  record labels in line. “If the industry had stood together, we could have  gotten a license fee, giving us the dual revenue stream we desperately needed,”  Lack said. “We were the ones making the iPod sell, so it would have been  equitable.” That, of course, was one of the beauties of Jobs’s end-to-end  strategy: Sales of songs on iTunes would drive iPod sales, which would drive  Macintosh sales. What made it all the more infuriating to Lack was that Sony  could have done the same, but it never could get its hardware and software and  content divisions to row in unison.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>拉克知道，他是最后的抵抗者，除非能获得业内其他人的支持，否则自己无法赢得这场战役。但是乔布斯不惜甜言蜜语，并用苹果公司的营销优势把其他人拉拢得很好。拉克说：“如果整个业界结成联盟，我们就可以拿到授权费，这样我们就会有两个收入来源，这正是我们梦寐以求的。我们帮助提升了iPod的销量，所以这个要求也是合理的。”当然，这也是乔布斯端到端一体化战略的精妙之处：iTunes上的歌曲首先促进了iPod的销售，从而拉动麦金塔的销售。让拉克更为恼火的是，索尼公司原本也可以采用这种策略，但是它的硬件部门、软件部门以及内容部门永远都无法统一步调。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs tried hard to  seduce Lack. During one visit to New York, he invited Lack to his penthouse at  the Four Seasons hotel. Jobs had already ordered a breakfast spread—oatmeal and  berries for them both—and was “beyond solicitous,” Lack recalled. “But Jack  Welch taught me not to fall in love. Morris and Ames could be seduced. They  would say, ‘You don’t get it, you’re supposed to fall in love,’ and they did.  So I ended up isolated in the industry.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯也在努力拉拢拉克。一次在纽约出差期间，他邀请拉克来他住的四季酒店顶楼的套房。乔布斯还特意为两人订了一份早餐——燕麦片和鮮莓，而且“格外殷勤”。拉克回忆道：“但是杰克·韦尔奇（JackWelch）教我不要‘被迷惑’。莫里斯和艾姆斯就抵挡不住诱惑。他们会说，‘你不懂的。你应该去投怀送抱。’他们也的确这么做了。这样一来，我就成了孤零零一个人。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Even after Sony agreed  to sell its music in the iTunes Store, the relationship remained contentious.  Each new round of renewals or changes would bring a showdown. “With Andy, it  was mostly about his big ego,” Jobs claimed. “He never really understood the  music business, and he could never really deliver. I thought he was sometimes a  dick.” When I told him what Jobs said, Lack responded, “I fought for Sony and  the music industry, so I can see why he thought I was a dick.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>即使后来索尼同意了在iTunes商店出售音乐，但双方的关系也仍旧充满争议，每一轮合同续签和条款更改都要经过一番决战。乔布斯说：“和安迪共事，你得忍受他的‘自我’过度膨胀。他从来都没有真正懂得音乐行业，他也从来都没作出过什么贡献。有时，我甚至觉得他是个侦探。”当我复述了乔布斯的这番话后，拉克回应道：“我是在为索尼和整个音乐行业争取利益，所以我能理解他为什么觉得我是个侦探。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Corralling the record  labels to go along with the iTunes plan was not enough, however. Many of their  artists had carve-outs in their contracts that allowed them personally to  control the digital distribution of their music or prevent their songs from  being unbundled from their albums and sold singly. So Jobs set about cajoling  various top musicians, which he found fun but also a lot harder than he  expected.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>不过，仅仅把唱片公司拉拢进iTunes还不足够。有很多音乐人在合同中有这样的条款：他们可以自己控制数字歌曲的发行，或者禁止他们的歌曲从专辑中被抽出单独售卖。所以乔布斯又开始拉拢一些顶尖的音乐人。他从中收获了乐趣，同时也发现，这比想象中要困难得多。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Before the launch of  iTunes, Jobs met with almost two dozen major artists, including Bono, Mick  Jagger, and Sheryl Crow. “He would call me at home, relentless, at ten at  night, to say he still needed to get to Led Zeppelin or Madonna,” Ames  recalled. “He was determined, and nobody else could have convinced some of  these artists.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>在iTunes发布之前，乔布斯约见了至少20多位主流歌手，包括波诺、米克·贾格尔（MickJagger），以及雪儿·克罗（SherylCrow）。“他会在夜里10点给我家里打电话，不管不顾，说他还是需要得到齐柏林飞船乐队和麦当娜的支持。”华纳唱片的罗杰·艾姆斯回忆道，“他已经下定决心，但是这些歌手中，有几位是谁都无法说服的。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Perhaps the oddest  meeting was when Dr. Dre came to visit Jobs at Apple headquarters. Jobs loved  the Beatles and Dylan, but he admitted that the appeal of rap eluded him. Now  Jobs needed Eminem and other rappers to agree to be sold in the iTunes Store,  so he huddled with Dr. Dre, who was Eminem’s mentor. After Jobs showed him the  seamless way the iTunes Store would work with the iPod, Dr. Dre proclaimed,  “Man, somebody finally got it right.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>或许最奇怪的会面就要算“德瑞博士”（Dr.Dre）去苹果总部拜访乔布斯的那次。乔布斯喜欢披头士乐队和鲍勃·迪伦，但是他承认，最近流行起来的说唱音乐让他动摇了。现在，乔布斯想要把艾米纳姆和其他说唱歌手的歌曲加入iTunes商店里出售，所以要先与德瑞博士套近乎，因为他曾是艾米纳姆的导师。当乔布斯向他展示iTunes商店和iPod之间的完美结合时，德瑞博士惊呼：“天哪，终于有人走对路子了。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>On the other end of  the musical taste spectrum was the trumpeter Wynton Marsalis. He was on a West  Coast fund-raising tour for Jazz at Lincoln Center and was meeting with Jobs’s  wife, Laurene. Jobs insisted that he come over to the house in Palo Alto, and  he proceeded to show off iTunes. “What do you want to search for?” he asked  Marsalis. Beethoven, the trumpeter replied. “Watch what it can do!” Jobs kept  insisting when Marsalis’s attention would wander. “See how the interface  works.” Marsalis later recalled, “I don’t care much about computers, and kept  telling him so, but he goes on for two hours. He was a man possessed. After a  while, I started looking at him and not the computer, because I was so  fascinated with his passion.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯喜欢的另一种风格完全不同的音乐人，是小号演奏家温顿·马萨里斯（WyntonMarsalis）,他当时正在西海岸为林肯中心爵士乐队进行募捐巡演，并要会见乔布斯的妻子劳伦。乔布斯坚持让他来到了帕洛奥图的家里，然后给他展示了iTunes。他问马萨里斯：“你想找什么音乐？”“贝多芬。”小号手答道。“看看iTunes能做到什么吧!”乔布斯努力让马萨里斯不要走神儿。“看看iTunes的界面是怎么工作的马萨里斯之后回忆道：“我对计算机方面的东西不怎么感兴趣，而且我也一直在向他强调这一点。但是他在那里摆弄了两个小时，就像着了魔一样。过了一会儿，我的视线从计算机转移到了他身上，因为我着迷于他的热情。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs unveiled the  iTunes Store on April 28, 2003, at San Francisco’s Moscone Center. With hair  now closely cropped and receding, and a studied unshaven look, Jobs paced the  stage and described how Napster “demonstrated that the Internet was made for  music delivery.” Its offspring, such as Kazaa, he said, offered songs for free.  How do you compete with that? To answer that question, he began by describing  the downsides of using these free services. The downloads were unreliable and  the quality was often bad. “A lot of these songs are encoded by  seven-year-olds, and they don’t do a great job.” In addition, there were no  previews or album art. Then he added, “Worst of all it’s stealing. It’s best  not to mess with karma.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯在2003年4月28日推出了iTunes商店，发布会在旧金山的莫斯康尼会议中心（MosconeConventionCenter）举行。他头发修得很短，有点儿谢顶，脸上特意留着胡须。乔布斯走上台，首先讲了Napster是怎样“体现出互联网就是为音乐分享而服务的”。他说，它的下一代，Kazaa，提供免费的音乐。你怎样和它们竞争？为了回答这个问题，他开始介绍这些免费服务的式微。下载的内容不可靠，而且质量通常很差。“很多歌曲都是7岁小孩编的码，他们做得并不怎么样。”此外，也不提供试听和专辑封面。之后他还补充了一句：“最糟糕的一点——这是偷窃行为，会遭报应的。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Why had these piracy  sites proliferated, then? Because, Jobs said, there was no alternative. The  subscription services, such as Pressplay and MusicNet, “treat you like a  criminal,” he said, showing a slide of an inmate in striped prison garb. Then a  slide of Bob Dylan came on the screen. “People want to own the music they  love.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>那么，为什么这些盗版网站还这么猖镢？乔布斯说，是因为没有别的选择。像按键播放和音乐网这样的订阅服务“把你像罪犯一样对待”，他一边说，一边展示了一张穿着条纹囚服的囚犯照片。接下来的一页是鲍勃·迪伦的照片。“人们想要拥有自己喜欢的音乐！”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>After a lot of  negotiating with the record companies, he said, “they were willing to do  something with us to change the world.” The iTunes Store would start with  200,000 tracks, and it would grow each day. By using the store, he said, you  can own your songs, burn them on CDs, be assured of the download quality, get a  preview of a song before you download it, and use it with your iMovies and  iDVDs to “make the soundtrack of your life.” The price? Just 99 cents, he said,  less than a third of what a Starbucks latte cost. Why was it worth it? Because  to get the right song from Kazaa took about fifteen minutes, rather than a  minute. By spending an hour of your time to save about four dollars, he calculated,  “you’re working for under the minimum wage!” And one more thing . . . “With  iTunes, it’s not stealing anymore. It’s good karma.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>在和一些唱片公司进行了很多轮谈判之后，他说：“他们想加入我们，和我们一起改变世界。”iTunes商店起初会有20万首歌曲，之后的每一天都会有新增曲目。他还说，有了iTunes商店，你可以得到你想要的歌曲，把它们刻录成CD，不用担心质量问题，可以在下载之前试听曲目，还可以用iMovie和iDVD以这些歌曲为配乐“制作你自己的音乐大碟”。价格如何？99美分。他说，还不到一杯星巴克拿铁咖啡价格的1/3。为什么花这个钱是值得的？因为要从Kazaa下载一首优质的歌曲需要15分钟，而iTunes只需要1分钟。为了省4美元而花费整整1个小时，他说：“你赚得比最低时薪还要低！”还有……“用iTunes下载歌曲，不再偷窃。你种下的是善因。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Clapping the loudest  for that line were the heads of the record labels in the front row, including  Doug Morris sitting next to Jimmy Iovine, in his usual baseball cap, and the  whole crowd from Warner Music. Eddy Cue, who was in charge of the store,  predicted that Apple would sell a million songs in six months. Instead the  iTunes Store sold a million songs in six <em>days.</em> “This will go down in  history as a turning point for the music industry,” Jobs declared.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>最热烈的掌声来自观众席的前排，几大唱片公司的老板都坐在那里，包括道格·莫里斯，他的旁边是戴着棒球帽的吉米·约维内，还有华纳音乐的所有高层。负责iTunes商店的埃迪·库埃预计，苹果将在未来6个月销售100万首歌曲。但事实上，iTunes商店在6天内就卖掉了100万首。乔布斯宣告：“这将作为音乐行业的一个转折点被载入史册。”——

<div class="left"><h3><a name="s3"></a>Microsoft</h3><p>“We were smoked.”</p>
<p>That was the blunt  email sent to four colleagues by Jim Allchin, the Microsoft executive in charge  of Windows development, at 5 p.m. the day he saw the iTunes Store. It had only  one other line: “How did they get the music companies to go along?”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><h3>微软公司</h3>
<p>“我们被干掉了。”

　　</p>
<p>这是微软公司负责Windows系统开发的主管吉姆·阿尔钦（JimAllchin）发给4个同事的一封直言不讳的邮件，发件时间是下午5点钟，吉姆刚刚看完iTunes商店的发布会。整封邮件只有两句话，除了上面的这句，还有一句：“他们是怎么把音乐公司给拉进来的？”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Later that evening a  reply came from David Cole, who was running Microsoft’s online business group.  “When Apple brings this to Windows (I assume they won’t make the mistake of not  bringing it to Windows), we will really be smoked.” He said that the Windows  team needed “to bring this kind of solution to market,” adding, “That will  require focus and goal alignment around an <em>end-to-end service</em> which  delivers direct user value, something we don’t have today.” Even though  Microsoft had its own Internet service (MSN), it was not used to providing  end-to-end service the way Apple was.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>那天晚上，负责运营微软在线业务的戴维·科尔（DavidCole）回信了：“一旦苹果把iTunes引入Windows系统（我觉得他们不会愚蠢到不进军Windows），那我们才是真的有麻烦了。”他说，Windows团队需要“把这种解决方案推向市场”。他还补充道；“我们的关注点和目标要集中在端到端服务上，传递用户价值，这是我们现在还没能做到的。”即使微软有自己的网络服务（MSN），但它并没有像苹果那样提供“端到端的服务”。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Bill Gates himself  weighed in at 10:46 that night. His subject line, “Apple’s Jobs again,”  indicated his frustration. “Steve Jobs’s ability to focus in on a few things  that count, get people who get user interface right, and market things as  revolutionary are amazing things,” he said. He too expressed surprise that Jobs  had been able to convince the music companies to go along with his store. “This  is very strange to me. The music companies’ own operations offer a service that  is truly unfriendly to the user. Somehow they decide to give Apple the ability  to do something pretty good.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>比尔·盖茨在当晚10点46分发表了评论，标题是“还是苹果的乔布斯”——他的沮丧表露无遗。他说：“史蒂夫·乔布斯有种惊人的能力：把关注点放在真正有价值的地方，能找来会做用户界面的人，以及革命性的营销手段。”他也非常惊讶于乔布斯能说服那么多唱片公司加人他的商店。“这在我看来很奇怪。音乐公司提供的服务都太不人性化了。但不知为什么，他们却决定把这个绝好的机会让给苹果。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Gates also found it  strange that no one else had created a service that allowed people to buy songs  rather than subscribe on a monthly basis. “I am not saying this strangeness  means we messed up—at least if we did, so did Real and Pressplay and MusicNet  and basically everyone else,” he wrote. “Now that Jobs has done it we need to  move fast to get something where the user interface and Rights are as good. . .  . I think we need some plan to prove that, even though Jobs has us a bit flat  footed again, we can move quick and both match and do stuff better.” It was an  astonishing private admission: Microsoft had again been caught flat-footed, and  it would again try to catch up by copying Apple. But like Sony, Microsoft could  never make it happen, even after Jobs showed the way.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>还有一点让盖茨觉得奇怪：除了苹果之外，没有其他公司推出过购买歌曲的服务，而都是采用月度订阅的方式。他写道：“我说奇怪并不是指我们搞砸了——至少，如果我们搞砸了，那么Real、PressPlay和MusicNet，甚至每个公司也都搞砸。既然乔布斯已经做了，那我们就需要赶快去找一些同样好的用户界面、拿到同样好的版扠……我认为我们需要一些计划来证明自己，即使乔布斯又一次让我们措手不及，我们也可以迅速行动起来，做出更好的东西。”这种私下的说法让人吃惊，无异于承认：微软再一次被赶超，被打了个措手不及，它也将再次复制苹果的模式，奋起直追。但是和索尼一样，微软从来都没有完成这个任务，即使乔布斯已经给他们指明了方向。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Instead Apple  continued to smoke Microsoft in the way that Cole had predicted: It ported the  iTunes software and store to Windows. But that took some internal agonizing.  First, Jobs and his team had to decide whether they wanted the iPod to work  with Windows computers. Jobs was initially opposed. “By keeping the iPod for  Mac only, it was driving the sales of Macs even more than we expected,” he  recalled. But lined up against him were all four of his top executives:  Schiller, Rubinstein, Robbin, and Fadell. It was an argument about what the  future of Apple should be. “We felt we should be in the music player business,  not just in the Mac business,” said Schiller.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>事实上，苹果继续向微软开火，而且还是以科尔预计到的方式——苹果把iTunes软件和商店引入到了Windows系统。但是这也引起了内部的激烈争论。首先，乔布斯和他的团队需要决定是否要让iPod和Windows计算机兼容。起初，乔布斯是反对的，他回忆道：“如果iPod只能用在苹果机上，就可以促进苹果机的销售，而且销量比我们预期的更多。”但是4位主要髙层——席勒、鲁宾斯坦、罗宾和法德尔都不同意他的观点。他们的争论主要围绕苹果公司的未来。席勒说：“我们觉得，我们应该立足于音乐播放器市场，而不仅仅是苹果机。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs always wanted  Apple to create its own unified utopia, a magical walled garden where hardware  and software and peripheral devices worked well together to create a great  experience, and where the success of one product drove sales of all the  companions. Now he was facing pressure to have his hottest new product work  with Windows machines, and it went against his nature. “It was a really big  argument for months,” Jobs recalled, “me against everyone else.” At one point  he declared that Windows users would get to use iPods “over my dead body.” But  still his team kept pushing. “This <em>needs</em> to get to the PC,” said Fadell.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯一直希望苹果公司能建立起独立统一的乌托邦，在这个神奇的围墙花园里，硬件、件和外围设备完美结合，创造一种绝妙的体验，某一个产品的成功也能促进所有关联产品的销售。然而现在，他正面临一个压力——让他最热门的新产品和Windows计算机配置在一起，这显然违背了他的天性。乔布斯回忆道：“这场拉锯战持续了好几个月。所有人都站在我的对立面。”有一次，他甚至宣称Windows用户只能等他死了才可以使用iPod。但是他的团队仍在竭力推动这个建议。法德尔说：“iPod的确需要打入个人电脑市场。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Finally Jobs declared,  “Until you can prove to me that it will make business sense, I’m not going to  do it.” That was actually his way of backing down. If you put aside emotion and  dogma, it was easy to prove that it made business sense to allow Windows users  to buy iPods. Experts were called in, sales scenarios developed, and everyone  concluded this would bring in more profits. “We developed a spreadsheet,” said  Schiller. “Under all scenarios, there was no amount of cannibalization of Mac  sales that would outweigh the sales of iPods.” Jobs was sometimes willing to  surrender, despite his reputation, but he never won any awards for gracious  concession speeches. “Screw it,” he said at one meeting where they showed him  the analysis. “I’m sick of listening to you assholes. Go do whatever the hell  you want.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>最终，乔布斯决定：“除非你们可以证明给我看这具有商业价值，否则我不会同意的。”这其实是他让步的方式。其实拋开情感和教条来说，很容易证明Windows用户购买iPod所体现的商业价值。他们请来了专家，分析了很多种销售情况，结果每种情况都证明这样做能带来更多利润。席勒说：“我们制作了一张数据表。在任何一种情况下，无论将各种苹果电脑如何搭配，它们的销量都无法超过iPod的销量。”有时乔布斯愿意放下身段作出妥协，但他在让步这个问题上从来都没有好名声。一次会议上，他们向他展示了分析结果。他说：“去他的！我已经厌烦了听你们这群混蛋说话。你们爱怎么做就怎么做吧。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>That left another  question: When Apple allowed the iPod to be compatible with Windows machines,  should it also create a version of iTunes to serve as the music-management  software for those Windows users? As usual, Jobs believed the hardware and  software should go together: The user experience depended on the iPod working  in complete sync (so to speak) with iTunes software on the computer. Schiller  was opposed. “I thought that was crazy, since we don’t make Windows software,”  Schiller recalled. “But Steve kept arguing, ‘If we’re going to do it, we should  do it right.’”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>但这又带来了另一个问题：如果苹果允许iPod和Windows计算机兼容，那么它是否要为Windows用户开发一个新版本的iTunes音乐管理软件？和往常一样，乔布斯认为硬件和软件应该一体化。用户体验依赖于iPod和计算机上的iTunes软件的完全同步（从某种意义上可以这么说）。席勒反对专门制作一个软件，他回忆说：“我觉得这样做太荒谬了，因为我们又不是做Windows软件的。但是史蒂夫一直坚持说：‘既然我们要做这件事，就应该做得漂亮。’”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Schiller prevailed at  first. Apple decided to allow the iPod to work with Windows by using software  from MusicMatch, an outside company. But the software was so clunky that it  proved Jobs’s point, and Apple embarked on a fast-track effort to produce  iTunes for Windows. Jobs recalled:</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>席勒的意见起初占了上风。苹果先通过一家外部公司MusicMatch的软件来实现iPod和Windows系统兼容。但是这个软件太笨拙了一这也证明了乔布斯的观点是对的。之后,苹果迅速为制作Windows版本的iTunes迈出了第一步。乔布斯回忆道：</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>To  make the iPod work on PCs, we initially partnered with another company that had  a jukebox, gave them the secret sauce to connect to the iPod, and they did a  crappy job. That was the worst of all worlds, because this other company was  controlling a big piece of the user experience. So we lived with this crappy  outside jukebox for about six months, and then we finally got iTunes written  for Windows. In the end, you just don’t want someone else to control a big part  of the user experience. People may disagree with me, but I am pretty consistent  about that.</p>

</div>
<div class="right"><p>为了让iPod在Windows计算机上使用，我们起初和一个制作播放器软件的公司合作，并告诉了他们连接iPod的秘诀，但是他们做得太差了。这是整个世界上最糟糕的事情，因为这家公司控制了用户体验中的关键部分。所以我们容忍了这个讨厌的外部播放器长达6个月，之后我们终于写出了Windows版的iTunes软件。最终，你还是不想让其他人去控制用户体验。人们可能对此有非议，但我一直非常坚持这个做法。</p></div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

  <p>Porting iTunes to  Windows meant going back to all of the music companies—which had made deals to  be in iTunes based on the assurance that it would be for only the small  universe of Macintosh users—and negotiate again. Sony was especially resistant.  Andy Lack thought it another example of Jobs changing the terms after a deal  was done. It was. But by then the other labels were happy about how the iTunes  Store was working and went along, so Sony was forced to capitulate.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>把iTunes装在Windows系统里，也意味着要和所有的音乐公司重新谈判。因为此前签订的协议中明确约定，保证iTrnies仅仅是为麦金塔用户这一小众群体服务的。索尼公司尤其反对这个改变。安迪·拉克认为这是乔布斯又一次在合同签订之后修改条款——也确实如此。但是当时，其他的唱片公司都对iTunes的新举动感到尚兴，这样一来索尼公司也不得不停止抵抗。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs announced the  launch of iTunes for Windows in October 2003. “Here’s a feature that people  thought we’d never add until this happened,” he said, waving his hand at the  giant screen behind him. “Hell froze over,” proclaimed the slide. The show  included iChat appearances and videos from Mick Jagger, Dr. Dre, and Bono.  “It’s a very cool thing for musicians and music,” Bono said of the iPod and iTunes.  “That’s why I’m here to kiss the corporate ass. I don’t kiss everybody’s.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>2003年10月，乔布斯在旧金山的一次产品推介会上发布了Windows版本的iTunes。“在我们加上这个功能之前，人们以为我们永远不会这样做。”他一边说，一边在大屏幕前挥手——幻灯片上写着“冰封地狱”①。这次展示还包括iChat的界面外观，以及米克·贾格尔、德瑞博士和波诺的视频。“这对音乐人和音乐来说都是个很新潮的玩意儿。”波诺这样评价iPod和iTunes,“所以我才要来拍苹果的马屁，要知道我可不是到处拍马屁的人。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs was never prone  to understatement. To the cheers of the crowd, he declared, “iTunes for Windows  is probably the best Windows app ever written.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯从来都不是谦虚保守的人。他对着正在欢呼的人群宣布：“Windows版的iTunes很可能是Windows系统里最棒的应用程序！”</p></div></div>

<p>Microsoft was not  grateful. “They’re pursuing the same strategy that they pursued in the PC  business, controlling both the hardware and software,” Bill Gates told <em>Business  Week.</em> “We’ve always done things a little bit differently than Apple in  terms of giving people choice.” It was not until three years later, in November  2006, that Microsoft was finally able to release its own answer to the iPod. It  was called the Zune, and it looked like an iPod, though a bit clunkier. Two  years later it had achieved a market share of less than 5%. Jobs was brutal  about the cause of the Zune’s uninspired design and market weakness:</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>微软一点儿都不领情。比尔·盖茨在接受《商业周刊》采访时说：“他们现在采取的策略和当初进攻计算机市场时一样，他们要同时控制硬件和软件。我们和苹果的做法不太一样，我们会给用户更多选择。”直到3年之后，2006年11月，微软终于对iPod宣战，推出了Zune播放器，和iPod外观类似，但没有iPod轻巧。两年过去，它的市场份额还不到5%。又过了几年，乔布斯直截了当地指出了造成Zune缺乏灵感的设计和市场疲弱的原因：</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The  older I get, the more I see how much motivations matter. The Zune was crappy  because the people at Microsoft don’t really love music or art the way we do.  We won because we personally love music. We made the iPod for ourselves, and  when you’re doing something for yourself, or your best friend or family, you’re  not going to cheese out. If you don’t love something, you’re not going to go  the extra mile, work the extra weekend, challenge the status quo as much.</p>

</div>
<div class="right"><p>随着年纪增长，我越发懂得“动机”的重要性。Zune是一个败笔，因为微软公司的人并不像我们这样热爱音乐和艺术。我们赢了，是因为我们发自内心地热爱音乐。我们做iPod是为了自己。当你真正为自己、为好朋友或家人做一些事时，你就不会轻易放弃。但如果你不热爱这件事，那么你就不会多走一步，也不情愿在周末加班，只会安于现状——

<div class="left">  <h3><a name="s4"></a>Mr. Tambourine Man</h3>
<p>Andy Lack’s first  annual meeting at Sony was in April 2003, the same week that Apple launched the  iTunes Store. He had been made head of the music division four months earlier,  and had spent much of that time negotiating with Jobs. In fact he arrived in  Tokyo directly from Cupertino, carrying the latest version of the iPod and a  description of the iTunes Store. In front of the two hundred managers gathered,  he pulled the iPod out of his pocket. “Here it is,” he said as CEO Nobuyuki  Idei and Sony’s North America head Howard Stringer looked on. “Here’s the  Walkman killer. There’s no mystery meat. The reason you bought a music company  is so that you could be the one to make a device like this. You can do better.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><h3>“铃鼓先生”</h3>
<p>安迪·拉克在索尼参加的第一次年度会议是在2003年4月，和苹果公司推出iTunes商店的时间在同一周。他在4个月之前被指派掌管音乐部门，花了很多时间和乔布斯谈判。实际上，他带着最新版本的iPod和关于iTunes商店的介绍，从库比蒂诺直接飞到了东京。在200位经理面前，他从口袋里拿出了iPod，“就是这个。”CEO出井伸之和索尼北美区总裁霍华德·斯金格看了看。“随身听的大敌来了。这并不是个徒有其表、滥竽充数的东西。我们收购一家音乐公司的原因就是为了能做出这样的产品。我们可以做得更好。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>But Sony couldn’t. It  had pioneered portable music with the Walkman, it had a great record company,  and it had a long history of making beautiful consumer devices. It had all of  the assets to compete with Jobs’s strategy of integration of hardware,  software, devices, and content sales. Why did it fail? Partly because it was a  company, like AOL Time Warner, that was organized into divisions (that word  itself was ominous) with their own bottom lines; the goal of achieving synergy  in such companies by prodding the divisions to work together was usually  elusive.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>但是索尼并没有做到。它拥有前卫的便携式随身听系列，有一家很棒的唱片公司，还有多年制造精致的消费电子产品的经验。它拥有所有能与乔布斯的“硬件、软件、设备、内容销售整合战略”相匹敌的资本。那为什么失败了？一部分原因在于索尼是一家像AOL时代华纳这样的大公司，旗下有多个分支（“分支”这个词本身就不吉利），每个分支都有自己的“底线”。在这样的公司里，如果让多个分支为了共同目标而协同运作，通常是很难实现的。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs did not organize  Apple into semiautonomous divisions; he closely controlled all of his teams and  pushed them to work as one cohesive and flexible company, with one  profit-and-loss bottom line. “We don’t have ‘divisions’ with their own  P&amp;L,” said Tim Cook. “We run one P&amp;L for the company.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯没有把苹果公司分割成多个自主的分支，他紧密地控制着他所有的团队，并促使他们作为一个团结而灵活的整体一起工作，全公司只有一条“损益底线”。蒂姆·库克说：“我们没有财务独立核算的事业部，全公司统一核算。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>In addition, like many  companies, Sony worried about cannibalization. If it built a music player and  service that made it easy for people to share digital songs, that might hurt  sales of its record division. One of Jobs’s business rules was to never be  afraid of cannibalizing yourself. “If you don’t cannibalize yourself, someone  else will,” he said. So even though an iPhone might cannibalize sales of an  iPod, or an iPad might cannibalize sales of a laptop, that did not deter him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>此外，和其他很多公司一样，索尼也很担心“内部相残”。如果他们推出了一个音乐播放器，以及一个方便人们分享数字音乐的服务，那么唱片分支的销售就会受到影响。乔布斯的一个商业原则就是：永远不要害怕内部相残。他说：“与其被别人取代，不如自己取代自己。”所以，即使iPhone的出现会蚕食iPod的销售，或者iPad影响了笔记本电脑的销售，都没有阻碍他的想法。</p></div></div>

<p>That July, Sony  appointed a veteran of the music industry, Jay Samit, to create its own  iTunes-like service, called Sony Connect, which would sell songs online and  allow them to play on Sony’s portable music devices. “The move was immediately  understood as a way to unite the sometimes conflicting electronics and content  divisions,” the <em>New York Times</em> reported. “That internal battle was seen  by many as the reason Sony, the inventor of the Walkman and the biggest player  in the portable audio market, was being trounced by Apple.” Sony Connect  launched in May 2004. It lasted just over three years before Sony shut it down.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>这一年7月，索尼聘请了一位唱片业资深人士杰伊·萨米特（JaySamit）来制作一款和iTunes类似的服务软件。这款软件被命名为SonyConnect，能够在线销售音乐，并能够在索尼的便携式音乐设备上加以播放。《纽约时报》报道说：“这一举动马上就被看做是电子产品和内容领域的结合，虽然有时二者是相冲突的。内部纷争是随身听发明者和便携音乐播放器市场第一大巨头索尼被苹果打败的原因，很多人都这么认为。”2004年5月，SonyConnect发布了。但是只维持了3年，索尼就关闭了这项服务。</p></div></div>

<p>Microsoft was willing  to license its Windows Media software and digital rights format to other  companies, just as it had licensed out its operating system in the 1980s. Jobs,  on the other hand, would not license out Apple’s FairPlay to other device  makers; it worked only on an iPod. Nor would he allow other online stores to  sell songs for use on iPods. A variety of experts said this would eventually  cause Apple to lose market share, as it did in the computer wars of the 1980s.  “If Apple continues to rely on a proprietary architecture,” the Harvard  Business School professor Clayton Christensen told <em>Wired</em>, “the iPod will  likely become a niche product.” (Other than in this case, Christensen was one  of the world’s most insightful business analysts, and Jobs was deeply  influenced by his book <em>The Innovator’s Dilemma.</em>) Bill Gates made the  same argument. “There’s nothing unique about music,” he said. “This story has  played out on the PC.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>微软愿意把WindowsMedia软件和数字版权授予其他公司，就像他们在20世纪80年代授权操作系统一样。但另一方面，乔布斯不会把苹果的FakPlay授权给其他的设备制造商，这个软件只能在iPod上运行$而且他也不允许其他网上商店销售供iPod播放的歌曲。一些专家认为，这将最终导致苹果损失市场份额，就像20世纪80年代计算机大战时那样。哈佛商学院的教授克莱顿·克里斯坦森（ClaytonChristensen）告诉《连线》杂志：“如果苹果继续依靠这种‘专有制’结构，iPod很可能变成一个小众产品。”〖虽然这个预言没成真，但不妨碍克里斯坦森是世界上最有预见性、最富涧察力的商业分析师之一。乔布斯深受他的书《创新者的窘境》（TheInnovator-sDilemma）影响。〗比尔·盖茨也有相同的看法。他说：“做音乐没什么特别的。这一点在个人电脑方面得到了体现，容许选择，是行之有效的方式。”</p></div></div>

<p>Rob Glaser, the  founder of RealNetworks, tried to circumvent Apple’s restrictions in July 2004  with a service called Harmony. He had attempted to convince Jobs to license  Apple’s FairPlay format to Harmony, but when that didn’t happen, Glaser just  reverse-engineered it and used it with the songs that Harmony sold. Glaser’s  strategy was that the songs sold by Harmony would play on any device, including  an iPod or a Zune or a Rio, and he launched a marketing campaign with the  slogan “Freedom of Choice.” Jobs was furious and issued a release saying that  Apple was “stunned that RealNetworks has adopted the tactics and ethics of a  hacker to break into the iPod.” RealNetworks responded by launching an Internet  petition that demanded “Hey Apple! Don’t break my iPod.” Jobs kept quiet for a  few months, but in October he released a new version of the iPod software that  caused songs bought through Harmony to become inoperable. “Steve is a  one-of-a-kind guy,” Glaser said. “You know that about him when you do business  with him.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>2004年7月，RealNetworks的创始人罗伯·格拉瑟（RobGlaser）试图绕开苹果的限制，推出了一项名为Harmony（和谐）的服务。他曾经努力说服乔布斯把苹果的FakPlay格式授权给Harmony，但是未能如愿，于是格拉瑟就把FairPlay格式做了逆向工程，并使用在Harmony出售的歌曲上。格拉瑟的策略是让Harmony出售的歌曲能够在任何设备上播放，包括iPod、Zune和Rio。之后他还发布了以“选择自由”为口号的营销活动。乔布斯怒不可遏，发布新闻稿称，苹果“非常吃惊里尔网络采用黑客式的不道德手段侵入iPod”。作为回应，里尔网络发起了一次网络请愿，广为呼吁：“嗨，苹果！不要毁了我的iPod。”随后的几个月内，乔布斯一直保持沉默，但是在10月，他发布了〃款新版的iPod软件，不再支持从Harmony购买的任何歌曲。格拉瑟说：“史蒂夫是个独一无二的家伙。你和他做生意的时候就能感受到这一点了。”</p></div></div>

<p>In the meantime Jobs  and his team—Rubinstein, Fadell, Robbin, Ive—were able to keep coming up with  new versions of the iPod that extended Apple’s lead. The first major revision,  announced in January 2004, was the iPod Mini. Far smaller than the original  iPod—just the size of a business card—it had less capacity and was about the  same price. At one point Jobs decided to kill it, not seeing why anyone would  want to pay the same for less. “He doesn’t do sports, so he didn’t relate to  how it would be great on a run or in the gym,” said Fadell. In fact the Mini  was what truly launched the iPod to market dominance, by eliminating the  competition from smaller flash-drive players. In the eighteen months after it  was introduced, Apple’s market share in the portable music player market shot  from 31% to 74%.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>同时，乔布斯和他的团队——鲁宾斯坦、法德尔、罗宾以及艾弗——也在不断地推出新版本的iPod，产品大受欢迎之余，更稳固了苹果的领先地位。2004年1月，苹果宣布了第—项重大的改革——推出iPodmini,比最初的iPod小很多，和一张名片差不多大，但是容量也更小，价格不变。有一段时间，乔布斯曾想过放弃这个想法，因为他不理解为什么有人会花同样的价钱买更小的容量。法德尔说：“他平时不怎么运动，所以他也不知道iPodmini在跑步或去健身时有多方便。”事实上，iPodmini真正使iPod站稳了市场，消灭了其他经营小体积闪存播放器的竞争者。在iPodmini发布的18个月之后，苹果在便携式音乐播放器市场中的份额从31%增加到了74%。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The iPod Shuffle,  introduced in January 2005, was even more revolutionary. Jobs learned that the  shuffle feature on the iPod, which played songs in random order, had become  very popular. People liked to be surprised, and they were also too lazy to keep  setting up and revising their playlists. Some users even became obsessed with  figuring out whether the song selection was truly random, and if so, why their  iPod kept coming back to, say, the Neville Brothers. </p>

<p>That feature led to the  iPod Shuffle. As Rubinstein and Fadell were working on creating a flash player  that was small and inexpensive, they kept doing things like making the screen  tinier. At one point Jobs came in with a crazy suggestion: Get rid of the  screen altogether. “What?!?” Fadell responded. “Just get rid of it,” Jobs  insisted. Fadell asked how users would navigate the songs. Jobs’s insight was  that you wouldn’t need to navigate; the songs would play randomly. After all,  they were songs you had chosen. All that was needed was a button to skip over a  song if you weren’t in the mood for it. “Embrace uncertainty,” the ads read.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p><p>2005年1月，苹果引入了iPodShuffle，这是一个更具革命性的创新。乔布斯注意到iPod上面的“随机播放”功能非常受欢迎，它可以让使用者以随机顺序播放歌曲。这是因为人们喜欢遇到惊喜，而且也懶于对播放列表进行设置和改动。有一些用户甚至热衷于观察歌曲的选择是否是真正的随机，因为如果真的是随机播放，那为什么他们的iPod总是回到比如《内维尔兄弟》（TheNevilleBrothers）这儿来？</p>
<p>这个功能引出了iPodShuffle。当鲁宾斯坦和法德尔努力制造一款体积更小、价格更低的闪存播放器时，他们一直在尝试把屏幕的面积缩小之类的事情。有一次，乔布斯提出了一个疯狂的建议：干脆把屏幕去掉吧。“什么？！”法德尔没有反应过来。“去掉屏幕。”乔布斯坚持。法德尔担心的是用户怎么找歌曲，而乔布斯的观点是他们根本不需要找歌曲，歌曲可以随机播放。毕竟，所有的歌曲都是用户自己挑选的，他们只需要在碰到不想听的歌曲时按“下一首”跳过去。iPodShuffle的广告词是：“拥抱不确定性。”</p></div></div>

<p>As competitors  stumbled and Apple continued to innovate, music became a larger part of Apple’s  business. In January 2007 iPod sales were half of Apple’s revenues. The device  also added luster to the Apple brand. But an even bigger success was the iTunes  Store. Having sold one million songs in the first six days after it was  introduced in April 2003, the store went on to sell seventy million songs in  its first year. In February 2006 the store sold its one billionth song when  Alex Ostrovsky, sixteen, of West Bloomfield, Michigan, bought Coldplay’s “Speed  of Sound” and got a congratulatory call from Jobs, bestowing upon him ten  iPods, an iMac, and a $10,000 music gift certificate.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>随着竞争者的踌躇不前和苹果的不断创新，音乐日益成为了苹果公司的一大块业务。到2007年1月，iPod的销售收入占到了苹果总收入的一半，同时也为苹果品牌增加了价值。然而更大的成功来自iTunes商店。自从在2003年4月发布后的6天内卖出100万首歌曲开始，iTunes商店在第一年一共卖出7000万首歌曲。2006年2月，iTunes商店卖出了第10亿首歌曲，买家是来自密歇根州西布鲁姆菲尔德的16岁男孩阿历克斯·奥斯特洛夫斯基（AlexOstmvsky），他买的是酷玩乐队（Coldplay）的《音速飞行》（SpeedofSound）。乔布斯亲自打电话向他祝贺，并赠送了他10部iPod，1台iMac,还有1张价值1万美元的音乐礼品券。2010年2月，乔治亚州的伍德斯托克，一位71岁的老人路易·舒尔策（LouieSuicer）下载了第100亿首歌曲——约翰尼·卡什（JohnnyCash）的《世事如此》（GuessThingsHappenThatWay）。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The success of the  iTunes Store also had a more subtle benefit. By 2011 an important new business  had emerged: being the service that people trusted with their online identity  and payment information. Along with Amazon, Visa, PayPal, American Express, and  a few other services, Apple had built up databases of people who trusted them  with their email address and credit card information to facilitate safe and  easy shopping. This allowed Apple to sell, for example, a magazine subscription  through its online store; when that happened, Apple, not the magazine  publisher, would have a direct relationship with the subscriber. As the iTunes  Store sold videos, apps, and subscriptions, it built up a database of 225  million active users by June 2011, which positioned Apple for the next age of  digital commerce.</p>

iTunes商店的成功还带来了一个微妙的好处。2011年，出现了一种重要的全新商业模式：iTunes商店成了这样一项服务：能把信任它的用户的在线身份和支付信息收集起来。苹果与亚马逊、维萨（Visa）信用卡、贝宝（PayPal）在线支付、美国运通银行，以及其他一些服务商进行合作，将信任它们的用户收录进数据库，里面包含了用户的邮箱地址和信用卡信息，方便他们以安全和便利的方式进行在线购买。除了音乐，苹果还可通过在线商店提供杂志订阅服务，在订单达成之后，苹果将代替杂志出版商和订阅者建立直接的联系。随着iTunes商店开始销售视频、应用程序和订阅服务，截止到2011年6月，该数据库中已有2.25亿活跃用户，把苹果带入了数字商业的新时代——
