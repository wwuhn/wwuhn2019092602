<div class="left">  <h3><a name="s1" id="s1"></a>Google: Open versus Closed</h3>
<p>A few days after he  unveiled the iPad in January 2010, Jobs held a “town hall” meeting with  employees at Apple’s campus. Instead of exulting about their transformative new  product, however, he went into a rant against Google for producing the rival  Android operating system. Jobs was furious that Google had decided to compete  with Apple in the phone business. “We did not enter the search business,” he  said. “They entered the phone business. Make no mistake. They want to kill the  iPhone. We won’t let them.” A few minutes later, after the meeting moved on to  another topic, Jobs returned to his tirade to attack Google’s famous values  slogan. “I want to go back to that other question first and say one more thing.  This ‘Don’t be evil’ mantra, it’s bullshit.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><h3>谷歌：开放与封闭</h3>

<p>2010年1月iPad发布后几天，乔布斯在苹果园区举行了员工大会。然而，他并没有为这款变革性的新产品欢欣鼓舞，反而开始痛斥谷歌，因其决定进入手机领域与苹果竞争，并开发了安卓操作系统。乔布斯对此十分愤怒。“我们没有涉足捜索领域，”他说，“他们却进入了手机业务。没错，他们想要终结iPhone,我们不会让他们得逞。”几分钟后，当会议进入到别的议题时，乔布斯又转回去长篇大论地攻击谷歌的著名价值观口号。“我想回到刚才的话题再说一件事。这个‘不作恶’的口号就是扯淡。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs felt personally  betrayed. Google’s CEO Eric Schmidt had been on the Apple board during the  development of the iPhone and iPad, and Google’s founders, Larry Page and  Sergey Brin, had treated him as a mentor. He felt ripped off. Android’s  touchscreen interface was adopting more and more of the features—multi-touch, swiping,  a grid of app icons—that Apple had created.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯觉得自己遭到了背叛。在iPhone和iPad研发期间，谷歌公司CEO埃里克·施密特是苹果的董事会成员；谷歌公司的两位创始人拉里·佩奇和谢尔盖·布林（SergeyBrin）视施密特为良师益友。乔布斯感到被利用了。安卓的触摸屏界面正在越来越多地采用苹果首创的功能——多点触摸、滑动操作、应用程序图标网格。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs had tried to  dissuade Google from developing Android. He had gone to Google’s headquarters  near Palo Alto in 2008 and gotten into a shouting match with Page, Brin, and  the head of the Android development team, Andy Rubin. (Because Schmidt was then  on the Apple board, he recused himself from discussions involving the iPhone.)  “I said we would, if we had good relations, guarantee Google access to the  iPhone and guarantee it one or two icons on the home screen,” he recalled. But  he also threatened that if Google continued to develop Android and used any  iPhone features, such as multi-touch, he would sue. At first Google avoided  copying certain features, but in January 2010 HTC introduced an Android phone that  boasted multi-touch and many other aspects of the iPhone’s look and feel. That  was the context for Jobs’s pronouncement that Google’s “Don’t be evil” slogan  was “bullshit.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>在谷歌研发安卓一事上，乔布斯曾努力劝阻。2008年，他曾前往与帕洛奥图相距不远的谷歌总部，与佩奇、布林，以及安卓研发团队负责人安迪·鲁宾（AndyRubin）大吵了一架。由于施密特当时是苹果董事会成员，他回避了一切关于iPhone的讨论。“我曾说，如果保持良好关系的话，我们会保证谷歌在iPhone上的入口，并会在iPhone主屏幕上为谷歌放置一两个图标。”乔布斯回忆道。不过他也威胁，如果谷歌继续研发安卓并使用任何iPhone的功能，如多点触控，他会发起诉讼。起初，谷歌避免复制某些功能；但是2010年1月，宏达电子（HTC）推出了一款安卓手机，并大张旗鼓地宣扬其多点触控功能以及与iPhone在观感上的诸多相似之处。乔布斯就是在这种背景下认为谷歌的“不作恶”口号就是“扯淡”。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>So Apple filed suit  against HTC (and, by extension, Android), alleging infringement of twenty of  its patents. Among them were patents covering various multi-touch gestures,  swipe to open, double-tap to zoom, pinch and expand, and the sensors that  determined how a device was being held. As he sat in his house in Palo Alto the  week the lawsuit was filed, he became angrier than I had ever seen him:</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>于是，苹果起诉了宏达电子，并将安卓作为连带起诉对象，称其侵犯了苹果20项专利。被侵犯的专利包括多点触控、滑动解锁、通过双触点滑动进行缩放，以及判断手持姿态传感器。在发起诉讼当周，乔布斯坐在帕洛奥图的家中，我从未见过他如此生气：</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Our  lawsuit is saying, “Google, you fucking ripped off the iPhone, wholesale ripped  us off.” Grand theft. I will spend my last dying breath if I need to, and I  will spend every penny of Apple’s $40 billion in the bank, to right this wrong.  I’m going to destroy Android, because it’s a stolen product. I’m willing to go  to thermonuclear war on this. They are scared to death, because they know they  are guilty. Outside of Search, Google’s products—Android, Google Docs—are shit.</p>

</div>
<div class="right"><p>我们的诉讼是这样说的，“谷歌，你他妈的抄袭了iPhone，完全抄袭了我们。”这是偷窈。如果有必要，就算用尽最后一口气，花光苹果账户上的400亿美元，我也要纠正这个错误。我要摧毁安卓，因为它是偷来的产品。我愿意为此发动核战争。他们怕得要死，因为他们知道自己有罪。除了搜索引擎，谷歌的产品，包括安卓和GoogleDocs,都是狗屎。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

  <p>A few days after this  rant, Jobs got a call from Schmidt, who had resigned from the Apple board the  previous summer. He suggested they get together for coffee, and they met at a  café in a Palo Alto shopping center. “We spent half the time talking about  personal matters, then half the time on his perception that Google had stolen  Apple’s user interface designs,” recalled Schmidt. When it came to the latter  subject, Jobs did most of the talking. Google had ripped him off, he said in  colorful language. “We’ve got you red-handed,” he told Schmidt. “I’m not  interested in settling. I don’t want your money. If you offer me $5 billion, I  won’t want it. I’ve got plenty of money. I want you to stop using our ideas in  Android, that’s all I want.” They resolved nothing.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>几天后，乔布斯接到了施密特的电话，他在2009年夏天就已退出苹果董事会。施密特提议两人一起喝杯咖啡，于是他们在帕洛奥图购物中心的一个咖啡厅里会面。“我们一半的时间都在聊着个人问题，剩下一半时间就是乔布斯在说谷歌偷窃苹果用户界面设计的事。”施密特回忆说。当谈论到后面这个话题时，大部分时间都是乔布斯在说话。他说谷歌欺骗了他，言语中五味杂陈。“我们把你们抓了个正着。”他对施密特说，“我对和解没有兴趣。我不想要你们的钱。就算你们拿出50亿美元要求和解，我也不会要的。我有的是钱，我要你们停止在安卓上使用我们的创意，这才是我想要的。”两人的谈话没有解决任何问题。</p></div></div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Underlying the dispute  was an even more fundamental issue, one that had unnerving historical  resonance. Google presented Android as an “open” platform; its open-source code  was freely available for multiple hardware makers to use on whatever phones or  tablets they built. Jobs, of course, had a dogmatic belief that Apple should  closely integrate its operating systems with its hardware. In the 1980s Apple  had not licensed out its Macintosh operating system, and Microsoft eventually  gained dominant market share by licensing its system to multiple hardware  makers and, in Jobs’s mind, ripping off Apple’s interface.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>这场争端的背后有着更深刻的问题及其令人不安的历史渊源。谷歌将安卓作为一个“开放”平台；各个硬件制造商都可以在自己的手机和平板电脑上免费使用它的开源代码。乔布斯则信奉苹果应该将其操作系统与硬件封闭地整合起来。20世纪80年代，苹果没有授权他人使用麦金塔操作系统，而微软则将其操作系统授权给多个硬件制造商使用，并最终主宰了操作系统市场；在乔布斯看来，微软的操作系统剽窃了苹果的界面。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The comparison between  what Microsoft wrought in the 1980s and what Google was trying to do in 2010  was not exact, but it was close enough to be unsettling—and infuriating. It  exemplified the great debate of the digital age: closed versus open, or as Jobs  framed it, integrated versus fragmented. Was it better, as Apple believed and  as Jobs’s own controlling perfectionism almost compelled, to tie the hardware  and software and content handling into one tidy system that assured a simple  user experience? Or was it better to give users and manufacturers more choice  and free up avenues for more innovation, by creating software systems that  could be modified and used on different devices? “Steve has a particular way  that he wants to run Apple, and it’s the same as it was twenty years ago, which  is that Apple is a brilliant innovator of closed systems,” Schmidt later told  me. “They don’t want people to be on their platform without permission. The  benefits of a closed platform is control. But Google has a specific belief that  open is the better approach, because it leads to more options and competition  and consumer choice.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>将微软在20世纪80年代的所做和谷歌在2010年的所为放在一起比较虽不恰当，但也足以令人不安和愤怒。这体现了数字时代的大辩论：封闭还是开放，或者用乔布斯的话来说，一体化还是碎片化。是像苹果所主张的以及乔布斯自身完美主义的控制欲所推动的那样，将硬件、软件和内容都整合在一个干净漂亮的系统中以确保简洁的用户体验，还是通过创造能够在不同设备上修改使用的软件系统，让用户和制造商都拥有更多选择并释放更多创新？施密特后来对我说：“史蒂夫管理苹果有其独特的方式，和20年前一样，苹果是封闭系统的优秀创新者，他们不希望别人在未经许可的情况下进入自己的平台。封闭平台的好处就是控制。但是谷歌相信，开放是更好的方式，因为这能带来更多可能性和竞争，并给予消费者更多选择。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>So what did Bill Gates  think as he watched Jobs, with his closed strategy, go into battle against  Google, as he had done against Microsoft twenty-five years earlier? “There are  some benefits to being more closed, in terms of how much you control the  experience, and certainly at times he’s had the benefit of that,” Gates told  me. But refusing to license the Apple iOS, he added, gave competitors like  Android the chance to gain greater volume. In addition, he argued, competition  among a variety of devices and manufacturers leads to greater consumer choice  and more innovation. “These companies are not all building pyramids next to  Central Park,” he said, poking fun at Apple’s Fifth Avenue store, “but they are  coming up with innovations based on competing for consumers.” Most of the  improvements in PCs, Gates pointed out, came because consumers had a lot of  choices, and that would someday be the case in the world of mobile devices.  “Eventually, I think, open will succeed, but that’s where I come from. In the  long run, the coherence thing, you can’t stay with that.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>25年前，乔布斯就曾为了其封闭策略向微软宣战，现在他又向谷歌宣战；比尔·盖茨看到此情此景有何感想呢？“从控制用户体验的角度来说，更为封闭的系统会有一些好处；当然，他有时也确实从中获益。”盖茨对我说。但是，他补充道，苹果拒绝授杈iOS操作系统，这一行为让竞争对手，如安卓，有机会获得更大的市场空间。此外他还认为，各类设备和制造商之间的竞争，能够带来更多创新，给消费者更多选择。“并非每家公司都会在中央公园附近建造金碧辉煌的门店。”盖茨拿苹果在第五大道的专卖店打趣道，“但是，为了争夺用户，他们总会有所创新。”盖茨指出，个人电脑的大多数进步都是因为消费者有很多选择，而总有一天，移动设备领域也会如此。“我认为，开放的方式最终会成功，不过这是从我的经历而言的。从长远来看，一以贯之的事物，你没法一直做下去。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs believed in “the  coherence thing.” His faith in a controlled and closed environment remained  unwavering, even as Android gained market share. “Google says we exert more  control than they do, that we are closed and they are open,” he railed when I  told him what Schmidt had said. “Well, look at the results—Android’s a mess. It  has different screen sizes and versions, over a hundred permutations.” Even if  Google’s approach might eventually win in the marketplace, Jobs found it  repellent. “I like being responsible for the whole user experience. We do it  not to make money. We do it because we want to make great products, not crap  like Android.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯则相信“一以贯之的事物”。即使安卓正在赢得市场份额，他却丝毫没有动摇，仍然推崇控制和封闭的环境。当我把施密特的说法告诉乔布斯后，他指责道：“谷歌说我们比他们施加了更多的控制，我们是封闭的，他们是开放的。好吧，我们来看看结果——安卓一团糟。安卓系统的手机屏幕大小和版本都不同，有上百种样子。”即使谷歌的做法最终会赢得市场，乔布斯也非常排斥。“我喜欢为整个用户体验负责。我们做这些不是为钱，而是因为我们想要创造伟大的产品，而非安卓这样的垃圾。”</p></div></div>

 

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><h3><a name="s2" id="s2"></a>Flash, the App Store, and Control</h3>
<p>Jobs’s insistence on  end-to-end control was manifested in other battles as well. At the town hall  meeting where he attacked Google, he also assailed Adobe’s multimedia platform  for websites, Flash, as a “buggy” battery hog made by “lazy” people. The iPod  and iPhone, he said, would never run Flash. “Flash is a spaghetti-ball piece of  technology that has lousy performance and really bad security problems,” he  said to me later that week.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><h3>Flash,应用程序商店，以及控制</h3>

<p>乔布斯坚持端到端的控制也体现在其他斗争中。在员工大会上，他不仅攻击了谷歌，也抨击了Adobe公司的网站多媒体平台Flash，认为它是“懶人”做出来的东西，“漏洞多”，耗电高。他表示，iPod和iPhone永远不会运行Flash。“Flash在技术上一团糟，性能差，并且有严重的安全问题。”他在同一周这样对我说。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>He even banned apps  that made use of a compiler created by Adobe that translated Flash code so that  it would be compatible with Apple’s iOS. Jobs disdained the use of compilers  that allowed developers to write their products once and have them ported to  multiple operating systems. “Allowing Flash to be ported across platforms means  things get dumbed down to the lowest common denominator,” he said. “We spend  lots of effort to make our platform better, and the developer doesn’t get any  benefit if Adobe only works with functions that every platform has. So we said  that we want developers to take advantage of our better features, so that their  apps work better on our platform than they work on anybody else’s.” On that he  was right. Losing the ability to differentiate Apple’s platforms—allowing them  to become commoditized like HP and Dell machines—would have meant death for the  company.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯甚至封掉了那些借助Adobe官方提供的转码器将Flash代码编译为能适用于苹果iOS系统的应用。他鄙视编译器，开发者只用编写一次代码，然后通过编译器就能把代码移植到多个操作系统中去。“允许Flash跨平台移植，这意味着产品受限于所有平台都必须支持的特性，因而只能是平庸至极的，”乔布斯说，“我们花费了很多精力让我们的平台变得更好，如果Adobe只能和所有平台都有的功能兼容，那么开发者根本得不到任何好处。因此我们希望开发者利用苹果更好的特性，这样，在我们的平台上，他们的应用程序能比在其他平台上运行得更好。”在这个问题上，他是正确的。如果苹果放弃了让平台与众不同的能力——允许它们像惠普和戴尔的机器一样变成大路货——那这也意味着苹果自身的死亡。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>There was, in  addition, a more personal reason. Apple had invested in Adobe in 1985, and  together the two companies had launched the desktop publishing revolution. “I  helped put Adobe on the map,” Jobs claimed. In 1999, after he returned to  Apple, he had asked Adobe to start making its video editing software and other  products for the iMac and its new operating system, but Adobe refused. It  focused on making its products for Windows. Soon after, its founder, John  Warnock, retired. “The soul of Adobe disappeared when Warnock left,” Jobs said.  “He was the inventor, the person I related to. It’s been a bunch of suits since  then, and the company has turned out crap.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>此外，还有一个个人原因。1985年，苹果投资了Adobe公司，两家企业联手发起了桌面出版革命。“我帮助Adobe公司成名。”乔布斯称。1999年重回苹果后，乔布斯让Adobe公司为iMac及其新操作系统制作视频编辑软件和其他产品，但是Adobe拒绝了，并专注于为Windows开发产品。不久之后，Adobe公司的创始人约翰·沃诺克（JohnWamoek）退休了。“沃诺克离开后，Adobe公司的灵魂也消失了。”乔布斯说，“他是我愿与之打交道的创新者。他走以后，留下的只是一群西装革履的家伙，Adobe公司也变成了垃圾。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>When Adobe evangelists  and various Flash supporters in the blogosphere attacked Jobs for being too  controlling, he decided to write and post an open letter. Bill Campbell, his  friend and board member, came by his house to go over it. “Does it sound like  I’m just trying to stick it to Adobe?” he asked Campbell. “No, it’s facts, just  put it out there,” the coach said. Most of the letter focused on the technical  drawbacks of Flash. But despite Campbell’s coaching, Jobs couldn’t resist  venting at the end about the problematic history between the two companies.  “Adobe was the last major third party developer to fully adopt Mac OS X,” he  noted.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>博客圈的Adobe布道者和Flash支持者开始抨击乔布斯，认为他的控制欲太过火了。于是，乔布斯决定撰写并发表一封公开信。他的朋友，苹果董事会成员比尔·坎贝尔专程前往乔布斯家中通读这封信。“是不是有种我在给Adobe挑刺的感觉？”他问坎贝尔。“不，你写的都是事实，就这样吧。”坎贝尔回答道。这封公开信大多着眼于Flash的技术缺陷。尽管有坎贝尔的指点，但是乔布斯在公开信的结尾处还是禁不住感慨于两家公司之间的历史纠葛。他指出：“Adobe是最后一家完整采纳MacOSX标准的大型第三方软件开发商。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Apple ended up lifting  some of its restrictions on cross-platform compilers later in the year, and  Adobe was able to come out with a Flash authoring tool that took advantage of  the key features of Apple’s iOS. It was a bitter war, but one in which Jobs had  the better argument. In the end it pushed Adobe and other developers of  compilers to make better use of the iPhone and iPad interface and its special  features.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>那年晚些时候，苹果提高了对跨平台编译器的一些限制，而Adobe公司则推出了能够利用苹果iOS系统主要特性的Flash创作软件。这是一场痛苦的战争，但乔布斯占据了更大主动权。最后，它推动了Adobe和其他编译器开发者更好地利用iPhone和iPad的界面及其特性。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs had a tougher  time navigating the controversies over Apple’s desire to keep tight control  over which apps could be downloaded onto the iPhone and iPad. Guarding against  apps that contained viruses or violated the user’s privacy made sense;  preventing apps that took users to other websites to buy subscriptions, rather  than doing it through the iTunes Store, at least had a business rationale. But  Jobs and his team went further: They decided to ban any app that defamed  people, might be politically explosive, or was deemed by Apple’s censors to be  pornographic.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>而当苹果意欲严格控制哪些应用程序可以下载到iPhone和iPad上时，乔布斯承受了更大的压力。防范含有病毒或侵犯用户隐私的应用程序理所当然；要求涉及订阅的应用程序必须让用户通过iTunes商店订阅而不能跳转至其他网站进行订阅也有其商业上的道理。但是乔布斯及其团队更进一步：他们决定禁止任何诋毁他人的应用程序，不论是具有政治争议性的，还是被苹果审查员视为含有淫秽内容的。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The problem of playing  nanny became apparent when Apple rejected an app featuring the animated  political cartoons of Mark Fiore, on the rationale that his attacks on the Bush  administration’s policy on torture violated the restriction against defamation.  Its decision became public, and was subjected to ridicule, when Fiore won the  2010 Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartooning in April. Apple had to reverse  itself, and Jobs made a public apology. “We’re guilty of making mistakes,” he  said. “We’re doing the best we can, we’re learning as fast as we can—but we  thought this rule made sense.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>当一个以马克·菲奥里（MarkFiore）的政治漫画为蓝本开发的应用程序被拒时，苹果试图扮演保姆的问题就凸显出来了。该应用因攻击布什政府的虐囚政策而被认为违反了不许诋毁他人的禁令。2010年4月，菲奥里臝得了普利策社论漫画奖，苹果的决定也被公之于众，并遭到嘲笑。苹果不得不收回成命，乔布斯也公开致歉。“我们对自己的错误感到愧疚，”他说，“我们尽可能做到最好，也尽可能快地学习一但我们的确曾以为这条规定是有道理的。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>It was more than a  mistake. It raised the specter of Apple’s controlling what apps we got to see  and read, at least if we wanted to use an iPad or iPhone. Jobs seemed in danger  of becoming the Orwellian Big Brother he had gleefully destroyed in Apple’s “1984” Macintosh ad. He took the issue  seriously. One day he called the <em>New York Times</em> columnist Tom Friedman  to discuss how to draw lines without looking like a censor. He asked Friedman  to head an advisory group to help come up with guidelines, but the columnist’s  publisher said it would be a conflict of interest, and no such committee was  formed.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>这已经不仅仅是一个错误了。如果我们想用iPad或iPhone，那么苹果就能控制我们可以看到和下载的应用程序。乔布斯似乎又成为奥威尔笔下的老大哥的危险，而也正是他在麦金塔的“1984”广告中令人欢欣鼓舞地摧毁了老大哥。乔布斯对这个问题十分上心。有一天，他打电话给《纽约时报》的专栏作家汤姆·弗里德曼（TomFriedman），讨论如何画定界线却又不至于落得审查者的臭名。他要弗里德曼畨领一个咨询小组，帮助自己画定界线；但是弗里德曼的出版商表示，这样做存在利益冲突的问题，因此咨询小组的事情也就不了了之。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The pornography ban  also caused problems. “We believe we have a moral responsibility to keep porn  off the iPhone,” Jobs declared in an email to a customer. “Folks who want porn  can buy an Android.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>色情作品禁令也带来了麻烦。“我们相信，苹果有道德责任让色情远离iPhone，”乔布斯在回复一位消费者的邮件时写道，“需要色情的人可以用安卓。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>This prompted an email  exchange with Ryan Tate, the editor of the tech gossip site Valleywag. Sipping  a stinger cocktail one evening, Tate shot off an email to Jobs decrying Apple’s  heavy-handed control over which apps passed muster. “If Dylan was 20 today, how  would he feel about your company?” Tate asked. “Would he think the iPad had the  faintest thing to do with ‘revolution’? Revolutions are about freedom.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>这引发了瑞安·泰特（RyanTate）与乔布斯的电子邮件对话；泰特是科技八卦网站诖谷闲话（Valleywag）的编辑。一天晚上，泰特喝着鸡尾酒，给乔布斯发了一封电子邮件，谴责苹果公司严格控制用户所能下载的应用程序。“如果迪伦今天是20岁的话，他会怎么评价你的公司？”泰特质问道，“他是否会认为iPad和‘革命’根本没什么关系？革命的核心是自由。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>To Tate’s surprise,  Jobs responded a few hours later, after midnight. “Yep,” he said, “freedom from  programs that steal your private data. Freedom from programs that trash your  battery. Freedom from porn. Yep, freedom. The times they are a changin’, and  some traditional PC folks feel like their world is slipping away. It is.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>出乎意料的是，几个小时后，即午夜过后，乔布斯对泰特进行了回复。“没错，”他说，“远离那些窃取用户私人数据程序的自由，远离那些榨干电池电量的程序的自由，远离色情的自由。是的，自由。时代在变①一些传统的个人电脑使用者觉得他们的世界正在逝去。没错。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>In his reply, Tate  offered some thoughts on Flash and other topics, then returned to the  censorship issue. “And you know what? I don’t want ‘freedom from porn.’ Porn is  just fine! And I think my wife would agree.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>泰特在回复中提到了对于Flash和其他话题的看法，然后又回到了审查问题。“你知道吗？我不想要‘远离色情的自由’。色情有什么不好的！我觉得我妻子也会同意。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>“You might care more  about porn when you have kids,” replied Jobs. “It’s not about freedom, it’s  about Apple trying to do the right thing for its users.” At the end he added a  zinger: “By the way, what have you done that’s so great? Do you create  anything, or just criticize others’ work and belittle their motivations?”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯回复道：“等你有了孩子，可能就会关心色情的问题了。这与自由无关，苹果是在为用户做正确的事情。”末了，他反驳道：“顺便问一旬，你又干过什么了不起的事情？你创造过什么东西没？还是说你只会批评其他人的工作、贬低他人的动机？”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Tate admitted to being  impressed. “Rare is the CEO who will spar one-on-one with customers and  bloggers like this,” he wrote. “Jobs deserves big credit for breaking the mold  of the typical American executive, and not just because his company makes such  hugely superior products: Jobs not only built and then rebuilt his company  around some very strong opinions about digital life, but he’s willing to defend  them in public. Vigorously. Bluntly. At two in the morning on a weekend.” Many  in the blogosphere agreed, and they sent Jobs emails praising his feistiness.  Jobs was proud as well; he forwarded his exchange with Tate and some of the  kudos to me.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>泰特承认这给自己留下了深刻的印象。“很少有CEO会这样同消费者和博客写手一对一地交流，”他写道，“乔布斯打破了一般的美国高管模式，他应该为此受到赞誉，而不仅仅因为他的企业做出了如此卓越的产品：他依照自己对于数字生活的强烈意志创建并重建了自己的公司，而且他愿意公开辩护自己的观点——大力地，直言不讳地，在周末凌晨两点这个时段。”博客圈中许多人也赞同这一说法，他们给乔布斯发邮件赞扬他的争论精神。乔布斯也很自豪，他把同泰特的往来邮件和一些称赞转发给了我。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">

<p>Still, there was  something unnerving about Apple’s decreeing that those who bought their  products shouldn’t look at controversial political cartoons or, for that  matter, porn. The humor site eSarcasm.com launched a “Yes, Steve, I want porn”  web campaign. “We are dirty, sex-obsessed miscreants who need access to smut 24  hours a day,” the site declared. “Either that, or we just enjoy the idea of an  uncensored, open society where a techno-dictator doesn’t decide what we can and  cannot see.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>尽管如此，对于苹果公司禁止用户查看富有争议的政治漫画和色情作品，人们仍然感到不安。幽默网站eSarcasm.com发起了一项网络运动，名为“是的，史蒂夫，我想要色情作品”。网站宣称，“我们是肮脏、痴迷色欲的恶徒，需要一天24小时接触淫秽内容。或者，我们只是想要一个没有审查的开放社会，一个不由技术独裁者决定我们能看什么不能看什么的社会。”</p></div></div>

<p>At the time Jobs and  Apple were engaged in a battle with Valleywag’s affiliated website, Gizmodo,  which had gotten hold of a test version of the unreleased iPhone 4 that a  hapless Apple engineer had left in a bar. When the police, responding to  Apple’s complaint, raided the house of the reporter, it raised the question of  whether control freakiness had combined with arrogance.</p>

<p>Jon Stewart was a  friend of Jobs and an Apple fan. Jobs had visited him privately in February  when he took his trip to New York to meet with media executives. But that  didn’t stop Stewart from going after him on <em>The Daily Show.</em> “It wasn’t  supposed to be this way! Microsoft was supposed to be the evil one!” Stewart  said, only half-jokingly. Behind him, the word “appholes” appeared on the  screen. “You guys were the rebels, man, the underdogs. But now, are you becoming  The Man? Remember back in 1984, you had those awesome ads about overthrowing  Big Brother? Look in the mirror, man!”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔恩·斯图尔特是乔布斯的朋友，也是果粉。2010年2月乔布斯前往纽约会见传媒高管时，曾私下拜访斯图尔特。但这也没能阻止斯图尔特在《每日秀》（TheDailyShow）中将矛头对准乔布斯。“事情不应该是这样的！微软才应该是邪恶的那个！”斯图尔特半开玩笑地说道。他身后的屏幕上出现了“appholes”②的字样。“哥们儿，你们曾是反叛者，是处于弱势的人。但是现在，你们倒成了老大哥了？还记得‘1984’广告吗，推翻了老大哥的牛x广告？照照镜子啊，兄弟！”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>By late spring the  issue was being discussed among board members. “There is an arrogance,” Art  Levinson told me over lunch just after he had raised it at a meeting. “It ties  into Steve’s personality. He can react viscerally and lay out his convictions  in a forceful manner.” Such arrogance was fine when Apple was the feisty  underdog. But now Apple was dominant in the mobile market. “We need to make the  transition to being a big company and dealing with the hubris issue,” said  Levinson. Al Gore also talked about the problem at board meetings. “The context  for Apple is changing dramatically,” he recounted. “It’s not hammer-thrower  against Big Brother. Now Apple’s big, and people see it as arrogant.” Jobs  became defensive when the topic was raised. “He’s still adjusting to it,” said  Gore. “He’s better at being the underdog than being a humble giant.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>同年春末的时候，董事会成员也开始讨论这个问题。亚瑟·莱文森在董事会会议上提出了这个问题。之后他在一次午餐的时候告诉我说：“史蒂夫的态度有些傲慢，这是他个性使然。他会本能地反抗，有力地摆出自己的信念。”在苹果还是充满反抗意识的弱势企业时，这种傲慢态度没什么问題。但是现在，苹果已经是移动市场的主导者了。“我们需要转变心态，符合自己大企业的身份，并处理狂妄傲慢的问题。”莱文森表示。阿尔·戈尔也在董事会会议上谈到了这个问题。“苹果的境况正发生巨大改变他回忆道，“它不再是向老大哥挥锤的人了。现在，苹果公司做大了，人们认为它傲慢嚣张。”一且涉及这个问题时，乔布斯就变得很防备。“他还在调整，”戈尔说，“他更善于做一个处于弱势的人，而不是谦逊的巨人。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs had little  patience for such talk. The reason Apple was being criticized, he told me then,  was that “companies like Google and Adobe are lying about us and trying to tear  us down.” What did he think of the suggestion that Apple sometimes acted  arrogantly? “I’m not worried about that,” he said, “because we’re not  arrogant.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>对于这类谈话，乔布斯亳无耐心。他告诉我，人们之所以批评苹果，是因为“谷歌和Adobe这样的公司在污蔑我们，企图摧毁我们”。那么对于人们认为苹果有时太傲慢的看法，他怎么看呢？“我对此毫不担心，”他说，“因为我们不傲慢。”——

<div class="left"><h3><a name="s3" id="s3"></a>Antennagate: Design versus Engineering</h3>
<p>In many consumer  product companies, there’s tension between the designers, who want to make a  product look beautiful, and the engineers, who need to make sure it fulfills  its functional requirements. At Apple, where Jobs pushed both design and  engineering to the edge, that tension was even greater.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><h3>天线门：设计与工程谁说了算</h3>
<p>在许多消费类产品企业中，设计师和工程师之间关系紧张；设计师想要产品美观，工程师需要确保产品满足功能需求。在苹果，乔布斯将两者都推向了极致，因此设计师和工程师之间的关系更为紧张。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>When he and design  director Jony Ive became creative coconspirators back in 1997, they tended to  view the qualms expressed by engineers as evidence of a can’t-do attitude that  needed to be overcome. Their faith that awesome design could force superhuman  feats of engineering was reinforced by the success of the iMac and iPod. When  engineers said something couldn’t be done, Ive and Jobs pushed them to try, and  usually they succeeded. There were occasional small problems. The iPod Nano,  for example, was prone to getting scratched because Ive believed that a clear  coating would lessen the purity of his design. But that was not a crisis.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>1997年，他和设计总监乔尼·艾弗共同进行创意决策，他们常常认为，工程师需要克服那种觉得某事做不了的怀疑态度。iMac和iPod的成功，让他们更加坚偏自己的信念——了不起的设计能够激发工程师做出超人的壮举。每当工程师表示有些事情做不了时，艾弗和乔布斯就会逼迫他们努力尝试，通常都成功了。但偶尔会有些小问题。例如，艾弗认为涂层会削弱自己设计的纯粹性，从而让iPodNano很容易被刮花。但这并没有给苹果公司造成危机。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>When it came to  designing the iPhone, Ive’s design desires bumped into a fundamental law of  physics that could not be changed even by a reality distortion field. Metal is  not a great material to put near an antenna. As Michael Faraday showed,  electromagnetic waves flow around the surface of metal, not through it. So a  metal enclosure around a phone can create what is known as a Faraday cage,  diminishing the signals that get in or out. The original iPhone started with a  plastic band at the bottom, but Ive thought that would wreck the design  integrity and asked that there be an aluminum rim all around. After that ended  up working out, Ive designed the iPhone 4 with a steel rim. The steel would be  the structural support, look really sleek, and serve as part of the phone’s  antenna.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>在设计iPhone的时候，艾弗的设计欲望撞上一个不可能被现实扭曲力场改变的物理学基本法则——金属不宜放在天线附近。物理学家迈克尔·法拉第（MichaelFaraday）已经证实，电磁波在传播的过程中会绕过金属的表面，而无法穿过金属。因此，用金属外壳包裹手机会造成“法拉第笼”（FaradayCage）的现象，削弱进出的信号。起初，iPhone的设计是在底部使用塑料壳；但是，艾弗认为这会破坏设计的完整性，要求全部使用铝质材料。这样的做法成功了，于是，在设计iPhone4时，艾弗要求使用钢圈。钢圈是机身的支撑结构，看上去很圆滑，并部分充当手机天线。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>There were significant  challenges. In order to serve as an antenna, the steel rim had to have a tiny  gap. But if a person covered that gap with a finger or sweaty palm, there could  be some signal loss. The engineers suggested a clear coating over the metal to  help prevent this, but again Ive felt that this would detract from the  brushed-metal look. The issue was presented to Jobs at various meetings, but he  thought the engineers were crying wolf. You can make this work, he said. And so  they did.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>这就有个大问题。要作为天线使用，钢圈必须有一个微小的缝隙。但是，如果用户的手指或汗湿的手掌遮住了这个缝隙，就会造成信号损失。工程师建议在钢圈外部喷上涂层，以防止该问题的出现，但是艾弗认为这会影响拉丝金属的外观。iPhone团队在各种会议土都向乔布斯反映了这个问题，但是乔布斯认为工程师们只是在玩狼来了的把戏。他说，你们能行的。他们也确实做到了。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>And it worked, almost  perfectly. But not totally perfectly. When the iPhone 4 was released in June  2010, it looked awesome, but a problem soon became evident: If you held the  phone a certain way, especially using your left hand so your palm covered the  tiny gap, you could lose your connection. It occurred with perhaps one in a hundred  calls. Because Jobs insisted on keeping his unreleased products secret (even  the phone that Gizmodo scored in a bar had a fake case around it), the iPhone 4  did not go through the live testing that most electronic devices get. So the  flaw was not caught before the massive rush to buy it began. “The question is  whether the twin policies of putting design in front of engineering and having  a policy of supersecrecy surrounding unreleased products helped Apple,” Tony  Fadell said later. “On the whole, yes, but unchecked power is a bad thing, and  that’s what happened.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>解决方案近乎完美，但并非完美。iPhone4在2010年6月发布时看起来棒极了，但是问题很快就浮出了水面：如果用户以某种方式拿着手机，尤其是用左手拿着手机时，手掌就会盖住钢圈上的小缝隙，于是就会出现信号丢失的问题。这种问题发生的概率大機为1%。由于乔布斯要求对未发布的产品进行严格保密，就连Gizmodo网站在酒吧里拿到的那台测试机也装的是假外壳，iPhone4并没有像大多数电子设备一样进行实用测试。因此，在大众抢购之前，这一缺陷并没有被人发现。“问题在于，设计高于工程和对未发布产品进行高度保密的双重政策是否对苹果有益。”托尼·法德尔（TonyFadell）后来表示，“总的来说，这样做有好处；但是不受制约的杈力是件坏事，而事情就是这样的。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Had it not been the  Apple iPhone 4, a product that had everyone transfixed, the issue of a few  extra dropped calls would not have made news. But it became known as  “Antennagate,” and it boiled to a head in early July, when <em>Consumer Reports</em> did some rigorous tests and said that it could not recommend the iPhone 4  because of the antenna problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>一个普通手机出现一些信号丢失问题根本不会成为新闻；但这是iPhone4，是让所有人惊叹的产品。这一故障问题被大家称为“天线门”；7月初，《消费者报告》（ConsumerReports）进行了一些严格的测试，表示鉴于天线问题，不推荐消费者购买iPhone4；此举将“天线门”事件推向高xdx潮。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs was in Kona  Village, Hawaii, with his family when the issue arose. At first he was  defensive. Art Levinson was in constant contact by phone, and Jobs insisted  that the problem stemmed from Google and Motorola making mischief. “They want  to shoot Apple down,” he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>就在“天线门”炒得沸沸扬扬之时，乔布斯正和家人在夏威夷康娜度假村度假。最开始，他还在为自己和苹果公司辩护。亚瑟·莱文森接二连三地踉他通电话，乔布斯坚持认为，这是谷歌和摩托罗拉在作怪，“他们想要打倒苹果。”他说。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Levinson urged a  little humility. “Let’s try to figure out if there’s something wrong,” he said.  When he again mentioned the perception that Apple was arrogant, Jobs didn’t  like it. It went against his black-white, right-wrong way of viewing the world.  Apple was a company of principle, he felt. If others failed to see that, it was  their fault, not a reason for Apple to play humble.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>莱文森让他谦虚一点。“我们来看看到底是不是有问题。”他说。当他再次提到公众认为苹果公司态度傲慢时，乔布斯很不高兴。这违背了他非黑即白、是非分明的世界观。乔布斯认为苹果是一家讲原则的公司。如果别人看不到这点，那么是他们的错，苹果没有理由放低姿态。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs’s second reaction  was to be hurt. He took the criticism personally and became emotionally  anguished. “At his core, he doesn’t do things that he thinks are blatantly  wrong, like some pure pragmatists in our business,” Levinson said. “So if he  feels he’s right, he will just charge ahead rather than question himself.”  Levinson urged him not to get depressed. But Jobs did. “Fuck this, it’s not  worth it,” he told Levinson. Finally Tim Cook was able to shake him out of his  lethargy. He quoted someone as saying that Apple was becoming the new  Microsoft, complacent and arrogant. The next day Jobs changed his attitude.  “Let’s get to the bottom of this,” he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>紧接着，乔布斯觉得受到了伤害。他认为这些批评是针对他个人的，他感到很痛苦。“他内心深处认为，自己绝不会像某些商界的纯实用主义者那样去做一些明显错误的事情。”莱文森表示，“因此，如果他认为自己是对的，那么就会往前冲，而没有想过质疑自己。”莱文森劝他不要沮丧，但没有用。“去他妈的，这事根本不值得费这么大工夫。”他跟莱文森说。最后，蒂姆·库克让他从低落的情绪中摆脱出来。库克跟乔布斯说，有人认为苹果将成为另一个微软，自满又傲慢。第二天，乔布斯转变了态度。“让我们把这个问题弄个水落石出。”他说。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>When the data about  dropped calls were assembled from AT&amp;T, Jobs realized there was a problem,  even if it was more minor than people were making it seem. So he flew back from  Hawaii. But before he left, he made some phone calls. It was time to gather a  couple of trusted old hands, wise men who had been with him during the original  Macintosh days thirty years earlier.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>从AT&T收集到信号丢失的统计数据后，乔布斯意识到，虽然实际情况并没有舆论所声讨的那样夸张，但确实是个问题。于是，他从夏威夷飞回公司。不过在回去之前，他打了几通电话，召集了几个值得信赖的老手，那些30年前麦金塔创始团队的聪明人。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>His first call was to  Regis McKenna, the public relations guru. “I’m coming back from Hawaii to deal  with this antenna thing, and I need to bounce some stuff off of you,” Jobs told  him. They agreed to meet at the Cupertino boardroom at 1:30 the next afternoon.  The second call was to the adman Lee Clow. He had tried to retire from the  Apple account, but Jobs liked having him around. His colleague James Vincent  was summoned as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>他首先打给了公关老手里吉斯·麦肯纳。“我准备从夏威夷回来处理天线问题，需要你的意见。”乔布斯对他说。他们约好次日1点半在苹果会议室见面。第二个电话打给了广告人李·克劳。他曾想要放弃和苹果合作，但是乔布斯欣赏他并将其留下了。克劳的同事詹姆斯·文森特也收到了乔布斯的电话。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs also decided to  bring his son Reed, then a high school senior, back with him from Hawaii. “I’m  going to be in meetings 24/7 for probably two days and I want you to be in  every single one because you’ll learn more in those two days than you would in  two years at business school,” he told him. “You’re going to be in the room  with the best people in the world making really tough decisions and get to see  how the sausage is made.” Jobs got a little misty-eyed when he recalled the  experience. “I would go through that all again just for that opportunity to  have him see me at work,” he said. “He got to see what his dad does.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯还决定把儿子里德也带回公司一同参加会议；里德当时在读髙中四年级，刚和他从夏威夷回来。“我接下来两天会全天不停地开会，希望你也能来，这两天你能学到的东西比在商学院两年还多。”他对里德说，“你将会和世界上最优秀的人才共处一室，看看一切是如何运作的。”在回忆这段经历时，乔布斯有些热泪盈眶。“我愿意再经历一次这样的事件，只要让他有机会看看我工作时的样子。”他说，“他应该看看自己的父亲在做什么。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>They were joined by  Katie Cotton, the steady public relations chief at Apple, and seven other top  executives. The meeting lasted all afternoon. “It was one of the greatest  meetings of my life,” Jobs later said. He began by laying out all the data they  had gathered. “Here are the facts. So what should we do about it?”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>到会的还有苹果公司的公关主管，沉着冷静的凯蒂·科顿（KatieCotton）以及其他七名髙管。会议持续了整个下午。乔布斯后来回忆说：“这是我人生中最棒的会议之一。”会议一开始，他就拿出了自己收集的所有数据。“事实都摆在这儿，我们应该做些什么？”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>McKenna was the most  calm and straightforward. “Just lay out the truth, the data,” he said. “Don’t  appear arrogant, but appear firm and confident.” Others, including Vincent,  pushed Jobs to be more apologetic, but McKenna said no. “Don’t go into the  press conference with your tail between your legs,” he advised. “You should  just say: ‘Phones aren’t perfect, and we’re not perfect. We’re human and doing  the best we can, and here’s the data.’” That became the strategy. When the  topic turned to the perception of arrogance, McKenna urged him not to worry too  much. “I don’t think it would work to try to make Steve look humble,” McKenna  explained later. “As Steve says about himself, ‘What you see is what you get.’”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>麦肯纳最为沉着和直接，他说：“只需摆出事实和数据，不要表现得傲慢狂妄，但要坚定和自信。”其他人，包括文森特在内，都劝乔布斯表现得更有歉意些，但是麦肯纳不同意。他建议道：“不要夹着尾巴召开新闻发布会，你应该直接跟他们说，‘手机不完美，我们也不完美。我们是凡人，在尽自己最大的努力做事，而数据在这里。’”麦肯纳的提议被采用了。讨论到乔布斯的傲慢形象时，麦肯纳劝他不必多虑。“我不认为让乔布斯表现得谦卑一些就能解决问题。”麦肯纳后来解释道，“正如史蒂夫形容自己的那样，‘所见即所得’。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>At the press event  that Friday, held in Apple’s auditorium, Jobs followed McKenna’s advice. He did  not grovel or apologize, yet he was able to defuse the problem by showing that  Apple understood it and would try to make it right. Then he changed the  framework of the discussion, saying that all cell phones had some problems.  Later he told me that he had sounded a bit “too annoyed” at the event, but in  fact he was able to strike a tone that was unemotional and straightforward. He  captured it in four short, declarative sentences: “We’re not perfect. Phones  are not perfect. We all know that. But we want to make our users happy.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>周五，苹果在公司礼堂举办了新闻发布会，乔布斯采纳了麦肯纳的意见。他没有卑躬屈膝，也没有道歉，只表示苹果理解这个问题并会尽力改正，这样他就得以平息问题。接着，他话题一转，称所有手机都有些问题。后来他告诉我，自己在发布会上的语气有些“太恼怒”，但事实上，他的表述冷静而直接。他用了四个简短的陈述句：“我们不完美。手机不完美。我们都知道这一点。但是我们想要让用户满意。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>If anyone was unhappy,  he said, they could return the phone (the return rate turned out to be 1.7%,  less than a third of the return rate for the iPhone 3GS or most other phones)  or get a free bumper case from Apple. He went on to report data showing that  other mobile phones had similar problems. That was not totally true. Apple’s  antenna design made it slightly worse than most other phones, including earlier  versions of the iPhone. But it was true that the media frenzy over the iPhone 4’s dropped calls was overblown. “This is  blown so out of proportion that it’s incredible,” he said. Instead of being  appalled that he didn’t grovel or order a recall, most customers realized that  he was right.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>他表示，如果有人不满意，可以退货或者免费获得苹果提供的胶套。结果，iPhone4的退货率只有1.7%，还不到iPhone3GS和大多数其他手机退货率的1/3。在发布会上，他又接着报告了一些数据，表明其他手机也有类似问题。但这并不完全属实。苹果的天线设计让iPhone4比大多数手机的天线都要差一点，包括之前的iPhone版本。伹是，媒体对于iPhone4信号丢失的报道确实夸大其词了。“这捏造出来的数据令人难以置信。”他说。对于乔布斯既没卑躬屈膝，又没有责令召回，大多数消费者并没有感到震惊，相反他们认识到乔布斯是对的。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The wait list for the  phone, which was already sold out, went from two weeks to three. It remained  the company’s fastest-selling product ever. The media debate shifted to the  issue of whether Jobs was right to assert that other smartphones had the same  antenna problems. Even if the answer was no, that was a better story to face  than one about whether the iPhone 4 was a defective dud.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>iPhone4的存货巳经售罄，排在等候名单上的人们现在要等上三周时间——之前还只需要两周的时间。它成为苹果历史上销售最快的产品。乔布斯在发布会上断言其他智能手机也有同样的天线问题，媒体遂将话题转移至他的说法是否正确。即使乔布斯所言不实，这也比讨论iPhone4是否是个有缺陷的无用产品要好。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Some media observers  were incredulous. “In a bravura demonstration of stonewalling, righteousness,  and hurt sincerity, Steve Jobs successfully took to the stage the other day to  deny the problem, dismiss the criticism, and spread the blame among other  smartphone makers,” Michael Wolff of newser.com wrote. “This is a level of  modern marketing, corporate spin, and crisis management about which you can  only ask with stupefied incredulity and awe: How do they get away with it? Or,  more accurately, how does he get away with it?” Wolff attributed it to Jobs’s  mesmerizing effect as “the last charismatic individual.” Other CEOs would be  offering abject apologies and swallowing massive recalls, but Jobs didn’t have  to. “The grim, skeletal appearance, the absolutism, the ecclesiastical bearing,  the sense of his relationship with the sacred, really works, and, in this  instance, allows him the privilege of magisterially deciding what is meaningful  and what is trivial.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>一些媒体观察家对此感到难以置信。newser.com的迈克尔·沃尔夫（MichaelWolff）写道：“通过一场大胆的表演，乔布斯向人们展示了他的坚定、正义及无辜，从而成功地回避了问题，消除了批评，并将火引到了其他智能手机厂商身上。这是现代营销、企业公关和危机管理的新高度，你只能目瞪口呆充满敬意地问他们：你们是怎么成功摆脱问题的？或者更准确地说，他是如何摆脱问题的？”沃尔夫将其归功于乔布斯的洗脑能力，称他是“最具有魅力的人”。换做其他CEO会卑下地进行道歉，并大量召回问题产品，但乔布斯不必如此。“他冷酷痩削的外表，他的专制，宗教般的影响力，神一样的地位，使他有特权决定什么东西重要什么东西微不足道。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Scott Adams, the  creator of the cartoon strip <em>Dilbert</em>, was also incredulous, but far more  admiring. He wrote a blog entry a few days later (which Jobs proudly emailed  around) that marveled at how Jobs’s “high ground maneuver” was destined to be  studied as a new public relations standard. “Apple’s response to the iPhone 4  problem didn’t follow the public relations playbook, because Jobs decided to  rewrite the playbook,” Adams wrote. “If you want to know what genius looks  like, study Jobs’ words.” By proclaiming up front that phones are not perfect,  Jobs changed the context of the argument with an indisputable assertion. “If  Jobs had not changed the context from the iPhone 4 to all smartphones in  general, I could make you a hilarious comic strip about a product so poorly made  that it won’t work if it comes in contact with a human hand. But as soon as the  context is changed to ‘all smartphones have problems,’ the humor opportunity is  gone. Nothing kills humor like a general and boring truth.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>漫画《呆伯特》（Dilbert）的创作者斯科特·亚当斯（ScottAdams）也同样感到难以置信，不过更多的还是欣赏。几天后，他发表了一篇博客文章，惊叹乔布斯“占据制髙点的举动”，称其将会成为新的公关标准。乔布斯自豪地把这篇文章发送给很多人。“苹果对iPhone4问题的回应并未遵循公关套路，因为乔布斯决定重新改写规矩。”亚当斯写道，“如果你想知道天才什么样，研究一下乔布斯的措辞吧。”通过宣称手机都不完美，乔布斯用一个不争的事实改变了争论的语境。“如果乔布斯没有把问题从iPhone4引向所有智能手机，我可能会画一幅爆笑漫画，展示一款一拿到手里就无法使用的手机。但是，一旦问题变成了‘所有智能手机都存在问题’，幽默的机会也就随之溜走了。没有什么能比一般性的祜燥事实更能扼杀幽默了。”</p></div></div>

<div class="left"><h3><a name="s4" id="s4"></a>Here Comes the Sun</h3>
<p>There were a few  things that needed to be resolved for the career of Steve Jobs to be complete.  Among them was an end to the Thirty Years’ War with the band he loved, the  Beatles. In 2007 Apple had settled its trademark battle with Apple Corps, the  holding company of the Beatles, which had first sued the fledgling computer  company over use of the name in 1978. But that still did not get the Beatles  into the iTunes Store. The band was the last major holdout, primarily because  it had not resolved with EMI music, which owned most of its songs, how to  handle the digital rights.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><h3>太阳升起</h3>

<p>在乔布斯的职业生涯完满之前，有几件事情需要解决。其中一件就是结束与他喜爱的披头士乐队之间的“三十年战争”。2007年，苹果同苹果唱片公司就商标之争达成和解；该唱片公司是披头士的母公司。1978年，苹果唱片公司起诉刚刚起步的苹果计算机公司，称其使用自己的名字。但是商标案和解之后，披头士的音乐仍未进驻iTunes商店，成为唯一遗落在外的著名乐队。主要原因在于苹果唱片公司还未同百代音乐公司就如何处理数字版权达成一致，而百代音乐公司拥有披头士大部分歌曲的版权。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>By the summer of 2010  the Beatles and EMI had sorted things out, and a four-person summit was held in  the boardroom in Cupertino. Jobs and his vice president for the iTunes Store,  Eddy Cue, played host to Jeff Jones, who managed the Beatles’ interests, and  Roger Faxon, the chief of EMI music. Now that the Beatles were ready to go  digital, what could Apple offer to make that milestone special? Jobs had been  anticipating this day for a long time. In fact he and his advertising team, Lee  Clow and James Vincent, had mocked up some ads and commercials three years  earlier when strategizing on how to lure the Beatles on board.</p>

<div class="right"><p>2010年夏，披头士和百代音乐公司找到了解决方案，并与苹果举行了四人峰会。乔布斯和负责iTunes商店的副总裁埃迪·库埃主持会议，邀请了杰夫·琼斯（JeffJones）和罗杰·法克森（RogerFaxon）：琼斯代表披头士的利益，法克森是百代音乐公司的总裁。既然披头士已经准备好了进军数码市场，苹果会如何为这一里程碑添加一点儿传奇色彩呢？乔布斯期待这一天很久了。事实上，三年前在计划如何吸引披头士加入时，他就曾和广告团队、李·克劳及詹姆斯·文森特一起构思了一些广告创意。</p></div></div>

<p>“Steve and I thought  about all the things that we could possibly do,” Cue recalled. That included  taking over the front page of the iTunes Store, buying billboards featuring the  best photographs of the band, and running a series of television ads in classic  Apple style. The topper was offering a $149 box set that included all thirteen  Beatles studio albums, the two-volume “Past Masters” collection, and a nostalgia-inducing  video of the 1964 Washington Coliseum concert.</p>

<div class="right"><p>“史蒂夫和我想尽了一切能够做的事情。”库埃回忆道。其中包括重新设计iTunes商店主页，购买广告牌放上披头士乐队最好的照片，以及播放一系列经典苹果风格的电视广告。顶级的方案是一套价值149美元的套装产品，其中包括披头士的全部13张专辑，《昔日大师》（PastMasters）两张精选集，以及勾起人怀旧之情的1964年披头士华盛顿体育馆演唱会视频。</p></div></div>

<p>Once they reached an  agreement in principle, Jobs personally helped choose the photographs for the  ads. Each commercial ended with a still black-and-white shot of Paul McCartney  and John Lennon, young and smiling, in a recording studio looking down at a  piece of music. It evoked the old photographs of Jobs and Wozniak looking at an  Apple circuit board. “Getting the Beatles on iTunes was the culmination of why  we got into the music business,” said Cue.</p>

大体原则都达成一致后，乔布斯亲自帮助挑选了广告需要的照片。每个广告结尾都是一张黑白静照，年轻的保罗·麦卡特尼（PaulMcCartney）和约翰·列侬，微笑着，在录音棚里低头看一首乐曲。这使人想起了乔布斯和沃兹尼亚克的一张旧照，照片上是两人一起查看苹果电路板。库埃说：“让披头士进人iTunes是我们进入音乐业务的终极目标。”——
