<div class="left">  <h3><a name="s1" id="s1"></a>You Say You Want a Revolution</h3>
<p>Back in 2002, Jobs had  been annoyed by the Microsoft engineer who kept proselytizing about the tablet  computer software he had developed, which allowed users to input information on  the screen with a stylus or pen. A few manufacturers released tablet PCs that  year using the software, but none made a dent in the universe. Jobs had been  eager to show how it should be done right—no stylus!—but when he saw the  multi-touch technology that Apple was developing, he had decided to use it  first to make an iPhone.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<h3>你说你想要一场革命</h3>
<p>2002年，微软一位工程师把乔布斯惹毛了，他一直在吹嘘自己研发的平板电脑软件，用户可以用手写笔在屏幕上输入信息。当年，一些制造商推出了使用该款软件的平板电脑，但并未改变世界。乔布斯一直渴望向人们展示平板电脑的正确做法——没有手写笔！但是，当看到苹果公司正在研发的多点触摸技术后，他决定将其先用于iPhone。

　　</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>In the meantime, the  tablet idea was percolating within the Macintosh hardware group. “We have no  plans to make a tablet,” Jobs declared in an interview with Walt Mossberg in  May 2003. “It turns out people want keyboards. Tablets appeal to rich guys with  plenty of other PCs and devices already.” Like his statement about having a  “hormone imbalance,” that was misleading; at most of his annual Top 100  retreats, the tablet was among the future projects discussed. “We showed the  idea off at many of these retreats, because Steve never lost his desire to do a  tablet,” Phil Schiller recalled.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
当时，平板电脑的想法还只是在麦金塔硬件团队中酝酿。2003年5月，乔布斯接受沃尔特·莫斯伯格的采访时说我们没有制作平板电脑的计划。事实证明，入们需要键盘。只有那些已经有了许多电脑和计算机设备的有钱人才会对平板电脑感兴趣。”是的，他这是在误导竞争对手，就像宣称自己只是“荷尔蒙失调”一样。事实上，在苹果公司大多年度的百杰集思会上，平板电脑都被纳入未来项目的讨论之中。“我们在多次集思会上都会花大量时间讨论平板电脑的想法，因为史蒂夫一直渴望制作这样一款产品。”菲尔·席勒回忆道。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The tablet project got  a boost in 2007 when Jobs was considering ideas for a low-cost netbook  computer. At an executive team brainstorming session one Monday, Ive asked why  it needed a keyboard hinged to the screen; that was expensive and bulky. Put  the keyboard on the screen using a multi-touch interface, he suggested. Jobs  agreed. So the resources were directed to revving up the tablet project rather  than designing a netbook.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
2007年，乔布斯在考虑低成本上网本计划时，意外推动了平板电脑项目。在某个周一的一次头脑风暴会议上，艾弗说，为什么要在屏幕旁边装上键盘呢，那样又贵又笨重。他提议利用多点触摸界面，将键盘的功能纳入屏幕中。乔布斯对此表示赞同。于是，苹果公司放弃了设计上网本的想法，将资源投入平板电脑项目，令其快速运转起来。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The process began with  Jobs and Ive figuring out the right screen size. They had twenty models  made—all rounded rectangles, of course—in slightly varying sizes and aspect  ratios. Ive laid them out on a table in the design studio, and in the afternoon  they would lift the velvet cloth hiding them and play with them. “That’s how we  nailed what the screen size was,” Ive said.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
平板电脑项目伊始，乔布斯和艾弗需要研究出合适的屏幕尺寸。项目团队设计了20个模型——都是圆角矩形，但大小和长宽比赂有不同。艾弗将模型排列在设计工作室的桌子上。下午大家一到，就可以揭开罩在桌上的丝绒布，摆弄这些模型。“我们就是这样确定屏幕尺寸的。”艾弗说。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>As usual Jobs pushed  for the purest possible simplicity. That required determining what was the core  essence of the device. The answer: the display screen. So the guiding principle  was that everything they did had to defer to the screen. “How do we get out of  the way so there aren’t a ton of features and buttons that distract from the  display?” Ive asked. At every step, Jobs pushed to remove and simplify.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
乔布斯一如既往地主张最为纯粹的简洁设计。这就需要明确平板电脑的核心本质。答案就是显示屏。因此，平板电脑项目的指导原则即是，所有功能和设计都必须服从屏幕的需要。艾弗问道：“怎样才能不让众多功能和按钮分散对于屏幕显示的注意力？”在每一个步骤上，乔布斯都会推进删除和简化。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>At one point Jobs  looked at the model and was slightly dissatisfied. It didn’t feel casual and  friendly enough, so that you would naturally scoop it up and whisk it away. Ive  put his finger, so to speak, on the problem: They needed to signal that you could  grab it with one hand, on impulse. The bottom of the edge needed to be slightly  rounded, so that you’d feel comfortable just scooping it up rather than lifting  it carefully. That meant engineering had to design the necessary connection  ports and buttons in a simple lip that was thin enough to wash away gently  underneath.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
有一次，乔布斯看着模型，略有不满，认为模型不够自然和友好，无法让人随意地拿起来。艾弗敏锐地指出了问题所在：平板电脑的形状要让人觉得有冲动去拿，而且可以随意用一只手就抓起来。边缘的底部需要再圆润一点，这样会让人觉得拿起来很舒服，而不用小心翼翼地抬起来。这意味着，必须把必要的连接接口和按钮都设计在平板电脑的边缘，同时设备的边缘又很薄，薄到让人忘却它的存在。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>If you had been paying  attention to patent filings, you would have noticed the one numbered D504889  that Apple applied for in March 2004 and was issued fourteen months later.  Among the inventors listed were Jobs and Ive. The application carried sketches  of a rectangular electronic tablet with rounded edges, which looked just the  way the iPad turned out, including one of a man holding it casually in his left  hand while using his right index finger to touch the screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
关注专利申请的人应该会注意到，2004年3月，苹果公司申请了编号为D504889的专利，并于14个月后通过。这项专利的发明者是乔布斯和艾弗。专利申请中附有一张圆角矩形平板电脑的草图，草图上一个男子随意地用左手拿着这部平板电脑，右手食指触碰屏幕，图上的平板电脑看上去正是后来推出的iPad。

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

  <p>Since the Macintosh  computers were now using Intel chips, Jobs initially planned to use in the iPad  the low-voltage Atom chip that Intel was developing. Paul Otellini, Intel’s  CEO, was pushing hard to work together on a design, and Jobs’s inclination was  to trust him. His company was making the fastest processors in the world. But  Intel was used to making processors for machines that plugged into a wall, not  ones that had to preserve battery life. So Tony Fadell argued strongly for  something based on the ARM architecture, which was simpler and used less power.  Apple had been an early partner with ARM, and chips using its architecture were  in the original iPhone. Fadell gathered support from other engineers and proved  that it was possible to confront Jobs and turn him around. “Wrong, wrong,  wrong!” Fadell shouted at one meeting when Jobs insisted it was best to trust  Intel to make a good mobile chip. Fadell even put his Apple badge on the table,  threatening to resign.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
由于麦金塔电脑当时已开始使用英特尔公司的芯片，乔布斯最初计划在iPad中采用凌动芯片（Atom）——英特尔公司正在研发的低电压芯片。英特尔公司CEO保罗·欧德宁极力促成两家公司一起进行设计工作，乔布斯也比较信任他。英特尔公司的处理器速度全球最快，但是其芯片往往用在带外接电源的计算机中，从来不需考虑电池的续航时间。于是，托尼·法德尔极力主张采用基于ARM的架构，其芯片更为简单，耗电更少。苹果公司很早就开始同ARM合作，最早的iPhone产品就使用了该架构的芯片。法德尔获得了其他工程师的支持，相信有可能挑战乔布斯并且说服他。在一次会议上，当乔布斯坚持认为最好信任英特尔公司能做出优秀的移动设备芯片时，法德尔吼道：“错了，错了，错了！”当时，法德尔甚至把自己的名牌拍在会议桌上，威胁要辞职。
</p>
</div></div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Eventually Jobs  relented. “I hear you,” he said. “I’m not going to go against my best guys.” In  fact he went to the other extreme. Apple licensed the ARM architecture, but it  also bought a 150-person microprocessor design firm in Palo Alto, called P.A.  Semi, and had it create a custom system-on-a-chip, called the A4, which was  based on the ARM architecture and manufactured in South Korea by Samsung. As  Jobs recalled:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
最终，乔布斯松口了：“我听你的，我不会反对我最优秀的员工。”事实上，他走向了另一个极端。苹果公司在获得ARM构架授权的同时，收购了帕洛奥图一家150人的微处理器设计公司P.A.Semi,并让其设计一款定制的系统单芯片（System-on-a-Chip）；这款名为A4的芯片基于ARM架构，由三星公司在韩国制造。乔布斯回忆道：
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>At  the high-performance end, Intel is the best. They build the fastest chip, if  you don’t care about power and cost. But they build just the processor on one  chip, so it takes a lot of other parts. Our A4 has the processor and the  graphics, mobile operating system, and memory control all in the chip. We tried  to help Intel, but they don’t listen much. We’ve been telling them for years  that their graphics suck. Every quarter we schedule a meeting with me and our  top three guys and Paul Otellini. At the beginning, we were doing wonderful  things together. They wanted this big joint project to do chips for future  iPhones. There were two reasons we didn’t go with them. One was that they are  just really slow. They’re like a steamship, not very flexible. We’re used to going  pretty fast. Second is that we just didn’t want to teach them everything, which  they could go and sell to our competitors.</p>
  <p>According to Otellini,  it would have made sense for the iPad to use Intel chips. The problem, he said,  was that Apple and Intel couldn’t agree on price. Also, they disagreed on who  would control the design. It was another example of Jobs’s desire, indeed  compulsion, to control every aspect of a product, from the silicon to the  flesh.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>在高性能方面，英特尔公司最好。他们制造的芯片迷度最快，如果你不在乎功耗和成本的话。但是他们的芯片上只有处理器，因此需要许多其他部件。我们的A4芯片将处理器、显卡、移动操作系统和内存控制都集成于一个芯片之中。我们曾想要帮助英特尔公司，但是他们不怎么听我们的。多年来，我们都跟英特尔反映，他们的图形芯片很盖劲儿。每个季度，我和其他三名苹果公司高管都会跟保罗·欧德宁开会。开始的时候，我们一起做出了很棒的东西。他们希望这个联合項目可以为今后的iPhone制作芯片。我们没有继续合作的原因有二。一是他们真的很慢，就像蒸汽轮船一样，不是很炅活，而我们习惯快速前进。二是我们不想把什么都教给他们，因为他们可能会把我们的东西卖给竞争对手。</p>

<p>据欧德宁说，iPad本可以采用英特尔芯片。问题在于苹果公司和英特尔公司无法谈拢价格，“没有合作主要是因为经济原因。”他说道。而这也是乔布斯控制欲——确切地说是强迫症——的一个表现，他想要控制产品的每一个环节，从芯片到材料。</p>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><h3><a name="s2" id="s2"></a>The Launch, January 2010</h3>
<p>The usual excitement  that Jobs was able to gin up for a product launch paled in comparison to the frenzy  that built for the iPad unveiling on January 27, 2010, in San Francisco. The <em>Economist</em> put him on its cover robed, haloed, and holding what was dubbed “the Jesus  Tablet.” The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> struck a similarly exalted note: “The  last time there was this much excitement about a tablet, it had some  commandments written on it.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<h3>2010年1月发布会</h3>
<p>2010年1月27日，iPad在旧金山亮相激起的狂热，令乔布斯通常在产品发布会上所能激起的热情黯然失色。《经济学人》杂志的封面上，乔布斯穿着长袍，头顶光环，手持被称为“耶稣平板电脑”的iPad。《华尔街日报》也发表了类似的赞美报道：“人类上一次对一个平板如此兴奋是因为上面写有十诫。”</p>

　　

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>As if to underscore  the historic nature of the launch, Jobs invited back many of the old-timers  from his early Apple days. More poignantly, James Eason, who had performed his  liver transplant the year before, and Jeffrey Norton, who had operated on his  pancreas in 2004, were in the audience, sitting with his wife, his son, and  Mona Simpson.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
似乎是为了强调这一产品的历史意义，乔布斯邀请了苹果公司当年的许多参与者。更意味深长的是，他还请来了詹姆斯·伊森和杰弗里·诺顿。伊森一年前刚刚为他做了肝脏移植手术；诺顿则是2004年为他做了胰腺手术，iPad发布当天，他携妻带子，与乔布斯的妹妹莫娜·辛普森一起坐在观众席中。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs did his usual  masterly job of putting a new device into context, as he had done for the  iPhone three years earlier. This time he put up a screen that showed an iPhone  and a laptop with a question mark in between. “The question is, is there room  for something in the middle?” he asked. That “something” would have to be good  at web browsing, email, photos, video, music, games, and ebooks. He drove a  stake through the heart of the netbook concept. “Netbooks aren’t better at  anything!” he said. The invited guests and employees cheered. “But we have  something that is. We call it the iPad.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
乔布斯以一贯的大师风格为新产品的登场铺陈渲染，就像三年前发布iPhone时一样。这一次，屏幕上显示出一台iPhone和一台笔记本电脑，中间标着一个问号。“问题是，两者之间还可能存在别的东西吗？”他问道。这个“东西”必须能用来很好地浏览网页、电子邮件、照片、视频、音乐、游戏和电子书。他给予了上网本概念致命的一击，说道：“上网本无论从哪个角度来讲都乏善可陈！”来客和员工欢呼起来。“但是我们有这样一个‘东西’，它叫做iPad。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>To underscore the  casual nature of the iPad, Jobs ambled over to a comfortable leather chair and  side table (actually, given his taste, it was a Le Corbusier chair and an Eero  Saarinen table) and scooped one up. “It’s so much more intimate than a laptop,”  he enthused. He proceeded to surf to the <em>New York Times</em> website, send an  email to Scott Forstall and Phil Schiller (“Wow, we really are announcing the  iPad”), flip through a photo album, use a calendar, zoom in on the Eiffel Tower  on Google Maps, watch some video clips (<em>Star Trek</em> and Pixar’s <em>Up</em>),  show off the iBook shelf, and play a song (Bob Dylan’s “Like a Rolling Stone,”  which he had played at the iPhone launch). “Isn’t that awesome?” he asked.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
为了强调iPad的亲和性，乔布斯从容地走到一把舒适的皮革椅子和一张边桌前，拿起了一台iPad,实际上，出于他的品位，椅子是勒·柯布西耶（LeCorbusier）设计的，边桌则是埃罗·沙里宁（EeroSaarinen）的作品。他热情地说：“它比笔记本电脑亲和得多。”接着，乔布斯开始浏览《纽约时报》的网页，给斯科特·福斯托和菲尔·席勒发送电子邮件，题目是，哇，我们真的在发布iPad。”然后他翻阅相册，使用日历，在Google地图上放大埃菲尔铁塔的图片，观看了《星际迷航》和皮克斯《飞屋环游记》的一些视频片段，展示iBook书架，并播放了鲍勃·迪伦的《像一块滚石》（LikeaRollingStone），这首歌他曾在iPhone发布时播放过。“这难道还不够牛吗？”他问道。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>With his final slide,  Jobs emphasized one of the themes of his life, which was embodied by the iPad:  a sign showing the corner of Technology Street and Liberal Arts Street. “The  reason Apple can create products like the iPad is that we’ve always tried to be  at the intersection of technology and liberal arts,” he concluded. The iPad was  the digital reincarnation of the <em>Whole Earth Catalog</em>, the place where  creativity met tools for living.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
在最后一张幻灯片中，一个路牌上标识着“科技”与“人文”两条街的交汇口。乔布斯着重阐述丁其人生的一个理念，这一理念也在iPad身上得到了体现。“苹果之所以能够创造出iPad这样的产品，是因为我们一直努力融合科技和人文艺术。”他总结道。iPad是《全球概览》的电子化身，在这里，创意与实用工具相遇。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>For once, the initial  reaction was not a Hallelujah Chorus. The iPad was not yet available (it would  go on sale in April), and some who watched Jobs’s demo were not quite sure what  it was. An iPhone on steroids? “I haven’t been this let down since Snooki  hooked up with The Situation,” wrote <em>Newsweek</em>’s Daniel Lyons (who  moonlighted as “The Fake Steve Jobs” in an online parody). Gizmodo ran a  contributor’s piece headlined “Eight Things That Suck about the iPad” (no  multitasking, no cameras, no Flash . . . ). Even the name came in for ridicule  in the blogosphere, with snarky comments about feminine hygiene products and  maxi pads. The hashtag “#iTampon” was the number-three trending topic on  Twitter that day.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
但iPad最初收到的反应并非颂歌。由于产品同年4月才上市，观看过乔布斯演示的一些人不太清楚这到底是什么东西。一个增强型iPhone?《新闻周刊》的丹尼尔·莱昂斯（DanielLyons）写道：“自从Snooki和TheSituation①好上之后，我还没有如此失望过。”莱昂斯曾在一个网络模仿秀中扮演“假史蒂夫·乔布斯”。Gizmodo网站发表了一篇撰稿人文章，题为“iPad的八大逊处”（EightThingsThatSuckabouttheiPad）,列举出iPad的种种缺点：没有多任务，没有摄像头，不支持Flash，等等。甚至就连iPad的名字也遭到博客圈的调侃，被恶搞成女性卫生用品。当天，“#iTampon”②这个标签在Twitter话题榜上排名第三。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>There was also the  requisite dismissal from Bill Gates. “I still think that some mixture of voice,  the pen and a real keyboard—in other words a netbook—will be the mainstream,”  he told Brent Schlender. “So, it’s not like I sit there and feel the same way I  did with the iPhone where I say, ‘Oh my God, Microsoft didn’t aim high enough.’  It’s a nice reader, but there’s nothing on the iPad I look at and say, ‘Oh, I  wish Microsoft had done it.’” He continued to insist that the Microsoft  approach of using a stylus for input would prevail. “I’ve been predicting a  tablet with a stylus for many years,” he told me. “I will eventually turn out  to be right or be dead.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
比尔·盖茨也少不了冷嘲热讽一番。“我仍然认为，手写笔和真正的键盘，也就是上网本，会是主流，”他对布伦特·施伦德说，“我没有当初iPhone发布时的那种感觉。iPhone发布的时候，我心里想：‘哦天哪，微软的目标不够高。’iPad是个不错的阅读器，但是它没有任何地方会让我觉得，‘噢，我多希望这是微软做出来的。’”他坚持认为，微软的手写笔输入方案会成为行业标准。盖茨对我说：“多年来，我都一直预言今后会出现配备手写笔的平板电脑。要么我是对的，要么我就死定了。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The night after his  announcement, Jobs was annoyed and depressed. As we gathered in his kitchen for  dinner, he paced around the table calling up emails and web pages on his  iPhone.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
在发布会第二晚，乔布斯非常恼火和沮丧，我们聚集在他家厨房吃晚饭，他在餐桌旁来回踱步，用自己的iPhone收发电子邮件，浏览网页。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>I  got about eight hundred email messages in the last twenty-four hours. Most of  them are complaining. There’s no USB cord! There’s no this, no that. Some of  them are like, “Fuck you, how can you do that?” I don’t usually write people  back, but I replied, “Your parents would be so proud of how you turned out.”  And some don’t like the iPad name, and on and on. I kind of got depressed  today. It knocks you back a bit.</p>
  <p>He did get one  congratulatory call that day that he appreciated, from President Obama’s chief  of staff, Rahm Emanuel. But he noted at dinner that the president had not  called him since taking office.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>在过去24小时内，我收到了约800封电子邮件。大多数都是在抱怨。没有USB线！没有这个，没有那个。有些人会说，“靠，你怎么能这样做呢？”我一般不回复别人的邮件，但是这封我回了，“你父母会为你这么有出息而感到骄傲的。”有些人不喜欢iPad这个名字，等等等等。我今天有些郁闷，有点受到打击了。</p>

<p>不过他那天也收到了一封值得髙兴的贺电，来自奥巴马总统的办公厅主任拉姆·伊曼纽尔（RahmEmamjel）。但他在晚餐时指出，奥巴马总统上任以来还没跟他通过电话。</p>

　　


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The public carping  subsided when the iPad went on sale in April and people got their hands on it.  Both <em>Time</em> and <em>Newsweek</em> put it on the cover. “The tough thing  about writing about Apple products is that they come with a lot of hype wrapped  around them,” Lev Grossman wrote in <em>Time.</em> “The other tough thing about  writing about Apple products is that sometimes the hype is true.” His main  reservation, a substantive one, was “that while it’s a lovely device for  consuming content, it doesn’t do much to facilitate its creation.” Computers,  especially the Macintosh, had become tools that allowed people to make music,  videos, websites, and blogs, which could be posted for the world to see. “The  iPad shifts the emphasis from creating content to merely absorbing and manipulating  it. It mutes you, turns you back into a passive consumer of other people’s  masterpieces.” It was a criticism Jobs took to heart. He set about making sure  that the next version of the iPad would emphasize ways to facilitate artistic  creation by the user.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
4月，当iPad开始销售、人们亲手拿到它之后，公众的挑剔情绪开始消退。《时代》杂志和《新闻周刊》都将其做了封面报道。列夫·格罗斯曼在《时代》杂志撰文写道：“撰写苹果公司产品文章的难题之一在于，它们常常伴随着天花乱坠的宣传。另一个难处则是，有时候炒作都是真的。”他对iPad的唯一保留意见就是，“虽然它是进行内容消费的好设备，但是对于内容创造并无多大助益。”事实确实如此。电脑，尤其是麦金塔，巳成为人们制作音乐、视频、网站和博客的工具。“iPad将重点从内容创造转移至仅仅是吸收和使用内容。它让你成为观者，把你变成被动消费者，消费其他人的杰作。”乔布斯将这一批评放在心上，并着手改进，确保下一代iPad能够加强方便用户进行艺术创作的功能。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p><em>Newsweek</em>’s cover line was  “What’s So Great about the iPad? Everything.” Daniel Lyons, who had zapped it  with his “Snooki” comment at the launch, revised his opinion. “My first  thought, as I watched Jobs run through his demo, was that it seemed like no big  deal,” he wrote. “It’s a bigger version of the iPod Touch, right? Then I got a  chance to use an iPad, and it hit me: I want one.” Lyons, like others, realized  that this was Jobs’s pet project, and it embodied all that he stood for. “He  has an uncanny ability to cook up gadgets that we didn’t know we needed, but  then suddenly can’t live without,” he wrote. “A closed system may be the only  way to deliver the kind of techno-Zen experience that Apple has become known  for.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
《新闻周刊》的封面标题是“iPad好在哪儿？哪儿都好”。之前用Snooki刻薄评论iPad的丹尼尔·莱昂斯修正了自己的观点。“在观看乔布斯演示的时候，我第一感觉就是，这好像没什么大不了的，”他写道，“就是个大点儿的iPodTouch，不是吗？后来，我有机会用了一下iPad，一下就爱上了它：我也想要一个。”莱昂斯和其他人一样，意识到这是乔布斯的得意之作，体现了他的所有理念。“他有种不可思议的能力，能够创造出一些小工具，我们原先不知道自己需要它们，等推出以后我们却发现自己离不开它们，”莱昂斯写道，“封闭的系统可能是传达苹果的技术禅理的唯一途径。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Most of the debate  over the iPad centered on the issue of whether its closed end-to-end  integration was brilliant or doomed. Google was starting to play a role similar  to the one Microsoft had played in the 1980s, offering a mobile platform,  Android, that was open and could be used by all hardware makers. <em>Fortune</em> staged a debate on this issue in its pages. “There’s no excuse to be closed,”  wrote Michael Copeland. But his colleague Jon Fortt rebutted, “Closed systems  get a bad rap, but they work beautifully and users benefit. Probably no one in  tech has proved this more convincingly than Steve Jobs. By bundling hardware,  software, and services, and controlling them tightly, Apple is consistently  able to get the jump on its rivals and roll out polished products.” They agreed  that the iPad would be the clearest test of this question since the original  Macintosh. “Apple has taken its control-freak rep to a whole new level with the  A4 chip that powers the thing,” wrote Fortt. “Cupertino now has absolute say  over the silicon, device, operating system, App Store, and payment system.”</p>

关于iPad的大部分争论都着眼于其封闭的端到端一体化系统是卓越的还是注定失败的。Google这时开始扮演20世纪80年代微软的角色，该公司推出了移动系统安卓。这是一个开放平台，所有硬件制造商均可使用。《财富》杂志就这一话题进行了讨论。迈克尔·科普兰（MichaelCopeland）写道：“没理由封闭。”但是他的同事乔恩·佛特（JonFortt）反驳道：“封闭系统的名声虽差，但是它们很好用，对用户有好处。在技术领域中，恐怕没人能比史蒂夫·乔布斯更能证明这一点。苹果公司能够通过捆绑硬件、软件和服务，并进行紧密控制，成功超越竞争对手，推出优美的产品。”二人一致认为，在麦金塔之后，iPad将是开放还是封闭这一问题最清楚的测试。“A4芯片把所有功能都集成于一张芯片上，这表明苹果的控制癖已经到了一个新的高度。”佛特写道，“现在，对整个眭谷、设备、操作系统、应用程序商店和支付系统，苹果公司都具有绝对发言杈。”

<p>Jobs went to the Apple  store in Palo Alto shortly before noon on April 5, the day the iPad went on  sale. Daniel Kottke—his acid-dropping soul mate from Reed and the early days at  Apple, who no longer harbored a grudge for not getting founders’ stock  options—made a point of being there. “It had been fifteen years, and I wanted  to see him again,” Kottke recounted. “I grabbed him and told him I was going to  use the iPad for my song lyrics. He was in a great mood and we had a nice chat  after all these years.” Powell and their youngest child, Eve, watched from a  corner of the store.</p>

4月5日中午之前，乔布斯来到帕洛奥图的苹果专卖店，这是iPad开始销售的日子。丹尼尔·科特基也来了；他是乔布斯在里德学院和苹果公司早期的亲密伙伴，两人曾一起服用迷幻剂。科特基对当初没有得到发起人期权的事情早已释怀。“已经15年了，我想再见见他，”科特基回忆道，“我拉住他，说自己准备用iPad来写歌词。他当时心情很好，这么多年来，我们总算有了一次倫快的聊天。”乔布斯的妻子鲍威尔及他们最小的孩子伊芙在商店的角落里看着他们聊天。

<p>Wozniak, who had once  been a proponent of making hardware and software as open as possible, continued  to revise that opinion. As he often did, he stayed up all night with the  enthusiasts waiting in line for the store to open. This time he was at San  Jose’s Valley Fair Mall, riding a Segway. A reporter asked him about the closed  nature of Apple’s ecosystem. “Apple gets you into their playpen and keeps you  there, but there are some advantages to that,” he replied. “I like open  systems, but I’m a hacker. But most people want things that are easy to use.  Steve’s genius is that he knows how to make things simple, and that sometimes  requires controlling everything.”</p>

沃兹尼亚克曾主张尽可能开放硬件和软件，他也在不断修正自己的意见。如以往一样，iPad上市当天，他和果粉们彻夜排队等待苹果专卖店开门。这一天，他骑着一辆赛格威两轮自平衡电动车，来到圣何塞的维利菲尔购物中心（ValleyFairMall）等待。一位记者向他询问苹果生态系统的封闭性。他回答说苹果把用户引进围栏并让他们留在里面，但是这也有一些优势。我喜爱开放式系统，但我是个黑客。而大多数人只想要简单方便易用的东西。史蒂夫的天才之处就在于，他知道如何把东西变得简单，而要做到这一点有时就需要控制一切。

<p>The question “What’s  on your iPad?” replaced “What’s on your iPod?” Even President Obama’s staffers,  who embraced the iPad as a mark of their tech hipness, played the game.  Economic Advisor Larry Summers had the Bloomberg financial information app,  Scrabble, and <em>The Federalist Papers.</em> Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel had a  slew of newspapers, Communications Advisor Bill Burton had <em>Vanity Fair</em> and one entire season of the television series <em>Lost,</em> and Political  Director David Axelrod had Major League Baseball and NPR.</p>

<p>Jobs was stirred by a  story, which he forwarded to me, by Michael Noer on <em>Forbes.com.</em> Noer was  reading a science fiction novel on his iPad while staying at a dairy farm in a  rural area north of Bogotá, Colombia, when a poor six-year-old boy who cleaned  the stables came up to him. Curious, Noer handed him the device. With no  instruction, and never having seen a computer before, the boy started using it  intuitively. He began swiping the screen, launching apps, playing a pinball  game. “Steve Jobs has designed a powerful computer that an illiterate  six-year-old can use without instruction,” Noer wrote. “If that isn’t magical,  I don’t know what is.”</p>

有一个故事打动了乔布斯，他转发了给我。迈克尔·内尔（MichaelNoer）在福布斯网站上发表了一篇文章：他在哥伦比亚首都波哥大北部农村的一个奶牛场，正在自己的iPad上读一部科幻小说，一个打扫马厩的6岁小男孩走了过来。小男孩很好奇，内尔于是把iPad递给了他。在没人指导也从未见过电脑的情况下，这个小男孩开始凭自己的直觉使用iPad。他开始用手指在屏幕上滑动，启动应用程序，玩弹球游戏。“史蒂夫·乔布斯设计出了一个强大的电脑，连目不识丁的6岁孩子都能在没有指导的情况下使用。”内尔写道，“如果这还不算神奇，那我真不知道有什么东西称得上神奇了。”

<div class="left"><h3><a name="s3" id="s3"></a>Advertising</h3>
<p>Jobs was not happy  with the original ads for the iPad. As usual, he threw himself into the  marketing, working with James Vincent and Duncan Milner at the ad agency (now  called TBWA/Media Arts Lab), with Lee Clow advising from a semiretired perch.  The commercial they first produced was a gentle scene of a guy in faded jeans  and sweatshirt reclining in a chair, looking at email, a photo album, the <em>New  York Times</em>, books, and video on an iPad propped on his lap. There were no  words, just the background beat of “There Goes My Love” by the Blue Van. “After  he approved it, Steve decided he hated it,” Vincent recalled. “He thought it  looked like a Pottery Barn commercial.” Jobs later told me:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<h3>广告</h3>
<p>乔布斯对于iPad原来的广告并不满意。像往常一样，他全身心投入营销工作之中。乔布斯同詹姆斯·文森特和邓肯·米尔纳一起合作，他们的广告公司现在改名为TBWA/MediaArtsLab，处于半退休状态的李·克劳也会给出一些建议。他们做出的第一个广告场景很温馨，一名男子穿着褪色的牛仔裤和运动衫，斜靠在椅子上，膝盖上放着iPad；他在上面查看邮件，浏览相册，阅读《纽约时报》，看电子书和视频。没有文字，只有蓝色面包车乐队（BlueVan）的《来吧我的爱》（ThereGoesMyLove）作为背景音乐。“史蒂夫批准了这个广告方案后，又发现自己很讨厌它，”文森特回忆道，“他觉得这片子看起来就像陶瓷谷仓（PotteryBam）家居店的广告一样。”乔布斯后来告诉我：

　　</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>It  had been easy to explain what the iPod was—a thousand songs in your  pocket—which allowed us to move quickly to the iconic silhouette ads. But it  was hard to explain what an iPad was. We didn’t want to show it as a computer,  and yet we didn’t want to make it so soft that it looked like a cute TV. The  first set of ads showed we didn’t know what we were doing. They had a cashmere  and Hush Puppies feel to them.</p>
  <p>James Vincent had not  taken a break in months. So when the iPad finally went on sale and the ads  started airing, he drove with his family to the Coachella Music Festival in  Palm Springs, which featured some of his favorite bands, including Muse, Faith  No More, and Devo. Soon after he arrived, Jobs called. “Your commercials suck,”  he said. “The iPad is revolutionizing the world, and we need something big.  You’ve given me small shit.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>解释iPod是什么很容易——把1000首歌装进你口袋——我们很快就做出了标志性的剪影广告。但是，很难说清楚iPad是什么。我们不希望把它展示成一台电脑，也不想把它弱化成一台可爱的电视机。第一组广告表明我们不知道自己在做什么。它们太休闲，太惬意了。</p>

　　
<p>为了做iPad的广告，詹姆斯·文森特几个月都没有休息。终于，iPad开始销售，广告也同步播出了，他开车带着家人前往棕榈泉观看柯契拉音乐节（CoachellaMusicFestival）,参加演出的有他最喜欢的乐队，包括缪斯乐队、信仰破灭乐队（FaithNoMore）和退化乐队（Devo）。他刚到那儿没一会儿，乔布斯的电话就来了。“你的广告烂透了，”他说，“iPad正彻底改变世界，我们需要有冲击力的东西。你这都是小屁玩意儿。”</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>“Well, what do you  want?” Vincent shot back. “You’ve not been able to tell me what you want.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Jobs  said. “You have to bring me something new. Nothing you’ve shown me is even  close.”</p>

<p>Vincent argued back  and suddenly Jobs went ballistic. “He just started screaming at me,” Vincent  recalled. Vincent could be volatile himself, and the volleys escalated.</p>

<p>When Vincent shouted,  “You’ve got to tell me what you want,” Jobs shot back, “You’ve got to show me  some stuff, and I’ll know it when I see it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, great, let me  write that on my brief for my creative people: I’ll know it when I see it.”</p>

<p>Vincent got so  frustrated that he slammed his fist into the wall of the house he was renting  and put a large dent in it. When he finally went outside to his family, sitting  by the pool, they looked at him nervously. “Are you okay?” his wife finally  asked.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>“好吧，那你想要什么？”文森特回敬道，“你一直都没能告诉我你想要什么。”</p>
<p>“我不知道，”乔布斯说，“你得给我点新东西。你给我看过的东西都差得远了。”</p>
<p>文森特开始争辩起来，乔布斯突然暴怒。文森特回忆说，“他开始冲我吼叫。”文森特也被激怒了，于是两人的争吵开始升级。</p>
<p>文森特喊道：“你得告诉我你要什么。”乔布斯回道：“你得给我展示一些东西，等我看到我想要的东西就知道是什么了。”</p>
<p>“噢，太棒了，让我把这记下来，发给我的创意人员：我看到我想要的东西就知道是什么了。”</p>
<p>为此，文森特非常沮丧，一拳打在了旅馆房间的墙壁上，在上面留下了一个大回痕。当他终于走出屋外与家人坐在水池边时，他们都很紧张地看着他。他妻子最后开口问道：“你还好吧？”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>It took Vincent and  his team two weeks to come up with an array of new options, and he asked to  present them at Jobs’s house rather than the office, hoping that it would be a  more relaxed environment. Laying storyboards on the coffee table, he and Milner  offered twelve approaches. One was inspirational and stirring. Another tried  humor, with Michael Cera, the comic actor, wandering through a fake house  making funny comments about the way people could use iPads. Others featured the  iPad with celebrities, or set starkly on a white background, or starring in a  little sitcom, or in a straightforward product demonstration.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
文森特及其团队花了两周时间拿出了一系列新的备选方案，他要求在乔布斯家里而不是办公室中展示，希望这样的环境更宽松。故事板架在茶几上，文森特和米尔纳共展出了12种方案。A方案鼓舞人心，令人激动。B方案采用幽默手法，让喜剧演员迈克尔·塞拉（MichaelCem）在一个假房子里针对人们使用iPad的方式发表有趣的评论。C方案用名人，D方案完全采用白色背景，E方案演绎一个小情景喜剧，F方案直截了当地进行产品演示，等等等等。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>After mulling over the  options, Jobs realized what he wanted. Not humor, nor a celebrity, nor a demo.  “It’s got to make a statement,” he said. “It needs to be a manifesto. This is  big.” He had announced that the iPad would change the world, and he wanted a  campaign that reinforced that declaration. Other companies would come out with  copycat tablets in a year or so, he said, and he wanted people to remember that  the iPad was the real thing. “We need ads that stand up and declare what we  have done.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
在仔细考虑了这些方案后，乔布斯明白了自己想要什么。不要幽默，不要名人，也不要产品演示。“广告要发出一份声明，”乔布斯说，“它应该是一个宣言，告诉人们iPad很了不起。”他曾宣布iPad会改变世界，他希望广告能够强化自己的宣言。乔布斯认为，在未来一年左右的时间里，其他公司会跟风推出平板电脑，而他希望人们记住，iPad才是真正的平板电脑。“我们需要这个广告能够站起来，向人们宣告我们的成就。”
</p>

<p>He abruptly got out of  his chair, looking a bit weak but smiling. “I’ve got to go have a massage now,”  he said. “Get to work.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
他突然离开了自己的椅子，有些虚弱，但笑着说：“我要去做按摩了，开始干活儿吧。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>So Vincent and Milner,  along with the copywriter Eric Grunbaum, began crafting what they dubbed “The  Manifesto.” It would be fast-paced, with vibrant pictures and a thumping beat,  and it would proclaim that the iPad was revolutionary. The music they chose was  Karen O’s pounding refrain from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs’” Gold Lion.” As the iPad  was shown doing magical things, a strong voice declared, “iPad is thin. iPad is  beautiful. . . . It’s crazy powerful. It’s magical. . . . It’s video, photos.  More books than you could read in a lifetime. It’s already a revolution, and  it’s only just begun.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
于是，文森特、米尔纳以及文案埃里克·格伦鲍姆（EricGranbaum）开始制作乔布斯想要的广告片，他们称之为“宣言”（TheManifesto）。这部广告片的节奏很快，激昂的节拍，生动的画面，它宣告iPad是革命性的产品。他们选择的音乐是耶耶耶合唱团（YeahYeahYeahs’）女主唱凯伦·欧（KarenO）的一首名为《金狮》（GoldLion）的副歌部分，颇具冲击力。画面展示出iPad神奇的功能，一个强有力的旁白宣告道：“iPad很薄，iPad很美……它非常强大，它不可思议……它是视频，是照片。能装下你一辈子都读不完的书。它已经是一场革命，而一切才刚刚开始。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Once the Manifesto ads  had run their course, the team again tried something softer, shot as  day-in-the-life documentaries by the young filmmaker Jessica Sanders. Jobs  liked them—for a little while. Then he turned against them for the same reason  he had reacted against the original Pottery Barn–style ads. “Dammit,” he  shouted, “they look like a Visa commercial, typical ad agency stuff.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
“宣言”广告片完成后，广告团队又尝试了更为柔和的手法，由年轻导演杰西卡·桑德斯（JessicaSanders）拍摄了一段生活纪录片。最初，乔布斯挺喜欢这两个新广告。伹没一会儿，他就开始反对，和他讨庆之前陶瓷谷仓式广告的理由如出一辙。“该死，”他大喊道，“这些就跟维萨卡的广告一样，典型的广告公司产品。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>He had been asking for  ads that were different and new, but eventually he realized he did not want to  stray from what he considered the Apple voice. For him, that voice had a  distinctive set of qualities: simple, declarative, clean. “We went down that  lifestyle path, and it seemed to be growing on Steve, and suddenly he said, ‘I  hate that stuff, it’s not Apple,’” recalled Lee Clow. “He told us to get back  to the Apple voice. It’s a very simple, honest voice.” And so they went back to  a clean white background, with just a close-up showing off all the things that  “iPad is...” and could do.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
他曾要他们做出新颖的广告，要与众不同；但最终，他意识到自己不想偏离自己所谓的苹果的声音。对乔布斯来说，苹果的声音有一系列特质：简单，千净，宣告式。“我們一直在探讨更生活化的广告方案，而史蒂夫似乎也慢慢产生了兴趣；结果突然他又说自己讨厌这个东西，它没有苹果的感觉。”李·克劳回忆道，“他叫我们找回苹果的声音，一种非常筒单诚实的声音。”于是，他们又重新采用千净的白色背景，用一系列特写镜头以及“iPad是……”的短语来展示它的所有属性和功能。
</p>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><h3><a name="s4" id="s4"></a>Apps</h3> </p>
<p>The iPad commercials  were not about the device, but about what you could do with it. Indeed its  success came not just from the beauty of the hardware but from the  applications, known as apps, that allowed you to indulge in all sorts of  delightful activities. There were thousands—and soon hundreds of thousands—of  apps that you could download for free or for a few dollars. You could sling  angry birds with the swipe of your finger, track your stocks, watch movies,  read books and magazines, catch up on the news, play games, and waste glorious  amounts of time. Once again the integration of the hardware, software, and  store made it easy. But the apps also allowed the platform to be sort of open,  in a very controlled way, to outside developers who wanted to create software  and content for it—open, that is, like a carefully curated and gated community  garden.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<h3>应用程序</h3>
<p>iPad广告没有介绍设备本身，而是讲述你可以用它做什么。事实上，iPad的成功不仅来自其漂亮的硬件，也来自其应用程序，用户可以借此进行各种有趣的活动。最幵始只有数百种应用程序可供免费或低价下载，但很快，应用程序的数量就已成千上万。你可以玩“愤怒的小鸟”，也可以追踪股票信息、看电影、阅读电子书和杂志、获知新闻、玩游戏，消磨大把时光。硬件、软件和应用程序商店的整合让一切都变得很简单。但是，苹果公司也在对那些想要为iPad开发软件和内容的外部开发者有控制地开放应用程序商店；这个平台就像一个精心管理和控制的社区花园。

　　</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The apps phenomenon  began with the iPhone. When it first came out in early 2007, there were no apps  you could buy from outside developers, and Jobs initially resisted allowing  them. He didn’t want outsiders to create applications for the iPhone that could  mess it up, infect it with viruses, or pollute its integrity.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
应用程序热潮始于iPhone。2007年初，iPhone刚刚推出时，没有外部开发人员开发的应用程序，乔布斯最初也拒绝向外部开发人员开放。他不想让外人为iPhone创建应用程序，因为这样可能会把iPhone搞得乱七八糟，让iPhone感染病毒，或者破坏其完整性。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Board member Art  Levinson was among those pushing to allow iPhone apps. “I called him a half  dozen times to lobby for the potential of the apps,” he recalled. If Apple  didn’t allow them, indeed encourage them, another smartphone maker would,  giving itself a competitive advantage. Apple’s marketing chief Phil Schiller  agreed. “I couldn’t imagine that we would create something as powerful as the  iPhone and not empower developers to make lots of apps,” he recalled. “I knew  customers would love them.” From the outside, the venture capitalist John Doerr  argued that permitting apps would spawn a profusion of new entrepreneurs who  would create new services.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
董事会成员亚瑟·莱文森和一些人主张开放iPhone应用程序。“我给他打了很多电话，游说他开放应用程序。”莱文森回忆说。如果苹果不允许开发者制作应用程序，而其他智能手机制造商允许，那么这实际上就将竞争优势拱手相让。苹果公司营销总监菲尔·席勒赞同莱文森的说法。“我无法想象，我们能创造出iPhone这样强大的产品，却不愿意授杈开发者制作应用程序，”席勒回忆道，“我知道消费者会喜欢。”在苹果公司外部，风险投资家约翰·多尔认为，开放应用程序平台能够催生出新型创业者，他们会创造出新的服务。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs at first quashed  the discussion, partly because he felt his team did not have the bandwidth to  figure out all of the complexities that would be involved in policing  third-party app developers. He wanted focus. “So he didn’t want to talk about  it,” said Schiller. But as soon as the iPhone was launched, he was willing to  hear the debate. “Every time the conversation happened, Steve seemed a little  more open,” said Levinson. There were freewheeling discussions at four board  meetings.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
乔布斯一开始拒绝就此进行讨论，部分原因是，他认为其团队没有精力解决授杈第三方应用程序开发者所涉及的复杂问题。他希望团队能专注。“于是他根本不愿意谈论这个问题。”席勒说。但是iPhone推出后不久，他又愿意听取大家就这个问题的争论。“每谈论一次这个话题，史蒂夫就好像更开放了一些。”莱文森表示。在四次董事会会议上，他们都就此问题进行了自由讨论。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs soon figured out  that there was a way to have the best of both worlds. He would permit outsiders  to write apps, but they would have to meet strict standards, be tested and  approved by Apple, and be sold only through the iTunes Store. It was a way to  reap the advantage of empowering thousands of software developers while  retaining enough control to protect the integrity of the iPhone and the  simplicity of the customer experience. “It was an absolutely magical solution  that hit the sweet spot,” said Levinson. “It gave us the benefits of openness  while retaining end-to-end control.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
乔布斯很快就想到了一个两全其美的好办法。他将允许外部开发人员编写应用程序，但是他们必须遵循严格的标准，接受苹果公司的测试和批准，并且只能通过iTunes商店出售自己的应用。这种方法既能获得授权众多软件开发者所带来的优势，又能保持足够的控制，以保护iPhone的完整性和用户体验的简单性。“这找到了一个好的平衡点，绝对是一个最佳解决方案，”莱文森说道，“能带给我们开放的好处，但同时又保留了端到端的控制。”

<p>The App Store for the  iPhone opened on iTunes in July 2008; the billionth download came nine months  later. By the time the iPad went on sale in April 2010, there were 185,000  available iPhone apps. Most could also be used on the iPad, although they  didn’t take advantage of the bigger screen size. But in less than five months,  developers had written twenty-five thousand new apps that were specifically  configured for the iPad. By July 2011 there were 500,000 apps for both devices,  and there had been more than fifteen billion downloads of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
2008年7月，iPhone应用程序商店开放；9个月后，下载量就达10亿次。2010年4月iPad开始销售时，应用程序商店已经拥有18.5万个iPhone应用程序。大多数应用程序也能在iPad上使用，虽然它们并未利用更大的屏幕。但是，不到5个月的时间，就已经出现了2.5万个专门为iPad编写的新应用程序。至2011年6月，苹果应用程序商店中的iPhone和iPad应用程序已达42.5万个，并且下载量超过140亿次。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">

<p>The App Store created  a new industry overnight. In dorm rooms and garages and at major media  companies, entrepreneurs invented new apps. John Doerr’s venture capital firm  created an iFund of $200 million to offer equity financing for the best ideas.  Magazines and newspapers that had been giving away their content for free saw  one last chance to put the genie of that dubious business model back into the  bottle. Innovative publishers created new magazines, books, and learning  materials just for the iPad. For example, the high-end publishing house  Callaway, which had produced books ranging from Madonna’s <em>Sex</em> to <em>Miss  Spider’s Tea Party</em>, decided to “burn the boats” and give up print  altogether to focus on publishing books as interactive apps. By June 2011 Apple  had paid out $2.5 billion to app developers.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
应用程序商店在一夜之间创造了一个新的产业。创业者们在宿舍、车库，以及主流媒体企业开发出了许多新的应用程序。约翰·多尔的风投公司成立了iFund基金，提供2亿美元为最好的创意进行股权融资。杂志和报纸看到了最后的希望，他们此前一直免费发布电子内容，也许能凭借应用程序对电子内容进行收费，就像将精灵收回了魔瓶一样。富于创新的出版商专门为iPad创造出新的杂志、书刊和学习材料。例如，曾出版过麦当娜的《性》以及《蜘蛛小姐的茶会》等作品的高端出版社卡拉威（Callaway）决定破釜沉舟，完全放弃印刷业，而专注于利用交互式应用程序进行书籍出版。截至2011年6月，苹果公司已向应用程序开发者支付了25亿美元。

<p>The iPad and other  app-based digital devices heralded a fundamental shift in the digital world.  Back in the 1980s, going online usually meant dialing into a service like AOL,  CompuServe, or Prodigy that charged fees for access to a carefully curated  walled garden filled with content plus some exit gates that allowed braver  users access to the Internet at large. The second phase, beginning in the early  1990s, was the advent of browsers that allowed everyone to freely surf the  Internet using the hypertext transfer protocols of the World Wide Web, which  linked billions of sites. Search engines arose so that people could easily find  the websites they wanted. The release of the iPad portended a new model. Apps  resembled the walled gardens of old. The creators could charge fees and offer  more functions to the users who downloaded them. But the rise of apps also  meant that the openness and linked nature of the web were sacrificed. Apps were  not as easily linked or searchable. Because the iPad allowed the use of both  apps and web browsing, it was not at war with the web model. But it did offer  an alternative, for both the consumers and the creators of content.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
iPad和其他基于应用程序的数码产品预示着数码世界的根本性转变。在网络发展的第一阶段，20世纪80年代，上网通常需要拨号进入一个服务商网络，如美国在线、CompuServe公司或Prodigy公司，这些服务商会提供一个围墙网络“花园”，里面都是服务商精心挑选组织的内容，同时这些“花园”会有一些出口，更为大胆的用户可以通过这些出口访问整个网络。第二阶段始于20世纪90年代初，浏览器开始兴起，所有人都能利用万维网超文本传输协议，通过浏览器浏览互联网上的数十亿个网站。雅虎和谷歌等捜索引擎的崛起，使用户可以轻易地找到自己想要的网站。而iPad的发布预示着一种新的模式。应用程序就像老式的围墙花园。创作者能够为下载它们的用户提供更多功能。但是应用程序的兴起也意味着牺牲网络的开放性和连接性。应用程序之间不易建立连接，也不易搜索。由于iPad可以同时使用应用程序和网络浏览，因此它同网络模式并无竞争。但是，它确实为内容创造者和消费者提供了一种替代方案。

<p>乔布斯用iPod改变了音乐产业。而iPad及其应用程序商店的出现，开始改变所有媒介，从出版到新闻，再到电视和电影。

<p>Books were an obvious  target, since Amazon’s Kindle had shown there was an appetite for electronic  books. So Apple created an iBooks Store, which sold electronic books the way  the iTunes Store sold songs. There was, however, a slight difference in the  business model. For the iTunes Store, Jobs had insisted that all songs be sold  at one inexpensive price, initially 99 cents. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos had tried to  take a similar approach with ebooks, insisting on selling them for at most  $9.99. Jobs came in and offered publishers what he had refused to offer record  companies: They could set any price they wanted for their wares in the iBooks Store,  and Apple would take 30%. Initially that meant prices were higher than on  Amazon. Why would people pay Apple more? “That won’t be the case,” Jobs  answered, when Walt Mossberg asked him that question at the iPad launch event.  “The price will be the same.” He was right.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
自从亚马逊的Kindle表明市场对于电子书有兴趣后，苹果公司也着手创建了iBook商店，出售电子书，就像iTunes商店出售音乐一样。不过，iBook商店的模式有一个细微不同。在iTunes商店，乔布斯坚持所有歌曲都必须以低廉的价格出售，最初是99美分。亚马逊的杰夫·贝佐斯（JeffBezos）也曾试图在电子书销售方面采取类似的模式，将图书最髙售价限定在9.99美元。乔布斯进入电子书领域，向出版商提出了唱片公司得不到的条件：他们可以在iBook商店中任意设置图书价格，苹果则从销售中提成30%。起初，这种方式表示iBook商店里的电子书会比亚马逊的贵。为什么人们要在苹果花更多钱来买书呢？沃尔特·莫斯伯格在iPad发布活动上向乔布斯发问，乔布斯回答道：“这不成问题，价格还是一样的。”他说得没错。

<p>The day after the iPad  launch, Jobs described to me his thinking on books:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
iPad发布第二天，乔布斯就向我讲述了自己对于图书的想法：
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Amazon  screwed it up. It paid the wholesale price for some books, but started selling  them below cost at $9.99. The publishers hated that—they thought it would trash  their ability to sell hardcover books at $28. So before Apple even got on the  scene, some booksellers were starting to withhold books from Amazon. So we told  the publishers, “We’ll go to the agency model, where you set the price, and we  get our 30%, and yes, the customer pays a little more, but that’s what you want  anyway.” But we also asked for a guarantee that if anybody else is selling the  books cheaper than we are, then we can sell them at the lower price too. So  they went to Amazon and said, “You’re going to sign an agency contract or we’re  not going to give you the books.”</p>
  <p>Jobs acknowledged that  he was trying to have it both ways when it came to music and books. He had  refused to offer the music companies the agency model and allow them to set  their own prices. Why? Because he didn’t have to. But with books he did. “We  were not the first people in the books business,” he said. “Given the situation  that existed, what was best for us was to do this akido move and end up with  the agency model. And we pulled it off.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>亚马逊搞砸了。它用批发价买了一些书，但用低于成本价的9.99美元进行销售。出版商对此深恶痛绝，这会影响他们以28美元的价格销售精装书的能力。因此，在苹果还未进入电子书领域之前，一些书商就已经停止向亚马逊供书。于是，我们跟出版商说，“我们采用代理模式，你们定价，我们抽成30%。确实，消费者会多出点儿钱，但是反正这就是你们想要的结果。”不过，我们也要求，如果有别的地方比我们卖得更便宜，那么我们也能以更低的价格进行销售。于是，他们找到亚马逊说，“你们得跟我们签订代理合同，否则我们就不会给你们书。”</p>

<p>乔布斯承认，在音乐和图书领域，他可以都实行两种模式。他拒绝与音乐公司建立代理模式及赋予他们自己定价的杈力。为什么？因为他不必如此。但是电子书就得这样。“我们不是最早进入面书业务的。”他说，“鉴于现有的情况，对我们最有利的策略就是借力使力，和出版商建立代理模式。我们成功了。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Right after the iPad  launch event, Jobs traveled to New York in February 2010 to meet with  executives in the journalism business. In two days he saw Rupert Murdoch, his  son James, and the management of their <em>Wall Street Journal</em>; Arthur Sulzberger  Jr. and the top executives at the <em>New York Times</em>; and executives at <em>Time,  Fortune</em>, and other Time Inc. magazines. “I would love to help quality  journalism,” he later said. “We can’t depend on bloggers for our news. We need  real reporting and editorial oversight more than ever. So I’d love to find a  way to help people create digital products where they actually can make money.”  Since he had gotten people to pay for music, he hoped he could do the same for  journalism.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
<p>2010年2月，iPad发布活动之后不久，乔布斯前往纽约同新闻界的髙管们会面。两天之内，他会见了鲁珀特·默多克（RupertMurdoch）、默多克的儿子詹姆斯，新闻集团旗下《华尔街日报》的髙管，《纽约时报》高管小亚瑟·苏兹贝格（ArthurSulzbergerJr.），以及《时代》杂志、《财富》杂志和其他时代集团旗下杂志的高管。“我想帮助有质量的新闻业，”他后来说道，“我们不能依赖于博客发布新闻。我们比以往都更需要真正的报道和编辑监督。因此，我想找到一种帮助人们创作数字产品的渠道，让他们能够真正赚到钱。”鉴于自己已经让人们购买数字音乐，他希望在新闻业也能收到同样的效果。</p>
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Publishers, however,  turned out to be leery of his lifeline. It meant that they would have to give  30% of their revenue to Apple, but that wasn’t the biggest problem. More  important, the publishers feared that, under his system, they would no longer  have a direct relationship with their subscribers; they wouldn’t have their  email address and credit card number so they could bill them, communicate with  them, and market new products to them. Instead Apple would own the customers,  bill them, and have their information in its own database. And because of its  privacy policy, Apple would not share this information unless a customer gave  explicit permission to do so.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
然而，出版商对于他送出的救命稻草持怀疑态度。同苹果合作意味着需要将自己30%的收人都给苹果公司，但是这并非最大的问题。更重要的是，出版商担心，在苹果的系统下，他们无法再与订阅用户建立直接联系，无法获取订阅用户的电子邮件地址和信用卡号，无法直接向用户收钱、沟通和营销新产品。相反，苹果将拥有这些消费者，向他们发送账单，将他们的信息存入自己的数据库。而且由于苹果公司的隐私政策，只有用户明确同意的情况下，苹果公司才能共享用户的信息。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs was particularly  interested in striking a deal with the <em>New York Times</em>, which he felt was  a great newspaper in danger of declining because it had not figured out how to  charge for digital content. “One of my personal projects this year, I’ve  decided, is to try to help—whether they want it or not—the <em>Times</em>,” he  told me early in 2010. “I think it’s important to the country for them to  figure it out.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
乔布斯尤其想要和《纽约时报》达成交易，他认为《纽约时报》是一份伟大的报纸，但由于不知道如何对数字内容进行收费而陷入衰退的危险之中。2010年初，他对我说：“我已经决定，今年的个人项目之一就是帮助《纽约时报》，不管他们愿不愿意。我认为，他们搞清楚如何对数字内容进行收费，这对整个美国都很重要。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>During his New York  trip, he went to dinner with fifty top <em>Times</em> executives in the cellar  private dining room at Pranna, an Asian restaurant. (He ordered a mango  smoothie and a plain vegan pasta, neither of which was on the menu.) There he  showed off the iPad and explained how important it was to find a modest price  point for digital content that consumers would accept. He drew a chart of  possible prices and volume. How many readers would they have if the <em>Times</em> were free? They already knew the answer to that extreme on the chart, because  they were giving it away for free on the web already and had about twenty  million regular visitors. And if they made it really expensive? They had data  on that too; they charged print subscribers more than $300 a year and had about a million of them.  “You should go after the midpoint, which is about ten million digital  subscribers,” he told them. “And that means your digital subs should be very  cheap and simple, one click and $5 a  month at most.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
纽约之行期间，他同50名时报集团高管在一家亚洲餐厅普拉娜（Pmma）的包房里共进晚餐。他点了一杯芒果奶昔和纯素意大利面，这两样在菜单上都没有。他在包房里展示了iPad，并解释为数码内容制定出消费者愿意接受的适中价格有多重要。他画了一个图表，列出可能的价格和相应的销售量。如果《纽约时报》免费，会有多少订阅量？图表上已经标明了这个极端数字，因为《纽约时报》已经通过网站免费提供电子版内容，并有约2000万定期访问者。如果他们定价非常高呢？这个数据也有；印刷版订阅者年费超过300美元，约有100万订阅者。“你们应该找到一个中间点，能达到1000万电子版订阅者，”乔布斯对他们说，“这意味着，你们的电子版应该非常便宜、订阅非常简单，每月最多5美元。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>When one of the <em>Times</em> circulation executives insisted that the paper needed the email and credit card  information for all of its subscribers, even if they subscribed through the App  Store, Jobs said that Apple would not give it out. That angered the executive.  It was unthinkable, he said, for the <em>Times</em> not to have that information.  “Well, you can ask them for it, but if they won’t voluntarily give it to you,  don’t blame me,” Jobs said. “If you don’t like it, don’t use us. I’m not the  one who got you in this jam. You’re the ones who’ve spent the past five years  giving away your paper online and not collecting anyone’s credit card  information.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
《纽约时报》的一位发行主管坚持，报纸需要所有订阅用户的电子邮件和信用卡信息，即使他们是通过苹果应用程序商店订阅的；乔布斯表示苹果公司不会公布这些信息。这激怒了那位髙管。他说道，细果《纽约时报》拿不到这些信息，那么想都不要想这件事情。乔布斯说：“好吧，你们可以找订阅用户要啊，但是如果他们不愿自动把这些信息给你们，那也别怪我。如果你们不喜欢这种模式，那就别用我们的平台。又不是我让你们陷入这种困境的。是你们自己过去5年都在免费发行电子版，却没有收集到任何用户的信用卡信息。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs also met  privately with Arthur Sulzberger Jr. “He’s a nice guy, and he’s really proud of  his new building, as he should be,” Jobs said later. “I talked to him about  what I thought he ought to do, but then nothing happened.” It took a year, but  in April 2011 the <em>Times</em> started charging for its digital edition and  selling some subscriptions through Apple, abiding by the policies that Jobs  established. It did, however, decide to charge approximately four times the $5  monthly charge that Jobs had suggested.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
乔布斯还私下会见了小亚瑟·苏兹贝格。乔布斯后来说：“他是个不错的人，对《纽约时报》的新大楼非常自豪，这也是应该的。我把我认为他们应该做的事都告诉了他，但是什么都没发生。”一年后，2011年4月，《纽约时报》才开始对电子版进行收费，并遵守乔布斯设立的政策，通过苹果应用商店销售部分订阅。乔布斯曾建议他们月收费定价5美元，然而《纽约时报》最终的定价接近其建议定价的4倍。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>At the Time-Life  Building, <em>Time</em>’s editor Rick Stengel played host. Jobs liked Stengel,  who had assigned a talented team led by Josh Quittner to make a robust iPad  version of the magazine each week. But he was upset to see Andy Serwer of <em>Fortune</em> there. Tearing up, he told Serwer how angry he still was about <em>Fortune</em>’s  story two years earlier revealing details of his health and the stock options  problems. “You kicked me when I was down,” he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
在时代-生活大厦，《时代》杂志的编辑里克·斯坦格尔（RickStengel）做东请来乔布斯。乔布斯喜欢斯坦格尔，因为他曾指派乔希·奎特纳（JoshQuittner）带领一个精英团队，每周为《时代》杂志编写iPad版本的应用程序。但是这次，斯坦格尔还邀请了《财富》杂志的安迪·瑟沃，乔布斯看到他不太高兴。他不留情面地告诉瑟沃，自己仍为两年前《财富》杂志披露其健康细节和股票期权问题而耿耿于怀。“我处于低谷的时候你们还来踩两脚。”他说。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The bigger problem at  Time Inc. was the same as the one at the <em>Times</em>: The magazine company did  not want Apple to own its subscribers and prevent it from having a direct  billing relationship. Time Inc. wanted to create apps that would direct readers  to its own website in order to buy a subscription. Apple refused. When <em>Time</em> and other magazines submitted apps that did this, they were denied the right to  be in the App Store.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
时代集团的问题和《纽约时报》一样：该集团不希望苹果公司拥有其订阅用户并阻止自己直接向用户收费。时代集团希望创建的应用程序能够将读者跳转到自己的网站上完成订阅。苹果拒绝了。《时代》杂志和其他杂志提交跳转订阅的应用程序，但均被苹果拒绝进入应用程序商店。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs tried to negotiate  personally with the CEO of Time Warner, Jeff Bewkes, a savvy pragmatist with a  no-bullshit charm to him. They had dealt with each other a few years earlier  over video rights for the iPod Touch; even though Jobs had not been able to  convince him to do a deal involving HBO’s exclusive rights to show movies soon  after their release, he admired Bewkes’s straight and decisive style. For his  part, Bewkes respected Jobs’s ability to be both a strategic thinker and a  master of the tiniest details. “Steve can go readily from the overarching  principals into the details,” he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
乔布斯试图与时代华纳的CEO杰夫·比克斯（JeffBewkes）亲自商谈；比克斯是一位精明的实用主义者，没有废话。几年前，就iPodTouch视频权的问题，两人已打过交道；乔布斯想获得美国家庭影院（HBO）的独家授权，电影播出后即可通过苹果设备下载观看，但未能成功说服比克斯；不过，他很佩服比克斯的坦率和果断。而比克斯则钦佩乔布斯既是一位战略思想家，又能掌控最微小的细节。“史蒂夫能随时从总体原则进入到细节。”他说。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>When Jobs called  Bewkes about making a deal for Time Inc. magazines on the iPad, he started off  by warning that the print business “sucks,” that “nobody really wants your  magazines,” and that Apple was offering a great opportunity to sell digital  subscriptions, but “your guys don’t get it.” Bewkes didn’t agree with any of  those premises. He said he was happy for Apple to sell digital subscriptions  for Time Inc. Apple’s 30% take was not the problem. “I’m telling you right now,  if you sell a sub for us, you can have 30%,” Bewkes told him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
乔布斯致电比克斯，提出就时代集团旗下杂志载入iPad做一笔交易；他一开始就警告说平媒业“糟透了”，“没有人真的想买你们的杂志”，苹果公司为他们提供一个销售电子版的绝好机会，但“你们这些家伙居然不接受”。比克斯完全不同意乔布斯的这些说辞。他表示，自己很愿意通过苹果公司销售时代集团的数字订阅产品，苹果公司30%的抽成也不成问题。“我现在就告诉你，你帮我们卖掉一份，就可以拿走30%。”比克斯告诉乔布斯。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>“Well, that’s more  progress than I’ve made with anybody,” Jobs replied.</p>

<p>“I have only one  question,” Bewkes continued. “If you sell a subscription to my magazine, and I  give you the 30%, who has the subscription—you or me?”</p>

<p>“I can’t give away all  the subscriber info because of Apple’s privacy policy,” Jobs replied.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>乔布斯回答说：“好啊，这已经比其他人进步多了。”</p>
<p>“我只有一个问题，”比克斯继续说道，“如果你卖掉了我的杂志订阅，我给你30%的抽成，那么订阅用户算谁的——你还是我？”</p>
<p>“鉴于苹果公司的隐私政策，我不能给你所有的订阅者信息。”乔布斯回答说。</p>

　　


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>“Well, then, we have  to figure something else out, because I don’t want my whole subscription base  to become subscribers of yours, for you to then aggregate at the Apple store,”  said Bewkes. “And the next thing you’ll do, once you have a monopoly, is come  back and tell me that my magazine shouldn’t be $4   a copy but instead should be $1. If someone subscribes to our  magazine, we need to know who it is, we need to be able to create online  communities of those people, and we need the right to pitch them directly about  renewing.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
“好吧，那么我们得把其他事槁明白，因为我不想自己的整个订阅群到你手上，成为苹果商店的订阅用户。”比克斯说道，“今后你一旦取得了垄断，就会来找我，告诉我杂志不应该每本定价4美元，而应该是1美元。如果有人订阅了我们的杂志，我们需要知道订阅者是谁，我们需要能够建立订阅者网上社区，我们需要有直接向他们发送续订信息的杈力。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs had an easier  time with Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corp. owned the <em>Wall Street Journal,  New York Post</em>, newspapers around the world, Fox Studios, and the Fox News  Channel. When Jobs met with Murdoch and his team, they also pressed the case  that they should share ownership of the subscribers that came in through the  App Store. But when Jobs refused, something interesting happened. Murdoch is  not known as a pushover, but he knew that he did not have the leverage on this  issue, so he accepted Jobs’s terms. “We would prefer to own the subscribers,  and we pushed for that,” recalled Murdoch. “But Steve wouldn’t do a deal on  those terms, so I said, ‘Okay, let’s get on with it.’ We didn’t see any reason  to mess around. He wasn’t going to bend—and I wouldn’t have bent if I were in  his position—so I just said yes.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
乔布斯与鲁珀特·默多克的进展要更为顺利。默多克新闻集团旗下拥有《华尔街日报》、《纽约邮报》，遍布全球的地方报纸，福克斯电影公司及福克斯新闻频道（FoxNewsChannel）。乔布斯会见默多克及其团队时，他们也要求拥有通过苹果应用程序商店订阅的用户信息。但是，乔布斯拒绝了他们的要求后，有趣的事情发生了。默多克并非一个易被说服的人，但是他知道自己在这个问题上并无筹码，于是接受了乔布斯的条件。“我们希望能够拥有这些订阅用户，也奋力争取了。”默多克回忆道，“但是史蒂夫不肯在这种条件下合作，于是我就说，‘好啦，那就按你说的合作吧。’我们觉得再继续浪费时间毫无意义。他不会退让，而且如果我站在他那个角度，我也不会退让，于是就同意了。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Murdoch even launched  a digital-only daily newspaper, <em>The Daily</em>, tailored specifically for the  iPad. It would be sold in the App Store, on the terms dictated by Jobs, at 99  cents a week. Murdoch himself took a team to Cupertino to show the proposed  design. Not surprisingly, Jobs hated it. “Would you allow our designers to  help?” he asked. Murdoch accepted. “The Apple designers had a crack at it,”  Murdoch recalled, “and our folks went back and had another crack, and ten days  later we went back and showed them both, and he actually liked our team’s  version better. It stunned us.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
默多克甚至还推出了一份专门为iPad量身定做的仅有电子版的报纸《日报》（TheDaily）。这份报纸将按照乔布斯的条件在苹果应用程序商店中销售，价格为每周99美分。默多克亲自带队来到库比蒂诺展示这个应用程序的设计。毫不意外，乔布斯不喜欢他们的设计。“你介意让我们的设计师来帮忙吗？”他问道。默多克没意见。“苹果的设计师尝试设计一个新方案，”默多克回忆道，“我们的人也回去做了一个新设计。10天后我们再次来到苹果公司，当时我们和苹果的设计都进行了展示，而乔布斯比较喜欢我们这个。这让我们挺吃惊的。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p><em>The Daily</em>, which was neither  tabloidy nor serious, but instead a rather midmarket product like <em>USA Today</em>,  was not very successful. But it did help create an odd-couple bonding between  Jobs and Murdoch. When Murdoch asked him to speak at his June 2010 News Corp.  annual management retreat, Jobs made an exception to his rule of never doing  such appearances. James Murdoch led him in an after-dinner interview that  lasted almost two hours. “He was very blunt and critical of what newspapers  were doing in technology,” Murdoch recalled. “He told us we were going to find  it hard to get things right, because you’re in New York, and anyone who’s any  good at tech works in Silicon Valley.” This did not go down very well with the  president of the Wall Street Journal Digital Network, Gordon McLeod, who pushed  back a bit. At the end, McLeod came up to Jobs and said, “Thanks, it was a  wonderful evening, but you probably just cost me my job.” Murdoch chuckled a  bit when he described the scene to me. “It ended up being true,” he said.  McLeod was out within three months.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
《日报》并非小报，也不是严肃报纸，而是类似《今日美国》（USAToday）这样的中端产品。然而这份电子报并不是很成功。但它却让乔布斯和默多克建立了亲密的关系。默多克准备在2010年6月举行新闻集团年度管理层集思会，并请乔布斯前来发言；乔布斯的原则是从不出席这样的活动，但这次却破例接受了默多克的邀请。晚宴后，詹姆斯·默多克主持了一个近两小时的采访。“对于报纸在技术上的表现，他非常不客气地进行了批评。”默多克回忆道，“他对我们说，我们很难走上正轨，因为我们在纽约，而擅长技术的人都在硅谷。”时任《华尔街日报》数字网络部门总裁的戈登·麦克劳德（GonkmMcLeod）并不能完全接受乔布斯的说法，他略微进行了反驳。最后，麦克劳德来到乔布斯跟前说：“谢谢，这是一个美好的夜晚，但是你可能会砸了我的饭碗。”默多克向我描述当时的场景时轻声笑了笑。“最后确实是这样。”他说。采访过后不到3个月，麦克劳德就离职了。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>In return for speaking  at the retreat, Jobs got Murdoch to hear him out on Fox News, which he believed  was destructive, harmful to the nation, and a blot on Murdoch’s reputation.  “You’re blowing it with Fox News,” Jobs told him over dinner. “The axis today  is not liberal and conservative, the axis is constructive-destructive, and  you’ve cast your lot with the destructive people. Fox has become an incredibly  destructive force in our society. You can be better, and this is going to be  your legacy if you’re not careful.” Jobs said he thought Murdoch did not really  like how far Fox had gone. “Rupert’s a builder, not a tearer-downer,” he said.  “I’ve had some meetings with James, and I think he agrees with me. I can just  tell.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
作为在新闻集团集思会上讲话的回报，默多克得洗耳恭听乔布斯对福克斯新闻网的看法。乔布斯认为福克斯新闻具有破坏性，对整个国家都有危害，并且会是默多克的一个名誉污点。福克斯新闻搞砸了，”乔布斯在晚餐时对默多克说，“现在的核心问题不再是自由派和保守派，而是破坏性和建设性，而你们却和具有破坏性的人同流合污。福克斯已经成为我们社会一个非常具有破坏性的力量。你们可以做得更好；如果你再不注意，就会遗臭万年。”乔布斯认为默多克对福克斯的发展并不满意。“鲁珀特是一个建设者，而非破坏者，”乔布斯说，“我和詹姆斯见过几面，我认为他也同意我的看法。我看得出来。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Murdoch later said he  was used to people like Jobs complaining about Fox. “He’s got sort of a  left-wing view on this,” he said. Jobs asked him to have his folks make a reel  of a week of Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck shows—he thought that they were more  destructive than Bill O’Reilly—and Murdoch agreed to do so. Jobs later told me  that he was going to ask Jon Stewart’s team to put together a similar reel for  Murdoch to watch. “I’d be happy to see it,” Murdoch said, “but he hasn’t sent  it to me.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
默多克后来表示，自己已经习惯了乔布斯这样的人抱怨福克斯。“在这个问题上，他有点儿左翼倾向。”默多克说。乔布斯让默多克的员工把肖恩·汉尼提（SeanHannity）和格伦·贝克（GlenBeck）—周的节目做个合辑，他觉得这两人比起比尔·奥赖利（BillO-Reilly）的节目更具破坏性。乔布斯后来告诉我，他也要乔恩·斯图尔特（JonStewart）的团队做一辑类似的节目给默多克看。默多克表示：“我会很高兴看到这些节目，但是他没有告诉我这件事。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Murdoch and Jobs hit  it off well enough that Murdoch went to his Palo Alto house for dinner twice  more during the next year. Jobs joked that he had to hide the dinner knives on  such occasions, because he was afraid that his liberal wife was going to  eviscerate Murdoch when he walked in. For his part, Murdoch was reported to  have uttered a great line about the organic vegan dishes typically served:  “Eating dinner at Steve’s is a great experience, as long as you get out before  the local restaurants close.” Alas, when I asked Murdoch if he had ever said  that, he didn’t recall it.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
默多克和乔布斯相处融洽。第二年，他曾不止一次前往乔布斯在帕洛奥图的家，共进晚餐。乔布斯开玩笑说，默多克要来的时候，他得把餐刀藏起来，怕妻子会把默多克开膛破肚。据说，默多克曾打趣乔布斯家的有机菜肴：“在史蒂夫家吃晚饭是一个很棒的经历，只要能赶在当地餐馆打烊前出来就好。”遗憾的是，当我询问默多克是否说过这句话时，他已经记不得了。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>One visit came early  in 2011. Murdoch was due to pass through Palo Alto on February 24, and he  texted Jobs to tell him so. He didn’t know it was Jobs’s fifty-sixth birthday,  and Jobs didn’t mention it when he texted back inviting him to dinner. “It was  my way of making sure Laurene didn’t veto the plan,” Jobs joked. “It was my  birthday, so she had to let me have Rupert over.” Erin and Eve were there, and  Reed jogged over from Stanford near the end of the dinner. Jobs showed off the  designs for his planned boat, which Murdoch thought looked beautiful on the  inside but “a bit plain” on the outside. “It certainly shows great optimism  about his health that he was talking so much about building it,” Murdoch later  said.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
2011年初，按照默多克的行程安排，他将于2月24日经过帕洛奥图，于是他发了条短信给乔布斯。他不知道那一天是乔布斯的56岁生日，乔布斯回短信邀请默多克共进晚餐时也没提起这个特殊的日子。“这是为了防止劳伦不让他来，”乔布斯开玩笑说，“那天是我的生日，所以她只得同意我把鲁珀特叫来。”埃琳和伊芙当时也在，里德在晚餐快结束时才从斯坦福大学慢悠悠地过来。乔布斯展示了自己的游艇设计，默多克觉得内部很漂亮，可是外部“有些简单”默多克后来说，“他说了很多建造这艘游艇的事情，显然，他的健康状况挺乐观。”

<p>At dinner they talked  about the importance of infusing an entrepreneurial and nimble culture into a  company. Sony failed to do that, Murdoch said. Jobs agreed. “I used to believe  that a really big company couldn’t have a clear corporate culture,” Jobs said.  “But I now believe it can be done. Murdoch’s done it. I think I’ve done it at  Apple.”</p>

晚餐时，他们谈到了在企业中注入创业精神和敏捷文化的重要性。默多克认为索尼公司未能做到这一点，乔布斯表示赞同。“我曾认为，一家真正的大企业不可能具有鲜明的企业文化，”乔布斯说，“但是，现在我相信这是可能的。默多克就做到了，我觉得我在苹果公司也做到了。”

<p>Most of the dinner  conversation was about education. Murdoch had just hired Joel Klein, the former  chancellor of the New York City Department of Education, to start a digital  curriculum division. Murdoch recalled that Jobs was somewhat dismissive of the  idea that technology could transform education. But Jobs agreed with Murdoch  that the paper textbook business would be blown away by digital learning  materials.</p>

晚餐上大部分谈话都围着着教育展开。默多克刚刚聘请了乔尔·克莱因（JoelKlein）负责启动数字课程部门；克莱因曾担任纽约市教育局局长。默多克回忆说，对于技术能够改变教育的观点，乔布斯有些不屑一顾。但是乔布斯和默多克都认为，纸质教科书业务将会被数字学习材料淘汰。

<p>In fact Jobs had his  sights set on textbooks as the next business he wanted to transform. He  believed it was an $8 billion a year industry ripe for digital destruction. He  was also struck by the fact that many schools, for security reasons, don’t have  lockers, so kids have to lug a heavy backpack around. “The iPad would solve  that,” he said. His idea was to hire great textbook writers to create digital  versions, and make them a feature of the iPad. In addition, he held meetings  with the major publishers, such as Pearson Education, about partnering with  Apple. “The process by which states certify textbooks is corrupt,” he said.  “But if we can make the textbooks free, and they come with the iPad, then they  don’t have to be certified. The crappy economy at the state level will last for  a decade, and we can give them an opportunity to circumvent that whole process  and save money.”</p>

<p>事实上，教科书领域是乔布斯的下一个变革目标。他认为，现在是时候让数字技术摧毁这个每年80亿美元的产业了。许多学校出于安全考虑，没有储物柜,以至于孩子们得背着沉重的书包上下学，这也令乔布斯感到震惊。“iPad会解决这个问题。”他说。乔布斯想要聘请优秀的教科书编写者来制作电子版教科书，并让其成为iPad的一个特色。此外，他还与主要教材出版商会面，如培生教育出版集团（PearsonEducation）,商议合作。“国家认证教材的过程很腐败。”乔布斯说，“但是如果我们让教材免费，在iPad上提供教材，那么就无须认证这个环节。美国糟糕的经济形势还会持续十年，我们这样做可以帮政府规避认证流程，把这部分钱省下来。”</p>
