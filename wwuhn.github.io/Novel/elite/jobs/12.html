<div class="left"><h3>A Bauhaus Aesthetic</h3>
<p>Unlike most kids who  grew up in Eichler homes, Jobs knew what they were and why they were so  wonderful. He liked the notion of simple and clean modernism produced for the  masses. He also loved listening to his father describe the styling intricacies  of various cars. So from the beginning at Apple, he believed that great  industrial design—a colorfully simple logo, a sleek case for the Apple II—would  set the company apart and make its products distinctive.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<h3>包豪斯式的美学标准</h3>

<p>和大多数在埃奇勒建造的房子中长大的孩子不同，乔布了解这些房子，也知道它们好在哪里。他喜欢“面向大众的简洁现代主义设计”这个概念。他还喜欢听父亲讲述不同的汽车上纷繁的设计细节。所以，从苹果公司建立之初，他就相信杰出的工业设计——多彩简单的标志以及AppleII使用的雅致时髦的箱子——可以突出自己的公司，也让公司的产品显得与众不同。</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The company’s first  office, after it moved out of his family garage, was in a small building it  shared with a Sony sales office. Sony was famous for its signature style and  memorable product designs, so Jobs would drop by to study the marketing  material. “He would come in looking scruffy and fondle the product brochures  and point out design features,” said Dan’l Lewin, who worked there. “Every now  and then, he would ask, ‘Can I take this brochure?’” By 1980, he had hired  Lewin.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>在公司搬出乔布斯的车库后，第一个办公场所在一栋小建筑里，这里还有索尼公司的一处销售办事处。索尼以其独特的风格和令人难的产品设计而闻名，所以乔布斯经常到他们的办公室去研究宣传材料。“他走进来，邋里邋遢的，抚弄着产品宣传册，指出一些产品设计上的特点。”在那儿工作的丹·卢因（Dan-lLewin）说，“时不时地，他还会问我：‘我能把这个册子拿走吗？’”到1980年，乔布斯把卢因聘请到了苹果公司。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>His fondness for the  dark, industrial look of Sony receded around June 1981, when he began attending  the annual International Design Conference in Aspen. The meeting that year  focused on Italian style, and it featured the architect-designer Mario Bellini,  the filmmaker Bernardo Bertolucci, the car maker Sergio Pininfarina, and the  Fiat heiress and politician Susanna Agnelli. “I had come to revere the Italian  designers, just like the kid in <em>Breaking Away</em> reveres the Italian  bikers,” recalled Jobs, “so it was an amazing inspiration.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>从1981年6月开始，乔布斯开始参加在阿斯彭举办的一年一度的国际设计大会（InternationalDesignConference），这一时期，他对暗色调、工业气息十足的索尼设计的喜爱逐渐减弱。那年会议的焦点是意大利风格，出席的有建筑师兼设计师马里奥、贝里尼（MarioBellini），电影制片人贝纳多·贝托鲁奇（BernardoBertolucci）,汽车制造商塞尔吉奥·平尼法瑞那（SergioPininfarina）和菲亚特汽车公司的女继承人、政治家苏珊娜·阿涅利（SusannaAgnelli）。“我就是去膜拜那些意大利设计师的，就好像电影《告别昨日》（BreakingAcoay）中的孩子膜拜意大利自行车手一样。”乔布斯回忆说，“那次会议真是一个奇妙的启示。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>In Aspen he was  exposed to the spare and functional design philosophy of the Bauhaus movement,  which was enshrined by Herbert Bayer in the buildings, living suites, sans serif  font typography, and furniture on the Aspen Institute campus. Like his mentors  Walter Gropius and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Bayer believed that there should  be no distinction between fine art and applied industrial design. The modernist  International Style championed by the Bauhaus taught that design should be  simple, yet have an expressive spirit. It emphasized rationality and  functionality by employing clean lines and forms. Among the maxims preached by  Mies and Gropius were “God is in the details” and “Less is more.” As with  Eichler homes, the artistic sensibility was combined with the capability for  mass production.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>在阿斯彭，乔布斯接触到了包豪斯运动干净、实用的设计理念，这一理念深受赫伯特·拜尔（HerbertBayer）的推崇，被他运用到了建筑、家居房屋、无衬线字体排印以及阿斯彭研究所的家具上。拜尔和他的导师沃尔特·格罗皮乌斯（WalterGropius）以及路德维希·密斯·凡德罗（LudwigMiesvanderRohe）—样，也认为艺术和应用工业设计之间不应该有区别。包豪斯拥护的现代主义国际风格告诉人们，设计应该追求简约，同时具有表现精神。它通过运用干净的线条和形式来强调合理性和功能性。密斯和格罗皮乌斯宣扬的准则中就有“上帝就在细节之中”和“少即是多”这样的话。正如埃奇勒的房屋一样，艺术敏感性和大规模生产的能力结合到了一起。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs publicly  discussed his embrace of the Bauhaus style in a talk he gave at the 1983 design  conference, the theme of which was “The Future Isn’t What It Used to Be.” He  predicted the passing of the Sony style in favor of Bauhaus simplicity. “The  current wave of industrial design is Sony’s high-tech look, which is gunmetal  gray, maybe paint it black, do weird stuff to it,” he said. “It’s easy to do  that. But it’s not great.” He proposed an alternative, born of the Bauhaus,  that was more true to the function and nature of the products. “What we’re  going to do is make the products high-tech, and we’re going to package them  cleanly so that you know they’re high-tech. We will fit them in a small  package, and then we can make them beautiful and white, just like Braun does  with its electronics.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>1983年的阿斯彭设计大会上，乔布斯发表了一篇以“未来绝对不会和过去相同”为主题的演讲，公开阐述他对包豪斯风格的热情拥护。演讲在一个巨大的音乐帐篷中举行，乔布斯称赞了包豪斯风格的简单朴素，也预言了索尼风格的消亡。“当下工业设计的潮流就是索尼的那种髙科技感，也就是金属灰色，要么就涂成黑色，加一些怪异的设计。”他说，“这么做很容易，但不够好。”他提出了一个源自包豪斯风格的替代方案，更加忠实于产品的功能和本性：“我们要做的，就是让产品科技感十足，然后用上简单干净的包装，让科技感一目了然。我们会把产品放在小包装盒里，让它们看上去纯白漂亮，就像博朗生产的电器一样。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>He repeatedly  emphasized that Apple’s products would be clean and simple. “We will make them  bright and pure and honest about being high-tech, rather than a heavy  industrial look of black, black, black, black, like Sony,” he preached. “So  that’s our approach. Very simple, and we’re really shooting for Museum of  Modern Art quality. The way we’re running the company, the product design, the  advertising, it all comes down to this: Let’s make it simple. Really simple.”  Apple’s design mantra would remain the one featured on its first brochure:  “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>他反复强调苹果公司的产品会是干净而简涪的。“我们会把产品做得光亮又纯净，能展现高科技感，而不是一味使用黑色、黑色、黑色，满是沉重的工业感，就像索尼那样。”他朗声说道，“我们的设计思想就是：极致的简约，我们追求的是能让产品达到在现代艺术博物馆展出的品质。我们管理公司、设计产品、广告宣传的理念就是一句话：让我们做得简单一点，真正的简单。”苹果奉行的这一原则也在它的第一版宣传册上得到了突出：“至繁归于至简。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs felt that design  simplicity should be linked to making products easy to use. Those goals do not  always go together. Sometimes a design can be so sleek and simple that a user  finds it intimidating or unfriendly to navigate. “The main thing in our design  is that we have to make things intuitively obvious,” Jobs told the crowd of  design mavens. For example, he extolled the desktop metaphor he was creating  for the Macintosh. “People know how to deal with a desktop intuitively. If you  walk into an office, there are papers on the desk. The one on the top is the  most important. People know how to switch priority. Part of the reason we model  our computers on metaphors like the desktop is that we can leverage this  experience people already have.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯认为，简约化设计的一个核心要素就是让人能直观地感觉到它的简单易用。设计上的简单并不总能带来操作上的简易。有时候，设计得太漂亮、太简化，用户用起来反而不会那么得心应手。“我们作设计的时候，最重要的事情就是让产品特性一目了然。”乔布斯告诉一群设计专家。作为例子，他高度赞扬自己为麦金塔电脑创造的桌面概念：“人们直观上就知道该怎么处理桌面。你走进办公室，桌子上有一堆文件。放在最上面的就是最重要的。人们知道怎样转换优先级。我们在设计电脑的时候引入桌面这个概念，一定程度上就是想充分利用人们已经拥有的这一经验。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Speaking at the same  time as Jobs that Wednesday afternoon, but in a smaller seminar room, was Maya  Lin, twenty-three, who had been catapulted into fame the previous November when  her Vietnam Veterans Memorial was dedicated in Washington, D.C. They struck up  a close friendship, and Jobs invited her to visit Apple. “I came to work with  Steve for a week,” Lin recalled. “I asked him, ‘Why do computers look like  clunky TV sets? Why don’t you make something thin? Why not a flat laptop?’”  Jobs replied that this was indeed his goal, as soon as the technology was  ready.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>那个周三下午，在乔布斯演讲的同时，另一场演讲正在一个小型会议室里进行，发言人是23岁的林璎（MayaLin）。前一年的11月份，林瓔设计的越南战争纪念碑在华盛顿落成，她也因此一举成名。乔布斯和她成了亲密的朋友，并邀请她访问苹果公司。有林璎这样的人在身边的时候，乔布斯会有些羞怯，于是他找来了黛比·科尔曼，带着林璎参观。“我和史蒂夫一起工作了一个星期，”林璎回忆说，“我问他，为什么电脑看上去就像笨重的电视机？为什么你们不把它做得薄一点儿？为什么不做成平板的便携式电脑？”乔布斯回答说那正是他的目标，只是现在技术还没有成熟。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>At that time there was  not much exciting happening in the realm of industrial design, Jobs felt. He  had a Richard Sapper lamp, which he admired, and he also liked the furniture of  Charles and Ray Eames and the Braun products of Dieter Rams. But there were no  towering figures energizing the world of industrial design the way that Raymond  Loewy and Herbert Bayer had done. “There really wasn’t much going on in  industrial design, particularly in Silicon Valley, and Steve was very eager to  change that,” said Lin. “His design sensibility is sleek but not slick, and  it’s playful. He embraced minimalism, which came from his Zen devotion to  simplicity, but he avoided allowing that to make his products cold. They stayed  fun. He’s passionate and super-serious about design, but at the same time  there’s a sense of play.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>那一时期，乔布斯觉得工业设计领域没有多少令人兴奋的事情。他有一盏理查德·萨珀（RichardSapper）设计的台灯，这是他很欣赏的一个作品，同时，他还喜欢伊姆斯夫妇（CharlesandRayEames）设计的家具，以及迪特尔·拉姆斯（DieterRams）设计的博朗产品。但没有人能像当年的雷蒙德·洛伊（RaymondLoewy）和赫伯特·拜尔两位大师一样，推动工业设计领域的发展。“工业设计界真的没有什么激动人心的事情，尤其是在硅谷，而史蒂夫急切盼望改变这一局面。”林璎说，“他的设计理念是：造型优美，但不能华而不实，同时还要充满乐趣。他崇尚极简派的设计风格，这源自他作为一名佛教禅宗信徒对简单的热爱，同时他又竭力避免陷入过度的简单而让产品显得冷冰冰的，要使产品的趣味感得以保留。他对待设计充满热情、极其严肃，同时，其中也带有一点玩乐精神。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>As Jobs’s design  sensibilities evolved, he became particularly attracted to the Japanese style  and began hanging out with its stars, such as Issey Miyake and I. M. Pei. His  Buddhist training was a big influence. “I have always found Buddhism, Japanese  Zen Buddhism in particular, to be aesthetically sublime,” he said. “The most  sublime thing I’ve ever seen are the gardens around Kyoto. I’m deeply moved by  what that culture has produced, and it’s directly from Zen Buddhism.”

</div>
<div class="right">
<p>随着乔布斯设计鉴赏力的不断提升，他开始尤其青睐日式风格，还渐渐地和三宅一生及贝聿铭这样的明星人物进行更多接触，比如他的禅修对此有很大的影响。“我一直都认为佛教——尤其是日本的佛教禅宗——在审美上是超群的。”他说，“我见过的最美的设计，就是京都地区的花园，这一文化的产物深深打动了我，而它们都直接源自佛教禅宗。”

<h3><a name="s2" id="s2"></a>Like a Porsche</h3>
<p>Jef Raskin’s vision  for the Macintosh was that it would be like a boxy carry-on suitcase, which  would be closed by flipping up the keyboard over the front screen. When Jobs  took over the project, he decided to sacrifice portability for a distinctive  design that wouldn’t take up much space on a desk. He plopped down a phone book  and declared, to the horror of the engineers, that it shouldn’t have a  footprint larger than that. So his design team of Jerry Manock and Terry Oyama  began working on ideas that had the screen above the computer box, with a  keyboard that was detachable.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<h3>像保时捷那样</h3>

<p>杰夫·拉斯金设想中的麦金塔电脑就像一只四四方方的手提箱，可以将键盘翻起来盖住屏幕从而合上电脑箱。乔布斯接管项目之后，他决定牺牲便携性，改用一个不会占用太多桌面空间的独特设计。他把一本电话簿扔到众人面前，然后宣布，电脑占用的桌面面积不能超过这本电话簿，这让一群工程师吓傻了眼。于是，设计团队的负责人杰里·马诺克和他雇来的天才设计师大山特里（TerryOyama）开始研究一个方案：将屏幕放到机箱的上方，再用上可拆卸的键盘。</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>One day in March 1981,  Andy Hertzfeld came back to the office from dinner to find Jobs hovering over  their one Mac prototype in intense discussion with the creative services  director, James Ferris. “We need it to have a classic look that won’t go out of  style, like the Volkswagen Beetle,” Jobs said. From his father he had developed  an appreciation for the contours of classic cars.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>1981年3月的一天，安迪·赫茨菲尔德吃完饭回到办公室，发现乔布斯正站在一台麦金塔样机旁，和公司的创意总监詹姆斯·费里斯（JamesFerris）激烈地争论着。“我们要设计出一个经典的外形，不会过时的那种，就像大众的甲壳虫汽车一样。”乔布斯说。受他父亲的影响，他对经典车型的外形轮廓十分赞赏。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>“No, that’s not  right,” Ferris replied. “The lines should be voluptuous, like a Ferrari.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“不，不对，”费里斯说，“外形应该很性感诱人，就像法拉利那样。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>“Not a Ferrari, that’s  not right either,” Jobs countered. “It should be more like a Porsche!” Jobs  owned a Porsche 928 at the time. When Bill Atkinson was over one weekend, Jobs  brought him outside to admire the car. “Great art stretches the taste, it  doesn’t follow tastes,” he told Atkinson. He also admired the design of the  Mercedes. “Over the years, they’ve made the lines softer but the details  starker,” he said one day as he walked around the parking lot. “That’s what we  have to do with the Macintosh.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“法拉利也不对，”乔布斯反驳，“应该更像保时捷！”这么说并不奇怪，乔布斯当时就拥有一辆保时捷928。（费里斯后来离开了苹果公司，到保时捷担任广告经理。）一个周末，比尔·阿特金森来了，乔布斯把他带到外面去欣赏那辆保时捷。他告诉阿特金森：“伟大的艺术品不必追随潮流，它们自身就可以引领潮流。”他还十分欣赏奔驰汽车的设计。“多年来，他们把汽车的线条做得更加柔和，但细节之处的用心依然清晰可见，”一次他在停车场周围散步时说，“这正是我们要在麦金塔电脑上实现的目标。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Oyama drafted a  preliminary design and had a plaster model made. The Mac team gathered around  for the unveiling and expressed their thoughts. Hertzfeld called it “cute.”  Others also seemed satisfied. Then Jobs let loose a blistering burst of criticism.  “It’s way too boxy, it’s got to be more curvaceous. The radius of the first  chamfer needs to be bigger, and I don’t like the size of the bevel.” With his  new fluency in industrial design lingo, Jobs was referring to the angular or  curved edge connecting the sides of the computer. But then he gave a resounding  compliment. “It’s a start,” he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>大山特里拟出了一个初步设计方案，并制作了一个石膏模型。Mac团队的成员们聚集到一起观看展示然后发表自己的看法。赫茨菲尔德大赞“可爱”，其他人似乎也很满意。但乔布斯却给出了猛烈的批评：“这造型太方正了，必须再多一些曲线美的感觉。第一个倒角的半径要再大一点儿，斜角的尺寸我也不大喜欢。”他把刚刚熟练掌握的工业设计术语用上了，其实指的就是电脑相邻两个面之间的弯曲过渡。但紧接着，乔布斯还是给出了一句响亮的称赞。他说：“这是一个开始。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Every month or so,  Manock and Oyama would present a new iteration based on Jobs’s previous  criticisms. The latest plaster model would be dramatically unveiled, and all  the previous attempts would be lined up next to it. That not only helped them  gauge the design’s evolution, but it prevented Jobs from insisting that one of  his suggestions had been ignored. “By the fourth model, I could barely  distinguish it from the third one,” said Hertzfeld, “but Steve was always  critical and decisive, saying he loved or hated a detail that I could barely  perceive.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>每一个月左右，马诺克和大山都会将这样的流程重复一次，当然是根据乔布斯前一次的枇评进行了改进。每次最新的模型都会像变戏法一样现出庐山真面目，而前几次的模型则在它旁边一字排开。这不仅有助于大家对改进之处给予评价，也能防止乔布斯坚称自己的某条建议或意见被忽视了。“到第四个模型的时候，我已经很难看出它跟上一个之间的不同了。”赫茨菲尔德说，“但史蒂夫总是很挑剔也很肯定地说，他喜欢或者讨厌某个细节，而他说的东西是我几乎无法觉察到的。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>One weekend Jobs went  to Macy’s in Palo Alto and again spent time studying appliances, especially the  Cuisinart. He came bounding into the Mac office that Monday, asked the design  team to go buy one, and made a raft of new suggestions based on its lines,  curves, and bevels.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>一个周末，乔布斯去了帕洛奥图的梅西百货，又开始研究各种电器，特别是厨艺公司的产品。周一，他冲进办公室，让设计团队去买了一台厨艺公司的电器，然后根据它的轮廓、曲线和斜角提出了一系列新的建议。于是大山尝试了一种新的设计，但看上去就像是一台厨房电器，乔布斯觉得行不通。这让整个进程停顿了一个星期，最终，乔布斯还是批准了Mac的机箱设计。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs kept insisting  that the machine should look friendly. As a result, it evolved to resemble a  human face. With the disk drive built in below the screen, the unit was taller  and narrower than most computers, suggesting a head. The recess near the base  evoked a gentle chin, and Jobs narrowed the strip of plastic at the top so that  it avoided the Neanderthal forehead that made the Lisa subtly unattractive. The  patent for the design of the Apple case was issued in the name of Steve Jobs as  well as Manock and Oyama. “Even though Steve didn’t draw any of the lines, his  ideas and inspiration made the design what it is,” Oyama later said. “To be  honest, we didn’t know what it meant for a computer to be ‘friendly’ until  Steve told us.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯一直坚持电脑的外形必须友好。所以，它不断地改进，看上去就像一张人脸。磁盘驱动器安装在屏幕的下方，使得整台机器比大多数电脑都要狭长，使人联想到一张脸。靠近底座有一块凹进去的地方，就像是下巴；乔布斯还把顶端的塑料边框变得更细，这样麦金塔就不会像丽萨那样有个克鲁马努人（Cro-Magnon）般的额头，外形更加好看。这款苹果机箱的设计专利属于史蒂夫·乔布斯、杰里·马诺克和大山特里。“虽然这个设计不是史蒂夫亲手画出来的，但正是他的思想和灵感成就了这个设计。”大山后来说，“老实说，在史蒂夫告诉我们之前，我们根本不知道电脑的‘友好’指的是什么。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs obsessed with  equal intensity about the look of what would appear on the screen. One day Bill  Atkinson burst into Texaco Towers all excited. He had just come up with a  brilliant algorithm that could draw circles and ovals onscreen quickly. The  math for making circles usually required calculating square roots, which the  68000 microprocessor didn’t support. But Atkinson did a workaround based on the  fact that the sum of a sequence of odd numbers produces a sequence of perfect  squares (for example, 1 + 3 = 4, 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, etc.). Hertzfeld recalled that  when Atkinson fired up his demo, everyone was impressed except Jobs. “Well,  circles and ovals are good,” he said, “but how about drawing rectangles with  rounded corners?”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯对于屏幕上显示的内容也同样痴迷。有一天，比尔·阿特金森兴奋地冲进德士古塔。他刚刚想出了一个绝妙的算法，可以在屏幕上快速画出和椭圆。要在屏幕上画圆，通常需要计算平方根，而68000微处理器并不支持这个功能。但阿特金森想出了一个变通的方法，因为他发现，一组奇数序列相加，可以得到一组完全平方数序列（例如，1+3=4，1+3+5=9,等等）。赫茨菲尔德回忆说，在阿特金森演示的时候，所有人都震惊了，除了乔布斯。“圆和椭圆挺好的，”他说，“不过，要是能画出带圆角的矩形，你觉得怎么样？”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>“I don’t think we  really need it,” said Atkinson, who explained that it would be almost  impossible to do. “I wanted to keep the graphics routines lean and limit them  to the primitives that truly needed to be done,” he recalled.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“我认为我们用不着这个。”阿特金森说道，他解释说那几乎是不可能做到的。“我想把图形程序做得精简一点，能满足基本的需要就可以了。”他回忆道。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>“Rectangles with  rounded corners are everywhere!” Jobs said, jumping up and getting more  intense. “Just look around this room!” He pointed out the whiteboard and the  tabletop and other objects that were rectangular with rounded corners. “And  look outside, there’s even more, practically everywhere you look!” He dragged  Atkinson out for a walk, pointing out car windows and billboards and street  signs. “Within three blocks, we found seventeen examples,” said Jobs. “I  started pointing them out everywhere until he was completely convinced.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“圆角矩形到处都有啊！”乔布斯说着就跳了起来，显得更加激动，“你就看看这个房间里！”他指出白板、桌面和其他一些东西都是带圆角的矩形。“你再看看外面，更多，基本上哪儿都有！”他把阿特金森拖出去转了一圈，指着车窗、广告牌和街道指示牌给他看。“走了3条街，我们发现了17处这样的例子，”乔布斯说，“走到哪里我都能指出来，后来他完全信服了。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>“When he finally got  to a No Parking sign, I said, ‘Okay, you’re right, I give up. We need to have a  rounded-corner rectangle as a primitive!’” Hertzfeld recalled, “Bill returned  to Texaco Towers the following afternoon, with a big smile on his face. His  demo was now drawing rectangles with beautifully rounded corners blisteringly  fast.” The dialogue boxes and windows on the Lisa and the Mac, and almost every  other subsequent computer, ended up being rendered with rounded corners.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“最后直到他指着一个‘禁止停车’的标示牌时，我说：‘好了，你说对了，我认输。圆角矩形也要成为我们电脑上的基本要素。’”正如赫茨菲尔德回忆的：“第二天下午，比尔回到了德士古塔，脸上带着大大的微笑。他在演示中可以飞快地画出漂亮的圆角矩形。”在丽萨和麦金塔，以及后来几乎所有的苹果电脑中，对话框和窗口都带上了圆角。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>At the calligraphy  class he had audited at Reed, Jobs learned to love typefaces, with all of their  serif and sans serif variations, proportional spacing, and leading. “When we  were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me,” he later  said of that class. Because the Mac was bitmapped, it was possible to devise an  endless array of fonts, ranging from the elegant to the wacky, and render them  pixel by pixel on the screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>还在里德学院的时候，乔布斯在旁听书法课时爱上了各种衬线字体和无紂线字体，以及合适的字距和行距。“在我们设计第一台麦金塔电脑的时候，当年的记忆都冒了出来。”他后来在谈及书法课的时候说。因为Mac采用了位图显示，它可以支持无数种字体——从优雅的到古怪的，然后在屏幕上逐个像素地显现出来。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>To design these fonts,  Hertzfeld recruited a high school friend from suburban Philadelphia, Susan  Kare. They named the fonts after the stops on Philadelphia’s Main Line commuter  train: Overbrook, Merion, Ardmore, and Rosemont. Jobs found the process  fascinating. Late one afternoon he stopped by and started brooding about the  font names. They were “little cities that nobody’s ever heard of,” he  complained. “They ought to be <em>world-class</em> cities!” The fonts were  renamed Chicago, New York, Geneva, London, San Francisco, Toronto, and Venice.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>为了设计这些字体，赫茨菲尔德招募了来自费城郊区的髙中好友苏珊·卡雷（SusanKare）。在给这些字体命名时，他们采用了费城梅因莱恩区火车线路上车站的名字：欧弗布鲁克（Overbrook）、梅里昂（Merion）、阿德莫尔（Ardmore）和罗斯蒙特（Rosemont）。乔布斯觉得这一过程十分有趣。一天傍晚，乔布斯路过他们那里，也开始想字体的名字。那都是些“从没有人听说过的小地方”，他抱怨说，“应该用世界级的大城市来命名！”卡雷说，正是这个原因，才有了现在的这些字体名字：芝加哥、纽约、日内瓦、伦敦、旧金山、多伦多和威尼斯。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">

<p>Markkula and some  others could never quite appreciate Jobs’s obsession with typography. “His  knowledge of fonts was remarkable, and he kept insisting on having great ones,”  Markkula recalled. “I kept saying, ‘Fonts?!? Don’t we have more important  things to do?’” In fact the delightful assortment of Macintosh fonts, when  combined with laser-writer printing and great graphics capabilities, would help  launch the desktop publishing industry and be a boon for Apple’s bottom line.  It also introduced all sorts of regular folks, ranging from high school  journalists to moms who edited PTA newsletters, to the quirky joy of knowing  about fonts, which was once reserved for printers, grizzled editors, and other  ink-stained wretches.</p>

<p>马库拉和其他一些人从来都无法欣赏乔布斯对于版面设计的痴迷。“他对于字体的了解是很让我们惊讶的，而且他一直坚持要设计好看的字体。”马库拉回忆说，“我一直说：‘字体？！？难道我们没有更重要的事情了吗？’”事实上，麦金塔上各种漂亮的字体，再结合激光打印技术和强大的图形功能，推动了桌面出版产业的诞生，也成为了苹果公司赢利点。同时，它也让普通人——不管是中学校报记者还是编辑PTA（家长和教师联谊会）时事通讯的母亲，都享受到了掌握字体知识带来的奇异乐趣，而这种乐趣，之前只有印刷工人、满头白发的编辑和其他跟油墨打交道的人才能体会得到。

<p>Kare also developed  the icons, such as the trash can for discarding files, that helped define  graphical interfaces. She and Jobs hit it off because they shared an instinct  for simplicity along with a desire to make the Mac whimsical. “He usually came  in at the end of every day,” she said. “He’d always want to know what was new,  and he’s always had good taste and a good sense for visual details.” Sometimes  he came in on Sunday morning, so Kare made it a point to be there working.  Every now and then, she would run into a problem. He rejected one of her  renderings of a rabbit, an icon for speeding up the mouse-click rate, saying  that the furry creature looked “too gay.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>卡雷也开发了图标——例如放置被删除文件的垃圾箱，这是图形界面中不可缺少的。她和乔布斯很合得来，因为他们都喜欢简约设计，也都想让Mac成为一台充满创意的电脑。“他通常在一天快要结束的时候过来，”她回忆说，“他总想知道最新的进展，他品位一流，而且对视觉细节的判断也很准确。”有时候，乔布斯会在星期天早上过来，所以卡雷那个时间段都会在工作岗位上，好向他展示最新的成果。她会时不时地遭到否定。她设计了一个兔子图标，用来表示增加鼠标的点击速率，但遭到了乔布斯的反对，理由是这个毛茸茸的生物看上去“太娘娘腔了”。

<p>Jobs lavished similar  attention on the title bars atop windows and documents. He had Atkinson and  Kare do them over and over again as he agonized over their look. He did not  like the ones on the Lisa because they were too black and harsh. He wanted the  ones on the Mac to be smoother, to have pinstripes. “We must have gone through  twenty different title bar designs before he was happy,” Atkinson recalled. At  one point Kare and Atkinson complained that he was making them spend too much  time on tiny little tweaks to the title bar when they had bigger things to do.  Jobs erupted. “Can you imagine looking at that every day?” he shouted. “It’s  not just a little thing, it’s something we have to do right.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯在窗口、文件以及屏幕顶端的标题栏上也耗费了大量精力。他要求阿特金森和卡雷反复修改，因为他对标题栏的样子总是不满意。乔布斯不喜欢丽萨上使用的标题栏，因为它们太黑、太粗糙了。他希望Mac上的标题栏能够更加平滑，再有些细条纹。“我们做了20种不同的标题栏才让他满意。”阿特金森回忆说。卡雷和阿特金森曾一度抱怨说乔布斯在标题栏的修改上耗费了他们太多时间，而他们有更重要的事情要做。乔布斯大发脾气。“你能想象一下每天都要看着它是什么感觉吗？”他吼道，“这不是个小事，这是我们必须做好的事！”

<p>Chris Espinosa found  one way to satisfy Jobs’s design demands and control-freak tendencies. One of  Wozniak’s youthful acolytes from the days in the garage, Espinosa had been  convinced to drop out of Berkeley by Jobs, who argued that he would always have  a chance to study, but only one chance to work on the Mac. On his own, he  decided to design a calculator for the computer. “We all gathered around as  Chris showed the calculator to Steve and then held his breath, waiting for  Steve’s reaction,” Hertzfeld recalled.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>克里斯·埃斯皮诺萨找到了一个方法，既可以满足乔布斯对设计的要求，又可以满足他疯狂的控制欲。苹果公司还在车库里办公的时候，埃斯皮诺萨就是沃兹尼亚克的助手之一，在乔布斯的劝说下，他从伯克利退了学，乔布斯的理由是，学习的机会有很多，但研发Mac的机会只有一次。他自己决定在电脑上设计一款计算器程序。“大家都聚到一起，看克里斯向史蒂夫展示程序，他屏住了呼吸，等待史蒂夫的反应。”赫茨菲尔德回忆说。

<p>“Well, it’s a start,”  Jobs said, “but basically, it stinks. The background color is too dark, some  lines are the wrong thickness, and the buttons are too big.” Espinosa kept  refining it in response to Jobs’s critiques, day after day, but with each  iteration came new criticisms. So finally one afternoon, when Jobs came by,  Espinosa unveiled his inspired solution: “The Steve Jobs Roll Your Own Calculator  Construction Set.” It allowed the user to tweak and personalize the look of the  calculator by changing the thickness of the lines, the size of the buttons, the  shading, the background, and other attributes. Instead of just laughing, Jobs  plunged in and started to play around with the look to suit his tastes. After  about ten minutes he got it the way he liked. His design, not surprisingly, was  the one that shipped on the Mac and remained the standard for fifteen years.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“这只是个开始，”乔布斯说，“但基本上来说，很烂。背景颜色太深，一些线条的粗细不对，按键也太大了。”根据乔布斯提出的批评，埃斯皮诺萨日复一日地不断对程序进行完善，但每次展示最新的版本都会受到新的批评。最终，在一个下午，乔布斯再次出现的时候，埃斯皮诺萨展示了他灵机一动做出的解决方案——“史蒂夫·乔布斯自己动手做的计算器程序”。这个程序允许用户改变线条的粗细、按键的大小、阴影、背景及其他属性，从而实现计算器外观的调整和个性化。乔布斯没有只顾着笑，他开始认真地根据自己的喜好调整计算器的外观。大约10分钟后，他终于得到了让自己满意的答案。毫无疑问，他的设计出现在了最终问世的Mac上，并在之后15年的时间里一直作为标准使用。

<p>Although his focus was  on the Macintosh, Jobs wanted to create a consistent design language for all  Apple products. So he set up a contest to choose a world-class designer who  would be for Apple what Dieter Rams was for Braun. The project was code-named  Snow White, not because of his preference for the color but because the  products to be designed were code-named after the seven dwarfs. The winner was  Hartmut Esslinger, a German designer who was responsible for the look of Sony’s  Trinitron televisions. Jobs flew to the Black Forest region of Bavaria to meet  him and was impressed not only with Esslinger’s passion but also his spirited  way of driving his Mercedes at more than one hundred miles per hour.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>尽管乔布斯关注的重点在麦金塔电脑上，但他还在寻求为所有的苹果产品创造统一的设计风格。于是，在杰里·马诺克和非正式团体“苹果设计协会”的帮助下，乔布斯组织了一次选拔赛，为苹果挑选世界级的设计师，如同博朗公司的迪特尔·拉姆斯一样。这个计划命名为“白雪公主”，起这个名字并不是因为对白色的偏爱，而是因为比赛中需要选手设计的产品是以七个小矮人的名字命名的。最终的赢家是德国设计师哈特穆特·艾斯林格（HartmutEsslinger），他曾负责设计了索尼特丽珑电视的外观。乔布斯飞到巴登-符腾堡州的黑森林地区与他会面，给乔布斯留下深刻印象的不仅是艾斯林格的激情，还有他开着奔驰以超过100英里的时速狂奔的勇猛精神。

<p>Even though he was  German, Esslinger proposed that there should be a “born-in-America gene for  Apple’s DNA” that would produce a “California global” look, inspired by  “Hollywood and music, a bit of rebellion, and natural sex appeal.” His guiding  principle was “Form follows emotion,” a play on the familiar maxim that form  follows function. He produced forty models of products to demonstrate the  concept, and when Jobs saw them he proclaimed, “Yes, this is it!” The Snow  White look, which was adopted immediately for the Apple IIc, featured white  cases, tight rounded curves, and lines of thin grooves for both ventilation and  decoration. Jobs offered Esslinger a contract on the condition that he move to  California. They shook hands and, in Esslinger’s not-so-modest words, “that  handshake launched one of the most decisive collaborations in the history of industrial  design.” Esslinger’s firm, frogdesign,<a href="../Local%20Settings/Temp/Rar$EX24.5890/CR!BJHPA831ES3B3F7WSRKZ17DMGSM7_split_131.html#filepos1869760">2</a> opened in Palo Alto in mid-1983 with a $1.2 million annual contract to work for  Apple, and from then on every Apple product has included the proud declaration  “Designed in California.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>艾斯林格虽然是德国人，但他提出“苹果产品的DNA中应该有土生土长的美国基因”有独特的加利福尼亚风情，就像“好莱坞和音乐一样，有一点叛逆，还有自然散发的性感魅力”。他的指导思想是“形式追随情感”，这套用了那旬众人皆知的“形式追随功能”。他制作了40个模型来阐述这一概念，当乔布斯看到这些模型的时候，他宣布：“对，就是这样！”“白雪公主”的外观立即被运用到了AppleII上：白色的机箱，紧致的圆润曲线，既能散热又起到装饰作用的细密通风槽。乔布斯给艾斯林格提供了一份合同，条件是他必须搬到加州居住。两人握手达成了协议，用艾斯林格不那么谦虚的话说：“那次握手开启了工业设计史上最为决定性的一次合作。”艾斯林格的公司——青蛙设计①——1983年年中在帕洛奥图成立，并从苹果公司得到了一份每年120万美元的大合同，从那时起，所有的苹果产品上都可以见到这句自豪的宣言：加利福尼亚设计。

<p>From his father Jobs  had learned that a hallmark of passionate craftsmanship is making sure that even  the aspects that will remain hidden are done beautifully. One of the most  extreme—and telling—implementations of that philosophy came when he scrutinized  the printed circuit board that would hold the chips and other components deep  inside the Macintosh. No consumer would ever see it, but Jobs began critiquing  it on aesthetic grounds. “That part’s really pretty,” he said. “But look at the  memory chips. That’s ugly. The lines are too close together.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯从父亲身上学到，充满激情的工艺就是要确保即使是隐藏的部分也被做得很漂亮。这种理念最极端也是最有说服力的例子之一，就是乔布斯会仔细检查印刷电路板。电路板上是芯片和其他部件，深藏于麦金塔的内部，没有哪个用户会看到它，但乔布斯还是会从美学角度对它进行评判。“那个部分做得很漂亮，”他说，“但是，看看这些存储芯片。真难看。这些线靠得太近了。”
</p>

<p>One of the new  engineers interrupted and asked why it mattered. “The only thing that’s  important is how well it works. Nobody is going to see the PC board.”</p>

<p>一名新手工程师打断他说这有什么关系，“只要机器能运行起来就行，没人会去看电路板的”。

<div class="layout">

<p>Jobs reacted  typically. “I want it to be as beautiful as possible, even if it’s inside the  box. A great carpenter isn’t going to use lousy wood for the back of a cabinet,  even though nobody’s going to see it.” In an interview a few years later, after  the Macintosh came out, Jobs again reiterated that lesson from his father:  “When you’re a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you’re not going  to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall and nobody  will ever see it. You’ll know it’s there, so you’re going to use a beautiful  piece of wood on the back. For you to sleep well at night, the aesthetic, the  quality, has to be carried all the way through.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯的反应和往常一样：“我想要它尽可能好看一点，就算它是在机箱里面的。优秀的木匠不会用劣质木板去做柜子的背板，即使没人会看到。”几年之后，在麦金塔电脑上市后的一次访谈中，乔布斯再一次提到了当年父亲对他的教导：“如果你是个木匠，你要做一个漂亮的衣柜，你不会用胶合板做背板，虽然这一块是靠着墙的，没人会看见。你自己知道它就在那儿，所以你会用一块漂亮的木头去做背板。如果你想晚上睡得安稳的话，就要保证外观和质量都足够好。”

<div class="layout">

<p>From Mike Markkula he  had learned the importance of packaging and presentation. People do judge a  book by its cover, so for the box of the Macintosh, Jobs chose a full-color  design and kept trying to make it look better. “He got the guys to redo it  fifty times,” recalled Alain Rossmann, a member of the Mac team who married  Joanna Hoffman. “It was going to be thrown in the trash as soon as the consumer  opened it, but he was obsessed by how it looked.” To Rossmann, this showed a  lack of balance; money was being spent on expensive packaging while they were  trying to save money on the memory chips. But for Jobs, each detail was  essential to making the Macintosh amazing.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>在迈克·马库拉的影响下，乔布斯把父亲的“关心隐藏部分的美观”的理念进一步延伸：漂亮的产品包装和展示也同样重要。人们确实是会“以貌取物”的。所以，乔布斯为麦金塔电脑的包装选择了全彩设计，并不断对其进行改善。“他让大家重做了50次，”阿兰·罗斯曼（AlainRossmatm）回忆说，他是Mac团队的成员之一，后来娶了乔安娜·霍夫曼，“用户一打幵包装，这些东西就会被扔进垃圾箱，但他还是执著于包装的式样。”对于罗斯曼来说，这显得有点失衡：一方面大把的钱被花在了昂贵的包装上，另一方面他们又试图在存储芯片上压缩成本。但对于乔布斯来说，要让麦金塔在性能和外观上都给人惊艳的感觉，每一个细节都是至关重要的。

<p>When the design was  finally locked in, Jobs called the Macintosh team together for a ceremony.  “Real artists sign their work,” he said. So he got out a sheet of drafting  paper and a Sharpie pen and had all of them sign their names. The signatures  were engraved inside each Macintosh. No one would ever see them, but the members  of the team knew that their signatures were inside, just as they knew that the  circuit board was laid out as elegantly as possible. Jobs called them each up  by name, one at a time. Burrell Smith went first. Jobs waited until last, after  all forty-five of the others. He found a place right in the center of the sheet  and signed his name in lowercase letters with a grand flair. Then he toasted  them with champagne. “With moments like this, he got us seeing our work as  art,” said Atkinson.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>最终的设计方案敲定后，乔布斯把麦金塔团队的成员都召集到一起，举行了一个仪式。他说：“真正的艺术家会在作品上签上名字。”于是他拿出一张绘图纸和一只三福笔（Sharpiepen）,让所有人都签上了自己的名字。这些签名被刻在了每一台麦金塔电脑的内部。除了维修电脑的人，没有人会看到这些名字。但团队里的每个成员都知道那里面有自己的名字，就如同每个人都知道那里面的电路板已经被设计得尽善尽美了。乔布斯一个一个叫出大家的名字，让他们签名。伯勒尔·史密斯是第一个。乔布斯等到了最后，其他45个人都签过名后，他在图纸的正中间找到了一个位置，用小写字母潇洒地签下了自己的名字。然后他以香槟向大家祝酒。“在这样的时刻，他让我们觉得自己的成果就是艺术品。”阿特金森说——</p>
<p>注释：</p>
<p>①作者注：2000年，“青蛙设计”（frogdesign）更名为“青蛙设计”（frogdesign）并迁至旧金山。当初艾斯林格为公司挑选这样一个名字，不仅是因为青蛙具有变态（形态变化）的能力，也是为了向自己的祖国德意志联邦共和国〖（f）ederalRepublic（o）f（g）ermany〗致敬。他说：“小写字母体现的是包豪斯运动的无层级语言观念，强化了公司民主合作的精神。”</p>
