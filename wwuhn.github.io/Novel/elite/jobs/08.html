<div class="left"><h3>A New Baby</h3><p>The Apple II took the  company from Jobs’s garage to the pinnacle of a new industry. Its sales rose  dramatically, from 2,500 units in 1977 to 210,000   in 1981. But Jobs was restless. The Apple II could not remain  successful forever, and he knew that, no matter how much he had done to package  it, from power cord to case, it would always be seen as Wozniak’s masterpiece.  He needed his own machine. More than that, he wanted a product that would, in  his words, make a dent in the universe. </p></div>
<div class="right">



<h3>一个新孩子</h3>

<p>AppleII的问世把苹果公司从乔布斯家的车库推向了一个新兴产业的顶峰。它的销量急剧上升，从1977年的2500台猛增到1981年的21万台。但是乔布斯并没有满足。AppleII不可能长盛不衰5而且他知道，无论自己如何从电源线到机箱对其进行包装，人们永远都只会将它视为沃兹尼亚克的杰作。他需要一台属于他的电脑。不仅如此，用他自己的话说，他需要一个在宇宙中留下印迹的产品。</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>At first he hoped that  the Apple III would play that role. It would have more memory, the screen would  display eighty characters across rather than forty, and it would handle  uppercase and lowercase letters. Indulging his passion for industrial design, Jobs  decreed the size and shape of the external case, and he refused to let anyone  alter it, even as committees of engineers added more components to the circuit  boards. The result was piggybacked boards with poor connectors that frequently  failed. When the Apple III began shipping in May 1980, it flopped. Randy  Wigginton, one of the engineers, summed it up: “The Apple III was kind of like  a baby conceived during a group orgy, and later everybody had this bad  headache, and there’s this bastard child, and everyone says, ‘It’s not mine.’” </p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>最初，他希望AppleIII能承担这个角色。AppleIII内存更大，屏幕可以一行显示80个字符而不是40个，并且能区分大小写字母。沉浸在对工业设计的狂热中的乔布斯，严格限定了机箱的尺寸和形状，并拒绝任何人对其进行修改，即便是在工程师往电路板上增加了更多的部件之后。其绪果是附加的小电路板因连接不稳定而频繁失灵。1980年5月，AppleIII上市，但销量惨淡。工程师兰迪·威金顿总结道：“AppleIII有点儿像集体狂欢时怀上的孩子，事后大家都头痛得厉害，至于这个野孩子，人人都说不是自己的。”</p>

　　
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>By then Jobs had  distanced himself from the Apple III and was thrashing about for ways to  produce something more radically different. At first he flirted with the idea  of touchscreens, but he found himself frustrated. At one demonstration of the  technology, he arrived late, fidgeted awhile, then abruptly cut off the  engineers in the middle of their presentation with a brusque “Thank you.” They  were confused. “Would you like us to leave?” one asked. Jobs said yes, then  berated his colleagues for wasting his time. </p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>那个时候，乔布斯已经疏远了AppleIII项目，正焦急地想办法创造出更加与众不同的东西。起初他想过用触摸屏，但后来又泄气了。一次触摸屏技术的演示会上，他迟到了，坐立不安地待了一会儿，然后突然打断了正在演示的工程师，很无礼地说了句“谢谢你们”。工程师们被他弄糊涂了。“你想要我们离开吗？”其中一个问道。乔布斯说是的，然后就痛斥同事们浪费了他的时间。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Then he and Apple  hired two engineers from Hewlett-Packard to conceive a totally new computer.  The name Jobs chose for it would have caused even the most jaded psychiatrist  to do a double take: the Lisa. Other computers had been named after daughters  of their designers, but Lisa was a daughter Jobs had abandoned and had not yet  fully admitted was his. “Maybe he was doing it out of guilt,” said Andrea  Cunningham, who worked at Regis McKenna on public relations for the project.  “We had to come up with an acronym so that we could claim it was not named  after Lisa the child.” The one they reverse-engineered was “local integrated  systems architecture,” and despite being meaningless it became the official  explanation for the name. Among the engineers it was referred to as “Lisa:  invented stupid acronym.” Years later, when I asked about the name, Jobs  admitted simply, “Obviously it was named for my daughter.” </p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>之后，他和苹果公司从惠普雇来了两名工程师，设计一台全新的电脑。乔布斯为新电脑挑选的名字能让最迟钝的精神病医生也闻之一怔，随后恍然大悟：丽萨。其他电脑也有以设计者女儿的名字命名的，但是丽萨是被乔布斯拋弃的女儿，他甚至还没有完全承认那孩子是自己的。“他这么做也许是出于内疚吧。”安德烈·坎宁安（AndreaCunningham）说，她当时供职于里吉斯·麦肯纳公司，负责丽萨项目的公关事务。“我们要把丽萨（Lisa）视为一个缩略词，想出和它对应的一句短语。这样就可以宣称这不是以乔布斯女儿的名字来命名的。”他们把这个缩写逆推，得到了“本地集成系统架构”（LocalIntegratedSystemsArchitecture）,尽管这个短语毫无意义，它还是成为了丽萨（Lisa）这个名字的官方解释。工程师们私下把这个名字解释为“Lisa：编造的愚蠢缩写（Lisa：InventedStupidAcronym）”。多年以后，当我向乔布斯问起这个名字的时候，他坦率地承认：“这很显然是以我女儿的名字命名的。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>The Lisa was conceived  as a $2,000 machine based on a sixteen-bit microprocessor, rather than the  eight-bit one used in the Apple II. Without the wizardry of Wozniak, who was  still working quietly on the Apple II, the engineers began producing a  straightforward computer with a conventional text display, unable to push the  powerful microprocessor to do much exciting stuff. Jobs began to grow impatient  with how boring it was turning out to be. </p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>丽萨被定位成一台售价2000美元的电脑，采用16位微处理器，取代了AppleII上使用的8位微处理器。缺少了当时仍在AppleII项目中埋头苦千的沃兹尼亚克的才华，工程师们开始制造一台中规中矩的电脑，它使用传统的文本显示，也无法释放微处理器的强大性能去完成激动人心的任务。这款产品日渐显现出它的平庸，乔布斯开始失去耐心了。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>There was, however,  one programmer who was infusing the project with some life: Bill Atkinson. He  was a doctoral student in neuroscience who had experimented with his fair share  of acid. When he was asked to come work for Apple, he declined. But then Apple  sent him a nonrefundable plane ticket, and he decided to use it and let Jobs  try to persuade him. “We are inventing the future,” Jobs told him at the end of  a three-hour pitch. “Think about surfing on the front edge of a wave. It’s  really exhilarating. Now think about dog-paddling at the tail end of that wave.  It wouldn’t be anywhere near as much fun. Come down here and make a dent in the  universe.” Atkinson did. </p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>然而，有一名叫比尔·阿特金森（BillAtkinson）的程序员给这个项目注入了一些活力。他是神经系统科学专业的博士生，也尝试过不少迷幻剂。最初受邀加入苹果的时候，他拒绝了。但是后来苹果公司给他寄去一张不可退票的机票，于是他决定用上这张机票，让乔布斯设法说服他。“我们正在创造未来，”乔布斯在长达3个小时的劝说接近尾声时表示，“想象一下在海浪的最前端冲浪是什么感觉，一定很兴奋刺激吧；再想象一下在浪的末尾学狗刨游泳，一点儿意思都没有。来苹果吧，你可以吸引全世界的目光。”阿特金森入伙了。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>With his shaggy hair  and droopy moustache that did not hide the animation in his face, Atkinson had  some of Woz’s ingenuity along with Jobs’s passion for awesome products. His  first job was to develop a program to track a stock portfolio by auto-dialing  the Dow Jones service, getting quotes, then hanging up. “I had to create it  fast because there was a magazine ad for the Apple II showing a hubby at the  kitchen table looking at an Apple screen filled with graphs of stock prices,  and his wife is beaming at him—but there wasn’t such a program, so I had to  create one.” Next he created for the Apple II a version of Pascal, a high-level  programming language. Jobs had resisted, thinking that BASIC was all the Apple  II needed, but he told Atkinson, “Since you’re so passionate about it, I’ll  give you six days to prove me wrong.” He did, and Jobs respected him ever  after. </p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>蓬松的头发和长长的胡子并不能掩盖阿特金森脸上的活力，他有着沃兹的创造天赋和乔布斯追求卓越产品的热情。他的第一份工作是开发一个程序，该程序可以自动拨打道琼斯的服务热线，获取报价，然后挂断电话，以此来追踪股票投资组合。“我必须尽快完成，因为一本杂志刊登的AppleII广告上出现了这样的场景：丈夫在厨房的餐桌旁盯着满是股价图表的AppleII屏幕，而妻子正对着他微笑——实际上根本就没有这样的程序，所以我必须创造一个。”接下来他又成功地将Pascal语言移植到AppleII上，这是一种髙级编程语言。乔布斯起初很抵制Pascal，因为他觉得AppleII有BASIC就足够了，但他告诉阿特金森：“既然你对这个有这么大的热情，我就给你6天时间来证明我是错的。”阿特金森做到了，从此乔布斯对他很是尊敬。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>By the fall of 1979  Apple was breeding three ponies to be potential successors to the Apple II  workhorse. There was the ill-fated Apple III. There was the Lisa project, which  was beginning to disappoint Jobs. And somewhere off Jobs’s radar screen, at  least for the moment, there was a small skunkworks project for a low-cost  machine that was being developed by a colorful employee named Jef Raskin, a  former professor who had taught Bill Atkinson. Raskin’s goal was to make an  inexpensive “computer for the masses” that would be like an appliance—a  self-contained unit with computer, keyboard, monitor, and software all  together—and have a graphical interface. He tried to turn his colleagues at  Apple on to a cutting-edge research center, right in Palo Alto, that was  pioneering such ideas.</div>
<div class="right">
<p>到1979年的秋天，AppleII的潜在继任者已经有了三种机型。有命运凄惨的AppleIII，还有已经开始让乔布斯失望的丽萨项目。另外一个是乔布斯当时还不知道的一个小项目。这个项目致力于制造一款廉价的电脑，研发代号为“安妮”（Annie），开发者名叫杰夫·拉斯金（JefRaskin）,他曾是个教授，还教过比尔·阿特金森。拉斯金的目栋是制造价格低廉、就像家用电器一样的“大众电脑”——整合了电脑、键盘、显示器和软件的全功能设备——并且拥有图形界面。他试图让苹果的同事们关注一家优秀的研究中心，这家研究中心就坐落在帕洛奥图，是图形界面技术的先驱。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><h3><a name="s2" id="s2"></a>Xerox PARC</h3><p>The Xerox  Corporation’s Palo Alto Research Center, known as Xerox PARC, had been  established in 1970 to create a spawning ground for digital ideas. It was  safely located, for better and for worse, three thousand miles from the  commercial pressures of Xerox corporate headquarters in Connecticut. Among its  visionaries was the scientist Alan Kay, who had two great maxims that Jobs  embraced: “The best way to predict the future is to invent it” and “People who  are serious about software should make their own hardware.” Kay pushed the  vision of a small personal computer, dubbed the “Dynabook,” that would be easy  enough for children to use. So Xerox PARC’s engineers began to develop  user-friendly graphics that could replace all of the command lines and DOS  prompts that made computer screens intimidating. The metaphor they came up with  was that of a desktop. The screen could have many documents and folders on it,  and you could use a mouse to point and click on the one you wanted to use. </p></div>
<div class="right">

<h3>施乐PARC</h3>

<p>施乐公司的帕洛奥图研究中心（PaloAltoResearchCenter）——常被叫做“施乐PARC”——成立于1970年，目的是为数字领域的创想提供成长环境。这里距离康涅狄格州的施乐公司总部3000英里，无论是好是坏，都脱离了那里的商业压力。工作在这里的诸多梦想家中，有一位叫做艾伦·凯（AlanKay）的科学家，他的两句格言深得乔布斯认同：“预见未来最好的方式就是亲手创造未来”以及“对待软件严肃认真的人，应该制造自己专属的硬件”。凯推出了小型个人电脑的理念，他称之为“动态笔记本”（Dynabook），使用简便，即便是小孩子也能轻松操作。于是，施乐MRC的工程师们开始研发友好的用户图形界面，以取代电脑屏幕上那些拒人于千里之外的命令行和DOS提示符。他们想到，可以把桌面的概念应用到屏幕上。屏幕上会有很多文件和文件夹，用户可以使用鼠标指向并点击自己想要使用的内容。</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>This graphical user  interface—or GUI, pronounced “gooey”—was facilitated by another concept  pioneered at Xerox PARC: bitmapping. Until then, most computers were  character-based. You would type a character on a keyboard, and the computer  would generate that character on the screen, usually in glowing greenish  phosphor against a dark background. Since there were a limited number of  letters, numerals, and symbols, it didn’t take a whole lot of computer code or  processing power to accomplish this. In a bitmap system, on the other hand,  each and every pixel on the screen is controlled by bits in the computer’s  memory. To render something on the screen, such as a letter, the computer has  to tell each pixel to be light or dark or, in the case of color displays, what  color to be. This uses a lot of computing power, but it permits gorgeous  graphics, fonts, and gee-whiz screen displays. </p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>图形用户界面——也就是GUI——的发展，也受到了当时施乐PARC另一个先锋概念“位图显示”的推动。那个时候，大多数电脑还是基于字符的。你在键盘上输入一个字符，计算机就会在屏幕上显示那个字符，通常是荧光绿色的字符衬上深色的背景。因为字母、数字、符号的数量是有限的，所以这样的显示方式并不需要大量的电脑代码或是很强的处理器性能。位图显示则相反，屏幕上的每一个像素都是由电脑内存控制的。要在屏幕上显示某些内容——比如一个字母——电脑就要控制每个像素的明暗，如果是彩色显示的话，则要控制每个像素的颜色。这会占用大量的系统资源，但是能够支持炫丽的图像、字体和惊人的显本效果。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Bitmapping and  graphical interfaces became features of Xerox PARC’s prototype computers, such  as the Alto, and its object-oriented programming language, Smalltalk. Jef  Raskin decided that these features were the future of computing. So he began  urging Jobs and other Apple colleagues to go check out Xerox PARC. </p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>位图显示和图形界面成为了施乐PARC开发的电脑样机（比如“奥图”电脑）和面向对象的编程语言Smalltalk的特性。杰夫·拉斯金认为，这些特性是电脑产业的未来。于是他开始催促乔布斯和苹果的其他同事去施乐PARC考察一番。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Raskin had one problem:  Jobs regarded him as an insufferable theorist or, to use Jobs’s own more  precise terminology, “a shithead who sucks.” So Raskin enlisted his friend  Atkinson, who fell on the other side of Jobs’s shithead/genius division of the  world, to convince Jobs to take an interest in what was happening at Xerox  PARC. What Raskin didn’t know was that Jobs was working on a more complex deal.  Xerox’s venture capital division wanted to be part of the second round of Apple  financing during the summer of 1979. Jobs made an offer: “I will let you invest  a million dollars in Apple if you will open the kimono at PARC.” Xerox  accepted. It agreed to show Apple its new technology and in return got to buy  100,000 shares at about $10 each. </p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>拉斯金有一个麻烦。乔布斯认为他是个让人难以忍受的理论家，用乔布斯的原话来说，就是个“糟糕透顶的白痴”。因此，拉斯金只好找来自己的朋友阿特金森，让他去说腋乔布斯关注一下施乐PARC的研究进展，因为在乔布斯“不是天才就是白痴”的世界中，阿特金森是属于天才这一边的。拉斯金不知道的是，乔布斯正在进行一项更为复杂的交易。施乐的风险投资部门想要参与苹果公司在1979年夏天进行的第二轮融资。乔布斯开出了条件：“如果你们愿意掲开施乐PARC的神秘面纱，我就同意你们投资100万美元。”施乐公司接受了，同意向苹果展示其新技术；作为回报，他们可以每股10美元的价格购买10万股苹果公司的股票。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>By the time Apple went  public a year later, Xerox’s $1 million worth of shares were worth $17.6  million. But Apple got the better end of the bargain. Jobs and his colleagues  went to see Xerox PARC’s technology in December 1979 and, when Jobs realized he  hadn’t been shown enough, got an even fuller demonstration a few days later.  Larry Tesler was one of the Xerox scientists called upon to do the briefings,  and he was thrilled to show off the work that his bosses back east had never  seemed to appreciate. But the other briefer, Adele Goldberg, was appalled that  her company seemed willing to give away its crown jewels. “It was incredibly  stupid, completely nuts, and I fought to prevent giving Jobs much of anything,”  she recalled. </p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>一年之后，苹果公司上市了，施乐花100万美元购买的股票已经价值1760万。但在这场交易中，苹果公司获益更多。乔布斯和同事们在1979年12月参观了施乐PARC的技术成果，但乔布斯觉得他看到的并不是全部，于是几天之后又得到了一次更加全面的展示。拉里·特斯勒（LarryTesler）是奉命进行展示的施乐科学家之一，他对有机会展示自己的工作成果非常兴奋，因为这些从来都得不到远在东部的老板们的赏识。但另一名展示者，阿黛尔·戈德堡（AdekGoldberg）,对于公司愿意把自己最宝贵的科研成果拱手示人感到震惊。“那么做是无比愚蠢、彻底疯狂的，我想尽办法，阻止乔布斯获取太多信息。”她说道。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Goldberg got her way  at the first briefing. Jobs, Raskin, and the Lisa team leader John Couch were  ushered into the main lobby, where a Xerox Alto had been set up. “It was a very  controlled show of a few applications, primarily a word-processing one,”  Goldberg said. Jobs wasn’t satisfied, and he called Xerox headquarters demanding  more. </p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>第一次展示会上，戈德堡得逞了。乔布斯、拉斯金以及丽萨团队的负责人约翰·库奇（JohnCouch）被带到大厅，在那里，一台施乐的奥图电脑已经准备就绪。“只给他们展示了很有限的几个应用，最主要的是一个文字处理程序。”戈德堡回忆说。乔布斯并不满意，他致电施乐总部，要求得到更多信息。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>So he was invited back  a few days later, and this time he brought a larger team that included Bill  Atkinson and Bruce Horn, an Apple programmer who had worked at Xerox PARC. They  both knew what to look for. “When I arrived at work, there was a lot of  commotion, and I was told that Jobs and a bunch of his programmers were in the  conference room,” said Goldberg. One of her engineers was trying to keep them  entertained with more displays of the word-processing program. But Jobs was  growing impatient. “Let’s stop this bullshit!” he kept shouting. So the Xerox  folks huddled privately and decided to open the kimono a bit more, but only  slowly. They agreed that Tesler could show off Smalltalk, the programming  language, but he would demonstrate only what was known as the “unclassified”  version. “It will dazzle [Jobs] and he’ll never know he didn’t get the  confidential disclosure,” the head of the team told Goldberg. </p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>于是，几天之后，他又被邀请去了施乐MRC，这次他带来了一个更为庞大的团队，包括了比尔·阿特金森和曾经在施乐PARC工作过的苹果程序员布鲁斯·霍恩（BruceHorn）。这两个人都知道该寻找什么。戈德堡说：“我上班后，发现公司里很喧闹，有人告诉我，乔布斯和他的一群程序员正在会议室里。”施乐的一名工程师在展示那个文字处理程序的更多细节，想以此应付他们。但乔布斯越来越不耐烦了，他不停地喊：“别说这狗屁玩意儿了！”施乐的几个人聚在一起商量了一下，决定向乔布斯展示部分核心技术，但只是一点点。他们同意特斯勒展示一下编程语言Smalltalk，但只能展示“非机密”版本的。“这就足够让他眼花缭乱了，他不会知道我们还有机密部分的。”团队负责人这么告诉戈德堡。</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>They were wrong.  Atkinson and others had read some of the papers published by Xerox PARC, so  they knew they were not getting a full description. Jobs phoned the head of the  Xerox venture capital division to complain; a call immediately came back from  corporate headquarters in Connecticut decreeing that Jobs and his group should  be shown everything. Goldberg stormed out in a rage. </p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>但他们错了。阿特金森和其他人都读过施乐PARC发表的论文，所以他们知道自己并没有得到全部信息。乔布斯给施乐风投部门的负责人打电话抱怨，远在康涅狄格的公司总部立刻打来了电话，命令向乔布斯和他的团队展示全部成果。戈德堡愤然离场。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>When Tesler finally  showed them what was truly under the hood, the Apple folks were astonished.  Atkinson stared at the screen, examining each pixel so closely that Tesler  could feel the breath on his neck. Jobs bounced around and waved his arms  excitedly. “He was hopping around so much I don’t know how he actually saw most  of the demo, but he did, because he kept asking questions,” Tesler recalled.  “He was the exclamation point for every step I showed.” Jobs kept saying that  he couldn’t believe that Xerox had not commercialized the technology. “You’re  sitting on a gold mine,” he shouted. “I can’t believe Xerox is not taking  advantage of this.” </p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>当特斯勒真正开始展示全部的成果时，苹果的一群人都惊呆了。阿特金森盯着屏幕检査每一个像素，他靠得如此之近，以至于特斯勒都能感觉到他呼出来的气吹到自己脖子上。乔布斯跳了起来，兴奋地挥舞着胳膊。“他跳来跳去的，我都不知道他有没有看清楚整个演示，但事实证明他是看到了的，因为他不停问问题，”特斯勒说，“我每展示一部分，他都会发出惊叹。”乔布斯反复说自己不敢相信施乐还没有把这项技术商业化。“你们就坐在一座金矿上啊，”他叫道，“我真不敢相信施乐竟然没有好好利用这项技术。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>The Smalltalk  demonstration showed three amazing features. One was how computers could be  networked; the second was how object-oriented programming worked. But Jobs and  his team paid little attention to these attributes because they were so amazed  by the third feature, the graphical interface that was made possible by a  bitmapped screen. “It was like a veil being lifted from my eyes,” Jobs  recalled. “I could see what the future of computing was destined to be.” </p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>Smalltalk的演示展现了三项惊人的成果。包括电脑之间如何实现联网，以及面向对象编程是如何工作的。但乔布斯和他的团队对这些并不感兴趣，因为他们的注意力被图形界面和位图显示屏幕完全吸引了。“仿佛蒙在我眼睛上的纱布被掲开了一样，”乔布斯后来回忆，“我看到了计算机产业的未来。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>When the Xerox PARC  meeting ended after more than two hours, Jobs drove Bill Atkinson back to the  Apple office in Cupertino. He was speeding, and so were his mind and mouth.  “This is it!” he shouted, emphasizing each word. “We’ve got to do it!” It was  the breakthrough he had been looking for: bringing computers to the people,  with the cheerful but affordable design of an Eichler home and the ease of use  of a sleek kitchen appliance. </p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>历时两个多小时的施乐PARC会面结束之后，乔布斯开车带着比尔·阿特金森返回位于库比蒂诺的苹果公司。他车开得很快，心跳得很快，嘴上说得也很快。“就是它了！”他喊道，每一个字都铿锵有力，“我们要把它变成现实！”这是他一直以来寻找的突破：将电脑推广到普通人家中，让他们享受到埃奇勒建造的房屋一般美好又廉价的设计，以及厨房电器一般的简易操作。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>“How long would this  take to implement?” he asked. </p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>“实现这个目标需要多久？”乔布斯问。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>“I’m not sure,”  Atkinson replied. “Maybe six months.” It was a wildly optimistic assessment,  but also a motivating one.</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“我不确定，”阿特金森回答，“也许6个月吧。”这个预测过于乐观了，但也激发了大家的动力。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<h3><a name="s3" id="s3"></a>“Great Artists Steal”</h3>
<p>The Apple raid on  Xerox PARC is sometimes described as one of the biggest heists in the  chronicles of industry. Jobs occasionally endorsed this view, with pride. As he  once said, “Picasso had a saying—‘good artists copy, great artists steal’—and  we have always been shameless about stealing great ideas.” </p></div>
<div class="right">

<h3>“伟大的艺术家窃取灵感”</h3>

<p>苹果公司对施乐PARC的这次技术盗窃，有时被形容为工业史上最严重的抢劫行为之一。乔布斯偶尔也会骄傲地承认这一说法。“归根结底，我们只是想尽量了解有史以来最棒的发明，然后将它运用到我们正在做的事情中。”他有一次说，“毕加索不是说过么：‘好的艺术家只是照抄，而伟大的艺术家窃取灵感’在窃取伟大的灵感这方面，我们一直都是厚颜无耻的。”</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Another assessment,  also sometimes endorsed by Jobs, is that what transpired was less a heist by  Apple than a fumble by Xerox. “They were copier-heads who had no clue about  what a computer could do,” he said of Xerox’s management. “They just grabbed  defeat from the greatest victory in the computer industry. Xerox could have  owned the entire computer industry.” </p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯认同的另一个说法是，与其说是苹果公司实施了抢劫，不如说是施乐公司自己酿下了苦果。“他们就是一帮白痴，根本没有意识到电脑的巨大潜力。”他如此形容施乐的管理层，“在这场计算机产业最伟大的胜利中，他们被打败了。施乐本可以称霸整个计算机产业的。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Both assessments  contain a lot of truth, but there is more to it than that. There falls a  shadow, as T. S. Eliot noted, between the conception and the creation. In the  annals of innovation, new ideas are only part of the equation. Execution is  just as important. </p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>以上两种说法都有道理，但并不能说明全部问题。概念与造物之间，如同T·S·艾略特（T.S.Eliot）所说的“落下影子”。在创新的过程中，新颖的想法只是一部分，具体执行也同样重要。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Jobs and his engineers  significantly improved the graphical interface ideas they saw at Xerox PARC,  and then were able to implement them in ways that Xerox never could accomplish.  For example, the Xerox mouse had three buttons, was complicated, cost $300  apiece, and didn’t roll around smoothly; a few days after his second Xerox PARC  visit, Jobs went to a local industrial design firm, IDEO, and told one of its  founders, Dean Hovey, that he wanted a simple single-button model that cost  $15, “and I want to be able to use it on Formica and my blue jeans.” Hovey  complied. </p></div>

<p>乔布斯和他的工程师们对在施乐PARC看到的图形界面技术进行了巨大的改进，然后又以施乐永远无法实现的方式对这些技术作了进一步完善。比如说，施乐的鼠标有三个按键，结构复杂，每只造价300美元，移动不够平滑。乔布斯在第二次造访施乐PARC之后没几天，就找到了一家当地的工业设计公司，告诉该公司的创始人之一迪安·霍维（DeanHovey），自己想要一种简单的、只有一个按键的、造价只要15美元的鼠标，“而且它要能在塑料面板和我的牛仔裤上正常使用。”霍维答应了。

<div class="left"><p>The improvements were  in not just the details but the entire concept. The mouse at Xerox PARC could  not be used to drag a window around the screen. Apple’s engineers devised an  interface so you could not only drag windows and files around, you could even  drop them into folders. The Xerox system required you to select a command in  order to do anything, ranging from resizing a window to changing the extension  that located a file. The Apple system transformed the desktop metaphor into  virtual reality by allowing you to directly touch, manipulate, drag, and  relocate things. And Apple’s engineers worked in tandem with its designers—with  Jobs spurring them on daily—to improve the desktop concept by adding delightful  icons and menus that pulled down from a bar atop each window and the capability  to open files and folders with a double click. </p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>得到提升的并不仅仅是细节，还有整个概念。施乐PARC的鼠标并不能用来在屏幕上拖拽窗口。而苹果工程师们设计出的界面上，用户不仅可以任意拖拽窗口和文件，还可以将它们拖到文件夹中。施乐的系统中，不管是调整窗口的大小还是更改文件的扩展名，用户都必须选择一条指令后才能执行操作。苹果的系统将桌面的概念转化为了虚拟现实，允许用户直接触摸、操作、拖拽和移动文件。苹果的工程师和设计师每天都受到乔布斯的鞭策。他们协同工作，完善了桌面概念：添加了漂亮的图标和位于窗口顶端的下拉菜单，以及双击鼠标打开文件和文件夹的功能。

<div class="left"><p>It’s not as if Xerox  executives ignored what their scientists had created at PARC. In fact they did  try to capitalize on it, and in the process they showed why good execution is  as important as good ideas. In 1981, well before the Apple Lisa or Macintosh,  they introduced the Xerox Star, a machine that featured their graphical user  interface, mouse, bitmapped display, windows, and desktop metaphor. But it was  clunky (it could take minutes to save a large file), costly ($16,595 at retail  stores), and aimed mainly at the networked office market. It flopped; only  thirty thousand were ever sold. </p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>施乐的管理层并没有忽略他们的科学家在帕克创造出来的东西。事实上，他们的确尝试过利用这些研究成果——而这一过程恰恰证明了为什么好的执行力和杰出的创意同样重要。在苹果的丽萨和麦金塔电脑问世之前，早在1981年，施乐就推出了他们的“施乐之星”（XeroxStar），这台电脑上运用了图形用户界面、鼠标、位图显示、窗口以及桌面概念。但它运行缓慢（保存稍大一点儿的文件需要耗费数分钟），价格昂贵（零售价高达16595美元），且主要瞄准的是计算机网络化的企业市场。它的销售情况十分不好，仅仅卖出去3万台。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Jobs and his team went  to a Xerox dealer to look at the Star as soon as it was released. But he deemed  it so worthless that he told his colleagues they couldn’t spend the money to  buy one. “We were very relieved,” he recalled. “We knew they hadn’t done it  right, and that we could—at a fraction of the price.” A few weeks later he  called Bob Belleville, one of the hardware designers on the Xerox Star team.  “Everything you’ve ever done in your life is shit,” Jobs said, “so why don’t  you come work for me?” Belleville did, and so did Larry Tesler. </p></div>
<div class="right">
施乐之星刚刚发布，乔布斯和他的团队就去一家施乐经销商那里查看情况。但他觉得这台机器毫无价值，他告诉同事们根本犯不着花钱买一台。“我们都松了一口气，”他回忆说，“我们看得出来，施乐没能把产品做好，但我们可以，而且价格要便宜得多。”几个星期之后，乔布斯给施乐之星团队的硬件设计师之一鲍勃·贝尔维尔（BobBelleville）去了电话。“你这一辈子做出来的东西都是垃圾，”乔布斯说，“干脆来为我工作吧。”贝尔维尔同意了，一起跳槽的还有拉里·特斯勒。

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>In his excitement,  Jobs began to take over the daily management of the Lisa project, which was  being run by John Couch, the former HP engineer. Ignoring Couch, he dealt  directly with Atkinson and Tesler to insert his own ideas, especially on Lisa’s  graphical interface design. “He would call me at all hours, 2 a.m. or 5 a.m.,” said Tesler. “I loved it. But it upset my  bosses at the Lisa division.” Jobs was told to stop making out-of-channel  calls. He held himself back for a while, but not for long. </p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯十分兴奋，开始插手丽萨项目的日常管理，该项目当时的负责人是曾经的惠普工程师约翰·库奇。乔布斯完全忽略了库奇的存在，直接与阿特金森和特斯勒通气，灌输自己的想法，尤其是关于丽萨的图形界面设计。“他会在任何时间给我打电话，凌晨两点或者早上5点，”特斯勒说，“我喜欢这样。但是丽萨项目的头儿们不高兴了。”乔布斯被要求停止越级管理。他安静了一段时间，但很快又按捺不住了。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>One important showdown  occurred when Atkinson decided that the screen should have a white background  rather than a dark one. This would allow an attribute that both Atkinson and  Jobs wanted: WYSIWYG, pronounced “wiz-ee-wig,” an acronym for “What you see is  what you get.” What you saw on the screen was what you’d get when you printed  it out. “The hardware team screamed bloody murder,” Atkinson recalled. “They  said it would force us to use a phosphor that was a lot less persistent and  would flicker more.” So Atkinson enlisted Jobs, who came down on his side. The  hardware folks grumbled, but then went off and figured it out. “Steve wasn’t  much of an engineer himself, but he was very good at assessing people’s  answers. He could tell whether the engineers were defensive or unsure of  themselves.” </p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>阿特金森认为应该把屏幕的深色背景换成白色的，这引发了一次重大冲突。屏幕背景色的改变可以实现阿特金森和乔布斯都想要的一个特性：WYSIWYG,这是“所见即所得”（WhatYouSeeIsWhatYouGet）的缩写。你在屏幕上看到的是什么样，打印出来就还是什么样。“硬件团队一片哀嚎，”阿特金森回忆说，“他们说，这样的话就必须使用一种持久性差且闪烁严重的磷光体。”阿特金森只好搬来乔布斯帮忙，乔布斯自然站在了他的一边。硬件团队抱怨连连，但之后还是实现了这个功能。“乔布斯本人算不上是个工程师，但他十分擅长评估别人的答案。他能看得出来工程师是心存戒备还是缺乏自信。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>One of Atkinson’s  amazing feats (which we are so accustomed to nowadays that we rarely marvel at  it) was to allow the windows on a screen to overlap so that the “top” one  clipped into the ones “below” it. Atkinson made it possible to move these  windows around, just like shuffling papers on a desk, with those below becoming  visible or hidden as you moved the top ones. Of course, on a computer screen  there are no layers of pixels underneath the pixels that you see, so there are  no windows actually lurking underneath the ones that appear to be on top. To  create the illusion of overlapping windows requires complex coding that  involves what are called “regions.” Atkinson pushed himself to make this trick  work because he thought he had seen this capability during his visit to Xerox  PARC. In fact the folks at PARC had never accomplished it, and they later told  him they were amazed that he had done so. “I got a feeling for the empowering  aspect of na?veté,” Atkinson said. “Because I didn’t know it couldn’t be done,  I was enabled to do it.” He was working so hard that one morning, in a daze, he  drove his Corvette into a parked truck and nearly killed himself. Jobs  immediately drove to the hospital to see him. “We were pretty worried about  you,” he said when Atkinson regained consciousness. Atkinson gave him a pained  smile and replied, “Don’t worry, I still remember regions.” </p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>阿特金森的伟大功绩之一（时至今日我们已经对它习以为常，感觉不到它的神奇）就是实现了屏幕上窗口间的重叠，这样一来“上面的”窗口就叠在了“下面的”窗口上。这一功能让人们可以像堆疊桌子上的文件纸张一样移动屏幕上的窗口，在你移动上面的窗口时，下面的窗口就会被隐藏起来或者被显示出来。当然，在电脑屏幕上，并没有层层像素隐藏在你看到的画面下，所以在你看到的“上面的”窗口之下，并没有隐藏的窗口。制造窗口重叠的假象，需要编写复杂的代码，其中运用到了“区域”（Region）这样一个概念。阿特金森强迫自己一定要做出这个效果，因为他觉得自己在施乐PARC见过这个功能。而实际上，施乐PARC的人从来没能实现这个功能，他们后来还阿特金森完成这一壮举表示了震惊。“我终于知道什么叫无知者无畏了，”阿特金森说，“正因为我不知道这个任务是如此困难，我才得以完成它。”阿特金森拚命工作，以至于一天早上，他在恍惚之中开着自己的克尔维特撞上了一辆停在路边的卡车，差点儿送命。乔布斯立刻驱车前往医院探望。阿特金森恢复意识后，乔布斯对他说：“我们很担心你。”阿特金森苦笑了一下，回答道：“不用担心，我还记得那些‘区域’。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Jobs also had a  passion for smooth scrolling. Documents should not lurch line by line as you  scroll through them, but instead should flow. “He was adamant that everything  on the interface had a good feeling to the user,” Atkinson said. They also  wanted a mouse that could easily move the cursor in any direction, not just  up-down/left-right. This required using a ball rather than the usual two  wheels. One of the engineers told Atkinson that there was no way to build such  a mouse commercially. After Atkinson complained to Jobs over dinner, he arrived  at the office the next day to discover that Jobs had fired the engineer. When  his replacement met Atkinson, his first words were, “I can build the mouse.” </p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯还狂热地追求页面滚动的平滑。当你滚动浏览一个文件时，文件内容不应该一行一行地滚动，而应该十分平滑地予以呈现。“他固执地认为，界面上的任何东西都要给使用者留下好印象。”阿特金森说。他们还想要一个可以操纵光标向任意方向移动的鼠标，而不仅仅是上下左右。这就需要使用一个滚球，而不是通常使用的两个轮子。一个工程师告诉阿特金森，这样的鼠标是不可能批量生产的。阿特金森在吃晚饭的时候向乔布斯抱怨了这件事，等他第二天上班时，发现那名工程师已经被乔布斯解雇了。接任的工程师见到阿特金森的第一句话就是：“我能做出那种鼠标。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Atkinson and Jobs  became best friends for a while, eating together at the Good Earth most nights.  But John Couch and the other professional engineers on his Lisa team, many of  them buttoned-down HP types, resented Jobs’s meddling and were infuriated by  his frequent insults. There was also a clash of visions. Jobs wanted to build a  VolksLisa, a simple and inexpensive product for the masses. “There was a  tug-of-war between people like me, who wanted a lean machine, and those from  HP, like Couch, who were aiming for the corporate market,” Jobs recalled. </p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>阿特金森和乔布斯在一段时间内成为了挚友，大多数晚上都在美好地球餐厅一起吃饭。但约翰·库奇和丽萨团队中的其他专业工程师们（大多都是惠普工程师那种类型的传统保守之人），痛恨乔布斯插手丽萨项目，也被他不断的侮辱所激怒。双方在观念上也有冲突。乔布斯想要制造大众电脑，操作简单、价格低廉，适合普通人使用。他回忆说：“像我这样的人，我们想要制造适合大多数人的电脑，而那帮和库奇一样在惠普干过的人，他们的目标是企业市场，我们之间进行了激烈的拉锯战。”

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Both Mike Scott and  Mike Markkula were intent on bringing some order to Apple and became  increasingly concerned about Jobs’s disruptive behavior. So in September 1980,  they secretly plotted a reorganization. Couch was made the undisputed manager  of the Lisa division. Jobs lost control of the computer he had named after his  daughter. He was also stripped of his role as vice president for research and  development. He was made non-executive chairman of the board. This position  allowed him to remain Apple’s public face, but it meant that he had no operating  control. That hurt. “I was upset and felt abandoned by Markkula,” he said. “He  and Scotty felt I wasn’t up to running the Lisa division. I brooded about it a  lot.”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="right"><p>斯科特和马库拉一心要给苹果公司带来秩序，也越来越担心乔布斯制造分裂的行为。于是，1980年9月，他们秘密策划了公司的重组。库奇成为了丽萨项目不容置疑的管理者。乔布斯失去了对以自己女儿命名的电脑的控制。他同时还被解除了研发部门副总裁的职务，被任命为董事会的非执行主席，也就是说，他依然代表苹果公司的公众形象，但手中再无实权。这深深刺痛了乔布斯的心。“我很难过，感觉被马库拉遗弃了，”他说，“他和斯科蒂觉得我无法胜任丽萨项目的管理工作。这件事让我郁闷地思考了很久。”</p>
