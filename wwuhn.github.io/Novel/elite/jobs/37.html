<div class="left"><h3><a name="s1" id="s1"></a>The Battles of 2008</h3>
<p>By the beginning of  2008 it was clear to Jobs and his doctors that his cancer was spreading. When  they had taken out his pancreatic tumors in 2004, he had the cancer genome  partially sequenced. That helped his doctors determine which pathways were  broken, and they were treating him with targeted therapies that they thought  were most likely to work.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><h3>2008战役</h3>

<p>到2008年初，乔布斯和他的医生们已经确定，他的癌细胞正在扩散。2004年医生切除他的胰脏肿瘤时，他请专家对癌症基因进行了部分排序。这有助于医生确定问题出现在哪些致癌位点上，并对他采取他们认为最有效的定位靶向治疗。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>He was also being  treated for pain, usually with morphine-based analgesics. One day in February  2008 when Powell’s close friend Kathryn Smith was staying with them in Palo  Alto, she and Jobs took a walk. “He told me that when he feels really bad, he  just concentrates on the pain, goes into the pain, and that seems to dissipate  it,” she recalled. That wasn’t exactly true, however. When Jobs was in pain, he  let everyone around him know it.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>他也在接受止痛治疗，一般都是用吗啡成分的镇痛药。2008年2月的一天，鲍威尔的好朋友凯瑟琳·史密斯在他们帕洛奥图的家里做客时，跟乔布斯一起出去散步。“他告诉我，当他实在难受时，他就专注于疼痛，钻进去，似乎就能把疼痛驱散了。”她回忆说。但是事实并非总是如此。乔布斯疼的时候，会充分表达出来，让身边每一个人都知道。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>There was another  health issue that became increasingly problematic, one that medical researchers  didn’t focus on as rigorously as they did cancer or pain. He was having eating  problems and losing weight. Partly this was because he had lost much of his  pancreas, which produces the enzymes needed to digest protein and other  nutrients. It was also because both the cancer and the morphine reduced his  appetite. And then there was the psychological component, which the doctors  barely knew how to address: Since his early teens, he had indulged his weird  obsession with extremely restrictive diets and fasts.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>还有另外一个健康问题越来越严重，之前并未像癌症或疼痛一样引起医疗研究人员的足够重视。他面临进食问题，体重不断下降。部分原因是他切除了大部分胰脏，而胰脏的功能是分泌消化蛋白质和其他营养素所需要的酶。另一个原因是镇痛用的吗啡让他缺乏食欲。此外还有心理原因，医生们都不知道该怎么应对，更别说治疗了——自从他十多岁起，乔布斯就沉迷于严格的节食和禁食。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Even after he married  and had children, he retained his dubious eating habits. He would spend weeks  eating the same thing—carrot salad with lemon, or just apples—and then suddenly  spurn that food and declare that he had stopped eating it. He would go on fasts,  just as he did as a teenager, and he became sanctimonious as he lectured others  at the table on the virtues of whatever eating regimen he was following. Powell  had been a vegan when they were first married, but after her husband’s  operation she began to diversify their family meals with fish and other  proteins. Their son, Reed, who had been a vegetarian, became a “hearty  omnivore.” They knew it was important for his father to get diverse sources of  protein.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>即使是结了婚有了孩子后，他依然保留了那些令人质疑的饮食习惯。他会连续几个星期吃同样的东西——胡萝卜沙拉加柠檬，或只是苹果——然后同样突然地摒弃那种食物，宣称他不再吃了。一如他十几岁时一样，他还是会禁食，而且会在饭桌上虔诚地宣讲他所遵循的饮食方法都有怎样的好处。鲍威尔在他们刚结婚时还是个严格的素食主义者，但是在丈夫做手术后，她开始让家里的饮食更多样化，增加了鱼和其他蛋白质。儿子里德也曾是素食主义者，现在成了个不折不扣的杂食动物。他们知道，让乔布斯从多种来源摄取蛋白质是非常重要的。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The family hired a  gentle and versatile cook, Bryar Brown, who once worked for Alice Waters at  Chez Panisse. He came each afternoon and made a panoply of healthy offerings  for dinner, which used the herbs and vegetables that Powell grew in their  garden. When Jobs expressed any whim—carrot salad, pasta with basil, lemongrass  soup—Brown would quietly and patiently find a way to make it. Jobs had always  been an extremely opinionated eater, with a tendency to instantly judge any  food as either fantastic or terrible. He could taste two avocados that most mortals  would find indistinguishable, and declare that one was the best avocado ever  grown and the other inedible.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯家聘请了一位温文尔雅又多才多艺的厨师，布里亚·布朗（BryarBrown）,他曾经在潘尼斯餐厅为爱丽丝·沃特斯工作。他每天下午都会来家里，用鲍威尔在花园里种植的香草和蔬菜做一桌丰盛的晚餐。每当乔布斯提出任何奇思怪想——胡萝卜沙拉，九层塔意大利面，香茅汤之类——布朗都会静静地、耐心地想办法做出来。乔布斯一直对食物极其挑剔，而且倾向于对任何食物都立即作出极端的评价：美极了或糟透了。一般人会觉得毫无区别的两个鳄梨，乔布斯尝一口就会宣称，一个是世界上最好吃的而另一个就难以下咽。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Beginning in early  2008 Jobs’s eating disorders got worse. On some nights he would stare at the  floor and ignore all of the dishes set out on the long kitchen table. When  others were halfway through their meal, he would abruptly get up and leave,  saying nothing. It was stressful for his family. They watched him lose forty  pounds during the spring of 2008.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>2008年初，乔布斯的饮食失调问题越来越严重。有的晚上，他会盯着地板，完全无视长桌上摆着的各种美食。其他人刚吃到一半，他会突然站起来，一句话不说就走掉。这给家人造成很大压力，他们眼看着他在2008年春天体重骤减40磅。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>His health problems  became public again in March 2008, when <em>Fortune</em> published a piece called  “The Trouble with Steve Jobs.” It revealed that he had tried to treat his  cancer with diets for nine months and also investigated his involvement in the  backdating of Apple stock options. As the story was being prepared, Jobs  invited—summoned—<em>Fortune</em>’s managing editor Andy Serwer to Cupertino to  pressure him to spike it. He leaned into Serwer’s face and asked, “So, you’ve  uncovered the fact that I’m an asshole. Why is that news?” Jobs made the same  rather self-aware argument when he called Serwer’s boss at Time Inc., John  Huey, from a satellite phone he brought to Hawaii’s Kona Village. He offered to  convene a panel of fellow CEOs and be part of a discussion about what health  issues are proper to disclose, but only if <em>Fortune</em> killed its piece. The  magazine didn’t.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>2008年3月，《财富》杂志刊登了一篇文章，题为“史蒂夫·乔布斯的麻烦”，令他的健康问题再度受到公众关注。文章透露，乔布斯试图通过饮食治疗癌症已经有9个月时间，文章还调査了他与苹果股票期权日期倒签事件的瓜葛。在这篇文章的采写过程中，乔布斯把《财富》总编安迪·瑟沃请到库比蒂诺——与其说是请，不如说是命令，向他施压，希望他撤掉这篇文章。他逼近瑟沃的脸问道，“那么，你就算发现了我是个混蛋，这又有什么新鲜的呢？”他从夏威夷的康娜度假村用卫星电话打给瑟沃在时代公司的老板，约翰·休伊（JohnHuey）,说了同样的颇有自知之明的话。他提出只要《财富》砍掉这篇文章，他可以召集一群CEO来开个座谈会，并且可以与《财富》讨论什么样的健康问题适合披露。然而《财富》还是刊登了这篇文章。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>When Jobs introduced  the iPhone 3G in June  2008, he was so thin that it overshadowed the product announcement. In <em>Esquire</em> Tom Junod described the “withered” figure onstage as being “gaunt as a pirate,  dressed in what had heretofore been the vestments of his invulnerability.”  Apple released a statement saying, untruthfully, that his weight loss was the  result of “a common bug.” The following month, as questions persisted, the  company released another statement saying that Jobs’s health was “a private  matter.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>2008年6月，乔布斯推介iPhone3G时，他的消痩甚至抢了产品发布的风头。在《君子》杂志的一篇报道中，汤姆·朱诺（TomJunod）描述舞台上那个“干瘪”的人，“穿着曾经象征他刀枪不入的战衣，像海盗般骨痩如柴。”苹果发表了一个声明，谎称乔布斯体重减轻是“偶染微恙”的结果。过了一个月，质疑声依然不绝于耳，公司就又发表了一份声明，说乔布斯的健康是“私事”。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Joe Nocera of the <em>New  York Times</em> wrote a column denouncing the handling of Jobs’s health issues.  “Apple simply can’t be trusted to tell the truth about its chief executive,” he  wrote in late July. “Under Mr. Jobs, Apple has created a culture of secrecy  that has served it well in many ways—the speculation over which products Apple  will unveil at the annual Macworld conference has been one of the company’s  best marketing tools. But that same culture poisons its corporate governance.”  As he was writing the column and getting the standard “a private matter”  comment from all at Apple, he got an unexpected call from Jobs himself. “This  is Steve Jobs,” he began. “You think I’m an arrogant asshole who thinks he’s  above the law, and I think you’re a slime bucket who gets most of his facts  wrong.” After that rather arresting opening, Jobs offered up some information  about his health, but only if Nocera would keep it off the record. Nocera  honored the request, but he was able to report that, while Jobs’s health  problems amounted to more than a common bug, “they weren’t life-threatening and  he doesn’t have a recurrence of cancer.” Jobs had given Nocera more information  than he was willing to give his own board and shareholders, but it was not the  full truth.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>《纽约时报》的乔·诺切拉写专栏谴责对乔布斯健康问题的处理方式。“在关于其CEO真实情况的问题上，苹果根本不值得信任。”7月末他这样写道，“在乔布斯先生的领导下，苹果创建了一种保密文化，这种文化在很多方面效果不错——猜测每年Macworld大会上苹果会推出什么产品已经成了该公司最好的营销手段之一。但也正是这种文化毒害了它的公司治理。”他在写这篇文章时，从苹果那里得到的所有反馈都是这纯属“私事”，但他出乎意料地接到了乔布斯本人打来的电话。“我是史蒂夫·乔布斯。”他开门见山地说，“你觉得我是个认为自己可以凌驾于法律之上的傲慢混蛋，而我觉得你是个把大部分事实都搞错了的烂人。”在这段“引人人胜”的开场白之后，乔布斯表示可以提供一些关于他健康状况的信息，但是诺切拉不能将之公之于众。诺切拉接受了这个条件，但是他得以报道说，虽然乔布斯的健康问题已经不仅仅是偶染微恙，“但还不足以危及生命，他的癌症也没有复发。”乔布斯给诺切拉的信息已经比他给苹果董事会和股东的信息还多了，但是那不是完整的事实。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Partly due to concern  about Jobs’s weight loss, Apple’s stock price drifted from $188 at the  beginning of June 2008 down to $156 at the end of July. Matters were not helped  in late August when <em>Bloomberg News</em> mistakenly released its prepackaged  obituary of Jobs, which ended up on Gawker. Jobs was able to roll out Mark  Twain’s famous quip a few days later at his annual music event. “Reports of my  death are greatly exaggerated,” he said, as he launched a line of new iPods.  But his gaunt appearance was not reassuring. By early October the stock price  had sunk to $97.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>部分缘于对乔布斯体重骤减的忧虑，苹果的股票价格从2008年6月初的188美元下滑到了7月底的156美元。雪上加霜的是，不久，彭博社（BlocmbergNews）误发了提前准备好的乔布斯的讣告，最后上了Gawker网。几天后，乔布斯在他的年度音乐活动上引用了马克·吐温的名句：“关于我死亡的报道是严重的夸大。”他在发布新的iPod产晶系列时说。但是他那消痩的外形还是让人无法安心，到10月初，股价跌到了97美元。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>That month Doug Morris  of Universal Music was scheduled to meet with Jobs at Apple. Instead Jobs  invited him to his house. Morris was surprised to see him so ill and in pain.  Morris was about to be honored at a gala in Los Angeles for City of Hope, which  raised money to fight cancer, and he wanted Jobs to be there. Charitable events  were something Jobs avoided, but he decided to do it, both for Morris and for  the cause. At the event, held in a big tent on Santa Monica beach, Morris told  the two thousand guests that Jobs was giving the music industry a new lease on  life. The performances—by Stevie Nicks, Lionel Richie, Erykah Badu, and  Akon—went on past midnight, and Jobs had severe chills. Jimmy Iovine gave him a  hooded sweatshirt to wear, and he kept the hood over his head all evening. “He  was so sick, so cold, so thin,” Morris recalled.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>当月按照计划，环球音乐集团的道格·莫里斯要到苹果公司跟乔布斯会面。乔布斯改变了计划，把他请到自己家里。莫里斯惊讶地看到乔布斯的病容和痛苦。莫里斯要参加在洛杉矶希望之城国家医学中心举办的一场盛会，为对抗癌症筹款，他希望乔布斯出席。乔布斯一向回避慈善活动，但是这次他决定出席，既是为了莫里斯，也是因为这个主题。活动在圣莫妮卡海滩上的大帷篷里举行，莫里斯告诉2000位来宾，是乔布斯让音乐产业重新焕发了生机。当晚的演出有史蒂维·尼克斯（StevieNicks）、莱昂内尔·里奇（LionelRichie）、埃里卡·巴杜（ErykahBadu）和阿肯（Akon）献唱，一直持续到后半夜，乔布斯被冻坏了。吉米·约维内给了他一件带帽子的毛衣，他整晚都把帽子套在头上。“他是那么虚弱，那么冷，那么痩。”莫里斯回忆说。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p><em>Fortune</em>’s veteran technology  writer Brent Schlender was leaving the magazine that December, and his swan  song was to be a joint interview with Jobs, Bill Gates, Andy Grove, and Michael  Dell. It had been hard to organize, and just a few days before it was to  happen, Jobs called to back out. “If they ask why, just tell them I’m an  asshole,” he said. Gates was annoyed, then discovered what the health situation  was. “Of course, he had a very, very good reason,” said Gates. “He just didn’t  want to say.” That became more apparent when Apple announced on December 16  that Jobs was canceling his scheduled appearance at the January Macworld, the  forum he had used for big product launches for the past eleven years.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>《财富》杂志的资深科技记者布伦特·施伦德那年12月就要离职了，他的告别作品将是同时采访乔布斯、比尔·盖茨、安迪·格鲁夫和迈克尔·戴尔。这样一次采访很难组织，然而就在采访日的前几天，乔布斯打来电话声明退出。“如果他们问为什么，就说我是个混蛋。”他说。盖茨一开始很不髙兴，后来发现了乔布斯健康状况的实情。“当然，他有非常非常好的理由，”盖茨说，“他就是不想说出来。”12月16日，苹果宣布乔布斯将取消出席1月份Macworld大会的计划，而过去11年来他都是在这个论坛上发布重量级产品。至此，他的健康状况更加明了。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The blogosphere  erupted with speculation about his health, much of which had the odious smell  of truth. Jobs was furious and felt violated. He was also annoyed that Apple  wasn’t being more active in pushing back. So on January 5, 2009, he wrote and  released a misleading open letter. He claimed that he was skipping Macworld  because he wanted to spend more time with his family. “As many of you know, I  have been losing weight throughout 2008,” he added. “My doctors think they have  found the cause—a hormone imbalance that has been robbing me of the proteins my  body needs to be healthy. Sophisticated blood tests have confirmed this  diagnosis. The remedy for this nutritional problem is relatively simple.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>网络上充斥着对乔布斯健康状况的各种猜测，其中很多都接近事实。乔布斯为之愤怒，感觉自己的隐私遭到了侵犯。他也因为苹果没有更积极地反击而感到不悦。因此在2009年1月5日，他撰写并发布了一封误导公众的公开信。他宣称他不出席Macworld是因为想有更多时间跟家人在一起。“如大家所知，2008年全年我的体重一直在下降。”他补充说，“我的医生们认为他们已经找到了原因——是荷尔蒙失调导致我维持身体健康所需的蛋白质流失，精密的血液检验已经证实了这个诊断。这个营养问题的解决办法是相对简单的。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>There was a kernel of  truth to this, albeit a small one. One of the hormones created by the pancreas  is glucagon, which is the flip side of insulin. Glucagon causes your liver to release  blood sugar. Jobs’s tumor had metastasized into his liver and was wreaking  havoc. In effect, his body was devouring itself, so his doctors gave him drugs  to try to lower the glucagon level. He did have a hormone imbalance, but it was  because his cancer had spread into his liver. He was in personal denial about  this, and he also wanted to be in public denial. Unfortunately that was legally  problematic, because he ran a publicly traded company. But Jobs was furious  about the way the blogosphere was treating him, and he wanted to strike back.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>这封公幵信里有一部分事实，但只是很小一部分。由胰脏分泌的荷尔蒙中有一种胰高血糖素可使血糖升高，与胰岛素（的降血糖作用）相互拮抗。乔布斯的癌细胞转移到肝脏，并造成了严重的破坏。实际上，他的身体在自我毁灭，所以医生在给他用药来降低胰髙血糖素水平。他确实是有荷尔蒙失调，但那是由于他的癌细胞扩散到肝脏造成的。他不但自己不肯承认这点，而且也希望公众不这么认为。不幸的是，这在法律上是有问题的，因为他经营着一家上市公司。但是乔布斯对网络世界对待他的方式感到愤怒，而且他想还击。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>He was very sick at  this point, despite his upbeat statement, and also in excruciating pain. 

<p>He had  undertaken another round of cancer drug therapy, and it had grueling side  effects. His skin started drying out and cracking. In his quest for alternative  approaches, he flew to Basel, Switzerland, to try an experimental  hormone-delivered radiotherapy. He also underwent an experimental treatment  developed in Rotterdam known as peptide receptor radionuclide therapy.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p><p>尽管乔布斯的公开信语调乐观，但当时他非常虚弱，而且饱受疼痛的折磨。</p>

<p>他接受了新一轮的化疗，副作用很大，皮肤开始干裂。他寻求各种治疗方法。他飞到瑞士巴塞尔，尝试了一种试验性的荷尔蒙传导的放射线疗法。他还接受了一种在鹿特丹发明的试验性疗法，叫做肽感受器放射性核素疗法。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>After a week filled  with increasingly insistent legal advice, Jobs finally agreed to go on medical  leave. He made the announcement on January 14, 2009, in another open letter to  the Apple staff. At first he blamed the decision on the prying of bloggers and the  press. “Unfortunately, the curiosity over my personal health continues to be a  distraction not only for me and my family, but everyone else at Apple,” he  said. But then he admitted that the remedy for his “hormone imbalance” was not  as simple as he had claimed. “During the past week I have learned that my  health-related issues are more complex than I originally thought.” Tim Cook  would again take over daily operations, but Jobs said that he would remain CEO,  continue to be involved in major decisions, and be back by June.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>在法律顾问越来越强烈的建议下，一周后乔布斯最终决定休病假。他在2009年1月14日给苹果员工的另一封公开信中宣布了这个消息。首先，他掉这个决定归咎于那些博客和媒体的窥探行为。“很不幸，对我个人健康的好奇不仅持续干扰着我和我的家人，也干扰着苹果的每一位员工。”他说。但是接下来他承认，对他“荷尔蒙失调”的治疗并非如他之前宣称的那么简单。“在过去几周我得知，我的健康问题比我原来想象的要更加复杂。”蒂姆·库克将再次接手日常的运营工作，但是乔布斯说他仍然担任CEO，继续参与重大决策，6月就会回来上班。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs had been  consulting with Bill Campbell and Art Levinson, who were juggling the dual  roles of being his personal health advisors and also the co-lead directors of  the company. But the rest of the board had not been as fully informed, and the  shareholders had initially been misinformed. That raised some legal issues, and  the SEC opened an investigation into whether the company had withheld “material  information” from shareholders. It would constitute security fraud, a felony,  if the company had allowed the dissemination of false information or withheld  true information that was relevant to the company’s financial prospects.  Because Jobs and his magic were so closely identified with Apple’s comeback,  his health seemed to meet this standard. But it was a murky area of the law;  the privacy rights of the CEO had to be weighed. This balance was particularly  difficult in the case of Jobs, who both valued his privacy and embodied his  company more than most CEOs. He did not make the task easier. He became very  emotional, both ranting and crying at times, when railing against anyone who  suggested that he should be less secretive.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯一直在向比尔·坎贝尔和亚瑟·莱文森咨询，他们既是他的个人健康顾问又是公司的联合独立董事。但是董事会其他成员就没有获得同样充分的信息，而且股东最初得到的信息是错误的。这引起了一些法律问题，证券交易委员会立案调查苹果公司是否向股东隐瞒了“重大信息”。如果公司允许错误信息传播或隐瞒了跟公司的财务前景相关的真实信息，将构成证券欺诈，是一顼重罪。由于舆论认为乔布斯和他的魔力跟苹果的再度崛起紧密相关，他的健康问题似乎就符合了“重大信息”的标准。但这是法律的灰色地带，必须要把CEO的隐私杈考虑在内。在乔布斯这个案例中，要实现信息公开与保护隐私的平衡尤为困难，因为他既重视自己的隐私，又比大多数CEO都赋予了公司更多的个人风格。他还令这个任务难上加难。他变得非常情绪化，痛骂起任何建议他不应该那么神秘的人，常常又是咆哮又是流泪。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Campbell treasured his  friendship with Jobs, and he didn’t want to have any fiduciary duty to violate  his privacy, so he offered to step down as a director. “The privacy side is so  important to me,” he later said. “He’s been my friend for about a million  years.” The lawyers eventually determined that Campbell didn’t need to resign  from the board but that he should step aside as co-lead director. He was  replaced in that role by Andrea Jung of Avon. The SEC investigation ended up  going nowhere, and the board circled the wagons to protect Jobs from calls that  he release more information. “The press wanted us to blurt out more personal  details,” recalled Al Gore. “It was really up to Steve to go beyond what the  law requires, but he was adamant that he didn’t want his privacy invaded. His  wishes should be respected.” When I asked Gore whether the board should have  been more forthcoming at the beginning of 2009, when Jobs’s health issues were  far worse than shareholders were led to believe, he replied, “We hired outside  counsel to do a review of what the law required and what the best practices  were, and we handled it all by the book. I sound defensive, but the criticism  really pissed me off.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>坎贝尔很珍视他跟乔布斯的友谊，他不想因所承担的任何诚信责任而去侵犯乔布斯的隐私，因此他提出辞去董事职务。“保护他的隐私对我非常重要，”他后来说，“我们是一百万年的朋友了。”律师团最终决定，坎贝尔无需辞去董事会职务，但是不应继续担任联合首席董事。雅芳总裁钟彬娴接替了这一职位。证券交易委员会的调查无果而终，董事会也齐心协力保护乔布斯免受那些让他公开更多信息的要求。“媒体希望我们能透露更多个人细节，”阿尔·戈尔回忆说。“应该由史蒂夫来决定是否需要提供超出法律要求的信息，但是他非常坚决地认为他不希望自己的隐私受到侵犯。他的愿望应该得到尊重。”我问戈尔，2009年初董事会是否应该提供更多信息，当时乔布斯的健康问题比股东们被误导去相信的状况要严重得多，他回答说，“我们聘请了外部律师去研究法律规定和最佳做法，然后我们完全是按章行事。我说起来像是在辩解，但那些批评真的让我烦透了。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>One board member  disagreed. Jerry York, the former CFO at Chrysler and IBM, did not say anything  publicly, but he confided to a reporter at the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, off  the record, that he was “disgusted” when he learned that the company had  concealed Jobs’s health problems in late 2008. “Frankly, I wish I had resigned  then.” When York died in 2010, the <em>Journal</em> put his comments on the  record. York had also provided off-the-record information to <em>Fortune</em>,  which the magazine used when Jobs went on his third health leave, in 2011.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>有一位董事会成员有不同意见。前克莱斯勒和IBM首席财务官杰里·约克没有公开置评，但是私下向《华尔街日报》的一位记者吐露，当他知道公司在2008年底隐瞒了乔布斯的健康问题时，觉得很“恶心”。“坦白地说，我真希望当时我已经辞职了。”2010年约克去世时，《华尔街日报》发表了他的评论。约克还向《财富》杂志提供了非公开信息，该杂志在2011年乔布斯第三次休病假时进行了披露。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Some at Apple didn’t  believe the quotes attributed to York were accurate, since he had not  officially raised objections at the time. But Bill Campbell knew that the  reports rang true; York had complained to him in early 2009. “Jerry had a  little more white wine than he should have late at night, and he would call at  two or three in the morning and say, ‘What the fuck, I’m not buying that shit  about his health, we’ve got to make sure.’ And then I’d call him the next  morning and he’d say, ‘Oh fine, no problem.’ So on some of those evenings, I’m  sure he got raggy and talked to reporters.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>苹果公司的一些人不相信那些引述约克的话是准确的，因为约克当时没有正式提出反对意见。但是比尔·坎贝尔知道这些报道是真实的，因为约克在2009年初曾经向他抱怨过。“杰里在深夜多喝了点儿白葡萄酒，凌晨两三点钟打电话来说，‘去他妈的，我才不相信那些关于他健康的鬼话，我们得确认一下’等我第二天早晨给他打电恬，他会说，‘哦，没什么，没间题的。’这样说来，在某个晚上，我敢肯定他会喝多了然后跟记者说了些什么。”</p></div></div>

<p>The head of Jobs’s  oncology team was Stanford University’s George Fisher, a leading researcher on  gastrointestinal and colorectal cancers. He had been warning Jobs for months  that he might have to consider a liver transplant, but that was the type of  information that Jobs resisted processing. Powell was glad that Fisher kept  raising the possibility, because she knew it would take repeated proddings to  get her husband to consider the idea.</p>

<p>乔布斯的肿瘤治疗团队的负责人是斯坦福大学的乔治·费希尔，他是胃肠癌和结直肠癌领域的知名专家。他已经警告了乔布斯几个月时间，说他可能必须要考虑肝移植，但是这种信息是乔布斯拒绝接纳的。鲍威尔很髙兴费希尔能反复提出这种可能性，因为她知道她丈夫要经过反复刺激才会考虑这个建议。</p></div></div>

<p>He finally became  convinced in January 2009, just after he claimed his “hormonal imbalance” could  be treated easily. But there was a problem. He was put on the wait list for a  liver transplant in California, but it became clear he would never get one  there in time. The number of available donors with his blood type was small.  Also, the metrics used by the United Network for Organ Sharing, which  establishes policies in the United States, favored those suffering from  cirrhosis and hepatitis over cancer patients.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>2009年1月，就在他宣称他的“荷尔蒙失调”很容易治疗之后，乔布斯终于被说服了。但是还有一个问题。他在加利福尼亚登记等待肝移植，但是很显然，他在那儿根本来不及等到一个可移植的肝脏。跟他的血型匹配的捐献者数量很小，加上制定美国器官移植政策的机构——器官共享联合网络（UnitedNetworkforOrganSharing）所采用的机制，是优先考虑肝硬化和肝炎病人而非癌症病人。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>There is no legal way  for a patient, even one as wealthy as Jobs, to jump the queue, and he didn’t.  Recipients are chosen based on their MELD score (Model for End-Stage Liver  Disease), which uses lab tests of hormone levels to determine how urgently a  transplant is needed, and on the length of time they have been waiting. Every  donation is closely audited, data are available on public websites  (optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/), and you can monitor your status on the wait list  at any time.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>病人没有合法途径在排位过程中插队，即使是像乔布斯这样富有的人也不行，他也没有那样做。器官接受者是根据他们的终末期肝病模型（MELD，ModelforEnd-StageLiverDisease）评分结果被选中的，该模型通过实验室检测荷尔蒙水平来决定移植需求的迫切性，同时也考虑病人已经等待的时间。每一例捐献都被严格审计，公开网站上能查到相关数据（optn.transplant.hrsa.gov），你可以在任何时候上网查看你的排位情况。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Powell became the  troller of the organ-donation websites, checking in every night to see how many  were on the wait lists, what their MELD scores were, and how long they had been  on. “You can do the math, which I did, and it would have been way past June  before he got a liver in California, and the doctors felt that his liver would  give out in about April,” she recalled. So she started asking questions and  discovered that it was permissible to be on the list in two different states at  the same time, which is something that about 3% of potential recipients do.  Such multiple listing is not discouraged by policy, even though critics say it  favors the rich, but it is difficult. There were two major requirements: The  potential recipient had to be able to get to the chosen hospital within eight  hours, which Jobs could do thanks to his plane, and the doctors from that  hospital had to evaluate the patient in person before adding him or her to the  list.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>鲍威尔成了这个器官捐献网站的忠实用户，每天晚上都会去査还有多少人在排位，他们的MELD分数是多少，以及他们排了多久。“你可以算出来，我算了一下，要等到他在加利福尼亚得到一个肝脏，时间早就过了6月，而医生们认为他的肝脏可能在4月左右就会出问题。”她回忆说。因此她开始四处打听，得知同时在两个州进行排位是允许的，有3%等待移植的病人会这样做。尽管有批评认为这是偏向富人，但多处排位没有政策限制，只是操作很困难。有两个主要的要求：一个是排位者必须能够在8小时内赶到选定的医院，这一点乔布斯有私人飞机可以做到，另一个是，选定医院的医生必须在把病人加入排位前对其进行当面评估。</p></div></div>

<p>George Riley, the San  Francisco lawyer who often served as Apple’s outside counsel, was a caring  Tennessee gentleman, and he had become close to Jobs. His parents had both been  doctors at Methodist University Hospital in Memphis, he was born there, and he  was a friend of James Eason, who ran the transplant institute there. Eason’s  unit was one of the best and busiest in the nation; in 2008 he and his team did  121 liver transplants. He had no problem allowing people from elsewhere to  multiple-list in Memphis. “It’s not gaming the system,” he said. “It’s people  choosing where they want their health care. Some people would leave Tennessee  to go to California or somewhere else to seek treatment. Now we have people  coming from California to Tennessee.” Riley arranged for Eason to fly to Palo  Alto and conduct the required evaluation there.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>担任苹果公司外部法律顾问的旧金山律师乔治·莱利是位细心的田纳西绅士，他跟乔布斯的关系很近。他的父母都是孟菲斯卫理公会大学医院（MethodistUniversityHospital）的医生，他在那里出生，他的朋友詹姆斯·伊森（JamesEason）在那儿运营一家移植机构。伊森的机构是全美国最好也是最忙的，2008年他和他的团队做了121例肝移植手术。他不介意其他地方的人在孟菲斯重复排位。“这并不是钴系统的空子，”他说，“这是人们在选择他们希望在哪儿看病。有些人会离开田纳西去加利福尼亚或其他地方寻求治疗，现在有人从加利福尼亚来我们田纳西。”莱利安排伊森飞到帕洛奥图，对乔布斯进行所需的检查评估。</p></div></div>

<div class="left">
<p>By late February 2009  Jobs had secured a place on the Tennessee list (as well as the one in  California), and the nervous waiting began. He was declining rapidly by the  first week in March, and the waiting time was projected to be twenty-one days.  “It was dreadful,” Powell recalled. “It didn’t look like we would make it in  time.” Every day became more excruciating. He moved up to third on the list by  mid-March, then second, and finally first. But then days went by. The awful  reality was that upcoming events like St. Patrick’s Day and March Madness  (Memphis was in the 2009 tournament and was a regional site) offered a greater  likelihood of getting a donor because the drinking causes a spike in car  accidents.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>到2009年2月下旬，乔布斯在田纳西排上了队（在加利福尼亚也同时排队），然后开始了焦急的等待。3月的第一周他的情况迅速恶化，而等待的时间预计还有21天。“太可怕了，”鲍威尔回忆说，“当时觉得我们来不及了。”每一天都变得越发折磨人。到3月中旬，他在排位中上升到第三名，然后第二名，终于到了第一名。但是之后日子一天天过去。讽刺的是，即将到来的圣帕特里克节和“疯狂三月”①（孟菲斯进入了2009全美锦标赛而且是分赛场）等活动创造了更大的捐献可能性，因为喝酒会导致交通事故飙升。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Indeed, on the weekend  of March 21, 2009, a young man in his midtwenties was killed in a car crash,  and his organs were made available. Jobs and his wife flew to Memphis, where  they landed just before 4 a.m.  and were met by Eason. A car was waiting on the tarmac, and everything was  staged so that the admitting paperwork was done as they rushed to the hospital.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>事实正是如此，在2009年3月21日，一位二十多岁的年轻人在一场车祸中丧生，他的器官可以移植。乔布斯和他的妻子立即飞往孟菲斯，他们在凌晨4点前抵达，伊森在那边等着他们。汽车在停机坪等候，一切都已经安排好了，他们当即签署了一系列许可文件，之后就赶往医院。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The transplant was a  success, but not reassuring. When the doctors took out his liver, they found  spots on the peritoneum, the thin membrane that surrounds internal organs. In  addition, there were tumors throughout the liver, which meant it was likely  that the cancer had migrated elsewhere as well. It had apparently mutated and  grown quickly. They took samples and did more genetic mapping.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>移植成功了，但是结果并不乐观。当医生们取出他的肝脏时，发现包围内脏的腹膜上有斑点。另外，他的肝脏上到处都是肿瘤，意味着癌症很可能已经扩散到了其他部位。显然，癌症变异和生长的速度很快。医生们取了样本进行基因定位。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>A few days later they  needed to perform another procedure. Jobs insisted against all advice they not  pump out his stomach, and when they sedated him, he aspirated some of the  contents into his lungs and developed pneumonia. At that point they thought he  might die. As he described it later:</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>几天后，他们需要施行另一项程序。乔布斯坚持拒绝把胃排空，当他们给他使用镇定剂时，他把一些镇定剂吸进了肺里，导致了肺炎。当时医生们以为他会死掉。他后来这样描述：</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>I  almost died because in this routine procedure they blew it. Laurene was there  and they flew my children in, because they did not think I would make it  through the night. Reed was looking at colleges with one of Laurene’s brothers.  We had a private plane pick him up near Dartmouth and tell them what was going  on. A plane also picked up the girls. They thought it might be the last chance  they had to see me conscious. But I made it.</p>
  <p>Powell took charge of  overseeing the treatment, staying in the hospital room all day and watching  each of the monitors vigilantly. “Laurene was a beautiful tiger protecting  him,” recalled Jony Ive, who came as soon as Jobs could receive visitors. Her  mother and three brothers came down at various times to keep her company.  Jobs’s sister Mona Simpson also hovered protectively. She and George Riley were  the only people Jobs would allow to fill in for Powell at his bedside.  “Laurene’s family helped us take care of the kids—her mom and brothers were  great,” Jobs later said. “I was very fragile and not cooperative. But an  experience like that binds you together in a deep way.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p><p>我差点儿死掉，因为在这个例行程序中他们搞砸了。劳伦在那儿，他们用飞机把孩子们也接来了，因为他们认为我挺不过那个晚上。里德跟劳伦的一个兄弟在参观一些大学，他们派私人飞机在达特茅斯附近接上他，告诉他发生了什么事，另一架飞机把女儿们也接来了。他们以为那是最后一次机会见到清醒的我，但是我挺过来了。</p>
<p>鲍威尔负责监控整个治疗活动，她整天待在病房里，警惕地盯着每一台监视器。“劳伦就像一只美丽的老虎保护着他，”乔尼·艾弗回忆说，乔布斯一能见客他就来了。鲍威尔的妈妈和三个兄弟时常来陪她，乔布斯的妹妹莫娜·辛普森也不离左右。她和乔治·莱利是乔布斯唯一允许替换鲍威尔看护他的人。“劳伦的家人帮我们照顾孩子们——她妈妈和兄弟们太好了。”乔布斯后来说，“我非常虚弱也很不合作。但是像这样的经历会把你们深深地团结在一起。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Powell came every day  at 7 a.m. and gathered the  relevant data, which she put on a spreadsheet. “It was very complicated because  there were a lot of different things going on,” she recalled. When James Eason  and his team of doctors arrived at 9 a.m.,  she would have a meeting with them to coordinate all aspects of Jobs’s  treatment. At 9 p.m., before she left, she would prepare a report on how each  of the vital signs and other measurements were trending, along with a set of  questions she wanted answered the next day. “It allowed me to engage my brain  and stay focused,” she recalled.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>鲍威尔每天早晨7点钟来，收集相关数据，录入到一个电子报表中。“因为同时进行许多监测，那些数据非常复杂。”她回忆说。当詹姆斯·伊森和医生团队9点钟到达时，鲍威尔会跟他们开个会，协调乔布斯治疗的各个方面。在她晚上9点钟离开前，她会做一份报告，汇总每个关键指标和其他监测结果的走势，以及她希望第二天得到答案的一系列问题。“这能让我集中注意力去想一些问题。”她回忆说。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Eason did what no one  at Stanford had fully done: take charge of all aspects of the medical care.  Since he ran the facility, he could coordinate the transplant recovery, cancer  tests, pain treatments, nutrition, rehabilitation, and nursing. He would even  stop at the convenience store to get the energy drinks Jobs liked.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>伊森所做的一切即使在斯坦福也是史无前例的：他主管了治疗过程的所有方面。鉴于他经营这家机构，他可以协调移植康复、癌症监测、疼痛治疗、营养、康复和护理等各个方面。他甚至还会去便利店买乔布斯喜欢的功能饮料。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Two of the nurses were  from tiny towns in Mississippi, and they became Jobs’s favorites. They were  solid family women and not intimidated by him. Eason arranged for them to be  assigned only to Jobs. “To manage Steve, you have to be persistent,” recalled  Tim Cook. “Eason managed Steve and forced him to do things that no one else  could, things that were good for him that may not have been pleasant.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>有两位护士来自密西西比州的小镇，她们成了乔布斯的最爱。她们都是健壮的家庭妇女，不会被乔布斯吓到。伊森安排她们专门护理乔布斯。“要管理史蒂夫，你必须要坚持。”蒂姆·库克回兑，“伊森能管住史蒂夫，强迫他做别人无法让他做的事情，那些为他好，但可能做起来并不愉快的事。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Despite all the  coddling, Jobs at times almost went crazy. He chafed at not being in control,  and he sometimes hallucinated or became angry. Even when he was barely  conscious, his strong personality came through. At one point the pulmonologist  tried to put a mask over his face when he was deeply sedated. Jobs ripped it  off and mumbled that he hated the design and refused to wear it. Though barely  able to speak, he ordered them to bring five different options for the mask and  he would pick a design he liked. The doctors looked at Powell, puzzled. She was  finally able to distract him so they could put on the mask. He also hated the  oxygen monitor they put on his finger. He told them it was ugly and too  complex. He suggested ways it could be designed more simply. “He was very  attuned to every nuance of the environment and objects around him, and that  drained him,” Powell recalled.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>虽然备受呵护，乔布斯有时还是要发疯。他很气恼自己不能控制局面，有时他会产生幻觉或是发怒。即使在他几乎失去知觉时，他那强悍的人格依然存在。有一次在他深度镇静时，肺脏医生要住他脸上戴面罩。乔布斯把面罩扯掉，嘟囔着说他讨厌这个面罩的设计，不要戴它。虽然他几乎无法说话，但是他命令医生拿来五种不同的面罩，选出一个他喜欢的。医生们看着鲍威尔，非常为难。她最终成功地转移了他的注意力，他们才能够给他戴上面罩。他也讨厌他们安装在他手指上的氧含量监视器，他告诉他们那个东西太难看也太复杂，他还建议了可以使之设计得更简涪的种种方式。“他髙度关注周围环境和物体的任何一个细微差别，这让他筋疲力尽。”鲍威尔回忆说。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>One day, when he was  still floating in and out of consciousness, Powell’s close friend Kathryn Smith  came to visit. Her relationship with Jobs had not always been the best, but  Powell insisted that she come by the bedside. He motioned her over, signaled  for a pad and pen, and wrote, “I want my iPhone.” Smith took it off the dresser  and brought it to him. Taking her hand, he showed her the “swipe to open”  function and made her play with the menus.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>一天，在他半清醒状态的时候，鲍威尔的好朋友凯瑟琳·史密斯来探望他。她跟乔布斯的关系并不是一直都很亲密，但是鲍威尔坚持让她来到乔布斯的病床边。他示意她走近些，要来纸和笔，写道，“我要我的iPhone。”史密斯从边柜上把它拿过来交给他。他手把手地教她“移动滑块解锁”的功能，还让她玩菜单。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs’s relationship  with Lisa Brennan-Jobs, his daughter with Chrisann, had frayed. She had  graduated from Harvard, moved to New York City, and rarely communicated with  her father. But she flew down to Memphis twice, and he appreciated it. “It  meant a lot to me that she would do that,” he recalled. Unfortunately he didn’t  tell her at the time. Many of the people around Jobs found Lisa could be as  demanding as her father, but Powell welcomed her and tried to get her involved.  It was a relationship she wanted to restore.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯跟丽萨·布伦南-乔布斯（即他跟第一个女朋友克里斯安的女儿）关系早已变得很紧张。她已经从哈佛毕业，搬到了纽约，很少跟她父亲联络。但是这一期间她两度飞到孟菲斯，乔布斯心存感激。“她能那样做对我意味着很多。”他回忆说。可惜他当时并没有告诉她。乔布斯周围很多人发现，丽萨像她爸爸一样爱发号施令，但是鲍威尔欢迎她，尽量让她参与进来。她希望能恢复乔布斯和丽萨之间的关系。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>As Jobs got better,  much of his feisty personality returned. He still had his bile ducts. “When he  started to recover, he passed quickly through the phase of gratitude, and went  right back into the mode of being grumpy and in charge,” Kat Smith recalled.  “We were all wondering if he was going to come out of this with a kinder  perspective, but he didn’t.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>随着乔布斯健康的好转，他那易怒的性格又回来了。他的胆管还在。“当他开始康复时，他迅速地从感激阶段直接返回到爆脾气和控制狂的模式。”史密斯回忆说，“我们都猜想他去鬼门关走了一遭回来，是不是会变得友善些，可是他没有。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>He also remained a  finicky eater, which was more of a problem than ever. He would eat only fruit  smoothies, and he would demand that seven or eight of them be lined up so he  could find an option that might satisfy him. He would touch the spoon to his  mouth for a tiny taste and pronounce, “That’s no good. That one’s no good  either.” Finally Eason pushed back. “You know, this isn’t a matter of taste,”  he lectured. “Stop thinking of this as food. Start thinking of it as medicine.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>他吃东西也还是那么挑剔，而这比以往都更成问题。他只吃水果沙冰，还会要求把六七种不同口味的摆在他面前，供他挑选一种令他满意的。他把勺子放在嘴边尝一小口就会断言，“这个不好。那个也不好。”最后伊森]反击了。“你知道，这不是口味问题，”他教育乔布斯，“别再把这个当成食物。从现在开始就把它当成药。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs’s mood buoyed  when he was able to have visitors from Apple. Tim Cook came down regularly and  filled him in on the progress of new products. “You could see him brighten  every time the talk turned to Apple,” Cook said. “It was like the light turned  on.” He loved the company deeply, and he seemed to live for the prospect of  returning. Details would energize him. When Cook described a new model of the  iPhone, Jobs spent the next hour discussing not only what to call it—they  agreed on iPhone 3GS—but also the size and font of the “GS,” including whether  the letters should be capitalized (yes) and italicized (no).</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>每当有苹果的同事来探望他，乔布斯就情绪高涨。蒂姆·库克会经常过来向他汇报新产品的进展。“每次话题转移到苹果，你就可以看到他神采奕奕，”库克说，“就像灯点亮了一样。”乔布斯深深地爱着这家公司，他似乎是为了能够重返公司而活着。细节问题会让他充满力量，当库克描述新一代的iPhone时，乔布斯会花上一小时的时间来讨论它的命名——他们商定叫iPhone3GS——以及“GS”两个字母的字号和字体，包括是否应该大写（是）和是否斜体（否）。</p></div></div>

<p>One day Riley arranged  a surprise after-hours visit to Sun Studio, the redbrick shrine where Elvis,  Johnny Cash, B.B. King, and many other rock-and-roll pioneers recorded. They  were given a private tour and a history lecture by one of the young staffers,  who sat with Jobs on the cigarette-scarred bench that Jerry Lee Lewis used.  Jobs was arguably the most influential person in the music industry at the  time, but the kid didn’t recognize him in his emaciated state. As they were  leaving, Jobs told Riley, “That kid was really smart. We should hire him for  iTunes.” So Riley called Eddy Cue, who flew the boy out to California for an  interview and ended up hiring him to help build the early R&amp;B and  rock-and-roll sections of iTunes. When Riley went back to see his friends at  Sun Studio later, they said that it proved, as their slogan said, that your  dreams can still come true at Sun Studio.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>有一天莱利安排了一次惊喜之旅，参观Sun工作室（SunStudio），那个红砖建筑的摇滚乐圣地，猫王、约翰尼·卡什、比比金（B.B.King）等很多摇滚乐先驱都曾在此录制唱片。乔布斯一行被单独安排参观，并由一个年轻员工介绍历史，这个年轻人跟乔布斯一起坐在杰瑞·李·刘易斯（JerryLeeLewis）用过的满是烟头烫痕的长凳上。乔布斯可以说是当时音乐产业里最有影响力的人物，但是那个年轻人没认出憔悴的他。他们走的时候，乔布斯吿诉莱利，“那个孩子非常聪明。我们应该录用他来做iTunes。”莱利通知了埃迪·库埃，他安排那个男孩飞去加利福尼亚面试，最终聘用他参与建设iTunes商店早期节奏布鲁斯（R&B）和摇滚乐曲库的工作。后来莱利回到Sun工作室看望朋友们时，他们说这件事证明，如他们的口号所说——你的梦想在Sun工作室依然可以成为现实——

<div class="left"><h3><a name="s3" id="s3"></a>Return</h3> </p>
<p>At the end of May 2009  Jobs flew back from Memphis on his jet with his wife and sister. They were met  at the San Jose airfield by Tim Cook and Jony Ive, who came aboard as soon as  the plane landed. “You could see in his eyes his excitement at being back,”  Cook recalled. “He had fight in him and was raring to go.” Powell pulled out a  bottle of sparkling apple cider and toasted her husband, and everyone embraced.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><h3>归来</h3>

<p>2009年5月底，乔布斯与妻子和妹妹乘私人飞机从孟菲斯归来，蒂姆·库克和乔尼·艾弗在圣何塞机场迎接他们。飞机一落地，他们就登上了飞机。“你可以在他的眼中看到那种归来的兴奋。”库克回忆说，“他充满斗志，迫不及待。”鲍威尔开了一瓶苹果酒，提议为她的丈夫干杯，大家都热烈拥抱。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Ive was emotionally  drained. He drove to Jobs’s house from the airport and told him how hard it had  been to keep things going while he was away. He also complained about the stories  saying that Apple’s innovation depended on Jobs and would disappear if he  didn’t return. “I’m really hurt,” Ive told him. He felt “devastated,” he said,  and underappreciated.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>艾弗满心的疲惫。他开车从机场回乔布斯家，一路上都在跟乔布斯讲他不在的时候让一切照常运转有多么困难。他还抱怨那些媒体文章说苹果的创新全部仰仗乔布斯，如果乔布斯不回来创新就会消失。“我真的很伤心。”艾弗告诉他。他感觉“备受打击”，而且卖力不讨好。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs was likewise in a  dark mental state after his return to Palo Alto. He was coming to grips with  the thought that he might <em>not</em> be indispensable to the company. Apple  stock had fared well while he was away, going from $82 when he announced his  leave in January 2009 to $140 when he returned at the end of May. On one  conference call with analysts shortly after Jobs went on leave, Cook departed  from his unemotional style to give a rousing declaration of why Apple would  continue to soar even with Jobs absent:</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯回到帕洛奥图之后，也陷入了类似的低落状态。他开始意识到，对公司来说他可能并不是不可缺少的。在他休息期间，苹果的股票走势良好，从他在2009年1月宣布病休时的82美元涨到了5月底他回来时的140美元。乔布斯病休后不久，在一次跟分析员的电话会议上，库克一改淡定的风格，富有煽动性地宣讲了为什么即使乔布斯不在，苹果也会继续髙歌猛进：</p></div></div>

<p>We  believe that we are on the face of the earth to make great products, and that’s  not changing. We are constantly focusing on innovating. We believe in the  simple not the complex. We believe that we need to own and control the primary  technologies behind the products that we make, and participate only in markets  where we can make a significant contribution. We believe in saying no to  thousands of projects, so that we can really focus on the few that are truly  important and meaningful to us. We believe in deep collaboration and  cross-pollination of our groups, which allow us to innovate in a way that  others cannot. And frankly, we don’t settle for anything less than excellence  in every group in the company, and we have the self-honesty to admit when we’re  wrong and the courage to change. And I think, regardless of who is in what job,  those values are so embedded in this company that Apple will do extremely well.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>我们相信，我们在地球上存在的目的就是创造伟大的产品，这一点不会改变。我们一直专注于创新。我们崇尚简约而不是复杂。我们相信我们需要拥有并控制我们制造的产品背后的重要技术，并只参与那些我们可以作出重大贯献的市场。我们相信要对成千上万的项目说不，这样我们才能真正专注于那些对我们来说确实重要和有意义的少数项目。我们相信团队间的深度合作和相互启发，这让我们用别人没有的方式进行创新。坦白地说，这家公司的每一个团队都在不懈地追求完美，我们能诚实地对待自己，承认错误，并有勇气去改变。我认为，无论是谁在做什么工作，这些价值已经深深地扎根在这家公司，苹果将表现非凡。</p></div></div>

  <p>It sounded like  something Jobs would say (and had said), but the press dubbed it “the Cook  doctrine.” Jobs was rankled and deeply depressed, especially about the last  line. He didn’t know whether to be proud or hurt that it might be true. There  was talk that he might step aside and become chairman rather than CEO. That  made him all the more motivated to get out of his bed, overcome the pain, and  start taking his restorative long walks again.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>这听起来像是乔布斯会说的（和已经说过的），但是媒体把它命名为“库克教义”。乔布斯心生怨气，深感沮丧，尤其是对于那最后一句。那可能是事实，乔布斯不知道应该为此感到骄傲还是伤心。坊间传言他可能不会再做CEO,而是退居二线做董事会主席。这种说法让他更加不顾一切地想起身下床、克服病痛，再次开始他那恢复体力的长时间散步。</p></div></div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>A board meeting was  scheduled a few days after he returned, and Jobs surprised everyone by making  an appearance. He ambled in and was able to stay for most of the meeting. By  early June he was holding daily meetings at his house, and by the end of the  month he was back at work.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>在他回来几天后，苹果按计划有一次董事会，乔布斯出人意料地露面了。他缓缓地踱进会议室，并留下来参加了大部分会议。到6月初，他开始在家里主持每日例会，到月底他就回公司工作了。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Would he now, after  facing death, be more mellow? His colleagues quickly got an answer. On his  first day back, he startled his top team by throwing a series of tantrums. He  ripped apart people he had not seen for six months, tore up some marketing  plans, and chewed out a couple of people whose work he found shoddy. But what  was truly telling was the pronouncement he made to a couple of friends late  that afternoon. “I had the greatest time being back today,” he said. “I can’t  believe how creative I’m feeling, and how the whole team is.” Tim Cook took it  in stride. “I’ve never seen Steve hold back from expressing his view or  passion,” he later said. “But that was good.”</p>

<div class="right"><p>与死神擦肩而过的他，现在会变得更加平和成熟吗？他的同事们很快就得到了答案。在回来工作的第一天他就接二连三地发脾气，让他的高管团队大吃一惊。他让那些6个月没见的同事狼狈不堪，撕毁了一些营销方案，训斥了几个他认为工作质量拙劣的人。但真正惊人的还是那天下午晚些时候他对几个朋友说的恬：“我今天过得最开心，”他说，“我无法相信我感觉多么富有创造力，整个团队是多么富有创造力。”蒂姆·库克对这一切都泰然处之。“我从没见过史蒂夫能克制住自己不表达他的观点或情感，”他后来说，“但这很好。”</p></div></div>

<p>Friends noted that  Jobs had retained his feistiness. During his recuperation he signed up for  Comcast’s high-definition cable service, and one day he called Brian Roberts,  who ran the company. “I thought he was calling to say something nice about it,”  Roberts recalled. “Instead, he told me ‘It sucks.’” But Andy Hertzfeld noticed  that, beneath the gruffness, Jobs had become more honest. “Before, if you asked  Steve for a favor, he might do the exact opposite,” Hertzfeld said. “That was  the perversity in his nature. Now he actually tries to be helpful.”</p>

<div class="right"><p>朋友们注意到乔布斯保留了他易怒的特点。在他康复期间，他购买了康卡斯特公司（Comcast）公司的髙清有线电视服务，有一天他给该公司的老板布莱恩·罗伯茨（BrianRoberts）打电话。“我以为他打电话来是要夸奖我们的服务，”罗伯茨回忆说，“相反，他吿诉我‘它烂透了’。”但是安迪·赫茨菲尔德注意到，在他那粗鲁之下，乔布斯变得更真诚了。“以前，如果你请史蒂夫帮忙，他可能会做截然相反的事情。”赫茨菲尔德说，“那是他的叛逆本性。而现在，他实际上会尽量帮忙。”</p></div></div>

<p>His public return came  on September 9, when he took the stage at the company’s regular fall music  event. He got a standing ovation that lasted almost a minute, then he opened on  an unusually personal note by mentioning that he was the recipient of a liver  donation. “I wouldn’t be here without such generosity,” he said, “so I hope all  of us can be as generous and elect to become organ donors.” After a moment of  exultation—“I’m vertical, I’m back at Apple, and I’m loving every day of it”—he  unveiled the new line of iPod Nanos, with video cameras, in nine different  colors of anodized aluminum.</p>

<div class="right"><p>他的公开回归是在9月9日，在公司例行的秋季音乐活动上，他登上了舞台。观众起立鼓掌将近一分钟，然后他做了个不太常见的个人化的开场白，说明他接受了肝移植。“没有这样的慷慨捐献，我将无法出现在这儿，”他说，“所以我希望我们都能够同样慷慨地成为器官捐献者。”一阵欢呼之后他又说，“我站起来了，我回到了苹果，我爱这里的每一天。”他随后掲幕了新的iPodNano产品系列，内置摄像头，拋光镀铝材质，配有九种不同的颜色。</p></div></div>

<p>By the beginning of  2010 he had recovered most of his strength, and he threw himself back into work  for what would be one of his, and Apple’s, most productive years. He had hit  two consecutive home runs since launching Apple’s digital hub strategy: the  iPod and the iPhone. Now he was going to swing for another.</p>

到2010年年初，他已经恢复了大部分体力，重新投入到工作中，迎接他的是他、也是苹果最多产的一年。自从推行苹果的数字中枢战略以来，他已经打出了两个本垒打：iPod和iPhone。现在，他要再次出击。
