<div class="left"><h3>The Pirates Abandon Ship</h3>

</div>
<div class="right">
<h3>海盗弃船</h3>

<p>在一次由斯坦福大学校长唐纳德·肯尼迪（DonaldKennedy）举办的午宴上，乔布斯结识了生物学家保罗·伯格（PaulBerg）。伯格是诺贝尔奖得主，闲谈中对他讲述了基因拼接和重组领域取得的进展。乔布斯喜欢摄取信息，尤其是和知识渊博的人在一起的时候。</p>

</div></div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Upon his return from  Europe in August 1985, while he was casting about for what to do next, Jobs called  the Stanford biochemist Paul Berg to discuss the advances that were being made  in gene splicing and recombinant DNA.

<p> Berg described how difficult it was to do  experiments in a biology lab, where it could take weeks to nurture an  experiment and get a result. “Why don’t you simulate them on a computer?” Jobs  asked.</p>

<p> Berg replied that computers with such capacities were too expensive for  university labs. “Suddenly, he was excited about the possibilities,” Berg  recalled. “He had it in his mind to start a new company. He was young and rich,  and had to find something to do with the rest of his life.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">




<p>1985年8月，乔布斯从欧洲回来，正在琢磨接下来要做些什么。他打电话给伯格，询问能否再聚一次。他们在斯坦福大学的校园里散步，最后在一个小咖啡店里吃午饭，探讨问题。
</p>
<p>伯格向乔布斯解释了在生物实验室做实验的困难程度，做一个实验并获得结果可能需要数周时间。“为什么不在计算机上进行模拟实验呢？”乔布斯问道，“这样不仅你自己能够更快地开展实验，而且，有一天，美国的微生物学新生都会用到保罗·伯格的基因重组软件。”</p>

<p>伯格解释说，对于大学实验室来说，具备这种能力的计算机太贵了。“突然间，乔布斯就为这种现状所蕴含的可能性兴奋起来，”伯格回忆说，“他想到要创办一家新企业。他年轻、富有，要为自己今后的生活找点儿事做。”</p>
</div></div>

<div class="left">
<p>Jobs had already been  canvassing academics to ask what their workstation needs were. It was something  he had been interested in since 1983, when he had visited the computer science  department at Brown to show off the Macintosh, only to be told that it would  take a far more powerful machine to do anything useful in a university lab. The  dream of academic researchers was to have a workstation that was both powerful and  personal. As head of the Macintosh division, Jobs had launched a project to  build such a machine, which was dubbed the Big Mac. It would have a UNIX  operating system but with the friendly Macintosh interface. But after Jobs was  ousted from the Macintosh division, his replacement, Jean-Louis Gassée,  canceled the Big Mac.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯一直以来都在拜访学者，询问他们对计算机工作站的潜在需求。自1983年以来，他就开始对此产生兴趣。当时，他造访布朗大学计算机科学系，向他们展示麦金塔电脑，却被告知，在大学实验室里要比这强大得多的机器才能做出些有用的东西。学术研究人员的梦想是拥有一台强大的个人工作站。作为麦金塔部门的负责人，为了生产这种计算机，乔布斯推出了一个新项目。该项目被戏称为“大Mac”（BigMac）,将采用Unix操作系统和友好的麦金塔界面。但是1985年夏天乔布斯被逐出麦金塔部门后，他的继任者让-路易·加西便取消了这一项目。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>When that happened,  Jobs got a distressed call from Rich Page, who had been engineering the Big  Mac’s chip set. It was the latest in a series of conversations that Jobs was  having with disgruntled Apple employees urging him to start a new company and  rescue them. Plans to do so began to jell over Labor Day weekend, when Jobs  spoke to Bud Tribble, the original Macintosh software chief, and floated the  idea of starting a company to build a powerful but personal workstation. He  also enlisted two other Macintosh division employees who had been talking about  leaving, the engineer George Crow and the controller Susan Barnes.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>事情发生后，乔布斯接到了里奇·佩奇悲愤的控诉电话，佩奇之前一直在设计大Mac的芯片组。乔布斯被解除管理职务后，不满的苹果员工曾陆续找他谈话，力劝他创办一家新企业来拯救他们，佩奇正是其中之一。劳工节的周末，创办新公司的计划开始酝酿。乔布斯同原麦金塔软件主管巴德·特里布尔谈话，并说出了自己的想法——创建一家公司，专门生产强大的个人工作站。他还联系到其他两位麦金塔部门员工，工程师乔治·克罗（GeorgeCrow）和总监苏珊·巴恩斯，邀请他们加盟；这两人一直都在考虑辞职。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>That left one key  vacancy on the team: a person who could market the new product to universities.  The obvious candidate was Dan’l Lewin, who at Apple had organized a consortium  of universities to buy Macintosh computers in bulk. Besides missing two letters  in his first name, Lewin had the chiseled good looks of Clark Kent and a  Princetonian’s polish. He and Jobs shared a bond: Lewin had written a Princeton  thesis on Bob Dylan and charismatic leadership, and Jobs knew something about  both of those topics.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>新团队还有一个关键的职位空缺：一个可以向高校营销新产品的人。很明显，这一职位的合适人选是丹·卢因，他曾在索尼工作，乔布斯研究过那家公司的宣传手册。早在1980年乔布斯就聘请了卢因。卢因后来组织了一个高校联盟，向多家大学批量出售麦金塔电脑。丹·卢因的名字虽然比丹尼尔·卢因（DanielM.Lewin）①少了两个字母，但却拥有克拉克·肯特②般轮廓鲜明的外貌、普林斯顿式的优雅，以及大学游泳队明星成员的魅力。尽管背景不同，卢因和乔布斯却有着共同的兴趣：卢因的大学毕业论文对鲍勃·迪伦和魅力型领导力进行了研究，而乔布斯对这两个话题都有所了解。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Lewin’s university  consortium had been a godsend to the Macintosh group, but he had become  frustrated after Jobs left and Bill Campbell had reorganized marketing in a way  that reduced the role of direct sales to universities. He had been meaning to  call Jobs when, that Labor Day weekend, Jobs called first. He drove to Jobs’s  unfurnished mansion, and they walked the grounds while discussing the  possibility of creating a new company. Lewin was excited, but not ready to  commit. He was going to Austin with Campbell the following week, and he wanted  to wait until then to decide. Upon his return, he gave his answer: He was in.  The news came just in time for the September 13 Apple board meeting.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>卢因的高校联盟对麦金塔团队来说是个天赐良机。但是，乔布斯离开后，卢因很泄气，比尔·坎贝尔也将营销部门进行了重组，降低了高校直销的重要性。劳工节那个周末，卢因本打算给乔布斯打电话，结果乔布斯先打了过来。他驱车来到乔布斯的空旷豪宅，与他一边散步一边讨论创办新公司的可能性。卢因对此很兴奋，不过还没准备好作出任何承诺。之后一周，他要同比尔·坎贝尔前往奥斯汀，他想在那之后再作决定。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Although Jobs was  still nominally the board’s chairman, he had not been to any meetings since he  lost power. He called Sculley, said he was going to attend, and asked that an  item be added to the end of the agenda for a “chairman’s report.” He didn’t say  what it was about, and Sculley assumed it would be a criticism of the latest  reorganization. Instead, when his turn came to speak, Jobs described to the  board his plans to start a new company. “I’ve been thinking a lot, and it’s  time for me to get on with my life,” he began. “It’s obvious that I’ve got to  do something. I’m thirty years old.” Then he referred to some prepared notes to  describe his plan to create a computer for the higher education market. The new  company would not be competitive with Apple, he promised, and he would take  with him only a handful of non-key personnel. He offered to resign as chairman  of Apple, but he expressed hope that they could work together. Perhaps Apple  would want to buy the distribution rights to his product, he suggested, or  license Macintosh software to it.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>从奥斯汀回来后，卢因给出了自己的答案：他决定加入。这个消息来得正是时候——9月13日，苹果公司即将召开董事会会议。尽管乔布斯名义上仍然是该公司的董事长，但自从失去实权后，他就再没有参加过苹果公司的任何会议。他打电话给斯卡利，说自己要参加这一天的董事会会议，并要求在议程最后加上一项“董事长报告”。他没有告诉斯卡利自己要报告什么，斯卡利以为他会对最新的重组进行批评。相反，乔布斯在会议上描述了自己创办新公司的计划。“我想了很多，现在是时候继续我的生活了广他以此开始自己的发言，“很明显，我该做些什么了。我才30岁。”然后，他根据已经准备好的便笺，描述了自己的计划——为髙等教育市场开发一款计算机。他承诺，新公司不会同苹果公司存在竞争关系，并且只会带走少数非关键员工。他提出辞去苹果公司董事长一职，但希望仍能与苹果公司合作。乔布斯提议，也许苹果愿意购买其产品的经销权，或者授权新公司的产品使用麦金塔软件。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Mike Markkula rankled  at the possibility that Jobs would hire anyone from Apple. </p><p>“Why would you take  anyone at all?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Don’t get upset,”  Jobs assured him and the rest of the board. “These are very low-level people  that you won’t miss, and they will be leaving anyway.”</p>

<p>The board initially  seemed disposed to wish Jobs well in his venture. After a private discussion,  the directors even proposed that Apple take a 10% stake in the new company and  that Jobs remain on the board.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>对于乔布斯可能会聘请苹果员工，迈克·马库拉颇有微词。</p>
<p>“你凭什么带走任何一个人？”他质问乔布斯。</p>
<p>“别生气，”乔布斯向他保证，“我要带走的都是些级別很低的员工，你们不会想念他们的，况且，他们反正都要辞职了。”</p>
<p>董事会最初表示希望乔布斯的新公司能一切顺利。私下讨论后，董事们甚至提议，苹果公司可以向这家新公司注资，占据10%的股份，并且让乔布斯仍然留在苹果公司董事会。</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>That night Jobs and  his five renegades met again at his house for dinner. He was in favor of taking  the Apple investment, but the others convinced him it was unwise. They also  agreed that it would be best if they resigned all at once, right away. Then  they could make a clean break.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>当晚，乔布斯连同5名“反叛的海盗”又一次在他家见面吃晚饭。乔布斯愿意接受苹果公司的投资，但是在座的其他人认为这样做不明智，并说服了他。他们还一致认为，最好现在马上一起辞职，这样就能和苹果公司一刀两断了。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>So Jobs wrote a formal  letter telling Sculley the names of the five who would be leaving, signed it in  his spidery lowercase signature, and drove to Apple the next morning to hand it  to him before his 7:30 staff meeting.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>因此，乔布斯写了一封正式信函，告知斯卡利将要辞职的5位员工的姓名，并附上自己精巧的小写签名。第二天一早乔布斯就开车前往苹果公司，赶在7点半的员工会议之前将这封信交给了斯卡利。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>“Steve, these are not  low-level people,” Sculley said.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“史蒂夫，这些都不是低级别职员。”斯卡利读完信后说道。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>“Well, these people  were going to resign anyway,” Jobs replied. “They are going to be handing in  their resignations by nine this morning.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“好吧，但这些人早晚都会辞职，”乔布斯回答说，“他们会在今天上午9点之前递交辞职信。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>From Jobs’s  perspective, he had been honest. The five were not division managers or members  of Sculley’s top team. They had all felt diminished, in fact, by the company’s  new organization. But from Sculley’s perspective, these were important players;  Page was an Apple Fellow, and Lewin was a key to the higher education market.  In addition, they knew about the plans for Big Mac; even though it had been  shelved, this was still proprietary information. Nevertheless Sculley was  sanguine. Instead of pushing the point, he asked Jobs to remain on the board.  Jobs replied that he would think about it.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>从乔布斯的角度来看，自己是诚实的。这5位准备弃船的员工并非部门经理，也不是斯卡利髙层团队的成员。事实上，他们都觉得公司的重组削弱了自己的杈力。但在斯卡利看来，这些都是重要的员工：佩奇是苹果公司的资深员工，卢因是苹果在高等教育市场的关键人物。而且，他们知道大Mac计划，虽然该计划已被束之髙阁，但是这仍然属于专右信息。不过，斯卡利看上去很乐观，至少最开始是如此。他没有驳回这一提议，而是询问乔布斯是否会留在董事会。乔布斯表示自己会考虑一下。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>But when Sculley  walked into his 7:30 staff meeting and told his top lieutenants who was  leaving, there was an uproar. Most of them felt that Jobs had breached his  duties as chairman and displayed stunning disloyalty to the company. “We should  expose him for the fraud that he is so that people here stop regarding him as a  messiah,” Campbell shouted, according to Sculley.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>7点半，斯卡利走进会议室，吿诉自己的高级职员团队，公司里将有哪些人要离幵。会场一片哗然。大多数人认为，乔布斯违反了董事长的职责，并且对公司表现出惊人的不忠。据斯卡利回忆，坎贝尔当时大喊道：“我们应该曝光他的欺诈行为，这样苹果公司的人就不会继续把他当做救世主！”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Campbell admitted  that, although he later became a great Jobs defender and supportive board  member, he was ballistic that morning. “I was fucking furious, especially about  him taking Dan’l Lewin,” he recalled. “Dan’l had built the relationships with  the universities. He was always muttering about how hard it was to work with  Steve, and then he left.” Campbell was so angry that he walked out of the  meeting to call Lewin at home. When his wife said he was in the shower,  Campbell said, “I’ll wait.” A few minutes later, when she said he was still in  the shower, Campbell again said, “I’ll wait.” When Lewin finally came on the  phone, Campbell asked him if it was true. Lewin acknowledged it was. Campbell  hung up without saying another word.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>尽管坎贝尔后来成为了乔布斯真正的拥护者和董事会成员里的支持者，但他承认自己那天早上的确火药味儿十足。“我非常非常愤怒，尤其是他要带走丹·卢因，”坎贝尔说，“卢因已经同髙校建立了关系。他总在嘟囔和史蒂夫共事多么难，可现在却要走人。”事实上，坎贝尔气得走出会议室，往卢因家里打电话。卢因的妻子说他正在洗澡，坎贝尔就说：“我等着。”几分钟后，她说卢因还在洗。坎贝尔又说了一遍：“我等着。”卢因最后终于接了电话，坎贝尔问他乔布斯说的是不是真的。卢因承认是的，坎贝尔听了什么都没说，挂了电话。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>After hearing the fury  of his senior staff, Sculley surveyed the members of the board. They likewise  felt that Jobs had misled them with his pledge that he would not raid important  employees. Arthur Rock was especially angry. Even though he had sided with  Sculley during the Memorial Day showdown, he had been able to repair his  paternal relationship with Jobs. Just the week before, he had invited Jobs to  bring his girlfriend up to San Francisco so that he and his wife could meet  her, and the four had a nice dinner in Rock’s Pacific Heights home. Jobs had  not mentioned the new company he was forming, so Rock felt betrayed when he  heard about it from Sculley. “He came to the board and lied to us,” Rock  growled later. “He told us he was thinking of forming a company when in fact he  had already formed it. He said he was going to take a few middle-level people.  It turned out to be five senior people.” Markkula, in his subdued way, was also  offended. “He took some top executives he had secretly lined up before he left.  That’s not the way you do things. It was ungentlemanly.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>在感受到高级职员的偾怒后，斯卡利开始征询董事会的意见。他们同样认为，乔布斯曾向他们保证自己不会带走重要员工，如今看来，他误导了他们。亚瑟·罗克尤其感到气愤。虽然在美国阵亡将士纪念日的那次摊牌，罗克支持斯卡利，但是他已经修复了同乔布斯父子般的关系。就在一周前，他还邀请乔布斯带女友蒂娜·莱德斯到旧金山去，让自己和妻子见见她。四人在罗克位于太平洋髙地（PacificHeights）的家中吃了一顿愉快的晚餐，乔布斯当时并没有告诉他自己正在组建新公司。因此，从斯卡利口中得知这一消息时，罗克觉得自己遭到了背叛。“他来到董事会，向我们撒谎。”罗克后来怒吼道，“他跟我们说他正考虑组建一家公司，而事实上他已经组建好了。他说准备带走几个中层职员，结果却要带走五位资深人士。”马库拉的反应虽然较为平和，但也觉得愤怒。“他在走之前就偷愉笼络了一批高层管理人员，带走了他们。做事不能这样。这很下流。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Over the weekend both  the board and the executive staff convinced Sculley that Apple would have to  declare war on its cofounder. Markkula issued a formal statement accusing Jobs  of acting “in direct contradiction to his statements that he wouldn’t recruit  any key Apple personnel for his company.” He added ominously, “We are  evaluating what possible actions should be taken.” Campbell was quoted in the <em>Wall  Street Journal</em> as saying he “was stunned and shocked” by Jobs’s behavior.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>周末，董事会和髙级职员说服斯卡利，表示苹果公司将向它的联合创始人乔布斯宣战。马库拉发表了一份正式声明，指控乔布斯“直接违反了自己在董事会会议上的声明，他曾表示不会在自己的公司中聘用任何重要的苹果公司员工”。这份声明还表示，“我们正在权衡应该采取哪些可能的措施”。《华尔街日报》援引比尔·坎贝尔的说法，他对乔布斯的行为“感到震惊”。该报还引用了另一位不愿具名的董事的话：“在我进行过商业合作的企业中，从来没有见过人们如此愤怒。我们所有人都觉得他意图欺骗我们。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs had left his  meeting with Sculley thinking that things might proceed smoothly, so he had  kept quiet. But after reading the newspapers, he felt that he had to respond.  He phoned a few favored reporters and invited them to his home for private  briefings the next day. Then he called Andy Cunningham, who had handled his  publicity at Regis McKenna. “I went over to his unfurnished mansiony place in  Woodside,” she recalled, “and I found him huddled in the kitchen with his five  colleagues and a few reporters hanging outside on the lawn.” Jobs told her that  he was going to do a full-fledged press conference and started spewing some of  the derogatory things he was going to say. Cunningham was appalled. “This is  going to reflect badly on you,” she told him. Finally he backed down. He  decided that he would give the reporters a copy of the resignation letter and  limit any on-the-record comments to a few bland statements.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>同斯卡利会面后，乔布斯觉得事情可能会顺利进行，于是他一直保持沉默。但在读完《华尔街日报》的报道后，乔布斯觉得自己必须作出反应。他给自己偏爱的几位记者打了电话，邀请他们第二天来自己家，私下通报一下情况。然后他又打给安德烈嫌·坎宁安，叫她来帮忙，坎宁安曾处理过乔布斯的宣传事务。“我赶到他位于伍德赛德的空屋大宅，”她回忆说，“发现他和他的5个同事蜷缩在厨房里，而一些记者在外面的草坪上等着。”乔布斯告诉她说，自己准备开一个正式的新闻发布会，并把自己想说的一些贬损之辞统统告诉了她。坎宁安震惊了。“这会给你带来负面影响。”她告诉乔布斯。最后，他让步了，决定将辞职信副本发给记者，并且在公开场合只发表一些不痛不痒的评论。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs had considered  just mailing in his letter of resignation, but Susan Barnes convinced him that  this would be too contemptuous. Instead he drove it to Markkula’s house, where  he also found Al Eisenstat. There was a tense conversation for about fifteen  minutes; then Barnes, who had been waiting outside, came to the door to  retrieve him before he said anything he would regret. He left behind the  letter, which he had composed on a Macintosh and printed on the new  LaserWriter:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯觉得，辞职信寄到苹果公司就行了，但是苏珊·巴恩斯认为这样会显得太过傲慢，并劝服了他。于是，乔布斯驾车前往马库拉家递辞职信，发现苹果公司的法律总顾问阿尔·艾森斯塔特也在那儿。他们进行了15分钟的紧张谈话，在乔布斯还没来得及说出些令自己后悔的话前，巴恩斯就上门把他接走了。乔布斯留下了辞职信，这封信是在麦金塔电脑上写的，并通过新的激光打印机打印了出来：

<p>September 17, 1985</p>

<p>Dear Mike:</p>

<p>This morning’s papers  carried suggestions that Apple is considering removing me as Chairman. I don’t  know the source of these reports but they are both misleading to the public and  unfair to me.</p>

<p>You will recall that  at last Thursday’s Board meeting I stated I had decided to start a new venture  and I tendered my resignation as Chairman.</p>

<p>The Board declined to  accept my resignation and asked me to defer it for a week. I agreed to do so in  light of the encouragement the Board offered with regard to the proposed new  venture and the indications that Apple would invest in it. On Friday, after I told  John Sculley who would be joining me, he confirmed Apple’s willingness to  discuss areas of possible collaboration between Apple and my new venture.</p>

<p>Subsequently the  Company appears to be adopting a hostile posture toward me and the new venture.  Accordingly, I must insist upon the immediate acceptance of my resignation. . .  .</p>

<p>As you know, the  company’s recent reorganization left me with no work to do and no access even  to regular management reports. I am but 30 and want still to contribute and  achieve.</p>

<p>After what we have  accomplished together, I would wish our parting to be both amicable and  dignified.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely, steven p. jobs</p>

<p>亲爱的迈克：</p>
<p>今早的报纸报道，苹果公司正考虑撤去我的董事长职务。我不知道这些报道的消息来源，但是它们具有误导性，对我来说也不公平。</p>
<p>你应该记得，在上周四的董事会会议上，我表示，自己决定创办一家新公司，并且提出辞去董事长一职。</p>
<p>董事会拒绝了我的辞职请求，并要求我将此事推迟一周解决。鉴于董事会对于我成立新公司提议的鼓励，以及苹果公司表示将进行投资，我同意了这个要求。周五，我告诉约翰·斯卡利哪些人将加入我的新公司，他明确表示苹果公司愿意讨论彼此之间可能的合作领域。</p>

<p>随后，公司似乎对我及新公司采取了敌对姿态。因此，我必须坚持，请立即接受我的辞职请求……</p>

<p>正如你所知，公司近期的重组让我没有工作可做，甚至无法接触到定期的管理报告。我不过才30岁，希望自己仍然能够有所贡献和成就。</p>

<p>我们曾共同做出了一番成就，鉴于此，我希望我们的分离能够友好而不失尊严。</p>

<p>你真诚的，史蒂文·P·乔布斯</p>

  <p>When a guy from the  facilities team went to Jobs’s office to pack up his belongings, he saw a  picture frame on the floor. It contained a photograph of Jobs and Sculley in  warm conversation, with an inscription from seven months earlier: “Here’s to  Great Ideas, Great Experiences, and a Great Friendship! John.” The glass frame  was shattered. Jobs had hurled it across the room before leaving. From that  day, he never spoke to Sculley again.</p>

<p>当后勤部门的一个家伙去乔布斯办公室整理他的物品时，发现地上有一个相框。里面是一张照片，照片上乔布斯和斯卡利正在热烈交谈，下面的题词是7个月前写的——“致伟大的想法、伟大的经历，和一段伟大的友谊！约翰”。玻璃镜框已被摔碎。乔布斯在离开时把它扔到了地上。从那天起，他再没有跟斯卡利说过一句话。

<p>Apple’s stock went up  a full point, or almost 7%, when Jobs’s resignation was announced. “East Coast  stockholders always worried about California flakes running the company,”  explained the editor of a tech stock newsletter. “Now with both Wozniak and  Jobs out, those shareholders are relieved.” But Nolan Bushnell, the Atari  founder who had been an amused mentor ten years earlier, told <em>Time</em> that  Jobs would be badly missed. “Where is Apple’s inspiration going to come from?  Is Apple going to have all the romance of a new brand of Pepsi?”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>苹果公司宣布乔布斯辞职的消息后，其股价立刻上涨了1美元，涨幅接近7%。“东海岸的股东总是担心这些不靠谱的加利福尼亚人来经营公司,”一位科技股票通讯的编辑解释说，“现在，沃兹尼亚克和乔布斯都走了，这些股东都松了口气。”然而雅达利公司的创始人、10年前便成为乔布斯良师益友的诺兰·布什内尔对《时代》杂志表示，他们会非常想念乔布斯。“苹果的灵感将从哪里来？百事可乐味道的苹果还能有美妙的传奇吗？”

<div class="layout">

<p>After a few days of  failed efforts to reach a settlement with Jobs, Sculley and the Apple board  decided to sue him “for breaches of fiduciary obligations.” The suit spelled  out his alleged transgressions:</p>

<p>几天后，双方仍然未能达成一致，斯卡利和苹果公司董事会决定起诉乔布斯，称其“违背受托义务”。该诉讼清楚地列出了乔布斯被指控的罪状：

<p>At the time, Jobs  owned 6.5 million shares of Apple stock, 11% of the company, worth more than  $100 million. He began to sell his shares, and within five months had dumped  them all, retaining only one share so he could attend shareholder meetings if  he wanted. He was furious, and that was reflected in his passion to start what  was, no matter how he spun it, a rival company. “He was angry at Apple,” said  Joanna Hoffman, who briefly went to work for the new company. “Aiming at the educational  market, where Apple was strong, was simply Steve being vengeful. He was doing  it for revenge.”</p>

</div>
<div class="right">
<p>当时，乔布斯拥有650万股苹果股票，占该公司的11%,价值超过1亿美元。他立即开始卖出自己的股票。仅仅5个月，他就将所有的苹果股票都卖掉了，只留下了1股，这样如果自己愿意，就能参加股东会议。愤怒让乔布斯拼命想要创办一家苹果公司的——无论他如何以他的方式描述这个故事——竞争企业。“他对苹果很气愤。”加入新公司的乔安娜·霍夫曼表示。“苹果在教育市场已经很强，新公司针对该市场只是因为史蒂夫的报复心和愤懑。他这么做都是为了复仇。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Jobs, of course,  didn’t see it that way. “I haven’t got any sort of odd chip on my shoulder,” he  told <em>Newsweek.</em> Once again he invited his favorite reporters over to his  Woodside home, and this time he did not have Andy Cunningham there urging him  to be circumspect. He dismissed the allegation that he had improperly lured the  five colleagues from Apple. “These people all called me,” he told the gaggle of  journalists who were milling around in his unfurnished living room. “They were  thinking of leaving the company. Apple has a way of neglecting people.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>当然，乔布斯不这么认为。“我没有任何挑衅的意思。”他对《新闻周刊》说。乔布斯再次把自己最偏爱的记者邀请到伍德赛德的家中，这一次，他没有叫安迪·坎宁安过来劝自己保持谨慎。他驳斥了苹果公司的指控——不正当地从苹果公司引诱5名员工。“这些人都给我打过电话。”他告诉那些在他的空屋子里来回转悠的记者，“他们早就考虑离开苹果公司。苹果公司总能忽视人。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>He decided to  cooperate with a <em>Newsweek</em> cover in order to get his version of the story  out, and the interview he gave was revealing. “What I’m best at doing is  finding a group of talented people and making things with them,” he told the  magazine. He said that he would always harbor affection for Apple. “I’ll always  remember Apple like any man remembers the first woman he’s fallen in love  with.” But he was also willing to fight with its management if need be. “When  someone calls you a thief in public, you have to respond.” Apple’s threat to  sue him was outrageous. It was also sad. It showed that Apple was no longer a  confident, rebellious company. “It’s hard to think that a $2 billion company  with 4,300 employees couldn’t compete with six people in blue jeans.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>他决定与《新闻周刊》合作一篇封面报道，说出自己的故事。他在这次采访中真情流露。“我最擅长的就是发现一批天才，然后和他们一起创造东西。”他告诉《新闻周刊》说。他表示，自己对苹果会永远怀有感情。“我会永远记得苹果，就像所有男人都会记得自己爱上的第一个女人那样。”但是，如果有必要，他也愿意反抗苹果公司的管理层。“如果有人公开说你是贼，那你就得作出回应。”苹果公司威胁控告乔布斯及其同事的行为太过分，也令人伤心。这表明，苹果不再是一家自信、叛逆的公司。“很难想象，一个市值20亿美元、拥有4300名员工的公司，会竞争不过6个穿牛仔裤的人。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>To try to counter  Jobs’s spin, Sculley called Wozniak and urged him to speak out. “Steve can be  an insulting and hurtful guy,” he told <em>Time</em> that week. He revealed that  Jobs had asked him to join his new firm—it would have been a sly way to land  another blow against Apple’s current management—but he wanted no part of such  games and had not returned Jobs’s phone call. To the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>,  he recounted how Jobs had blocked frogdesign from working on his remote control  under the pretense that it might compete with Apple products. “I look forward  to a great product and I wish him success, but his integrity I cannot trust,”  Wozniak said.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

为了反击乔布斯，斯卡利找到沃兹尼亚克，劝他站出来说话。沃兹尼亚克从来没有控制欲和报复心，但是他也从不犹豫诚实地谈论自己的感受。“史蒂夫是一个会侮辱人、伤害人的家伙。”他的话登上了那一周的《时代》杂志。他透露，乔布斯曾打过电话找他，要他加入自己的新公司——这本来是狡猾的一招，用以进一步打击苹果公司当前的管理层——但是沃兹尼亚克表示，自己不想成为这种游戏的一部分，他也没有回复乔布斯的电话。根据《旧金山纪事报》（FranciscoChronicle）的报道，沃兹尼亚克讲述了乔布斯曾经以可能会与苹果产品造成竞争为幌子，阻止青蛙设计公司参与他的远程遥控器项目。“我期待他们能做出伟大的产品，我也祝愿他成功，但是我不信任他的人品。”沃兹尼亚克告诉这家报纸——

<div class="left"><h3><a name="s2"></a>To Be on Your Own</h3>
<p>“The best thing ever  to happen to Steve is when we fired him, told him to get lost,” Arthur Rock  later said. The theory, shared by many, is that the tough love made him wiser  and more mature. But it’s not that simple. At the company he founded after  being ousted from Apple, Jobs was able to indulge all of his instincts, both  good and bad. He was unbound. The result was a series of spectacular products  that were dazzling market flops. <em>This</em> was the true learning experience.  What prepared him for the great success he would have in Act III was not his  ouster from his Act I at Apple but his brilliant failures in Act II.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<h3>靠自己</h3>
<p>“对于史蒂夫来说，最好的事情就是我们解雇了他，叫他滚蛋。”亚瑟·罗克之后说道。许多人也认为，这种严厉的爱让乔布斯更明智，更成熟。但事情并非如此简单。离开苹果后，在自己创建的新公司里，乔布斯能够释放自己的所有天性，无论好坏。他自由了。结果是一系列炫目的产品，但都遭遇了市场失败的重挫。这才是真正的学习经验。他后来的巨大成功，并非因为在苹果的下台，而是下台后华丽的失败。</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The first instinct  that he indulged was his passion for design. The name he chose for his new  company was rather straightforward: Next. In order to make it more distinctive,  he decided he needed a world-class logo. So he courted the dean of corporate  logos, Paul Rand. At seventy-one, the Brooklyn-born graphic designer had  already created some of the best-known logos in business, including those of <em>Esquire</em>,  IBM, Westinghouse, ABC, and UPS. He was under contract to IBM, and his  supervisors there said that it would obviously be a conflict for him to create  a logo for another computer company. So Jobs picked up the phone and called  IBM’s CEO, John Akers. Akers was out of town, but Jobs was so persistent that  he was finally put through to Vice Chairman Paul Rizzo. After two days, Rizzo  concluded that it was futile to resist Jobs, and he gave permission for Rand to  do the work.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>他得以放纵的第一个天性便是对设计的热情。他为新公司选择的名称相当简单：Next。为了让其更加与众不同，乔布斯决定，需要设计一个世界级的标识。于是，他设法找到企业标识大师保罗·兰德（PaulRand）。当时，这位出生于布鲁克林的平面设计师已经71岁，他曾设计出商界最知名的一些标识，包括《君子》杂志、IBM、西屋电器、美国广播公司以及联合包裹服务公司（UPS）。兰德当时已与IBM签订了合作协议，IBM公司的管理者表示，兰德为另一家计算机公司设计标识显然会造成冲突。于是，乔布斯拿起电话打给IBM的CEO约翰·埃克斯（JohnAkers）。埃克斯当时不在，乔布斯非常执著，最后联系到了的副董事长保罗·里佐（PaulRizzo）。两天后，里佐发现要拒绝乔布斯简直就是不可能的，于是，许可了兰德为这家新公司设计标识。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Rand flew out to Palo  Alto and spent time walking with Jobs and listening to his vision. The computer  would be a cube, Jobs pronounced. He loved that shape. It was perfect and  simple. So Rand decided that the logo should be a cube as well, one that was  tilted at a 28° angle. When Jobs asked for a number of options to consider,  Rand declared that he did not create different <em>options</em> for clients. “I  will solve your problem, and you will pay me,” he told Jobs. “You can use what  I produce, or not, but I will not do options, and either way you will pay me.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>兰德飞到了帕洛奥图，同乔布斯一同走了走，听取了他的构想。乔布斯说，计算机将是一个立方体。他喜欢这种形状，完美而简单。因此，兰德决定将标识也做成立方体效果，并且倾斜28度，活泼漂亮。乔布斯询问兰德能否做出几个备选方案来供自己考虑。兰德表示，自己从不为客户做不同的备选方案。“我解决你的问题，你付钱给我。”他告诉乔布斯，“我设计出来的东西你用也行，不用也罢，都得付钱给我，但是我不做备选。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs admired that kind  of thinking, so he made what was quite a gamble. The company would pay an  astonishing $100,000 flat fee to get <em>one</em> design. “There was a clarity in  our relationship,” Jobs said. “He had a purity as an artist, but he was astute  at solving business problems. He had a tough exterior, and had perfected the  image of a curmudgeon, but he was a teddy bear inside.” It was one of Jobs’s  highest praises: purity as an artist.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯很钦佩这种想法。他对此也有同感。于是，乔布斯作出了赌博般的决定——以10万美元的费用，让兰德为新公司设计一个标识。“我们的关系非常清楚，”乔布斯说，“他具有艺术家的纯粹品质，但精于解决商业问题。他外表强硬，像个倔老头，但是内心就和泰迪熊一样。”这是乔布斯所给予过的最高评价之一：艺术家的纯粹品质。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>It took Rand just two  weeks. He flew back to deliver the result to Jobs at his Woodside house. First  they had dinner, then Rand handed him an elegant and vibrant booklet that  described his thought process. On the final spread, Rand presented the logo he  had chosen. “In its design, color arrangement, and orientation, the logo is a study  in contrasts,” his booklet proclaimed. “Tipped at a jaunty angle, it brims with  the informality, friendliness, and spontaneity of a Christmas seal and the  authority of a rubber stamp.” The word “next” was split into two lines to fill  the square face of the cube, with only the “e” in lowercase. That letter stood  out, Rand’s booklet explained, to connote “education, excellence... E=MC<sup>2</sup>.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>兰德只用了短短两周就完成了工作。他再次飞到帕洛奥图，来到乔布斯在伍德赛德的家中，送上了设计结果。他们先是共进晚餐，然后，兰德递给乔布斯一个雅致而颜色鮮艳的小册子，里面描述了自己的构思过程。册子的最后一页，兰德呈现了自己选择的标识。“从设计、色彩搭配和定位来看，这个标识就是对比的杰作，”他的小册子中写道，“倾斜角度活泼漂亮，它充满了随和、友善、圣诞贴纸般的自然，以及椽皮图章式的权威感。”“Next”这个词被分成了两行，填补了立方体的立面，只有“e”是小写，从整个词中脱颖而出，兰德的小册子将“e”解释为“教育，卓越……E=MC<sup>2</sup>”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>It was often hard to  predict how Jobs would react to a presentation. He could label it shitty or  brilliant; one never knew which way he might go. But with a legendary designer  such as Rand, the chances were that Jobs would embrace the proposal. He stared  at the final spread, looked up at Rand, and then hugged him. They had one minor  disagreement: Rand had used a dark yellow for the “e” in the logo, and Jobs  wanted him to change it to a brighter and more traditional yellow. Rand banged  his fist on the table and declared, “I’ve been doing this for fifty years, and  I know what I’m doing.” Jobs relented.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>有时很难预测乔布斯对于某个东西的反应。他可能会认为它很低劣，也可能觉得它很杰出，但你绝对猜不到他会是哪一种反应。但是面对兰德这样的传奇设计师，乔布斯很有可能接受他的创意。乔布斯盯着最后一页，抬头看了看兰德，拥抱了他。不过，他们有一个小分歧：兰德在字母“e”上使用了暗黄色，而乔布斯希望能改成更为明亮和传统的黄色。兰德用拳头猛击桌子，说：“我做这行已经50年了，我知道自己在做什么。”乔布斯妥协了。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The company had not  only a new logo, but a new name. No longer was it Next. It was NeXT. Others  might not have understood the need to obsess over a logo, much less pay  $100,000 for one. But for Jobs it meant that NeXT was starting life with a  world-class feel and identity, even if it hadn’t yet designed its first  product. As Markkula had taught him, a great company must be able to impute its  values from the first impression it makes.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>公司现在不仅有了新的标识，还有了个新名字。它不再叫Next，而变成了NeXT。其他人也许还不明白重视标识的必要，更不会为了一个标识花上10万美元。但对于乔布斯来说，一个好的标识意味着NeXT正在以世界级的感觉和身份起步，尽管它还没有设计出自己的第一款产品。马库拉曾教过他，你可以根据封面去评价一本书，而一家伟大的公司必须从给人的第一印象就映射出自己的价值观。从这一点来看，这个标识简直酷毙了。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>As a bonus, Rand  agreed to design a personal calling card for Jobs. He came up with a colorful  type treatment, which Jobs liked, but they ended up having a lengthy and heated  disagreement about the placement of the period after the “P” in Steven P. Jobs.  Rand had placed the period to the right of the “P.”, as it would appear if set  in lead type. Steve preferred the period to be nudged to the left, under the  curve of the “P.”, as is possible with digital typography. “It was a fairly  large argument about something relatively small,” Susan Kare recalled. On this  one Jobs prevailed.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>作为免费赠品，兰德同意为乔布斯设计个人名片。兰德想出了一个颜色丰富的解决方案，乔布斯很喜欢；但是在“SteveP.Jobs”这个名字中字母P后面的缩写符位置问题上，两人产生了长久而激烈的分歧。兰德想把缩写符的位置靠右放一点儿，这样用铅字印刷的时候，这个符号就会比较清晰。史蒂夫比较喜欢缩写符离P更近一点儿，就放在“P”的曲线下，比较适合数字排版。“就这样，一件小事情引发了非常大的争论。”苏珊·卡雷回忆道。这一次，乔布斯占了上风。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>In order to translate  the NeXT logo into the look of real products, Jobs needed an industrial  designer he trusted. He talked to a few possibilities, but none of them  impressed him as much as the wild Bavarian he had imported to Apple: Hartmut  Esslinger, whose frogdesign had set up shop in Silicon Valley and who, thanks  to Jobs, had a lucrative contract with Apple. Getting IBM to permit Paul Rand  to do work for NeXT was a small miracle willed into existence by Jobs’s belief  that reality can be distorted. But that was a snap compared to the likelihood  that he could convince Apple to permit Esslinger to work for NeXT.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>为了将NeXT标识完全体现在真实的产品中，乔布斯需要一位值得信任的工业设计师。他和几位可能的人选谈了谈，但是没有人比他推荐给苹果公司的巴伐利亚狂人哈特穆特·艾斯林格更合适。艾斯林格的青蛙设计公司在眭谷设有工作室，由于乔布斯的缘故，斯林格和苹果公司签订了合同，收入颇丰。说服IBM公司允许保罗·兰德为自己设计NeXT标识，是乔布斯相信现实能被意志扭曲的一次小小奇迹。然而，与接下来说服苹果允许艾斯林格为NeXT工作相比，这要算是很容易的事情了。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>This did not keep Jobs  from trying. At the beginning of November 1985, just five weeks after Apple  filed suit against him, Jobs wrote to Eisenstat and asked for a dispensation.  “I spoke with Hartmut Esslinger this weekend and he suggested I write you a  note expressing why I wish to work with him and frogdesign on the new products  for NeXT,” he said. Astonishingly, Jobs’s argument was that he did not know  what Apple had in the works, but Esslinger did. “NeXT has no knowledge as to  the current or future directions of Apple’s product designs, nor do other  design firms we might deal with, so it is possible to inadvertently design  similar looking products. It is in both Apple’s and NeXT’s best interest to  rely on Hartmut’s professionalism to make sure this does not occur.” Eisenstat  recalled being flabbergasted by Jobs’s audacity, and he replied curtly. “I have  previously expressed my concern on behalf of Apple that you are engaged in a  business course which involves your utilization of Apple’s confidential  business information,” he wrote. “Your letter does not alleviate my concern in  any way. In fact it heightens my concern because it states that you have ‘no  knowledge as to the current or future directions of Apple’s product designs,’ a  statement which is not true.” What made the request all the more astonishing to  Eisenstat was that it was Jobs who, just a year earlier, had forced frogdesign  to abandon its work on Wozniak’s remote control device.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>但这并没有阻止乔布斯去尝试。1985年11月初，苹果对乔布斯提起诉讼5周后，乔布斯就写信给艾森斯塔特（苹果公司法律总顾问，诉讼由他发起），要求取消诉讼。“我这周同哈特穆特·艾斯林格聊过，他建议我给你写一封信，表达我想同他及青眭设计公司合作NeXT新产品的原因。”乔布斯写道。令人惊讶是，乔布斯的说法是，他自己不知道苹果公司正在做的东西，但是艾斯林格知道。“NeXT对于苹果公司产品设计现在和未来的方向都一无所知。如果我们和其他那些同样对苹果不了解的设计公司合作的话，那就有可能会不经意地设计出外观类似的产品。而哈特穆特他们了解苹果，能够确保不会让设计与苹果的产品类似，因此这对苹果公司和NeXT公司都最有利。”艾森斯塔特回忆，自己为乔布斯的厚颜无耻瞠目结舌，他对此作出了简短的回复。“我曾代表苹果公司表达过担忧，你所从事的业务会利用苹果公司的机密商业信息。”他写道，“你的信函无论如何无法减轻我的忧虑。事实上，它加深了我的担忧，因为你在信中表示自己‘对苹果公司产品设计现在和未来的方向一无所知’，而这一说法并非事实。”更令艾森斯塔特惊讶的地方在于，就在一年前，乔布斯本人就曾强迫青蛙设计公司放弃沃兹尼亚克遥控装置的项目。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs realized that in  order to work with Esslinger (and for a variety of other reasons), it would be  necessary to resolve the lawsuit that Apple had filed. Fortunately Sculley was  willing. In January 1986 they reached an out-of-court agreement involving no  financial damages. In return for Apple’s dropping its suit, NeXT agreed to a  variety of restrictions: Its product would be marketed as a high-end  workstation, it would be sold directly to colleges and universities, and it would  not ship before March 1987. Apple also insisted that the NeXT machine “not use  an operating system compatible with the Macintosh,” though it could be argued  that Apple would have been better served by insisting on just the opposite.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯意识到，为了同艾斯林格合作（以及各种其他原因），必须解决苹果公司的诉讼。幸运的是，斯卡利愿意考虑撤销诉讼。1986年1月，他们达成庭外和解，不涉及经济损失。为了回报苹果公司放弃诉讼，NeXT公司同意了种种限制条款：其产品将作为髙端智能终端直接销售给髙校，而且NeXT公司不能在1987年3月之前推出产品。苹果公司还坚持，NeXT的机器“不能使用与麦金塔兼容的操作系统”。后来的情况表明，如果当时苹果公司的要求刚好相反，会对自身更为有利。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>After the settlement Jobs  continued to court Esslinger until the designer decided to wind down his  contract with Apple. That allowed frogdesign to work with NeXT at the end of  1986. Esslinger insisted on having free rein, just as Paul Rand had. “Sometimes  you have to use a big stick with Steve,” he said. Like Rand, Esslinger was an  artist, so Jobs was willing to grant him indulgences he denied other mortals.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>诉讼解决后，乔布斯继续游说艾斯林格，直到这位设计师决定终止与苹果公司的合同。1986年底，青蛙设计公司终于能够同NeXT合作了。艾斯林格坚持完全的自由，就像保罗·兰德一样。“有时候，你必须对史蒂夫采用大棒政策。”他表示。和兰德一样，艾斯林格是一位艺术家，所以乔布斯也愿意放任他自由设计，其他人可享受不到这种待遇。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs decreed that the  computer should be an absolutely perfect cube, with each side exactly a foot  long and every angle precisely 90 degrees. He liked cubes. They had gravitas  but also the slight whiff of a toy. But the NeXT cube was a Jobsian example of  design desires trumping engineering considerations. The circuit boards, which  fitted nicely into the traditional pizza-box shape, had to be reconfigured and  stacked in order to nestle into a cube.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯规定，计算机必须是绝对完美的立方体，每条边都正好一英尺长，每个角都是90度。他喜欢立方体，它们庄严但也有玩具的感觉。但是，NeXT立方体是乔布斯式功能适应形式的例子，而非形式顺应功能的设计，后者是包豪斯设计理念及其他功能设计师所强调的。本来电路板能够很好地契合传统的比萨饼盒的形状，但在NeXT电脑这里，为了适应立方体的结构，电路板必须重新配置和安装。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Even worse, the  perfection of the cube made it hard to manufacture. Most parts that are cast in  molds have angles that are slightly greater than pure 90 degrees, so that it’s  easier to get them out of the mold (just as it is easier to get a cake out of a  pan that has angles slightly greater than 90 degrees). But Esslinger dictated,  and Jobs enthusiastically agreed, that there would be no such “draft angles”  that would ruin the purity and perfection of the cube. So the sides had to be  produced separately, using molds that cost $650,000, at a specialty machine  shop in Chicago. Jobs’s passion for perfection was out of control. When he  noticed a tiny line in the chassis caused by the molds, something that any  other computer maker would accept as unavoidable, he flew to Chicago and  convinced the die caster to start over and do it perfectly. “Not a lot of die  casters expect a celebrity to fly in,” noted one of the engineers. Jobs also  had the company buy a $150,000 sanding machine to remove all lines where the  mold faces met and insisted that the magnesium case be a matte black, which  made it more susceptible to showing blemishes.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>更糟的是，完美的立方体生产起来也很困难。大部分模具铸造出来的零件都不是纯直角，而是会稍微超过90度，因为这样会比较容易把零件从模具中拿出来。（就像平底锅锅沿的角度稍微超过90度，煎饼会比较容易拿出来一样。）但是，艾斯林格下令，不能有这种拔模角度，不能破坏立方体的纯粹和完美。乔布斯对此表示狂热支持。因此，每一面都必须分开制作，使用价格65万美元的模具，在芝加哥的一家专业机器加工厂制作。乔布斯对于完美的热情已然失控。当他注意到模具在机箱底盘上留下的微小细纹时，他就会飞到芝加哥，说服铸模工人重铸，直到完美。而这种微小瑕疵是其他任何计算机制造商都能接受的。“大部分铸模工人都想不到会有名人专程飞来找自己。”NeXT项目的一位工程师戴维·凯利（DavidKelley）指出。乔布斯还让这家公司购买了一台价值15万美元的砂光机，用来去除模具面相交处的所有细纹。乔布斯坚持镁合金外壳应该是亚光黑色，而这样，如果有瑕疵就会更明显。
</p>
</div></div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

</div>
<div class="right">
<p>凯利还得设法做出曲线优美的显示器支架，乔布斯坚持要让显示器有俯仰角度调整功能，这使得这项任务难上加难。“你会想要发出理智的声音。”凯利告诉《商业周刊》，“但是当你跟他说‘史蒂夫，这样做太贵了’或者‘不可能做得到’时，他就会说：‘你真够没劲的。’他会让你觉得自己是个思想狭隘的人。”因此，凯利及其团队日夜奋战，想尽办法将每一个美学奇想变成可行的产品。一位前来应聘营销部门职位的应聘者看到乔布斯掀开罩在机器上的盖布，露出有优美线条的显示器支架，上面放了个煤渣砖一样的东西，以后显示器将会放在这个上面。在这位造访者百思不得其解的注视下，乔布斯激动地把俯仰角度调整的功能演示了一遍，他已经以个人申请了这项专利。
</p>
</div></div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs had always  indulged his obsession that the unseen parts of a product should be crafted as  beautifully as its facade, just as his father had taught him when they were  building a fence. This too he took to extremes when he found himself unfettered  at NeXT. He made sure that the screws inside the machine had expensive plating.  He even insisted that the matte black finish be coated onto the inside of the  cube’s case, even though only repairmen would see it.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯一直认为，产品看不见的地方也应该和露在外面的部分一样精美，就像他的父亲会用一块上好木材做衣柜的背面一样。当他发现自己在NeXT可以不受约束时，就任由自己在这方面走向极端。乔布斯要求机器内部的螺丝一定要有昂贵的镀层，甚至坚持把立方体的内部也涂成亚光黑色，即便只有维修人员才能看得到。

<p>Joe Nocera, then  writing for <em>Esquire</em>, captured Jobs’s intensity at a NeXT staff meeting:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔·诺切拉（JoeNocera）当时为《君子》杂志写稿，记述了乔布斯在NeXT员工会议上前强烈表现：
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>It’s not quite right  to say that he is sitting through this staff meeting, because Jobs doesn’t sit  through much of anything; one of the ways he dominates is through sheer  movement. One moment he’s kneeling in his chair; the next minute he’s slouching  in it; the next he has leaped out of his chair entirely and is scribbling on  the blackboard directly behind him. He is full of mannerisms. He bites his  nails. He stares with unnerving earnestness at whoever is speaking. His hands,  which are slightly and inexplicably yellow, are in constant motion.</p>


</div>
<div class="right">
<p>如果说他坐着开完了员工会议，就不太准确，因为乔布斯从来没有耐着性子坐到会议结束。他控制局面的途径之一就是不断地动来动去。这一刻他还跪在自己的椅子上，下一分钟就懒散地窝在椅子里，过了一会儿又干脆跳出椅子，开始在身后的黑板上乱涂乱画。他有很多怪癖，包括咬指甲，还有用他那令人胆怯的认真劲儿盯着说话的人。他的手有些莫名的发黄，不断在动。
</p>
</div></div>
<div class="layout">

  <p>What particularly  struck Nocera was Jobs’s “almost willful lack of tact.” It was more than just  an inability to hide his opinions when others said something he thought dumb;  it was a conscious readiness, even a perverse eagerness, to put people down,  humiliate them, show he was smarter. When Dan’l Lewin handed out an  organization chart, for example, Jobs rolled his eyes. “These charts are  bullshit,” he interjected. Yet his moods still swung wildly, as at Apple. A  finance person came into the meeting and Jobs lavished praise on him for a  “really, really great job on this”; the previous day Jobs had told him, “This  deal is crap.”</p>

<p>最让诺切拉震惊的是乔布斯的“几乎故意的人际交往技巧缺乏”。当别人说出乔布斯认为愚蠢的意见时，他似乎早有准备，急迫地想要贬低、羞辱他人，以显示自己更聪明。例如，当丹·卢因拿出一份组织结构图时，乔布斯转了转眼珠。“这些东西狗屁不是。”他最终插话道。不过，他的情绪仍然喜怒无常，就像在苹果公司时一样，一会儿把人捧成英雄，过一会儿又把人贬成混蛋。一位财务人员来到会议室，乔布斯慷慨地称赞他“在这个项目上的工作非常非常出色”；但是前一天，乔布斯才对他说过：“这笔交易跟垃圾没什么两样。”

<p>One of NeXT’s first  ten employees was an interior designer for the company’s first headquarters, in  Palo Alto. Even though Jobs had leased a building that was new and nicely  designed, he had it completely gutted and rebuilt. Walls were replaced by  glass, the carpets were replaced by light hardwood flooring. The process was  repeated when NeXT moved to a bigger space in Redwood City in 1989. Even though  the building was brand-new, Jobs insisted that the elevators be moved so that  the entrance lobby would be more dramatic. As a centerpiece, Jobs commissioned  I. M. Pei to design a grand staircase that seemed to float in the air. The  contractor said it couldn’t be built. Jobs said it could, and it was. Years  later Jobs would make such staircases a feature at Apple’s signature stores.</p>

<div class="right">
<p>NeXT最初的十名员工中，就有一位是室内设计师，负责帕洛奧图总部的设计，这是NeXT公司的第一个总部。虽然乔布斯租下的大楼是新建的，设计也漂亮，但他将内部设施全部拆毁重建。墙壁换成了玻璃，地毯换成了浅色的硬木地板。1989年，NeXT公司搬到雷德伍德一个更大的地方时，这一过程再次上演。尽管大楼是全新的，但是乔布斯坚持要将电梯挪走，让大堂显得更为恢弘。在大堂的中心，乔布斯委托贝聿铭设计了一段宏伟的楼梯，看上去就像飘浮在空中一样。承建商表示这个设计没法实现，乔布斯坚持能够做到，最终也确实建成了。多年后，乔布斯把这款楼梯变成了苹果专卖店的特色。

<div class="left"><h3><a name="s3"></a>The Computer</h3>
<p>During the early  months of NeXT, Jobs and Dan’l Lewin went on the road, often accompanied by a  few colleagues, to visit campuses and solicit opinions. At Harvard they met  with Mitch Kapor, the chairman of Lotus software, over dinner at Harvest  restaurant. When Kapor began slathering butter on his bread, Jobs asked him,  “Have you ever heard of serum cholesterol?” Kapor responded, “I’ll make you a  deal. You stay away from commenting on my dietary habits, and I will stay away  from the subject of your personality.” It was meant humorously, but as Kapor  later commented, “Human relationships were not his strong suit.” Lotus agreed  to write a spreadsheet program for the NeXT operating system.</p>

<h3>NeXT计算机</h3>
<p>NeXT公司成立的最初几个月，乔布斯和丹·卢因四处奔波，常常和其他一些同事一起走访校园，征求意见。在哈佛大学，他们遇见了正在Harvest餐厅就餐的莲花软件公司董事长米切尔·卡普尔。卡普尔正往面包上涂黄油，乔布斯看着他问道：“你听说过血清胆固醇吗？”卡普尔回答说：“我们来作个交易，你别评论我的饮食习惯，我也不谈论你的性格。”这是卡普尔的小幽默，莲花公司同意为NeXT操作系统编写电子表格程序，但是正如卡普尔后来评论的那样：“人际关系不是他的长项。”</p>

<p>Jobs wanted to bundle  useful content with the machine, so Michael Hawley, one of the engineers,  developed a digital dictionary. He learned that a friend of his at Oxford  University Press had been involved in the typesetting of a new edition of  Shakespeare’s works. That meant that there was probably a computer tape he  could get his hands on and, if so, incorporate it into the NeXT’s memory. “So I  called up Steve, and he said that would be awesome, and we flew over to Oxford  together.” On a beautiful spring day in 1986, they met in the publishing  house’s grand building in the heart of Oxford, where Jobs made an offer of  $2,000 plus 74 cents for every computer sold in order to have the rights to  Oxford’s edition of Shakespeare. “It will be all gravy to you,” he argued. “You  will be ahead of the parade. It’s never been done before.” They agreed in  principle and then went out to play skittles over beer at a nearby pub where  Lord Byron used to drink. By the time it launched, the NeXT would also include  a dictionary, a thesaurus, and the <em>Oxford Dictionary of Quotations</em>,  making it one of the pioneers of the concept of searchable electronic books.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯想要在机器中预装出色的内容，于是工程师迈克尔·霍利（MichaelHawley）开发了一部电子词典。一天，他买了新版的莎士比亚作品集，翻阅时发现自己有位朋友在牛津大学出版社并参与了这本书的卩版。这意味着，霍利或许可以拿到他们的排版，而且如果对方同意，就能把这本书存入NeXT。“于是，我打电话给史蒂夫。他说这主意很棒，我们就一起飞到牛津。”在1986年春天的一个美丽的日子，他们在牛津郡中心的出版社大楼见面，乔布斯提出，一次性支付2000美元且每卖出一台电脑支付给出版社74美分，以获得牛津版莎士比亚作品集的版权。“这对你们而言就是轻而易举的收入，”乔布斯表示，“你们将走在潮流的前列，这是别人从来没有做过的事情。”出版社大体上同意了，然后他们一同前往拜伦曾经驻足的小酒馆，喝啤酒玩撞柱游戏。NeXT电脑还将囊括一部字典、一部百科汇编和一部《牛津引语词典》，这使得NeXT电脑成为实现可搜索式电子书概念的先驱之一。

<p>Instead of using  off-the-shelf chips for the NeXT, Jobs had his engineers design custom ones that  integrated a variety of functions on one chip. That would have been hard  enough, but Jobs made it almost impossible by continually revising the  functions he wanted it to do. After a year it became clear that this would be a  major source of delay.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>NeXT电脑没有使用现成的芯片，乔布斯让工程师们设计定制芯片，能够在一个芯片上集成多种功能。这已经够困难的了，而乔布斯还在不断修改他想要的功能，这就使得这项工作几乎不可能完成。一年后，这成了产品延迟发布的一个主要原因。

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>He also insisted on  building his own fully automated and futuristic factory, just as he had for the  Macintosh; he had not been chastened by that experience. This time too he made  the same mistakes, only more excessively. Machines and robots were painted and repainted  as he compulsively revised his color scheme. The walls were museum white, as  they had been at the Macintosh factory, and there were $20,000 black leather  chairs and a custom-made staircase, just as in the corporate headquarters. He  insisted that the machinery on the 165-foot assembly line be configured to move  the circuit boards from right to left as they got built, so that the process  would look better to visitors who watched from the viewing gallery. Empty  circuit boards were fed in at one end and twenty minutes later, untouched by  humans, came out the other end as completed boards. The process followed the  Japanese principle known as <em>kanban</em>, in which each machine performs its  task only when the next machine is ready to receive another part.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯还坚持建设自己的全自动化和未来派的工厂，就像他曾经对麦金塔项目的设想一样。他并未从那次经历中学乖。这次，他犯了同样的错误，而且有过之而无不及。由于他强迫症似的不断修改配色方案，机器和机器人被喷涂了一遍又一遍。墙壁是博物馆式的纯白色，就和麦金塔工厂一样，工厂里还摆放着价值2万美元的黑色皮座椅，修造了一截定制的楼梯，就和NeXT公司总部一样。乔布斯坚持重新配置总长165英尺的装配线上的所有机器，从而在生产时，可以让电路板从右向左移动，这样在有人来参观时，站在观景台上就会看到更漂亮的生产流程。原始电路板从装配线的一端进入，20分钟后，做好的电路板再从另一端出来，完全无需人工接触。这种流程是学习了日本的“看板管理”（Kanban），只有当负责下一个流程的机器能够处理另一个零件时，负责上一个流程的机器才会开始执行自己的任务。

<div class="left">
<p>Jobs had not tempered  his way of dealing with employees. “He applied charm or public humiliation in a  way that in most cases proved to be pretty effective,” Tribble recalled. But  sometimes it wasn’t. One engineer, David Paulsen, put in ninety-hour weeks for  the first ten months at NeXT. He quit when “Steve walked in one Friday  afternoon and told us how unimpressed he was with what we were doing.” When <em>Business  Week</em> asked him why he treated employees so harshly, Jobs said it made the  company better. “Part of my responsibility is to be a yardstick of quality.  Some people aren’t used to an environment where excellence is expected.” But he  still had his spirit and charisma. There were plenty of field trips, visits by  akido masters, and off-site retreats. And he still exuded the pirate flag  spunkiness. When Apple fired Chiat/Day, the ad firm that had done the “1984” ad and taken out the newspaper ad  saying “Welcome IBM—seriously,” Jobs took out a full-page ad in the <em>Wall  Street Journal</em> proclaiming, “Congratulations Chiat/Day—Seriously . . .  Because I can guarantee you: there is life after Apple.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯没有缓和自己对待员工的苛刻方式。“他对施展魅力和公开羞辱这两种方式的运用，在大多数情况下非常奏效。”特里布尔回忆道。但有时候也不尽然。工程师戴维·保尔森（DavidPaulsen）在NeXT工作的头10个月里，每周工作90个小时。之后，他辞职不干了，他回忆说，“一个周五下午，乔布斯走进来，跟我们说，他对我们所正在做的东西非常之不屑一顾。”《新闻周刊》采访乔布斯，问他为什么要对员工如此严厉，乔布斯说，这样才会使公司更好。“我的一部分责任就是衡量质量。有些人不习惯那种追求卓越的环境。”另一方面，他仍然保持着自己的精神和领袖魅力。乔布斯组织了大量的实地考察以及外出集思会，还经常请合气道大师来公司参观。他仍然表现出英勇的海盗气质。苹果解雇了Chiat/Day广告公司，它曾做过1984”广告，以及在报纸上刊登平面广告，上书“欢迎——真的”。乔布斯就在《华尔街日报》买下了一整版版面，宣称“恭喜Chiat/Day广告公司——真的……因为我能保证：离开苹果后是重生”。

<p>Perhaps the greatest  similarity to his days at Apple was that Jobs brought with him his reality  distortion field. It was on display at the company’s first retreat at Pebble  Beach in late 1985. There Jobs pronounced that the first NeXT computer would be  shipped in just eighteen months. It was already clear that this date was  impossible, but he blew off a suggestion from one engineer that they be  realistic and plan on shipping in 1988. “If we do that, the world isn’t  standing still, the technology window passes us by, and all the work we’ve done  we have to throw down the toilet,” he argued.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>苹果和后苹果生活之间的最大共同点便是乔布斯的现实扭曲力场。1985年底，NeXT在圆石滩（PebbleBeach）举行了第一次外出集思会，乔布斯的现实扭曲力场在离开苹果后第一次展现了出来。他对自己的团队断言，第一台NeXT将在18个月内出货。当时情况已经很明显，这是不可能的。一位工程师建议现实一点儿，将出货期改为1988年，乔布斯驳回了这个提议。“世界不会静止不动，如果我们这样做，领先的技术就会把我们甩下，而我们已经做出来的东西就不得不被扔进垃圾桶。”他争论道。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Joanna Hoffman, the  veteran of the Macintosh team who was among those willing to challenge Jobs,  did so. “Reality distortion has motivational value, and I think that’s fine,”  she said as Jobs stood at a whiteboard. “However, when it comes to setting a  date in a way that affects the design of the product, then we get into real  deep shit.” Jobs didn’t agree: “I think we have to drive a stake in the ground  somewhere, and I think if we miss this window, then our credibility starts to  erode.” What he did not say, even though it was suspected by all, was that if  their targets slipped they might run out of money. Jobs had pledged $7 million  of his own funds, but at their current burn rate that would run out in eighteen  months if they didn’t start getting some revenue from shipped products.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>麦金塔团队的老成员乔安娜·霍夫曼是敢于挑战乔布斯的人之一，她又一次这样做了。“现实扭曲具有激励价值，我觉得这很好。”她说，当时乔布斯站在白板前，“但是，出货日期会影响产品的设计，所以在设定这种日期的时候，如果还扭曲现实就会带来大麻烦。”乔布斯不同意，“我觉得我们必须赌一把，而且，我认为，如果错过了这个肘间，我们的信誉就会受损。”尽管很多人都怀疑之所以不能推迟是因为目标如果没有实现就可能资金短缺，但乔布斯并没有提及这个原因。他自己在NeXT公司投了700万美元，但是按照他们当时的资金消耗速度，这笔钱只能撑18个月；如果那时还无法通过出货获得收入，他们就没钱了。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Three months later,  when they returned to Pebble Beach for their next retreat, Jobs began his list  of maxims with “The honeymoon is over.” By the time of the third retreat, in  Sonoma in September 1986, the timetable was gone, and it looked as though the  company would hit a financial wall.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>3个月后，即1986年初，他们为又一次外出集思会回到了圆石滩，乔布斯训话时开场说道：“蜜月结束了。”1986年9月，第三次外出集思会，整个时间表已不见踪影，看上去NeXT已经走上了财政末路。

<div class="left"><h3><a name="s4"></a>Perot to the Rescue</h3>
<p>In late 1986 Jobs sent  out a proposal to venture capital firms offering a 10% stake in NeXT for $3  million. That put a valuation on the entire company of $30 million, a number  that Jobs had pulled out of thin air. Less than $7 million had gone into the  company thus far, and there was little to show for it other than a neat logo  and some snazzy offices. It had no revenue or products, nor any on the horizon.  Not surprisingly, the venture capitalists all passed on the offer to invest.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<h3>救星佩罗</h3>
<p>1986年底，乔布斯向凤投公司发出了招股说明书，300万美元可购买NeXT公司10%的股份。也就是说整个公司的估值为3000万美元，这一数值是乔布斯凭空想出来的。NeXT公司已经消耗了近700万美元，但这笔钱毫无成效，只体现在优雅的标识和时髦的办公室上。没有收入，没有产品，也没有即将发布产品实现营收的迹象。因此，毫不奇怪，风投公司都没有参与投资。</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>There was, however,  one cowboy who was dazzled. Ross Perot, the bantam Texan who had founded  Electronic Data Systems, then sold it to General Motors for $2.4 billion,  happened to watch a PBS documentary, <em>The Entrepreneurs</em>, which had a  segment on Jobs and NeXT in November 1986. He instantly identified with Jobs  and his gang, so much so that, as he watched them on television, he said, “I  was finishing their sentences for them.” It was a line eerily similar to one  Sculley had often used. Perot called Jobs the next day and offered, “If you  ever need an investor, call me.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>不过，倒是有一位颇具胆量的牛仔为NeXT公司神魂颠倒。罗斯·佩罗（RossPerot）是个矮小精干的得克萨斯人，他创办了电子数据系统公司（ElectronicDataSystems），后以24亿美元的价格卖给了通用汽车公司。1986年11月，佩罗碰巧看到了美国公共广播公司的一部纪录片《创业者》（TheEntrepreneurs），其中有一部分是关于乔布斯和NeXT公司的。佩罗当下就很欣赏乔布斯及其团队，他边看电视边想，“我会帮助他们完成想法。”这句话与斯卡利过去常说的话极其相似。次日，佩罗就打电话给乔布斯，提出，“如果你需要投资者，给我打电话。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs did indeed need  one, badly. But he was careful not to show it. He waited a week before calling  back. Perot sent some of his analysts to size up NeXT, but Jobs took care to  deal directly with Perot. One of his great regrets in life, Perot later said,  was that he had not bought Microsoft, or a large stake in it, when a very young  Bill Gates had come to visit him in Dallas in 1979. By the time Perot called  Jobs, Microsoft had just gone public with a $1 billion valuation. Perot had  missed out on the opportunity to make a lot of money and have a fun adventure.  He was eager not to make that mistake again.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯确实需要，非常需要。然而他也足够冷静，没有表现出来。过了一周他才回复佩罗的电话。佩罗派了一些自己的分析师来评估NeXT，而乔布斯则谨慎地直接同佩罗打交道。佩罗后来表示，自己人生中的最大憾事之一就是，1979年，当年轻的比尔·盖茨前来达拉斯拜访时，自己没有收购微软，或是买下大量股份。佩罗打给乔布斯的时候，微软刚刚上市，市值10亿美元。佩罗错过了发大财和拥有一番有趣冒险的机会。因此，他非常不愿意再犯下类似的错误。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs made an offer to  Perot that was three times more costly than had quietly been offered to venture  capitalists a few months earlier. For $20 million, Perot would get 16% of the  equity in the company, after Jobs put in another $5 million. That meant the  company would be valued at about $126 million. But money was not a major  consideration for Perot. After a meeting with Jobs, he declared that he was in.  “I pick the jockeys, and the jockeys pick the horses and ride them,” he told  Jobs. “You guys are the ones I’m betting on, so you figure it out.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯向佩罗提出的价钱，比数月前不动声色地向其他不感兴趣的风投公司提出的条件高出3倍。在乔布斯再投入500万美元后，佩罗可以用2000万美元买下NeXT公司16%的份。这意味着，该公司的估值将达到大约1.26亿美元。但是，钱并不是佩罗考虑的主要因素。同乔布斯会面后，他宣布自己入伙。“我挑选骑师，骑师挑选马匹并驾驭它们，”他对乔布斯说，“你们就是我赌的骑师，因此，你们看着办。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Perot brought to NeXT  something that was almost as valuable as his $20 million lifeline: He was a  quotable, spirited cheerleader for the company, who could lend it an air of  credibility among grown-ups. “In terms of a startup company, it’s one that  carries the least risk of any I’ve seen in 25 years in the computer industry,”  he told the <em>New York Times.</em> “We’ve had some sophisticated people see the  hardware—it blew them away. Steve and his whole NeXT team are the darnedest  bunch of perfectionists I’ve ever seen.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>除了2000万美元的救命钱，佩罗也为NeXT公司带来了几乎同样宝贵的其他东西：他是公司津津乐道、精神昂扬的拉拉队长，给员工带来了信任的氛围。“就创业公司而言，这是我在计算机行业25年时间里所见过的风险最小的企业。”他告诉《纽约时报》，“我们请一些专业人士看了硬件，他们都被震住了。史蒂夫和整个NeXT团队是我所见过最厉害的完美主义者。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Perot also traveled in  rarefied social and business circles that complemented Jobs’s own. He took Jobs  to a black-tie dinner dance in San Francisco that Gordon and Ann Getty gave for  King Juan Carlos I of Spain. When the king asked Perot whom he should meet,  Perot immediately produced Jobs. They were soon engaged in what Perot later  described as “electric conversation,” with Jobs animatedly describing the next  wave in computing. At the end the king scribbled a note and handed it to Jobs.  “What happened?” Perot asked. Jobs answered, “I sold him a computer.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>佩罗还出入于商界和精英人物的社交圈，这弥补了乔布斯的不足。他带着乔布斯前往旧金山参加一个正式的晚宴舞会，这个晚宴是戈登·格蒂（GordonGetty）和安·格蒂（AnnGetty）为西班牙国王胡安·卡洛斯一世举办的。当这位国王询问佩罗应该见见谁时，佩罗立刻介绍了乔布斯。两人很快就进入了佩罗后来所说的“兴奋无比的谈话”之中，乔布斯绘声绘色地描述着计算机行业的下一个浪潮。最后，卡洛斯一世写了一张纸条递给乔布斯。“怎么了？”佩罗问道。乔布斯回答，“我卖了一台电脑给他。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>These and other  stories were incorporated into the mythologized story of Jobs that Perot told  wherever he went. At a briefing at the National Press Club in Washington, he  spun Jobs’s life story into a Texas-size yarn about a young man</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>佩罗走到哪儿都会讲起这些关于乔布斯的传奇。在华盛顿的国家记者俱乐部，他把乔布斯的人生故事夸大成一部恢弘的年轻人历险记：
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>so poor he couldn’t  afford to go to college, working in his garage at night, playing with computer  chips, which was his hobby, and his dad—who looks like a character out of a  Norman Rockwell painting—comes in one day and said, “Steve, either make  something you can sell or go get a job.” Sixty days later, in a wooden box that  his dad made for him, the first Apple computer was created. And this high  school graduate literally changed the world.</p>

  <p>The one phrase that  was true was the one about Paul Jobs’s looking like someone in a Rockwell  painting. And perhaps the last phrase, the one about Jobs changing the world.  Certainly Perot believed that. Like Sculley, he saw himself in Jobs. “Steve’s  like me,” Perot told the <em>Washington Post</em>’s David Remnick. “We’re weird  in the same way. We’re soul mates.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>他穷得上不起大学，晚上在自己的车库里工作，摆弄电脑芯片，这是他的愛好。他的爸爸就像诺曼·洛克威尔（NormanRockwell）画中的人物，一天他走进来说：“史蒂夫，要么做些能卖的东西，要么就去找份工作。”6天后，在父亲为他做的木箱中，第一台苹果电脑诞生了。这个高中毕业生切切实实地改变了世界。</p>
<p>这段描述中唯一真实的地方就是关于保罗·乔布斯的，他确实像诺曼·洛克威尔画中的人物。也许最后一旬，乔布斯改变世界的那句，也是对的。显然，佩罗相信自己的故事。和斯卡利一样，他也在乔布斯身上看到了自己。“史蒂夫跟我很像，”佩罗告诉《华盛顿邮报》的戴维·雷姆尼克（DavidRemnick），“我们一样的古怪，我们性情相投。”</p>



</div></div>

 

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><h3><a name="s5"></a>Gates and NeXT</h3>
<p>Bill Gates was not a  soul mate. Jobs had convinced him to produce software applications for the  Macintosh, which had turned out to be hugely profitable for Microsoft. But  Gates was one person who was resistant to Jobs’s reality distortion field, and  as a result he decided not to create software tailored for the NeXT platform.  Gates went to California to get periodic demonstrations, but each time he came away  unimpressed. “The Macintosh was truly unique, but I personally don’t understand  what is so unique about Steve’s new computer,” he told <em>Fortune.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<h3>盖茨和NeXT</h3>
<p>比尔·盖茨跟乔布斯性情并不相投。乔布斯曾说服盖茨为麦金塔做软件应用，最后给微软带来了丰厚利润。但是，比尔·盖茨抗拒乔布斯的现实扭曲力场，因此，他决定不为NeXT平台开发专门软件。盖茨会定期到加利福尼亚州看NeXT的演示，但是每次他都不以为然。“麦金塔真的是独一无二，但是我个人不太理解史蒂夫的新电脑有什么特别之处。”盖茨对《财富》杂志表示。</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Part of the problem  was that the rival titans were congenitally unable to be deferential to each  other. When Gates made his first visit to NeXT’s Palo Alto headquarters, in the  summer of 1987, Jobs kept him waiting for a half hour in the lobby, even though  Gates could see through the glass walls that Jobs was walking around having  casual conversations. “I’d gone down to NeXT and I had the Odwalla, the most  expensive carrot juice, and I’d never seen tech offices so lavish,” Gates  recalled, shaking his head with just a hint of a smile. “And Steve comes a half  hour late to the meeting.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>造成这种情况的部分原因在于，这两位彼此竞争的巨头无法做到互相恭敬。1987年夏天，盖茨第一次造访NeXT公司位于帕洛奥图的总部，乔布斯让他在大堂里等了半个小时，盖茨甚至透过玻璃墙看到了乔布斯只是在里面走来走去地闲谈。“我到NeXT，喝了最贵的奥德瓦拉牌胡萝卜汁，见识了如此豪华的科技企业办公室，”盖茨回忆道，带着一抹笑容摇了摇头，“我们的会面史蒂夫迟到了半个小时。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs’s sales pitch,  according to Gates, was simple. “We did the Mac together,” Jobs said. “How did  that work for you? Very well. Now, we’re going to do this together and this is  going to be great.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>根椐盖茨的说法，乔布斯的推销说辞很简单。“我们曾一起做过Mac项目。”乔布斯说，“结果对你怎么样？非常好。现在，我们一起做这个，也会非常棒。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>But Gates was brutal  to Jobs, just as Jobs could be to others. “This machine is crap,” he said. “The  optical disk has too low latency, the fucking case is too expensive. This thing  is ridiculous.” He decided then, and reaffirmed on each subsequent visit, that  it made no sense for Microsoft to divert resources from other projects to  develop applications for NeXT. Worse yet, he repeatedly said so publicly, which  made others less likely to spend time developing for NeXT. “Develop for it?  I’ll piss on it,” he told <em>InfoWorld.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>然而，盖茨对乔布斯很残忍，就像乔布斯对其他人一样。“这款机器就是垃圾他说，“光驱的反应时间太长，机箱太他妈贵，整个东西太荒谬。”当时盖茨就决定，微软不会分散其他项目的资源来为NeXT开发应用程序，并且在随后的每次到访都重申了这一点。更糟的是，他一再公开表态，致使其他软件公司也不愿意花时间为NeXT开发软件。“为它开发？我会在它上面撒尿。”他在《信息世界》（InfoWorld）上说。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>When they happened to  meet in the hallway at a conference, Jobs started berating Gates for his  refusal to do software for NeXT. “When you get a market, I will consider it,”  Gates replied. Jobs got angry. “It was a screaming battle, right in front of  everybody,” recalled Adele Goldberg, the Xerox PARC engineer. Jobs insisted that  NeXT was the next wave of computing. Gates, as he often did, got more  expressionless as Jobs got more heated. He finally just shook his head and  walked away.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>两人碰巧在一次会议的走廊上遇见时，乔布斯开始因为盖茨拒绝为NeXT开发软件而训斥对方。“等你有市场的时候我会考虑。”盖茨回答说。乔布斯生气了。“当着周围所有人的面，他们俩开始大声争吵。”阿黛尔·戈德堡回忆说，她是施乐帕洛奧图研究中心的工程师，当时也在场。乔布斯坚持认为NeXT会是计算机产业的下一波浪潮。这次争执跟以往一样，乔布斯越是激动，盖茨就越是一言不发。最后盖茨摇摇头走开了。

<p>Beneath their personal  rivalry—and occasional grudging respect—was their basic philosophical difference.  Jobs believed in an end-to-end integration of hardware and software, which led  him to build a machine that was not compatible with others. Gates believed in,  and profited from, a world in which different companies made machines that were  compatible with one another; their hardware ran a standard operating system  (Microsoft’s Windows) and could all use the same software apps (such as  Microsoft’s Word and Excel). “His product comes with an interesting feature  called incompatibility,” Gates told the <em>Washington Post.</em> “It doesn’t run  any of the existing software. It’s a super-nice computer. I don’t think if I  went out to design an incompatible computer I would have done as well as he  did.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>在两人的争执以及偶尔不情愿地表示出的尊重背后，是基本理念上的差异。乔布斯看好硬件和软件集成的端到端一体化系统，这就致使他要创造出与其他软件和机器都不兼容的计算机。盖茨推崇不同的公司做出互相兼容的机器，自己从中获利：这些硬件设备都运行同一个标准的操作系统——微软的Windows操作系统，并都能运行同样的软件应用程序，如微软的Word和Excel。“他的产品有一个有趣的特点，就是不兼容性，”盖茨告诉《华盛顿邮报》说，“它不运行任何已有的软件。它是一台超级棒的电脑。如果要我来设计一款不兼容的计算机，我觉得自己做不到他那么好。”

<p>At a forum in  Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1989, Jobs and Gates appeared sequentially, laying  out their competing worldviews. Jobs spoke about how new waves come along in  the computer industry every few years. Macintosh had launched a revolutionary  new approach with the graphical interface; now NeXT was doing it with object-oriented  programming tied to a powerful new machine based on an optical disk. Every  major software vendor realized they had to be part of this new wave, he said,  “except Microsoft.” When Gates came up, he reiterated his belief that Jobs’s  end-to-end control of the software and the hardware was destined for failure,  just as Apple had failed in competing against the Microsoft Windows standard.  “The hardware market and the software market are separate,” he said. When asked  about the great design that could come from Jobs’s approach, Gates gestured to  the NeXT prototype that was still sitting onstage and sneered, “If you want  black, I’ll get you a can of paint.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>1989年，在马萨诸塞州剑桥市的一个论坛上，乔布斯和盖茨先后现身，陈述彼此截然相反的世界观。乔布斯谈到，每隔几年，计算机产业就会出现新的浪潮。麦金塔电脑借图形界面推出了革命性的新方法。现在，NeXT通过将面向对象的编程方法与采用光盘为存储介质的功能强大的计算机捆绑起来，正在引领新一辁的革命。乔布斯表示，每个大型软件厂商都意识到了自己必须成为新浪潮的一部分，“除了微软”。轮到盖茨讲话时，他重申，乔布斯控制软件和硬件端到端一体化的系统终究会失败，就像苹果与微软Windows操作系统的竞争一样。“硬件市场和软件市场是分开的。”他说。当被问及乔布斯的方法可能会产生的伟大设计时，盖茨示意大家看看还在台上的NeXT样机，嘲笑道：“如果你想要黑色，我可以给你一罐黑色油漆。”

<div class="left"><h3><a name="s6"></a>IBM</h3>
<p>Jobs came up with a  brilliant jujitsu maneuver against Gates, one that could have changed the  balance of power in the computer industry forever. It required Jobs to do two  things that were against his nature: licensing out his software to another  hardware maker and getting into bed with IBM. He had a pragmatic streak, albeit  a tiny one, so he was able to overcome his reluctance. But his heart was never  fully in it, which is why the alliance would turn out to be short-lived.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<h3><a name="s6"></a>IBM</h3>

<p>乔布斯想出了一记漂亮的柔术招式来对抗盖茨，这一招可能永远改变计算机产业的权力制衡。这需要乔布斯违背自己的本性做两件事：授权自己的软件给另一个硬件制造商，并和IBM合作。乔布斯的个性有几分务实，虽然不多，因此他能够克服自己的不情愿。但是他从来没有全心投入于此，这也就是为什么他同其他公司的联盟会如此短暂。

　　</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>It began at a party, a  truly memorable one, for the seventieth birthday of the <em>Washington Post</em> publisher Katharine Graham in June 1987 in Washington. Six hundred guests attended,  including President Ronald Reagan. Jobs flew in from California and IBM’s  chairman John Akers from New York. It was the first time they had met. Jobs  took the opportunity to bad-mouth Microsoft and attempt to wean IBM from using  its Windows operating system. “I couldn’t resist telling him I thought IBM was  taking a giant gamble betting its entire software strategy on Microsoft,  because I didn’t think its software was very good,” Jobs recalled.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>一切始于一次聚会，一次令人难忘的聚会。1987年6月，《华盛顿邮报》发行人凯瑟琳·格雷厄姆举办了她的70岁生日聚会，共有600位嘉宾出席，其中包括美国前总统罗纳德·里根。乔布斯从加利福尼亚州赶来，IBM董事长约翰·埃克斯从纽约州过来。这是两人第一次见面。乔布斯借此机会唱衰微软，并试图让IBM放弃微软的Windows操作系统。“我忍不住告诉他，IBM将整个软件战略都压在微软身上，这太冒险了，因为我不觉得微软的软件有多好。”乔布斯回忆说。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>To Jobs’s delight,  Akers replied, “How would you like to help us?” Within a few weeks Jobs showed  up at IBM’s Armonk, New York, headquarters with his software engineer Bud  Tribble. They put on a demo of NeXT, which impressed the IBM engineers. Of  particular significance was NeXTSTEP, the machine’s object-oriented operating  system. “NeXTSTEP took care of a lot of trivial programming chores that slow  down the software development process,” said Andrew Heller, the general manager  of IBM’s workstation unit, who was so impressed by Jobs that he named his  newborn son Steve.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>令乔布斯髙兴的是，埃克斯回应道：“你打算如何帮助我们呢？”没过几周，乔布斯就和软件工程师巴德·特里布尔出现在IBM位于纽约州阿蒙克市的总部。他们演示了NeXT，令IBM的工程师难以忘怀。尤为意义重大的是，NeXT电脑面向对象的操作系统NeXTSTEP受到了格外关注。“NeXTSTEP会处理很多导致软件开发过程迟缓的琐碎的编程问题。”IBM智能终端部门的总经理安德鲁·海勒（AndrewHeller）表示，他非常欣赏乔布斯，以至于也给自己的儿子起名为史蒂夫。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The negotiations lasted  into 1988, with Jobs becoming prickly over tiny details. He would stalk out of  meetings over disagreements about colors or design, only to be calmed down by  Tribble or Lewin. He didn’t seem to know which frightened him more, IBM or  Microsoft. In April Perot decided to play host for a mediating session at his  Dallas headquarters, and a deal was struck: IBM would license the current  version of the NeXTSTEP software, and if the managers liked it, they would use  it on some of their workstations. IBM sent to Palo Alto a 125-page contract.  Jobs tossed it down without reading it. “You don’t get it,” he said as he  walked out of the room. He demanded a simpler contract of only a few pages,  which he got within a week.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>双方的谈判一直持续到1988年，其间乔布斯对于微小的细节频频发怒。在颜色和设计问题上出现分歧时，他会在会议中途禽席，只有特里布尔或丹·卢因才能令他平静下来。他不知道IBM还是微软哪一个令自己更害怕。4月，佩罗决定在自己的达拉斯总部举办调停会议，一个令人震惊的交易就此诞生了——IBM将获得授权使用NeXTSTEP软件的目前版本，如果IBM喜欢这款软件，将会用在自己的一些工作站上。IBM给NeXT发送了一份125页的合同。乔布斯读都没读就扔掉了。“别来这一套。”他边说边走出办公室。他要一份只有几页的合同，不到一周，他所要求的合同就送到了。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs wanted to keep  the arrangement secret from Bill Gates until the big unveiling of the NeXT  computer, scheduled for October. But IBM insisted on being forthcoming. Gates  was furious. He realized this could wean IBM off its dependence on Microsoft  operating systems. “NeXTSTEP isn’t compatible with anything,” he raged to IBM  executives.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯希望直到10月份NeXT电脑隆重推出之前，都不让比尔·盖茨知道他与IBM的合作。但是，IBM坚持立即宣布。盖茨得知后怒不可遏。他很清楚，这可能会让IBM失去对微软操作系统的依赖。“NeXTSTEP和任何东西都不兼容。”他愤怒地对IBM的高管说。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>At first Jobs seemed  to have pulled off Gates’s worst nightmare. Other computer makers that were  beholden to Microsoft’s operating systems, most notably Compaq and Dell, came  to ask Jobs for the right to clone NeXT and license NeXTSTEP. There were even  offers to pay a lot more if NeXT would get out of the hardware business  altogether.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>起初，乔布斯似乎成了盖茨最可怕的噩梦。其他依赖于微软操作系统的电脑制造商也找到乔布斯，让其授权复制NeXT和使用NeXTSTEP，其中最著名的是康柏公司和戴尔公司。甚至有公司表示如果NeXT放弃硬件业务，愿意付更高的价钱。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>That was too much for  Jobs, at least for the time being. He cut off the clone discussions. And he  began to cool toward IBM. The chill became reciprocal. When the person who made  the deal at IBM moved on, Jobs went to Armonk to meet his replacement, Jim  Cannavino. They cleared the room and talked one-on-one. Jobs demanded more  money to keep the relationship going and to license newer versions of NeXTSTEP  to IBM. Cannavino made no commitments, and he subsequently stopped returning  Jobs’s phone calls. The deal lapsed. NeXT got a bit of money for a licensing  fee, but it never got the chance to change the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>这对乔布斯来说太多了，至少在当时是。他停止了复制NeXT的讨论，对IBM的态度也开始冷淡，这慢慢发展为相互的冷淡。当IBM发起该项合作的人离职后，乔布斯来到阿蒙克会见其继任者吉姆·坎纳维诺（JimCannavino）。两人进行了一对一的谈话。乔布斯提出，IBM需要支付更多的钱才能继续双方的合作并得到NeXTSTEP更新版本的授权。坎纳维诺没有作出任何承诺，他随后也拒绝回复乔布斯的来电。于是，之前的合同中止了。NeXT公司得到了一笔授权费，但始终没有得到改变世界的机会。
</p>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><h3><a name="s7"></a>The Launch, October 1988</h3>
<p>Jobs had perfected the  art of turning product launches into theatrical productions, and for the world  premiere of the NeXT computer—on October 12, 1988, in San Francisco’s Symphony  Hall—he wanted to outdo himself. He needed to blow away the doubters. In the  weeks leading up to the event, he drove up to San Francisco almost every day to  hole up in the Victorian house of Susan Kare, NeXT’s graphic designer, who had  done the original fonts and icons for the Macintosh. She helped prepare each of  the slides as Jobs fretted over everything from the wording to the right hue of  green to serve as the background color. “I like that green,” he said proudly as  they were doing a trial run in front of some staffers. “Great green, great  green,” they all murmured in assent.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<h3>1988年10月，NeXT发布会</h3>

<p>乔布斯将产品发布变成戏剧作品的艺术已经登峰造极。NeXT电脑全球首发式定于1988年10月12日在旧金山交响乐堂举行，乔布斯想要超越自己，他要澄清质疑。在发布会前几周，他几乎每天都要开车去旧金山，藏身于苏珊·卡雷的维多利亚风格的房子里。苏珊·卡雷是NeXT的图形设计师，她为麦金塔设计了最初的字体和图标。由于乔布斯操心发布会的每一个细节，从措辞到绿色背景的色调，所以要由卡雷来帮忙准备每一张幻灯片。“我喜欢这种绿。”他自豪地说，当时他们正在一些工作人员的注视下进行预演。“很棒的绿色，很棒的绿色。”众人一致低声说道。乔布斯精心制作、润色并修改了每一页幻灯片，就好像自己是T·S·艾略特，要将埃兹拉·庞德（EzraPound）的建议写进《荒原》（TheWasteLand）一样。

　　</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>No detail was too  small. Jobs went over the invitation list and even the lunch menu (mineral  water, croissants, cream cheese, bean sprouts). He picked out a video  projection company and paid it $60,000 for help. And he hired the postmodernist  theater producer George Coates to stage the show. Coates and Jobs decided, not  surprisingly, on an austere and radically simple stage look. The unveiling of  the black perfect cube would occur on a starkly minimalist stage setting with a  black background, a table covered by a black cloth, a black veil draped over  the computer, and a simple vase of flowers. Because neither the hardware nor  the operating system was actually ready, Jobs was urged to do a simulation. But  he refused. Knowing it would be like walking a tightrope without a net, he  decided to do the demonstration live.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>所有细节都很重要。乔布斯亲自核查了邀请名单，甚至还有午餐菜单（矿泉水、牛角面包、奶油乳酪、豆芽）。他挑选了一家视频投影公司，并支付了6万美元聘用他们负责视听支持。他还聘请了后现代主义戏剧制作人乔治·科茨（GeorgeCoates）筹划这次发布会。不出所料，科茨和乔布斯决定采用庄重而极为简单的舞台外观。一个极简主义的舞台，背景是黑色的，桌子上罩着一块黑布，黑色遮布披在电脑上，旁边摆着一瓶简单的花，完美的黑色立方体将在这种布置中掲晓。由于硬件和操作系统都没有真正完成，有人提议用模拟展示。但乔布斯拒绝了。他决定现场示范，尽管他知道，这会像走钢丝而没有安全网一样。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>More than three  thousand people showed up at the event, lining up two hours before curtain  time. They were not disappointed, at least by the show. Jobs was onstage for  three hours, and he again proved to be, in the words of Andrew Pollack of the <em>New  York Times</em>, “the Andrew Lloyd Webber of product introductions, a master of  stage flair and special effects.” Wes Smith of the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> said  the launch was “to product demonstrations what Vatican II was to church  meetings.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>3000多人来到了现场，他们在发布会开始前两小时排队进入交响乐堂。他们没有失望，至少这次展示表演没有令他们失望。乔布斯在台上待了3个小时，他再一次成为《纽约时报》记者安德鲁·波拉克口中的“产品发布界的安德鲁·劳埃德·韦伯（AndrewLloydWebber）①，舞台风格和特效大师”。《芝加哥论坛报》（ChicagoTribune）的韦斯·史密斯（WesSmith）称，NeXT的发布会“之于产品演示，就像梵蒂冈第二届大公会（VaticanII）之于教会聚会一样”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs had the audience  cheering from his opening line: “It’s great to be back.” He began by recounting  the history of personal computer architecture, and he promised that they would  now witness an event “that occurs only once or twice in a decade—a time when a  new architecture is rolled out that is going to change the face of computing.”  The NeXT software and hardware were designed, he said, after three years of  consulting with universities across the country. “What we realized was that  higher ed wants a personal mainframe.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“很髙兴能回来。”乔布斯以他一贯的开场白引发了观众的欢呼。他开始述说个人电脑架构的历史，并向现场观众承诺，他们即将见证一个“10年中才会发生一次或两次的历史性事件——一个新的架构即将推出，并将改变计算机的面貌”。乔布斯说，在经过3年对全国高校的咨询后，公司设计出了NeXT软件和硬件。“我们意识到，高等教育行业的人需要的是个人大型主机。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>As usual there were  superlatives. The product was “incredible,” he said, “the best thing we could  have imagined.” He praised the beauty of even the parts unseen. Balancing on  his fingertips the foot-square circuit board that would be nestled in the  foot-cube box, he enthused, “I hope you get a chance to look at this a little  later. It’s the most beautiful printed circuit board I’ve ever seen in my  life.” He then showed how the computer could play speeches—he featured King’s  “I Have a Dream” and Kennedy’s “Ask Not”—and send email with audio attachments.  He leaned into the microphone on the computer to record one of his own. “Hi,  this is Steve, sending a message on a pretty historic day.” Then he asked those  in the audience to add “a round of applause” to the message, and they did.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>同以往一样，他的演讲有些溢美之词。乔布斯说，该产品“令人难以置信”，是“我们所能想象的最好产品”。他甚至称赞机器内部看不到的部件也工艺完美。他用手指托着一个1平方英尺见方的电路板，这个电路板将放在NeXT1英尺见方的机箱中。他热情地说道：“我希望你们一会儿能有机会看看这个东西。这是我一生中见过的最漂亮的印刷电路板。”乔布斯接着展示了这台电脑播放讲话的功能，他播放了马丁·路德·金的《我有一个梦想》和肯尼迪的《不要问》（AskNot）,以及发送加载音频附件的邮件的功能。他俯下身，对着电脑的麦克风，录下了自己的声音。“嗨，我是史蒂夫，在这个极富历史性的一天，我发出了这条消息。”然后，他叫观众给这个消息加上“一片掌声”，观众们照做了。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>One of Jobs’s management  philosophies was that it is crucial, every now and then, to roll the dice and  “bet the company” on some new idea or technology. At the NeXT launch, he  boasted of an example that, as it turned out, would not be a wise gamble:  having a high-capacity (but slow) optical read/write disk and no floppy disk as  a backup. “Two years ago we made a decision,” he said. “We saw some new  technology and we made a decision to risk our company.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯的管理理念之一就是，不时地孤注一掷，“把公司压在”一些新点子或技术上，这样做至关重要。NeXT发布时，他炫耀了一个例子：采用高容量（但速度慢）的读写光盘，而不是用软盘来备份数据。后来，事实证明这是一场不明智的赌博。“两年前，我们作出了一个决定，”乔布斯说道，“我们见识到一些新的技术，并决定赌一赌。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Then he turned to a  feature that would prove more prescient. “What we’ve done is made the first  real digital books,” he said, noting the inclusion of the Oxford edition of  Shakespeare and other tomes. “There has not been an advancement in the state of  the art of printed book technology since Gutenberg.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>接着，他开始介绍另一个功能——能更好地证明乔布斯的先见之明。“我们做出了第一批真正的电子书。”他说，并提到电脑里包含了牛津版的莎士比亚和其他大部头，“自古腾堡以来，印刷书本的技术还未出现过进步。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>At times he could be amusingly  aware of his own foibles, and he used the electronic book demonstration to poke  fun at himself. “A word that’s sometimes used to describe me is ‘mercurial,’”  he said, then paused. The audience laughed knowingly, especially those in the  front rows, which were filled with NeXT employees and former members of the  Macintosh team. Then he pulled up the word in the computer’s dictionary and  read the first definition: “Of or relating to, or born under the planet  Mercury.” Scrolling down, he said, “I think the third one is the one they mean:  ‘Characterized by unpredictable changeableness of mood.’” There was a bit more  laughter. “If we scroll down the thesaurus, though, we see that the antonym is  ‘saturnine.’ Well what’s that? By simply double-clicking on it, we immediately  look that up in the dictionary, and here it is: ‘Cold and steady in moods. Slow  to act or change. Of a gloomy or surly disposition.’” A little smile came  across his face as he waited for the ripple of laughter. “Well,” he concluded,  “I don’t think ‘mercurial’ is so bad after all.” After the applause, he used  the quotations book to make a more subtle point, about his reality distortion  field. The quote he chose was from Lewis Carroll’s <em>Through the Looking  Glass.</em> After Alice laments that no matter how hard she tries she can’t  believe impossible things, the White Queen retorts, “Why, sometimes I’ve  believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.” Especially from  the front rows, there was a roar of knowing laughter.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>有时，乔布斯会幽默地展示自己的自知之明，他用电子书演示来取笑自己。“有一个词有时会被用来形容我，‘mercurial’。”他说道，然后顿了顿。观众们会意地笑了，尤其是那些坐在前排的人，多是NeXT的雇员和原麦金塔团队的成员。接着，他把这个词输进了电脑的词典，读出了第一条释义。“水星的，与水星有关的或来自水星的。”他边把页面往下拉边说，“我想他们说的应该是第三种意思：‘情绪多变’。”笑声更多了。“如果我们继续往下拉，就能看到它的反义词‘saturnine’。这个词又是什么意思呢？只要双击一下这个词，我们就能马上查到它，来看看：‘情绪冷淡稳定。行动或改变迟缓。阴郁或阴沉的性格。’”在等待观众的笑声平息之时，乔布斯脸上出现了一点儿笑容。“好吧，”他总结道，“这么看来，我觉得‘mercurial’这个词也不是那么糟。”掌声过后，他用《牛津引语词典》展示了更巧妙的一点，关于他的现实扭曲力场观点。他选用的引语来自刘易斯·卡洛尔的《爱丽丝镜中奇遇记》（ThroughtheLookingGlass）②。当爱丽丝感叹，不管自己多么努力尝试，都无法相信不可能的事情。白皇后反驳道：“为什么，有时我都来得及在早餐前想通六件不可能的事。”又是一阵会意的笑声，尤其是前排的观众。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>All of the good cheer  served to sugarcoat, or distract attention from, the bad news. When it came  time to announce the price of the new machine, Jobs did what he would often do  in product demonstrations: reel off the features, describe them as being “worth  thousands and thousands of dollars,” and get the audience to imagine how  expensive it really should be. Then he announced what he hoped would seem like  a low price: “We’re going to be charging higher education a single price of  $6,500.” From the faithful, there was scattered applause. But his panel of  academic advisors had long pushed to keep the price to between $2,000 and  $3,000, and they thought that Jobs had promised to do so. Some of them were  appalled. This was especially true once they discovered that the optional printer  would cost another $2,000, and the slowness of the optical disk would make the  purchase of a $2,500 external hard disk advisable.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>这些欢呼声都是糖衣炮弹，为了转移观众对于坏消息的注意力。当宣布新机器的价格时，乔布斯采用了自己在产品演示中的常用伎俩：一口气说出产品众多的特点，将它们描述成“价值成千上万美元”的东西，让观众想象这个产品真的该有多贵。这样抬髙观众的心理预期后，他就开始宣布定好的价格，让产品的真实价格看起来比较低。“我们打算以每台6500美元的价格卖给髙等教育人士。”大厅里晌起了稀稀拉拉的掌声，来自忠实的追随者。但是，他的学术顾问小组一直在努力将价格维持在2000~3000美元；而且他们认为乔布斯也承诺过。他们中有些人震惊了。一旦他们发现可供选购的打印机又得花2000美元，并且，由于光驱速度缓慢，最好再配一个外部硬盘，这又需要2500美元时，大家会更吃惊的。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>There was another  disappointment that he tried to downplay: “Early next year, we will have our  0.9 release, which is for software developers and aggressive end users.” There  was a bit of nervous laughter. What he was saying was that the real release of  the machine and its software, known as the 1.0 release, would not actually be  happening in early 1989. In fact he didn’t set a hard date. He merely suggested  it would be sometime in the second quarter of that year. At the first NeXT  retreat back in late 1985, he had refused to budge, despite Joanna Hoffman’s  pushback, from his commitment to have the machine finished in early 1987. Now  it was clear it would be more than two years later.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>而NeXT还有一个令人失望之处，最后乔布斯竭力含糊其辞。“明年初，我们将会推出0.9版，适于软件开发者和勇于尝鮮的终端用户。”乔布斯紧张地笑了笑。他的意思是，机器和软件的真正发布，即1.0版，不是1989年初。事实上，他还没有设定确切日期。乔布斯只是表示，1.0版将会在1989年第二季度推出。1985年底第一次NeXT外出集思会回来时，乔布斯曾拒绝乔安娜·霍夫曼推后发布日期的提议，他承诺要在1987年初完成机器。现在，很明显，这款电脑的发布会要推迟两年多。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The event ended on a  more upbeat note, literally. Jobs brought onstage a violinist from the San  Francisco Symphony who played Bach’s A Minor Violin Concerto in a duet with the  NeXT computer onstage. People erupted in jubilant applause. The price and the  delayed release were forgotten in the frenzy. When one reporter asked him  immediately afterward why the machine was going to be so late, Jobs replied,  “It’s not late. It’s five years ahead of its time.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>某种意义上讲，发布会在一个较为乐观的基调中结束了。乔布斯请来一位旧金山交响乐团的小提琴手，同台上的NeXT—起演奏巴赫的《A小调小提琴协奏曲》。人群爆发出欢快的掌声。狂热中，人们忘记了价格和推迟发布的不愉快。就在此后，一位记者问乔布斯为什么这款电脑会推迟这么久，乔布斯回答说：“并不迟，它领先了时代5年。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>As would become his  standard practice, Jobs offered to provide “exclusive” interviews to anointed  publications in return for their promising to put the story on the cover. This  time he went one “exclusive” too far, though it didn’t really hurt. He agreed  to a request from <em>Business Week</em>’s Katie Hafner for exclusive access to  him before the launch, but he also made a similar deal with <em>Newsweek</em> and  then with <em>Fortune.</em> What he didn’t consider was that one of <em>Fortune</em>’s  top editors, Susan Fraker, was married to <em>Newsweek</em>’s editor Maynard  Parker. At the <em>Fortune</em> story conference, when they were talking  excitedly about their exclusive, Fraker mentioned that she happened to know  that <em>Newsweek</em> had also been promised an exclusive, and it would be  coming out a few days before <em>Fortune.</em> So Jobs ended up that week on only  two magazine covers. <em>Newsweek</em> used the cover line “Mr. Chips” and showed  him leaning on a beautiful NeXT, which it proclaimed to be “the most exciting  machine in years.” <em>Business Week</em> showed him looking angelic in a dark  suit, fingertips pressed together like a preacher or professor. But Hafner  pointedly reported on the manipulation that surrounded her exclusive. “NeXT  carefully parceled out interviews with its staff and suppliers, monitoring them  with a censor’s eye,” she wrote. “That strategy worked, but at a price: Such  maneuvering—self-serving and relentless—displayed the side of Steve Jobs that  so hurt him at Apple. The trait that most stands out is Jobs’s need to control  events.”</p>

<p>乔布斯和媒体打交道已经有了自己的标准做法，他给自己钦点的媒体提供“独家”采访，但条件是把关于他的报道放在封面。不过，这一次他的“独家”手段太过分了，虽然并没有造成真正的伤害。他在产品发布之前，答应了《商业周刊》的凯蒂·哈夫纳（KatieHafner）独家专访的请求；他也和《新闻周刊》和《财富》杂志达成了同样的协议。但是，他没想到的是，《财富》杂志的高级编辑苏珊·弗雷克（SusanFraker）和《新闻周刊》的梅纳德·帕克（MaynardParker）是夫妻。在《财富》的选题会上，当人们正兴冲冲地谈论乔布斯的独家新闻时，弗雷克不安地开口了，说自己碰巧了解到《新闻周刊》也拿到了乔布斯的独家承诺，而且将会比《财富》杂志的报道提前几天出来。结果，乔布斯只上了两家杂志的封面。《新闻周刊》称他为“芯片先生”，并刊出了一张他俯身靠近美丽的NeXT电脑的图片，并宣称这是“数年内最激动人心的机器”。《商业周刊》放了一张乔布斯身着深色西服的照片，他看上去像个天使，十指相扣如同传教士和教授那样。但是，哈夫纳尖锐地报道了关于乔布斯对独家新闻的操纵。“NeXT谨慎地分配着媒体对员工和供应商的采访，通过审查来控制采访报道的内容，”她写道，“这个策略奏效，伹也付出了代价；这种行为显示出史蒂夫·乔布斯自利和无情的一面，也正是这点让他在苹果深受伤害。乔布斯最突出的特征就是需要控制权。”

<p>When the hype died  down, the reaction to the NeXT computer was muted, especially since it was not  yet commercially available. Bill Joy, the brilliant and wry chief scientist at  rival Sun Microsystems, called it “the first Yuppie workstation,” which was not  an unalloyed compliment. Bill Gates, as might be expected, continued to be  publicly dismissive. “Frankly, I’m disappointed,” he told the <em>Wall Street  Journal.</em> “Back in 1981, we were truly excited by the Macintosh when Steve  showed it to us, because when you put it side-by-side with another computer, it  was unlike anything anybody had ever seen before.” The NeXT machine was not  like that. “In the grand scope of things, most of these features are truly  trivial.” He said that Microsoft would continue its plans not to write software  for the NeXT. Right after the announcement event, Gates wrote a parody email to  his staff. “All reality has been completely suspended,” it began. Looking back  at it, Gates laughs that it may have been “the best email I ever wrote.”</p>

<p>当宣传炒作平息下来后，市场对NeXT电脑的反应平淡，尤其是它还未上市销售。比尔·乔伊（BillJoy）是竞争对手Sim公司的首席科学家，聪明幽默，他称NeXT为“第一款雅皮士终端”，这应该是有保留的恭维。比尔·盖茨一如既往地对NeXT进行公开批驳。“坦白地说，我很失望。”他告诉《华尔街日报》，“1981年，当乔布斯向我们展示麦金塔的时候，我们真的因此而激动，因为当你把它和别的电脑放在一起时，它不同于以往任何机器。”NeXT电脑不是这样。“整体来看，它的大部分功能都真的无足轻重。”他说，微软将继续其计划，不为NeXT编写软件。在NeXT的发布会后，盖茨给自己的员工写了一封诙谐的邮件。“所有现实都被完全搁置。”邮件开头写道。回想起这封邮件，盖茨笑着说这可能是“我写过的最好的邮件”。

<p>When the NeXT computer  finally went on sale in mid-1989, the factory was primed to churn out ten  thousand units a month. As it turned out, sales were about four hundred a  month. The beautiful factory robots, so nicely painted, remained mostly idle,  and NeXT continued to hemorrhage cash.</p>

<p>1989年中，NeXT电脑终于开始销售了，工厂已经准备好每月生产10000台——结果这款电脑每月的销量只有约400台。漂亮的工厂机器人被喷刷得很好，却只能着，而NeXT还在继续烧钱——</p>
