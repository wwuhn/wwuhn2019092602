<h3>Competition</h3>
<p>When IBM introduced  its personal computer in August 1981, Jobs had his team buy one and dissect it.  Their consensus was that it sucked. Chris Espinosa called it “a half-assed,  hackneyed attempt,” and there was some truth to that. It used old-fashioned  command-line prompts and didn’t support bitmapped graphical displays. Apple  became cocky, not realizing that corporate technology managers might feel more  comfortable buying from an established company like IBM rather than one named  after a piece of fruit. Bill Gates happened to be visiting Apple headquarters  for a meeting on the day the IBM PC was announced. “They didn’t seem to care,”  he said. “It took them a year to realize what had happened.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<h3>竞争</h3>
<p>1981年8月，IBM推出了他们的个人电脑，乔布斯让自己的团队买了一台并进行了详细的分析。大家一致认为这是个很糟糕的产品，克里斯·埃斯皮诺萨称其“性能低下、毫无创新”，这话不无道理。它使用的是过时的命令行提示符，屏幕也只能显示字符，而不是图形界面的位图显示。苹果的员工显得过于自信了，他们没有意识到，企业的技术经理也许更愿意从IBM这样的老牌企业购买产品，而不是他们这家以水果命名的公司。IBM发布个人电脑的那天，比尔·盖茨恰巧在苹果公司的总部参加一场会议。“他们看上去根本不在意，”他说，“他们用了一年时间才意识到发生了什么。”

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Reflecting its cheeky  confidence, Apple took out a full-page ad in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> with the headline “Welcome, IBM. Seriously.” It cleverly positioned the  upcoming computer battle as a two-way contest between the spunky and rebellious  Apple and the establishment Goliath IBM, conveniently relegating to irrelevance  companies such as Commodore, Tandy, and Osborne that were doing just as well as  Apple.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>有一件事情表现出了苹果公司狂妄的自信：他们在《华尔街日报》上刊登了一幅整版广告，标题是：“欢迎你，IBM。真的欢迎。”它把即将来临的电脑产业大战定位成了两家公司之间的竞争：生气蓬勃而又叛逆的苹果和老牌巨头IBM。而当时和苹果公司表现同样出色的康懋达公司、坦迪公司（Tandy）以及奥斯本，则被归入了“不相干公司”的行列。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Throughout his career,  Jobs liked to see himself as an enlightened rebel pitted against evil empires,  a Jedi warrior or Buddhist samurai fighting the forces of darkness. IBM was his  perfect foil. He cleverly cast the upcoming battle not as a mere business  competition, but as a spiritual struggle. “If, for some reason, we make some  giant mistakes and IBM wins, my personal feeling is that we are going to enter  sort of a computer Dark Ages for about twenty years,” he told an interviewer.  “Once IBM gains control of a market sector, they almost always stop  innovation.” Even thirty years later, reflecting back on the competition, Jobs  cast it as a holy crusade: “IBM was essentially Microsoft at its worst. They  were not a force for innovation; they were a force for evil. They were like ATT  or Microsoft or Google is.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯在整个职业生涯中，都喜欢把自己看做对抗邪恶帝国的反抗者，一名与黑暗力量作斗争的绝地战士或是佛教武士。IBM是他的完美陪衬。乔布斯把即将到来的产业战争看做商业竞争和精神较量的结合体。“如果因为某个原因，我们犯下了巨大的错误，赢了我们，那我个人的感觉就是，我们将进入计算机领域长达20年的黑暗时代。”他告诉一个采访者，“一旦IBM控制了市场，他们几乎总是会停止创新。”即使30年后的现在，在回顾那场竞争时，乔布斯还是把它当做神圣的改革运动：“IBM本质上就是最差状态下的微软公司。他们不是创新的力量，而是邪恶的力量。IBM就像AT&T、微软或者谷歌一样。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Unfortunately for  Apple, Jobs also took aim at another perceived competitor to his Macintosh: the  company’s own Lisa. Partly it was psychological. He had been ousted from that  group, and now he wanted to beat it. He also saw healthy rivalry as a way to  motivate his troops. That’s why he bet John Couch $5,000 that the Mac would  ship before the Lisa. The problem was that the rivalry became unhealthy. Jobs  repeatedly portrayed his band of engineers as the cool kids on the block, in  contrast to the plodding HP engineer types working on the Lisa.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>对于苹果公司来说不幸的是，乔布斯还将矛头对准了麦金塔的另一个竞争对手：苹果公司自家生产的丽萨。这么做一定程度上是心理原因。他曾经遭到过丽萨项目的驱逐，现在他要打败它。乔布斯还认为，良性的竞争也是一种激励下属的方法。正因如此，他才跟约翰·库奇打赌5000美元，赌Mac会在丽萨之前上市。问题是，竞争逐渐变成了恶性的。乔布斯总是把自己手下的一帮工程师描绘成酷小孩，与丽萨团队那群惠普工程师风格的无趣之人形成了鲜明对照。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>More substantively,  when he moved away from Jef Raskin’s plan for an inexpensive and underpowered  portable appliance and reconceived the Mac as a desktop machine with a  graphical user interface, it became a scaled-down version of the Lisa that  would likely undercut it in the marketplace.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>更实质性的问题是，他当初放弃了杰夫·拉斯金生产廉价、低性能便携电脑的计划，将Mac重新定义为拥有图形用户界面的台式机，这样一来“狀就成为了小尺寸版本的丽萨，很有可能削弱丽萨的市场影响力。当乔布斯敦促伯勒尔·史密斯围绕摩托罗拉68000微处理器来设计Mac，并让Mac的运行速度超过了丽萨时，这一点显得愈加真实。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Larry Tesler, who  managed application software for the Lisa, realized that it would be important  to design both machines to use many of the same software programs. So to broker  peace, he arranged for Smith and Hertzfeld to come to the Lisa work space and  demonstrate the Mac prototype. Twenty-five engineers showed up and were  listening politely when, halfway into the presentation, the door burst open. It  was Rich Page, a volatile engineer who was responsible for much of the Lisa’s  design. “The Macintosh is going to destroy the Lisa!” he shouted. “The  Macintosh is going to ruin Apple!” Neither Smith nor Hertzfeld responded, so  Page continued his rant. “Jobs wants to destroy Lisa because we wouldn’t let  him control it,” he said, looking as if he were about to cry. “Nobody’s going  to buy a Lisa because they know the Mac is coming! But you don’t care!” He  stormed out of the room and slammed the door, but a moment later he barged back  in briefly. “I know it’s not your fault,” he said to Smith and Hertzfeld.  “Steve Jobs is the problem. Tell Steve that he’s destroying Apple!”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>负责管理丽萨电脑应用软件的拉里·特斯勒意识到了一件很重要的事情，就是让许多软件在两款机器上都能使用。于是，为了促成两个团队间的和平，他安排史密斯和赫茨菲尔德来到了丽萨的工作区，展示一下Mac的样机。25名工程师聚到了一起，正当大家在认真聆听、演示进行到一半的时候，门被猛然推开了。冲进来的是里奇·佩奇（RichPage）,他负责丽萨的大部分设计工作，是一个反复无常的工程师。“麦金塔会毁了丽萨的！”他吼道，“麦金塔也会毁了苹果公司！”史密斯和赫茨菲尔德都没有作出回应，于是佩奇继续咆哮：“乔布斯想要毁了丽萨，就因为我们没让他来管，”他说着，好像要哭出来一样：“没人会买丽萨的，因为大家都知道Mac就要问世了！但你们根本不在乎！”他冲出房间，砰地关上了门，但过了一会儿又闯了进来。“我知道这不是你们的错，”他对史密斯和赫茨菲尔德说，“史蒂夫·乔布斯才是问题所在，告诉史蒂夫，他正在毁掉苹果公司！”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs did indeed make  the Macintosh into a low-cost competitor to the Lisa, one with incompatible  software. Making matters worse was that neither machine was compatible with the  Apple II. With no one in overall charge at Apple, there was no chance of keeping  Jobs in harness.
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯的确把麦金塔变成了丽萨的低价竞争者，并且使用的是丽萨不能兼容的软件。更糟糕的是，这两款机器与AppleII都不兼容。苹果没有人全面管理公司，也就没有人能管得住乔布斯。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<h3><a name="s2" id="s2"></a>End-to-end Control</h3>
<p>Jobs’s reluctance to  make the Mac compatible with the architecture of the Lisa was motivated by more  than rivalry or revenge. There was a philosophical component, one that was  related to his penchant for control. He believed that for a computer to be  truly great, its hardware and its software had to be tightly linked. When a  computer was open to running software that also worked on other computers, it  would end up sacrificing some functionality. The best products, he believed,  were “whole widgets” that were designed end-to-end, with the software closely  tailored to the hardware and vice versa. This is what would distinguish the  Macintosh, which had an operating system that worked only on its own hardware,  from the environment that Microsoft was creating, in which its operating system  could be used on hardware made by many different companies.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<h3>彻底的控制</h3>
<p>乔布斯不愿意让Mac兼容丽萨的架构，并不只是出于竞争或复仇目的。还有一个原因，就是他对于控制权的迷恋。他认为一台电脑要真正做到优秀，它的硬件和软件是必须紧密联系在一起的。如果一台电脑要兼容那些在其他电脑上也能运行的软件，它必定要牺牲一些功能。他认为最好的产品是“一体的”，是端到端的，软件是为硬件量身定做的，硬件也是为软件度身定制的。正因为此，才使得麦金塔有别于微软（以及之后谷歌的安卓）所创造的环境，麦金塔上使用的操作系统只能在自己的硬件上运行，而微软和安卓的操作系统可以在许多不同厂家制造的硬件上运行。</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">

<p>“Jobs is a  strong-willed, elitist artist who doesn’t want his creations mutated  inauspiciously by unworthy programmers,” explained ZDNet’s editor Dan Farber.  “It would be as if someone off the street added some brush strokes to a Picasso  painting or changed the lyrics to a Dylan song.” In later years Jobs’s  whole-widget approach would distinguish the iPhone, iPod, and iPad from their  competitors. It resulted in awesome products. But it was not always the best  strategy for dominating a market. “From the first Mac to the latest iPhone,  Jobs’s systems have always been sealed shut to prevent consumers from meddling  and modifying them,” noted Leander Kahney, author of <em>Cult of the Mac</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“乔布斯是一个固执的杰出艺术家，他不希望看到自己创造的东西被二流的程序员给糟蹋了。”ZDNET的编辑丹·法伯（DanFarber）写道，“这就好像街边的某个人在毕加索的画作上涂了几笔或是改写了鲍勃·迪伦的歌词一样。”到后来，乔布斯软硬件结合的一体化产品理念也让iPhone、iPod和iPad从诸多竞争者中脱颖而出。这一理念造就了伟大的产品，但这并不总是占领市场的最佳战略。“从最初的最新的iPhone，乔布斯的系统一直都是封闭的，用户无法对其进行干预或修改。”《Mac信徒》一书的作者利安德·卡尼（LeanderKahney）说。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs’s desire to  control the user experience had been at the heart of his debate with Wozniak  over whether the Apple II would have slots that allow a user to plug expansion  cards into a computer’s motherboard and thus add some new functionality.  Wozniak won that argument: The Apple II had eight slots. But this time around  it would be Jobs’s machine, not Wozniak’s, and the Macintosh would have limited  slots. You wouldn’t even be able to open the case and get to the motherboard.  For a hobbyist or hacker, that was uncool. But for Jobs, the Macintosh was for  the masses. He wanted to give them a controlled experience.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯当初和沃兹尼亚克争论是否应该在AppleII上设置扩展槽，从而允许用户在电脑主板上插入扩展卡来增加一些新功能时，就表现出了他心中那种控制用户体验的强烈欲望。沃兹尼亚克在那场争论中获得了胜利。AppleII上有8个扩展槽。但这一次，这台电脑是属于乔布斯的，不是沃兹尼亚克的。麦金塔电脑不会有扩展槽。用户甚至都不能打开机箱碰到主板。对于业余爱好者或者黑客来说，这就少了很多乐趣。但对乔布斯来说，麦金塔是为大众设计的。他想让用户的体验是可控的。他不希望看到有人往扩展槽里随便插上电路板，破坏他的优雅设计。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>“It reflects his  personality, which is to want control,” said Berry Cash, who was hired by Jobs  in 1982 to be a market strategist at Texaco Towers. “Steve would talk about the  Apple II and complain, ‘We don’t have control, and look at all these crazy  things people are trying to do to it. That’s a mistake I’ll never make again.’”  He went so far as to design special tools so that the Macintosh case could not  be opened with a regular screwdriver. “We’re going to design this thing so  nobody but Apple employees can get inside this box,” he told Cash.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“这反映了他喜欢掌控一切的个性。”贝里·卡什（BerryCash）说，卡什于1982年被乔布斯聘请到苹果担任市场策划，成为了德士古塔的常驻员工，“史蒂夫在谈到AppleII的时候会抱怨说：‘我们没有控制杈，只能看着那些人对它做疯狂的事情。我再也不会犯这种错误了。’”他甚至设计了专门的工具，这样的话用户就无法使用常规的螺丝刀来打开机箱。“我们要把这台电脑设计成只有苹果的员工才能进入箱子内部。”他告诉卡什。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs also decided to  eliminate the cursor arrow keys on the Macintosh keyboard. The only way to move  the cursor was to use the mouse. It was a way of forcing old-fashioned users to  adapt to point-and-click navigation, even if they didn’t want to. Unlike other  product developers, Jobs did not believe the customer was always right; if they  wanted to resist using a mouse, they were wrong.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯还决定取消麦金塔键盘上的光标方向键。要移动光标，唯一的方法就是使用鼠标。这就迫使一些传统的用户必须适应鼠标的指向和点击这样的操作，尽管他们并不情愿这么做。和其他的产品开发者不一样，乔布斯不相信顾客永远是正确的。如果他们抵制使用鼠标的话，那他们就错了。这又一次证明，乔布斯把制造伟大产品的激情摆在了比迎合消费者的欲望更为重要的位置上。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>There was one other  advantage, he believed, to eliminating the cursor keys: It forced outside  software developers to write programs specially for the Mac operating system,  rather than merely writing generic software that could be ported to a variety  of computers. That made for the type of tight vertical integration between  application software, operating systems, and hardware devices that Jobs liked.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>取消方向键还有另一个好处（也是坏处）：它迫使苹果公司以外的软件开发商们针对Mac的操作系统编写专门的程序，而不是编写一个通用的程序从而能安装到不同的电脑上。这有助于应用软件、操作系统和硬件设备间的紧密的垂直整合，而这正是乔布斯所钟爱的。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs’s desire for  end-to-end control also made him allergic to proposals that Apple license the  Macintosh operating system to other office equipment manufacturers and allow  them to make Macintosh clones. The new and energetic Macintosh marketing  director Mike Murray proposed a licensing program in a confidential memo to  Jobs in May 1982. “We would like the Macintosh user environment to become an  industry standard,” he wrote. “The hitch, of course, is that now one must buy  Mac hardware in order to get this user environment. Rarely (if ever) has one  company been able to create and maintain an industry-wide standard that cannot  be shared with other manufacturers.” His proposal was to license the Macintosh  operating system to Tandy. Because Tandy’s Radio Shack stores went after a  different type of customer, Murray argued, it would not severely cannibalize  Apple sales. But Jobs was congenitally averse to such a plan. His approach  meant that the Macintosh remained a controlled environment that met his  standards, but it also meant that, as Murray feared, it would have trouble  securing its place as an industry standard in a world of IBM clones.
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>将麦金塔的操作系统授杈给其他的厂家，进而允许别人能制造出麦金塔的仿制品，这样的提议对于渴望端到端整体掌控局面的乔布斯来说是极为反感的。新上任的麦金塔营销总监是精力充沛的迈克·默里（MikeMurray），他在1982年5月交给乔布斯的机密备忘录中，提出了一份授权计划。“我们希望麦金塔的用户环境可以成为业界标准，”他写道，“但这其中有一个障碍：如果想要使用这个用户环境，就必须购买Mac的硬件。很少有公司（实际上根本就没有）可以创造并维持一个无法与其他厂家共享的行业标准。”他建议将麦金塔的操作系统授权给坦迪公司。默里认为，坦迪旗下的RadioShack商店拥有的客户群与苹果公司不同，所以不会严重影响苹果产品的销售。但以乔布斯的天性，他必然反对这样的计划。他无法想象自己的完美创作不在自己的控制之下。最终，麦金塔依照乔布斯的标准，仍然作为一个封闭的用户环境存在，但正如默里所担心的，在一个到处都是IBM兼容机的世界里，麦金塔想要守住业界标准的地位将会遭到重重困难。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<h3><a name="s3" id="s3"></a>Machines of the Year</h3>
<p>As 1982 drew to a  close, Jobs came to believe that he was going to be <em>Time</em>’s Man of the  Year. He arrived at Texaco Towers one day with the magazine’s San Francisco  bureau chief, Michael Moritz, and encouraged colleagues to give Moritz  interviews. But Jobs did not end up on the cover. Instead the magazine chose  “the Computer” as the topic for the year-end issue and called it “the Machine  of the Year.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<h3>年度机器</h3>
<p>随着1982年临近尾声，乔布斯开始相信，自己将成为《时代》杂志的“年度人物”。一天，他和《时代》旧金山分部的总编迈克尔·莫里茨一同出现在公司，他还鼓励同事们接受莫里茨的采访。但最终，乔布斯并没有登上该杂志封面。《时代》将“计算机”选为了年终刊的主题，并称之为“年度机器”。</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Accompanying the main  story was a profile of Jobs, which was based on the reporting done by Moritz  and written by Jay Cocks, an editor who usually handled rock music for the  magazine. “With his smooth sales pitch and a blind faith that would have been  the envy of the early Christian martyrs, it is Steven Jobs, more than anyone,  who kicked open the door and let the personal computer move in,” the story  proclaimed. It was a richly reported piece, but also harsh at times—so harsh  that Moritz (after he wrote a book about Apple and went on to be a partner in  the venture firm Sequoia Capital with Don Valentine) repudiated it by  complaining that his reporting had been “siphoned, filtered, and poisoned with  gossipy benzene by an editor in New York whose regular task was to chronicle  the wayward world of rock-and-roll music.” The article quoted Bud Tribble on  Jobs’s “reality distortion field” and noted that he “would occasionally burst  into tears at meetings.” Perhaps the best quote came from Jef Raskin. Jobs, he  declared, “would have made an excellent King of France.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>和主题报道一起的有一篇乔布斯的介绍，是根据莫里茨的报道，由杰伊·科克斯（JayCocks）撰写的，而科克斯以往只是负责摇滚乐信息方面的编辑。文中写道：“他有髙超的推销技巧，他的坚定信仰甚至让早期的基督教殉道者都羡慕不已，正是他——史蒂夫·乔布斯——开启了个人电脑产业。”这是一篇内容十分丰富的文章，但也不乏粗糙之处，以至于莫里茨（在他写了一本关于苹果公司的书，又进入风险投资公司红杉资本和唐·瓦伦丁成为了合伙人之后）驳斥它并抱怨说自己的报道被“一个来自纽约、日常工作是记录摇滚音乐界不羁生活的编辑断章取义，还添加了一些八卦消息”那篇介绍文章中引用了巴德·特里布尔关于乔布斯“现实扭曲力场”的言论，还提到乔布斯“有时候会在会议上突然哭起来”。最精彩的一句引用也许来自杰夫·拉斯金，他说，乔布斯“可以成为杰出的法兰西国王”。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>To Jobs’s dismay, the  magazine made public the existence of the daughter he had forsaken, Lisa  Brennan. He knew that Kottke had been the one to tell the magazine about Lisa,  and he berated him in the Mac group work space in front of a half dozen people.  “When the <em>Time</em> reporter asked me if Steve had a daughter named Lisa, I  said ‘Of course,’” Kottke recalled. “Friends don’t let friends deny that  they’re the father of a child. I’m not going to let my friend be a jerk and  deny paternity. He was really angry and felt violated and told me in front of  everyone that I had betrayed him.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>让乔布斯沮丧的是，杂志公开了一件事情：他有一个被他抛弃的女儿——丽萨·布伦南。就是这篇文章提到了乔布斯说过的那句话：“全美28%的男性都可能是孩子的父亲。”这激怒了克里斯安。乔布斯知道是科特基把丽萨的事情告诉了杂志，他在Mac团队的办公区当着一群人的面痛斥了科特基。“《时代》的记者问我乔布斯是不是有个叫丽萨的女儿，我说当然是。”科特基回忆说，“朋友是不会让朋友否认自己是一个孩子的父亲的。我不会让我的朋友这么混蛋，否认自己是个父亲。他真的很生气，觉得受到了冒犯，然后当着所有人的面说我背叛了他。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>But what truly devastated  Jobs was that he was not, after all, chosen as the Man of the Year. As he later  told me:</p>

<p><em>Time</em> decided they were  going to make me Man of the Year, and I was twenty-seven, so I actually cared  about stuff like that. I thought it was pretty cool. They sent out Mike Moritz  to write a story. We’re the same age, and I had been very successful, and I  could tell he was jealous and there was an edge to him. He wrote this terrible  hatchet job. So the editors in New York get this story and say, “We can’t make  this guy Man of the Year.” That really hurt. But it was a good lesson. It  taught me to never get too excited about things like that, since the media is a  circus anyway. They FedExed me the magazine, and I remember opening the  package, thoroughly expecting to see my mug on the cover, and it was this  computer sculpture thing. I thought, “Huh?” And then I read the article, and it  was so awful that I actually cried.</p>

  <p>In fact there’s no  reason to believe that Moritz was jealous or that he intended his reporting to  be unfair. Nor was Jobs ever slated to be Man of the Year, despite what he  thought. That year the top editors (I was then a junior editor there) decided  early on to go with the computer rather than a person, and they commissioned,  months in advance, a piece of art from the famous sculptor George Segal to be a  gatefold cover image. Ray Cave was then the magazine’s editor. “We never  considered Jobs,” he said. “You couldn’t personify the computer, so that was  the first time we decided to go with an inanimate object. We never searched  around for a face to be put on the cover.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>但真正伤害了乔布斯的是，他终究没能被选为“年度人物”。正如他后来告诉我的：</p>
<p>《时代》已经决定要让我成为“年度人物”了，当时我才27岁，所以我真的很在意这件事，我觉得那很酷。他们派迈克尔·莫里茨来写篇文章。我们两个同龄，而我当时事业已经非常成功了，我能看得出来他很嫉妒，他又恰好掌握了有利条件。所以他写了一篇恶毒诽谤的文章。纽约的编辑们看到这篇文章后说，我们不能让这种人当“年度人物”。这真的让我很伤心。不过也是个很好的教训，它告诉我永远不要为了那样的事情过分激动，因为媒体就像马戏团一样。他们用联邦快递把杂志寄给了我，我记得当时拆开包装的时候，满心希望在封面上看见自己的脸，结果却是个电脑的雕像。我还想：“怎么回事？”然后我看了那篇文章，写得太糟糕了，我真的哭了出来。</p>
<p>事实上，没有理由相信莫里茨当时嫉妒乔布斯，或者故意想进行不公正的报道。乔布斯也从没有被定为“年度人物”，尽管他自己不这么认为。那一年，编辑们（我也在其中，只是资历较浅）早就决定刊登“计算机”而不是某个人了，而且他们提前几个月就委托著名的雕塑家乔治·西格尔（GeorgeSegal）制作一件艺术品，作为折页封面上的图像。雷·凯夫（RayCave）当时是杂志的一名编辑。“我们从没有考虑过乔布斯，”他说，“你无法把电脑比做人，所以那是我们第一次决定选用一个无生命的物体。请西格尔做雕塑是件大事，我们从没有想让某个人出现在封面上。”</p>

<p>Apple launched the  Lisa in January 1983—a full year before the Mac was ready—and Jobs paid his  $5,000 wager to Couch. Even though he was not part of the Lisa team, Jobs went  to New York to do publicity for it in his role as Apple’s chairman and poster  boy.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>1983年1月，苹果公司发布了丽萨电脑——比Mac早了整整一年，乔布斯在和库奇的这场赌局中输掉了5000美元。尽管乔布斯并不是丽萨团队的一员，他还是以董事会主席及形象代言人的身份前往纽约为丽萨作宣传。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>He had learned from  his public relations consultant Regis McKenna how to dole out exclusive  interviews in a dramatic manner. Reporters from anointed publications were  ushered in sequentially for their hour with him in his Carlyle Hotel suite,  where a Lisa computer was set on a table and surrounded by cut flowers. The  publicity plan called for Jobs to focus on the Lisa and not mention the  Macintosh, because speculation about it could undermine the Lisa. But Jobs  couldn’t help himself. In most of the stories based on his interviews that  day—in <em>Time, Business Week</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and <em>Fortune</em>—the  Macintosh was mentioned. “Later this year Apple will introduce a less powerful,  less expensive version of Lisa, the Macintosh,” <em>Fortune</em> reported. “Jobs  himself has directed that project.” <em>Business Week</em> quoted him as saying,  “When it comes out, Mac is going to be the most incredible computer in the  world.” He also admitted that the Mac and the Lisa would not be compatible. It  was like launching the Lisa with the kiss of death.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯从自己的公共关系顾问里吉斯·麦肯纳那里学会了如何以戏剧化的方式限量派发独家专访的机会。来自指定媒体的记者按次序一个个被带进他在卡莱尔酒店的套房，对他进行采访，房间里的桌子上摆着一台丽萨电脑，周围用切花装饰着。宣传计划要求乔布斯专注于介绍丽萨，不要谈及麦金塔，因为对麦金塔的猜测可能损害丽萨的销售。但乔布斯却没能控制住。根据那天对他的采访而写成的大多数报道——包括刊登在《时代》、《商业周刊》、《华尔街日报》以及《财富》上的——都提到了麦金塔。“今年晚些时候，苹果公司将推出一款性能稍弱、售价更低的丽萨版本，即麦金塔电脑。”《财富》报道说，“乔布斯亲自领导那个项目。”《商业周刊》引用了乔布斯的话：“Mac问世后，将成为全世界最不可思议的电脑。”他还坦承Mac和丽萨是无法兼容的。这就像是在发布丽萨的同时给它送上了死亡之吻。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">

<p>The Lisa did indeed  die a slow death. Within two years it would be discontinued. “It was too  expensive, and we were trying to sell it to big companies when our expertise  was selling to consumers,” Jobs later said. But there was a silver lining for  Jobs: Within months of Lisa’s launch, it became clear that Apple had to pin its  hopes on the Macintosh instead.
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>丽萨确实慢慢地消亡了。不到两年，它就停产了。“它太贵了，我们试图把它卖给大公司，但我们擅长的是出售给个人客户。”乔布斯后来说。不过这让乔布斯看到了一线希望：丽萨刚刚面世几个月，有一件事情就很明显了，那就是苹果公司必须把希望寄托在麦金塔身上。

<h3><a name="s4" id="s4"></a>Let’s Be Pirates!</h3>

<p>As the Macintosh team  grew, it moved from Texaco Towers to the main Apple buildings on Bandley Drive,  finally settling in mid-1983 into Bandley 3. It had a modern atrium lobby with  video games, which Burrell Smith and Andy Hertzfeld chose, and a Toshiba  compact disc stereo system with MartinLogan speakers and a hundred CDs. The  software team was visible from the lobby in a fishbowl-like glass enclosure,  and the kitchen was stocked daily with Odwalla juices. Over time the atrium  attracted even more toys, most notably a B?sendorfer piano and a BMW motorcycle  that Jobs felt would inspire an obsession with lapidary craftsmanship.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">



<h3>我们当海盗吧</h3>
<p>随着麦金塔团队的不断扩大，它从德士古塔搬到了位于班德利大道（BandleyDrive）的苹果公司主办公区，并于1983年年中在班德利3号楼安顿下来。那里有一个可以玩电子游戏的现代化中庭大厅，游戏都是由伯勒尔·史密斯和安迪·赫茨菲尔德挑选出来的，还有一套东芝的CD音响系统，配上了马丁·洛根（MartinLogan）扬声器和100张CD光盘。从大厅就能看到软件小组的员工，他们的办公区域被玻璃围住，看上去就像待在鱼缸里一样，厨房里每天都备有Odwalla果汁。逐渐地，中庭里的玩物越来越多，最醒目的就是一架贝森朵夫钢琴和一辆宝马摩托车，乔布斯觉得这些东西可以让员工迷上简洁高雅的工艺风格。</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs kept a tight rein  on the hiring process. The goal was to get people who were creative, wickedly  smart, and slightly rebellious. The software team would make applicants play  Defender, Smith’s favorite video game. Jobs would ask his usual offbeat questions  to see how well the applicant could think in unexpected situations. One day he,  Hertzfeld, and Smith interviewed a candidate for software manager who, it  became clear as soon as he walked in the room, was too uptight and conventional  to manage the wizards in the fishbowl. Jobs began to toy with him mercilessly.  “How old were you when you lost your virginity?” he asked.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯对招聘流程有着严格的控制，目的是招到具有创造力、绝顶聪明又略带叛逆的人才。软件小组会让应聘者玩史密斯最爱的电子游戏守护者（Defender）。乔布斯会问一些他常问的古怪问题，以考验求职者在突发状况下的思维能力，以及他们的幽默感和反抗精神。有一天，他和赫茨菲尔德、史密斯一起，面试一个应聘软件经理的人，这个人一走进来，身上的保守和刻板气质就显露无遗，很明显无法管理鱼缸里的那群天才。乔布斯开始无情地捉弄他。“你是几岁失去童贞的？”乔布斯问。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The candidate looked  baffled. “What did you say?”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>应聘者听得一头雾水。“你说什么？”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>“Are you a virgin?”  Jobs asked. The candidate sat there flustered, so Jobs changed the subject.  “How many times have you taken LSD?” Hertzfeld recalled, “The poor guy was  turning varying shades of red, so I tried to change the subject and asked a  straightforward technical question.” But when the candidate droned on in his  response, Jobs broke in. “Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble,” he said, cracking up  Smith and Hertzfeld.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“你是处男吗？”乔布斯问道。应聘者坐着，显得非常紧张不安，于是乔布斯换了个问题：“你服用过多少次迷幻药？”赫茨菲尔德回忆说：“那个可怜的家伙满脸通红，于是我试图转移话题，问了他一个很直白的技术问题。”但是，当应聘者开始唠唠叨叨地回答问题时，乔布斯打断了他。“咯咯，咯咯，咯咯，咯咯。”他发出这样的声音，让一旁的史密斯和赫茨菲尔德也都笑了起来。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>“I guess I’m not the  right guy,” the poor man said as he got up to leave.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“我想我不适合这份工作。”那个可怜的人说着就起身离开了。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>For all of his  obnoxious behavior, Jobs also had the ability to instill in his team an esprit  de corps. After tearing people down, he would find ways to lift them up and  make them feel that being part of the Macintosh project was an amazing mission.  Every six months he would take most of his team on a two-day retreat at a  nearby resort.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯虽然有很多让人讨厌的行为，但他也能给自己的队伍注入团队精神。在把别人贬得一文不值之后，他又能找到办法激励他们，让他们觉得成为麦金塔项目的一员是一项美妙的任务。每半年，他都会带着团队的大部分人，去附近的一处度假胜地举行为期两天的集思会。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The retreat in  September 1982 was at the Pajaro Dunes near Monterey. Fifty or so members of  the Mac division sat in the lodge facing a fireplace. Jobs sat on top of a  table in front of them. He spoke quietly for a while, then walked to an easel  and began posting his thoughts.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>1982年9月的那次集思会是在蒙特雷附近的帕加罗沙丘（PajaroDunes）进行的。大约50名Mac团队的成员坐在小屋里，面朝着壁炉。乔布斯坐在他们前面的一张桌子上。他小声地说了一会儿话，然后走到一个黑板架旁边，开始贴上自己的想法。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The first was “Don’t  compromise.” It was an injunction that would, over time, be both helpful and  harmful. Most technology teams made trade-offs. The Mac, on the other hand,  would end up being as “insanely great” as Jobs and his acolytes could possibly  make it—but it would not ship for another sixteen months, way behind schedule.  After mentioning a scheduled completion date, he told them, “It would be better  to miss than to turn out the wrong thing.” A different type of project manager,  willing to make some trade-offs, might try to lock in dates after which no  changes could be made. Not Jobs. He displayed another maxim: “It’s not done  until it ships.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>第一条是“决不妥协”。这一条在日后的岁月里被证明是一把双刃剑。大多数的科技团队都会妥协。另一方面，Mac最终成为了乔布斯和他的队伍所能做出的最“完美得不可思议”的产品——但它还需要16个月才能上市，远远晚于计划时间。在提到一个计划中的完工日期后，他告诉他们：“即便错过上市日期，也不能粗制滥造。”换作愿意做出妥协的项目经理的话，也许会敲定一个完工日期，之后不得再作出任何改动。但乔布斯不是这样的人，他的另一句名言就是：“直到上市，产品才能算是完工。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Another chart  contained a koōan-like phrase that he later told me was his favorite maxim:  “The journey is the reward.” The Mac team, he liked to emphasize, was a special  corps with an exalted mission. Someday they would all look back on their  journey together and, forgetting or laughing off the painful moments, would  regard it as a magical high point in their lives.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>另一张纸上有一句公案①—样的短语，他后来告诉我那是他最爱的一旬格言。上面写的是：“过程就是奖励。”他喜欢强调，Mac团队是一支有着崇高使命的特殊队伍。未来的某一天，他们会回顾这段共同度过的时光，对于那些痛苦的时刻，只是过眼云烟，或者付之一笑，他们会把这段时光看做人生中奇妙的巅峰时刻。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>At the end of the  presentation someone asked whether he thought they should do some market  research to see what customers wanted. “No,” he replied, “because customers  don’t know what they want until we’ve shown them.” Then he pulled out a device  that was about the size of a desk diary. “Do you want to see something neat?”  When he flipped it open, it turned out to be a mock-up of a computer that could  fit on your lap, with a keyboard and screen hinged together like a notebook.  “This is my dream of what we will be making in the mid-to late eighties,” he  said. They were building a company that would invent the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>演讲的最后，他问道：“你们想看点儿好东西吗？”然后他拿出了一个曰记本大小的装置。他把装置翻开之后，大家发现那是一台可以放在膝盖上的电脑，键盘和屏幕接合在一起，就像笔记本一样。他说：“这是我的梦想，希望我们能在80年代中晚期造出这种电脑。”他们正在创建一家基业长青的公司，一家开创了未来的公司。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>For the next two days  there were presentations by various team leaders and the influential computer  industry analyst Ben Rosen, with a lot of time in the evenings for pool parties  and dancing. At the end, Jobs stood in front of the assemblage and gave a  soliloquy. “As every day passes, the work fifty people are doing here is going  to send a giant ripple through the universe,” he said. “I know I might be a  little hard to get along with, but this is the most fun thing I’ve done in my  life.” Years later most of those in the audience would be able to laugh about  the “little hard to get along with” episodes and agree with him that creating that  giant ripple was the most fun they had in their lives.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>接下来的两天，各团队的负责人和颇具影响力的计算机行业分析师本·罗森都发表了演讲，晚上的时间就用来举行泳池派对和跳舞。到最后，乔布斯站在众人面前，发表了一番独白。“随着时间的流逝，这里的50个人所做的工作将会对整个世界产生深远的影响。”他说道，“我知道我可能有一点难相处，但这是我一生中做过的最有趣的事情。”多年之后，当时观众中的大多数人想到乔布斯那句“有一点难相处”的场景时都还能笑起来，并且都同意他的说法：能深远地影响世界，是他们一生中最大的乐趣。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The next retreat was  at the end of January 1983, the same month the Lisa launched, and there was a  shift in tone. Four months earlier Jobs had written on his flip chart: “Don’t  compromise.” This time one of the maxims was “Real artists ship.” Nerves were  frayed. Atkinson had been left out of the publicity interviews for the Lisa  launch, and he marched into Jobs’s hotel room and threatened to quit. Jobs  tried to minimize the slight, but Atkinson refused to be mollified. Jobs got  annoyed. “I don’t have time to deal with this now,” he said. “I have sixty  other people out there who are pouring their hearts into the Macintosh, and  they’re waiting for me to start the meeting.” With that he brushed past Atkinson  to go address the faithful.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>接下来的一次集思会是在1983年1月底，丽萨的发布也是在这个月，气氛也有了一些微妙的变化。4个月前，乔布斯在他的挂图中写下了“决不妥协”，这一次他的格言变成了“真正的艺术家要让产品上市”。大家的神经开始紧张起来。阿特金森未能得到在丽萨发布时接受采访的机会，他冲进乔布斯的酒店房间，威胁要辞职。乔布斯努力安抚他，但他根本不吃这一套。乔布斯怒了，“我现在没时间处理这个，”他说，“我还有60个员工全身心投入在麦金塔项目上，他们在等着我去开会呢。”说完他就从阿特金森身旁走过，去给自己的忠实员工们演讲了。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs proceeded to give  a rousing speech in which he claimed that he had resolved the dispute with  McIntosh audio labs to use the Macintosh name. (In fact the issue was still  being negotiated, but the moment called for a bit of the old reality distortion  field.) He pulled out a bottle of mineral water and symbolically christened the  prototype onstage. Down the hall, Atkinson heard the loud cheer, and with a  sigh joined the group. The ensuing party featured skinny-dipping in the pool, a  bonfire on the beach, and loud music that lasted all night, which caused the  hotel, La Playa  in Carmel, to ask them never to come back.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯发表了一通振奋人心的讲话，宣称他已经就使用麦金塔这个名字一事，和麦金托什音频实验室解决了纷争。（事实上，当时此事仍然在谈判之中，但那样的时刻需要乔布斯施展一点现实扭曲力场。）他拿出一瓶矿泉水，象征性地给台上的样机施了洗礼。阿特金森从老远的地方就听到了巨大的欢呼声，他叹了口气，也加入到了人群中。接下来的派对上，有泳池裸泳，有沙滩上的篝火，还有整晚播放的音乐，嘈杂的声音让卡梅尔（Carmel）的海滩酒店（LaPlaya）要求他们再也不要光顾了。几个星期之后，乔布斯设法让阿特金森被评为了“苹果特别员工”，这意味着加薪、获得股票期权以及自己选择项目的权利。此外，公司还同意，当麦金塔启动阿特金森创作的画图程序时，屏幕上都会显示：“MacPaint,作者比尔·阿特金森。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Another of Jobs’s  maxims at the retreat was “It’s better to be a pirate than to join the navy.”  He wanted to instill a rebel spirit in his team, to have them behave like  swashbucklers who were proud of their work but willing to commandeer from  others. As Susan Kare put it, “He meant, ‘Let’s have a renegade feeling to our  group. We can move fast. We can get things done.’” To celebrate Jobs’s birthday  a few weeks later, the team paid for a billboard on the road to Apple  headquarters. It read: “Happy 28th Steve. The Journey is the Reward.—The  Pirates.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>1月份集思会时，乔布斯的另一条著名言论是“当海盗，不要当海军”。他想给自己的团队灌输叛逆精神，让他们像侠盗一样行事：既为自己的工作感到自豪，又愿意去窃取别人。就像苏珊·卡雷说的：“他的意思是，我们的团队里要有一种叛逆的感觉，我们能快速行动，做成事情。”为了庆祝乔布斯几周之后的生日，团队在通往苹果公司总部的马路边买下了一块广告牌，上面写着：史蒂夫，28岁生日快乐。过程就是奖励。—海盗们贺。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>One of the Mac team’s  programmers, Steve Capps, decided this new spirit warranted hoisting a Jolly  Roger. He cut a patch of black cloth and had Kare paint a skull and crossbones  on it. The eye patch she put on the skull was an Apple logo. Late one Sunday  night Capps climbed to the roof of their newly built Bandley 3 building and  hoisted the flag on a scaffolding pole that the construction workers had left  behind. It waved proudly for a few weeks, until members of the Lisa team, in a  late-night foray, stole the flag and sent their Mac rivals a ransom note. Capps  led a raid to recover it and was able to wrestle it from a secretary who was  guarding it for the Lisa team. Some of the grown-ups overseeing Apple worried  that Jobs’s buccaneer spirit was getting out of hand. “Flying that flag was  really stupid,” said Arthur Rock. “It was telling the rest of the company they  were no good.” But Jobs loved it, and he made sure it waved proudly all the way  through to the completion of the Mac project. “We were the renegades, and we  wanted people to know it,” he recalled.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>Mac团队最酷的程序员之一史蒂夫·卡普斯（SteveCapps）认为，需要为这种新的精神升起一面海盗旗。他拿了一块黑布，让卡雷在上面画上了骷髅头和交叉的腿骨。骷髅所戴的眼罩是一个苹果的标志。一个周日的深夜，卡普斯爬到了他们新建好的班德利3号楼的楼顶，在建筑工人留下的一个脚手架支柱上升起了那面海盗旗。这面旗帜髙髙飘扬了几个星期，后来丽萨团队的成员在一次深夜的突袭中偷走了它，并给Mac团队送去了一张索取赎金的通知。卡普斯为了把旗子抢回来，带人突击了丽萨团队，并成功从一个负责看管海盗旗的秘书手中夺回了它。一些心态成熟的人担心乔布斯的海盗精神正在逐渐失控。“升海盗旗这件事真的非常愚麗，”亚瑟·罗克说，“它是在告诉公司的其他人他们不够出色。”但乔布斯喜欢这样，一直到Mac项目完成，他始终让那面海盗旗都飘着。“我们很叛逆，我们想让大家知道这一点。”他回忆说。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Veterans of the Mac  team had learned that they could stand up to Jobs. If they knew what they were  talking about, he would tolerate the pushback, even admire it. By 1983 those  most familiar with his reality distortion field had discovered something  further: They could, if necessary, just quietly disregard what he decreed. If  they turned out to be right, he would appreciate their renegade attitude and  willingness to ignore authority. After all, that’s what he did.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>Mac团队的资深成员意识到，他们可以勇敢地面对乔布斯。如果他们清楚自己在说什么的话，乔布斯就能容忍反对的声音，甚至微笑面对、表达赞赏之情。到1983年，那些最熟悉他现实扭曲力场的人有了进一步的发现：如果必要的话，他们可以不动声色地忽略他的命令。如果事实证明他们是正确的，乔布斯就会欣赏他们的叛逆态度和敢于无视权威的意愿。毕竟，他自己就是这么做的。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>By far the most  important example of this involved the choice of a disk drive for the  Macintosh. Apple had a corporate division that built mass-storage devices, and  it had developed a disk-drive system, code-named Twiggy, that could read and  write onto those thin, delicate 5?-inch floppy disks that older readers (who  also remember Twiggy the model) will recall. But by the time the Lisa was ready  to ship in the spring of 1983, it was clear that the Twiggy was buggy. Because  the Lisa also came with a hard-disk drive, this was not a complete disaster.  But the Mac had no hard disk, so it faced a crisis. “The Mac team was beginning  to panic,” said Hertzfeld. “We were using a single Twiggy drive, and we didn’t  have a hard disk to fall back on.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>迄今为止，乔布斯的叛逆精神影响的最重大的一次事件，是在为麦金塔选择磁盘驱动器这件事上。当时苹果公司有一个部门是生产大容量存储设备的，他们幵发了一套磁盘驱动系统，代号崔姬（Twiggy），它可以读写那些纤薄、精致的5.25英寸软盘，年长一些的读者（那些还记得模特崔姬是谁的人）一定还能回想起那种软盘。但到了1983年春天，丽萨准备上市的时候，崔姬系统的高故障率已经很明显了。因为丽萨还带有一个硬盘驱动器，所以对它来说情况并不算太糟。但Mac没有硬盘，所以它就面临着危机。“Mac团队开始感到惊慌了，”赫茨菲尔德说，“我们只用了一个崔姬系统作为软盘驱动器，又没有硬盘可以备用。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The team discussed the  problem at the January 1983 retreat, and Debi Coleman gave Jobs data about the  Twiggy failure rate. A few days later he drove to Apple’s factory in San Jose  to see the Twiggy being made. More than half were rejected. Jobs erupted. With  his face flushed, he began shouting and sputtering about firing everyone who  worked there. Bob Belleville, the head of the Mac engineering team, gently  guided him to the parking lot, where they could take a walk and talk about  alternatives.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>1983年1月，在卡梅尔的那次度假中，他们讨论了这个问题，黛比·科尔曼把崔姬系统故障率的数据给了乔布斯。几天之后，乔布斯开车来到苹果公司在圣何塞的工厂，视察崔姬的生产过程。生产中的每一个流程，都有超过一半的产品不合格。乔布斯愤怒了。他的脸气得通红，开始咆哮，气急败坏地说要开除那儿所有的员工。Mac工程团队的负责人鲍勃·贝尔维尔平静地把他带到了停车场，在那儿他们一边散步一边讨论替代方案。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>One possibility that  Belleville had been exploring was to use a new 3?-inch disk drive that Sony had  developed. The disk was cased in sturdier plastic and could fit into a shirt  pocket. Another option was to have a clone of Sony’s 3?-inch disk drive  manufactured by a smaller Japanese supplier, the Alps Electronics Co., which  had been supplying disk drives for the Apple II. Alps had already licensed the  technology from Sony, and if they could build their own version in time it  would be much cheaper.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>有一个办法，也是贝尔维尔一直在探索的，就是使用索尼公司刚刚研发的新型3.5英寸磁盘。这种磁盘被包裹在更加牢固的塑料中，并且可以塞进衬衫口袋。还有一个办法，就是使用日本的一家小供应商——阿尔卑斯电子公司（theAlpsElectronicsCo.）生产的索尼3.5英寸磁盘的仿制品，这家公司一直为AppleII供应磁盘驱动器。阿尔卑斯电子公司当时已经获得了索尼的技术授杈，如果他们能及时生产出自家版本的驱动器的话，价格将便宜不少。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs and Belleville,  along with Apple veteran Rod Holt (the guy Jobs enlisted to design the first  power supply for the Apple II), flew to Japan to figure out what to do. They  took the bullet train from Tokyo to visit the Alps facility. The engineers  there didn’t even have a working prototype, just a crude model. Jobs thought it  was great, but Belleville was appalled. There was no way, he thought, that Alps  could have it ready for the Mac within a year.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯和贝尔维尔，以及苹果的资深员工罗德·霍尔特（帮乔布斯设计AppleII第一款电源的人）一起飞到了日本，寻求解决问题的办法。他们从东京乘坐高速列车前往阿尔卑斯电子公司的工厂。那里的工程师甚至连一件可以使用的样机都没有，只有一个未完工的模型。乔布斯觉得不错，但贝尔维尔对这种状况感到震惊。他认为，阿尔卑斯电子公司绝不可能在一年之内将它准备就绪，然后应用到Mac上。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>As they proceeded to  visit other Japanese companies, Jobs was on his worst behavior. He wore jeans  and sneakers to meetings with Japanese managers in dark suits. When they  formally handed him little gifts, as was the custom, he often left them behind,  and he never reciprocated with gifts of his own. He would sneer when rows of  engineers lined up to greet him, bow, and politely offer their products for inspection.  Jobs hated both the devices and the obsequiousness. “What are you showing me <em>this</em> for?” he snapped at one stop. “This is a piece of crap! <em>Anybody</em> could  build a better drive than this.” Although most of his hosts were appalled, some  seemed amused. They had heard tales of his obnoxious style and brash behavior,  and now they were getting to see it in full display.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>他们又接着参观了另外几家日本公司，乔布斯的举止十分粗鲁。他穿着牛仔裤和运动鞋去跟那些穿深色西装的日本经理会面。他们会按照惯例，郑重地递给乔布斯一些小礼物，但这些礼物经常被乔布斯丢在一边，他也从没有回赠礼物给对方。成排的工程师们列队欢迎他，对他鞠躬，然后恭敬地送上自己的产品供他检查，他只会冷笑一声。乔布斯既讨厌他们的产品，又讨厌他们的谄媚。“你绘我看这个干什么？”他在一家工厂的时候厉声问道，“这就是一块垃圾！随便找个人做出来的驱动器都比这个好。”虽然接待方的大多数人都会对他的举止感到震惊，但有一些人似乎被他逗乐了。他们事先听说过关于他令人讨厌的作风和鲁莽行为的故事，现在亲眼见到了。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The final stop was the  Sony factory, located in a drab suburb of Tokyo. To Jobs, it looked messy and  inelegant. A lot of the work was done by hand. He hated it. Back at the hotel,  Belleville argued for going with the Sony disk drive. It was ready to use. Jobs  disagreed. He decided that they would work with Alps to produce their own  drive, and he ordered Belleville to cease all work with Sony.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>参观的最后一站是坐落在东京一处死气沉沉的郊区的索尼工厂。在乔布斯看来，这家工厂很杂乱，要价也很髙，很多工作都是手工完成的。他痛恨这些。回到酒店后，贝尔维尔主张使用索尼的磁盘驱动器，因为它们已经可以直接用到Mac上了。乔布斯不同意，他决定跟阿尔卑斯电子公司合作，生产他们自己的驱动器，同时命令贝尔维尔停止与索尼的一切合作。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Belleville decided it  was best to partially ignore Jobs, and he asked a Sony executive to get its  disk drive ready for use in the Macintosh. If and when it became clear that  Alps could not deliver on time, Apple would switch to Sony. So Sony sent over the  engineer who had developed the drive, Hidetoshi Komoto, a Purdue graduate who  fortunately possessed a good sense of humor about his clandestine task.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>贝尔维尔认为最好在一定程度上忽略掉布斯。他向迈克·马库拉解释了情况，马库拉悄悄告诉他，采取一切必要措施，确保在短时间内准备好一款磁盘驱动器——但是不要告诉乔布斯。贝尔维尔在自己的顶级工程师们的支持下，要求索尼的一名管理人员，让他们的磁盘驱动器准备好应用于麦金塔电脑上。万一阿尔卑斯电子公司无法按时供货，苹果公司就会转用索尼的产品。于是索尼把开发这款驱动器的工程师派到了苹果公司，他就是嘉本秀年（HidetoshiKomoto），毕业于普渡大学，幸运的是，他对于这项秘密任务充满了幽默感。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Whenever Jobs would  come from his corporate office to visit the Mac team’s engineers—which was  almost every afternoon—they would hurriedly find somewhere for Komoto to hide.  At one point Jobs ran into him at a newsstand in Cupertino and recognized him  from the meeting in Japan, but he didn’t suspect anything. The closest call was  when Jobs came bustling onto the Mac work space unexpectedly one day while  Komoto was sitting in one of the cubicles. A Mac engineer grabbed him and  pointed him to a janitorial closet. “Quick, hide in this closet. Please! Now!”  Komoto looked confused, Hertzfeld recalled, but he jumped up and did as told.  He had to stay in the closet for five minutes, until Jobs left. The Mac  engineers apologized. “No problem,” he replied. “But American business  practices, they are very strange. Very strange.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>每当乔布斯离开公司办公室，前去视察Mac团队的工程师的时候——基本上是每天下午——他们都会赶紧找个地方让嘉本藏起来。有一次，乔布斯恰巧在库比蒂诺的一处报刊亭遇到了嘉本并且认出了他，两人在日本见过，但乔布斯并没有起疑心。最险的一次是有一天，乔布斯出人意料地、急匆匆地来到Mac团队的办公区，而当时嘉本正坐在一个办公隔间里。Mac的一名工程师抓起他，指了指清洁间。“快点，躲到里面去。拜托了！现在就去！”赫茨菲尔德回忆说，当时嘉本一脸迷惑，但还是跳起来一头冲进了清洁间。他在里面待了5分钟，直到乔布斯离开。Mac团队的工程师们向他道歉。“没关系，”他回答道，“但美国的商业习惯真是非常奇怪，非常奇怪。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Belleville’s  prediction came true. In May 1983 the folks at Alps admitted it would take them  at least eighteen more months to get their clone of the Sony drive into  production. At a retreat in Pajaro Dunes, Markkula grilled Jobs on what he was  going to do. Finally, Belleville interrupted and said that he might have an  alternative to the Alps drive ready soon. Jobs looked baffled for just a  moment, and then it became clear to him why he’d glimpsed Sony’s top disk  designer in Cupertino. “You son of a bitch!” Jobs said. But it was not in  anger. There was a big grin on his face. As soon as he realized what Belleville  and the other engineers had done behind his back, said Hertzfeld, “Steve  swallowed his pride and thanked them for disobeying him and doing the right  thing.” It was, after all, what he would have done in their situation.</p>
