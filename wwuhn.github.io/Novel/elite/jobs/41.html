<div class="left">  <h3><a name="s1" id="s1"></a>Family Ties</h3>
<p>Jobs had an aching  desire to make it to his son’s graduation from high school in June 2010. “When  I was diagnosed with cancer, I made my deal with God or whatever, which was  that I really wanted to see Reed graduate, and that got me through 2009,” he  said. As a senior, Reed looked eerily like his father at eighteen, with a  knowing and slightly rebellious smile, intense eyes, and a shock of dark hair.  But from his mother he had inherited a sweetness and painfully sensitive  empathy that his father lacked. He was demonstrably affectionate and eager to  please. Whenever his father was sitting sullenly at the kitchen table and  staring at the floor, which happened often when he was ailing, the only thing  sure to cause his eyes to brighten was Reed walking in.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><h3>家庭纽带</h3>

<p>乔布斯一直热切盼望着参加2010年6月儿子的高中毕业典礼。“当我被诊断出患有癌症时，我跟上帝做了笔交易——无论如何，我一定要看到里德毕业，这个信念支撑我挺过了2009年。”他说。已经读高中四年级的里德，跟他父亲18岁的时候惊人地相似，那洞察一切又略带叛逆的微笑，那专注的眼神，还有那一头浓密的深色头发。但里德也从母亲那儿继承了对人友善和极富同情心的特质，而这却是他父亲所不具备的。他感情丰富，愿意与人为善。每当乔布斯身体不适时，常常闷闷不乐地坐在厨房的餐桌前盯着地板发呆，这时，唯一能让他眼前一売的就是看见里德走进来。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Reed adored his  father. Soon after I started working on this book, he dropped in to where I was  staying and, as his father often did, suggested we take a walk. He told me,  with an intensely earnest look, that his father was not a cold profit-seeking  businessman but was motivated by a love of what he did and a pride in the  products he was making.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>里德深爱着他的父亲。就在我开始写作本书不久，他来到我的住处，像他父亲经常做的那样，提议我们出去散步。他热切地告诉我，他父亲不是一个唯利是图的冷酷商人，他的动力来源于他对事业的热爱和对苹果产品的自豪。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>After Jobs was  diagnosed with cancer, Reed began spending his summers working in a Stanford  oncology lab doing DNA sequencing to find genetic markers for colon cancer. In  one experiment, he traced how mutations go through families. “One of the very  few silver linings about me getting sick is that Reed’s gotten to spend a lot  of time studying with some very good doctors,” Jobs said. “His enthusiasm for  it is exactly how I felt about computers when I was his age. I think the  biggest innovations of the twenty-first century will be the intersection of  biology and technology. A new era is beginning, just like the digital one was  when I was his age.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯被诊断出患有癌症后，里德开始去斯坦福的肿瘤学实验室做暑期实习，通过DNA排序去寻找结肠癌的基因标志。在一次实验中，他追踪到了基因变异如何在家庭成员间传播。“我病了以后，能让我感到一丝安慰的极少事情之一，就是里德可以有很多时间跟一些优秀的医生一起作研究。”乔布斯说，“他对此表现出的热情正像我在他这个年龄时对计算机的那种热情。我认为21世纪最大的创新将是生物学与技术的结合。一个新的时代正拉开序幕，就像我在他的年龄时，数字时代正拉开序幕。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Reed used his cancer  study as the basis for the senior report he presented to his class at Crystal  Springs Uplands School. As he described how he used centrifuges and dyes to  sequence the DNA of tumors, his father sat in the audience beaming, along with  the rest of his family. “I fantasize about Reed getting a house here in Palo  Alto with his family and riding his bike to work as a doctor at Stanford,” Jobs  said afterward.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>里德以他的癌症研究为基础，在他水晶泉高地中学（CrystalSpringsUplandsSchool）的班级做了高年级报告。当他描述着如何用离心机和染色法做肿瘤的DNA排序时，他的父亲和其他家人一起坐在观众席中，面带微笑。“我幻想着将来里德和他的家人住在帕洛奥图这儿的一栋房子里，他在斯坦福做医生，每天骑着自行车去上班。”乔布斯后来说。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Reed had grown up fast  in 2009, when it looked as if his father was going to die. He took care of his  younger sisters while his parents were in Memphis, and he developed a  protective paternalism. But when his father’s health stabilized in the spring  of 2010, he regained his playful, teasing personality. One day during dinner he  was discussing with his family where to take his girlfriend for dinner. His  father suggested Il Fornaio, an elegant standard in Palo Alto, but Reed said he  had been unable to get reservations. “Do you want me to try?” his father asked.  Reed resisted; he wanted to handle it himself. Erin, the somewhat shy middle  child, suggested that she could outfit a tepee in their garden and she and Eve,  the younger sister, would serve them a romantic meal there. Reed stood up and  hugged her. He would take her up on that some other time, he promised.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>2009年，当乔布斯看似不久于人世时，里德迅速成熟起来。父母在孟菲斯时，他照顾着两个妹妹，已经颇具家长风范。不过等到2010年春天他父亲的健康状况稳定下来后，他就又恢复了爱打趣调侃的个性。一天吃晚饭时，他跟家人讨论带女朋友去哪儿共进晚餐。他父亲建议去伊尔弗纳奥餐厅（IlFornaio），那是帕洛奥图髙级餐厅的代表，但是里德说他没订到位子。“你想让我试试吗？”他父亲问。里德拒绝了，他想自己解决。生性有点儿羞涩、在家排行老二的埃琳建议说她可以在家里花园中搭一个帐篷，她和妹妹伊芙可以在那儿为他们奉上一顿浪漫的晚餐。里德站起来拥抱了她，承诺说改天一定要享用一下。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>One Saturday Reed was  one of the four contestants on his school’s Quiz Kids team competing on a local  TV station. The family—minus Eve, who was in a horse show—came to cheer him on.  As the television crew bumbled around getting ready, his father tried to keep  his impatience in check and remain inconspicuous among the parents sitting in  the rows of folding chairs. But he was clearly recognizable in his trademark  jeans and black turtleneck, and one woman pulled up a chair right next to him  and started to take his picture. Without looking at her, he stood up and moved  to the other end of the row. When Reed came on the set, his nameplate  identified him as “Reed Powell.” The host asked the students what they wanted  to be when they grew up. “A cancer researcher,” Reed answered.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>一个周六，里德作为学校“神童”（QuizKids）团队的四名选手之一，参加了一家当地电视台举行的比赛。除了去参加马术表演的伊芙，全家人都来给他加油。在电视台的工作人员乱糟糟地作准备时，他父亲努力控制着自己不耐烦的情绪，坐在摆着一排排折叠椅的家长席中，尽量不引人注意。但是他穿着标志性的牛仔裤和黑色套头衫，很容易被认出来，一个女人直接拉了把椅子坐到他旁边开始给他拍照。乔布斯没有看她，姑起身挪到了那排座位的另一端。当里德上场时，他的姓名牌上写的名字是“里德·鲍威尔”。主持人问学生们长大以后想做什么。“研究癌症。”里德回答说。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs drove his  two-seat Mercedes SL55, taking Reed, while his wife followed in her own car  with Erin. On the way home, she asked Erin why she thought her father refused  to have a license plate on his car. “To be a rebel,” she answered. I later put  the question to Jobs. “Because people follow me sometimes, and if I have a  license plate, they can track down where I live,” he replied. “But that’s kind  of getting obsolete now with Google Maps. So I guess, really, it’s just because  I don’t.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>比赛结束后，乔布斯开着他的双人座奔驰SL55，带着里德，妻子鲍威尔开着自己的车，带着埃琳，紧随其后。在回家路上，鲍威尔问埃琳对爸爸拒绝给他的车挂牌照怎么想。“叛逆呗。”埃琳回答说。后来我问了乔布斯这个问题。“因为人们有时候会跟踪我，如果我有牌照，他们会跟到我家来，”他回答说，“但现在有了谷歌地图，这种说法也就不成立了。所以我想，实际上，没有就是没有吧。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>During Reed’s graduation  ceremony, his father sent me an email from his iPhone that simply exulted,  “Today is one of my happiest days. Reed is graduating from High School. Right  now. And, against all odds, I am here.” That night there was a party at their  house with close friends and family. Reed danced with every member of his  family, including his father. Later Jobs took his son out to the barnlike  storage shed to offer him one of his two bicycles, which he wouldn’t be riding  again. Reed joked that the Italian one looked a bit too gay, so Jobs told him  to take the solid eight-speed next to it. When Reed said he would be indebted,  Jobs answered, “You don’t need to be indebted, because you have my DNA.” A few  days later <em>Toy Story 3</em> opened. Jobs had nurtured this Pixar trilogy from  the beginning, and the final installment was about the emotions surrounding the  departure of Andy for college. “I wish I could always be with you,” Andy’s  mother says. “You always will be,” he replies.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>在里德的髙中毕业典礼上，乔布斯用iPhone给我写了一封邮件，得意地说，“今天是我最快乐的一天。里德就要髙中毕业了，就是现在。我把一切杂务都拋开了，就在现场。”当晚一些好朋友和家人在他家举行了派对。里德跟每个家庭成员都跳了舞，包括他父亲。之后，乔布斯把儿子带到仓库，让儿子从他的两辆自行车里挑一辆，他觉得自己不会再骑了。里德开玩笑说那辆意大利的看起来有点儿颜色太鲜艳，所以乔布斯让他选旁边那辆结实的8速自行车。当里德说他很感激时，乔布斯回答说：“你不用感激，因为你有我的DNA。”不久以后，《玩具总动员3》公映。对于皮克斯的这一三部曲，乔布斯从一开始就精心培育，而最后这一部是围绕着安迪离开家去上大学的种种感情故事。“我真希望我能永远和你在一起。”安迪的妈妈说。“你永远都在。”安迪回答。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs’s relationship  with his two younger daughters was somewhat more distant. He paid less  attention to Erin, who was quiet, introspective, and seemed not to know exactly  how to handle him, especially when he was emitting wounding barbs. She was a  poised and attractive young woman, with a personal sensitivity more mature than  her father’s. She thought that she might want to be an architect, perhaps  because of her father’s interest in the field, and she had a good sense of  design. But when her father was showing Reed the drawings for the new Apple  campus, she sat on the other side of the kitchen, and it seemed not to occur to  him to call her over as well. Her big hope that spring of 2010 was that her  father would take her to the Oscars. She loved the movies. Even more, she  wanted to fly with her father on his private plane and walk up the red carpet  with him. Powell was quite willing to forgo the trip and tried to talk her  husband into taking Erin. But he dismissed the idea.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯跟他两个小女儿的关系就稍显疏远。他对埃琳的关注更少，埃琳比较安静内向，似乎不知该怎么跟他相处，尤其是当他语出伤人的时候。她是个淡定而有魅力的少女，有种比她父亲更成熟的敏感。她认为自己可以成为一名建筑师，也许是因为她父亲对这个领域的兴趣使然，而且她对设计有很好的感觉。但是当她父亲给里德看新苹果园区的设计图时，她就坐在厨房的另一边，似乎她父亲并没有想到要叫她过去一起看。2010年春天她最大的愿望是让她父亲带她去参加奥斯卡颁奖典礼。她热爱电影。不仅如此，她还想跟父亲一道乘他的私人飞机去，而且跟他一起走红地毬。鲍威尔自己愿意放弃这次奥斯卡之旅，并试图说服乔布斯帯埃琳去。但是他否定了这个想法。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>At one point as I was  finishing this book, Powell told me that Erin wanted to give me an interview.  It’s not something that I would have requested, since she was then just turning  sixteen, but I agreed. The point Erin emphasized was that she understood why  her father was not always attentive, and she accepted that. “He does his best to  be both a father and the CEO of Apple, and he juggles those pretty well,” she  said. “Sometimes I wish I had more of his attention, but I know the work he’s  doing is very important and I think it’s really cool, so I’m fine. I don’t  really need more attention.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>有一次，在我的写作快要完成的时候，鲍威尔告诉我埃琳想让我对她进行采访。我本来自己是不会提出这种要求的，因为她那时刚满16岁，但是我同意了。埃琳强调的观点是，她理解为什么她父亲不能经常给予她关注，而且她也能接受。“他既要做父亲又要做苹果公司的CEO，已经尽了全力，而且还兼顾得不错。”她说，“有时候我也希望能得到他更多的关注，但是我知道他的工作非常重要，而且我觉得那很醅，所以我没问题。我也不太需要更多的关心。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs had promised to  take each of his children on a trip of their choice when they became teenagers.  Reed chose to go to Kyoto, knowing how much his father was entranced by the Zen  calm of that beautiful city. Not surprisingly, when Erin turned thirteen, in  2008, she chose Kyoto as well. Her father’s illness caused him to cancel the  trip, so he promised to take her in 2010, when he was better. But that June he  decided he didn’t want to go. Erin was crestfallen but didn’t protest. Instead  her mother took her to France with family friends, and they rescheduled the  Kyoto trip for July.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯曾许诺，在每个孩子13岁以后都会带他们去他们自己选择的地方旅行一次。里德选择了京都，他知道他父亲对那座美丽的城市散发出来的禅意有多么迷恋。在埃琳2008年满13岁时，她同样选择了京都。然而乔布斯的病情迫使他取消了那次旅行，他答应等他好一些，2010年再带她去。但是等到2010年6月他又不想去了。埃琳为此垂头丧气，伹并没有抗议。她母亲带她跟一些朋友一起去了法国，把京都的旅行改到了7月。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Powell worried that  her husband would again cancel, so she was thrilled when the whole family took  off in early July for Kona Village, Hawaii, which was the first leg of the trip.  But in Hawaii Jobs developed a bad toothache, which he ignored, as if he could  will the cavity away. The tooth collapsed and had to be fixed. Then the iPhone  4 antenna crisis hit, and he decided to rush back to Cupertino, taking Reed  with him. Powell and Erin stayed in Hawaii, hoping that Jobs would return and  continue with the plans to take them to Kyoto.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>鲍威尔担心丈夫会再次取消，所以当全家在7月初飞到夏威夷康娜度假村时，她激动不已，因为这是去京都旅行的第一步。可是在夏威夷乔布斯患上严重的牙痛，他没在意，就好像他单凭意志就能让蛀牙消失一样。结果那颗牙坏掉了，必须要补。再之后就发生了iPhone4的天线危机，他决定带着里德赶回库比蒂诺。鲍威尔和埃琳留在了夏威夷，希望乔布斯能回来继续按计划带她们去京都。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>To their relief, and  mild surprise, Jobs actually did return to Hawaii after his press conference to  pick them up and take them to Japan. “It’s a miracle,” Powell told a friend.  While Reed took care of Eve back in Palo Alto, Erin and her parents stayed at  the Tawaraya Ryokan, an inn of sublime simplicity that Jobs loved. “It was  fantastic,” Erin recalled.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>让大家都松了一口气但又略为惊讶的是，乔布斯在新闻发布会后真的回到了夏威夷，接上她们一起去了日本。“这真是个奇迹。”鲍威尔跟一个朋友说。里德在帕洛奥图家里照顾伊芙，埃琳跟父母一起住在俵屋旅馆（TawarayaRyokan），乔布斯喜欢这家酒店的极简风格。“那儿真是美妙极了。”埃琳回忆说。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Twenty years earlier  Jobs had taken Erin’s half-sister, Lisa Brennan-Jobs, to Japan when she was  about the same age. Among her strongest memories was sharing with him  delightful meals and watching him, usually such a picky eater, savor unagi  sushi and other delicacies. Seeing him take joy in eating made Lisa feel  relaxed with him for the first time. Erin recalled a similar experience: “Dad  knew where he wanted to go to lunch every day. He told me he knew an incredible  soba shop, and he took me there, and it was so good that it’s been hard to ever  eat soba again because nothing comes close.” They also found a tiny  neighborhood sushi restaurant, and Jobs tagged it on his iPhone as “best sushi  I’ve ever had.” Erin agreed.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>20年前，乔布斯曾带着埃琳同父异母的姐姐丽萨·布伦南-乔布斯来到日本，当时她差不多就是埃琳这个年龄。最让丽萨难忘的就是跟父亲一起分享美食，看着这个以往对食物那么挑剔的人品尝鳗鱼寿司和其他佳肴。看到他吃得那么快乐，丽萨第一次感觉到跟他在一起很放松。埃琳也回忆了类似的经历：“爸爸确切地知道他每天中午想去哪儿吃午饭。他告诉我他知道一家超级美味的荞麦面馆，他带我去那儿，真是太好吃了，结果后来就很难再吃荞麦面，因为其他地方都做不出那种味道。”他们还发现附近有一家小小的寿司店，乔布斯在他的iPhone上给它加的标签是“我吃过的最棒的寿司”。埃琳也有同感。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>They also visited  Kyoto’s famous Zen Buddhist temples; the one Erin loved most was Saihō-ji,  known as the “moss temple” because of its Golden Pond surrounded by gardens  featuring more than a hundred varieties of moss. “Erin was really really happy,  which was deeply gratifying and helped improve her relationship with her  father,” Powell recalled. “She deserved that.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>他们还参观了京都有名的佛教禅宗寺庙。埃琳最喜欢的是西芳寺（Saiho-ji），也被称为“苔寺”，因为在它金色池塘周围的花园里生长着100多种苔藓。“埃琳真的非常高兴，这让人备感欣慰，也帮助改善了她和她爸爸之间的关系。”鲍威尔回忆说，“那是她应得的。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Their younger  daughter, Eve, was quite a different story. She was spunky, self-assured, and  in no way intimidated by her father. Her passion was horseback riding, and she  became determined to make it to the Olympics. When a coach told her how much  work it would require, she replied, “Tell me exactly what I need to do. I will  do it.” He did, and she began diligently following the program.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>他们的小女儿伊芙就是另一回事了。她有勇气，有自信，绝不会被她父亲吓倒。她热爱骑马，而且决心要骑到奧运会上去。当一个教练告诉她那将需要很多努力时，她回答说：“准确地告诉我我需要做些什么。我会去做。”教练告诉了她后，她就开始勤奋地遵照课程去训练。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Eve was an expert at  the difficult task of pinning her father down; she often called his assistant  at work directly to make sure something got put on his calendar. She was also  pretty good as a negotiator. One weekend in 2010, when the family was planning  a trip, Erin wanted to delay the departure by half a day, but she was afraid to  ask her father. Eve, then twelve, volunteered to take on the task, and at  dinner she laid out the case to her father as if she were a lawyer before the  Supreme Court. Jobs cut her off—“No, I don’t think I want to”—but it was clear  that he was more amused than annoyed. Later that evening Eve sat down with her  mother and deconstructed the various ways that she could have made her case  better.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>要搞定她父亲很难，但伊芙精于此道。她常常给他的助理直接打电话，确保把某件事记入他的日程。她还是个相当不错的谈判专家。2010年的一个周末，一家人正在规划一次旅行，埃琳希望推迟半天出发，但又不敢跟父亲讲。当时只有12岁的伊芙自告奋勇承担了这个任务，晚餐时，她有条有理地向父亲提出这个请求，俨然一位正在最髙法院陈辞申辩的律师。乔布斯打断了她说：“不行，我不想那样。”但是很显然，他更多是觉得好玩而不是厌烦。晚上伊芙还跟妈妈一起分析了多种可以促成她的提案的方法。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs came to  appreciate her spirit—and see a lot of himself in her. “She’s a pistol and has  the strongest will of any kid I’ve ever met,” he said. “It’s like payback.” He  had a deep understanding of her personality, perhaps because it bore some  resemblance to his. “Eve is more sensitive than a lot of people think,” he  explained. “She’s so smart that she can roll over people a bit, so that means  she can alienate people, and she finds herself alone. She’s in the process of  learning how to be who she is, but tempers it around the edges so that she can  have the friends that she needs.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯开始欣赏伊芙的这种精神——而且在她身上看到了很多自己的影子。“她是个炮筒子，比我见过的任何孩子都要倔犟。”他说，“像是报应一样。”他非常理解她的个性，可能因为跟他自己很相像。“伊芙要比很多人想象的敏感得多。”他解释说，“她太聪明了，她比别人强，意味着她可以疏远别人，结果发现自己没什么朋友。她还在学习怎样做她自己，但同时也需要磨磨棱角，这样才能得到她需要的朋友。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs’s relationship  with his wife was sometimes complicated but always loyal. Savvy and  compassionate, Laurene Powell was a stabilizing influence and an example of his  ability to compensate for some of his selfish impulses by surrounding himself  with strong-willed and sensible people. She weighed in quietly on business  issues, firmly on family concerns, and fiercely on medical matters. Early in  their marriage, she cofounded and launched College Track, a national  after-school program that helps disadvantaged kids graduate from high school  and get into college. Since then she had become a leading force in the  education reform movement. Jobs professed an admiration for his wife’s work:  “What she’s done with College Track really impresses me.” But he tended to be  generally dismissive of philanthropic endeavors and never visited her  after-school centers.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯跟妻子的关系有时很复杂，但彼此忠诚。劳伦·鮑威尔是个善解人意、富有同情心的人，对乔布斯而言，她是一个稳定的力量，这也说明乔布斯可以通过自己周围集结一些意志坚定、通情达理的人来弥补他的自私冲动。她静静地参与公事，坚定地照顾家事，犀利地处理医疗事务。在他们刚结婚的时候，她和别人一起创办了一个全国性的校外项目——直通大学（CollegeTrack），帮助家境困难的孩子读完高中考入大学。从那时起，她就成为了教育改革运动的领导力量。乔布斯很欣赏妻子的工作：“她在直通大学做的事情让我印象深刻。”但他总体上还是不太看得上慈善事业，也从未去过她的校外活动中心。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>In February 2010 Jobs  celebrated his fifty-fifth birthday with just his family. The kitchen was  decorated with streamers and balloons, and his kids gave him a red-velvet toy  crown, which he wore. Now that he had recovered from a grueling year of health  problems, Powell hoped that he would become more attentive to his family. But  for the most part he resumed his focus on his work. “I think it was hard on the  family, especially the girls,” she told me. “After two years of him being ill,  he finally gets a little better, and they expected he would focus a bit on  them, but he didn’t.” She wanted to make sure, she said, that both sides of his  personality were reflected in this book and put into context. “Like many great  men whose gifts are extraordinary, he’s not extraordinary in every realm,” she  said. “He doesn’t have social graces, such as putting himself in other people’s  shoes, but he cares deeply about empowering humankind, the advancement of  humankind, and putting the right tools in their hands.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>2010年2月，乔布斯跟家人一起庆祝了55岁生日。厨房装饰了彩带和气球，孩子们给了他一顶红丝绒的玩具王冠，他真的戴上了。既然他已经从折磨了他一年的病痛中康复了，鲍威尔希望他能对家庭更加关心。但是在很大程度上，他又恢复了对工作的关注。“我觉得那对家人来说，尤其是对女儿们来说，很难以接受，”她告诉我，“病了两年之后，他终于好了一点儿，孩子们期待他能够更关注他们，但是他没有。”她说她希望，他人格的两方面都能够在本书中得到反映，而且不能断章取义。“跟很多有非凡天分的人一样，他并不是在所有方面都同样优秀。”她说，“他没有社交风度，不会设身处地替别人着想，但是他髙度关注如何发挥人性的作用为人类造福，如何使人类进步，并给人类创造正确的工具去追求进步。”</p></div></div>

 

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><h3><a name="s2" id="s2"></a>President Obama</h3>
<p>On a trip to  Washington in the early fall of 2010, Powell had met with some of her friends  at the White House who told her that President Obama was going to Silicon  Valley that October. She suggested that he might want to meet with her husband.  Obama’s aides liked the idea; it fit into his new emphasis on competitiveness.  In addition, John Doerr, the venture capitalist who had become one of Jobs’s  close friends, had told a meeting of the President’s Economic Recovery Advisory  Board about Jobs’s views on why the United States was losing its edge. He too  suggested that Obama should meet with Jobs. So a half hour was put on the  president’s schedule for a session at the Westin San Francisco Airport.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><h3>奥巴马总统</h3>

<p>2010年初秋，在去华盛顿的一次旅行中，鲍威尔见到了白宫的一些朋友，他们告诉她，奥巴马总统将于10月访问硅谷。鲍威尔建议，总统或许愿意跟她丈夫见上一面。奥巴马的助手们喜欢这个想法，认为这种安排也跟总统新近对竞争力的关注很契合。另外，风险投资家、乔布斯的好朋友约翰·多尔之前曾经在总统经济复苏顾问委员会的一次会议上，谈到了乔布斯关于为什么美国在失去竞争优势的观点。他也建议奥巴马应该跟乔布斯会面。所以，总统的行程上被留出了半个小时的时间，安排在旧金山机场的威斯汀酒店见面。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>There was one problem:  When Powell told her husband, he said he didn’t want to do it. He was annoyed  that she had arranged it behind his back. “I’m not going to get slotted in for  a token meeting so that he can check off that he met with a CEO,” he told her.  She insisted that Obama was “really psyched to meet with you.” Jobs replied  that if that were the case, then Obama should call and personally ask for the  meeting. The standoff went on for five days. She called in Reed, who was at  Stanford, to come home for dinner and try to persuade his father. Jobs finally  relented.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>然而问题是，当鲍威尔告诉丈夫这个安排时，他说他不想去。乔布斯对她背着他安排了这件事感到不悦。“我不想被安插进一个象征性的会谈，就为了他可以勾上一个行程说他见了一个CEO。”他告诉她。鲍威尔坚持说奥巴马真的很想见到你”。乔布斯回答说如果真是那样，奥巴马应该亲自打电话来提出邀请。这个僵局持续了5天。她把在斯坦福上学的里德叫回家来吃饭，试图让他劝说父亲。乔布斯最后态度软了下来。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The meeting actually  lasted forty-five minutes, and Jobs did not hold back. “You’re headed for a  one-term presidency,” Jobs told Obama at the outset. To prevent that, he said,  the administration needed to be a lot more business-friendly. He described how  easy it was to build a factory in China, and said that it was almost impossible  to do so these days in America, largely because of regulations and unnecessary  costs.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>这次会谈实际上持续了45分钟，乔布斯说话丝毫不留情面。“看你的架势，你就想当一届总统吧。”一开场乔布斯就这样对奥巴马说。否则，他说，奥巴马政府应该对企业更友好一些。他描述了在中国建一家工厂有多么容易，而这在现在的美国几乎不可能做成，主要是由于监管和不必要的成本。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs also attacked  America’s education system, saying that it was hopelessly antiquated and  crippled by union work rules. Until the teachers’ unions were broken, there was  almost no hope for education reform. Teachers should be treated as  professionals, he said, not as industrial assembly-line workers. Principals  should be able to hire and fire them based on how good they were. Schools  should be staying open until at least 6 p.m. and be in session eleven months of  the year. It was absurd, he added, that American classrooms were still based on  teachers standing at a board and using textbooks. All books, learning materials,  and assessments should be digital and interactive, tailored to each student and  providing feedback in real time.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯还抨击了美国的教育体系，说它陈旧得毫无希望，而且被工会制度掣肘。在教师工会瓦解前，几乎没有希望进行教育改革。他说，教师应该被当做专业人员对待，而不是工厂组装生产线上的工人。校长应该有权力根据教师的水平聘用或解雇他们。学校应该一直开到至少下午6点，一年应该开放11个月。他还说，非常奇怪美国的教室里依然是老师站在讲台上用教科书讲课。所有的书、学习资料和测试都应该是数字化的，而且是互动的，为每个学生专门定制，并提供实时反馈。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs offered to put  together a group of six or seven CEOs who could really explain the innovation  challenges facing America, and the president accepted. So Jobs made a list of  people for a Washington meeting to be held in December. Unfortunately, after  Valerie Jarrett and other presidential aides had added names, the list had  expanded to more than twenty, with GE’s Jeffrey Immelt in the lead. Jobs sent  Jarrett an email saying it was a bloated list and he had no intention of  coming. In fact his health problems had flared anew by then, so he would not  have been able to go in any case, as Doerr privately explained to the  president.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯主动提出要组织一个会议，找六七个真正能解读美国所面临的创新挑战的CEO来，总统接受了这个建议。乔布斯起草了一份名单，计划12月在华盛顿开会。不过，在瓦莱丽·贾勒特（ValerieJarrett）和总统的其他助理添加了一些人名后，这个名单就扩充到了20多人，以通用电气总裁杰弗里·伊梅尔特（JefferyImmelt）为首。乔布斯给贾勒特发了封邮件说，这个名单过于冗长，他不打算去了。事实上他的健康那时又突然出现问题了，因此他本来也无法参加，多尔也私下里向总统作出了解释。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>In February 2011, Doerr  began making plans to host a small dinner for President Obama in Silicon  Valley. He and Jobs, along with their wives, went to dinner at Evvia, a Greek  restaurant in Palo Alto, to draw up a tight guest list. The dozen chosen tech  titans included Google’s Eric Schmidt, Yahoo’s Carol Bartz, Facebook’s Mark  Zuckerberg, Cisco’s John Chambers, Oracle’s Larry Ellison, Genentech’s Art  Levinson, and Netflix’s Reed Hastings. Jobs’s attention to the details of the  dinner extended to the food. Doerr sent him the proposed menu, and he responded  that some of the dishes proposed by the caterer—shrimp, cod, lentil salad—were  far too fancy “and not who you are, John.” He particularly objected to the  dessert that was planned, a cream pie tricked out with chocolate truffles, but  the White House advance staff overruled him by telling the caterer that the  president liked cream pie. Because Jobs had lost so much weight that he was  easily chilled, Doerr kept the house so warm that Zuckerberg found himself  sweating profusely.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>2011年2月，多尔开始筹备在硅谷为奥巴马总统举行一个小型晚宴。他跟乔布斯以及夫人们一起去帕洛奥图一家希腊餐厅埃维亚（Ewia）吃饭，并为这场晚宴拟定一个小范围的来宾名单。被选中的科技巨头包括谷歌的埃里克·施密特、雅虎的卡罗尔·巴茨（CarolBartz）、Facebook的马克·扎克伯格、思科（Cisco）的约翰·钱伯斯（JohnChambers）、甲骨文的拉里·埃利森、基因泰克的亚瑟·莱文森和奈飞公司（Netflix）的里德·哈斯廷斯（ReedHastings）。乔布斯对这次晚宴细节的关注延伸到了食物。多尔给他发了建议的菜单，他回复说餐厅建议的几道菜——虾、鳕鱼、扁豆沙拉——太过花哨，“而且不是你的风格啊，约翰。”他尤其反对菜单中的甜点——用松露巧克力装饰的奶油派，但是白宫的先遣人员驳回了他的意见，吿诉餐厅，总统喜欢奶油派。由于乔布斯过于消痩，很怕冷，多尔把室温调得很髙，以致扎克伯格大汗淋漓。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs, sitting next to  the president, kicked off the dinner by saying, “Regardless of our political  persuasions, I want you to know that we’re here to do whatever you ask to help  our country.” Despite that, the dinner initially became a litany of suggestions  of what the president could do for the businesses there. Chambers, for example,  pushed a proposal for a repatriation tax holiday that would allow major  corporations to avoid tax payments on overseas profits if they brought them  back to the United States for investment during a certain period. The president  was annoyed, and so was Zuckerberg, who turned to Valerie Jarrett, sitting to  his right, and whispered, “We should be talking about what’s important to the  country. Why is he just talking about what’s good for him?”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯坐在总统旁边，作了如下开场白：“无论我们的政治理念是什么，我希望你了解，我们来这儿是为了做任何你要求的事情来帮助我们的国家。尽管如此，晚宴从一开始就变成CEO们没完没了地建议总统可以为他们的企业做些什么。比如钱伯斯就强烈建议推行海外报税优惠政策——大型企业如果在某个时期内把在海外获取的利润拿回美国投资，就可以免税。总统听得很烦，扎克伯格也是，他转身跟坐在他右边的瓦莱丽·贾勒特小声说：“我们应该讨论什么对国家是重要的。为什么他只是说什么对他有利？”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Doerr was able to  refocus the discussion by calling on everyone to suggest a list of action  items. When Jobs’s turn came, he stressed the need for more trained engineers  and suggested that any foreign students who earned an engineering degree in the  United States should be given a visa to stay in the country. Obama said that  could be done only in the context of the “Dream Act,” which would allow illegal  aliens who arrived as minors and finished high school to become legal  residents—something that the Republicans had blocked. Jobs found this an  annoying example of how politics can lead to paralysis. “The president is very  smart, but he kept explaining to us reasons why things can’t get done,” he  recalled. “It infuriates me.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>多尔把讨论拉回到主题，让每人都建议一些切实可行的方案。轮到乔布斯时，他强调需要有更多训练有素的工程师，建议对任何在美国拿到工程学位的外国留学生都应该发给签证，让他们留在美国。奥巴马说那只有在《梦想法案》（DreamAct）的范围内才会实现。该法案允许小时候非法移民到美国的外国人在高中毕业后成为合法居民——这曾经是共和党政府禁止的。乔布斯觉得这正体现了政治是如何导致社会瘫痪的。“总统是个聪明人，可是他一直在向我们解释为什么事情做不成，”他回忆说，“把我气坏了。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs went on to urge  that a way be found to train more American engineers. Apple had 700,000 factory  workers employed in China, he said, and that was because it needed 30,000  engineers on-site to support those workers. “You can’t find that many in  America to hire,” he said. These factory engineers did not have to be PhDs or  geniuses; they simply needed to have basic engineering skills for  manufacturing. Tech schools, community colleges, or trade schools could train  them. “If you could educate these engineers,” he said, “we could move more  manufacturing plants here.” The argument made a strong impression on the  president. Two or three times over the next month he told his aides, “We’ve got  to find ways to train those 30,000 manufacturing engineers that Jobs told us  about.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯继续敦促要找到一种方式培养更多的美国工程师。他说，苹果在中国的工厂雇用了70万名工人，需要3万名工程师去支持这些工人。“你在美国雇不到那么多工程师。”他说。这些工厂的工程师不必是博士或天才；他们只需要掌握基本的制造业工程技术。技术学校、社区大学或贸易学校都可以培养。“如果你能培养出这些工程师，”他说，“我们可以粑更多的制造厂搬回来。”这个观点给总统留下了深刻的印象。接下来的一个月里，总统跟助手们提到了两三次；“我们必须找到方法，把乔布斯告诉我们的那3万名制造工程师培养出来。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs was pleased that  Obama followed up, and they talked by telephone a few times after the meeting.  He offered to help create Obama’s political ads for the 2012 campaign. (He had  made the same offer in 2008, but he’d become annoyed when Obama’s strategist David  Axelrod wasn’t totally deferential.) “I think political advertising is  terrible. I’d love to get Lee Clow out of retirement, and we can come up with  great commercials for him,” Jobs told me a few weeks after the dinner. Jobs had  been fighting pain all week, but the talk of politics energized him. “Every  once in a while, a real ad pro gets involved, the way Hal Riney did with ‘It’s  morning in America’ for Reagan’s reelection in 1984. So that’s what I’d like to  do for Obama.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯很高兴奥巴马在跟进这个想法，那次会后他们还通过几次电话。他还主动提出帮奥巴马做2012年总统竞选的政治广告。（他2008年就提出过同样的建议，但后来奥巴马的策略师戴维·阿克塞尔罗德不够听话，他就烦了。）“我认为政治广告糟糕透了。我愿意请李·克劳重新出山，我们可以给他做出非常棒的广吿。”那次晚宴后过了几周，乔布斯这样告诉我。乔布斯一直在跟疼痛奋战，但是关于政治的讨论让他兴奋不已。“每过一段时间，就会有一个真正的广告大师参与进来，就像哈尔·赖尼（HalRiney）在1984年为里根竞选连任制作的‘美国的早晨’（It-smorninginAmerica）。那正是我想为奥巴马做的。”</p></div></div>

 

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><h3><a name="s3" id="s3"></a>Third Medical Leave, 2011</h3>
<p>The cancer always sent  signals as it reappeared. Jobs had learned that. He would lose his appetite and  begin to feel pains throughout his body. His doctors would do tests, detect  nothing, and reassure him that he still seemed clear. But he knew better. The  cancer had its signaling pathways, and a few months after he felt the signs the  doctors would discover that it was indeed no longer in remission.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><h3>2011年，第三次病休</h3>
<p>癌症复发时总会发出些信号。乔布斯对此已了然于心。他会失去食欲，并开始全身疼痛。他的医生们会给他做一些检查，但什么都查不到，就让他安心，说他看起来一切正常。但是他心里清楚。癌症有它的信号通路，在他感受到那些迹象几个月以后，医生们就会发现癌症果然复发了。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Another such downturn  began in early November 2010. He was in pain, stopped eating, and had to be fed  intravenously by a nurse who came to the house. The doctors found no sign of  more tumors, and they assumed that this was just another of his periodic cycles  of fighting infections and digestive maladies. He had never been one to suffer  pain stoically, so his doctors and family had become somewhat inured to his  complaints.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>2010年11月初，这样的身体低迷期又开始了。他浑身疼痛，吃不了东西，只能靠一个护士来家里给他静脉注射补充营养。医生们没发现有更多肿瘤的迹象，他们以为这只是另一次周期性的对抗感染和消化不良的反应。乔布斯从来都不是个能默默忍受疼痛的人，所以他的医生们和家人对他的抱怨都已经习以为常了。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>He and his family went  to Kona Village for Thanksgiving, but his eating did not improve. The dining  there was in a communal room, and the other guests pretended not to notice as  Jobs, looking emaciated, rocked and moaned at meals, not touching his food. It  was a testament to the resort and its guests that his condition never leaked  out. When he returned to Palo Alto, Jobs became increasingly emotional and  morose. He thought he was going to die, he told his kids, and he would get  choked up about the possibility that he would never celebrate any more of their  birthdays.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>他和家人一起去康娜度假村过感恩节，但是进食情况并未改善。在那里，客人们是在同一个房间进餐的，其他客人都假装没有注意到消痩憔悴的乔布斯吃饭时坐立不安、抱怨不止、对他的食物碰都不碰一下。他的健康状况丝毫没有泄露，也算是该度假村及其客人们品质的一个有力证明。回到帕洛奥图以后，乔布斯变得越发情绪化和难以相处。他认为自己快要死了，他告诉孩子们，一想到他可能再也不能为他们庆祝生日了，他就会哽咽。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>By Christmas he was  down to 115 pounds, which was more than fifty pounds below his normal weight.  Mona Simpson came to Palo Alto for the holiday, along with her ex-husband, the  television comedy writer Richard Appel, and their children. The mood picked up  a bit. The families played parlor games such as Novel, in which participants  try to fool each other by seeing who can write the most convincing fake opening  sentence to a book, and things seemed to be looking up for a while. He was even  able to go out to dinner at a restaurant with Powell a few days after  Christmas. The kids went off on a ski vacation for New Year’s, with Powell and  Mona Simpson taking turns staying at home with Jobs in Palo Alto.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>到圣诞节，他的体重下降到115磅，比正常时的体重低了50多磅。莫娜·辛普森随前夫，电视喜剧作家理查德·阿佩尔，以及孩子们一起来帕洛奥图度假，气氛活跃了一些。两家人会一起在室内玩游戏，例如Novel，游戏中，参与者看谁能炮制出一本书最让人信服的第一句话，以此互相愚弄。情况一度似乎有了转机。圣诞节后几天，他甚至能跟鲍威尔一起出去吃晚饭。新年假期时，孩子们去滑雪度假，鲍威尔和莫娜·辛普森轮班在帕洛奥图的家里陪着乔布斯。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>By the beginning of  2011, however, it was clear that this was not merely one of his bad patches.  His doctors detected evidence of new tumors, and the cancer-related signaling  further exacerbated his loss of appetite. They were struggling to determine how  much drug therapy his body, in its emaciated condition, would be able to take.  Every inch of his body felt like it had been punched, he told friends, as he  moaned and sometimes doubled over in pain.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>然而到了2011年初，他的健康每况愈下，已经不再是另一个简单的低迷期了。医生们查出了新肿瘤的证据。癌症加剧了他的食欲不振，医生们要努力确定在他目前的瘦弱状态下，他的身体能承受多少药物治疗。他有时候疼得弯下了腰，呻吟着告诉朋友们，他身体的每寸都像挨了打一样。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>It was a vicious  cycle. The first signs of cancer caused pain. The morphine and other  painkillers he took suppressed his appetite. His pancreas had been partly  removed and his liver had been replaced, so his digestive system was faulty and  had trouble absorbing protein. Losing weight made it harder to embark on  aggressive drug therapies. His emaciated condition also made him more  susceptible to infections, as did the immunosuppressants he sometimes took to  keep his body from rejecting his liver transplant. The weight loss reduced the  lipid layers around his pain receptors, causing him to suffer more. And he was  prone to extreme mood swings, marked by prolonged bouts of anger and  depression, which further suppressed his appetite.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>这是一个恶性循环。癌症的早期症状会引起疼痛，而吗啡和其他止痛药又让他食欲不振。他的一部分胰脏被切除了，移植了新的肝脏，所以他的消化系统有缺陷，不能很好地吸收蛋白质。体重下降使得积极的药物治疗更加困难。他的虚弱，以及有时要用免疫抑制剂来防止身体排斥移植的肝脏，都使他更容易受到感染。体重下降也导致疼痛感觉神经周围的油脂层变薄，加剧了他的疼痛感。而且他会有极端的情绪波动，生气和抑郁的回合都被拉长，进一步抑制他的食欲。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs’s eating problems  were exacerbated over the years by his psychological attitude toward food. When  he was young, he learned that he could induce euphoria and ecstasy by fasting.  So even though he knew that he should eat—his doctors were begging him to  consume high-quality protein—lingering in the back of his subconscious, he  admitted, was his instinct for fasting and for diets like Arnold Ehret’s fruit  regimen that he had embraced as a teenager. Powell kept telling him that it was  crazy, even pointing out that Ehret had died at fifty-six when he stumbled and  knocked his head, and she would get angry when he came to the table and just  stared silently at his lap. “I wanted him to force himself to eat,” she said,  “and it was incredibly tense at home.” Bryar Brown, their part-time cook, would  still come in the afternoon and make an array of healthy dishes, but Jobs would  touch his tongue to one or two dishes and then dismiss them all as inedible.  One evening he announced, “I could probably eat a little pumpkin pie,” and the  even-tempered Brown created a beautiful pie from scratch in an hour. Jobs ate  only one bite, but Brown was thrilled.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>多年来乔布斯对食物的态度使得他的进食问题更加严重。年轻时，他学到可以通过禁食获得一种快感和愉悦。因此尽管他知道应该吃东西——他的医生们请求他摄入髙质量的蛋白质，但他承认在他潜意识里仍然本能地想荽禁食、想要像他十几岁时就学到的阿诺德·埃雷特水果养生法那样节食。鲍威尔一直告诉他那是疯狂的举动，甚至指出埃雷特56岁时绊了一跤，撞到了头，就死了。当看到乔布斯在饭桌前沉默地低着头发呆时，鲍威尔会非常愤怒。“我想让他逼着自己吃东西，”她说，“家里的气氛真是太紧张了。”他们的兼职厨师布里亚·布朗还是每天下午来做一桌健康美食，但是乔布斯会用舌尖尝一两种就说所有的都没法儿吃。有一天晚上他宣布说，“我也许能吃一点南瓜派。”好脾气的布朗居然一个小时就做出了一只漂亮的派。虽然乔布斯只吃了一小口，但布朗还是备受鼓舞。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Powell talked to  eating disorder specialists and psychiatrists, but her husband tended to shun  them. He refused to take any medications, or be treated in any way, for his  depression. “When you have feelings,” he said, “like sadness or anger about  your cancer or your plight, to mask them is to lead an artificial life.” In  fact he swung to the other extreme. He became morose, tearful, and dramatic as  he lamented to all around him that he was about to die. The depression became part  of the vicious cycle by making him even less likely to eat.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>鲍威尔咨询了很多研究进食失调问题的专家和精神病学家，但是乔布斯却一直回避他们。他拒绝为他的消沉接受任何药物或其他方式的治疗。“当你有某种感受时，”他说，“例如对你的癌症或困境感到悲伤或愤怒，试图掩饰这些感受就是在虚伪地过日子。”事实上他走向了另一个极端。他变得难以相处、爱哭，激动地向身边所有人哀叹他快要死了。消沉的情绪让他更不愛吃东西，这也成了恶性循环的一部分。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Pictures and videos of  Jobs looking emaciated began to appear online, and soon rumors were swirling  about how sick he was. The problem, Powell realized, was that the rumors were  true, and they were not going to go away. Jobs had agreed only reluctantly to  go on medical leave two years earlier, when his liver was failing, and this  time he also resisted the idea. It would be like leaving his homeland, unsure  that he would ever return. When he finally bowed to the inevitable, in January  2011, the board members were expecting it; the telephone meeting in which he  told them that he wanted another leave took only three minutes. He had often  discussed with the board, in executive session, his thoughts about who could  take over if anything happened to him, presenting both short-term and  longer-term combinations of options. But there was no doubt that, in this  current situation, Tim Cook would again take charge of day-to-day operations.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>网上开始出现乔布斯形容枯槁的照片和视频，很快，关于他病重的传言四起。鲍威尔意识到，问题在于那些传言是真的，而且不会散去。乔布斯两年前肝脏出问题时，就是犹豫再三才休了病假，这次他同样抗拒这个休病假的想法。这就像要离开他的故土，不知道还能不能回来。2011年1月当他最后不得不接受这个无可回避的现实时，董事会成员都已有心理准备；在电话中他告诉他们，自己希望再次休病假，会议只开了3分钟。以前他经常跟董事会讨论，如果他出了什么事，他认为谁可以接替他，还提供了短期和长期的各种选择。但是在当前的情况下，毋庸置疑，蒂姆·库克要再次接管日常的运营工作。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The following Saturday  afternoon, Jobs allowed his wife to convene a meeting of his doctors. He  realized that he was facing the type of problem that he never permitted at  Apple. His treatment was fragmented rather than integrated. Each of his myriad  maladies was being treated by different specialists—oncologists, pain  specialists, nutritionists, hepatologists, and hematologists—but they were not  being co-ordinated in a cohesive approach, the way James Eason had done in  Memphis. “One of the big issues in the health care industry is the lack of  caseworkers or advocates that are the quarterback of each team,” Powell said.  This was particularly true at Stanford, where nobody seemed in charge of  figuring out how nutrition was related to pain care and to oncology. So Powell  asked the various Stanford specialists to come to their house for a meeting  that also included some outside doctors with a more aggressive and integrated  approach, such as David Agus of USC. They agreed on a new regimen for dealing  with the pain and for coordinating the other treatments.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>接下来周六的下午，乔布斯让妻子召集他的医生们开会。他发现，自己正面临着一个从不允许在苹果发生的问题——他的治疗是零零散散的，而不是综合全面的。他有多种多样的疾病，每一种都是由不同的专家治疗的——肿瘤学家、疼痛专家、营养学家、肝脏病学家和血液学家——但是他们并没有以一种有序的方式被协调起来，就像詹姆斯·伊森在孟菲斯所做的那样。“医疗行业的主要问题之一就是缺少个案服务专员或协调人，他们的作用就像是橄榄球队伍里的四分卫一样。”鲍威尔说。在斯坦福尤其如此，似乎没有人负责研究营养跟止痛以及肿瘤学之间的关系。因此，鲍威尔把斯坦福的各种专家请到家里开会，也包括一些治疗理念更前卫或更全面的外部医生，例如南加州大学的戴维·阿古斯（DavidAgus）。他们一起拟定了对付疼痛并协调其他治疗的新方案。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Thanks to some  pioneering science, the team of doctors had been able to keep Jobs one step  ahead of the cancer. He had become one of the first twenty people in the world  to have all of the genes of his cancer tumor as well as of his normal DNA  sequenced. It was a process that, at the time, cost more than $100,000.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>有赖于尖端科学的发展，医生们得以让乔布斯总是比癌症的蔓延快上一步。他是世界上最早接受癌症肿瘤基因和正常基因作排序治疗的20个人之一。当时这项治疗耗资超过10万美元。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The gene sequencing  and analysis were done collaboratively by teams at Stanford, Johns Hopkins, and  the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. By knowing the unique genetic and  molecular signature of Jobs’s tumors, his doctors had been able to pick  specific drugs that directly targeted the defective molecular pathways that  caused his cancer cells to grow in an abnormal manner. This approach, known as  molecular targeted therapy, was more effective than traditional chemotherapy,  which attacks the process of division of all the body’s cells, cancerous or  not. This targeted therapy was not a silver bullet, but at times it seemed  close to one: It allowed his doctors to look at a large number of drugs—common  and uncommon, already available or only in development—to see which three or  four might work best. Whenever his cancer mutated and repaved around one of  these drugs, the doctors had another drug lined up to go next.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>基因排序和分析由斯坦福、约翰·霍普金斯和哈佛-麻省理工博德研究所的研究团队合作完成。了解乔布斯体内肿瘤的特殊基因和分子特征后，他的医生们就可以挑选特定的药品，直接针对导致他的癌细胞异常生长、有缺陷的分子位点进行治疗。这种方法，称为分子靶向治疗法，比传统的化疗方法更为有效，化疗会破坏身体里所有细胞的分裂过程，无论是癌细胞还是健康细胞。这种靶向治疗并非药到病除，但时常效果显著：它使医生可以筛选大量的药品——常见或不常见的，已经上市的或还在研制的——从中选出三四种可能最有效的。当他的癌细胞变异、一种药物不再有效时，医生们可以换下一种药物继续治疗。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Although Powell was  diligent in overseeing her husband’s care, he was the one who made the final  decision on each new treatment regimen. A typical example occurred in May 2011,  when he held a meeting with George Fisher and other doctors from Stanford, the  gene-sequencing analysts from the Broad Institute, and his outside consultant  David Agus. They all gathered around a table at a suite in the Four Seasons  hotel in Palo Alto. Powell did not come, but their son, Reed, did. For three  hours there were presentations from the Stanford and Broad researchers on the  new information they had learned about the genetic signatures of his cancer.  Jobs was his usual feisty self. At one point he stopped a Broad Institute  analyst who had made the mistake of using PowerPoint slides. Jobs chided him  and explained why Apple’s Keynote presentation software was better; he even  offered to teach him how to use it. By the end of the meeting, Jobs and his  team had gone through all of the molecular data, assessed the rationales for  each of the potential therapies, and come up with a list of tests to help them  better prioritize these.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>虽然鲍威尔谨慎地监管着丈夫的医护手段，但乔布斯是对每种新的治疗方案最后拍板的人。2011年5月发生了典型的一幕，乔布斯跟乔治·费希尔和其他斯坦福的医生、博德研究所的基因排序分析师，以及他的外部顾问戴维·阿古斯一起开了个会。他们都聚集在帕洛奥图四季酒店的一个套间里。鲍威尔没有来，但是儿子里德在场。在3个小时的会议中，斯坦福和博德的研究人员介绍了他们发现的他体内癌症基因特征的新信息。乔布斯情绪不安。博德研究所的一个分析师误用了PowerPoint幻灯片作介绍。他训斥了他，解释为什么苹果的Keynote演示软件更好，甚至说要教他怎么用。会议结束时，乔布斯和他的团队已经了解了所有的分子数据，评估了每种潜在治疗方案的原理，并列出了要确定每种治疗方案优先级所需要作的测试。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>One of his doctors  told him that there was hope that his cancer, and others like it, would soon be  considered a manageable chronic disease, which could be kept at bay until the  patient died of something else. “I’m either going to be one of the first to be  able to outrun a cancer like this, or I’m going to be one of the last to die  from it,” Jobs told me right after one of the meetings with his doctors.  “Either among the first to make it to shore, or the last to get dumped.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>他的一位医生告诉他，有可能他的癌症和其他相似的癌症很快会被归为可控制的慢性疾病，可以一直被遏制，直到他死于其他问题。“我要么就是最先这样跑赢癌症的人之一，要么就是最后死于这种癌症的人之一。”一次乔布斯跟医生们开会后这样告诉我，“不是最先上岸的，就是最后被淹死的。”</p></div></div>

<p>When his 2011 medical  leave was announced, the situation seemed so dire that Lisa Brennan-Jobs got  back in touch after more than a year and arranged to fly from New York the  following week. Her relationship with her father had been built on layers of  resentment. She was understandably scarred by having been pretty much abandoned  by him for her first ten years. Making matters worse, she had inherited some of  his prickliness and, he felt, some of her mother’s sense of grievance. “I told  her many times that I wished I’d been a better dad when she was five, but now  she should let things go rather than be angry the rest of her life,” he  recalled just before Lisa arrived.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><h3>来访者</h3>
<p>在乔布斯2011年宣布病休时，情况看起来很紧急，连一年多没有联系的丽萨·布伦南-乔布斯都安排一周后从纽约飞了回来。她跟父亲的关系建立在层层叠叠的怨恨之上。在她人生前十年，乔布斯基本上弃之不顾，可以理解这带给她怎样的创伤。雪上加霜的是，她还继承了父亲的浑身是刺，以及在他看来她母亲的愤世嫉俗。“我跟她说过很多次，如果时光可以倒流，我希望在她5岁的时候我曾是个更好的爸爸，但是现在她应该放下过去，而不是一辈子都记恨在心。”就在丽萨回来前，乔布斯这样回忆说。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The visit went well.  Jobs was beginning to feel a little better, and he was in a mood to mend fences  and express his affection for those around him. At age thirty-two, Lisa was in  a serious relationship for one of the first times in her life. Her boyfriend  was a struggling young filmmaker from California, and Jobs went so far as to  suggest she move back to Palo Alto if they got married. “Look, I don’t know how  long I am for this world,” he told her. “The doctors can’t really tell me. If  you want to see more of me, you’re going to have to move out here. Why don’t  you consider it?” Even though Lisa did not move west, Jobs was pleased at how  the reconciliation had worked out. “I hadn’t been sure I wanted her to visit,  because I was sick and didn’t want other complications. But I’m very glad she  came. It helped settle a lot of things in me.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>丽萨的这次来访很顺利。乔布斯开始感觉好一些，他有心情去弥补伤害，对周围的人表达他的感情。32岁的丽萨平生第一次在认真地谈恋爱。她的男朋友是来自加利福尼亚的一位正在打拼的年轻电影制作人，而乔布斯居然心情好到建议她结婚后搬回帕洛奥图来。“你瞧，我不知道我还能在这个世上活多久。”他告诉她，“医生们也无法告诉我。如果你想更多地见到我，你就得搬到这边来。为什么不考虑一下呢？”虽然丽萨没有搬到西海岸来，但是乔布斯还是为他们的和解感到高兴。“我原来并不肯定我想让她来，因为我病着，不想再有更多复杂的事情。但是我很高兴她来了。这帮我解决了压在心里的很多问题。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs had another visit  that month from someone who wanted to repair fences. Google’s cofounder Larry  Page, who lived less than three blocks away, had just announced plans to retake  the reins of the company from Eric Schmidt. He knew how to flatter Jobs: He  asked if he could come by and get tips on how to be a good CEO. Jobs was still  furious at Google. “My first thought was, ‘Fuck you,’” he recounted. “But then  I thought about it and realized that everybody helped me when I was young, from  Bill Hewlett to the guy down the block who worked for HP. So I called him back  and said sure.” Page came over, sat in Jobs’s living room, and listened to his  ideas on building great products and durable companies. Jobs recalled:</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯那个月还接待了另一个想要修缮关系的来访者。住在不到3个街区外的谷歌联合创始人拉里·佩奇，刚刚宣布计划从埃里克·施密特手里接管公司的控制权。他知道如何取悦乔布斯：他询问是否可以过来请教一下做一个好的CEO有什么秘诀。乔布斯仍然对谷歌感到气愤。“我的第一个想法是，‘去你妈的。’”他回忆说，“但是后来我想了想，意识到在我年轻的时候每个人都帮助过我，从比尔·休利特到在惠普工作的邻居。所以我给他回电话说没问题。”佩奇来到他家，在乔布斯的客厅里，听他讲如何创造伟大的产品和生命力持久的公司。乔布斯回忆道：</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>We  talked a lot about focus. And choosing people. How to know who to trust, and  how to build a team of lieutenants he can count on. I described the blocking  and tackling he would have to do to keep the company from getting flabby or  being larded with B players. The main thing I stressed was focus. Figure out  what Google wants to be when it grows up. It’s now all over the map. What are  the five products you want to focus on? Get rid of the rest, because they’re  dragging you down. They’re turning you into Microsoft. They’re causing you to  turn out products that are adequate but not great. I tried to be as helpful as  I could. I will continue to do that with people like Mark Zuckerberg too.  That’s how I’m going to spend part of the time I have left. I can help the next  generation remember the lineage of great companies here and how to continue the  tradition. The Valley has been very supportive of me. I should do my best to  repay.</p>
  <p>The announcement of  Jobs’s 2011 medical leave prompted others to make a pilgrimage to the house in  Palo Alto. Bill Clinton, for example, came by and talked about everything from  the Middle East to American politics. But the most poignant visit was from the  other tech prodigy born in 1955, the guy who, for more than three decades, had  been Jobs’s rival and partner in defining the age of personal computers.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p><p>关于专注，我们谈了很多。还有人的选择。如何知道应该信任谁，以及他如何打造一支可以依賴的团队。我给他讲了必须采用什么样的拦截战术去防止公司变得松散或充斥着二流选手。我强调的主要事项就是专注。要想清楚谷歌成熟以后想成为什么样的公司。现在摊子铺得到处都是，你想专注去做的5个产品是什么？把其他的都扔掉，因为会拖你的后腿，会把你变成微软，导致你生产的产品符合要求但不伟大。我尽量做了我能做的。我会继续与像马克·扎克伯格一样的人做这样的事。我余生的一部分时间会用来做这个。我可以帮助下一代记住当下伟大企业的血统，以及如何把这些传统发扬光大。硅谷一直非常支持我。我应该冬我所能作出回报。</p>

　　
<p>乔布斯2011年病休的公告也引发了其他人到帕洛奥图的朝圣之旅。例如，比尔·克林顿就曾登门拜访，讨论从中东到美国政治的所有事情。但最令人感动的来访者是另一位生于1955年的天才，那个30多年来作为乔布斯的对手和伙伴、共同定义了个人电脑时代的人。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Bill Gates had never  lost his fascination with Jobs. In the spring of 2011 I was at a dinner with  him in Washington, where he had come to discuss his foundation’s global health  endeavors. He expressed amazement at the success of the iPad and how Jobs, even  while sick, was focusing on ways to improve it. “Here I am, merely saving the  world from malaria and that sort of thing, and Steve is still coming up with  amazing new products,” he said wistfully. “Maybe I should have stayed in that  game.” He smiled to make sure that I knew he was joking, or at least half  joking.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>比尔·盖茨对乔布斯的痴迷从未消失过。2011年春天我跟盖茨在华盛顿共进晚餐，他到华盛顿是为了谈他的基金会的全球健康项目。他惊讶于iPad的成功，以及乔布斯即使在生病期间都那么专注于寻找方法去加以改进。“我现在只不过是在把全世界的人从疟疾这类灾病中解救出来，而史蒂夫仍然在创造惊人的新产品，”他有些伤感地说，“也许我应该留在那场游戏里。”他冲我微笑，以确认我知道他在开玩笑，或至少是半开玩笑。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Through their mutual  friend Mike Slade, Gates made arrangements to visit Jobs in May. The day before  it was supposed to happen, Jobs’s assistant called to say he wasn’t feeling  well enough. But it was rescheduled, and early one afternoon Gates drove to  Jobs’s house, walked through the back gate to the open kitchen door, and saw  Eve studying at the table. “Is Steve around?” he asked. Eve pointed him to the  living room.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>通过两人共同的朋友迈克·斯莱德，盖茨安排了5月来看乔布斯。在原计划的前一天，乔布斯的助理打电话说乔布斯的状态不够好。于是他们重新定了日程，一天下午，盖茨开车来到了乔布斯家，从后门走到敞开的厨房门口，看到伊芙正在餐桌上学习。“史蒂夫在吗？”他问。伊芙指向了客厅。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>They spent more than  three hours together, just the two of them, reminiscing. “We were like the old  guys in the industry looking back,” Jobs recalled. “He was happier than I’ve  ever seen him, and I kept thinking how healthy he looked.” Gates was similarly  struck by how Jobs, though scarily gaunt, had more energy than he expected. He  was open about his health problems and, at least that day, feeling optimistic.  His sequential regimens of targeted drug treatments, he told Gates, were like  “jumping from one lily pad to another,” trying to stay a step ahead of the  cancer.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>他们在一起待了3个多小时，追忆过去，只有他们两个。“我们就像这个行业里的两个老家伙在回首过去。”乔布斯回忆说，“他比以往我看到的任何时候都开心，我一直在想，他看起来真健康。”盖茨也同样惊讶于乔布斯虽然瘦得吓人，但还是比他预期的要精力充沛。乔布斯对自己的健康问题毫不避讳，而且，至少在那一天，感觉很乐观。他告诉盖茨，他的一系列靶向药物治疗方法就像“从一片荷叶跳到另一片”，试图总是比癌症快上一步。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs asked some  questions about education, and Gates sketched out his vision of what schools in  the future would be like, with students watching lectures and video lessons on  their own while using the classroom time for discussions and problem solving.  They agreed that computers had, so far, made surprisingly little impact on  schools—far less than on other realms of society such as media and medicine and  law. For that to change, Gates said, computers and mobile devices would have to  focus on delivering more personalized lessons and providing motivational  feedback.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯问了些关于教育的问题，盖茨描述了他对未来学校的设想——学生们自己观看讲座和视频课程，而课堂时间用来讨论和解决问题。他们一致认为，迄今为止计算机对学校的影响小得令人吃惊——比对诸如媒体、医药和法律等其他社会领域的影响小得多。盖茨说，要改变这一点，计算机和移动设备必须致力于提供更多个性化的课程并提供有启发性的反馈。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>They also talked a lot  about the joys of family, including how lucky they were to have good kids and  be married to the right women. “We laughed about how fortunate it was that he  met Laurene, and she’s kept him semi-sane, and I met Melinda, and she’s kept me  semi-sane,” Gates recalled. “We also discussed how it’s challenging to be one  of our children, and how do we mitigate that. It was pretty personal.” At one point  Eve, who in the past had been in horse shows with Gates’s daughter Jennifer,  wandered in from the kitchen, and Gates asked her what jumping routines she  liked best.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>他们也谈了很多关于家庭乐趣的话题，包括他们多么幸运，有很好的孩子，也娶了适合的女人。“我们大笑着说，他能遇到劳伦是多么的幸运，是劳伦让他保持了一半的心智健全。而我能遇到梅琳达，让我保持一半的心智健全，也很幸运。”盖茨回忆说，“我们也讨论了做我们的孩子是多么富有挑故的事情，以及我们如何能减轻他们的压力。这次谈话比较私密。”其间，伊芙晃到了客厅，她跟盖茨的女儿詹妮弗一起参加过马术表演，盖茨向她询问了她的马术训练情况。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>As their hours  together drew to a close, Gates complimented Jobs on “the incredible stuff” he  had created and for being able to save Apple in the late 1990s from the bozos  who were about to destroy it. He even made an interesting concession.  Throughout their careers they had adhered to competing philosophies on one of  the most fundamental of all digital issues: whether hardware and software  should be tightly integrated or more open. “I used to believe that the open,  horizontal model would prevail,” Gates told him. “But you proved that the  integrated, vertical model could also be great.” Jobs responded with his own  admission. “Your model worked too,” he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>在谈话接近尾声时，盖茨称赞乔布斯创造了“那些令人难以置信的东西”，以及在20世纪90年代末从那些差点儿毁了苹果的家伙手里把它拯救了出来。他甚至还作了个有趣的让步。纵观他们的职业生涯，彼此对于数字世界最根本的一个问题都抱有对立的理念——硬件和软件应该紧密整合还是应该更加开放。“我曾经相信那种开放的、横向的模式会胜出。”盖茨告诉他，“但是你证明了一体化的、垂直的模式也可以很出色。”乔布斯也承认说：“你的模式也成功了。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>They were both right.  Each model had worked in the realm of personal computers, where Macintosh  coexisted with a variety of Windows machines, and that was likely to be true in  the realm of mobile devices as well. But after recounting their discussion,  Gates added a caveat: “The integrated approach works well when Steve is at the  helm. But it doesn’t mean it will win many rounds in the future.” Jobs  similarly felt compelled to add a caveat about Gates after describing their  meeting: “Of course, his fragmented model worked, but it didn’t make really  great products. It produced crappy products. That was the problem. The big  problem. At least over time.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>他们都是正确的。他们各自的模式都在个人电脑领域取得了成功，麦金塔跟多种使用Windows系统的机器同时存在，可能在移动设备领域也会是如此。但是跟我追溯完他们的讨论后，盖茨补充了一个警告性的说明：“一体化的模式之所以成功，是因为有史蒂夫在掌舵。但那并不意味着它将在未来的多个回合中获胜。”乔布斯也感觉必须要加上一句对盖茨的警告：“当然，他的分散模式可行，但并没有制造出真正伟大的产品。这是问题的所在。是个大问题。至少在一段时间内是。”</p></div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><h3><a name="s5"></a>“That Day Has Come”</h3>
<p>Jobs had many other ideas  and projects that he hoped to develop. He wanted to disrupt the textbook  industry and save the spines of spavined students bearing backpacks by creating  electronic texts and curriculum material for the iPad. He was also working with  Bill Atkinson, his friend from the original Macintosh team, on devising new  digital technologies that worked at the pixel level to allow people to take  great photographs using their iPhones even in situations without much light.  And he very much wanted to do for television sets what he had done for  computers, music players, and phones: make them simple and elegant. “I’d like  to create an integrated television set that is completely easy to use,” he told  me. “It would be seamlessly synced with all of your devices and with iCloud.”  No longer would users have to fiddle with complex remotes for DVD players and  cable channels. “It will have the simplest user interface you could imagine. I  finally cracked it.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><h3>这一天来了</h3>
<p>乔布斯还有很多想法和项目要付诸实施。他想颠覆教科书产业，为iPad开发电子教材和课程资料，拯救那些背着沉重的书包瞒跚而行的学生们的脊柱。他还想跟最早麦金塔团队的朋友比尔·阿特金森合作，设计新的数码技术，改善像素水平，使人们即使在光线不足的情况下也可以用iPhone拍摄出色的照片。他还想把自己在电脑、音乐播放器和电话方面所做的创新也应用到电视机上，让它们变得简洁高雅。“我想发明一种非常简单易用的一体化电视机，”他告诉我，“它将可以跟你所有的电子设备以及iCloud无缝同步。”用户将无须再摆弄复杂的DVD和有线电视的遥控器。“它将具有你能想象到的最简单的用户界面。我终于开始着手做这件事了。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>But by July 2011, his  cancer had spread to his bones and other parts of his body, and his doctors  were having trouble finding targeted drugs that could beat it back. He was in  pain, sleeping erratically, had little energy, and stopped going to work. He  and Powell had reserved a sailboat for a family cruise scheduled for the end of  that month, but those plans were scuttled. He was eating almost no solid food,  and he spent most of his days in his bedroom watching television.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>但是到2011年7月，他的癌细胞已经扩散到骨骼和身体的其他部分，而医生们难以找到对症的药物去治疗。他很疼，筋疲力尽，不得不停下工作。他和鲍威尔之前还预订了一艘帆船，准备那个月底全家去航海，但是这&计划都搁浅了。那段时间，他已经基本上不能吃固体食物了，每天大部分时间都在卧室看电视。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>In August, I got a  message that he wanted me to come visit. When I arrived at his house, at  mid-morning on a Saturday, he was still asleep, so I sat with his wife and kids  in the garden, filled with a profusion of yellow roses and various types of  daisies, until he sent word that I should come in. I found him curled up on the  bed, wearing khaki shorts and a white turtleneck. His legs were shockingly  sticklike, but his smile was easy and his mind quick. “We better hurry, because  I have very little energy,” he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>8月，我接到消息说他希望我去一下。我在一个周六的上午来到他家，他还在睡觉，我跟他的妻子和孩子们坐在满是黄玫瑰和各种雏菊的花园里，直到他派人来叫我进去。我看到他蜷缩在床上，穿着卡其色的短裤和白色套头衫。他的腿痩骨嶙峋，但是笑容很轻松，思路依然敏捷。“咱们得抓紧，我只有一点儿力气了。”他说。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>He wanted to show me  some of his personal pictures and let me pick a few to use in the book. Because  he was too weak to get out of bed, he pointed to various drawers in the room,  and I carefully brought him the photographs in each. As I sat on the side of  the bed, I held them up, one at a time, so he could see them. Some prompted  stories; others merely elicited a grunt or a smile. I had never seen a picture  of his father, Paul Jobs, and I was startled when I came across a snapshot of a  handsome hardscrabble 1950s dad holding a toddler. “Yes, that’s him,” he said.  “You can use it.” He then pointed to a box near the window that contained a  picture of his father looking at him lovingly at his wedding. “He was a great  man,” Jobs said quietly. I murmured something along the lines of “He would have  been proud of you.” Jobs corrected me: “He <em>was</em> proud of me.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>他想给我看一些私人照片，让我选几张用在这本书里。他太虚弱了，下不了床，所以他指点我去房间的各个抽屉里找，我小心翼翼地把照片拿给他。我坐在床边，一张一张地举起来给他看。有些照片会让他讲出许多故事，而有些，他只是嘟囔一声或是微微一笑。我从未见过他父亲保罗·乔布斯的照片，所以当看到一张照片上一个帅气而贫穷的20世纪50年代的父亲抱着个刚会走路的孩子时，我非常惊讶。“没错，那是他，”他说，“你可以用这张。”然后他指示我打开窗边的一个盒子，里面有一张照片是他父亲在他的婚礼上慈爱地望着他。“他是个伟大的人。”乔布斯静静地说。我嘀咕了一句“他应该为你感到骄傲”之类的话。乔布斯纠正我说：“他确实为我感到骄傲。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>For a while, the  pictures seemed to energize him. We discussed what various people from his  past, ranging from Tina Redse to Mike Markkula to Bill Gates, now thought of  him. I recounted what Gates had said after he described his last visit with  Jobs, which was that Apple had shown that the integrated approach could work,  but only “when Steve is at the helm.” Jobs thought that was silly. “Anyone  could make better products that way, not just me,” he said. So I asked him to  name another company that made great products by insisting on end-to-end  integration. He thought for a while, trying to come up with an example. “The  car companies,” he finally said, but then he added, “Or at least they used to.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>有那么一会儿，这些照片似乎让他精神为之一振。我们谈到了他一生中很多人对他的看法，从蒂娜·莱德斯到迈克·马库拉，再到比尔·盖茨。我想起盖茨上次来看乔布斯之后说的话，就是关于苹果虽然证明了一体化的策略可行，但前提是“因为有史蒂夫在掌舵”。乔布斯认为这么说很愚蠢。“任何人都可以用这种方式创造出更好的产品，不只是我。”他说。于是我问他能不能说出另一家公司，它们也因坚持端到端一体化的策略而做出了伟大的产品。他思索了一会儿，努力想找出个例子来。“那些汽车公司，”他最后说，但是又加了一句，“或者至少它们曾经是。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>When our discussion  turned to the sorry state of the economy and politics, he offered a few sharp  opinions about the lack of strong leadership around the world. “I’m  disappointed in Obama,” he said. “He’s having trouble leading because he’s  reluctant to offend people or piss them off.” He caught what I was thinking and  assented with a little smile: “Yes, that’s not a problem I ever had.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>当我们的讨论转移到当前经济和政治的糟糕局面时，他提出了一些尖锐的观点，说全世界都缺少强有力的领导。“我对奥巴马感到失望。”他说，“他的领导力出现问题是因为，他不愿意得罪别人或让那些人滚蛋。”他猜到了我在想什么，会心地笑着说：“是的，我就从来没有这种问题。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>After two hours, he  grew quiet, so I got off the bed and started to leave. “Wait,” he said, as he  waved to me to sit back down. It took a minute or two for him to regain enough  energy to talk. “I had a lot of trepidation about this project,” he finally  said, referring to his decision to cooperate with this book. “I was really  worried.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>两个小时以后，他话少了，所以我站起身准备告辞。“等等，”他又示意我坐下。过了一两分钟他才有力气讲话。“当初，我对这个项目有很多恐惧，”他最后说，指的是决定跟我合作写这本书的事，“我真的很忧虑。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>“Why did you do it?” I  asked.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>“那你当初为什么要做呢？”我问。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>“I wanted my kids to  know me,” he said. “I wasn’t always there for them, and I wanted them to know  why and to understand what I did. Also, when I got sick, I realized other  people would write about me if I died, and they wouldn’t know anything. They’d  get it all wrong. So I wanted to make sure someone heard what I had to say.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>“我想让我的孩子们了解我。”他说，“我不经常在他们身边，我希望他们知道这是为什么，并理解我做的事情。另外，在我生病以后，我意识到如果我死了，其他人肯定会写我，而他们根本不了解我。他们会全都搞错。所以我想确保有人能听到我想说的话。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>He had never, in two  years, asked anything about what I was putting in the book or what conclusions  I had drawn. But now he looked at me and said, “I know there will be a lot in  your book I won’t like.” It was more a question than a statement, and when he  stared at me for a response, I nodded, smiled, and said I was sure that would  be true. “That’s good,” he said. “Then it won’t seem like an in-house book. I  won’t read it for a while, because I don’t want to get mad. Maybe I will read  it in a year—if I’m still around.” By then, his eyes were closed and his energy  gone, so I quietly took my leave.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>两年以来，他从未问过我在这本书里写了些什么或我得出了哪些结论。但是此时此刻他看着我说，“我知道在你的书里会有很多我不喜欢的内容。”这句话更多的是提问而不是陈述，他盯着我，等待一个答复，我笑着点了点头，说肯定会是那样。“很好。”他说，“这样它就不会看起来像是本内部著作。我一时半会儿不会读它，因为我不想被气疯。可能我一年后会读——如果我还在的话。”说到这儿，他闭上了眼睛，已经没有力气了，于是我悄悄地离开了。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>As his health  deteriorated throughout the summer, Jobs slowly began to face the inevitable:  He would not be returning to Apple as CEO. So it was time for him to resign. He  wrestled with the decision for weeks, discussing it with his wife, Bill  Campbell, Jony Ive, and George Riley. “One of the things I wanted to do for  Apple was to set an example of how you do a transfer of power right,” he told  me. He joked about all the rough transitions that had occurred at the company  over the past thirty-five years. “It’s always been a drama, like a third-world  country. Part of my goal has been to make Apple the world’s best company, and  having an orderly transition is key to that.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>随着整个夏天健康状况不断恶化，乔布斯开始慢慢地面对一个不可回避的现实：他不会再回苹果做CEO了。他辞职的时间到了。他为这个决定斟酌了几个星期，其间跟他妻子、比尔·坎贝尔、乔尼·艾弗和乔治·莱利都讨论过这个问题。“我期望为苹果做的事情之一，就是为如何正确地移交权力做出一个榜样。”他告诉我。他拿公司过去35年间历次艰难的过渡开着玩笑。“一直都是惊天动地的，像是在第三世界国家一样。我的一个目标就是把苹果建设成全球最好的公司，一个有序的过渡对此非常关键。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The best time and  place to make the transition, he decided, was at the company’s regularly  scheduled August 24 board meeting. He was eager to do it in person, rather than  merely send in a letter or attend by phone, so he had been pushing himself to  eat and regain strength. The day before the meeting, he decided he could make  it, but he needed the help of a wheelchair. Arrangements were made to have him  driven to headquarters and wheeled to the boardroom as secretly as possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>他决定作出这一过渡的最佳时机和地点就是8月24日公司董事会的例会。他非常想亲自到场宣布，而不是发封电子邮件或电话接入会议，所以之前他一直强迫自己吃东西以恢复体力。会议前一天，他决定可以参加，但是需要轮椅的帮助。公司作好安排，把他接到总部，然后尽量秘密地用轮椅把他推到董事会的会议室。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>He arrived just before  11 a.m., when the board  members were finishing committee reports and other routine business. Most knew  what was about to happen. But instead of going right to the topic on everyone’s  mind, Tim Cook and Peter Oppenheimer, the chief financial officer, went through  the results for the quarter and the projections for the year ahead. Then Jobs  said quietly that he had something personal to say. Cook asked if he and the  other top managers should leave, and Jobs paused for more than thirty seconds  before he decided they should. Once the room was cleared of all but the six  outside directors, he began to read aloud from a letter he had dictated and  revised over the previous weeks. “I have always said if there ever came a day  when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple’s CEO, I would  be the first to let you know,” it began. “Unfortunately, that day has come.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>他在11点前到达，董事会正在收尾各种委员会报告和其他例行事宜。大多数人都知道要发生什么事情。但是大家并没有直人主题，而是由蒂姆·库克和首席财务官彼得·奥本海默先介绍了本季度业绩和未来一年的展望。之后乔布斯平静地说，他有些个人的事情要宣布。库克问，自己和其他高管是否应该离开，乔布斯停顿了30多秒钟，最后决定让他们离开。会议室里只剩下6位外部董事，他开始大声朗读由他口授写成并反复修改了几星期的一封信。“我总是说，假如某天自己无法继续履行苹果CEO的义务、无法满足大家对这一职位的期待，我会第一个告诉你们。”信这样开头，“不幸的是，这一天来了。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The letter was simple,  direct, and only eight sentences long. In it he suggested that Cook replace  him, and he offered to serve as chairman of the board. “I believe Apple’s  brightest and most innovative days are ahead of it. And I look forward to  watching and contributing to its success in a new role.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>这封信的内容简单直接，只有8个句子。信中，他建议由库克接替他，并提出自己继续担任董事会主席。“我相信苹果最灿烂最有创造力的日子还在前面。我期待着以一个新的角色注视着它的成功，并为之作出贡献。”</p></div></div>

<p>There was a long  silence. Al Gore was the first to speak, and he listed Jobs’s accomplishments during  his tenure. Mickey Drexler added that watching Jobs transform Apple was “the  most incredible thing I’ve ever seen in business,” and Art Levinson praised  Jobs’s diligence in ensuring that there was a smooth transition. Campbell said  nothing, but there were tears in his eyes as the formal resolutions  transferring power were passed.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>现场长时间的沉默。阿尔·戈尔第一个讲话，他历数了乔布斯在任期间的种种成就。米基·德雷克斯勒补充说，看着乔布斯对苹果的变革是“我在商界看到的最不可思议的事情”。亚瑟·莱文森称赞了乔布斯为平稳过渡作出的努力。坎贝尔什么都没说，但在移交杈力的正式决议通过后，他眼睛里闪着泪光。</p></div></div>

<p>Over lunch, Scott  Forstall and Phil Schiller came in to display mockups of some products that  Apple had in the pipeline. Jobs peppered them with questions and thoughts,  especially about what capacities the fourth-generation cellular networks might  have and what features needed to be in future phones. At one point Forstall  showed off a voice recognition app. As he feared, Jobs grabbed the phone in the  middle of the demo and proceeded to see if he could confuse it. “What’s the  weather in Palo Alto?” he asked. The app answered. After a few more questions,  Jobs challenged it: “Are you a man or a woman?” Amazingly, the app answered in  its robotic voice, “They did not assign me a gender.” For a moment the mood  lightened.</p>

<div class="right"><p>吃午饭时，斯科特·福斯托和菲尔·席勒进来展示一些正在开发中的产品的模型。乔布斯不断提出问题和想法打击他们，尤其是关于第四代无线网络的容量以及未来的电话需要有什么功能。其间福斯托展示了一个语音识别软件。正如他所担心的，乔布斯在演示过程中抓过手机，开始试验他能不能把它搞晕。“帕洛奥图是什么天气？”他问道。软件回答正确。问了一些问题之后，乔布斯突然挑战它说：“你是男的还是女的？”令人惊奇的是，那个软#用它的机器人声音回答说，“他们没有给我分配性别。”现场的气氛顿时活跃起来。</p></div></div>

<p>When the talk turned  to tablet computing, some expressed a sense of triumph that HP had suddenly  given up the field, unable to compete with the iPad. But Jobs turned somber and  declared that it was actually a sad moment. “Hewlett and Packard built a great  company, and they thought they had left it in good hands,” he said. “But now  it’s being dismembered and destroyed. It’s tragic. I hope I’ve left a stronger  legacy so that will never happen at Apple.” As he prepared to leave, the board  members gathered around to give him a hug.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>但话题转到平板电脑时，有人以胜利的口吻说惠普突然放弃了这个领域，因为无法跟iPad竞争。但是乔布斯却神情严肃，说这其实是个悲伤的时刻。“休利特和帕卡德创建了一家伟大的公司，他们以为把它交到了可靠的人手里。”他说，“可是现在这家公司正处于分裂和毁灭之中。太悲哀了。真希望我能留下更强大的遗产，那样的事就永远不会发生在苹果身上。”他准备离开时，董事会成员都聚过来跟他拥抱告别。</p></div></div>

<p>After meeting with his  executive team to explain the news, Jobs rode home with George Riley. When they  arrived at the house, Powell was in the backyard harvesting honey from her  hives, with help from Eve. They took off their screen helmets and brought the  honey pot to the kitchen, where Reed and Erin had gathered, so that they could  all celebrate the graceful transition. Jobs took a spoonful of the honey and  pronounced it wonderfully sweet.</p>

<div class="right"><p>在跟高管团队开会宣布了这个消息之后，乔布斯跟乔治·莱利一起乘车回家。到家时，鲍威尔正在后院的蜂房采集蜂蜜，伊芙在帮她。她们脱掉防护服，把蜂蜜罐拿进厨房，里德和埃琳也都在那儿，大家要一起庆祝这次优雅的交接。乔布斯尝了一勺蜂蜜，夸赞说无比甜美。</p></div></div>

<p>That evening, he  stressed to me that his hope was to remain as active as his health allowed.  “I’m going to work on new products and marketing and the things that I like,”  he said. But when I asked how it really felt to be relinquishing control of the  company he had built, his tone turned wistful, and he shifted into the past  tense. “I’ve had a very lucky career, a very lucky life,” he replied. “I’ve  done all that I can do.”</p>

那晚，他向我强调说，他希望在健康状况允许的情况下继续积极工作。“我会参与新产品的开发和营销，以及我喜欢做的事情。”他说。但是当我问到，放弃他亲手创建的公司的控制权感觉如何，他的语气充满留恋，开始使用过去时。“我有过很幸运的事业，有过很幸运的人生。”他回答说，“我已经做了我能做的一切。”
