<div class="left">  <h3><a name="s1" id="s1"></a>The iPad 2</h3>
<p>Even before the iPad  went on sale, Jobs was thinking about what should be in the iPad 2. It needed  front and back cameras—everyone knew that was coming—and he definitely wanted  it to be thinner. But there was a peripheral issue that he focused on that most  people hadn’t thought about: The cases that people used covered the beautiful  lines of the iPad and detracted from the screen. They made fatter what should  be thinner. They put a pedestrian cloak on a device that should be magical in  all of its aspects.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><h3>iPad 2</h3>
<p>在iPad开始销售之前，乔布斯就已经在思考iPad2上该有什么。它需要前置和后置摄像头——大家都知道会是这样——而且他肯定希望它更加轻薄。但是有一个他专注思考的外设问题是大多数人没有想到的：人们用的保护套遮盖了iPad的美丽线条，也削弱了屏幕的效果。他们把本应轻薄的东西做得太厚了，给一个原本各方面都充满魔力的电子设备披上了件大路货的外衣。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Around that time he  read an article about magnets, cut it out, and handed it to Jony Ive. The  magnets had a cone of attraction that could be precisely focused. Perhaps they  could be used to align a detachable cover. That way, it could snap onto the front  of an iPad but not have to engulf the entire device. One of the guys in Ive’s  group worked out how to make a detachable cover that could connect with a  magnetic hinge. When you began to open it, the screen would pop to life like  the face of a tickled baby, and then the cover could fold into a stand.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>大约就在那个时候，他读到一篇有关磁铁的文章，剪下来交给了乔尼·艾弗。磁铁的吸引力可以被精确地聚焦在一个锥形区域里，这也许可以用于连接一个可分离的保护盖。那样，保护売就可以覆盖iPad的正面而无须包褰整个设备。艾弗的团队里有个家伙研究出了如何用有磁性的合页连接一个可分离的保护盖。当你打开它时，屏幕会被唤醒，而且这个保护盖还可以折叠成一个支架。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>It was not high-tech;  it was purely mechanical. But it was enchanting. It also was another example of  Jobs’s desire for end-to-end integration: The cover and the iPad had been  designed together so that the magnets and hinge all connected seamlessly. The  iPad 2 would have many improvements, but this cheeky little cover, which most  other CEOs would never have bothered with, was the one that would elicit the  most smiles.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>这不是高科技，只是纯粹的机械应用。但是它很迷人。这也是乔布斯追求端到端一体化集成的另一个例子：保护盖和iPad是一起设计的，因此磁铁和合页可以无缝连接。iPad2会有很多改进，但是这个大多数CEO都会不屑一顾的小盖子，却将博得最多赞许的微笑。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Because Jobs was on  another medical leave, he was not expected to be at the launch of the iPad 2,  scheduled for March 2, 2011, in San Francisco. But when the invitations were  sent out, he told me that I should try to be there. It was the usual scene: top  Apple executives in the front row, Tim Cook eating energy bars, and the sound  system blaring the appropriate Beatles songs, building up to “You Say You Want  a Revolution” and “Here Comes the Sun.” Reed Jobs arrived at the last minute  with two rather wide-eyed freshman dorm mates.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>iPad2按计划在2011年3月2日于旧金山发布，由于乔布斯又在休病假，大家并未期待他会出席。但是等请柬发出去以后，他又让我尽量到场。现场一切照旧：苹果的最髙管理层坐在第一排，蒂姆·库克吃着能量棒，音响系统大声播放着应景的披头士乐队的歌，最后是《你说你想要一场革命》和《太阳升起》。开幕前的最后一分钟，里德·乔布斯跟两个满脸稚气的大一宿舍室友赶到现场。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>“We’ve been working on  this product for a while, and I just didn’t want to miss today,” Jobs said as  he ambled onstage looking scarily gaunt but with a jaunty smile. The crowd  erupted in whoops, hollers, and a standing ovation.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>“我们做这个产品那么久，我可不想错过今天。”乔布斯缓步走上舞台时说。他痩得吓人，却带着欢快的笑容。观众爆发出欢呼声，全体起立鼓掌。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>He began his demo of  the iPad 2 by showing off the new cover. “This time, the case and the product  were designed together,” he explained. Then he moved on to address a criticism  that had been rankling him because it had some merit: The original iPad had  been better at consuming content than at creating it. So Apple had adapted its  two best creative applications for the Macintosh, GarageBand and iMovie, and  made powerful versions available for the iPad. Jobs showed how easy it was to  compose and orchestrate a song, or put music and special effects into your home  videos, and post or share such creations using the new iPad.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯的iPad2展示从新的保护盖开始。“这次，保护盖跟这个产品是一起设计的。”他解释说。接下来他开始回应一项质疑：原来的iPad更擅长消费内容而不是创造内容。这种说法不无道理，因此乔布斯一直为之耿耿于怀。这次，苹果改编了麦金塔上两项最有创造性的应用，GamgeBand和iMovie，开发了适用于iPad的版本，功能强大。乔布斯演示了如何在新版iPad上轻松地作曲和编曲，或给你的家庭录像添加音乐和特效，以及发布和分享这些创作。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Once again he ended  his presentation with the slide showing the intersection of Liberal Arts Street  and Technology Street. And this time he gave one of the clearest expressions of  his credo, that true creativity and simplicity come from integrating the whole  widget—hardware and software, and for that matter content and covers and  salesclerks—rather than allowing things to be open and fragmented, as happened  in the world of Windows PCs and was now happening with Android devices:</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>又一次，他用人文街（LiberalArtsStreet）和科技街（TechnologyStreet）交汇的画面结束了演讲。这次，他用最清晰的方式表达了他的信条：真正的创意和简洁来自产品的一体化——硬件、软件，以及内容、保护盖和销售员——而不是让这些部分都开放和各自为政，就像过去的Windows个人电脑和现在的安卓（Android）设备那样：</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>It’s  in Apple’s DNA that technology alone is not enough. We believe that it’s  technology married with the humanities that yields us the result that makes our  heart sing. Nowhere is that more true than in these post-PC devices. Folks are  rushing into this tablet market, and they’re looking at it as the next PC, in  which the hardware and the software are done by different companies. Our  experience, and every bone in our body, says that is not the right approach.  These are post-PC devices that need to be even more intuitive and easier to use  than a PC, and where the software and the hardware and the applications need to  be intertwined in an even more seamless way than they are on a PC. We think we  have the right architecture not just in silicon, but in our organization, to  build these kinds of products.</p>
<p>It was an architecture  that was bred not just into the organization he had built, but into his own  soul.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p><p>苹果的基因决定了只有技术是不够的。我们笃信，是科技与人文的联姻才能让我们的心灵歌唱。后PC时代的电子设备尤其如此。大家都在涌入这一平板电脑市场，可是他们把它看成是下一代PC，硬件和软件要由不同的公司制造。而我们的体验，以及我们身体中的每一块骨骼，都在说那种方式是不对的。这些是后PC时代的电子设备，需要比PC更加直观和简单易用，其软件、硬件和应用都要比在PC上更加无缝地结合。我们认为，我们不仅有合适的硅构造，而且有合适的组织构造，来制造这种产品。</p>

<p>这种构造不仅植入了他创建的企业，而且也植入了他自己的灵魂。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>After the launch  event, Jobs was energized. He came to the Four Seasons hotel to join me, his  wife, and Reed, plus Reed’s two Stanford pals, for lunch. For a change he was  eating, though still with some pickiness. He ordered fresh-squeezed juice,  which he sent back three times, declaring that each new offering was from a  bottle, and a pasta primavera, which he shoved away as inedible after one  taste. But then he ate half of my crab Louie salad and ordered a full one for  himself, followed by a bowl of ice cream. The indulgent hotel was even able to  produce a glass of juice that finally met his standards.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>发布会结束后，乔布斯精神焕发。他到四季酒店来，跟我、他夫人、里德和里德的两个斯坦福同学共进午餐。这次他真的是吃东西了，虽然还是有些挑剔。他点了鲜榨果汁，结果把果汁退回去三次，每次都说是瓶装的；还点了一份什蔬意大利面，尝了一口就说没法儿吃，推到一边去了。可是接下来他把我的蟹肉沙拉吃了一半，然后自己点了一整份，吃完以后又吃了一碗冰激凌。而最后，这家对客人百依百顺的酒店甚至还端上了一杯终于能达到他要求的果汁。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>At his house the  following day he was still on a high. He was planning to fly to Kona Village  the next day, alone, and I asked to see what he had put on his iPad 2 for the  trip. There were three movies: <em>Chinatown</em>, <em>The Bourne Ultimatum</em>,  and <em>Toy Story 3</em>. More revealingly, there was just one book that he had  downloaded: <em>The Autobiography of a Yogi</em>, the guide to meditation and  spirituality that he had first read as a teenager, then reread in India, and  had read once a year ever since.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>第二天在家中，他依然情绪髙涨。他计划第三天一个人飞到康娜度假村，我要求看看为了这次旅行他都在他的iPad2上安装了什么。有三部电影：《唐人街》（Chinatown）、《谍影重重3》（TheBourneUltimatum）,和《玩具总动员3》（ToyStory3）。我还发现，他只下载了一本书：《一个瑜伽行者的自传》。这是一本冥想与灵修指南，他十几岁时第一次阅读，后来在印度再次阅读，从那以后每年都会重读一遍。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Midway through the  morning he decided he wanted to eat something. He was still too weak to drive,  so I drove him to a café in a shopping mall. It was closed, but the owner was  used to Jobs knocking on the door at off-hours, and he happily let us in. “He’s  taken on a mission to try to fatten me up,” Jobs joked. His doctors had pushed  him to eat eggs as a source of high-quality protein, and he ordered an omelet.  “Living with a disease like this, and all the pain, constantly reminds you of  your own mortality, and that can do strange things to your brain if you’re not  careful,” he said. “You don’t make plans more than a year out, and that’s bad.  You need to force yourself to plan as if you will live for many years.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>上午刚过了一半，他就想吃东西了。他仍然太虚弱，不能开车，所以我开车带他去一个购物中心的咖啡厅。咖啡厅还没开门，但是老板已经习惯了乔布斯在非营业时间敲门，他高兴地接待了我们。“他承担了让我胖起来的使命。”乔布斯开玩笑说。他的医生们要求他吃鸡蛋，作为优质蛋白质的一个来源，所以他点了鸡蛋卷。“得了这种病，加上所有的疼痛，会时刻提醒你你是会死的，而一不小心这就会对你的大脑产生奇怪的影响。”他说，“你不会作超过一年的计划，这很不好。你需要强迫自己像你要活很多年那样去作计划。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>An example of this  magical thinking was his plan to build a luxurious yacht. Before his liver  transplant, he and his family used to rent a boat for vacations, traveling to  Mexico, the South Pacific, or the Mediterranean. On many of these cruises, Jobs  got bored or began to hate the design of the boat, so they would cut the trip  short and fly to Kona Village. But sometimes the cruise worked well. “The best  vacation I’ve ever been on was when we went down the coast of Italy, then to  Athens—which is a pit, but the Parthenon is mind-blowing—and then to Ephesus in  Turkey, where they have these ancient public lavatories in marble with a place  in the middle for musicians to serenade.” When they got to Istanbul, he hired a  history professor to give his family a tour. At the end they went to a Turkish bath,  where the professor’s lecture gave Jobs an insight about the globalization of  youth:</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>这种神奇想法的一个例子就是他计划建造一艘豪华游艇。在他做肝脏移植手术之前，他和家人曾经租用游艇度假，去墨西哥、南太平洋或地中海。在很多次航行中，乔布斯都会厌烦或开始讨厌所乘游艇的设计，因此他们会缩短行程，然后飞到康娜度假村。但有些时候航行很成功。“我最好的一次假期就是我们沿着意大利海岸线航行，然后去雅典——雅典挺没劲儿的，不过帕特农神殿非常震撼——然后到土耳其的以弗所，那里保留着那种古老的大理石的公共厕所，中间还有一个地方供音乐家演奏小夜曲。”他们到达伊斯坦布尔后，乔布斯聘请了一位历史教授做他们的导游。最后他们还洗了土耳其浴，那位教授的讲解让乔布斯对青少年文化的全球化有了深刻的认识：</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>I  had a real revelation. We were all in robes, and they made some Turkish coffee  for us. The professor explained how the coffee was made very different from  anywhere else, and I realized, “So fucking what?” Which kids even in Turkey  give a shit about Turkish coffee? All day I had looked at young people in  Istanbul. They were all drinking what every other kid in the world drinks, and  they were wearing clothes that look like they were bought at the Gap, and they  are all using cell phones. They were like kids everywhere else. It hit me that,  for young people, this whole world is the same now. When we’re making products,  there is no such thing as a Turkish phone, or a music player that young people  in Turkey would want that’s different from one young people elsewhere would  want. We’re just one world now.</p>

</div>
<div class="right"><p>我受到了真正的启示。我们都穿着浴袍，他们为我们制作了土耳其咖啡。教授讲解了这里的咖啡制作方法跟其他地方有多么不同，而我认识到，“那又他妈的能怎么样呢？”即使是在土耳其，又有哪个孩子会在乎什么土耳其咖啡呢？一整天我都在现察伊斯坦布尔的年轻人。他们都在喝世界上其他孩子喝的饮料，他们穿的衣看起来就像是从GAP买的，他们也都在用手机。他们跟别处的孩子没什么两样。这让我意识到，对于年轻人来说，现在整个世界都是一样的。我们在制造产品时，没有一种东西叫土耳其手机，土耳其的年轻人想要的音乐播放器也不会跟世界上其他地方的年轻人想要的不一样。我们现在就是同一个世界。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

  <p>After the joy of that  cruise, Jobs had amused himself by beginning to design, and then repeatedly  redesigning, a boat he said he wanted to build someday. When he got sick again  in 2009, he almost canceled the project. “I didn’t think I would be alive when  it got done,” he recalled. “But that made me so sad, and I decided that working  on the design was fun to do, and maybe I have a shot at being alive when it’s  done. If I stop work on the boat and then I make it alive for another two  years, I would be really pissed. So I’ve kept going.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>那次愉快的航行之后，乔布斯自娱自乐地开始设计，之后反复地重新设计一艘他有朝一日想要建造的游艇。2009年他再次病重时，几乎取消了这个计划。“我认为我活不到它造好的那个时候。”他回忆说，“那让我非常悲伤，但是我又觉得做这个设计是件有意思的事，而且也许我侥幸可以活到它造好的时候。如果我停止设计，然后我又多活了两年，我会气疯的。所以我就坚持了下去。”</p></div></div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>After our omelets at  the café, we went back to his house and he showed me all of the models and  architectural drawings. As expected, the planned yacht was sleek and  minimalist. The teak decks were perfectly flat and unblemished by any  accoutrements. As at an Apple store, the cabin windows were large panes, almost  floor to ceiling, and the main living area was designed to have walls of glass  that were forty feet long and ten feet high. He had gotten the chief engineer  of the Apple stores to design a special glass that was able to provide  structural support.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>在咖啡厅吃完鸡蛋卷后，我们回到他家，他给我看所有的模型和设计图。不出所料，这艘计划中的游艇是流线型的极简风格。柚木甲板平直完美，不加任何装饰物。如苹果商店一样，船舱的窗子都是几乎从地面直到天花板的大块玻璃，而主要生活区设计有40英尺长、10英尺高的玻璃墙。他让苹果商店的总工程师设计了一种特殊的可以支撑船体结构的玻璃。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>By then the boat was  under construction by the Dutch custom yacht builders Feadship, but Jobs was  still fiddling with the design. “I know that it’s possible I will die and leave  Laurene with a half-built boat,” he said. “But I have to keep going on it. If I  don’t, it’s an admission that I’m about to die.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>当时这艘船已经在由荷兰的游艇定制公司Feadship建造，但是乔布斯仍然在对设计改来改去。“我知道有可能我会死掉，留给劳伦一艘造了一半的船，”他说，“但是我必须继续做下去。如果我不这么做，就是承认我快要死了。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>He and Powell would be  celebrating their twentieth wedding anniversary a few days later, and he  admitted that at times he had not been as appreciative of her as she deserved.  “I’m very lucky, because you just don’t know what you’re getting into when you  get married,” he said. “You have an intuitive feeling about things. I couldn’t  have done better, because not only is Laurene smart and beautiful, she’s turned  out to be a really good person.” For a moment he teared up. He talked about his  other girlfriends, particularly Tina Redse, but said he ended up in the right  place. He also reflected on how selfish and demanding he could be. “Laurene had  to deal with that, and also with me being sick,” he said. “I know that living  with me is not a bowl of cherries.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>几天以后，他和鲍威尔将会庆祝他们结婚20周年。他承认，有时候他没有给予她应得的感谢。“我非常幸运，因为当你结婚的时候你根本不知道未来将会怎样。”他说，“你都是凭直觉。我没法干得更漂亮了，因为劳伦不仅聪明漂亮，而且事实证明她是个非常好的人。”他的眼睛湿润了。他谈起其他的女朋友，尤其是蒂娜·莱德斯，但是说他最终作了正确的选择。他还反省了他是多么的自私和苛刻。“劳伦要应付这一切，还要照顾我的病况，”他说，“我知道跟我生活在一起可不是件享受的事情。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Among his selfish  traits was that he tended not to remember anniversaries or birthdays. But in  this case, he decided to plan a surprise. They had gotten married at the  Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite, and he decided to take Powell back there on their anniversary.  But when Jobs called, the place was fully booked. So he had the hotel approach  the people who had reserved the suite where he and Powell had stayed and ask if  they would relinquish it. “I offered to pay for another weekend,” Jobs  recalled, “and the man was very nice and said, ‘Twenty years, please take it,  it’s yours.’”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>他种种的自私特征之一，就是他经常不记得纪念日或生日。但这一次，他决定策划一个惊喜。他们当年在优山美地的阿瓦尼酒店举行的婚礼，他决定在结婚纪念日时再带鲍威尔去那里。但是当乔布斯打电话去时，酒店房间已经预订满了。他请酒店联系上预订了当初他和鲍威尔结婚时住的套房的人，询问他们是否愿意放弃。“我提出为他们支付另一个周末的费用。”乔布斯回忆说，“那人非常好，他说，‘20年，拿去吧，房间是你们的了。’”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>He found the  photographs of the wedding, taken by a friend, and had large prints made on  thick paper boards and placed in an elegant box. Scrolling through his iPhone,  he found the note that he had composed to be included in the box and read it  aloud:</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>随后他还找出一个朋友拍摄的结婚照，然后放大印在厚厚的纸板上，装在一个精美的盒子里。他翻看着自己的iPhone，找到当时他写了放在盒子里的那段话，大声读了出来：</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>We  didn’t know much about each other twenty years ago. We were guided by our  intuition; you swept me off my feet. It was snowing when we got married at the  Ahwahnee. Years passed, kids came, good times, hard times, but never bad times.  Our love and respect has endured and grown. We’ve been through so much together  and here we are right back where we started 20 years ago—older, wiser—with  wrinkles on our faces and hearts. We now know many of life’s joys, sufferings,  secrets and wonders and we’re still here together. My feet have never returned  to the ground.</p>
  <p>By the end of the  recitation he was crying uncontrollably. When he composed himself, he noted  that he had also made a set of the pictures for each of his kids. “I thought  they might like to see that I was young once.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p><p>20年前我们相知不多。我们跟着感觉走，你让我着迷得飞上了天。当我们在阿瓦尼举行婚礼时天在下雪。很多年过去了，有了孩子们，有美好的时候，有艰难的时候，但从来没有过糟糕的时候。我们的愛和荨敬经历了时间的考验而且与日俱增。我们一起经历了那么多，现在我们回到20年前开始的地方——老了，也更有智慧了——我们的脸上和心上都有了皱纹。我们现在了解了很多生活的欢乐、痛苦、秘密和奇迹，我们依然在一起。我的双脚从未落回地面。</p>
<p>读完一段，他已经泣不成声。哭过之后，他说他给每个孩子都做了一套照片。“我想他们可能愿意看到我也曾经年轻过。”</p></div></div>

 

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><h3><a name="s2" id="s2"></a>iCloud</h3> </p>
<p>In 2001 Jobs had a  vision: Your personal computer would serve as a “digital hub” for a variety of  lifestyle devices, such as music players, video recorders, phones, and tablets.  This played to Apple’s strength of creating end-to-end products that were  simple to use. The company was thus transformed from a high-end niche computer  company to the most valuable technology company in the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><h3>iCloud</h3>

<p>2001年乔布斯就预见到：你的个人计算机将成为日常生活中的多种电子设备——例如音乐播放器、摄像机、移动电话和平板电脑——的“数字中枢”。这正与苹果创造简单易用的端到端一体化产品的能力相契合，就这样这家公司从一个高端小众计算机公司转变为全球最有价值的科技公司。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>By 2008 Jobs had  developed a vision for the next wave of the digital era. In the future, he  believed, your desktop computer would no longer serve as the hub for your  content. Instead the hub would move to “the cloud.” In other words, your  content would be stored on remote servers managed by a company you trusted, and  it would be available for you to use on any device, anywhere. It would take him  three years to get it right.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>到2008年，乔布斯已经预见到数字时代的下一个浪潮。他相信，未来你的桌上电脑将不再会是你的内容中枢。取而代之，中枢将被转移到“云端”。换句话说，你的内容将被存储在你所信任的公司管理的远程服务器上，你可以在任何地方任何设备上使用。接下来乔布斯用了三年时间实现这个设想。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>He began with a false  step. In the summer of 2008 he launched a product called MobileMe, an expensive  ($99 per year) subscription service that allowed you to store your address book,  documents, pictures, videos, email, and calendar remotely in the cloud and to  sync them with any device. In theory, you could go to your iPhone or any  computer and access all aspects of your digital life. There was, however, a big  problem: The service, to use Jobs’s terminology, sucked. It was complex,  devices didn’t sync well, and email and other data got lost randomly in the  ether. “Apple’s MobileMe Is Far Too Flawed to Be Reliable,” was the headline on  Walt Mossberg’s review in the <em>Wall Street Journal.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>他起初走错了一步。2008年夏天他发布了一个叫做MobileMe的产品，是一项昂贵的收费服务（每年99美元），允许你把通讯录、文件、图片、视频、邮件和日历存储在云端，可以在任何设备上同步。理论上，你可以在你的iPhone或任何计算机上接入你的数字生活的方方面面。然而存在一个很大的问题，用乔布斯的话说，这项服务烂透了。它非常复杂，设备同步得不好，邮件和其他数据会随机丢失。沃尔特·莫斯伯格在《华尔街日报》上刊登评论文章，大标题是“苹果的MobileMe漏涧百出难以信赖”。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs was furious. He  gathered the MobileMe team in the auditorium on the Apple campus, stood  onstage, and asked, “Can anyone tell me what MobileMe is supposed to do?” After  the team members offered their answers, Jobs shot back: “So why the fuck  doesn’t it do that?” Over the next half hour he continued to berate them.  “You’ve tarnished Apple’s reputation,” he said. “You should hate each other for  having let each other down. Mossberg, our friend, is no longer writing good  things about us.” In front of the whole audience, he got rid of the leader of  the MobileMe team and replaced him with Eddy Cue, who oversaw all Internet  content at Apple. As <em>Fortune</em>’s Adam Lashinsky reported in a dissection  of the Apple corporate culture, “Accountability is strictly enforced.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯怒不可遏。他把MobileMe团队召集到苹果园区的礼堂，站在台上问，“有没有谁能告诉我MobileMe是要做什么用的?”团队成员回答后，乔布斯追问道：那他妈的为什么它做不了那个？”接下来半个小时他一直在斥责他们。“你们玷污了苹果的声誉，”他说，“你们应该相互憎恨，因为你们令彼此失望。连我们的朋友莫斯伯格都不再写赞美我们的文章了。”大庭广众之下，他炒掉了MobileMe团队的负责人，换成了埃迪·库埃，库埃当时负责苹果所有的互联网内容。如《财富》杂志的亚当·拉辛斯基在对苹果企业文化的分析文章中所说，“问责制得到了严格执行。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>By 2010 it was clear  that Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and others were aiming to be the company that  could best store all of your content and data in the cloud and sync it on your  various devices. So Jobs redoubled his efforts. As he explained it to me that  fall:</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>到2010年，显然谷歌、亚马逊、微软等公司显然都在力争成为可以最好地存储你的内容和数据，并在你的各种设备上进行同步的公司。因此乔布斯加倍努力。那年秋天他向我作了如下说明：</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>We  need to be the company that manages your relationship with the cloud—streams  your music and videos from the cloud, stores your pictures and information, and  maybe even your medical data. Apple was the first to have the insight about  your computer becoming a digital hub. So we wrote all of these apps—iPhoto,  iMovie, iTunes—and tied in our devices, like the iPod and iPhone and iPad, and  it’s worked brilliantly. But over the next few years, the hub is going to move  from your computer into the cloud. So it’s the same digital hub strategy, but  the hub’s in a different place. It means you will always have access to your  content and you won’t have to sync.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>我们要成为管理你与“云端”之间关系的公司——从“云端”中流畅地播放你的音乐和视频，存储你的图片和信息，甚至包括你的医疗数据。苹果率先认识到你的计算机会成为一个数字中枢。因此我们编写了这些应用——iPhoto、iMovie、iTunes——并将它们与我们的设备整合在一起，例如iPod,iPhone和iPad，效果棒极了。但是在接下来的几年间，这个中抠将从你的计算机转移到“云端”。因此这是同一个数字中柩策略，但是中枢的位置变了。这意味着你总是能访问你的内容而且不必再同步。</p></div></div>

<p>It’s important that we  make this transformation, because of what Clayton Christensen calls “the innovator’s  dilemma,” where people who invent something are usually the last ones to see  past it, and we certainly don’t want to be left behind. I’m going to take  MobileMe and make it free, and we’re going to make syncing content simple. We  are building a server farm in North Carolina. We can provide all the syncing  you need, and that way we can lock in the customer.</p>

</div>
<div class="right"><p>我们作这样的转型非常重要，正如克莱顿·克里斯坦森所说的“创新者的窘境”，即发明了某个事物的人往往是最后一个看到它过时的，而我们当然不想落在后面。我会让MobileMe免费，我们会让同步内容变得简单。我们正在北卡罗来纳州建一个服务器群。我们可以提供你需要的所有同步，那样我们就可以锁定客户。</p></div></div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

  <p>Jobs discussed this  vision at his Monday morning meetings, and gradually it was refined to a new  strategy. “I sent emails to groups of people at 2   a.m. and batted things around,” he recalled. “We think about  this a lot because it’s not a job, it’s our life.” Although some board members,  including Al Gore, questioned the idea of making MobileMe free, they supported  it. It would be their strategy for attracting customers into Apple’s orbit for  the next decade.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯在每周一的晨会上讨论这个设想，渐渐形成了一个新战略。“我在凌晨两点给各团队的人发邮件，对问题进行充分讨论。”他回忆说，“我们对此作了很多思考，因为它不是一项工作，它是我们的生命。”尽管一些董事会成员，包括阿尔·戈尔在内，质疑让MobileMe免费的想法，但他们还是支持了它。这将是他们未来十年把客户圈进苹果领地的关键战略。</p></div></div>

<p>The new service was  named iCloud, and Jobs unveiled it in his keynote address to Apple’s Worldwide  Developers Conference in June 2011. He was still on medical leave and, for some  days in May, had been hospitalized with infections and pain. Some close friends  urged him not to make the presentation, which would involve lots of preparation  and rehearsals. But the prospect of ushering in another tectonic shift in the  digital age seemed to energize him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>新的服务被命名为iCloud，2011年6月由乔布斯在苹果全球开发者大会（Apple-sWorldwideDeveloperConference）上发布。他还在休病假，而且在5月还因为感染和疼痛住院数天。一些好朋友劝他不要作这个演讲，因为这需要作很多准备和彩排。但是在数字时代开启又一次结构调整的前景似乎让他充满力量。</p></div></div>

<p>When he came onstage  at the San Francisco Convention Center, he was wearing a VONROSEN black  cashmere sweater on top of his usual Issey Miyake black turtleneck, and he had  thermal underwear beneath his blue jeans. But he looked more gaunt than ever.  The crowd gave him a prolonged standing ovation—“That always helps, and I  appreciate it,” he said—but within minutes Apple’s stock dropped more than $4,  to $340. He was making a heroic effort, but he looked weak.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>当他在旧金山会议中心登上舞台时，他在平时常穿的三宅一生黑色套头衫外面套了件VcmRosen黑色羊绒衫，还在蓝色牛仔裤里穿了件保暧裤。但是他看起来比任何时候都更加消瘦。观众起立长时间鼓掌——“非常感谢，我深受鼓舞。”他说——但是几分钟内苹果的股价就下跌超过4美元，到了340美元。他在作着悲壮的努力，但是他看起来非常虚弱。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>He handed the stage  over to Phil Schiller and Scott Forstall to demo the new operating systems for  Macs and mobile devices, then came back on to show off iCloud himself. “About  ten years ago, we had one of our most important insights,” he said. “The PC was  going to become the hub for your digital life. Your videos, your photos, your  music. But it has broken down in the last few years. Why?” He riffed about how  hard it was to get all of your content synced to each of your devices. If you  have a song you’ve downloaded on your iPad, a picture you’ve taken on your  iPhone, and a video you’ve stored on your computer, you can end up feeling like  an old-fashioned switchboard operator as you plug USB cables into and out of  things to get the content shared. “Keeping these devices in sync is driving us  crazy,” he said to great laughter. “We have a solution. It’s our next big  insight. We are going to demote the PC and the Mac to be just a device, and we  are going to move the digital hub into the cloud.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>他把舞台交给菲尔·席勒和斯科特·福斯托，他们演示了Mac和移动设备的新操作系统，然后乔布斯亲自展示iCloud。“大约十年前，我们有了我们最重要的一个预见，”他说，“PC将成为你数字生活的中枢。你的视频，你的照片，你的音乐。但是在过去几年这个预见破灭了。为什么？”他不厌其烦描述了把所有的内容同步到每一个设备上是多么困难。如果你在iPad上下载了一首歌，用你的iPhone拍了一张照片，在你的电脑上存了一段视频，你就要把USB线在各个设备上插来拔去才能实现这些内容的共享，最后会觉得自己像个旧时的电话接线员。“让这些设备保持同步快把我们逼疯了，”下面的笑声越来越大，“我们有一个解决方案。它是我们的下一个重要预见。我们要把PC和Mac降级为仅仅是一个设备，我们要把数字中枢转移到‘云端’。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs was well aware  that this “big insight” was in fact not really new. Indeed he joked about  Apple’s previous attempt: “You may think, Why should I believe them? They’re  the ones who brought me MobileMe.” The audience laughed nervously. “Let me just  say it wasn’t our finest hour.” But as he demonstrated iCloud, it was clear  that it would be better. Mail, contacts, and calendar entries synced instantly.  So did apps, photos, books, and documents. Most impressively, Jobs and Eddy Cue  had made deals with the music companies (unlike the folks at Google and  Amazon). Apple would have eighteen <em>million</em> songs on its cloud servers.  If you had any of these on any of your devices or computers—whether you had  bought it legally or pirated it—Apple would let you access a high-quality  version of it on all of your devices without having to go through the time and  effort to upload it to the cloud. “It all just works,” he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯非常清楚，这个“重要预见”实际上并不真的很新。他甚至还拿苹果的上一次尝试开玩笑：“你可能会想，我为什么要相信他们？就是他们给了我MobileMe。”观众们忐忑不安地笑着。“权且让我说那不是我们的最佳状态吧。”但是当他演示iCloud时，显然它要更好。邮件、联系人和日历条目瞬间同步。应用、照片、书籍和文件亦是如此。最让人印象深刻的是，乔布斯和埃迪·库埃跟多家音乐公司达成了协议（跟谷歌和亚马逊不同）。苹果的云端服务器将有1800万首歌曲。如果你的任何电子设备或计算机上有这些歌曲中的任何一首——无论你是合法购买的还是盗版的——苹果将允许你在所有设备上使用这首歌的高质量版本，而无须费时费力把它上传到“云端”。“就是这么简单。”他说。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>That simple  concept—that everything would just work seamlessly—was, as always, Apple’s  competitive advantage. Microsoft had been advertising “Cloud Power” for more  than a year, and three years earlier its chief software architect, the  legendary Ray Ozzie, had issued a rallying cry to the company: “Our aspiration  is that individuals will only need to license their media once, and use any of  their . . . devices to access and enjoy their media.” But Ozzie had quit  Microsoft at the end of 2010, and the company’s cloud computing push was never  manifested in consumer devices. Amazon and Google both offered cloud services  in 2011, but neither company had the ability to integrate the hardware and  software and content of a variety of devices. Apple controlled every link in  the chain and designed them all to work together: the devices, computers,  operating systems, and application software, along with the sale and storage of  the content.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>这个简单的概念——一切都将无缝连接——一如既往地是苹果的竞争优势。微软已经对其云计算“CloudPower”大肆宣传了一年多，而早在三年前其首席软件架构师，传奇的雷·奥兹（RayOzzie），就曾向全公司发出了振奋人心的动员：“我们的愿望是人们只需要购买一次多媒体内容，然后就可以用他们的……任何电子设备接入和享用。”但是奥兹在2010年底辞职，而微软的云计算从未在消费类电子设备上实现。亚马逊和谷歌都在2011年推出了云服务，但是他们都没有能力整合硬件、软件和各种电子设备中的内容。苹果控制这个产业链上的每一个环节，可以通过设计使之全都共同工作：电子设备、计算机、操作系统、应用软件加上内容的销售和存储。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Of course, it worked  seamlessly only if you were using an Apple device and stayed within Apple’s  gated garden. That produced another benefit for Apple: customer stickiness.  Once you began using iCloud, it would be difficult to switch to a Kindle or  Android device. Your music and other content would not sync to them; in fact  they might not even work. It was the culmination of three decades spent  eschewing open systems. “We thought about whether we should do a music client  for Android,” Jobs told me over breakfast the next morning. “We put iTunes on  Windows in order to sell more iPods. But I don’t see an advantage of putting  our music app on Android, except to make Android users happy. And I don’t want  to make Android users happy.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>当然，只有当你使用某款苹果设备、待在苹果的封闭空间里时，这一切才能无缝合作。这就为苹果带来了另一个好处：消费者黏合度。一且你开始使用iCloud,就会很难切换到Kindle或安卓设备。你的音乐和其他内容无法同步到那些设备上；事实上，它们可能会无法工作。苹果30年来抵制开放系统的努力达到了高xdx潮。“我们思考了是否要为安卓做一个音乐应用，”第二天吃早餐时他告诉我，“我们把iTunes装到Windows上以便能销售更多iPod。但是我没看到把我们的音乐应用装到安卓系统上有什么好处，除了让安卓的用户高兴之外。而我不想让安卓的用户高兴。”</p></div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><h3><a name="s3" id="s3"></a>A New Campus</h3>
<p>When Jobs was  thirteen, he had looked up Bill Hewlett in the phone book, called him to score  a part he needed for a frequency counter he was trying to build, and ended up  getting a summer job at the instruments division of Hewlett-Packard. That same  year HP bought some land in Cupertino to expand its calculator division.  Wozniak went to work there, and it was on this site that he designed the Apple  I and Apple II during his moonlighting hours.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><h3>新园区</h3>

<p>乔布斯12岁时，从电话簿上査到了比尔·休利特，给他打电话要一个自己在尝试制作频率计数器时用到的零件，结果得到了在惠普仪器部做暑期工作的机会。也就是在那年，惠普在库比蒂诺置地扩建计算器部门。沃兹尼亚克去那儿工作，就是在那里，他利用夜里的时间设计了AppleI和AppleII电脑。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>When HP decided in  2010 to abandon its Cupertino campus, which was just about a mile east of  Apple’s One Infinite Loop headquarters, Jobs quietly arranged to buy it and the  adjoining property. He admired the way that Hewlett and Packard had built a  lasting company, and he prided himself on having done the same at Apple. Now he  wanted a showcase headquarters, something that no West Coast technology company  had. He eventually accumulated 150 acres, much of which had been apricot  orchards when he was a boy, and threw himself into what would become a legacy  project that combined his passion for design with his passion for creating an  enduring company. “I want to leave a signature campus that expresses the values  of the company for generations,” he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>惠普2010年决定弃用库比蒂诺园区，这一园区就在苹果的无限循环路1号楼总部东侧1英里处。乔布斯悄悄地安排买下了惠普的园区和毗邻的物业。他欣赏休利特和帕卡德打造一家传世公司的方式，也很自豪自己在苹果做了同样的事情。现在他想要一个能展示苹果形象的总部，这在西海岸的科技公司中是前所未有的。他最终聚积了150英亩土地，其中大部分在他少年时代还是杏树园。他投身到新园区的设计建设中，这将是一个传世的项目，融入了他对设计的激情和他对创建一家传世公司的热情。“我想留下一个标志性的园区，可以体现这家公司的价值观，代代相传。”他说。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>He hired what he  considered to be the best architectural firm in the world, that of Sir Norman  Foster, which had done smartly engineered buildings such as the restored  Reichstag in Berlin and 30 St. Mary Axe in London. Not surprisingly, Jobs got  so involved in the planning, both the vision and the details, that it became  almost impossible to settle on a final design. This was to be his lasting  edifice, and he wanted to get it right. Foster’s firm assigned fifty architects  to the team, and every three weeks throughout 2010 they showed Jobs revised  models and options. Over and over he would come up with new concepts, sometimes  entirely new shapes, and make them restart and provide more alternatives.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>他聘请了他认为是世界上最好的建筑公司——诺曼·福斯特爵士（SirNormanFoster）的公司，该公司曾经修建了很多设计精美的建筑，如复原柏林的国会大厦，以及伦敦的圣玛丽斧街30号。不出所料，乔布斯深度参与到建筑规划中，事无巨细都要过问，以至于几乎无法形成最终的设计方案。这将是他的传世之作，他要力求完美。福斯特的公司派出了50名建筑师，2010年全年，他们每隔三个星期都要给乔布斯看改进过的模型和各种选择方案。他会一次又一次地提出新的概念，有时甚至是全新的形状，让这些建筑师从头再来并提供更多的备选方案。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>When he first showed  me the models and plans in his living room, the building was shaped like a huge  winding racetrack made of three joined semicircles around a large central  courtyard. The walls were floor-to-ceiling glass, and the interior had rows of  office pods that allowed the sunlight to stream down the aisles. “It permits  serendipitous and fluid meeting spaces,” he said, “and everybody gets to  participate in the sunlight.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>当他第一次在他的起居室向我展示那些模型和规划时，这个建筑的形状就像一条蜿蜒的巨型跑道，由三个相连的半圆组成，环绕着一个巨大的中心庭院。墙壁是落地窗，内部是一排排的办公室，阳光可以直射在过道上。“这样大家会面的空间就随处可见，方便灵活。”他说，“而且每个人都能够晒到太阳。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The next time he  showed me the plans, a month later, we were in Apple’s large conference room  across from his office, where a model of the proposed building covered the  table. He had made a major change. The pods would all be set back from the  windows so that long corridors would be bathed in sun. These would also serve  as the common spaces. There was a debate with some of the architects, who  wanted to allow the windows to be opened. Jobs had never liked the idea of  people being able to open things. “That would just allow people to screw things  up,” he declared. On that, as on other details, he prevailed.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>下一次他再给我看规划时，已是一个月之后。我们在他办公室对面的大会议室里，桌子上放着建筑模型。他已经作了一个重要改动。所有的办公室都会跟落地窗有一段距离，这样长长的走廊就会沐浴着阳光，还可以作为公共空间。他跟一些建筑师有一个争论，建筑师希望这些窗子可以打开，而乔布斯从来不喜欢让人们能够打开东西的想法。“那只会让人们把东西搞砸。”他宣称。在这一点上，如在其他细节上一样，他赢了。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>When he got home that  evening, Jobs showed off the drawings at dinner, and Reed joked that the aerial  view reminded him of male genitalia. His father dismissed the comment as  reflecting the mind-set of a teenager. But the next day he mentioned the  comment to the architects. “Unfortunately, once I’ve told you that, you’re  never going to be able to erase that image from your mind,” he said. By the  next time I visited, the shape had been changed to a simple circle.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>当晚他回家后，在晚餐上展示了设计图，里德开玩笑说那个建筑从空中看去让他想到男性生殖器。乔布斯把这个评论当做里德青春期的心理反应而不屑一顾。然而第二天他向建筑师们提起了这个说法。“很不幸，一旦有人这样跟你说了，你就永远无法把那个形象从你头脑中抹去。”他说。等到我下次见他时，建筑的形状已经被改成了一个简单的环形。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The new design meant  that there would not be a straight piece of glass in the building. All would be  curved and seamlessly joined. Jobs had long been fascinated with glass, and his  experience demanding huge custom panes for Apple’s retail stores made him  confident that it would be possible to make massive curved pieces in quantity.  The planned center courtyard was eight hundred feet across (more than three  typical city blocks, or almost the length of three football fields), and he showed  it to me with overlays indicating how it could surround St. Peter’s Square in  Rome. One of his lingering memories was of the orchards that had once dominated  the area, so he hired a senior arborist from Stanford and decreed that 80% of  the property would be landscaped in a natural manner, with six thousand trees.  “I asked him to make sure to include a new set of apricot orchards,” Jobs  recalled. “You used to see them everywhere, even on the corners, and they’re  part of the legacy of this valley.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>新的设计意味着在整个建筑中将没有一块平直的玻璃。一切都是弧形的并加以无缝连接。乔布斯长久以来一直迷恋玻璃，而他为苹果零售店定制巨型落地窗的经验使他非常自信地认为，量产巨大的弧形玻璃是可能的。规划中的中心庭院直径有800英尺（要比3个典型的城市街区还长，或几乎相当于3个橄榄球场的长度），他通过重叠幻灯片向我展示它可以将罗马的圣彼得广场围绕进来。他挥之不去的记忆之一就是曾经覆盖这里大部分区域的果园，因此他从斯坦福聘请了一位资深园艺家，要求园区80%的区域都是自然风貌，有6000株树木。“我让他要确保有一片新的杏树园，”乔布斯说，“以前你在哪儿都能见到杏树园，甚至是在街角上，它们是珪谷遗产的一部分。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>By June 2011 the plans  for the four-story, three-million-square-foot building, which would hold more  than twelve thousand employees, were ready to unveil. He decided to do so in a  quiet and unpublicized appearance before the Cupertino City Council on the day after  he had announced iCloud at the Worldwide Developers Conference.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>到2011年6月，这座共4层、300万平方英尺、可容纳12000多名员工的建筑终于规划完成，准备公布于众。乔布斯决定在全球开发者大会发布iCloud的第二天，低调而非公开地向库比蒂诺市议会报告这件事。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Even though he had  little energy, he had a full schedule that day. Ron Johnson, who had developed  Apple’s stores and run them for more than a decade, had decided to accept an  offer to be the CEO of J.C. Penney, and he came by Jobs’s house in the morning  to discuss his departure. Then Jobs and I went into Palo Alto to a small yogurt  and oatmeal café called Fraiche, where he talked animatedly about possible  future Apple products. Later that day he was driven to Santa Clara for the  quarterly meeting that Apple had with top Intel executives, where they  discussed the possibility of using Intel chips in future mobile devices. That  night U2 was playing at the Oakland Coliseum, and Jobs had considered going.  Instead he decided to use that evening to show his plans to the Cupertino  Council.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>尽管他精力有限，但他那天的日程安排得很满。罗恩·约翰逊创建了苹果商店并经营了十多年，现在决定要去J·C·彭尼公司（J.C.Penney）做CEO，那天早晨他来乔布斯家讨论他辞职的相关事宜。之后乔布斯和我去帕洛奥图一个叫Fmiche的卖酸奶和燕麦粥的小咖啡厅，在那儿他兴致勃勃地谈论苹果产品的前景。当天晚些时候司机送他去圣克拉拉参加苹果和英特尔最髙管理层的季度例会，讨论未来把英特尔芯片用到移动设备上的可能性。当晚，U2在奥克兰大体育场举行演唱会，乔布斯本来考虑去看。但是他决定用这个晚上向库比蒂诺市议会展示他的园区规划。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Arriving without an  entourage or any fanfare, and looking relaxed in the same black sweater he had  worn for his developers conference speech, he stood on a podium with clicker in  hand and spent twenty minutes showing slides of the design to council members.  When a rendering of the sleek, futuristic, perfectly circular building appeared  on the screen, he paused and smiled. “It’s like a spaceship has landed,” he said.  A few moments later he added, “I think we have a shot at building the best  office building in the world.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>乔布斯轻车简从来到市议会，穿着他在全球开发者大会上的那件黑色毛衣，看起来很放松。他站在讲台前，手里拿着遥控器，用20多分钟的时间向议员们展示了园区设计的幻灯片。当那简洁的、未来主义的、正圆形的建筑的透视图出现在屏幕上时，乔布斯停下来微笑着。“它就像一艘飞船降落了。”他说。过了一会儿他又说，“我想我们搞不好会造出一座世界上最棒的写字楼。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The following Friday,  Jobs sent an email to a colleague from the distant past, Ann Bowers, the widow  of Intel’s cofounder Bob Noyce. She had been Apple’s human resources director  and den mother in the early 1980s, in charge of reprimanding Jobs after his  tantrums and tending to the wounds of his coworkers. Jobs asked if she would  come see him the next day. Bowers happened to be in New York, but she came by  his house that Sunday when she returned. By then he was sick again, in pain and  without much energy, but he was eager to show her the renderings of the new  headquarters. “You should be proud of Apple,” he said. “You should be proud of  what we built.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>之后的周五，乔布斯给一位很久以前的同事安·鲍尔斯（AmiBowers）发了封邮件，她是英特尔的联合创始人鲍勃·诺伊斯的遗孀。她在20世纪80年代初期曾担任苹果的人力资源总监和女训导，负责在乔布斯发脾气以后训斥他并安慰受伤的同事们。乔布斯问她第二天是否可以来看他。鲍尔斯刚巧在纽约，但回来后周日就去了乔布斯家。当时他又已经很虚弱了，疼痛发作，没什么精神，但却迫不及待地向鲍尔斯展示新总部大楼的透视图。“你应该为苹果而骄傲，”他说，“你应该为我们所创造的东西而骄傲。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Then he looked at her  and asked, intently, a question that almost floored her: “Tell me, what was I  like when I was young?”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>然后他看着她，专注地问了一个几乎让她站立不稳的问题：“告诉我，我年轻的时候是什么样子？”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Bowers tried to give  him an honest answer. “You were very impetuous and very difficult,” she  replied. “But your vision was compelling. You told us, ‘The journey is the  reward.’ That turned out to be true.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p>鲍尔斯尽量诚实地回答了他。“你那时非常冲动，非常难以相处，”她说，“但是你的视野让人折服。你告诉我们，‘过程就是奖励。’结果表明你说得没错。”</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>“Yes,” Jobs answered.  “I did learn some things along the way.” Then, a few minutes later, he repeated  it, as if to reassure Bowers and himself. “I did learn some things. I really  did.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><p><!--中文-->
“是的，”乔布斯回答，“我确实在这个过程中学到了一些东西。”然后，过了几分钟，他又重复了一遍，像是在让鲍尔斯和他自己安心。“我确实学到了一些东西。真的。”
