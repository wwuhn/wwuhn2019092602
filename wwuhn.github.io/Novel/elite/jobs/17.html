<div class="left"><h3>Flying High</h3>
<p>The launch of the  Macintosh in January 1984 propelled Jobs into an even higher orbit of  celebrity, as was evident during a trip to Manhattan he took at the time. He  went to a party that Yoko Ono threw for her son, Sean Lennon, and gave the nine-year-old  a Macintosh. The boy loved it. The artists Andy Warhol and Keith Haring were  there, and they were so enthralled by what they could create with the machine  that the contemporary art world almost took an ominous turn. “I drew a circle,”  Warhol exclaimed proudly after using QuickDraw. Warhol insisted that Jobs take  a computer to Mick Jagger. When Jobs arrived at the rock star’s townhouse,  Jagger seemed baffled. He didn’t quite know who Jobs was. Later Jobs told his  team, “I think he was on drugs. Either that or he’s brain-damaged.” Jagger’s  daughter Jade, however, took to the computer immediately and started drawing  with MacPaint, so Jobs gave it to her instead.</p>

<h3>春风得意</h3>
<p>麦金塔电脑的发布使得乔布斯的名气如日中天，他的一次曼哈顿之行便是佐证。当时，他应邀参加小野洋子（YokoOno）为儿子肖恩·列侬（SeanLennon）举办的派对，并送给9岁的肖恩一台麦金塔电脑；肖恩很喜欢。艺术家安迪·沃霍尔（AndyWarhol）和基斯·哈林（KeithHaring）当时也在，他们如此着迷于自己通过麦金塔做出来的东西，以致当代艺术几乎发生了天翻地覆的转折。在用过QuickDraw软件之后，沃霍尔自豪地惊呼：“我画了个圈。”沃霍尔坚持要乔布斯也给摇滚明星米克·贾格尔（MickJagger）送一台麦金塔。当乔布斯和比尔·阿特金森一同来到贾格尔的联排别墅时，贾格尔有些疑惑。他并不太知道乔布斯是谁。后来，乔布斯告诉自己的团队：“我觉得他一定是嗑了药，要么就是脑残了。”不过，贾格尔的女儿杰德立刻喜欢上了这台电脑，并开始用MacPaint软件画画，于是乔布斯把电脑送给了她。

<p>He bought the  top-floor duplex apartment that he’d shown Sculley in the San Remo on Manhattan’s  Central Park West and hired James Freed of I. M. Pei’s firm to renovate it, but  he never moved in. (He would later sell it to Bono for $15 million.) He also  bought an old Spanish colonial–style fourteen-bedroom mansion in Woodside, in  the hills above Palo Alto, that had been built by a copper baron, which he  moved into but never got around to furnishing.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯买下了曼哈顿中央公园西街圣雷莫公寓顶楼的复式住宅，他曾带斯卡利看过这处房产，又聘请了贝聿铭公司的詹姆斯·弗里德（JamesFreed）对其进行翻修，但是由于对细节一贯挑剔，他从未搬进去过。后来，他把这处公寓以1500万美元的价格卖给了波诺。他还在伍德赛德购置了一幢老式西班牙殖民地风格的豪宅，有14间卧室，可以俯瞰帕洛奥图。这幢豪宅最初由美国铜矿大亨丹尼尔·考恩·杰克林（DanielCowanJackling）建造，乔布斯搬了进去，但从未着手进行装修。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>At Apple his status  revived. Instead of seeking ways to curtail Jobs’s authority, Sculley gave him  more: The Lisa and Macintosh divisions were folded together, with Jobs in  charge. He was flying high, but this did not serve to make him more mellow.  Indeed there was a memorable display of his brutal honesty when he stood in  front of the combined Lisa and Macintosh teams to describe how they would be merged.  His Macintosh group leaders would get all of the top positions, he said, and a  quarter of the Lisa staff would be laid off. “You guys failed,” he said,  looking directly at those who had worked on the Lisa. “You’re a B team. B  players. Too many people here are B or C players, so today we are releasing  some of you to have the opportunity to work at our sister companies here in the  valley.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>在苹果公司，他的地位也开始恢复。斯卡利并未设法削弱乔布斯的权力，相反给了他更多控制权。负责丽萨电脑和麦金塔电脑的部门合并了，由乔布斯管理。他正一路高升，春风得意，却没有因此变得更加成熟。事实上，当乔布斯站在丽萨团队和麦金塔团队成员面前，告诉大家将如何进行合并时，他展示出了冷酷而坦诚的一面，让人难以忘怀。乔布斯表示，合并后的所有高层职位都将由他所率领的麦金塔部门中的领导者担任，而丽萨电脑部门1/4的员工都会被裁员。“你们失败了，”他直视着丽萨团队的人说道，“你们是二等团队，二等队员。这里许多人都是二等或三等员工，因此今天，我们遣散你们其中一部分人，让你们有机会在硅谷的兄弟公司工作。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Bill Atkinson, who had  worked on both teams, thought it was not only callous, but unfair. “These  people had worked really hard and were brilliant engineers,” he said. But Jobs  had latched onto what he believed was a key management lesson from his  Macintosh experience: You have to be ruthless if you want to build a team of A  players. “It’s too easy, as a team grows, to put up with a few B players, and  they then attract a few more B players, and soon you will even have some C  players,” he recalled. “The Macintosh experience taught me that A players like  to work only with other A players, which means you can’t indulge B players.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>比尔·阿特金森同时供职于丽萨团队和麦金塔团队，他觉得这种合并方式不仅冷酷无情，而且不公平。“这些人工作非常努力，他们是杰出的工程师。”他说道。但是，乔布斯坚持认为：如果你想建设一个由一流队员组成的团队，就必须要狠。这是他从麦金塔团队中总结出的重要管理经验。“这个道理很简单，团队扩张时，如果吸收了几名二流队员，他们就会招来更多二流队员，很快，你的团队里甚至还会出现三流队员，”他回忆道，“麦金塔的经验告诉我，一流队员只喜欢同一流队员合作，这就意味着你不能容忍二流队员。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>For the time being,  Jobs and Sculley were able to convince themselves that their friendship was  still strong. They professed their fondness so effusively and often that they  sounded like high school sweethearts at a Hallmark card display. The first  anniversary of Sculley’s arrival came in May 1984, and to celebrate Jobs lured  him to a dinner party at Le Mouton Noir, an elegant restaurant in the hills  southwest of Cupertino. To Sculley’s surprise, Jobs had gathered the Apple  board, its top managers, and even some East Coast investors. As they all  congratulated him during cocktails, Sculley recalled, “a beaming Steve stood in  the background, nodding his head up and down and wearing a Cheshire Cat smile  on his face.” Jobs began the dinner with a fulsome toast. “The happiest two  days for me were when Macintosh shipped and when John Sculley agreed to join  Apple,” he said. “This has been the greatest year I’ve ever had in my whole  life, because I’ve learned so much from John.” He then presented Sculley with a  montage of memorabilia from the year.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>当时，乔布斯和斯卡利相信彼此之间的友谊侬然牟固。他们经常热情洋溢地表达对彼此的喜爱，看上去就像贺卡上的一对髙中情侣。1984年5月，斯卡利加入苹果一周年。为了庆祝，乔布斯为他在黑羊餐厅举行晚宴，那儿是库比蒂诺西南丘陵一带的一家高雅餐厅。让斯卡利吃惊的是，乔布斯还叫来了苹果公司的董事会、高层管理人员，甚至一些东海岸投资者。在鸡尾酒会上，大家都向斯卡利表示祝贺，他回忆道：“史蒂夫神采奕奕地站在人群中，不住地点头，脸上挂着柴郡猫式的微笑。”乔布斯以一旬夸张的祝酒词为晚宴做了开场白：“对我来说，最快乐的日子有两个，一个是麦金塔交付运行的时候，另一个是约翰·斯卡利同意加入苹果公司的那天。”他说道，“今年是我整个人生中最棒的一年，因为我从约翰那里学到了很多。”接着，他送给斯卡利一本当年大事记的影集。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>In response, Sculley  effused about the joys of being Jobs’s partner for the past year, and he  concluded with a line that, for different reasons, everyone at the table found  memorable. “Apple has one leader,” he said, “Steve and me.” He looked across  the room, caught Jobs’s eye, and watched him smile. “It was as if we were  communicating with each other,” Sculley recalled. But he also noticed that  Arthur Rock and some of the others were looking quizzical, perhaps even  skeptical. They were worried that Jobs was completely rolling him. They had  hired Sculley to control Jobs, and now it was clear that Jobs was the one in  control. “Sculley was so eager for Steve’s approval that he was unable to stand  up to him,” Rock recalled.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>作为回应，斯卡利也滔滔地讲述了过去一年与乔布斯搭档的欣岛之情，他的结束语让在场的每个人都感到难忘，虽然原因各异。“苹果公司只有一个领导者，”他说，“那就是史蒂夫和我。”他眼光望向房间的另一头，与史蒂夫目光交错，看到他脸上的笑容。“当时就好像我们彼此心有灵犀一样。”斯卡利回忆道。但是，他也注意到亚瑟·罗克和其他一些人的古怪表情，或许甚至是怀疑的神色。他们担心乔布斯正完全控制着斯卡利，他们雇用斯卡利是为了控制乔布斯，现在很明显，控制杈却在乔布斯手上。“斯卡利非常渴望得到史蒂夫的认可，以至于他无法对史蒂夫保持强硬态度。”罗克后来回忆道。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Keeping Jobs happy and  deferring to his expertise may have seemed like a smart strategy to Sculley.  But he failed to realize that it was not in Jobs’s nature to share control.  Deference did not come naturally to him. He began to become more vocal about  how he thought the company should be run. At the 1984 business strategy  meeting, for example, he pushed to make the company’s centralized sales and  marketing staffs bid on the right to provide their services to the various  product divisions. (This would have meant, for example, that the Macintosh  group could decide not to use Apple’s marketing team and instead create one of  its own.) No one else was in favor, but Jobs kept trying to ram it through.  “People were looking to me to take control, to get him to sit down and shut up,  but I didn’t,” Sculley recalled. As the meeting broke up, he heard someone  whisper, “Why doesn’t Sculley shut him up?”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>对斯卡利来说，让乔布斯髙兴并听从他的专业意见，这可能是一个明智的策略；他认为这样比采取对立的态度要好，这没错。但是，他未能认识到，在乔布斯的天性里，控制权不能共享。乔布斯并没有自然而然学会服丛，他开始愈发强烈地表达自己对公司运营的看法。例如，在1984年的公司经营战略会议上，乔布斯逼迫苹果公司的市场和销售部门通过竞标的方式获得为各产品部门的服务权。没有人赞成这种方式，但是乔布斯不断努力想要通过这个方案。“人们指望我来掌控局面，让乔布斯坐下闭嘴，但我没有这么做。”斯卡利回忆说。会议不欢而散，他听到有人低声说，“为什么斯卡利不让他闭嘴？”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>When Jobs decided to  build a state-of-the-art factory in Fremont to manufacture the Macintosh, his  aesthetic passions and controlling nature kicked into high gear. He wanted the  machinery to be painted in bright hues, like the Apple logo, but he spent so  much time going over paint chips that Apple’s manufacturing director, Matt  Carter, finally just installed them in their usual beige and gray. When Jobs  took a tour, he ordered that the machines be repainted in the bright colors he  wanted. Carter objected; this was precision equipment, and repainting the  machines could cause problems. He turned out to be right. One of the most  expensive machines, which got painted bright blue, ended up not working  properly and was dubbed “Steve’s folly.” Finally Carter quit. “It took so much  energy to fight him, and it was usually over something so pointless that  finally I had enough,” he recalled.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯决定在弗雷蒙建一家最先进的工厂，用以生产麦金塔，这时他的审美激情和控制天性越发达到极致。他想要把机械设备也涂成明亮的色调，就像苹果的彩虹标志一样；但是，他在颜色选择上花了太多时间，以至于苹果公司的生产总监马特·卡特（MattCarter）最后决定就用原本的米色或灰色。乔布斯去工厂参观时，又下令把机器重新喷刷成他想要的鲜艳色彩。卡特反对，他认为这都是些精密设备，重新喷刷可能会造成问题。卡特说的没错。一台最贵的机器被喷成亮蓝色后就再也无法正常工作了，它被人戏称为“史蒂夫的愚作”。最后，卡特辞职了。“跟他抗争太费精力了，而且常常是为一些毫无意义的东西，我受够了。”他回忆道。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs tapped as a  replacement Debi Coleman, the spunky but good-natured Macintosh financial  officer who had once won the team’s annual award for the person who best stood  up to Jobs. But she knew how to cater to his whims when necessary. When Apple’s  art director, Clement Mok, informed her that Jobs wanted the walls to be pure  white, she protested, “You can’t paint a factory pure white. There’s going to  be dust and stuff all over.” Mok replied, “There’s no white that’s too white  for Steve.” She ended up going along. With its pure white walls and its bright  blue, yellow, and red machines, the factory floor “looked like an Alexander  Calder showcase,” said Coleman.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯找来麦金塔团队的财务主管黛比·科尔曼接任卡特的职位。科尔曼精力充沛、为人和善，麦金塔团队有一个对抗乔布斯最佳人物年度大奖，科尔曼曾赢得该奖。但她也知道如何在必要的时候迎合乔布斯的奇想。苹果公司的艺术总监克莱门特·莫克（ClementMok）通知科尔曼说，乔布斯想把墙都刷成纯白色，她反对说：“工厂不能刷成纯白色，那样到处都会是灰尘和脏东西。”莫克的回复是：“对乔布斯来说，多白都不过分。”科尔曼最后只好随他去了。纯白色的墙壁，亮蓝色、黄色或红色的机器，整个工厂车间“看上去就像亚历山大·考尔德（AlexanderCalder）②的作品展”。科尔曼这样描述。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>When asked about his  obsessive concern over the look of the factory, Jobs said it was a way to  ensure a passion for perfection:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>当被问及为何对工厂的外观如此重视时，乔布斯说，这是保证对完美的激情的一种方式：
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>I’d go out to the  factory, and I’d put on a white glove to check for dust. I’d find it  everywhere—on machines, on the tops of the racks, on the floor. And I’d ask  Debi to get it cleaned. I told her I thought we should be able to eat off the  floor of the factory. Well, this drove Debi up the wall. She didn’t understand  why. And I couldn’t articulate it back then. See, I’d been very influenced by  what I’d seen in Japan. Part of what I greatly admired there—and part of what  we were lacking in our factory—was a sense of teamwork and discipline. If we  didn’t have the discipline to keep that place spotless, then we weren’t going  to have the discipline to keep all these machines running.</p>
<p>One Sunday morning  Jobs brought his father to see the factory. Paul Jobs had always been  fastidious about making sure that his craftsmanship was exacting and his tools  in order, and his son was proud to show that he could do the same. Coleman came  along to give the tour. “Steve was, like, beaming,” she recalled. “He was so  proud to show his father this creation.” Jobs explained how everything worked,  and his father seemed truly admiring. “He kept looking at his father, who  touched everything and loved how clean and perfect everything looked.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>我会到工厂去，戴上一只白色手套检查灰尘。我发现到处都是灰尘——机器上、机架顶部、地板上，然后就叫黛比清理。我跟她说，我们要一尘不染，这让黛比非常恼火，她不明白，为什么要这么干净。而我当时也无法说明这个原因。明白吗？在日本所看到的东西对我影响非常大。我十分钦佩曰本的一部分原因就在于他们的团队精神和纪律意识，而这也是我们的工厂所缺少的东西。如果我们连保持工厂一尘不染都做不到，那么也无法让所有机器都保证运转。</p>
<p>一个周日的早晨，乔布斯把自己的父亲带到了工厂。保罗·乔布斯一向很讲究，要确保自己的工艺严格，工具摆放整齐；史蒂夫很自豪地向父亲展示，自己也能做到这样。科尔曼当时也陪同参观。“史蒂夫当时高兴得不得了，”她回忆说，“他很自豪地向他父亲展示自己的这一创造。”乔布斯向父亲解释工厂的运作方式，保罗似乎很欣赏。“他触摸了每一样东西，非常欣赏这一切干净和完美的程度，乔布斯则一直看着他。”</p>

　　

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Things were not quite  as sweet when Danielle Mitterrand toured the factory. The Cuba-admiring wife of  France’s socialist president Fran?ois Mitterrand asked a lot of questions,  through her translator, about the working conditions, while Jobs, who had grabbed  Alain Rossmann to serve as his translator, kept trying to explain the advanced  robotics and technology. After Jobs talked about the just-in-time production  schedules, she asked about overtime pay. He was annoyed, so he described how  automation helped him keep down labor costs, a subject he knew would not  delight her. “Is it hard work?” she asked. “How much vacation time do they  get?” Jobs couldn’t contain himself. “If she’s so interested in their welfare,”  he said to her translator, “tell her she can come work here any time.” The  translator turned pale and said nothing. After a moment Rossmann stepped in to  say, in French, “M. Jobs says he thanks you for your visit and your interest in  the factory.” Neither Jobs nor Madame Mitterrand knew what happened, Rossmann  recalled, but her translator looked very relieved.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>不过，当法国总统密特朗的夫人达妮埃尔·密特朗来工厂参观时，气氛就不那么融洽了。达妮埃尔对古巴很欣赏，那次是陪同丈夫来进行国事访问的。乔布斯让乔安娜·霍夫曼的丈夫阿兰·罗斯曼来做翻译。密特朗夫人通过自己的翻译人员，就工厂的工作条件问了很多问题，而乔布斯却一直在解释自己先进的机器人和技术。乔布斯谈论了准时生产制（JIT）计划后，密特朗夫人却开始询问工人的加班工资。他很恼火，于是开始描述自动化如何帮助自己压低了劳动成本，他知道这个话题会让她不高兴。“工人的活儿很重吗？”她问道，“他们有多少休假时间？”乔布斯按捺不住了。“如果她对工人的福利这么感兴趣，”他对密特朗夫人的翻译说，“告诉她，随时欢迎她来这儿工作。”翻译听了脸色苍白，什么都没说。过了一会儿，罗斯曼介入进来，用法语说：“夫人，乔布斯说，感谢您的到访及您对工厂的兴趣。”乔布斯和密特朗夫人都不知道到底发生了什么，而那位翻译顿时感到彻底解脱。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Afterward, as he sped  his Mercedes down the freeway toward Cupertino, Jobs fumed to Rossmann about  Madame Mitterrand’s attitude. At one point he was going just over 100 miles per  hour when a policeman stopped him and began writing a ticket. After a few  minutes, as the officer scribbled away, Jobs honked. “Excuse me?” the policeman  said. Jobs replied, “I’m in a hurry.” Amazingly, the officer didn’t get mad. He  simply finished writing the ticket and warned that if Jobs was caught going  over 55 again he would be sent to jail. As soon as the policeman left, Jobs got  back on the road and accelerated to 100. “He absolutely believed that the  normal rules didn’t apply to him,” Rossmann marveled.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>事后，乔布斯开着奔驰车驶上高速公路，准备回库比蒂诺，一路上依然对密待朗夫人的态度感到很生气。不安的罗斯曼后来回忆说，车速超过每小时100英里后，一个警察拦下了车，准备开票。几分钟后，警察正潦草地书写罚单，乔布斯按起了喇叭。“有什么问题吗？”警察问道。乔布斯回答说：“我赶时间。”令人惊讶的是，那位警察并没有生气，而只是照常开完罚单，并警吿，如果乔布斯的车速再超过每小时55英里并被抓住，就要进监狱。结果警察刚离开，乔布斯就重新回到高速路上，再次加速到每小时100英里。“他肯定认为常规对自己无效。”罗斯曼对此惊叹不已。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>His wife, Joanna  Hoffman, saw the same thing when she accompanied Jobs to Europe a few months  after the Macintosh was launched. “He was just completely obnoxious and  thinking he could get away with anything,” she recalled. In Paris she had  arranged a formal dinner with French software developers, but Jobs suddenly  decided he didn’t want to go. Instead he shut the car door on Hoffman and told  her he was going to see the poster artist Folon instead. “The developers were  so pissed off they wouldn’t shake our hands,” she said.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>在麦金塔电脑发布几个月后，罗斯曼的妻子乔安娜·霍夫曼陪同乔布斯前往欧洲，她见识到了同样的情形。“他非常令人讨厌，觉得自己可以不受任何事情的束缚。”她回忆说。在巴黎的时候，她已经安排好同法国的软件开发商们进行正式晚宴，结果乔布斯突然决定不想去了。他扔下霍夫曼独自上车，说自己要去拜访艺术家福隆（Folon）。“结果他的缺席让开发商们很生气，都不愿意跟我们握手。”她说道。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>In Italy, he took an  instant dislike to Apple’s general manager, a soft rotund guy who had come from  a conventional business. Jobs told him bluntly that he was not impressed with  his team or his sales strategy. “You don’t deserve to be able to sell the Mac,”  Jobs said coldly. But that was mild compared to his reaction to the restaurant  the hapless manager had chosen. Jobs demanded a vegan meal, but the waiter very  elaborately proceeded to dish out a sauce filled with sour cream. Jobs got so  nasty that Hoffman had to threaten him. She whispered that if he didn’t calm  down, she was going to pour her hot coffee on his lap.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>在意大利的时候，乔布斯打一见面就不喜欢苹果公司在当地的总经理——一位肉乎乎圆嘟嘟的男士，他以前在传统行业工作。乔布斯直截了当地对他说，自己对其团队及销售策略都不以为然。“你不配销售Mac。”乔布斯冷冷地说。不过，这位倒霉的经理受到的对待还算是好的了，他挑选的餐厅更惨。乔布斯点了一份素食，但服务员还是煞费苦心地往他的盘子里倒上了含有酸奶油的酱料。乔布斯的反应令人讨厌至极，以至于霍夫曼不得不靠威胁来阻止他。她低声对乔布斯说，如果他再不冷静下来，就把自己的热咖啡倒在他腿上。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The most substantive  disagreements Jobs had on the European trip concerned sales forecasts. Using  his reality distortion field, Jobs was always pushing his team to come up with  higher projections. He kept threatening the European managers that he wouldn’t  give them any allocations unless they projected bigger forecasts. They insisted  on being realistic, and Hoffmann had to referee. “By the end of the trip, my  whole body was shaking uncontrollably,” Hoffman recalled.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>欧洲之行中，最根本的分歧集中在销售预测上。在其现实扭曲力场的影响下，乔布斯总是让自己的团队作出更髙的预测。在最初撰写麦金塔商业计划时，他这样做过，但这份计划最后又反过来给他带来了麻烦。在欧洲的时候他又故伎重演，不停地威胁欧洲的经理们，只有拿出更髙的预测数据，才能得到他的拨款。经理们坚持实事求是，霍夫曼不得不从中进行调和。“行程最后，我整个身子都不自主地颤抖。”霍夫曼回忆道。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>It was on this trip  that Jobs first got to know Jean-Louis Gassée, Apple’s manager in France.  Gassée was among the few to stand up successfully to Jobs on the trip. “He has  his own way with the truth,” Gassée later remarked. “The only way to deal with  him was to out-bully him.” When Jobs made his usual threat about cutting down  on France’s allocations if Gassée didn’t jack up sales projections, Gassée got  angry. “I remember grabbing his lapel and telling him to stop, and then he  backed down. I used to be an angry man myself. I am a recovering assaholic. So  I could recognize that in Steve.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>此次欧洲之行，他第一次见到了让-路易·加西（Jean-LouisGassée）——苹果公司的法国经理。加西是少数几个成功对抗乔布斯的人。“他对事实有自己的见解，”加西后来评论道，“对付他的唯一方法就是以其人之道还治其人之身，反过来更狠地威胁他。”当乔布斯像通常一样，威胁说如果不调高销售预测，他就会削减对法国公司的拨款，加西彻底怒了。“我记得自己当时抓住他的衣领，叫他少来这套，然后他就退缩了。”加西说道，“我以前也是个火气大的人，是个浑球。所以我也能看出史蒂夫身上的这种性格。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Gassée was impressed,  however, at how Jobs could turn on the charm when he wanted to. Fran?ois  Mitterrand had been preaching the gospel of <em>informatique pour tous</em>—computing  for all—and various academic experts in technology, such as Marvin Minsky and  Nicholas Negroponte, came over to sing in the choir. Jobs gave a talk to the  group at the Hotel Bristol and painted a picture of how France could move ahead  if it put computers in all of its schools. Paris also brought out the romantic  in him. Both Gassée and Negroponte tell tales of him pining over women while  there.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>不过，乔布斯能游刃有余地收放自己的个人魅力，这让加西印象深刻。密特朗发起了“大众信息技术计划”（Informatiquepourtous）——宣扬普及大众电脑，技术领域的各种学术专家都前来参与其中，如马文·明斯基（MarvinMinsky）和尼古拉斯·尼葛洛庞帝（NicholasNegroponte）。在法国时，乔布斯在布里斯托酒店面向该计划的参与者发表了讲话，向人们描绘了一幅图景一如果法国所有的学校都配备电脑，这个国家将会出现多大的进步。巴黎也唤醒了乔布斯的浪漫心情。加西和尼葛洛庞帝都曾讲过乔布斯在那里为伊人憔悴的故事——</p>

<div class="left"><h3><a name="s2"></a>Falling</h3> </p>
<p>After the burst of  excitement that accompanied the release of Macintosh, its sales began to taper  off in the second half of 1984. The problem was a fundamental one: It was a  dazzling but woefully slow and underpowered computer, and no amount of hoopla  could mask that. Its beauty was that its user interface looked like a sunny  playroom rather than a somber dark screen with sickly green pulsating letters  and surly command lines. But that led to its greatest weakness: A character on  a text-based display took less than a byte of code, whereas when the Mac drew a  letter, pixel by pixel in any elegant font you wanted, it required twenty or  thirty times more memory. The Lisa handled this by shipping with more than  1,000K RAM, whereas the Macintosh made do with 128K.</p>
</div>

<h3>一落千丈</h3>
<p>麦金塔电脑刚发布时引发了一阵热潮，但到1984年下半年，其销量就开始急剧下滑。问题是根本性的。这是一台虽然精美却运行缓慢、动力不足的电脑，再多的宣传也无法掩盖它的缺点。它的美丽之处在于，其界面看上去像一间阳光明媚的游戏室，而不是一块闪烁着绿色字母和呆板命令行的幽暗屏幕。然而，这也造成了麦金塔最大的弱点。采用文本方式显示，一个字符只占用不到一个字节；而Mac采用像素方式显示用户想要的优雅字体，这样，每个字符所需要的内存就比前者多出二三十倍。丽萨电脑为了解决这一问题，将内存扩展至1000K以上，而麦金塔的内存只有128K。</p>

<div class="left">
<p>Another problem was  the lack of an internal hard disk drive. Jobs had called Joanna Hoffman a “Xerox  bigot” when she fought for such a storage device. He insisted that the  Macintosh have just one floppy disk drive. If you wanted to copy data, you  could end up with a new form of tennis elbow from having to swap floppy disks  in and out of the single drive. In addition, the Macintosh lacked a fan,  another example of Jobs’s dogmatic stubbornness. Fans, he felt, detracted from  the calm of a computer. This caused many component failures and earned the  Macintosh the nickname “the beige toaster,” which did not enhance its  popularity. It was so seductive that it had sold well enough for the first few  months, but when people became more aware of its limitations, sales fell. As  Hoffman later lamented, “The reality distortion field can serve as a spur, but  then reality itself hits.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>另一个问题在于，没有内置硬盘驱动。乔安娜·霍夫曼曾坚持，要使用内置硬盘作为存储设备，乔布斯因此称她为“施乐偏执狂”①。麦金塔只有一个软盘驱动器，你如果想要复制数据，有可能会落下肘关节发炎的毛病，因为你得来回装卸软盘。此外，麦金塔没有风扇，这是乔布斯武断顽固的又一佐证。他觉得，风扇会增大电脑的嗓音。没有风扇散热造成了很多组件故障，并让麦金塔赢得了“米色烤面包机”的绰号，而这一绰号显然无益于提髙产品的流行度。麦金塔电脑外形诱人，因而在发布的头几个月，销量非常好；但当人们逐渐认识到这款电脑的局限后，销量便逐渐减少。霍夫曼后来感叹道：“现实扭曲力场可以作为一种鞭策，但最后总是要被现实打破的。”

<div class="left">
<p>At the end of 1984,  with Lisa sales virtually nonexistent and Macintosh sales falling below ten  thousand a month, Jobs made a shoddy, and atypical, decision out of  desperation. He decided to take the inventory of unsold Lisas, graft on a  Macintosh-emulation program, and sell them as a new product, the “Macintosh  XL.” Since the Lisa had been discontinued and would not be restarted, it was an  unusual instance of Jobs producing something that he did not believe in. “I was  furious because the Mac XL wasn’t real,” said Hoffman. “It was just to blow the  excess Lisas out the door. It sold well, and then we had to discontinue the  horrible hoax, so I resigned.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>1984年底，丽萨电脑销量几乎为零，麦金塔的销量跌至每月10000台以下，乔布斯在绝望之下作出了一个低劣、不合规矩的决定。他决定在库存的丽萨电脑上安装麦金塔仿真程序，并作为新产品出售，命名为“麦金塔XL”。由于丽萨电脑已停产，且不会再投入生产，因此乔布斯这次要做自己都不看好的东西，就有点反常。“我很愤怒，因为它根本就不是什么MacXL。”霍夫曼说道，“这么做的目的就是为了把剩下的丽萨电脑都卖出去。它卖得很好，但接下来我们不得不停止这个可怕的骗局，我也因此辞职了。”

<p>The dark mood was  evident in the ad that was developed in January 1985, which was supposed to  reprise the anti-IBM sentiment of the resonant “1984” ad. Unfortunately there was a fundamental  difference: The first ad had ended on a heroic, optimistic note, but the  storyboards presented by Lee Clow and Jay Chiat for the new ad, titled “Lemmings,”  showed dark-suited, blindfolded corporate managers marching off a cliff to  their death. From the beginning both Jobs and Sculley were uneasy. It didn’t  seem as if it would convey a positive or glorious image of Apple, but instead  would merely insult every manager who had bought an IBM.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>这种负面情绪在苹果公司1985年1月的广告中也有所体现，这次的广告试图再次激起人们反对IBM的情绪共鸣，就像“1984”广告那样。不幸的是，这两则广告之间有一个根本区别：“1984”广告以一种英勇乐观的基调结束；但是这次，李·克劳和杰伊·恰特（JayChiat）写的新故事脚本，名为“旅鼠”（Lemmings）,内容则是身着深色西装、被蒙住双眼的企业管理者迈向悬崖，走向死亡。从一开始，乔布斯和斯卡利就感到不安，这个故事似乎无法传达出苹果正面和光辉的形象，相反，只会侮辱购买过电脑的每一个企业管理者。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs and Sculley asked  for other ideas, but the agency folks pushed back. “You guys didn’t want to run  ‘1984’ last year,” one of them  said. According to Sculley, Lee Clow added, “I will put my whole reputation,  everything, on this commercial.” When the filmed version, done by Ridley  Scott’s brother Tony, came in, the concept looked even worse. The mindless  managers marching off the cliff were singing a funeral-paced version of the <em>Snow  White</em> song “Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho,” and the dreary filmmaking made it even  more depressing than the storyboards portended. “I can’t believe you’re going  to insult businesspeople across America by running that,” Debi Coleman yelled  at Jobs when she saw the ad. At the marketing meetings, she stood up to make  her point about how much she hated it. “I literally put a resignation letter on  his desk. I wrote it on my Mac. I thought it was an affront to corporate  managers. We were just beginning to get a toehold with desktop publishing.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯和斯卡利要求广告公司想想其他创意，但广告公司拒绝了。其中一位员工说：“你们去年还不想要‘1984’广告呢。”根据斯卡利的说法，李·克劳补充道：“我会把自己的全部名声和一切都压在这个广告上。”然而当雷德利·斯科特的弟弟托尼把广告拍出来后，这个创意显得更糟了。行尸走肉般的经理们朝着悬崖前进，口中唱着葬礼版的《白雪公主》插曲，“嘿——嚯，嘿——嚯”，而枯燥的电影制作使得这部广告片比故事脚本还要沉闷。“我简直不敢相信，你竟然要放这么个广告来羞辱全美国的商务人士！”黛比·科尔曼看过广告后冲乔布斯吼道。营销会议上，她站起来表达了自己对这个广告的无比厌恶。“我郑重其事地在乔布斯桌上放了一封辞职信。信是在我的Mac电脑上打出来的。我觉得这个广吿对企业管理者是一种侮辱。我们可是刚刚才在个人电脑领域立足。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Nevertheless Jobs and  Sculley bent to the agency’s entreaties and ran the commercial during the Super  Bowl. They went to the game together at Stanford Stadium with Sculley’s wife,  Leezy (who couldn’t stand Jobs), and Jobs’s new girlfriend, Tina Redse. When  the commercial was shown near the end of the fourth quarter of a dreary game,  the fans watched on the overhead screen and had little reaction. Across the  country, most of the response was negative. “It insulted the very people Apple  was trying to reach,” the president of a market research firm told <em>Fortune</em>.  Apple’s marketing manager suggested afterward that the company might want to  buy an ad in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> apologizing. Jay Chiat threatened  that if Apple did that his agency would buy the facing page and apologize for  the apology.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>不过，乔布斯和斯卡利屈从于广吿公司的意愿，在美国橄榄球“超级碗”大赛中播放该段广告。两人一同前往斯坦福体育场观看比赛，同行的还有斯卡利的妻子利兹——她受不了乔布斯，以及乔布斯情绪亢奋的新女友蒂娜·莱德斯（TinaRaise）。在这场沉闷比赛的第四节的尾声时，苹果公司的广告播出了。球迷们抬头看着大屏幕，几乎没有反应。而在整个美国范围内，大多数反馈都是负面的。“它侮辱了苹果的目标用户群。”一家市场调研公司的总裁告诉《财富》杂志。苹果公司的营销经理随后建议，公司可能需要在《华尔街日报》上买个版面进行道歉。杰伊·恰特则威胁道，如果苹果敢这么做，他的广告公司就会买下旁边的版面，为苹果的道歉广告道歉。
</p>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs’s discomfort,  with both the ad and the situation at Apple in general, was on display when he  traveled to New York in January to do another round of one-on-one press  interviews. Andy Cunningham, from Regis McKenna’s firm, was in charge of  hand-holding and logistics at the Carlyle. When Jobs arrived, he told her that  his suite needed to be completely redone, even though it was 10 p.m. and the  meetings were to begin the next day. The piano was not in the right place; the  strawberries were the wrong type. But his biggest objection was that he didn’t  like the flowers. He wanted calla lilies. “We got into a big fight on what a  calla lily is,” Cunningham recalled. “I know what they are, because I had them  at my wedding, but he insisted on having a different type of lily and said I  was ‘stupid’ because I didn’t know what a real calla lily was.” So Cunningham  went out and, this being New York, was able to find a place open at midnight  where she could get the lilies he wanted. By the time they got the room  rearranged, Jobs started objecting to what she was wearing. “That suit’s  disgusting,” he told her. Cunningham knew that at times he just simmered with  undirected anger, so she tried to calm him down. “Look, I know you’re angry,  and I know how you feel,” she said.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>同年1月，乔布斯前往纽约接受一对一的记者采访，其间表露出自己对该广告和苹果公司整体现状的不安。像以前一样，里吉斯·麦肯纳公司的安迪·坎宁安负责乔布斯在卡莱尔酒店的安排和后勤。乔布斯到达酒店后，命令坎宁安重新布置一遍套房，而当时已是晚上10点，第二天就要接受采访。另外，他觉得钢琴摆放的位置也不对，草莓也不是他想要的品种。但是，最大的问题在于他不喜欢房间里摆放的花。他想要马蹄莲。“我们为了马蹄莲到底什么样大吵了一场，”坎宁安说道，“我知道马蹄莲是什么，因为我结婚的时候就用过，但是他坚持要另一种类型的百合花，并且说我很蠢，因为我不知道真正的马蹄莲什么样。”于是坎宁安只好出去买。幸好这里是纽约，她这么晚还能买到乔布斯要的那种百合花。房间重新布置好后，乔布斯又开始挑剔她的穿着。“这身套装好恶心。”他对她说。坎宁安知道乔布斯有时会爆发出无名怒火，因此她试图让他平静下来。“你看，我知道你在生气，我也知道你的感受。”她说。

<div class="left"><h3><a name="s3"></a>Thirty Years Old</h3> </p>
<p>Turning thirty is a  milestone for most people, especially those of the generation that proclaimed  it would never trust anyone over that age. To celebrate his own thirtieth, in  February 1985, Jobs threw a lavishly formal but also playful—black tie and  tennis shoes—party for one thousand in the ballroom of the St. Francis Hotel in  San Francisco. The invitation read, “There’s an old Hindu saying that goes, ‘In  the first 30 years of your life, you make your habits. For the last 30 years of  your life, your habits make you.’ Come help me celebrate mine.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<h3>30岁</h3>
<p>对于大多数人，尤其是那些宣称绝不能相信30岁以上的人的那代人来说，30岁是一个里程碑。1985年2月，为了庆祝自己的30岁生日，乔布斯在旧金山圣弗朗西斯酒店的宴会厅举办了一场非常正式但又好玩的派对。他邀请了1000人出席，大家都打着黑领带，穿着网球鞋。请柬上写着：“有句古老的印度谚语是这样说的，‘在人生的头30年里，你养成习惯；在后30年，习惯塑造你。’过来跟我庆祝我的30岁吧。”</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>One table featured  software moguls, including Bill Gates and Mitch Kapor. Another had old friends  such as Elizabeth Holmes, who brought as her date a woman dressed in a tuxedo.  Andy Hertzfeld and Burrell Smith had rented tuxes and wore floppy tennis shoes,  which made it all the more memorable when they danced to the Strauss waltzes  played by the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>宴会上，有一桌坐的都是软件业巨头，包括比尔·盖茨和米切尔·卡普尔。另一桌坐着他的老朋友，如伊丽莎白·霍姆斯，她还带来了一位身着燕尾服的女伴。安迪·赫茨菲尔德和伯勒尔·史密斯穿着租来的礼服，脚上踩着松软的网球鞋，一旁旧金山交响乐团演奏着施特劳斯的圆舞曲，两人伴着音乐起舞的样子使这场派对更加令人难忘。
</p>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Ella Fitzgerald  provided the entertainment, as Bob Dylan had declined. She sang mainly from her  standard repertoire, though occasionally tailoring a song like “The Girl from  Ipanema” to be about the boy from Cupertino. When she asked for some requests,  Jobs called out a few. She concluded with a slow rendition of “Happy Birthday.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>由于鲍勃·迪伦拒绝了邀请，派对上献唱的是埃拉·菲茨杰拉德（EllaFitzgerald）。她主要唱自己的传统曲目，偶尔也会改编一下曲目，如将《伊帕内玛姑娘》（TheGirlFromIpanema）唱成“库比蒂诺小伙儿”。她要听众点歌，乔布斯就点了几首。最后，她用一首慢节奏的《生日快乐》结束了表演。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Sculley came to the  stage to propose a toast to “technology’s foremost visionary.” Wozniak also  came up and presented Jobs with a framed copy of the Zaltair hoax from the 1977  West Coast Computer Faire, where the Apple II had been introduced. The venture  capitalist Don Valentine marveled at the change in the decade since that time.  “He went from being a Ho Chi Minh look-alike, who said never trust anyone over  thirty, to a person who gives himself a fabulous thirtieth birthday with Ella  Fitzgerald,” he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>斯卡利走上台，提议为“技术领域最重要的远见者”干杯。沃兹尼亚克也走上台，送给乔布斯一个相框，里面装着一张1977年西海岸电脑节上子虚乌有的“扎尔泰”电脑宣传单，AppleII电脑就是在该电脑节上发布的。唐·瓦伦丁对乔布斯十年间的转变感到惊奇。“他以前就跟胡志明似的，认为绝不能相信任何一个30岁以上的人，现在却同埃拉·菲茨杰拉德一起，给自己办了个这么棒的30岁生日宴会。”他说道。
</p>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Many people had picked  out special gifts for a person who was not easy to shop for. Debi Coleman, for  example, found a first edition of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s <em>The Last Tycoon</em>.  But Jobs, in an act that was odd yet not out of character, left all of the  gifts in a hotel room. Wozniak and some of the Apple veterans, who did not take  to the goat cheese and salmon mousse that was served, met after the party and  went out to eat at a Denny’s.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>许多人都为这个挑剔的家伙准备了特别的礼物。例如，黛比·科尔曼就为他找到了第一版的《最后的大亨》（TheLastTycoon），这是弗兰西斯·斯科特·菲茨杰拉德（F.ScottFitzgerald）的一部小说。乔布斯却将所有礼物都留在了酒店房间里，这个行为虽奇怪但也与他的性格相符。乔布斯一件礼物都没拿回家。沃兹尼亚克和一些苹果公司的元老没有吃派对上的山羊乳干酪和鲑鱼慕斯，派对结束后，他们聚在一起去丹尼餐厅吃饭。

<p>“It’s rare that you see  an artist in his 30s or 40s able to really contribute something amazing,” Jobs  said wistfully to the writer David Sheff, who published a long and intimate  interview in <em>Playboy</em> the month he turned thirty. “Of course, there are  some people who are innately curious, forever little kids in their awe of life,  but they’re rare.” The interview touched on many subjects, but Jobs’s most  poignant ruminations were about growing old and facing the future:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“一个艺术家到了三四十岁还能做出惊人的东西来，这是很罕见的。”乔布斯对作家戴维·谢菲（DavidSheff）说道，言语中流露出渴望之情。谢菲于乔布斯30岁生日的当月，在《花花公子》杂志上发表了一篇言语亲密的长篇访谈。“当然，有些人天生就有求知欲，永远像小孩一样对生命充满敬畏，但是这种人很少。”这次采访涉及许多话题，但是在变老和面对未来的问题上，乔布斯发出了最尖锐的反思：
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Your thoughts construct patterns  like scaffolding in your mind. You are really etching chemical patterns. In  most cases, people get stuck in those patterns, just like grooves in a record,  and they never get out of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>你的想法会在自己的头脑中创建出模式，就像脚手架一样。大脑中的化学反应蚀剜出思维的模式。在大多数情况下，人们会陷入这些模式，就像唱片上的针槽，并且再也出不来了。

<p>I’ll always stay  connected with Apple. I hope that throughout my life I’ll sort of have the  thread of my life and the thread of Apple weave in and out of each other, like  a tapestry. There may be a few years when I’m not there, but I’ll always come  back. . . .</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>我会永远保持与苹果的关系。我希望这一生，能让自己的生命历程和苹果的命运彼此交错，就像编织一幅挂毯那样。可能我会离开苹果几年，但我终究是会回来的。而这就是我可能想要做的事情。关于我，应该谨记的关键一点就是，我仍然是个学生，我仍然在新兵训练营。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>If you want to live  your life in a creative way, as an artist, you have to not look back too much.  You have to be willing to take whatever you’ve done and whoever you were and  throw them away.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>如果你想有创造性地过自己的生活，像艺术家一样，就不能常常回顾过去。不管你做过什么，以前是怎么样，你都必须心甘情愿地接受一切，并将一切樾诸脑后。

<p>The more the outside  world tries to reinforce an image of you, the harder it is to continue to be an  artist, which is why a lot of times, artists have to say, “Bye. I have to go.  I’m going crazy and I’m getting out of here.” And they go and hibernate  somewhere. Maybe later they re-emerge a little differently.</p>
  <p>With each of those  statements, Jobs seemed to have a premonition that his life would soon be  changing. Perhaps the thread of his life would indeed weave in and out of the  thread of Apple’s. Perhaps it was time to throw away some of what he had been.  Perhaps it was time to say “Bye, I have to go,” and then reemerge later,  thinking differently.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>外界越是试图强化你的形象，你就越难继续做一名艺术家，这也是为什么很多艺术家要说，“再见，我得走了，我要疯了，我要离开这里。”然后他们就离开了，在某处休隐。也许之后他们又会重新出现，变得有些不同。</p>
<p>乔布斯说出这番话，似乎是有预感自己的生命将很快改变。也许他的生命历程确实会与苹果的命运彼此交错，也许他这时候应该将过去的自己拋诸脑后，也许是时候说“再见，我得走了”，然后重新回来，带着不同的思考方式。</p>

<div class="left"><h3><a name="s4"></a>Exodus</h3>
<p>Andy Hertzfeld had  taken a leave of absence after the Macintosh came out in 1984. He needed to  recharge his batteries and get away from his supervisor, Bob Belleville, whom  he didn’t like. One day he learned that Jobs had given out bonuses of up to  $50,000 to engineers on the Macintosh team. So he went to Jobs to ask for one.  Jobs responded that Belleville had decided not to give the bonuses to people  who were on leave. Hertzfeld later heard that the decision had actually been  made by Jobs, so he confronted him. At first Jobs equivocated, then he said,  “Well, let’s assume what you are saying is true. How does that change things?”  Hertzfeld said that if Jobs was withholding the bonus as a reason for him to  come back, then he wouldn’t come back as a matter of principle. Jobs relented,  but it left Hertzfeld with a bad taste.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<h3>出埃及记</h3>
<p>1984年麦金塔发布后，安迪·赫茨菲尔德休了一段时间假。他需要重新充电，并远离自己的上司鲍勃·贝尔维尔。赫茨菲尔德不喜欢他。有一天，他得知乔布斯给麦金塔团队的工程师每人发放了最髙5万美元的奖金，他们团队工程师的工资此前一直没有丽萨团队的髙。于是他找到乔布斯要自己的那一份。乔布斯回复说，是贝尔维尔决定休假的人没有奖金。赫茨菲尔德后来听说这其实是乔布斯的决定，于是来找乔布斯对质。最开始，乔布斯含糊其辞，后来又说，“好吧，就算你说的是真的，又对事情有什么改变呢？”赫茨菲尔德说，如果乔布斯扣着奖金不发是为了让我回来，那么出于原则，他根本就不会回来。乔布斯态度软化了，这却给赫茨菲尔德留下了不好的印象。

　　</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>When his leave was  coming to an end, Hertzfeld made an appointment to have dinner with Jobs, and  they walked from his office to an Italian restaurant a few blocks away. “I  really want to return,” he told Jobs. “But things seem really messed up right  now.” Jobs was vaguely annoyed and distracted, but Hertzfeld plunged ahead.  “The software team is completely demoralized and has hardly done a thing for  months, and Burrell is so frustrated that he won’t last to the end of the  year.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>在休假快结束时，赫茨菲尔德与乔布斯约好共进晚餐，他们从办公室出来，走过几个街区，来到了一家意大利餐馆。“我真的想回来，”他告诉乔布斯。“但是现在情况好像真的很糟糕。”乔布斯隐约有些心烦意乱，但是赫茨菲尔德继续说下去，“软件开发团队士气彻底低落，几个月都没做出什么东西来，伯勒尔也非常沮丧，年底之前就会走人。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>At that point Jobs cut  him off. “You don’t know what you’re talking about!” he said. “The Macintosh  team is doing great, and I’m having the best time of my life right now. You’re  just completely out of touch.” His stare was withering, but he also tried to  look amused at Hertzfeld’s assessment.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>这时，乔布斯打断了他。“你根本不知道自己在说什么！”他说道，“麦金塔团队现在很棒，我正在享受自己一生中最好的时光。你已经跟我们完全脱节了。”他的眼神里透露出极为挖苦的意味，但又试图表现自己是被赫茨菲尔德的评论逗乐了。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>“If you really believe  that, I don’t think there’s any way that I can come back,” Hertzfeld replied  glumly. “The Mac team that I want to come back to doesn’t even exist anymore.”</p>

<p>“The Mac team had to  grow up, and so do you,” Jobs replied. “I want you to come back, but if you  don’t want to, that’s up to you. You don’t matter as much as you think you do,  anyway.”</p>

<p>Hertzfeld didn’t come  back.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“如果你真的这么认为，那我觉得自己肯定没法回来了。”赫茨菲尔德闷闷不乐地说，“我想要回归的那个Mac团队甚至都已经不复存在了。”</p>
<p>“Mac团队必须成长，你也一样，”乔布斯回应道，“我希望你回来，但是如果你不愿意，那也随你。反正你也并非自己所想象的那样重要。”</p>
<p>因此，赫茨菲尔德没有回来</p>。

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>By early 1985 Burrell  Smith was also ready to leave. He had worried that it would be hard to quit if  Jobs tried to talk him out of it; the reality distortion field was usually too  strong for him to resist. So he plotted with Hertzfeld how he could break free  of it. “I’ve got it!” he told Hertzfeld one day. “I know the perfect way to  quit that will nullify the reality distortion field. I’ll just walk into  Steve’s office, pull down my pants, and urinate on his desk. What could he say  to that? It’s guaranteed to work.” The betting on the Mac team was that even  brave Burrell Smith would not have the gumption to do that. When he finally  decided he had to make his break, around the time of Jobs’s birthday bash, he  made an appointment to see Jobs. He was surprised to find Jobs smiling broadly  when he walked in. “Are you gonna do it? Are you really gonna do it?” Jobs  asked. He had heard about the plan.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>1985年初，伯勒尔·史密斯也准备离开苹果。但他又担心，如果乔布斯试图说服他留下，那么自己就很难离开。乔布斯的现实扭曲力场太强大了，史密斯难以抗拒。于是，他同赫茨菲尔德一起商量如何冲破乔布斯的现实扭曲力场。“我想到了！”有一天，他告诉赫茨菲尔德说，“我想到了一个完美的辞职方法能抵抗他的现实扭曲力场。我会走进史蒂夫的办公室，脱掉裤子，在他的办公桌上小便。对这种事他还能说什么呢？这方法肯定能行。”而Mac团队打赌，即便再勇敢，伯勒尔·史密斯也没胆量这么做。在乔布斯生日聚会前后，他终于决定要豁出去了，他同乔布斯约好了见面。当史密斯走进乔布斯的办公室时，他惊奇地发现乔布斯笑得很开心。“你真的要那么做吗？真的要那么做吗？”乔布斯问他。他已经听说了史密斯的计划。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Smith looked at him.  “Do I have to? I’ll do it if I have to.” Jobs gave him a look, and Smith  decided it wasn’t necessary. So he resigned less dramatically and walked out on  good terms.</p>

<p>He was quickly  followed by another of the great Macintosh engineers, Bruce Horn. When Horn  went in to say good-bye, Jobs told him, “Everything that’s wrong with the Mac  is your fault.”</p>

<p>Horn responded, “Well,  actually, Steve, a lot of things that are right with the Mac are my fault, and  I had to fight like crazy to get those things in.”</p>

<p>“You’re right,”  admitted Jobs. “I’ll give you 15,000 shares to stay.” When Horn declined the  offer, Jobs showed his warmer side. “Well, give me a hug,” he said. And so they  hugged.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>史密斯看着乔布斯。“我真的有必要这么做吗？如果万不得已，我会的。”乔布斯看了他一眼，史密斯又觉得确实没必要这么做。于是，他的辞职并没有那么戏剧化，而且他离开的时候拿到了很好的条件。</p>
<p>很快，另一位了不起的麦金塔工程师布鲁斯·霍恩也决定离开。当他跟乔布斯告别的时候，乔布斯说：“Mac的所有问题都是你的错。”</p>
<p>霍恩回答道：“好吧，史蒂夫，事实上，Mac的许多好处也是我的错，我还得像疯了似的把这些好处都给弄进去。”</p>
<p>“没错。”乔布斯认可了这一回应，“如果你留下，我就给你15000股股票。”霍恩拒绝了，乔布斯就展现出自己温柔的一面。“好吧，来给我个拥抱。”他说。于是，他俩拥抱在一起。</p>

Wozniak was then quietly working as a midlevel engineer in the Apple  II division, serving as a humble mascot of the roots of the company and staying  as far away from management and corporate politics as he could. He felt, with  justification, that Jobs was not appreciative of the Apple II, which remained  the cash cow of the company and accounted for 70% of its sales at Christmas  1984. “People in the Apple II group were being treated as very unimportant by  the rest of the company,” he later said. “This was despite the fact that the  Apple II was by far the largest-selling product in our company for ages, and  would be for years to come.” He even roused himself to do something out of  character; he picked up the phone one day and called Sculley, berating him for  lavishing so much attention on Jobs and the Macintosh division.</p>

<div class="right">
<p>不过，当月最轰动的新闻还是苹果公司创始人之一史蒂夫·沃兹尼亚克的离开。也许是因为个性不同，这两位创始人之间从未有过激烈的冲突。沃兹尼亚克仍然充满梦想和童趣，乔布斯比以往更加紧张易怒。但是，在苹果的管理和战略问题上，两人有着根本的分歧。当时，沃兹尼亚克低调地在AppleII部门做中级工程师，作为公司谦卑的招牌人物而存在，并尽可能地远离管理和公司政治。在他看来，有理由相信乔布斯并不欣赏AppleII；而AppleII电脑仍然是苹果公司的摇钱树，而且1984年圣诞期间，其销量就占公司产品销量的70%。“公司里其他人也认为AppleII团队的成员不重要，”他后来说道，“尽管在当时，AppleII是我们公司多年来销量最大的产品，而且未来几年它仍然可能是最畅销的机型。”沃兹尼亚克甚至强迫自己去做一些不合自己性格的事；有一天，他拿起电话打给斯卡利，痛斥他在乔布斯和麦金塔部门浪费了太多注意力。

<p>Frustrated, Wozniak  decided to leave quietly to start a new company that would make a universal  remote control device he had invented. It would control your television,  stereo, and other electronic devices with a simple set of buttons that you  could easily program. He informed the head of engineering at the Apple II  division, but he didn’t feel he was important enough to go out of channels and  tell Jobs or Markkula. So Jobs first heard about it when the news leaked in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>. In his earnest way, Wozniak had openly answered the  reporter’s questions when he called. Yes, he said, he felt that Apple had been  giving short shrift to the Apple II division. “Apple’s direction has been  horrendously wrong for five years,” he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>沮丧万分的沃兹尼亚克决定悄然离去，创办一家新公司，制造自己发明的万能遥控器。有了这个装置，用户只需通过几个简单的按钮，就能控制家里的电视机、立体声音响和其他电子设备。他将自己的想法告诉了AppleII部门的工程师主管，但觉得自己并不那么重要，没必要通知别的部门，也没必要告诉乔布斯和马库拉。因此，直到看到《华尔街日报》报道，乔布斯才第一次得知此事。当记者致电时，沃兹尼亚克真诚坦率地回答了记者的问题。他说，是的，自己觉得苹果公司怠慢了AppleII部门。“苹果的发展方向已经严重错误，并持续5年了。”他表示。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Less than two weeks  later Wozniak and Jobs traveled together to the White House, where Ronald  Reagan presented them with the first National Medal of Technology. The  president quoted what President Rutherford Hayes had said when first shown a  telephone—“An amazing invention, but who would ever want to use one?”—and then  quipped, “I thought at the time that he might be mistaken.” Because of the  awkward situation surrounding Wozniak’s departure, Apple did not throw a  celebratory dinner. So Jobs and Wozniak went for a walk afterward and ate at a  sandwich shop. They chatted amiably, Wozniak recalled, and avoided any  discussion of their disagreements.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>不到两周后，沃兹尼亚克和乔布斯共同前往白宫，时任美国总统的罗纳德·里根授予他们首届国家技术奖章（NationalMedalofTechnology）。里根引用第19任总统拉瑟福德·海斯（RutherfordHayes）初次见到电话时所说的一句话——“惊人的发明，但是谁想要用这个东西呢？”然后打趣道：“我觉得，他当时可能弄错了。”鉴于沃兹尼亚克离开苹果公司的尷尬情形，苹果公司之后并未举行庆祝晚宴，斯卡利或其他高层也没有来华盛顿。乔布斯和沃兹尼亚克在领奖之后一起出去散步，在一家三明治店吃了些东西。沃兹尼亚克回忆说，他们亲切地聊了聊，避开了任何关于分歧的讨论。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Wozniak wanted to make  the parting amicable. It was his style. So he agreed to stay on as a part-time  Apple employee at a $20,000 salary and represent the company at events and  trade shows. That could have been a graceful way to drift apart. But Jobs could  not leave well enough alone. One Saturday, a few weeks after they had visited  Washington together, Jobs went to the new Palo Alto studios of Hartmut  Esslinger, whose company frogdesign had moved there to handle its design work  for Apple. There he happened to see sketches that the firm had made for  Wozniak’s new remote control device, and he flew into a rage. Apple had a  clause in its contract that gave it the right to bar frogdesign from working on  other computer-related projects, and Jobs invoked it. “I informed them,” he  recalled, “that working with Woz wouldn’t be acceptable to us.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>沃兹尼亚克想让自己和苹果公司之间友好地分手，这是他的风格。于是，他同意兼职的方式，薪酬2万美元，并代表公司出席括动和展览。这是一种渐渐疏远彼此的优雅方式，但是乔布斯心里就没有那么舒服。在华盛顿领奖几周后的一个周六，乔布斯前往哈特穆特·艾斯林格在帕洛奥图的新工作室，他的青蛙设计公司（FrogDesign）为了处理苹果公司的设计而搬到了这里。乔布斯碰巧在那里看到了一些草图，是该公司为沃兹尼亚克的新遥控器设计的，他暴跳如雷。苹果公司同青蛙设计公司的合同中有一条写着，苹果公司有权禁止青蛙设计公司为其他公司做计算机相关产品的设计，乔布斯援引这一条款。“我通知他们，”乔布斯回忆说，“我们不能接受他们做沃兹的项目。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>When the <em>Wall  Street Journal</em> heard what happened, it got in touch with Wozniak, who, as  usual, was open and honest. He said that Jobs was punishing him. “Steve Jobs  has a hate for me, probably because of the things I said about Apple,” he told  the reporter. Jobs’s action was remarkably petty, but it was also partly caused  by the fact that he understood, in ways that others did not, that the look and  style of a product served to brand it. A device that had Wozniak’s name on it  and used the same design language as Apple’s products might be mistaken for  something that Apple had produced. “It’s not personal,” Jobs told the  newspaper, explaining that he wanted to make sure that Wozniak’s remote  wouldn’t look like something made by Apple. “We don’t want to see our design  language used on other products. Woz has to find his own resources. He can’t  leverage off Apple’s resources; we can’t treat him specially.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>《华尔街日报》得知此事后，联系上了沃兹尼亚克，他像往常一样坦率真诚。他说乔布斯在惩罚他。“史蒂夫·乔布斯恨我，可能是因为我针对苹果说的话。”他告诉记者。乔布斯这种行为显得很小气，但他之所以如此，部分原因是他知道产品的外观和风格就是产品品牌的一部分，其他人不像乔布斯这样明白这个道理。如果沃兹尼亚克的设备和苹果公司的产品使用同一种设计语言，就可能会让人误会他的设备是苹果公司的。“这并非私人恩怨。”乔布斯告诉《华尔街日报》，解释说自己想要确保沃兹尼亚克的遥控器不会像苹果生产的东西一样。“我们不想看到自己的设计语言用在别的产品上。沃兹得找到自己的资源。他不能利用苹果的资源，我们不能对他特殊对待。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs volunteered to  pay for the work that frogdesign had already done for Wozniak, but even so the  executives at the firm were taken aback. When Jobs demanded that they send him  the drawings done for Wozniak or destroy them, they refused. Jobs had to send  them a letter invoking Apple’s contractual right. Herbert Pfeifer, the design  director of the firm, risked Jobs’s wrath by publicly dismissing his claim that  the dispute with Wozniak was not personal. “It’s a power play,” Pfeifer told  the <em>Journal</em>. “They have personal problems between them.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>至于青蛙设计公司已经为沃兹尼亚克做了的东西，乔布斯表示愿意个人支付这笔费用。但即便如此，该公司的管理者也都吃了一惊。乔布斯要求青蛙设计公司把为沃兹尼亚克设计的图纸交给自己或毁掉，对方拒绝了。乔布斯不得不向他们发信，援引苹果公司的合同权利。靑眭设计公司的设计总监赫伯特·法伊弗（HerbertPfeifer）冒着激怒乔布斯的风险，公开驳斥乔布斯关于同沃兹尼亚克的争端并非私人恩怨的说法。“他这是仗势欺人，”法伊弗对《华尔街日报》说，“他们之间有私人问题。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Hertzfeld was outraged  when he heard what Jobs had done. He lived about twelve blocks from Jobs, who  sometimes would drop by on his walks. “I got so furious about the Wozniak  remote episode that when Steve next came over, I wouldn’t let him in the house,”  Hertzfeld recalled. “He knew he was wrong, but he tried to rationalize, and  maybe in his distorted reality he was able to.” Wozniak, always a teddy bear  even when annoyed, hired another design firm and even agreed to stay on Apple’s  retainer as a spokesman.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>听说了乔布斯的所作所为后，赫茨菲尔德异常气愤。他家离乔布斯的住处大约相隔12个街区，即使在他离开苹果后，乔布斯有时也会顺路去他家坐坐。“我对于沃兹尼亚克遥控器的事非常气愤，以至于乔布斯后来到我家来，我都没让他进门。”赫茨菲尔德说道，“他知道自己错了，但是试图把自己的所作所为合理化，也许在他自己的现实扭曲力场里，他能做得到。”而沃兹尼亚克即便是生气的时候，也像泰迪熊一样温顺。他换了一家设计公司，甚至同意继续留任苹果公司做发言人。

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><h3><a name="s5"></a>Showdown, Spring 1985</h3>
<p>There were many  reasons for the rift between Jobs and Sculley in the spring of 1985. Some were  merely business disagreements, such as Sculley’s attempt to maximize profits by  keeping the Macintosh price high when Jobs wanted to make it more affordable.  Others were weirdly psychological and stemmed from the torrid and unlikely  infatuation they initially had with each other. Sculley had painfully craved  Jobs’s affection, Jobs had eagerly sought a father figure and mentor, and when  the ardor began to cool there was an emotional backwash. But at its core, the growing  breach had two fundamental causes, one on each side.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<h3>摊牌，1985年春</h3>
<p>1985年春，乔布斯和斯卡利之间出现了裂痕。原因是多方面的。有些只是业务上的分歧，譬如，斯卡利意图维持麦金塔的髙价来达到利润最大化，而乔布斯则想要让它的价格更实惠。另一些就是奇怪的心理因素，源自他们最初对彼此的狂热和不现实的迷恋。斯卡利苦苦渴求乔布斯的喜爱，而乔布斯则渴望在斯卡利身上获得父亲和良师益友般的感觉。当两人的热情开始降温时，就产生了情绪上的反弹。但是，造成两人之间裂痕日益加深的根本原因仍在他们自己身上。

　　</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>For Jobs, the problem  was that Sculley never became a product person. He didn’t make the effort, or  show the capacity, to understand the fine points of what they were making. On  the contrary, he found Jobs’s passion for tiny technical tweaks and design  details to be obsessive and counterproductive. He had spent his career selling  sodas and snacks whose recipes were largely irrelevant to him. He wasn’t  naturally passionate about products, which was among the most damning sins that  Jobs could imagine. “I tried to educate him about the details of engineering,”  Jobs recalled, “but he had no idea how products are created, and after a while  it just turned into arguments. But I learned that my perspective was right.  Products are everything.” He came to see Sculley as clueless, and his contempt  was exacerbated by Sculley’s hunger for his affection and delusions that they  were very similar.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>对乔布斯来说，问题在于斯卡利从来都没有成为一个懂产品的人。他没有努力，也没有显示出自己有能力理解苹果公司所做产品的精妙之处。相反，斯卡利觉得乔布斯太过沉迷于细微的技术调整和设计细节，没有效率。他过去做的工作是销售汽水和零食，产品的配方在很大程度上与自己无关。他对产品也没有天生的热情，而这正是乔布斯所能想象的最深重的罪孽之一。“我试图教会他工程上的细节，”乔布斯后来回忆说，“但是，他不知道产品是怎样创造出来的，一段时间以后，这种培养变成了争论。但我知道，我的观点是正确的。产品就是一切。”他觉得斯卡利很愚蠢。但斯卡利渴望得到乔布斯的喜爱，并且产生了自己和他很相似的幻觉，这更加剧了乔布斯对他的蔑视。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>For Sculley, the  problem was that Jobs, when he was no longer in courtship or manipulative mode,  was frequently obnoxious, rude, selfish, and nasty to other people. He found  Jobs’s boorish behavior as despicable as Jobs found Sculley’s lack of passion  for product details. Sculley was kind, caring, and polite to a fault. At one  point they were planning to meet with Xerox’s vice chair Bill Glavin, and  Sculley begged Jobs to behave. But as soon as they sat down, Jobs told Glavin,  “You guys don’t have any clue what you’re doing,” and the meeting broke up.  “I’m sorry, but I couldn’t help myself,” Jobs told Sculley. It was one of many  such cases. As Atari’s Al Alcorn later observed, “Sculley believed in keeping  people happy and worrying about relationships. Steve didn’t give a shit about  that. But he did care about the product in a way that Sculley never could, and  he was able to avoid having too many bozos working at Apple by insulting anyone  who wasn’t an A player.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>而斯卡利觉得问题出在乔布斯身上，当乔布斯不再处于“求爱期”或有所图时，就常常很令人讨厌、粗鲁、自私并且对其他人脾气不好。斯卡利经历过寄宿学校和大客户销售工作的打磨，他觉得乔布斯的行为粗鲁可鄙，这程度就和乔布斯鄙视他对产品细节缺乏激情一样。斯卡利能和善、关切、彬彬有礼地对待错误，乔布斯则做不到。有一回，他们计划与施乐公司董事会副主席比尔·格拉文（BillGlavin）会面，斯卡利乞求乔布斯到时候不要失礼。然而，刚一就座，乔布斯就跟格拉文说：“你们这些家伙完全不知道自己在做什么。”会面不欢而散。“对不起，但我控制不住自己。”乔布斯告诉斯卡利。这只是许多类似情况中的一例。正如雅达利公司的阿尔·奥尔康后来评论的，“斯卡利想让别人高兴，并会顾及人际关系。史蒂夫对此则不屑一顾。但他对产品的关注又是斯卡利永远达不到的，而且乔布斯会侮辱任何一个算不上一流队员的人，以避免苹果出现太多的笨蛋。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The board became  increasingly alarmed at the turmoil, and in early 1985 Arthur Rock and some  other disgruntled directors delivered a stern lecture to both. They told  Sculley that he was supposed to be running the company, and he should start  doing so with more authority and less eagerness to be pals with Jobs. They told  Jobs that he was supposed to be fixing the mess at the Macintosh division and  not telling other divisions how to do their job. Afterward Jobs retreated to  his office and typed on his Macintosh, “I will not criticize the rest of the  organization, I will not criticize the rest of the organization . . .”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>董事会对于两人关系的动荡越发警觉。1985年初，亚瑟·罗克及其他一些心怀不满的董事对他们俩进行了严厉的训诫。他们告诉斯卡利，本来应该由他来运营公司，他应该用更大的权力履行管理苹果公司的职责，而少花些心思同乔布斯交好。他们告诉乔布斯，他应该解决麦金塔部门内部的混乱状况，而不应该告诉别的部门如何做好本职工作。之后，乔布斯回到办公室，在自己的电脑上打着：“我不再批评公司其他部门，我不再批评公司其他部门。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>As the Macintosh  continued to disappoint—sales in March 1985 were only 10% of the budget  forecast—Jobs holed up in his office fuming or wandered the halls berating  everyone else for the problems. His mood swings became worse, and so did his  abuse of those around him. Middle-level managers began to rise up against him.  The marketing chief Mike Murray sought a private meeting with Sculley at an  industry conference. As they were going up to Sculley’s hotel room, Jobs  spotted them and asked to come along. Murray asked him not to. He told Sculley  that Jobs was wreaking havoc and had to be removed from managing the Macintosh  division. Sculley replied that he was not yet resigned to having a showdown  with Jobs. Murray later sent a memo directly to Jobs criticizing the way he  treated colleagues and denouncing “management by character assassination.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>1985年3月，麦金塔电脑的表现持续令人失望，其销量只有预测的10%,乔布斯躲在自己的办公室里生气，或是在大厅里训斥其他人。他的情绪起伏更大，对周围人的辱骂也更甚。中层主管们开始起来反抗他。营销主管迈克·默里在一个行业会议上与斯卡利私下会面。两人走向斯卡利的酒店房间时，乔布斯看到了，于是要求一起去。默里叫他不要跟过来。默里告诉斯卡利，乔布斯正在造成严重的破坏，必须把他从麦金塔部门的管理层踢走。斯卡利回答说，自己还没有到要和乔布斯摊牌的地步。默里后来直接给乔布斯发了一份备忘录，批评他对待同事的方式，并谴责其“人身攻击的管理方式”。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>For a few weeks it  seemed as if there might be a solution to the turmoil. Jobs became fascinated  by a flat-screen technology developed by a firm near Palo Alto called Woodside  Design, run by an eccentric engineer named Steve Kitchen. He also was impressed  by another startup that made a touchscreen display that could be controlled by  your finger, so you didn’t need a mouse. Together these might help fulfill  Jobs’s vision of creating a “Mac in a book.” On a walk with Kitchen, Jobs  spotted a building in nearby Menlo Park and declared that they should open a  skunkworks facility to work on these ideas. It could be called AppleLabs and  Jobs could run it, going back to the joy of having a small team and developing  a great new product.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>有好几个星期的时甸，两人之间的问题似乎存在某种解决的可能。乔布斯开始着迷于一种平板显示屏技术，这是帕洛奥图附近的伍德赛德设计公司（WoodsideDesign）研发的，管理这家设计公司的是一位名叫史蒂夫·基钦（SteveKitchen）的古怪工程师。另一家创业公司做出的触摸屏也让乔布斯兴致很浓，利用这种技术，用户可以直接用手指控制设备，而无需鼠标。这两种技术可能有助于实现乔布斯创造“Mac书”（Macinabook）的愿景。同基钦的一次散步中，在门洛帕克附近的一幢建筑旁，乔布斯说道，他们可以开设一处科研基地，以实现这些想法。它可以叫苹果实验室（AppleLabs），由乔布斯来管理，这样，他又能重回带领小团队开发伟大新产品的喜悦之中。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Sculley was thrilled  by the possibility. It would solve most of his management issues, moving Jobs  back to what he did best and getting rid of his disruptive presence in  Cupertino. Sculley also had a candidate to replace Jobs as manager of the  Macintosh division: Jean-Louis Gassée, Apple’s chief in France, who had  suffered through Jobs’s visit there. Gassée flew to Cupertino and said he would  take the job if he got a guarantee that he would run the division rather than  work under Jobs. One of the board members, Phil Schlein of Macy’s, tried to  convince Jobs that he would be better off thinking up new products and  inspiring a passionate little team.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>斯卡利对这种可能性感到高兴。这将使乔布斯回到自己最擅长的领域，并且能让他远离库比蒂诺，不再给公司造成破坏，从而可以解决两人之间的大部分管理问题。他还物色了一个候选人，替代乔布斯担任麦金塔部门的管理者：让-路易·加西，他是苹果公司在法国的主管，曾在乔布斯造访法国时与之对抗。加西乘飞机前往库比蒂诺，并表示，只要能保证自己管理整个项目而不是在乔布斯手下工作，他就会接受这份工作。董事会成员之一，梅西百货的菲尔·施莱因竭力说服乔布斯，他如果能发明新产品并激励一个充满激情的小团队会更好。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>But after some  reflection, Jobs decided that was not the path he wanted. He declined to cede  control to Gassée, who wisely went back to Paris to avoid the power clash that  was becoming inevitable. For the rest of the spring, Jobs vacillated. There  were times when he wanted to assert himself as a corporate manager, even  writing a memo urging cost savings by eliminating free beverages and  first-class air travel, and other times when he agreed with those who were  encouraging him to go off and run a new AppleLabs R&amp;D group.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>但经过一番思考，乔布斯认为这并非他想走的路。他拒绝将控制杈弃让给加西，后者明智地回到了巴黎，以躲开无可避免的权力冲突。在这个春季之后的日子里，乔布斯摇摆不定。他有时想要维护自己作为企业管理者的身份，甚至写下备忘录，要求取消免费饮料和头等舱航空旅行的福利，以节省开支；有时候，他又想离开，去管理新的苹果实验室研发团队。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>In March Murray let  loose with another memo that he marked “Do not circulate” but gave to multiple  colleagues. “In my three years at Apple, I’ve never observed so much confusion,  fear, and dysfunction as in the past 90 days,” he began. “We are perceived by  the rank and file as a boat without a rudder, drifting away into foggy  oblivion.” Murray had been on both sides of the fence; at times he conspired  with Jobs to undermine Sculley, but in this memo he laid the blame on Jobs.  “Whether the <em>cause of</em> or <em>because of</em> the dysfunction, Steve Jobs  now controls a seemingly impenetrable power base.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>当年3月，默里发出了另一份备忘录，并标明“请勿流传”，发送给了多位同事。“过去90天里，苹果公司出现如此多的混乱、恐惧和运转失常，是我在苹果这3年里从未见过的。”他在开头这样写道，“普通员工觉得我们就是一艘没有舵的船，在迷雾中漂流。”默里曾两头倒，有几次他还与乔布斯密谋诋毁斯卡利。但是在这份备忘录中，他把错误归咎于乔布斯。“无论公司的运转失常是原因还是结果，史蒂夫·乔布斯现在都在掌控着一个看似坚不可摧的权力基础。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>At the end of that  month, Sculley finally worked up the nerve to tell Jobs that he should give up  running the Macintosh division. He walked over to Jobs’s office one evening and  brought the human resources manager, Jay Elliot, to make the confrontation more  formal. “There is no one who admires your brilliance and vision more than I  do,” Sculley began. He had uttered such flatteries before, but this time it was  clear that there would be a brutal “but” punctuating the thought. And there  was. “But this is really not going to work,” he declared. The flatteries  punctured by “buts” continued. “We have developed a great friendship with each  other,” he said, “but I have lost confidence in your ability to run the  Macintosh division.” He also berated Jobs for badmouthing him as a bozo behind  his back.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>3月底，斯卡利终于鼓起勇气告诉乔布斯，他应该放弃麦金塔部门的管理权。一天傍晚，他走进乔布斯的办公室，为了让两人的会面更加正式，他还带上了人力资源部经理杰伊·埃利奥特。“没有人比我更钦佩你的才华和远见。”斯卡利开场道。他以前也说过这样的奉承话，但这次，显然后面会出现一个“但是”来打断这些赞美。事实确实如此。“但是，这真的行不通。”他说道。被“但是”打断的恭维话又继续下去。“我们彼此之间已经发展出深厚的友谊，”他继续说道，有些自作多情，“但是我对你管理麦金塔部门的能力失去了信心。”斯卡利还斥责乔布斯在背后说自己的坏话，把他当笨蛋。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs looked stunned  and countered with an odd challenge, that Sculley should help and coach him  more: “You’ve got to spend more time with me.” Then he lashed back. He told  Sculley he knew nothing about computers, was doing a terrible job running the  company, and had disappointed Jobs ever since coming to Apple. Then he began to  cry. Sculley sat there biting his fingernails.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯看上去惊呆了，说出了一句奇怪的反驳，意思是在这方面斯卡利应该多给他点儿帮助和指导。“你得花更多时间与我相处。”他说。接着他开始回击。他说斯卡利对电脑一无所知，管理公司一塌糊涂，并且自从斯卡利进苹果公司以来，就不断地令自己失望。然后，乔布斯又出现了第三个反应，他哭了起来。斯卡利则坐在那儿咬指甲。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>“I’m going to bring  this up with the board,” Sculley declared. “I’m going to recommend that you  step down from your operating position of running the Macintosh division. I  want you to know that.” He urged Jobs not to resist and to agree instead to  work on developing new technologies and products.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“我会把现在的情况反映给董事会，”斯卡利说道，“我会建议他们让你离开麦金塔部门的管理岗位。我希望你知道这些。”他力劝乔布斯不要抵抗，并同意去开发新技术与产品。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs jumped from his  seat and turned his intense stare on Sculley. “I don’t believe you’re going to  do that,” he said. “If you do that, you’re going to destroy the company.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯从座位上跳了起来，转过身来，目不转睛地盯着斯卡利。“我不相信你会这么做，”他说，“如果你做了，会毁掉公司的。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Over the next few  weeks Jobs’s behavior fluctuated wildly. At one moment he would be talking  about going off to run AppleLabs, but in the next moment he would be enlisting  support to have Sculley ousted. He would reach out to Sculley, then lash out at  him behind his back, sometimes on the same night. One night at 9 he called  Apple’s general counsel Al Eisenstat to say he was losing confidence in Sculley  and needed his help convincing the board to fire him; at 11 the same night, he  phoned Sculley to say, “You’re terrific, and I just want you to know I love  working with you.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>在接下来的几个星期，乔布斯的行为出现了很大波动。他一会儿说自己要离开公司总部去管理苹果实验室，一会儿又开始争取支持去推翻斯卡利。刚同斯卡利示好，转眼又在背后大肆抨击斯卡利，有时候这种反复会发生在同一天晚上。一天晚上9点，他打电话给苹果公司法律总顾问阿尔·艾森斯塔特，说自己对斯卡利失去了信心，并需要艾森斯塔特的帮助来说服董事会；而两个小时后，他又一个电话吵醒斯卡利，对他说：“你很了不起，我只想要你知道，我喜欢跟你合作。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>At the board meeting  on April 11, Sculley officially reported that he wanted to ask Jobs to step  down as the head of the Macintosh division and focus instead on new product  development. Arthur Rock, the most crusty and independent of the board members,  then spoke. He was fed up with both of them: with Sculley for not having the  guts to take command over the past year, and with Jobs for “acting like a  petulant brat.” The board needed to get this dispute behind them, and to do so  it should meet privately with each of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>4月11日的董事会会议上，斯卡利正式提出，自己想要乔布斯离开麦金塔部门负责人的职位并专注于新产品开发。接着，最顽固最独立的董事会成员亚瑟·罗克说话了。他受够他们两个人了：在过去一年里，斯卡利没胆量负责指挥管理，而乔布斯则“像个任性的小孩儿”。董事会需要替他们解决这一争端，为此，董事会会跟他们分别进行谈话。

<p>Sculley left the room  so that Jobs could present first. Jobs insisted that Sculley was the problem  because he had no understanding of computers. Rock responded by berating Jobs.  In his growling voice, he said that Jobs had been behaving foolishly for a year  and had no right to be managing a division. Even Jobs’s strongest supporter,  Phil Schlein, tried to talk him into stepping aside gracefully to run a  research lab for the company.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>斯卡利离开了会议室，这样乔布斯可以先陈述。乔布斯坚持认为斯卡利才是问题所在，说斯卡利不懂电脑。罗克的回复则是对乔布斯的训斥。他怒吼道，乔布斯这一年的所作所为很愚蠢，而且他无权管理一个部门。即便是乔布斯最坚定的支持者，梅西百货的菲尔·施莱因，也试图劝乔布斯优雅退位，去为公司管理研究实验室。

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>When it was Sculley’s  turn to meet privately with the board, he gave an ultimatum: “You can back me,  and then I take responsibility for running the company, or we can do nothing,  and you’re going to have to find yourselves a new CEO.” If given the authority,  he said, he would not move abruptly, but would ease Jobs into the new role over  the next few months. The board unanimously sided with Sculley. He was given the  authority to remove Jobs whenever he felt the timing was right. As Jobs waited  outside the boardroom, knowing full well that he was losing, he saw Del Yocam,  a longtime colleague, and hugged him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>轮到斯卡利单独与董事会见面时，他发出了最后通牒。“你们要么支持我，那我就负起掌管公司的责任；要么你们什么都不做，再去给苹果找一个新的CEO来。”斯卡利说，如果获杈，他不会贸然行动，但会在接下来的几个月安抚乔布斯进入新的角色。董事会一致支持斯卡利。他有权在自己认为正确的时机将乔布斯革职。此时，乔布斯正在会议室外等着，他完全明白自己要输了；看到老同事德尔·约克姆，乔布斯哭了起来。

<p>After the board made  its decision, Sculley tried to be conciliatory. Jobs asked that the transition  occur slowly, over the next few months, and Sculley agreed. Later that evening  Sculley’s executive assistant, Nanette Buckhout, called Jobs to see how he was  doing. He was still in his office, shell-shocked. Sculley had already left, and  Jobs came over to talk to her. Once again he began oscillating wildly in his  attitude toward Sculley. “Why did John do this to me?” he said. “He betrayed  me.” Then he swung the other way. Perhaps he should take some time away to work  on restoring his relationship with Sculley, he said. “John’s friendship is more  important than anything else, and I think maybe that’s what I should do,  concentrate on our friendship.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>董事会作出决定后，斯卡利试图与乔布斯和解。乔布斯要求在接下来的几个月里慢慢过渡，斯卡利同意了。当天晚上，斯卡利的行政助理南妮特·巴克霍特（NanetteBuckhout）打电话给乔布斯，想知道他现在怎么样。乔布斯还待在自己的办公室里，精神沮丧。斯卡利已离开了，乔布斯就过来同巴克霍特交谈。他对于斯卡利的态度又开始疯狂地摇摆。“约翰为什么要这样对我呢？”他说道，“他背叛了我。”然后，他又换了另一种态度，认为自己或许应该花些时间来修复同斯卡利的关系。“约翰的友谊比任何事物都重要，我觉得自己也许应该这样做，专注于我们的友谊。”

<div class="left"><h3><a name="s6"></a>Plotting a Coup</h3>
<p>Jobs was not good at  taking no for an answer. He went to Sculley’s office in early May 1985 and  asked for more time to show that he could manage the Macintosh division. He  would prove himself as an operations guy, he promised. Sculley didn’t back  down. Jobs next tried a direct challenge: He asked Sculley to resign. “I think  you really lost your stride,” Jobs told him. “You were really great the first  year, and everything went wonderful. But something happened.” Sculley, who  generally was even-tempered, lashed back, pointing out that Jobs had been  unable to get Macintosh software developed, come up with new models, or win  customers. The meeting degenerated into a shouting match about who was the  worse manager. After Jobs stalked out, Sculley turned away from the glass wall  of his office, where others had been looking in on the meeting, and wept.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<h3>策划政变</h3>
<p>乔布斯并不习惯别人对自己说“不”。1985年5月初，他来到斯卡利的办公室，要求给他更多时间来证明自己能够管理麦金塔部门。乔布斯表示，他将证明自己是个运营人才。斯卡利没有让步。乔布斯接着又直接挑战对方：叫斯卡利辞职。“我觉得你真的已经乱了阵脚，”乔布斯对他说，“你来苹果的第一年确实挺好，一切都很美妙。但是后来出问题了。”一向平和的斯卡利回击了，他指出乔布斯没能完成麦金塔的软件，没能开发出新机型，也没能赢得新顾客。两人的会面成了一场关于谁是更烂的管理者的吵闹。乔布斯走后，斯卡利转了个身，背对着办公室的玻璃墙，落下了眼泪。玻璃墙外都是围观他们争吵的人。

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Matters began to come  to a head on Tuesday, May 14, when the Macintosh team made its quarterly review  presentation to Sculley and other Apple corporate leaders. Jobs still had not  relinquished control of the division, and he was defiant when he arrived in the  corporate boardroom with his team. He and Sculley began by clashing over what  the division’s mission was. Jobs said it was to sell more Macintosh machines.  Sculley said it was to serve the interests of the Apple company as a whole. As  usual there was little cooperation among the divisions; for one thing, the  Macintosh team was planning new disk drives that were different from those  being developed by the Apple II division. The debate, according to the minutes,  took a full hour.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>5月14日，周二，麦金塔团队向斯卡利和其他苹果公司领导者进行季度回顾报告。事情至此达到高xdx潮。乔布斯仍然没有放弃该部门的控制权，他目中无人地带领麦金塔团队来到董事会会议室。他和斯卡利开始就麦金塔部门的使命发生冲突。乔布斯认为这个团队的任务就是销售更多的麦金塔电脑，斯卡利说它应该服务于苹果公司的整体利益。和往常一样，苹果公司的部门之间几乎没有合作，麦金塔团队当时正计划开发新的磁盘驱动器，这种驱动器不同于AppleII团队正在做的那个。根据会议记录，两人的辩论持续了整整一个小时。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs then described  the projects under way: a more powerful Mac, which would take the place of the  discontinued Lisa; and software called FileServer, which would allow Macintosh  users to share files on a network. Sculley learned for the first time that  these projects were going to be late. He gave a cold critique of Murray’s  marketing record, Belleville’s missed engineering deadlines, and Jobs’s overall  management. Despite all this, Jobs ended the meeting with a plea to Sculley, in  front of all the others there, to be given one more chance to prove he could  run a division. Sculley refused.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>之后，乔布斯介绍了其团队正在进行的项目：更强大的Mac，这款新机器将取代已经停产的丽萨电脑；以及一款名为“文件服务器”（FileServer）的软件，麦金塔电脑用户可以通过该软件在网络上共享文件。但斯卡利首次得知这些项目都会推迟发布。他冷酷地批评了默里的营销业绩、鲍勃·贝尔维尔错过的工程期限，以及乔布斯的整体管理状况。虽然如此，乔布斯还是在报告会结束时，当着所有其他人的面，要求斯卡利再给自己一次机会，让他证明自己能够管理一个部门。斯卡利拒绝了。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>That night Jobs took  his Macintosh team out to dinner at Nina’s Café in Woodside. Jean-Louis Gassée  was in town because Sculley wanted him to prepare to take over the Macintosh  division, and Jobs invited him to join them. Belleville proposed a toast “to  those of us who really understand what the world according to Steve Jobs is all  about.” That phrase—“the world according to Steve”—had been used dismissively  by others at Apple who belittled the reality warp he created. After the others  left, Belleville sat with Jobs in his Mercedes and urged him to organize a  battle to the death with Sculley.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>当晚，乔布斯带领麦金塔团队在伍德赛德的妮娜咖啡馆（Nina-sCafe）吃晚饭。让-路易·加西当时也在苹果公司总部，因为斯卡利要他来准备接管麦金塔部门。乔布斯邀请加西一起吃晚饭。鲍勃·贝尔维尔举杯祝酒，“敬我们这些真正明白史蒂夫·乔布斯所构想的世界的人。”这句话是回应那些以“乔布斯所构想的世界”来诋毁乔布斯的人。其他人离开后，贝尔维尔陪乔布斯坐在他的奔驰车里，鼓励他发起战斗同斯卡利抗争到底。
</p>
</div></div>
<div class="layout">

</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯精于操控别人，只要他愿意，他就能哄骟和迷惑其他人而不觉羞愧。但是，他并不善于算计和搞明谋，尽管有些人不这么看；他不愿意也没耐心与别人交心。“史蒂夫从不玩办公室政治——天生就不会，后天也没去想。”杰伊·埃利奧特指出。此外，他天性傲慢，不屑于溜须拍马。例如，他在试图争取德尔·约克姆的支持时，不由自主地说，自己在运营管理方面比约克姆在行得多。

<p>Months earlier, Apple  had gotten the right to export computers to China, and Jobs had been invited to  sign a deal in the Great Hall of the People over the 1985 Memorial Day weekend.  He had told Sculley, who decided he wanted to go himself, which was just fine  with Jobs. Jobs decided to use Sculley’s absence to execute his coup. Throughout  the week leading up to Memorial Day, he took a lot of people on walks to share  his plans. “I’m going to launch a coup while John is in China,” he told Mike  Murray.</p>

　　几个月前，苹果公司已经获得了向中国出口电脑的许可。乔布斯收到邀请，需要动身去中国，到人民大会堂签署协议的日期是美国阵亡将士纪念日①的那个周末之后。斯卡利决定自己去签协议，乔布斯表示没问题。乔布斯计划利用斯卡利不在公司的时间，发动政变。在临近阵亡将士纪念日的一周时间内，他同许多人分享了自己的计划。“约翰在中国的时候，我要发动政变。”他告诉迈克·默里——

<div class="left"><h3><a name="s7"></a>Seven Days in May</h3>
<p><em>Thursday, May 23:</em> At his regular  Thursday meeting with his top lieutenants in the Macintosh division, Jobs told  his inner circle about his plan to oust Sculley. He also confided in the  corporate human resources director, Jay Elliot, who told him bluntly that the  proposed rebellion wouldn’t work. Elliot had talked to some board members and  urged them to stand up for Jobs, but he discovered that most of the board was  with Sculley, as were most members of Apple’s senior staff. Yet Jobs barreled  ahead. He even revealed his plans to Gassée on a walk around the parking lot,  despite the fact that Gassée had come from Paris to take his job. “I made the mistake  of telling Gassée,” Jobs wryly conceded years later.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<h3>关键七天：1985年5月</h3>
<p>5月23日，周四：在麦金塔部门的髙层例会上，乔布斯向核心成员讲述了自己推翻斯卡利的计划，还画了一张图表以说明自己将如何重组公司。他还向公司人力资源总监杰伊·埃利奥特透露了这个计划，埃利奥特直言这个阴谋不会成功。埃利奥特曾和一些董事会成员谈过，力劝他们支持乔布斯，但他发现大多数董事都站在斯卡利一边，苹果公司的大多数髙级职员也是一样。尽管如此，乔布斯执意要将这个计划进行到底。他甚至还在去停车场的路上将自己的计划透露给了加西，而加西来这里正是为了接替他的工作。“我把这事告诉了加西，这是个错误。”乔布斯多年后自我挖苦道。

　　</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>That evening Apple’s  general counsel Al Eisenstat had a small barbecue at his home for Sculley,  Gassée, and their wives. When Gassée told Eisenstat what Jobs was plotting, he  recommended that Gassée inform Sculley. “Steve was trying to raise a cabal and  have a coup to get rid of John,” Gassée recalled. “In the den of Al Eisenstat’s  house, I put my index finger lightly on John’s breastbone and said, ‘If you  leave tomorrow for China, you could be ousted. Steve’s plotting to get rid of  you.’”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>当晚，苹果的法律总顾问阿尔·艾森斯塔特在自己家为斯卡利夫妇和加西夫妇举办了一个小型的烧烤聚会。当加西告诉艾森斯塔特乔布斯的密谋时，艾森斯塔特建议他通知斯卡利。“史蒂夫正在策划阴谋，想要发动政变除掉约翰，”加西回忆说，“在阿尔·艾森斯塔特家，我用食指轻轻指着约翰的胸口，说，‘如果你明天出发去中国，就会被取代。史蒂夫正密谋除掉你。’”

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p><em>Friday, May 24:</em> Sculley canceled his  trip and decided to confront Jobs at the executive staff meeting on Friday  morning. Jobs arrived late, and he saw that his usual seat next to Sculley, who  sat at the head of the table, was taken. He sat instead at the far end. He was  dressed in a well-tailored suit and looked energized. Sculley looked pale. He  announced that he was dispensing with the agenda to confront the issue on  everyone’s mind. “It’s come to my attention that you’d like to throw me out of  the company,” he said, looking directly at Jobs. “I’d like to ask you if that’s  true.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>5月24日，周五：斯卡利取消了自己的中国之行，决定在周五上午的苹果公司高级职员大会上与乔布斯对质。乔布斯迟到了，他发现自己平时的座位被人占了，他平时坐在会议桌的一头，旁边是斯卡利。于是，他挑了个最远的位置坐下。他穿着量身定做的威尔克斯·巴什福德西装，看起来精神饱满。斯卡利面色苍白，向大家宣布，自己取消了今天的安排，来此解决所有人心中的问题。“我注意到你想把我赶出公司。”他说道，眼睛直视乔布斯，“我想问问你，这是真的吗？”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs was not expecting  this. But he was never shy about indulging in brutal honesty. His eyes  narrowed, and he fixed Sculley with his unblinking stare. “I think you’re bad  for Apple, and I think you’re the wrong person to run the company,” he replied,  coldly and slowly. “You really should leave this company. You don’t know how to  operate and never have.” He accused Sculley of not understanding the product  development process, and then he added a self-centered swipe: “I wanted you  here to help me grow, and you’ve been ineffective in helping me.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯没料到会这样。但是他从不羞于表达自己残忍的诚实。他眯着眼，眨都不眨地盯着斯卡利。“我觉得你对苹果公司有害，而且我认为，你是管理公司的错误人选。”他语调冰冷、不慌不忙地回答道，“你真的应该离开苹果。你不知道如何经营，也从来没有经营过公司。”他指责斯卡利不理解产品开发流程，接着他又抛出了一句尖刻的、以自我为中心的话，“我要你来是为了助我一臂之力，可是你从来没有帮到过我。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>As the rest of the  room sat frozen, Sculley finally lost his temper. A childhood stutter that had  not afflicted him for twenty years started to return. “I don’t trust you, and I  won’t tolerate a lack of trust,” he stammered. When Jobs claimed that he would  be better than Sculley at running the company, Sculley took a gamble. He  decided to poll the room on that question. “He pulled off this clever  maneuver,” Jobs recalled, still smarting thirty-five years later. “It was at  the executive committee meeting, and he said, ‘It’s me or Steve, who do you  vote for?’ He set the whole thing up so that you’d kind of have to be an idiot  to vote for me.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>会议室里其他人都一动不动地坐着，斯卡利终于发火了。他小时候有过口吃，但已经20年没犯了，现在他又结巴起来。“我不信任你，我也不能容忍缺乏信任。”他结结巴巴地说道。当乔布斯声称，在经营企业方面，他比斯卡利更好时，斯卡利决定赌一把，他让房间里的所有人对这个问题进行投票。“他通过这个聪明的举动赢了。”乔布斯回忆道，这件事在35年后仍然让他觉得痛楚，“当时是执行委员会的会议，斯卡利说，‘我，还是史蒂夫，你们选吧。’他设计了这整件事，从而让人觉得，选我的人肯定是白痴。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Suddenly the frozen  onlookers began to squirm. Del Yocam had to go first. He said he loved Jobs,  wanted him to continue to play some role in the company, but he worked up the  nerve to conclude, with Jobs staring at him, that he “respected” Sculley and  would support him to run the company. Eisenstat faced Jobs directly and said  much the same thing: He liked Jobs but was supporting Sculley. Regis McKenna,  who sat in on senior staff meetings as an outside consultant, was more direct.  He looked at Jobs and told him he was not yet ready to run the company,  something he had told him before. Others sided with Sculley as well. For Bill  Campbell, it was particularly tough. He was fond of Jobs and didn’t  particularly like Sculley. His voice quavered a bit as he told Jobs he had  decided to support Sculley, and he urged the two of them to work it out and  find some role for Jobs to play in the company. “You can’t let Steve leave this  company,” he told Sculley.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>突然，纹丝不动的旁观者们骚动起来。德尔·约克姆不得不第一个发言，他说自己欣赏乔布斯，希望他能继续在公司发挥一定的作用。虽然乔布斯盯着他，但是约克姆鼓起勇气总结说，他“尊重”斯卡利并会支持他管理公司。艾森斯塔特直面乔布斯，说了差不多的话：他欣赏乔布斯，但是支持斯卡利。里吉斯·麦肯纳是一位外部顾问，坐在一群高级职员之间，他的回答更直接。他看着乔布斯，说他还没有准备好管理公司，这句话他之前也对乔布斯说过。其他人也支持斯卡利。对于比尔·坎贝尔来说，这个抉择尤为艰难。他很欣赏乔布斯，但并不是特别欣赏斯卡利。当告诉乔布斯自己有多欣赏他时，坎贝尔的声音抖了一下。虽然决定支持斯卡利，但是他敦促乔布斯和斯卡利解决彼此之间的问题，并让乔布斯在公司里担任别的职位。“你不能让史蒂夫离开苹果。”他告诉斯卡利。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs looked shattered.  “I guess I know where things stand,” he said, and bolted out of the room. No  one followed.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯看上去都快崩溃了。“我想我知道大家的立场了。”他说完冲出了房间。没有人追上去。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>He went back to his  office, gathered his longtime loyalists on the Macintosh staff, and started to  cry. He would have to leave Apple, he said. As he started to walk out the door,  Debi Coleman restrained him. She and the others urged him to settle down and  not do anything hasty. He should take the weekend to regroup. Perhaps there was  a way to prevent the company from being torn apart.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>他回到自己的办公室，召集了麦金塔团队共事已久的心腹成员，忍不住开始哭泣。他说自己有必要离开苹果。当他快走出办公室的门时，黛比·科尔曼拦住了他。她和其他人劝他静下心来，不要轻举妄动，他应该在周末重组团队，也许能想到办法阻止苹果公司分裂。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Sculley was devastated  by his victory. Like a wounded warrior, he retreated to Eisenstat’s office and  asked the corporate counsel to go for a ride. When they got into Eisenstat’s  Porsche, Sculley lamented, “I don’t know whether I can go through with this.”  When Eisenstat asked what he meant, Sculley responded, “I think I’m going to  resign.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>斯卡利被自己的胜利击毁了。他像一个受伤的战士，走进公司顾问阿尔·艾森斯塔特的办公室，并要他一起去兜兜风。当他们坐上艾森斯塔特的保时捷时，斯卡利悲叹道：“我不知道自己是否能继续做下去。”艾森斯塔特询问他是什么意思，斯卡利回答说：“我想我会辞职。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>“You can’t,” Eisenstat  protested. “Apple will fall apart.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to resign,”  Sculley declared. “I don’t think I’m right for the company.”</p>

<p>“I think you’re  copping out,” Eisenstat replied. “You’ve got to stand up to him.” Then he drove  Sculley home.</p>

<p>Sculley’s wife was  surprised to see him back in the middle of the day. “I’ve failed,” he said to  her forlornly. She was a volatile woman who had never liked Jobs or appreciated  her husband’s infatuation with him. So when she heard what had happened, she  jumped into her car and sped over to Jobs’s office. Informed that he had gone  to the Good Earth restaurant, she marched over there and confronted him in the  parking lot as he was coming out with loyalists on his Macintosh team.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“你不能，”艾森斯塔特抗议道，“苹果会垮的。”</p>
<p>“我打算辞职，”斯卡利重申道，“我觉得自己不是管理苹果的正确人选。你能打电话给董事会并告诉他们吗？”</p>
<p>“我会的。”艾森斯塔特回答说，“但是，我觉得你这是在逃避。你得勇敢地面对他。”然后，他开车把斯卡利送回了家。</p>
<p>斯卡利的妻子利兹很惊讶看到丈夫在中午就回来，“我失败了。”他神色落寞地对利兹说。利兹是个心理不稳定的女人，她从来都不喜欢乔布斯，也不赞赏丈夫对乔布斯的迷恋。因此，在听说发生了什么事后，她跳上自己的车，一路加速来到乔布斯的办公室。得知乔布斯已经前往美好地球餐厅，她又赶到那里。在停车场，乔布斯正同黛比·科尔曼及其他麦金塔核心成员走下车来。利兹径直走到他面前</p>。

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>“Steve, can I talk to  you?” she said. His jaw dropped. “Do you have any idea what a privilege it has  been even to know someone as fine as John Sculley?” she demanded. He averted  his gaze. “Can’t you look me in the eyes when I’m talking to you?” she asked.  But when Jobs did so—giving her his practiced, unblinking stare—she recoiled.  “Never mind, don’t look at me,” she said. “When I look into most people’s eyes,  I see a soul. When I look into your eyes, I see a bottomless pit, an empty hole,  a dead zone.” Then she walked away.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>史蒂夫，能和你谈谈吗？”她说。乔布斯惊呆了。“你知不知道，能认识像约翰·斯卡利这样好的人是多么难得？”她质问道。乔布斯避开了她的目光。“我跟你说话的时候你难道就不能看着我的眼睛吗？”她问。乔布斯照做了，老练地眼睛眨都不眨地盯着她，利兹反而退却了。“算了，别看着我了。”她说道,“当我看大多数人的眼睛时，我能看到他们的灵魂。可我看你的眼睛时，只看到一个无底洞，一个空洞，一个死区。”说完，她就走了。

<p><em>Saturday, May 25:</em> Mike Murray drove to  Jobs’s house in Woodside to offer some advice: He should consider accepting the  role of being a new product visionary, starting AppleLabs, and getting away  from headquarters. Jobs seemed willing to consider it. But first he would have  to restore peace with Sculley. So he picked up the telephone and surprised  Sculley with an olive branch. Could they meet the following afternoon, Jobs  asked, and take a walk together in the hills above Stanford University. They  had walked there in the past, in happier times, and maybe on such a walk they  could work things out.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>5月25日,周六：迈克·默里当天来到乔布斯位于伍德赛德的住所，向他提供一些建议。默里劝他应该考虑接受产品架构师的职位，启动苹果实验室项目，离开总部。乔布斯似乎愿意考虑这个建议。但首先，他得和斯卡利和解。于是，乔布斯拿起电话，向斯卡利伸出了橄榄枝，这令斯卡利感到惊讶。乔布斯询问，明天下午能否见个面，一起在斯坦福大学的山上散步。以前，两人关系和睦的时候，他们经常这样散步。也许走一走他们就能把事情解决。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs did not know that  Sculley had told Eisenstat he wanted to quit, but by then it didn’t matter.  Overnight, he had changed his mind and decided to stay. Despite the blowup the  day before, he was still eager for Jobs to like him. So he agreed to meet the  next afternoon.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯不知道斯卡利已经同艾森斯塔特说过要辞职，但是当时，这已经不重要了。一夜之间，斯卡利已经改变了注意。他决定留下来，尽管前一天两人大吵一架，但他仍然渴望乔布斯能喜欢自己。于是他同意第二天下午见面。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>If Jobs was prepping  for conciliation, it didn’t show in the choice of movie he wanted to see with  Murray that night. He picked <em>Patton</em>, the epic of the never-surrender  general. But he had lent his copy of the tape to his father, who had once  ferried troops for the general, so he drove to his childhood home with Murray  to retrieve it. His parents weren’t there, and he didn’t have a key. They  walked around the back, checked for unlocked doors or windows, and finally gave  up. The video store didn’t have a copy of <em>Patton</em> in stock, so in the end  he had to settle for watching the 1983 film adaptation of Harold Pinter’s <em>Betrayal</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>如果说乔布斯当时真的在准备调和彼此之间的矛盾，那么这个想法并没有在他当晚想看的电影中体现出来。他同默里准备看电影，结果乔布斯选了《巴顿将军》（Patton）——一部永不投降的将军的史诗。但是，他把《巴顿将军》的录像带借给父亲了，乔布斯的父亲曾为巴顿将军的部队运送过士兵。于是，两人开车到乔布斯的父母家去取录像带。但是家里没人，乔布斯也没有钥匙。他们环视这幢房子，看有没有门窗没上锁，最后还是放弃了。音像店里也没有《巴顿将军》，最后他们不得不勉强看了《危险女人心》（Betrayal）。

<p><em>Sunday, May 26:</em> As planned, Jobs and  Sculley met in back of the Stanford campus on Sunday afternoon and walked for  several hours amid the rolling hills and horse pastures. Jobs reiterated his  plea that he should have an operational role at Apple. This time Sculley stood  firm. It won’t work, he kept saying. Sculley urged him to take the role of  being a product visionary with a lab of his own, but Jobs rejected this as  making him into a mere “figurehead.” Defying all connection to reality, he  countered with the proposal that Sculley give up control of the entire company  to him. “Why don’t you become chairman and I’ll become president and chief  executive officer?” he suggested. Sculley was struck by how earnest he seemed.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>5月26日，周日：按照计划，当天下午，乔布斯和斯卡利在斯坦福大学校园后面碰头，两人在起伏的丘陵和马场上走了几个小时。乔布斯重申了自己的请求，认为自己应该在苹果公司担任一个运营职位。这一次，斯卡利的立场很坚定，不停地说不行。斯卡利力劝乔布斯接受产品架构师的职位，带领自己的小团队。但是乔布斯拒绝了这个提议，因为这会让自己变成一个“有名无实的领导者”。乔布斯摒弃了现实，建议斯卡利让权给自己。如果这话不是出自乔布斯之口，肯定会令人惊讶。“你来当董事长，我来当总裁兼CEO，为什么不这样呢？”他说道。乔布斯说这话的时候一副非常认真的模样，斯卡利惊呆了。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>“Steve, that doesn’t  make any sense,” Sculley replied. Jobs then proposed that they split the duties  of running the company, with him handling the product side and Sculley handling  marketing and business. But the board had not only emboldened Sculley, it had  ordered him to bring Jobs to heel. “One person has got to run the company,” he  replied. “I’ve got the support and you don’t.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“史蒂夫，这个提议完全没有意义。”斯卡利回复道。接着，乔布斯又提议他们一起分担管理公司的责任，他来处理产品方面的问题，斯卡利则负责营销和商业上的问题。董事会不仅让斯卡利有了底气，他们还命令斯卡利让乔布斯服从。“公司只能由一个人掌管，”他回答说，“董事会支持的是我，而不是你。”最后，他们握了捏手，乔布斯又一次同意考虑接受产品架构师的职位。

<p>On his way home, Jobs  stopped at Mike Markkula’s house. He wasn’t there, so Jobs left a message  asking him to come to dinner the following evening. He would also invite the  core of loyalists from his Macintosh team. He hoped that they could persuade  Markkula of the folly of siding with Sculley.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>开车回家的路上，乔布斯拐到了迈克·马库拉家。马库拉不在家，于是乔布斯就留了个口信，让他第二天晚上到自己家来吃晚饭。乔布斯还邀请了他在麦金塔团队的心腹。他希望他们能够说服马库拉，让他明白支持斯卡利是愚蠢的。

<p><em>Monday, May 27:</em> Memorial Day was  sunny and warm. The Macintosh team loyalists—Debi Coleman, Mike Murray, Susan  Barnes, and Bob Belleville—got to Jobs’s Woodside home an hour before the  scheduled dinner so they could plot strategy. Sitting on the patio as the sun  set, Coleman told Jobs that he should accept Sculley’s offer to be a product  visionary and help start up AppleLabs. Of all the inner circle, Coleman was the  most willing to be realistic. In the new organization plan, Sculley had tapped  her to run the manufacturing division because he knew that her loyalty was to  Apple and not just to Jobs. Some of the others were more hawkish. They wanted  to urge Markkula to support a reorganization plan that put Jobs in charge.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>5月27日，周一：这一天是美国阵亡将士纪念日，天气晴朗温暧。麦金塔团队的黛比·科尔曼、迈克·默里、苏珊·巴恩斯（SusanBames）和鲍勃·贝尔维尔，提前一小时来到乔布斯位于伍德赛德的家中，这样他们就能够一起商量一不对策。夕阳西下时，他们坐在院子里，科尔曼表示，乔布斯应该接受斯卡利的提议，担任产品架构师，帮助创办苹果实验室。默里也曾这样劝过乔布斯。在所有心腹人员中，科尔曼是最愿意讲求实际的。在新的组织计划中，斯卡利安排她管理制造部门，因为他知道科尔曼忠于的是苹果，而不仅仅是乔布斯。其他一些人则更为强硬。他们想要劝服马库拉支持他们的重组计划，让乔布斯管理公司，或者至少让他保留对产品部门的控制杈。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>When Markkula showed  up, he agreed to listen with one proviso: Jobs had to keep quiet. “I seriously  wanted to hear the thoughts of the Macintosh team, not watch Jobs enlist them  in a rebellion,” he recalled. As it turned cooler, they went inside the  sparsely furnished mansion and sat by a fireplace. Instead of letting it turn  into a gripe session, Markkula made them focus on very specific management  issues, such as what had caused the problem in producing the FileServer  software and why the Macintosh distribution system had not responded well to  the change in demand. When they were finished, Markkula bluntly declined to  back Jobs. “I said I wouldn’t support his plan, and that was the end of that,”  Markkula recalled. “Sculley was the boss. They were mad and emotional and  putting together a revolt, but that’s not how you do things.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>马库拉到了之后，表示同意听取他们的意见，不过有一个条件：乔布斯必须保持安静。“我非常想听听麦金塔团队的想法，但不想看到乔布斯怂恿他们叛乱。”马库拉回忆说。入夜后气温下降，他们走进装修简陋的屋里，围坐在壁炉边。乔布斯的厨师做了全麦素食比萨，摆在牌桌上。马库拉则慢慢吃着本地种植的奥尔森樱桃，这是乔布斯贮存的，放在一个小木箱里。为了不让谈话变成牢骚会，马库拉让大家集中于非常具体的管理问题，例如，制作“文件服务器”软件时，是什么造成了问题，以及为什么麦金塔电脑的分销系统没有对需求改变作出反应。大家说完后，马库拉直截了当地拒绝支持乔布斯。“我说过，我不会支持他的计划，一切到此为止。”马库拉回忆表示，“斯卡利是老板。他们气疯了，情绪激动，聚在一起密谋反抗，但这不是做事情的方式。”
</p>
</div></div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

</div>
<div class="right">
<p>与此同时，斯卡利这一天里也在征求意见。他是否应该屈从于乔布斯的要求？几乎所有他咨询过的人都声称，有这种想法筒直是疯了。即便只是问出这种问题，也让人觉得斯卡利在踌躇，他仍然在绝望中渴望乔布斯的垂青。“我们支持你，”一位高级管理人员告诉他，“我们希望你能展现出强大的领导力，你不能让史蒂夫重回运营岗位。”
</p>
</div></div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p><em>Tuesday, May 28:</em> His ire stoked by  hearing from Markkula that Jobs had spent the previous evening trying to  subvert him, Sculley walked over to Jobs’s office on Tuesday morning. He had  talked to the board, he said, and he had its support. He wanted Jobs out. Then  he drove to Markkula’s house, where he gave a presentation of his reorganization  plans. Markkula asked detailed questions, and at the end he gave Sculley his  blessing. When he got back to his office, Sculley called the other members of  the board, just to make sure he still had their backing. He did.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>5月28日，周二：在大家的支持下，斯卡利挺直了腰杆儿。马库拉告诉斯卡利，乔布斯前一天晚上试图推翻他。这无异于火上浇油，斯卡利怒火中烧。这天上午，他走进乔布斯的办公室与他对质。斯卡利表示，自己已经同董事会谈过并得到了他们的支持。他希望乔布斯离开。然后，他开车前往马库拉家，向他阐述自己的重组计划。马库拉问了些细节问题，最后祝福他。返回办公室后，斯卡利又给其他董事会成员打了电话，只是想确认他们仍然支持自己。他成功了。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>At that point he  called Jobs to make sure he understood. The board had given final approval of  his reorganization plan, which would proceed that week. Gassée would take over  control of Jobs’s beloved Macintosh as well as other products, and there was no  other division for Jobs to run. Sculley was still somewhat conciliatory. He  told Jobs that he could stay on with the title of board chairman and be a  product visionary with no operational duties. But by this point, even the idea  of starting a skunkworks such as AppleLabs was no longer on the table.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>当时，他打给乔布斯，想让他明白现在的状况。董事会已经最后通过了斯卡利的重组计划，并将于当周开始实施。加西将接手乔布斯心爱的麦金塔团队以及其他产品，乔布斯将不掌管任何团队。斯卡利仍有和解之意。他告诉乔布斯，乔布斯可以继续留在苹果，担任董事长兼产品架构师，但不履行任何运营职责。但此时，即便是成立一个研发小组，例如苹果实验室，都已经不在讨论范围内了。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>It finally sank in.  Jobs realized there was no appeal, no way to warp the reality. He broke down in  tears and started making phone calls—to Bill Campbell, Jay Elliot, Mike Murray,  and others. Murray’s wife, Joyce, was on an overseas call when Jobs phoned, and  the operator broke in saying it was an emergency. It better be important, she  told the operator. “It is,” she heard Jobs say. When her husband got on the  phone, Jobs was crying. “It’s over,” he said. Then he hung up.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>一切终成定局。乔布斯意识到自己不可能翻案，也无法再扭曲现实。他泣不成声，开始给比尔·坎贝尔、杰伊·埃利奥特、迈克·默里和其他人挨个打电话。乔布斯打到默里家的时候，默里的妻子乔伊斯正在打越洋电话，接线员打断了她的电话，说有一个找默里的紧急电话。乔伊斯告诉接线员说，这电话但愿是重要的。“就是的。”她听到乔布斯的声音。默里接过了电话，听到乔布斯正在哭。“结束了。”他说，然后挂断了电话。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Murray was worried that  Jobs was so despondent he might do something rash, so he called back. There was  no answer, so he drove to Woodside. No one came to the door when he knocked, so  he went around back and climbed up some exterior steps and looked in the  bedroom. Jobs was lying there on a mattress in his unfurnished room. He let  Murray in and they talked until almost dawn.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>默里担心乔布斯太过伤心，可能做出什么鲁莽的事，于是他回拨过去。电话那头儿没人接。于是默里开车去了伍德赛德。他敲了敲乔布斯家的门，没人应答，于是他绕着屋子走了走，爬上屋外比较髙的台阶，往卧室里看。在一个没有家具的房间里，乔布斯躺在一张床垫上。他开门让默里进来，两个人聊天直到黎明。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p><em>Wednesday, May 29:</em> Jobs finally got hold  of a tape of <em>Patton</em>, which he watched Wednesday evening, but Murray  prevented him from getting stoked up for another battle. Instead he urged Jobs  to come in on Friday for Sculley’s announcement of the reorganization plan.  There was no option left other than to play the good soldier rather than the  renegade commander.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>5月29日，周三：乔布斯终于拿到了一盘《巴顿将军》的录像带，并在当天晚上重温了一遍。但是默里阻止了他再次发起另一场抗争。相反，他劝乔布斯周五来公司，听斯卡利宣布重组计划。做好士兵，而不是叛军司令，除此之外，别无选择。
</p>
</div></div>
 


 

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><h3><a name="s8"></a>Like a Rolling Stone</h3>
<p>Jobs slipped quietly  into the back row of the auditorium to listen to Sculley explain to the troops  the new order of battle. There were a lot of sideways glances, but few people  acknowledged him and none came over to provide public displays of affection. He  stared without blinking at Sculley, who would remember “Steve’s look of  contempt” years later. “It’s unyielding,” Sculley recalled, “like an X-ray  boring inside your bones, down to where you’re soft and destructibly mortal.”  For a moment, standing onstage while pretending not to notice Jobs, Sculley  thought back to a friendly trip they had taken a year earlier to Cambridge,  Massachusetts, to visit Jobs’s hero, Edwin Land. He had been dethroned from the  company he created, Polaroid, and Jobs had said to Sculley in disgust, “All he  did was blow a lousy few million and they took his company away from him.” Now,  Sculley reflected, he was taking Jobs’s company away from him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<h3>像一块滚石</h3>
<p>乔布斯悄悄地溜进了坐席的后排，看斯卡利向苹果员工们解释公司重组计划。有很多人瞥见了他，但鮮有人向他打招呼，更没人过来跟他热络。他目不转睛地盯着斯卡利，即使多年后，斯卡利也仍然记得“史蒂夫蔑视的眼光”。“他的目光很坚毅，”斯卡利回忆道，“就像穿筋透骨的X射线，直击你柔软脆弱的地方。”斯卡利站在讲台上，假装没有注意到乔布斯。有那么一瞵，他回想起两人的一次愉快旅行。那是一年前，他们前往马萨诸塞州剑桥市拜访乔布斯心目中的英雄埃德温·兰德，他被赶出了自己创办的宝丽来公司。当时，乔布斯带着厌恶之情跟斯卡利说：“他不过是损失了几百万，他们就把他赶出了公司。”现在，斯卡利反思到，自己正在夺走乔布斯的公司。

　　</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>As Sculley went over  the organizational chart, he introduced Gassée as the new head of a combined  Macintosh and Apple II product group. On the chart was a small box labeled  “chairman” with no lines connecting to it, not to Sculley or to anyone else.  Sculley briefly noted that in that role, Jobs would play the part of “global  visionary.” But he didn’t acknowledge Jobs’s presence. There was a smattering  of awkward applause.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

斯卡利继续自己的演讲，仍然无视乔布斯。他将组织结构图展示了一遍，介绍加西将负责整合后的麦金塔和AppleII团队，并出任新负责人。图表上有一个孤立的小方框写着“董事长”一职，却没有连接到任何其他部门和个人，甚至也没有与斯卡利的名字连上。斯卡利简要提到，乔布斯将在这个职位上发挥“全球架构师”的作用，说到这里时，他依旧无视乔布斯的存在。介绍完毕，会场响起了稀稀拉拉的掌声。
<p>赫茨菲尔德从朋友处得知了这个消息后，驱车回到了苹果总部，这是他离职后第一次回来。他想要对这位老故友表达自己的同情。“我还是难以想象，董事会居然赶走了史蒂夫。虽然他有时候会很难搞，但很明显，他是苹果公司的心脏和灵魂。”赫茨菲尔德回忆道，“AppleII部门一些反感史蒂夫的人似乎扬眉吐气了，还有一些人觉得这次动荡是个人升迁的机会，但是大多数苹果员工对于未来感到忧虑、沮丧和不确定。”赫茨菲尔德一度以为乔布斯可能会同意创办苹果实验室。他曾设想，如果这样的话，自己会回来为他工作。但是这个设想并未实现。</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs stayed home for the  next few days, blinds drawn, his answering machine on, seeing only his  girlfriend, Tina Redse. For hours on end he sat there playing his Bob Dylan  tapes, especially “The Times They Are a-Changin.’” He had recited the second  verse the day he unveiled the Macintosh to the Apple shareholders sixteen  months earlier. That verse ended nicely: “For the loser now / Will be later to  win. . . .”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>接下来的几天时间，乔布斯都待在家里，拉下百叶窗，电话直接转入答录机，只见自己的女友蒂娜·莱德斯。鲍勃·迪伦的磁带一放好几小时不停，尤其是《时代在变》。16个月前，他向苹果公司的股东掲开麦金塔的面纱时，朗诵了这首歌的第二段歌词。歌词的结尾很棒：“现在的失败者/会成为以后的赢家……”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>A rescue squad from  his former Macintosh posse arrived to dispel the gloom on Sunday night, led by  Andy Hertzfeld and Bill Atkinson. Jobs took a while to answer their knock, and  then he led them to a room next to the kitchen that was one of the few places  with any furniture. With Redse’s help, he served some vegetarian food he had  ordered. “So what really happened?” Hertzfeld asked. “Is it really as bad as it  looks?”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>周日晚上，安迪·赫茨菲尔德和比尔·阿特金森以及前麦金塔团队的一小组人来到乔布斯家，想为他驱散阴霾。乔布斯隔了好一会儿才给他们开门，把他们带进了厨房边上的一个房间，这是他家为数不多的有家具的角落。在莱德斯的帮助下，他给他们端上了自己叫来的素食外卖。“到底发生了什么？”赫茨菲尔德问道，“真的有这么糟吗？”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>“No, it’s worse.” Jobs  grimaced. “It’s much worse than you can imagine.” He blamed Sculley for  betraying him, and said that Apple would not be able to manage without him. His  role as chairman, he complained, was completely ceremonial. He was being  ejected from his Bandley 3 office to a small and almost empty building he  nicknamed “Siberia.” Hertzfeld turned the topic to happier days, and they began  to reminisce about the past.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“不，更糟，”乔布斯一副愁眉苦脸的样子，“比你能想象的更糟糕。”他指责斯卡利背叛自己，并表示，没有自己苹果将无法管理。乔布斯抱怨，他的董事,长角色完全是名誊性质的。他被赶出自己在班德利3号楼办公室，搬进一个几近空旷的建筑，他戏称它为“西伯利亚”。赫茨菲尔德将话题转向以前的快乐日子，他们开始怀念过去。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Earlier that week,  Dylan had released a new album, <em>Empire Burlesque</em>, and Hertzfeld brought  a copy that they played on Jobs’s high-tech turntable. The most notable track,  “When the Night Comes Falling from the Sky,” with its apocalyptic message,  seemed appropriate for the evening, but Jobs didn’t like it. It sounded almost  disco, and he gloomily argued that Dylan had been going downhill since <em>Blood  on the Tracks</em>. So Hertzfeld moved the needle to the last song on the album,  “Dark Eyes,” which was a simple acoustic number featuring Dylan alone on guitar  and harmonica. It was slow and mournful and, Hertzfeld hoped, would remind Jobs  of the earlier Dylan tracks he so loved. But Jobs didn’t like that song either  and had no desire to hear the rest of the album.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>迪伦在那一周刚发布了一张新专辑《皇帝讽刺剧》（EmpireBurlesque）。赫茨菲尔德给乔布斯带了一张，在他家的髙科技唱片机上播放。最著名的一曲是《当夜幕降临》（WhentheNightComesFallingFromtheSky），充满启示录的意味，似乎很适合这个夜晚。但是乔布斯并不喜欢，觉得它几乎和迪斯科一样。乔布斯沮丧地认为，自从《路上的血迹》这张专辑后，迪伦就在走下坡路。于是，赫茨菲尔德将唱针移到了最后一首歌曲《黑眼睛》（DarkEyes）,没有电子乐的伴奏，只有吉他和口琴，回荡着迪伦一个人的歌声。这首歌节奏缓慢，感情哀伤。赫茨菲尔德本以为这能让乔布斯想起他所喜爱的迪伦的早期作品，但乔布斯同样不喜欢这首歌，也不想再听这张专辑里的其他歌曲。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs’s overwrought  reaction was understandable. Sculley had once been a father figure to him. So  had Mike Markkula. So had Arthur Rock. That week all three had abandoned him.  “It gets back to the deep feeling of being rejected at an early age,” his  friend and lawyer George Riley later said. “It’s a deep part of his own  mythology, and it defines to himself who he is.” Jobs recalled years later, “I  felt like I’d been punched, the air knocked out of me and I couldn’t breathe.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯过激的反应可以理解。对他而言，斯卡利一度曾是个父亲般的人物。迈克·马库拉也是，亚瑟·罗克亦然。而那个星期，他们三个都抛弃了他。“小时候被拒绝的深切感受再次笼罩了他，”乔布斯的朋友兼律师乔治·莱利（GeorgeRiley）说道，“这是他个人神话的一个深层部分，定义了他是谁。”当乔布斯被马库拉和罗克这样父亲般的人物拒绝后，他再次感到自己被拋弃了。“我觉得自己像被人猛击了一样，没有空气，无法呼吸。”多年后，乔布斯这样回忆说。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Losing the support of  Arthur Rock was especially painful. “Arthur had been like a father to me,” Jobs  said. “He took me under his wing.” Rock had taught him about opera, and he and  his wife, Toni, had been his hosts in San Francisco and Aspen. “I remember  driving into San Francisco one time, and I said to him, ‘God, that Bank of  America building is ugly,’ and he said, ‘No, it’s the best,’ and he proceeded  to lecture me, and he was right of course.” Years later Jobs’s eyes welled with  tears as he recounted the story: “He chose Sculley over me. That really threw  me for a loop. I never thought he would abandon me.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>失去亚瑟·罗克的支持让乔布斯尤为痛苦。“亚瑟就像我的父亲一样，”乔布斯多年后回忆道，“他庇护着我。”罗克给他讲过歌剧，和妻子托妮在旧金山和阿斯彭招待过他。乔布斯从来都不是个喜欢送礼物的人，但他偶尔会给罗克买些礼物，例如他去日本的时候，就给罗克买了一台索尼随身听。“我记得有一次驾车去旧金山，我跟他说，‘天啊，美国银行的大楼真丑。’他就说，‘不，它是最好的。’然后继续为我讲解，而他当然是对的。”即便是多年后讲述起这件事，乔布斯的眼中都会满含泪水。“他选择了斯卡利而不是我。这真的对我是个很大的打击。我从来没想过他会抛弃我。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Making matters worse  was that his beloved company was now in the hands of a man he considered a  bozo. “The board felt that I couldn’t run a company, and that was their  decision to make,” he said. “But they made one mistake. They should have  separated the decision of what to do with me and what to do with Sculley. They  should have fired Sculley, even if they didn’t think I was ready to run Apple.”  Even as his personal gloom slowly lifted, his anger at Sculley, his feeling of  betrayal, deepened.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>更糟的是，他心爱的公司现在正掌握在一个他认为是笨蛋的人手上。“董事会认为我不会运营公司，这就是他们作出的决定。”乔布斯说道，“但是，他们犯了一个错误。他们应该将我和斯卡利分开处理。就算他们觉得我还不够格管理苹果，也应该解雇斯卡利。”尽管内心的悲伤渐渐消失，乔布斯对于斯卡利的愤怒——被背叛的感觉——却更为深刻。<p>他们两人共同的朋友试图打圆场。1985年夏末的一天晚上，鲍勃·梅特卡夫（BobMetealfe）邀请斯卡利和乔布斯来自己在伍德赛德的新家做客。梅特卡夫在施乐帕洛奥图研究中心的时候，与人共同发明了以太网。“这是个可怕的错误，”他回忆道，“约翰和史蒂夫就坐在房子的两端，一句交流也没有，我才意识到自己没法修复他们之间的裂痕。史蒂夫是个伟大的思想家，但在待人方面也可能是个十足的混蛋。”</p>
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The situation worsened  when Sculley told a group of analysts that he considered Jobs irrelevant to the  company, despite his title as chairman. “From an operations standpoint, there  is no role either today or in the future for Steve Jobs,” he said. “I don’t  know what he’ll do.” The blunt comment shocked the group, and a gasp went  through the auditorium.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>斯卡利告诉一些分析师，乔布斯与苹果公司没有关系，尽管这个人的头衔是董事长。这又加剧了两人关系的恶化。“从运营的角度来看，不管是现在还是未来，都没有乔布斯的事。”斯卡利说道，“我不知道他会做什么。”他直率的评论震惊了在座的分析师，大家倒吸了一口凉气。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Perhaps getting away  to Europe would help, Jobs thought. So in June he went to Paris, where he spoke  at an Apple event and went to a dinner honoring Vice President George H. W.  Bush. From there he went to Italy, where he drove the hills of Tuscany with  Redse and bought a bike so he could spend time riding by himself. In Florence  he soaked in the architecture of the city and the texture of the building  materials. Particularly memorable were the paving stones, which came from Il  Casone quarry near the Tuscan town of Firenzuola. They were a calming bluish  gray. Twenty years later he would decide that the floors of most major Apple  stores would be made of this sandstone.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯想，或许跑去欧洲能有所帮助。于是6月，他动身去巴黎，在苹果的一场活动中致辞，并参加了美国副总统乔治·H·W·布什（GeorgeH.W.Bush）的晚宴。不久，他又从法国直接去了意大利，和女友在托斯卡纳的山间开车兜风。乔布斯还买了一辆自行车，可以自己一个人骑出去玩。在佛罗伦萨，乔布斯沉浸在当地的建筑和建筑材料的质地中。尤为难忘的是铺路石，它们都来自托斯卡纳小镇附近费伦佐拉的一家采石场IlCasone。这些石头有着沉静的蓝灰色，颜色饱满悦目。20年后，他决定，大部分大型苹果店的地面就要用来自IlCasone采石场的砂岩铺设。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The Apple II was just  going on sale in Russia, so Jobs headed off to Moscow, where he met up with Al  Eisenstat. Because there was a problem getting Washington’s approval for some  of the required export licenses, they visited the commercial attaché at the  American embassy in Moscow, Mike Merwin. He warned them that there were strict  laws against sharing technology with the Soviets. Jobs was annoyed. At the  Paris trade show, Vice President Bush had encouraged him to get computers into  Russia in order to “foment revolution from below.” Over dinner at a Georgian  restaurant that specialized in shish kebab, Jobs continued his rant. “How could  you suggest this violates American law when it so obviously benefits our  interests?” he asked Merwin. “By putting Macs in the hands of Russians, they  could print all their newspapers.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>AppleII电脑当时刚刚进入俄罗斯市场，因此乔布斯又前往莫斯科，在那里偶遇阿尔·艾森斯塔特。由于苹果公司一些必要的出口许可没有获得美国政府的批准，乔布斯和艾森斯塔特于是同商务专员一起，在驻莫斯科的美国大使馆拜访了迈克·默文（MikeMerwin）。默文警告他们说，美国法律严格反对与苏联共享技术。乔布斯很恼火。在巴黎的贸易展上，副总统老布什刚刚鼓励过他把计算机引入苏联，以“掀起自下而上的革命”。他们在一家以烤串闻名的格鲁吉亚餐厅吃晚饭，席间，乔布斯继续宣泄不满。“这明显是对我们有利，你怎么能说违反了美国法律呢？”他质问默文，“俄罗斯人有了Mac以后就能打印他们所有的报纸了。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs also showed his  feisty side in Moscow by insisting on talking about Trotsky, the charismatic  revolutionary who fell out of favor and was ordered assassinated by Stalin. At  one point the KGB agent assigned to him suggested he tone down his fervor. “You  don’t want to talk about Trotsky,” he said. “Our historians have studied the  situation, and we don’t believe he’s a great man anymore.” That didn’t help.  When they got to the state university in Moscow to speak to computer students,  Jobs began his speech by praising Trotsky. He was a revolutionary Jobs could  identify with.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>在莫斯科，乔布斯还显示了自己争强好胜的一面，他坚持谈论托洛茨基——一位充满领袖魅力的革命家，失宠后被开除出党，最后被斯大林下令暗杀。跟随乔布斯的克格勃特工曾一度建议，乔布斯应当降低自己对这个话题的热情。“你不应该谈论托洛茨基，”他说，“我们的历史学家已经研究了他的情况，我们已经不再承认他是伟人了。”但这样的提醒并没有用。在国立莫斯科大学对计算机专业学生进行演讲时，乔布斯仍以对托洛茨基的赞扬作为开场。他是乔布斯所能认同的革命家。
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs and Eisenstat  attended the July Fourth party at the American embassy, and in his thank-you  letter to Ambassador Arthur Hartman, Eisenstat noted that Jobs planned to  pursue Apple’s ventures in Russia more vigorously in the coming year. “We are  tentatively planning on returning to Moscow in September.” For a moment it  looked as if Sculley’s hope that Jobs would turn into a “global visionary” for  the company might come to pass. But it was not to be. Something much different  was in store for September.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>7月4日，乔布斯和艾森斯塔特参加了在美国大使馆举办的国庆聚会。在写给大使亚瑟·哈特曼（ArthurHartman）的感谢信中，艾森斯塔特指出，乔布斯计划来年在俄罗斯更积极地拓展业务，“我们初步计划在9月重返莫斯科。”斯卡利希望乔布斯变成一位“全球架构师”。事情发展到现在，这个愿望几乎一度成真。但它最终并没有发生。一场巨变即将在9月拉开序幕。
