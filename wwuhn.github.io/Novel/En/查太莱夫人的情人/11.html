<div class='layout'><p>11</p><p>11</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Connie was sorting out one of the Wragby lumber rooms. There were several: the house was a warren, and the family never sold anything. Sir Geoffery's father had liked pictures and Sir Geoffery's mother had liked cinquecento furniture. Sir Geoffery himself had liked old carved oak chests, vestry chests. So it went on through the generations. Clifford collected very modern pictures, at very moderate prices. </p><p>康妮正在一间旧物贮藏室里收拾着。勒格贝有好几间边样的贮藏室，这林厦真是个么贮藏库，而这家人却永不把旧东西南卖。佐佛莱男爵的父亲喜欢收藏图画，佐佛莱男爵的母亲喜欢收藏十六世纪的意大利家具。佐佛莱男爵他自己喜欢收藏橡木雕刻的老箱子，教堂里的圣衣箱。边样一代一代地传下来。克利福收藏些近代画，一些不大值钱的近代画。 </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>So in the lumber room there were bad Sir Edwin Landseers and pathetic William Henry Hunt birds' nests: and other Academy stuff, enough to frighten the daughter of an R.A. She determined to look through it one day, and clear it all. And the grotesque furniture interested her. </p><p>在这旧物贮藏室里，有些兰德西尔的坏作品，有些韩特的可怜的鸟巢和其他一堆庸俗的皇家艺术学会会员的绘画，都是足使一个皇家艺术学会会员的女人吓倒的。她决意把这一切东西查阅一遍，整理出来，那些粗重的有具使她觉得有趣。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Wrapped up carefully to preserve it from damage and dry-rot was the old family cradle, of rosewood. She had to unwrap it, to look at it. It had a certain charm: she looked at it a longtime. </p><p>她发现了一个家传的红木老摇篮。这摇篮被谨慎地包捆着，以防尘埃和损坏。她把它拆开了。这摇篮有着某种可人的地方；她审视了一番。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`It's thousand pities it won't be called for,' sighed Mrs Bolton, who was helping. `Though cradles like that are out of date nowadays.' </p><p>“真可借用不着这个摇篮。”在旁边帮着忙的被太太叹着气说，“虽然这样的摇篮现在已经太旧式了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`It might be called for. I might have a child,' said Connie casually, as if saying she might have a new hat. </p><p>“也许有一天用得着的，我也许要有个孩子呢。”康妮从容地说，仿佛说着她也许可以有一顶新帽子似地轻易。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`You mean if anything happened to Sir Clifford!' stammered Mrs Bolton. </p><p>“难道你是说克利福男爵可以好些么？”波太太结结巴巴地说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`No! I mean as things are. It's only muscular paralysis with Sir Clifford---it doesn't affect him,' said Connie, lying as naturally as breathing. </p><p>“不必等到他好些了，我是照他现在的情况说。他只是筋肉的瘫痪罢了——这对他是没有妨碍的。”康妮自然得象呼吸似地说着谎。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Clifford had put the idea into her head. He had said: `Of course I may have a child yet. I'm not really mutilated at all. The potency may easily come back, even if the muscles of the hips and legs are paralysed. And then the seed may be transferred.' </p><p>那是克利福给她的主意，她说过，“自然啦，我还可以生个孩子的。我并不是真的残废了，纵令臀部和腿部的筋肉瘫痪了，而生殖力是可以容易恢复的，那时种子便可以传递了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He really felt, when he had his periods of energy and worked so hard at the question of the mines, as if his sexual potency were returning. Connie had looked at him in terror. But she was quite quick-witted enough to use his suggestion for her own preservation. For she would have a child if she could: but not his. </p><p>他对于彩矿问题是这样的致力，在这种活泼奋勇的日子里，他真的好象觉得他的性功能就要恢复了。康妮恐怖地望着他。但是她是够机警地把他的暗示拿来当作她自己的武器的。因为假如她能够的话，她定要有个孩子的，不过那决不是克利福的孩子。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mrs Bolton was for a moment breathless, flabbergasted. Then she didn't believe it: she saw in it a ruse. Yet doctors could do such things nowadays. They might sort of graft seed. </p><p>波太大气窒着呆了一会，过后，她知道了这只是欺骗的话罢了，不足相信的，不过，今日的医生们是能做这种事的；他们很能够做接种这类的事情的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Well, my Lady, I only hope and pray you may. It would be lovely for you: and for everybody. My word, a child in Wragby, what a difference it would make!' </p><p>“呵，夫人，我只希望和褥着你可以有个孩子，对于你和对于大家，那是件多么可喜的事！老实说，勒格贝大厦里有个孩子，事情就大不同了！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Wouldn't it!' said Connie. </p><p>“可不是？”康妮说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And she chose three R. A. pictures of sixty years ago, to send to the Duchess of Shortlands for that lady's next charitable bazaar. She was called `the bazaar duchess', and she always asked all the county to send things for her to sell. She would be delighted with three framed R. A.s. She might even call, on the strength of them. How furious Clifford was when she called! </p><p>她选了三张六十年前的皇家艺术学会会员的图画，去送给学兰公爵夫人主办的慈善贩卖会。人家叫她做“贩卖会会爵夫人”，她是常常向所有的有爵位的人征求物品给她贩卖的，她得了这三张装了框、署了皇家艺术学会会员的名的图画，定要得意极了，她也许还要亲自来拜谢呢，克利福是顶讨厌她的造访的！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But oh my dear!" Mrs Bolton was thinking to herself. "Is it Oliver Mellors' child you're preparing us for? Oh my dear, that would be a Tevershall baby in the Wragby cradle, my word! Wouldn't shame it, neither!" </p><p>“但是，天呀！”波太太心里想，“你准备给我们的是不是梅乐士的孩子啊？天呀，天呀，那简直是一个达娃斯哈的孩子在勒格贝大厦摇篮里了！不过那也可以无愧于这个摇篮的！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Among other monstrosities in this lumber room was a largish blackjapanned box, excellently and ingeniously made some sixty or seventy years ago, and fitted with every imaginable object. On top was a concentrated toilet set: brushes, bottles, mirrors, combs, boxes, even three beautiful little razors in safety sheaths, shaving-bowl and all. Underneath came a sort of escritoire outfit: blotters, pens, ink-bottles, paper, envelopes, memorandum books: and then a perfect sewing-outfit, with three different sized scissors, thimbles, needles, silks and cottons, darning egg, all of the very best quality and perfectly finished. Then there was a little medicine store, with bottles labelled Laudanum, Tincture of Myrrh, Ess. Cloves and so on: but empty. Everything was perfectly new, and the whole thing, when shut up, was as big as a small, but fat weekend bag. And inside, it fitted together like a puzzle. The bottles could not possibly have spilled: there wasn't room. </p><p>在这旧物贮藏室堆积着的许多离奇古怪的东西中，有一日黑漆的大箱子，做得非常巧妙，这是六七十年前的东西，里面安排着各种各样的物件，上面是一些梳妆用品；刷子、瓶子、镜子、梳子、小盒子甚至三个精致的保险小剃刀、肥皂、确和一切刮脸用品。下面是写字台用品：吸水纸、笔、墨水瓶、纸、信封、记事薄。再下全是在女红用具；三把大小不同的剪刀、针、信封、记事簿。再下便是女红用具；三把大小不同的剪刀、针、针箍、丝线、棉线。补缀用的木球，这一切都是精细的上品，此外还有个放药品的格子，瓶子上标着名种药名：“鸦片药酒”、“松香水”、“丁香精”等，但都是空的。一切都是没有用过的东西。整个箱子台起来的时候，象一个小而拥肿的提箱。里面摆布得迷魂阵一样的密。密到子里的，水都流不出来：因为一点空也都没有了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The thing was wonderfully made and contrived, excellent craftsmanship of the Victorian order. But somehow it was monstrous. Some Chatterley must even have felt it, for the thing had never been used. It had a peculiar soullessness. </p><p>做工和设计都非常精美，这是维多利亚时代的手艺但是这箱子却有点太怪异了。购置这日箱子的查太莱前辈一定也有这种感觉所以从来没有人拿来使用过，这是一口无灵魂的死箱子。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Yet Mrs Bolton was thrilled. </p><p>虽然，波太太却喜欢极了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Look what beautiful brushes, so expensive, even the shaving brushes, three perfect ones! No! and those scissors! They're the best that money could buy. Oh, I call it lovely!' </p><p>看看多美丽的刷子这么值钱的东西，甚至那三把刮脸用的肥筇刷，都是无美不备啊！还有那些剪刀！那是钱所能买的最精致的东西了。呵！真可爱！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Do you?' said Connie. `Then you have it.' </p><p>“你觉得么？”康妮说，“那么，你拿去罢。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Oh no, my Lady!' </p><p>“呵，不！夫人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Of course! It will only lie here till Doomsday. If you won't have it, I'll send it to the Duchess as well as the pictures, and she doesn't deserve so much. Do have it!' </p><p>“是的，拿去罢！否则它要在这儿搁到地球末日呢。假如你不要，我便拿来和图画一起送给公爵夫人了，她是不配受用这许多东西的。真的，拿去罢！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Oh, your Ladyship! Why, I shall never be able to thank you.' </p><p>“呵！夫人！我真不知道怎么感谢你才好。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`You needn't try,' laughed Connie. </p><p>“那么不要感谢好了。”康妮笑着说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And Mrs Bolton sailed down with the huge and very black box in her arms, flushing bright pink in her excitement. </p><p>波太太手里抱着那只大而黝黑的箱子，兴奋得满面春风地走下楼来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mr Betts drove her in the trap to her house in the village, with the box. And she had to have a few friends in, to show it: the school-mistress, the chemist's wife, Mrs Weedon the undercashier's wife. They thought it marvellous. And then started the whisper of Lady Chatterley's child. </p><p>女管家白蒂斯太太驶着车，把波太太利她的箱子，带到村里她家中去。那得请几位朋友来玩赏玩赏于是她请了药剂师的女儿、女教员和一个掌柜助手的女人维顿太太到家里来。她们赏叹了一番之后，开始低谈着查太莱男爵夫人要生小孩了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Wonders'll never cease!' said Mrs Weedon. </p><p>“神奇的事情是常常有的。”维顿太太说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But Mrs Bolton was convinced, if it did come, it would be Sir Clifford's child. So there! </p><p>但是波太太坚信着，如果孩子真出世了，那定是克得福男爵的孩子。便是这样！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Not long after, the rector said gently to Clifford: </p><p>不久以后，教区的牧师来对克利福慈祥地说：</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`And may we really hope for an heir to Wragby? Ah, that would be the hand of God in mercy, indeed!' </p><p>“我们是不是可以希望一个勒格贝的继承者呢？呵，要是这样，那真是圣灵显迹了！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Well! We may hope,' said Clifford, with a faint irony, and at the same time, a certain conviction. He had begun to believe it really possible it might even be his child. </p><p>”晤！我们可以这样希望吧。”克利福带着微徽和讥讽同时又有着某种信心地说。他开始相信那是很可能的。甚至相信孩子也许是他的限。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Then one afternoon came Leslie Winter, Squire Winter, as everybody called him: lean, immaculate, and seventy: and every inch a gentleman, as Mrs Bolton said to Mrs Betts. Every millimetre indeed! And with his old-fashioned, rather haw-haw! manner of speaking, he seemed more out of date than bag wigs. Time, in her flight, drops these fine old feathers. </p><p>一天下午，大家都叫他做“乡绅文达”的来斯里·文达来了，这是个清瘦、修洁的、七十岁的老先生。“从头到脚都是贵绅。”正始波太太对白蒂斯太太说的一样。的确！他说起话来那种“咳咳！”不绝曰的古老样子，好象比从前戴假发的绍绅还来得冬烘。飞奔的时光，把这些古雅的东西都淘汰了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They discussed the collieries. Clifford's idea was, that his coal, even the poor sort, could be made into hard concentrated fuel that would burn at great heat if fed with certain damp, acidulated air at a fairly strong pressure. It had long been observed that in a particularly strong, wet wind the pit-bank burned very vivid, gave off hardly any fumes, and left a fine powder of ash, instead of the slow pink gravel. </p><p>他们讨论着煤矿问题。克利福的意思，以为他的煤炭的品质给纵令不佳．但是可以做成一种集中燃料，这种燃料如果加以某种带酸的湿空气，好好强压起来，是能够发出很大的热力的，很久以来，人们已注意过这种事实了。在一种强有力的湿风之中，煤炕边燃烧出来的火是畅亮的，差不多没有烟的，剩下来的只是些灰粉，而不是粉红色的粗大砂砾。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`But where will you find the proper engines for burning your fuel?' asked Winter. </p><p>“但是你到哪里去找到适当的机器去用你的燃料呢？”文达问道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`I'll make them myself. And I'll use my fuel myself. And I'll sell electric power. I'm certain I could do it.' </p><p>“我要自己去制造这种机器，并且自己去消用这种燃料。这样产生出来的电力我便拿出来卖。我确信这是可以做的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`If you can do it, then splendid, splendid, my dear boy. Haw! Splendid! If I can be of any help, I shall be delighted. I'm afraid I am a little out of date, and my collieries are like me. But who knows, when I'm gone, there may be men like you. Splendid! It will employ all the men again, and you won't have to sell your coal, or fail to sell it. A splendid idea, and I hope it will be a success. If I had sons of my own, no doubt they would have up-to-date ideas for Shipley: no doubt! By the way, dear boy, is there any foundation to the rumour that we may entertain hopes of an heir to Wragby?' </p><p>“假如你做得到的话，那好极了，好极了，我的孩子。咳！好极了！要是我能够帮什么忙的话，我是很愿意的。我恐怕我自己利我的煤矿场都是不太合时宜了。但是谁知道呢？当我瞑目以后，还可以有象你一样的人，好极了！这一来所有的工人又有工作了，那时代不要再管煤销不销了。真是好主意，我希望这主意可以成功，要是我自已有儿子的话，无疑地他们会曾希勃来矿场出些新主意。无疑的！顺便问一句，我的亲爱的孩子，外面传的风声，究竟真不真？我们是不是可以希望个勒格贝的继承人？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Is there a rumour?' asked Clifford. </p><p>“外面有这么一个风声么？”克利福问道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Well, my dear boy, Marshall from Fillingwood asked me, that's all I can say about a rumour. Of course I wouldn't repeat it for the world, if there were no foundation.' </p><p>“是的，亲爱的孩子，住在惠灵坞的马沙尔向我问起这事是不是真的，这便是我听到的风声，自然，要是这是无稽之谈，我决不向外多嘴的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Well, Sir,' said Clifford uneasily, but with strange bright eyes. `There is a hope. There is a hope.' </p><p>“晤，文达先生。”克利福不安地说，但是两只眼睛发着异光。“希望是有一个的，希望是有一个的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Winter came across the room and wrung Clifford's hand. </p><p>文达从房子的那边踱了过来，把克利福的手紧握着。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`My dear boy, my dear lad, can you believe what it means to me, to hear that! And to hear you are working in the hopes of a son: and that you may again employ every man at Tevershall. Ah, my boy! to keep up the level of the race, and to have work waiting for any man who cares to work!---' </p><p>“我亲爱的孩子，我亲爱的朋友，你知道不知道我听了心里多快活？知道你抱着得子的希望工作着，也许那一天达娃斯哈的工人都要重新受雇于你了！呵，我的孩子、能够保持着家声，和有着现成的工作给有意工作的任何人……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The old man was really moved. </p><p>老头儿实在感动了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Next day Connie was arranging tall yellow tulips in a glass vase. </p><p>第二天康妮正把一些黄色的郁金香安置在一个玻璃瓶里。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Connie,' said Clifford, `did you know there was a rumour that you are going to supply Wragby with a son and heir?' </p><p>“康妮，”克利福说，“你知道外边传说着你就要给勒格贝生一个继承人了吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Connie felt dim with terror, yet she stood quite still, touching the flowers. </p><p>康妮觉得给恐怖笼罩着了。但是她却安泰地继续布摆着她的花。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`No!' she said. `Is it a joke? Or malice?' </p><p>“我不知道。”她说，“那是笑话呢，还是有意中伤？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He paused before he answered: </p><p>他静默了一会，然后答道：</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Neither, I hope. I hope it may be a prophecy.' </p><p>“我希望两样都不是。我希望那是一个预言。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Connie went on with her flowers. </p><p>康妮还是在整理着她的花。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`I had a letter from Father this morning,' She said. `He wants to know if I am aware he has accepted Sir Alexander Cooper's Invitation for me for July and August, to the Villa Esmeralda in Venice.' </p><p>“我今早接了父亲一封信。”她说，“他问我，他已经替我答应过亚力山大·柯泊爵士，在七月和八月到他的威尼斯的‘爱斯姆拉达别墅去度署的事，忘记了没有。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`July and August?' said Clifford. </p><p>“七月和八月？”克利福说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Oh, I wouldn't stay all that time. Are you sure you wouldn't come?' </p><p>“呵，我不会留两个月他么久的，你真的不能一起去么”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`I won't travel abroad,' said Clifford promptly. </p><p>“我不愿到国外旅行去。”克利福迅速地说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She took her flowers to the window. </p><p>她把花拿到窗前去。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Do you mind if I go?' she said. You know it was promised, for this summer. </p><p>“要是我去，你不介意罢？”她说，“你知道那是答应了的事情。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`For how long would you go?' </p><p>你要去多少时候？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Perhaps three weeks.' </p><p>“也许三个星期。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>There was silence for a time. </p><p>大家静默了一会。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Well,' said Clifford slowly, and a little gloomily. `I suppose I could stand it for three weeks: if I were absolutely sure you'd want to come back.' </p><p>“那吗，”克利福慢慢地、带几分忧郁地说，“假如你去了一定还想回来的话，我想三个星期我是可以忍受的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`I should want to come back,' she said, with a quiet simplicity, heavy with conviction. She was thinking of the other man. </p><p>“我一定要回来的。”她质朴地娴静地说，心里确信着她是一定要回来的。她正想着另一个男子。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Clifford felt her conviction, and somehow he believed her, he believed it was for him. He felt immensely relieved, joyful at once. </p><p>克利福觉着她的确信，他相信她，他相信那是为了他的缘故。他觉得心上的一块石头松了，他马上笑逐颜开起来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`In that case,' he said, `I think it would be all right, don't you?' </p><p>“这样吗，”他说，“我想是没有问题的，是不是？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`I think so,' she said. </p><p>“是的。”她说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`You'd enjoy the change?' She looked up at him with strange blue eyes. </p><p>“换换空气，你定要觉得快乐罢？”她的奇异的蓝色的眼睛望着他。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`I should like to see Venice again,' she said, `and to bathe from one of the shingle islands across the lagoon. But you know I loathe the Lido! And I don't fancy I shall like Sir Alexander Cooper and Lady Cooper. But if Hilda is there, and we have a gondola of our own: yes, it will be rather lovely. I do wish you'd come.' </p><p>“我很喜欢再见见威尼斯，”她说，“并且在那浅水湖过去的小岛的沙滩上洗洗澡。但是你知道我是厌恶丽岛的！我相信我不会喜欢亚力大·柯泊爵士和柯泊爵士夫人的。但是有希尔达在那儿，并且假如我们有一只自己的游艇，那么，是的，那定是有趣的。我实在希望你也能一起去呢。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She said it sincerely. She would so love to make him happy, in these ways. </p><p>她说这话是出于至诚的。她很愿意在这种小事情上使他快乐快乐的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Ah, but think of me, though, at the Gare du Nord: at Calais quay!' </p><p>“唉，但是想象一下我在巴黎北车站或加来码头上的情形罢！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`But why not? I see other men carried in litter-chairs, who have been wounded in the war. Besides, we'd motor all the way.' </p><p>“但是那有什么关系呢？我看过其他的在大战中受了伤的人，用异床抢着呢。何况我们是可以坐汽车去呢。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`We should need to take two men.' </p><p>“那么我们得带两个仆人去了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Oh no! We'd manage with Field. There would always be another man there.' </p><p>“呵，用不着，我们带非尔德去全蚝了，那边总会有个仆人的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But Clifford shook his head. </p><p>但是克利福摇了摇头。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Not this year, dear! Not this year! Next year probably I'll try.' </p><p>“今年不动了，亲爱的，今年不去！或者明年再看罢。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She went away gloomily. Next year! What would next year bring? She herself did not really want to go to Venice: not now, now there was the other man. But she was going as a sort of discipline: and also because, if she had a child, Clifford could think she had a lover in Venice. </p><p>她忧愁地走开了，明年！明年他又将怎样么？她自己实在并不想到威尼斯去，现在不，现在是有了那个男了了，但是她还是要去，为了要服从生活的纪律的缘故；而且，要是她有了孩子的话，克利福会相信她是在威尼斯有了个情人的缘故。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was already May, and in June they were supposed to start. Always these arrangements! Always one's life arranged for one! Wheels that worked one and drove one, and over which one had no real control! </p><p>现在已经是五月了，他们是打算在六月间便要出发的。老是这一类的安排！一个人的生命老是安排定了。轮子转着，转着，把人驱使着，驾双着，人实在是莫可奈何的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was May, but cold and wet again. A cold wet May, good for corn and hay! Much the corn and hay matter nowadays! Connie had to go into Uthwaite, which was their little town, where the Chatterleys were still the Chatterleys. She went alone, Field driving her. </p><p>已经是五月了，但是天气又寒冷而多雨起来。俗话说的：“寒冷多雨再五月，利于五谷和草秣。”五欲和草袜在我们日重要的东西了！康妮得上啊斯魏去走一趟，这是他们的小市镇。那儿，查太莱的姓名依旧是威风赫赫的，她是一个人去的，非尔得驶着她的汽车。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In spite of May and a new greenness, the country was dismal. It was rather chilly, and there was smoke on the rain, and a certain sense of exhaust vapour in the air. One just had to live from one's resistance. No wonder these people were ugly and tough. </p><p>虽然是五月天，而且处处是嫩绿，但是乡间景色是忧郁的。天气是够冷的，雨中杂着烟雾。空气里浮荡着某种倦怠的感觉。一个人不得不在抵抗中生活。无怪乎这些人都是丑恶而粗钝的了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The car ploughed uphill through the long squalid straggle of Tevershall, the blackened brick dwellings, the black slate roofs glistening their sharp edges, the mud black with coal-dust, the pavements wet and black. It was as if dismalness had soaked through and through everything. The utter negation of natural beauty, the utter negation of the gladness of life, the utter absence of the instinct for shapely beauty which every bird and beast has, the utter death of the human intuitive faculty was appalling. The stacks of soap in the grocers' shops, the rhubarb and lemons in the greengrocers! the awful hats in the milliners! all went by ugly, ugly, ugly, followed by the plaster-and-gilt horror of the cinema with its wet picture announcements, `A Woman's Love!', and the new big Primitive chapel, primitive enough in its stark brick and big panes of greenish and raspberry glass in the windows. The Wesleyan chapel, higher up, was of blackened brick and stood behind iron railings and blackened shrubs. The Congregational chapel, which thought itself superior, was built of rusticated sandstone and had a steeple, but not a very high one. Just beyond were the new school buildings, expensivink brick, and gravelled playground inside iron railings, all very imposing, and fixing the suggestion of a chapel and a prison. Standard Five girls were having a singing lesson, just finishing the la-me-doh-la exercises and beginning a `sweet children's song'. Anything more unlike song, spontaneous song, would be impossible to imagine: a strange bawling yell that followed the outlines of a tune. It was not like savages: savages have subtle rhythms. It was not like animals: animals mean something when they yell. It was like nothing on earth, and it was called singing. Connie sat and listened with her heart in her boots, as Field was filling petrol. What could possibly become of such a people, a people in whom the living intuitive faculty was dead as nails, and only queer mechanical yells and uncanny will-power remained? </p><p>汽车艰辛地爬着上坡，哟过达娃斯哈的散漫龌龊的村落，一些黑色砖墙的屋子，它们的黑石板的屋顶的尖锐的边缘发着亮光，地上的泥土夹着煤屑，颜色是黑的。行人道是湿而黑的。仿佛一切的一切都给凄凉郁的情绪所浸透了。丝没有自然的美，丝毫没有生之乐趣，甚至一只鸟、一只野兽所有的美的本能都全部消失了，人类的直觉官能都全部死了。这种情形是令人寒心的。杂货店的一堆一堆的肥皂，蔬菜店的大黄莱和柠檬，时装钥的丑怪帽了，一幕一幕地在丑恶中过去，跟着是俗不可面的电影戏院，广告画上标着：“妇人之爱！”和原始派监理会的新的大教堂，它的光滑的砖墙和窗上的带青带红的大快玻璃实在是够原始的。再过去，是维斯莱源的小教堂，墙砖是黝黑的，直立在铁栏和一些黑色的小树后边，自由派的小教堂，自以为高人一等，是用乡村风味的沙石筑成的，而且有个钟楼，但并不是个很高的钟楼。就在那后边，有个新建的校舍，是用高价的红砖筑成的，前面有个沙地的运动场，用铁栅环绕着，整个看起来是很堂皇的，又象教堂又象监狱。女孩子们在上着唱歌课，刚刚练习完了“拉一米一多一拉”，正开始唱着一首儿单的短歌。世上再也没有比这个更不象歌唱一自然的歌唱一的东西了：这只是一阵奇异的呼号，带了点腔调的模样罢了。那还赶不上野蛮人；野蛮人还有微妙的节奏。那还赶不上野兽；野兽呼号起来的时候还是有意义的。世上没有象这样可怖的东西，而这种东西却叫做唱歌！当非尔德去添汽油的时候，康妮坐在车里觉得肉麻地听着。这样一种人民，直觉的官能已经死尽，只剩下怪异的机械的呼号和乖房的气力，这种人民会有什么将来呢？　　</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>A coal-cart was coming downhill, clanking in the rain. Field started upwards, past the big but weary-looking drapers and clothing shops, the post-office, into the little market-place of forlorn space, where Sam Black was peering out of the door of the Sun, that called itself an inn, not a pub, and where the commercial travellers stayed, and was bowing to Lady Chatterley's car. </p><p>在雨中，一辆煤车在轰轰地下着山坡，非尔德添好了油，把车向山坡上开行，经过了那些大的但是凄凉的裁缝店、布匹店和邮政局，来到了寂寞的市场上，那儿，杉·布勒克正在他的所谓“太阳旅店”的酒肆里。伺望着外边的行人，并且向查泰莱男爵夫人的汽车行了士个鞠躬。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The church was away to the left among black trees. The car slid on downhill, past the Miners' Arms. It had already passed the Wellington, the Nelson, the Three Tuns, and the Sun, now it passed the Miners' Arms, then the Mechanics' Hall, then the new and almost gaudy Miners' Welfare and so, past a few new `villas', out into the blackened road between dark hedges and dark green fields, towards Stacks Gate. </p><p>大教堂是在左边的黑树丛中，汽车现在下坡了，经过“矿工之家”咖啡店。汽车已经经过了“威录敦”、“纳尔逊”、“三桶”和“太阳”这些咖啡酒肆，现在打“矿工之家”门前经过了，然后再经过了“机师堂”，又经过了新开的够华丽的“矿工之乐”，最后经过了几个新的所谓“别墅”而到了上史德门去的黝黑的路，两旁是灰暗的篱笆和暗青色的草原。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Tevershall! That was Tevershall! Merrie England! Shakespeare's England! No, but the England of today, as Connie had realized since she had come to live in it. It was producing a new race of mankind, over-conscious in the money and social and political side, on the spontaneous, intuitive side dead, but dead. Half-corpses, all of them: but with a terrible insistent consciousness in the other half. There was something uncanny and underground about it all. It was an under-world. And quite incalculable. How shall we understand the reactions in half-corpses? When Connie saw the great lorries full of steel-workers from Sheffield, weird, distorted smallish beings like men, off for an excursion to Matlock, her bowels fainted and she thought: Ah God, what has man done to man? What have the leaders of men been doing to their fellow men? They have reduced them to less than humanness; and now there can be no fellowship any more! It is just a nightmare. </p><p>达娃斯哈！那便是达娃斯哈！快乐的英格兰！莎士比亚的英格兰！晤！不！那是今日的英格兰。自从康妮在那儿居住以后，她明白了。这英格半正生产着一种新的人类，迷醉于金钱及社会政治生活，而自然的直觉的官能却是死灭了的新人类。这是些半死的尸体，但是，活着的一半却奇异地、固执地生活着。这一切都是怪涎的，乖庚的。这是个地下的世界，不可以臆测的世界，我们怎样能够明白这些行尸的反应呢？康妮看见一些大的运货车，里面装满着雪菲尔德钢铁厂的工人，一些具有人类模样的、歪曲的、妖怪样的小东西，正向着蔑洛克去作野外旅行，她的心不禁酸楚起来。她想：唉，上帝呵，人类把自己弄成怎么样了？人类的领导者们，把他们同胞开弄成怎么样了？他们把他们的人性都消灭了，现在世上再也不能有友爱了！那只是一场恶梦！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She felt again in a wave of terror the grey, gritty hopelessness of it all. With such creatures for the industrial masses, and the upper classes as she knew them, there was no hope, no hope any more. Yet she was wanting a baby, and an heir to Wragby! An heir to Wragby! She shuddered with dread. </p><p>她在—种恐怖的波浪中，重新觉得这一切都是灰色的、令人寒心的失望。这些生物便是工人群众；而上层阶级的内容怎样也是她所深知的，那是没有希望的了，再也没有什么希望的了。可是，她却希望着一个孩子，一个继承人！一个勒格贝的继承人！她不禁惊悸起来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Yet Mellors had come out of all this!---Yes, but he was as apart from it all as she was. Even in him there was no fellowship left. It was dead. The fellowship was dead. There was only apartness and hopelessness, as far as all this was concerned. And this was England, the vast bulk of England: as Connie knew, since she had motored from the centre of it. </p><p>而梅乐士却是从这一切中出来的！是的，但是他与这一切却远隔着，如她自己与这一切无隔着一样。不过，甚至在他那里也没有什么友爱了。友爱死了，那儿只有孤寂与失望。这便是英格兰，英格兰的大部分。康妮很知道，因为她今天是从这样的英格兰的大部分的中心经过的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The car was rising towards Stacks Gate. The rain was holding off, and in the air came a queer pellucid gleam of May. The country rolled away in long undulations, south towards the Peak, east towards Mansfield and Nottingham. Connie was travelling South. </p><p>汽车正向着史德门上去。雨渐渐停止了，空气中浮着一种奇异的、透明的五月之光。乡景一幕一幕地卷了过去，往南是毕克，往东是门司非德和诺汀汉。康妮正向着南方走去。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>As she rose on to the high country, she could see on her left, on a height above the rolling land, the shadowy, powerful bulk of Warsop Castle, dark grey, with below it the reddish plastering of miners' dwellings, newish, and below those the plumes of dark smoke and white steam from the great colliery which put so many thousand pounds per annum into the pockets of the Duke and the other shareholders. The powerful old castle was a ruin, yet it hung its bulk on the low sky-line, over the black plumes and the white that waved on the damp air below. </p><p>当汽车驶到了高原上面时，她看向见左手边，在一个高临乡野的高地上，那深灰色的，暗淡而雄壮的华梭勃宫堡，下面是些带红色的半新的工人住宅。再下面，便是煤场的大工厂，还正在曰着一缕缕的灰暗的烟和自蒸气，这工厂每年是要把几千几万金镑放在公爵和其他股东的腰包里的。这雄壮的老宫堡；败了，然而它还是高耸天际，俯视着下面湿空气中的黑烟和白雾。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>A turn, and they ran on the high level to Stacks Gate. Stacks Gate, as seen from the highroad, was just a huge and gorgeous new hotel, the Coningsby Arms, standing red and white and gilt in barbarous isolation off the road. But if you looked, you saw on the left rows of handsome `modern' dwellings, set down like a game of dominoes, with spaces and gardens, a queer game of dominoes that some weird `masters' were playing on the surprised earth. And beyond these blocks of dwellings, at the back, rose all the astonishing and frightening overhead erections of a really modern mine, chemical works and long galleries, enormous, and of shapes not before known to man. The head-stock and pit-bank of the mine itself were insignificant among the huge new installations. And in front of this, the game of dominoes stood forever in a sort of surprise, waiting to be played. </p><p>转了个弯，他们在高原上向着史德门前进。从这路上看起来，史德门只是个庞大的壮丽的新饭店。离路不远的地方，金碧辉煌的柯宁斯贝饭店，在一种荒寂的情况中耸立着。但是，细看起来，你便看得见左手边一排排精致的“摩登”住宅，安排得象滑牌戏似的，一家家用花园互相隔离着，这是几个妖怪的“主子们”在这块糠人的土地上所玩的一种奇异的骨牌戏。在这个住宅区过去，耸立着一些真正近代矿场的骇人的凌空建筑，一些化学工厂巨大的长廓，它们的形式是前此人类所梦想不到的。在这种庞大的新设备中间，连矿场矿坑本身都不算什么了。在这大建筑的前面，那骨牌戏都是惊奇地摆在那儿，等待着主干们去玩它。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>This was Stacks Gate, new on the face of the earth, since the war. But as a matter of fact, though even Connie did not know it, downhill half a mile below the `hotel' was old Stacks Gate, with a little old colliery and blackish old brick dwellings, and a chapel or two and a shop or two and a little pub or two. </p><p>这便是战后新兴的史德门。但是事实上，尽管康妮并不认识它，老史德门是在那“饭店”下边半英里路之遥，那是一个老的小矿场，一些黑砖筑的老住宅，一两个小教堂，一两间商店和一两间小酒店。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But that didn't count any more. The vast plumes of smoke and vapour rose from the new works up above, and this was now Stacks Gate: no chapels, no pubs, even no shops. Only the great works', which are the modern Olympia with temples to all the gods; then the model dwellings: then the hotel. The hotel in actuality was nothing but a miners' pub though it looked first-classy. </p><p>但是这一切都算不得什么了。新工厂里冒着浓烟和蒸汽的地方才是现在的史德门。那儿没有教堂，没有小酒店、甚至没有商店，只有些大工厂。这是现代的奥式皮亚神国里面有着一切的神的殿堂；此外便些模范住宅和饭店，所谓饭店、虽然看起来怪讲究的，其实只是个故工们的酒店罢了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Even since Connie's arrival at Wragby this new place had arisen on the face of the earth, and the model dwellings had filled with riff-raff drifting in from anywhere, to poach Clifford's rabbits among other occupations. </p><p>这块新地方，其至是从康妮到勒格贝以后才建筑起来的。那些模范住宅里，住满着从四方八面来的一些流氓，这些人所干的勾安之一，便是去偷捕克利福的兔子。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The car ran on along the uplands, seeing the rolling county spread out. The county! It had once been a proud and lordly county. In front, looming again and hanging on the brow of the sky-line, was the huge and splendid bulk of Chadwick Hall, more window than wall, one of the most famous Elizabethan houses. Noble it stood alone above a great park, but out of date, passed over. It was still kept up, but as a show place. `Look how our ancestors lorded it!' </p><p>汽车在高原上走着，她望着整个的州府，一起一伏地开憎爱分明过去。这个州府往昔是个骄做的、威风赫赫的州府呢！在好怖前，那直立天际，象是海市蜃楼的房屋，便是查维克大厦。它的窗户占了墙壁的大部分，这是伊丽莎白时代的一个最出名的宫堡。它孤独地、高贵地站在一个大花园的上头。虽然是古旧了。过时了。但是人们还当作一个荣耀的遗物似地保存着。“瞧瞧我们的祖先是多么的显贵！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>That was the past. The present lay below. God alone knows where the future lies. The car was already turning, between little old blackened miners' cottages, to descend to Uthwaite. And Uthwaite, on a damp day, was sending up a whole array of smoke plumes and steam, to whatever gods there be. Uthwaite down in the valley, with all the steel threads of the railways to Sheffield drawn through it, and the coal-mines and the steel-works sending up smoke and glare from long tubes, and the pathetic little corkscrew spire of the church, that is going to tumble down, still pricking the fumes, always affected Connie strangely. It was an old market-town, centre of the dales. One of the chief inns was the Chatterley Arms. There, in Uthwaite, Wragby was known as Wragby, as if it were a whole place, not just a house, as it was to outsiders: Wragby Hall, near Tevershall: Wragby, a `seat'. </p><p>那是过去，现在是在那下面。将来呢，只有上帝知道在哪里了。汽车已经转着弯了，两旁是些老而黑的矿工的小村舍，汽车正向着阿斯魏下去。在这阴湿的日子里，阿斯魏正冒着一阵阵的烟和蒸汽，好象为什么天神焚香似的。阿斯魏是在那山谷的下面，到雪非尔德的所有的铁道线都打这儿穿过，那些长烟囱里冒着烟和闪光的煤矿场和钢铁厂，那教堂上的螺钻似的凄惨的小钟楼，虽然就要倒塌了，但是依旧还矗立在烟雾中，这样的阿斯魏，常常总使康妮觉得奇怪地感动。这是个山谷中央在古老的村镇。有一个主要的旅舍名叫“查太莱”。阿斯魏人都谯勒格贝是一个地方的总名，而不是一个屋名。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The miners' cottages, blackened, stood flush on the pavement, with that intimacy and smallness of colliers' dwellings over a hundred years old. They lined all the way. The road had become a street, and as you sank, you forgot instantly the open, rolling country where the castles and big houses still dominated, but like ghosts. Now you were just above the tangle of naked railway-lines, and foundries and other `works' rose about you, so big you were only aware of walls. And iron clanked with a huge reverberating clank, and huge lorries shook the earth, and whistles screamed. </p><p>矿工们的勤黑的村舍是平着行人道起的，狭小得象百多年前的矿工住宅一样。这些村舍都是洞着道路起，道路于是成了一条街了。当你走进这街里面的时候，你便要立刻忘记了那开豁的、起伏的原野。这原野上还有着富堡和大厦耸立着，但是和鬼影一般了。现在康妮正到了那光赤的铁道网的上头，那儿四面都起着高大的镀冶金属的工厂和其他的工厂，歙人觉得四周只是些墙壁，铁的声音在嚣响着，庞大的载货车震动着地皮，号笛叫着。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Yet again, once you had got right down and into the twisted and crooked heart of the town, behind the church, you were in the world of two centuries ago, in the crooked streets where the Chatterley Arms stood, and the old pharmacy, streets which used to lead Out to the wild open world of the castles and stately couchant houses. </p><p>然而当你沿着这条路下去，到了那曲折撤搂的市镇中心时，在那教堂的后面，你便进到了一个两世纪以前的世界上了。“查太莱”旅舍和那老药房，便在这弯曲的街上。这街从前是通到这些富堡和权贵者们的游乐别所在的旷野外去的大道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But at the corner a policeman held up his hand as three lorries loaded with iron rolled past, shaking the poor old church. And not till the lorries were past could he salute her ladyship. </p><p>在那街角上，一个警察正举着手，让三辆载着铁条的货车过去，使那可怜的者教堂颠震着。直至这些货车过去了，那警察才向查太男爵夫人行礼。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>So it was. Upon the old crooked burgess streets hordes of oldish blackened miners' dwellings crowded, lining the roads out. And immediately after these came the newer, pinker rows of rather larger houses, plastering the valley: the homes of more modern workmen. And beyond that again, in the wide rolling regions of the castles, smoke waved against steam, and patch after patch of raw reddish brick showed the newer mining settlements, sometimes in the hollows, sometimes gruesomely ugly along the sky-line of the slopes. And between, in between, were the tattered remnants of the old coaching and cottage England, even the England of Robin Hood, where the miners prowled with the dismalness of suppressed sporting instincts, when they were not at work. </p><p>在那市区的弯曲的老街两旁，挤拥着所有旧而黑的矿工住宅。再过去，便是一排排较新而稍大的房屋，起在那山谷的坡上。这是些较现代的矿工的住宅。再远一些，在那宫堡大厦所在的临野上，烟与蒸汽夹杂着，漾荡着，星罗棋布着无数的红砖建筑，有的在低凹处，有的狞恶地在那斜坡上突入天际，这便是矿区。在这矿区的里头，轿式马车和茅舍时代的老英格兰，甚至罗宾汉时代的英格兰还残留着。在那儿，矿工们不做工的时候，他们的受压制的好动的本能无聊起来；便东奔西窜地闲散浪荡着；</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>England, my England! But which is my England? The stately homes of England make good photographs, and create the illusion of a connexion with the Elizabethans. The handsome old halls are there, from the days of Good Queen Anne and Tom Jones. But smuts fall and blacken on the drab stucco, that has long ceased to be golden. And one by one, like the stately homes, they were abandoned. Now they are being pulled down. As for the cottages of England---there they are---great plasterings of brick dwellings on the hopeless countryside. </p><p>英格兰哟，我的英格兰！但是哪个是我的英格兰？英格兰的权贵者们的堂皇大厦，照起像来真是好看极了，而且在我们和伊丽莎白时代的人们之间创造了一种幻象的联系。古香古色的古老大厦，现在还存在着，和在慈爱的安妮王后与汤姆·琼斯的时代一样。但是烟灰把褐黄色的粉漆弄黑了，很久以来便再也没有那黄金颜彩了，而且一个一个地，象那些官堡一般，被人遣弃了。现在开始被人拆毁了。至于那育英格兰时代的茅舍呢，现在却变成芒寂的乡野中的一些槛楼的大砖屋了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Now they are pulling down the stately homes, the Georgian halls are going. Fritchley, a perfect old Georgian mansion, was even now, as Connie passed in the car, being demolished. It was in perfect repair: till the war the Weatherleys had lived in style there. But now it was too big, too expensive, and the country had become too uncongenial. The gentry were departing to pleasanter places, where they could spend their money without having to see how it was made.' </p><p>现在，人们把官堡拆毁了，乔治风格的大厦也渐渐完了。那无美不备地乔治风格的大厦佛力治，当康妮的汽车打那门前经过时，也正在被人拆毁着。这大厦还是很完整的。大战以前，维持莱一家人还是阔绰地住在里面的，但是现在，人家觉得这大厦太大了，太花费了，并且四邻都太仇视了，贵族都到了较为愉快的地方去住了，那儿，他们是可以挥霍着金钱而不必知道金钱之来处的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>This is history. One England blots out another. The mines had made the halls wealthy. Now they were blotting them out, as they had already blotted out the cottages. The industrial England blots out the agricultural England. One meaning blots out another. The new England blots out the old England. And the continuity is not Organic, but mechanical. </p><p>这便是历史：一个英格兰把其他的一个英格半消灭了。煤矿业曾使那些大厦致富。现在却把那些大厦消灭了。如同把那些茅舍消灭了一样。工业的英覆半把农业的英格兰消灭了。一种意义把另一种意义消灭了。新英格兰把旧英格兰消灭了。事态的继续并不是有机的，而是机械式的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Connie, belonging to the leisured classes, had clung to the remnants of the old England. It had taken her years to realize that it was really blotted out by this terrifying new and gruesome England, and that the blotting out would go on till it was complete. Fritchley was gone, Eastwood was gone, Shipley was going: Squire Winter's beloved Shipley. </p><p>属于富裕阶级的康妮，曾攀附着那残余的者英格兰，直至经过了不少的年代，她才明白了，实际上，她的阶级已经给这骇人的右怖的新英格兰消灭了，而且这种消灭工作将继续着，直至消灭净尽了为止。佛力治莱没有了，伊斯乌德没有了，文达先生所爱的希勃莱也就要没有了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Connie called for a moment at Shipley. The park gates, at the back, opened just near the level crossing of the colliery railway; the Shipley colliery itself stood just beyond the trees. The gates stood open, because through the park was a right-of-way that the colliers used. They hung around the park. </p><p>康妮在希勃莱停了一会。屋后的园门是挨近矿场铁道和大路的交叉点的，希勃莱矿场本身就在那些树丛后边。园门大开着，因为矿工们是有权通过花园的。他们在园里游荡着。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The car passed the ornamental ponds, in which the colliers threw their newspapers, and took the private drive to the house. It stood above, aside, a very pleasant stucco building from the middle of the eighteenth century. It had a beautiful alley of yew trees, that had approached an older house, and the hall stood serenely spread out, winking its Georgian panes as if cheerfully. Behind, there were really beautiful gardens. </p><p>汽车经过了那点缀园景的水池旁边一但矿工们却把他们的报纸抛在这池里一·然后由一条特别的小咱来到那大厦门前。这是个十八世纪中期的可爱的粉漆的建筑。那儿有一条美丽的水松树的小径，这小径从前是通到一个老屋去的。大厦的正面安静地开展着，它的乔治风格的玻璃窗户好象一些欢乐的眼睛似地闪烁着。屋后边便量些令人羡慕的花园。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Connie liked the interior much better than Wragby. It was much lighter, more alive, shapen and elegant. The rooms were panelled with creamy painted panelling, the ceilings were touched with gilt, and everything was kept in exquisite order, all the appointments were perfect, regardless of expense. Even the corridors managed to be ample and lovely, softly curved and full of life. </p><p>康妮觉得里面的一切都比勒格贝可爱得多，光亮得多，并且更有生气，都丽而雅致。房子的墙壁都嵌着乳黄色的木板，天花板油着金色，每样东西都美妙修洁，一切布置都尽美尽妙，处处都花费过大量金钱的。甚至那些走廓都布置得宽大而可爱，优雅地弯曲着，并且充满着生气。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But Leslie Winter was alone. He had adored his house. But his park was bordered by three of his own collieries. He had been a generous man in his ideas. He had almost welcomed the colliers in his park. Had the miners not made him rich! So, when he saw the gangs of unshapely men lounging by his ornamental waters---not in the private part of the park, no, he drew the line there---he would say: `the miners are perhaps not so ornamental as deer, but they are far more profitable.' </p><p>不过文达是孤独地生活着，他深爱他的住宅。但是他的花园却给他自己的三个煤矿场围绕着。他的想法是很慷慨的。他的花园差不多是欢迎矿工们进来的。难道不是这些矿工们使他有钱的么！所以，当他看见一君君的槛楼的工人到他的水池边闲逛时一自然不能进到他的私人花园里面，这几是有个界限的一他便要说：“矿工们也许不象鹿子那样可以点缀园景，但是他们比鹿子是有利得多了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But that was in the golden---monetarily---latter half of Queen Victoria's reign. Miners were then `good working men'. </p><p>但那是维多利亚王后在位的后半期一金钱满地的黄金时代，那时，矿工们都是些“老实的工人”。　　‘</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Winter had made this speech, half apologetic, to his guest, the then Prince of Wales. And the Prince had replied, in his rather guttural English: </p><p>文达把这种话向他的贵宾，那时还是威尔士王子，半谢罪地说，那王子用他的带喉音的英语回答说：</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`You are quite right. If there were coal under Sandringham, I would open a mine on the lawns, and think it first-rate landscape gardening. Oh, I am quite willing to exchange roe-deer for colliers, at the price. Your men are good men too, I hear.' </p><p>“你说的很对，要是在桑德灵韩富的花园下面藏有煤炭的话，我定要在那青草上开个矿场，并且要认为那是最上等的花园布景。呵，我很情愿用这价钱把化鹿去换矿工，我还听说你的工人都是些好人呢。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But then, the Prince had perhaps an exaggerated idea of the beauty of money, and the blessings of industrialism. </p><p>那时，这王子也许把金钱之美和工业之福惠说得过火一点吧。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>However, the Prince had been a King, and the King had died, and now there was another King, whose chief function seemed to be to open soup-kitchens. </p><p>但是这王子后来做了国王，而这国王也已崩逝了。现在是一位另外的国王，他的主要职秒似乎是在主持慈善粥研厂的开幕礼。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And the good working men were somehow hemming Shipley in. New mining villages crowded on the park, and the squire felt somehow that the population was alien. He used to feel, in a good-natured but quite grand way, lord of his own domain and of his own colliers. Now, by a subtle pervasion of the new spirit, he had somehow been pushed out. It was he who did not belong any more. There was no mistaking it. The mines, the industry, had a will of its own, and this will was against the gentleman-owner. All the colliers took part in the will, and it was hard to live up against it. It either shoved you out of the place, or out of life altogether. </p><p>那些“好工人”，现在却正浸蚀着希勃莱。大花园里，雨后春笋似地起了许多新的肘落，“老乡绅”的心里，觉得这种民众是异样了，从前，他是心下宽大的，觉得你是自己的产业和自己的矿工们的主子。现在呢，一种新的精神在微妙地侵浸着，他觉得被排挤了。他的产业好象再也不属于他了，那是不容人误会的。矿业与工业、有着一个自我的意志。这意志是反对贵绅主子的！所有的矿工都是参预这意志的人，要想反抗这个意志是困难的，这意志使你失掉你的地位，或者使你从生命中滚蛋！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Squire Winter, a soldier, had stood it out. But he no longer cared to walk in the park after dinner. He almost hid, indoors. Once he had walked, bare-headed, and in his patent-leather shoes and purple silk socks, with Connie down to the gate, talking to her in his well-bred rather haw-haw fashion. But when it came to passing the little gangs of colliers who stood and stared without either salute or anything else, Connie felt how the lean, well-bred old man winced, winced as an elegant antelope stag in a cage winces from the vulgar stare. The colliers were not personally hostile: not at all. But their spirit was cold, and shoving him out. And, deep down, there was a profound grudge. They `worked for him'. And in their ugliness, they resented his elegant, well-groomed, well-bred existence. `Who's he!' It was the difference they resented. </p><p>曾经讲过军队的“多绅文达”，亏他还站得稳。但是他在晚饭之后，再也不想到花园里去散步了。他差不多总是躲在家里。一天晚上，他光着头，穿着漆皮鞋和紫色的丝袜子，陪着康妮在园门边去，用他的“咳，咳”不离口的上流社会的文雅的口气和她谈着，但是当他经过——群矿工面前时，他们只是望着他，头都不点。康妮觉得这清瘦的、高雅的老先生在退缩着，好象一只笼子里的都丽的羚羊给庸俗的眼睛凝视着时退缩着一般。矿工们，在私人方面对他是没有恶意的，一点也没有。但是他们的精神是无情地．反抗他的。他们的心底里深深地怨恨地。在丑恶中生活着的他们，对于他的都丽的，斯文的，高雅的生活里含恨的。“他是谁呵！”他们所恨的是他与他们间的不同地方。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And somewhere, in his secret English heart, being a good deal of a soldier, he believed they were right to resent the difference. He felt himself a little in the wrong, for having all the advantages. Nevertheless he represented a system, and he would not be shoved out. </p><p>虽然，在他的英格兰人的心和他的兵士之心的秘密处，他相信他们急恨这种“不同的地方”是有理由的，他觉得他的享受这一切优越的权益有点不对的，但是他是代表一种制度，所以他是不愿被人排挤的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Except by death. Which came on him soon after Connie's call, suddenly. And he remembered Clifford handsomely in his will. </p><p>只有死才能排挤他。在康妮访他不久以后，死神突然地把他攫去了。在他的遗嘱中，他并没有忘记给克利福很大的好处。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The heirs at once gave out the order for the demolishing of Shipley. It cost too much to keep up. No one would live there. So it was broken up. The avenue of yews was cut down. The park was denuded of its timber, and divided into lots. It was near enough to Uthwaite. In the strange, bald desert of this still-one-more no-man's-land, new little streets of semi-detacheds were run up, very desirable! The Shipley Hall Estate! </p><p>继承他的财产的人，马上叫人把希勃莱拆毁了。因为保存这大厦太花钱了。谁也不愿意住在那里，于是这大便毁灭了。那美丽的水松树的路线原来伐了。园中的树木也砍光了。整个产业也分成小块了。这地方是很近阿斯魏的。在这新的“无人之城”的奇异的荒原上，新起着一排排的舒适的屋宇；于是便变成了希渤莱新村子！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Within a year of Connie's last call, it had happened. There stood Shipley Hall Estate, an array of red-brick semi-detached `villas' in new streets. No one would have dreamed that the stucco hall had stood there twelve months before. </p><p>康妮到那里去的一年以后，一切都工了，现在那里是希特莱新村了，一座座红砖的屋宇起在那些新避的街道上，没有会梦想到十二个月以前，那里还有过一座壮丽的粉漆大厦。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But this is a later stage of King Edward's landscape gardening, the sort that has an ornamental coal-mine on the lawn. </p><p>但是这是爱德华王所私授的花园布景法的新时代，这是一种拿煤矿场来点缀草地的花园布景法。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>One England blots out another. The England of the Squire Winters and the Wragby Halls was gone, dead. The blotting out was only not yet complete. </p><p>一个英格兰把另一个英格兰消灭了。乡绅文达和勒格贝大厦的英格兰是完了。死了，不过这种消灭工作还没有做到尽头罢了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>What would come after? Connie could not imagine. She could only see the new brick streets spreading into the fields, the new erections rising at the collieries, the new girls in their silk stockings, the new collier lads lounging into the Pally or the Welfare. The younger generation were utterly unconscious of the old England. There was a gap in the continuity of consciousness, almost American: but industrial really. What next? </p><p>以后将怎样呢！康妮是不能想象的。她只能看见一些新的砖石的街道铺在田野上，新的建筑物在矿场上起着，新的女工穿着她们的丝袜，新的男工到跳舞宫去。后辈人是完全意识不着老英格兰的。在意识之继续中，有个破缺，差不多是美国式的，但其实是工业的破缺。以后将怎样呢？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Connie always felt there was no next. She wanted to hide her head in the sand: or, at least, in the bosom of a living man. </p><p>康妮总觉得那儿并没有以后。她想把她的头藏匿在沙里；或者，至少藏匿在一个活着的男子的怀里。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The world was so complicated and weird and gruesome! The common people were so many, and really so terrible. So she bought as she was going home, and saw the colliers trailing from the pits, grey-black, distorted, one shoulder higher than the other, slurring their heavy ironshod boots. Underground grey faces, whites of eyes rolling, necks cringing from the pit roof, shoulders Out of shape. Men! Men! Alas, in some ways patient and good men. In other ways, non-existent. Something that men should have was bred and killed out of them. Yet they were men. They begot children. One might bear a child to them. Terrible, terrible thought! They were good and kindly. But they were only half, Only the grey half of a human being. As yet, they were `good'. But even that was the goodness of their halfness. Supposing the dead in them ever rose up! But no, it was too terrible to think of. Connie was absolutely afraid of the industrial masses. They seemed so weird to her. A life with utterly no beauty in it, no intuition, always `in the pit'. </p><p>世界是这样的错杂，这样的奇怪，这样的丑恶！普通的人是这样多，而又这样可怕，真的！她回家去时，心里这样想着，望着矿工们缓慢地离开矿坑，又炭又黑，一身歪着，一边肩耸着，一边肩低着，响着他们的沉重的镶铁的长靴。脸色苍白得鬼似的，眼睛闪着自，预项缩着，肩膊失了望膊的模样。这是人，这是人，唉。在某种说法上，他们是些忍耐的好人；在其他的说法上，他们只是鬼。他们的人类所应具有的某种东西被戮杀了。然而，他们却是人，他们却能生孩子，人是可以由他们而生孩子，可怕的，可怕的思索呵：他们是温和的好人。但是他们只是一种半人，灰色的半人，直至现在，他们是“好”的，但这也不过是他们的一半是好的，呵！假如他们死了的部分苏醒过来！晤！去想象这个，真是太可怕了！康妮是深怕工人群众的，她觉得他们是这样的不可思议。他们的生命是绝对没有美的，绝对没有直觉的，老是“在矿坑里”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Children from such men! Oh God, oh God! </p><p>这样的人所生的孩子！呵，天哟天！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Yet Mellors had come from such a father. Not quite. Forty years had made a difference, an appalling difference in manhood. The iron and the coal had eaten deep into the bodies and souls of the men. </p><p>虽然，梅乐士是这样的一种人生的。也许不十分是。在人情上，四十年是有变迁的，有大大的变迁的。钦与煤把人类的肉体与灵魂深深地吞食了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Incarnate ugliness, and yet alive! What would become of them all? Perhaps with the passing of the coal they would disappear again, off the face of the earth. They had appeared out of nowhere in their thousands, when the coal had called for them. Perhaps they were only weird fauna of the coal-seams. Creatures of another reality, they were elementals, serving the elements of coal, as the metal-workers were elementals, serving the element of iron. Men not men, but animas of coal and iron and clay. Fauna of the elements, carbon, iron, silicon: elementals. They had perhaps some of the weird, inhuman beauty of minerals, the lustre of coal, the weight and blueness and resistance of iron, the transparency of glass. Elemental creatures, weird and distorted, of the mineral world! They belonged to the coal, the iron, the clay, as fish belong to the sea and worms to dead wood. The anima of mineral disintegration! </p><p>虽然，那丑恶休身的人类却生活着！这一切结果要怎样呢？也许煤炭消灭之日，他们也会从这地面上消灭了罢。他们是当媒炭号召他们时，成千成万地从无中而来的，或者他们只是些煤层里的怪异的动物罢，他们是另一世界的生物，他们是煤的一种无素，好像铁工是铁的一种无素的一样。这是些非人的人。他们是煤、铁与陶土的灵魂。炭素、铁索、砂素等元素的动物。边些小元素，他们也许有点奇异的非人的矿物的美；跟煤的光泽，铁的重量也蓝色与抗力，玻璃的透明一样的美。矿物世界的妖怪的、伛偻的、无素的生物！他们属于煤、铁与阔土，正如鱼之属于水、虫之属于腐木一样。他们是矿物的分解物的灵魂！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Connie was glad to be home, to bury her head in the sand. She was glad even to babble to Clifford. For her fear of the mining and iron Midlands affected her with a queer feeling that went all over her, like influenza. </p><p>康妮惧怕这煤和铁的米德兰，这种惧怕使她周身觉得一种怪异的感觉如同受了流行感冒一样，她觉得高兴地离开了这一切而回到家里，把头埋在沙里，她甚至觉得高兴地去和克利福聊天。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Of course I had to have tea in Miss Bentley's shop,' she said. </p><p>“当然啦，我不得不在彭莱小姐的店里喝杯茶。”她说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Really! Winter would have given you tea.' </p><p>“真的么！但是文达家里会请你喝茶的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Oh yes, but I daren't disappoint Miss Bentley.' </p><p>“呵。是的，不过我不便却彭莱小姐的情。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Miss Bentley was a shallow old maid with a rather large nose and romantic disposition who served tea with a careful intensity worthy of a sacrament. </p><p>彭莱小姐是个脸色带黄的老处女，有个大鼻子和浪漫的气质，她侍候人喝茶时候的殷勤热烈，是好象在做圣典一样的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Did she ask after me?' said Clifford. </p><p>“她问起我没有？”克利福说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Of course!---. May I ask your Ladyship how Sir Clifford is!---I believe she ranks you even higher than Nurse Cavell!' </p><p>“当然啦！‘请问夫人，克利福男爵身体好吗？’我相信她把你看得比嘉威尔小姐还高呢。”　　一</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`And I suppose you said I was blooming.' </p><p>“我想你对地说了我身体很好罢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Yes! And she looked as rapt as if I had said the heavens had opened to you. I said if she ever came to Tevershall she was to come to see you.' </p><p>“是的！她听了这话，好象听了我对她说天堂的门为你开了一般的喜悦。我对她说，要是她来达娃斯喻时，她定要到这儿来看看你。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Me! Whatever for! See me!' </p><p>“我！为什么？来看看我！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Why yes, Clifford. You can't be so adored without making some slight return. Saint George of Cappadocia was nothing to you, in her eyes.' </p><p>“呵，是的，克利福。你不能尿让人家这样崇拜你而不稍稍报答人家。在她的眼里，嘉巴多西亚的圣乔治都绝对赶不上你呢。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`And do you think she'll come?' </p><p>“你相信她会来吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Oh, she blushed! and looked quite beautiful for a moment, poor thing! Why don't men marry the women who would really adore them?' </p><p>“呵。她的脸红了起来，那片刻问，她变得怪美丽的，可怜的东西！为汁么男子们不跟真正崇拜他们的女子结婚呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`The women start adoring too late. But did she say she'd come?' </p><p>“女子们的崇拜开始得太迟了。但是她有没有说她会来？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Oh!' Connie imitated the breathless Miss Bentley, `your Ladyship, if ever I should dare to presume!' </p><p>“呵！”康妮模仿着彭莱小姐的喘息着的声音说，“夫人哟、我哪几敢这么告次！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Dare to presume! how absurd! But I hope to God she won't turn up. And how was her tea?' </p><p>“造次！多么可笑！但是我希望她不要真的来了，她的茶怎么洋？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Oh, Lipton's and very strong. But Clifford, do you realize you are the Roman de la rose of Miss Bentley and lots like her?' </p><p>“呵，立敦茶，浓得很呢！但是，克利福，你知道你是彭莱小姐和许多；宝一类的老处女的《玫瑰史》？，么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`I'm not flattered, even then.' </p><p>“纵令这样，我也不引以为荣。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`They treasure up every one of your pictures in the illustrated papers, and probably pray for you every night. It's rather wonderful.' </p><p>“她们把你在画报上所登的像怎。都好象宝贝般藏了起来，并且她们也许每天晚上都替你祈祷呢，真是樟极了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She went upstairs to change. </p><p>她回到楼上去换布裳。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>That evening he said to her: </p><p>那天晚上，他对她说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`You do think, don't you, that there is something eternal in marriage?' </p><p>“你是不是觉得在结婚生活之中，有些什么永存的东西？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She looked at him. </p><p>她望着他。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`But Clifford, you make eternity sound like a lid or a long, long chain that trailed after one, no matter how far one went.' </p><p>“不过，克利福，你把‘永存’看得象个帽子似的，或者看得象个长长的链索似的，施曳一个人后边，无论人走到多么远都得曳着。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He looked at her, annoyed. </p><p>她烦恼地望着她。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`What I mean,' he said, `is that if you go to Venice, you won't go in the hopes of some love affair that you can take au grand sérieux, will you?' </p><p>“我的意思是，”他说，“假如你到威尼斯去，你不要抱着一种希望，希望有个什么可以认为大正经的情史罢。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`A love affair in Venice au grand sérieux? No. I assure you! No, I'd never take a love affair in Venice more than au très petit sérieux.' </p><p>“在威尼斯有个可以认为大正经的情史？不，放心罢！不，我在威尼斯决不会有个比小正经更正经的情史的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She spoke with a queer kind of contempt. He knitted his brows, looking at her. </p><p>她的声调里，带着一种奇特的轻鄙的意味。他皱着眉头望着她。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Coming downstairs in the morning, she found the keeper's dog Flossie sitting in the corridor outside Clifford's room, and whimpering very faintly. </p><p>第二天早晨，当她到楼下去时，她看见守猎人的狗一佛萝茜，正坐在克利福卧室门前的走廓里，轻轻地叫着。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Why, Flossie!' she said softly. `What are you doing here?' </p><p>“怎么，佛萝茜”她温柔地说，“你在这儿干吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And she quietly opened Clifford's door. Clifford was sitting up in bed, with the bed-table and typewriter pushed aside, and the keeper was standing at attention at the foot of the bed. Flossie ran in. With a faint gesture of head and eyes, Mellors ordered her to the door again, and she slunk out. </p><p>她静静地把克利福的门打开了，克利福正坐在床上，他的床桌的打字机推在一边。守猎人站在床边等着，佛萝茜跑了进来，梅乐士的头部和眼睛做了个轻轻的姿势叫它到门外夫，它才溜了出来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Oh, good morning, Clifford!' Connie said. `I didn't know you were busy.' </p><p>“呀，早安，克利福！”康妮说，“我不知道你们有事呢。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Then she looked at the keeper, saying good morning to him. He murmured his reply, looking at her as if vaguely. But she felt a whiff of passion touch her, from his mere presence. </p><p>然后她望着守猎人，向他道了早安。他摸棱地望着她，低、声地回答着。但是仅仅他的现在，已使她觉得一种热情之浪荡到她身上来了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Did I interrupt you, Clifford? I'm sorry.' </p><p>“我打扰了你们吗，克利福？真对不起。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`No, it's nothing of any importance.' </p><p>“不，那是毫无紧要的事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She slipped out of the room again, and up to the blue boudoir on the first floor. She sat in the window, and saw him go down the drive, with his curious, silent motion, effaced. He had a natural sort of quiet distinction, an aloof pride, and also a certain look of frailty. A hireling! One of Clifford's hirelings! `The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves, that we are underlings.' </p><p>她重新走出门来，到第一层楼上的蓝色梳妆室里去，她坐在窗前，望着他那种奇异的、静默的形态向那大路下去。他有着一种自然缄默的高贵，一种冷淡的骄傲，和某种弱不禁风的神气。一个雇工！一个克利福的雇工！“亲爱的布鲁图斯哟，不要埋怨我们的昨辰不烘照，如果我们侈共一等，那是我们自己的过错呵。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Was he an underling? Was he? What did he think of her? </p><p>他是不是低人一等呢？他是不是？他那一方面又觉得他怎样呢？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was a sunny day, and Connie was working in the garden, and Mrs Bolton was helping her. For some reason, the two women had drawn together, in one of the unaccountable flows and ebbs of sympathy that exist between people. They were pegging down carnations, and putting in small plants for the summer. It was work they both liked. Connie especially felt a delight in putting the soft roots of young plants into a soft black puddle, and cradling them down. On this spring morning she felt a quiver in her womb too, as if the sunshine had touched it and made it happy. </p><p>那是太阳光耀的一天，康妮在花园里工作着，波太太帮着她。为了一种什么缘故，这两个女人，给人类间存在着一种不可解的同情之潮所溶台了，她们把麝香石竹系在栓子上，她们种着一些夏季的小植物，这种工作她们俩都喜欢的。康妮尤其觉得把小植物的嫩根播入轻松的黑土里，再把它们轻轻埋好，是一种快乐的事，在这春日的早晨，她觉得子宫的深处在颤动着。仿佛阳光照了它，而使它快活起来似的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`It is many years since you lost your husband?' she said to Mrs Bolton as she took up another little plant and laid it in its hole. </p><p>“你丈夫过世好多年了罢？”她一边对波太太说，一边拿起了一根小植物放在泥穴里。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Twenty-three!' said Mrs Bolton, as she carefully separated the young columbines into single plants. `Twenty-three years since they brought him home.' </p><p>“二十三年了！”波太太一边说，一边小心地把楼斗菜一一分开。“自从他们把他带回家里到现在。有二十三年了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Connie's heart gave a lurch, at the terrible finality of it. `Brought him home!' </p><p>“康妮听了这“带回家里”的可怖的结局，心里不禁吓了一跳。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Why did he get killed, do you think?' she asked. `He was happy with you?' </p><p>“你以为她是为什么遭难的？”她问道。“他生前和你快乐么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was a woman's question to a woman. Mrs Bolton put aside a strand of hair from her face, with the back of her hand. </p><p>这是妇人与妇人间的一个问题，波太太用她的手背，把垂在脸上的一撮头发拂了开去。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`I don't know, my Lady! He sort of wouldn't give in to things: he wouldn't really go with the rest. And then he hated ducking his head for anything on earth. A sort of obstinacy, that gets itself killed. You see he didn't really care. I lay it down to the pit. He ought never to have been down pit. But his dad made him go down, as a lad; and then, when you're over twenty, it's not very easy to come out.' </p><p>“我不晓得，夫人！他是一种不屈不挠的人；并且不愿与他人同道的，那是一种致命的固执性：宁死而不愿低头，你知道，他对什么都是漠然，我认为那是矿坑的罪过。他原就不应该到矿坑里做工的。但是他还小的时候，他的父亲便强迫他到矿坑里做工。这一来，当你过了二十岁时，那是不太容易改行的了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Did he say he hated it?' </p><p>“他曾说过他讨厌到矿坑里做工么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Oh no! Never! He never said he hated anything. He just made a funny face. He was one of those who wouldn't take care: like some of the first lads as went off so blithe to the war and got killed right away. He wasn't really wezzle-brained. But he wouldn't care. I used to say to him: "You care for nought nor nobody!" But he did! The way he sat when my first baby was born, motionless, and the sort of fatal eyes he looked at me with, when it was over! I had a bad time, but I had to comfort him. "It's all right, lad, it's all right!" I said to him. And he gave me a look, and that funny sort of smile. He never said anything. But I don't believe he had any right pleasure with me at nights after; he'd never really let himself go. I used to say to him: Oh, let thysen go, lad!---I'd talk broad to him sometimes. And he said nothing. But he wouldn't let himself go, or he couldn't. He didn't want me to have any more children. I always blamed his mother, for letting him in th' room. He'd no right t'ave been there. Men makes so much more of things than they should, once they start brooding.' </p><p>“呵。不！从来没有说过！他是从来不说他厌恶什么的。他只露着难看的面色罢了。他是那些粗心大意的人之一；好象大战开始的时候，那些第一批狂欢赴战，立刻阵亡的青年们一样他的头脑不是不清醒。就是什么都漠然。我常对他说：‘您下对什么漠然。谁也不管！但这不是真的！呵。当我生第一胎孩子时，他那一动不动的静默着的神气。和孩子生过后，他望着我的那种凄惨的眼睛！那时我受了不小的苦痛。但是我得去安慰他。我对他说：‘不要紧的，亲爱的，不要紧的！’他望着我，怪的道笑着。他从来不说什么的，但我相信从此以后，他在夜里和我再也没有什么真正乐趣了；他再也不您意任性了。我常对他说：‘呵。亲爱的。让您自己任性点罢！’……我有时是要对他说这种粗的话的。他却不说什么，池总是不愿让他自己任性时儿，也许他不能罢。他不愿我再有孩子了，我常常埋怨他的母亲。她不该让他进产房里来的。他不应到那里去的。男子们的旦熟思起来的时候，是要把一切事情都张大起来着。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Did he mind so much?' said Connie in wonder. </p><p>“那对他有这么大的影响么？”康妮惊愕地说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Yes, he sort of couldn't take it for natural, all that pain. And it spoilt his pleasure in his bit of married love. I said to him: If I don't care, why should you? It's my look-out!---But all he'd ever say was: It's not right!' </p><p>“是的。那种生产的苦痛。他是不能认为天然的。那把他夫妇之爱中所应得的乐趣都糟塌了。我对他说：‘要是我自己都不介意，为什么你要介意？那是我的事情呢！……’他中回答道：“那是不公道的！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Perhaps he was too sensitive,' said Connie. </p><p>“也许他是个太易感动的人吧。”康妮说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`That's it! When you come to know men, that's how they are: too sensitive in the wrong place. And I believe, unbeknown to himself he hated the pit, just hated it. He looked so quiet when he was dead, as if he'd got free. He was such a nice-looking lad. It just broke my heart to see him, so still and pure looking, as if he'd wanted to die. Oh, it broke my heart, that did. But it was the pit.' </p><p>“对了！当你认识了男子的时候，你便知道他们在不该感动的地方。便太易感动了。我相信，连他自己也不晓得他是痛恨矿坑的，恨得入骨的，他死后的脸容是那么安静。仿佛他是被解救了似的。他生前是很漂亮的一个青年！当我看见他那么安泰。那么纯洁的样子，仿佛是他自己愿意死似的。我的心都碎了。唉！真的，那使我的心都碎了。但是那是矿坑的罪过。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She wept a few bitter tears, and Connie wept more. It was a warm spring day, with a perfume of earth and of yellow flowers, many things rising to bud, and the garden still with the very sap of sunshine. </p><p>说着，她流了几滴伤心泪。康妮却哭得比她更厉害。那天是个温暖的春日。空中浮荡着与黄花的香馨，许多东西在萌牙，阳光的精华充满着肃静的园里。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`It must have been terrible for you!' said Connie. </p><p>“你一定难过极了！”康妮说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Oh, my Lady! I never realized at first. I could only say: Oh my lad, what did you want to leave me for!---That was all my cry. But somehow I felt he'd come back.' </p><p>“阿夫人！起初我还不太明白呢，我只能反复地哭着说：‘我的人哟，为什么你要离开我！……’我再也找不着其他的话说。但是我总觉得他会回来的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`But he didn't want to leave you,' said Connie. </p><p>“但是那并不是他要离开你呢。”康妮说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Oh no, my Lady! That was only my silly cry. And I kept expecting him back. Especially at nights. I kept waking up thinking: Why he's not in bed with me!---It was as if my feelings wouldn't believe he'd gone. I just felt he'd have to come back and lie against me, so I could feel him with me. That was all I wanted, to feel him there with me, warm. And it took me a thousand shocks before I knew he wouldn't come back, it took me years.' </p><p>“是的，夫人！那不过是我哭着时说的傻话，我继续地希望着他会回来的。尤其是在夜里，我眼不交睫地想着，为什么他不在这床上？……仿佛我的感觉不容我相信他是死了似的。我只觉得池是定要回来的。回来假紧着我躺着，使我可以觉得他是和我在一起，我唯一所希望的，便是感觉着他温暖暖地和我在一起。唉！不知道经过了多少次的捻，经过了多少年。我才明白他不会回来了！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`The touch of him,' said Connie. </p><p>“和他的肉体的接触不会回来了。”康妮说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`That's it, my Lady, the touch of him! I've never got over it to this day, and never shall. And if there's a heaven above, he'll be there, and will lie up against me so I can sleep.' </p><p>“对啦。夫人！和他的肉体的接触！直至今日。我还忘不了，而且永久也忘不了的。假如上面有天的话，他将在那儿。他将假紧着我躺着，使我能入睡。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Connie glanced at the handsome, brooding face in fear. Another passionate one out of Tevershall! The touch of him! For the bonds of love are ill to loose! </p><p>康妮惊惧地向她的深思的标致的脸孔瞥了一眼。又是一个达娃斯哈出来的热情的人！和他的肉体的接触；“因为爱之束缚。不易解开！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`It's terrible, once you've got a man into your blood!' she said. `Oh, my Lady! And that's what makes you feel so bitter. You feel folks wanted him killed. You feel the pit fair wanted to kill him. Oh, I felt, if it hadn't been for the pit, an' them as runs the pit, there'd have been no leaving me. But they all want to separate a woman and a man, if they're together.' </p><p>“你一旦深爱了一个男子时，那是可怕的！”她说。“唉！夫人、那便是使人觉得这么苦痛的原因，你觉得人们都是希望他死的。你觉得矿坑是存心害死他的。唉。我觉得假如世上没有矿坑。并且没有经营煤矿的人的话，他是决不会离开我的。但是他们全都是想拆散一对相投的男女。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`If they're physically together,' said Connie. </p><p>“肉体地相投的男友。”康妮说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`That's right, my Lady! There's a lot of hard-hearted folks in the world. And every morning when he got up and went to th' pit, I felt it was wrong, wrong. But what else could he do? What can a man do?' </p><p>“对了，夫人！这世上铁石心肠的人太多了，每天早晨，当他起来去矿坑里做工时，我总觉得那是不祥的，不祥的，但是他除了到矿坑里做工以外还能怎样呢？一个穷人能怎样呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>A queer hate flared in the woman. </p><p>一种奇异的疾恨燃烧着这个妇人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`But can a touch last so long?' Connie asked suddenly. `That you could feel him so long?' </p><p>“难道一种接触关系能够延续到这么久么？”康妮突然地问道，“那使你这么久还能够感觉着他么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>`Oh my Lady, what else is there to last? Children grows away from you. But the man, well! But even that they'd like to kill in you, the very thought of the touch of him. Even your own children! Ah well! We might have drifted apart, who knows. But the feeling's something different. It's 'appen better never to care. But there, when I look at women who's never really been warmed through by a man, well, they seem to me poor doolowls after all, no matter how they may dress up and gad. No, I'll abide by my own. I've not much respect for people.' </p><p>“呵，夫人，除此以外还有什么能持久的呢？孩子们长大了便要离开你。但是男子，呵！……但是连这点接触的记忆，他们都想把你夺杀了。甚至你自己的孩子！不过，谁知道！我们也许是要分离的。但是感情是不同的东西哟，也许最好是永远不要爱上谁。不过，当我看见那些从来不曾真正地受男子彻底地温暖过的女人，我便觉得她们总是些可怜虫。不怕她们穿得多漂亮。风头出得多有劲，不，我的主意是不会变的。我对于人世是没有什么尊敬的。”</p></div>
