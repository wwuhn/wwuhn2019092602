<div class='layout'><p>PART ONE Lightness and Weight</p><p>第一部分 轻与生</p></div>

<div class='layout'><p>1</p><p>1</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The idea of "eternal return" is a mysterious one, and Nietzsche has often perplexed other philosophers with it: to think that everything recurs as we once experienced it, and that the recurrence itself recurs ad infinitum! What does this mad myth signify?</p><p>尼采常常与哲学家们纠缠一个神秘的“众劫回归”观：想想我们经历过的事情吧，想想它们重演如昨，甚至重演本身无休无止地重演下去！这癫狂的幻念意味着什么？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Putting it negatively, the myth of "eternal return" states that a life which disappears once and for all, which does not return, is like a shadow, without weight, dead in advance, and whether it was horrible, beautiful, or sublime, its horror, sublimity, and beauty mean nothing. We need take no more note of it than of a war between two African kingdoms in the fourteenth century, a war that altered nothing in the destiny of the world, even if a hundred thousand blacks perished in excruciating torment.</p><p>从反面说“永劫回归”的幻念表明，曾经一次性消失了的生活，象影子一样没有分量，也就永远消失不复回归了。无论它是否恐怖，是否美丽，是否崇高，它的恐怖、崇高以及美丽都预先已经死去，没有任何意义。它象十四世纪非洲部落之间的某次战争，某次未能改变世界命运的战争，哪伯有十万黑人在残酷的磨难中灭绝，我们也无须对此过分在意。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Will the war between two African kingdoms in the fourteenth century itself be altered if it recurs again and again, in eternal return?</p><p>然而，如果十四世纪的两个非洲部落的战争一次又一次重演，战争本身会有所改变吗？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It will: it will become a solid mass, permanently protuberant, its inanity irreparable.</p><p>会的，它将变成一个永远隆起的硬块，再也无法归复自己原有的虚空。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>If the French Revolution were to recur eternally, French historians would be less proud of Robespierre. But because they deal with something that will not return, the bloody years of the Revolution have turned into mere words, theories, and discussions, have become lighter than feathers, frightening no one. There is an infinite difference between a Robespierre who occurs only once in history and a Robespierre who eternally returns, chopping off French heads.</p><p>如果法国大革命永无休止地重演，法国历史学家们就不会对罗伯斯庇尔感到那么自豪了。正因为他们涉及的那些事不复回归，于是革命那血的年代只不过变成了文字、理论和研讨而已，变得比鸿毛还轻，吓不了谁。这个在历史上只出现一次的罗伯斯庇尔与那个永劫回归的罗伯斯庇尔绝不相同，后者还会砍下法兰西万颗头颅。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Let us therefore agree that the idea of eternal return implies a perspective from which things appear other than as we know them: they appear without the mitigating circumstance of their transitory nature. This mitigating circumstance prevents us from coming to a verdict. For how can we condemn something that is ephemeral, in transit? In the sunset of dissolution, everything is illuminated by the aura of nostalgia, even the guillotine.</p><p>于是，让我们承认吧，这种永劫回归观隐含有一种视角，它使我们所知的事物看起来是另一回事，看起来失去了事物瞬时性所带来的缓解环境，而这种缓解环境能使我们难于定论。我们怎么能去谴责那些转瞬即逝的事物呢？昭示洞察它们的太阳沉落了，人们只能凭借回想的依稀微光来辩释一切，包括断头台。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Not long ago, I caught myself experiencing a most incredible sensation. Leafing through a book on Hitler, I was touched by some of his portraits: they reminded me of my childhood. I grew up during the war; several members of my family perished in Hitler's concentration camps; but what were their deaths compared with the memories of a lost period in my life, a period that would never return?</p><p>不久前，我察觉自己体验了一种极其难以置信的感觉。我翻阅一本关于希特勒的书，被他的一些照片所触动，从而想起了自己的童年。我成长在战争中，好几位亲人死于希特勒的集中营；我生命中这一段失落的时光已不复回归了。但比较于我对这一段时光的回忆，他们的死算是怎么回事呢？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>This reconciliation with Hitler reveals the profound moral perversity of a world that rests essentially on the nonexistence of return, for in this world everything is pardoned in advance and therefore everything cynically permitted.</p><p>对希特勒的仇恨终于淡薄消解，这暴露了一个世界道德上深刻的堕落。这个世界赖以立足的基本点，是回归的不存在。因为在这个世界里，一切都预先被原谅了，一切皆可笑地被允许了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>2</p><p>2</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>If every second of our lives recurs an infinite number of times, we are nailed to eternity as Jesus Christ was nailed to the cross. It is a terrifying prospect. In the world of eternal return the weight of unbearable responsibility lies heavy on every move we make. That is why Nietzsche called the idea of eternal return the heaviest of burdens (das schwerste Gewicht).</p><p>如果我们生命的每一秒钟都有无数次的重复，我们就会象耶稣钉于十字架，被钉死在永恒上。这个前景是可怕的。在那永劫回归的世界里，无法承受的责任重荷，沉沉压着我们的每一个行动，这就是尼采说永劫回归观是最沉重的负担的原因吧。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>If eternal return is the heaviest of burdens, then our lives can stand out against it in all their splendid lightness.</p><p>如果永劫回归是最沉重的负担，那么我们的生活就能以其全部辉煌的轻松，来与之抗衡。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But is heaviness truly deplorable and lightness splendid?</p><p>可是，沉重便真的悲惨，而轻松便真的辉煌吗？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The heaviest of burdens crushes us, we sink beneath it, it pins us to the ground. But in the love poetry of every age, the woman longs to be weighed down by the man's body. The heaviest of burdens is therefore simultaneously an image of life's most intense fulfillment. The heavier the burden, the closer our lives come to the earth, the more real and truthful they become.</p><p>最沉重的负担压得我们崩塌了，沉没了，将我们钉在地上。可是在每一个时代的爱情诗篇里，女人总渴望压在男人的身躯之下。也许最沉重的负担同时也是一种生活最为充实的象征，负担越沉，我们的生活也就越贴近大地，越趋近真切和实在。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Conversely, the absolute absence of a burden causes man to be lighter than air, to soar into the heights, take leave of the earth and his earthly being, and become only half real, his movements as free as they are insignificant.</p><p>相反，完全没有负担，人变得比大气还轻，会高高地飞起，离别大地亦即离别真实的生活。他将变得似真非真，运动自由而毫无意义。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>What then shall we choose? Weight or lightness?</p><p>那么我们将选择什么呢？沉重还是轻松？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Parmenides posed this very question in the sixth century before Christ. He saw the world divided into pairs of opposites:</p><p>巴门尼德于公元前六世纪正式提出了这一问题。她看到世界分成对立的两半：</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>light/darkness, fineness/coarseness, warmth/cold, being/non-being. One half of the opposition he called positive (light, fineness, warmth, being), the other negative. We might find this division into positive and negative poles childishly simple except for one difficulty: which one is positive, weight or lightness?</p><p>光明、黑暗；优雅、粗俗；温暖、寒冷；存在、非存在。他把其中一半称为积极的（光明；优雅，温暖，存在），另一半自然是消极的。我们可以发现这种积极与消极的两极区分实在幼稚简单，至少有一点难以确定：哪一方是积极？沉重呢？还是轻松？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Parmenides responded: lightness is positive, weight negative.</p><p>巴门尼德回答：轻为积极，重为消极。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Was he correct or not? That is the question. The only certainty is: the lightness/weight opposition is the most mysterious, most ambiguous of all.</p><p>他对吗？这是个疑问。唯一可以确定的是：轻、重的对立最神秘，也最模棱两难。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>3</p><p>3</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I have been thinking about Tomas for many years. But only in the light of these reflections did I see him clearly. I saw him standing at the window of his flat and looking across the courtyard at the opposite walls, not knowing what to do.</p><p>多少年来，我一直想着托马斯，似乎只有凭借回想的折光，我才能看清他这个人。我看见他站在公寓的窗台前不知所措，越过庭院的目光，落在对面的墙上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He had first met Tereza about three weeks earlier in a small Czech town. They had spent scarcely an hour together. She had accompanied him to the station and waited with him until he boarded the train. Ten days later she paid him a visit. They made love the day she arrived. That night she came down with a fever and stayed a whole week in his flat with the flu.</p><p>他与特丽莎初识于三个星期前捷克的一个小镇上，两入呆在一起还不到一个钟头，她就陪他去了车站，一直等到他上火车；十天后她去看他，而且两人当天便做爱。不料夜里她发起烧来，是流感，她在他的公寓里呆了十个星期。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He had come to feel an inexplicable love for this all but complete stranger; she seemed a child to him, a child someone had put in a bulrush basket daubed with pitch and sent downstream for Tomas to fetch at the riverbank of his bed.</p><p>他慢慢感到了一种莫名其妙的爱，却很不习惯。对他来说；她象个孩子；被人放在树脂涂覆的草筐里顺水漂来，而他在床榻之岸顺手捞起了她。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She stayed with him a week, until she was well again, then went back to her town, some hundred and twenty-five miles from Prague. And then came the time I have just spoken of and see as the key to his life: Standing by the window, he looked out over the courtyard at the walls opposite him and deliberated.</p><p>她同他呆在一起直到康复；然后回她离布拉格一百五十英里的镇子上去。现在我们回到了他生活中那个关键时刻，即我刚才谈到的和看到的：他站在窗前，遥望着院子那边的高墙陷入了沉思。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Should he call her back to Prague for good? He feared the responsibility. If he invited her to come, then come she would, and offer him up her life.</p><p>他应该把她叫回布拉格吗？他害怕承担责任。如果他请她来，她会来的，并奉献她的一切。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Or should he refrain from approaching her? Then she would remain a waitress in a hotel restaurant of a provincial town and he would never see her again.</p><p>抑或他应该制止自己对她的亲近之情？那么她将呆在那乡间餐馆当女招待，而他将不再见到她。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Did he want her to come or did he not?</p><p>他到底是要她来，还是不要？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He looked out over the courtyard at the opposite walls, seeking an answer.</p><p>他看着庭院那边的高墙，寻索答案。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He kept recalling her lying on his bed; she reminded him of no one in his former life. She was neither mistress nor wife. She was a child whom he had taken from a bulrush basket that had been daubed with pitch and sent to the riverbank of his bed. She fell asleep. He knelt down next to her. Her feverous breath quickened and she gave out a weak moan. He pressed his face to hers and whispered calming words into her sleep. After a while he felt her breath return to normal and her face rise unconsciously to meet his. He smelled the delicate aroma of her fever and breathed it in, as if trying to glut himself with the intimacy of her body. And all at once he fancied she had been with him for many years and was dying. He had a sudden clear feeling that he would not survive her death. He would lie down beside her and want to die with her. He pressed his face into the pillow beside her head and kept it there for a long time.</p><p>他不断回想起那位躺在床上；使他忘记了以前生活中任何人的她。她既非情人，亦非妻子，她是一个被放在树腊涂覆的草筐里的孩子，顺水漂来他的床榻之岸。她睡着了。他跪在她的床边，见她烧得呼吸急促，微微呻吟。他用脸贴往她的脸，轻声安慰她，直到她睡着。一会儿，他觉得她呼吸正常了，脸庞无意识地轻轻起伏，间或触着他的脸。他闻到了她高热散发的一种气息，吸着它，如同自己吞饮着对方身体的爱欲。刹那间，他又幻想着自己与她在一起已有漫漫岁月，而现在她正行将死去。他突然清楚地意识到自己不能死在她之后，得躺在她身边，与她一同赴死。他挨着她的头，把脸埋在枕头里过了许久。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Now he was standing at the window trying to call that moment to account. What could it have been if not love declaring itself to him?</p><p>现在他站在窗前，极力回想那一刻的情景。那不是因为爱情，又是因为什么呢？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But was it love? The feeling of wanting to die beside her was clearly exaggerated: he had seen her only once before in his life! Was it simply the hysteria of a man who, aware deep down of his inaptitude for love, felt the self-deluding need to simulate it? His unconscious was so cowardly that the best partner it could choose for its little comedy was this miserable provincial waitress with practically no chance at all to enter his life!</p><p>是爱吗？那种想死在她身边的情感显然有些夸张：在这以前他仅仅见了她一面！那么，明明知道这种爱不甚适当，难道这只是一个歇斯底里的男人感到自欺之需而作出的伪举吗？他的无意识是如此懦弱，一个小小的玩笑就使他选择了这样一个毫无机缘的可怜的乡间女招待，竟然作为他的最佳伴侣，进入了生活！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Looking out over the courtyard at the dirty walls, he realized he had no idea whether it was hysteria or love.</p><p>他望着外面院子那边的脏墙，知道自己无法回答那一切究竟是出于疯，还是爱。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And he was distressed that in a situation where a real man would instantly have known how to act, he was vacillating and therefore depriving the most beautiful moments he had ever experienced (kneeling at her bed and thinking he would not survive her death) of their meaning. </p><p>更使他悲伤的是，真正的男子汉通常能果敢行动的时刻，他总是犹豫不决，以至他经历过的一个个美妙瞬间（比如说跪在她床上，想着不能让她先死的瞬间），由此而丧失全部意义。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He remained annoyed with himself until he realized that not knowing what he wanted was actually quite natural.</p><p>他生着自己的气，直到他弄明白自己的茫然无措其实也很自然。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>We can never know what to want, because, living only one life, we can neither compare it with our previous lives nor perfect it in our lives to come.</p><p>他再也无法明白自己要什么。因为人的生命只有一次，我们既不能把它与我们以前的生活相此较，也无法使其完美之后再来度过。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Was it better to be with Tereza or to remain alone?</p><p>与特丽莎结合或独居，哪个更好呢？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>There is no means of testing which decision is better, because there is no basis for comparison. We live everything as it comes, without warning, like an actor going on cold. And what can life be worth if the first rehearsal for life is life itself? That is why life is always like a sketch. No, "sketch" is not quite the word, because a sketch is an outline of something, the groundwork for a picture, whereas the sketch that is our life is a sketch for nothing, an outline with no picture.</p><p>没有比较的基点，因此没有任何办法可以检验何种选择更好。我们经历着生活中突然临头的一切，毫无防备，就象演员进入初排。如果生活的第一排练便是生活本身，那生活有什么价值呢？这就是为什么生活总象一张草图的原因。不，“草图”还不是最确切的词，因为草图是某件事物的轮廓，是一幅图画的基础，而我们所说的生活是一张没有什么目的的草图，最终也不会成为一幅图画。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Einmal ist keinmal", says Tomas to himself. What happens but once, says the German adage, might as well not have happened at all. If we have only one life to live,we might as well not have lived at all.</p><p>“Einmal ist keinmal”托马斯自言自语。这句德国谚语说，只发生过一次的事就象压根儿没有发生过。如果生命属于我们只有一次，我们当然也可以说根本没有过生命。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>4</p><p>4</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But then one day at the hospital, during a break between operations, a nurse called him to the telephone. He heard Tereza's voice coming from the receiver. She had phoned him from the railway station. He was overjoyed. Unfortunately, he had something on that evening and could not invite her to his place until the next day. The moment he hung up, he reproached himself for not telling her to go straight there. He had time enough to cancel his plans, after all! He tried to imagine what Tereza would do in Prague during the thirty-six long hours before they were to meet, and had half a mind to jump into his car and drive through the streets looking for her.</p><p>可后来有二天在医院里，托马斯正在手术间休息，护士告诉他有电话。他听到话筒里传来特丽莎的声音。电话是从车站打来的。他格外高兴，不幸的是他那天夜里有事，要到第二天才能请她上他家去。放下电话，他便责备自己没有叫她直接去他家，他毕竟有足够的时间来取消自已原来的计划！他努力想象在他们见面前的三十六小时里特丽莎会在布拉格做些什么，然而来不及想清楚他便跳进汽车驱车上街去找她。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She arrived the next evening, a handbag dangling from her shoulder, looking more elegant than before. She had a thick book under her arm. It was Anna Karenina. She seemed in a good mood, even a little boisterous, and tried to make him think she had just happened to drop in, things had just worked out that way: she was in Prague on business, perhaps (at this point she became rather vague) to find a job.</p><p>第二天夜里，她来了，肩上挂着个提包：看来比以前更加优雅，腋下还夹了本厚厚的《安娜·卡列尼娜》；她看来情绪不错，甚至有点兴高采烈；努力想使他相信她只是碰巧路过这里，她来布拉格有点事，也许是找工作（她这一点讲得很含糊）。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Later, as they lay naked and spent side by side on the bed, he asked her where she was staying. It was night by then, and he offered to drive her there. Embarrassed, she answered that she still had to find a hotel and had left her suitcase at the station.</p><p>后来，他们裸着身子并排躺在床上时，他问她住在哪。天已晚了，他想用车送她回去。她有点不好意思；说她的行李箱还寄存在车站，她得去找一个旅馆。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Only two days ago, he had feared that if he invited her to Prague she would offer him up her life. When she told him her suitcase was at the station, he immediately realized that the suitcase contained her life and that she had left it at the station only until she could offer it up to him.</p><p>两天前他还担心，如果他请她来布拉格，她将奉献一切。当她告诉他箱子存在车站时，他立刻意识到她的生活就留在那只箱子里，在她能够奉献之前，它会一直被存放在车站的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The two of them got into his car, which was parked in front of the house, and drove to the station. There he claimed the suitcase (it was large and enormously heavy) and took it and her home.</p><p>他俩钻入停放在房前的汽车，直奔车站。他领了箱子（那家伙又大又沉），带着它和她回家。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>How had he come to make such a sudden decision when for nearly a fortnight he had wavered so much that he could not even bring himself to send a postcard asking her how she was?</p><p>两个星期以来他总是犹豫；甚至未能说服自已去寄一张向她问好的明信片，而现在怎么会突然作出这个决定？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He himself was surprised. He had acted against his principles. Ten years earlier, when he had divorced his wife, he celebrated the event the way others celebrate a marriage. He understood he was not born to live side by side with any woman and could be fully himself only as a bachelor. He tried to design his life in such a way that no woman could move in with a suitcase. That was why his flat had only the one bed. Even though it was wide enough, Tomas would tell his mistresses that he was unable to fall asleep with anyone next to him, and drive them home after midnight. And so it was not the flu that kept him from sleeping with Tereza on her first visit. The first night he had slept in his large armchair, and the rest of that week he drove each night to the hospital, where he had a cot in his office.</p><p>他自己也暗暗吃惊。他在向自己的原则挑战。十年前，与妻子离婚，他象别人庆贺订婚一样高兴。他明白自已天生就不能与任何女人朝夕相处，是个十足的单身汉胚子。他要尽力为自已创造一种没有任何女人提着箱子走进来的生活。那就是他的房里只有一张床的原因.尽管那张床很大，托马斯还是告诉他的情人们，只要有外人在身边他就不能入睡，半夜之后都得用车把她们送回去。自然，特丽莎第一次来的时候，并不是她的流感搅了他的睡眠。那一夜他睡在一张大圈椅上，其它几天则开车去医院，他的办公室里有一张病床。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But this time he fell asleep by her side. When he woke up the next morning, he found Tereza, who was still asleep, holding his hand. Could they have been hand in hand all night? It was hard to believe.</p><p>可这一次，他在她的身边睡着了。第二天早上醒来，发现她还握住他的手睡着。真是难以相信，他们整夜都这样手拉着手的吗？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And while she breathed the deep breath of sleep and held his hand (firmly: he was unable to disengage it from her grip), the enormously heavy suitcase stood by the bed. He refrained from loosening his hand from her grip for fear of waking her, and turned carefully on his side to observe her better.</p><p>她在熟睡中深深地呼吸，紧紧地攥紧着他的手（紧得他无法解脱）。笨重的箱子便立在床边。他怕把她弄醒，忍着没把手抽回来，小心翼翼地翻了一个身，以便好好地看她。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Again it occurred to him that Tereza was a child put in a pitch-daubed bulrush basket and sent downstream. He couldn't very well let a basket with a child in it float down a stormy river! If the Pharaoh's daughter hadn't snatched the basket carrying little Moses from the waves, there would have been no Old Testament, no civilization as we now know it! How many ancient myths begin with the rescue of an abandoned child! If Polybus hadn't taken in the young Oedipus, Sophocles wouldn't have written his most beautiful tragedy!</p><p>他又一次感到特丽莎是个被放在树脂涂覆的草篮里顺水漂来的孩子。他怎么能让这个装着孩子的草篮顺流漂向狂暴汹涌的江涛？如果法老的女儿没有抓任那只载有小摩西逃离波浪的筐子，世上就不会有《旧约全书》，不会有我们今天所知的文明。多少古老的神话都始于营救一个弃儿的故事！如果波里布斯没有收养小俄狄浦斯，索福克勒斯也就写不出他最美的悲剧了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Tomas did not realize at the time that metaphors are dangerous. Metaphors are not to be trifled with. A single metaphor can give birth to love.</p><p>托马斯当时还没认识到，比喻是危脸的，比喻可不能拿来闹着玩。一个比喻就能播下爱的种子。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>5</p><p>5</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He lived a scant two years with his wife, and they had a son. At the divorce proceedings, the judge awarded the infant to its mother and ordered Tomas to pay a third of his salary for its support. He also granted him the right to visit the boy every other week.</p><p>他和他妻子共同生活不到两年，生了一个孩子。离婚时法官把孩子判给了母亲，并让托马斯交出三分之一的薪水作为抚养费，同意他隔一周看望一次孩子。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But each time Tomas was supposed to see him, the boy's mother found an excuse to keep him away. He soon realized that bringing them expensive gifts would make things a good deal easier, that he was expected to bribe the mother for the son's love. He saw a future of quixotic attempts to inculcate his views in the boy, views opposed in every way to the mother's. The very thought of it exhausted him. When, one Sunday, the boy's mother again canceled a scheduled visit, Tomas decided on the spur of the moment never to see him again.</p><p>每次托马斯去看孩子，孩子的母亲总是以种种借口拒之于门外。他很快明白了，为了儿子的爱，他得贿赂母亲。多送点昂贵的礼物，事情才可通融。他知道自己的思想没有一处不与那婆娘格格不入，试图对孩子施加影响也不过是堂·吉诃德式的幻想。这当然使他泄气。又一个星期天，孩子的母亲再次取消他对孩子的看望，托马斯一时冲动就决定以后再也不去了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Why should he feel more for that child, to whom he was bound by nothing but a single improvident night, than for any other? He would be scrupulous about paying support; he just didn't want anybody making him fight for his son in the name of paternal sentiments!</p><p>为什么他对这个孩子比对其他孩子要有感情得多？他与他，除了那个不顾后果的夜晚之外没有任何联系。他一文不差地付给抚养费，但不愿有舔犊似的多情去与别人争夺孩子。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Needless to say, he found no sympathizers. His own parents condemned him roundly: if Tomas refused to take an interest in his son, then they, Tomas's parents, would no longer take an interest in theirs. They made a great show of maintaining good relations with their daughter-in-law and trumpeted their exemplary stance and sense of justice.</p><p>不必说，没人同情他，父母都恶狠狠地谴责他：如果托马斯对自己的儿子不感兴趣，他们也再不会对自己的儿子感兴趣。他们极力表现自己与媳妇的友好关系，吹嘘自己的模范姿态与正义感。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Thus in practically no time he managed to rid himself of wife, son, mother, and father. The only thing they bequeathed to him was a fear of women. Tomas desired but feared them. Needing to create a compromise between fear and desire, he devised what he called "erotic friendship". He would tell his mistresses: the only relationship that can make both partners happy is one in which sentimentality has no place and neither partner makes any claim on the life and freedom of the other.</p><p>事实上，他很快使自己忘记了妻子、儿子以及父母。他们给他留下的唯一东西便是对妇女的恐惧。托马斯渴望女人而又害怕女人。他需要在渴望与害拍之间找到一种调和，便发明出一种所谓“性友谊”。他告诉情人们：唯一能使双方快乐的关系与多愁善感无缘，双方都不要对对方的生活和自由有什么要求。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>To ensure that "erotic friendship" never grew into the aggression of love, he would meet each of his long-term mistresses only at intervals. He considered this method flawless and propagated it among his friends: "The important thing is to abide by the rule of threes. Either you see a woman three times in quick succession and then never again, or you maintain relations over the years but make sure that the rendezvous are at least three weeks apart."</p><p>为了确保“性友谊”不发展成为带侵略性的爱，他与关系长久的情妇们见面，也讲究轮换周期。他自认为这一套无懈可击，曾在朋友中宣传：“重要的是坚持三三原则。就是说，如果你一下子与某位女人连续三次幽会，以后就肯定告吹。要是你打算与某位女人的关系地久天长，那么你们的幽会，每次至少得相隔三周。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The rule of threes" enabled Tomas to keep intact his liaisons with some women while continuing to engage in short-term affairs with many others. He was not always understood. The woman who understood him best was Sabina. She was a painter. The reason I like you, she would say to him:"is you're the complete opposite of kitsch. In the kingdom of kitsch you would be a monster." </p><p>“三三原则”使托马斯既能与一些女人私通，同时又与其他许多娘们儿继续保持短时朗交往。他总是不被理解。对他最理解的算是画家萨宾娜了。她说：“我喜欢你的原因是你毫不媚俗。在媚俗的王国里，你是个魔鬼。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was Sabina he turned to when he needed to find a job for Tereza in Prague. Following the unwritten rules of erotic friendship, Sabina promised to do everything in her power, and before long she had in fact located a place for Tereza in the darkroom of an illustrated weekly. Although her new job did not require any particular qualifications, it raised her status from waitress to member of the press. When Sabina herself introduced Tereza to everyone on the weekly, Tomas knew he had never had a better friend as a mistress than Sabina.</p><p>他需要为特丽莎在布拉格谋一工作时，正是转求于这位萨宾娜。按照不成文的性友谊原则，萨宾娜答应尽力而为，而且不久也真的把特丽莎安插在一家周刊杂志社的暗室里。虽然新的工作不需要任何特殊技能，但特丽莎的地位由女招待升为新闻界成员了。当萨宾娜把特丽莎向周刊杂志社的人一一介绍时，托马斯知道，他从未有比萨宾娜更好的情人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>6</p><p>6</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The unwritten contract of erotic friendship stipulated that Tomas should exclude all love from his life. The moment he violated that clause of the contract, his other mistresses would assume inferior status and become ripe for insurrection.</p><p>不成文的性友谊合同，规定了托马斯一生与爱情无涉。一旦他违反合同条款，地位下降的其他情人就会准备造反。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Accordingly, he rented a room for Tereza and her heavy suitcase. He wanted to be able to watch over her, protect her, enjoy her presence, but felt no need to change his way of life. He did not want word to get out that Tereza was sleeping at his place: spending the night together was the corpus delicti of love.</p><p>他根据条款精神为特丽莎以及她的大箱子租了一间房子。他希望能关照她，保护她，乐于她在身边，但觉得没有必要改变自己的生活方式。他不想让特丽莎睡在他房里的话柄传出去，一起过夜无疑是爱情之罪的事实。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He never spent the night with the others. It was easy enough if he was at their place: he could leave whenever he pleased. It was worse when they were at his and he had to explain that come midnight he would have to drive them home because he was an insomniac and found it impossible to fall asleep in close proximity to another person. Though it was not far from the truth, he never dared tell them the whole truth:</p><p>他从不与其他人一起过夜。如果在情人家里，那太容易了；他爱什么时候走就走。她们在他家里则难办些，他不得不解释自己患有失眠症，与另一个人的亲近会使他无法入睡，这并非全是谎言，只是他不敢告诉她们全都原因：</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>after making love he had an uncontrollable craving to be by himself; waking in the middle of the night at the side of an alien body was distasteful to him, rising in the morning with an intruder repellent; he had no desire to be overheard brushing his teeth in the bathroom, nor was he enticed by the thought of an intimate breakfast.</p><p>做爱之后，他有一种抑制不住的强烈愿望，愿一个人独处。他厌恶半夜在一个陌生的身体旁醒来，讨厌早上与一个外来人共同起床，不愿意别人偷听他在浴室里刷牙，也不愿意为了一顿早餐而任人摆布。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>That is why he was so surprised to wake up and find Tereza squeezing his hand tightly. Lying there looking at her, he could not quite understand what had happened. But as he ran through the previous few hours in his mind, he began to sense an aura of hitherto unknown happiness emanating from them.</p><p>那就是他醒后发现特丽莎紧摄着他的手时如此吃惊的原因。他躺在那儿看着她，不能完全明白发生了什么事。想了想刚才几个小时内的一切，开始觉出某种从中隐隐透出来的莫名快意。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>From that time on they both looked forward to sleeping together. I might even say that the goal of their lovemaking was not so much pleasure as the sleep that followed it. She especially was affected. Whenever she stayed overnight in her rented room (which quickly became only an alibi for Tomas), she was unable to fall asleep; in his arms she would fall asleep no matter how wrought up she might have been. He would whisper impromptu fairy tales about her, or gibberish, words he repeated monotonously, words soothing or comical, which turned into vague visions lulling her through the first dreams of the night. He had complete control over her sleep: she dozed off at the second he chose.</p><p>那以后，他们俩都盼着一起睡觉。我甚至要说，他们做爱远远不具有事后睡在一起时的愉悦。她尤为感奋，每次在租下的那间房子过夜（那房子很快成为托马斯遮入耳目的幌子），都不能入睡；而只要在他的怀抱里，无论有多兴奋，她都睡得着。他总是轻声地顺口编一些有关她的神话故事，或者说一些莫名其妙的话，单调重复，却甜蜜而滑稽，蒙蒙胧胧地把她带入了梦乡。他完全控制了她的睡眠：要她在哪一刻睡觉，她便开始打盹。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>While they slept, she held him as on the first night, keeping a firm grip on wrist, finger, or ankle. If he wanted to move without waking her, he had to resort to artifice. After freeing his finger (wrist, ankle) from her clutches, a process which, since she guarded him carefully even in her sleep, never failed to rouse her partially, he would calm her by slipping an object into her hand (a rolled-up pajama top, a slipper, a book), which she then gripped as tightly as if it were a part of his body.</p><p>睡觉的时候，她象第一夜那样抓着他，紧紧攥住他的手腕、手指或踝骨。如果他想翻身又不弄醒她，就得用点心思，对付她哪怕熟睡时也未松懈的戒备。他从对方手中把手指（或手腕之类）成功地轻轻抽出，再把一件东西塞进她手中（卷成一团的睡衣裤，一只拖鞋，一本书），以使她安宁。而她抓住这些东西也就象抓住了他身体的一部分，紧紧不放。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Once, when he had just lulled her to sleep but she had gone no farther than dream's antechamber and was therefore still responsive to him, he said to her, "Good-bye, I'm going now." "Where? she asked in her sleep." "Away," he answered sternly. "Then I'm going with you," she said, sitting up in bed. "No, you can't. I'm going away for good," he said, going out into the hall. She stood up and followed him out, squinting. She was naked beneath her short nightdress. Her face was blank, expressionless, but she moved energetically. He walked through the hall of the flat into the hall of the building (the hall shared by all the occupants), closing the door in her face. She flung it open and continued to follow him, convinced in her sleep that he meant to leave her for good and she had to stop him. He walked down the stairs to the first landing and waited for her there. She went down after him, took him by the hand, and led him back to bed.</p><p>一次，她刚刚被哄入睡了，还没有完全入梦，对他仍有所感觉。他说：“再见，我走了。”“去哪？”她迷迷糊糊地问。“别的地方。”他坚决地说。“那我跟你走。”她猛地坐在床上了。“不，你不能走，我得永远离开这里。”他说着已走到前厅。她站起来，跟着出门，一直盯着他，短睡裙里是她赤裸的身子，脸上茫茫然没有表情，行动却坚决有力。他穿过门厅走进公用厅房，当着她的面关上了门。她呼地把门打开，还是继续跟着。她在睡意中确信托马斯的意思是要永远离开她，她非拦住不可。终于，他下楼后在一层楼的拐弯处等她。她跟着下去，手拉手将他带回床边。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Tomas came to this conclusion: Making love with a woman and sleeping with a woman are two separate passions, not merely different but opposite. Love does not make itself felt in the desire for copulation (a desire that extends to an infinite number of women) but in the desire for shared sleep (a desire limited to one woman).</p><p>托马斯得出结论：同女人做爱和同女人睡觉是两种互不相关的感情，岂止不同，简直对立。爱情不会使人产生性交的欲望（即对无数女人的激望），却会引起同眠共寝的欲求（只限于对一个女人的欲求）。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>7</p><p>7</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In the middle of the night she started moaning in her sleep. Tomas woke her up, but when she saw his face she said, with hatred in her voice:"Get away from me! Get away from me!" Then she told him her dream: The two of them and Sabina had been in a big room together. There was a bed in the middle of the room. It was like a platform in the theater. Tomas ordered her to stand in the corner while he made love to Sabina. The sight of it caused Tereza intolerable suffering. Hoping to alleviate the pain in her heart by pains of the flesh, she jabbed needles under her fingernails. "It hurt so much," she said, squeezing her hands into fists as if they actually were wounded.</p><p>半夜里，她开始在睡梦中呻吟。托马斯叫醒她。她看见他的脸，恨恨地说：“走开！走开！”好一阵，她才给他讲起自己的梦：他们俩与萨宾娜在一间大屋子里，房子中间有一张床，象剧院里的舞台。托马斯与萨宾娜做爱，却命令她站在角落里。那场景使特丽莎痛苦不堪，极盼望能用肉体之苦来取代心灵之苦。她用针刺入自己的片片指甲，“好痛哩！”她把手紧紧捏成拳头，似乎真的受了伤。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He pressed her to him, and she gradually (trembling violently for a long time) fell asleep in his arms.</p><p>他把她拉在怀里，她身体颤抖了许久许久，才在他怀里睡着。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Thinking about the dream the next day, he remembered something. He opened a desk drawer and took out a packet of letters Sabina had written to him. He was not long in finding the following passage: I want to make love to you in my studio. It will be like a stage surrounded by people. The audience won't be allowed up close, but they won't be able to take their eyes off us.... </p><p>第二天，托马斯想着这个梦，记起了一样东西。他打开拍屉取出一捆萨宾娜的来信，很快找到那一段：我想与你在我的画室里做爱，那儿象一个围满了人群的舞台，观众们不许靠近我们，但他们不得不注视着我们……</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The worst of it was that the letter was dated. It was quite recent, written long after Tereza had moved in with Tomas.</p><p>最糟糕的是那封信落有日期，是新近写的，就在特丽莎搬到这里来以后没多久。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"So you've been rummaging in my letters! "</p><p>“你搜查过我的信件？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She did not deny it. "Throw me out, then! "</p><p>她没有否认：“把我赶走吧！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But he did not throw her out. He could picture her pressed against the wall of Sabina's studio jabbing needles up under her nails. He took her fingers between his hands and stroked them, brought them to his lips and kissed them, as if they still had drops of blood on them.</p><p>但他没有把她赶走。她靠着萨宾娜画室的墙用针刺手指尖的情景，出现在他的眼前。他捧着她的手，抚摸着，带到唇前吻着，似乎那双手还在滴血。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But from that time on, everything seemed to conspire against him. Not a day went by without her learning something about his secret life.</p><p>那以后，一切都象在暗暗与他作对，没有一天她不对他的秘密生活有新的了解。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>At first he denied it all. Then, when the evidence became too blatant, he argued that his polygamous way of life did not in the least run counter to his love for her. He was inconsistent: first he disavowed his infidelities, then he tried to justify them.</p><p>开始他全部否定，后来证据太明显了，他便争辩，一夫多妻式的生活方式丝毫也没有使他托马斯背弃对她的爱。他前后矛盾，先是否认不忠，接着又努力为不忠之举辩护。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Once he was saying good-bye after making a date with a woman on the phone, when from the next room came a strange sound like the chattering of teeth.By chance she had come home without his realizing it. She was pouring something from a medicine bottle down her throat, and her hand shook so badly the glass bottle clicked against her teeth.</p><p>有一次，他在电话里刚与一个女人约好时间后道别，隔壁房里传来一种奇怪的声音，象牙齿打颤。他不知道，她已意外地回家来了，正把什么药水往喉管里倒下去。手抖得厉害，玻璃瓶碰击着牙齿。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He pounced on her as if trying to save her from drowning. The bottle fell to the floor, spotting the carpet with valerian drops. She put up a good fight, and he had to keep her in a straitjacket-like hold for a quarter of an hour before he could calm her.</p><p>他冲过去，象要把即将淹死的她救出来。瓶子掉下去，药溅在地毯上。她死死反抗着，他不得不象对付疯子般地按住她约一刻钟之久，再安抚她。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He knew he was in an unjustifiable situation, based as it was on complete inequality.</p><p>他知道自己处于无法辩解的境地，这样做是完全不平等的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>One evening, before she discovered his correspondence with Sabina, they had gone to a bar with some friends to celebrate Tereza's new job. She had been promoted at the weekly from darkroom technician to staff photographer. Because he had never been much for dancing, one of his younger colleagues took over. They made a splendid couple on the dance floor, and Tomas found her more beautiful than ever. </p><p>特丽莎还没有发现萨宾娜的信以前，有天晚上他们与几个朋友去酒吧庆贺特丽莎获得新的工作。她已经在杂志社里由暗房技工提升为摄影师。托马斯很少跳舞，因此他的一位年轻同事便替他陪特丽莎。他们在舞池里真是绝妙的一对。托马斯惊讶地看着特丽莎，两人每一瞬间的动作都极其精确而默契，还发现她比平时漂亮得多。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He looked on in amazement at the split-second precision and deference with which Tereza anticipated her partner's will. The dance seemed to him a declaration that her devotion, her ardent desire to satisfy his every whim, was not necessarily bound to his person, that if she hadn't met Tomas, she would have been ready to respond to the call of any other man she might have met instead. He had no difficulty imagining Tereza and his young colleague as lovers. And the ease with which he arrived at this fiction wounded him. He realized that Tereza's body was perfectly thinkable coupled with any male body, and the thought put him in a foul mood. Not until late that night, at home, did he admit to her he was jealous.</p><p>这次跳舞看来是对他的宣告：她的忠诚，她希望满足他每一欲求的热烈愿望，并不是非属于他一个人不可。如果她没有遇见托马斯，她随时都准备响应任何她可能遇见的男人的召唤。他不难把特丽莎与他的年轻同事想象成情人，很容易进入这种伤害自己的想象。他认识到特丽莎的身体完全可以与任何男性身体交合，这想法使他心境糟糕透顶。那天深夜回家后，他向她承认了自己的嫉妒。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>This absurd jealousy, grounded as it was in mere hypotheses, proved that he considered her fidelity an unconditional postulate of their relationship. How then could he begrudge her her jealousy of his very real mistresses?</p><p>这种荒诞的、仅仅建立在一种假想上的嫉妒，证明他视她的忠诚为彼此交情的必要条件。那么，他又怎么能去抱怨她对自己真正的情人有所嫉妒呢？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>8</p><p>8</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>During the day, she tried (though with only partial success) to believe what Tomas told her and to be as cheerful as she had been before. But her jealousy thus tamed by day burst forth all the more savagely in her dreams, each of which ended in a wail he could silence only by waking her.</p><p>这天，她努力去相信托马斯的话（尽管只是半信半疑），努力使自己和平常一样快活。可白天平复了的妒意在她的睡梦中却爆发得更加厉害，而且梦的终结都是恸哭。他只能一声不吭地把她弄醒。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Her dreams recurred like themes and variations or television series. For example, she repeatedly dreamed of cats jumping at her face and digging their claws into her skin. We need not look far for an interpretation: in Czech slang the word "cat" means a pretty woman. Tereza saw herself threatened by women, all women. All women were potential mistresses for Tomas, and she feared them all.</p><p>她的梦，重现如音乐主题，舞蹈重复动作，或电视连续剧。比如，她一次又一次梦见猫儿跳到她脸上，抓她的面皮。此中的含义我们不难译解：在捷克土语中，“猫”这个宇就意味着漂亮女人。特丽莎看见女人，不，所有的女人都在威胁自己，她们都是托马斯潜在的情妇，她害怕她们每个人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In another cycle she was being sent to her death. Once, when he woke her as she screamed in terror in the dead of night, she told him about it. "I was at a large indoor swimming pool. There were about twenty of us. All women. We were naked and had to march around the pool. There was a basket hanging from the ceiling and a man standing in the basket. The man wore a broad-brimmed hat shading his face, but I could see it was you. You kept giving us orders. Shouting at us. We had to sing as we marched, sing and do kneebends. If one of us did a bad kneebend, you would shoot her with a pistol and she would fall dead into the pool. Which made everybody laugh and sing even louder. You never took your eyes off us, and the minute we did something wrong, you would shoot. The pool was full of corpses floating just below the surface. And I knew I lacked the strength to do the next kneebend and you were going to shoot me!"</p><p>在另一轮梦里，她总是被推向死亡。一次，她在死亡的暗夜里吓得尖叫起来，被他晚醒，便给他讲了这个梦：“有一个很大的室内游泳池，我们有大约二十个人，都是女人，都光着身子，被逼迫着绕池行走。房顶上接着一个篮子，里面站着个男人，戴了顶宽边帽子，遮着脸。我可看清了，那就是你。你不停地指手划脚，冲着我们叫。我们边走还得边唱歌，边唱还得边下跪。要是有谁跪得不好，你就用手枪朝她射击。她就会倒在水里死去。这样，大家只得唱得更响也笑得更响。你目不转睛地盯着我们，一发现岔子就开枪。池里漂满了死人。我知道我再也没有力气下跪了，这一次，你就会向我开枪了！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In a third cycle she was dead.</p><p>在第三轮梦中，她死了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>bying in a hearse as big as a furniture van, she was surrounded by dead women. There were so many of them that the back door would not close and several legs dangled out.</p><p>她躺在一个象家具搬运车一般大的灵柩车里，身边都是死了的女人。她们人太多，使得车后门都无法关上，几条腿悬在车外。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But I'm not dead! Tereza cried." I can still feel! </p><p>“我没有死！”特丽莎叫道“我还有感觉！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"So can we," the corpses laughed.</p><p>“我们也有。”那些死人笑了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They laughed the same laugh as the live women who used to tell her cheerfully it was perfectly normal that one day she would have bad teeth, faulty ovaries, and wrinkles, because they all had bad teeth, faulty ovaries, and wrinkles. Laughing the same laugh, they told her that she was dead and it was perfectly all right!</p><p>她们笑着，使特丽莎想起了一些活人的笑。那些活着的女人过去常常告诉她，她总有一天也会牙齿脱落，卵巢萎缩，脸生皱纹，这是完全正常的，她们早已这样啦。正是以这种开心的大笑，她们对她说，她死了，千真万确。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Suddenly she felt a need to urinate. "You see," she cried. "I need to pee. That's proof positive I'm not dead! "</p><p>突然她感到内急，叫道：“你看，我要撒尿了，这证明我没死！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But they only laughed again. "Needing to pee is perfectly normal!" they said." You'll go on feeling that kind of thing for a long time yet. Like a person who has an arm cut off and keeps feeling it's there. We may not have a drop of pee left in us, but we keep needing to pee. "</p><p>可她们只是又笑开来：“要撒尿也完全正常！”她们说：“好久好久，你还会有这种感觉的。砍掉了手臂的人，也会总觉得手臂还在那里哩。我们实在已没有一滴尿了，可总会觉得要撒。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Tereza huddled against Tomas in bed. "And the way they talked to me! Like old friends, people who'd known me forever. I was appalled at the thought of having to stay with them forever. "</p><p>特丽莎在床上靠着托马斯缩成一团：“她们用那种神气跟我说话，象老朋友，象永远是我的熟人。一想到永远和她们呆在一起，我就害怕。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'><p>All languages that derive from Latin form the word "compassion" by combining the prefix meaning with (corn-) and the root meaning suffering (Late Latin, passio). In other languages—Czech, Polish, German, and Swedish, for instance— this word is translated by a noun formed of an equivalent prefix combined with the word that means "feeling" (Czech, sou-cit; Polish, wspol-czucie; German, Mit-gefuhl; Swedish, med-kansia).</p><p>所有从拉丁文派生出来的语言里，“同情”一词，都是由一个意为“共同”的前缀（Com）和一个意为“苦难”的词根（pasSio）结合组成（共——苦）。而在其它语言中，象捷文、波兰文、德文与瑞典文中，这个词是由一个相类似的前缀和一个意为“感情”的词根组合而成（同——感）。比如捷文，son—cit；波兰文，wSp'ox—Czucies德文，mit—gefUhI；瑞典文，med。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In languages that derive from Latin, "compassion" means: we cannot look on coolly as others suffer; or, we sympathize with those who suffer. Another word with approximately the same meaning, "pity" (French, pitie; Italian, pieta; etc.), connotes a certain condescension towards the sufferer. "To take pity on a woman" means that we are better off than she, that we stoop to her level, lower ourselves. That is why the word "compassion generally inspires suspicion"; it designates what is considered an inferior, second-rate sentiment that has little to do with love. To love someone out of compassion means not really to love.</p><p>从拉丁文派生的“同情（共——苦）”一词的意思是，我们不能看到别人受难而无动于衷；或者我们要给那些受难的人以安慰。另一个近似的词是“可怜”（法文，pitiez意大利文，等等），意味着对受苦难者的一种恩赐态度。“可怜一个女人”，意味着我们比她优越，所以我们要降低自己的身分俯就于她。这就是为什么“同情（共——苦）”这个词总是引起怀疑，它表明其对象是低一等的人，这是一种与爱情不甚相干的二流感情。出于这种同情去爱一个人，意昧着不是真正的爱。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In languages that form the word "compassion" not from the root "suffering" but from the root "feeling", the word is used in approximately the same way, but to contend that it designates a bad or inferior sentiment is difficult. The secret strength of its etymology floods the word with another light and gives it a broader meaning: to have compassion (co-feeling) means not only to be able to live with the other's misfortune but also to feel with him any emotion—joy, anxiety, happiness, pain. This kind of compassion (in the sense of souc/r, wspofczucie, Mitgefuhl, medkansia) therefore signifies the maximal capacity of affective imagination, the art of emotional telepathy. In the hierarchy of sentiments, then, it is supreme.</p><p>而在那些同词根“感情”而非“苦难”组成“同情”一词的语言中，这个词也有近似的用法，但很难说这词表明一种坏或低一级的感情。词源学给这个词暗示了另一种解释，给了它更广泛的含义：有同情心（同——感），意思就是不仅仅能与苦难的人生活在一起，还要去体会他的任何情感——欢乐，焦急，幸福，痛楚。于是乎这种同情表明了一种最强烈的感情想象力和心灵感应力，在感情的等级上，它至高无上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>By revealing to Tomas her dream about jabbing needles under her fingernails, Tereza unwittingly revealed that she had gone through his desk. If Tereza had been any other woman, Tomas would never have spoken to her again. Aware of that, Tereza said to him:"Throw me out!" But instead of throwing her out, he seized her hand and kissed the tips of her fingers, because at that moment he himself felt the pain under her fingernails as surely as if the nerves of her fingers led straight to his own brain.</p><p>在特丽莎向托马斯道出自己针刺手指的梦的同时，她不甚理智地暴露了自己曾搜过对方的抽屉。如果特丽莎是另外一个女人，托马斯再也不会与她说话了。特丽莎明白这一点，说：“把我赶走吧！”与之相反，他抓住了她的手，吻她的指尖。因为那一刻他自己也感到指尖痛，如同她的指尖神经直接连通着他的大脑。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Anyone who has failed to benefit from the Devil's gift of compassion (co-feeling) will condemn Tereza coldly for her deed, because privacy is sacred and drawers containing intimate correspondence are not to be opened. But because compassion was Tomas's fate (or curse), he felt that he himself had knelt before the open desk drawer, unable to tear his eyes from Sabina's letter. He understood Tereza, and not only was he incapable of being angry with her, he loved her all the more.</p><p>隐私是神圣的，装有个人信件的抽屉是不能被打开的。任何不曾得助于同情（同——感）魔力的人，都会冷冷地责备特丽莎的行为。可是，同情是托马斯的命运（或祸根），他觉出自己跪在打开的抽屉前，无法使自己的眼光从萨宾娜的信上移开。他理解特丽莎了，不仅仅是他不能对特丽莎发火，而且更加爱她。</p></div>

<div class='layout'><p>Her gestures grew abrupt and unsteady. Two years had elapsed since she discovered he was unfaithful, and things had grown worse. There was no way out.</p><p>她的仪态越来越惶乱不宁。自从她发现他的不忠以后又过了两年，情况越来越糟，毫无出路。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Was he genuinely incapable of abandoning his erotic friendships? He was. It would have torn him apart. He lacked the strength to control his taste for other women. Besides, he failed to see the need. No one knew better than he how little his exploits threatened Tereza. Why then give them up? He saw no more reason for that than to deny himself soccer matches.</p><p>他真的不能抛弃他的性友谊吗？他能够，可那会使他内心分裂，他无力控制自己不去品味其他女人，也看不出有这种必要。他自己知道得最清楚，他的战绩并没有威胁特丽莎，那么为什么要断绝这种友谊呢？在他眼里，这与克制自己不去踢足球差不多。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But was it still a matter of pleasure? Even as he set out to visit another woman, he found her distasteful and promised himself he would not see her again. He constantly had Tereza's image before his eyes, and the only way he could erase it was by quickly getting drunk. Ever since meeting Tereza, he had been unable to make love to other women without alcohol! But alcohol on his breath was a sure sign to Tereza of infidelity.</p><p>可这事儿仍算一件乐事吗？他去与别的娘们儿幽会，总是发现对方索然寡味，决意再不见她。眼前老浮现出特丽莎的形象，唯一能使自己忘掉她的办法就是很快使自己喝醉。自他遇见特丽莎以来，他不喝醉就无法同其他女人做爱！可他呼出的酒气对特丽莎来说又是他不忠的确证。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He was caught in a trap: even on his way to see them, he found them distasteful, but one day without them and he was back on the phone, eager to make contact.</p><p>他陷入了一个怪圈：去见情妇吧，觉得她们乏味；一天没见，又回头急急地打电话与她们联系。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He still felt most comfortable with Sabina. He knew she was discreet and would not divulge their rendezvous. Her studio greeted him like a memento of his past, his idyllic bachelor past.</p><p>给她最多舒坦的还是萨宾娜。他知道她为人谨慎，不会把他们的幽会向外泄露。她的画室迎接着他，如一件珍贵的旧物，使他联想起过去悠哉游哉的单身汉日子。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Perhaps he himself did not realize how much he had changed: he was now afraid to come home late, because Tereza would be waiting up for him. Then one day Sabina caught him glancing at his watch during intercourse and trying to hasten its conclusion.</p><p>也许他还没有意识到自己有了多大的变化：现在，他害怕回家太迟，因为特丽莎在等她。这一天，他与萨宾娜交合，萨宾娜注意到他瞥了一下手表，想尽快了事。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Afterwards, still naked and lazily walking across the studio, she stopped before an easel with a half-finished painting and watched him sidelong as he threw on his clothes.</p><p>她裸着身子，懒懒地走过画室，在画架上一幅没画完的画前停了下来，斜着眼看他穿衣服。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When he was fully dressed except for one bare foot, he looked around the room, and then got down on all fours to continue the search under a table.</p><p>他穿戴完毕只剩下一只光光的脚，环顾周围，又四肢落地钻到桌子下去继续寻找。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You seem to be turning into the theme of all my paintings, "she said. The meeting of two worlds. A double exposure.

Or, the other way, through a Tristan, always thinking of his Tereza, I see the beautiful, betrayed world of the libertine. </p><p>“看来，你都变成我所有作品的主题了，”她说：“两个世界的拼合，双重曝光。真难相信，穿过浪子托马斯的形体，居然有浪漫情人的面孔。或者这样说吧，从一个老想着特丽莎的特里斯丹的身上，我看到了一个美丽的世界，被浪子贩卖了的世界。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Tomas straightened up and, distractedly, listened to Sabina's words.</p><p>托马斯直起腰来，迷惑不解地听着萨宾娜的话。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What are you looking for?" she asked.</p><p>“你在找什么？”她说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"A sock. "</p><p>“一只袜子。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She searched all over the room with him, and again he got down on all fours to look under the table.</p><p>她和他一起把房子找了个遍，他又一次爬到桌子下面去。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Your sock isn't anywhere to be seen," said Sabina. "You must have come without it. "</p><p>“你的袜子哪儿也找不到了，”萨宾娜说，“你一定来的时候就没有穿。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"How could I have come without it?" cried Tomas, looking at his watch. "I wasn't wearing only one sock when I came, was I?"</p><p>“怎么能不穿袜子来？”托马斯叫道，看看手表，“我会穿着一只袜子到这里来吗？你说？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It's not out of the question. You've been very absent-minded lately. Always rushing somewhere, looking at your watch. It wouldn't surprise me in the least if you forgot to put on a sock. "</p><p>“没错，你近来一直丢三拉四的，总是急匆匆要去什么地方，总是看手表。要是你忘了穿一只袜子什么的，我一点也不惊讶。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He was just about to put his shoe on his bare foot. "It's cold out, "Sabina said. "I'll lend you one of my stockings."</p><p>他把赤脚往鞋里套，萨宾娜又说：“外边凉着哩，我借你一只袜子吧。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She handed him a long, white, fashionable, wide-net stocking.</p><p>她递给他一只白色的时髦宽口长袜。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He knew very well she was getting back at him for glancing at his watch while making love to her. She had hidden his sock somewhere.

He went home wearing a sock on one foot and a wide-net stocking rolled down over his ankle on the other.</p><p>他完全知道，对方瞥见了自已做爱时的看表动作，一定是她把袜子藏在什么地方以作报复。外面的确很冷，他别无选择，只得接受她的赐予，就这样回家去，一只脚穿着短袜，另一只脚套着那只宽口的长袜，袜口直卷到脚踝。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He was in a bind: in his mistresses' eyes, he bore the stigma of his love for Tereza; in Tereza's eyes, the stigma of his exploits with the mistresses.</p><p>他陷入了困境：在情人们眼中，他对特丽莎的爱使他蒙受恶名，而在特丽莎眼中，他与那些情人们的风流韵事，使他蒙受耻辱。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>11</p><p>11</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>To assuage Tereza's sufferings, he married her (they could finally give up the room, which she had not lived in for quite some time) and gave her a puppy.</p><p>为了减轻特丽莎的痛苦，他娶了她，还送给她一只小狗（他们终于退掉了她那间经常空着的房子）。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was born to a Saint Bernard owned by a colleague. The sire was a neighbor's German shepherd. No one wanted the little mongrels, and his colleague was loath to kill them.</p><p>小狗是他某位同事一条圣伯纳德种狗生的，公狗则是邻居的一条德国种牧羊狗。没有人要这些杂种小狗，同事又不愿杀掉它们。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Looking over the puppies, Tomas knew that the ones he rejected would have to die. He felt like the president of the republic standing before four prisoners condemned to death and empowered to pardon only one of them. At last he made his choice: a bitch whose body seemed reminiscent of the German shepherd and whose head belonged to its Saint Bernard mother. He took it home to Tereza, who picked it up and pressed it to her breast. The puppy immediately peed on her blouse.</p><p>托马斯看着这些小狗，知道如果他不要的话，它们只有死。他感到自己就象一个共和国的总统站在四个死囚面前，仅有权利赦免其中一个。最后，他选了一条母狗。狗的体形如德国牧羊公狗，头则属于它的圣伯纳德母亲。他把它带回家交给特丽莎，她把它抱起来贴在胸前，那狗当即撤了她一身尿。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Then they tried to come up with a name for it. Tomas wanted the name to be a clear indication that the dog was Tereza's, and he thought of the book she was clutching under her arm when she arrived unannounced in Prague. He suggested they call the puppy "Tolstoy".</p><p>随后，他们设法给它取个名字。托马斯要让狗名清楚地表明狗的主人是特丽莎。他想到她到布拉格来时腋下夹着那本书，建议让狗名叫“托尔斯泰”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It can't be Tolstoy, "Tereza said. "It's a girl. How about Anna Karenina?" </p><p>“它不能叫托尔斯泰，”特丽莎说，“它是个女孩子，就叫它安娜·卡列尼娜吧，怎么样？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It can't be Anna Karenina," said Tomas. "No woman could possibly have so funny a face. It's much more like Karenin. Yes, Anna's husband. That's just how I've always pictured him." </p><p>“它不能叫安娜·卡列尼娜，”托马斯说，“女人不可能有它那么滑稽的脸，它太象卡列宁，对，安娜的丈夫，正是我经常想象中的样子。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But won't calling her Karenin affect her sexuality? "</p><p>“叫卡列宁不会影响她的性机能吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It is entirely possible," said Tomas, "that a female dog addressed continually by a male name will develop lesbian tendencies." </p><p>“完全可能，”托马斯说，“一条母狗有公狗的名字，被人们叫得多了，可能会发展同性恋趋向。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Strangely enough, Tomas's words came true. Though bitches are usually more affectionate to their masters than to their mistresses, Karenin proved an exception, deciding that he was in love with Tereza. </p><p>太奇怪了，托马斯的话果然言中。虽然母狗们一般更衷情于男主人而不是女主人，但卡列宁是例外，决心与特丽莎相好。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Tomas was grateful to him for it. He would stroke the puppy's head and say, "Well done, Karenin! That's just what I wanted you for. Since I can't cope with her by myself, you must help me." </p><p>托马斯为此而感谢它，总是敲敲那小狗的头：“干得好，卡列宁！我当初要你就为了这个。我不能安顿好她，你可一定得帮我。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But even with Karenin's help Tomas failed to make her happy.</p><p>然而，即便有了卡列宁的帮助，托马斯仍然不能使她快活。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> He became aware of his failure some years later, on approximately the tenth day after his country was occupied by Russian tanks. </p><p>他意识到自己的失败是几年之后，大约在俄国坦克攻占他的祖国后的第十天。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was August 1968, and Tomas was receiving daily phone calls from a hospital in Zurich. The director there, a physician who had struck up a friendship with Tomas at an international conference, was worried about him and kept offering him a job.</p><p>这是1968中8月，托马斯接到白天从苏黎世一所医院打来的电话。对方是一位院长，一位内科大夫，在一次国际性的会议上曾与托马斯结下了友谊。他为托马斯担心，坚持让他去那儿工作。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>12</p><p>12</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>If Tomas rejected the Swiss doctor's offer without a second thought, it was for Tereza's sake. </p><p>因为特丽莎的缘故，托马斯想也没想便谢绝了瑞士那位院长的邀请。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He assumed she would not want to leave. She had spent the whole first week of the occupation in a kind of trance almost resembling happiness. After roaming the streets with her camera, she would hand the rolls of film to foreign journalists, who actually fought over them. </p><p>他估计她不会愿意离开这儿。在占领的头一周里，她沉浸在一种类似快乐的状态之中，带着照相机在街上转游，然后把一些胶卷交给外国记者们，事实上是记者们抢着要。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Once, when she went too far and took a close-up of an officer pointing his revolver at a group of people, she was arrested and kept overnight at Russian military headquarters. There they threatened to shoot her, but no sooner did they let her go than she was back in the streets with her camera.</p><p>有一次，她做得太过火，竟然给一位俄国军官来了一个近镜头：冲着一群老百姓举起左轮手枪。她被捕了，在占领军指挥部里过了一夜。他们还威胁着要枪毙她。可他们刚一放走她，她又带着照相机回到了大街上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>That is why Tomas was surprised when on the tenth day of the occupation she said to him, "Why is it you don't want to go to Switzerland?"               '</p><p>正因为如此，占领后的第十天，托马斯对她的回答感到惊讶。当时她说：“你为什么不想去瑞士？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why should I?" </p><p>“我为什么要去？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"They could make it hard for you here." </p><p>“他们会给你吃苦头的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"They can make it hard for anybody," replied Tomas with a wave of the hand. </p><p>“他们会给每个人吃苦头，”托马斯挥了挥手。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What about you? Could you live abroad?" </p><p>“你呢？你能住在国外吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why not?" </p><p>“为什么不能？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You've been out there risking your life for this country. How can you be so nonchalant about leaving it?" </p><p>“你一直在外面冒死救国，这会儿说到离开，又这样无所谓？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Now that Dubcek is back, things have changed," said Tereza.</p><p>“现在杜布切克回来了，情况变了。”特丽莎说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was true: the general euphoria lasted no longer than the first week. The representatives of the country had been hauled away like criminals by the Russian army, no one knew where they were, everyone feared for the men's lives, and hatred for the Russians drugged people like alcohol. It was a drunken carnival of hate. Czech towns were decorated with thousands of hand-painted posters bearing ironic texts, epigrams, poems, and cartoons of Brezhnev and his soldiers, jeered at by one and all as a circus of illiterates. But no carnival can go on forever. In the meantime, the Russians had forced the Czech representatives to sign a compromise agreement in Moscow. </p><p>这倒是真的：她的兴奋感只延续了一个星期，那时国家的头面人物象罪犯一样被俄国军队带走了，谁也不知道他们在哪儿，人人都为他们的性命担心。对侵略者的仇恨如酒精醉了大家。这是一种如醉如狂的怨恨。捷克的城镇上贴满了成千上万的大宇报，有讽刺小品，格言，诗歌，以及画片，都冲着勃列日列夫和他的士兵们而来。把他们嘲弄成马戏团的无知小丑。可是没有不散的宴席，就在与此同时，俄国逼迫捷克代表在莫斯科签定了妥协文件。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When Dubcek returned with them to Prague, he gave a speech over the radio. He was so devastated after his six-day detention he could hardly talk; he kept stuttering and gasping for breath, making long pauses between sentences, pauses lasting nearly thirty seconds.</p><p>杜布切克和代表们回到布拉格。他在电台作了演说。六天的监禁生活使他萎靡不堪，简直说不出话来，结结巴巴，不时喘气，讲一句要停老半天，有时长达三十秒钟。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The compromise saved the country from the worst: the executions and mass deportations to Siberia that had terrified everyone. But one thing was clear: the country would have to bow to the conqueror. For ever and ever, it will stutter, stammer, gasp for air like Alexander Dubcek. The carnival was over. Workaday humiliation had begun.</p><p>这个妥协使国家幸免了最糟的结果：即人人惧怕的死刑和大规模地流放西伯利亚。可有一点是清楚的：这个国家不得不向征服者卑躬屈膝，来日方长，它将永远结结巴巴，苟延残喘，如亚力山大.杜布切克。狂欢完了，接下来是日复一日的耻辱。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Tereza had explained all this to Tomas and he knew that it was true. But he also knew that underneath it all hid still another, more fundamental truth, the reason why she wanted to leave Prague: she had never really been happy before.</p><p>特丽莎向托马斯解释了这一切。他知道，这是真的；但他也知道除此之外的另一个原因，亦即她要离开布拉格的真正原因：她以前从未真正感受过快乐。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The days she walked through the streets of Prague taking pictures of Russian soldiers and looking danger in the face were the best of her life. They were the only time when the television series of her dreams had been interrupted and she had enjoyed a few happy nights. The Russians had brought equilibrium to her in their tanks, and now that the carnival was over, she feared her nights again and wanted to escape them. She now knew there were conditions under which she could feel strong and fulfilled, and she longed to go off into the world and seek those conditions somewhere else.</p><p>那些天里，她穿行于布拉格的街道，拍摄侵略军的照片，面对种种危险，这算是她一生中的最佳时刻。只有在这样的时间里，她才享受了少许几个欢乐的夜晚，梦中的电视连续剧才得以中断。俄国人用坦克给她带来了心理平衡。可现在，狂欢过去了，她重新害怕黑夜，希望逃离黑夜。她已经明白，只有在某些条件下，她才能感到自己的强健和充实。她期望浪迹天涯，到别的地方寻找这一些条件。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It doesn't bother you that Sabina has also emigrated to Switzerland?" Tomas asked.</p><p>“萨宾娜已经移居瑞士了，你不在意吧？”托马斯问。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Geneva isn't Zurich," said Tereza. "She'll be much less of a difficulty there than she was in Prague." </p><p>“日内瓦不是苏黎世，”特丽莎说，“她在那儿，困难会比在布拉格少得多。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>A person who longs to leave the place where he lives is an unhappy person. That is why Tomas accepted Tereza's wish to emigrate as the culprit accepts his sentence, and one day he and Tereza and Karenin found themselves in the largest city in Switzerland.</p><p>一个渴望离开热土旧地的人是一个不幸的人。因此托马斯同意了特丽莎移居的要求，就象被告接受了判决。一天，他和特丽莎，还有卡列宁，发现他们已置身于瑞士最大的城市里。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>13</p><p>13</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He bought a bed for their empty flat (they had no money yet for other furniture) and threw himself into his work with the frenzy of a man of forty beginning a new life.</p><p>他为空空的公寓买了一张床（他还没有钱添置其它），并以一个四十岁男人的狂热，全力以赴地投入工作，开始了新生活。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He made several telephone calls to Geneva. A show of Sabina's work had opened there by chance a week after the Russian invasion, and in a wave of sympathy for her tiny country, Geneva's patrons of the arts bought up all her paintings.</p><p>他打了几个电话到日内瓦。俄国入侵一周之后，那里碰巧举办了萨宾娜的作品展览。她在日内瓦的赞助人出于对她弱小祖国的同情，买下了她的全部作品。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Thanks to the Russians, I'm a rich woman," she said, laughing into the telephone. She invited Tomas to come and see her new studio, and assured him it did not differ greatly from the one he had known in Prague.</p><p>“多亏了俄国人，我才成了阔太太。”她说着，在电话里笑起来。她请托马斯去看她的新画室，并向他保证，这间画室与他所熟悉的布拉格那间差别不大。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He would have been only too glad to visit her, but was unable to find an excuse to explain his absence to Tereza. And so Sabina came to Zurich. She stayed at a hotel. Tomas went to see her after work. He phoned first from the reception desk, then went upstairs. When she opened the door, she stood before him on her beautiful long legs wearing nothing but panties and bra. And a black bowler hat. She stood there staring, mute and motionless. Tomas did the same. Suddenly he realized how touched he was. He removed the bowler from her head and placed it on the bedside table. Then they made love without saying a word.</p><p>他不是仅仅因为高兴过分而不能去见她，而是在特丽莎面前找不到离家外出的借口。于是，萨宾娜到苏黎世来了，住在旅馆里，托马斯下班后去见她。他先从旅客登记处给她打电话，然后上楼。她开门时，头上戴着一顶黑色圆顶札帽，身上除了短三角裤和乳罩以外什么也没穿，露出了美丽的长腿。 他站在那儿凝视着他，不动，也无任何言语。托马斯也一样。突然，他意识到自己深深地震动了，从她头上取下礼帽放在旁边的桌子上。他们一声不响地开始做爱。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Leaving the hotel for his Hat (which by now had acquired table, chairs, couch, and carpet), he thought happily that he carried his way of living with him as a snail carries his house. </p><p>从旅馆里回家来（现在家里已有了桌子，椅子，沙发与地毯），他高兴地想到，他肩负这种生活就象蜗牛肩负着自己的房子。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Tereza and Sabina represented the two poles of his life, separate and irreconcilable, yet equally appealing.</p><p>特丽莎与萨宾娜代表着他生活的两极，互相排斥不可调和，然而都不可少。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But the fact that he carried his life-support system with him everywhere like a part of his body meant that Tereza went on having her dreams.</p><p>但事实是，如果他每到一处都带着这样的生命支撑体系，象带着自己身体的一部分，那么这意昧着特丽莎还得继续她的噩梦。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They had been in Zurich for six or seven months when he came home late one evening to find a letter on the table telling him she had left for Prague. She had left because she lacked the strength to live abroad. She knew she was supposed to bolster him up, but did not know how to go about it. She had been silly enough to think that going abroad would change her. She thought that after what she had been through during the invasion she would stop being petty and grow up, grow wise and strong, but she had overestimated herself. She was weighing him down and would do so no longer. She had drawn the necessary conclusions before it was too late. And she apologized for taking Karenin with her.</p><p>他们在苏黎世住了六、七个月，一天晚上，他回家晚了，发现她留下一封信。信上说，她已去了布拉格，说她离去是因为缺乏侨居国外的力量。她知道她应该尽力支持他，但她不知道怎么做。 她原来一直傻里傻气地以为国外的生活会改变她，以为经历入侵事件以后她不至于弱小如故，会长大，长得聪明而强壮，但她过高地估计了自己。她成了他的负担，不愿意继续成为负担。趁眼下还来得及，她得作出这个必要的决定。她还向托马斯道歉，说她带走了卡列宁。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He took some sleeping pills but still did not close his eyes until morning. Luckily it was Saturday and he could stay at home. For the hundred and fiftieth time he went over the situation: the borders between his country and the rest of the world were no longer open. No telegrams or telephone calls could bring her back. The authorities would never let her travel abroad. Her departure was staggeringly definitive.</p><p>他服了一些安眠药，可直到翌日凌晨，仍没合一下眼。幸好是星期六，他可以呆在家里。他一次又一次考虑眼下的形势：他的祖国已同世界上任何国家都断了往来。电话和电报是找她不回来的。当局也绝不会让她今后出国旅行。与她的分离看来已成定局。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>14</p><p>14</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The realization that he was utterly powerless was like the blow of a sledgehammer, yet it was curiously calming as well. No one was forcing him into a decision. He felt no need to stare at the walls of the houses across the courtyard and ponder whether to live with her or not. Tereza had made the decision herself.</p><p>意识到自己完全无能之后，他象挨了当头一棒，但又有一种奇异的镇静。没有人逼他作出结论。他也无须看着院子那边的墙发呆，无须苦苦思虑于她的去留。特丽莎自己已决定了一切。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He went to a restaurant for lunch. He was depressed, but as he ate, his original desperation waned, lost its strength, and soon all that was left was melancholy. Looking back on the years he had spent with her, he came to feel that their story could have had no better ending. If someone had invented the story, this is how he would have had to end it.</p><p>他到餐馆里吃了午饭，沉郁沮丧。可他吃着吃着，绝望的情绪渐渐消解，没有那么厉害了，很快，留下的只是一种忧郁。回想起与她一起生活的岁月，他觉得他们的故事不会有更好的结局。如果是别人来构设这个故事，他也不能不这样来结束。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>One day Tereza came to him uninvited. One day she left the same way. She came with a heavy suitcase. She left with a heavy suitcase.</p><p>一天，特丽莎未经邀请来到了他身边，一天，她又同样地离他而去。她带着沉重的箱子前来，又带着沉重的箱子离别。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He paid the bill, left the restaurant, and started walking through the streets, his melancholy growing more and more beautiful. He had spent seven years of life with Tereza, and now he realized that those years were more attractive in retrospect than they were when he was living them.</p><p>他付了账，离开餐馆开始逛街。他心中的忧郁变得越来越美丽。他和特丽莎共同生活了七年，现在他认识到了，对这些岁月的回忆远比它们本身更有魅力。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>His love for Tereza was beautiful, but it was also tiring: he had constantly had to hide things from her, sham, dissemble, make amends, buck her up, calm her down, give her evidence of his feelings, play the defendant to her jealousy, her suffering, and her dreams, feel guilty, make excuses and apologies. Now what was tiring had disappeared and only the beauty remained.</p><p>他对特丽莎的爱是美丽的，但也是令人厌倦的；他总是向她瞒着什么，哄劝，掩饰，讲和，使她振作，使她平静，向她表白感情，说得有眉有眼，在她的嫉妒、痛苦和噩梦之下煌煌如罪囚。他自责，他辩解，他道歉……好，这一切令人厌倦的东西现在终于都消失了，只留下了美。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Saturday found him for the first time strolling alone through Zurich, breathing in the heady smell of his freedom. New adventures hid around each corner. The future was again a secret. He was on his way back to the bachelor life, the life he had once felt destined for, the life that would let him be what he actually was.</p><p>星期六第一次发现他独自在苏黎世的街上溜达，呼吸着令人心醉的自由气息。每一个角落里都隐伏着新的风险，未来将又是一个谜。他又在回归单身汉的生活，回到他曾认为命里注定了的生活，在那种生活里他才是真正的他。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>For seven years he had lived bound to her, his every step subject to her scrutiny. She might as well have chained iron balls to his ankles. Suddenly his step was much lighter. He soared. He had entered Parmenides' magic field: he was enjoying the sweet lightness of being.</p><p>七年了，他与她系在一起过日子，他的每一步都受到她的监视。如果能够，她也许还会把铁球穿在他的脚踝上。突然间，他的脚步轻去许多，他飞起来了，来到了巴门尼德神奇的领地：他正亭受着甜美的生命之轻。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>(Did he feel like phoning Sabina in Geneva? Contacting one or another of the women he had met during his several months in Zurich? No, not in the least. Perhaps he sensed that any woman would make his memory of Tereza unbearably painful.)</p><p>（他想给日内瓦的萨宾娜打电话吗？或者想与他在苏黎世几个月内遇到的其他女人打电话联系吗？不，一点儿也不。也许他感到，任何女人都会使他痛苦不堪地回忆起特丽莎。）</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>15</p><p>15</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>This curious melancholic fascination lasted until Sunday evening. .On Monday, everything changed. Tereza forced her way into his thoughts: he imagined her sitting there writing her farewell letter; he felt her hands trembling; he saw her lugging her heavy suitcase in one hand and leading Karenin on his leash with the other; he pictured her unlocking their Prague flat, and suffered the utter abandonment breathing her in the face as she opened the door.</p><p>奇异而忧郁的自我迷醉一直延续到星期日夜里。星期一，一切都变了。他不由自主地想起了特丽莎；想象她坐在那里向他写告别信；感到她的手在颤抖；看见她一只手提着重箱子，另一只手引着卡列宁的皮带。他想象她打开他们在布拉格的公寓，推门时怎样痛苦地忍受那扑面面来的满房弃物的气息。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>During those two beautiful days of melancholy, his compassion (that curse of emotional telepathy) had taken a holiday. It had slept the sound Sunday sleep of a miner who, after a hard week's work, needs to gather strength for his Monday shift.</p><p>两天美好而忧郁的日子里，他的同情心（那引起心灵感应的祸根子）度假闲置，如同一个煤矿上紧张劳累一周之后，星期天呼呼大睡，为星期一的上班积蓄气力。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Instead of the patients he was treating, Tomas saw Tereza.</p><p>他给病人诊治，却总在病人身上看见特丽莎。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He tried to remind himself. Don't think about her! Don't think about her! He said to himself, I'm sick with compassion. It's good that she's gone and that I'll never see her again, though it's not Tereza I need to be free of—it's that sickness, compassion, which I thought I was immune to until she infected me with it.</p><p>他努力提醒自己，不去想她！不去想她！他对自己说，我是患了同情症啦。其实她的出走和我们不再相见，这都很好，尽管我想摆脱的不是特丽莎，而是那种病——同情。这种病，我以前是完全免疫的，是她感染了我。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>On Saturday and Sunday, he felt the sweet lightness of being rise up to him out of the depths of the future. On Monday, he was hit by a weight the likes of which he had never known. The tons of steel of the Russian tanks were nothing compared with it. For there is nothing heavier than compassion. Not even one's own pain weighs so heavy as the pain one feels with someone, for someone, a pain intensified by the imagination and prolonged by a hundred echoes.</p><p>星期六和星期天，他感到甜美的生命之轻托他浮出了未来的深处。到星期一，他却被从未体验过的重负所击倒，连俄国坦克数吨钢铁也无法与之相比。没有什么比同情更为沉重了。一个人的痛苦远不及对痛苦的同情那样沉重，而且对某些人来说，他们的想象会强化痛苦，他们百次重复回荡的想象更使痛苦无边无涯。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He kept warning himself not to give in to compassion, and compassion listened with bowed head and a seemingly guilty conscience. Compassion knew it was being presumptuous, yet it quietly stood its ground, and on the fifth day after her departure Tomas informed the director of his hospital (the man who had phoned him daily in Prague after the Russian invasion) that he had to return at once. He was ashamed. He knew that the move would appear irresponsible, inexcusable to the man. He thought to unbosom himself and tell him the story of Tereza and the letter she had left on the table for him. But in the end he did not. From the Swiss doctor's point of view Tereza's move could only appear hysterical and abhorrent. And Tomas refused to allow anyone an opportunity to think ill of her.</p><p>他不断警告自己不要向同情心屈服，同情心则俯首恭听，似乎自觉罪过。但同情心知道这只是他的自以为是，还是默默地固守自己的阵地，终于，在特丽莎离别后的第五天，托马斯告诉院长（俄国入侵后曾打电话给他的那位），他得马上回去。他有点不好意思，知道他的走对院长来说太唐突，也没有理由。他想吐露自己的心思，告诉他特丽莎的事以及她留给他的信，可最终没说出口。在这位瑞士大夫的眼里，特丽莎的走只能是发疯或者邪恶。而托马斯不允许任何人有任何机会视她为病人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> The director of the hospital was in fact offended. </p><p>事实上，院长生气了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Tomas shrugged his shoulders and said, "Es muss sein. Es muss sein." </p><p>托马斯耸耸肩说：“Es muss sein. Es muss sein．”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was an allusion. The last movement of Beethoven's last quartet is based on the following two motifs:</p><p>这是引用了贝多芬最后一首四重奏曲中最后一乐章的主题：</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>To make the meaning of the words absolutely clear, Beethoven introduced the movement with a phrase, "Der schwer gefasste Entschluss", which is commonly translated as the "difficult resolution". </p><p>为了使这些句子清楚无误，贝多芬用一个词组介绍了这一乐章，那就是“Der schwer gefasste Entschluss”，一般译为“难下的决心”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>This allusion to Beethoven was actually Tomas's first step back to Tereza, because she was the one who had induced him to buy records of the Beethoven quartets and sonatas.</p><p>对贝多芬这一主题的引用，的确是托马斯转向特丽莎的第一步，因为是她曾经让他去买贝多芬的那些四重奏、奏鸣曲的磁带。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The allusion was even more pertinent than he had thought because the Swiss doctor was a great music lover. Smiling serenely, he asked, in the melody of Beethoven's motif, "Muss es sein?" </p><p>出他所料，引用贝多芬的这一主题对那位瑞士大夫相当合适。对方是个音乐迷，他平静地笑着用贝多芬的曲调问道：“Muss es sen？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Muss es sein! Tomas said again.</p><p>托马斯再一次说：Muss es sein！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>16</p><p>16</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Unlike Parmenides, Beethoven apparently viewed weight as something positive. Since the German word schwer means both "difficult" and "heavy", Beethoven's "difficult resolution" may also be construed as a "heavy" or "weighty resolution". The weighty resolution is at one with the voice of "Fate" ("Es muss sein!"); necessity, weight, and value are three concepts inextricably bound: only necessity is heavy, and only what is heavy has value.</p><p>与巴门尼德不一样，贝多芬显然视沉重为一种积极的东西。既然德语中schwer的意思既是“困难”，又是“沉重”，贝多芬“难下的决心”也可以解释为“沉重的”或“有分量的决心”。这种有分量的决心与他的“命运”交响乐曲主题是一致的（“非如此不可！”）；必然，沉重，价值，这三个概念连接在一起。只有必然，才能沉重；所以沉重，便有价值。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>This is a conviction born of Beethoven's music, and although we cannot ignore the possibility (or even probability) that it owes its origins more to Beethoven's commentators than to Beethoven himself, we all more or less share, it: we believe that the greatness of man stems from the fact that he bears his fate as Atlas bore the heavens on his shoulders. Beethoven's hero is a lifter of metaphysical weights.</p><p>这是贝多芬的音乐所孕育出来的一种信念。尽管我们不能忽略这种可能（甚至是很可能），探索这种信念应更多地归功于贝多芬作品的注释者们，而不是贝多芬本人。我们也或多或少地赞同：我们相信正是人能象阿特拉斯顶天一样地承受着命运，才会有人的伟大。贝多芬的英雄，就是能顶起形而上重负的人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Tomas approached the Swiss border. I imagine a gloomy, shock-headed Beethoven, in person, conducting the local firemen's brass band in a farewell to emigration, an "Es Muss Sein" march.</p><p>托马斯临近瑞士边境。我想象这是一个神情忧郁、头发蓬乱的贝多芬，在亲自指挥乡间消防人员管乐队，演奏一支“非如此不可”的移民告别进行曲。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Then Tomas crossed the Czech border and was welcomed by columns of Russian tanks. He had to stop his car and wait a half hour before they passed. A terrifying soldier in the black Uniform of the armored forces stood at the crossroads directing traffic as if every road in the country belonged to him and him alone.</p><p>他越过捷克边境，迎接他的是一队队俄国坦克。他不得不停车半小时等他们先过。一个可怕的士兵，穿着装甲兵黑色制服，站在道口指挥着车辆，似乎这个国家的每一条路都属他管，属于他一个人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Es muss sein!" Tomas repeated to himself, but then he began to doubt. Did it really have to be?</p><p>“非如此不可！”托马斯心里重复着，但接着又开始怀疑起来，真的必须这样吗？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Yes, it was unbearable for him to stay in Zurich imagining Tereza living on her own in Prague.</p><p>是的，他实在受不了自个儿呆在苏黎世却想象着特丽莎一个人在布拉格。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But how long would he have been tortured by compassion? All his life? A year? Or a month? Or only a week?</p><p>可他究竟要被这同情症折磨多久呢？整个一生吗？或者一年？一个月？仅仅一个星期？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>How could he have known? How could he have gauged it? Any schoolboy can do experiments in the physics laboratory to test various scientific hypotheses. But man, because he has only one life to live, cannot conduct experiments to test whether to follow his "passion (compassion)" or not.</p><p>他怎么会知道？他怎么能估计到？任何一个学生都能在物理实验室里验证各种科学假设，可一个男子汉只有一次生命，不能够用实验来测定他是否应当服从“感情（同感）”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was with these thoughts in mind that he opened the door to his flat. Karenin made the homecoming easier by jumping up on him and licking his face. The desire to fall into Tereza's arms (he could still feel it while getting into his car in Zurich) had completely disintegrated. He fancied himself standing opposite her in the midst of a snowy plain, the two of them shivering from the cold.</p><p>他就带着这些想法打开了他的家门。卡列宁一下跳到他身上，舔他的脸以示欢迎。而他想投进特丽莎怀中的欲望（他在苏黎世上车时还想着的），顿时烟消云散。他觉得自己与她象是在冰雪覆盖的草原上面对面站着，两个人都冷得直哆嗦。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>17</p><p>17</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>From the very beginning of the occupation, Russian military airplanes had flown over Prague all night long. Tomas, no longer accustomed to the noise, was unable to fall asleep.</p><p>从占领一开始，俄国的军用飞机便成天在布拉格上空盘旋，托马斯极不习惯这种噪音，无法入睡。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Twisting and turning beside the slumbering Tereza, he recalled something she had told him a long time before in the course of an insignificant conversation. They had been talking about his friend Z. when she announced, "If I hadn't met you, I'd certainly have fallen in love with him."</p><p>他在微微入睡的特丽莎身边翻来复去，回想起很久以前在一次闲聊中她告诉他的一件事来。他们谈起她的朋友Z，当时她宣布：“如果我没遇到你的话，我一定会爱上他。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Even then, her words had left Tomas in a strange state of melancholy, and now he realized it was only a matter of chance that Tereza loved him and not his friend Z. Apart from her consummated love for Tomas, there were, in the realm of possibility, an infinite number of unconsummated loves for other men.</p><p>即使在那时，她的话都使他落人一种莫名的忧伤。而现在，他认识到特丽莎爱上他而不是他的朋友Z，只不过是机缘罢了。除了她与托马斯圆满的爱以外，很可能，还有着若干她与其他男人的不圆满的爱。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>We all reject out of hand the idea that the love of our life may be something light or weightless; we presume our love is what must be, that without it our life would no longer be the same; we feel that Beethoven himself, gloomy and awe-inspiring, is playing the "Es muss sein!" to our own great love.</p><p>我们都绝难接受这种观点：我们生活中的爱情是一种轻飘失重的东西，假定我们的爱情只能如此，那么没有它的话我们的生活也将不复如此。我们感到贝多芬，那阴郁和令人敬畏的音乐家在向我们伟大的爱情演奏着：“非如此不可！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Tomas often thought of Tereza's remark about his friend Z. and came to the conclusion that the love story of his life exemplified not "Es muss sein!" (It must be so), but rather "Es konnte auch anders sein" (It could just as well be otherwise).</p><p>托马斯常常想起特丽莎对朋友Z的评价，然后得出结论：自己的爱情故事并不说明“非如此不可”，而是“别样也行”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seven years earlier, a complex neurological case happened to have been discovered at the hospital in Tereza's town. They called in the chief surgeon of Tomas's hospital in Prague for consultation, but the chief surgeon of Tomas's hospital happened to be suffering from sciatica, and because he could not move he sent Tomas to the provincial hospital in his place. </p><p>七年前，特丽莎家乡的医院碰巧发现一例复杂综合性神经病。他们请了托马斯所在的布拉格医院的主治大夫去会诊，可主治大夫碰巧坐骨神经痛，行动不便，于是派托马斯去代替他。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The town had several hotels, but Tomas happened to be given a room in the one where Tereza was employed. He happened to have had enough free time before his train left to stop at the hotel restaurant. Tereza happened to be on duty, and happened to be serving Tomas's table. It had taken six chance happenings to push Tomas towards Tereza, as if he had little inclination to go to her on his own.</p><p>这个镇子有几个旅馆，托马斯碰巧被安排在特丽莎工作的旅馆里，又碰巧在走之前有足够的时间闲呆在旅馆餐厅里。其时特丽莎碰巧当班，又碰巧为托马斯服务。正是这六个碰巧的机会把托马斯推向了特丽莎，似乎并不是他自己决定与她结合。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He had gone back to Prague because of her. So fateful a decision resting on so fortuitous a love, a love that would not even have existed had it not been for the chief surgeon's sciatica seven years earlier. And that woman, that personification of absolute fortuity, now again lay asleep beside him, breathing deeply.</p><p>他回布拉格是因为她。如此事关命运的重大决定仅仅系于如此偶然的爱情，而这一爱情如果不是七年前主治大夫坐骨神经痛的话，也就不存在。那个女人，那个绝对偶然性的化身又躺在他身边了，深深地呼吸着。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was late at night. His stomach started acting up as it tended to do in times of psychic stress.</p><p>夜已深了，如他每次感到精神沉郁时那样，他的胃就跟着开始捣乱。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Once or twice her breathing turned into mild snores. Tomas felt no compassion. All he felt was the pressure in his stomach and the despair of having returned.</p><p>有那么一两次，她的呼吸变成了沉沉的鼾声。托马斯除了胃的压迫感与归来后的失望感以外，觉不出一点儿同情。</p></div>
