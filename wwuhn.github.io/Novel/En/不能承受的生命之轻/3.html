<div class='layout'><p>PART THREE Words Misunderstood</p><p>三、误解的词</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>1</p><p>1</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Geneva is a city of fountains large and small, of parks where music once rang out from the bandstands. Even the university is hidden among trees. Franz had just finished his afternoon lecture. As he left the building, the sprinklers were spouting jets of water over the lawn and he was in a capital mood. He was on his way to see his mistress. She lived only a few streets away.</p><p>日内瓦是大大小小的喷泉和公园之城，公园的室外演奏台不时飘来音乐声。这所大学就隐没在树丛里。弗兰茨刚讲完下午的课，走出大楼，碰上洒水车正在浇洒草地。他心情极好，正要去见他的情妇。她的住处离这里只隔了几条街。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He often stopped in for a visit, but only as a friend, never as a lover. If he made love to her in her Geneva studio, he would be going from one woman to the other, from wife to mistress and back in a single day, and because in Geneva husband and wife sleep together in the French style, in the same bed, he would be going from the bed of one woman to the bed of another in the space of several hours. And that, he felt, would humiliate both mistress and wife and, in the end, himself as well.</p><p>他常常顺便去看她，但只是作为一位朋友，没有性的要求。如果他们在日内瓦她的画室里做爱，他就得在一天中奔波于两个女人，即妻子与情人之间。日内瓦还保留着法国的传统，夫妻得睡一床。几个小时之内从一张女人的床转到另一张女人的床，他觉得不论对妻子和情人都是一种耻辱，最终对他也是一种耻辱。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The love he bore this woman, with whom he had fallen in love several months before, was so precious to him that he tried to create an independent space for her in his life, a restricted zone of purity. </p><p>他爱这个女人已经有好几个月了。这种爱对他来说如此宝贵，他想在他的生活中为她创造出一块独立的天地，一片纯净的禁区。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He was often invited to lecture at foreign universities, and now he accepted all offers. But because they were not enough to satisfy his new-found wanderlust, he took to inventing congresses and symposia as a means of justifying the new absences to his wife. </p><p>外国大学邀他讲学，现在他全部应允下来。这些还不够满足他新产生的旅行癖，他又开始以一些代表会和座谈会为借口，作为他近来不回家的理由。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>His mistress, who had a flexible schedule, accompanied him on all speaking engagements, real and imagined. So it was that within a short span of time he introduced her to many European cities and an American one.</p><p>他的女友时间安排很灵活，可以伴他同赴所有真真假假的演讲活动。在短短的时间里，他已带她见识了许多欧洲城市和一个美国城市。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"How would you like to go to Palermo ten days from now?" asked Franz.</p><p>“十天后你愿去巴勒莫吗？”弗兰茨问。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I prefer Geneva", she answered. She was standing in front of her easel examining a work in progress.</p><p>“我更喜欢日内瓦。”她回答。正站在画架前仔细审视一幅作品。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"How can you live without seeing Palermo?" asked Franz in an attempt at levity.</p><p>“你一生怎么能不去看看巴勒莫？”弗兰茨轻轻地试探道，</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I have seen Palermo," she said.</p><p>“我见过巴勒莫了。”她说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You have?" he said with a hint of jealousy.</p><p>“见过？”他语气中露出嫉妒。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"A friend of mine once sent me a postcard from there. It's taped up over the toilet. Haven't you noticed?"</p><p>“一个朋友曾经从那儿给我台来一张明信片，就贴在卫生间，你没注意？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Then she told him a story. "Once upon a time, in the early part of the century, there lived a poet. He was so old he had to be taken on walks by his amanuensis. 'Master,' his amanuensis said one day, 'look what's up in the sky! It's the first airplane ever to fly over the city!' 'I have my own picture of it,' said the poet to his amanuensis, without raising his eyes from the ground. Well, I have my own picture of Palermo. It has the same hotels and cars as all cities. And my studio always has new and different pictures." </p><p>她给他讲了一个故事：“从前，本世纪初，那里住了一位诗人，老得走不动了，只能让他的抄写员扶着散步。有一天，他的抄写员说：‘先生，看，天上有什么！那是飞过这座城市的第一架飞机。’可这位诗人连眼皮都没有抬，说：‘我对它自有想象！’好了，我对巴勒莫也自有想象。它和其它所有的城市一样，有同样的旅馆和汽车，而我的画室总是有新的，不同的种种图像。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Franz was sad. He had grown so accustomed to linking their love life to foreign travel that his Let's go to Palermo! was an unambiguous erotic message and her "I prefer Geneva" could have only one meaning: his mistress no longer desired him.</p><p>弗兰茨有些沮丧。他已经慢慢地习馈了把他用的爱情生活与出国旅行联系起来，说“让我们去巴勒莫吧”，无疑是向她表示性爱的明确信号；而她说“我更喜欢日内瓦”，无异于说：他的情人不再爱他。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>How could he be so unsure of himself with her? She had not given him the slightest cause for worry! In fact, she was the one who had taken the erotic initiative shortly after they met. </p><p>他怎么会对她这么摸不透？她从未使他有丝毫忧虑之理！事实上，她是一个见面不久就采取性主动的人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He was a good-looking man; he was at the peak of his scholarly career; he was even feared by his colleagues for the arrogance and tenacity he displayed during professional meetings and colloquia. Then why did he worry daily that his mistress was about to leave him?</p><p>他长相很好，学术事业也处于巅峰时期，在专业座谈会上与学术辩论会上所表现的傲气与锐气使同事们都害怕，然而他为什么要天天担心情人的离去？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The only explanation I can suggest is that for Franz, love was not an extension of public life but its antithesis. It meant a longing to put himself at the mercy of his partner. He who gives himself up like a prisoner of war must give up his weapons as well. And deprived in advance of defense against a possible blow, he cannot help wondering when the blow will fall. That is why I can say that for Franz, love meant the constant expectation of a blow.</p><p>我猜想，唯一的解释就是弗兰茨的爱情不是他社会生活的延展，而是相反。爱情只是他乞求对象怜悯的一种欲望。他自己就象一个被缴了械的战俘事先就把对付打击的防卫力量解除了，打击降临时他也就无所惊奇。所以我说，对弗兰茨而言，爱情意味着对某种打击的不断期待。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>While Franz attended to his anguish, his mistress put down her brush and went into the next room. She returned with a bottle of wine. She opened it without a word and poured out two glasses.</p><p>正当弗兰茨伤心失意的时候，他的情人把笔放下了，走到另一间房里，拿来一瓶酒，一句话没说便开了瓶盖倒了两杯。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Immediately he felt relieved and slightly ridiculous. The "I prefer Geneva" did not mean she refused to make love; quite the contrary, it meant she was tired of limiting their lovemaking to foreign cities.</p><p>他立即感到轻松，还有点好笑。这句“我更喜欢日内瓦”并不意味着对方拒绝做爱，相反，只是意味着她厌倦于把做爱与国外城市捆在一起。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She raised her glass and emptied it in one swig. Franz did the same. He was naturally overjoyed that her refusal to go to Palermo was actually a call to love, but he was a bit sorry as well: his mistress seemed determined to violate the zone of Purity he had introduced into their relationship; she had failed to understand his apprehensive attempts to save their love from banality and separate it radically from his conjugal home.</p><p>她举起酒杯一干而尽。弗兰茨也喝光了，自然高兴异常。即便把对方不愿去巴勒莫看成实际上爱的呼唤，他还是有点担心：他的情人看来执意要突破他在两人关系中设置的纯洁地带，未能理解他使这种爱摆脱庸俗的尝试，未能理解他把这种爱与他的婚姻家庭彻底划清界线的企图。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The ban on making love with his painter-mistress in Geneva was actually a self-inflicted punishment for having married another woman. He felt it as a kind of guilt or defect. Even though his conjugal sex life was hardly worth mentioning, he and his wife still slept in the same bed, awoke in the middle of the night to each other's heavy breathing, and inhaled the smells of each other's body. True, he would rather have slept by himself, but the marriage bed is still the symbol of the marriage bond, and symbols, as we know, are inviolable.</p><p>禁止自己与画家情妇在日内瓦做爱，实际上是他娶了另一个女人的自行惩罚。他感到一种背叛的内疚。与妻子的性生活不值一提，但他与妻子仍睡在一张床上，半夜里在彼此沉重的呼吸中醒来，吸入对方身体的气息。真的，他宁愿一个人睡，可结婚的床仍然是婚姻的象征，我们知道，象征性的东西是神圣不可侵犯的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Each time he lay down next to his wife in that bed, he thought of his mistress imagining him lying down next to his wife in that bed, and each time he thought of her he felt ashamed. That was why he wished to separate the bed he slept in with his wife as far as possible in space from the bed he made love in with his mistress.</p><p>每当他躺在妻子旁边，便想起情人会想象他与妻子同床共枕的情景，而每当他想到她，他就感到羞耻。那就是为什么他总希望与妻子睡觉的床和与情人做爱的床，在空间上要离得越远越好。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>His painter-mistress poured herself another glass of wine, drank it down, and then, still silent and with a curious nonchalance, as if completely unaware of Franz's presence, slowly removed her blouse. She was behaving like an acting student whose improvisation assignment is to make the class believe she is alone in a room and no one can see her.</p><p>他的画家情人给她自己倒了另一杯酒，喝光，仍然一言不发，带着难以揣测的冷漠，慢慢脱掉了短外套，似乎完全无视弗兰茨的存在。她就象一个当着全班即兴表演的学生，要让全班相信她独自一个人在屋子里，没有人看着她。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Standing there in her skirt and bra, she suddenly (as if recalling only then that she was not alone in the room) fixed Franz with a long stare.</p><p>她穿着裙子和乳罩站在那里，突然，她（似乎想起她并非一个人在屋子里）久久地盯着弗兰茨。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>That stare bewildered him; he could not understand it. All lovers unconsciously establish their own rules of the game, which from the outset admit no transgression. The stare she had just fixed on him fell outside their rules; it had nothing in common with the looks and gestures that usually preceded their lovemaking. It was neither provocative nor flirtatious, simply interrogative. The problem was, Franz had not the slightest notion what it was asking.</p><p>这种眼光使他迷惑，他不能明白其中含义。所有的情人都是从一开始就无意识地建立起他们的各种约定，而且互不违反。她刚才盯着他的目光却是约定之外的东西，与平时做爱时的眼光神态毫无共通之处，既不是挑逗，也不是调情，纯粹是一种疑惑询问。问题在于，弗兰茨对它问的什么一无所知。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Next she stepped out of her skirt and, taking Franz by the hand, turned him in the direction of a large mirror propped against the wall. Without letting go of his hand, she looked into the mirror with the same long questioning stare, training it first on herself, then on him. Near the mirror stood a wig stand with an old black bowler hat on it. She bent over, picked up the hat, and put it on her head. </p><p>她从裙子里退身出来，拉着他的手带向靠墙的一面大镜子。她没让他的手抽出，以同样的疑问的眼光久久打量着镜子，先看自己，然后又看他。镜子旁边放着一个套了顶旧圆顶黑礼帽的假发架子。她弯腰取来帽子，戴在自己头上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The image in the mirror was instantaneously transformed: suddenly it was a woman in her undergarments, a beautiful, distant, indifferent woman with a terribly out-of-place bowler hat on her head, holding the hand of a man in a gray suit and a tie.Again he had to smile at how poorly he understood his mistress. When she took her clothes off, it wasn't so much erotic provocation as an odd little caper, a happening a deux. </p><p>镜子里的形象立即变了：一位身着内衣的女人，一位美貌、茫然而冷摸的女人戴着一顶极不适当的圆顶礼帽，握着一位穿着灰色西装和结着领带的男子的手。他实在无法理解情人，只得窘迫地笑了笑。她的脱衣不太象是性挑逗似的额外小把戏，或一次偶然的双份赏赐。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>His smile beamed understanding and consent.He waited for his mistress to respond in kind, but she did not. Without letting go of his hand, she stood staring into the mirror, first at herself, then at him.</p><p>他微微笑着表示理解和赞同。他期待情人也对他报以微笑，但她没有，只是拉着他的手，站在那儿盯着镜子，先看自己，然后看他。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The time for the happening had come and gone. Franz was beginning to feel that the caper (which, in and of itself, he was happy to think of as charming) had dragged on too long. </p><p>事儿开始了，又结束了，他这才开始感到那玩笑（他愉快地想到玩笑本身以及事后的感受都很美妙）拉的时间太长了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>So he gently took the brim of the bowler hat between two fingers, lifted it off Sabina's head with a smile, and laid it back on the wig stand. It was as though he were erasing the mustache a naughty child had drawn on a picture of the Virgin Mary. For several more seconds she remained motionless, staring at herself in the mirror. Then Franz covered her with tender kisses and asked her once more to go with him in ten days to Palermo. </p><p>他温和地用两个手指托起礼帽的帽沿，微笑着从萨宾娜头上取下来，放回到假发架子上，好象他是在抹掉哪个顽皮孩童涂在圣母玛丽亚像上的胡子。几秒钟过去，她仍然一动不动凝视着镜子里的自己。弗兰茨温情地俯吻她，再次求她十天后与他一起去巴勒莫。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>This time she said yes unquestioningly, and he left.</p><p>这一次，她明确表示同意。然后，他走了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He was in an excellent mood again. Geneva, which he had cursed all his life as the metropolis of boredom, now seemed beautiful and full of adventure. </p><p>他又处于极佳心境。被他一生都诅咒为无趣都市的日内瓦，现在看来也显得漂亮而充满奇遇。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Outside in the street, he looked back up at the studio's broad window. It was late spring and hot. All the windows were shaded with striped awnings. </p><p>他站在街上，回头看了看那画室宽大的窗户。春末的天气很热，所有的窗户都加了百叶天篷。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Franz walked to the park. At its far end, the golden cupolas of the Orthodox church rose up like two gilded cannonballs kept from imminent collapse and suspended in the air by some invisible Power. </p><p>他又朝公园走去，公园的尽头，东正教教堂的金色圆顶朝上竖立，象两颗镀金的炮弹，被一种无形的力量悬挂而没有马上倒塌下来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Everything was beautiful. Then he went down to the embankment and took the public transport boat to the north bank of the lake, where he lived.</p><p>一切都是美好的。他接着走下堤岸，乘公共交通渡船驶向湖的北岸，回家。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>2</p><p>2</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sabina was now by herself. She went back to the mirror, still in her underwear. She put the bowler hat back on her head and had a long look at herself. She was amazed at the number of years she had spent pursuing one lost moment.</p><p>现在就剩萨宾娜自己了。她还是只穿着内衣，回到镜子前，把礼帽又戴上，久久地看着自己，对自己多年来只是为了追寻那失去了的一瞬间而感到惊讶，</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Once, during a visit to her studio many years before, the bowler hat had caught Tomas's fancy. </p><p>许多年以前，这顶礼帽曾使托马斯拜访她画家时兴致盎然。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He had set it on his head and looked at himself in the large mirror which, as in the Geneva studio, leaned against the wall. </p><p>他戴上帽子，从大镜子里去看自己，镜子也象在日内瓦一样是靠着墙的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He wanted to see what he would have looked like as a nineteenth-century mayor. When Sabina started undressing, he put the hat on her head. </p><p>他想看看自己作为一个十九世纪的市长是什么摸样。萨宾娜开始脱衣，他便把帽子戴到她头上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>There they stood in front of the mirror (they always stood in front of the mirror while she undressed), watching themselves. </p><p>他们都站在镜子面前（每次她脱衣时他们总是站在镜子面前），看着他们自己。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She stripped to her underwear, but still had the hat on her head. And all at once she realized they were both excited by what they saw in the mirror.</p><p>她脱掉了内衣，头上仍然戴着帽子，在这一瞬间，她意识到他们俩都被镜子中所看到的情景激动了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>What could have excited them so? A moment before, the hat on her head had seemed nothing but a joke. </p><p>什么能使他们如此激动？几分钟前她也戴着帽子，看起来只不过是个玩笑而已。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Was excitement really a mere step away from laughter?</p><p>激动与玩笑真的只是一步之差吗？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Yes. When they looked at each other in the mirror that time, all she saw for the first few seconds was a comic situation. But suddenly the comic became veiled by excitement: the bowler hat no longer signified a joke; it signified violence; violence against Sabina, against her dignity as a woman. </p><p>是的。他们通过镜子互相观看，最初几秒钟看到的只是一种笑剧场面，突然，笑剧被一种激动所覆盖：圆顶礼帽不再意味着玩笑，而是意昧着强暴，强暴萨宾娜，强暴她作为一个女人的尊严。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She saw her bare legs and thin panties with her pubic triangle showing through. The lingerie enhanced the charm of her femininity, while the hard masculine hat denied it, violated and ridiculed it. </p><p>她看到自已赤裸的双腿以及从薄薄短裤里隐约透出的阴毛三角区。女式内裤增添了她女性的腿力，可硬帮邦的男子礼帽对她的女性魅力给以否决，亵渎，以及嘲弄。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The fact that Tomas stood beside her fully dressed meant that the essence of what they both saw was far from good clean fun (if it had been fun he was after, he, too, would have had to strip and don a bowler hat); it was humiliation. </p><p>托马斯穿戴整齐地站在身边，这一事实意昧着他们俩所看到的已远非某种纯净的玩笑（如果一直是玩笑，他后来也会不得不脱衣、戴帽什么的）；而是一种耻辱。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But instead of spurning it, she proudly, provocatively played it for all it was worth, as if submitting of her own will to public rape; and suddenly, unable to wait any longer, she pulled Tomas down to the floor. The bowler hat rolled under the table, and they began thrashing about on the rug at the foot of the mirror.</p><p>她不但没有唾弃它，反而自豪地挑逗池把它玩味个够，玩味它的全部价值，好象服从自己的意志去接受公开的强奸。突然，她不耐久等，把托马斯拖倒在地板上，不顾帽子滚到桌下，两人在镜子跟前的地毯上翻滚起来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But let us return to the bowler hat:</p><p>让我们回到礼帽上来吧！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>First, it was a vague reminder of a forgotten grandfather, the mayor of a small Bohemian town during the nineteenth century.</p><p>首先，这是一个模糊的记忆，通向被遗忘了的祖父，那位十九世纪波赫明小城市的市长。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Second, it was a memento of her father. After the funeral her brother appropriated all their parents' property, and she, refusing out of sovereign contempt to fight for her rights, announced sarcastically that she was taking the bowler hat as her sole inheritance.</p><p>第二，这是她父亲的纪念物。埋葬了父亲后，她哥哥侵占了父母的全部财产，她拒绝不顾廉耻去捍卫一己之权利，便嘲讽地宣称她愿意要这顶礼帽作为难一的遗产。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Third, it was a prop for her love games with Tomas.</p><p>第三，这是她与托马斯多次性爱游戏中的一个道具。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Fourth, it was a sign of her originality, which she consciously cultivated. She could not take much with her when she emigrated, and taking this bulky, impractical thing meant giving up other, more practical ones.</p><p>第四，这是她有意精心培养的独创精神的一个标志。她移居时没带多少东西，而带了这又笨又不实用的东西，意味着她放弃了其它更多实用的东西。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Fifth, now that she was abroad, the hat was a sentimental object. When she went to visit Tomas in Zurich, she took it along and had it on her head when he opened the hotel-room door. </p><p>第五，现在她佳在国外，这顶帽子成了一件伤感物。她去苏黎世见托马斯，就带着这顶帽子，打开旅馆房门时头上也正戴着它。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But then something she had not reckoned with happened: the hat, no longer jaunty or sexy, turned into a monument to time past. </p><p>可有些她没有预料到的事发生了：这顶帽子不再新鲜有趣和刺激性欲，仅仅变成了一座往昔时光的纪念碑。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They were both touched. They made love as they never had before. This was no occasion for obscene games. For this meeting was not a continuation of their erotic rendezvous, each of which had been an opportunity to think up some new little vice; it was a recapitulation of time, a hymn to their common past, a sentimental summary of an unsentimental story that was disappearing in the distance.</p><p>他们俩都感动了。他们象是第一次做爱，不是一种猥亵的性游戏。这次见面也不是他们性交往的一种继续，不能象以面那样每次都有机会想出一些新的小小淫乱。这次会见是一种时间的回复，是他们共同历史的赞歌，是那远远一去不可回的没有伤感的过去的伤感总结。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The bowler hat was a motif in the musical composition that was Sabina's life. It returned again and again, each time with a different meaning, and all the meanings flowed through the bowler hat like water through a riverbed. </p><p>这顶礼帽是萨宾娜生命乐曲中的一个动机，一次又一次地重现，每次都有不同的意义，而所有的意义都象水通过河床一样从帽子上消失了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I might call it Heraclitus' ("You can't step twice into the same river") riverbed: the bowler hat was a bed through which each time Sabina saw another river flow, another semantic river: each time the same object would give rise to a new meaning, though all former meanings would resonate (like an echo, like a parade of echoes) together with the new one. </p><p>我们也许能称它为赫拉克利特河床（“你不能两次定入同一条河流”）：这顶帽子是一条河床，每一次萨宾娜走过都看到另一条河流，语义的河流：每一次，同一事物都展示出新的含义，尽管原有意义会与之反响共鸣（象回声，象回声的反复激荡），与新的含义混为一体。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Each new experience would resound, each time enriching the harmony. The reason why Tomas and Sabina were touched by the sight of the bowler hat in a Zurich hotel and made love almost in tears was that its black presence was not merely a reminder of their love games but also a memento of Sabina's father and of her grandfather, who lived in a century without airplanes and cars.</p><p>每一次新的经验都会产生共鸣，增添着浑然回声的和谐。托马斯与萨宾娜在苏黎世的旅馆里被这顶帽子的出现所感动，做爱时几乎含着热泪，其原因就是这黑色的精灵不仅仅是他们性爱游戏的遗存，而且是一种纪念物，使他们想起萨宾娜的父亲，还有她那位生活在没有飞机与汽车时代的祖父。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Now, perhaps, we are in a better position to understand the abyss separating Sabina and Franz: he listened eagerly to the story of her life and she was equally eager to hear the story of his, but although they had a clear understanding of the logical meaning of the words they exchanged, they failed to hear the semantic susurrus of the river flowing through them.</p><p>现在，我们站在这个角度，也许比较能理解萨宾娜与弗兰茨之间的那道深渊了：他热切地听了她的故事，而她也热切地听了他的故事。但是，尽管他们都明白对方言词的逻辑意义，但不能听到从它们身上淌过的语义之河的窃窃细语。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And so when she put on the bowler hat in his presence, Franz felt uncomfortable, as if someone had spoken to him in a language he did not know. It was neither obscene nor sentimental, merely an incomprehensible gesture. What made him feel uncomfortable was its very lack of meaning.</p><p>所以，当她戴着这顶礼帽出现在他面前，弗兰茨感到不舒服，好象什么人用他不懂的语言在对他讲话；既不是猥亵，也不是伤感，仅仅是一种不能理解的手势。他不舒服是因为它太缺乏含义。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>While people are fairly young and the musical composition of their lives is still in its opening bars, they can go about writing it together and exchange motifs (the way Tomas and Sabina exchanged the motif of the bowler hat), but if they meet when they are older, like Franz and Sabina, their musical compositions are more or less complete, and every motif, every object, every word means something different to each of them.</p><p>人们还很年轻的时候，生命的乐章刚刚开始，他们可以一起来谱写它，互相交换动机（象托马斯与萨宾娜相互交换礼帽的动机），但是，如果他们相见时年岁大了，象萨宾娜与弗兰茨那样，生命的乐章多少业已完成，每一个动机，每一件物体，每一句话，互相都有所不一样了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>If I were to make a record of all Sabina and Franz's conversations, I could compile a long lexicon of their misunderstandings. Let us be content, instead, with a short dictionary.</p><p>如果我把萨宾娜与路兰茨的谈话记下来，可以编出一本厚厚的有关他们误解的词汇录。算了，就编本小小的词典，也就够了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>3</p><p>3</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>A Short Dictionary of Misunderstood Words</p><p>误解小辞典</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"WOMAN"</p><p>“女人”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Being a woman is a fate Sabina did not choose. What we have not chosen we cannot consider either our merit or our failure. Sabina believed that she had to assume the correct attitude to her unchosen fate. To rebel against being born a woman seemed as foolish to her as to take pride in it.</p><p>萨宾娜并没有选择一个作女人的命运。我们所没有选择的东西，我们既不能认为是自己的功劳，也不是自己的过错。萨宾娜相信她不得不采取正确的态度来对待非己所择的命运。在她看来，反抗自己生为女人是愚蠢的，骄傲于自己生为女人亦然。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>During one of their first times together, Franz announced to her, in an oddly emphatic way:"Sabina, you are a woman." She could not understand why he accentuated the obvious with the solemnity of a Columbus who has just sighted land. Not until later did she understand that the word "woman", on which he had placed such uncommon emphasis, did not, in his eyes, signify one of the two human sexes; it represented a value. Not every woman was worthy of being called a woman.</p><p>他们初交时，弗兰茨以一种奇怪的强调性口吻宣称：“萨宾娜，你是个女人。”她不明白，为什么他要象哥伦布发现新大陆一样，一本正经地强调这众所周知的事实。只到近来，她才明白了“女人”这个词的含义，明白了他何以作那么不同寻常的强调。在他眼中，女人不仅意味着人类两性之一，这个词代表着一种价值。并非任何妇女都堪称为女人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But if Sabina was, in Franz's eyes, a woman, then what was his wife, Marie-Claude? More than twenty years earlier, several months after Franz met Marie-Claude, she had threatened to take her life if he abandoned her. Franz was bewitched by the threat. He was not particularly fond of Marie-Claude, but he was very much taken with her love. He felt himself unworthy of so great a love, and felt he owed her a low bow.</p><p>在弗兰茨眼中，如果萨宾娜是一个女人，他妻子克劳迪又是什么呢？二十多年前，结识克劳迪几个月之后，她威胁他说，如果他抛弃她，她便自杀。弗兰茨被她的威胁迷惑了。他并不是特别喜欢克劳迪，但被对方的爱蒙骗了。他感到自己配不上这么伟大的爱，感到自己欠了她一个深深的鞠躬。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He bowed so low that he married her. And even though Marie-Claude never recaptured the emotional intensity that accompanied her suicide threat, in his heart he kept its memory alive with the thought that he must never hurt her and always respect the woman in her.</p><p>他回报鞠躬如此之深竟是娶了她。尽管克劳迪再末重视过那种伴以自杀威胁之词的热烈情感，而他的心中却记忆长存，思虑常驻：决不能伤害她，得永远尊敬她内在的女人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It is an interesting formulation. Not "respect Marie-Claude", but "respect the woman in Marie-Claude". </p><p>这是一个有趣的公式：不是“尊敬克劳迪”，而是“尊敬克劳迪内在的女人”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But if Marie-Claude is herself a woman, then who is that other woman hiding in her, the one he must always respect? The Platonic ideal of a woman, perhaps?</p><p>如果克劳迪本人便是女人，那么谁是他必须永远尊敬的那个隐藏在她身内的女人呢？也许是柏拉图理想中的女人？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>No. His mother. It never would have occurred to him to say he respected the woman in his mother. He worshipped his mother and not some woman inside her. His mother and the Platonic ideal of womanhood were one and the same.</p><p>不。是他的母亲。他决不会想到说，他尊敬他母亲身内的女人。他崇拜母亲，不是母亲身内的什么女人。他的母亲与柏拉图理想中的女人是一回事，全然一致。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When he was twelve, she suddenly found herself alone, abandoned by Franz's father. The boy suspected something serious had happened, but his mother muted the drama with mild, insipid words so as not to upset him. The day his father left, Franz and his mother went into town together, and as they left home Franz noticed that her shoes did not match. He was in a quandary: he wanted to point out her mistake, but was afraid he would hurt her. So during the two hours they spent walking through the city together he kept his eyes fixed on her feet. It was then he had his first inkling of what it means to suffer.</p><p>他十二岁那年，母亲被弗兰茨的父亲抛弃，突然发现自己很孤单。孩子怀疑有什么严重的事发生了，可母亲怕使他不安，用温和而无关紧要的话掩盖了这一幕。父亲走的那一天，弗兰茨和母亲一起进城去。离家时，他发现母亲的鞋子不相称，犹豫不决，想指出她的错误，又怕伤害她。在他与母亲一起在城里走的两个钟头，他的眼睛没有离开过她的脚。这是他第一次体会到难受意昧着什么。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>FIDELITY AND BETRAYAL</p><p>忠诚与背叛</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He loved her from the time he was a child until the time he accompanied her to the cemetery; he loved her in his memories as well. That is what made him feel that fidelity deserved pride of place among the virtues: fidelity gave a unity to lives that would otherwise splinter into thousands of split-second impressions.</p><p>从孩提时代到陪伴她走向墓地，他始终爱她。记忆中的爱也是连绵不绝。这使他感到忠诚在种种美德中应占最高地位：忠诚使众多生命连为一体，否则它们将分裂成千万个瞬间的印痕。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Franz often spoke about his mother to Sabina, perhaps even with a certain unconscious ulterior motive: he assumed that Sabina would be charmed by his ability to be faithful, that it would win her over.</p><p>弗兰茨常跟萨宾娜谈起他母亲，也许他有一种无意识的用心：估摸着萨宾娜会被他忠诚的品行历迷住，那样，他便赢得了她。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>What he did not know was that Sabina was charmed more by betrayal than by fidelity. The word "fidelity" reminded her of her father, a small-town puritan, who spent his Sundays painting away at canvases of woodland sunsets and roses in vases. Thanks to him, she started drawing as a child. When she was fourteen, she fell in love with a boy her age. Her father was so frightened that he would not let her out of the house by herself for a year. One day, he showed her some Picasso reproductions and made fun of them. If she couldn't love her fourteen-year-old schoolboy, she could at least love cubism. After completing school, she went off to Prague with the euphoric feeling that now at last she could betray her home.</p><p>他不知道，更能迷住萨宾娜的不是忠诚而是背叛。“忠诚”这个词使她想起她父亲，一个小镇上的清教徒。连星期天，他都在画布上描画森林里的落日与花瓶中的玫瑰。多亏了他，她从小便开始画画了。十四岁那年，她爱上了一个与她一般年纪的男孩。父亲吓坏了，一年没敢让她独自出门。有一天，他又拿毕加索的复制品给她看，取笑那些画。她不能与她十四岁的同学恋爱，至少是可以爱上立体派的。她完成学业，满心欢快地去了布拉格，感到自己终于能背叛家庭了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Betrayal. From tender youth we are told by father and teacher that betrayal is the most heinous offense imaginable. But what is betrayal? Betrayal means breaking ranks. Betrayal means breaking ranks and going off into the unknown. Sabina knew of nothing more magnificent than going off into the unknown.</p><p>背叛。从我们幼年时代起，父亲和老师就告诫我们，背叛是能够想得到的罪过中最为可恨的一种。可什么是背叛呢？背叛意味着打乱原有的秩序，背叛意味着打乱秩序和进入未知。萨宾娜看不出什么比进入未知状态更奇妙诱人的了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Though a student at the Academy of Fine Arts, she was not allowed to paint like Picasso. It was the period when so-called socialist realism was prescribed and the school manufactured Portraits of Communist statesmen. Her longing to betray her rather remained unsatisfied: Communism was merely another rather, a father equally strict and limited, a father who forbade her love (the times were puritanical) and Picasso, too. And if she married a second-rate actor, it was only because he had a reputation for being eccentric and was unacceptable to both fathers.</p><p>她是美术学院的学生，但不能象毕加索那样画画。这正是所谓社会主义现实主义被规定独尊的时代，是成批制作共产主义政治家们肖像的时代，她要背叛父声的愿望总不能如愿以偿：这种共产主义只不过是另一个父亲罢了。这位父亲同样严格地限制她，同样禁止她的爱（清教徒时代）以及她的毕加索。如果说她终于与一位二流演员结了婚，只是因为那人有着怪汉子的名声，同样不为两种父亲所接受。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Then her mother died. The day following her return to Prague from the funeral, she received a telegram saying that her father had taken his life out of grief.</p><p>随后，母亲去世了。就在她参加葬礼返回布拉格之后，她接到了父亲因悲伤而自杀的电报。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Suddenly she felt pangs of conscience: Was it really so terrible that her father had painted vases filled with roses and hated Picasso? Was it really so reprehensible that he was afraid of his fourteen-year-old daughter's coming home pregnant? Was it really so laughable that he could not go on living without his wife?</p><p>她突然感到良心的痛苦：那位画花瓶玫瑰和憎恶毕加索的父亲真是那么可怕吗？担心自己十四岁的女儿会未婚怀孕回家真是那么值得斥责吗？失去妻子便无法再生活下去真是那么可笑吗？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And again she felt a longing to betray: betray her own betrayal. She announced to her husband (whom she now considered a difficult drunk rather than an eccentric) that she was leaving him.</p><p>她又一次渴望背叛：背叛自己的背叛。她向丈夫宣布，她要离开他。（她现在与其把他看成一个怪人不如说把他看作于今不能自拔的醉鬼。）</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But if we betray B., for whom we betrayed A., it does not necessarily follow that we have placated A. The life of a divorcee-painter did not in the least resemble the life of the parents she had betrayed. The first betrayal is irreparable. It calls forth a chain reaction of further betrayals, each of which takes us farther and farther away from the point of our original betrayal.</p><p>但是，如果我们背叛乙，是为了我们曾经背叛了的甲，那倒不一定意味着我们抚慰了甲。一个离了婚的画家，其生活与她背叛了的父母的生活丝毫不相似。第一次的背叛不可弥补，它唤来的只是后面一连串背叛的连锁反应，每一次的背叛都使我们离最初的反叛越来越远。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>MUSIC</p><p>音乐</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>For Franz music was the art that comes closest to Dionysian beauty in the sense of intoxication. No one can get really drunk on a novel or a painting, but who can help getting drunk on Beethoven's Ninth, Bartok's Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion, or the Beatles' White Album? Franz made no distinction between classical music and pop. He found the distinction old-fashioned and hypocritical. He loved rock as much as Mozart.</p><p>对弗兰茨来说，音乐能使人迷醉，是一种最接近于酒神狄俄尼索斯之类的艺术。没有谁真正沉醉于一本小说或一幅画，但谁能克制住不沉醉于贝多芬的第九交响乐、巴脱克的钢琴二重奏鸣曲、打击乐以及“硬壳虫”乐队的白色唱片集呢？弗兰茨对古典音乐和流行音乐无所区分，认为这种区分实在过时而虚假。他象爱莫扎特一样爱摇滚乐。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He considered music a liberating force: it liberated him from loneliness, introversion, the dust of the library; it opened the door of his body and allowed his soul to step out into the world to make friends. He loved to dance and regretted that Sabina did not share his passion.</p><p>他认为音乐是一种解放的力量，把他从孤独、内省以及图书馆的尘埃中解放了出来，打开了他身体的大门，让他的灵魂走人世间，获得友谊。他爱跳舞，遗憾萨宾娜没有他那样的热情。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They were sitting together at a restaurant, and loud music with a heavy beat poured out of a nearby speaker as they ate.</p><p>他们一起坐在餐厅里，吃饭时听到附近喇叭里传出轰轰的音乐并伴有重重的打击声响。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It's a vicious circle," Sabina said. "People are going deaf because music is played louder and louder. But because they're going deaf, it has to be played louder still." </p><p>“真是恶性循环，”萨宾娜说，“音乐越放越响，人会变成聋子。因为他们变聋，音乐声才不得不更响。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Don't you like music? Franz asked.</p><p>“你不喜欢音乐吗？”弗兰茨问。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No," said Sabina, and then added:"though in a different era…" She was thinking of the days of Johann Sebastian Bach, when music was like a rose blooming on a boundless snow-covered plain of silence.</p><p>“不喜欢。”她又补充，“不过在一个不同的时代里……”她想着巴赫的时代，那时的音乐就象玫瑰盛开在雪原般的无边无际的寂静之上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Noise masked as music had pursued her since early childhood. During her years at the Academy of Fine Arts, students had been required to spend whole summer vacations at a youth camp. They lived in common quarters and worked together on a steelworks construction site. Music roared out of loudspeakers on the site from five in the morning to nine at night. She felt like crying, but the music was cheerful, and there was nowhere to hide, not in the latrine or under the bedclothes: everything was in range of the speakers. The music was like a pack of hounds that had been sicked on her.</p><p>从童年起她开始追求音乐，就领受着噪音妨碍。在美术学院那几年，学生们整个暑假都要求在青年港地度过。他们住在一色的屋子里，一起去钢厂建锻工地劳动，工地上高音喇叭里的音乐从早上五点直吼到晚上九点。尽管乐曲是欢快的，但她感到好象是哭嚎。没有什么地方可以躲避，即使躲进公共厕所，躲入被褥。任何地方都有喇叭。那声音象一群猎狗一直骚挠着她的安宁。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>At the time, she had thought that only in the Communist world could such musical barbarism reign supreme. Abroad, she discovered that the transformation of music into noise was a planetary process by which mankind was entering the historical phase of total ugliness. The total ugliness to come had made itself felt first as omnipresent acoustical ugliness: cars, motorcycles, electric guitars, drills, loudspeakers, sirens. The omnipresence of visual ugliness would soon follow.</p><p>那时她想，只有在那里才有这样专横的音乐统治。到了国外，她才发现把音乐变为噪音是一个必经的过程，人类由此而进入了完全丑陋的历史阶段。完全丑陋的到来，首先表现在无所不在的听觉丑陋：汽车，摩托，电吉他，电钻，高音喇叭，汽笛……而无所不在的视觉丑陋将接踵而至。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>After dinner, they went upstairs to their room and made love, and as Franz fell asleep his thoughts began to lose coherence. He recalled the noisy music at dinner and said to himself:"Noise has one advantage. It drowns out words". And suddenly he realized that all his life he had done nothing but talk, write, lecture, concoct sentences, search for formulations and amend them, so in the end no words were precise, their meanings were obliterated, their content lost, they turned into trash, chaff, dust, sand; prowling through his brain, tearing at his head, they were his insomnia, his illness. And what he yearned for at that moment, vaguely but with all his might, was unbounded music, absolute sound, a pleasant and happy all-encompassing, overpowering, window-rattling din to engulf, once and for all, the pain, the futility, the vanity of words. Music was the negation of sentences, music was the anti-word! He yearned for one long embrace with Sabina, yearned never to say another sentence, another word, to let his orgasm fuse with the orgiastic thunder of music. And lulled by that blissful imaginary uproar, he fell asleep.</p><p>饭后，他们上楼去自己房里做爱。弗兰茨入睡时思维已开始失去了连贯性，回想起吃饭时噪杂的音乐声，对自己说：“噪音可有个好处，淹没了词语。”他突然意识到他一生什么也没有干，只是谈话，写作，讲课，编句子，找出公式然后修正它们，到头来呢，文字全不准确，意思皆被淹没，内容统统丧失，它们变成了废话，废料，灰尘，砂石，在他的大脑里反复排徊，在他的头颅里分崩离析，它们成了他的失眠症，他的病。所以，在那一刻，他朦朦胧胧却全心全意期待着的是没有任何束缚的音乐，是一种绝对的声音。它包容着一切愉悦与欢乐，它是超强音，是窗户发出的格格震荡，将一劳永逸地吞没他的痛苦，无聊，以及空洞的词语。音乐是对句子的否定，是一种反词语！他期望与萨宾娜久久地拥抱，不再说一句话，不再讲一个宇，让这音乐的狂欢之雷与他的性高潮吻合在一点。然后，幻想中的极乐喧嚣终于象催眠曲一样，使他睡着了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>LIGHT AND DARKNESS</p><p>光明与黑暗</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Living for Sabina meant seeing. Seeing is limited by two borders: strong light, which blinds, and total darkness. Perhaps that was what motivated Sabina's distaste for all extremism. Extremes mean borders beyond which life ends, and a passion for extremism, in art and in politics, is a veiled longing for death.</p><p>对萨宾娜来说，生活就意昧着观看。观看被两条界线局限着，一种是强光，使人看不见，另一种是彻底的黑暗。也许这就是萨宾娜厌恶一切极端主义的原因。极端主义意味着生命范围的边界。不论艺术上或政治上的极端主义激情，是一种掩盖着的找死的渴望。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In Franz the word "light" did not evoke the picture of a landscape basking in the soft glow of day; it evoked the source of light itself: the sun, a light bulb, a spotlight. Franz's associations were familiar metaphors: the sun of righteousness, the lambent flame of the intellect, and so on.</p><p>在弗兰茨那里，“光明”不会与某张日暖风和的风景画相联系，而会使他想起光源本身：太阳，灯泡，聚光灯。弗兰茨的联想总是一些熟悉的比喻，如：正直的太阳，理智的光辉，等等。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Darkness attracted him as much as light. He knew that these days turning out the light before making love was considered laughable, and so he always left a small lamp burning over the bed. At the moment he penetrated Sabina, however, he closed his eyes. The pleasure suffusing his body called for darkness. That darkness was pure, perfect, thoughtless, visionless; that darkness was without end, without borders; that darkness was the infinite we each carry within us. (Yes, if you're looking for infinity, just close your eyes!)</p><p>黑暗如同光明一样地吸引他。这些天来，他知道做爱前关掉灯委实可笑，总是留一盏小灯照着床。然而，他深入萨宾娜的那一刻，却合上了眼睛，渗透了全身的快乐呼唤着黑暗。黑暗是纯净的，完美的，没有思想，没有梦幻；这种黑暗无止无尽，无边无际；这种黑暗就是我们各人自身历带来的无限。（是的，如果你要寻找无限，只要合上你的眼睛！）</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And at the moment he felt pleasure suffusing his body, Franz himself disintegrated and dissolved into the infinity of his darkness, himself becoming infinite. But the larger a man grows in his own inner darkness, the more his outer form diminishes. A man with closed eyes is a wreck of a man. Then, Sabina found the sight of Franz distasteful, and to avoid looking at him she too closed her eyes. But for her, darkness did not mean infinity; for her, it meant a disagreement with what she saw, the negation of what was seen, the refusal to see.</p><p>在他全身浸透快乐的一脚间，弗兰茨自己崩溃了，融化在黑暗的无限之中。自己变成了无限。一个人在他内在的黑暗中长得越大，他的外在形态就变得越小。一个闭着眼睛的人，便是一个受到毁伤的人。萨宾娜发现弗兰茨的模样乏味无趣，也闭上眼避免去看他。但是对她来说，黑暗并不意昧着无限，却意味着观看事物时的不满，被看事物的否定，以及拒绝观看。</p></div>

<div class='layout'><p>Sabina once allowed herself to be taken along to a gathering of fellow emigres. As usual, they were hashing over whether they should or should not have taken up arms against the Russians. In the safety of emigration, they all naturally came out in favor of fighting. Sabina said: "Then why don't you go back and fight?" </p><p>萨宾娜有一次让自己参加了移民朋友的聚会。象往常一样，他们又在反复推敲他们应该或不应该拿起武器去反苏。身处安全的移民生活中，他们自然显得乐意战斗。萨宾娜说：“你们为什么不回去打仗呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>That was not the thing to say. A man with artificially waved gray hair pointed a long index finger at her. "That's no way to talk. You're all responsible for what happened. You, too. How did you oppose the Communist regime? All you did was paint pictures..." </p><p>话说得不合时宜。一位烫着灰色卷发的男人，用长长的食指指着她：“这可不是说话的样子。你们都对所发生的一切负责。你也是。反对共产党当局你做了什么？你做的也只是画画儿……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Assessing the populace, checking up on it, is a principal and never-ending social activity in Communist countries. If a painter is to have an exhibition, an ordinary citizen to receive a visa to a country with a sea coast, a soccer player to join the national team, then a vast array of recommendations and reports must be garnered (from the concierge, colleagues, the police, the local Party organization, the pertinent trade union) and added up, weighed, and summarized by special officials. These reports have nothing to do with artistic talent, kicking ability, or maladies that respond well to salt sea air; they deal with one thing only: "the citizen's political profile" (in other words, what the citizen says, what he thinks, how he behaves, how he acquits himself at meetings or May Day parades). Because everything (day-to-day existence, promotion at work, vacations) depends on the outcome of the assessment process, everyone (whether he wants to play soccer for the national team, have an exhibition, or spend his holidays at the seaside) must behave in such a way as to deserve a favorable assessment.</p><p>在萨宾娜的国家里，评价和检查老百姓司空见惯己成原则，本身就是无休无止的社会活动。如果某个画家要办个展览，一位普通公民要领取去国外海滩旅行的签证，或一个足球运动员要参加国家队，那么马上可以收集到一大批推荐信或报告（从门房、同事、警察、地方党组织以及有关工会那里来的），由专门的官员将此综合，补充，总结。这些报告与美术才华、踢球技巧、或需要咸腥海洋空气的疾病毫无关系，它们只说明一个问题：“公民的政治情况”。（用另一句话说就是，这位公民说过什么，想过什么，行为如何，在五一游行集会中表现如何。）每一件事（一天天的生存，工作中的升迁，度假）都有赖于这种评价过程的结果，因此每一个人（无论他是否要为国连队踢球，或是否获准展览作品，是否去海滩度假），都必须蹈规蹈矩努力表现以取得优良的评价。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>That was what ran through Sabina's mind as she listened to the gray-haired man speak. He didn't care whether his fellow-countrymen were good kickers or painters (none of the Czechs at the emigre gathering ever showed any interest in what Sabina painted); he cared whether they had opposed Communism actively or just passively, really and truly or just for appearances' sake, from the very beginning or just since emigration.</p><p>这就是萨宾娜听到灰头发男人讲话时所想到的。他不关心他的同胞们是否足球运动员或画家（在这一群移民中，没有一个捷克人对萨宾娜的作品表示过任何兴趣）；只关心他们是否反对共产主义，积极地或消极地？真正实在地或是表面地？从一开始就反对还是从移居国外以后？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Because she was a painter, she had an eye for detail and a memory for the physical characteristics of the people in Prague who had a passion for assessing others. All of them had index fingers slightly longer than their middle fingers and pointed them at whomever they happened to be talking to. In fact, President Novotny, who had ruled the country for the fourteen years preceding 1968, sported the very same barber-induced gray waves and had the longest index finger of all the inhabitants of Central Europe.</p><p>她是一个画家，曾经细心留意并记住了那些对调查别人满有热情的布拉格人的生理特征。他们都有比中指稍长一些的食指，并且爱用它去指那些偶然与他们谈谈话的人。事实上，直到1968年，统治了这个国家十四年的总统诺沃提尼，正是曾经掀动着与其酷似的这种理发店里做出来的波浪灰发，用最长的食指指向中欧所有的居民。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When the distinguished emigre heard from the lips of a painter whose pictures he had never seen that he resembled Communist President Novotny, he turned scarlet, then white, then scarlet again, then white once more; he tried to say something, did not succeed, and fell silent. Everyone else kept silent until Sabina stood up and left.</p><p>这位尊贵显眼的移民不曾看过萨宾娜的画，从画家嘴里听说他象诺沃提尼，脸变得排红，自一阵，又红一阵，最后转为掺白。他想说什么，什么也没说出来，只得沉默。直到萨宾娜站起来离开，大家也都沉默着。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It made her unhappy, and down in the street she asked herself why she should bother to maintain contact with Czechs. What bound her to them? The landscape? If each of them were asked to say what the name of his native country evoked in him, the images that came to mind would be so different as to rule out all possibility of unity.</p><p>这使她很不高兴。走到街上，她问自己为什么要费那么多心思与捷克人保持接触。她与他们有什么关系？是地域吗？如果问他们中的每一个人，祖国的名字在他们心目中将引起何种联想，各人头脑闪现的国土状貌肯定迥异，整一的可能势必勾销。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Or the culture? But what was that? Music? Dvorak and Janacek? Yes. But what if a Czech had no feeling for music? Then the essence of being Czech vanished into thin air.</p><p>那么是文化吗？可什么是文化？音乐吗？德沃夏克和雅那切克吗？是的。但如果一个捷克人没有音乐感受又怎么办？这样，做捷克人的实质意义便烟消雾逝。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Or great men? Jan Hus? None of the people in that room had ever read a line of his works. The only thing they were all able to understand was the flames, the glory of the flames when he was burned at the stake, the glory of the ashes, so for them the essence of being Czech came down to ashes and nothing more. The only things that held them together were their defeats and the reproaches they addressed to one another.</p><p>那么是伟人吗？是胡斯？刚才房子里的人都没有读过他的一页书。他们能理解的事只是那火焰，他被烧死在火刑柱上时那光辉的火焰，那光荣的灰烬。于是，对于他们来说，身为捷克人的实质意义除了灰烬，再没有什么。唯一能使他们聚合在一起的东西，便是他们的失败与他们的相互指责。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She was walking fast. She was more disturbed by her own thoughts than by her break with the emigres. She knew she was being unfair. There were other Czechs, after all, people quite different from the man with the long index finger. The embarrassed silence that followed her little speech did not by any means indicate they were all against her. No, they were probably bewildered by the sudden hatred, the lack of understanding they were all subjected to in emigration. Then why wasn't she sorry for them? Why didn't she see them for the woeful and abandoned creatures they were?</p><p>她走得很快，与那些移民分裂的想法更使她不安。她知道自己是不公正的，毕竟还有另一些捷克人，与那有长长食指的人完全不一样。何况她那段小议论后的难堪沉默，也没有表明他们都反对她。没有，他们也许是被这突然的愤怒搞昏了头，没有理解他们都是受制于移民生活的人。那么为什么她不原谅他们？为什么不把他们都看成可怜的被抛弃了的上帝之造物？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>We know why. After she betrayed her father, life opened up before her, a long road of betrayals, each one attracting her as vice and victory. She would not keep ranks! She refused to keep ranks—always with the same people, with the same speeches! That was why she was so stirred by her own injustice. But it was not an unpleasant feeling; quite the contrary, Sabina had the impression she had just scored a victory and someone invisible was applauding her for it.</p><p>我们知道为什么。她背叛了她的父亲，生活便向她敞开了背叛的漫漫长途。每一个吸引她的背叛是罪恶也是胜利。她不愿意遵守秩序；她拒绝服从秩序——拒绝永远和同样的人在一起讲同样的话！这就是她被自己的不公平所困扰的原因。但这并非心情不悦，恰恰相反，萨宾娜的印象中，这是一次胜利，有看不见的人还在为她热烈鼓掌。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Then suddenly the intoxication gave way to anguish: The road had to end somewhere! Sooner or later she would have to put an end to her betrayals! Sooner or later she would have to stop herself!</p><p>自我陶醉一瞬间滑向极度痛苦：漫漫长途总有尽头！迟早她不得不结束自己的背叛！迟早她不得不结束她自己！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was evening and she was hurrying through the railway station. The train to Amsterdam was in. She found her coach. Guided by a friendly guard, she opened the door to her compartment and found Franz sitting on a couchette. He rose to greet her; she threw her arms around him and smothered him with kisses.</p><p>这正是晚上，她匆忙穿过火车站，一列去阿姆斯特丹的火车进站了。她上了车，在乘警友好的指引下，打开包厢的门，发现弗兰茨坐在卧铺上。他站起来迎接她，她伸出双臂抱任了他，吻得他透不过气来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She had an overwhelming desire to tell him, like the most banal of women, Don't let me go, hold me tight, make me your plaything, your slave, be strong! But they were words she could not say.</p><p>她象最平庸的女人一样，有一种焚心烈火般的欲望，想告诉他，别赶我走，抱紧我，把我当你的玩物，你的奴隶，猛烈地玩弄我吧！但她什么也没说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The only thing she said when he released her from his embrace was:"You don't know how happy I am to be with you." That was the most her reserved nature allowed her to express.</p><p>她从对方的拥抱中松脱出来，只说了一句话：“你不知道，我和你在一起是多么高兴呀。”这是她的天性允许她作的最多的表示了。</p></div>

<div class='layout'><p>A Short Dictionary of Misunderstood Words (continued}</p><p>误解小辞典（继续）</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>PARADES</p><p>游行</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>People in Italy or France have it easy. When their parents force them to go to church, they get back at them by joining the Party (Communist, Maoist, Trotskyist, etc.). Sabina, however, was first sent to church by her father, then forced by him to attend meetings of the Communist Youth League. He was afraid of what would happen if she stayed away.</p><p>游行对意大利和法国人来说很容易。他们被父母逼着去教堂时，便以参加党派作为报复（共产党，毛泽东党，托洛茨基党等等）。然而萨宾娜的父亲两头都不误，开始送她去教堂，而后又逼她参加共青团会议。他担心女儿游离组织之外将有所不测。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When she marched in the obligatory May Day parades, she could never keep in step, and the girl behind her would shout at her and purposely tread on her heels. When the time came to sing, she never knew the words of the songs and would merely open and close her mouth. But the other girls would notice and report her. From her youth on, she hated parades.</p><p>她参加强制性的游行，总是合不上大家的步伐，身后的女孩老对她叫，或者有意踩她的脚后跟。唱歌时，她从来就不知道歌词，只是把嘴巴张张合合，于是遭到其他女孩子的注意和告发。从小，她就恨游行。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Franz had studied in Paris, and because he was extraordinarily gifted his scholarly career was assured from the time he was twenty. At twenty, he knew he would live out his life within the confines of his university office, one or two libraries, and two or three lecture halls. The idea of such a life made him feel suffocated. He yearned to step out of his life the way one steps out of a house into the street.</p><p>弗兰茨曾就读巴黎，天资不凡，二十岁那年就确定了学者生涯。从二十岁起，他便知道自己一生将会被局限在大学办公室、一两所图书馆，或两三个演讲厅里。想到这种生活将把他窒息，他总是期望着走出自己的生活圈子，象从屋里走向大街。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And so as long as he lived in Paris, he took part in every possible demonstration. How nice it was to celebrate something, demand something, protest against something; to be out in the open, to be with others. The parades filing down the Boulevard Saint-Germain or from the Place de la Republique to the Bastille fascinated him. He saw the marching, shouting crowd as the image of Europe and its history. Europe was the Grand March. The march from revolution to revolution, from struggle to struggle, ever onward.</p><p>住在巴黎期间，他参加了每一次可能的游行示威，去庆祝什么，要求什么，或抗议什么，去露天里和人们呆在一起。游行的队伍直抵圣耶门大街或从共和广场到巴士底，使他神魂颠倒。他把行进和呼喊看成欧洲以及欧洲史的形象。欧洲就是伟大的进军，从革命到革命，从斗争到斗争，永远向前。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I might put it another way: Franz felt his book life to be unreal. He yearned for real life, for the touch of people walking side by side with him, for their shouts. It never occurred to him that what he considered unreal (the work he did in the solitude of the office or library) was in fact his real life, whereas the parades he imagined to be reality were nothing but theater, dance, carnival—in other words, a dream.</p><p>换一种方式说：弗兰茨感到他的书本生活不真实，他渴望真实的生活，渴望与人们交往，肩并肩地步行，渴望他们的呼叫。他从没有想过他所认为的不真实生活（在与世隔绝的办公室或图书室里辛劳）事实上正是他的真实生活，而他想象为真实的游行不是别的，只是戏院，舞场，狂欢——用另一句话来说，是一个梦。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>During her studies, Sabina lived in a dormitory. On May Day all the students had to report early in the morning for the parade. Student officials would comb the building to ensure that no one was missing. Sabina hid in the lavatory. Not until long after the building was empty would she go back to her room. It was quieter than anywhere she could remember. The only sound was the parade music echoing in the distance. It was as though she had found refuge inside a shell and the only sound she could hear was the sea of an inimical world.</p><p>萨宾娜读书时佐在宿舍里。五一节，所有的学生大清早都得报到参加游行，学生干部们清梳大楼以保无人漏掉。萨宾娜躲进电梯间，直到大楼都走空很久了，才能回到自己的房间。这里比她记忆里的任何地方都安静，唯一的声音是远处游行音乐的回响。她仿佛正躲在一个小棚屋里避难，只能听到一个敌对世界的海涛喧嚣。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>A year or two after emigrating, she happened to be in Paris on the anniversary of the Russian invasion of her country. A protest march had been scheduled, and she felt driven to take part. Fists raised high, the young Frenchmen shouted out slogans condemning Soviet imperialism. She liked the slogans, but to her surprise she found herself unable to shout along with them. She lasted no more than a few minutes in the parade.</p><p>移居一两年后，她偶尔去巴黎参加祖国被入侵的周年纪念。抗议游行当然在计划之列，她当然也被卷了进去。年轻的法国人高高举起拳头，喊着谴责社会帝国主义的口号。她喜欢这些口号，但使她惊奇的是，她发现自己不能够跟着他们一起喊。她只坚持了几分钟便离开了游行队伍。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When she told her French friends about it, they were amazed. "You mean you don't want to fight the occupation of your country?" She would have liked to tell them that behind Communism, Fascism, behind all occupations and invasions lurks a more basic, pervasive evil and that the image of that evil was a parade of people marching by with raised fists and shouting identical syllables in unison. But she knew she would never be able to make them understand. Embarrassed, she changed the subject.</p><p>她向法国朋友们说起这件事，他们都很惊讶。“你的意思是说你不同意反对对你们国家的占领？”她本来想告诉他们，在共产党当局和法西斯主义的后面，在所有占领与入侵的后面，潜在着更本质更普遍的邪恶，这邪恶的形象就是人们举着拳头，众口一声地喊着同样的口号的齐步游行。但她知道自己永远也没法使别人明白这些，便尴尴尬尬地改变了话题。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"THE BEAUTY OF NEW YORK"</p><p>“纽约的美”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Franz and Sabina would walk the streets of New York for hours at a time. The view changed with each step, as if they were following a winding mountain path surrounded by breathtaking scenery: a young man kneeling in the middle of the sidewalk praying;a few steps away, a beautiful black woman leaning against a tree; a man in a black suit directing an invisible orchestra while crossing the street; a fountain spurting water and a group of construction workers sitting on the rim eating lunch; strange iron ladders running up and down buildings with ugly red facades, so ugly that they were beautiful; and next door, a huge glass skyscraper backed by another, itself topped by a small Arabian pleasure-dome with turrets, galleries, and gilded columns.</p><p>弗兰茨与萨宾娜在纽约街上一定就是几个小时。每走一步都有新鲜的景观，如同他们是循着一条山林小道前行，沿途景色都令人惊叹不已：一位年轻人跪在人行道中祈祷；几步之外是一位漂亮的黑人妇女靠着一棵树；一位身穿黑制服的男人横过马路时指挥着一支无形的乐队；一个喷泉在喷水而一群建筑工人坐在喷泉边上吃午饭；一些奇怪的铁梯上上下下爬满建筑还配有丑陋的红栏杆，丑到极致也就显得美妙；再定过去，是一座巨大的玻璃墙面的摩天大楼，后面又是比肩而立的一座，楼顶带有小型的阿拉伯式游乐厅，有塔楼，游廊，还有镀金圆柱。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She was reminded of her paintings. There, too, incongruous things came together: a steelworks construction site superimposed on a kerosene lamp; an old-fashioned lamp with a painted-glass shade shattered into tiny splinters and rising up over a desolate landscape of marshland.</p><p>她想起了自己的画。也是一些极不调和的东西混在一起：钢厂的建设工地上添了一盏煤油灯；一盏带着彩画玻璃灯罩的旧式灯破成了细细的碎片，撤落在荒凉的沼泽地。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Franz said:"Beauty in the European sense has always had a premeditated quality to it. We've always had an aesthetic intention and a long-range plan. That's what enabled Western man to spend decades building a Gothic cathedral or a Renaissance piazza. The beauty of New York rests on a completely different base. It's unintentional. It arose independent of human design, like a stalagmitic cavern. Forms which are in themselves quite ugly turn up fortuitously, without design, in such incredible surroundings that they sparkle with a sudden wondrous poetry." </p><p>弗兰茨说，“欧洲人意识中的美总带有预先规定的尺度，我们总是有一种审美的目的和一个长远计划。就是这个东西，使西方人花了几十年去修建哥特式大教堂或文艺复兴时期风格的广场。纽约的美呢，建立在完全不同的基础上。它没有目的，不需要人的设计，就象石笋状溶洞。它那些丑陋形式是偶然产生的，没有设计的。在这样不可思议的外围环境中，它们突然闪耀出奇异的诗意。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sabina said:"Unintentional beauty. Yes. Another way of putting it might be 'beauty by mistake.' Before beauty disappears entirely from the earth, it will go on existing for a while by mistake. 'Beauty by mistake'—the final phase in the history of beauty." </p><p>萨宾娜说：“没有目的的美。说得对。换一种说法，可以是‘错误的美’。世界上的美整个儿消失以前，美还会依赖着失误而存在一阵子。‘错误的美’——这是美的历史上最后一个阶段。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And she recalled her first mature painting, which came into being because some red paint had dripped on it by mistake. Yes, her paintings were based on "beauty by mistake", and New York was the secret but authentic homeland of her painting.</p><p>她回想起自己第一幅成熟的作品，它的产生也是由于错误地滴了一滴红颜料。是的，她的作品都基于“错误的美”，纽约是她作品的神秘而可靠的祖国。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Franz said:"Perhaps New York's unintentional beauty is much richer and more varied than the excessively strict and composed beauty of human design. But it's not our European beauty. It's an alien world." </p><p>弗兰茨说：“也许人们设计出来的美过于严格和冷静，纽约无目的美比它要丰富多变，但这不是我们欧洲人的美，是一个异己陌生的世界。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Didn't they then at last agree on something?</p><p>他们最终谈拢了吗？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>No. There is a difference. Sabina was very much attracted by the alien quality of New York's beauty. Franz found it intriguing but frightening; it made him feel homesick for Europe.</p><p>没有，看法仍然迥异。萨宾娜被纽约美的异生品格所深深吸引，而弗兰茨觉得这种美新奇却可怕，他眷眷地思念起欧洲来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>SABINA'S COUNTRY</p><p>萨宾娜的国家</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sabina understood Franz's distaste for America. He was the embodiment of Europe: his mother was Viennese, his father French, and he himself was Swiss.</p><p>萨宾娜理解弗兰茨对美国的乏味感。他是欧洲的化身：母亲是维也纳人，父亲是法国人，而他自己是瑞士人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Franz greatly admired Sabina's country. Whenever she told him about herself and her friends from home, Franz heard the words "prison", "persecution", "enemy tanks", "emigration", "pamphlets", "banned books", "banned exhibitions", and he felt a curious mixture of envy and nostalgia.</p><p>弗兰茨极其羡慕萨宾娜的国家。无论什么时候，她谈起自己以及国内来的朋友，弗兰茨听到“监狱”、“迫害”、“敌方坦克”“移民”、“宣传品”、“禁书”、“非法展览”这类名词，就油然生出一种羡慕加向往的复杂好奇感。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He made a confession to Sabina. "A philosopher once wrote that everything in my work is unverifiable speculation and called me a 'pseudo-Socrates.' I felt terribly humiliated and made a furious response. And just think, that laughable episode was the greatest conflict I've ever experienced! The pinnacle of the dramatic possibilities available to my life! We live in two different dimensions, you and I. You came into my life like Gulliver entering the land of the Lilliputians." </p><p>他对萨宾娜承认：“有个哲学家曾在文章里说我著作中一切论点都是无法验证的推测，称我为‘冒牌的苏格拉底’，我当时感到莫大的侮辱，狠狠发了一通火。现在一想，这可笑的插曲也算是我经历中最大的打击！是我一生中戏剧性的种种可能的顶峰！我们俩，你和我，生活在不同的两维，你进入我的生活，就象格列佛进入了小人国的领地。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sabina protested. She said that conflict, drama, and tragedy didn't mean a thing; there was nothing inherently valuable in them, nothing deserving of respect or admiration. What was truly enviable was Franz's work and the fact that he had the peace and quiet to devote himself to it.</p><p>萨宾娜给以反驳，她说打击、悲剧以及戏剧性事件不意味着什么，没有任何内在的价值，不值得尊敬和羡慕。真正值得羡慕的是弗兰茨的工作以及他能平静安宁地献身于此。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Franz shook his head. "When a society is rich, its people don't need to work with their hands; they can devote themselves to activities of the spirit. We have more and more universities and more and more students. If students are going to earn degrees, they've got to come up with dissertation topics. And since dissertations can be written about everything under the sun, the number of topics is infinite. Sheets of paper covered with words pile up in archives sadder than cemeteries, because no one ever visits them, not even on All Souls' Day. Culture is perishing in overproduction, in an avalanche of words, in the madness of quantity. That's why one banned book in your former country means infinitely more than the billions of words spewed out by our universities." </p><p>弗兰茨摇摇头：“一个社会富裕了，人们就不必双手劳作，可以投身精神活动。我们有越来越多的大学和越来越多的学生。学生们要拿学位，就得写—写学位论文。既然论文能写天下万物，论文题目便是无限。那些写满宇的稿纸车载斗量，堆在比墓地更可悲的档案库里。即使在万灵节，也没有人去光顾他们。文化正在死去，死于过剩的生产中，文字的浩瀚堆积中，数量的疯狂增长中。这就是贵国的一本禁书比我们大学中滔滔万卷宏论意义大得无比的原因。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It is in this spirit that we may understand Franz's weakness for revolution. First he sympathized with Cuba, then with China, and when the cruelty of their regimes began to appall him, he resigned himself with a sigh to a sea of words with no weight and no resemblance to life. </p><p>从这种精神出发，我们才能理解弗兰茨对革命的软弱性。他最开始同情古巴，然后同情中国，被这些国家的残酷吓坏了后，只得叹口气，沉入文字的海洋，沉入没有分量亦远离生活的词句。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He became a professor in Geneva (where there are no demonstrations), and in a burst of abnegation (in womanless, paradeless solitude) he published several scholarly books, all of which received considerable acclaim. </p><p>他成了日内瓦的一名教授（那里没有示威游行），在一连串的克制中（无女人亦无游行的孤独），他发表了好些学术专著，都获得了可观的赞扬。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Then one day along came Sabina. She was a revelation. She came from a land where revolutionary illusion had long since faded but where the thing he admired most in revolution remained: life on a large scale; a life of risk, daring, and the danger of death. Sabina had renewed his faith in the grandeur of human endeavor. Superimposing the painful drama of her country on her person, he found her even more beautiful.</p><p>后来有一天他遇到了萨宾娜。她是个新的发现。她来自一片土地，那里革命的幻觉早已褪色，但革命中他最崇拜的东西还存留着：广阔的生活，冒险的生涯，敢作敢为，还有死的危险。他把她祖国的悲剧加在她身上，发现她显得更加美丽。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The trouble was that Sabina had no love for that drama. The words "prison", "persecution", "banned books", "occupation", "tanks" were ugly, without the slightest trace of romance. The only word that evoked in her a sweet, nostalgic memory of her homeland was the word "cemetery". </p><p>糟糕的是萨宾娜对这出悲剧并不喜爱。“监狱”、“迫害”、“禁书”、“占领”、“坦克”一类词是丑陋的，没有丝毫浪漫气息。唯一使她感觉甜美引起思乡之情的词，是“墓地”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>CEMETERY</p><p>墓地</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Cemeteries in Bohemia are like gardens. The graves are covered with grass and colorful flowers. Modest tombstones are lost in the greenery. When the sun goes down, the cemetery sparkles with tiny candles. It looks as though the dead are dancing at a children's ball. </p><p>波希米亚的墓地都象花园，坟墓上覆盖着绿草和鲜艳的花朵。一块块庄严的墓碑隐没在万绿丛中。太阳落山的时候，墓地闪烁着点点烛火，如同死魂都在孩子们的晚会上舞蹈。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Yes, a children's ball, because the dead are as innocent as children. No matter how brutal life becomes, peace always reigns in the cemetery. Even in wartime, in Hitler's time, in Stalin's time, through all occupations. </p><p>是的，孩子们的舞会。死魂都象孩子一样纯洁。无论现实生活如何残酷，即便在战争年月，在希特勒时期，在斯大林时期，在所有被占领的时期，和平总是统治着墓地。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When she felt low, she would get into the car, leave Prague far behind, and walk through one or another of the country cemeteries she loved so well. </p><p>她感到心绪低落的时候，便坐上汽车远离布拉格，去她如此喜爱的某个乡间墓地走走。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Against a backdrop of blue hills, they were as beautiful as a lullaby.</p><p>在蓝色群山的背景下，它们如摇篮曲一般美丽。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>For Franz a cemetery was an ugly dump of stones and bones.</p><p>对弗兰茨来说，墓地只是一堆丑陋的石块与尸骨。</p></div>

<div class='layout'><p>"I'd never drive. I'm scared stiff of accidents! Even if they don't kill you, they mark you for life!" And so saying, the sculptor made an instinctive grab for the finger he had nearly chopped off one day while whittling away at a wood statue. It was a miracle the finger had been saved.</p><p>“我从不开车，车祸吓死人！就算没把你撞死，也让你留个终身标记！”正说着，雕刻家本能地抓住了自己的手指头，那指头有一天在他雕刻本版时差点给削掉了，现在还留在手上也算个奇迹。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What do you mean?" said Marie-Claude in a raucous voice. She was in top form. "I was in a serious accident once, and I wouldn't have missed it for the world. And I've never had more fun than when I was in that hospital! I couldn't sleep a wink, so I just read and read, day and night."</p><p>“你说什么？”克劳迪今天状态最佳，沙哑着声音问，“我有一回碰上了严重车祸，我就没把命丢掉。再说，没有比住医院更有味的啦！我根本睡不着，只是读呀读的，日日夜夜。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They all looked at her in amazement. She basked in it. </p><p>他们都惊奇地看着她，更使她其乐融融。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Franz reacted with a mixture of disgust (he knew that after the accident in question his wife had fallen into a deep depression and complained incessantly) and admiration (her ability to transform everything she experienced was a sign of true vitality).</p><p>弗兰茨感到一种既讨厌（他知道那场车祸后妻子曾极度消沉又报怨个没完）又佩服（她总是有能力把每一件经历过的事说得有声有色）的复杂情绪。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It was there I began to divide books into day books and night books, she went on. Really, there are books meant for daytime reading and books that can be read only at night."</p><p>“就是在那里，我开始把书分成白天的书和晚上的书，”她继续说，“真的，有些书是要白天读的，有些书只能晚上读。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Now they all looked at her in amazement and admiration, all, that is, but the sculptor, who was still holding his finger and wrinkling his face at the memory of the accident.</p><p>现在，所有的人都又惊奇又崇拜地看着她。所有的人，只除了雕刻家还握着自己的指头，皱着眉头回想车祸。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Marie-Claude turned to him and asked:"Which category would you put Stendhal in?" </p><p>克劳迪转身问他：“司汤达的书你会归进哪一类？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The sculptor had not heard the question and shrugged his shoulders uncomfortably. </p><p>雕刻家没有听清问题，不舒服地耸耸肩。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>An art critic standing next to him said he thought of Stendhal as daytime reading.</p><p>旁边一位文艺批评家说，他认为司汤达的书该白天读。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Marie-Claude shook her head and said in her raucous voice:"No, no, you're wrong! You're wrong! Stendhal is a night author!" </p><p>克劳迪摇了摇头，嘶哑着喉音说：“不，不，你错了，你错啦！司汤达是一位夜晚作家嘛！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Franz's participation in the debate on night art and day art was disturbed by the fact that he was expecting Sabina to show up at any minute. </p><p>弗兰茨置身这场白天夜晚的艺术之争，却不安地盼着萨宾娜到来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They had spent many days pondering whether or not she should accept the invitation to this cocktail party. It was a party Marie-Claude was giving for all painters and sculptors who had ever exhibited in her private gallery. </p><p>他们花了很多天的时间考虑她该不该接受参加这次鸡尾酒宴的邀请。宴会是克劳迪准备的，招待曾经在她私人画廊展出过作品的画家雕刻家们。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Ever since Sabina had met Franz, she had avoided his wife. But because they feared being found out, they came to the conclusion that it would be more natural and therefore less suspicious for her to come.</p><p>萨宾娜遇见弗兰茨以后，总是回避他的妻子。他们又怕被发觉，于是得出结论，认为她来的话反而自然些，少些嫌疑。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>While throwing unobtrusive looks in the direction of the entrance hall, Franz heard his eighteen-year-old daughter, Marie-Anne, holding forth at the other end of the room. </p><p>他一边偷偷地朝门厅打望，一边听到了他十八岁的女儿的声音。女儿安娜在房子的另一端。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Excusing himself from the group presided over by his wife, he made his way to the group presided over by his daughter. Some were in chairs, others standing, but Marie-Anne was cross-legged on the floor. </p><p>他告退了妻子主持的这一圈，挤到女儿主持的那一伙中去。他们有的坐，有的站，安娜则盘腿坐地。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Franz was certain that Marie-Claude would soon switch to the carpet on her side of the room, too. Sitting on the floor when you had guests was at the time a gesture signifying simplicity, informality, liberal politics, hospitality, and a Parisian way of life. </p><p>弗兰茨知道，他妻子肯定也会转移到那边地毯上去的。有客人的时候坐在地毯上，这一姿态表明率直，不拘礼节，政治自由，殷情好客，还体现一种巴黎人的生活方式。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The passion with which Marie-Claude sat on all floors was such that Franz began to worry she would take to sitting on the floor of the shop where she bought her cigarettes.</p><p>克劳迪坐在地毯上的那热情劲儿使弗兰茨担起心来，她去买香烟会不会也坐在铺子的地上？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What are you working on now, Alain?" Marie-Anne asked the man at whose feet she was sitting.</p><p>安娜坐在一个男人的脚上，问他：“阿伦，你最近在干什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Alain was so naive and sincere as to try to give the gallery owner's daughter an honest answer. He started explaining his new approach to her, a combination of photography and oil, but he had scarcely got through three sentences when Marie-Anne began whistling a tune. The painter was speaking slowly and with great concentration and did not hear the whistling. </p><p>阿伦如此天真诚恳，努力给这位画廊主的女儿一个认真回答，开始向她解释自己的新探讨——把摄影与油画结合起来。但他还没讲完三句话，安娜便开始吹起小调来。画家还在慢慢说，注意力高度集中以至于尚未明到口哨。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Will you tell me why you're whistling?" Franz whispered. "Because I don't like to hear people talk about politics," she answered out loud.</p><p>弗兰茨耳语：“你能告诉我你为什么要吹口哨吗？”她大声说：“我不喜欢人们谈政治。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And in fact, two men standing in the same circle were discussing the coming elections in France. Marie-Anne, who felt it her duty to direct the proceedings, asked the men whether they were planning to go to the Rossini opera an Italian company was putting on in Geneva the following week. </p><p>他们这一圈确实有两个人站在那里讨论即将开始的法国大选。自觉有责任引导活动的安娜，问那两个人是否打算去罗西尼歌剧院，一个意大利歌舞团下周将在日内瓦演出。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Meanwhile, Alain the painter sank into greater and greater detail about his new approach to painting. Franz was ashamed for his daughter. To put her in her place, he announced that whenever she went to the opera she complained terribly of boredom.</p><p>与此同时，画家阿伦却沉入他绘画新探求中越来越庞大的细节。弗兰茨为自己的女儿感到羞耻，为了让她安分点，他宣称安娜每次看歌剧都索然无趣牢骚满腹。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“You're awful,” said Marie-Anne, trying to punch him in the stomach from a sitting position. </p><p>“你混！”安娜坐着给了他肚子上一拳。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The star tenor is so handsome. So handsome. I've seen him twice now, and I'm in love with him."</p><p>“那个男高音明星太俊了，太俊啦！我看过他两次，我已经爱上他了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Franz could not get over how much like her mother his daughter was. </p><p>女儿太象她母亲，这使弗兰茨无法原谅。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Why couldn't she be like him? But there was nothing he could do about it. She was not like him. How many times had he heard Marie-Claude proclaim she was in love with this or that painter, singer, writer, politician, and once even with a racing cyclist? </p><p>她为什么不象他？但他毫无办法，她就是不象他。很多次他听到她母亲也宣布爱上了这个或那个画家，歌手，作家，政治家，有一次甚至爱上了一位自行车赛手。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Of course, it was all mere cocktail party rhetoric, but he could not help recalling now and then that more than twenty years ago she had gone about saying the same thing about-him and threatening him with suicide to boot.</p><p>当然，这只是鸡尾酒宴上的闲话趣谈，但他总是忍不住回想起二十多年前她说起他来也如出一辙，还有自杀的威胁之词。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>At that point, Sabina entered the room. Marie-Claude walked up to her. While Marie-Anne went on about Rossini, Franz trained his attention on what the two women were saying. After a few friendly words of greeting, Marie-Claude lifted the ceramic pendant from Sabina's neck and said in a very loud voice, “What is that? How ugly!” </p><p>正在这时，萨宾娜进来了。安娜继续谈着罗西尼时，克劳迪走了过去。弗兰茨把注意力投向那两个女人的谈话。几句寒喧客套之后，克劳迪捻着萨宾娜脖子上的陶瓷垂饰大声说：“这是什么？多丑啊！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Those words made a deep impression on Franz. They were not meant to be combative; the raucous laughter immediately following them made it clear that by rejecting the pendant Marie-Claude did not wish to jeopardize her friendship with Sabina. But it was not the kind of thing she usually said.</p><p>弗兰茨深深一惊。妻子的话不意味着挑斗，接下去的沙哑的大笑立刻表明，克劳迪否定这垂饰但并不希望危害她与萨宾娜的友谊。但她通常不会这么说的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I made it myself," said Sabina.</p><p>“我自己做的。”萨宾娜说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That pendant is ugly, really!" Marie-Claude repeated very loudly. "You shouldn't wear it." </p><p>“这垂饰真丑，真的！”克劳迪高声地重复，“你不该戴它。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Franz knew his wife didn't care whether the pendant was ugly or not. An object was ugly if she willed it ugly, beautiful if she willed it beautiful. Pendants worn by her friends were a priori beautiful. And even if she did find them ugly, she would never say so, because flattery had long since become second nature to her.</p><p>弗兰茨知道妻子并不在意垂饰的丑与美，一件东西她愿意说丑就丑，愿意说美就美。她朋友戴的垂饰预定就是美的，即使她发现的确很丑，也不会说。长久以来，阿谀奉承已成为她的第二天性。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Why, then, did she decide that the pendant Sabina had made herself was ugly?</p><p>那么为什么她决定说萨宾娜自己做的垂饰丑呢？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Franz suddenly saw the answer plainly: Marie-Claude proclaimed Sabina's pendant ugly because she could afford to do so.</p><p>弗兰茨突然明白无误地找到了答案：克劳迪声称萨宾娜的垂饰丑是因为她有本钱这么说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Or to be more precise: Marie-Claude proclaimed Sabina's pendant ugly to make it clear that she could afford to tell Sabina her pendant was ugly.</p><p>或者更准确些说：她这么说是要让人们明白，她有本钱说萨宾娜的垂饰丑。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sabina's exhibition the year before had not been particularly successful, so Marie-Claude did not set great store by Sabina's favor. Sabina, however, had every reason to set store by Marie-Claude's. Yet that was not at all evident from her behavior.</p><p>萨宾娜去年的画展不怎么成功，所以克劳迪并不特别重视萨宾娜的光顾。然而，萨宾娜却有种种理由重视克劳迪的画廊，只是她的行为尚未证实这一点。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Yes, Franz saw it plainly: Marie-Claude had taken advantage of the occasion to make clear to Sabina (and others) what the real balance of power was between the two of them.</p><p>是的，弗兰茨看清了：克劳迪抓住有利场合向萨宾娜（以及其他人）表明，她们两人之间的真正力量均势到底如何。</p></div>

<div class='layout'><p>A Short Dictionary of Misunderstood Words (concluded)</p><p>误解小词典（续完）</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>THE OLD CHURCH IN AMSTERDAM</p><p>阿姆斯特丹的古老教堂</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>There are houses running along one side of the street, and behind the large ground-floor shop-front windows all the whores have little rooms and plushly pillowed armchairs in which they sit up close to the glass wearing bras and panties. They look like big bored cats.</p><p>街道的这一边是鳞次相比的房屋，第一楼的橱窗后面，所有的妓女都有一间小屋与舒适豪华的夹垫大椅，她们只穿了乳罩和短裤衩，挨近玻璃窗坐着，看上去象讨厌的猫。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>On the other side of the street is a gigantic Gothic cathedral dating from the fourteenth century.</p><p>街道的另一边是建于十四世纪的巨大哥特式大教堂。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Between the whores' world and God's world, like a river dividing two empires, stretches an intense smell of urine.</p><p>妓女的世界与上帝的世界之间，街道散发出尿的臭气，象一条河划分着两个王国。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Inside the Old Church, all that is left of the Gothic style is the high, bare, white walls, the columns, the vaulting, and the windows. There is not a single image on the walls, not a single piece of statuary anywhere. The church is as empty as a gymnasium, except in the very center, where several rows of chairs have been arranged in a large square around a miniature podium for the minister. Behind the chairs are wooden booths, stalls for wealthy burghers. The chairs and stalls seem to have been placed there without the slightest concern for the shape of the walls or position of the columns, as if wishing to express their indifference to or disdain for Gothic architecture. </p><p>老教堂里面，所有残留的哥特式风格只有又高又光的白墙，还有柱子、拱顶和窗户。墙上没有一幅图画，其它地方也没见雕塑。教堂象体育馆一样空旷，只有正中心的地方，疏疏地放置了几排给牧师们坐的椅子，围着一堵可供教长站立的小墩墙。椅子后面是为那些有钱的自由民而设置的木头小厢房以及栅栏。看来，椅子和厢房一直就设置在那里，人们从未考虑到墙的形状和柱子的位置，似乎是希望表明对哥特式建筑的轻视与无所谓。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Centuries ago Calvinist faith turned the cathedral into a hangar, its only function being to keep the prayers of the faithful safe from rain and snow.</p><p>几个世纪前，加尔文教派的信仰把这座大教堂变成了一个大顶棚，唯一的作用是让那些忠实的信徒避避风雪。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Franz was fascinated by it: the Grand March of History had passed through this gigantic hall!</p><p>弗兰茨被它迷住了：历史的伟大进军曾经怎样穿过这巨大的殿堂！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sabina recalled how after the Communist coup all the castles in Bohemia were nationalized and turned into manual training centers, retirement homes, and also cow sheds. She had visited one of the cow sheds: hooks for iron rings had been hammered into the stucco walls, and cows tied to the rings gazed dreamily out of the windows at the castle grounds, now overrun with chickens.</p><p>萨宾娜想起波希米亚所有城堡是怎样收归国有，变成了劳工训练地、养老院，甚至牛棚。她参观过一个牛棚：接铁链的钩子钉入夜粉墙上，系在铣丝上的牛焦渴地瞪着窗外城堡的土地，那儿喂了鸡。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It's the emptiness of it that fascinates me," said Franz. "People collect altars, statues, paintings, chairs, carpets, and books, and then comes a time of joyful relief and they throw it all out like so much refuse from yesterday's dinner table. Can't you just picture Hercules' broom sweeping out this cathedral? "</p><p>“正是它的空旷使我神往，”弗兰茨说，“人们收起了祭坛、塑像、图画、椅子、地毯和圣经，在那一刻得到了欢乐和安慰。他们把一切统统丢掉，就象扔掉桌上的剩物。你不能想象海格立斯的扫帚怎样清扫这大教堂吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The poor had to stand, while the rich had stalls, said Sabina, pointing to them. But there was something that bound the bankers to beggars: a hatred of beauty."</p><p>“穷人不得不站着，而富人占有包厢，”萨宾娜指着那些包厢说，“但是有一种东西把银行家和乞丐联系在一起：对美的仇视。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What is beauty?" said Franz, and he saw himself attending a recent gallery preview at his wife's side, and at her insistence. </p><p>“什么是美呢？”弗兰茨发现自己正站在最近一次画廊预展时的妻子一边，正在认同她的坚持己见。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The endless vanity of speeches and words, the vanity of culture, the vanity of art.</p><p>那就是文词和言论的无穷虚幻，还有文化的虚幻，艺术的虚幻。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When Sabina was working in the student brigade, her soul poisoned by the cheerful marches issuing incessantly from the loudspeakers, she borrowed a motorcycle one Sunday and headed for the hills. She stopped at a tiny remote village she had never seen before, leaned the motorcycle against the church, and went in. A mass happened to be in progress. Religion was persecuted by the regime, and most people gave the church a wide berth. The only people in the pews were old men and old women, because they did not fear the regime. They feared only death.</p><p>萨宾娜在学生队里劳动时，灵魂被高音喇叭里欢乐的进行曲不断毒害。一个星期天，她借来一部摩托，朝山上开去，在一个从未到过的边远村庄里停下来。她把摩托靠教堂放好，往教堂里面走去。一群人恰好在做礼拜。当时宗教受到当局的压制，大多数人对教堂都避之不及。留在教堂长凳子上的只有些老爷子和老妇人，他们不害怕当局，只害怕死亡。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The priest intoned words in a singsong voice, and the people repeated them after him in unison. It was a litany. The same words kept coming back, like a wanderer who cannot tear his eyes away from the countryside or like a man who cannot take leave of life. </p><p>神父歌咏般地吟诵祷文，人们跟着他齐声重复。这称为连祷。同一句话反复重现，象一位流浪汉忍不住连连回望家乡，象一个人不忍离世。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She sat in one of the last pews, closing her eyes to hear the music of the words, opening them to stare up at the blue vault dotted with large gold stars. </p><p>她在最后一排凳子上坐下，合上双眼聆听祷词的曲调，又睁开眼，打量上方那蓝色拱顶上嵌着的金色大星星。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She was entranced.</p><p>她惊喜入迷了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>What she had unexpectedly met there in the village church was not God; it was beauty. </p><p>她在这个乡村教堂无意遇到的东西不是上帝，而是美。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She knew perfectly well that neither the church nor the litany was beautiful in and of itself, but they were beautiful compared to the construction site, where she spent her days amid the racket of the songs. The mass was beautiful because it appeared to her in a sudden, mysterious revelation as a world betrayed.</p><p>她太明白不过了，教堂与连祷本身里里外外都未见得美，它们的美存在于与建筑工地上天天歌声喧躁的比较之中。她突然觉得这些人是美的，他们如同一个叛逆的世界，是一种神秘的新发现。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>From that time on she had known that beauty is a world betrayed. The only way we can encounter it is if its persecutors have overlooked it somewhere. Beauty hides behind the scenes of the May Day parade. If we want to find it, we must demolish the scenery.</p><p>从那时起，她就认为美是一个叛逆的世界。我们碰到它，只能在迫害者俯瞰着它的什么地方。美就藏在当局制造的游行场景之后，我们要找它，就必须毁掉这一景观。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"This is the first time I've ever been fascinated by a church," said Franz.</p><p>“这是我第一次被教堂迷住。”弗兰茨说。无论新教还是禁欲主义都未曾使他如此热情。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was neither Protestantism nor asceticism that made him so enthusiastic; it was something else, something highly personal, something he did not dare discuss with Sabina. He thought he heard a voice telling him to seize Hercules' broom and sweep all of Marie-Claude's previews, all of Marie-Anne's singers, all lectures and symposia, all useless speeches and vain words—sweep them out of his life. The great empty space of Amsterdam's Old Church had appeared to him in a sudden and mysterious revelation as the image of his own liberation.</p><p>这是另外一种东西，高度私有性的东西，是他不敢与萨宾娜讨论的东西。他想，他听到了一种声音，要他抓住海格立斯的扫把，扫掉克劳迪所有的预展，安娜所有的歌唱家，还有所有的演讲、专题辩论会，所有无用的言语和无聊的文词，把它们统统从自己的生活中扫出去。阿姆斯特丹大教堂宏伟巨大的空阔突然出现在他面前，这神奇的新发现象征着他自身的解放。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>STRENGTH</p><p>力量</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Stroking Franz's arms in bed in one of the many hotels where they made love, Sabina said:"The muscles you have! They're unbelievable!" </p><p>一次，他们在某家旅馆里做爱，萨宾娜抚着弗兰茨的手臂说：“看你有多好的肌肉！真不能使人相信！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Franz took pleasure in her praise. He climbed out of bed, got down on his haunches, grabbed a heavy oak chair by one leg, and lifted it slowly into the air. "You never have to be afraid, he said. I can protect you no matter what. I used to be a judo champion." </p><p>弗兰茨对她的赞美很高兴，从床上爬出来，臀部顶地，用一条腿钩佐一张很重的橡木椅子，轻轻地把它挑到空中：“你永远也不必害怕，不论什么情况我都能保护你，我以前还是个拳击冠军呢！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When he raised the hand with the heavy chair above his head, Sabina said:"It's good to know you're so strong." </p><p>他用手把椅子举过头，萨宾娜说：“知道你这么强壮，真好。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But deep down she said to herself, Franz may be strong, but his strength is directed outward; when it comes to the people he lives with, the people he loves, he's weak. Franz's weakness is called goodness. Franz would never give Sabina orders. He would never command her, as Tomas had, to lay the mirror on the floor and walk back and forth on it naked. </p><p>但她内心中自语，弗兰茨也许强壮，但他的力量是向外的，在他生活与共的人面前，在他爱的人面前，他显得软弱无力。弗兰茨的软弱也可以称为美德。他从不向萨宾娜下指示，从不象托马斯那样命令她，要她躺在镜子旁边的地上以及光着身子走来走去。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Not that he lacks sensuality; he simply lacks the strength to give orders. There are things that can be accomplished only by violence. </p><p>他并非不好色，只是缺乏下达命令的力量。有些事情是只能靠暴力来完成的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Physical love is unthinkable without violence.</p><p>生理上的爱没有暴力是难以想象的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sabina watched Franz walk across the room with the chair above his head; the scene struck her as grotesque and filled her with an odd sadness.</p><p>萨宾娜看着弗兰茨举着椅子在屋子里走过，象看到一个使她震惊的怪物，心里充满了奇怪的悲伤。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Franz set the chair down on the floor opposite Sabina and sat in it. "I enjoy being strong, of course, he said, but what good do these muscles do me in Geneva? They're like an ornament, a peacock feather. I've never fought anyone in my life." </p><p>弗兰茨把椅子放到萨宾娜的对面，坐下来说：“我当然喜欢强壮，但在日内瓦，这些肌肉对我有什么好处？它们象装饰品，一根孔雀的羽毛。我一生还没有同人打过架哩。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sabina proceeded with her melancholy musings: What if she had a man who ordered her about? </p><p>萨宾娜又开始了孤独的沉思：如果她有一个指挥她的男人又怎么样呢？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>A man who wanted to master her? How long would she put up with him? Not five minutes! From which it follows that no man was right for her. Strong or weak.</p><p>一个要控制她的人吗？她能容忍他多久？不到五分钟！从这儿得出结论，无论强者还是弱者，没有人适合她。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why don't you ever use your strength on me?" she said.</p><p>“为什么不用你的力量来对付我？”她问。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Because love means renouncing strength," said Franz softly.</p><p>“爱就意昧着解除强力。”弗兰茨温柔地说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sabina realized two things: first, that Franz's words were noble and just; second, that they disqualified him from her love life.</p><p>萨宾娜明白了两点：第一，弗兰茨的话是高尚而正义的，第二，他的话说明他没有资格爱她。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>LIVING IN TRUTH</p><p>生活在真实中</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Such is the formula set forth by Kafka somewhere in the diaries or letters. </p><p>卡夫卡曾在日记或是信件中提到这样一句，生活在真实中。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Franz couldn't quite remember where. But it captivated him. What does it mean to live in truth? </p><p>弗兰茨记不清这话的出处，但这句话强烈地感染了他。生活在真实中意味着什么？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Putting it negatively is easy enough: it means not lying, not hiding, and not dissimulating. From the time he met Sabina, however, Franz had been living in lies. </p><p>从反面来讲太容易了，意思是不撤谎，不隐瞒，而且不伪饰。然而从遇见萨宾娜起，他就一直生活在谎言中。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He told his wife about nonexistent congresses in Amsterdam and lectures in Madrid; he was afraid to walk with Sabina through the streets of Geneva. And he enjoyed the lying and hiding: it was all so new to him. He was as excited as a teacher's pet who has plucked up the courage to play truant.</p><p>他跟妻子说那些根本不存在的阿姆斯特丹会议，马德里讲学；他不敢与萨宾娜并肩步行于日内瓦的大街。他还欣赏谎言与躲藏：这些对他来说是如此新异，他象一个老师的爱学生鼓起勇气逃学，感到十分兴奋。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>For Sabina, living in truth, lying neither to ourselves nor to others, was possible only away from the public: the moment someone keeps an eye on what we do, allowances for that eye, and nothing we do is truthful. Having a public, keeping a public in mind, means living in lies. Sabina despised literature in which people give away all kinds of intimate secrets about themselves and their friends. </p><p>萨宾娜认为，生活在真实之中，既不对我们自己也不对别人撤谎，只有远离人群才有可能。在有人睁眼盯住我们做什么的时候，在我们迫不得已只能让那只眼睛盯的时候，我们不可能有真实的举动。有一个公众脑子里留有一个公众，就意昧着生活在谎言之中。萨宾娜看不起文学，文学作者老是泄漏他们自己或他们朋友的种种内心隐秘。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>A man who loses his privacy loses everything, Sabina thought. And a man who gives it up of his own free will is a monster. </p><p>萨宾娜以为，一个放弃了自己私和隐秘的人就等于丧失了一切，而一个自由而且自愿放弃它的人必是一个魔鬼。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>That was why Sabina did not suffer in the least from having to keep her love secret. On the contrary, only by doing so could she live in truth.</p><p>这就是萨宾娜保守着那么多恋爱秘密但一点儿也不感到难受的原因。相反，这样做才使她得以生活在真实之中。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Franz, on the other hand, was certain that the division of life into private and public spheres is the source of all lies: a person is one thing in private and something quite different in public. </p><p>在弗兰茨这一方面，他确认把私生活与公开生活分成两个领域是一切谎言之源：一个人在私生活与在公开生活中是完全不同的两个人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>For Franz, living in truth meant breaking down the barriers between the private and the public. </p><p>对弗兰茨来说，生活在真实之中就意昧着推翻私生活与公开生活之间的障碍。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He was fond of quoting Andre Breton on the desirability of living "in a glass house" into which everyone can look and there are no secrets.</p><p>他喜欢引用安德鲁.勃勒东的活，满意的生活就是“在一间玻璃房子”里，人人都能看见你，没有任何秘密。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When he heard his wife telling Sabina:"That pendant is ugly!" he knew he could no longer live in lies and had to stand up for Sabina. </p><p>当他听到妻子对萨宾娜说：“那垂饰真丑”，他知道自己再也无法活在谎言中了，他非得站起来维护萨宾娜不可。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He had not done so only because he was afraid of betraying their secret love.</p><p>他终于没有那样做，仅仅是害怕暴露了他们的爱情秘密。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The day after the cocktail party, he was supposed to go to Rome with Sabina for the weekend. </p><p>鸡尾酒宴的第二天，他计划与萨宾娜一起去罗马度周末。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He could not get "That pendant is ugly!" out of his mind, and it made him see Marie-Claude in a completely new light. Her aggressiveness—invulnerable, noisy, and full of vitality—relieved him of the burden of goodness he had patiently borne all twenty-three years of their marriage. </p><p>“那垂饰真丑”的话耿耿于怀，使他用一种全新的眼光来看克劳迪。她的侵犯——无懈可击，喳喳呼呼，劲头十足——把二十三年婚姻生活中他耐心承受的美德重负给卸了下来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He recalled the enormous inner space of the Old Church in Amsterdam and felt the strange incomprehensible ecstasy that void had evoked in him.</p><p>他回想起阿姆斯特丹古老教堂那巨大的内部空间，感到那空白唤起了他奇特的、不可理喻的狂害。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He was packing his overnight bag when Marie-Claude came into the room, chatting about the guests at the party, energetically endorsing the views of some and laughing off the views of others.</p><p>他捡拾自己的陋袋。克劳迪进来了，谈论着晚会上的客人，精力充沛地对某些观点大表赞同，对另一些观点则撇嘴一笑。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Franz looked at her for a long time and said:"There isn't any conference in Rome." </p><p>弗兰茨看了她很久，说：“罗马没有什么会议。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She did not see the point. "Then why are you going?" </p><p>她还没有看出问题：“那你干嘛要去？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I've had a mistress for nine months," he said. "I don't want to meet her in Geneva. That's why I've been traveling so much. I thought it was time you knew about it." </p><p>“我有一个情人，已经九个月了，”他说，“我不想在日内瓦同她聚会，所以有这么多旅行。我想，现在是你该知道的时候了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>After the first few words he lost his nerve. He turned away so as not to see the despair on Marie-Claude's face, the despair he expected his words to produce.</p><p>他一开口便不觉得紧张了，转过身去以免看见克劳迪脸上的绝望。他估计自己的话会使她绝望的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>After a short pause he heard her say:"Yes, I think it's time I knew about it." </p><p>停了一会儿，他听见她说：“是嘛，我想我是该知道啦。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Her voice was so firm that Franz turned in her direction. She did not look at all disturbed; in fact, she looked like the very same woman who had said the day before in a raucous voice:"That pendant is ugly!" </p><p>她的语气如此坚定，弗兰茨掉转头来。她看起来一点也不震惊，事实上倒很象一天前沙哑着嗓音的那同一位妇人：“那垂饰真丑！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She continued: "Now that you've plucked up the courage to tell me you've been deceiving me for nine months, do you think you can tell me who she is?"</p><p>她继续说：“你既然有胆告诉我，你骗我九个月了，你认为能告诉我她是谁吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He had always told himself he had no right to hurt Marie-Claude and should respect the woman in her. </p><p>他过去总告诫自己，没有权利伤害克劳迪，应该尊敬她身内的女人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But where had the woman in her gone? In other words, what had happened to the mother image he mentally linked with his wife? His mother, sad and wounded, his mother, wearing unmatched shoes, had departed from Marie-Claude—or perhaps not, perhaps she had never been inside Marie-Claude at all. The whole thing came to him in a flash of hatred.</p><p>可那女人到哪里去了呢？换一句话来说，他脑子里妻子与母亲形象的联系现在怎么啦？他的母亲，悲怆而受伤的母亲，他的母亲，穿着不相称的鞍，已经离克劳迪而去——她也许没有，也许从来就不曾隐含在克劳迪的身体之内。这一切化作一腔愤怒向他袭来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I have no reason to hide it from you," he said. </p><p>“我没有理由瞒你。”他说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>If he had not succeeded in wounding her with his infidelity, he was certain the revelation of her rival would do the trick. Looking her straight in the eye, he told her about Sabina.</p><p>如果说他的不忠尚不足以伤害她的话，他断定挑明她的对手会使她不舒服的。他直视着她，告诉她是萨宾娜。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>A while later he met Sabina at the airport. As the plane gained altitude, he felt lighter and lighter. At last, he said to himself, after nine months he was living in truth.</p><p>一会儿后，他与萨宾娜在机场见面。随着飞机向高空升去，他感到自己越来越轻。他终于对自己说，九个月之后他生活在真实之中了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>8</p><p>8</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sabina felt as though Franz had pried open the door of their privacy. As though she were peering into the heads of Marie-Claude, of Marie-Anne, of Alain the painter, of the sculptor who held on to his finger—of all the people she knew in Geneva. Now she would willy-nilly become the rival of a woman who did not interest her in the least. Franz would ask for a divorce, and she would take Marie-Claude's place in his large conjugal bed. Everyone would follow the process from a greater or lesser distance, and she would be forced to playact before them all; instead of being Sabina, she would have to act the role of Sabina, decide how best to act the role. Once her love had been publicized, it would gain weight, become a burden. Sabina cringed at the very thought of it.</p><p>萨宾娜似乎感到弗兰茨撬开了他们隐私的大门，似乎瞥见了在日内瓦认识的一颖颖脑袋：克劳迪，安娜，画家阿伦，握着手指头的雕刻家。现在，不管她愿意与否，她成了她毫无兴趣的一位妇人的对头。弗兰茨会提出离婚，而她务必在他那张大大的结婚床上取代克劳迪的位置。人家在表演的时候还与观众保持着或长或短的距离，而她却要在这所有的人面前演戏，不是萨宾娜，是不得不演萨宾娜的角色，并决定怎样演这个角色更好。一旦她的爱被公开，爱便沉重起来，成为了一个包袱。萨宾娜一想到这点就畏缩不前。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They had supper at a restaurant in Rome. She drank her wine in silence.</p><p>他们在罗马一家餐馆吃晚饭，她默默地喝着酒。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You're not angry, are you?" Franz asked.</p><p>“你没有生气吧？”弗兰茨问。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She assured him she was not. She was still confused and unsure whether to be happy or not. She recalled the time they met in the sleeping compartment of the Amsterdam express, the time she had wanted to go down on her knees before him and beg him to hold her, squeeze her, never let her go. She had longed to come to the end of the dangerous road of betrayals. She had longed to call a halt to it all.</p><p>她使对方确信她没有。她仍然处于混乱之中，不能确信什么才是幸福。她回想起他们在开往阿姆斯特丹的快车厢里相遇的情景，那时她真想跪在他面前，求他抓住她，紧紧拥抱她，永远不要松开。她期望结束那危险的背叛之途，期望终止这一切。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Try as she might to intensify that longing, summon it to her aid, lean on it, the feeling of distaste only grew stronger.</p><p>她可以强化那种欲念，试图把它看作自己的救助，自己的依托，可这只能使乏味之感更趋强烈。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They walked back to the hotel through the streets of Rome. Because the Italians around them were making a racket, shouting and gesticulating, they could walk along in silence without hearing their silence.</p><p>他们在罗马街上走回旅馆。周围的意大利人又闹又叫又手舞足蹈，他们默默走着，却听不到自己的沉默。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sabina spent a long time washing in the bathroom; Franz waited for her under the blanket. As always, the small lamp was lit.</p><p>萨宾娜在浴室里洗了很长时间；弗兰茨盖着毯子在等她，象通常那样，亮着一盏小灯。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When she came out, she turned it off. It was the first time she had done so. Franz should have paid better attention. He did not notice it, because light did not mean anything to him. As we know, he made love with his eyes shut.</p><p>她回来时，把灯关了。这是第一次她这么做。弗兰茨应该注意到这一点的，他没有。灯对他来说没有什么意义，如我们所知，他总是闭着眼睛做爱的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In fact, it was his closed eyes that made Sabina turn out the light. She could not stand those lowered eyelids a moment longer. The eyes, as the saying goes, are windows to the soul. Franz's body, which thrashed about on top of hers with closed eyes, was therefore a body without a soul. It was like a newborn animal, still blind and whimpering for the dug. Muscular Franz in coitus was like a gigantic puppy suckling at her breasts. He actually had her nipple in his mouth as if he were sucking milk! The idea that he was a mature man below and a suckling infant above, that she was therefore having intercourse with a baby, bordered on the disgusting. No, she would never again see his body moving desperately over hers, would never again offer him her breast, bitch to whelp, today was the last time, irrevocably the last time!</p><p>事实上，正是他那双闭着的眼睛使萨宾娜关掉了灯。她一刻也受不了那双低垂的眼瞳。常言说，眼睛是心灵之窗。因此弗兰茨闭着眼睛在她身上扭动着的身体，只是一个没有灵魂的躯壳而已。象一只刚刚出生的幼畜，闭着眼微喊地寻找奶头。强壮有力的弗兰茨在交合的时候，象一头巨大的幼狗在吮吸她的奶汁，他也真的含着她的奶头如同在吮吸！一想到他的下身是个成熟的男人而上身却是个吮奶的婴孩，她便觉得自已是在与一个婴孩交合，实在近乎厌恶。不！她不再愿意看见这个在她身上疯狂扭动的身躯，不再愿意把自己的乳头交给他。一条母狗和一只小狗，今天只是最后一次，不可更改的最后一次！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She knew, of course, that she was being supremely unfair, that Franz was the best man she had ever had—he was intelligent, he understood her paintings, he was handsome and good—but the more she thought about it, the more she longed to ravish his intelligence, defile his kindheartedness, and violate his powerless strength.</p><p>她当然知道，她是极为不公平的。弗兰茨是她所见男人中最好的一个——聪明，能理解她的画，英武而且善良——但她越这么想，就越想强夺他的智慧，污损他的好心，摧毁他无能的体力。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>That night, she made love to him with greater frenzy than ever before, aroused by the realization that this was the last time. Making love, she was far, far away. Once more she heard the golden horn of betrayal beckoning her in the distance, and she knew she would not hold out. She sensed an expanse of freedom before her, and the boundlessness of it excited her. She made mad, unrestrained love to Franz as she never had before.</p><p>那天晚上，她同他做爱比以往都狂热得多，她意识到这是最后一次。她干得恍恍惚惚神游万里。她再次听到背叛的金色号角在远远地召唤她，她知道自己无法坚持下去，她感触到前面那自由的太空，那使她激动的无拘无束无遮无拦。她给了弗兰茨从未有过的疯狂而放纵的爱。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Franz sobbed as he lay on top of her; he was certain he understood: Sabina had been quiet all through dinner and said not a word about his decision, but this was her answer. She had made a clear show of her joy, her passion, her consent, her desire to live with him forever.</p><p>弗兰茨躺在她身上流下了热泪。他以为他是理解了：萨宾娜整个吃饭的时候都安静沉默，对他的决定没吭一声，现在才是她的回答。她已清楚表明将永远与他生活在一起的欢欣，还有她的激情，她的赞同，她的欲望。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He felt like a rider galloping off into a magnificent void, a void of no wife, no daughter, no household, the magnificent void swept clean by Hercules' broom, a magnificent void he would fill with his love.</p><p>他感到自己犹如一位驰入辉煌太空的骑士，那里没有他的妻子、女儿、家事，那些已被海格立斯的扫帚扫得一于二净，那辉煌真空里将填入他的爱。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Each was riding the other like a horse, and both were galloping off into the distance of their desires, drunk on the betrayals that freed them. Franz was riding Sabina and had betrayed his wife; Sabina was riding Franz and had betrayed Franz.</p><p>他们各自都把对方视为坐骑，驰入他们期望的远方。他们都沉醉于将解脱他们的背叛之中。弗兰茨骑着萨宾娜背叛了他的妻子，而萨宾娜骑着弗兰茨背叛了弗兰茨本人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>9</p><p>9</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>For twenty years he had seen his mother—a poor, weak creature who needed his protection—in his wife. This image was deeply rooted in him, and he could not rid himself of it in two dys. On the way home his conscience began to bother him: he was afraid that Marie-Claude had fallen apart after he left and that he would find her terribly sick at heart. Stealthily he unlocked the door and went into his room. He stood there for a moment and listened: Yes, she was at home. After a moment's hesitation he went into her room, ready to greet her as usual.</p><p>二十年了，他一直在妻子身上看见母亲——可怜，弱小，需要他的帮助。这种幻觉深深根植于他的心灵，使他两天来一直无法使自己摆脱这个念头。回家的路上，他的良心开始不安，担心他走后克劳迪会完全垮下来，说不定会闹出严重的心脏病。他偷偷打开门走进自己的房间，站在那儿听了一阵：是的，她在家。犹豫了一下，他走进她的屋子，打算象平常那样打打招呼。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What?" she exclaimed, raising her eyebrows in mock surprise. "You? Here?" </p><p>“是吗？”她讥讽地眼皮向上一翻，惊叫道，“你？到这儿来啦？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Where else can I go?" he wanted to say (genuinely surprised), but said nothing.</p><p>他想说（他倒是真正惊住了），“我还能到哪里去呢”，但他没有说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Let's set the record straight, shall we? I have nothing against your moving in with her at once."</p><p>“我们直说好了，怎么样？你立刻搬到她那里去，我毫不反对。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When he made his confession on the day he left for Rome, he had no precise plan of action. He expected to come home and talk it all out in a friendly atmosphere so as not to harm Marie-Claude any more than necessary. It never occurred to him that she would calmly and coolly urge him to leave.</p><p>他去罗马那天承认自己与萨宾娜的事，当时尚无明确的行动计划。他指望回家后友好地跟克劳迪彻底谈一次，尽可能不伤害她。他不曾想到她会平静而冷冰冰地催他走。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Even though it facilitated things, he could not help feeling disappointed. He had been afraid of wounding her all his life and voluntarily stuck to a stultifying discipline of monogamy, and now, after twenty years, he suddenly learned that it had all been superfluous and he had given up scores of women because of a misunderstanding!</p><p>这样不费什么事，但他禁不住感到沮丧。他一辈子都怕伤害她，自觉遵守着一夫一妻制的无效纪律，而现在，二十年后的今天，他突然得知这一切纯属多余。由于一种误解，他拒绝了多少女人！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>That afternoon, he gave his lecture, then went straight to Sabina's from the university. He had decided to ask her whether he could spend the night. He rang the doorbell, but no one answered. He went and sat at the cafe across the street and stared long and hard at the entrance to her building.</p><p>下午上完课，他直接由大学去萨宾娜那儿，决定问她可否去她那里过夜。一按门铃才知没人。他坐在街对面的酒吧里眼巴巴地张望了许久，又在她的住宅大门前尴尬徘徊。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Evening came, and he did not know where to turn. All his life he had shared his bed with Marie-Claude. If he went home to Marie-Claude, where should he sleep? He could, of course, make up a bed on the sofa in the next room. But wouldn't that be merely an eccentric gesture? Wouldn't it look like a sign of ill will? He wanted to remain friends with her, after all! Yet getting into bed with her was out of the question. He could just hear her asking him ironically why he didn't prefer Sabina's bed. He took a room in a hotel.</p><p>夜晚来临了，他不知道该去哪里。他这一辈子都是与克劳迪共用一张床。如果回克劳迪那里去，他该睡什么地方？当然，可以睡在隔壁房里的沙发上，但那不形如疯人怪汉吗？不显得有点神志错乱吗？他毕竟希望与她保持友谊啊！与她睡在一起是不可能的，他甚至能听到她嘲弄地问他干嘛不去找萨宾娜的床铺。他在一家旅馆租了一间房子。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The next day, he rang Sabina's doorbell morning, noon, and night.</p><p>第二天，他早晨、中午、晚上都去按过萨宾娜家的门铃。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The day after, he paid a visit to the concierge, who had no information and referred him to the owner of the flat. He phoned her and found out that Sabina had given notice two days before.</p><p>又过了一天，他去问过萨宾娜的看门人，那人一无所知，提醒他去找房主。他给房主打了电话，得知萨宾娜两天前就告辞走了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>During the next few days, he returned at regular intervals, still hoping to find her in, but one day he found the door open and three men in overalls loading the furniture and paintings into a van parked outside.</p><p>以后的几天，他照常去那儿，希望能在那里找到她。这一天他发现门开了，三个穿工作服的人把家具与画装进一部停在外面的汽车里。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He asked them where they were taking the furniture.</p><p>他问他们打算把家具搬到哪里去。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They replied that they were under strict instructions not to reveal the address.</p><p>他们回答，他们曾受严格嘱托不得泄漏去向。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He was about to offer them a few francs for the secret address when suddenly he felt he lacked the strength to do it. His grief had broken him utterly. He understood nothing, had no idea what had happened; all he knew was that he had been waiting for it to happen ever since he met Sabina. What must be must be. Franz did not oppose it.</p><p>他差不多要收买他们以求获得秘密地址，但突然感到无力这么做。悲伤使他完全崩溃。他不理解这是为什么也不知道发生了什么。只知道从碰到萨宾娜起他就一直等候着这一切的发生。必然如此的必然，他弗兰茨无力阻挡。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He found a small flat for himself in the old part of town. When he knew his wife and daughter were away, he went back to his former home to fetch his clothes and most essential books. He was careful to remove nothing that Marie-Claude might miss.</p><p>他在老街上找了一套小房子，乘妻子和女儿不在时回家去取了衣物和大多数必备的书籍，他小心翼翼不去碰克劳迪喜欢的东西。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>One day, he saw her through the window of a cafe. She was sitting with two women, and her face, long riddled with wrinkles from her unbridled gift for grimaces, was in a state of animation. The women were listening closely and laughing continually. Franz could not get over the feeling that she was telling them about him. Surely she knew that Sabina had disappeared from Geneva at the very time Franz decided to live with her. What a funny story it would make! He was not the least bit surprised at becoming a butt to his wife's friends.</p><p>一天，他从酒吧的窗子里看到了她。妻子和两个女人坐在一起，脸上眉飞色舞，擅长做鬼脸的天赋使她脸上留下许多长长的皱折。那些女人仔细听着，连声哈哈大笑。弗兰茨老觉得她是在谈论他；她肯定知道了，弗兰茨决定与萨宾娜一道生活的时候，萨宾娜却在日内瓦消失。这该是个多么滑稽的故事啊！他毫不奇怪他正在成为妻子朋友们的笑柄。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When he got home to his new flat, where every hour he could hear the bells of Saint-Pierre, he found that the department store had delivered his new desk. He promptly forgot about Marie-Claude and her friends. He even forgot about Sabina for the time being. He sat down at the desk. He was glad to have picked it out himself. For twenty years he had lived among furniture not of his own choosing. Marie-Claude had taken care of everything. At last he had ceased to be a little boy; for the first time in his life he was on his own. The next day he hired a carpenter to make a bookcase for him. He spent several days designing it and deciding where it should stand.</p><p>他回到自己新的公寓，这儿每个钟头都能听到圣皮尔的钟声。他发现百货公司已把他买的新书桌送来了，立刻忘记了克劳迪及其朋友们，甚至一时忘了萨宾娜。他在书桌前坐下来，很高兴这张桌子是自己亲自挑的。二十年来他身旁的家具都不是他挑选的，一切都被克劳迪管着。终于，他不是一个小孩子了，有生以来第一次自立了。第二天他又请来一个木匠做书柜，花了几天时间设计式样，选定摆书超的地方。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And at some point, he realized to his great surprise that he was not particularly unhappy. Sabina's physical presence was much less important than he had suspected. What was important was the golden footprint, the magic footprint she had left on his life and no one could ever remove. Just before disappearing from his horizon, she had slipped him Hercules' broom, and he had used it to sweep everything he despised out of his life. A sudden happiness, a feeling of bliss, the joy that came of freedom and a new life—these were the gifts she had left him.</p><p>就某一点来说，他惊讶地意识到自己并不特别难过，萨宾娜的物化存在并没有他猜想的那么重要，重要的是她在他一生中留下了灿烂的足迹，神奇的足迹，任何人也无法抹去。她从他的视界里消失之前，塞给了他那把海格立斯的扫帚。他用它把自己藐视的一切都从生活中扫去了。一种突然的庆幸，一阵狂乱的欣喜，还有自由和新生带来的欢乐，都是她留下的馈赠。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Actually, he had always preferred the unreal to the real. Just as he felt better at demonstrations (which, as I have pointed out, are all playacting and dreams) than in a lecture hall full of students, so he was happier with Sabina the invisible goddess than the Sabina who had accompanied him throughout the world and whose love he constantly feared losing. By giving him the unexpected freedom of a man living on his own, she provided him with a halo of seductiveness. He became very attractive to women, and one of his students fell in love with him.</p><p>事实上，他总是喜欢非现实胜于现实，如同他感到去参加游行示威比给满堂学生上课更好（我已经指出，前者不过是表演与梦想）。看不见的女神萨宾娜，比陪他周游世界和他总怕失去的萨宾娜更能使他幸福。她给了他万万想不到的男子汉自立的自由，这种自由成为了他诱人的光环。他在女人心目中变得更有吸引力，甚至他的一个学生也爱上了他。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And so within an amazingly short period the backdrop of his life had changed completely. Until recently he had lived in a large upper-middle-class flat with a servant, a daughter, and a wife; now he lived in a tiny flat in the old part of town, where almost every night he was joined by his young student-mistress. He did not need to squire her through the world from hotel to hotel; he could make love to her in his own flat, in his own bed, with his own books and ashtray on the bedside table!</p><p>于是，在一段短得惊人的时间内，他的生活背景完全给变更了。不久前他还与佣人、女儿、妻子住在宽敞的中上阶层富宅里，现在却住在老区的一所小房子里。几乎每个晚上，那位年轻的学生兼情人都来陪他。他用不着殷勤侍候她游历世界，从一个旅馆到一个旅馆，他能在自己的住宅、自己的床上与她做爱！旁边桌上放着他自己的书和自己的烟灰缸！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She was a modest girl and not particularly pretty, but she admired Franz in the way Franz had only recently admired Sabina. </p><p>她是个朴素的孩子，并不特别漂亮。但她用弗兰茨近来崇拜萨宾娜的方式来崇拜弗兰茨。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He did not find it unpleasant. And if he did perhaps feel that trading Sabina for a student with glasses was something for a comedown, his innate goodness saw to it that he cared for her and lavished on her the paternal love that had never had a true outlet before, given that Marie-Anne had always behaved less like his daughter than like a copy of Marie-Claude.</p><p>他不觉得有什么不快。他也许感到用萨宾娜换取了一个戴眼镜的学生有什么划不来，他天生的美德也务必使他去爱护她，把自己不曾真正倾泻过的父爱加倍地赐给她——与其说他有一个女儿安娜，倒不如说安娜更象克劳迪的复制品。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>One day, he paid a visit to his wife. He told her he would like to remarry.</p><p>一天，他去见妻子，告诉对方他想再结婚了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Marie-Claude shook her head.</p><p>克劳迪摇了摇头。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But a divorce won't make any difference to you! You won't lose a thing! I'll give you all the property!"</p><p>“离婚对你来说根本无所谓！你不会失去任何东西！财产我都给你！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I don't care about property," she said.</p><p>“我不在乎财产。”她说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Then what do you care about?"</p><p>“你在乎什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Love," she said with a smile.</p><p>“爱情。”她笑了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Love?" Franz asked in amazement.</p><p>“爱情？”弗兰茨惊讶地问。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Love is a battle," said Marie-Claude, still smiling. "And I plan to go on fighting. To the end."</p><p>“爱情是一场战斗，”克劳迪仍然笑着，“我打算继续打下去，直到胜利。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Love is a battle? said Franz. Well, I don't feel at all like fighting." And he left.</p><p>“爱情是战斗？好吧，我一点儿也不想打。”他说完就走了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>10</p><p>10</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>After four years in Geneva, Sabina settled in Paris, but she could not escape her melancholy. If someone had asked her what had come over her, she would have been hard pressed to find words for it.</p><p>结束了日内瓦的四年，萨宾娜定居巴黎，但未能逃脱忧郁。如果有谁问她感受了一些什么，她总是很难找到语言来回答。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When we want to give expression to a dramatic situation in our lives, we tend to use metaphors of heaviness. We say that something has become a great burden to us. We either bear the burden or fail and go down with it, we struggle with it, win or lose. And Sabina—what had come over her? Nothing. She had left a man because she felt like leaving him. Had he persecuted her? Had he tried to take revenge on her? No. Her drama was a drama not of heaviness but of lightness. What fell to her lot was not the burden but the unbearable lightness of being.</p><p>我们想表达我们生命中某种戏剧性情境时，曾借助于有关重的比喻。我们说，有些事成为了我们巨大的包袱。我们或是承受这个负担，或是被它压倒。我们的奋斗可能胜利也可能失败。那么萨宾娜呢？——她感受了一些什么？什么也没有。她离开了一个男人只是因为想要离开他。他迫害她啦？试图报复她吗？没有。她的人生之剧不是沉重的，而是轻盈的。大量降临于她的并非重负，而是生命中不可承受之轻。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Until that time, her betrayals had filled her with excitement and joy, because they opened up new paths to new adventures of betrayal. But what if the paths came to an end? One could betray one's parents, husband, country, love, but when parents husband, country, and love were gone—what was left to betray?</p><p>在此之前，她的背叛还充满着激情与欢乐，向她展开一条新的道路，通向种种背叛的风险。可倘若这条路定到了尽头又怎么样呢？一个人可以背叛父母、丈夫、国家以及爱情，但如果父母、丈夫、国家以及爱情都失去了——还有什么可以背叛呢？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sabina felt emptiness all around her. What if that emptiness was the goal of all her betrayals?</p><p>萨宾娜感到四周空空如也，这种虚空就是她一切背叛的目标吗？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Naturally she had not realized it until now. How could she have? The goals we pursue are always veiled. A girl who longs for marriage longs for something she knows nothing about. The boy who hankers after fame has no idea what fame is. The thing that gives our every move its meaning is always totally unknown to us. Sabina was unaware of the goal that lay behind her longing to betray. The unbearable lightness of being—was that the goal? Her departure from Geneva brought her considerably closer to it.</p><p>她自己以前当然意识不到这一点。她怎么可能呢？我们追寻的目标总是不为我们所知。一个姑娘渴望结婚渴望别的什么但对这一切毫无所知，一个小伙子追求名誉却不懂得名誉为何物。推动我们一切行动的东西却总是根本不让我们明了其意义何在。萨宾娜对于隐藏在自己背叛欲念后的目的无所察觉，这生命中不可承受的轻——不就是目的所在吗？她离开日内瓦，使她相当可观地接近了这个目的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Three years after moving to Paris, she received a letter from Prague. It was from Tomas's son. Somehow or other he had found out about her and got hold of her address, and now he was writing to her as his father's "closest friend". He informed her of the deaths of Tomas and Tereza. For the past few years they had been living in a village, where Tomas was employed as a driver at a collective farm. From time to time they would drive over to the next town and spend the night in a cheap hotel. The road there wound through some hills, and their pickup had crashed and hurtled down a steep incline. Their bodies had been crushed to a pulp. The police determined later that the brakes were in disastrous condition.</p><p>到巴黎三年后，她收到了一封布拉格的来信，是托马斯的儿子写的。他居然能打听到她，找到了她的地址，而且现在给他父亲“最亲密的朋友”写信。他告知了托马斯与特丽莎死的消息。前几年，他们一直住在一个村子里，托马斯当了集体农庄的司机。他们不时开车到邻镇去，在一家廉价小旅店过夜。那条路曲曲折折经过几座山，有一次他们在突然加速时撞坏了车，翻到陡峭的山坡下，身体摔成了肉酱。后来据警察说，汽车的刹车糟糕透顶。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She could not get over the news. The last link to her past had been broken.</p><p>她不能忘掉这消息，与她过去的最后一丝联系中断了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>According to her old habit, she decided to calm herself by taking a walk in a cemetery. The Montparnasse Cemetery was the closest. It was all tiny houses, miniature chapels over each grave. Sabina could not understand why the dead would want to have imitation palaces built over them. The cemetery was vanity transmogrified into stone. Instead of growing more sensible in death, the inhabitants of the cemetery were sillier than they had been in life. Their monuments were meant to display how important they were. There were no fathers, brothers, sons, or grandmothers buried there, only public figures, the bearers of titles, degrees, and honors; even the postal clerk celebrated his chosen profession, his social significance—his dignity.</p><p>按照她的老习惯，她决定去墓地走走，使自己平静下来。蒙特帕里斯墓地是最近的，那里的坟墓上都是些小房子、小教堂。萨宾娜不明白，为什么死人想在头顶建起这些伪造的宫殿？墓地是正在化为石头的虚无。墓地的城民未能增强对死亡的敏感，比他们活着的时候更糊涂。他们的墓碑展示着身价，那里没有父亲、兄弟、儿子、祖母，只有社会形象——一些头衔、职位以及荣誉的被授予者。甚至一位邮政职员也夸示他的职业选择，他的社会意义——他的高贵地位。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Walking along a row of graves, she noticed people gathering for a burial. The funeral director had an armful of flowers and was giving one to each mourner. He handed one to Sabina as well. She joined the group. They made a detour past many monuments before they came to the grave, free for the moment of its heavy gravestone. She leaned over the hole. It was extremely deep. She dropped in the flower. It sailed down to the coffin in graceful somersaults. In Bohemia the graves were not so deep. In Paris the graves were deeper, just as the buildings were taller. Her eye fell on the stone, which lay next to the grave. It chilled her, and she hurried home.</p><p>沿着一排坟墓走去，她看到有些人正聚在一起下葬。丧事主持人把满抱鲜花逐一分发给送葬者，也给了萨宾娜一朵。她加入了那一伙，随他们绕过了许多墓碑，才来到墓穴，缓缓放下那沉沉的墓碑。她俯身看了看墓穴，深到了极点。一朵花抛下去，优雅飘摇地翻了几个筋斗才落到灵枢上。在波希米亚，墓穴没有这么深，巴黎的墓穴深些正如巴黎的房子也比彼希米亚的高。她的目光落在墓穴边的一块石头上，那块石头使她感到透骨的寒冷。她匆匆回家了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She thought about that stone all day. Why had it horrified her so?</p><p>她整整一天都想那石头。为什么石头能把她吓成这个样？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She answered herself: When graves are covered with stones, the dead can no longer get out.</p><p>她回答自己：坟墓上盖着那些石头，死人便永远不得翻身了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But the dead can't get out anyway! What difference does it make whether they're covered with soil or stones?</p><p>死人无论如何是不能翻身走出的！那么往他们身上盖泥土或是石头又有什么不一样呢？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The difference is that if a grave is covered with a stone it means we don't want the deceased to come back. The heavy stone tells the deceased:"Stay where you are!" </p><p>不同之处在于：如果攻上盖着石头，则意昧着我们不要死人回来了，沉重的石头告诉死者：“呆在你那儿吧！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>That made Sabina think about her father's grave. There was soil above his grave with flowers growing out of it and a maple tree reaching down to it, and the roots and flowers offered his corpse a path out of the grave. If her father had been covered with a stone, she would never have been able to communicate with him after he died, and hear his voice in the trees pardoning her.</p><p>这使萨宾娜想起了父亲的坟墓。那上面的泥土里长出了花朵，一棵枫树深深地扎了根。这树根和花朵给他打开了一条走出坟墓的道路。如果她父亲是用石头盖着，她就再也无法与死去的他交谈，无法从簌簌树叶中听出父亲原谅她的声音。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>What was it like in the cemetery where Tereza and Tomas were buried?</p><p>埋葬托马斯和特丽莎的墓地又怎么样呢？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Once more she started thinking about them. From time to time they would drive over to the next town and spend the night in a cheap hotel. That passage in the letter had caught her eye. It meant they were happy. And again she pictured Tomas as if he were one of her paintings: Don Juan in the foreground, a specious stage-set by a naive painter, and through a crack in the set—Tristan. He died as Tristan, not as Don Juan. Sabina's parents had died in the same week. Tomas and Tereza in the same second. Suddenly she missed Franz terribly.</p><p>她开始一次次想起他们。他们好几次开车去邻镇，在一家廉价的旅店里过夜。信中的这一段吸引了她的视线。这说明他们是快乐的。她又一次把托马斯当作自己的一幅画来构想：画的前景是唐璜，一位幼稚画家所作的浮华外景，穿过外景的裂缝看去，却是特里斯丹。他象特里斯丹一样死去，不象唐璜。萨宾娜的父亲与母亲是死于同一个星期，托马斯与特丽莎是死于同一秒。萨宾娜突然想念起弗兰茨来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When she told him about her cemetery walks, he gave a shiver of disgust and called cemeteries bone and stone dumps. A gulf of misunderstanding had immediately opened between them. Not until that day at the Montparnasse Cemetery did she see what he meant. She was sorry to have been so impatient with him. Perhaps if they had stayed together longer, Sabina and Franz would have begun to understand the words they used. Gradually, timorously, their vocabularies would have come together, like bashful lovers, and the music of one would have begun to intersect with the music of the other. But it was too late now.</p><p>她那时跟他说起墓地里的散步，他厌恶地颤抖着，把墓地说成一堆尸骨和石头。他们之间的误解鸿沟便随即展开。直到她到蒙特帕里斯墓地，她才明白了他的意思。她为自己待他那样不耐心而遗憾。如果他们能在一起呆得更久一些的话，他们是能够开始理解对方用语的。他们的词汇会象害羞的情人，慢慢地、怯生生地走到一起去。那么，一支旋律就会渐渐融人另一支旋律。但是，现在太晚了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Yes, it was too late, and Sabina knew she would leave Paris, move on, and on again, because were she to die here they would cover her up with a stone, and in the mind of a woman for whom no place is home the thought of an end to all flight is unbearable.</p><p>是的，太晚了。何况萨宾娜知道她应该离开巴黎，搬走，再搬走，如果她死在这里，他们会用石头盖在她身上。对于一个无家可归的女人来说，总是想着一切旅程的某个终点是不可忍受的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>11</p><p>11</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>All Franz's friends knew about Marie-Claude; they all knew about the girl with the oversized glasses. But no one knew about Sabina. Franz was wrong when he thought his wife had told her friends about her. Sabina was a beautiful woman, and Marie-Claude did not want people going about comparing their faces.</p><p>弗兰茨所有的朋友都知道克劳迪，也知道那位戴大号眼镜的姑娘，但没有人知道萨宾娜。弗兰茨误以为妻子与她的朋友谈萨灾娜，其实，萨宾娜是个漂亮女人，克劳迪不希望人家把自己与美人脸蛋相比较。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Because Franz was so afraid of being found out, he had never asked for any of Sabina's paintings or drawings or even a snapshot of her. As a result, she disappeared from his life without a trace. There was not a scrap of tangible evidence to show that he had spent the most wonderful year of his life with her.</p><p>弗兰茨如此害怕私情败露，因此从未向萨宾娜要过一张她的油画、草图，甚至一张她的快照。结果，她没留下任何痕迹地从他生活里消失了，没有一点点确实的东西可以表明，他曾与她在一起度过了最最美好的时光。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Which only increased his desire to remain faithful to her.</p><p>这只能更使他决心保留对她的忠诚。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sometimes when they were alone in his flat together, the girl would lift her eyes from a book, throw him an inquiring glance, and say:"What are you thinking about?" </p><p>有时候，他与那姑娘一起呆在他的屋里，她会目光离开书本，疑惑地瞥他一眼：“你在想什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sitting in his armchair, staring up at the ceiling, Franz always found some plausible response, but in fact he was thinking of Sabina.</p><p>弗兰茨坐在椅子上盯着天花板，总是找一些似乎有理的话来回答她，事实上他在想念萨宾娜。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Whenever he published an article in a scholarly journal, the girl was the first to read it and discuss it with him. But all he could think of was what Sabina would have said about it. Everything he did, he did for Sabina, the way Sabina would have liked to see it done.</p><p>不论他什么时候在学术杂志上发表了文章，姑娘都是第一个读它，与他作些讨论。而他心里想的却是萨宾娜会对他怎么说。他做的每一件事，都是为萨宾娜而做，是用萨宾娜愿意看到的方式去做。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was a perfectly innocent form of infidelity and one eminently suited to Franz, who would never have done his bespectacled student-mistress any harm. He nourished the cult of Sabina more as religion than as love.</p><p>他绝不做任何事情来伤害那位戴眼镜的学生情妇，因此这种不忠的绝对纯真形式，对弗兰茨来说是特别合适。他培养着对萨宾娜的狂热崇拜，这种祟湃更象宗教信仰而不是爱情。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Indeed, according to the theology of that religion it was Sabina who had sent him the girl. Between his earthly love and his unearthly love, therefore, there was perfect peace. And if unearthly love must (for theological reasons) contain a strong dose of the inexplicable and incomprehensible (we have only to recall the dictionary of misunderstood words and the long lexicon of misunderstandings!), his earthly love rested on true understanding.</p><p>的确，从神学的角度来说，是萨宾娜送给了他那位姑娘。在他的人之爱和神之爱两者中间，是绝对的和平。如果他的神之爱（基于神学理由）必定含有一剂不可解说、不可理喻的烈药（我们只须回忆一下那本误解词典和一系列误解词汇！），他的人之爱却建立在真实的理解上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The student-mistress was much younger than Sabina, and the musical composition of her life had scarcely been outlined; she was grateful to Franz for the motifs he gave her to insert. Franz's Grand March was now her creed as well. Music was now her Dionysian intoxication. They often went dancing together. They lived in truth, and nothing they did was secret. They sought out the company of friends, colleagues, students, and strangers, and enjoyed sitting, drinking, and chatting with them. They took frequent excursions to the Alps. Franz would bend over, the girl hopped onto his back, and off he ran through the meadows, declaiming at the top of his voice a long German poem his mother had taught him as a child. The girl laughed with glee, admiring his legs, shoulders, and lungs as she clasped his neck.</p><p>学生情妇比萨宾娜年轻得多，生命的乐曲简直还只有个轮廓。她感谢弗兰茨给了她生活的主题。弗兰茨的伟大进军，现在也成了她的信念。音乐现在是使她沉醉的狂欢节。他们常常一起去跳舞。生活在真实之中，没有什么秘密。他们与朋友、同事、学生以及陌生人交往，高兴地与他们坐在一起，喝酒，聊天。他们经常去阿尔卑斯山作短途旅行。弗兰茨会弯下腰来，让姑娘跳到他背上。他走过草地时又会让她跳下来。他会用最高的音量，给她读一首小时候从母亲那儿学来的德国长待。姑娘欢乐地哈哈大笑，崇拜他的腿、肩膀，死死勾着他脖子时，还崇拜他的肺。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The only thing she could not quite fathom was the curious sympathy he had for the countries occupied by the Russian empire. On the anniversary of the invasion, they attended a memorial meeting organized by a Czech group in Geneva.</p><p>她唯一揣摩不透的，是他对俄国人所占领国家的奇怪同情。一个纪念入侵的日子里，他出席了一个由日内瓦的捷克人组织的纪念性集会。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The room was nearly empty. The speaker had artificially waved gray hair. He read out a long speech that bored even the few enthusiasts who had come to hear it. His French was grammatically correct but heavily accented. From time to time, to stress a point, he would raise his index finger, as if threatening the audience.</p><p>房子几乎是空的，那位发言人装模作样地晃动着灰头发，长长的发言稿使得几个尽管热心的听众也觉乏味，他的法语语法正确却带有很重的外国腔。他为了强调某一点，不时举起食指，象是在威胁听众。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The girl with the glasses could barely suppress her yawns, while Franz smiled blissfully at her side. The longer he looked at the pleasing gray-haired man with the admirable index finger, the more he saw him as a secret messenger, an angelic intermediary between him and his goddess. He closed his eyes and dreamed. He closed his eyes as he had closed them on Sabina's body in fifteen European hotels and one in America.</p><p>眼镜姑娘没法抑制住自己的哈欠，而弗兰茨却在她身旁灿然微笑。他越是看着那可爱的灰头发和那令人倾慕的食指，他就越把那人看成一个秘密信使，一个尽职于他与女神之间的上天使臣。他合上眼，浮想联翩。就象当年在十五个欧洲旅馆和一个美国旅馆里他在萨宾娜身上闭上眼睛一样，他现在也闭上了眼睛。</p></div>
