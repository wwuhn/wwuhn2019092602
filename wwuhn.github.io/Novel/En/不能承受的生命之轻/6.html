<div class='layout'><p>PART SIX The Grand March</p><p>六、伟大的进军</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>1</p><p>l</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Not until 1980 were we able to read in the Sunday Times how Stalin's son, Yakov, died. Captured by the Germans during the Second World War, he was placed in a camp together with a group of British officers. They shared a latrine. Stalin's son habitually left a foul mess. The British officers resented having their latrine smeared with shit, even if it was the shit of the son of the most powerful man in the world. They brought the matter to his attention. He took offense. They brought it to his attention again and again, and tried to make him clean the latrine. He raged, argued, and fought. Finally, he demanded a hearing with the camp commander. He wanted the commander to act as arbiter. But the arrogant German refused to talk about shit. Stalin's son could not stand the humiliation. Crying out to heaven in the most terrifying of Russian curses, he took a running jump into the electrified barbed-wire fence that surrounded the camp. He hit the target. His body, which would never again make a mess of the Britishers' latrine, was pinned to the wire.</p><p>直到1980年，我们才从《星期天时报》上读到了斯大林的儿子、雅可夫的死因。他在第二次世界大战期间被德国人俘虏，与一群英国军官关在一起，并共用一个厕所。英国军官不满意斯大林的儿子把厕所弄得又臭又乱的恶习，不满意他们的厕所被大便弄得很脏，尽管这是世界上最有权力者的儿子的大便。他们提醒他注意此事，把他惹火了。他们一而再、再而三地提醒他注意，让他把厕所弄干净。他发怒，吵架，动武，最后诉诸集中营的长官，希望长官主持公道。但那位高傲的德国人拒绝谈论大便的问题。斯大林的儿子不能忍受这种耻辱，用最吓人的俄国脏话破口大骂，飞身扑向环绕着集中营的铁丝电网。他扑中了，身体被钉在电网上，再也不会把英国人的厕所弄脏了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>2</p><p>2</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Stalin's son had a hard time of it. All evidence points to the conclusion that his father killed the woman by whom he had the boy. Young Stalin was therefore both the Son of God (because his father was revered like God) and His cast-off. People feared him twofold: he could injure them by both his wrath (he was, after all, Stalin's son) and his favor (his father might punish his cast-off son's friends in order to punish him).</p><p>斯大林的儿子有一段艰难岁月。所有的证据表明，他父亲杀害了给他生这个孩子的女人。于是，小斯大林既是上帝的儿子（因为他父亲被尊崇得如同上帝），又是上帝的弃儿。人们从两重意义上都怕他：他加害于人，可以是因为震怒（毕竟，他是斯大林的儿子），也可以是出于喜爱（父亲会惩罚弃儿的朋友从而达到惩罚他的目的），</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Rejection and privilege, happiness and woe—no one felt more concretely than Yakov how interchangeable opposites are, how short the step from one pole of human existence to the other.</p><p>遗弃和特权，幸福与痛苦——没有谁比雅可夫感受得更具体，这对立的两面是如何交替，从人类存在的一极到另外一极，其间距离是如何短促。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Then, at the very outset of the war, he fell prisoner to the Germans, and other prisoners, belonging to an incomprehensible, standoffish nation that had always been intrinsically repulsive to him, accused him of being dirty. Was he, who bore on his shoulders a drama of the highest order (as fallen angel and Son of God), to undergo judgment not for something sublime (in the realm of God and the angels) but for shit? Were the very highest of drama and the very lowest so vertiginously close?</p><p>战争一开始，他成了德国人的阶下囚，另一些囚徒属于冷漠傲岸和不可理解的民族，总是出自内心地排斥他，指责他的肮脏。他，作为肩负着最高级戏剧性的人，能忍受这种不是为了崇高的东西（上帝与天使范围内的东西），而是为了大便的评判么？难道最高级与最低级的戏剧是如此令人晕眩地逼近么？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Vertiginously close? Can proximity cause vertigo?</p><p>令人晕眩之近？太近会引起晕眩？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It can. When the north pole comes so close as to touch the south pole, the earth disappears and man finds himself in a void that makes his head spin and beckons him to fall.</p><p>会的。当北极近到可以触到南极，地球便消失了，人会发现自己坠入真空，头会旋转，导致他倒下。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>If rejection and privilege are one and the same, if there is no difference between the sublime and the paltry, if the Son of God can undergo judgment for shit, then human existence loses its dimensions and becomes unbearably light. When Stalin's son ran up to the electrified wire and hurled his body at it, the fence was like the pan of a scales sticking pitifully up in the air, lifted by the infinite lightness of a world that has lost its dimensions.</p><p>如果遭受遗弃与享有特权是一回事，毫无二致，如果崇高与低贱之间没有区别，如果上帝的儿子能忍受事关大便的评判，那么人类存在便失去了其空间度向，成为了不可承受的轻。当斯大林的儿子朝电网跑去，将自己的身体投向电网时，这架电网在失去度向的世界里被无边无际的轻所承托，象天平的秤盘，遗憾可悲地升向空中。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Stalin's son laid down his life for shit. But a death for shit is not a senseless death. The Germans who sacrificed their lives to expand their country's territory to the east, the Russians who died to extend their country's power to the west—yes, they died for something idiotic, and their deaths have no meaning or general validity. Amid the general idiocy of the war, the death of Stalin's son stands out as the sole metaphysical death.</p><p>斯大林的儿子为大便献出了生命。但是为大便而死并非无谓牺牲。那些为了向东方扩充领土而献身的德国人，那些为了向西方扩展权势而丧命的俄国人——是的，他们为某种愚昧的东西而死，死得既无意义，也不正当。在这次战争总的愚蠢中，斯大林儿子的死是唯一杰出的形而上之死。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>3</p><p>3</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When I was small and would leaf through the Old Testament retold for children and illustrated in engravings by Gustave Dore, I saw the Lord God standing on a cloud. He was an old man with eyes, nose, and a long beard, and I would say to myself that if He had a mouth, He had to eat. And if He ate, He had intestines. But that thought always gave me a fright, because even though I come from a family that was not particularly religious, I felt the idea of a divine intestine to be sacrilegious.</p><p>我小的时候，曾翻阅过专给孩子们看的那种《旧约全书》，书上有多雷的木刻插画。我看见上帝站在云上，是个有鼻子有眼还有长胡须的老人。我总是想，如果他有嘴，就得吃东西，如果他吃东西，就得有肠子。这种想法总使我害怕。尽管我出生于一个不太信宗教的家庭，我感到有关神的肠子的想法是在褒渎神明。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Spontaneously, without any theological training, I, a child, grasped the incompatibility of God and shit and thus came to question the basic thesis of Christian anthropology, namely, that man was created in God's image. Either/or: either man was created in God's image—and God has intestines!—or God lacks intestines and man is not like Him.</p><p>我，一个没有受过任何神学训导的孩子，很自然，会抓住上帝与大便不能共存这个事实，来怀疑基督教人类学中的基本论点。就是说，人是按照上帝的形象造的吗？二者必居其一：人是按照上帝的形象造的——上帝就有肠子！——或者说上帝没有肠子，人就不象他。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The ancient Gnostics felt as I did at the age of five. In the second century, the great Gnostic master Valentinus resolved the damnable dilemma by claiming that Jesus ate and drank, but did not defecate. </p><p>古老的诺斯替教与我五岁时的想法是一致的。早在二世纪，伟大的诺斯替教派大师瓦伦廷解决了这个该死的两难推理，声称：“基督能吃能喝，但不排粪。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Shit is a more onerous theological problem than is evil. Since God gave man freedom, we can, if need be, accept the idea that He is not responsible for man's crimes. The responsibility for shit, however, rests entirely with Him, the Creator of man.</p><p>与其说粪便是邪恶的，倒不如它是—个麻烦的神学问题。自从上帝给人以自由，如果需要的话我们可以接受这种观念：他无须对人的罪过负责，然而作为人的创造者，他对人的粪便应负完全的责任。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>4</p><p>4</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In the fourth century, Saint Jerome completely rejected the notion that Adam and Eve had sexual intercourse in Paradise. On the other hand, Johannes Scotus Erigena, the great ninth-century theologian, accepted the idea. He believed, moreover, that Adam's virile member could be made to rise like an arm or a leg, when and as its owner wished. We must not dismiss this fancy as the recurrent dream of a man obsessed with the threat of impotence. Erigena's idea has a different meaning. If it were possible to raise the penis by means of a simple command, then sexual excitement would have no place in the world. The penis would rise not because we are excited but because we order it to do so. What the great theologian found incompatible with Paradise was not sexual intercourse and the attendant pleasure; what he found incompatible with Paradise was excitement. Bear in mind: There was pleasure in Paradise, but no excitement.</p><p>到第四世纪，圣哲罗姆完全否定了亚当和夏娃在伊甸园里做爱的说法。另一方面，九世纪伟大的神学家埃里金纳则接受这一观点，并且还相信，亚当的男性器官只要主人愿意，就可以象臂或腿一样举起。我们不能将这一设想，当作男人害怕阳萎的寻常旧梦而随意打发。埃里金纳的观点有不同的意义。如果认为靠简单命令的方式就可以使阴茎勃举，阴茎的勃举不是由于我们亢奋，而是我们的命令使然，那么世界上就没有性亢奋的位置。这位伟大的神学家发现与天堂不能共存的，并非性交及其随之而来的愉悦，他发现与天堂不能共存的是性亢奋。记住：天堂里有愉悦，但没有亢奋。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Erigena's argument holds the key to a theological justification (in other words, a theodicy) of shit. As long as man was allowed to remain in Paradise, either (like Valentinus' Jesus) he did not defecate at all, or (as would seem more likely) he did not look upon shit as something repellent. Not until after God expelled man from Paradise did He make him feel disgust. Man began to hide what shamed him, and by the time he removed the veil, he was blinded by a great light. Thus, immediately after his introduction to disgust, he was introduced to excitement. Without shit (in both the literal and figurative senses of the word), there would be no sexual love as we know it, accompanied by pounding heart and blinded senses.</p><p>埃里金纳的论点抓住了有关粪便助神学辩解要害。只要人获准留在天堂，他或者（象瓦伦廷的耶稣）根本不排粪，或者（看来更有可能）不把粪便看成令人反感的东西。直到上帝把人逐出天堂，他才使人对粪便感到厌恶。人才开始遮羞，才开始揭开面罩，被一道强光照花双眼。于是，紧接着厌恶感的取得，人的生活中又引进了性亢奋。如果没有粪便（从这个词的原义和比喻意义来看），就不会有我们所知道的性爱，以及伴随而来的心跳加快、两眼昏花。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In Part Three of this novel I told the tale of Sabina standing half-naked with a bowler hat on her head and the fully dressed Tomas at her side. There is something I failed to mention at the time. While she was looking at herself in the mirror, excited by her self-denigration, she had a fantasy of Tomas seating her on the toilet in her bowler hat and watching her void her bowels. Suddenly her heart began to pound and, on the verge of fainting, she pulled Tomas down to the rug and immediately let out an orgasmic shout.</p><p>在我小说的第三章里，我讲到了萨宾娜半裸着身子，头上戴着圆顶礼帽，同穿戴整齐的托马斯站在一起。当时我有些事没来得及提到。她从镜子里看到自己时，因为她的自我亵渎而亢奋。她忽发奇想，似乎看到托马斯戴着圆顶礼帽，正使自己坐在抽水马桶上并看着自己排粪。她的心突然剧跳起来，几近昏晕的边缘。她把托马斯拖倒在地毯上，立刻发出了性高潮的叫喊。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>5</p><p>5</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The dispute between those who believe that the world was created by God and those who think it came into being of its own accord deals with phenomena that go beyond our reason and experience. Much more real is the line separating those who doubt being as it is granted to man (no matter how or by whom) from those who accept it without reservation.</p><p>有些人相信世界是上帝创造的，有些人认为世界乃自然生成，这两种人之间的争论涉及到一些超越我们理智和经验的现象。更为现实的倒是这条界线，区分着两类人，后者怀疑人的生命是受赐的（不论如何赐予，以及由谁来赐予），前者却毫无保留地接受赐予观点。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Behind all the European faiths, religious and political, we find the first chapter of Genesis, which tells us that the world was created properly, that human existence is good, and that we are therefore entitled to multiply. Let us call this basic faith a categorical agreement with being.</p><p>在欧洲所有宗教和政治的信仰后面，我们都可以找到《创世纪》第一章，它告诉我们，世界的创造是合理的，人类的存在是美好的，我们因此才得以繁衍。让我们把这种基本信念称为无条件认同生命存在。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The fact that until recently the word shit appeared in print as s— has nothing to do with moral considerations. You can't claim that shit is immoral, after all! The objection to shit is a metaphysical one. The daily defecation session is daily proof of the unacceptability of Creation. Either/or: either shit is acceptable (in which case don't lock yourself in the bathroom!) or we are created in an unacceptable manner.</p><p>直到最近，“大粪（Shit）”这个词才以“s……”的形式出现在印刷品中，这个事实与道德上的考虑毫无关系。你毕竟不能说大粪是不道德的！对大粪的反对是形而上的。每天排出大粪的程序，就是创世说不可接受的每天的证据。二者必居其一：或者大粪是可以接受的（在这种情况下，不要把你锁在卫生间里！），或者，我们就是被一种不可接受的方式所造就。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It follows, then, that the aesthetic ideal of the categorical agreement with being is a world in which shit is denied and everyone acts as though it did not exist. This aesthetic ideal is called kitsch.</p><p>那么，无条件认同生命存在的美学理想，必然是这样一个世界，在那里，大粪被否定，每个人都做出这事根本不存在的样子。这种美学理想可称为“媚俗作态”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Kitsch is a German word born in the middle of the sentimental nineteenth century, and from German it entered all Western languages. Repeated use, however, has obliterated its original metaphysical meaning: kitsch is the absolute denial of shit, in both the literal and the figurative senses of the word; kitsch excludes everything from its purview which is essentially unacceptable in human existence.</p><p>“kiscll”是个德国词，产生于伤感的十九世纪的中期，后来进入了所有的西方语言。经过人们的反复运用，它形而上的初始含义便渐渐淹没了：不论是从大粪的原义还是从比喻意义上来说，媚俗就是对大粪的绝对否定；媚俗就是制定人类生存中一个基本不能接受的范围，并排拒来自它这个范围内的一切。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>6</p><p>6</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sabina's initial inner revolt against Communism was aesthetic rather than ethical in character. What repelled her was not nearly so much the ugliness of the Communist world (ruined castles transformed into cow sheds) as the mask of beauty it tried to wear—in other words, Communist kitsch. The model of Communist kitsch is the ceremony called May Day.</p><p>萨宾娜对国家当局最初的内心反感，与其说是具有道德性，还不如说带有美学性。她倒不怎么反感当局管辖下的丑陋（把荒废的城堡变成牛栏），却厌恶当局企图戴上美的假面具——换句话来说，就是当局的媚俗作态。当局媚俗作态的样板就是称为“五一节”的庆典。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She had seen May Day parades during the time when people were still enthusiastic or still did their best to feign enthusiasm. The women all wore red, white, and blue blouses, and the public, looking on from balconies and windows, could make out various five-pointed stars, hearts, and letters when the marchers went into formation. Small brass bands accompanied the individual groups, keeping everyone in step. As a group approached the reviewing stand, even the most blase faces would beam with dazzling smiles, as if trying to prove they were properly joyful or, to be more precise, in proper agreement. Nor were they merely expressing political agreement with Communism; no, theirs was an agreement with being as such. The May Day ceremony drew its inspiration from the deep well of the categorical agreement with being. The unwritten, unsung motto of the parade was not "Long live Communism!" but "Long live life!" The power and cunning of Communist politics lay in the fact that it appropriated this slogan. For it was this idiotic tautology ("Long live life!") which attracted people indifferent to the theses of Communism to the Communist parade.</p><p>她看见过这种庆典游行，是在人们依然有热情或依然尽力装出热情的年代。女人们穿上红色、白色以及蓝色的衣裙，游行者队伍齐步行进时，阳台上或窗子前观看的老百姓便亮出各种五角星、红心、印刷字体。铜管小乐队伴随着一个个游行群体，使大家的步伐一致。当某个群体接近检阅台时，即使是最厌世的面孔上也要现出令入迷惑不解的微笑，似乎极力证明他们极其欢欣，更准确地说，是他们完全认同。不仅仅是认同当局的政治，不，更是对生命存在的认同。从无条件认同生命存在的深井里，这种庆典汲取了灵感。没有写出来、没有唱出来的游行口号不是“共产主义万岁！”而是“生活万岁！”这种白痴式的同义反复（“生活万岁！”），使那些漠然处之的人对当局的论点和游行也发生了兴趣。对这一口号的盗用，表现了当局的威力和灵巧。</p></div>

<div class='layout'><p>Ten years later (by which time she was living in America), a friend of some friends, an American senator, took Sabina for a drive in his gigantic car, his four children bouncing up and down in the back. The senator stopped the car in front of a stadium with an artificial skating rink, and the children jumped out and started running along the large expanse of grass surrounding it. Sitting behind the wheel and gazing dreamily after the four little bounding figures, he said to Sabina, "Just look at them." And describing a circle with his arm, a circle that was meant to take in stadium, grass, and children, he added, "Now that's what I call happiness." </p><p>十年后（这时她住在美国），萨宾娜朋友之一，一位美国参议员，用他的大轿车带她出去兜风。他的四个孩子在车后座跳上蹦下。参议员把车停在一个带有人造滑冰场的体育馆前面，四个孩子从车上跳出来，开始在四周宽阔的草坪上跑起来。参议员坐在方向盘后，美美地看着那四个活蹦乱跳的小身影，对萨宾娜说：“看看他们吧，”他用手臂划了个圆圈，把运动场、草地以及孩子都划在圈里，“瞧，这就是我所说的幸福。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Behind his words there was more than joy at seeing children run and grass grow; there was a deep understanding of the plight of a refugee from a Communist country where, the senator was convinced, no grass grew or children ran.</p><p>他的话里面，不仅有看着孩子奔跑和绿草生长的欢欣，还有对一个来自共产党国家的难民的深深理解。参议员深信，在那个国家里是不会有绿草生长和孩子奔跑的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>At that moment an image of the senator standing on a reviewing stand in a Prague square flashed through Sabina's mind. The smile on his face was the smile Communist statesmen beamed from the height of their reviewing stand to the identically smiling citizens in the parade below.</p><p>一瞬间，萨宾娜的脑子中闪现过一个幻影：这位参议员正站在布拉格广场的一个检阅台上。他脸上的微笑，就是那些当权者在高高的检阅台上，对下面带着同样笑容的游行公民发出的笑。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>8</p><p>8</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>How did the senator know that children meant happiness? Could he see into their souls? What if, the moment they were out of sight, three of them jumped the fourth and began beating him up?</p><p>参议员怎么知道孩子就意昧着幸福？他能看透他们的灵魂？如果此刻他们都不见了，其中三个向第四个扑过去并狠狠揍他，那又意味着什么？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The senator had only one argument in his favor: his feeling. When the heart speaks, the mind finds it indecent to object. In the realm of kitsch, the dictatorship of the heart reigns supreme.</p><p>参议员只有一条理由对他有利：他的感情。心灵和大脑经常意见不合抵触龃龉。而在媚俗作态的王国里，心灵的专政是最高的统治。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The feeling induced by kitsch must be a kind the multitudes can share. Kitsch may not, therefore, depend on an unusual situation; it must derive from the basic images people have engraved in their memories: the ungrateful daughter, the neglected father, children running on the grass, the motherland betrayed, first love.</p><p>媚俗所引起的感情是一种大众可以分享的东西。媚俗可以无须依赖某种非同寻常的情势，是铭刻在人们记忆中的某些基本印象把它派生出来的：忘恩负义的女儿，被冷落了的父亲，草地上奔跑的孩子，被出卖的祖国，第一次恋情。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Kitsch causes two tears to flow in quick succession. The first tear says: How nice to see children running on the grass!</p><p>媚俗引起两种前后紧密相连的泪流。第一种眼泪说：看见孩子们在草地上奔跑着，多好啊！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The second tear says: How nice to be moved, together with all mankind, by children running on the grass!</p><p>第二种眼泪说：和所有的人类在一起，被草地上奔跑的孩子们所感动，多好啊！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It is the second tear that makes kitsch kitsch.</p><p>第二种眼泪使媚俗更媚俗。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The brotherhood of man on earth will be possible only on a base of kitsch.</p><p>地球上人的博爱将只可能以媚俗作态为基础。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>9</p><p>9</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And no one knows this better than politicians. Whenever a camera is in the offing, they immediately run to the nearest child, lift it in the air, kiss it on the cheek. Kitsch is the aesthetic ideal of all politicians and all political parties and movements.</p><p>没有比政客更懂得这一点了。无论何时，一个照相机即将开拍，他们会立即奔向最近前的孩子，把他举到空中，亲吻他的脸蛋。媚俗是所有政客的美学理想，也是所有政容党派和政治活动的美学理想。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Those of us who live in a society where various political tendencies exist side by side and competing influences cancel or limit one another can manage more or less to escape the kitsch inquisition: the individual can preserve his individuality; the artist can create unusual works. But whenever a single political movement corners power, we find ourselves in the realm of totalitarian kitsch.</p><p>各种政治倾向并存的社会里，竞争中的各种影响互相抵销或限制，我们居于其中，还能设法或多或少地逃避这种媚俗作态的统治：各人可以保留自己的个性，艺术家可以创造不见的作品。但是，无论何时一旦某个政治运动垄断了权力，我们便发观自己置身于媚俗作态的极权统治王国。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When I say totalitarian, what I mean is that everything that infringes on kitsch must be banished for life: every display of individualism (because a deviation from the collective is a spit in the eye of the smiling brotherhood); every doubt (because anyone who starts doubting details will end by doubting life itself); all irony (because in the realm of kitsch everything must be taken quite seriously); and the mother who abandons her family or the man who prefers men to women, thereby calling into question the holy decree Be fruitful and multiply. </p><p>我说到极权统治，我的意思是一切侵犯媚俗的东西必将从生活中清除掉：每一种个性的展示（在博爱者微笑的眼里，任何偏离集体的东西均遭藐视）；每一种怀疑（任何以怀疑局部始的人，都将以怀疑生活自身而终）；所有的嘲讽（在媚俗的王国里，一切都必须严肃对待），以及抛弃了家庭的女人，或者爱男性胜过爱女性的男人。于是，“丰富而且多彩”这样神圣的法令，就成为了疑问。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In this light, we can regard the gulag as a septic tank used by totalitarian kitsch to dispose of its refuse.</p><p>根据这一点，我们可以把古拉格当作媚俗作态极极统治用来处理垃圾的化粪池。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>10</p><p>10</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The decade immediately following the Second World War was a time of the most horrible Stalinist terror. It was the time when Tereza's father was arrested on some piddling charge and ten-year-old Tereza was thrown out of their flat. It was also the time when twenty-year-old Sabina was studying at the Academy of Fine Arts. There, her professor of Marxism expounded on the following theory of socialist art: Soviet society had made such progress that the basic conflict was no longer between good and evil but between good and better. So shit (that is, whatever is essentially unacceptable) could exist only on the other side (in America, for instance), and only from there, from the outside, as something alien (a spy, for instance), could it penetrate the world of good and better. </p><p>紧接着第二次世界大战的十年，是最可怕的斯大林恐怖时期。当时特丽莎的父亲由于鬼混而被捕，十岁的特丽莎被逐出家门。这也是二十岁的萨宾娜在美术学院学习的时候。在那里，她的马列教授向她解释社会主义艺术的理论：社会主义社会如此飞跃进展，其基本矛盾不再是好与坏的矛盾，而是好与更好的矛盾。所以大粪（那是无论如何也根本不能接受的了）只能存在“在那一边（比如说，在美国）”，象一些异己的东西（比如说特务），只有从那里，从外部，才能打入这个“好与更好”的世界。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And in fact, Soviet films, which flooded the cinemas of all Communist countries in that crudest of times, were saturated with incredible innocence and chastity. The greatest conflict that could occur between two Russians was a lovers' misunderstanding: he thought she no longer loved him; she thought he no longer loved her. But in the final scene they would fall into each other's arms, tears of happiness trickling down their cheeks.</p><p>事实上，在那最严酷的时代，苏联电影在所有“好与更好”的国家泛滥。电影中充满了不可信的纯洁和高雅。两个苏联人之间可以出现的最大冲突，无非是情人的误会：他以为她不再爱他；她以为他不再爱她。但在最后一幕，两人都投入对方的怀抱，幸福的热泪在脸上流淌。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The current conventional interpretation of these films is this: that they showed the Communist ideal, whereas Communist reality was worse.</p><p>对这些电影流行的老一套解释就是：电影表现了共产主义的理想，现实当然比理想要差一些。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sabina always rebelled against that interpretation. Whenever she imagined the world of Soviet kitsch becoming a reality, she felt a shiver run down her back. She would unhesitatingly prefer life in a real Communist regime with all its persecution and meat queues. Life in the real Communist world was still livable. In the world of the Communist ideal made real, in that world of grinning idiots, she would have nothing to say, she would die of horror within a week.</p><p>萨宾娜总是反感这些解释。只要一想到苏式媚俗的世界行将成为现实，就感到背上一阵发麻。她毫不犹豫地愿意选择当局统治下那种受迫害和受宰割的现实生活，这种现实生活还是能过下去的。如果在那种理想式的现实世界里，那些白痴们咧嘴傻笑的世界里，她将无话可说，一个星期之内就会被吓死。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The feeling Soviet kitsch evoked in Sabina strikes me as very much like the horror Tereza experienced in her dream of being marched around a swimming pool with a group of naked women and forced to sing cheerful songs with them while corpses floated just below the surface of the pool. Tereza could not address a single question, a single word, to any of the women; the only response she would have got was the next stanza of the current song. She could not even give any of them a secret wink; they would immediately have pointed her out to the man standing in the basket above the pool, and he would have shot her dead.</p><p>苏式媚俗给萨宾娜的感觉，非常象特丽莎梦中所经历的恐怖一样震动了我。特丽莎与一群裸体女人绕着游泳池行进，被迫高兴地唱歌。下面的水面上漂浮着一具具尸体。特丽莎不能对任何女人提一个问题，说一个字，唯一能够做出的反应，就是接唱下一段流行歌。她甚至不能对她们任何人偷偷眨眼，她们会立即向那个游泳池上篮子里的男人指出她来，他将把她枪毙。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Tereza's dream reveals the true function of kitsch: kitsch is a folding screen set up to curtain off death.</p><p>特丽莎的梦揭示了媚俗的真实作用：媚俗是一道为掩盖死亡而关起来的屏幕。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>11</p><p>11</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In the realm of totalitarian kitsch, all answers are given in advance and preclude any questions. It follows, then, that the true opponent of totalitarian kitsch is the person who asks questions. A question is like a knife that slices through the stage backdrop and gives us a look at what lies hidden behind it. In fact, that was exactly how Sabina had explained the meaning of her paintings to Tereza: on the surface, an intelligible lie; underneath, the unintelligible truth showing through.</p><p>在媚俗作态的极权统治王国里，所有答案都是预先给定的，对任何问题都有效。因此，媚俗极权统治的真正死敌就是爱提问题的人。一个问题就象一把刀，会划破舞台上的景幕，让我们看到藏在后面的东西。事实上，这就是萨宾娜向特丽莎解释的自己画作的准确意义：表面上是明白无误的谎言，底下却透出神秘莫测的真理。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But the people who struggle against what we call totalitarian regimes cannot function with queries and doubts. They, too, need certainties and simple truths to make the multitudes understand, to provoke collective tears.</p><p>但是，反对我们称为媚俗作态极权统治的这种东西的人们，感到质问和怀疑无补于事，他们也需要确定而简单的真理，让大众理解，激发群体的眼泪。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sabina had once had an exhibit that was organized by a political organization in Germany. When she picked up the catalogue, the first thing she saw was a picture of herself with a drawing of barbed wire superimposed on it. Inside she found a biography that read like the life of a saint or martyr: she had suffered, struggled against injustice, been forced to abandon her bleeding homeland, yet was carrying on the struggle. Her paintings are a struggle for happiness was the final sentence.</p><p>德国一个政治组织曾为萨宾娜举办过一次画展。她打开目录，第一张图就是自己的照片，上面添画了一些铁丝网。她在照片旁边，还发现了一份读上去象某位圣女或某位烈士的小传；她遭受过极大的痛苦，为反对非义而斗争，被迫放弃了正在流血的家园，却继续在斗争着。“她的画作是争取幸福的斗争”，文章以这句话而告结束。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She protested, but they did not understand her.</p><p>她抗议，但他们不能理解她。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Do you mean that modern art isn't persecuted under Communism?</p><p>你是说共产主义不迫害现代艺术吗？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"My enemy is kitsch, not Communism!" she replied, infuriated.</p><p>“我的敌人是媚俗，不是共产主义！”她愤怒地回答。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>From that time on, she began to insert mystifications in her biography, and by the time she got to America she even managed to hide the fact that she was Czech. It was all merely a desperate attempt to escape the kitsch that people wanted to make of her life.</p><p>那以后，她开始在自己的小传中故弄玄虚，到美国后，甚至设法隐瞒自己是个捷克人的事实。唯一的目的，就是不顾一切地试图逃离人们要强加在她生活中的媚俗。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>12</p><p>12</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She stood in front of her easel with a half-finished canvas on it, the old man in the armchair behind her observing every stroke of her brush.</p><p>她站在画架前，上面有一幅未完成的作品。身后椅子上的老人，仔细观察着她的每一笔触。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It's time we went home," he said at last with a glance at his watch.</p><p>“该回家了。”他终于看了看表。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She laid down her palette and went into the bathroom to wash. The old man raised himself out of the armchair and reached for his cane, which was leaning against a table. The door of the studio led directly out to the lawn. It was growing dark. Fifty feet away was a white clapboard house. The ground-floor windows were lit. Sabina was moved by the two windows shining out into the dying day.</p><p>她放下调色板，去卫生间洗手。老人也使自己从椅子里站起来，去拿斜靠在泉边的拐杖。画室的门通向外边的草地。天已渐渐落黑了，五十英尺开外，是一栋白色的隔板房，一楼的窗口亮着灯光。萨宾娜被这两个光辉投照着暮色的窗口感动了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>All her life she had proclaimed kitsch her enemy. But hadn't she in fact been carrying it with her? Her kitsch was her image of home, all peace, quiet, and harmony, and ruled by a loving mother and wise father. It was an image that took shape within her after the death of her parents. The less her life resembled that sweetest of dreams, the more sensitive she was to its magic, and more than once she shed tears when the ungrateful daughter in a sentimental film embraced the neglected father as the windows of the happy family's house shone out into the dying day.</p><p>她一生都宣称媚俗是死敌，但实际上她难道就不曾有过媚俗吗？她的媚俗是关于家庭的幻象，一切都那么安宁，那么静谈，那么和谐，由一位可爱的母亲和一位聪慧的父亲掌管。这种幻觉是双亲死后她脑子里形成的。她的生活越是不似那甜美的梦，她就越是对这梦境的魔力表现出敏感。当她看到伤感影片中忘思负义的女儿终于拥抱无人关心的苍苍老父，每当她看到幸福家庭的窗口向迷蒙暮色投照出光辉，她就不止一次地流出泪水。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She had met the old man in New York. He was rich and liked paintings. He lived alone with his wife, also aging, in a house in the country. Facing the house, but still on his land, stood an old stable. He had had it remodeled into a studio for Sabina and would follow the movements of her brush for days on end.</p><p>她是在纽约遇见这位老人的。他富裕而且爱画，身边只有上了年纪的老伴，住在一栋乡间房舍里。正对着那房舍，他的土地上有一间旧马厩。他为萨宾娜把马厩改建成画室，而且每天都目随萨宾娜的画笔运行，直到黄昏。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Now all three of them were having supper together. The old woman called Sabina my daughter, but all indications would lead one to believe the opposite, namely, that Sabina was the mother and that her two children doted on her, worshipped her, would do anything she asked.</p><p>现在他们三人一起吃晚饭。老太太把萨宾娜唤作“我的女儿”，但一切迹象都会使人导出相反的结论，就是说，萨宾娜倒是母亲，而她的这两个孩子喜欢她，崇拜她，愿意做她所要求的一切。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Had she then, herself on the threshold of old age, found the parents who had been snatched from her as a girl? Had she at last found the children she had never had herself?</p><p>她这个也即将进入老年的人，象一个小女孩那样找回了曾被夺走的父母吗？她终于找回了她自己从未有过的孩子吗？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She was well aware it was an illusion. Her days with the aging couple were merely a brief interval. The old man was seriously ill, and when his wife was left on her own, she would go and live with their son in Canada. Sabina's path of betrayals would then continue elsewhere, and from the depths of her being, a silly mawkish song about two shining windows and the happy family living behind them would occasionally make its way into the unbearable lightness of being.</p><p>她清楚地意识到，这只是一个幻觉。她与这老两口过的日子只是一个短暂的间歇。老头病得很重，一旦撇下老伴去了，老太太将去加拿大跟儿子一块儿过。那么，萨宾娜的背叛之途又将在别的什么地方继续。一曲关于两个闪光窗口及其窗后幸福家庭生活的歌，憨傻而脆弱，不时从她生命的深处飘出，汇入那生命中不可承受之轻。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Though touched by the song, Sabina did not take her feeling seriously. She knew only too well that the song was a beautiful lie. As soon as kitsch is recognized for the lie it is, it moves into the context of non-kitsch, thus losing its authoritarian power and becoming as touching as any other human weakness. For none among us is superman enough to escape kitsch completely. No matter how we scorn it, kitsch is an integral part of the human condition.</p><p>她被这首歌打动，但并不对这种感情过于认真。她太知道了，这首歌只是一个美丽的谎言。媚俗一旦被识破为谎言，它就进入了非媚俗的环境牵制之中，就将失去它独裁的威权，变得如同人类其它弱点一样动人。我们中间没有一个超人，强大得足以完全逃避媚俗。无论我们如何鄙视它，媚俗都是人类境况的一个组成部分。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>13</p><p>13</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Kitsch has its source in the categorical agreement with being.</p><p>媚俗起源于无条件地认同生命存在。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But what is the basis of being? God? Mankind? Struggle? Love? Man? Woman?</p><p>但生命存在的基础是什么？上帝？人类？斗争？爱情？男人？女人？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Since opinions vary, there are various kitsches: Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, Communist, Fascist, democratic, feminist, European, American, national, international.</p><p>由于意见不一，也有各种不同的媚俗：天主教的，新教的，犹太教的，共产主义的，法西斯主义的，民主主义的，女权主义的，欧洲的，美国的，民族的，国际的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Since the days of the French Revolution, one half of Europe has been referred to as the left, the other half as the right. Yet to define one or the other by means of the theoretical principles it professes is all but impossible. And no wonder: political movements rest not so much on rational attitudes as on the fantasies, images, words, and archetypes that come together to make up this or that political kitsch.</p><p>法国大革命以来，欧洲被认为一半是左派的，另一半是右派的。根据各自声称的理论原则给这一派或那一派下定义都完全不可能。这不足为奇：政治运动并不怎么依赖于理性态度，倒更依赖于奇想、印象、言词以及模式，依赖于它们总合而成的这种或那种政治媚俗。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The fantasy of the Grand March that Franz was so intoxicated by is the political kitsch joining leftists of all times and tendencies. The Grand March is the splendid march on the road to brotherhood, equality, justice, happiness; it goes on and on, obstacles notwithstanding, for obstacles there must be if the march is to be the Grand March.</p><p>弗兰茨如此陶醉于伟大的进军，这种幻想就是把各个时代内各种倾向的激进派纠合在一起的政治媚俗。伟大的进军是通向博爱、平等、正义、幸福的光辉进军，尽管障碍重重，仍然一往无前。进军既然是伟大的进军，障碍当然在所难免。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The dictatorship of the proletariat or democracy? Rejection of the consumer society or demands for increased productivity? The guillotine or an end to the death penalty? It is all beside the point. What makes a leftist a leftist is not this or that theory but his ability to integrate any theory into the kitsch called the Grand March.</p><p>是无产阶级专政还是民主主义专政？是反对消费社会还是要求扩大生产？是断头台还是废除死刑？这一切都离题甚远。把一个左派造就为左派的，不是这样或那样的理论，而是一种能力，能把任何理论都揉合到称之为伟大进军的媚俗中去。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>14</p><p>14</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Franz was obviously not a devotee of kitsch. The fantasy of the Grand March played more or less the same role in his life as the mawkish song about the two brightly lit windows in Sabina's. What political party did Franz vote for? I am afraid he did not vote at all; he preferred to spend Election Day hiking in the mountains. Which does not, of course, imply that he was no longer touched by the Grand March. It is always nice to dream that we are part of a jubilant throng marching through the centuries, and Franz never quite forgot the dream.</p><p>弗兰茨显然不是媚俗的信徒。伟大进军在他生活中扮演的角色，多少有点象萨宾娜生活中那关于两个闪亮窗口的哀婉之歌。弗兰茨投哪个政党的票？恐怕他什么票也不会投，感兴趣的是徒步旅行到山里去度过选举日，当然，这并不意昧着他不会被伟大的进军所打动。梦想着我们是跨越世世代代进军中欢乐的一群，总是美好的，弗兰茨从未完全忘记过这种梦。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>One day, some friends phoned him from Paris. They were planning a march on Cambodia and invited him to join them.</p><p>一天，有些朋友从巴黎给他打电话，他们计划向柬埔寨进军，邀请他参加。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Cambodia had recently been through American bombardment, a civil war, a paroxysm of carnage by local Communists that reduced the small nation by a fifth, and finally occupation by neighboring Vietnam, which by then was a mere vassal of Russia. Cambodia was racked by famine, and people were dying for want of medical care. An international medical committee had repeatedly requested permission to enter the country, but the Vietnamese had turned them down. The idea was for a group of important Western intellectuals to march to the Cambodian border and by means of this great spectacle performed before the eyes of the world to force the occupied country to allow the doctors in.</p><p>柬埔寨近来一直遍布美国炸弹，一场内战，使这个小小的民族失去了五分之一的人口，最后，它被相邻的越南所占领。而越南纯粹是苏联的附庸。柬埔寨受到饥荒的折磨，缺医少药的人们正在死去。一个国际医疗机构再三要求允许入境，都被越南拒之门外。现在的办法是，让一群西方重要的知识分子开到柬埔寨边境，用这种世界人民众目睽睽之下的壮观表演，迫使占领军允许医生入境。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The friend who spoke to Franz was one he had marched with through the streets of Paris. At first Franz was thrilled by the invitation, but then his eye fell on his student-mistress sitting across the room in an armchair. She was looking up at him, her eyes magnified by the big round lenses in her glasses. Franz had the feeling those eyes were begging him not to go. And so he apologetically declined.</p><p>给弗兰茨打电话的人，曾在巴黎街头与他一同进军。一开始，弗兰茨被这个邀请弄得欢喜若狂，随后，眼光落在房子那边扶手椅里的学生情妇身上。对方仰视着他，眼镜的大圆镜片把她的眼睛扩大了。弗兰茨感到这双眼睛在乞求自己别去。他歉疚地谢绝了邀请。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>No sooner had he hung up than he regretted his decision. True, he had taken care of his earthly mistress, but he had neglected his unearthly love. Wasn't Cambodia the same as Sabina's country? A country occupied by its neighbor's Communist army! A country that had felt the brunt of Russia's fist! All at once, Franz felt that his half-forgotten friend had contacted him at Sabina's secret bidding.</p><p>刚接上电话，他马上对自己的决定有些后悔。真是，他关照了现实中的情妇，却忽略了精神上的爱情。柬埔寨不是与萨宾娜的国家一样吗？一个被邻国军队占领了的国家，一个已感受到俄国巨掌重压的国家！刹那闯，他觉得那位几乎忘记了的朋友，是在根据萨宾娜的秘密吩咐与他联络的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Heavenly bodies know all and see all. If he went on the march, Sabina would gaze down on him enraptured; she would understand that he had remained faithful to her.</p><p>上天之灵知道一切，看见一切。如果他参加这次进军，萨宾娜会从上面惊喜地看着他，会明白他还保持了对她的忠诚。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Would you be terribly upset if I went on the march? he asked the girl with the glasses, who counted every day away from him a loss, yet could not deny him a thing.</p><p>“要是我参加进军，你会非常不安吗？”他问戴眼镜的始娘。这位姑娘把他每一天的离开都看成损失，但事事都依他。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Several days later he was in a large jet taking off from Paris with twenty doctors and about fifty intellectuals (professors, writers, diplomats, singers, actors, and mayors) as well as four hundred reporters and photographers.</p><p>几天后，他与二十名医生，以及大约五十位知识分子（教授、作家、外交家、歌唱家、演员以及市长），还有四百名新闻记者和摄影师，一道乘坐一架巨大的喷气式飞机，从巴黎起飞了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>15</p><p>15</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The plane landed in Bangkok. Four hundred and seventy doctors, intellectuals, and reporters made their way to the large ballroom of an international hotel, where more doctors, actors, singers, and professors of linguistics had gathered with several hundred journalists bearing notebooks, tape recorders, and cameras, still and video. On the podium, a group of twenty or so Americans sitting at a long table were presiding over the proceedings.</p><p>飞机在曼谷着陆。四百七十名医生、知识分子以及记者挤进了一家国际饭店的大舞厅。那儿聚集着更多的医生、演员、歌唱家、语言学专家，还有数百名带有笔记本、录音机、照相机以及摄像机的记者。乐台上约摸二十个美国人坐在一条长桌边上，正在主持各项事宜。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The French intellectuals with whom Franz had entered the ballroom felt slighted and humiliated. The march on Cambodia had been their idea, and here the Americans, supremely unabashed as usual, had not only taken over, but had taken over in English without a thought that a Dane or a Frenchman might not understand them. And because the Danes had long since forgotten that they once formed a nation of their own, the French were the only Europeans capable of protest. So high were their principles that they refused to protest in English, and made their case to the Americans on the podium in their mother tongue. The Americans, not understanding a word, reacted with friendly, agreeing smiles. In the end, the French had no choice but to frame their objection in English: "Why is this meeting in English when there are Frenchmen present?" </p><p>和弗兰茨一起进舞厅的那些法国知识分子，感到受了轻视和侮辱。向柬埔寨进军是他们的主意，可这里的这些美国人，象平常一样恬不知耻，不但接管了领导权，而且是用英语接管的，殊不知丹麦人和法国人听不懂他们的话。丹麦人早已忘记了他们曾形成了一个自己的民族，因此法国佬便是唯一能进行抗议的欧洲人了。他们的原则是如此之高，以至拒绝用英语抗议，而用母语法文向台上的美国人申明理由。那些美国人一个字也听不懂，报以友好和赞同的微笑。到最后，法国人别无它法，只得用英语讲出他们的反对意见：“有法国人参加，这个会为什么用英语？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Though amazed at so curious an objection, the Americans, still smiling, acquiesced: the meeting would be run bilingually. Before it could resume, however, a suitable interpreter had to be found. Then, every sentence had to resound in both English and French, which made the discussion take twice as long, or rather more than twice as long, since all the French had some English and kept interrupting the interpreter to correct him, disputing every word.</p><p>美国人对如此奇特的反对很觉惊奇，但仍然微笑，默认这个会议是该用两种语言进行的。于是，在会议重新召开之前，得找一个合适的译员。随后，每个句子都用英语和法语两种语言重复，使讨论花了两倍的时间，甚至还不止两倍，因为所有的法国人都懂一些英语，他们不时打断译员的话来给他纠错，对每一个宇都争议不休。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The meeting reached its peak when a famous American actress rose to speak. Because of her, even more photographers and cameramen streamed into the auditorium, and every syllable she pronounced was accompanied by the click of another camera. The actress spoke about suffering children, about the barbarity of Communist dictatorship, the human right to security, the current threat to the traditional values of civilized society, the inalienable freedom of the human individual, and President Carter, who was deeply sorrowed by the events in Cambodia. By the time she had pronounced her closing words, she was in tears.</p><p>一位著名的美国女演员站起来发言，使会议达到了高潮。就因为她，更多的摄影记者和摄像师涌进了大厅，用照相机的咔嚓声伴随她发出的每一个音节。女演员谈到了受难的儿童，共产党专政的残暴，人权的保障，当前对文明社会传统价值的威胁，个人不可剥夺的自由，还谈到卡特总统，说他对柬埔寨事件表示深深的忧虑。她结束发言时，已是热泪盈眶。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Then up jumped a young French doctor with a red mustache and shouted, We're here to cure dying people, not to pay homage to President Carter! Let's not turn this into an American propaganda circus! We're not here to protest against Communism! We're here to save lives! </p><p>一位长着小红胡子的法国年轻医生，跳出来吼道：“我们到这儿来是救死扶伤，不是来向卡特总统致敬！别把这儿变成美国宣传的马戏场啦！我们不是来反共！我们是来这儿救命！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He was immediately seconded by several other Frenchmen.</p><p>他马上得到另外几个法国人的响应。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The interpreter was frightened and did not dare translate what they said. So the twenty Americans on the podium looked on once more with smiles full of good will, many nodding agreement. One of them even lifted his fist in the air because he knew Europeans liked to raise their fists in times of collective euphoria.</p><p>译员害怕了，不敢把他们的话翻译出来。于是乐台上的二十个美国人满脸笑容，好意地看着他们，一再点头表示赞同。其中一位甚至把拳头举向空中，他知道欧洲人在众人同乐时，是喜欢挥举拳头的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>16</p><p>16</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>How can it be that leftist intellectuals (because the doctor with the mustache was nothing if not a leftist intellectual) are willing to march against the interests of a Communist country when Communism has always been considered the left's domain?</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When the crimes of the country called the Soviet Union became too scandalous, a leftist had two choices: either to spit on his former life and stop marching or (more or less sheepishly) to reclassify the Soviet Union as an obstacle to the Grand March and march on.</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Have I not said that what makes a leftist a leftist is the kitsch of the Grand March? The identity of kitsch comes not from a political strategy but from images, metaphors, and vocabulary. It is therefore possible to break the habit and march against the interests of a Communist country. What is impossible, however, is to substitute one word for others. It is possible to threaten the Vietnamese army with one's fist. It is impossible to shout Down with Communism! Down with Communism! is a slogan belonging to the enemies of the Grand March, and anyone worried about losing face must remain faithful to the purity of his own kitsch.</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The only reason I bring all this up is to explain the misunderstanding between the French doctor and the American actress, who, egocentric as she was, imagined herself the victim of envy or misogyny. In point of fact, the French doctor displayed a finely honed aesthetic sensibility: the phrases President Carter, our traditional values, the barbarity of Communism all belong to the vocabulary of American kitsch and have nothing to do with the kitsch of the Grand March.</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>17</p><p>17</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The next morning, they all boarded buses and rode through Thailand to the Cambodian border. In the evening, they pulled into a small village where they had rented several houses on stilts. The regularly flooding river forced the villagers to live above ground level, while their pigs huddled down below. Franz slept in a room with four other professors. From afar came the oinking of the swine, from up close the snores of a famous mathematician.</p><p>第二天早晨，他们乘公共汽车横越泰国去柬埔寨边境，晚上在一个小村子里歇息，租了几间吊脚楼的房子。周期性的洪水迫使村民们住在楼上，把他们的猪关在楼下。弗兰茨和另外四个教授佐一间房子，远远传来猪的呼唱，近处却有著名数学家的鼾声。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In the morning, they climbed back into the buses. At a point about a mile from the border, all vehicular traffic was prohibited. The border crossing could be reached only by means of a narrow, heavily guarded road. The buses stopped. The French contingent poured out of them only to find that again the Americans had beaten them and formed the vanguard of the parade. The crucial moment had come. The interpreter was recalled and a long quarrel ensued. At last everyone assented to the following: the parade would be headed by one American, one Frenchman, and the Cambodian interpreter; next would come the doctors, and only then the rest of the crowd. The American actress brought up the rear.</p><p>早上，他们又爬回汽车。在离边境约一英里的地方，所有的车辆都禁止行驶，过边境只能通过一条重兵把守的狭窄要道。车停了，法国小分队从车上涌下来，再一次发现美国人又占了他们的上风，组成了游行的先头部队。关键时刻到了。译员又给叫了来，接着是长久的争吵。最后大家同意了以下的方案：游行队伍由一个美国人，一个法国人以及一名柬埔寨译员领先，接下来是医生，再后面是余下来的人群。那位美国女演员压阵。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The road was narrow and lined with minefields. Every so often it was narrowed even more by a barrier—two cement blocks wound round with barbed wire—passable only in single file.</p><p>道路狭窄，而且沿途有布雷区，加上有路障——环绕着铁丝网的两个水泥地堡。道路更窄了——只能成单行穿过。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>About fifteen feet ahead of Franz was a famous German poet and pop singer who had already written nine hundred thirty songs for peace and against war. He was carrying a long pole topped by a white flag that set off his full black beard and set him apart from the others.</p><p>弗兰茨前面约十五英尺处，是一位著名的德国诗人兼流行歌手，已为和平写了九百三十首反战歌曲。他带来一根长杆子，挑一面白旗，衬托出自己全黑的胡子，把自己与其他人区别开来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>All up and down the long parade, photographers and cameramen were snapping and whirring their equipment, dashing up to the front, pausing, inching back, dropping to their knees, then straightening up and running even farther ahead. Now and then they would call out the name of some celebrity, who would then unwittingly turn in their direction just long enough to let them trigger their shutters.</p><p>长长的游行队伍此起彼伏，摄影记者和摄像师抢拍镜头，哗哗地摆弄着他们的设备，飞快地冲到队伍前面，停一停，又缓缓向后退着，不时单腿跪下，然后又挺起身子跑到前面更远的地方。他们不时唤着某位著名人士的名字，那人便不知不觉地转向他们的方向，使他们有足够的时间按下快门。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>18</p><p>18</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Something was in the air. People were slowing down and looking back.</p><p>什么声音传来了。人们放慢步子朝后看。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The American actress, who had ended up in the rear, could no longer stand the disgrace of it and, determined to take the offensive, was sprinting to the head of the parade. It was as if a runner in a five-kilometer race, who had been saving his strength by hanging back with the pack, had suddenly sprung forward and started overtaking his opponents one by one.</p><p>落在最后的美国女演员，再也忍受不了这种黯然失色的压阵者地位，决定发起进攻。她全速向队伍前面跑去，就象一位参加五千米长跑比赛的运动员，开始为了节省体力一直落在其他人后面，现在突然奋力向前，开始把对手一个接一个地甩下。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The men stepped back with embarrassed smiles, not wishing to spoil the famous runner's bid for victory, but the women yelled, "Get back in line! This is no star parade!"</p><p>男人们为难地笑笑，让了步，不想挫伤这位著名长跑运动员取胜的决心，但女人们发出叫喊：“回到队伍里去！这不是明星的队伍！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Undaunted, the actress pushed on, a suite of five photographers and two cameramen in tow.</p><p>大无畏的女演员仍然一往无前，五名摄影记者和两名摄像师尾随其后。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Suddenly a Frenchwoman, a professor of linguistics, grabbed the actress by the wrist and said (in terrible-sounding English), "This is a parade for doctors who have come to care for mortally ill Cambodians, not a publicity stunt for movie stars!" The actress's wrist was locked in the linguistics professor's grip; she could do nothing to pry it loose. "What the hell do you think you're doing?" she said (in perfect English). "I've been in a hundred parades like this! You won't get anywhere without stars! It's our job! Our moral obligation!"</p><p>突然，一位法国语言学女教授抓住了她的手腕，（以极难听的英语）说：“这是一支医生的队伍，来给那些垂危的柬埔寨人治病，不是为电影明星捧场的惊险表演！”女演员的手被语言学教授的手紧紧锁住，无法挣脱。“你到底想要干什么？”她（用纯正的英语）说，“我参加过一百次这样的游行了，没有明星，你们哪里也去不了！这是我们的工作，我们道义的职责！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Merde," said the linguistics professor (in perfect French).</p><p>“放屁！”语言学教授（用地道的法语）说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The American actress understood and burst into tears.</p><p>美国女演员听明白了，放声大哭起来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Hold it, please," a cameraman called out and knelt at her feet. The actress gave a long look into his lens, the tears flowing down her cheeks.</p><p>“请别动！”一位摄像师大叫，在她脚边跪倒。女演员对着他的镜头留下一个长长的回望，泪珠从脸上滚下来，</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>19</p><p>19</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When at last the linguistics professor let go of the American actress's wrist, the German pop singer with the black beard and white flag called out her name.</p><p>语言学教授终于放开了美国女演员的手腕。那位有黑胡子和白旗子的德国流行歌手，叫了声女演员的名字。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The American actress had never heard of him, but after being humiliated she was more receptive to sympathy than usual and ran over to him. The singer switched the pole to his left hand and put his right arm around her shoulders.</p><p>美国女演员从未听说过他，但她刚经过羞辱，比往常更容易接受同情，朝他跑了过去。歌唱家换上左手擎旗杆，右手搭在她肩上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They were immediately surrounded by new photographers and cameramen. A well-known American photographer, having trouble squeezing both their faces and the flag into his viewfinder because the pole was so long, moved back a few steps into the ricefield. And so it happened that he stepped on a mine. An explosion rang out, and his body, ripped to pieces, went flying through the air, raining a shower of blood on the European intellectuals.</p><p>他们立即被新的摄影记者和摄像师所包围。一位著名的美国摄影记者为了把他们的脸和旗子一起塞进镜头，颇费了些周折。旗杆太长，他往身后的稻田移了几步，竞踏响了一个地雷。轰然一声爆炸，他的身体撕成了碎片，在空中飞舞，一片血雨洗浴着欧洲的知识分子们。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The singer and the actress were horrified and could not budge. They lifted their eyes to the flag. It was spattered with blood. Once more they were horrified. Then they timidly ventured a few more looks upward and began to smile slightly. They were filled with a strange pride, a pride they had never known before: the flag they were carrying had been consecrated by blood. Once more they joined the march.</p><p>歌手和演员都吓坏了，动也不敢动，举目望了望那旗子。旗上溅满的鲜血使他们每一个惊恐万分。他们又提心吊胆地向上看了几眼，才开始隐隐地微笑。他们心中充满了一种奇怪的自豪，一种他们从未领略过的自豪：已经有人为他们的旗子奉献了鲜血。他们再一次加入了进军的行列。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>20</p><p>20</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The border was formed by a small river, but because a long wall, six feet high and lined with sandbags to protect Thai sharpshooters, ran alongside it, it was invisible. There was only one breach in the wall, at the point where a bridge spanned the river. Vietnamese forces lay in wait on the other side, but they, too, were invisible, their positions perfectly camouflaged. It was clear, however, that the moment anyone set foot on the bridge, the invisible Vietnamese would open fire.</p><p>国界线就是一条小河。沿河有长长一道约六英尺高的墙，使河看不见了。墙边堆满了保护泰国狙击手的沙包。墙垣只有一个缺口，一座桥从那里横跨小河。越南军队就驻守在桥的那一边，但他们的位置也完全伪装起来了，也看不见。很清楚，只要有人踏上这座桥，看不见的越南人就会开火。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The parade participants went up to the wall and stood on tiptoe. Franz peered into the gap between two sandbags, trying to see what was going on. He saw nothing. Then he was shoved away by a photographer, who felt that he had more right to the space.</p><p>游行者们走近大墙，踮起脚张望。弗兰茨从两个沙包的夹缝中向外看，想看个究竟，但什么也看不到。他被一个摄影记者推开了，那人觉得自己更有权利得到这个位置。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Franz looked back. Seven photographers were perching in the mighty crown of an isolated tree like a flock of overgrown crows, their eyes fixed on the opposite bank.</p><p>弗兰茨看看后面，七位摄影师栖息在一棵孤零零的大树顶架上，眼盯着对岸，象一群巨形的乌鸦。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Just then the interpreter, at the head of the parade, raised a large megaphone to her lips and called out in Khmer to the other side: These people are doctors; they request permission to enter the territory of Cambodia and offer medical assistance; they have no political designs whatsoever and are guided solely by a concern for human life.</p><p>这时，走在队伍前面的译员把一个大喇叭筒举到了嘴边，用高棉语向对岸喊起话来：这些人都是医生，他们要求获得允许进入柬埔寨国境，提供医务援助；他们没有任何政治意图，纯粹是出于对人类生命的关心。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The response from the other side was a stunning silence. A silence so absolute that everyone's spirits sank. Only the cameras clicked on, sounding in the silence like the song of an exotic insect.</p><p>来自对岸的回答是一片震人心弦的沉默。如此绝对的沉寂使每个人的心都往下沉，只有照相机在继续咔咔响，听起来象一只异国的虫子在唱歌。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Franz had the sudden feeling that the Grand March was coming to an end. Europe was surrounded by borders of silence, and the space where the Grand March was occurring was now no more than a small platform in the middle of the planet. The crowds that had once pressed eagerly up to the platform had long since departed, and the Grand March went on in solitude, without spectators. Yes, said Franz to himself, the Grand March goes on, the world's indifference notwithstanding, but it is growing nervous and hectic: yesterday against the American occupation of Vietnam, today against the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia; yesterday for Israel, today for the Palestinians; yesterday for Cuba, tomorrow against Cuba— and always against America; at times against massacres and at times in support of other massacres; Europe marches on, and to keep up with events, to leave none of them out, its pace grows faster and faster, until finally the Grand March is a procession of rushing, galloping people and the platform is shrinking and shrinking until one day it will be reduced to a mere dimension-less dot.</p><p>弗兰茨有种突如其来的感觉：伟大的进军就要完了。欧洲被寂静的边界包围着，发生伟大进军的空间，现在不过是这颗星球中部的一个小小舞台。曾经急切挤向这个舞台的观众早就离去了，伟大的进军在孤寂中进行，没有了观众。是的，弗兰茨自言自语，尽管世界是冷漠的，但伟大的进军还在继续，变得越来越紧张，越来越轰轰烈烈：昨天反对美国占领越南，今天反对越南攻占柬埔寨；昨天拥护以色列，今天拥护巴勒斯坦；昨天拥护古巴，明天反对古巴——而且总是反对美国；时而反对大屠杀，时而又支持另一场大屠杀；欧洲在前进，且赶上了众多的热闹，一个也没拉下。它的步子越来越快，到最后，伟大的进军成了催促人们迅跑的疾驶飞奔，舞台正在越来越缩小，某一天终将变成一个没有空间度向的圆点。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>21</p><p>21</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Once more the interpreter shouted her challenge into the megaphone. And again the response was a boundless and endlessly indifferent silence.</p><p>译员又一次用喇叭简喊话，回答仍然是无边无际无止无尽的冷寂。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Franz looked in all directions. The silence on the other side of the river had hit them all like a slap in the face. Even the singer with the white flag and the American actress were depressed, hesitant about what to do next.</p><p>弗兰茨环顾四周，河对岸的沉默象一巴掌打在大家的脸上，连打白旗的歌手以及美国女演员都消沉了，不知下一步如何是好。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In a flash of insight Franz saw how laughable they all were, but instead of cutting him off from them or flooding him with irony, the thought made him feel the kind of infinite love we feel for the condemned. Yes, the Grand March was coming to an end, but was that any reason for Franz to betray it? Wasn't his own life coming to an end as well? Who was he to jeer at the exhibitionism of the people accompanying the courageous doctors to the border? What could they all do but put on a show? Had they any choice?</p><p>凭借内心的闪光，弗兰茨看到了他们都是如此可笑。但是他不想离开他们，也没有嘲讽的兴致，内心中升起一种感情，象我们对被判罪者的无限怜爱。是的，伟大的进军即将完结，可那是弗兰茨背叛它的理由吗？他自己的生命不也是到了尽头吗？在这些陪伴着勇敢的医生走向边境的一群当中，他要嘲笑谁的表现癖呢？他们这些人除了表演还能做什么呢？他们还有别的选择吗？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Franz was right. I can't help thinking about the editor in Prague who organized the petition for the amnesty of political prisoners. He knew perfectly well that his petition would not help the prisoners. His true goal was not to free the prisoners; it was to show that people without fear still exist. That, too, was playacting. But he had no other possibility. His choice was not between playacting and action. His choice was between playacting and no action at all. There are situations in which people are condemned to playact. Their struggle with mute power (the mute power across the river, a police transmogrified into mute microphones in the wall) is the struggle of a theater company that has attacked an army.</p><p>弗兰茨是对的。我不禁想起了那位为赦免政治犯组织请愿的布拉格编辑来。他完全知道他的请愿对那些囚犯毫无帮助，他真正的目标不是解放囚犯，而是为了表现那些无所畏惧者的存在。那样做，也是演戏。但是他没有任何其它的可能，他不是在演戏与行动之间进行选择，是在演戏与完全无行动之间进行选择。在有些情势之中，人们给判决了只能演戏。他们与哑默力量的斗争（河那边的哑默力量，墙里化为哑默窃听器的警察），是一个剧团对军队的进攻。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Franz watched his friend from the Sorbonne lift his fist and threaten the silence on the other side.</p><p>弗兰茨看着他那位从巴黎大学来的朋友举起了拳头，威胁着对岸的静寂。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>22</p><p>22</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>For the third time the interpreter shouted her challenge into the megaphone.</p><p>译员用喇叭筒进行第三次喊话。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The silence she again received in response suddenly turned Franz's depression into rage. Here he was, standing only a few steps from the bridge joining Thailand to Cambodia, and he felt an overwhelming desire to run out onto it, scream bloodcurdling curses to the skies, and die in a great clatter of gunfire.</p><p>她再一次得到的沉默回答，使弗兰茨的沮丧突然变成了愤怒。他就在这里，站在泰柬边境界桥仅仅几步远的地方，心中腾起一种要冲上桥去的不可阻挡的欲念。他想仰天痛骂，然后在震天动地的机枪扫射声中死去。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>That sudden desire of Franz's reminds us of something; yes, it reminds us of Stalin's son, who ran to electrocute himself on the barbed wire when he could no longer stand to watch the poles of human existence come so close to each other as to touch, when there was no longer any difference between sublime and squalid, angel and fly. God and shit.</p><p>弗兰茨这种突然的欲念使我们想起了一些东西，是的，使我们想起了斯大林的儿子。当他不忍再看到人类生存的两极互相靠近得瞬间可及的程度，当他发现崇高与卑贱、天使与苍蝇、上帝与大粪之间再无任何区别，便一头闯到铁丝电网上触电身亡了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Franz could not accept the fact that the glory of the Grand March was equal to the comic vanity of its marchers, that the exquisite noise of European history was lost in an infinite silence and that there was no longer any difference between history and silence. He felt like placing his own life on the scales; he wanted to prove that the Grand March weighed more than shit.</p><p>弗兰茨无法接受的事实是，伟大进军的光荣居然会与进军者的喜剧性虚荣打等号。他不能承认欧洲历史高贵的喧嚣会消失在无际的沉寂里，不承认历史与沉寂之间不再有任何区别。他想把自己的生命放到那座天平上，想证明伟大的进军比大粪要重一些。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But man can prove nothing of the sort. One pan of the scales held shit; on the other, Stalin's son put his entire body. And the scales did not move.</p><p>但是，人们在这里证明不出任何东西。天平的一个盘子里放着大粪，另一个盘子里是斯大林之子投入的整个身躯，天平还是一动不动。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Instead of getting himself shot, Franz merely hung his head and went back with the others, single file, to the buses.</p><p>弗兰茨没有让自己挨枪子，只是垂着头，与其他人一道，成单行，走向汽车。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>23</p><p>23</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>We all need someone to look at us. We can be divided into four categories according to the kind of look we wish to live under.</p><p>我们都需要有人看着我们。根据我们生活所希望承接的不同目光，可以把我们分成四种类型。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The first category longs for the look of an infinite number of anonymous eyes, in other words, for the look of the public. That is the case with the German singer, the American actress, and even the tall, stooped editor with the big chin. He was accustomed to his readers, and when one day the Russians banned his newspaper, he had the feeling that the atmosphere was suddenly a hundred times thinner. Nothing could replace the look of unknown eyes. He thought he would suffocate. Then one day he realized that he was constantly being followed, bugged, and surreptitiously photographed in the street. Suddenly he had anonymous eyes on him and he could breathe again! He began making theatrical speeches to the microphones in his wall. In the police, he had found his lost public.</p><p>第一类人期望着无数双隐名的眼光，换句话说，是期待着公众的目光。德国歌手、美国女演员，甚至那位高个驼背以及大下巴的编缉，就是这种类型。他习惯了他的读者，某一天入侵者禁了他的报纸，没有什么能取代那些隐名的眼光，他便感到空气顿时稀薄了一百倍，感到自己将被窒息。然而某一天，他意识到有人不断跟踪他，窃听他，鬼鬼祟祟地在街上给他拍照，于是，隐名的目光又突然回到了他身上，他又能呼吸了。他开始对着墙里的麦克风作戏剧性的演说，在警察那里找到了失却多时的公众。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The second category is made up of people who have a vital need to be looked at by many known eyes. They are the tireless hosts of cocktail parties and dinners. They are happier than the people in the first category, who, when they lose their public, have the feeling that the lights have gone out in the room of their lives. This happens to nearly all of them sooner or later. People in the second category, on the other hand, can always come up with the eyes they need. Marie-Claude and her daughter belong in the second category.</p><p>那些极其需要被许多熟悉眼睛看着的人，组成了第二类。他们是鸡尾酒会与聚餐中永不疲倦的主人。他们比第一类人快活。第一类人失去公众时就觉得熄灭了生命之光，而这种情况对几乎他们所有人来说是迟早要发生的。然而在第二类人这一方面，他们能够总是与自己需要的目光在一起，克劳迪及其女儿就属于这一类。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Then there is the third category, the category of people who need to be constantly before the eyes of the person they love. Their situation is as dangerous as the situation of people in the first category. One day the eyes of their beloved will close, and the room will go dark. Tereza and Tomas belong in the third category.</p><p>再就是第三类人，他们需要经常面对他们所爱的人的眼睛。他们和第一类人同样都置身于危险处境，某一天，他们爱着的人儿闭上双眼，他们的空间将进入黑暗。特丽莎和托马斯就属于第三类。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And finally there is the fourth category, the rarest, the category of people who live in the imaginary eyes of those who are not present. They are the dreamers. Franz, for example. He traveled to the borders of Cambodia only for Sabina. As the bus bumped along the Thai road, he could feel her eyes fixed on him in a long stare.</p><p>最后是第四类，这一类人最少。他们是梦想家，生活在想象中某一双远方的眼睛之下。比方说弗兰茨吧，他去柬埔寨边境只是为了萨宾娜，当汽车沿着泰国公路颠簸行进时，他能感到她的眼睛久久地盯着自己。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Tomas's son belongs in the same category. Let me call him Simon. (He will be glad to have a Biblical name, like his father's.) The eyes he longed for were Tomas's. As a result of his embroilment in the petition campaign, he was expelled from the university. The girl he had been going out with was the niece of a village priest. He married her, became a tractor driver on a collective farm, a practicing Catholic, and a father. When he learned that Tomas, too, was living in the country, he was thrilled: fate had made their lives symmetrical! This encouraged him to write Tomas a letter. He did not ask him to write back. He only wanted him to focus his eyes on his life.</p><p>托马斯的儿子也属于这同一类型。让我们称他为西蒙吧（他将会很高兴有一个圣经里的名字，象他父亲一样）。他期望的是托马斯的眼光。但卷入请愿运动的结果，是被大学赶了出来。总是陪他出门的姑娘，是一位乡村牧师的侄女，他娶了她，成了一名集体农庄的拖拉机手、天主教教徒，和一名父亲。他知道托马斯也住在农村时，激动不己：命运使他们的生活对等了！他由此而生出勇气给托马斯写了一封信，不是要求对方回信，只是希望托马斯把目光投向他的生命。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>24</p><p>24</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Franz and Simon are the dreamers of this novel. Unlike Franz, Simon never liked his mother. From childhood he searched for his father. He was willing to believe his father the victim of some sort of injustice that predated and explained the injustice his father had perpetrated on him. He never felt angry with his father, because he did not wish to ally himself with his mother, who continually maligned the man.</p><p>弗兰茨与西蒙是这部小说的梦想家。与弗兰茨不同，西蒙从不喜欢他的母亲，从孩提时代起，他就在寻找父亲。他愿意相信父亲是某种非义的牺牲品，并以此解释父亲后来施加与他的不义。他从不生父亲的气，从不愿意与那位不断中伤父亲的母亲有什么联合行动。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He lived with her until he was eighteen and had finished secondary school; then he went off to Prague and the university. By that time Tomas was washing windows. Often Simon would wait long hours to arrange an accidental encounter with Tomas. But Tomas never stopped to talk to him.</p><p>他在母亲身边一直住到十八岁，完成了中专学业，随后去布拉格续大学。那时的托马斯是个擦洗工。西蒙常常一等几个小时，想撞见托马斯，但托马斯从未停下步来跟他说说话。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The only reason he became involved with the big-chinned former editor was that the editor's fate reminded him of his father's. The editor had never heard of Tomas. The Oedipus article had been forgotten. It was Simon who told him about it and asked him to persuade Tomas to sign the petition. The only reason the editor agreed was that he wanted to do something nice for the boy, whom he liked.</p><p>他与那位大下巴编辑混在一起，唯一原因就是编辑的命运使他想起了父亲。那编辑从未听说过托马斯，关于俄狄浦斯的文章早已给忘了。是西蒙向他谈到这篇文章，求他去劝说托马斯在请愿书上签名。编辑同意了，因为他希望为这个他喜欢的孩子做点好事。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Whenever Simon thought back to the day when they had met, he was ashamed of his stage fright. His father couldn't have liked him. He, on the other hand, liked his father. He remembered his every word, and as time went on he saw how true they were. The words that made the biggest impression on him were "Punishing people who don't know what they've done is barbaric." When his girlfriend's uncle put a Bible in his hands, he was particularly struck by Jesus' words "Forgive them, for they know not what they do." He knew that his father was a nonbeliever, but in the similarity of the two phrases he saw a secret sign: his father agreed with the path he had taken.</p><p>无论什么时候，西蒙回想起他与父亲见面的那一天，就为自己当时的怯场而羞愧。父亲不可能喜欢他，在他这一方面，他喜欢父亲。他记得他们的每一句话，而且随着时间的推移，他看出这些话是何等正确。他印象最为深刻的一句是：“惩罚自己不知道做了些什么的人是残暴的。”当女朋友的叔叔把一本圣经交到他手，耶稣的一句话特别震动了他：“原谅他们，因为他们不知道他们做了什么。”他知道父亲是无宗教信仰者，但从这两段相似的话中，他看到了一种暗示：父亲同意他选定的道路。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>During approximately his third year in the country, he received a letter from Tomas asking him to come and visit. Their meeting was a friendly one. Simon felt relaxed and did not stammer a bit. He probably did not realize that they did not understand each other very well. About four months later, he received a telegram saying that Tomas and his wife had been crushed to death under a truck.</p><p>大约在他下农村的第三年，他收到了一封托马斯的信，邀请他去看看。他们的聚会是友好的，西蒙感到轻松，一点也不结巴。他也许没有意识到他们互相并不十分了解。约四个月之后，他收到一份电报，说托马斯与妻子丧生在一辆货车之下。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>At about that time, he learned about a woman who had once been his father's mistress and was living in France. He found out her address. Because he desperately needed an imaginary eye to follow his life, he would occasionally write her long letters.</p><p>大约就在那个时候，他听说父亲以前的一位情妇住在法国，并找到了她的地址。他极其需要想象中的眼睛追随着自己的生命，于是间或给她写一些长长的信。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>25</p><p>25</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sabina continued to receive letters from her sad village correspondent till the end of her life. Many of them would remain unread, because she took less and less interest in her native land.</p><p>萨宾娜不断接到那位悲哀的乡下通信者的来信，直到她生命的终结。很多信一直没有读过，她对故土的兴趣已越来越少。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The old man died, and Sabina moved to California. Farther west, farther away from the country where she had been born.</p><p>那老头死了，萨宾娜迁往西方更远的地方，迁往加利弗尼亚，更远离了自己出生的故国。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She had no trouble selling her paintings, and liked America. But only on the surface. Everything beneath the surface was alien to her. Down below, there was no grandpa or uncle. She was afraid of shutting herself into a grave and sinking into American earth.</p><p>她卖画没有什么难处。她爱美国，但只从表面上爱，表层下面的一切对她都是异己的。脚下的泥土里没有爷爷和叔叔，她害怕自己被关进坟墓，沉入美国的土地。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And so one day she composed a will in which she requested that her dead body be cremated and its ashes thrown to the winds. Tereza and Tomas had died under the sign of weight. She wanted to die under the sign of lightness. She would be lighter than air. As Parmenides would put it, the negative would change into the positive.</p><p>于是，有一天地写了一份遗嘱，请求把她的尸体火化，骨灰撤入空中。特丽莎与托马斯的死显示着重，她想用自己的死来表明轻，她将比大气还轻。正如巴门尼德曾经指出的，消极会变成积极。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>26</p><p>26</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The bus stopped in front of the Bangkok hotel. No one any longer felt like holding meetings. People drifted off in groups to sightsee; some set off for temples, others for brothels. Franz's friend from the Sorbonne suggested they spend the evening together, but he preferred to be alone.</p><p>汽车在曼谷旅馆前停下来。人们再也不想主持会议了。他们成群给伙任意去观光，有些出发去寺庙，另一些去妓院。弗兰茨在巴黎大学的朋友建议他们一起过夜，但他更愿意一人独处。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was nearly dark when he went out into the streets. He kept thinking about Sabina, feeling her eyes on him. Whenever he felt her long stare, he began to doubt himself: he had never known quite what Sabina thought. It made him uncomfortable now as well. Could she be mocking him? Did she consider the cult he made of her silly? Could she be trying to tell him it was time for him to grow up and devote himself fully to the mistress she herself had sent to him?</p><p>他走到街上时，天差不多都黑了。他老想着萨宾娜，感到她在看着自己。每当他感到她久久的凝视，便开始怀疑自己：他从来就不知道萨宾娜想些什么。现在，这种怀疑也使他不舒服。她会嘲弄他么？她把他对她的崇拜视为愚蠢吗？她是想告诉他，现在他该长大了，该把全部身心交给萨宾娜赐给他的情妇吗？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Picturing the face with big round glasses, he suddenly realized how happy he was with his student-mistress. All at once, the Cambodia venture struck him as meaningless, laughable. Why had he come? Only now did he know. He had come to find out once and for all that neither parades nor Sabina but rather the girl with the glasses was his real life, his only real life! He had come to find out that reality was more than a dream, much more than a dream!</p><p>想象那张戴着大圆眼镜的脸庞，他突然意识到自己与学生情妇在一起是何等幸福。这一刻，柬埔寨之行对他来说似乎变得既无意义又可笑。他为什么要来呢？直到现在他才知道，他终于一次亦即永远地发现了，他真实的生活，唯一真实的生活，既不是游行也不是萨宾娜，还是这位戴眼镜的姑娘。他终于发现，现实要多于梦境，大大地多于梦境。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Suddenly a figure emerged out of the semi-darkness and said something to him in a language he did not know. He gave the intruder a look that was startled but sympathetic. The man bowed and smiled and muttered something with great urgency. What was he trying to say? He seemed to be inviting him somewhere. The man took him by the hand and started leading him away. Franz decided that someone needed his help. Maybe there was some sense in his coming all that distance. Wasn't he being called to help somebody?</p><p>突然，一个身影从昏昏夜色中闪出来，用他听不懂的语言讲了些什么。他朝拦路者看了一眼，大吃一惊却充满同情。那人欠身鞠躬，嘿嘿微笑，用急促的语气咕咕哝哝。他想要说什么？他象是邀请弗兰茨去一个什么地方，拉着他的手，把他引走了，弗兰茨肯定那人需要自己的帮助，也许在他这次来的整个旅途中，他就有某种意识，难道他不是被叫来帮助什么人的吗？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Suddenly there were two other men next to the first, and one of them asked him in English for his money.</p><p>突然，那人旁边又出现了两位，其中一个用英语向他要钱。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>At that point, the girl with the glasses vanished from his thoughts and Sabina fixed her eyes on him, unreal Sabina with her grand fate, Sabina who had made him feel so small. Her wrathful eyes bored into him, angry and dissatisfied: Had he been had once again? Had someone else abused his idiotic goodness?</p><p>此刻，戴眼镜的姑娘从他脑海中消逝了。萨宾娜盯着他，那个肩负伟大命运的非现实的萨宾娜，那个使弗兰茨感到如此渺小的萨宾娜。她气愤而不满，震怒的目光射进了他的身体：他曾经看过这种目光吗？其他人曾经辱骂过他这种愚蠢的好心肠吗？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He tore his arm away from the man, who was now holding on to his sleeve. He remembered that Sabina had always admired his strength. He seized the arm one of the other men was lifting against him, and, tightening his grip, tossed him over his shoulder in a perfect judo flip.</p><p>他把手臂从那人手中挣开，又被那人揪佐了袖子。他记得萨宾娜总是羡慕他的体力。他接过了另一个人挥来的一拳，紧紧掐住，以一个极漂亮的现代柔道翻身动作把对方从他肩上扔过去了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Now he was satisfied with himself. Sabina's eyes were still on him. She would never see him humiliate himself again! She would never see him retreat! Franz was through with being soft and sentimental!</p><p>现在，他对自己很满意。萨宾娜的眼睛仍然看着他，她再也不会看到他羞辱自己了！她再也看不到他的退却了！弗兰茨已经抛弃了柔弱和伤感！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He felt what was almost a cheerful hatred for these men. They had thought to have a good laugh at him and his naivete! He stood there with his shoulders slightly hunched and his eyes darting back and forth between the two remaining men. Suddenly, he felt a heavy blow on his head, and he crumpled immediately. He vaguely sensed being carried somewhere. Then he was thrown into emptiness and felt himself falling. A violent crack, and he lost consciousness.</p><p>他感到自己对这些人有一种兴高采烈的仇很。他们还想好好嘲笑他以及他的纯真么！他站在那里微微隆起肩膀，眼睛飞快地前后扫视，对付着两个还没倒下的歹徒。突然，他感到自己的头挨了重重的一击，立刻栽倒下去。模模糊糊地感到被人扛到某个地方，随后他就被抛入空中，感到自己在沉落。又是狠狠的一击，他失去了知觉。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He woke up in a hospital in Geneva. Marie-Claude was leaning over his bed. He wanted to tell her she had no right to be there. He wanted them to send immediately for the girl with the glasses. All his thoughts were with her. He wanted to shout that he couldn't stand having anyone but her at his side. But he realized with horror that he could not speak. He looked up at Marie-Claude with infinite hatred and tried to turn away from her. But he could not move his body. His head, perhaps? No, he could not even move his head. He closed his eyes so as not to see her.</p><p>他在日内瓦的医院里醒过来，克劳迪靠在他的床头。他想告诉她，她没有权利来这里。他要他们把那戴眼镜的姑娘送来，他脑子里只想着她。他想大声喊出，除她之外他不能忍受任何人呆在他身边。但他可怕地发现自己已不能说话。他带着无限的仇恨仰望着克劳迪，想避开她转过身去。但他无法移动身子。头呢？也许行？不，他连头也动弹不得。他合上双眼不看她。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>27</p><p>27</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In death, Franz at last belonged to his wife. He belonged to her as he had never belonged to her before. Marie-Claude took care of everything: she saw to the funeral, sent out the announcements, bought the wreaths, and had a black dress made—a wedding dress, in reality. Yes, a husband's funeral is a wife's true wedding! The climax of her life's work! The reward for her sufferings!</p><p>死了的弗兰茨终于属于他妻子了。他属于她就象以前从没属于过她一样。克劳迪料理了一切：她负责葬礼，送发通知，买花圈，还做了身黑丧服——事实上是结婚礼服。是呵，丈夫的葬礼是妻子真正的婚礼！这是她一生的作品的高潮！是她所有痛苦的报偿！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The pastor understood this very well. His funeral oration was about a true conjugal love that had withstood many tests to remain a haven of peace for the deceased, a haven to which he had returned at the end of his days. The colleague of Franz's whom Marie-Claude asked to speak at the graveside services also paid homage primarily to the deceased's brave wife.</p><p>牧师非常理解这一切，他在葬礼祷词中谈到，这是一种真正的婚姻之爱，这种爱经历了多次考验，将为死者留下一块平静的天国，死者在瞑目之时就返归这个天国去了。那位弗兰茨的同事，应克劳迪之邀来此作墓前祈祷演说，也首先向死者这位勇敢的妻子致敬。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Somewhere in the back, supported by a friend, stood the girl with the big glasses. The combination of many pills and suppressed sobs gave her an attack of cramps before the ceremony came to an end. She lurched forward, clutching her stomach, and her friend had to take her away from the cemetery.</p><p>戴眼镜的姑娘由另一位朋友搀扶，站在后面的一个地方。由于吞服了大量的药片，加上强忍哭泣，使她在葬礼结束之前就痉挛起来。她按住腹部，摇摇晃晃向前倾倒，朋友只好扶着她离开了墓地。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>28</p><p>28</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The moment he received the telegram from the chairman of the collective farm, he jumped on his motorcycle. He arrived in time to arrange for the funeral. The inscription he chose to go under his father's name on the gravestone read: </p><p>他一接到集体农庄主席打来的电报，就跨上摩托车，及时赶到那里并安排了葬礼。他选定了一句献辞，将要刻到墓碑上的父亲名字之下：</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>HE WANTED THE KINGDOM OF GOD ON EARTH.</p><p>他要在人间建起上帝的天国。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He was well aware that his father would not have said it in those words, but he was certain they expressed what his father actually thought. The kingdom of God means justice. Tomas had longed for a world in which justice would reign. Hadn't Simon the right to express his father's life in his own vocabulary? Of course he had: haven't all heirs had that right from time immemorial?</p><p>他完全知道，父亲说话不会用这些词语，但他断定这句话表达了父亲的真实思想。上帝的天国即正义。托马斯期望一个由正义统治的世界。难道西蒙没有权利用自己的语言来描绘父亲的生命吗？他当然有：自浑沌远古以来，子孙后代不是都有这种权利吗？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>A return after long wanderings was the inscription adorning the stone above Franz's grave. It can be interpreted in religious terms: the wanderings being our earthly existence, the return our return to God's embrace. But the insiders knew that it had a perfectly secular meaning as well. Indeed, Marie-Claude talked about it every day:</p><p>漫漫迷途终有回归，这是刻在弗兰茨墓前石碑上的献辞。它能用宗教语言来解释：我们凡间生命存在的漫游，就是向上帝怀抱的回归。可知内情的人知道，这句话还有完全世俗的意义。的确，克劳迪天天都谈起这事：</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Franz, dear, sweet Franz! The mid-life crisis was just too much for him. And that pitiful little girl who caught him in her net! Why, she wasn't even pretty! (Did you see those enormous glasses she tried to hide behind?) But when they start pushing fifty (don't we know it!), they'll sell their souls for a fresh piece of flesh. Only his wife knows how it made him suffer! It was pure moral torture! Because, deep down, Franz was a kind and decent man. How else can you explain that crazy, desperate trip to wherever it was in Asia? He went there to find death. Yes, Marie-Claude knew it for an absolute fact:</p><p>弗兰茨，可亲可爱的弗兰茨，中年危机对他来说太受不了啦。是那个可悲的小丫头把他投入了情网。是呀，她甚至不怎么好看（你们看见没有？她努力想把自己藏在大眼镜后面！），但是，一旦他们生米煮个半熟（我们说不准！），他们就会一片鲜肉也换灵魂的。只是当他妻子的，才知道他被这事坑苦了！纯粹是道德折磨！他情绪很低沉，他是好心正派的人嘛。不然你能解释他那癫劲？不要命地跑到亚洲的什么地方去？他到那里去是找死哩。是的，克劳迪知道这一点是绝对事实：</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Franz had consciously sought out death. In his last days, when he was dying and had no need to lie, she was the only person he asked for. He couldn't talk, but how he'd thanked her with his eyes! He'd fixed his eyes on her and begged to be forgiven. And she forgave him.</p><p>弗兰茨是有意识去寻死的。在他最后的日子里，他要死了，没有必要说谎。她是他所唯一需要的人。他不能说话，但他是怎样用眼睛表达对她的感激之情啊！他盯住她，请求她原谅。而她原谅了他。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>29</p><p>29</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>What remains of the dying population of Cambodia?</p><p>正在死去的柬埔寨百姓万民留下了什么？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>One large photograph of an American actress holding an Asian child in her arms.</p><p>一个美国女演员抱着一个亚洲儿童的巨幅照片。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>What remains of Tomas?</p><p>托马斯留下了什么？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>An inscription reading he wanted the kingdom of god on earth.</p><p>一条碑文：他要在人间建起上帝的天国。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>What remains of Beethoven?</p><p>贝多芬留下了什么？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>A frown, an improbable mane, and a somber voice intoning Es muss sein! </p><p>一道紧锁的眉头，一头未必其实的长发，一个阴郁的声音在吟咏“非如此不可！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>What remains of Franz?</p><p>弗兰茨留下了什么？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>An inscription reading a return after long wanderings.</p><p>一句献辞：浸漫迷途终有回归。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And so on and so forth. Before we are forgotten, we will be turned into kitsch. Kitsch is the stopover between being and oblivion.</p><p>如此等等。我们在没有被忘记之前，就会被变成一种媚俗。媚俗是存在与忘却之间的中途停歇站。</p></div>
