<div class='layout'><p>Part 3, Chapter 3</p><p>21  二加二等于五

</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'There are three stages in your reintegration,' said O'Brien. 'There is learning, there is understanding, and there is acceptance. It is time for you to enter upon the second stage.'</p><p>“你的改造分三个阶段，”奥勃良说，“学习、理解、接受。现在你该进入第二阶段了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>As always, Winston was lying flat on his back. But of late his bonds were looser. They still held him to the bed, but he could move his knees a little and could turn his head from side to side and raise his arms from the elbow. The dial, also, had grown to be less of a terror. He could evade its pangs if he was quick-witted enough: it was chiefly when he showed stupidity that O'Brien pulled the lever. Sometimes they got through a whole session without use of the dial. He could not remember how many sessions there had been. The whole process seemed to stretch out over a long, indefinite time -- weeks, possibly -- and the intervals between the sessions might sometimes have been days, sometimes only an hour or two.</p><p>温斯顿又是仰卧在床上。不过最近绑带比较松了。他仍给绑在床上，不过膝盖可以稍作移动，脑袋可以左右转动，从手肘以下，可以举起手来。那个仪表也不那么可怕了。只要他脑筋转得快一些，就可以避免吃苦头。主要是在他脑筋不灵的时候，奥勃良才扳杠杆。有时他们谈一次话没有用过一次仪表。他记不得他们已经谈过几次了。整个过程似乎拖得很长，时间也无限，可能有好几个星期，每次谈话与下次谈话之间有时可能间隔几天，有时只有一两小时。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'As you lie there,' said O'Brien, 'you have often wondered you have even asked me -- why the Ministry of Love should expend so much time and trouble on you. And when you were free you were puzzled by what was essentially the same question. You could grasp the mechanics of the Society you lived in, but not its underlying motives. Do you remember writing in your diary, "I understand how: I do not understand why"? It was when you thought about "why" that you doubted your own sanity. You have read the book, Goldstein's book, or parts of it, at least. Did it tell you anything that you did not know already?'</p><p>“你躺在那里，”奥勃良说，“你常常纳闷，而且你甚至问过我，为什么友爱部要在你身上化这么多的时间，费这么大的劲。当初你自由的时候，你也因基本上同样的问题而感到不解。你能够理解你所生活的社会的运转，但是你不理解它的根本动机。你还记得你曾经在日记上写过，‘我知道方法；但我不知道原因？’就是在你想‘原因’的时候，你对自己神志是否健全产生了怀疑。你已经读了那本书，果尔德施坦团的书，至少读过它的一部分。它有没有告诉你一些你原来不知道的东西？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'You have read it?' said Winston.</p><p>“你读过吗？”温斯顿问。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'I wrote it. That is to say, I collaborated in writing it. No book is produced individually, as you know.'</p><p>“是我写的。这是说，是我参加合写的。你也知道，没有一本书是单个人写的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'Is it true, what it says?'</p><p>“书里说的是不是真实的？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'A description, yes. The programme it sets forth is nonsense. The secret accumulation of knowledge -- a gradual spread of enlightenment -- ultimately a proletarian rebellion -- the overthrow of the Party. You foresaw yourself that that was what it would say. It is all nonsense. The proletarians will never revolt, not in a thousand years or a million. They cannot. I do not have to tell you the reason: you know it already. If you have ever cherished any dreams of violent insurrection, you must abandon them. There is no way in which the Party can be overthrown. The rule of the Party is for ever. Make that the starting-point of your thoughts.'</p><p>“作为描写，是真实的。但它所提出的纲领是胡说八道。秘密积累知识，逐渐扩大启蒙，最后发生无产阶级造反，推翻党。你不看也知道它要这样说。这都是胡说八道。无产阶级永远不会造反，一千年，一百万年也不会。他们不能造反。我无需把原因告诉你；你自己已经知道了。如果你曾经梦想过发生暴力起义，那你就抛弃这个梦想吧。没有办法推翻党。党的统治是永远的。把这当作你的思想的出发点。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He came closer to the bed. 'For ever!' he repeated. 'And now let us get back to the question of "how" and "why". You understand well enough how the Party maintains itself in power. Now tell me why we cling to power. What is our motive? Why should we want power? Go on, speak,' he added as Winston remained silent.</p><p>他向床边走近一些。“永远这样！”他重复说。“现在再回到‘方法’和‘原因’问题上来。你很了解党维持当权的‘方法’。现在请告诉我，我们要坚持当权的‘原因’。我们的动机是什么？我们为什么要当权？说吧，”他见温斯顿沉默不语就说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Nevertheless Winston did not speak for another moment or two. A feeling of weariness had overwhelmed him. The faint, mad gleam of enthusiasm had come back into O'Brien's face. He knew in advance what O'Brien would say. That the Party did not seek power for its own ends, but only for the good of the majority. That it sought power because men in the mass were frail cowardly creatures who could not endure liberty or face the truth, and must be ruled over and systematically deceived by others who were stronger than themselves. That the choice for mankind lay between freedom and happiness, and that, for the great bulk of mankind, happiness was better. That the party was the eternal guardian of the weak, a dedicated sect doing evil that good might come, sacrificing its own happiness to that of others. The terrible thing, thought Winston, the terrible thing was that when O'Brien said this he would believe it. You could see it in his face. O'Brien knew everything. A thousand times better than Winston he knew what the world was really like, in what degradation the mass of human beings lived and by what lies and barbarities the Party kept them there. He had understood it all, weighed it all, and it made no difference: all was justified by the ultimate purpose. What can you do, thought Winston, against the lunatic who is more intelligent than yourself, who gives your arguments a fair hearing and then simply persists in his lunacy?</p><p>但是温斯顿还是继续沉默了一两分钟。他感到一阵厌倦。奥勃良的脸上又隐隐出现了一种狂热的神情。他知道奥勃良会说些什么：党并不是为了自己的目的而要当权，而只是为了大多数人的利益。它要权力是因为群众都是软弱的、怯懦的可怜虫，既不知如何运用自由，也不知正视真理，必须由比他们强有力的人来加以统治，进行有计划的哄骗。人类面前的选择是自由或幸福，对大多数人类来说，选择幸福更好一些。党是弱者的永恒监护人，是为了使善可能到来才作恶的一个专心一致的派系，为了别人的幸福而牺牲自己的幸福。温斯顿心里想，可怕的是，奥勃良这么说的时候，他就会相信他。你可以从他脸上看出来。奥勃良什么都知道。比温斯顿好过一千倍，他知道世界究竟是怎么一回事，人类生活堕落到了什么程度，党用什么谎话和野蛮手段使他们处在那种地位。他完全明白的这一切，加以权衡，但这都无关重要，因为为了最终目的，一切手段都是正当的。温斯顿心里想，对于这样一个疯子，他比你聪明，他心平气和地听了你的论点，但是仍坚持他的疯狂，你有什么办法呢？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'You are ruling over us for our own good,' he said feebly. 'You believe that human beings are not fit to govern themselves, and therefore --'</p><p>“你们是为了我们自己的好处而统治我们，”他软弱地说，“你们认为人类不能自己管理自己，因此——”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He started and almost cried out. A pang of pain had shot through his body. O'Brien had pushed the lever of the dial up to thirty-five.</p><p>他惊了一下，几乎要叫出声来。他的全身一阵痛。奥勃良扳了杠杆，仪表的指针升到了三十五。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'That was stupid, Winston, stupid!' he said. 'You should know better than to say a thing like that.'</p><p>“真愚蠢，温斯顿，真愚蠢！”他说。“按你的水平，你不应该说这么一句话。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He pulled the lever back and continued:</p><p>他把杠杆扳回来，继续说：</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'Now I will tell you the answer to my question. It is this. The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power. Not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness: only power, pure power. What pure power means you will understand presently. We are different from all the oligarchies of the past, in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just round the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means, it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power. Now do you begin to understand me?'</p><p>“现在让我来告诉你，我的问题的答复是什么。答复是：党要当权完全是为了它自己。我们对别人的好处并没有兴趣。我们只对权力有兴趣。不论财富、奢侈、长寿或者幸福，我们都没有兴趣，只对权力，纯粹的权力有兴趣。纯粹的权力是什么意思，你马上就会知道。我们与以往的所有寡头政体都不同，那是在于我们知道自己在干什么。所有其他寡头政治家，即使那些同我们相象的人，也都是些懦夫和伪君子。德国的纳粹党人和俄国的共产党人在方法上同我们很相象，但是他们从来没有勇气承认自己的动机。他们假装，或许他们甚至相信，他们夺取权力不是出于自愿，只是为了一个有限的时期，不久就会出现一个人人都自由平等的天堂。我们可不是那样。我们很明白，没有人会为了废除权力而夺取权力。权力不是手段，权力是目的。建立专政不是为了保卫革命；反过来进行革命是为了建立专政。迫害的目的是迫害。拷打的目的是拷打。权力的目的是权力。现在你开始懂得我的意思了吧？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Winston was struck, as he had been struck before, by the tiredness of O'Brien's face. It was strong and fleshy and brutal, it was full of intelligence and a sort of controlled passion before which he felt himself helpless; but it was tired. There were pouches under the eyes, the skin sagged from the cheekbones. O'Brien leaned over him, deliberately bringing the worn face nearer.</p><p>奥勃良的疲倦的脸象以往一样使温斯顿感到很触目。这张脸坚强、肥厚、残忍，充满智慧，既有激情，又有节制，使他感到毫无办法，但是这张脸是疲倦的脸。眼眶下面有皱纹，双颊的皮肉松弛。奥勃良俯在他的头上，有意让他久经沧桑的脸移得更近一些。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'You are thinking,' he said, 'that my face is old and tired. You are thinking that I talk of power, and yet I am not even able to prevent the decay of my own body. Can you not understand, Winston, that the individual is only a cell? The weariness of the cell is the vigour of the organism. Do you die when you cut your fingernails?'</p><p>“你在想，”他说，“我的脸又老又疲倦。你在想，我在侈谈权力，却没有办法防止我自己身体的衰老。温斯顿，难道你不明白，个人只是一个细胞？一个细胞的衰变正是机体的活力。你把指甲剪掉的时候难道你就死了吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He turned away from the bed and began strolling up and down again, one hand in his pocket.</p><p>他从床边走开，又开始来回踱步，一只手放在口袋里。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'We are the priests of power,' he said. 'God is power. But at present power is only a word so far as you are concerned. It is time for you to gather some idea of what power means. The first thing you must realize is that power is collective. The individual only has power in so far as he ceases to be an individual. You know the Party slogan: "Freedom is Slavery". Has it ever occurred to you that it is reversible? Slavery is freedom. Alone -- free -- the human being is always defeated. It must be so, because every human being is doomed to die, which is the greatest of all failures. But if he can make complete, utter submission, if he can escape from his identity, if he can merge himself in the Party so that he is the Party, then he is all-powerful and immortal. The second thing for you to realize is that power is power over human beings. Over the body but, above all, over the mind. Power over matter -- external reality, as you would call it -- is not important. Already our control over matter is absolute.'</p><p>“我们是权力的祭师，”他说，“上帝是权力。不过在目前，对你来说，权力不过是个字眼。现在你应该对权力的含义有所了解。你必须明白的第一件事情是，权力是集体的。个人只是在停止作为个人的时候才有权力。你知道党的口号‘自由即奴役’。你有没有想到过这句口号是可以颠倒过来的？奴役即自由。一个人在单独和自由的时候总是要被打败的。所以必然如此，是因为人都必死，这是最大的失败。但是如果他能完全绝对服从，如果他能摆脱个人存在，如果他能与党打成一片而做到他就是党，党就是他，那么他就是全能的、永远不朽。你要明白的第二件事情是，所谓权力乃是对人的权力，是对身体，尤其是对思想的权力，对物质——你们所说的外部现实——的权力并不重要。我们对物质的控制现在已经做到了绝对的程度。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>For a moment Winston ignored the dial. He made a violent effort to raise himself into a sitting position, and merely succeeded in wrenching his body painfully.</p><p>温斯顿一时没有去注意仪表。他猛地想坐了起来，结果只是徒然感到一阵痛而已。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'But how can you control matter?' he burst out. 'You don't even control the climate or the law of gravity. And there are disease, pain, death --'</p><p>“但是你怎么能够控制物质呢？”他叫出声来道。“你们连气候或者地心吸力都还没法控制。而且还有疾病、痛苦、死亡——”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>O'Brien silenced him by a movement of his hand. 'We control matter because we control the mind. Reality is inside the skull. You will learn by degrees, Winston. There is nothing that we could not do. Invisibility, levitation -- anything. I could float off this floor like a soap bubble if I wish to. I do not wish to, because the Party does not wish it. You must get rid of those nineteenth-century ideas about the laws of Nature. We make the laws of Nature.'</p><p>奥勃良摆一摆手，叫他别说话。“我们所以能够控制物质，是因为我们控制了思想。现实存在于脑袋里。温斯顿，你会慢慢明白的。我们没有做不到的事情。隐身、升空——什么都行。只要我愿意，我可以象肥皂泡一样，在这间屋子里飘浮起来。我不愿意这么做是因为党不愿意我这么做。这种十九世纪式的自然规律观念，你必须把它们丢掉。自然规律是由我们来规定的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'But you do not! You are not even masters of this planet. What about Eurasia and Eastasia? You have not conquered them yet.'</p><p>“但是你们并没有！你们甚至还没有成为地球的主人！不是还有欧亚国和东亚国吗？你们还没有征服它们？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'Unimportant. We shall conquer them when it suits us. And if we did not, what difference would it make? We can shut them out of existence. Oceania is the world.'</p><p>“这无关重要。到了合适的时候都要征服。即使不征服，又有什么不同？我们可以否定它们的存在。大洋国就是世界。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'But the world itself is only a speck of dust. And man is tiny helpless! How long has he been in existence? For millions of years the earth was uninhabited.'</p><p>“但是世界本身只是一粒尘埃。而人是渺小的——毫无作为。人类存在多久了？有好几百万年地球上是没有人迹的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'Nonsense. The earth is as old as we are, no older. How could it be older? Nothing exists except through human consciousness.'</p><p>“胡说八道。地球的年代同人类一样长久，一点也不比人类更久。怎么可能比人类更久呢？除了通过人的意识，什么都不存在。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'But the rocks are full of the bones of extinct animals -- mammoths and mastodons and enormous reptiles which lived here long before man was ever heard of.'</p><p>“但是岩石里尽是已经绝迹的动物的骨骼化石——在人类出现以前很久在地球上生活过猛犸、柱牙象和庞大的爬行动物。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'Have you ever seen those bones, Winston? Of course not. Nineteenth-century biologists invented them. Before man there was nothing. After man, if he could come to an end, there would be nothing. Outside man there is nothing.'</p><p>“你自己看到过这种骨骼化石吗，温斯顿？当然没有。这是十九世纪生物学家捏造出来的。在人类出现以前什么都不存在。在人类绝迹后——如果人类有一天会绝迹的话——也没有什么会再存在。在人类之外没有别的东西存在。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'But the whole universe is outside us. Look at the stars! Some of them are a million light-years away. They are out of our reach for ever.'</p><p>“但是整个宇宙是在我们之外。看那星星！有些是在一百万光年之外。它们在我们永远及不到的地方。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'What are the stars?' said O'Brien indifferently. 'They are bits of fire a few kilometres away. We could reach them if we wanted to. Or we could blot them out. The earth is the centre of the universe. The sun and the stars go round it.'</p><p>“星星是什么？”奥勃良冷淡地说。“它们不过是几公里以外的光点。我们只要愿意就可以到那里。我们也可以把它们抹掉。地球是宇宙的中心。太阳和星星绕地球而转。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Winston made another convulsive movement. This time he did not say anything. O'Brien continued as though answering a spoken objection:</p><p>温斯顿又挣扎了一下。这次他没有说什么。奥勃良继续说下去，好象在回答对方说出来的反对意见。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'For certain purposes, of course, that is not true. When we navigate the ocean, or when we predict an eclipse, we often find it convenient to assume that the earth goes round the sun and that the stars are millions upon millions of kilometres away. But what of it? Do you suppose it is beyond us to produce a dual system of astronomy? The stars can be near or distant, according as we need them. Do you suppose our mathematicians are unequal to that? Have you forgotten doublethink?'</p><p>“为了一定目的，这话当然是不确的。比如我们在大海上航行的时候，或者在预测日食月食的时候，我们常常发现，假设地球绕太阳而转，星星远在亿万公里之外，这样比较方便。但这又怎样呢？难道你以为我们不能创造一种双重的天文学体系吗？星星可以近，也可以远，视我们需要而定。你以为我们的数学家做不到这一点吗？难道你忘掉了双重思想？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Winston shrank back upon the bed. Whatever he said, the swift answer crushed him like a bludgeon. And yet he knew, he knew, that he was in the right. The belief that nothing exists outside your own mind -- surely there must be some way of demonstrating that it was false? Had it not been exposed long ago as a fallacy? There was even a name for it, which he had forgotten. A faint smile twitched the corners of O'Brien's mouth as he looked down at him.</p><p>温斯顿在床上一缩。不论他说什么，对方迅速的回答就象给他打了一下闷棍一样。但是他知道自己明白他是对的。认为你自己思想以外不存在任何事物，这种想法肯定是有什么办法能够证明是不确的。不是早已揭露过这是一种谬论吗？甚至还有一个名称，不过他已记不起来了。奥勃良低头看着温斯顿，嘴角上飘起一丝嘲意。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'I told you, Winston,' he said, 'that metaphysics is not your strong point. The word you are trying to think of is solipsism. But you are mistaken. This is not solipsism. Collective solipsism, if you like. But that is a different thing: in fact, the opposite thing. All this is a digression,' he added in a different tone. 'The real power, the power we have to fight for night and day, is not power over things, but over men.' He paused, and for a moment assumed again his air of a schoolmaster questioning a promising pupil: 'How does one man assert his power over another, Winston?'</p><p>“我告诉过你，温斯顿，”他说，“形而上学不是你的所长。你在想的一个名词叫唯我论。可是你错了。这不是唯我论。这是集体唯我论。不过这是另外一回事。完全不同的一回事，可以说是相反的一回事。不过这都是题外话。”他又换了口气说。“真正的权力，我们日日夜夜为之奋战的权力，不是控制事物的权力，而是控制人的权力。”他停了下来，又恢复了一种教训聪颖儿童的教师神情：“温斯顿，一个人是怎样对另外一个人发挥权力的？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Winston thought. 'By making him suffer,' he said.</p><p>温斯顿想了一想说：“通过使另外一个人受苦。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Exactly. By making him suffer. Obedience is not enough. Unless he is suffering, how can you be sure that he is obeying your will and not his own? Power is in inflicting pain and humiliation. Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing. Do you begin to see, then, what kind of world we are creating? It is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic Utopias that the old reformers imagined. A world of fear and treachery is torment, a world of trampling and being trampled upon, a world which will grow not less but more merciless as it refines itself. Progress in our world will be progress towards more pain. The old civilizations claimed that they were founded on love or justice. Ours is founded upon hatred. In our world there will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph, and self-abasement. Everything else we shall destroy everything. Already we are breaking down the habits of thought which have survived from before the Revolution. We have cut the links between child and parent, and between man and man, and between man and woman. No one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend any longer. But in the future there will be no wives and no friends. Children will be taken from their mothers at birth, as one takes eggs from a hen. The sex instinct will be eradicated. Procreation will be an annual formality like the renewal of a ration card. We shall abolish the orgasm. Our neurologists are at work upon it now. </p><p>“说得不错。通过使另外一个人受苦。光是服从还不够。他不受苦，你怎么知道他在服从你的意志，不是他自己的意志？权力就在于给人带来痛苦和耻辱。权力就在于把人类思想撕得粉碎，然后按你自己所选择的样子把它再粘合起来。那么，你是不是开始明白我们要创建的是怎样一种世界？这种世界与老派改革家所设想的那种愚蠢的、享乐主义的乌托邦正好相反。这是一个恐惧、叛卖、折磨的世界，一个践踏和被践踏的世界，一个在臻于完善的过程中越来越无情的世界。我们这个世界里，所谓进步就是朝向越来越多痛苦的进步。以前的各种文明以建筑在博爱和正义上相标榜。我们建筑在仇恨上。在我们的世界里，除了恐惧、狂怒、得意、自贬以外，没有别的感情。其他一切都要摧毁。我们现在已经摧毁了革命前遗留下来的思想习惯。我们割断了子女与父母、人与人、男人与女人之间的联系；没有人再敢信任妻子、儿女、朋友。而且在将来，不再有妻子或朋友。子女一生下来就要脱离母亲，好象蛋一生下来就从母鸡身边取走一样、性的本能要消除掉。生殖的事要弄得象发配给证一样成为一年一度的手续形式。我们要消灭掉性的快感。我们的神经病学家正在研究这个问题。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>There will be no loyalty, except loyalty towards the Party. There will be no love, except the love of Big Brother. There will be no laughter, except the laugh of triumph over a defeated enemy. There will be no art, no literature, no science. When we are omnipotent we shall have no more need of science. There will be no distinction between beauty and ugliness. There will be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of life. All competing pleasures will be destroyed. But always -- do not forget this, Winston -- always there will be the intoxication of power, constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler. Always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory, the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless. </p><p>除了对党忠诚以外，没有其他忠诚。除了爱老大哥以外，没有其他的爱。除了因打败敌人而笑以外，没有其他的笑。不再有艺术，不再有文学，不再有科学。我们达到万能以后就不需要科学了。美与丑中再有区别。不再有好奇心，不再有生命过程的应用。一切其他乐趣都要消灭掉。但是，温斯顿，请你不要忘了，对于权力的沉醉，却永远存在，而且不断地增长，不断地越来越细腻。每时每刻，永远有胜利的欢悦，践踏束手待毙的敌人的快感。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face -- for ever.'</p><p>如果你要设想一幅未来的图景，就想象一只脚踩在一张人脸上好了——永远如此。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He paused as though he expected Winston to speak. Winston had tried to shrink back into the surface of the bed again. He could not say anything. His heart seemed to be frozen. O'Brien went on:</p><p>他停了下来等温斯顿说话。温斯顿又想钻到床底下去。他说不出话来。他的心脏似乎冰冻住了。奥勃良继续说：</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'And remember that it is for ever. The face will always be there to be stamped upon. The heretic, the enemy of society, will always be there, so that he can be defeated and humiliated over again. Everything that you have undergone since you have been in our hands -- all that will continue, and worse. The espionage, the betrayals, the arrests, the tortures, the executions, the disappearances will never cease. It will be a world of terror as much as a world of triumph. The more the Party is powerful, the less it will be tolerant: the weaker the opposition, the tighter the despotism. Goldstein and his heresies will live for ever. Every day, at every moment, they will be defeated, discredited, ridiculed, spat upon and yet they will always survive. This drama that I have played out with you during seven years will be played out over and over again generation after generation, always in subtler forms. Always we shall have the heretic here at our mercy, screaming with pain, broken up, contemptible -- and in the end utterly penitent, saved from himself, crawling to our feet of his own accord. That is the world that we are preparing, Winston. A world of victory after victory, triumph after triumph after triumph: an endless pressing, pressing, pressing upon the nerve of power. You are beginning, I can see, to realize what that world will be like. But in the end you will do more than understand it. You will accept it, welcome it, become part of it.'</p><p>“请记住，这是永远如此。那张脸永远在那里给你践踏。异端分子、社会公敌永远在那里，可以一而再再而三地打败他们，羞辱他们。你落到我们手中以后所经历的一切，会永远继续下去，而且只有更厉害。间谍活动、叛党卖国、逮捕拷打、处决灭迹，这种事情永远不会完。这个世界不仅是个胜利的世界，也同样是个恐怖的世界。党越有力量，就越不能容忍；反对力量越弱，专制暴政就越严。果尔德施坦因及其异端邪说将永远存在。他们无时无刻不受到攻击、取笑、辱骂、唾弃，但是他们总是仍旧存在。我在这七年中同你演出的这出戏将一代又一代永远一而再再而三地演下去，不过形式更加巧妙而已。我们总是要把异端分子提到这里来听我们的摆布，叫痛求饶，意气消沉，可卑可耻，最后痛悔前非，自动地爬到我们脚下来。这就是我们在制造的一个世界，温斯顿。一个胜利接着一个胜利的世界，没完没了地压迫着权力的神经。我可以看出，你已经开始明白这个世界将是什么样子。但是到最后，你会不止明白而已。你还会接受它，欢迎它，成为它的一部分。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Winston had recovered himself sufficiently to speak. 'You can't!' he said weakly.</p><p>温斯顿从震惊中恢复过来一些，有气无力地说：“你们不能这样！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'What do you mean by that remark, Winston?'</p><p>“温斯顿，你这话是什么意思？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'You could not create such a world as you have just described. It is a dream. It is impossible.'</p><p>“你们不可能创造一个象你刚才介绍的那样的世界，这是梦想，不可能实现。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'Why?'</p><p>“为什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'It is impossible to found a civilization on fear and hatred and cruelty. It would never endure.'</p><p>“因为不可能把文明建筑在恐惧、仇恨和残酷上。这种文明永远不能持久。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'Why not?'</p><p>“为什么不能？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'It would have no vitality. It would disintegrate. It would commit suicide.'</p><p>“它不会有生命力。它会分崩离析。它会自找毁灭。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'Nonsense. You are under the impression that hatred is more exhausting than love. Why should it be? And if it were, what difference would that make? Suppose that we choose to wear ourselves out faster. Suppose that we quicken the tempo of human life till men are senile at thirty. Still what difference would it make? Can you not understand that the death of the individual is not death? The party is immortal.'</p><p>“胡说八道。你以为仇恨比爱更消耗人的精力。为什么会是这样？即使如此，又有什么关系？假定我们就是要使自已衰亡得更快。假定我们就是要加速人生的速度，使得人满三十就衰老。那又有什么关系呢？你难道不明白，个人的死不是死？党是永生不朽的？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>As usual, the voice had battered Winston into helplessness. Moreover he was in dread that if he persisted in his disagreement O'Brien would twist the dial again. And yet he could not keep silent. Feebly, without arguments, with nothing to support him except his inarticulate horror of what O'Brien had said, he returned to the attack.</p><p>象刚才一样，一番话把温斯顿说得哑口无言。此外，他也担心，如果他坚持己见，奥勃良会开动仪表。但是他又不能沉默不语。于是他有气无力地又采取了攻势，只是没有什么强有力的论据，除了对奥勃良刚才的一番话感到说不出来的惊恐之外，没有任何其他的后盾。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'I don't know -- I don't care. Somehow you will fail. Something will defeat you. Life will defeat you.'</p><p>“我不知道——我也不管。反正你们会失败的。你们会遭到打败的。生活会打败你们。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'We control life, Winston, at all its levels. You are imagining that there is something called human nature which will be outraged by what we do and will turn against us. But we create human nature. Men are infinitely malleable. Or perhaps you have returned to your old idea that the proletarians or the slaves will arise and overthrow us. Put it out of your mind. They are helpless, like the animals. Humanity is the Party. The others are outside -- irrelevant.'</p><p>“我们控制着生活的一切方面，温斯顿。你在幻想，有什么叫做人性的东西，会因为我们的所作所为而感到愤慨，起来反对我们。但是人性是我们创造的。人的伸缩性无限大。你也许又想到无产阶级或者奴隶会起来推翻我们。快别作此想。他们象牲口一样一点也没有办法。党就是人性。其他都是外在的——无足轻重。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'I don't care. In the end they will beat you. Sooner or later they will see you for what you are, and then they will tear you to pieces.'</p><p>“我不管。他们最后会打败你们。他们迟早会看清你们的面目，那时他们会把你们打得粉碎。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'Do you see any evidence that that is happening? Or any reason why it should?'</p><p>“你看到什么迹象能说明这样的事情快要发生了吗？或者有什么理由吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'No. I believe it. I know that you will fail. There is something in the universe -- I don't know, some spirit, some principle -- that you will never overcome.'</p><p>“没有。但是我相信。我知道你们会失败。宇宙之中反正有什么东西——我不知道是精神，还是原则——是你们所无法胜过的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'Do you believe in God, Winston?'</p><p>“你相信上帝吗，温斯顿？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'No.'</p><p>“不相信。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'Then what is it, this principle that will defeat us?'</p><p>“那么那个会打败我们的原则又是什么呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'I don't know. The spirit of Man.'</p><p>“我不知道。人的精神。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'And do you consider yourself a man?'</p><p>“你认为自已是个人吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'Yes.'</p><p>“是的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'If you are a man, Winston, you are the last man. Your kind is extinct; we are the inheritors. Do you understand that you are alone? You are outside history, you are non-existent.' His manner changed and he said more harshly: 'And you consider yourself morally superior to us, with our lies and our cruelty?'</p><p>“如果你是人，温斯顿，那你就是最后一个人了。你那种人已经绝迹；我们是后来的新人。你不明白你是孤家寡人？你处在历史之外，你不存在。”他的态度改变了，口气更加严厉了：“你以为我们撒谎，我们残酷，因此你在精神上比我们优越？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'Yes, I consider myself superior.'</p><p>“是的，我认为我优越。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>O'Brien did not speak. Two other voices were speaking. After a moment Winston recognized one of them as his own. It was a sound-track of the conversation he had had with O'Brien, on the night when he had enrolled himself in the Brotherhood. He heard himself promising to lie, to steal, to forge, to murder, to encourage drug-taking and prostitution, to disseminate venereal diseases, to throw vitriol in a child's face. O'Brien made a small impatient gesture, as though to say that the demonstration was hardly worth making. Then he turned a switch and the voices stopped.</p><p>奥勃良没有说话。有另外两个声音在说话。过了一会儿，温斯顿听出其中一个声音就是他自己的声音。那是他参加兄弟会那个晚上同奥勃良谈话的录音带。他听到他自己答应要说谎、盗窃、伪造、杀人、鼓励吸毒和卖淫、散布梅毒、向孩子脸上浇镪水。奥勃良做了一个小手势，似乎是说不值得放这录音。他于是关上电门，说话声音就中断了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'Get up from that bed,' he said.</p><p>“起床吧，”他说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The bonds had loosened themselves. Winston lowered himself to the floor and stood up unsteadily.</p><p>绑带自动松开，温斯顿下了地，不稳地站起来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'You are the last man,' said O'Brien. 'You are the guardian of the human spirit. You shall see yourself as you are. Take off your clothes.'</p><p>“你是最后一个人，”奥勃良说。“你是人类精神的监护人。你看看自己是什么样子。把衣服脱掉。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Winston undid the bit of string that held his overalls together. The zip fastener had long since been wrenched out of them. He could not remember whether at any time since his arrest he had taken off all his clothes at one time. Beneath the overalls his body was looped with filthy yellowish rags, just recognizable as the remnants of underclothes. As he slid them to the ground he saw that there was a three-sided mirror at the far end of the room. He approached it, then stopped short. An involuntary cry had broken out of him.</p><p>温斯顿把扎住工作服的一根绳子解开。拉练早已取走了。他记不得被捕以后有没有脱光过衣服。工作服下面，他的身上是些肮脏发黄的破片，勉强可以看出来原来是内衣。他把它们脱下来扔到地上时，看到屋子那头有一个三面镜。他走过去，半路上就停住了。嘴里不禁惊叫出声。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'Go on,' said O'Brien. 'Stand between the wings of the mirror. You shall see the side view as well.'</p><p>“过去，”奥勃良说，“站在两面镜子中间，你就也可以看到侧面。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He had stopped because he was frightened. A bowed, greycoloured, skeleton-like thing was coming towards him. Its actual appearance was frightening, and not merely the fact that he knew it to be himself. He moved closer to the glass. The creature's face seemed to be protruded, because of its bent carriage. A forlorn, jailbird's face with a nobby forehead running back into a bald scalp, a crooked nose, and battered-looking cheekbones above which his eyes were fierce and watchful. </p><p>他停下来是因为他吓坏了。他看到一个死灰色的骷髅一样的人体弯着腰向他走近来。样子非常怕人，这不仅仅是因为他知道这人就是他自己。他走得距镜子更近一些。那人的脑袋似乎向前突出，那是因为身子佝偻的缘故。他的脸是个绝望无援的死囚的脸，额角高突，头顶光秃，尖尖的鼻子，沉陷的双颊，上面两只眼睛却灼灼发亮，凝视着对方。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The cheeks were seamed, the mouth had a drawn-in look. Certainly it was his own face, but it seemed to him that it had changed more than he had changed inside. The emotions it registered would be different from the ones he felt. He had gone partially bald. For the first moment he had thought that he had gone grey as well, but it was only the scalp that was grey. Except for his hands and a circle of his face, his body was grey all over with ancient, ingrained dirt. Here and there under the dirt there were the red scars of wounds, and near the ankle the varicose ulcer was an inflamed mass with flakes of skin peeling off it. But the truly frightening thing was the emaciation of his body. The barrel of the ribs was as narrow as that of a skeleton: the legs had shrunk so that the knees were thicker than the thighs. He saw now what O'Brien had meant about seeing the side view. The curvature of the spine was astonishing. The thin shoulders were hunched forward so as to make a cavity of the chest, the scraggy neck seemed to be bending double under the weight of the skull. At a guess he would have said that it was the body of a man of sixty, suffering from some malignant disease.</p><p>满脸都是皱纹，嘴巴塌陷。这毫无疑问是他自己的脸，但是他觉得变化好象比他内心的变化更大。它所表现的感情不是他内心感到的感情。他的头发已有一半秃光了，他起先以为自已头发也发白了，但是发白的是他的头皮。除了他的双手和脸上一圈以外，他全身发灰，污秽不堪。污垢的下面到处还有红色的疮疤，脚踝上的静脉曲张已溃疡成一片，皮肤一层一层掉下来。但是最吓人的还是身体羸弱的程度。胸口肋骨突出，与骷髅一样，大腿瘦得还不如膝盖粗。他现在明白了为什么奥勃良叫他看一看侧面。他的脊梁弯曲得怕人。瘦骨嶙嶙的双肩向前弯着。胸口深陷，皮包骨的脖子似乎吃不消脑袋的重压。如果叫他猜，他一定估计这是一个患有慢性痼疾的六十老翁的躯体。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'You have thought sometimes,' said O'Brien, 'that my face -- the face of a member of the Inner Party -- looks old and worn. What do you think of your own face?'</p><p>“你有时想，”奥勃良说，“我的脸——核心党党员的脸——老而疲惫。你对自己的脸有什么想法？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He seized Winston's shoulder and spun him round so that he was facing him.</p><p>他抓住温斯顿，把他转过身来正对着自己。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'Look at the condition you are in!' he said. 'Look at this filthy grime all over your body. Look at the dirt between your toes. Look at that disgusting running sore on your leg. Do you know that you stink like a goat? Probably you have ceased to notice it. Look at your emaciation. Do you see? I can make my thumb and forefinger meet round your bicep. I could snap your neck like a carrot. Do you know that you have lost twenty-five kilograms since you have been in our hands? Even your hair is coming out in handfuls. Look!' He plucked at Winston's head and brought away a tuft of hair. 'Open your mouth. Nine, ten, eleven teeth left. How many had you when you came to us? And the few you have left are dropping out of your head. Look here!'</p><p>“你瞧瞧自己成了什么样子！”他说。“你瞧瞧自已身上的这些污垢！你脚趾缝中的污垢。你脚上的烂疮。你知道自己臭得象头猪吗？也许你已经不再注意到了。瞧你这副消瘦的样子。你看到吗？你的胳膊还不如我的大拇指和食指合拢来的圈儿那么粗。我可以把你的脖子掐断，同折断一根胡萝卜一样，不费吹灰之力。你知道吗，你落到我们手中以后已经掉了二十五公斤？甚至你的头发也一把一把地掉。瞧！”他一揪温斯顿的头发，就掉下一把来。“张开嘴。还剩九颗、十颗、十一颗牙齿。你来的时候有几颗？剩下的几颗随时可掉。瞧！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He seized one of Winston's remaining front teeth between his powerful thumb and forefinger. A twinge of pain shot through Winston's jaw. O'Brien had wrenched the loose tooth out by the roots. He tossed it across the cell.</p><p>他用大拇指和食指有力地板住温斯顿剩下的一颗门牙。温斯顿上颚一阵痛。奥勃良已把那颗门牙扳了下来，扔在地上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'You are rotting away,' he said; 'you are falling to pieces. What are you? A bag of filth. Now turn around and look into that mirror again. Do you see that thing facing you? That is the last man. If you are human, that is humanity. Now put your clothes on again.'</p><p>“你已经在烂掉了，”他说，“你已经在崩溃了。你是什么？一堆垃圾。现在再转过去瞧瞧镜子里面。你见到你面前的东西吗？那就是最后的一个人。如果你是人，那就是人性。把衣服穿上吧。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Winston began to dress himself with slow stiff movements. Until now he had not seemed to notice how thin and weak he was. Only one thought stirred in his mind: that he must have been in this place longer than he had imagined. Then suddenly as he fixed the miserable rags round himself a feeling of pity for his ruined body overcame him. Before he knew what he was doing he had collapsed on to a small stool that stood beside the bed and burst into tears. </p><p>温斯顿手足迟钝地慢慢把衣服穿上。他到现在为止都从来没有想到过自己这么瘦弱。他的心中只有一个想法：他落在这个虎穴里一定比他所想象的时间还要久。他把这些破烂衣服穿上身后，对于自己被糟蹋的身体不禁感到一阵悲痛。他突然坐在床边的一把小板凳上放声哭了起来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He was aware of his ugliness, his gracelessness, a bundle of bones in filthy underclothes sitting weeping in the harsh white light: but he could not stop himself. O'Brien laid a hand on his shoulder, almost kindly.</p><p>他明知自已极不雅观，破布包扎的一把骨头</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'It will not last for ever,' he said. 'You can escape from it whenever you choose. Everything depends on yourself.'</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'You did it!' sobbed Winston. 'You reduced me to this state.'</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'No, Winston, you reduced yourself to it. This is what you accepted when you set yourself up against the Party. It was all contained in that first act. Nothing has happened that you did not foresee.'</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He paused, and then went on:</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'We have beaten you, Winston. We have broken you up. You have seen what your body is like. Your mind is in the same state. I do not think there can be much pride left in you. You have been kicked and flogged and insulted, you have screamed with pain, you have rolled on the floor in your own blood and vomit. You have whimpered for mercy, you have betrayed everybody and everything. Can you think of a single degradation that has not happened to you?'</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Winston had stopped weeping, though the tears were still oozing out of his eyes. He looked up at O'Brien.</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'I have not betrayed Julia,' he said.</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>O'Brien looked down at him thoughtfully. 'No,' he said; 'no; that is perfectly true. You have not betrayed Julia.'</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The peculiar reverence for O'Brien, which nothing seemed able to destroy, flooded Winston's heart again. How intelligent, he thought, how intelligent! Never did O'Brien fail to understand what was said to him. Anyone else on earth would have answered promptly that he had betrayed Julia. For what was there that they had not screwed out of him under the torture? He had told them everything he knew about her, her habits, her character, her past life; he had confessed in the most trivial detail everything that had happened at their meetings, all that he had said to her and she to him, their black-market meals, their adulteries, their vague plottings against the Party -- everything. And yet, in the sense in which he intended the word, he had not betrayed her. He had not stopped loving her; his feelings towards her had remained the same. O'Brien had seen what he meant without the need for explanation.</p><p>他有什么东西在拷打之下没有说出来呢？他把他所知道的有关她的情况告诉了他们：她的习惯、她的性格、她过去的生活；他极其详细地交代了他们幽会时所发生的一切、相互之间所说的话、黑市买卖、通奸、反党的密谋——一切的一切！然而，按照他的本意所用的词来说，他没有出卖她。他没有停止爱她；他对她的感情依然如旧。奥勃良明白他的意思，不需要任何解释。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'Tell me,' he said, 'how soon will they shoot me?'</p><p>“告诉我，”他问道，“他们什么时候枪毙我？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'It might be a long time,' said O'Brien. 'You are a difficult case. But don't give up hope. Everyone is cured sooner or later. In the end we shall shoot you.'</p><p>“可能要过很久，”奥勃良说，“你是个老大难问题。不过不要放弃希望。迟早一切总会治愈的。最后我们就会枪毙你。”</p></div>
