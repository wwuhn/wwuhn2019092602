<P>The Corpse Fiend Thrice Tricks Tang Sanzang</P>
<P>The Holy Monk Angrily Dismisses the Handsome Monkey King</P>
</div>
<P>At dawn the next day Sanzang and his three disciples packed their things before setting off. Now that Master Zhen Yuan had made Monkey his sworn brother and was finding him so congenial, he did not want to let him go, so he entertained him for another five or six days. Sanzang had really become a new man, and was livelier and healthier now that he had eaten the Grass-returning Cinnabar. His determination to fetch the scriptures was too strong to let him waste any more time, so there was nothing for it but to be on their way.</P>
<P>Soon after they had set out again, master and disciples saw a high mountain in front of them. &#8220;I'm afraid that the mountain ahead may be too steep for the horse,&#8221; Sanzang said, &#8220;so we must think this over carefully.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry, master,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;we know how to cope.&#8221; He went ahead of the horse with his cudgel over his shoulder and cleared a path up to the top of the cliff. He saw no end of</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Row upon row of craggy peaks,</P>
<P>Twisting beds of torrents.</P>
<P>Tigers and wolves were running in packs,</P>
<P>Deer and muntjac moving in herds.</P>
<P>Countless river-deer darted around.</P>
<P>And the mountains was covered with fox and hare.</P>
<P>Thousand-food pythons,</P>
<P>Ten-thousand-fathom snakes;</P>
<P>The great pythons puffed out murky clouds,</P>
<P>The enormous snakes breathed monstrous winds.</P>
<P>Brambles and thorns spread beside the paths,</P>
<P>Pines and cedars stood elegant on the ridge.</P>
<P>There were wild fig-trees wherever the eye could see,</P>
<P>And sweet-scented flowers as far as the horizon.</P>
<P>The mountain's shadow fell North of the ocean,</P>
<P>The clouds parted South of the handle of the Dipper.</P>
<P>The towering cliffs were as ancient as the primal Essence,</P>
<P>The majestic crags cold in the sunlight.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sanzang was immediately terrified, so Monkey resorted to some of his tricks. He whirled his iron cudgel and roared, at which all the wolves, snakes, tigers and leopards fled. They then started up the mountain, and as they were crossing a high ridge Sanzang said to Monkey, &#8220;Monkey, I've been hungry all day, so would you please go and beg some food for us somewhere.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You aren't very bright, master,&#8221; Monkey replied with a grin. &#8220;We're on a mountain with no village or inn for many miles around. Even if we had money there would be nowhere to buy food, so where am I to go and beg for it?&#8221; Sanzang felt cross, so he laid into Monkey. &#8220;You ape,&#8221; he said, &#8220;don't you remember how you were crushed by the Buddha in a stone cell under the Double Boundary Mountain, where you could talk but not walk? It was I who saved your life, administered the monastic vows to you, and made you my disciple. How dare you be such a slacker? Why aren't you prepared to make an effort?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I always make an effort,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'm never lazy.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you're such a hard worker, go and beg some food for us. I can't manage on an empty stomach. Besides, with the noxious vapors on this mountain we'll never reach the Thunder Monastery,&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please don't be angry, master, and stop talking. I know your obstinate character&#8212;if I'm too disobedient you'll say that spell. You'd better dismount and sit here while I find somebody and beg for some food.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey leapt up into the clouds with a single jump, and shading his eyes with his hand he looked around. Unfortunately he could see nothing in any direction except emptiness. There was no village or house or any other sign of human habitation among the countless trees. After looking for a long time he made out a high mountain away to the South. On its Southern slopes was a bright red patch.</P>
<P>Monkey brought his cloud down and said, &#8220;Master, there's something to eat.&#8221; Sanzang asked him what it was. &#8220;There's no house around here where we could ask for food,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;but there's a patch of red on a mountain to the South that I'm sure must be ripe wild peaches. I'll go and pick some&#8212;they'll fill you up.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;A monk who has peaches to eat is a lucky man,&#8221; said Sanzang. Monkey picked up his bowl and leapt off on a beam of light. Just watch as he flashes off in a somersault, a whistling gust of cold air. Within a moment he was picking peaches on the Southern mountain.</P>
<P>There is a saying that goes, &#8220;If the mountain is high it's bound to have fiends; if the ridge is steep spirits will live there.&#8221; This mountain did indeed have an evil spirit who was startled by Monkey's appearance. It strode through the clouds on a negative wind, and on seeing the venerable Sanzang on the ground below thought happily, &#8220;What luck, what luck. At home they've been talking for years about a Tang Monk from the East who's going to fetch the 'Great Vehicle'; he's a reincarnation of Golden Cicada, and has an Original Body that has been purified through ten lives. Anyone who eats a piece of his flesh will live for ever. And today, at last, he's here.&#8221; The evil spirit went forward to seize him, but the sight of the two great generals to Sanzang's left and right made it frightened to close in on him. Who, it wondered, were they? They were in fact Pig and Friar Sand, and for all that their powers were nothing extraordinary, Pig was really Marshal Tian Peng while Friar Sand was the Great Curtain-lifting General. It was because their former awe-inspiring qualities had not yet been dissipated that the fiend did not close in. &#8220;I'll try a trick on them and see what happens,&#8221; the spirit said to itself.</P>
<P>The splendid evil spirit stopped its negative wind in a hollow and changed itself into a girl with a face as round as the moon and as pretty as a flower. Her brow was clear and her eyes beautiful; her teeth were white and her lips red. In her left hand she held a blue earthenware pot and in her right a green porcelain jar. She headed East towards the Tang Priest.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The holy monk rested his horse on the mountain,</P>
<P>And suddenly noticed a pretty girl approaching.</P>
<P>The green sleeves over her jade fingers lightly billowed;</P>
<P>Golden lotus feet peeped under her trailing skirt.</P>
<P>The beads of sweat on her powdered face were dew on a flower,</P>
<P>Her dusty brow was a willow in a mist.</P>
<P>Carefully and closely he watched her</P>
<P>As she came right up to him.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Pig, Friar Sand,&#8221; said Sanzang when he saw her, &#8220;don't you see somebody coming although Monkey said that this was a desolate and uninhabited place?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You and Friar Sand stay sitting here while I go and take a look.&#8221; The blockhead laid down his rake, straightened his tunic, put on the airs of a gentleman, and stared at the girl as he greeted her. Although he had not been sure from a distance, he could now see clearly that the girl had</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Bones of jade under skin as pure as ice,</P>
<P>A creamy bosom revealed by her neckline.</P>
<P>Her willow eyebrows were black and glossy,</P>
<P>And silver stars shone from her almond eyes.</P>
<P>She was as graceful as the moon,</P>
<P>As pure as the heavens.</P>
<P>Her body was like a swallow in a willow-tree,</P>
<P>Her voice like an oriole singing in the wood.</P>
<P>She was wild apple-blossom enmeshing the sun,</P>
<P>An opening peony full of the spring.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the idiot Pig saw how beautiful she was his earthly desires were aroused, and he could not hold back the reckless words that came to his lips. &#8220;Where are you going, Bodhisattva,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and what's that you're holding?&#8221; Although she was obviously an evil fiend he could not realize it.</P>
<P>&#8220;Venerable sir,&#8221; the girl replied at once, &#8220;this blue pot is full of tasty rice, and the green jar contains fried wheat-balls. I've come here specially to fulfil a vow to feed monks.&#8221; Pig was thoroughly delighted to hear this. He came tumbling back at breakneck speed and said to Sanzang,</P>
<P>&#8220;Master, 'Heaven rewards the good'. When you sent my elder brother off begging because you felt hungry, that ape went fooling around somewhere picking peaches. Besides, too many peaches turn your stomach and give you the runs. Don't you see that this girl is coming to feed us monks?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You stupid idiot,&#8221; replied Sanzang, who was not convinced, &#8220;we haven't met a single decent person in this direction, so where could anyone come from to feed monks?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What's she then, master?&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>When Sanzang saw her he sprang to his feet, put his hands together in front of his chest, and said, &#8220;Bodhisattva, where is your home? Who are you? What vow brings you here to feed monks?&#8221; Although she was obviously an evil spirit, the venerable Sanzang could not see it either. On being asked about her background by Sanzang, the evil spirit immediately produced a fine-sounding story with which to fool him.</P>
<P>&#8220;This mountain, which snakes and wild animals won't go near, is called White Tiger Ridge,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Our home lies due West from here at the foot of it. My mother and father live there, and they are devout people who read the scriptures and feed monks from far and near. As they had no son, they asked Heaven to bless them. When I was born they wanted to marry me off to a good family, but then they decided to find me a husband who would live in our home to look after them in their old age and see them properly buried.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Bodhisattva, what you say can't be right,&#8221; replied Sanzang. &#8220;The<I> Analects</I> say, 'When father and mother are alive, do not go on long journeys; if you have to go out, have a definite aim.' As your parents are at home and have found you a husband, you should let him fulfil your vow for you. Why ever are you walking in the mountains all by yourself, without even a servant? This is no way for a lady to behave.&#8221;</P>
<P>The girl smiled and produced a smooth reply at once: &#8220;My husband is hoeing with some of our retainers in a hollow in the North of the mountain, reverend sir, and I am taking them this food I've cooked. As it's July and all the crops are ripening nobody can be spared to run errands, and my parents are old, so I'm taking it there myself. Now that I have met you three monks from so far away, I would like to give you this food as my parents are so pious. I hope you won't refuse our paltry offering.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's very good of you,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;but one of my disciples has gone to pick some fruit and will be back soon, so we couldn't eat any of your food. Besides, if we ate your food your husband might be angry with you when he found out, and we would get into trouble too.&#8221;</P>
<P>As the Tang Priest was refusing to eat the food, the girl put on her most charming expression and said, &#8220;My parents' charity to monks is nothing compared to my husband's, master. He is a religious man whose lifelong pleasure has been repairing bridges, mending roads, looking after the aged, and helping the poor. When he hears that I have given you this food, he'll love me more warmly than ever.&#8221; Sanzang still declined to eat it.</P>
<P>Pig was beside himself. Twisting his lips into a pout, he muttered indignantly, &#8220;Of all the monks on earth there can't be another as soft in the head as our master. He won't eat ready-cooked food when there are only three of us to share it between. He's waiting for that ape to come back, and then we'll have to split it four ways.&#8221; Without allowing any more discussion he tipped the pot towards his mouth and was just about to eat.</P>
<P>At just this moment Brother Monkey was somersaulting back with his bowl full of the peaches he had picked on the Southern mountain. When he saw with the golden pupils in his fiery eyes that the girl was an evil spirit, he put the bowl down, lifted his cudgel, and was going to hit her on the head when the horrified Sanzang held him back and said, &#8220;Who do you think you're going to hit?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That girl in front of you is no good,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;She's an evil spirit trying to make a fool of you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In the old days you had a very sharp eye, you ape,&#8221; Sanzang said, &#8220;but this is nonsense. This veritable Bodhisattva is feeding us with the best of motives, so how can you call her an evil spirit?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You wouldn't be able to tell, master,&#8221; said Monkey with a grin. &#8220;When I was an evil monster in the Water Curtain Cave I used to do that if I wanted a meal of human flesh. I would turn myself into gold and silver, or a country mansion, or liquor, or a pretty girl. Whoever was fool enough to be besotted with one of these would fall in love with me, and I would lure them into the cave, where I did what I wanted with them. Sometimes I ate them steamed and sometimes boiled, and what I couldn't finish I used to dry in the sun against a rainy day. If I'd been slower getting here, master, you'd have fallen into her snare and she'd have finished you off.&#8221; The Tang Priest refused to believe him and maintained that she was a good person.</P>
<P>&#8220;I know you, master,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Her pretty face must have made you feel randy. If that's the way you feel, tell Pig to fell a few trees and send Friar Sand look off to for some grass. I'll be the carpenter, and we'll build you a hut here that you and the girl can use as your bridal chamber. We can all go our own ways. Wouldn't marriage be a worthwhile way of living? Why bother plodding on to fetch some scriptures or other?&#8221; Sanzang, who had always been such a soft and virtuous man, was unable to take this. He was so embarrassed that he blushed from his shaven pate to his ears.</P>
<P>While Sanzang was feeling so embarrassed, Monkey flared up again and struck at the evil spirit's face. The fiend, who knew a trick or two, used a magic way of abandoning its body: when it saw Monkey's cudgel coming it braced itself and fled, leaving a false corpse lying dead on the ground.</P>
<P>Sanzang shook with terror and said to himself, &#8220;That monkey is utterly outrageous. Despite all my good advice he will kill people for no reason at all.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be angry, master,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Come and see what's in her pot.&#8221; Friar Sand helped Sanzang over to look, and he saw that far from containing tasty rice it was full of centipedes with long tails. The jar had held not wheat-balls but frogs and toads, which were now jumping around on the ground. Sanzang was now beginning to believe Monkey.</P>
<P>This was not enough, however, to prevent a furious Pig from deliberately making trouble by saying, &#8220;Master, that girl was a local countrywoman who happened to meet us while she was taking some food to the fields. There's no reason to think that she was an evil spirit. My elder brother was trying his club out on her, and he killed her by mistake. He's deliberately trying to trick us by magicking the food into those things because he's afraid you'll recite the Band-tightening spell. He's fooled you into not saying it.&#8221;</P>
<P>This brought the blindness back on Sanzang, who believed these trouble-making remarks and made the magic with his hand as he recited the spell. &#8220;My head's aching, my head's aching,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;Stop, please stop. Tell me off if you like.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've nothing to say to you,&#8221; replied Sanzang. &#8220;A man of religion should always help others, and his thoughts should always be virtuous. When sweeping the floor you must be careful not to kill any ants, and to spare the moth you should put gauze round your lamp. Why do you keep murdering people? If you are going to kill innocent people like that there is no point in your going to fetch the scriptures. Go back!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where am I to go back to?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I won't have you as my disciple any longer,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you won't have me as your disciple,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;I'm afraid you may never reach the Western Heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My destiny is in Heaven's hands,&#8221; replied Sanzang. &#8220;If some evil spirit is fated to cook me, he will; and there's no way of getting out of it. But if I'm not to be eaten, will you be able to extend my life? Be off with you at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll go if I must,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;but I'll never have repaid your kindness to me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What kindness have I ever done you?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>Monkey knelt down and kowtowed. &#8220;When I wrecked the Heavenly Palace,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I put myself in a very dangerous position, and the Buddha crashed me under the Double Boundary Mountain. Luckily the Bodhisattva Guanyin administered the vows to me, and you, master, released me, so if I don't go with you to the Western Heaven I'll look like a 'scoundrel who doesn't return a kindness, with a name that will be cursed for ever.'&#8221;</P>
<P>As Sanzang was a compassionate and holy monk this desperate plea from Monkey persuaded him to relent. &#8220;In view of what you say I'll let you off this time, but don't behave so disgracefully again. If you are ever as wicked as that again I shall recite that spell twenty times over.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Make it thirty if you like,&#8221; replied Monkey. &#8220;I shan't hit anyone else.&#8221; With that he helped Sanzang mount the horse and offered him some of the peaches he had picked. After eating a few the Tang Priest felt less hungry for the time being.</P>
<P>The evil spirit rose up into the air when it had saved itself from being killed by Monkey's cudgel. Gnashing its teeth in the clouds, it thought of Monkey with silent hatred: &#8220;Now I know that those magical powers of his that I've been hearing about for years are real. The Tang Priest didn't realize who I was and would have eaten the food. If he'd so much as leant forward to smell it I could have seized him, and he would have been mine. But that Monkey turned up, wrecked my plan, and almost killed me with his club. If I spare that monk now I'll have gone to all that trouble for nothing, so I'll have another go at tricking him.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid evil spirit landed its negative cloud, shook itself, and changed into an old woman in her eighties who was weeping as she hobbled along leaning on a bamboo stick with a crooked handle.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is terrible, master,&#8221; exclaimed Pig with horror at the sight of her. &#8220;Her mother's come to look for her.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;For whom?&#8221; asked the Tang Priest.</P>
<P>&#8220;It must be her daughter that my elder brother killed,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;This must be the girl's mother looking for her.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't talk nonsense,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;That girl was eighteen and this old woman is eighty. How could she possibly have had a child when she was over sixty? She must be a fake. Let me go and take a look.&#8221; The splendid Monkey hurried over to examine her and saw that the monster had</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Turned into an old woman</P>
<P>With temples as white as frozen snow.</P>
<P>Slowly she stumbled along the road,</P>
<P>Making her way in fear and trembling.</P>
<P>Her body was weak and emaciated,</P>
<P>Her face like a withered leaf of cabbage.</P>
<P>Her cheekbone was twisted upwards,</P>
<P>While the ends of her lips went down.</P>
<P>How can old age compare with youth?</P>
<P>Her face was as creased as a pleated bag.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Realizing that she was an evil spirit, Monkey did not wait to argue about it, but raised his cudgel and struck at her head. Seeing the blow coining, the spirit braced itself again and extracted its true essence once more. The false corpse sprawled dead beside the path. Sanzang was so horrified that he fell off the horse and lay beside the path, reciting the Band-tightening Spell twenty times over. Poor Monkey's head was squeezed so hard that it looked like a narrow-waisted gourd. The pain was unbearable, and he rolled over towards his master to plead, &#8220;Stop, master. Say whatever you like.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have nothing to say,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;If a monk does good he will not fall into hell. Despite all my preaching you still commit murder. How can you? No sooner have you killed one person than you kill another. It's an outrage.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;She was an evil spirit,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Nonsense, you ape,&#8221; said the Tang Priest, &#8220;as if there could be so many monsters! You haven't the least intention of reforming, and you are a deliberate murderer. Be off with you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Are you sending me away again, master?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;I'll go if I must, but there's one thing I won't agree to.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What,&#8221; Sanzang asked, &#8220;would that be?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; Pig put in, &#8220;he wants the baggage divided between you and him. He's been a monk with you for several years, and hasn't succeeded in winning a good reward. You can't let him go away empty-handed. Better give him a worn-out tunic and a tattered hat from the bundle.&#8221;</P>
<P>This made Monkey jump with fury. &#8220;I'll get you, you long-snouted moron,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I've been a true Buddhist with no trace of covetousness or greed. I certainly don't want a share of the baggage.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you're neither covetous nor greedy,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;why won't you go away?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;To be quite honest with you, master,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;when I lived in the Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit and knew all the great heroes, I won the submission of seventy-two other demon kings and had forty-seven thousand minor demons under me. I used to wear a crown of purple gold and a yellow robe with a belt of the finest jade. I had cloud-treading shoes on my feet and held an As-You-Will gold-banded cudgel in my hands. I really was somebody then. But when I attained enlightenment and repented, I shaved my head and took to the Buddhist faith as your disciple. I couldn't face my old friends if I went back with this golden band round my head. So if you don't want me any longer, master, please say the Band-loosening Spell and I'll take it off and give it back to you. I'll gladly agree to you putting it round someone else's head. As I've been your disciple for so long, surely you can show me this kindness.&#8221; Sanzang was deeply shocked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Monkey,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the Bodhisattva secretly taught me the Band-tightening Spell, but not a band-loosening one.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case you'll have to let me come with you,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Get up then,&#8221; said Sanzang, feeling that he had no option, &#8220;I'll let you off again just this once. But you must never commit another murder.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I never will,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;never again.&#8221; He helped his master mount the horse and led the way forward.</P>
<P>The evil spirit, who had not been killed the second time Monkey hit it either, was full of admiration as it floated in mid-air. &#8220;What a splendid Monkey King,&#8221; it thought, &#8220;and what sharp eyes. He saw who I was through both my transformations. Those monks are travelling fast, and once they're over the mountain and fifteen miles to the West they'll be out of my territory. And other fiends and monsters who catch them will be laughing till their mouths split, and I'll be heartbroken with sorrow. I'll have to have another go at tricking them.&#8221; The excellent evil spirit brought its negative wind down to the mountainside and with one shake turned itself into an old man.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>His hair was as white as Ancient Peng's,</P>
<P>His temples as hoary as the Star of Longevity.</P>
<P>Jade rang in his ears,</P>
<P>And his eyes swam with golden stars.</P>
<P>He leant on a dragon-headed stick,</P>
<P>And wore a cloak of crane feathers.</P>
<P>In his hands he fingered prayer-beads</P>
<P>While reciting Buddhist sutras.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Sanzang saw him from the back of his horse he said with great delight, &#8220;Amitabha Buddha! The West is indeed a blessed land. That old man is forcing himself to recite scriptures although he can hardly walk.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;don't be so nice about him. He's going to give us trouble.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;My elder brother has killed the daughter and the old woman, and this is the old man coming to look for them. If we fall into his hands you'll have to pay with your life. It'll be the death penalty for you, and I'll get a long sentence for being your accomplice. Friar Sand will be exiled for giving the orders. That elder brother will disappear by magic, and we three will have to carry the can.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't talk such nonsense, you moron,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;You're terrifying the master. Wait while I go and have another look.&#8221; Hiding the cudgel about his person he went up to the monster and said, &#8220;Where are you going, venerable sir? And why are you reciting scriptures as you walk along?&#8221;</P>
<P>The monster, failing to recognize his opponent, thought that the Great Sage Monkey was merely a passer-by and said, &#8220;Holy sir, my family has lived here for generations, and all my life I have done good deeds, fed monks, read the scriptures, and repeated the Buddha's name. As fate has it I have no son, only a daughter, and she lives at home with her husband. She went off to the fields with food early this morning, and I'm afraid she may have been eaten by a tiger. My wife went out to look for her, and she hasn't come back either. I've no idea what's happened to them, so I've come to search for them. If they have died, I shall just have to gather their bones and take them back for a decent burial.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm a master of disguise,&#8221; replied Monkey with a grin, &#8220;so don't try to pull the wool over my eyes. You can't fool me. I know that you're an evil spirit.&#8221; The monster was speechless with fright. Monkey brandished his cudgel and thought, &#8220;If I don't kill him he'll make a getaway; but if I do, my master will say that spell.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yet if I don't kill him,&#8221; he went on to reflect, &#8220;I'll take a lot of thought and effort to rescue the master when this monster seizes some other chance to carry him off. The best thing is to kill him. If I kill him with the cudgel the master will say the spell, but then 'even a vicious tiger doesn't eat her own cubs'. I'll be able to get round my master with my smooth tongue and some well chosen words.&#8221; The splendid Great Sage uttered a spell and called out to the local deities and the gods of the mountains, &#8220;This evil spirit has tried to trick my master three times, and I'm now going to kill it. I want you to be witnesses in the air around me. Don't leave!&#8221; Hearing this command, the gods all had to obey and watch from the clouds. The Great Sage raised his cudgel and struck down the monster. Now, at last, it was dead.</P>
<P>The Tang Priest was shaking with terror on the back of his horse, unable to speak.</P>
<P>Pig stood beside him and said with a laugh, &#8220;That Monkey's marvellous, isn't he! He's gone mad. He's killed three people in a few hours' journey.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Tang Priest was just going to say the spell when Monkey threw himself in front of his horse and called out, &#8220;Don't say it, master, don't say it. Come and have a look at it.&#8221; It was now just a pile of dusty bones.</P>
<P>&#8220;He's only just been killed, Wukong,&#8221; Sanzang said in astonishment, &#8220;so why has he turned into a skeleton?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It was a demon corpse with magic powers that used to deceive people and destroy them. Now that I've killed it, it's reverted to its original form. The writing on her backbone says that she's called 'Lady White Bone.'&#8220; Sanzang was convinced, but Pig had to make trouble again.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; he said, &#8220;he's afraid that you'll say those words because he killed him with a vicious blow from his cudgel, and so he's made him look like this to fool you.&#8221; The Tang Priest, who really was gullible, now believed Pig, and he started to recite the spell.</P>
<P>Monkey, unable to stop the pain, knelt beside the path and cried, &#8220;Stop, stop. Say whatever it is you have to say,&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Baboon,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;I have nothing more to say to you. If a monk acts rightly he will grow daily but invisibly, like grass in a garden during the spring, whereas an evildoer will be imperceptibly worn away day by day like a stone. You have killed three people, one after the other, in this wild and desolate place, and there is nobody here to find you out or bring a case against you. But if you go to a city or some other crowded place and start laying about you with that murderous cudgel, we'll be in big trouble and there will be no escape for us. Go back!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're wrong to hold it against me, master,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;as that wretch was obviously an evil monster set on murdering you. But so far from being grateful that I've saved you by killing it, you would have to believe that idiot's tittle-tattle and keep sending me away. As the saying goes, you should never have to do anything more that three times. I'd be a low and shameless creature if I didn't go now. I'll go, I'll go all right, but who will you have left to look after you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Damned ape,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;you get ruder and ruder. You seem to think that you're the only one. What about Pig and Friar Sand? Aren't they people?&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing him say that Pig and Friar Sand were suitable people too, Monkey was very hurt. &#8220;That's a terrible thing to hear, master,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When you left Chang'an, Liu Boqin helped you on your way, and when you reached the Double Boundary Mountain you saved me and I took you as my master. I've gone into ancient caves and deep forests capturing monsters and demons. I won Pig and Friar Sand over, and I've had a very hard time of it. But today you've turned stupid and you're sending me back. 'When the birds have all been shot the bow is put away, and when the rabbits are all killed the hounds are stewed.' Oh well! If only you hadn't got that Band-tightening Spell.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I won't recite it again,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;You shouldn't say that,&#8221; replied Monkey. &#8220;If you're ever beset by evil monsters from whom you can't escape, and if Pig and Friar Sand can't save you, then think of me. If it's unbearable, say the spell. My head will ache even if I'm many tens of thousands of miles away. But if I do come back to you, never say it again.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Tang Priest grew angrier and angrier as Monkey talked on, and tumbling off his horse he told Friar Sand to take paper and brush from the pack. Then he fetched some water from a stream, rubbed the inkstick on a stone, wrote out a letter of dismissal, and handed it to Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Here it is in writing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don't want you as my disciple a moment longer. If I ever see you again may I fall into the Avichi Hell.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey quickly took the document and said, &#8220;There's no need to swear an oath, master. I'm off.&#8221; He folded the paper up and put it in his sleeve, then tried once more to mollify Sanzang. &#8220;Master,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I've spent some time with you, and I've also been taught by the Bodhisattva. Now I'm being fired in the middle of the journey, when I've achieved nothing. Please sit down and accept my homage, then I won't feel so bad about going.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Tang Priest turned away and would not look at him, muttering, &#8220;I am a good monk, and I won't accept the respects of bad people like you.&#8221; Seeing that Sanzang was refusing to face him, the Great Sage used magic to give himself extra bodies. He blew a magic breath on three hairs plucked from the back of his head and shouted, &#8220;Change!&#8221; They turned into three more Monkeys, making a total of four with the real one, and surrounding the master on all four sides they kowtowed to him. Unable to avoid them by dodging to left or right, Sanzang had to accept their respects.</P>
<P>The Great Sage jumped up, shook himself, put the hairs back, and gave Friar Sand these instructions: &#8220;You are a good man, my brother, so mind you stop Pig from talking nonsense and be very careful on the journey. If at any time evil spirits capture our master, you tell them that I'm his senior disciple. The hairy devils of the West have heard of my powers and won't dare to harm him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am a good monk,&#8221; said the Tang Priest, &#8220;and I'd never mention the name of a person as bad as you. Go back.&#8221; As his master refused over and over again to change his mind Monkey had nothing for it but to go. Look at him:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Holding back his tears he bowed good-bye to his master,</P>
<P>Then sadly but with care he gave instructions to Friar Sand.</P>
<P>His head pushed the hillside grass apart,</P>
<P>His feet kicked the creepers up in the air.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Heaven and earth spun round like a wheel;</P>
<P>At flying over mountains and seas none could beat him.</P>
<P>Within an instant no sign of him could be seen;</P>
<P>He retraced his whole journey in a flash.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Holding back his anger, Monkey left his master and went straight back to the Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit on his somersault cloud. He was feeling lonely and miserable when he heard the sound of water. When he looked around from where he was in midair, he realized that it was the waves of the Eastern Sea. The sight of it reminded him of the Tang Priest, and he could not stop the tears from rolling down his cheeks. He stopped his cloud and stayed there a long time before going. If you don't know what happened when he went, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>	</div>

<p>尸魔三戏唐三藏</p>
<p>圣僧恨逐美猴王</p>
</div>
<p>却说三藏师徒，次日天明，收拾前进。那镇元子与行者结为兄弟，两人情投意合，决不肯放，又安排管待，一连住了五六日。那长老自服了草还丹，真似脱胎换骨，神爽体健。他取经心重，那里肯淹留，无已，遂行。</p>

<p>师徒别了上路，早见一座高山。三藏道：“徒弟，前面有山险峻，恐马不能前，大家须仔细仔细。”行者道：“师父放心，我等自然理会。”好猴王，他在那马前，横担着棒，剖开山路，上了高崖，看不尽：峰岩重叠，涧壑湾环。虎狼成阵走，麂鹿作群行。</p>

<p>无数獐豝钻簇簇，满山狐兔聚丛丛。千尺大蟒，万丈长蛇。大蟒喷愁雾，长蛇吐怪风。道旁荆棘牵漫，岭上松楠秀丽。薜萝满目，芳草连天。影落沧溟北，云开斗柄南。万古常含元气老，千峰巍列日光寒。那长老马上心惊，孙大圣布施手段，舞着铁棒，哮吼一声，唬得那狼虫颠窜，虎豹奔逃。师徒们入此山，正行到嵯峨之处，三藏道：“悟空，我这一日，肚中饥了，你去那里化些斋吃？”行者陪笑道：“师父好不聪明。这等半山之中，前不巴村，后不着店，有钱也没买处，教往那里寻斋？”三藏心中不快，口里骂道：“你这猴子！想你在两界山，被如来压在石匣之内，口能言，足不能行，也亏我救你性命，摩顶受戒，做了我的徒弟。怎么不肯努力，常怀懒惰之心！”行者道：“弟子亦颇殷勤，何尝懒惰？”三藏道：“你既殷勤，何不化斋我吃？我肚饥怎行？况此地山岚瘴气，怎么得上雷音？”行者道：“师父休怪，少要言语。我知你尊性高傲，十分违慢了你，便要念那话儿咒。你下马稳坐，等我寻那里有人家处化斋去。”行者将身一纵，跳上云端里，手搭凉篷，睁眼观看。可怜西方路甚是寂寞，更无庄堡人家，正是多逢树木少见人烟去处。看多时，只见正南上有一座高山，那山向阳处，有一片鲜红的点子。行者按下云头道：</p>

<p>“师父，有吃的了。”那长老问甚东西，行者道：“这里没人家化饭，那南山有一片红的，想必是熟透了的山桃，我去摘几个来你充饥。”三藏喜道：“出家人若有桃子吃，就为上分了，快去！”</p>

<p>行者取了钵盂，纵起祥光，你看他觔斗幌幌，冷气飕飕，须臾间，奔南山摘桃不题。</p>

<p>却说常言有云：山高必有怪，岭峻却生精。果然这山上有一个妖精，孙大圣去时，惊动那怪。他在云端里，踏着阴风，看见长老坐在地下，就不胜欢喜道：“造化！造化！几年家人都讲东土的唐和尚取大乘，他本是金蝉子化身，十世修行的原体。</p>

<p>有人吃他一块肉，长寿长生。真个今日到了。”那妖精上前就要拿他，只见长老左右手下有两员大将护持，不敢拢身。他说两员大将是谁？说是八戒、沙僧。八戒、沙僧虽没甚么大本事，然八戒是天蓬元帅，沙僧是卷帘大将，他的威气尚不曾泄，故不敢拢身。妖精说：“等我且戏他戏，看怎么说。”</p>

<p>好妖精，停下阴风，在那山凹里，摇身一变，变做个月貌花容的女儿，说不尽那眉清目秀，齿白唇红，左手提着一个青砂罐儿，右手提着一个绿磁瓶儿，从西向东，径奔唐僧。圣僧歇马在山岩，忽见裙钗女近前。翠袖轻摇笼玉笋，湘裙斜拽显金莲。</p>

<p>汗流粉面花含露，尘拂峨眉柳带烟。仔细定睛观看处，看看行至到身边。三藏见了，叫：“八戒，沙僧，悟空才说这里旷野无人，你看那里不走出一个人来了？”八戒道：“师父，你与沙僧坐着，等老猪去看看来。”那呆子放下钉钯，整整直裰，摆摆摇摇，充作个斯文气象，一直的觌面相迎。真个是远看未实，近看分明，那女子生得：冰肌藏玉骨，衫领露酥胸。柳眉积翠黛，杏眼闪银星。月样容仪俏，天然性格清。体似燕藏柳，声如莺啭林。</p>

<p>半放海棠笼晓日，才开芍药弄春晴。那八戒见他生得俊俏，呆子就动了凡心，忍不住胡言乱语，叫道：“女菩萨，往那里去？手里提着是甚么东西？”分明是个妖怪，他却不能认得。那女子连声答应道：“长老，我这青罐里是香米饭，绿瓶里是炒面筋，特来此处无他故，因还誓愿要斋僧。”八戒闻言，满心欢喜，急抽身，就跑了个猪颠风，报与三藏道：“师父！吉人自有天报！师父饿了，教师兄去化斋，那猴子不知那里摘桃儿耍子去了。桃子吃多了，也有些嘈人，又有些下坠。你看那不是个斋僧的来了？”唐僧不信道：“你这个夯货胡缠！我们走了这向，好人也不曾遇着一个，斋僧的从何而来！”八戒道：“师父，这不到了？”</p>

<p>三藏一见，连忙跳起身来，合掌当胸道：“女菩萨，你府上在何处住？是甚人家？有甚愿心，来此斋僧？”分明是个妖精，那长老也不认得。那妖精见唐僧问他来历，他立地就起个虚情，花言巧语来赚哄道：“师父，此山叫做蛇回兽怕的白虎岭，正西下面是我家。我父母在堂，看经好善，广斋方上远近僧人，只因无子，求福作福，生了奴奴，欲扳门第，配嫁他人，又恐老来无倚，只得将奴招了一个女婿，养老送终。”三藏闻言道：“女菩萨，你语言差了。圣经云：父母在，不远游，游必有方。你既有父母在堂，又与你招了女婿，有愿心，教你男子还，便也罢，怎么自家在山行走？又没个侍儿随从。这个是不遵妇道了。”</p>

<p>那女子笑吟吟，忙陪俏语道：“师父，我丈夫在山北凹里，带几个客子锄田。这是奴奴煮的午饭，送与那些人吃的。只为五黄六月，无人使唤，父母又年老，所以亲身来送。忽遇三位远来，却思父母好善，故将此饭斋僧，如不弃嫌，愿表芹献。”三藏道：</p>

<p>“善哉！善哉！我有徒弟摘果子去了，就来，我不敢吃。假如我和尚吃了你饭，你丈夫晓得，骂你，却不罪坐贫僧也？”那女子见唐僧不肯吃，却又满面春生道：“师父啊，我父母斋僧，还是小可；我丈夫更是个善人，一生好的是修桥补路，爱老怜贫。但听见说这饭送与师父吃了，他与我夫妻情上，比寻常更是不同。”三藏也只是不吃，旁边却恼坏了八戒。那呆子努着嘴，口里埋怨道：“天下和尚也无数，不曾象我这个老和尚罢软！现成的饭三分儿倒不吃，只等那猴子来，做四分才吃！”他不容分说，一嘴把个罐子拱倒，就要动口。</p>

<p>只见那行者自南山顶上，摘了几个桃子，托着钵盂，一筋斗，点将回来，睁火眼金睛观看，认得那女子是个妖精，放下钵盂，掣铁棒，当头就打。唬得个长老用手扯住道：“悟空！你走将来打谁？”行者道：“师父，你面前这个女子，莫当做个好人。</p>

<p>他是个妖精，要来骗你哩。”三藏道：“你这猴头，当时倒也有些眼力，今日如何乱道！这女菩萨有此善心，将这饭要斋我等，你怎么说他是个妖精？”行者笑道：“师父，你那里认得！老孙在水帘洞里做妖魔时，若想人肉吃，便是这等：或变金银，或变庄台，或变醉人，或变女色。有那等痴心的，爱上我，我就迷他到洞里，尽意随心，或蒸或煮受用；吃不了，还要晒干了防天阴哩！师父，我若来迟，你定入他套子，遭他毒手！”那唐僧那里肯信，只说是个好人。行者道：“师父，我知道你了，你见他那等容貌，必然动了凡心。若果有此意，叫八戒伐几棵树来，沙僧寻些草来，我做木匠，就在这里搭个窝铺，你与他圆房成事，我们大家散了，却不是件事业？何必又跋涉，取甚经去！”那长老原是个软善的人，那里吃得他这句言语，羞得个光头彻耳通红。三藏正在此羞惭，行者又发起性来，掣铁棒，望妖精劈脸一下。那怪物有些手段，使个解尸法，见行者棍子来时，他却抖擞精神，预先走了，把一个假尸首打死在地下。唬得个长老战战兢兢，口中作念道：“这猴着然无礼！屡劝不从，无故伤人性命！”行者道：“师父莫怪，你且来看看这罐子里是甚东西。”沙僧搀着长老，近前看时，那里是甚香米饭，却是一罐子拖尾巴的长蛆，也不是面筋，却是几个青蛙、癞虾蟆，满地乱跳。长老才有三分儿信了，怎禁猪八戒气不忿，在旁漏八分儿唆嘴道：“师父，说起这个女子，他是此间农妇，因为送饭下田，路遇我等，却怎么栽他是个妖怪？哥哥的棍重，走将来试手打他一下，不期就打杀了；怕你念甚么《紧箍儿咒》，故意的使个障眼法儿，变做这等样东西，演幌你眼，使不念咒哩。”</p>

<p>三藏自此一言，就是晦气到了：果然信那呆子撺唆，手中捻诀，口里念咒，行者就叫：“头疼！头疼！莫念！莫念！有话便说。”唐僧道：“有甚话说！出家人时时常要方便，念念不离善心，扫地恐伤蝼蚁命，爱惜飞蛾纱罩灯。你怎么步步行凶，打死这个无故平人，取将经来何用？你回去罢！”行者道：“师父，你教我回那里去？”唐僧道：“我不要你做徒弟。”行者道：“你不要我做徒弟，只怕你西天路去不成。”唐僧道：“我命在天，该那个妖精蒸了吃，就是煮了，也算不过。终不然，你救得我的大限？</p>

<p>你快回去！”行者道：“师父，我回去便也罢了，只是不曾报得你的恩哩。”唐僧道：“我与你有甚恩？”那大圣闻言，连忙跪下叩头道：“老孙因大闹天宫，致下了伤身之难，被我佛压在两界山，幸观音菩萨与我受了戒行，幸师父救脱吾身，若不与你同上西天，显得我知恩不报非君子，万古千秋作骂名。”原来这唐僧是个慈悯的圣僧，他见行者哀告，却也回心转意道：“既如此说，且饶你这一次，再休无礼。如若仍前作恶，这咒语颠倒就念二十遍！”行者道：“三十遍也由你，只是我不打人了。”却才伏侍唐僧上马，又将摘来桃子奉上。唐僧在马上也吃了几个，权且充饥。</p>

<p>却说那妖精，脱命升空。原来行者那一棒不曾打杀妖精，妖精出神去了。他在那云端里，咬牙切齿，暗恨行者道：“几年只闻得讲他手段，今日果然话不虚传。那唐僧已此不认得我，将要吃饭。若低头闻一闻儿，我就一把捞住，却不是我的人了？</p>

<p>不期被他走来，弄破我这勾当，又几乎被他打了一棒。若饶了这个和尚，诚然是劳而无功也，我还下去戏他一戏。”</p>

<p>好妖精，按落阴云，在那前山坡下，摇身一变，变作个老妇人，年满八旬，手拄着一根弯头竹杖，一步一声的哭着走来。八戒见了，大惊道：“师父！不好了！那妈妈儿来寻人了！”唐僧道：</p>

<p>“寻甚人？”八戒道：“师兄打杀的，定是他女儿。这个定是他娘寻将来了。”行者道：“兄弟莫要胡说！那女子十八岁，这老妇有八十岁，怎么六十多岁还生产？断乎是个假的，等老孙去看来。”好行者，拽开步，走近前观看，那怪物：假变一婆婆，两鬓如冰雪。走路慢腾腾，行步虚怯怯。弱体瘦伶仃，脸如枯菜叶。</p>

<p>颧骨望上翘，嘴唇往下别。老年不比少年时，满脸都是荷叶摺。</p>

<p>行者认得他是妖精，更不理论，举棒照头便打。那怪见棍子起时，依然抖擞，又出化了元神，脱真儿去了，把个假尸首又打死在山路之下。唐僧一见，惊下马来，睡在路旁，更无二话，只是把《紧箍儿咒》颠倒足足念了二十遍。可怜把个行者头，勒得似个亚腰儿葫芦，十分疼痛难忍，滚将来哀告道：“师父莫念了！</p>

<p>有甚话说了罢！”唐僧道：“有甚话说！出家人耳听善言，不堕地狱。我这般劝化你，你怎么只是行凶？把平人打死一个，又打死一个，此是何说？”行者道：“他是妖精。”唐僧道：“这个猴子胡说！就有这许多妖怪！你是个无心向善之辈，有意作恶之人，你去罢！”行者道：“师父又教我去，回去便也回去了，只是一件不相应。”唐僧道：“你有甚么不相应处？”八戒道：“师父，他要和你分行李哩。跟着你做了这几年和尚，不成空着手回去？你把那包袱里的甚么旧褊衫，破帽子，分两件与他罢。”行者闻言，气得暴跳道：“我把你这个尖嘴的夯货！老孙一向秉教沙门，更无一毫嫉妒之意，贪恋之心，怎么要分甚么行李？”唐僧道：“你既不嫉妒贪恋，如何不去？”行者道：“实不瞒师父说，老孙五百年前，居花果山水帘洞大展英雄之际，收降七十二洞邪魔，手下有四万七千群怪，头戴的是紫金冠，身穿的是赭黄袍，腰系的是蓝田带，足踏的是步云履，手执的是如意金箍棒，着实也曾为人。自从涅槃罪度，削发秉正沙门，跟你做了徒弟，把这个金箍儿勒在我头上，若回去，却也难见故乡人。师父果若不要我，把那个《松箍儿咒》念一念，退下这个箍子，交付与你，套在别人头上，我就快活相应了，也是跟你一场。莫不成这些人意儿也没有了？”唐僧大惊道：“悟空，我当时只是菩萨暗受一卷《紧箍儿咒》，却没有甚么松箍儿咒。”行者道：“若无《松箍儿咒》，你还带我去走走罢。”长老又没奈何道：“你且起来，我再饶你这一次，却不可再行凶了。”行者道：“再不敢了，再不敢了。”又伏侍师父上马，剖路前进。</p>

<p>却说那妖精，原来行者第二棍也不曾打杀他。那怪物在半空中，夸奖不尽道：“好个猴王，着然有眼！我那般变了去，他也还认得我。这些和尚，他去得快，若过此山，西下四十里，就不伏我所管了。若是被别处妖魔捞了去，好道就笑破他人口，使碎自家心，我还下去戏他一戏。”好妖怪，按耸阴风，在山坡下摇身一变，变成一个老公公，真个是：白发如彭祖，苍髯赛寿星，耳中鸣玉磬，眼里幌金星。手拄龙头拐，身穿鹤氅轻。数珠掐在手，口诵南无经。唐僧在马上见了，心中欢喜道：“阿弥陀佛！西方真是福地！那公公路也走不上来，逼法的还念经哩。”</p>

<p>八戒道：“师父，你且莫要夸奖，那个是祸的根哩。”唐僧道：“怎么是祸根？”八戒道：“行者打杀他的女儿，又打杀他的婆子，这个正是他的老儿寻将来了。我们若撞在他的怀里呵，师父，你便偿命，该个死罪；把老猪为从，问个充军；沙僧喝令，问个摆站；那行者使个遁法走了，却不苦了我们三个顶缸？”行者听见道：“这个呆根，这等胡说，可不唬了师父？等老孙再去看看。”</p>

<p>他把棍藏在身边，走上前迎着怪物，叫声：“老官儿，往那里去？</p>

<p>怎么又走路，又念经？”那妖精错认了定盘星，把孙大圣也当做个等闲的，遂答道：“长老啊，我老汉祖居此地，一生好善斋僧，看经念佛。命里无儿，止生得一个小女，招了个女婿，今早送饭下田，想是遭逢虎口。老妻先来找寻，也不见回去，全然不知下落，老汉特来寻看。果然是伤残他命，也没奈何，将他骸骨收拾回去，安葬茔中。”行者笑道：“我是个做吓虎的祖宗，你怎么袖子里笼了个鬼儿来哄我？你瞒了诸人，瞒不过我！我认得你是个妖精！”那妖精唬得顿口无言。行者掣出棒来，自忖思道：“若要不打他，显得他倒弄个风儿；若要打他，又怕师父念那话儿咒语。”又思量道：“不打杀他，他一时间抄空儿把师父捞了去，却不又费心劳力去救他？还打的是！就一棍子打杀他，师父念起那咒，常言道，虎毒不吃儿。凭着我巧言花语，嘴伶舌便，哄他一哄，好道也罢了。”好大圣，念动咒语叫当坊土地、本处山神道：“这妖精三番来戏弄我师父，这一番却要打杀他。你与我在半空中作证，不许走了。”众神听令，谁敢不从？都在云端里照应。那大圣棍起处，打倒妖魔，才断绝了灵光。</p>

<p>那唐僧在马上，又唬得战战兢兢，口不能言。八戒在旁边又笑道：“好行者！风发了！只行了半日路，倒打死三个人！”唐僧正要念咒，行者急到马前，叫道：“师父，莫念！莫念！你且来看看他的模样。”却是一堆粉骷髅在那里。唐僧大惊道：“悟空，这个人才死了，怎么就化作一堆骷髅？”行者道：“他是个潜灵作怪的僵尸，在此迷人败本，被我打杀，他就现了本相。他那脊梁上有一行字，叫做白骨夫人。”唐僧闻说，倒也信了，怎禁那八戒旁边唆嘴道：“师父，他的手重棍凶，把人打死，只怕你念那话儿，故意变化这个模样，掩你的眼目哩！”唐僧果然耳软，又信了他，随复念起。行者禁不得疼痛，跪于路旁，只叫：“莫念！莫念！有话快说了罢！”唐僧道：“猴头！还有甚说话！出家人行善，如春园之草，不见其长，日有所增；行恶之人，如磨刀之石，不见其损，日有所亏。你在这荒郊野外，一连打死三人，还是无人检举，没有对头；倘到城市之中，人烟凑集之所，你拿了那哭丧棒，一时不知好歹，乱打起人来，撞出大祸，教我怎的脱身？你回去罢！”行者道：“师父错怪了我也。这厮分明是个妖魔，他实有心害你。我倒打死他，替你除了害，你却不认得，反信了那呆子谗言冷语，屡次逐我。常言道，事不过三。我若不去，真是个下流无耻之徒。我去我去！去便去了，只是你手下无人。”唐僧发怒道：“这泼猴越发无礼！看起来，只你是人，那悟能、悟净就不是人？”那大圣一闻得说他两个是人，止不住伤情凄惨，对唐僧道声：“苦啊！你那时节，出了长安，有刘伯钦送你上路；到两界山，救我出来，投拜你为师，我曾穿古洞，入深林，擒魔捉怪，收八戒，得沙僧，吃尽千辛万苦。今日昧着惺惺使糊涂，只教我回去：这才是鸟尽弓藏，兔死狗烹！罢罢罢！但只是多了那《紧箍儿咒》。”唐僧道：“我再不念了。”行者道：“这个难说。若到那毒魔苦难处不得脱身，八戒沙僧救不得你，那时节，想起我来，忍不住又念诵起来，就是十万里路，我的头也是疼的；假如再来见你，不如不作此意。”唐僧见他言言语语，越添恼怒，滚鞍下马来，叫沙僧包袱内取出纸笔，即于涧下取水，石上磨墨，写了一纸贬书，递于行者道：“猴头！执此为照，再不要你做徒弟了！如再与你相见，我就堕了阿鼻地狱！”</p>

<p>行者连忙接了贬书道：“师父，不消发誓，老孙去罢。”他将书摺了，留在袖中，却又软款唐僧道：“师父，我也是跟你一场，又蒙菩萨指教，今日半途而废，不曾成得功果，你请坐，受我一拜，我也去得放心。”唐僧转回身不睬，口里唧唧哝哝的道：“我是个好和尚，不受你歹人的礼！”大圣见他不睬，又使个身外法，把脑后毫毛拔了三根，吹口仙气，叫“变！”即变了三个行者，连本身四个，四面围住师父下拜。那长老左右躲不脱，好道也受了一拜。</p>

<p>大圣跳起来，把身一抖，收上毫毛，却又吩咐沙僧道：“贤弟，你是个好人，却只要留心防着八戒言语，途中更要仔细。倘一时有妖精拿住师父，你就说老孙是他大徒弟。西方毛怪，闻我的手段，不敢伤我师父。”唐僧道：“我是个好和尚，不题你这歹人的名字，你回去罢。”那大圣见长老三番两复，不肯转意回心，没奈何才去。你看他：噙泪叩头辞长老，含悲留意嘱沙僧。</p>

<p>一头拭迸坡前草，两脚蹬翻地上藤。上天下地如轮转，跨海飞山第一能。顷刻之间不见影，霎时疾返旧途程。你看他忍气别了师父，纵筋斗云，径回花果山水帘洞去了。独自个凄凄惨惨，忽闻得水声聒耳，大圣在那半空里看时，原来是东洋大海潮发的声响。一见了，又想起唐僧，止不住腮边泪坠，停云住步，良久方去。毕竟不知此去反复何如，且听下回分解。</p>
