<P>Feelings Run Wild and Nature Gets Loose Because of Desire</P>
<P>In Confusion of Spirit the Heart Is Disturbed and the Demon Encountered</P>
</div>
<P>The poem goes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The heart must be frequently swept,</P>
<P>The dust of emotions removed,</P>
<P>Lest the Buddha be trapped in the pit.</P>
<P>Only when the essence is pure</P>
<P>Can the origin then be discussed.</P>
<P>Trim the candle of nature,</P>
<P>Breathe in the way that Master Caoxi taught,</P>
<P>Control the ape and horse of the mind.</P>
<P>Only when breath is calm by day and night</P>
<P>Can one achieve the true adept's skill.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This poem is set to the tune<I> Nan Ke Zi</I> and it tells how the Tang Priest escaped disaster under the ice of the River of Heaven and crossed to the other bank on the shell of the white turtle. As the four pilgrims headed West it was now the depths of winter, but the mists in the forests were still light, and the bony shapes of the mountains could be seen rising in their purity above the waters. As master and disciples carried on along their way, they were obstructed by a big mountain. The road was rocky, and they and the horse found the going rough. Sanzang reined the horse in and called for his disciples.</P>
<P>Monkey led Pig and Friar Sand forward to stand in attendance and asked, &#8220;Master, what are your instructions?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You can see how high the mountain in front of us is,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;I am worried that there may be tigers, wolves, monsters and demon beasts who will kill us. You must be very careful.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry, Master,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;We three brothers have got on very well together since we were converted to the pursuit of the truth. With our magic powers to put down demons and monsters we've got nothing to fear from tigers, wolves or demons.&#8221; This greatly reassured Sanzang, who pressed ahead. When he reached the mouth of a gully and urged the horse up the slope he raised his head and saw that it was a splendid mountain:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Towering crags,</P>
<P>A steep and lofty range.</P>
<P>Towering crags pierced the heavens,</P>
<P>The steep and lofty range blocked out the azure shy.</P>
<P>Grotesque rocks were piled like sitting tigers,</P>
<P>Twisted, slanting pines seemed to fly like dragons,</P>
<P>Beautifully sang the birds on the ridge,</P>
<P>Heavy hung the scent of plum blossom by the scar.</P>
<P>Cold was the sluggish flow of the stream,</P>
<P>And menacing hung the dark clouds over the peak.</P>
<P>They saw whirling snow,</P>
<P>And an icy wind</P>
<P>Howling with the roar of hungry mountain tigers.</P>
<P>Cold rooks could find no perches in the trees</P>
<P>And wild deer did not know the way back home.</P>
<P>Hard it was indeed for the traveler to make progress</P>
<P>As he frowned with worry and covered up his head.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The four of them were trembling in the cold and the snow as they crossed that high ridge and saw in a distant hollow high towers and elegant houses. &#8220;Disciples,&#8221; said a relieved Sanzang from the back of his horse, &#8220;we have gone cold and hungry today, but there are many buildings in that hollow that I an sure must be a farm or a Buddhist or Taoist monastery. Let us go there and beg some food before we continue on our way.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey's immediate response was to take a good look. He saw that evil-looking clouds and vapors hung over the place, so he turned back to the Tang Priest and said, &#8220;Master, that's a bad place.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How could it possibly be a bad place with all those towers, pavilions and fine buildings?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;You wouldn't know, Master,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;There are any number of evil spirits and monsters along this road to the West who are good at making buildings by magic. They can make anything from towers and houses to halls and pavilions, and all just as bait. As you know, one of the nine kinds of dragon is called the clam-dragon. Its breath comes out looking like fine buildings and pools. Clam-dragon buildings appear when there is a heavy mist over a great river. Birds flying by will perch on them for a rest. The clam-dragon eats everyone up, even if there are thousands of them. It's a really lethal trick. The atmosphere over there looks thoroughly vicious: whatever you do don't go there.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Even if I may not I am still very hungry indeed,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, Master, you really must be,&#8221; replied Monkey. &#8220;Would you like to dismount and sit on this level ground here while I go somewhere else to beg food for you?&#8221; Sanzang followed this suggestion.</P>
<P>While Pig held the halter Friar Sand put the luggage down, opened up one of the bundles, and took out a begging bowl that he handed to Monkey, who gave him these parting instructions as he took it: &#8220;Don't go any further. Guard the master and make sure he stays sitting here until I come back with some food. Then we can carry on West.&#8221;</P>
<P>Friar Sand promised to do so. Monkey then spoke to Sanzang again: &#8220;Master, this is a very dangerous place. Whatever you do you mustn't move away from here. I'm off now to beg for food.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No need to say any more,&#8221; replied Sanzang. &#8220;Be back as soon as you can. I shall wait for you here.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey turned and was about to go when he turned back to add, &#8220;Master, I know that you haven't the patience to sit still, but I'll make a spell to keep you safe here.&#8221; With that he took out his gold-banded cudgel and in a flash he drew a circle on the ground with it. He asked the Tang priest to sit in the circle with Pig and Friar Sand standing on either side and the horse and luggage nearby.</P>
<P>Then he put his palms together and said to the Tang Priest, &#8220;The circle I've drawn is stronger than a wall of bronze or iron. No tiger, leopard, wolf, demon, fiend or monster will dare come anywhere near it. But you must not step outside it. I guarantee that you'll come to no harm as long as you sit inside the circle; but once you leave it very nasty things will happen to you. Please, please, please stay inside it whatever happens.&#8221; Sanzang did as he was told and they all sat down. Only then did Monkey set off due South on his cloud to beg for some food. When he saw the ancient trees of another farmhouse reaching up to the sky he brought his cloud down for a closer look. This is what he saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Willows bent down by cruel snow,</P>
<P>A square pool frozen hard.</P>
<P>A few sparse bamboos waving green,</P>
<P>The turquoise of a lofty and elegant pine.</P>
<P>Thatched cottages that looked covered with silver,</P>
<P>A slanting bridge that seemed paved with flour.</P>
<P>Daffodils by the fence were beginning to open,</P>
<P>While icicles hung low beneath the eaves.</P>
<P>The icy wind carried many a strange fragrance;</P>
<P>The plum blossom was lost amid the driving snow.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As Monkey walked towards the farm to take a look at it he heard the creak of a wicker gate opening as an old man came out. He was leaning on a wooden stick and wearing a sheepskin hat, a tattered tunic, and rush sandals. He looked up to the sky and said. &#8220;The Northwest wind in blowing, so the sky will be clear tomorrow.&#8221; Before the words were out of his mouth a Pekinese dog came bounding out from behind him and started barking wildly at Monkey. Only then did the man turn to see Monkey carrying his begging bowl.</P>
<P>&#8220;Venerable benefactor,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;I'm with the monk sent to the Western Heaven by the emperor of Great Tang in the East to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures. As we were passing this way and my master is very hungry I have come to your honorable residence to beg for a vegetarian meal.&#8221;</P>
<P>The old man nodded, hit the ground with his stick and said, &#8220;Reverend sir, don't beg here. You've lost your way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No, I haven't,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;The main trail West is over three hundred miles North of here,&#8221; said the old man, &#8220;so why aren't you on that?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's where I've come from,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;My master is now sitting by the main trail waiting for me to bring him some food.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're talking nonsense, monk,&#8221; the old man replied. &#8220;How could your master be waiting by the main trail for you to bring him some food? Even if you could walk this far it would take you six or seven days to cover over three hundred miles and as long again to get back. By then he would have starved to death.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Honestly, benefactor,&#8221; replied Brother Monkey with a smile. &#8220;I have only just left my master, and it took me less time to get here than it would to drink a cup of tea. When I've been given the food I'll take it back for his lunch.&#8221;</P>
<P>This alarmed the old man, who drew back at once, saying, &#8220;That monk's a demon, a demon.&#8221;</P>
<P>He was just about to go back inside when Monkey took hold of him and asked, &#8220;Where are you going, benefactor? Give me some food at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's very difficult,&#8221; the old man said, &#8220;very difficult. Try somewhere else.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You really don't understand, benefactor,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Just think, I've had to come over three hundred miles to get here, so it would probably be another three hundred miles to another house. You're trying to make my master starve to death.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I tell you frankly,&#8221; the old man said, &#8220;that we can only put three pints of rice in the pot for the six or seven members of the family, and it's still cooking. Try somewhere else first.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There is an old saying,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;that it's better to stay in one house than to call on three. I'm staying put.&#8221; The old man lost his temper with Monkey for being so persistent and raised his stick to hit him. This did not worry Monkey at all, who allowed the old man to hit him on his shaven pate seven or eight times: it felt like having the itches on his head scratched.</P>
<P>&#8220;You're a monk who likes being hit on the head,&#8221; said the old man.</P>
<P>&#8220;Hit me as much as you like, oldy,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'm keeping the score and you'll have to give me a pint of rice for every blow.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the old man heard this he dropped his stick, rushed inside, shut the gate and shouted: &#8220;A demon, a demon.&#8221; This made the whole household shake with fear as they shut the front and back gates in a great hurry. Watching the gates being shut Monkey thought, &#8220;I wonder if the old villain was telling the truth about the amount of rice they cook. As the saying goes, the good are converted by Taoism and the stupid by Buddhism. I'm going in to take a look round.&#8221; With that the splendid Great Sage made a spell with his hands to make himself invisible and went straight to the kitchen to look. He saw that the pot was steaming and half filled with grain, so he thrust his begging bowl into it, filled it to the brim, and went back on his cloud.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Tang priest meanwhile, who had been sitting in the circle for a long time waiting for Monkey to come back, stretched, looked around and said, &#8220;Where has that ape gone to beg for food?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Goodness only knows where he is&#8212;probably fooling around,&#8221; said Pig with a laugh beside him. &#8220;Begging for food, indeed! He's left us here in a pen.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean, in a pen?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;That's something else you wouldn't know, Master,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;In the old days people used to draw circles on the ground to make pens. He draws a circle with his cudgel and says it's stronger than a wall of bronze or iron. But how could it possibly keep out any tigers, wolves or evil monsters that came here? We'd be a meal served up to them on a plate.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What should we do about it, Wuneng?&#8221; Sanzang asked him.</P>
<P>&#8220;We're not sheltered from the wind or the cold here,&#8221; Pig said. &#8220;If you ask me we should carry on West along the trail. Monkey went off begging on his cloud, so he's bound to be back soon. He'll catch up with us. If he's got any food we can eat it before going on. All we've got from sitting here so long is cold feet.&#8221;</P>
<P>These words were to be Sanzang's undoing: he followed the idiot's advice and they all left the circle. The Tang Priest walked along the trail with Pig leading the horse and Friar Sand carrying the luggage. They soon reached the house with high towers, which was a South-facing compound. Outside the gates was a whitewashed wall, above which rose a multicolored gatetower shaped like lotuses leaning together. The gates stood half open. While Pig tethered the horse to a stone drum by the threshold Friar Sand put the luggage down and Sanzang sat on the doorsill out of the wind.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said pig, &#8220;this looks like a nobleman or a minister's house. There's nobody at the gates, so I suppose they're all inside warming themselves up by the fire. Sit down and let me take a look.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do be careful,&#8221; said the Tang Priest. &#8220;Don't go charging into their house.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said the idiot. &#8220;I'm a lot better mannered now I'm a Buddhist. I'm not a village yokel any more.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot tucked his rake in his belt, straightened his black brocade tunic, and went in through the gate in a very affected way. He saw a large hall with high, curtained windows that was completely quiet and deserted. There were no tables, chairs or other furniture. When he went round the screen and further into the house he found himself in a passageway at the end of which stood a multi-storied building with upstairs windows half open through which yellow damask bed-curtains could be glimpsed. &#8220;I suppose they're still in bed because it's so cold,&#8221; thought Pig, whereupon he marched up the stairs without worrying about the propriety of invading the private quarters of the house. When the idiot lifted the curtain and looked inside he almost collapsed with shock: on the ivory bed inside the curtains was a pile of gleaming white bones, with a skull the size of a bushel measure and thighbones some four or five feet long.</P>
<P>When the idiot calmed himself the tears poured down his cheeks as he nodded to the skeletons and said with a sigh, &#8220;I wonder:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>For what great dynasty you once were a marshal</P>
<P>In what country's service did you hold high command?</P>
<P>Then you were a hero fighting for mastery,</P>
<P>But now you are only a pile of old bones.</P>
<P>Where are the widow and child making offerings?</P>
<P>Do no soldiers burn incense to honour your memory?</P>
<P>The sight is enough to make one sigh deeply:</P>
<P>Alas for the man who once was a conqueror.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As pig was sighing with grief there was a flicker of fire behind the curtain, &#8220;I suppose there must be attendants at the back to offer him incense,&#8221; the idiot thought. When he rushed round the bed-curtain to look he saw that it was the daylight shining through the windows, beside which stood a coloured lacquer table. On it were thrown some padded clothes in brocade and embroidery. When the idiot picked them up to look at them he saw that they were three quilted brocade waistcoats. Not worrying about whether it was right to do so the idiot took them downstairs and went out through the main hall and the gates.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;there's no sign of life here&#8212;it's a house of the dead. I went inside and went upstairs, where I found a pile of bones behind a yellow bed-curtain. On one side of the upper floor were three quilted brocade waistcoats, look&#8212;I've brought them back with me. We're really in luck as they're just what we need now that the weather has turned cold. Take your habit off, Master, and put one of these on underneath. You'll be a lot more comfortable: it'll keep the cold out.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;it's forbidden. The law says, 'Taking, whether openly or in secret, is always theft.' If anyone found out, came after us and handed us over to the authorities we would definitely be found guilty of theft. You had better take them back in and put them where you found them. We shall just sit here for a while to shelter from the wind and carry on along our way as soon as Wukong is back. Monks should not be looking out for easy pickings like that.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But there's nobody around who could know,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;not even a chicken or a dog. The only people who know are ourselves. Who's going to sue us? There's no evidence. It's just the same as if we'd picked it up. Taking or stealing just doesn't come into it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; said the Tang Priest. &#8220;Even if nobody else knew about it Heaven cannot be fooled. As the Lord of Origin teaches us, 'Do no evil in a dark house: the eyes of the gods are like lightning.' Take it back at once and stop hankering after what you have no right to.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot was having none of this. &#8220;Master,&#8221; he said to the Tang Priest with a grin, &#8220;I've worn several waistcoats in my life, but never have I seen quilted brocade ones like this before. Even if you don't want to wear one, please let me just try one on to warm my back up. When Monkey comes back I'll take it off and we can be on our way again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that cast,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;I'd like to try one too.&#8221; The two of them took off their outer tunics and put the waistcoats on instead. As soon as they had tightened the belts they collapsed, unable to stay on their feet. The waistcoats were even worse than bonds. In an instant both of them had their hands tied together behind their backs. Sanzang stamped his foot in despair and indignation and rushed forward to untie them, but to no avail. The three of them set up endless yells that soon disturbed a demon king.</P>
<P>Now these buildings had indeed been created by the magic of an evil spirit who spent all his life lying in wait there to catch people. Hearing the howls of anger as he sat in his cave he rushed out to find that he had several victims tied up. The monster called for his little demons to go there with him as he made all the enchanted buildings vanish. They returned to the cave holding the Tang Priest, leading the horse, and dragging Pig and Friar Sand. The old demon took his seat on his throne while the little devils pushed Sanzang to the foot of the steps and forced him to kneel on the floor.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you from, monk,&#8221; the demon asked, &#8220;and how can you have the effrontery to steal my clothes in broad daylight?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have been sent to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven by the emperor of Great Tang in the East,&#8221; replied Sanzang. &#8220;As I was hungry I sent my senior disciple to beg for food. He has not come back yet, and it was because I ignored his good advice that I blundered into your immortal hall to shelter from the wind, never imagining that my disciples would be so grasping as to steal your clothes. As I have no such wicked thoughts I told them to take the clothes straight back, but they paid no attention and insisted on putting them on to warm their backs. Never did I imagine that we would fall into Your Majesty's trap and be captured. I beg you in your mercy to spare our lives so that we can fetch the scriptures. We will be eternally indebted to Your Majesty and your praises will be sung for ever after we return to the East.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But I'm always hearing people say that if you eat the flesh of the Tang Priest, white hair can be turned black, and teeth that have fallen out will grow again,&#8221; said the demon with a grin. &#8220;You've come along today without even having been asked, and now you expect me to spare you! What's your senior disciple called, and where has he gone begging?&#8221;</P>
<P>This question started Pig bragging: &#8220;My elder brother is Sun Wukong, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven who made havoc in Heaven five hundred years ago.&#8221;</P>
<P>This news shocked the demon speechless. &#8220;I've long heard of that damned ape's enormous powers,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;and now I'm meeting him when I least expected to. Little ones,&#8221; he ordered, &#8220;tie the Tang Priest up, take my precious coats off the other two, and fetch a couple of ropes to bind them. Take them to the back, and when I've caught the senior disciple we can scrub them all clean, put them in the steamer and cook them.&#8221; The little demons acknowledged his orders then bound the three of them together and carried them to the back. They tethered the white horse by the trough, took the luggage indoors, and sharpened their weapons ready to capture Monkey.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey, meanwhile, who had filled his begging bowl with rice in the farmhouse to the South, rode his cloud back and landed it on a stretch of level ground on the mountainside to find the Tang Priest gone he knew not where. The circle he had drawn with his cudgel was still there, but travelers and horse had disappeared. When he looked towards where the buildings had been they had vanished too: all that could be seen were mountains and grotesquely shaped rocks.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't tell me!&#8221; he thought with horror. &#8220;They've been caught.&#8221; He rushed after them, following the horse's prints Westwards.</P>
<P>About two miles later, when he was feeling thoroughly gloomy, he heard voices on the other side of the slope to the North of him. When he looked he saw an old man in felt clothes, a warm hat and a pair of worn oiled cloth boots holding a dragon-headed stick and followed by a slave boy. The old man had broken off a sprig of plum blossom and was singing a song as he came down the slope. Monkey put down his begging bowl and looked the old man in the face as he put his hands together and said, &#8220;Greetings, grandfather.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you from, reverend sir?&#8221; replied the old man, returning his bow.</P>
<P>&#8220;We are monks from the East going to the Western Heaven to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;There are four of us altogether, a master and three disciples. I went off to beg for some food as my master was hungry, so I told the other three to wait for me at a stretch of level ground on that mountainside. When I came back they had gone, and I don't know which way they went. May I ask you if you have seen them, grandfather?&#8221;</P>
<P>The question made the old man chortle. &#8220;Did one of the three have a long snout and big ears?&#8221; he asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes, yes,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;And was there another with an evil-looking mug leading a white horse, and a fat monk with a white face?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's right, that's right,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Then you've all lost your way,&#8221; said the old man. &#8220;Don't bother looking for them: It's every man for himself.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The white-faced one is my master and the funny-looking ones are my brother disciples,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;We're all set on going to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures. Of course I've got to look for them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When I came this way just now I saw that they had lost their way and were heading straight into the demon's mouth,&#8221; the old man said.</P>
<P>&#8220;I would be very grateful, grandfather,&#8221; replied Monkey, &#8220;if you could tell me which demon it is and where he lives. I want to call on him and ask for them back so that we can go on with our journey to the Western Heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This mountain is called Mount Jindou and there is a Jindou Cave in front of it,&#8221; the old man replied. &#8220;In the cave lives the Great King Rhinoceros. His magic abilities are enormous and he is very powerful. All three of your people must be dead by now. If you go looking for them you might not even be able to keep yourself alive. The best thing would be not to go there. I won't try to stop you or to keep you here&#8212;I simply leave you to think it over.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey bowed again to thank the old man and said, &#8220;Thank you, venerable sir, for your advice. But I have to search for them.&#8221; Tipping the rice out and giving it to the old man he put his begging bowl away, at which the old man put down his stick to accept the bowl, which he handed to his slave.</P>
<P>Then they both resumed their normal form, fell to their knees, and kowtowed saying, &#8220;Great Sage, we dare not try to deceive you. We two are the mountain deity and local god of this place, and we've been waiting here to receive you, Great Sage. We'll look after the rice and your begging bowl to make it easier for you to use your magic powers. When you've rescued the Tang Priest you can do your duty to him by giving him the food.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Hairy devils,&#8221; shouted Monkey, &#8220;you deserve a flogging. If you knew I was here why didn't you meet me earlier, instead of skulking around in disguise? It's a disgrace!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Because you have such a quick temper, Great Sage, we did not want to rush in and offend you,&#8221; the local god replied. &#8220;That was why we disguised ourselves to tell you all that.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;we'll postpone that beating. Look after my bowl while I capture that evil spirit.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Great Sage then tightened his belt of tiger sinew, hitched up his tigerskin kilt, took his gold-banded cudgel in his hands, and headed straight for the mountain in search of the cave. As he rounded a sheer wall he saw a pair of stone doors set among rocks beside the blue-green rock-face. Outside the doors a crowd of little devils were practicing with sword and spear. Indeed, there were,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Auspicious clouds,</P>
<P>Green lichens,</P>
<P>Rows of strange and craggy rocks,</P>
<P>Steep paths winding around.</P>
<P>Apes howled and birds sang in the beauty of nature;</P>
<P>Phoenixes flew and danced in this land of immortals.</P>
<P>The first blooms were open on plum trees facing South;</P>
<P>A thousand bamboos were green in the sun's warmth.</P>
<P>Under the cliff,</P>
<P>Deep in the gorge:</P>
<P>Under the cliff the snow was piled up white;</P>
<P>Deep in the gorge the stream had turned to ice.</P>
<P>Stands of cypress and pine preserved ancient beauty;</P>
<P>Camellia bushes all bloomed with the same red.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Without waiting to have a thorough look the Great Sage made straight for the doors and shouted at the top of his voice, &#8220;Little devils, go straight in and tell your master that I'm Sun Wukong, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven and the disciple of the holy Tang Priest, Tell him to send my master out at once if you lot don't all want to be killed.&#8221;</P>
<P>The little devils all hurried in to report, &#8220;Your Majesty, there's a monk at the gate with a hairy face and a crooked mouth. He's called the Great Sage Equaling Heaven Sun Wukong and he's asking for his master back.&#8221;</P>
<P>The demon was delighted to hear this. &#8220;Just the person I wanted to come,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Ever since leaving my palace and coming down to the mortal world I've had no chance to try out my martial skills. Now that he's here I'll have a worthy foe. Bring me my weapons, little ones,&#8221; he ordered. All the big and little devils in the cave braced themselves and carried out as quickly as they could a twelve-foot-long steel spear that they handed to the old demon, who gave them their instructions: &#8220;Little ones, you must keep in neat formation. Those who advance will be rewarded, and anyone who retreats will be executed.&#8221;</P>
<P>Having been given their orders the little devils charged out through the doors behind the old demon, who shouted, &#8220;Who is Sun Wukong?&#8221; Monkey stepped across from beside the entrance to see how ugly and murderous the demon king looked:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A single jagged horn,</P>
<P>A pair of bright eyes.</P>
<P>The thick skin protruded above his head,</P>
<P>Black flesh shone by his ears.</P>
<P>When he stretched his tongue he could lick his snout;</P>
<P>His mouth when opened wide showed yellow teeth.</P>
<P>His hair was indigo-blue,</P>
<P>His muscles hard as steel.</P>
<P>He was like a rhinoceros, but could not see through water,</P>
<P>Resembled a buffalo but could not plough.</P>
<P>Not useful like the ox who lows at the moon,</P>
<P>He could easily scare the sky and shake the earth.</P>
<P>His purple hands were knotted with muscle,</P>
<P>As he stood erect with his spear of steel.</P>
<P>One only had to consider his hideous looks</P>
<P>To see why he deserved to be called Rhinoceros King.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your grandpa Monkey is here,&#8221; said the Great Sage Monkey, stepping forward. &#8220;Give me back my master and neither of us will be hurt. But if there's so much as half a 'no' from you I'll kill you, and there'll be nowhere to bury your remains.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll get you, you impudent devil of an ape,&#8221; the demon roared back. &#8220;What powers do you have that give you the nerve to talk like that?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Evidently you've not seen them yet,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your master stole my clothes,&#8221; said the demon, &#8220;and now I've caught him and am going to cook and eat him. What sort of tough guy do you think you are, daring to come here to ask for him back?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My master is a loyal, upright and good monk: he couldn't possibly have stolen any of your devilish goods,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;I made a magic villa by the mountain path,&#8221; the demon said, &#8220;and your master crept inside. He was so carried away by his greed that he stole three quilted brocade waistcoats. I caught him red-handed. If you really have any powers I'll give you a fight. Hold out against me for three rounds and I'll spare your master's life; fail and you go to the underworld with him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Shut up, damned beast,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;A fight would suit me fine. Come here and try a taste of my cudgel.&#8221; The monster was not at all afraid to fight, and he thrust his spear at Monkey's head, It was a superb battle. Just watch:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The gold-banded cudgel was raised,</P>
<P>The long-handled spear parried.</P>
<P>The gold-banded cudgel was raised,</P>
<P>Flashing like a golden snake of lightning.</P>
<P>The long-handled spear parried,</P>
<P>Glistening like a dragon emerging from the sea.</P>
<P>Outside the doors the little devils beat their drums,</P>
<P>Drawn up in battle order to add to his might,</P>
<P>While the Great Sage showed his skill,</P>
<P>Displaying his abilities freely all around.</P>
<P>On one side a spear and spirits braced,</P>
<P>Against it a cudgel and martial prowess.</P>
<P>Indeed it was hero set against hero,</P>
<P>A pair of well-matched foes.</P>
<P>The demon king breathed out coiling purple mists</P>
<P>While the gleam of the Great Sage's eyes formed coloured clouds</P>
<P>Only because the Tang Priest was in trouble</P>
<P>Did both of them fight so bitterly without quarter.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After thirty inconclusive rounds the demon king could see that Sun Wukong was a complete master of the cudgel who could advance or retreat without leaving any openings. &#8220;What a splendid ape,&#8221; he kept saying with admiration, &#8220;what a splendid ape. This was the skill that made havoc in Heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey too was impressed by the demon king's neat spearwork as he parried to left and right with great skill. &#8220;What a splendid spirit,&#8221; he said, &#8220;what a splendid spirit. He really is a demon who would know how to steal elixir pills.&#8221; The two of them then fought another ten or twenty rounds.</P>
<P>The demon king touched the ground with the tip of his spear and ordered his little devils forward. All those wretched fiends surrounded the Great Sage with their cutlasses, staves, swords and spears. Monkey was completely unafraid.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm glad you've come along,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;glad you've come along. Just what I wanted.&#8221; With his gold-banded cudgel he blocked and parried them in front and behind and to both sides, but the devils would not give ground. Losing his patience, Monkey threw his cudgel into the air, shouted, &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned it into over a thousand cudgels that came raining down from the sky like flying snakes, terrifying the devils out of their wits and sending them scurrying back to their cave for their lives with their hands over their heads.</P>
<P>&#8220;Behave yourself, ape,&#8221; said the demon with a mocking laugh, &#8220;and watch this trick.&#8221; He immediately pulled out from his sleeve a gleaming white ring that he threw up into the air with a shout of &#8220;Get them!&#8221; It came whirling down, catching all the gold-banded cudgels inside it, and forcing Monkey to somersault away for his life as he was now disarmed. While the demon king returned to his cave in triumph Brother Monkey was at his wit's end. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Way grew by one foot but the demon grew by ten.</P>
<P>Blind and confused, they failed to see that the house was fake.</P>
<P>Alas there was no place to be found for the dharma body:</P>
<P>In action and in thoughts they had made a great mistake.</P>
<I>
<P>

<P>If you don't know how all this ended, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>情乱性从因爱欲</p>
<p>神昏心动遇魔头</p>
</div>
<p>词曰：心地频频扫，尘情细细除，莫教坑堑陷毗卢。本体常清净，方可论元初。性烛须挑剔，曹溪任吸呼，勿令猿马气声粗。昼夜绵绵息，方显是功夫。这一首词，牌名《南柯子》。单道着唐僧脱却通天河寒冰之灾，踏白鼋负登彼岸。四众奔西，正遇严冬之景，但见那林光漠漠烟中淡，山骨棱棱水外清。师徒们正当行处，忽然又遇一座大山，阻住去道，路窄崖高，石多岭峻，人马难行。三藏在马上兜住缰绳，叫声“徒弟。”那孙行者引八戒、沙僧近前侍立道：“师父，有何吩咐？”三藏道：“你看那前面山高，只恐有虎狼作怪，妖兽伤人，今番是必仔细！”行者道：“师父放心莫虑，我等兄弟三人，性和意合，归正求真，使出荡怪降妖之法，怕甚么虎狼妖兽！”三藏闻言，只得放怀前进，到于谷口，促马登崖，抬头观看，好山：嵯峨矗矗，峦削巍巍。嵯峨矗矗冲霄汉，峦削巍巍碍碧空。怪石乱堆如坐虎，苍松斜挂似飞龙。岭上鸟啼娇韵美，崖前梅放异香浓。涧水潺湲流出冷，巅云黯淡过来凶。又见那飘飘雪，凛凛风，咆哮饿虎吼山中。寒鸦拣树无栖处，野鹿寻窝没定踪。可叹行人难进步，皱眉愁脸把头蒙。</p>

<p>师徒四众，冒雪冲寒，战澌澌，行过那巅峰峻岭，远望见山凹中有楼台高耸，房舍清幽。唐僧马上欣然道：“徒弟啊，这一日又饥又寒，幸得那山凹里有楼台房舍，断乎是庄户人家，庵观寺院，且去化些斋饭，吃了再走。”行者闻言，急睁睛看，只见那壁厢凶云隐隐，恶气纷纷，回首对唐僧道：“师父，那厢不是好处。”三藏道：“见有楼台亭宇，如何不是好处？”行者笑道：</p>

<p>“师父啊，你那里知道？西方路上多有妖怪邪魔，善能点化庄宅，不拘甚么楼台房舍，馆阁亭宇，俱能指化了哄人。你知道龙生九种，内有一种名‘蜃’，蜃气放出，就如楼阁浅池。若遇大江昏迷，蜃现此势，倘有鸟鹊飞腾，定来歇翅，那怕你上万论千，尽被他一气吞之。此意害人最重，那壁厢气色凶恶，断不可入。”三藏道：“既不可入，我却着实饥了。”行者道：“师父果饥，且请下马，就在这平处坐下，待我别处化些斋来你吃。”三藏依言下马。八戒采定缰绳，沙僧放下行李，即去解开包裹，取出钵盂，递与行者。行者接钵盂在手，吩咐沙僧道：“贤弟，却不可前进，好生保护师父稳坐于此，待我化斋回来，再往西去。”沙僧领诺。行者又向三藏道：“师父，这去处少吉多凶，切莫要动身别往，老孙化斋去也。”唐僧道：“不必多言，但要你快去快来，我在这里等你。”行者转身欲行，却又回来道：“师父，我知你没甚坐性，我与你个安身法儿。”即取金箍棒，幌了一幌，将那平地下周围画了一道圈子，请唐僧坐在中间，着八戒沙僧侍立左右，把马与行李都放在近身，对唐僧合掌道：“老孙画的这圈，强似那铜墙铁壁，凭他甚么虎豹狼虫，妖魔鬼怪，俱莫敢近。但只不许你们走出圈外，只在中间稳坐，保你无虞；但若出了圈儿，定遭毒手。千万千万！至嘱至嘱！”三藏依言，师徒俱端然坐下。</p>

<p>行者才起云头，寻庄化斋，一直南行，忽见那古树参天，乃一村庄舍。按下云头，仔细观看，但只见：雪欺衰柳，冰结方塘。</p>

<p>疏疏修竹摇青，郁郁乔松凝翠。几间茅屋半装银，一座小桥斜砌粉。篱边微吐水仙花，檐下长垂冰冻箸。飒飒寒风送异香，雪漫不见梅开处。行者随步观看庄景，只听得呀的一声，柴扉响处，走出一个老者，手拖藜杖，头顶羊裘，身穿破衲，足踏蒲鞋，拄着杖，仰身朝天道：“西北风起，明日晴了。”说不了，后边跑出一个哈巴狗儿来，望着行者，汪汪的乱吠。老者却才转过头来，看见行者捧着钵盂，打个问讯道：“老施主，我和尚是东土大唐钦差上西天拜佛求经者，适路过宝方，我师父腹中饥馁，特造尊府募化一斋。”老者闻言，点头顿杖道：“长老，你且休化斋，你走错路了。”行者道：“不错。”老者道：“往西天大路，在那直北下，此间到那里有千里之遥，还不去找大路而行？”行者笑道：“正是直北下，我师父现在大路上端坐，等我化斋哩。”</p>

<p>那老者道：“这和尚胡说了。你师父在大路上等你化斋，似这千里之遥，就会走路，也须得六七日，走回去又要六七日，却不饿坏他也？”行者笑道：“不瞒老施主说，我才然离了师父，还不上一盏热茶之时，却就走到此处。如今化了斋，还要趁去作午斋哩。”老者见说，心中害怕道：“这和尚是鬼！是鬼！”急抽身往里就走。行者一把扯住道：“施主那里去？有斋快化些儿。”老者道：“不方便！不方便！别转一家儿罢！”行者道：“你这施主，好不会事！你说我离此有千里之遥，若再转一家，却不又有千里？</p>

<p>真是饿杀我师父也。”那老者道：“实不瞒你说，我家老小六七口，才淘了三升米下锅，还未曾煮熟。你且到别处去转转再来。”行者道：“古人云，走三家不如坐一家。我贫僧在此等一等罢。”那老者见缠得紧，恼了，举藜杖就打。行者公然不惧，被他照光头上打了七八下，只当与他拂痒。那老者道：“这是个撞头的和尚！”行者笑道：“老官儿，凭你怎么打，只要记得杖数明白，一杖一升米，慢慢量来。”那老者闻言，急丢了藜杖，跑进去把门关了，只嚷：“有鬼！有鬼！”慌得那一家儿战战兢兢，把前后门俱关上。行者见他关了门，心中暗想：“这老贼才说淘米下锅，不知是虚是实。常言道，道化贤良释化愚。且等老孙进去看看。”好大圣，捻着诀，使个隐身遁法，径走入厨中看处，果然那锅里气腾腾的，煮了半锅干饭。就把钵盂往里一桠，满满的桠了一钵盂，即驾云回转不题。</p>

<p>却说唐僧坐在圈子里，等待多时。不见行者回来，欠身怅望道：“这猴子往那里化斋去了？”八戒在旁笑道：“知他往那里耍子去来！化甚么斋，却教我们在此坐牢！”三藏道：“怎么谓之坐牢？”八戒道：“师父，你原来不知。古人划地为牢，他将棍子划了圈儿，强似铁壁铜墙，假如有虎狼妖兽来时，如何挡得他住？只好白白的送与他吃罢子。”三藏道：“悟能，凭你怎么处治？”八戒道：“此间又不藏风，又不避冷，若依老猪，只该顺着路，往西且行。师兄化了斋，驾了云，必然来快，让他赶来。如有斋，吃了再走。如今坐了这一会，老大脚冷！”三藏闻此言，就是晦气星进宫，遂依呆子，一齐出了圈外。沙僧牵了马，八戒担了担，那长老顺路步行前进，不一时，到了那楼阁之所，原来是坐北向南之家。门外八字粉墙，有一座倒垂莲升斗门楼，都是五色装的，那门儿半开半掩。八戒就把马拴在门枕石鼓上，沙僧歇了担子，三藏畏风，坐于门限之上。八戒道：“师父，这所在想是公侯之宅，相辅之家。前门外无人，想必都在里面烘火。你们坐着，让我进去看看。”唐僧道：“仔细耶！莫要冲撞了人家。”</p>

<p>呆子道：“我晓得，自从归正禅门，这一向也学了些礼数，不比那村莽之夫也。”</p>

<p>那呆子把钉钯撒在腰里，整一整青锦直裰，斯斯文文，走入门里，只见是三间大厅，帘栊高控，静悄悄全无人迹，也无桌椅家火。转过屏门，往里又走，乃是一座穿堂，堂后有一座大楼，楼上窗格半开，隐隐见一顶黄绫帐幔。呆子道：“想是有人怕冷，还睡哩。”他也不分内外，拽步走上楼来，用手掀开看时，把呆子唬了一个躘踵。原来那帐里象牙床上，白媸媸的一堆骸骨，骷髅有巴斗大，腿挺骨有四五尺长。呆子定了性，止不住腮边泪落，对骷髅点头叹云：“你不知是那代那朝元帅体，何邦何国大将军。当时豪杰争强胜，今日凄凉露骨筋。不见妻儿来侍奉，那逢士卒把香焚？谩观这等真堪叹，可惜兴王霸业人。”八戒正才感叹，只见那帐幔后有火光一幌。呆子道：“想是有侍奉香火之人在后面哩。”急转步过帐观看，却是穿楼的窗扇透光。</p>

<p>那壁厢有一张彩漆的桌子，桌子上乱搭着几件锦绣绵衣。呆子提起来看时，却是三件纳锦背心儿。他也不管好歹，拿下楼来，出厅房，径到门外道：“师父，这里全没人烟，是一所亡灵之宅。</p>

<p>老猪走进里面，直至高楼之上，黄绫帐内，有一堆骸骨。串楼旁有三件纳锦的背心，被我拿来了，也是我们一程儿造化，此时天气寒冷，正当用处。师父，且脱了褊衫，把他且穿在底下，受用受用，免得吃冷。”三藏道：“不可不可！律云：公取窃取皆为盗。倘或有人知觉，赶上我们，到了当官，断然是一个窃盗之罪。还不送进去与他搭在原处！我们在此避风坐一坐，等悟空来时走路，出家人不要这等爱小。”八戒道：“四顾无人，虽鸡犬亦不知之，但只我们知道，谁人告我？有何证见？就如拾到的一般，那里论甚么公取窃取也！”三藏道：“你胡做啊！虽是人不知之，天何盖焉！玄帝垂训云，暗室亏心，神目如电。趁早送去还他，莫爱非礼之物。”那呆子莫想肯听，对唐僧笑道：“师父啊，我自为人，也穿了几件背心，不曾见这等纳锦的。你不穿，且待老猪穿一穿，试试新，晤晤脊背。等师兄来，脱了还他走路。”沙僧道：“既如此说，我也穿一件儿。”两个齐脱了上盖直裰，将背心套上。才紧带子，不知怎么立站不稳，扑的一跌。原来这背心儿赛过绑缚手，霎时间，把他两个背剪手贴心捆了。</p>

<p>慌得个三藏跌足报怨，急忙上前来解，那里便解得开？三个人在那里吆喝之声不绝，却早惊动了魔头也。</p>

<p>话说那座楼房果是妖精点化的，终日在此拿人。他在洞里正坐，忽闻得怨恨之声，急出门来看，果见捆住几个人了。妖魔即唤小妖，同到那厢，收了楼台房屋之形，把唐僧搀住，牵了白马，挑了行李，将八戒沙僧一齐捉到洞里。老妖魔登台高坐，众小妖把唐僧推近台边，跪伏于地。妖魔问道：“你是那方和尚？</p>

<p>怎么这般胆大，白日里偷盗我的衣服？”三藏滴泪告曰：“贫僧是东土大唐钦差往西天取经的，因腹中饥馁，着大徒弟去化斋未回，不曾依得他的言语，误撞仙庭避风。不期我这两个徒弟爱小，拿出这衣物，贫僧决不敢坏心，当教送还本处。他不听吾言，要穿此晤晤脊背，不料中了大王机会，把贫僧拿来。万望慈悯，留我残生，求取真经，永注大王恩情，回东土千古传扬也！”</p>

<p>那妖魔笑道：“我这里常听得人言：有人吃了唐僧一块肉，发白还黑，齿落更生，幸今日不请自来，还指望饶你哩！你那大徒弟叫做甚么名字？往何方化斋？”八戒闻言，即开口称扬道：“我师兄乃五百年前大闹天宫齐天大圣孙悟空也。”那妖魔听说是齐天大圣孙悟空，老大有些悚惧，口内不言，心中暗想道：“久闻那厮神通广大，如今不期而会。”教：“小的们，把唐僧捆了，将那两个解下宝贝，换两条绳子也捆了。且抬在后边，待我拿住他大徒弟，一发刷洗，却好凑笼蒸吃。”众小妖答应一声，把三人一齐捆了，抬在后边，将白马拴在槽头，行李挑在屋里。众妖都磨兵器，准备擒拿行者不题。</p>

<p>却说孙行者自南庄人家摄了一钵盂斋饭，驾云回返旧路。</p>

<p>径至山坡平处，按下云头，早已不见唐僧，不知何往，棍划的圈子还在，只是人马都不见了。回看那楼台处所，亦俱无矣，惟见山根怪石。行者心惊道：“不消说了！他们定是遭那毒手也！”</p>

<p>急依路看着马蹄，向西而赶。行有五六里，正在凄怆之际，只闻得北坡外有人言语。看时，乃一个老翁，毡衣苫体，暖帽蒙头，足下踏一双半新半旧的油靴，手持着一根龙头拐棒，后边跟一个年幼的僮仆，折一枝腊梅花，自坡前念歌而走。行者放下钵盂，觌面道个问讯，叫：“老公公，贫僧问讯了。”那老翁即便回礼道：“长老那里来的？”行者道：“我们东土来的，往西天拜佛求经，一行师徒四众。我因师父饥了，特去化斋，教他三众坐在那山坡平处相候。及回来不见，不知往那条路上去了。动问公公，可曾看见？”老者闻言，呵呵冷笑道：“你那三众，可有一个长嘴大耳的么？”行者道：“有有有！”“又有一个晦气色脸的，牵着一匹白马，领着一个白脸的胖和尚么？”行者道：“是是是！”</p>

<p>老翁道：“你们走错路了，你休寻他，各个顾命去也。”行者道：</p>

<p>“那白脸者是我师父，那怪样者是我师弟。我与他共发虔心，要往西天取经，如何不寻他去！”老翁道：“我才然从此过时，看见他错走了路径，闯入妖魔口里去了。”行者道：“烦公公指教指教，是个甚么妖魔，居于何方，我好上门取索他等，往西天去也。”老翁道：“这座山叫做金皘山，山前有个金皘洞，那洞中有个独角兕大王。那大王神通广大，威武高强。那三众此回断没命了，你若去寻，只怕连你也难保，不如不去之为愈也。我也不敢阻你，也不敢留你，只凭你心中度量，”行者再拜称谢道：“多蒙公公指教，我岂有不寻之理！”把这斋饭倒与他，将这空钵盂自家收拾。那老翁放下拐棒，接了钵盂，递与僮仆，现出本象，双双跪下叩头叫：“大圣，小神不敢隐瞒，我们两个就是此山山神土地，在此候接大圣。这斋饭连钵盂，小神收下，让大圣身轻好施法力。待救唐僧出难，将此斋还奉唐僧，方显得大丝至恭至孝。”行者喝道：“你这毛鬼讨打！既知我到，何不早迎？却又这般藏头露尾，是甚道理？”土地道：“大圣性急，小神不敢造次，恐犯威颜，故此隐象告知。”行者息怒道：“你且记打！好生与我收着钵盂！待我拿那妖精去来！”土地山神遵领。</p>

<p>这大圣却才束一束虎筋绦，拽起虎皮裙，执着金箍棒，径奔山前，找寻妖洞。转过山崖，只见那乱石磷磷，翠崖边有两扇石门，门外有许多小妖，在那里轮枪舞剑，真个是：烟云凝瑞，苔藓堆青。崚嶒怪石列，崎岖曲道萦。猿啸鸟啼风景丽，鸾飞凤舞若蓬瀛。向阳几树梅初放，弄暖千竿竹自青。陡崖之下，深涧之中，陡崖之下雪堆粉，深涧之中水结冰。两林松柏千年秀，几簇山茶一样红。这大圣观看不尽，拽开步径至门前，厉声高叫道：“那小妖，你快进去与你那洞主说，我本是唐朝圣僧徒弟齐天大圣孙悟空，快教他送我师父出来，免教你等丧了性命！”那伙小妖，急入洞里报道：“大王，前面有一个毛脸勾嘴的和尚，称是齐天大圣孙悟空，来要他师父哩。”那魔王闻得此言，满心欢喜道：“正要他来哩！我自离了本宫，下降尘世，更不曾试试武艺。今日他来，必是个对手。”即命：“小的们！取出兵器。”那洞中大小群魔，一个个精神抖擞，即忙抬出一根丈二长的点钢枪，递与老怪。老怪传令教：“小的们，各要整齐，进前者赏，退后者诛！”众妖得令，随着老怪，腾出门来，叫道：“那个是孙悟空？”行者在旁闪过，见那魔王生得好不凶丑：独角参差，双眸幌亮。顶上粗皮突，耳根黑肉光。舌长时搅鼻，口阔版牙黄。毛皮青似靛，筋挛硬如钢。比犀难照水，象牯不耕荒。全无喘月犁云用，倒有欺天振地强。两只焦筋蓝靛手，雄威直挺点钢枪。细看这等凶模样，不枉名称兕大王！孙大圣上前道：</p>

<p>“你孙外公在这里也！快早还我师父，两无毁伤！若道半个不字，我教你死无葬身之地！”那魔喝道：“我把你这个大胆泼猴精！你有些甚么手段，敢出这般大言！”行者道：“你这泼物，是也不曾见我老孙的手段！”那妖魔道：“你师父偷盗我的衣服，实是我拿住了，如今待要蒸吃。你是个甚么好汉，就敢上我的门来取讨！”行者道：“我师父乃忠良正直之僧，岂有偷你甚么妖物之理？”妖魔道：“我在山路边点化一座仙庄，你师父潜入里面，心爱情欲，将我三领纳锦绵装背心儿偷穿在身，只有赃证，故此我才拿他。你今果有手段，即与我比势，假若三合敌得我，饶了你师之命；如敌不过我，教你一路归阴！”行者笑道：</p>

<p>“泼物！不须讲口！但说比势，正合老孙之意。走上来，吃吾之棒！”那怪物那怕甚么赌斗，挺钢枪劈面迎来。这一场好杀！你看那：金箍棒举，长杆枪迎。金箍棒举，亮藿藿似电掣金蛇；长杆枪迎，明幌幌如龙离黑海。那门前小妖擂鼓，排开阵势助威风；这壁厢大圣施功，使出纵横逞本事。他那里一杆枪，精神抖擞；我这里一条棒，武艺高强。正是英雄相遇英雄汉，果然对手才逢对手人。那魔王口喷紫气盘烟雾，这大圣眼放光华结绣云。只为大唐僧有难，两家无义苦争轮。他两个战经三十合，不分胜负。那魔王见孙悟空棍法齐整，一往一来，全无些破绽，喜得他连声喝采道：“好猴儿！好猴儿！真个是那闹天官的本事！”这大圣也爱他枪法不乱，右遮左挡，甚有解数，也叫道：</p>

<p>“好妖精！好妖精！果然是一个偷丹的魔头！”二人又斗了一二十合。那魔王把枪尖点地，喝令小妖齐来。那些泼怪，一个个拿刀弄杖，执剑轮枪，把个孙大圣围在中间。行者公然不惧，只叫：“来得好！来得好！正合吾意！”使一条金箍棒，前迎后架，东挡西除，那伙群妖，莫想肯退。行者忍不住焦躁，把金箍棒丢将起去，喝声“变！”即变作千百条铁棒，好便似飞蛇走蟒，盈空里乱落下来。那伙妖精见了，一个个魄散魂飞，抱头缩颈，尽往洞中逃命。老魔王唏唏冷笑道：“那猴不要无礼！看手段！”即忙袖中取出一个亮灼灼白森森的圈子来，望空抛起，叫声“着！”唿喇一下，把金箍棒收做一条，套将去了。弄得孙大圣赤手空拳，翻筋斗逃了性命。那妖魔得胜回归洞，行者朦胧失主张，这正是：道高一尺魔高一丈，性乱情昏错认家。可恨法身无坐位，当时行动念头差。毕竟不知这番怎么结果，且听下回分解。
