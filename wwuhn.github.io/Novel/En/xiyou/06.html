<P>Guanyin Comes to the Feast and Asks the Reason Why</P>
<P>The Little Sage Uses His Might to Subdue the Great Sage</P>
</div>
<P>We shall leave for the moment the Heavenly Generals making their encirclement and the soundly sleeping Great Sage. The story goes on to tell how the Compassionate and Merciful Miraculous Savior from Suffering, the Bodhisattva Guanyin of Mount Potaraka in the Southern Sea, having been invited by the Queen Mother to the Peach Banquet, went to the precious pavilions at the Jade Pool with her great disciple Huian the Novice. She found the place deserted and the banquet ruined. The few Immortals present were not sitting at their places but holding confused discussions. When greetings were over the Immortals gave the Bodhisattva an account of what had happened.</P>
<P>&#8220;If there is to be no banquet and no drinking,&#8221; said the Bodhisattva, &#8220;you had better all come with me to the Jade Emperor.&#8221; The Immortals were delighted to follow her, and when they arrived before the Hall of Universal Brightness the Four Heavenly Teachers, the Bare-Foot Immortal and many others were all there to greet the Bodhisattva. They told her that the Jade Emperor had sent heavenly armies to capture the demon, but they had not yet returned.</P>
<P>&#8220;I wish to see the Jade Emperor,&#8221; said the Bodhisattva, &#8220;so may I trouble you to inform him on my behalf?&#8221; The heavenly teacher Qui Hongji then went to the Hall of Miraculous Mist, and the Bodhisattva was invited in. She found that Lord Lao Zi was there in the place of honour, and that the Queen Mother was behind him.</P>
<P>The Bodhisattva went in at the head of the others, and when she had done obeisance to the Jade Emperor she greeted Lao Zi and the Queen Mother. After they had all sat down she asked what had happened at the Peach Banquet.</P>
<P>&#8220;The banquet is held every year, and it is normally a very happy occasion,&#8221; the Jade Emperor replied, &#8220;but this year that monkey fiend wrecked it, so that your invitation was worth nothing.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where does this monkey fiend come from?&#8221; asked the Bodhisattva.</P>
<P>&#8220;He was born from a stone egg on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit in the land of Aolai in the Eastern Continent of Superior Body,&#8221; the Jade Emperor answered. &#8220;When he was born golden beams flashed from his eyes that reached to the star palace. At first we paid no attention to him, but later on he became a spirit, subduing dragons and tigers, and erasing his own name from the registers of death. The Dragon Kings and King Yama of the underworld informed us of this in memorials, and we wanted to capture him, but the Star of Longevity memorialized that in the Three Worlds all beings with nine orifices can become Immortals. We therefore extended education to the worthy by summoning him to the upper world and appointing him Protector of the Horses in the Imperial Stable. But this was not good enough for the scoundrel, who rebelled against Heaven. We sent Heavenly King Li and Prince Nezha to accept his surrender, extended him an amnesty, and summoned him back to the upper world. We made him a 'Great Sage Equaling Heaven,' though this carried no salary. As he had nothing to do he would go wandering all over the place, and for fear that this might lead to trouble we had him look after the Peach Orchard. Once again he flouted the law by stealing and eating every single one of the big peaches from the old trees. When the banquet was to be held he was not invited as his position was purely an honorary one; so he played a trick on the Bare-foot Immortal, went to the banquet looking like him, ate all the immortal delicacies, and drank all the immortal liquor. On top of this he stole Lord Lao Zi's pills of immortality and some imperial liquor, which he took to his mountain for the monkeys to enjoy. This made us very angry so we sent a hundred thousand heavenly troops to spread heaven-and-earth nets and subdue him. But we have received no reports today, so we do not know whether we have been victorious.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the Bodhisattva heard this she said to Huian the Novice, &#8220;Hurry down from Heaven to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit and find out about the military situation. If you meet with any opposition you may do your bit to help, but the important thing is to bring an accurate report back.&#8221; Huian the Novice straightened his robes, took his iron staff, left the palace by cloud, and went straight to the mountain. He saw that with the layer upon layer of heaven-and-earth nets, and the men holding bells and shouting passwords at the gates of the camp, the cordon round the mountain was watertight.</P>
<P>Huian stopped and called, &#8220;Heavenly soldiers at the gates of the camp, I would trouble you to report that I, Moksa, the second son of Heavenly King Li, also known as Huian, the senior disciple of Guanyin of the Southern Sea, have come to ask about the military situation.&#8221; Then the divine soldiers of the Five Mountains inside the camp went in through the gates of the headquarters, where the Rat, the Cock, the Horse and the Hare stars reported the news to the commander of the central corps. Heavenly King Li sent a flag of command with the order that the heaven-and-earth nets were to be opened to let Huian in. The East was just beginning to grow light as Huian followed the flag in and bowed to Heavenly King Li and the four other heavenly kings.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where have you come from, my son?&#8221; asked Heavenly King Li.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your stupid son accompanied the Bodhisattva to the Peach Banquet, and when she found the banquet deserted and nobody at the Jade Pool, she took me and the other Immortals to see the Jade Emperor. The Jade Emperor told her that you, father, and the other kings had gone down to the lower world to capture this monkey fiend. As the Jade Emperor has received no news all day on the outcome of the battle, the Bodhisattva sent me here to find out what has happened.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We arrived here and encamped yesterday,&#8221; Heavenly King Li replied, &#8220;then sent the Nine Bright Shiners to challenge the enemy to battle, but that wretch used such tremendous magic powers that the Nine Bright Shiners all came back defeated. Then we led out own soldiers into action, and the wretch also drew up his line of battle. Our hundred thousand heavenly soldiers fought an indecisive engagements with him till dusk when he used a spell to divide up his body and force us back. When we withdrew our forces and held an investigation, we found that we had only captured wolves, tigers, leopards, and so on, and had not even taken half a monkey fiend. We have not yet given battle today.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before he had finished speaking someone appeared outside the gates of the headquarters to report that the Great Sage was outside at the head of a crowd of monkey spirits, clamoring for battle. The four other Heavenly Kings, Heavenly King Li, and Prince Nezha were all for committing their forces, but Moksa said, &#8220;Father, when your stupid son was instructed by the Bodhisattva to come here and find out the news, I was also told that if there was a battle I could do my bit to help. May I please go and see what sort of a 'Great Sage' he is, untalented though I am?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My boy,&#8221; said Heavenly King Li, &#8220;you have been cultivating your conduct with the Bodhisattva for some years now so I suppose that you must have acquired some magic powers, but do be very careful.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Prince Moksa hitched up his embroidered robes and charged out through the gates of the headquarters waving his iron staff with both hands. &#8220;Which of you is the Great Sage Equaling Heaven?&#8221; he shouted.</P>
<P>&#8220;I am,&#8221; answered the Great Sage, brandishing his As-You-Will cudgel. &#8220;But who do you think you are, asking a question like that?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am Prince Moksa, the second son of Heavenly King Li, and I am now a disciple and a guard before the throne of the Bodhisattva Guanyin. My Buddhist name is Huian.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why have you come here to see me instead of staying in the Southern Sea and cultivating your conduct?&#8221; asked the Great Sage, and Moksa replied, &#8220;My teacher sent me here to find out about the military situation, but now that I've seen your savagery I've come to capture you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You talk big, don't you,&#8221; said the Great Sage.</P>
<P>&#8220;Well then, don't go away, try a taste of my cudgel.&#8221; Moksa, not in the least frightened, struck at him with his iron staff. It was a fine fight they fought, half-way up the mountainside outside the gates of the headquarters.</P>


<P>The staves were matched, but made of different iron;</P>
<P>The weapons clashed, but their masters were not the same.</P>
<P>One was a wayward Immortal known as the Great Sage,</P>
<P>The other a true dragon disciple of Guanyin.</P>
<P>The cast-iron staff, beaten with a thousand hammers,</P>
<P>Had been forged by the art of the Ding and the Jia.</P>
<P>The As-You-Will cudgel once anchored the Milky Way:</P>
<P>As the Treasure Stilling the Sea its magic power was great.</P>
<P>When the two met they were well matched indeed.</P>
<P>And they parried and lunged at each other without end.</P>
<P>The sinister cudgel, Infinitely murderous,</P>
<P>Could whirl round your waist as quick as the wind,</P>
<P>The spear-catching staff,</P>
<P>Never yielding an opening,</P>
<P>Was irresistible, parrying to right and left.</P>
<P>On the one side the flags and banners fly,</P>
<P>On the other the camel drums roll.</P>
<P>Ten thousand heavenly generals in multiple encirclement;</P>
<P>A cave of monkey devils densely packed together.</P>
<P>Monstrous fogs and evil clouds cover the earth,</P>
<P>While the smoke of deadly battle rises to the sky.</P>
<P>Yesterday's fighting was bad enough;</P>
<P>Today's struggle is even worse.</P>
<P>The admirable skills of the Monkey King</P>
<P>Put Moksa to flight, utterly defeated.</P>


<P>After they had fought some fifty or sixty rounds, Huian's arm and shoulders were numbed and aching, and he could resist the Great Sage no longer. Waving his staff in a feint, he turned away and ran. The Great Sage then withdrew his monkey soldiers and encamped outside the gates of the cave.</P>
<P>The big and little heavenly soldiers at the gates of the other camp received Huian and let him go straight to the headquarters, where he gasped and panted for breath as he said to the Four Heavenly Kings, Li the Pagoda-bearer, and his brother Prince Nezha, &#8220;What a Great Sage! What a Great Sage! His magic powers are too much for me. He beat me.&#8221; Startled by this news, Heavenly King Li had a request for reinforcements written and sent the Strong-arm Devil King and Prince Moksa up to Heaven to submit.</P>
<P>Not daring to waste a moment, the two messengers rushed out through the heaven-and-earth nets and mounted their propitious clouds. A moment later they arrived outside the Hall of Universal Brightness, where they greeted the Four Heavenly Teachers, who led them to the Hall of Miraculous Mist and handed up their memorial. Prince Moksa, or Huian, did homage to the Bodhisattva, who asked him what he had found out.</P>
<P>&#8220;As you instructed me, I went to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit,&#8221; reported Huian, &#8220;asked them to open the gates of the heaven-and-earth net, saw my father, and told him of the orders you had given me. His Majesty my father said that they fought against the Monkey King yesterday but did not capture a single monkey spirit&#8212;only tigers, leopards, lions, elephants and so on. While he was telling me this the Monkey King demanded battle again, so your disciple fought some fifty or sixty rounds against him with my iron staff, but I was no match for him. He beat me, and drove me back to the camp. This is why my father has sent me and the Strong-arm Devil King up to Heaven to ask for reinforcements.&#8221; The Bodhisattva lowered her head in deep thought.</P>
<P>The Jade Emperor opened the memorial and saw that it contained a request for help. &#8220;This intolerable monkey spirit has enough tricks to fight off a hundred thousand heavenly soldiers,&#8221; he observed with a smile. &#8220;Heavenly King Li has asked for reinforcements. Which heavenly soldiers should I send him?&#8221;</P>
<P>Before the words were out of his mouth, Guanyin put her hands together and said, &#8220;Do not worry, You Majesty. I can recommend a god to capture this monkey.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Which god?&#8221; the Jade Emperor asked, and the Bodhisattva replied, &#8220;Your Majesty's nephew, the Illustrious Sage and True Lord Erlang, who is now living at Guanjiangkou in Guanzhou, enjoying the incense that the lower beings burn to him. In the past he exterminated the Six Bogies. He has the Brothers of Plum Hill and the twelve hundred straw-headed gods, and his magical powers are enormous. He will agree to be sent though he would not obey a summons to come here, so Your Majesty might like to issue a decree ordering him to take his troops to the rescue.&#8221; The Jade Emperor then issued such a decree and sent the Strong-arm Devil King to deliver it.</P>
<P>The devil king took the decree, mounted his cloud, and went straight to Guanjiangkou. He reached the temple of the True Lord within an hour. When the demon judges guarding the gates went in to report that there was an envoy from heaven standing outside with an imperial decree, Erlang went with the brothers to receive the decree outside the gates, and incense was burned as he read.</P>


<P>The Great Sage Equaling Heaven, the monkey fiend of the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit, has rebelled. Because he stole peaches, wine and pills while in Heaven and wrecked the Peach Banquet, we have despatched a hundred thousand heavenly soldiers and eighteen heaven-and-earth nets to surround the mountain and force him to submit, but we have not yet succeeded. We do now therefore especially appoint our worthy nephew and his sworn brothers to go to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit and give their help in eliminating him. When you succeed, large rewards and high office shall be yours.</P>


<P>Erlang was delighted. He told the envoy from Heaven to go back and report that the would be putting his sword to the Emperor's service. We need not describe how the devil king reported back to Heaven.</P>
<P>The True Lord Erlang called the six sworn brothers of Plum Hill&#8212;Marshals Kang, Zhang, Yao, and Li, and Generals Quo Shen and Zhi Jian&#8212;together before the hall. &#8220;The Jade Emperor has just ordered us to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit to subdue a monkey fiend,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You are all coming with me.&#8221;</P>
<P>The brothers were all eager to go, and mustering their divine troops they unleashed a gale wind. In an instant they had crossed the Eastern Ocean, riding eagles and leading dogs, pulling their bows and drawing their crossbows, and had reached the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit.</P>
<P>Finding that the many layers of heaven-earth nets were impenetrable, Erlang shouted, &#8220;Listen, all you generals in charge of the heaven-and-earth nets. I am the True Lord and the Illustrious Sage Erlang, and I have been sent here by the Jade Emperor to capture the monkey fiend. Open the gates of the camp and let me in at once.&#8221; Each line of gods forming the nets let them through, and the four other Heavenly Kings and Heavenly King Li all came to welcome him outside the headquarters. When the introductions were over he asked how the fighting had gone, and the Heavenly Kings gave him a full account of what had happened.</P>
<P>&#8220;Now that I, the Little Sage, have come here I shall have to match a few transformations with him,&#8221; said Erlang with a smile. &#8220;I hope that all you gentlemen will maintain a close cordon with your heaven-and-earth nets, but don't screen off the top of the mountain; then I'll be able to fight him. If he beats me I shan't need the help of you gentlemen, as I have my brothers to support me; and if I beat him I won't have to trouble you to tie him up as my brothers can do it. I would just like to ask Heavenly King Li to stand in the sky and operate this fiend-detecting mirror. I'm worried that if he's beaten he may go and hide somewhere, so you will have to give me a clear view of him and not let him get away.&#8221; The Heavenly Kings stayed in the four quarters, and all the heavenly soldiers were drawn up in their battle positions.</P>
<P>The True Lord Erlang went out at the head of the four marshals and the two generals&#8212;making seven sworn brothers with himself included&#8212;to challenge the enemy to battle; and he ordered his other officers to defend the camp firmly and keep the eagles and dogs under control. All the straw-headed gods acknowledged the order. Erlang then went to the outside of the Water Curtain Cave, where he saw the monkey hordes neatly drawn up in a coiled-dragon battle line; in the middle of the central corps stood a pole with a banner on it reading &#8220;Great Sage Equaling Heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What business has that loathsome fiend to call himself the equal of Heaven?&#8221; Erlang asked; and the six sworn brothers of Plum Hill replied, &#8220;Stop admiring him and challenge him to battle.&#8221; When the junior monkeys at the gate of their camp saw the True Lord Erlang they rushed back to report, whereupon the Monkey King took his gold-banded cudgel, adjusted his golden armour, put on his cloud-walking shoes, felt his golden helmet, and leapt out through the gates of the camp. He saw at first sight how cool and remarkable Erlang looked, and how elegantly he was dressed. Indeed:</P>


<P>His bearing was refined, his visage noble,</P>
<P>His ears hung down to his shoulders, and his eyes shone.</P>
<P>The hat on his head had three peaks and phoenixes flying,</P>
<P>And his robe was of a pale goose-yellow.</P>
<P>His boots were lined with cloth of gold; dragons coiled round his socks;</P>
<P>His jade belt was decorated with the eight jewels,</P>
<P>At his waist was a bow, curved like the moon,</P>
<P>In his hand a double-edged trident.</P>
<P>His axe had split open Peach Mountain when he rescued his mother,</P>
<P>His bow had killed the twin phoenixes of Zongluo.</P>
<P>Widespread was his fame for killing the Eight Bogies,</P>
<P>And he had become one of Plum Hill's seven sages.</P>
<P>His heart was too lofty to acknowledge his relatives in Heaven;</P>
<P>In his pride he went back to be a god at Guanjiang.</P>
<P>He was the Merciful and Miraculous Sage of the red city,</P>
<P>Erlang, whose transformations were numberless.</P>


<P>When the Great Sage saw him he laughed with delight, raised his gold-banded cudgel, and shouted, &#8220;Where are you from, little general, that you have the audacity to challenge me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You must be blind, you wretch, if you can't recognize me. I am the nephew of the Jade Emperor, and my title is Merciful and Miraculous King Erlang. I am here on imperial orders to arrest you, Protector of the Horses, you rebel against Heaven, you reckless baboon.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Now I remember who you are,&#8221; replied the Great Sage. &#8220;Some years ago the Jade Emperor's younger sister wanted to be mortal and came down to the lower world, where she married a Mr. Yang and gave birth to a son, who split the Peach Mountain open with his axe. Is that who you are? I should really fling you a few curses, but I've got no quarrel with you; and it would be a pity to kill you by hitting you with my cudgel. So why don't you hurry back, young sir, and tell those four Heavenly Kings of yours to come out?&#8221;</P>
<P>When the True Lord Erlang heard this he burst out angrily, &#8220;Damned monkey! Where are your manners? Try this blade of mine!&#8221; The Great Sage dodged the blow and instantly raised his gold-banded club to hit back. There was a fine battle between the two of them:</P>


<P>The Merciful God Erlang,</P>
<P>The Great Sage Equaling Heaven:</P>
<P>One is the Handsome Monkey King, the proud deceiver of his enemies;</P>
<P>The other a true pillar, the unknown subduer.</P>
<P>When the two met</P>
<P>They were both in a fighting mood.</P>
<P>He who had no respect before</P>
<P>Today learned a sense of proportion.</P>
<P>The iron staff raced with the flying dragons,</P>
<P>The divine cudgel seemed like a dancing phoenix.</P>
<P>Parrying to the left, thrusting to the right,</P>
<P>Advancing to meet a blow, flashing behind.</P>
<P>The brothers of Plum Hill add to one side's might,</P>
<P>While the other has the four Stalwart Generals to transmit orders.</P>
<P>As the flags wave and the drums roll each side is as one;</P>
<P>Battle-cries and gongs raise everyone's morale.</P>
<P>The two steel blades each watch for their chance,</P>
<P>But neither leaves an opening as they come and go.</P>
<P>The gold-banded cudgel, the treasure from the sea,</P>
<P>Can fly and transform itself to win the victory.</P>
<P>A moment's delay and life is lost;</P>
<P>A single mistake will be the last.</P>


<P>After Erlang and the Great Sage had fought over three hundred rounds the outcome of the fight was still undecided. Erlang braced, himself, and with a shake became ten thousand fathoms tall; in his hands his two-bladed trident looked like the peaks of Mount Hua. His face was black, his fangs were long, and his hair was bright red: he looked ferociously evil. He hacked at the Great Sage's head. The Great Sage, also resorting to magic, gave himself a body as big as Erlang's and a face as frightening; and he raised his As-You-Will gold-banded cudgel, which was now like the pillar of Heaven on the summit of the Kunlun Mountain, to ward off Erlang's blow. This reduced the two ape field marshals Ma and Liu to such trembling terror that they could no longer wave their banners, while the gibbon generals Seng and Ba were too scared to use their swords. On the other side Kang, Zhang, Yao, Li, Guo Shen and Zhi Jian threw the straw-headed gods into an assault on the Water Curtain Cave, with the dogs and eagles unleashed and their bows and crossbows drawn. This attack put the four monkey generals to flight, and two or three thousand devils were captured. The monkeys threw away their spears, tore off their armour, abandoned their swords and halberds, and fled screaming. Some went up the mountain and some returned to the cave, like roosting birds frightened by an owl, or stars scattered across the sky. That is all we have to say about the sworn brothers' victory.</P>
<P>The story goes on to tell how the True Lord Erlang and the Great Sage, having turned themselves into figures on the scale of Heaven and Earth, were locked in battle when the Great Sage was suddenly appalled to notice that the monkey fiends in his camp had scattered in terror. Putting off his magic appearance he broke away and fled, his cudgel in his hand. Seeing him go, the True Lord Erlang hurried after him with long strides.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;If you surrender at once, your life will be spared.&#8221; The Great Sage, who had no heart left for the fight, was running as fast as he could. As he approached the mouth of the cave he came up against Marshals Kang, Zhang, Yao and Li, as well as Generals Guo Shen and Zhi Jian, blocking his way at the head of their armies.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you going, damned monkey?&#8221; they asked, and the Great Sage hastily squeezed his gold-banded cudgel till it was the size of an embroidery needle and hid it in his ear. Then he shook himself, turned into a sparrow, flew up into a tree, and perched on one of its branches.</P>
<P>The six sworn brothers looked for him very hard but could find him nowhere, so they all shouted in unison, &#8220;The monkey fiend has escaped, the monkey fiend has escaped.&#8221;</P>
<P>As they were shouting the True Lord Erlang arrived and asked them, &#8220;Brothers, where had you chased him to when he disappeared?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We had him surrounded here just now, but he vanished.&#8221; Erlang opened his phoenix eyes till they were quite round and looked about him. He saw that the Great Sage had changed himself into a sparrow and was perching on a branch; so he put off his magical appearance, threw down his divine trident, and took the pellet bow from his waist. Then he shook himself, changed into a kite, spread his wings, and swooped in to attack. As soon as the Great Sage saw this he took off and turned himself into a big cormorant, soaring up into the sky. Erlang saw him, and with a quick shake of his feathers and a twist of his body he transformed himself into a crane and pierced the clouds as he tried to catch him. The Great Sage landed on a mountain stream and, changing into a fish, plunged into the water. Erlang, who had pursued him to the bank of the stream, could see no trace of him.</P>
<P>&#8220;That macaque must have gone into the water and changed himself into some kind of fish or shrimp,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;I'll transform myself again, then I'll get him.&#8221; He turned into a fish-hawk and soared above the lower reaches of the stream and the first waves of the sea. He waited there for a time. Meanwhile the Great Sage, who was in the form of a fish, swam with the stream until he noticed a bird flying above him. It was quite like a blue kite, except that its feathers were not blue; it was quite like an egret, but it had no crest on its head; and it was quite like a stork, but its legs were not red.</P>
<P>&#8220;That must be what Erlang turned himself into while waiting for me,&#8221; he thought, turned round quickly, and went away.</P>
<P>&#8220;The fish who turned round,&#8221; thought Erlang when he saw this, &#8220;is like a carp but its tail isn't red; it's like a mandarin fish, but I can't see the pattern on its scales; it's like a snakehead, but without a star on its head; and like a bream, but it has no needles on its gills. Why did it turn round the moment it saw me? It must be that monkey transformed.&#8221; He swooped down and snapped at the Great Sage with his beak. The Great Sage leapt out of the water, turned into a water-snake, swam to the bank, and slid into the grass. Failing to catch the fish in his beak, Erlang saw a snake jump out of the water and realized it was the Great Sage. He changed himself at once into a red-crested grey crane, and stretched out his long beak that was like a pair of pointed pincers to eat up the water-snake. The snake gave a jump and became a bustard standing stiffly on a smartweed-covered bank. When Erlang saw that he had turned himself into so low a creature&#8212;for the bustard is the lowest and lewdest of birds, not caring whether it mates with phoenix, eagle or crow&#8212;he kept his distance, reverted to his own body, went away to fetch and load his pellet bow, and knocked him flying with a single shot.</P>
<P>The Great Sage seized the chance as he rolled down the precipice to crouch there and turn himself into a temple to a local god. He opened his mouth wide to look like the entrance to the temple and turned his teeth into the doors; he made his tongue into a statue of a god and his eyes into windows and lattice. He could not tuck his tail away, so he stuck it up behind him as a flagpole. When Erlang came to the foot of the precipice he could not see the bustard he had shot over, and anxiously opening his phoenix eyes he looked carefully around and saw a temple with its flagpole at the back.</P>
<P>&#8220;It must be that monkey over there,&#8221; he observed with a smile. &#8220;He's trying to fool me again. I've seen temples before, but never one with the flagpole at the back. I'm sure it is that beast up to his tricks again. If he'd managed to lure me in, he'd have been able to get me with a single bite. Of course I won't go in. I'll smash his windows in with my fist, then I'll kick his door down.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Vicious, really vicious,&#8221; thought the Great Sage with horror when he heard him say this. &#8220;Those doors are my teeth, and the windows are my eyes; and if he smashes my teeth and bashes in my eyes, what sort of a state will that leave me in?&#8221; With a tiger leap he disappeared into the sky.</P>
<P>The True Lord Erlang rushed around wildly, but he could only see his six sworn brothers, who crowded round him and asked, &#8220;Elder brother, did you catch the Great Sage?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That monkey turned himself into a temple to fool me,&#8221; he replied with a laugh. &#8220;Just when I was going to smash his windows and kick in his door he gave a jump and vanished without a trace. Strange, very strange.&#8221; They were all astonished, and though they looked all around they could see no sign of him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brothers, you patrol this area while I go to look for him above,&#8221; said Erlang, and with a quick jump he was riding a cloud in mid-air.</P>
<P>When he saw Heavenly King Li holding high the fiend-detecting mirror and standing with Nezha at the edge of a cloud, the True Lord asked, &#8220;Your Heavenly Majesty, have you seen that Monkey King?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He hasn't come up here&#8212;I've been keeping a lookout for him with this mirror,&#8221; the Heavenly King replied. The True Lord Erlang then told him how he had used transformations and magic to capture the monkey hordes.</P>
<P>&#8220;He changed into a temple,&#8221; Erlang went on, &#8220;but got away just when I was going to hit him.&#8221; On hearing this, Heavenly King Li turned the fiend-detecting mirror in all four directions, then said with a laugh, &#8220;Hurry away, True Lord, hurry away. The monkey made himself invisible to get through the encirclement, and he's gone to your place, Guanjiangkou.&#8221; Erlang took his divine trident and returned to Guanjiangkou in pursuit.</P>
<P>The Great Sage had already arrived there, changed himself into the likeness of the god Erlang with a shake of his body, put away his cloud, and gone into the temple. The demon judges did not realize who he really was, so they all kowtowed to welcome him. He took his seat in the middle of the temple, and inspected the offerings: the beef, mutton and pork presented by one Li Hu, the ex-voto promised by a Zhang Long, the letter from a Zhao Jia asking for a son, and one Qian Bing's prayer for recovery from illness. As he was looking round it was announced that another Lord Erlang had arrived. All the demon judges hurried to look, and they were all astonished.</P>
<P>The True Lord Erlang asked, &#8220;Has a so-called Great Sage Equaling Heaven been here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We haven't seen any Great Sages,&#8221; they replied, &#8220;only another god who's looking around inside.&#8221;</P>
<P>The True Lord rushed in through the gates, and as soon as the Great Sage saw him he reverted to his own appearance and said, &#8220;There's no point in shouting, sir. This temple's mine now.&#8221;</P>
<P>The True Lord raised his double-bladed trident and swung at the Monkey King's head, but the Monkey King dodged the blow by magic, took his embroidery needle, shook it till it was as thick as a bowl, and rushed forward to meet the attack. Shouting and yelling, they fought their way out through the gates, and went on fighting through the mists and clouds all the way back to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. The Four Heavenly Kings and all their soldiers were so alarmed that they kept an even tighter guard. Marshals Kang and Zhang and the others came to meet the True Lord, and combined their efforts to surround the Handsome Monkey King. But of this no more for now.</P>
<P>After the Strong-arm Demon King had sent the True Lord Erlang and his six sworn brothers with their troops to capture the fiend, he had gone back to Heaven to report. He found the Jade Emperor, the Bodhisattva Guanyin, the Queen Mother and all his immortal ministers in conference.</P>
<P>&#8220;Although Erlang has joined the fight, we have had no reports on it all day,&#8221; the Jade Emperor said.</P>
<P>Guanyin put her hands together and replied, &#8220;May I suggest that Your Majesty go out through the Southern Gate of Heaven with Lord Lao Zi to see for yourself what is happening.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;A good idea,&#8221; said the Emperor, and he went by chariot with Lao Zi, the Queen Mother, and all the immortal ministers to the Southern Gate of Heaven. Here they were met by a number of heavenly soldiers and strongmen. When the gates were opened and they looked into the distance they saw that the heavenly hosts were spread all around in a net; Heavenly King Li and Nezha were standing in mid-air with the fiend-detecting mirror, and Erlang was struggling with the Great Sage within the encircling ring.</P>
<P>The Bodhisattva addressed Lao Zi and asked, &#8220;What do you think of the god Erlang I recommended? He really does have divine powers. He's just got that Great Sage cornered, and all he has to do now is to catch him. If I give him a little help now he will certainly be able to do it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What weapon would you use, Bodhisattva? How could you help him?&#8221; Lao Zi asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll drop that pure vase of willow twigs on the monkey's head. Even if it doesn't kill him it will knock him off balance and enable the Little Sage to catch him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That vase of yours is made of porcelain,&#8221; Lao Zi replied, &#8220;and if you hit the target that will be fine. But if it were to miss his head and smash into his iron club, it would be shattered. Just hold your hand while I give him a little help.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What sort of weapon do you have?&#8221; the Bodhisattva asked, and Lord Lao Zi replied, &#8220;I've got one all right.&#8221; He pulled up his sleeve and took a bracelet off his right arm.</P>
<P>&#8220;This weapon,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is made of tempered steel to which I have added the magic elixir. It preserves my miraculous essence, can transform itself, is proof against fire and water, and can snare anything. One of its names is Diamond Jade and the other is Diamond Noose. When I went out through the Han Pass some years ago to turn into a foreigner and become a Buddha, I have a great deal to thank it for. It's the best protection at any time. Just watch while I throw it down and hit him.&#8221;</P>
<P>As soon as he had finished speaking he threw it down from outside the heavenly gate, and it fell into the camp on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit, hitting the Monkey King neatly on the head. The Monkey King was too preoccupied with fighting the seven sages to notice this weapon falling on him from heaven, and when it struck him on the forehead he lost his balance and stumbled, then picked himself up and started to run. The slim dog of the god Erlang caught him up and bit him in the calf, bringing him down again. As he lay on the ground he cursed at the dog.</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't bother your own master, damn you; why pick on me to bite?&#8221; He rolled over and tried unsuccessfully to get up, but the seven sages all held him down, roped him up, and put a sickle-shaped blade round his collar-bone to prevent him from making any more transformations.</P>
<P>Lord Lao Zi then recovered his Diamond Jade and invited the Jade Emperor, Guanyin, the Queen Mother, and all the immortal ministers to return to the Hall of Miraculous Mist. Down below, Heavenly King Li and the four other Heavenly Kings assembled their troops and pulled up the stockade. They went over to congratulate the Little Sage and said, &#8220;It was all thanks to you, Little Sage.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No, it was thanks to the great blessings of His Celestial Majesty and the might of all the gods&#8212;it was nothing I did,&#8221; replied the Little Sage.</P>
<P>&#8220;No time to talk now, elder brother,&#8221; said the four marshals Kang, Zhang, Yao, and Li. &#8220;Let's take this wretch up to Heaven to see the Jade Emperor and ask what is to be done with him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Worthy brothers,&#8221; Erlang replied, &#8220;you never received any heavenly commission, so it would not be right for you to see the Jade Emperor. The heavenly soldiers can escort him while I go up there with the Heavenly Kings to report back. You should comb this mountain with your troops, and when you've finished go back to Guanjiangkou. When I've asked for our rewards, I'll come back and we can celebrate together.&#8221; The four marshals and the two generals accepted their orders, and the rest mounted their clouds and went to Heaven triumphantly singing victory songs. Before long they were outside the Hall of Universal Brightness. The heavenly teachers reported to the throne that the Four Great Heavenly Kings and the rest of them had captured the monkey devil, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven, and were now waiting to be summoned. The Jade Emperor then issued an edict ordering the Strong-arm Demon King and the heavenly soldiers to march him to the Demon-beheading Tower, where the wretch was to have his body chopped to mincemeat. Goodness!</P>


<P>The bully and cheat now meets with a bitter punishment,</P>
<P>The heroic spirit must now come to an end.</P>

<P>观音赴会问原因</P>
<P>小圣施威降大圣</P>
</div>
<p>且不言天神围绕，大圣安歇。</p>

<p>话表南海普陀落伽山大慈大悲救苦救难灵感观世音菩萨，自王母娘娘请赴蟠桃大会，与大徒弟惠岸行者，同登宝阁瑶池，见那里荒荒凉凉，席面残乱；虽有几位天仙，俱不就座，都在那里乱纷纷讲论。菩萨与众仙相见毕，众仙备言前事。菩萨道：“既无盛会，又不传杯，汝等可跟贫僧去见玉帝。”众仙怡然随往。至通明殿前，早有四大天师、赤脚大仙等众，俱在此迎着菩萨，即道玉帝烦恼，调遣天兵，擒怪未回等因。菩萨道：“我要见见玉帝，烦为转奏。”天师邱弘济即入灵霄宝殿，启知宣入。时有太上老君在上，王母娘娘在后。</p>

<p>菩萨引众同入里面，与玉帝礼毕，又与老君、王母相见，各坐下，便问：“蟠桃盛会如何？”玉帝道：“每年请会，喜喜欢欢，今年被妖猴作乱，甚是虚邀也。”菩萨道：“妖猴是何出处？”玉帝道：“妖猴乃东胜神洲傲来国花果山石卵化生的。当时生出，即目运金光，射冲斗府。始不介意，继而成精，降龙伏虎，自削死籍。当有龙王、阎王启奏。朕欲擒拿，是长庚星启奏道：‘三界之间，凡有九窍者，可以成仙。’朕即施教育贤，宣他上界，封为御马监弼马温官。那厮嫌恶官小，反了天宫。即差李天王与哪吒太子收降，又降诏抚安，宣至上界，就封他做个‘齐天大圣’，只是有官无禄。他因没事干管理，东游西荡。朕又恐别生事端，着他代管蟠桃园。他又不遵法律，将老树大桃，尽行偷吃。及至设会，他乃无禄人员，不曾请他，他就设计赚哄赤脚大仙，却自变他相貌入会，将仙肴仙酒尽偷吃了，又偷老君仙丹，又偷御酒若干，去与本山众猴享乐。朕心为此烦恼，故调十万天兵，天罗地网收伏。这一日不见回报，不知胜负如何。”</p>

<p>菩萨闻言，即命惠岸行者道：“你可快下天宫，到花果山打探军情如何。如遇相敌，可就相助一功，务必的实回话。”惠岸行者整整衣裙，执一条铁棍，驾云离阙，径至山前。见那天罗地网，密密层层，各营门提铃喝号，将那山围绕的水泄不通。惠岸立住，叫：“把营门的天丁，烦你传报：我乃李天王二太子木叉，南海观音大徒弟惠岸，特来打探军情。”那营里五岳神兵，即传入辕门之内。早有虚日鼠、昴日鸡、星日马、房日兔将言传到中军帐下。李天王发下令旗，教开天罗地网，放他进来。此时东方才亮，惠岸随旗进入，见四大天王与李天王下拜。拜讫，李天王道：“孩儿，你自那厢来者？”惠岸道：“愚男随菩萨赴蟠桃会，菩萨见胜会荒凉，瑶池寂寞，引众仙并愚男去见玉帝。玉帝备言父王等下界收伏妖猴，一日不见回报，胜负未知，菩萨因命愚男到此打听虚实。”李天王道：“昨日到此安营下寨，着九曜星挑战，被这厮大弄神通，九曜星俱败走而回。后我等亲自提兵，那厮也排开阵势。我等十万天兵，与他混战至晚，他使个分身法战退。及收兵查勘时，止捉得些狼虫虎豹之类，不曾捉得他半个妖猴。今日还未出战。”说不了，只见辕门外有人来报道：“那大圣引一群猴精，在外面叫战。”四大天王与李天王并太子正议出兵。木叉道：“父王，愚男蒙菩萨吩咐，下来打探消息，就说若遇战时，可助一功。今不才愿往，看他怎么个大圣！”天王道：“孩儿，你随菩萨修行这几年，想必也有些神通，切须在意。”</p>

<p>好太子，双手轮着铁棍，束一束绣衣，跳出辕门，高叫：“那个是齐天大圣？”大圣挺如意棒，应声道：“老孙便是。你是甚人，辄敢问我？”木叉道：“吾乃李天王第二太子木叉，今在观音菩萨宝座前为徒弟护教，法名惠岸是也。”大圣道：“你不在南海修行，却来此见我做甚？”木叉道：“我蒙师父差来打探军情，见你这般猖獗，特来擒你！”大圣道：“你敢说那等大话！且休走！吃老孙这一棒！”木叉全然不惧，使铁棒劈手相迎。他两个立那半山中，辕门外，这场好斗——</p>

<p>棍虽对棍铁各异，兵纵交兵人不同。一个是太乙散仙呼大圣，一个是观音徒弟正元龙。浑铁棍乃千锤打，六丁六甲运神功。如意棒是天河定，镇海神珍法力洪。两个相逢真对手，往来解数实无穷。这个的阴手棍，万千凶，绕腰贯索疾如风；那个的夹枪棒，不放空，左遮右挡怎相容？那阵上旌旗闪闪，这阵上鼍鼓冬冬。万员天将团团绕，一洞妖猴簇簇丛。怪雾愁云漫地府，狼烟煞气射天宫。昨朝混战还犹可，今日争持更又凶。堪羡猴王真本事，木叉复败又逃生。</p>

<p>这大圣与惠岸战经五六十合，惠岸臂膊酸麻，不能迎敌，虚幌一幌，败阵而走。大圣也收了猴兵，安扎在洞门之外。只见天王营门外，大小天兵，接住了太子，让开大路，径入辕门，对四天王、李托塔、哪吒，气哈哈的喘息未定：“好大圣，好大圣！着实神通广大！孩儿战不过，又败阵而来也！“李天王见了心惊，即命写表求助，便差大力鬼王与木叉太子上天启奏。</p>

<p>二人当时不敢停留，闯出天罗地网，驾起瑞霭祥云。须臾，径至通明殿下，见了四大天师，引至灵霄宝殿，呈上表章。惠岸又见菩萨施礼。菩萨道：“你打探的如何？”惠岸道：“始领命到花果山，叫开天罗地网门，见了父亲，道师父差命之意。父王道：‘昨日与那猴王战了一场，止捉得他虎豹狼虫之类，更未捉他一个猴精。’正讲间。他又索战，是弟子使铁棍与他战经五六十合，不能取胜，败走回营。父亲因此差大力鬼王同弟子上界求助。”菩萨低头思忖。</p>

<p></p>

<p>却说玉帝拆开表章，见有求助之言，笑道：“叵耐这个猴精，能有多大手段，就敢敌过十万天兵！李天王又来求助，却将那路神兵助之？”言未毕，观音合掌启奏：“陛下宽心，贫僧举一神，可擒这猴。”玉帝道：“所举者何神？”菩萨道：“乃陛下令甥显圣二郎真君，见居灌洲灌江口，享受下方香火。他昔日曾力诛六怪，又有梅山兄弟与帐前一千二百草头神，神通广大。奈他只是听调不听宣，陛下可降一道调兵旨意，着他助力，便可擒也。”玉帝闻言，即传调兵的旨意，就差大力鬼王赍调。那鬼王领了旨，即驾起云，径至灌江口，不消半个时辰，直至真君之庙。早有把门的鬼判，传报至里道：“外有天使，捧旨而至。”二郎即与众弟兄，出门迎接旨意，焚香开读。旨意上云：</p>

<p>花果山妖猴齐天大圣作乱。因在宫偷桃、偷酒、偷丹，搅乱蟠桃大会，见着十万天兵，一十八架天罗地网，围山收伏，未曾得胜。今特调贤甥同义兄弟即赴花果山助力剿除。成功之后，高升重赏。”</p>

<p>真君大喜道：“天使请回，吾当就去拔刀相助也。”鬼王回奏不题。</p>

<p>这真君即唤梅山六兄弟，乃康、张、姚、李四太尉，郭申、直健二将军，聚集殿前道：“适才玉帝调遣我等往花果山收降妖猴，同去去来。”众兄弟俱忻然愿往。即点本部神兵，驾鹰牵犬，搭弩张弓，纵狂风，霎时过了东洋大海，径至花果山。见那天罗地网，密密层层，不能前进，因叫道：“把天罗地网的神将听着：吾乃二郎显圣真君，蒙玉帝调来擒拿妖猴者，快开营门放行。”一时，各神一层层传入，四大天王与李天王俱出辕门迎接。相见毕，问及胜败之事，天王将上项事备陈一遍，真君笑道：“小圣来此，必须与他斗个变化。列公将天罗地网，不要幔了顶上，只四围紧密，让我赌斗。若我输与他，不必列公相助，我自有兄弟扶持；若赢了他，也不必列公绑缚，我自有兄弟动手。只请托塔天王与我使个照妖镜，住立空中。恐他一时败阵，逃窜他方，切须与我照耀明白，勿走了他。”天王各居四维，众天兵各挨排列阵去讫。</p>

<p>这真君领着四太尉、二将军，连本身七兄弟，出营挑战，分付众将，紧守营盘，收全了鹰犬，众草头神得令。真君只到那水帘洞外，见那一群猴，齐齐整整，排作个蟠龙阵势；中军里，立一竿旗，上书“齐天大圣”四字。真君道：“那泼妖，怎么称得起齐天之职？”梅山六弟道：“且休赞叹，叫战去来。”那营口小猴见了真君，急走去报知。那猴王即掣金箍棒，整黄金甲，登步云履，按一按紫金冠，腾出营门，急睁睛观看那真君的相貌，果是清奇，打扮得又秀气。真个是——</p>

<p>仪容清俊貌堂堂，两耳垂肩目有光。头戴三山飞凤帽，身穿一领淡鹅黄。</p>

<p>缕金靴衬盘龙袜，玉带团花八宝妆。腰挎弹弓新月样，手执三尖两刃枪。</p>

<p>斧劈桃山曾救母，弹打鋋罗双凤凰。力诛八怪声名远，义结梅山七圣行。</p>

<p>心高不认天家眷，性傲归神住灌江。赤城昭惠英灵圣，显化无边号二郎。</p>

<p>大圣见了，笑嘻嘻的，将金箍棒掣起，高叫道：“你是何方小将，辄敢大胆到此挑战？”真君喝道：“你这厮有眼无珠，认不得我么！吾乃玉帝外甥，敕封昭惠灵显王二郎是也。今蒙上命，到此擒你这反天宫的弼马温猢狲，你还不知死活！”大圣道：“我记得当年玉帝妹子思凡下界，配合杨君，生一男子，曾使斧劈桃山的，是你么？我行要骂你几声，曾奈无甚冤仇；待要打你一棒，可惜了你的性命。你这郎君小辈，可急急回去，唤你四大天王出来。”真君闻言，心中大怒道：“泼猴！休得无礼！吃吾一刃！”大圣侧身躲过，疾举金箍棒，劈手相还。他两个这场好杀——</p>

<p>昭惠二郎神，齐天孙大圣，这个心高欺敌美猴王，那个面生压伏真梁栋。两个乍相逢，各人皆赌兴。从来未识浅和深，今日方知轻与重。铁棒赛飞龙，神锋如舞凤。左挡右攻，前迎后映。这阵上梅山六弟助威风，那阵上马流四将传军令。摇旗擂鼓各齐心，呐喊筛锣都助兴。两个钢刀有见机，一来一往无丝缝。金箍棒是海中珍，变化飞腾能取胜。若还身慢命该休，但要差池为蹭蹬。</p>

<p>真君与大圣斗经三百余合，不知胜负。那真君抖擞神威，摇身一变，变得身高万丈，两只手，举着三尖两刃神锋，好便似华山顶上之峰，青脸獠牙，朱红头发，恶狠狠，望大圣着头就砍，这大圣也使神通，变得与二郎身躯一样，嘴脸一般，举一条如意金箍棒，却就如昆仑顶上的擎天之柱，抵住二郎神。唬得那马、流元帅，战兢兢摇不得旌旗；崩、芭二将，虚怯怯使不得刀剑。这阵上，康、张、姚、李、郭申、直健，传号令，撒放草头神，向他那水帘洞外，纵着鹰犬，搭弩张弓，一齐掩杀。可怜冲散妖猴四健将，捉拿灵怪二三千！那些猴，抛戈弃甲，撇剑丢枪；跑的跑，喊的喊；上山的上山，归洞的归洞。好似夜猫惊宿鸟，飞洒满天星。众兄弟得胜不题。</p>

<p></p>

<p>却说真君与大圣变做法天象地的规模，正斗时，大圣忽见本营中妖猴惊散，自觉心慌，收了法象，掣棒抽身就走。真君见他败走，大步赶上道：“那里走？趁早归降，饶你性命！”大圣不恋战，只情跑起。将近洞口，正撞着康、张、姚、李四太尉、郭申、直健二将军，一齐帅众挡住道：“泼猴，那里走！”大圣慌了手脚，就把金箍棒捏做绣花针，藏在耳内，摇身一变，变作个麻雀儿，飞在树梢头钉住。那六兄弟，慌慌张张，前后寻觅不见，一齐吆喝道：“走了这猴精也，走了这猴精也！”正嚷处，真君到了问：“兄弟们，赶到那厢不见了？”众神道：“才在这里围住，就不见了。”二郎圆睁凤目观看，见大圣变了麻雀儿，钉在树上，就收了法象，撇了神锋，卸下弹弓，摇身一变，变作个饿鹰儿，抖开翅，飞将去扑打。大圣见了，搜的一翅飞起去，变作一只大鹚老，冲天而去。二郎见了，急抖翎毛，摇身一变，变作一只大海鹤，钻上云霄来旺。大圣又将身按下，入涧中，变作一个鱼儿，淬入水内。二郎赶至涧边，不见踪迹，心中暗想道：“这猢狲必然下水去也，定变作鱼虾之类。等我再变变拿他。”果一变变作个鱼鹰儿，飘荡在下溜头波面上。等待片时，那大圣变鱼儿，顺水正游，忽见一只飞禽，似青鹞，毛片不青；似鹭鸶，顶上无缨；似老鹳，腿又不红：“想是二郎变化了等我哩！”急转头，打个花就走。二郎看见道：“打花的鱼儿，似鲤鱼，尾巴不红；似鳜鱼，花鳞不见；似黑鱼，头上无星；似鲂鱼，鳃上无针。他怎么见了我就回去了，必然是那猴变的。”赶上来，刷的啄一嘴。那大圣就撺出水中，一变，变作一条水蛇，游近岸，钻入草中。二郎因旺他不着，他见水响中，见一条蛇撺出去，认得是大圣，急转身，又变了一只朱绣顶的灰鹤，伸着一个长嘴，与一把尖头铁钳子相似，径来吃这水蛇。水蛇跳一跳，又变做一只花鸨，木木樗樗的，立在蓼汀之上。二郎见他变得低贱——花鸨乃鸟中至贱至淫之物，不拘鸾、凤、鹰、鸦都与交群，故此不去拢傍，即现原身，走将去，取过弹弓拽满，一弹子把他打个蝤踵。那大圣趁着机会，滚下山崖，伏在那里又变，变了一座土地庙儿，大张着口，似个庙门，牙齿变做门扇，舌头变做菩萨，眼睛变做窗棂。只有尾巴不好收拾，竖在后面，变做一根旗竿。真君赶到崖下，不见打倒的鸨鸟，只有一间小庙，急睁凤眼，仔细看之，见旗竿立在后面，笑道：是这猢狲了！他今又在那里哄我。我也曾见庙宇，更不曾见一个旗竿竖在后面的。断是这畜生弄喧！他若哄我进去，他便一口咬住。我怎肯进去？等我掣拳先捣窗棂，后踢门扇！”大圣听得，心惊道：“好狠，好狠！门扇是我牙齿，窗棂是我眼睛。若打了牙，捣了眼，却怎么是好？’扑的一个虎跳，又冒在空中不见。</p>

<p>真君前前后后乱赶，只见四太尉、二将军、一齐拥至道：“兄长，拿住大圣了么？”真君笑道：“那猴儿才自变座土地庙哄我，我正要捣他窗棂，踢他门扇，他就纵一纵，又渺无踪迹。可怪，可怪！”众皆愕然，四望更无形影。真君道：“兄弟们在此看守巡逻，等我上去寻他。”急纵身驾云起在半空，见那李天王高擎照妖镜，与哪吒住立云端，真君道：“天王，曾见那猴王么？”天王道：“不曾上来。我这里照着他哩。”真君把那赌变化、弄神通、拿群猴一事说毕，却道：“他变庙宇，正打处，就走了。”李天王闻言，又把照妖镜四方一照，呵呵的笑道：“真君，快去，快去！那猴使了个隐身法，走去营围，往你那灌江口去也。”二郎听说，即取神锋，回灌江口来赶。</p>

<p></p>

<p>却说那大圣已至灌江口，摇身一变，变作二郎爷爷的模样，按下云头，径入庙里，鬼判不能相认，一个个磕头迎接。他坐中间，点查香火，见李虎拜还的三牲，张龙许下的保福，赵甲求子的文书，钱丙告病的良愿。正看处，有人报：“又一个爷爷来了。”众鬼判急急观看，无不惊心。真君却道：“有个什么齐天大圣，才来这里否？”众鬼判道：“不曾见什么大圣，只有一个爷爷在里面查点哩。”真君撞进门，大圣见了，现出本相道：“郎君不消嚷，庙宇已姓孙了。”这真君即举三尖两刃神锋，劈脸就砍。那猴王使个身法，让过神锋，掣出那绣花针儿，幌一幌，碗来粗细，赶到前，对面相还。两个嚷嚷闹闹，打出庙门，半雾半云，且行且战，复打到花果山，慌得那四大天王等众提防愈紧。这康、张太尉等迎着真君，合心努力，把那美猴王围绕不题。</p>

<p>话表大力鬼王既调了真君与六兄弟提兵擒魔去后，却上界回奏。玉帝与观音菩萨、王母并众仙卿，正在灵霄殿讲话，道：“既是二郎已去赴战，这一日还不见回报。”观音合掌道：“贫僧请陛下同道祖出南天门外，亲去看看虚实如何？”玉帝道：“言之有理。”即摆驾，同道祖、观音、王母与众仙卿至南天门。，早有些天丁、力士接着。开门遥观，只见众天丁布罗网，围住四面；李天王与哪吒，擎照妖镜，立在空中；真君把大圣围绕中间，纷纷赌斗哩。菩萨开口对老君说：“贫僧所举二郎神如何？果有神通，已把那大圣围困，只是未得擒拿。我如今助他一功，决拿住他也。”老君道：“菩萨将甚兵器？怎么助他？”菩萨道：“我将那净瓶杨柳抛下去，打那猴头；即不能打死，也打个一跌，教二郎小圣好去拿他。”老君道：“你这瓶是个磁器，准打着他便好，如打不着他的头，或撞着他的铁棒，却不打碎了？你且莫动手，等我老君助他一功。”菩萨道：“你有什么兵器？”老君道：“有，有，有。”捋起衣袖，左膊上取下一个圈子，说道：“这件兵器，乃锟钢抟炼的，被我将还丹点成，养就一身灵气，善能变化，水火不侵，又能套诸物；一名金钢琢，又名金钢套。当年过函关，化胡为佛，甚是亏他，早晚最可防身。等我丢下去打他一下。”话毕，自天门上往下一掼，滴流流，径落花果山营盘里，可可的着猴王头上一下。猴王只顾苦战七圣，却不知天上坠下这兵器，打中了天灵，立不稳脚，跌了一跤，爬将起来就跑，被二郎爷爷的细犬赶上，照腿肚子上一口，又扯了一跌。他睡倒在地，骂道：“这个亡人！你不去妨家长，却来咬老孙！”急翻身爬不起来，被七圣一拥按住，即将绳索捆绑，使勾刀穿了琵琶骨，再不能变化。</p>

<p>那老君收了金钢琢，请玉帝同观音、王母、众仙等，俱回灵霄殿。这下面四大天王与李天王诸神，俱收兵拔寨，近前向小圣贺喜，都道：“此小圣之功也！”小圣道：“此乃天尊洪福，众神威权，我何功之有？”康、张、姚、李道：“兄长不必多叙，且押这厮去上界见玉帝，请旨发落去也。”真君道：“贤弟，汝等未受天箓，不得面见玉帝。教天甲神兵押着，我同天王等上界回旨。你们帅众在此搜山，搜净之后，仍回灌口。待我请了赏，讨了功，回来同乐。”四太尉、二将军依言领诺。这真君与众即驾云头，唱凯歌，得胜朝天。不多时，到通明殿外。天师启奏道：“四大天王等众已捉了妖猴齐天大圣了，来此听宣。”玉帝传旨，即命大力鬼王与天丁等众，押至斩妖台，将这厮碎剁其尸。咦！正是：欺诳今遭刑宪苦，英雄气概等时休。毕竟不知那猴王性命何如，且听下回分解。
