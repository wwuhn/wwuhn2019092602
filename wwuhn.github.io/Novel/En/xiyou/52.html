<P>In Vain Does the Mind-Ape Use a Thousand Tricks</P>
<P>Fire and Water Fail to Harm the Demon</P>
</div>
<P>The story tells how the Great Sage Equaling Heaven went empty-handed and beaten to sit down behind Mount Jindou, tears streaming from both eyes.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; he called out, &#8220;I had hoped</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As Lord Buddha graciously brought us together</P>
<P>To go on to live with you, Master, for ever,</P>
<P>With you to train and to learn to be free.</P>
<P>Of the favours received ever mindful I'd be.</P>
<P>Our hearts were both joined and our fates were entwined;</P>
<P>As we studied the Way we shared the same mind.</P>
<P>I never expected to be at my wit's end</P>
<P>Unable to win with no stick in my hand.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Just when he was in the depths of misery Monkey thought, &#8220;That fiend knew who I was. I remember him saying something about the sort of skill that made havoc in Heaven when he was praising me during the fight. That means he can't be a common mortal monster: he must be an evil star from Heaven come down to earth for love of worldly things. I don't know where he come down from, so I'd better go up to Heaven to make some inquiries.&#8221;</P>
<P>Only then did Monkey start using his mind and taking the initiative again. At once he somersaulted up on an auspicious cloud, going straight to the Southern Gate of Heaven, where he looked up to see the Broad-visioned Heavenly King Virupaksa bowing to him in greeting and saying, &#8220;Where are you going, Great Sage?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's something I must see the Jade Emperor about,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It is my turn today to supervise the Southern Gate of Heaven,&#8221; Virupaksa replied, and before he could finish the four marshals Ma, Zhao, Wen and Guan bowed and said, &#8220;Great Sage, we failed to greet you. Will you have some tea?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm busy,&#8221; Monkey replied, and taking his leave of Virupaksa and the four marshals he went in through the gate and headed straight for the Hall of Miraculous Mist, where the four Heavenly Teachers Zhang Daoling, Ge Xianweng, Xu Jingyang and Qiu Hongji, the Six Officers of the Southern Dipper and the Seven Originals of the Northern Dipper all raised their hands in greeting to him in front of the palace hall.</P>
<P>&#8220;For what purpose are you here, Great Sage?&#8221; they asked, adding. &#8220;Have you yet finished escorting the Tang Priest?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's too early to be talking like that yet,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;It is a very long journey with many a demon along the way and we've only completed half of it. At present we are in trouble at the Jindou Gave in Mount Jindou, where a rhinoceros spirit has grabbed my master and taken him into the cave. When I went there and fought him he had such tremendous magic powers that he seized my gold-banded cudgel. It's impossible for me to capture him. That's why I've come to accuse the Jade Emperor of lax supervision.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're as wild and wicked as ever, you ape,&#8221; said Xu Jingyang with a smile.</P>
<P>&#8220;No I'm not,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;I've spoken bluntly all my life as it's the only way to get anywhere.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's enough of this talking,&#8221; said Heavenly Teacher Zhang Daoling. &#8220;We will report your arrival.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Thank you very much,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>The four Heavenly Teachers reported all this to the Hall of Miraculous Mist and then took Monkey to the jade steps to the throne. Monkey make a loud &#8220;re-e-er&#8221; of respect then said, &#8220;Well, old man, I'm here to bother you. I won't bore you with all the dangers of escorting the Tang Priest to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven, but we've now reached the Jindou Cave on Mount Jindou where a rhinoceros demon has captured the Tang Priest and taken him to his cave. I don't know whether the demon's planning to steam, boil or dry him. When I went to the cave and fought him he knew who I was, and he really does have miraculous powers. He's taken my gold-banded cudgel, so I can't capture him. I think he must be an evil star from Heaven gone down to earth for the love of worldly things, which is why I've come here to submit a request. I beg Your Celestial Majesty in your mercy and perception to order an inspection of the evil stars and to send troops to capture the demon. I'm shaking with fear of Your Majesty.&#8221; He then made a deep bow and added, &#8220;I beg to submit this report.&#8221;</P>
<P>Ge Xianweng, who was standing at the side of the hall, smiled as he said, &#8220;Why is it that you were recalcitrant before but are respectful now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's not that,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;not that at all. I haven't become respectful. It's just that I don't have my cudgel today.&#8221;</P>
<P>Having heard Monkey's memorial the Jade Emperor sent an order straight to the star officer Kehan: &#8220;Please inspect all the stars in all the heavens and find out if any of the divine kings of any of the constellations have gone down to earth out of love for worldly things. Report back afterwards.&#8221; Having been given this command the True Lord Kehan went off with the Great Sage to make his inspection. First they went to see the divine kings and the officials at the four gates of Heaven. Then they inspected all the True Ones within the Three Little Enclosures; the Thunder Officers Tao, Zhang, Xin, Deng, Gou, Bi, Pang and Liu; and the Thirty-three Heavens, every one of which was in place. Next they checked the twenty-eight zodiacal constellations: Horn, Gullet, Base, Chamber, Orion, Tail, and Winnower in the East; Dipper, Ox, Woman, Barrens, Roof, House and Wall to the West; and the constellations of the North and South as well; but every constellation was peacefully in its place. They inspected the Seven Powers of Sun, Moon, Water, Fire, Wood, Metal, and Earth; and the Four Others&#8212;Rahu, Ketu, the Gases and the Comets. None of the stars in the sky had gone down to earth for love of worldly things.</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;my journey to the Hall of Miraculous Mist was for nothing. I've disturbed His Jade Majesty&#8212;it was most inconvenient of me. You had better go and report back. I'll be waiting here for your reply.&#8221; The True Lord Kehan did as he had been told, and Monkey began a long wait. He made up a poem to record his feelings that went,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Pure winds, a cloudless sky, and blissful peace;</P>
<P>Calm gods, bright shining stars, and blessings clear.</P>
<P>Still is the Milky Way; Heaven's troubles cease;</P>
<P>Throughout the world no sounds of war we hear.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The True Lord Kehan reported back to the Jade Emperor on his thorough inspection: &#8220;No star or constellation in the sky is missing. All the regional gods ad officers are present, and nobody has gone down to earth for love of worldly things.&#8221; Having heard this report the Jade Emperor ordered that Sun Wukong was to select some heavenly generals to take down to earth to catch the demon.</P>
<P>When the four Heavenly Teachers had been given this order they left the Hall of Miraculous Mist and said to Monkey, &#8220;Great Sage, the Jade Emperor in his generosity orders you to select some heavenly generals to take down to earth to catch the demon as none of the stars has gone down there for love of worldly things.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey bowed down and thought, &#8220;Most of the heavenly generals are not as good as I am: few are any better. When I made havoc in Heaven the Jade Emperor sent a hundred thousand of his heavenly soldiers who spread out heaven-and-earth nets, but not one of those commanders dared to fight it out with me. The only one who was a match for me was the Little Sage Erlang he sent later. That demon's powers are as good as mine, so how will I ever be able to beat him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Times have changed,&#8221; said the Heavenly Teacher Xu Jingyang. &#8220;As the saying goes, everything can always be beaten by something. Would you dare to disobey an imperial edict? Choose some heavenly generals according to your illustrious judgement and don't waste time: it could be disastrous.</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;I am very grateful to His Majesty for his kindness, and I would not dare disobey his commands. Besides, I don't want to have made this journey for nothing. So please ask the Jade Emperor to send Heavenly King Li the Pagoda-carrier and Prince Nezha. They have demon-subduing weapons, so let's see what happens if they go down to earth and fight that fiend. If they can catch him I'll be in luck, and if they can't we'll have to think again.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Heavenly Teacher reported this to the Jade Emperor, who ordered Heavenly King Li and his son Prince Nezha to take their heavenly troops to Help Monkey. The Heavenly King obediently went to see Monkey, who said to the Heavenly Teacher, &#8220;I am extremely grateful to the Jade Emperor for sending the Heavenly King. There is another request I would like you to pass on. I would like two thunder gods to stand in the clouds while the Heavenly King is fighting the demon and kill him by throwing thunder splinters at his head. This would be a very good method.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Splendid, splendid,&#8221; said the Heavenly Teacher, and he reported this request to the Jade Emperor, who then ordered the Office of the Nine Heavens to send the thunder gods Deng Hua and Zhang Fan to help Heavenly King Li capture the demon. They then went out through the Southern Gate of Heaven with the Heavenly King and the Great Sage.</P>
<P>They were soon there. &#8220;This is Mount Jindou,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;and the Jindou Cave is in it. I would like you gentlemen to decide which of you is going to be the first to challenge the demon to battle.&#8221; The Heavenly King brought his cloud to a stop and encamped his troops under the Southern slopes of the mountain.</P>
<P>&#8220;As you know, Great Sage,&#8221; he said, &#8220;my boy Nezha has put down the demons in ninety-six different caves, is very good at transformation, and always carries his demon-subduing weapons around with him. He should go into battle first.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's right,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'll take him with me.&#8221;</P>
<P>The prince summoned up his martial prowess, leapt to the mountaintop with the Great Sage, and went straight to the entrance to the cave, where they found the doors tightly closed and not an evil spirit to be seen by the rock-face. &#8220;Vicious fiend,&#8221; shouted Monkey, going up to the doors, &#8220;open up at once and give me back my master.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the little devils guarding the doors saw this they hurried back to report, &#8220;Your Majesty, Sun the Novice has a little boy with him and he's challenging you to battle outside the doors.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've got his gold-banded cudgel,&#8221; the demon king said, &#8220;and he'd find it hard to fight me empty-handed, so I suppose he must have found some reinforcements. Fetch my weapons!&#8221; He then went outside to look, brandishing his spear. The little boy was a pure and remarkable sight, and full of strength and vigor. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>His face was like the moon when it is full,</P>
<P>Red lips, a square-cut mouth, and silver teeth.</P>
<P>His eye shot lightning from their fearsome pupils;</P>
<P>Over his broad and fine-hued brow were tufts of hair.</P>
<P>His sash danced in the wind like tongues of flame;</P>
<P>A silken gown gleamed golden in the sun.</P>
<P>Bright rings held a bronze mirror at his chest,</P>
<P>And precious armor set off well his warrior's boots.</P>
<P>Tiny in body, but mighty in his voice,</P>
<I>
<P>Terrible Nezha, protector of the faith.
</I>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're Heavenly King Li's third son, Prince Nezha,&#8221; said the demon with a smile. &#8220;Why have you come shouting at my door?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Because you have made trouble, vicious fiend, by harming the holy monk from the East. I'm here to arrest you at the command of the Jade Emperor.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm sure Sun Wukong must have asked you here,&#8221; said the demon king in a great fury. &#8220;Yes, I'm the demon who's got the holy monk. I wonder what fighting skills you've got, little boy, if you dare to talk such nonsense. Stay where you are and see how you like my spear.&#8221;</P>
<P>The prince met the thrust at once with his demon-beheading sword. Once the two of them had come to blows the battle began. Monkey rushed round the mountain shouting, &#8220;Where are the thunder gods? Hurry up and strike the fiend with your thunder splinters to help the prince subdue him.&#8221;</P>
<P>The thunder gods Deng and Zhang stepped at once on their clouds and were just about to strike when Prince Nezha used magic to give himself three heads and six arms that wielded six weapons with which he hacked at the monster. The demon king then gave himself three heads and six arms too, holding three long spears with which he parried them. The prince next used his demon-subduing dharma power and threw his six weapons up into the air. What were the six weapons? The demon-beheading sword, the demon-hacking cutlass, the demon-binding rope, the demon-quelling pestle, the embroidered ball and the fire-wheel.</P>
<P>Nezha shouted &#8220;Change!&#8221; and each one of them became ten, each ten a hundred, each hundred a thousand, and each thousand ten thousand of the same weapons that flew at the demon like a hailstorm. The demon king was not afraid in the least. Bringing out his gleaming white ring he threw it into the air with a shout of &#8220;Catch them!&#8221; and as it came whistling down it trapped all the six different kinds of weapons, so terrifying Nezha that he fled for his life empty-handed. The demon king returned to his cave in triumph.</P>
<P>When the two thunder gods saw this from up in the sky they smiled to themselves and said, &#8220;It's a good thing we realized how things were going and didn't throw our thunder splinters. If he'd caught them too we'd never have dared report back to the Heavenly Honoured Ones.&#8221; The pair of them landed their clouds and went with the prince to the Southern slope of the mountain.</P>
<P>&#8220;The demon king really has got enormous powers,&#8221; they told Heavenly King Li.</P>
<P>&#8220;The wretched demon's magic powers are nothing much,&#8221; said Monkey with a laugh, &#8220;apart from that terrible ring. I wonder what sort of treasure it is and why it can catch everything when it's thrown into the air.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't have a shred of humanity in you, Great Sage,&#8221; said Nezha angrily. &#8220;We're thoroughly upset after being beaten, and all for your sake too. What have you got to laugh about?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You may be upset, but what makes you imagine I'm not?&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;I'm at my wit's end, and as I can't cry about it, laughing's the only thing I can do.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How are we going to bring all this to an end?&#8221; the Heavenly King asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;You lot can make whatever plans you like,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;but we can only capture him with what his ring can't catch.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The best things his ring can't catch are water and fire,&#8221; said Heavenly King Li. &#8220;As the saying goes, water and fire show no mercy.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Sit still here while I go up to Heaven again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What for?&#8221; the two thunder gods asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;This time I won't bother with a memorial to the Jade Emperor,&#8221; said Brother Monkey. &#8220;I'll go straight in through the Southern Gate of Heaven to the Palace of Crimson Splendor to ask Yinghuo, the Star Lord of Fire, to come here and start a fire that will burn the demon and perhaps even reduce his ring to ashes so that we can capture him. Then you can have your weapons back and return to Heaven and my master can be saved.&#8221;</P>
<P>The prince was greatly cheered up to hear this. &#8220;Please don't lose any time, Great Sage,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and get back as soon as you can. We'll wait here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey set his auspicious light going again and went straight back to the Southern Gate of Heaven, where Virupaksa and the four generals met him and asked, &#8220;Why are you back again, Great Sage?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Heavenly King Li sent Prince Nezha into battle,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;but in their first fight the demon king took all his six weapons. I now want to go to the Palace of Crimson Splendor to ask the Star Lord of Fire to help us in the fight.&#8221; The four generals let him in, not daring to delay him any longer.</P>
<P>When he reached the Palace of Crimson Splendor the gods of fire all went in to report, &#8220;Sun Wukong is here to see you, my lord.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Star Lord of Fire of the South straightened up his clothes and came out to greet him with the words, &#8220;Kehan was here to inspect us yesterday, and nobody here is longing for earthly things.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I know,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Heavenly King Li and Prince Nezha have been defeated in battle and lost their weapons, which is why I have come here to ask for your help.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Nezha is the God of the Third Altar, the Seas, who first made his name by subduing ninety-six caves of demons,&#8221; the Star Lord of Fire replied. &#8220;His magical powers are tremendous, so if he can't subdue the fiend what hope would I have of doing so?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've discussed it with Heavenly King Li,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Water and fire are the most powerful things in heaven and earth. That fiend has a ring that can catch things. I don't know what treasure it is. As they say that fire can destroy everything I've come here to ask you, Star Lord, to lead your fire forces down to the mortal world to burn up that evil monster and rescue my master.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the Star Lord of Fire heard this he mustered his divine troops and went with Monkey to the Southern slopes of Mount Jindou, where he exchanged greetings with the Heavenly King and the thunder gods. &#8220;Great Sage Sun,&#8221; said Heavenly King Li, &#8220;call that demon out again and I'll start fighting him. When he throws his ring I'll get out of the way and the Star Lord can lead his forces to burn him up.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'll go with you.&#8221; The Fire Star Lord stood with Prince Nezha and two thunder gods on a high peak to challenge the demon to battle.</P>
<P>When the Great Sage reached the mouth of the Jindou Cave he shouted, &#8220;Open up! Give me my master back at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Sun Wukong's back,&#8221; the little devils reported with urgency, and the demon led his horde out of the cave to say to Monkey, &#8220;Impudent ape, what soldiers have you brought here?&#8221;</P>
<P>Heavenly King Li, the Pagoda-carrier, came forward to shout back, &#8220;Vicious monster, do you know who I am&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Heavenly King Li,&#8221; replied the demon with a laugh, &#8220;no doubt you want to avenge your distinguished son and get his weapons back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I want my revenge and his weapons,&#8221; replied the Heavenly King, &#8220;and I'm also going to catch you and rescue the Tang Priest. Stay where you are while I get you with my sword.&#8221; The demon dodged the cut and thrust back with his spear. The two of them fought a magnificent fight in front of the cave. Just watch:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Heavenly King hacked with his sword,</P>
<P>The demon's spear parried.</P>
<P>The sword gleamed cold and breathed out fire,</P>
<P>The sharp spear belched out baleful clouds.</P>
<P>One was the monster who had grown up in Jindou Cave;</P>
<P>The other had been sent from the Hall of Miraculous Mist.</P>
<P>One wished to use his might to oppress the dharma nature;</P>
<P>One was employing his greatness to rescue the priest.</P>
<P>The Heavenly King's powers made sand and gravel fly,</P>
<P>The demon fighting back stirred up the dust.</P>
<P>The dust cast heaven and earth in darkness,</P>
<P>The sand and gravel made seas and livers turbid.</P>
<P>The two of them struggled hard for victory</P>
<P>Because the Tang Priest wanted to see the Buddha.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Monkey saw the two of them starting to fight he jumped up to the highest peak and said to the Star Lord of Fire, &#8220;Pay attention.&#8221; Watch as the demon produces his ring again when the fight is at its fiercest. When Heavenly King Li saw this he set his auspicious light moving and fled in defeat. At once the Star Lord of Fire issued the order to his troops from his peak to release all their fire together. It was a terrifying sight:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Classic says that in the South is the essence of fire.</P>
<P>Even a single spark</P>
<P>Can burn a hundred thousand acres.</P>
<P>The might of the Star Lord</P>
<P>Could create a hundred different kinds of fire.</P>
<P>He had fire spears, fire swords,</P>
<P>Fire bows and crossbows,</P>
<P>And all his gods used different weapons.</P>
<P>The sky was filled with cawing crows of fire.</P>
<P>Fire horses galloped on the mountaintops.</P>
<P>Fire rats came in twos,</P>
<P>Fire dragons in pairs.</P>
<P>The fire rats coming in twos breathed flame,</P>
<P>Making a thousand miles glow red;</P>
<P>The pairs of fire dragons belched thick smoke,</P>
<P>Casting a pall of darkness all around.</P>
<P>The fire carts were brought out,</P>
<P>The fire gourds opened up.</P>
<P>When fire banners waved the skies glowed sunset-red;</P>
<P>Fire cudgels made the whole earth blaze.</P>
<P>Compared with this the charge of burning oxen was nothing;</P>
<P>This beat Zhou Yu's fire ships attacking Red Crag.</P>
<P>It was a terrible heavenly conflagration,</P>
<P>A blazing burning storm of fire.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>But the onslaught by the fire did not frighten the demon in the least. He threw his ring up into the air, and as it came whistling down it caught the fire dragons, fire horses, fire crows, fire rats, fire swords, fire spears, fire bows and fire arrows. The demon then led his troops back to his cave in victory.</P>
<P>The Fire Star Lord, holding a useless banner, called back his officers and went to sit with Heavenly King Li and the others on the Southern slope of the mountain. &#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; he said to Monkey, &#8220;I've never seen so ferocious a demon before. Now I've lost all my fire-raising equipment what am I to do?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop complaining,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile. &#8220;Will you gentlemen please sit here for a while while I go off again?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you going this time?&#8221; Heavenly King Li asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;If that fiend isn't bothered by fire I'm sure he must be vulnerable to water. As the saying goes, water defeats fire. I'm going to the Northern Gate of Heaven to ask the Star Lord of Water, the planet Mercury, to use the power of water to flood the cave and drown the demon king. Then I'll be able to return you all your things.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's a very good idea,&#8221; said the Heavenly King, &#8220;except that I'm afraid your master might be drowned too.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No problem,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Even if he is drowned I have a way that will bring him back to life. But I'm wasting your time, gentlemen, and that is quite wrong.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said the Star Lord of Fire, &#8220;please be on your way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage went straight to the Northern Gate of Heaven by his somersault cloud. He looked up to see the Heavenly King Vaisravana bowing to him and asking, &#8220;Where are you going, Great Sage Sun?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There is something about which I must see the Star Lord of Water in his Palace of Dark Vastness,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It is my turn to patrol today.&#8221; Vaisravana replied. As he was speaking the four heavenly generals Pang, Liu, Gou and Bi greeted him courteously and offered him tea.</P>
<P>&#8220;As I'm in such a hurry I won't trouble you,&#8221; said Monkey, and taking his leave of them he went straight to the Palace of Dark Vastness, where he sent all the gods of Water in to announce him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Sun Wukong, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven, is here,&#8221; they reported. As soon as he learned this the Star Lord of Water dismissed the gods of the Four Seas, the Five Lakes, the Eight Rivers, the Four Streams, the Three Great Watercourses and the Nine Tributaries, as well as all the dragon kings, then straightened his hat, tightened his belt, and went out through the gates of the palace to greet him and lead him inside.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yesterday Kehan came here on his inspection,&#8221; the Star Lord said. &#8220;He wondered if any of my Water gods had become demons because they longed for worldly things. We are checking all the gods of rivers, seas and streams but have not yet finished.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That demon king's no river god,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;He's a much more powerful spirit. The Jade Emperor sent Heavenly King Li, Prince Nezha and two thunder gods down to the lower world to capture him, but he caught Nezha's six magic weapons with a ring. So I had to go up to the Palace of Crimson Splendor to ask the Star Lord of Fire to take all his fire gods to start fires, but the fiend caught the fire dragons, fire horses and everything else with his ring. I reckon that as he isn't bothered by fire he must be vulnerable to water, which is why I've come here to ask you to deploy your water, capture the fiend for me, return the heavenly generals' weapons, and rescue my master too.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the Star Lord of Water heard this he ordered the Earl of the Yellow River to go with the Great Sage to help him. &#8220;I can carry water in this,&#8221; said the river earl, taking a white jade bowl from his sleeve.</P>
<P>&#8220;But that can't hold very much,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;How could it possibly drown the fiend?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm not lying when I tell you that this bowl can hold the waters of the Yellow River,&#8221; the earl replied. &#8220;Half a bowlful is half the river, and the whole bowlful is the whole river.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Half a bowlful will be all we need,&#8221; replied a delighted Monkey, who then took his leave of the Star God of Water and hurried out through the gates of Heaven with the Earl of the Yellow River.</P>
<P>The earl half filled his bowl in the Yellow River then went with the Great Sage to Mount Jindou, where he greeted the Heavenly King, the prince, the two thunder gods and the Star Lord of Fire, who started telling him what had happened until Monkey said, &#8220;Cut out the details. River earl, come with me. When I shout at the doors telling them to open up don't wait till the doors are open. Tip the water straight in and drown the whole den of demons. Then I'll fish out the master's body and bring him back to life.&#8221;</P>
<P>The earl did as he was told, following Monkey round the mountain to the mouth of the cave.</P>
<P>&#8220;Open up, devils,&#8221; Monkey shouted, and when they recognized his voice the little devils hurried in to report that he was back, At this the demon king went out again, brandishing his spear and taking his treasure as the doors opened with a loud noise. The river god threw all the water in his white jade bowl into the cave. Seeing it coming, the demon threw down his spear and quickly took out his ring to seal the inner doors tightly. The water then all surged noisily out again, giving Sun Wukong such a fright that he had to give an immediate somersault and leap straight back up to the mountaintop with the river god. The Heavenly King and the rest of them then stood on their clouds in front of the peak looking at the great waves of the mighty flood. It was splendid water. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A mere scoopful</P>
<P>Produces fathomless depths;</P>
<P>A divine achievement</P>
<P>Fills a hundred rivers for the general good.</P>
<P>Hear the great roaring shake the valley,</P>
<P>See the mighty waters flood the sky.</P>
<P>A sound like thunder fills the world with awe;</P>
<P>Fierce are the waves with curling crests like snow.</P>
<P>The towering waves now inundate the roads,</P>
<P>While countless billows wash against the mountains.</P>
<P>Cold they are as nephrite,</P>
<P>Rolling with the sound of strings.</P>
<P>As they crash against the rocks they scatter chips of jade;</P>
<P>The waters swirl in eddies as they ebb.</P>
<P>The current sweeps across all dips and hollows,</P>
<P>Filling ravines and joining all the streams.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The sight filled Brother Monkey with alarm. &#8220;This is terrible,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The water's flooding the peasants' fields, and going everywhere except into the demon's cave. What are we to do?&#8221; He asked the river god to put his water away at once.</P>
<P>&#8220;I can only let it out,&#8221; the earl replied. &#8220;I can't put it away again. As the saying goes, spilt water can't be picked up.&#8221; Oh dear! But as the mountain was both high and steep the water flowed down it fast and in a few moments had all gone away along gullies and ravines.</P>
<P>Some little devils leapt out from the cave and played around with great pleasure as before, shouting, yelling, shaking their fists, waving their sleeves, and brandishing their cudgels and spears. &#8220;So the water never got inside the cave at all,&#8221; said the Heavenly King. &#8220;All that effort was for nothing.&#8221; Unable to control the great anger that surged up him, Monkey charged the demon king's doors, lashing out with both fists, shouting, &#8220;Where do you think you're going? I'll get you.&#8221;</P>
<P>The terrified little devils dropped their spears and cudgels and fled back into the cave to report in fear and trembling, &#8220;Your Majesty, he's attacking again.&#8221;</P>
<P>The demon king went out through the doors, his spear at the ready, and said, &#8220;Impudent ape, you're such a hooligan. You've tried and failed to beat me several times. Even fire and water have got nowhere near me. So why are you here again? To throw your life away?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've got it the wrong way round, my boy,&#8221; said Brother Monkey. &#8220;It's not me throwing my life away, but you throwing yours away. Come here and I'll punch you one.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're just trying to be awkward, ape,&#8221; the demon king replied with a laugh. &#8220;You can use your fists, but I'll use my spear. Your skinny little fist is no bigger than a walnut. It's not even the weight of a small hammer. Very well then. I'll put my spear down and we'll try some boxing.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Well spoken,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile. &#8220;Come on then.&#8221;</P>
<P>The demon then hitched up his clothes and took up a stance with both of his fists raised. They were the size of the mallets used in oil-presses. The Great Sage spread his feet apart, summoned up his energy, and started to show his skill as he traded blows with the demon king in front of the doors of the cave, it was a splendid fight. Goodness!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>They started with a foursquare stance,</P>
<P>Kicked with pairs of flying feet.</P>
<P>Each threw with menace at the other's chest</P>
<P>Hard blows that could cut out the heart.</P>
<P>The Immortal pointing the way</P>
<P>&#8220;Lao Zi riding his crane.&#8221;</P>
<P>Terrible as the tiger when he falls on his prey,</P>
<P>Vicious as the dragons sporting in the water.</P>
<P>The demon king did a dragon roll;</P>
<P>The Great Sage fought like a roebuck with his antlers.</P>
<P>They kicked up their heels like spitting dragons,</P>
<P>Twisting their wrists like sky-supporting camels.</P>
<P>The blue lion opened its jaws,</P>
<P>The carp leapt so high he risked breaking his back.</P>
<P>Flowers were scattered around their foreheads,</P>
<P>And ropes pulled tight around their waists.</P>
<P>The wind stayed close to the fan,</P>
<P>The driving rain made blossoms fall.</P>
<P>When the demon used a &#8220;Guanyin hand&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey countered with an &#8220;arhat's foot.&#8221;</P>
<P>The longer punches were open and relaxed,</P>
<P>Not as intense as the short jabs to the body.</P>
<P>When they had fought for several dozen rounds</P>
<P>Their skills were equal; no winner had emerged.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>While the two of them fought in front of the cave Heavenly King Li and the Star Lord of Fire were shouting and clapping in encouragement and admiration. The two thunder gods and Prince Nezha led the armies of the gods to leap down by where they were fighting to help Monkey, while on the other side the devilish horde all came forward to guard their master with banners, drums, swords and cutlasses. Seeing that things were going badly Monkey pulled out a handful of hairs, scattered them in the air, and with a shout of &#8220;Change!&#8221; turned them into three or four dozen little monkeys who rushed forward and held the demon still.</P>
<P>They put their arms round his legs, grabbed him by the waist, jabbed at his eyes, and pulled his hair. The demon in his alarm pulled out his ring. When Monkey arid the Heavenly King saw him doing this they turned their clouds away and fled back to the top of the mountain to keep out of the way of the fight. As soon as the demon threw the ring into the air it came whistling down, caught the three or four dozen little monkeys who were hairs transformed and turned them back into their original form. The demon took them into the cave when he led his troops back in triumph, shut the doors and celebrated.</P>
<P>&#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; said Prince Nezha, &#8220;you really are a tough guy. That was a superb display of boxing, as skilful as putting embroidery on brocade. And by magically dividing yourself up you showed him how good you are.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You gentlemen were all watching from here,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile. &#8220;How did the demon's technique compare with mine?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;His boxing was slack and his footwork slow,&#8221; said Heavenly King Li, &#8220;where you were neat and quick. When he saw us going he was worried, and when you used your self-dividing magic he was panicked, which was why he had to use his ring magic.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The demon king would be easy enough to deal with,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;if it weren't for his ring. That's hard one to beat.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If we're to beat him,&#8221; said the Star Lord of Fire to the Earl of the Yellow River, &#8220;we have to get that treasure. We'll be able to capture him then.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But how else are we to get it apart from by stealing it?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>The two thunder gods laughed at this and said, &#8220;If we're going to do him the honour of stealing it there's nobody to compare with the Great Sage. When he made havoc in Heaven he stole imperial wine, magic peaches, dragon liver, phoenix bone-marrow and even Lord Lao Zi's elixir. That was some skill! Now he ought to be using it to get that ring.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You are flattering me,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you are flattering me. You'd better sit here while I go and spy things out.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage sprang down from the peak and made his way stealthily to the mouth of the cave where he shook himself and turned into a most elegant fly. Look at him:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He had wings just as fine as membranes of bamboo,</P>
<P>A body as small as a plum blossom's heart,</P>
<P>His hands and his feet barely thicker than hairs,</P>
<P>And eyes full of lights that both sparkle and dart:</P>
<P>He follows his nose when he smells something good,</P>
<P>And rides on the wind as he flies at great speed.</P>
<P>The scales would not move if he come to be weighed,</P>
<I>
<P>And yet he's a lovable true friend in need.
</I>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He flew quietly to the doors and crawled in through the narrow gap between them to see all the devils young and old dancing or singing in ranks on either side while the demon king sat on a high dais. Before him were set snakemeat, deer jerky, bears' paws, camels' humps, wild vegetables from the mountain and fruit. He had a celadon jug of wine as well as some delicious-smelling koumiss and coconut toddy, all of which he was drinking freely by the large bowlful. Monkey landed among the little devils and turned himself into a badger spirit. He inched his way nearer to the throne, but even after taking a long look he could not make out at all where the treasure was hidden. He quickly withdrew and went round behind the throne, where he saw hanging high from the ceiling in the rear hall the fire dragons groaning and the fire horses whinnying. He looked up to spy his gold-banded cudgel leaning against the Eastern wall. This made him so happy that his heart had an itch he could not scratch, and forgetting his disguise he went over, picked the cudgel up, resumed his own appearance, tried out some movements with it, and started to fight his way straight out of the cave. All the devils shook with terror, and there was nothing the demon king could do about it as Monkey opened up a trail of blood, pushing three over here and pulling a couple down there as he went straight out through the front doors. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The demon was unready in his pride;</P>
<P>The cudgel went back to its owner's side.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know whether all turned out for good or for ill, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>心猿空用千般</p>
<p>水火无功难炼魔</p>
</div>
<p>话说齐天大圣，空着手败了阵，来坐于金皘山后，扑梭梭两眼滴泪，叫道：“师父啊！指望和你：佛恩有德有和融，同幼同生意莫穷。同住同修同解脱，同慈同念显灵功。同缘同相心真契，同见同知道转通。岂料如今无主杖，空拳赤脚怎兴隆！”大圣凄惨多时，心中暗想道：“那妖精认得我。我记得他在阵上夸奖道：‘真个是闹天宫之类！’这等啊，决不是凡间怪物，定然是天上凶星。想因思凡下界，又不知是那里降下来魔头，且须上界去查勘查勘。”</p>

<p>行者这才是以心问心，自张自主，急翻身纵起祥云，直至南天门外，忽抬头见广目天王，当面迎着长揖道：“大圣何往？”</p>

<p>行者道：“有事要见玉帝，你在此何干？”广目道：今日轮该巡视南天门。”说未了，又见那马赵温关四大元帅作礼道：“大圣，失迎，请待茶。”行者道：“有事哩。”遂辞了广目并四元帅，径入南天门里，直至灵霄殿外，果又见张道陵、葛仙翁、许旌阳、丘弘济四天师并南斗六司、北斗七元都在殿前迎着行者，一齐起手道：“大圣如何到此？”又问：“保唐僧之功完否？”行者道：“早哩早哩！路遥魔广，才有一半之功，见如今阻住在金皘山金皘洞。</p>

<p>有一个兕怪，把唐师父拿于洞里，是老孙寻上门与他交战一场，那厮的神通广大，把老孙的金箍棒抢去了，因此难缚魔王。</p>

<p>疑是上界那个凶星思凡下界，又不知是那里降来的魔头，老孙因此来寻寻玉帝，问他个钳束不严。”许旌阳笑道：“这猴头还是如此放刁！”行者道：“不是放刁，我老孙一生是这口儿紧些，才寻的着个头儿。”张道陵道：“不消多说，只与他传报便了。”</p>

<p>行者道：“多谢多谢！”当时四天师传奏灵霄，引见玉陛。行者朝上唱个大喏道：“老官儿，累你累你！我老孙保护唐僧往西天取经，一路凶多吉少，也不消说。于今来在金山兜山金山兜洞，有一兕怪，把唐僧拿在洞里，不知是要蒸要煮要晒。是老孙寻上他门，与他交战，那怪却就有些认得老孙，卓是神通广大，把老孙的金箍棒抢去，因此难缚妖魔。疑是上天凶星思凡下界，为此老孙特来启奏，伏乞天尊垂慈洞鉴，降旨查勘凶星，发兵收剿妖魔，老孙不胜战栗屏营之至！”却又打个深躬道：“以闻。”旁有葛仙翁笑道：“猴子是何前倨后恭？”行者道：“不敢不敢！不是甚前倨后恭，老孙于今是没棒弄了。”</p>

<p>彼时玉皇天尊闻奏，即忙降旨可韩司知道：“既如悟空所奏，可随查诸天星斗，各宿神王，有无思凡下界，随即复奏施行以闻。”可韩丈人真君领旨，当时即同大圣去查。先查了四天门门上神王官吏；次查了三微垣垣中大小群真；又查了雷霆官将陶张辛邓，苟毕庞刘；最后才查三十三天，天天自在；又查二十八宿：东七宿角亢氏房参尾箕，西七宿斗牛女虚危室壁，南七宿，北七宿，宿宿安宁；又查了太阳太阴，水火木金土七政；罗睺计都噹孛四余。满天星斗，并无思凡下界。行者道：“既是如此，我老孙也不消上那灵霄宝殿，打搅玉皇大帝，深为不便。你自回旨去罢，我只在此等你回话便了。”那可韩丈人真君依命。</p>

<p>孙行者等候良久，作诗纪兴曰：“风清云霁乐升平，神静星明显瑞祯。河汉安宁天地泰，五方八极偃戈旌。”</p>

<p>那可韩司丈人真君，历历查勘，回奏玉帝道：“满天星宿不少，各方神将皆存，并无思凡下界者。”玉帝闻奏：“着孙悟空挑选几员天将，下界擒魔去也。”四大天师奉旨意，即出灵霄宝殿，对行者道：“大圣啊，玉帝宽恩，言天宫无神思凡，着你挑选几员天将擒魔去哩。”行者低头暗想道：“天上将不如老孙者多，胜似老孙者少。想我闹天宫时，玉帝遣十万天兵，布天罗地网，更不曾有一将敢与我比手。向后来，调了小圣二郎，方是我的对手。如今那怪物手段又强似老孙，却怎么得能彀取胜？”许旌阳道：“此一时，彼一时，大不同也。常言道一物降一物哩，你好违了旨意？但凭高见，选用天将，勿得迟疑误事。”行者道：</p>

<p>“既然如此，深感上恩。果是不好违旨。一则老孙又不可空走这遭，烦旌阳转奏玉帝，只教托塔李天王与哪吒太子，他还有几件降妖兵器，且下界与那怪见一仗，以看如何。果若能擒得他，是老孙之幸；若不能，那时再作区处。”</p>

<p>真个那天师启奏了玉帝，玉帝即令李天王父子，率领众部天兵，与行者助力。那天王即奉旨来会行者，行者又对天师道：</p>

<p>“蒙玉帝遣差天王，谢谢不尽。还有一事，再烦转达：但得两个雷公使用，等天王战斗之时，教雷公在云端里下个雷捎，照顶门上锭死那妖魔，深为良计也。”天师笑道：“好！好！好！”天师又奏玉帝，传旨教九天府下点邓化、张蕃二雷公，与天王合力缚妖救难。遂与天王、孙大圣径下南天门外。</p>

<p>顷刻而到，行者道：“此山便是金皘山，山中间乃是金皘洞。列位商议，却教那个先去索战？”天王停下云头，扎住天兵在于山南坡下，道：“大圣素知小儿哪吒，曾降九十六洞妖魔，善能变化，随身有降妖兵器，须教他先去出阵。”行者道：“既如此，等老孙引太子去来。”那太子抖擞雄威，与大圣跳在高山，径至洞口，但见那洞门紧闭，崖下无精。行者上前高叫：“泼魔！</p>

<p>快开门！还我师父来也！”那洞里把门的小妖看见，急报道：“大王，孙行者领着一个小童男，在门前叫战哩。”那魔王道：“这猴子铁棒被我夺了，空手难争，想是请得救兵来也。”叫：“取兵器！”魔王绰枪在手，走到门外观看，那小童男，生得相貌清奇，十分精壮。真个是：玉面娇容如满月，朱唇方口露银牙。眼光掣电睛珠暴，额阔凝霞发髻髽。绣带舞风飞彩焰，锦袍映日放金花。环绦灼灼攀心镜，宝甲辉辉衬战靴。身小声洪多壮丽，三天护教恶哪吒。魔王笑道：“你是李天王第三个孩儿，名唤做哪吒太子，却如何到我这门前呼喝？”太子道：“因你这泼魔作乱，困害东土圣僧，奉玉帝金旨，特来拿你！”魔王大怒道：“你想是孙悟空请来的。我就是那圣僧的魔头哩！量你这小儿曹有何武艺，敢出浪言！不要走！吃吾一枪！”这太子使斩妖剑，劈手相迎。他两个搭上手，却才赌斗，那大圣急转山坡，叫：“雷公何在？快早去，着妖魔下个雷捎，助太子降伏来也！”邓张二公，即踏云光，正欲下手，只见那太子使出法来，将身一变，变作三头六臂，手持六般兵器，望妖魔砍来，那魔王也变作三头六臂，三柄长枪抵住。这太子又弄出降妖法力，将六般兵器抛将起去，是那六般兵器？却是砍妖剑、斩妖刀、缚妖索、降魔杵、绣球、火轮儿，大叫一声“变！”一变十，十变百，百变千，千变万，都是一般兵器，如骤雨冰雹，纷纷密密，望妖魔打将去。那魔王公然不惧，一只手取出那白森森的圈子来，望空抛起，叫声“着！”唿喇的一下，把六般兵器套将下来，慌得那哪吒太子赤手逃生，魔王得胜而回。</p>

<p>邓张二雷公，在空中暗笑道：“早是我先看头势，不曾放了雷捎，假若被他套将去，却怎么回见天尊？”二公按落云头，与太子来山南坡下对李天王道：“妖魔果神通广大！”悟空在旁笑道：“那厮神通也只如此，争奈那个圈子利害。不知是甚么宝贝，丢起来善套诸物。”哪吒恨道：“这大圣甚不成人！我等折兵败阵，十分烦恼，都只为你，你反喜笑何也！”行者道：“你说烦恼，终然我老孙不烦恼？我如今没计奈何，哭不得，所以只得笑也。”天王道：“似此怎生结果？”行者道：“凭你等再怎计较，只是圈子套不去的，就可拿住他了。”天王道：“套不去者，惟水火最利。常言道，水火无情。”行者闻言道：“说得有理！你且稳坐在此，待老孙再上天走走来。”邓、张二公道：“又去做甚的？”行者道：“老孙这去，不消启奏玉帝，只到南天门里上彤华宫，请荧惑火德星君来此放火，烧那怪物一场，或者连那圈子烧做灰烬，捉住妖魔。一则取兵器还汝等归天，二则可解脱吾师之难。”太子闻言甚喜，道：“不必迟疑，请大圣早去早来，我等只在此拱候。”</p>

<p>行者纵起祥光，又至南天门外，那广目与四将迎道：“大圣如何又来？”行者道：“李天王着太子出师，只一阵，被那魔王把六件兵器捞了去了。我如今要到彤华宫请火德星君助阵哩。”</p>

<p>四将不敢久留，让他进去。至彤华宫，只见那火部众神，即入报道：“孙悟空欲见主公。”那南方三噹火德星君，整衣出门迎进道：“昨日可韩司查点小宫，更无一人思凡。”行者道：“已知，但李天王与太子败阵，失了兵器，特来请你救援救援。”星君道：</p>

<p>“那哪吒乃三坛海会大神，他出身时，曾降九十六洞妖魔，神通广大，若他不能，小神又怎敢望也？”行者道：“因与李天王计议，天地间至利者，惟水火也。那怪物有一个圈子，善能套人的物件，不知是甚么宝贝，故此说火能灭诸物，特请星君领火部到下方纵火烧那妖魔，救我师父一难。”火德星君闻言，即点本部神兵，同行者到金皘山南坡下，与天王、雷公等相见了。天王道：“孙大圣，你还去叫那厮出来，等我与他交战，待他拿动圈子，我却闪过，教火德帅众烧他。”行者笑道：“正是，我和你去来。”火德共太子、邓、张二公立于高峰之上，与他挑战。</p>

<p>这大圣到了金皘洞口，叫声“开门！快早还我师父！”那妖又急通报道：“孙悟空又来了！”那魔帅众出洞，见了行者道：</p>

<p>“你这泼猴，又请了甚么兵来耶？”这壁厢转上托塔天王，喝道：</p>

<p>“泼魔头！认得我么？”魔王笑道：“李天王，想是要与你令郎报仇，欲讨兵器么？”天王道：“一则报仇要兵器，二来是拿你救唐僧！不要走！吃吾一刀！”那怪物侧身躲过，挺长枪，随手相迎。</p>

<p>他两个在洞前，这场好杀！你看那：天王刀砍，妖怪枪迎。刀砍霜光喷烈火，枪迎锐气迸愁云。一个是金皘山生成的恶怪，一个是灵霄殿差下的天神。那一个因欺禅性施威武，这一个为救师灾展大伦。天王使法飞沙石，魔怪争强播土尘。播土能教天地暗，飞沙善着海江浑。两家努力争功绩，皆为唐僧拜世尊。</p>

<p>那孙大圣，见他两个交战，即转身跳上高峰，对火德星君道：“三噹用心者！”你看那个妖魔与天王正斗到好处，却又取出圈子来，天王看见，即拨祥光，败阵而走。这高峰上火德星君，忙传号令，教众部火神，一齐放火。这一场真个利害。好火：</p>

<p>经云“南方者火之精也。”虽星星之火，能烧万顷之田；乃三噹之威，能变百端之火。今有火枪、火刀、火弓、火箭，各部神祇，所用不一，但见那半空中，火鸦飞噪；满山头，火马奔腾。双双赤鼠，对对火龙。双双赤鼠喷烈焰，万里通红；对对火龙吐浓烟，千方共黑。火车儿推出，火葫芦撒开。火旗摇动一天霞，火棒搅行盈地燎。说甚么宁戚鞭牛，胜强似周郎赤壁。这个是天火非凡真利害，烘烘焃焃火风红！那妖魔见火来时，全无恐惧，将圈子望空抛起，唿喇一声，把这火龙火马，火鸦火鼠，火枪火刀，火弓火箭，一圈子又套将下去，转回本洞，得胜收兵。</p>

<p>这火德星君，手执着一杆空旗，招回众将，会合天王等，坐于山南坡下，对行者道：“大圣啊，这个凶魔，真是罕见！我今折了火具，怎生是好？”行者笑道：“不须报怨，列位且请宽坐坐，待老孙再去去来。”天王道：“你又往那里去？”行者道：“那怪物既不怕火，断然怕水。常言道，水能克火。等老孙去北天门里，请水德星君施布水势，往他洞里一灌，把魔王渰死，取物件还你们。”天王道：“此计虽妙，但恐连你师父都渰杀也。”行者道：</p>

<p>“没事！渰死我师，我自有个法儿教他活来。如今稽迟列位，甚是不当。”火德道：“既如此，且请行，请行。”</p>

<p>好大圣，又驾筋斗云，径到北天门外，忽抬头，见多闻天王向前施礼道：“孙大圣何往？”行者道：“有一事要入乌浩宫见水德星君，你在此作甚？”多闻道：“今日轮该巡视。”正说处，又见那庞刘苟毕四大天将，进礼邀茶。行者道：“不劳不劳！我事急矣！”遂别却诸神，直至乌浩宫，着水部众神即时通报。众神报道：“齐天大圣孙悟空来了。”水德星君闻言，即将查点四海五湖、八河四渎、三江九派并各处龙王俱遣退，整冠束带，接出宫门，迎进宫内道：“昨日可韩司查勘小宫，恐有本部之神，思凡作怪，正在此点查江海河渎之神，尚未完也，”行者道：“那魔王不是江河之神，此乃广大之精。先蒙玉帝差李天王父子并两个雷公下界擒拿，被他弄个圈子，将六件神兵套去。老孙无奈，又上彤华宫请火德星君帅火部众神放火，又将火龙火马等物，一圈子套去。我想此物既不怕火，必然怕水，特来告请星君，施水势，与我捉那妖精，取兵器归还天将。吾师之难，亦可救也。”水德闻言，即令黄河水伯神王：“随大圣去助功。”水伯自衣袖中取出一个白玉盂儿道：“我有此物盛水。”行者道：“看这盂儿能盛几何？妖魔如何渰得？”水伯道：“不瞒大圣说。我这一盂，乃是黄河之水。半盂就是半河，一盂就是一河。”行者喜道：“只消半盂足矣。”遂辞别水德，与黄河神急离天阙。</p>

<p>那水伯将盂儿望黄河舀了半盂，跟大圣至金嶒山，向南坡下见了天王、太子、雷公、火德，具言前事行者道：“不必细讲，且教水伯跟我去。待我叫开他门，不要等他出来，就将水往门里一倒，那怪物一窝子可都渰死，我却去捞师父的尸首，再救活不迟。”那水伯依命，紧随行者，转山坡，径至洞口，叫声“妖怪开门！”那把门的小妖，听得是孙大圣的声音，急又去报道：</p>

<p>“孙悟空又来矣！”那魔闻说，带了宝贝，绰枪就走，响一声，开了石门。这水伯将白玉盂向里一倾，那妖见是水来，撒了长枪，即忙取出圈子，撑住二门。只见那股水骨都都的都往外泛将出来，慌得孙大圣急纵筋斗，与水伯跳在高峰。那天王同众都驾云停于高峰之前观看，那水波涛泛涨，着实狂澜。好水！真个是：一勺之多，果然不测。盖唯神功运化，利万物而流涨百川。</p>

<p>只听得那潺潺声振谷，又见那滔滔势漫天。雄威响若雷奔走，猛涌波如雪卷颠。千丈波高漫路道，万层涛激泛山岩。冷冷如漱玉，滚滚似鸣弦。触石沧沧喷碎玉，回湍渺渺漩窝圆。低低凹凹随流荡，满涧平沟上下连。行者见了心慌道：“不好啊！水漫四野，渰了民田，未曾灌在他的洞里，曾奈之何？”唤水伯急忙收水。水伯道：“小神只会放水，却不会收水，常言道泼水难收。”咦！那座山却也高峻，这场水只奔低流。须臾间，四散而归涧壑。</p>

<p>又只见那洞外跳出几个小妖，在外边吆吆喝喝，伸拳逻袖，弄棒拈枪，依旧喜喜欢欢耍子。天王道：“这水原来不曾灌入洞内，枉费一场之功也！”行者忍不住心中怒发，双手轮拳，闯至妖魔门首，喝道：“那里走！看打！”唬得那几个小妖，丢了枪棒，跑入洞里，战兢兢的报道：“大王，打将来了！”魔王挺长枪，迎出门前道：“这泼猴老大惫懒！你几番家敌不过我，纵水火亦不能近，怎么又踵将来送命？”行者道：“这儿子反说了哩！</p>

<p>不知是我送命，是你送命！走过来，吃老外公一拳！”那妖魔笑道：“这猴儿强勉缠帐！我倒使枪，他却使拳。那般一个筋骷子拳头，只好有个核桃儿大小，怎么称得个锤子起也？罢！罢！罢！</p>

<p>我且把枪放下，与你走一路拳看看！”行者笑道：“说得是！走上来！”那妖撩衣进步，丢了个架子，举起两个拳来，真似打油的铁锤模样。这大圣展足挪身，摆开解数，在那洞门前，与那魔王递走拳势。这一场好打！咦！拽开大四平，踢起双飞脚。韬胁劈胸墩，剜心摘胆着。仙人指路，老子骑鹤。饿虎扑食最伤人，蛟龙戏水能凶恶。魔王使个蟒翻身，大圣却施鹿解角。翘跟淬地龙，扭腕拿天橐。青狮张口来，鲤鱼跌脊跃。盖顶撒花，绕腰贯索。迎风贴扇儿，急雨催花落。妖精便使观音掌，行者就对罗汉脚。长掌开阔自然松，怎比短拳多紧削？两个相持数十回，一般本事无强弱。他两个在那洞门前厮打，只见这高峰头，喜得个李天王厉声喝采，火德星鼓掌夸称。那两个雷公与哪吒太子，帅众神跳到跟前，都要来相助；这壁厢群妖摇旗擂鼓，舞剑轮刀一齐护。孙大圣见事不谐，将毫毛拔下一把，望空撒起，叫“变！”即变做三五十个小猴，一拥上前，把那妖缠住，抱腿的抱腿，扯腰的扯腰，抓眼的抓眼，挦毛的挦毛。那怪物慌了，急把圈子拿将出来。大圣与天王等见他弄出圈套，拨转云头，走上高峰逃阵。那妖把圈子往上抛起，唿喇的一声，把那三五十个毫毛变的小猴收为本相，套入洞中，得了胜，领兵闭门，贺喜而去。</p>

<p>这太子道：“孙大圣还是个好汉！这一路拳，走得似锦上添花。使分身法，正是人前显贵。”行者笑道：“列位在此远观，那怪的本事，比老孙如何？”李天王道：“他拳松脚慢，不如大圣的紧疾，他见我们去时，也就着忙；又见你使出分身法来，他就急了，所以大弄个圈套。”行者道：“魔王好治，只是套子难降。”火德与水伯道：“若还取胜，除非得了他那宝贝，然后可擒。”行者道：“他那宝贝如何可得？只除是偷去来。”邓张二公笑道：“若要行偷礼，除大圣再无能者，想当年大闹天宫时，偷御酒，偷蟠桃，偷龙肝凤髓及老君之丹，那是何等手段！今日正该拿此处用也。”行者道：“好说好说！既如此，你们且坐，等老孙打听去来。”好大圣，跳下峰头，私至洞口摇身一变，变做个麻苍蝇儿。</p>

<p>真个秀溜！你看他：翎翅薄如竹膜，身躯小似花心。手足比毛更奘，星星眼窟明明。善自闻香逐气，飞时迅速乘风。称来刚压定盘星，可爱些些有用。轻轻的飞在门上，爬到门缝边，钻进去，只见那大小群妖，舞的舞，唱的唱，排列两旁；老魔王高坐台上，面前摆着些蛇肉、鹿脯、熊掌、驼峰、山蔬果品，有一把青磁酒壶，香喷喷的羊酪椰醪，大碗家宽怀畅饮。行者落于小妖丛里，又变做一个獾头精，慢慢的演近台边，看彀多时，全不见宝贝放在何方。急抽身转至台后，又见那后厅上高吊着火龙吟啸，火马号嘶。忽抬头，见他的那金箍棒靠在东壁，喜得他心痒难挝，忘记了更容变象，走上前拿了铁棒，现原身丢开解数，一路棒打将出去。慌得那群妖胆战心惊，老魔王措手不及，却被他推倒三个，放倒两个，打开一条血路，径自出了洞门。这才是：魔头骄傲无防备，主杖还归与本人。毕竟不知吉凶如何，且听下回分解。</p>
