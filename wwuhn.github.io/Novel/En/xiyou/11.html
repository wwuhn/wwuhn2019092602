<P>The best place is the middle of the board,</P>
<P>The worst is the side,</P>
<P>And the comers are neither good nor bad.</P>
<P>This is the eternal law of chess.</P>
<P>The law says:</P>
<P>&#8220;It is better to lose a piece</P>
<P>Than to lose the initiative.</P>
<P>When you are struck on the left, look to the right,</P>
<P>When attacked in the rear, keep an eye on your front.</P>
<P>Sometimes the leader is really behind,</P>
<P>Sometimes the laggard is really ahead.</P>
<P>If you have two 'live' areas do not let them be severed;</P>
<P>If you can survive as you are, do not link up.</P>
<P>Do not spread yourself out too thinly,</P>
<P>Do not crowd your pieces too closely.</P>
<P>Rather than being niggardly with your pieces,</P>
<P>Lose them and win the game.</P>
<P>Rather than moving for no reason,</P>
<P>It is better to strengthen your position.</P>
<P>When he has many and you have few,</P>
<P>Concentrate on survival;</P>
<P>When you have many and he has few,</P>
<P>Extend your positions.</P>
<P>The one who is good at winning does not have to struggle;</P>
<P>The one who draws up a good position does not have to fight;</P>
<P>The one who fights well does not lose;</P>
<P>The one who loses well is not thrown into confusion.</P>
<P>Open your game with conventional gambits,</P>
<P>And end by winning with surprise attacks.</P>
<P>When the enemy strengthens himself for no apparent reason,</P>
<P>He is planning to attack and cut you off.</P>
<P>When he abandons small areas and does not rescue them</P>
<P>His ambitions are great.</P>
<P>The man who places his pieces at random</P>
<P>Has no plans;</P>
<P>The man who responds without thinking</P>
<P>Is heading for defeat.</P>
<P>The Book of Songs says:</P>
<P>&#8220;Be cautious and careful</P>
<P>As if you were walking on the edge of a precipice.'</P>
<P>This is what it means.&#8221;</P>

<P>As sovereign and minister played their game of chess it was half past one. Although the game was not over, Wei Zheng slumped down beside the table and started to snore, fast asleep.</P>
<P>&#8220;Worthy Minister,&#8221; said Taizong with a smile, &#8220;you have exhausted your mind in strengthening the country and tired yourself out building the empire; that is why you have fallen asleep without realizing it.&#8221; The Emperor said no more and let him sleep. Not long afterwards Wei Zheng woke up, prostrated himself on the floor, and said, &#8220;Your subject deserves ten thousand deaths. I fell asleep without knowing what I was doing, and I beg Your Majesty to forgive your subject's criminal discourtesy to his sovereign.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What criminal discourtesy have you committed?&#8221; the Emperor asked. &#8220;Rise, and take the Pieces off the board so that we may start again.&#8221; Wei Zheng thanked him for his grace, and was just taking the pieces in his hand when he heard shouting outside the palace gates. Qin Shubao, Xu Maogong and some others brought in a dragon's head dripping with blood, threw it to the floor in front of the Emperor, and reported, &#8220;Your Majesty,Seas have gone shallow and rivers have run dry,But such a sight as this was never seen by human eye.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Emperor and Wei Zheng rose to their feet and asked where it had come from.</P>
<P>&#8220;This dragon's head fell from a cloud at the crossroads at the end of the Thousand Yard Portico, and your humble subjects dared not fail to report it,&#8221; said Qin Shubao and Xu Maogong.</P>
<P>&#8220;What does this mean?&#8221; the Tang Emperor asked Wei Zheng in astonishment.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your subject beheaded it in a dream just now,&#8221; replied Wei Zheng, kowtowing.</P>
<P>&#8220;But I never saw you move your hand or body when you were dozing,&#8221; said the shocked Emperor, &#8220;and you had no sword, so how could you have beheaded it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; replied Wei Zheng, &#8220;your subject</P>

<p>君臣两个对弈此棋，正下到午时三刻，一盘残局未终，魏征忽然踏伏在案边，鼾鼾盹睡。太宗笑曰：“贤卿真是匡扶社稷之心劳，创立江山之力倦，所以不觉盹睡。”太宗任他睡着，更不呼唤。不多时，魏征醒来，俯伏在地道：“臣该万死，臣该万死！却才晕困，不知所为，望陛下赦臣慢君之罪。”太宗道：“卿有何慢罪？且起来，拂退残棋，与卿从新更着。”魏征谢了恩，却才拈子在手，只听得朝门外大呼小叫。原来是秦叔宝、徐茂功等，将着一个血淋的龙头，掷在帝前，启奏道：“陛下，海浅河枯曾有见，这般异事却无闻。”太宗与魏征起身道：“此物何来？”叔宝、茂功道：“千步廊南，十字街头，云端里落下这颗龙头，微臣不敢不奏。”唐王惊问魏征：“此是何说？”魏征转身叩头道：“是臣才一梦斩的。”唐王闻言，大惊道：“贤卿盹睡之时，又不曾见动身动手，又无刀剑，如何却斩此龙？”魏征奏道：“主公，臣的身在君前，梦离陛下——</p>

<P>Emperor Taizong's feelings on hearing this were mixed. On the one hand he was happy, because he was proud of having so good a minister as Wei Zheng; for with a hero like that in his court he needed to have no worries about the safety of the empire. On the other hand he was distressed, because although he had promised in his dream to save the dragon, it had been executed. He had no choice but to pull himself together and order Qin Shubao to hang the dragon's head up in the market place as a warning to the common people of Chang'an. He also rewarded Wei Zheng, and then all the officials dispersed.</P>
<P>When he returned to the palace that evening, the Emperor was depressed as he remembered how the dragon had wept so bitterly in his dream, begging to be saved. Yet the dragon had been unable to avoid its doom. After brooding over this for a long time he felt more and more exhausted and uneasy. In the second watch of the night he heard sobbing outside the palace gates, which made him more frightened than ever. As he lay in a fitful sleep, the dragon king of the River Jing reappeared, this time holding a head dripping with blood in his hands.</P>

<P>&#8220;Emperor Taizong of the Tang,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;give me back my life, give me back my life. Last night you were full of promises to save me, so why did you double-cross me yesterday and order Wei Zheng, the official in charge of personnel, to behead me? Come out, come out, and we shall go to the King of Hell's place to have this out.&#8221; He pulled at the Emperor's clothes and would not stop shouting. Taizong could find nothing to say, and struggled so hard to get away that he was pouring with sweat. Just at this most awkward moment he saw fragrant clouds and coloured mists to the South. A female Immortal came forward and waved a willow twig, at which the headless dragon went off to the Northwest, weeping pitifully. This Immortal was the Bodhisattva Guanyin, who had come to the East in obedience to the Buddha's decree to find the man to fetch the scriptures. She was now staying in the temple of the tutelary god of Chang'an, and when she heard the devilish howling she came to chase away the wicked dragon. The dragon then went down to Hell to submit a full report.</p>

<div class="right">
<p>太宗闻言，心中悲喜不一。喜者夸奖魏征好臣，朝中有此豪杰，愁甚江山不稳？悲者谓梦中曾许救龙，不期竟致遭诛。只得强打精神，传旨着叔宝将龙头悬挂市曹，晓谕长安黎庶，一壁厢赏了魏征，众官散讫。当晚回宫，心中只是忧闷，想那梦中之龙，哭啼啼哀告求生，岂知无常，难免此患。思念多时，渐觉神魂倦怠，身体不安。当夜二更时分，只听得宫门外有号泣之声，太宗愈加惊恐。正朦胧睡间，又见那泾河龙王，手提着一颗血淋淋的首级，高叫：“唐太宗，还我命来，还我命来！你昨夜满口许诺救我，怎么天明时反宣人曹官来斩我？你出来，你出来！我与你到阎君处折辨折辨！”他扯住太宗，再三嚷闹不放，太宗箝口难言，只挣得汗流遍体。正在那难分难解之时，只见正南上香云缭绕，彩雾飘飘，有一个女真人上前，将杨柳枝用手一摆，那没头的龙，悲悲啼啼，径往西北而去。原来这是观音菩萨，领佛旨上东土寻取经人，此住长安城都土地庙里，夜闻鬼泣神号，特来喝退业龙，救脱皇帝。那龙径到阴司地狱具告不题。</p>

<P>When Taizong woke up he shouted, &#8220;A ghost, a ghost!&#8221; The empresses of the three palaces, the imperial consorts and concubines of the six compounds, the attendants and the eunuchs were all so terrified by this that they lay awake trembling for the rest of the night. Before long it was half past four, and all the military and civil officials were waiting for the morning court outside the palace gates. When dawn came and the Emperor had still not come to court they were so frightened that they did not know what to do.</P>
<P>It was not till the sun was high in the sky that a decree was brought out that read, &#8220;As our mind is not at ease all the officials are excused court.&#8221; Six or seven days quickly passed, and all the officials were so anxious that they wished they could rush to the palace gates to see the Emperor and ask after his health, but all that happened was that the Empress issued a decree summoning the royal doctors to the palace to administer medicine. Crowds of officials gathered at the palace gates waiting for news, and when the doctors came out a little later they asked what the matter was.</P>
<P>&#8220;His Majesty's pulse in not as it should be: it is both faint and fast. He murmurs deliriously about having seen a ghost. His pulse stops every ten beats. His five viscera lack all spirit, and I am afraid that the worst must be expected within seven days.&#8221; The officials went pale from shock.</P>
<P>Amid all the panic it was learned that Taizong had sent for Xu Maogong, the Duke Protector Qin Shubao, and Lord Yuchi Jingde. When the three lords received the decree they hurried to the lower story of the side palace. When they had bowed to him, a serious-faced Taizong spoke forcefully to them.</P>
<P>&#8220;Illustrious ministers,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we started to command troops at the age of nineteen, and had many hard years of fighting from then on, conquering the North and the South, defending in the East, and wiping out our enemies in the West; but never once did we see anything sinister or evil. Yet now we are seeing ghosts.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty has founded an empire and slaughtered men beyond number, so why should you be scared of ghosts?&#8221; asked Lord Yuchi.</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't believe us,&#8221; the Emperor replied, &#8220;but outside our bedroom door at night bricks and tiles fly about and the ghosts and demons howl. It is really terrible. Daytime is passable, but the nights are unbearable.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry, Your Majesty,&#8221; said Qin Shubao. &#8220;Tonight I and Yuchi Jingde shall guard the palace doors to see whether there are any ghosts or not.&#8221; Taizong agreed to his suggestion, and after thanking him for his kindness Xu Maogong and the other two generals withdrew. That evening the two of them put on their equipment and took up their positions outside the palace gates in full armour and helmet, with golden maces and battle-axes in their hands. Look how these splendid generals were dressed:</P>

<div class="right">
<p>却说太宗苏醒回来，只叫“有鬼，有鬼！”慌得那三宫皇后，六院嫔妃，与近侍太监，战兢兢一夜无眠。不觉五更三点，那满朝文武多官，都在朝门外候朝。等到天明，犹不见临朝，唬得一个个惊惧踌躇。及日上三竿，方有旨意出来道：“朕心不快，众官免朝。”不觉倏五七日，众官忧惶，都正要撞门见驾问安，只见太后有旨，召医官入宫用药，众人在朝门等候讨信。少时，医官出来，众问何疾。医官道：“皇上脉气不正，虚而又数，狂言见鬼，又诊得十动一代，五脏无气，恐不讳只在七日之内矣。”众官闻言大惊失色。正怆惶间，又听得太后有旨宣徐茂功、护国公、尉迟公见驾。三公奉旨，急入到分宫楼下。拜毕，太宗正色强言道：“贤卿，寡人十九岁领兵，南征北伐，东挡西除，苦历数载，更不曾见半点邪祟，今日却反见鬼！”尉迟公道：“创立江山，杀人无数，何怕鬼乎？”太宗道：“卿是不信。朕这寝宫门外，入夜就抛砖弄瓦，鬼魅呼号，着然难处。白日犹可，昏夜难禁。”叔宝道：“陛下宽心，今晚臣与敬德把守宫门，看有什么鬼祟。”太宗准奏，茂功谢恩而出。当日天晚，各取披挂，他两个介胄整齐，执金瓜钺斧，在宫门外把守。好将军！你看他怎生打扮——</p>

<P>The two generals stood beside the doors till deep into the night, and not a single demon did they see. That night Taizong slept peacefully in the palace and nothing happened. When morning came he called the two generals in and gave them rich rewards.</P>
<P>&#8220;We had not been able to sleep for several days since we fell ill,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but last night was very peaceful, thanks to the awesome might of you two generals. Please go and rest now so that you can guard us again tonight.&#8221; The two generals thanked him and left. For the next two or three nights they stood guard and all was quiet; but the Emperor ate less and less as his illness took a turn for the worse. Not wishing to put the two generals to any more trouble, he summoned them to the palace with Du Ruhui and Fang Xuanling.</P>
<P>These were the instructions he gave them: &#8220;Although we have enjoyed peace for the last two days, we are unhappy about the night-long ordeals we have imposed on Generals Qin and Yuchi. We therefore wish to commission two skilled painters to make faithful portraits of the two generals to paste on the doors so that they may be saved trouble. What do you think?&#8221; In obedience to the imperial decree the officials chose two men who could draw a good likeness, and the two generals wore their armour as before while they were painted. Then the pictures were stuck on the doors, and there was no trouble that night.</p>

<p>二将军侍立门旁，一夜天晚，更不曾见一点邪祟。是夜，太宗在宫，安寝无事，晓来宣二将军，重重赏牜劳道：“朕自得疾，数日不能得睡，今夜仗二将军威势甚安。卿且请出安息安息，待晚间再一护卫。”二将谢恩而出。遂此二三夜把守俱安，只是御膳减损，病转觉重。太宗又不忍二将辛苦，又宣叔宝、敬德与杜、房诸公入宫，吩咐道：“这两日朕虽得安，却只难为秦、胡二将军彻夜辛苦。朕欲召巧手丹青，传二将军真容，贴于门上，免得劳他，如何？”众臣即依旨，选两个会写真的，着胡、秦二公依前披挂，照样画了，贴在门上，夜间也即无事。</p>

<P>The next two or three days were peaceful too but then the Emperor heard bricks and tiles banging and crashing once again at the Hou Zai Gate. He summoned his officials at dawn and said, &#8220;There has, thank goodness, been no trouble at the front gates for several days now, but there were noises at the back gates last night that practically scared me to death.&#8221; Xu Maogong went forward and submitted this suggestion: &#8220;When there was trouble at the front gates Yuchi Jingde and Qin Shubao protected Your Majesty. Now there is trouble at the back gates Wei Zheng should be ordered to stand guard.&#8221;</P>
<P>Taizong approved his suggestion, and ordered Wei Zheng to stand guard at the back gates that night. Wei Zheng received the edict, and that night he put on his best clothes, belted himself tightly, and took up his vigil outside the Hou Zai Gate. He was a true hero. He wore</P>

<P>No devils were seen all night, but although nothing happened at the front or back gates the Emperor's condition still deteriorated. One day the Empress Dowager issued an edict summoning the officials to discuss funeral arrangements. Taizong sent for Xu Maogong and gave him orders about affairs of state, instructing him to look after the heir to the throne in the way that Liu Bei, the ruler of Shu, had instructed Zhuge Liang. When he had finished speaking he was bathed and put into clean clothes. All he had to do now was to wait for the end. Then in rushed Wei Zheng, who grabbed hold of his dragon robes and said, &#8220;Do not worry, Your Majesty. I can ensure Your Majesty long life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The disease has reached my heart,&#8221; replied the Emperor, &#8220;and my life will end at any moment now, so how can you save it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your subject has a letter here,&#8221; said Wei Zheng, &#8220;that I am offering to Your Majesty to take with you to the underworld and give to Cui Jue, the judge of Fengdu.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Who is this Cui Jue?&#8221; asked the Emperor.</P>
<P>&#8220;He was one of the officers of Your Majesty's exalted predecessor. From being magistrate of Cizhou he was promoted to be vice-president of the Ministry of Rites. When he was alive he and I were close friends. Now that he is dead he is in charge of the Registers of Birth and Death in the underworld as judge of Fengdu, and he often comes to see me in my dreams. If you take this letter with you on your journey and give it to him, he is bound to allow Your Majesty to come back out of consideration for your humble subject. I can guarantee that Your Majesty's soul will return to the sunlight, and the dragon countenance will certainly return to the imperial capital.&#8221; Taizong took the letter and put it in his sleeve, then he shut his eyes in death. The empresses, consorts and imperial concubines of the three palaces and the six compounds, the palace servants, the heir to the throne, and the civil and military officials all grieved and dressed in mourning. The imperial coffin lay in state in the White Tiger Hall.</p>

<p>一夜通明，也无鬼魅。虽是前后门无事，只是身体渐重。一日，太后又传旨，召众臣商议殡殓后事。太宗又宣徐茂功，吩咐国家大事，叮嘱仿刘蜀主托孤之意。言毕，沐浴更衣，待时而已。旁闪魏征，手扯龙衣，奏道：“陛下宽心，臣有一事，管保陛下长生。”太宗道：“病势已入膏肓，命将危矣，如何保得？”征云：“臣有书一封，进与陛下，捎去到冥司，付酆都判官崔吧太宗道：“崔吧是谁？”征云：“崔吧乃是太上先皇帝驾前之臣，先受兹州令，后升礼部侍郎。在日与臣八拜为交，相知甚厚。他如今已死，现在阴司做掌生死文簿的酆都判官，梦中常与臣相会。此去若将此书付与他，他念微臣薄分，必然放陛下回来，管教魂魄还阳世，定取龙颜转帝都。”太宗闻言，接在手中，笼入袖里，遂瞑目而亡。那三宫六院、皇后嫔妃、侍长储君及两班文武，俱举哀戴孝，又在白虎殿上，停着梓宫不题。</p>

<P>Taizong was in a daze as his soul went straight to the Tower of Five Phoenixes, in front of which he saw the horsemen of the Imperial Guard who invited him out hunting with them. Taizong was glad to go and they went off into the distance; but after they had been going for some time he found himself walking alone in a wasteland: the horsemen had all disappeared. Just as he was discovering to his alarm that he could not find his way a man appeared not far away, shouting.</P>

<P>When Taizong went up to him, he fell on his knees beside the path and said, &#8220;Your Majesty, please forgive your subject for his crime of failing to come far enough to meet you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; asked the Emperor, &#8220;and why have you come to meet me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;A fortnight ago your humble servant heard the Dragon King of the River Jing bringing a case against Your Majesty in the Senluo Palace because he was executed despite your promise to save him,&#8221; replied the other.</P>
<P>&#8220;The King of Qinguang of the First Palace sent devil messengers with an urgent summons to Your Majesty to be present when the case is heard between the Three Orders: the Human Order, the Underworld Order and the Water Order. When I heard this I came here to meet Your Majesty. I arrived late, so I beg for forgiveness.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What is your name and position?&#8221; asked Taizong.</P>
<P>&#8220;When your humble servant was alive I used to serve His Late Majesty. I was magistrate of Cizhou, and later made vice-president of the Ministry of Rites. My name is Cui Jue. I have now been given office in the underworld as the judge in charge of cases at Fengdu.&#8221; Taizong, greatly delighted to learn this, went up to him and supported him with his imperial hands as he said, &#8220;Sir, you have made a long and exhausting journey. Wei Zheng, our minister, gave us a letter for you; how lucky that we have met.&#8221; The judge thanked him and asked where the letter was. Taizong produced it from his sleeve and handed it over to Cui Jue, who received it with a bow. When he opened it he saw that it read as follows:</p>

<P>Your Excellency, Metropolitan Judge, and Venerable Elder Brother Cui,</P>
<P>Remembering our former friendship; I still see and hear you as if you were alive; but many years have now flown by since I last received your pure instruction. On feast days I set out some vegetarian dishes as a sacrifice to you, but I have been unable to divine whether they are enjoyed by you. As I have the good fortune not to have been abandoned by you and you have appeared to me in dreams, I now know that my great elder brother has risen high. But, alas, there is a great gap between the worlds of darkness and of light, and we are unable to meet each other as we are each at different ends of the universe.</P>
<P>As the Cultured Emperor Taizong has recently passed away of a sudden illness it seems likely that his case will be discussed by the Three Orders, so that he is bound to meet you, elder brother. I beseech you to remember the friendship of the days when you were alive and give His Majesty such assistance as will enable him to return to the sunlight. This would be a great favour, and I shall write again to thank you. I cannot go into all the details of the case here.</P>
<P>Your younger brother kowtows to you.</P>
<P>With affection,</P>
<P>Wei Zheng.</p>

<P>The judge was very pleased when he had read the letter. &#8220;I know about how the official Wei of the personnel department beheaded the dragon in a dream the other day,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and this news filled me with great admiration. He has always looked after my sons and grandsons, and now that I have a letter from him, Your Majesty need have no worries. Your humble servant can undertake to escort Your Majesty back to the light, where you will once more ascend the throne.&#8221; Taizong thanked him.</p>

<p>那判官看了书，满心欢喜道：“魏人曹前日梦斩老龙一事，臣已早知，甚是夸奖不尽。又蒙他早晚看顾臣的子孙，今日既有书来，陛下宽心，微臣管送陛下还阳，重登玉阙。”太宗称谢了。</p>

<P>As they were talking a pair of servant boys in black appeared, carrying banners and a precious canopy. &#8220;An invitation from King Yama,&#8221; they shouted. Taizong and Judge Cui went along with them. A city wall appeared in front of them, and above its gates hung a large tablet on which was written DEVIL GATE OF THE WORLD OF DARKNESS in huge letters of gold. The two lictors waved their banners and led Taizong into the city and along its streets. Beside the road he saw his father and predecessor Li Yuan, as well as his dead brothers Jaincheng and Yuanji, who went up to him and said, &#8220;Shimin's here, Shimin's here,&#8221; using his personal name. They grabbed and hit him, demanding their lives back; and as Taizong could not avoid them they held him fast until Judge Cui ordered a blue-faced devil with terrible fangs to drive them away. Only then was Taizong able to escape from their clutches. After another mile or so he saw a green-tiled tower rising majestically before him.</P>

<p>二人正说间，只见那边有一对青衣童子，执幢幡宝盖，高叫道：“阎王有请，有请。”太宗遂与崔判官并二童子举步前进。忽见一座城，城门上挂着一面大牌，上写着“幽冥地府鬼门关”七个大金字。那青衣将幢幡摇动，引太宗径入城中，顺街而走。只见那街旁边有先主李渊，先兄建成，故弟元吉，上前道：“世民来了，世民来了！”那建成、元吉就来揪打索命。太宗躲闪不及，被他扯住。幸有崔判官唤一青面獠牙鬼使，喝退了建成、元吉，太宗方得脱身而去。行不数里，见一座碧瓦楼台，真个壮丽，但见——</p>

<P>As Taizong gazed at it from the outside, jade ornaments could be heard tinkling as they swung from the belts of officials, and rare perfumes could be smelt. In front were two pairs of attendants holding lanterns, and behind them the ten generations of kings of the underworld came down the steps. The ten kings were the King of Qinguang, the King of Chujiang, King Songdi, King Wuguan, King Yama, King Impartial, King of Mount Tai, the Metropolitan King, the King of Biancheng, and the King of the Ever-turning Wheel. They came out of the Senluo Palace and bowed to Taizong in greeting. Taizong felt too humble to go forward.</p>

<P>&#8220;Your Majesty is a monarch in the world of light, but we are only kings in the world of darkness. It is therefore only right that we should do this, so why this excessive modesty?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We have offended against Your Majesties,&#8221; replied Taizong, &#8220;so how can we venture to talk in terms of light and darkness, or men and ghosts?&#8221; After much yielding Taizong went into the Senluo Palace, and when they had finished bowing to each other they sat down as hosts and guest.</P>
<P>A moment later the King of Qinguang clasped his hands together and said, &#8220;Why is it that the ghost dragon of the River Jing has brought a case against Your Majesty, saying that he was executed despite your promise to save him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I had a dream that an old dragon came to ask me to save him,&#8221; replied Taizong, &#8220;and I did in fact promise that he would come to no harm; but as it turned out his crime was a capital one, for which he was due to be beheaded by the minister in the personnel department, Wei Zheng. We summoned Wei Zheng to come and play chess in the palace, and I never knew that he had beheaded the dragon in a dream. This happened because that officer can come and go miraculously, and also because the dragon king had committed a crime for which he deserved to die. We were in no way to blame for his death.&#8221;</P>

<P>When the Ten Kings heard his statement they bowed and replied, &#8220;Even before that dragon was born it was written in the registers of the Southern Pole Star that he was destined to die at the hands of a personnel minister, as we have long been aware. But because he has been arguing about the matter we had to send for Your Majesty. When the case has been argued between the three orders we shall send him to the Revolving Prayer-wheel for reincarnation. We hope that Your Majesty will forgive us for forcing you to attend.&#8221; Then they ordered the judge in charge of the Registers of Birth and Death to fetch them at once to see how long His Majesty was due to live. Judge Cui hurried to his office and took down the general register of the lengths of the reigns Heaven had allowed to the kings of all the countries of the earth. As he was looking through it he saw to his horror that Emperor Taizong of the Great Tang in the Southern Jambu Continent was due to die in year 13 of his reign. He hurriedly seized a large brush soaked in ink, changed 13 into 33, then he handed the register up. The Ten Kings started at the beginning and read it through until they saw that Taizong was due to reign for thirty-three years.</P>
<P>&#8220;How long has Your Majesty been on the throne?&#8221; asked the shocked kings of hell.</P>
<P>&#8220;It is now thirteen years since my accession,&#8221; Taizong replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Then there is no need for Your Majesty to worry,&#8221; said King Yama. &#8220;You have twenty years of life ahead of you. Now that you have answered these charges satisfactorily, will you please return to the World of Light.&#8221; On hearing this Taizong bowed and thanked the Ten Kings, who then ordered judge Cui and marshal Zhu to return Taizong his soul. As he was leaving the Senluo Palace Taizong raised his hand in salutation and asked the Ten Kings about the prospects for all the members of his family in his palace.</P>
<P>&#8220;Good,&#8221; they replied, &#8220;except that Your Majesty's younger sister does not seem to be going to live much longer.&#8221; Taizong bowed once more to express his thanks.</P>
<P>&#8220;When we return to the daylight we shall have nothing with which to show our gratitude except for fruit and melons.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We have gourds, Eastern melons and Western melons, or water-melons, here, but no pumpkins, no Southern melons,&#8221; said the Ten Kings.</P>
<P>&#8220;When we return to the world of the living we shall send some,&#8221; replied Taizong, and with that they raised their clasped hands to each other, bowed, and parted.</p>

<P>The Oil-cauldron Hell, the Hell of Blackness, the Hell of the Mountain of Knives.</P>
<P>Shivering and trembling,</P>
<P>In terrible agony;</P>
<P>Because they used violence against the good</P>
<P>They cower and hunch their shoulders in their suffering.</P>
<P>The Hell of the Pool of Blood, the Avichi Hell, the Hell of the Steelyard Beam,</P>
<P>Where skin is pulled away from the bone,</P>
<P>Arms are broken and tendons cut.</P>
<P>Because they killed for gain,</P>
<P>Butchering living creatures,</P>
<P>They fell into these torments that will not end in a thousand years;</P>
<P>They will always lie here, never to escape.</P>
<P>Every one of them is tightly bound,</P>
<P>Knotted and roped.</P>
<P>Red-faced demons,</P>
<P>And black-faced demons,</P>
<P>Are sent with their long halberds and short swords.</P>
<P>Ox-headed fiends.</P>
<P>And horse-faced fiends,</P>
<P>With iron clubs and brazen hammers,</P>
<P>Beat them till their wincing faces flow with blood,</P>
<P>As they call on Heaven and Earth and get no answer.</P>
<P>Let no man alive have any illusions:</P>
<P>The devils carry out their orders and release nobody.</P>
<P>Good and evil will always be rewarded:</P>
<P>It is only a question of time.&#8221;</P>

<p>吊筋狱、幽枉狱、火坑狱，寂寂寥寥，烦烦恼恼，尽皆是生前作下千般业，死后通来受罪名。酆都狱、拔舌狱、剥皮狱，哭哭啼啼，凄凄惨惨，只因不忠不孝伤天理，佛口蛇心堕此门。磨捱狱、碓捣狱、车崩狱，皮开肉绽，抹嘴咨牙，乃是瞒心昧己不公道，巧语花言暗损人。寒冰狱、脱壳狱、抽肠狱，垢面蓬头，愁眉皱眼，都是大斗小秤欺痴蠢，致使灾屯累自身。油锅狱、黑暗狱、刀山狱，战战兢兢，悲悲切切，皆因强暴欺良善，藏头缩颈苦伶仃。血池狱、阿鼻狱、秤杆狱，脱皮露骨，折臂断筋，也只为谋财害命，宰畜屠生，堕落千年难解释，沉沦永世不翻身。一个个紧缚牢栓，绳缠索绑，差些赤发鬼、黑脸鬼，长枪短剑；牛头鬼、马面鬼，铁简铜锤。只打得皱眉苦面血淋淋，叫地叫天无救应。正是人生却莫把心欺，神鬼昭彰放过谁？善恶到头终有报，只争来早与来迟。”</p>

<P>Before they had gone much further a group of devil soldiers holding banners knelt down beside the road and said, &#8220;The Commissioners of the Bridges welcome you.&#8221; The Judge shouted to them that they were to rise and led Taizong across a golden bridge. Taizong saw that there was a silver bridge beside it over which some loyal, filial, worthy, just, and upright people were passing, led by banners. There was a third bridge on the other side with an icy wind roaring across it and waves of blood boiling below amid unbroken howls and wails.</P>
<P>&#8220;What is that bridge called?&#8221; Taizong asked, and the Judge replied, &#8220;Your Majesty, that is called the Bridge of Punishment, and you must tell people about it when you return to the world of the living. Below the bridge there are</P>

<p>太宗听说，心中惊惨。进前又走不多时，见一伙鬼卒，各执幢幡，路旁跪下道：“桥梁使者来接。”判官喝令起去，上前引着太宗，从金桥而过。太宗又见那一边有一座银桥，桥上行几个忠孝贤良之辈，公平正大之人，亦有幢幡接引；那壁厢又有一桥，寒风滚滚，血浪滔滔，号泣之声不绝。太宗问道：“那座桥是何名色？”判官道：“陛下，那叫做奈河桥。若到阳间，切须传记，那桥下都是些——</p>

<P>A narrow, precipitous path</P>
<P>Over a mighty, rushing river.</P>
<P>It is like a strip of cloth across the Yangtse,</P>

<P>The icy vapours freeze one to the bone;</P>
<P>Nauseating stenches assail the nostrils.</P>
<P>There is no boat to ferry you</P>

<P>All who appear are sinful ghosts</P>

<P>The bridge is many miles long</P>

<P>The commissioners of the bridges had gone away while he was speaking. Taizong's heart was once more filled with horror, and he nodded his head and sighed silently in his distress, then followed the judge and the Marshal. Before long they crossed the evil River of Punishment and passed the terrors of the Bowl of Blood. Then they came to the City of the Unjustly Slain. Amid the hubbub, shouts of &#8220;Li Shimin's here, Li Shimin's here,&#8221; could be made out, to the terror of Taizong. He saw that his way was blocked by a crowd of maimed and headless spectres.</P>
<P>&#8220;Give us back our lives,&#8221; they were all shouting, &#8220;give us back our lives.&#8221; The panic-stricken Taizong tried to hide, yelling, &#8220;Help, Judge Cui, help, help.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; the judge replied, &#8220;these are the ghosts of the kings and chieftains of the sixty-four groups of rebels and the seventy-two troops of bandits. They were all killed unjustly, and nobody has given them a home or looked after them. They cannot get themselves reborn as they have no money for the journey, so they are all uncared-for cold and hungry ghosts. If Your Majesty is able to give them some money I can save you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I came here empty-handed,&#8221; Taizong replied, &#8220;so where could I possibly get any money?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; the judge replied, &#8220;there is a man in the world of light who deposited a certain amount of money in the underworld. If Your Majesty is prepared to sign an I.O.U., I will endorse it, and we can borrow his store of money to distribute among these hungry ghosts; then we will be able to continue on our way,&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Who is this man?&#8221; asked Taizong.</P>
<P>&#8220;He is a man of Kaifeng in Henan,&#8221; the judge replied, &#8220;and his name is Xiang Liang. He has thirteen hoards of gold and silver down here, and if Your Majesty borrows them, all you have to do is repay them when you return to the world of light.&#8221; Taizong was very pleased, and only too eager to borrow one. He signed an I.O.U. at once and gave it to the judge, then borrowed a store, which he gave to the marshal to hand out.</P>
<P>&#8220;You are to share out this gold and silver and let your Lord of the Great Tang past,&#8221; said the judge. &#8220;As it is too early in his life, I am under orders from the ten kings to return his soul and tell him to hold a Great Mass when he is back in the world of light to enable all of you to be reborn, so don't be making any more trouble.&#8221; When the ghosts heard what he had to say and were given the gold and silver they all withdrew, murmuring their obedient assent. The judge then told the marshal to wave his soul-leading flag, and Taizong was taken out of the City of the Unjustly Slain and floated along the highway to the daylight.</P>

<p>正说间，那几个桥梁使者，早已回去了。太宗心又惊惶，点头暗叹，默默悲伤，相随着判官、太尉，早过了奈河恶水，血盆苦界。前又到枉死城，只听哄哄人嚷，分明说：“李世民来了，李世民来了！”太宗听叫，心惊胆战。见一伙拖腰折臂、有足无头的鬼魅，上前拦住，都叫道：“还我命来，还我命来！”慌得那太宗藏藏躲躲，只叫：“崔先生救我，崔先生救我！”判官道：“陛下，那些人都是那六十四处烟尘，七十二处草寇，众王子、众头目的鬼魂；尽是枉死的冤业，无收无管，不得超生，又无钱钞盘缠，都是孤寒饿鬼。陛下得些钱钞与他，我才救得哩。”太宗道：“寡人空身到此，却那里得有钱钞？”判官道：“陛下，阳间有一人，金银若干，在我这阴司里寄放。陛下可出名立一约，小判可作保，且借他一库，给散这些饿鬼，方得过去。”太宗问曰：“此人是谁？”判官道：“他是河南开封府人氏，姓相名良，他有十三库金银在此。陛下若借用过他的，到阳间还他便了。”太宗甚喜，情愿出名借用。遂立了文书与判官，借他金银一库，着太尉尽行给散。判官复吩咐道：“这些金银，汝等可均分用度，放你大唐爷爷过去，他的阳寿还早哩。我领了十王钧语，送他还魂，教他到阳间做一个水陆大会，度汝等超生，再休生事。”众鬼闻言，得了金银，俱唯唯而退。判官令太尉摇动引魂幡，领太宗出离了枉死城中，奔上平阳大路，飘飘荡荡而去。毕竟不知从那条路出身，且听下回分解。
