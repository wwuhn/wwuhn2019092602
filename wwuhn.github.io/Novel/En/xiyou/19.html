<P>Taking his leave of the Bodhisattva, Monkey brought his cloud in to land, hung the cassock on a<I> nanmu</I> tree, pulled out his cudgel, charged into the Black Wind Cave, and found not a single goblin inside. This was because the appearance of the Bodhisattva in her true form had so terrified them that they had fled in all directions. Evil thoughts welled up in Brother Monkey, and after piling dry firewood all around the multi-storied gate he set it alight, turning the Black Wind Cave into a Red Wind Cave. Then he went back to the North on a beam of magic light.</P>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>行者辞了菩萨，按落云头，将袈裟挂在香楠树上，掣出棒来，打入黑风洞里。那洞里那得一个小妖？原来是他见菩萨出现，降得那老怪就地打滚，急急都散走了。行者一发行凶，将他那几层门上，都积了干柴，前前后后，一齐发火，把个黑风洞烧做个红风洞，却拿了袈裟，驾祥光，转回直北。</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<P>Sanzang, who had been anxiously waiting for him, was beginning to wonder why he had not come back. Had the Bodhisattva not come when asked to, or had Monkey just made up a story to escape? As he was being racked by these desperate thoughts, a shimmering cloud appeared in mid-air and Monkey came down and knelt before him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master, here's the cassock,&#8221; he announced, to Sanzang's great joy.</P>
<P>All the monks of the temple were delighted too, and they exclaimed, &#8220;Wonderful, wonderful, our lives are safe at last.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Monkey,&#8221; said Sanzang as he took the cassock from him, &#8220;when you set out this morning you reckoned that it would only take the length of a meal, or until midday at longest. Why have you only come back now, at sunset?&#8221; When Monkey gave him a full account of how he had asked the Bodhisattva to transform herself to subdue the monster, Sanzang set up an incense table and bowed low to the South. That done, he said, &#8220;Disciple, now that we have the Buddha's robe, pack our luggage as quickly as you can.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Not so fast, not so fast,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;It's already evening, too late to hit the road. Let's set out tomorrow morning.&#8221;</P>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>话说那三藏望行者急忙不来，心甚疑惑，不知是请菩萨不至，不知是行者托故而逃，正在那胡猜乱想之中，只见半空中彩雾灿灿，行者忽坠阶前，叫道：“师父，袈裟来了。”三藏大喜，众僧亦无不欢悦道：“好了！好了！我等性命，今日方才得全了。”三藏接了袈裟道：“悟空，你早间去时，原约到饭罢晌午，如何此时日西方回？”行者将那请菩萨施变化降妖的事情，备陈了一遍，三藏闻言，遂设香案，朝南礼拜罢，道：“徒弟啊，既然有了佛衣，可快收拾包裹去也。”行者道：“莫忙，莫忙。今日将晚，不是走路的时候，且待明日早行。”</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<P>The monks all knelt and said, &#8220;Lord Monkey is right. For one thing it's too late, and for another we made a vow. Now that all is well and the treasure has been recovered, we would like to carry out that vow and invite Your Lordships to share in the thanksgiving meal. Tomorrow morning we'll see you off on your way West.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; urged Monkey. The monks then emptied their bags and produced everything that was left of what they had saved from the fire to make an offering of food. Then they burnt some paper to bring blessings and recited some sutras to ward off disaster. The ceremonies were finished that evening.</P>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>众僧们一齐跪下道：“孙老爷说得是。一则天晚，二来我等有些愿心儿，今幸平安，有了宝贝，待我还了愿，请老爷散了福，明早再送西行。”行者道：“正是，正是。”你看那些和尚，都倾囊倒底，把那火里抢出的余资，各出所有，整顿了些斋供，烧了些平安无事的纸，念了几卷消灾解厄的经。当晚事毕。</p>

<P>The next morning the horse was curried and the luggage packed, and then they set out. The monks escorted them a long distance before turning back, after which Monkey led the way. It was now early spring.</P>

<P>One evening, after they had been travelling along a desolate path for six or seven days, master and disciple saw a distant village. &#8220;Monkey,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;do you see the village not far over there? Let's go and ask them to put us up for the night; we can set off again tomorrow morning.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wait till I've made sure it's all right before deciding.&#8221; Monkey replied, gazing at the village as his master pulled on the silken rein. He saw</P>

<P>When he had surveyed the scene, Brother Monkey said, &#8220;Go ahead, master. It's definitely a good village. We can spend the night there.&#8221; Sanzang urged his horse forward, and in a few moments they were at the beginning of the main street. A young man appeared wearing a silken turban, a blue jacket, a pair of trousers tied at the ankles, and a pair of straw sandals. He was carrying an umbrella in his hand and a pack on his back. He was a fine sight as he walked briskly down the street. Monkey grabbed him and asked, &#8220;Where are you going? I want to ask you something&#8212;where is this?&#8221;</P>
<P>The fellow, who was trying to break loose, shouted, &#8220;Why ask me? I'm not the only person in the village.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be angry, kind sir,&#8221; replied Monkey, all smiles. &#8220;To help others is to help yourself. What harm can it do to tell me what the place is called? We might be able to bring your troubles to an end, you know.&#8221; Struggle as he might, the fellow could not break loose, which made him leap around with fury.</P>
<P>&#8220;Damn it, damn it,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;I get more bullying from the old man than I can stand, and now I've got to run into you, baldy. You've got it in for me too.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you're good for anything, get out of my grip,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;Do that and I'll let you go.&#8221; The young man twisted and turned, but he could not break free&#8212;it was as if he were held in a pair of pliers. In his temper he threw down his umbrella and his bundle, and tore at Monkey with both hands, trying to get hold of him. Monkey was holding the luggage in one hand, and with the other he was keeping the young man under control, and no matter how hard the fellow tried he could not get a grip on him. Monkey, however, was now holding him more firmly than ever, and was bursting with fury.</P>
<P>&#8220;Monkey,&#8221; Sanzang said, &#8220;here comes someone else you can ask. Why keep such a tight grip on him? Let him go.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't understand, master,&#8221; replied Monkey with a smile. &#8220;It would be no fun to ask anyone else. I have to ask him if there's to be anything to be got out of this.&#8221; Seeing that Monkey would not let him go, the fellow started to talk.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is Old Gao Village in the country of Stubet, and it's called that because practically everyone here has the surname Gao. Now let me go.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;From your get-up, you're going on a long journey,&#8221; Monkey went on. &#8220;Tell me where you're going and what you're up to, then I'll let you go.&#8221;</P>
<P>The poor fellow had no option but to tell Monkey the truth. &#8220;I'm Gao Cai from the family of Squire Gao. His youngest daughter is twenty and not yet married, but three years ago an evil spirit came and took her. He's been staying with us for three years, and the old man isn't at all pleased. There's no future in having a girl marry an evil spirit, he says. It's ruining our family, and we don't get a family of in-laws to visit. He's always wanted to get rid of the evil spirit, but he refuses to go. Now he's shut the girl up in the back building for the best part of a year, and he won't let any of the family see her. My old man gave me two ounces of silver and sent me to find a priest to capture the monster. I've been on the go for ages now, and asked three or four of them, but they were all hopeless monks or pimples of Taoists&#8212;none of them could control him. The old man's just been swearing at me as an utter idiot, given me five more ounces of silver as travelling expenses, and told me to find a good priest who'll deal with the monster. Then I was grabbed by you, you evil star, and that's made me later than ever. No wonder I shouted at you: I'm pushed around at home and pushed around when I go out. I never thought you'd be such a good wrestler that I wouldn't be able to break out of your clinch. Let me go now&#8212;I've told you everything.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're in luck&#8212;we're in the business,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;This is quite convenient; you needn't go any further or spend any of your money. We're not hopeless monks or pimples of Taoists. We've got some real magic powers, and we know how to deal with evil spirits. This'll do both of us a bit of good. Go back and tell the head of your household that my master is a saintly monk, and the younger brother of the Emperor of the East, who has sent him to visit the Buddha in the Western Heaven and seek the scriptures. We are very good at controlling devils and capturing monsters.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't lie to me,&#8221; the young man replied. &#8220;I've had enough of being pushed around. If you're tricking me, you haven't really got any special powers, and you can't capture that fiend, you'll only be getting me into more trouble than ever.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I swear I'm not fooling you,&#8221; answered Monkey. &#8220;Show us the way to your front door.&#8221;</P>
<P>The young man saw that there was nothing for it but to pick up his bundle and umbrella, turn round, and take the two of them to his gate, where he said to them, &#8220;Reverend gentlemen, would you mind sitting here on the verandah for a moment while I go in and tell the master?&#8221; Only then did Monkey let go of him, put down the carrying-pole, take the horse's reins, and stand beside his master, who sat down by the gate.</P>

行者看罢道：“师父请行，定是一村好人家，正可借宿。”那长老催动白马，早到街衢之口。又见一个少年，头裹绵布，身穿蓝袄，持伞背包，敛裩扎裤，脚踏着一双三耳草鞋，雄纠纠的出街忙步。行者顺手一把扯住道：“那里去？我问你一个信儿：此间是甚么地方？”那个人只管苦挣，口里嚷道：“我庄上没人，只是我好回信？”行者陪着笑道：“施主莫恼，与人方便，自己方便。你就与我说说地名何害？我也可解得你的烦恼。”那人挣不脱手，气得乱跳道：“蹭蹬！蹭蹬！家长的屈气受不了，又撞着这个光头，受他的清气！”行者道：“你有本事，劈开我的手，你便就去了也罢。”那人左扭右扭，那里扭得动，却似一把铁钤拑住一般，气得他丢了包袱，撇了伞，两只手，雨点似来抓行者。行者把一只手扶着行李，一只手抵住那人，凭他怎么支吾，只是不能抓着。行者愈加不放，急得爆燥如雷。三藏道：“悟空，那里不有人来了？你再问那人就是，只管扯住他怎的？放他去罢。”行者笑道：“师父不知，若是问了别人没趣，须是问他，才有买卖。”那人被行者扯住不过，只得说出道：“此处乃是乌斯藏国界之地，唤做高老庄。一庄人家有大半姓高，故此唤做高老庄。你放了我去罢。”行者又道：“你这样行装，不是个走近路的。你实与我说你要往那里去，端的所干何事，我才放你。”这人无奈，只得以实情告诉道：“我是高太公的家人，名叫高才。我那太公有一个女儿，年方二十岁，更不曾配人，三年前被一个妖精占了。那妖整做了这三年女婿，我太公不悦，说道女儿招了妖精，不是长法，一则败坏家门，二则没个亲家来往，一向要退这妖精。那妖精那里肯退，转把女儿关在他后宅，将有半年，再不放出与家内人相见。我太公与了我几两银子，教我寻访法师，拿那妖怪。我这些时不曾住脚，前前后后，请了有三四个人，都是不济的和尚，脓包的道士，降不得那妖精。刚才骂了我一场，说我不会干事，又与了我五钱银子做盘缠，教我再去请好法师降他。不期撞着你这个纥刺星扯住，误了我走路，故此里外受气，我无奈，才与你叫喊。不想你又有些拿法，我挣不过你，所以说此实情。你放我走罢。”行者道：“你的造化，我有营生，这才是凑四合六的勾当。你也不须远行，莫要化费了银子。我们不是那不济的和尚，脓包的道士，其实有些手段，惯会拿妖。这正是一来照顾郎中，二来又医得眼好，烦你回去上复你那家主，说我们是东土驾下差来的御弟圣僧往西天拜佛求经者，善能降妖缚怪。”高才道：“你莫误了我。我是一肚子气的人，你若哄了我，没甚手段，拿不住那妖精，却不又带累我来受气？”行者道：“管教不误了你。你引我到你家门首去来。”那人也无计奈何，真个提着包袱，拿了伞，转步回身，领他师徒到于门首道：“二位长老，你且在马台上略坐坐，等我进去报主人知道。”行者才放了手，落担牵马，师徒们坐立门旁等候。</p>

<P>The young man went in through the gate and straight to the main hall, where he happened to meet Squire Gao. &#8220;Well, you savage, who have you come back instead of going to find someone?&#8221; Squire Gao demanded. Putting down his bundle and umbrella, the young man replied, &#8220;I must report to you, sir, that I had just got to the end of the street when I met a couple of monks. One was on horseback, and the other had a carrying-pole on his shoulder. He grabbed me and wouldn't let me go, and asked me where I was going. I refused to tell him several times, but he had me locked in a grip I couldn't get out of, so I had to tell him all about the mission you gave me, sir. He was absolutely delighted when he heard about it, and wanted to catch that monster for us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are they from?&#8221; Squire Gao asked. &#8220;He says that his master is a saintly monk, the younger brother of the Emperor of the East, who has sent him to visit the Buddha in the Western Heaven and seek the scriptures,&#8221; the young man replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;But even if they're monks from far away, they may not really be capable of anything. Where are they now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Waiting outside the gate.&#8221;</P>
<P>The old man quickly put on his best clothes and went out with the youngster to greet them, addressing them as &#8220;Venerable Elders.&#8221; Sanzang turned hurriedly round when he heard this, and found them standing before him. The older man was wearing a black silk turban, an onion-white robe of Sichuan brocade, a pair of calf-skin boots the color of unpolished rice, and a belt of black silk.</P>
<P>He came forward and said with a smile, &#8220;Greetings, Venerable Elders,&#8221; as he bowed, holding his hands together. Sanzang returned his bow, but Monkey stood there immobile. At the sight of Brother Monkey's ugly face the old man decided not to bow to him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why won't you pay your respects to me?&#8221; Monkey asked, at which the old man, somewhat frightened, said to the young man, &#8220;You'll be the death of me, you little wretch. We've already got one hideous monster at home as a son-in-law we can't get rid of, so why ever did you have to bring this thunder god here to ruin us?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Gao, old chap, you've been living all these years for nothing&#8212;you've still got no sense. It's completely wrong to judge people by their faces. I may be no beauty, but I'm quite clever. I'll grab that evil spirit for you, catch that demon, seize your son-in-law, and give you back your daughter. I'll be doing you a good turn, so there's no need to fuss about my looks.&#8221; The old man, now shaking with fear, pulled himself together and asked them in. Monkey took the horse's bridle, told the young man to carry the luggage, and went in with Sanzang. In his usual devil-may-care way he tethered the horse to one of the pillars of an open-air pavilion, pulled up a gleaming lacquered armchair, and told his master to sit down. Then he brought over a chair for himself and sat beside him.</P>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>那高才入了大门，径往中堂上走，可可的撞见高太公。太公骂道：“你那个蛮皮畜生，怎么不去寻人，又回来做甚？”高才放下包伞道：“上告主人公得知，小人才行出街口，忽撞见两个和尚：一个骑马，一个挑担。他扯住我不放，问我那里去。我再三不曾与他说及，他缠得没奈何，不得脱手，遂将主人公的事情，一一说与他知。他却十分欢喜，要与我们拿那妖怪哩。”高老道：“是那里来的？”高才道：“他说是东土驾下差来的御弟圣僧，前往西天拜佛求经的。”太公道：“既是远来的和尚，怕不真有些手段。他如今在那里？”高才道：“现在门外等候。”那太公即忙换了衣服，与高才出来迎接，叫声“长老”。三藏听见，急转身，早已到了面前。那老者戴一顶乌绫巾，穿一领葱白蜀锦衣，踏一双糙米皮的犊子靴，系一条黑绿绦子，出来笑语相迎，便叫：“二位长老，作揖了。”三藏还了礼，行者站着不动。那老者见他相貌凶丑，便就不敢与他作揖。行者道：“怎么不唱老孙喏？”那老儿有几分害怕，叫高才道：“你这小厮却不弄杀我也？家里现有一个丑头怪脑的女婿打发不开，怎么又引这个雷公来害我？”行者道：“老高，你空长了许大年纪，还不省事！若专以相貌取人，干净错了。我老孙丑自丑，却有些本事，替你家擒得妖精，捉得鬼魅，拿住你那女婿，还了你女儿，便是好事，何必谆谆以相貌为言！”太公见说，战兢兢的，只得强打精神，叫声“请进”。这行者见请，才牵了白马，教高才挑着行李，与三藏进去。他也不管好歹，就把马拴在敞厅柱上，扯过一张退光漆交椅，叫三藏坐下。他又扯过一张椅子，坐在旁边。那高老道：</p>

<P>&#8220;The younger venerable elder has already made himself at home,&#8221; Squire Gao remarked.</P>

<P>When they were all seated the old man said, &#8220;The boy told me a moment ago that you were from the East.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's right,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;The court has sent me to worship the Buddha in the Western Heaven and ask for the scriptures. As we are passing this way on our journey, we would like to spend the night here before continuing on our way tomorrow morning.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you two gentlemen just want to spend the night here, why all the talk about catching monsters?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As we'll be spending the night here,&#8221; Monkey put in, &#8220;we though it would be fun to catch a few monsters while we're about it. May I ask how many there are in your residence?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Good heavens,&#8221; the old man exclaimed, &#8220;however many do you want? We've only got this monster of a son-in-law, and he's ruined our lives.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Tell me all about this monster from the beginning,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;I must know about his magic powers if I'm to capture him for you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This village has never had any trouble from ghosts, demons or evil spirits before. It was my misfortune to have no son, and three daughters, of whom the eldest is called Fragrant Orchid, the second Jade Orchid, and the third Blue Orchid. The other two were betrothed to men from the village when they were children and have been married off. I wanted the third to marry a man who would live here to support-me in my old age, look after the household, and do jobs about the place. About three years ago a good-looking young fellow turned up who said that his name was Zhu and he came from the Mountain of Blessing. He told me that he had no parents or brothers, and wanted to marry and live with his in-laws. As he had no family commitments I offered him my daughter's hand, old fool that I am, and from the moment he became a member of our family he worked very hard. He ploughed and hoed without using oxen or tools; and he didn't need a scythe or a stick to harvest the crops. As day followed day, there was nothing wrong with him, except that he started to look different.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;At first he was a plump, dark chap, but later on he became a long-nosed, big-eared idiot with thick black hairs running down from the back of his head and a great, thick body. His face is just like a pig's. His appetite is enormous, too. He needs several bushels of grain at every main meal, and over a hundred griddle-cakes for breakfast. Luckily he is a vegetarian. If he ate meat and wine he would have ruined us in six months.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He has to eat so much because he works so hard,&#8221; Sanzang commented.</P>
<P>&#8220;But that's not the main thing.&#8221; Squire Gao continued. &#8220;He can also summon up a wind, make clouds and mist come and go, and send pebbles and sand flying. He's terrified our neighbors, who don't feel safe living here any longer! He's shut my daughter away in the building at the back, and nobody's seen her for six months. We don't even know if she's still alive. That is how we know he's an evil monster, and why we want a priest to come and get rid of him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No difficulty there,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Don't worry, old chap, I guarantee that I'll get him tonight, make him write out a document divorcing your daughter, and bring her back to you. What do you say to that?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Because I thought there'd be no harm in offering him my daughter, I've ruined my reputation and estranged all my relations,&#8221; Squire Gao replied. &#8220;If you can catch him, why bother with a divorce document? Wipe him out for me, if you please.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Easy, easy,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'll get him tonight.&#8221;</P>

<p>坐定，高老问道：“适间小价说，二位长老是东土来的？”三藏道：“便是。贫僧奉朝命往西天拜佛求经，因过宝庄，特借一宿，明日早行。”高老道：“二位原是借宿的，怎么说会拿怪？”行者道：“因是借宿，顺便拿几个妖怪儿耍耍的。动问府上有多少妖怪？”高老道：“天哪！还吃得有多少哩！只这一个妖怪女婿，已彀他磨慌了！”行者道：“你把那妖怪的始末，有多大手段，从头儿说说我听，我好替你拿他。”高老道：“我们这庄上，自古至今，也不晓得有甚么鬼祟魍魉，邪魔作耗。只是老拙不幸，不曾有子，止生三个女儿：大的唤名香兰，第二的名玉兰，第三的名翠兰。那两个从小儿配与本庄人家，止有小的个，要招个女婿，指望他与我同家过活，做个养老女婿，撑门抵户，做活当差。不期三年前，有一个汉子，模样儿倒也精致，他说是福陵山上人家，姓猪，上无父母，下无兄弟，愿与人家做个女婿。我老拙见是这般一个无羁无绊的人，就招了他。一进门时，倒也勤谨：耕田耙地，不用牛具；收割田禾，不用刀杖。昏去明来，其实也好，只是一件，有些会变嘴脸。”行者道：“怎么变么？”高老道：“初来时，是一条黑胖汉，后来就变做一个长嘴大耳朵的呆子，脑后又有一溜鬃毛，身体粗糙怕人，头脸就象个猪的模样。食肠却又甚大：一顿要吃三五斗米饭，早间点心，也得百十个烧饼才彀。喜得还吃斋素，若再吃荤酒，便是老拙这些家业田产之类，不上半年，就吃个罄净！”三藏道：“只因他做得，所以吃得。”高老道：“吃还是件小事，他如今又会弄风，云来雾去，走石飞砂，唬得我一家并左邻右舍，俱不得安生。又把那翠兰小女关在后宅子里，一发半年也不曾见面，更不知死活如何。因此知他是个妖怪，要请个法师与他去退，去退。”行者道：“这个何难？老儿你管放心，今夜管情与你拿住，教他写了退亲文书，还你女儿如何？”高老大喜道：“我为招了他不打紧，坏了我多少清名，疏了我多少亲眷。但得拿住他，要甚么文书？就烦与我除了根罢。”行者道：“容易，容易！入夜之时，就见好歹。”</p>

<P>The old man was delighted. He had a table and chairs set out and wiped clean, and a vegetarian meal brought in. When the meal was over and he was about to go to bed, the old man asked, &#8220;What weapons and how many men will you need? I'll get everything ready in good time.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have a weapon,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;You two gentlemen only have your monastic staves&#8212;how will you be able to kill the fiend with them?&#8221; the old man asked. Monkey produced the embroidery needle from his ear, held it between his fingers, and shook it in the wind. It turned into the gold-banded cudgel as thick as a rice-bowl. Monkey turned to Squire Gao and asked, &#8220;How does this cudgel compare with the weapons you have in here? Will it do to kill the monster?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So you have the weapon,&#8221; the old man went on, &#8220;but what about the men?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I can do it single-handed.&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;though I would like a few respectable old gentlemen to come in and keep my master company while I'm away from him. When I've captured the monster they can witness his confession before I wipe him out for you.&#8221; The old man thereupon sent his servants to ask a few old friends over, and before long they had all arrived. When the introductions were over Monkey said, &#8220;Master, you sit here and don't worry. I'm off.&#8221;</P>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>老儿十分欢喜，才教展抹桌椅，摆列斋供。斋罢将晚，老儿问道：“要甚兵器？要多少人随？趁早好备。”行者道：“兵器我自有。”老儿道：“二位只是那根锡杖，锡杖怎么打得妖精？”行者随于耳内取出一个绣花针来，捻在手中，迎风幌了一幌，就是碗来粗细的一根金箍铁棒，对着高老道：“你看这条棍子，比你家兵器如何？可打得这怪否？”高老又道：“既有兵器，可要人跟？”行者道：“我不用人，只是要几个年高有德的老儿，陪我师父清坐闲叙，我好撇他而去。等我把那妖精拿来，对众取供，替你除了根罢。”那老儿即唤家僮，请了几个亲故朋友。一时都到，相见已毕，行者道：“师父，你放心稳坐，老孙去也。”</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<P>Just watch Monkey as with his cudgel in his hand he takes hold of the old man and says, &#8220;Take me to the building at the back. I want to see where this evil spirit lives.&#8221; Squire Gao led him to the door of the back building, and Monkey told him to bring the key at once. &#8220;Look here,&#8221; the old man answered, &#8220;if a key would have done the trick, I wouldn't have had to ask for your services.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Can't you tell at your age when someone's joking?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;I was only teasing. You shouldn't have taken me seriously.&#8221; He felt the lock and found that molten copper had been poured into it, so he struck it a vicious blow with his cudgel and shattered it. Pushing the doors open, he saw that it was pitch-black inside. &#8220;Call your daughter's name, Old Gao, to see whether she's in here,&#8221; he said.</P>
<P>The old man summoned up his courage and called her name, and the daughter, recognizing her father's voice, answered feebly, &#8220;Dad, I'm in here.&#8221; With a roll of his golden pupils Monkey peered into the darkness to take a closer look at her. Do you know what she was like?</P>


<P>Her cloudy hair was tangled and unkempt,</P>
<P>Her face was filthy and unwashed.</P>
<P>Her orchid heart was as pure as ever,</P>
<P>But her beauty lay in ruins.</P>
<P>There was no blood or life in her cherry lips,</P>
<P>And her limbs were crooked and bent.</P>
<P>A sad frown on her forehead,</P>
<P>Her eyebrows pale;</P>
<P>Weak and frightened,</P>
<P>Only daring to whisper.</P>


<P>When she came out and saw her father, she grabbed hold of him, put her hand round his head, and wept. &#8220;Don't cry,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;don't cry. Where has the monster gone?&#8221;</P>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>你看他揝着铁棒，扯着高老道：“你引我去后宅子里妖精的住处看看。”高老遂引他到后宅门首，行者道：“你去取钥匙来。”高老道：“你且看看，若是用得钥匙，却不请你了。”行者笑道：“你那老儿，年纪虽大，却不识耍。我把这话儿哄你一哄，你就当真。”走上前，摸了一摸，原来是铜汁灌的锁子。狠得他将金箍棒一捣，捣开门扇，里面却黑洞洞的。行者道：“老高，你去叫你女儿一声，看他可在里面。”那老儿硬着胆叫道：“三姐姐！”那女儿认得是他父亲的声音，才少气无力的应了一声道：“爹爹，我在这里哩。”行者闪金睛，向黑影里仔细看时，你道他怎生模样？但见那：云鬓乱堆无掠，玉容未洗尘淄。一片兰心依旧，十分娇态倾颓。樱唇全无气血，腰肢屈屈偎偎。愁蹙蹙，蛾眉淡，瘦怯怯，语声低。他走来看见高老，一把扯住，抱头大哭。行者道：“且莫哭！且莫哭”！我问你，妖怪往那里去了？”</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<P>&#8220;I don't know. These days he's been setting out at dawn and only coming back in the middle of the night. There's always so much cloud and mist that I can't tell where he goes. He knows that my father wants to exorcise him, so he's always on the alert. That's why he comes back late and leaves at dawn.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Of course he would,&#8221; Monkey remarked, adding, &#8220;old fellow, take the girl to the front building. You two can have a good long talk; I'm going to wait for the monster here. Don't be surprised if he doesn't turn up; but if he does, I'll wipe him out for you.&#8221; The old man happily took his daughter to the front building.</P>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>女子道：“不知往那里走。这些时，天明就去，入夜方来，云云雾雾，往回不知何所。因是晓得父亲要祛退他，他也常常防备，故此昏来朝去。”行者道：“不消说了，老儿，你带令爱往前边宅里，慢慢的叙阔，让老孙在此等他。他若不来，你却莫怪；他若来了，定与你剪草除根。”那老高欢欢喜喜的，把女儿带将前去。</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<P>Monkey then used some of his magic powers to turn himself into the likeness of the girl with a shake of his body. Then he sat down in the room to wait for the evil spirit. Before long there was a marvellous wind that sent stones and dust flying:</P>


<P>At first it was a gentle breeze,</P>
<P>That gradually became a tremendous gale.</P>
<P>When it was a gentle breeze, it filled Heaven and Earth;</P>
<P>When it grew, nothing could withstand it.</P>


<P>It stripped off flowers and snapped willows like stalks of hemp,</P>
<P>Uprooting forests as if it were picking vegetables.</P>
<P>It threw rivers and seas into turmoil, to the fury of gods and devils,</P>
<P>Splitting rocks and mountains as Heaven and Earth watched in horror.</P>


<P>The flower-eating deer lost their way,</P>
<P>The fruit-plucking monkeys did not know where they were.</P>
<P>Seven-storied iron pagodas fell on the Buddha's head,</P>
<P>The streamers in the temple fell on the jeweled canopy.</P>


<P>Golden beams and pillars of jade were shaken from their roots,</P>
<P>Tiles flew from the roof like swallows.</P>
<P>As the boatman raised his oar he made a vow,</P>
<P>Quickly sacrificing a pig and a goat as he pushed off.</P>


<P>The guardian god of the city ward abandoned his shrine,</P>
<P>The Dragon Kings of the Four Seas bowed to Heaven.</P>
<P>The yaksha demons' boats were wrecked on the coast,</P>
<P>And half the length of the Great Wall was blown down.</P>


<P>As this gale wind passed, an evil spirit appeared in mid-air. He was certainly ugly with his dark face, stubbly hair, long nose, and big ears. He wore a cotton tunic that was somewhere between black and blue, and round his waist was a patterned cotton cloth. &#8220;So that's what he's like,&#8221; thought Monkey with a secret smile, and without greeting him or asking him anything he lay down on the bed, breathing heavily and pretending to be ill. Not knowing who this really was, the monster came straight in, put his arms around him and was going to kiss him.</P>
<P>Monkey laughed to himself again as he thought, &#8220;So he really wants to screw me.&#8221; Then he thrust his hand up under the monster's long nose to throw him off balance. The monster fell off the bed.</P>
<P>As the monster pulled himself up he leaned on the edge of the bed and said, &#8220;Darling, why are you so angry with me today? Is it because I'm late?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm not angry,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;not angry at all.&#8221;</P>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>行者却弄神通，摇身一变，变得就如那女子一般，独自个坐在房里等那妖精。不多时，一阵风来，真个是走石飞砂。好风：起初时微微荡荡，向后来渺渺茫茫。微微荡荡乾坤大，渺渺茫茫无阻碍。凋花折柳胜揌麻，倒树摧林如拔菜。翻江搅海鬼神愁，裂石崩山天地怪。衔花糜鹿失来踪，摘果猿猴迷在外。七层铁塔侵佛头，八面幢幡伤宝盖。金梁玉柱起根摇，房上瓦飞如燕块。举棹梢公许愿心，开船忙把猪羊赛。当坊土地弃祠堂，四海龙王朝上拜。海边撞损夜叉船，长城刮倒半边塞。那阵狂风过处，只见半空里来了一个妖精，果然生得丑陋：黑脸短毛，长喙大耳，穿一领青不青、蓝不蓝的梭布直裰，系一条花布手巾。行者暗笑道：“原来是这个买卖！”好行者，却不迎他，也不问他，且睡在床上推病，口里哼哼喷喷的不绝。那怪不识真假，走进房，一把搂住，就要亲嘴。行者暗笑道：“真个要来弄老孙哩！”即使个拿法，托着那怪的长嘴，叫做个小跌。漫头一料，扑的掼下床来。那怪爬起来，扶着床边道：“姐姐，你怎么今日有些怪我？想是我来得迟了？”行者道：“不怪！不怪！”</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<P>&#8220;If you're not angry with me, why did you make me fall over?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You should have been more thoughtful and not tried hugging me and kissing me. I'm not feeling very well today. If I'd been my usual self I'd have been waiting for you at the door. Take your clothes off and come to bed.&#8221; Not realizing what he was up to, the monster undressed. Monkey jumped out of bed and sat on the pot as the monster went back to bed and groped around without finding the girl.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where've you gone, darling?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Take your clothes off and come to bed.&#8221;</P>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>那妖道：“既不怪我，怎么就丢我这一跌？”行者道：“你怎么就这等样小家子，就搂我亲嘴？我因今日有些不自在，若每常好时，便起来开门等你了。你可脱了衣服睡是。”那怪不解其意，真个就去脱衣。行者跳起来，坐在净桶上。那怪依旧复来床上摸一把，摸不着人，叫道：“姐姐，你往那里去了？请脱衣服睡罢。”</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<P>&#8220;Go to sleep,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;I'm taking a shit.&#8221; The monster did as he was told. Monkey sighed and said, &#8220;What terrible luck.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What are you so fed up about?&#8221; the monster asked. &#8220;What do you mean by 'terrible luck'? I may have eaten some food and drunk some tea since marrying you, but I haven't been idle either. I've swept for your family and dug ditches, I've shifted bricks and tiles, I've built walls for you, I've ploughed and weeded your fields, I've sown your wheat, and I've transplanted your rice. I've made your family's fortune. These days you dress in brocade and have golden pins in your hair. You have fruit and flowers in all four seasons, and vegetables for the pot throughout the year. But despite this you're still not satisfied, groaning and moaning like that and complaining about your 'terrible luck.'&#8221;</P>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>行者道：“你先睡，等我出个恭来”那怪果先解衣上床。行者忽然叹口气，道声“造化低了！”那怪道：“你恼怎的？造化怎么得低的？我得到了你家，虽是吃了些茶饭，却也不曾白吃你的：我也曾替你家扫地通沟，搬砖运瓦，筑土打墙，耕田耙地，种麦插秧，创家立业。如今你身上穿的锦，戴的金，四时有花果享用，八节有蔬菜烹煎，你还有那些儿不趁心处，这般短叹长吁，说甚么造化低了？”</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<P>&#8220;I didn't mean that,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Today I could hear my parents through the wall. They were smashing up bricks and tiles and pretending to curse and beat me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why should they want to do that?&#8221; the monster asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;They said that since we married and you became their resident son-in-law, all respectability has gone by the board. They were complaining about having such an ugly fellow as you around, and about never meeting any brother-in-law or other relations of yours. Besides, with all that wind and cloud whenever you come in or go out, they wonder who on earth you can be and what you are called. You're ruining their reputation, and disgracing the family. That's why they were so angry that they went through the motions of beating and cursing me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I may be a bit of an eyesore,&#8221; the monster said, &#8220;but if you want me to be a good-looker I can fix that without any difficulty. When I first came I had a word with your father, and he agreed to the marriage of his own free will. Why is he talking like this now?&#8221; My home is the Cloud Pathway Cave on the Mount of Blessing. My surname, Zhu, is like my face&#8212;piggy&#8212;and my correct name is Zhu Ganglie, Iron-Haired pig. You tell them all that if they ask you again.</P>
<P>&#8220;He's an honest monster,&#8221; thought Monkey with delight. &#8220;If he came out with all this without being tortured. Now I know who he is and where he's from, I'm sure I can catch him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He's sent for a priest to come and catch you,&#8221; Monkey said aloud.</P>
<P>&#8220;Come to bed, come to bed, and forget about him,&#8221; the monster said with a laugh. &#8220;I can do as many transformations as the Plough, and I have my nine-pronged rake too, so what have I to fear from priests, monks or Taoists? Even if your old man were holy enough to summon the Demon-destroying Patriarch down from the Ninth Heaven, he's an old friend of mine and wouldn't do anything to harm me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My father said that he'd asked that fellow by the name of Sun, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven who made such trouble up in the Heavenly Palace some five hundred years ago, to come and capture you.&#8221;</P>
<P>The monster was somewhat taken aback on hearing this name, and said, &#8220;In that case I'm off. We're through.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You can't just go like that,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;You wouldn't know,&#8221; the monster replied, &#8220;but that Protector of the Horses who made such trouble in the Heavenly Palace is quite a fighter. I might not be able to beat him, and that would spoil my good name.&#8221; With these words he pulled on his clothes, opened the door, and was just going out when Monkey grabbed him, gave his own face a rub, and changed back into his real form.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where d'you think you're going, my fine monster?&#8221; he roared, adding, &#8220;take a look and see who I am.&#8221; The monster turned round and saw Monkey's protruding teeth, pinched face, fiery eyes with golden pupil, bald head and hairy face. At the sight of this thunder god incarnate his hands were numbed and his legs paralyzed; then with a great tearing sound he broke free, ripping his clothes, and escaped in the form of a hurricane. Monkey rushed after him, grabbed his iron cudgel, and took a swipe at the wind. The monster then changed into ten thousand sparks and went straight back to his mountain. Monkey mounted his cloud and went after him shouting, &#8220;Where d'you think you're going? If you go up to Heaven, I'll chase you as far as the Dipper and Bull Palace, and if you go into the Earth, I'll pursue you as far as the Hell of the Unjustly Slain.&#8221;</P>

<P>Goodness! If you don't know how far he chased the monster, or who won in the end, listen to the explanation in the next chapter.</P>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>行者道：“不是这等说。今日我的父母，隔着墙，丢砖料瓦的，甚是打我骂我哩。”那怪道：“他打骂你怎的？”行者道：“他说我和你做了夫妻，你是他门下一个女婿，全没些儿礼体。这样个丑嘴脸的人，又会不得姨夫，又见不得亲戚，又不知你云来雾去，端的是那里人家，姓甚名谁，败坏他清德，玷辱他门风，故此这般打骂，所以烦恼。”那怪道：“我虽是有些儿丑陋，若要俊，却也不难。我一来时，曾与他讲过，他愿意方才招我，今日怎么又说起这话！我家住在福陵山云栈洞。我以相貌为姓，故姓猪，官名叫做猪刚鬣。他若再来问你，你就以此话与他说便了。”行者暗喜道：“那怪却也老实，不用动刑，就供得这等明白。既有了地方姓名，不管怎的也拿住他。”行者道：“他要请法师来拿你哩。”那怪笑道：“睡着！睡着！莫睬他！我有天罡数的变化，九齿的钉钯，怕甚么法师、和尚、道士？就是你老子有虔心，请下九天荡魔祖师下界，我也曾与他做过相识，他也不敢怎的我。”行者道：“他说请一个五百年前大闹天宫姓孙的齐天大圣，要来拿你哩。”那怪闻得这个名头，就有三分害怕道：“既是这等说，我去了罢，两口子做不成了。”行者道：“你怎的就去？”那怪道：“你不知道，那闹天宫的弼马温，有些本事，只恐我弄他不过，低了名头，不象模样。”他套上衣服，开了门，往外就走，被行者一把扯住，将自己脸上抹了一抹，现出原身，喝道：“好妖怪，那里走！你抬头看看我是那个？”那怪转过眼来，看见行者咨牙俫嘴，火眼金睛，磕头毛脸，就是个活雷公相似，慌得他手麻脚软，划剌的一声，挣破了衣服，化狂风脱身而去。行者急上前，掣铁棒，望风打了一下。那怪化万道火光，径转本山而去。行者驾云，随后赶来，叫声：“那里走！你若上天，我就赶到斗牛宫！你若入地，我就追至枉死狱！”咦！毕竟不知这一去赶至何方，有何胜败，且听下回分解。</p>
