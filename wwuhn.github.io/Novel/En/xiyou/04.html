<P>Dissatisfied at Being Appointed Protector of the Horses</P>
<P>Not Content with the Title of Equal of Heaven</P>
</div>
<P>The Great White Planet left the depths of the cave with the Handsome Monkey King, and they ascended together on their clouds. As Sun Wukong's somersault cloud was exceptionally fast he reached the Southern Gate of Heaven first, leaving the Great White planet far behind. Just as he was putting away his cloud to go in, his way was barred by the Heavenly Guardian Virudhaka and his powerful heavenly soldiers Liu, Gou, Bi, Deng, Xin, Zhang, and Tao, who blocked the gate of Heaven with their spears and swords and refused to let him in.</P>
<P>&#8220;This old Great White planet is a trickster,&#8221; said Sun Wukong. &#8220;He invited me here, so he has no business to have me kept out with spears and swords.&#8221; Just as he was kicking up a row the Planet suddenly arrived.</P>
<P>Sun Wukong flung his accusation at him: &#8220;Why did you play this trick on me, you old fogy? You told me you came with an Edict of Amnesty from the Jade Emperor to invite me here, so why did you arrange for these people not to let me in through the gate of Heaven?&#8221; The Great White Planet laughed.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be angry, Your Majesty. You've never been here before, your name is not on the books here, and the heavenly soldiers have never met you. Of course they could not let you in just for the asking. But when you've seen His Celestial Majesty and been given office among the Immortals, you will be able to come and go as you wish, and nobody will try to stop you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Be that as it may,&#8221; said Sun Wukong, &#8220;I'm not going in.&#8221; The Great White Planet would not let him go and asked him to go in with him in spite of it all.</P>
<P>As they approached the gate, the Planet shouted, &#8220;Heavenly officers of the gates of Heaven, sergeants and soldiers, let us in. This is an Immortal from the lower world, and I am carrying an edict from the Jade Emperor summoning him here.&#8221; Only then did the Heavenly King Zengzhang and his soldiers withdraw their arms and stand back. Now the Monkey King began to trust the Great White Planet. He walked slowly in with him and looked at the view. Truly it was his</P>


<P>First ascent to the upper world,</P>
<P>Sudden entry into paradise.</P>
<P>Ten thousand beams of golden light shone with a reddish glow;</P>
<P>A thousand strands of propitious vapour puffed out purple mist.</P>
<P>See the Southern Gate of Heaven,</P>
<P>Deep green,</P>
<P>Crystalline,</P>
<P>Shimmering bright,</P>
<P>Studded with jewels.</P>
<P>On either side stood scores of heavenly marshals,</P>
<P>Tall as the roofbeams, next to the pillars,</P>
<P>Holding metal-tipped bows and banners.</P>
<P>All around stood gods in golden armour,</P>
<P>Brandishing their clubs and halberds,</P>
<P>Wielding their cutlasses and swords.</P>
<P>The outside was remarkable enough,</P>
<P>But the inside astonished him.</P>
<P>Here were several mighty pillars,</P>
<P>Round which coiled tawny-bearded dragons, their gold scales gleaming in the sun.</P>
<P>There were long bridges,</P>
<P>Where strutted phoenixes, brilliant of plumage and with bright red crests.</P>
<P>A rosy glow shone with heavenly light;</P>
<P>Thick green mists obscured the Pole Star.</P>
<P>In this heaven there are thirty-three heavenly palaces:</P>
<P>The Palace of Clouds Dispersed, the Vaisravana Palace, the palace of</P>
<P>Five Lores, the Sun Palace, the Palace of Flowery Bliss,</P>
<P>Every palace had golden animals on its roof.</P>
<P>Then there were seventy-two precious halls:</P>
<P>The Hall of Morning Audience, the Hall of Rising into Space, the Precious Light Hall, the Hall of the Heavenly Kings, the Hall of the Master of Miracles,</P>
<P>Jade unicorns on every column.</P>
<P>On the Terrace of the Star of Longevity</P>
<P>Grew flowers that never wither.</P>
<P>Beside the Stove for Decocting Elixir,</P>
<P>Were herbs that stay green for ever.</P>
<P>In front of the Facing the Sage pavilion</P>
<P>Crimson gauze clothes Glittered like stars;</P>
<P>Lotus hats</P>
<P>Shone with gold and jade.</P>
<P>Jade hairpins and pearl-sewn shoes,</P>
<P>Golden seals on purple cords.</P>
<P>As the golden bell tolled,</P>
<P>The three classes of divinities approached the steps and submitted memorials.</P>
<P>As the heavenly drum was beaten,</P>
<P>Ten thousand sage kings attended the Jade Emperor.</P>
<P>Then they entered the Hall of Miraculous Mist,</P>
<P>Where jade doors were studded with gold,</P>
<P>And phoenixes danced before the crimson gates.</P>
<P>Winding arcades,</P>
<P>Everywhere carved in openwork;</P>
<P>Layer on Layer of eaves,</P>
<P>With dragons and phoenixes soaring.</P>
<P>On top was a majestically purple,</P>
<P>Bright,</P>
<P>Perfectly round,</P>
<P>And dazzling</P>
<P>Golden gourd-shaped finial;</P>
<P>Below, fans hung from the hands of heavenly consorts,</P>
<P>While jade maidens proffered magic clothes.</P>
<P>Ferocious</P>
<P>The heavenly generals guarding the court;</P>
<P>Majestic</P>
<P>The immortal officials protecting the throne.</P>
<P>In the middle were set Crystal dishes</P>
<P>Filled to overflowing with Great Monad Pills;</P>
<P>Agate jars</P>
<P>In which stood twisted coral trees.</P>
<P>All the wonderful things in Heaven were there,</P>
<P>None of which are seen on Earth:</P>
<P>Golden gates, silver chariots, and a purple palace;</P>
<P>Precious plants, jade flowers, and jasper petals.</P>
<P>The jade hares of the princes at court ran past the alter;</P>
<P>The golden rooks of the sages present flew down low.</P>
<P>The Monkey King was fated to come to Heaven,</P>
<P>Rather than be sullied by the mortal world.</P>


<P>The Great White Planet led the Handsome Monkey King to the outside of the Hall of Miraculous Mist. He went straight in to the imperial presence without waiting to be summoned, and did obeisance to the throne.</P>
<P>Sun Wukong stood bolt upright beside him, not bothering with any court etiquette, but just concentrating on listening to the Great White Planet make his report to the Jade Emperor: &#8220;In obedience to the Divine Edict, your subject has brought the demon Immortal here.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Jade Emperor lowered his curtain and asked, &#8220;And which of you is the demon Immortal?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Me,&#8221; replied Sun Wukong, only now making a slight bow.</P>
<P>The faces of the officials went white with horror as they exclaimed, &#8220;What a savage monkey! He has the impudence to answer 'Me,' and without even prostrating himself first! He must die!&#8221;</P>
<P>In reply to this the Jade Emperor announced, &#8220;Sun Wukong is a demon Immortal of the lower world who has only just obtained human form, so he is not acquainted with court procedure. We shall forgive him this time.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We thank you for your mercy,&#8221; said the immortal ministers. Only then did Sun Wukong express his respect by bowing low and chanting &#8220;na-a-aw&quot; at the top of his voice. The Jade Emperor ordered his immortal civil and military officials to find a vacancy in some department for Sun Wukong.</P>
<P>The Star Lord Wuqu stepped forward form the side and reported, &#8220;There are no vacancies in any of the palaces, halls, and departments of Heaven except for a superintendent in the Imperial Stables.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Then make him Protector of the Horses,&#8221; ordered the Jade Emperor. All the ministers thanked him for his mercy, apart from Sun Wukong, who just expressed his respect with a loud &#8220;na-a-aw.&#8221; The Jade Emperor then told the Wood Planet to take him to the Imperial Stables.</P>
<P>The Wood Planet accompanied the delighted Monkey King to his post and then went back to the palace. The Monkey King then called together the deputy and the assistant superintendent, the book-keeper, the grooms, and all the other officials, high and low, to find out about the duties of his department. He found that he had to look after a thousand heavenly horses:</P>


<P>Chestnuts and stallions,</P>
<P>Courser and chargers:</P>
<P>Dragon and Purple Swallow,</P>
<P>Pegasus and Sushun,</P>
<P>Jueti and Silver,</P>
<P>Yaoniao and Flying Yellow,</P>
<P>Taotu and Feathers,</P>
<P>Red Hare and Faster Than Light,</P>
<P>Dazzler and Horizon,</P>
<P>Mist-soarer and Victory;</P>
<P>Wind-chaser and Matchless,</P>
<P>Flying Wing and Galloping Mist,</P>
<P>Lazy Whirlwind and Red Lightning,</P>
<P>Bronze Cup and Drifting Cloud,</P>
<P>Skewbald and Tiger-Stripe,</P>
<P>Dustfree and Purple Scales,</P>
<P>The Four Ferghana Steeds,</P>
<P>The Eight Chargers and Nine Gallopers,</P>
<P>Coursers that can cover three hundred miles&#8212;</P>
<P>All these fine horses were</P>
<P>Neighing in the wind, chasing the lightning, mighty in spirit;</P>
<P>Pawing the mist, climbing the clouds, great in their strength.</P>


<P>The Monkey King looked through the register and counted the horses. In the stables the book-keeper was responsible for ordering the fodder, the head groom was in charge of currying the horses, chopping up and cooking the fodder, and giving them water; the deputy superintendent and his assistant helped to oversee the work. The Protector of the Horses looked after his charges, sleeping neither by day nor by night. It is true that he fooled around by day, but at night he looked after the animals with great diligence, waking them up and making them eat whenever they fell asleep, and leading those still on their feet to the trough. At the sight of him the heavenly horses would prick up their ears and paw the ground, and they became fat and plump. Thus more than half a month slipped by.</P>
<P>On one morning that was a holiday all the officials of the stables held a feast both to welcome and congratulate the Protector of the Horses.</P>
<P>In the middle of the party the Monkey King suddenly put down his cup and asked, &#8220;What sort of office is this 'Protector of the Horses?'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What the name suggests, that's all.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Which official grading does it carry?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Unclassified.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What does 'unclassified' mean?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Bottom grade,&#8221; the others replied, going on to explain, &#8220;It is a very low and unimportant office, and all you can do in it is look after the horses. Even someone who works as conscientiously as Your Honour and gets the horses so fat will get no more reward than someone saying 'good'; and if anything goes at all wrong you will be held responsible, and if the losses are serious you will be fined and punished.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Monkey King flared up on hearing this, gnashed his teeth, and said in a great rage, &#8220;How dare they treat me with such contempt? On the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit I am a king and a patriarch. How dare he trick me into coming here to feed his horses for him? It's a low job for youngsters, not for me. I won't do it, I won't. I'm going back.&#8221; He pushed the table over with a crash, took his treasure out of his ear, and shook it. It became as thick as a rice bowl, and he brandished it as he charged out of the Imperial Stables to the Southern Gate of Heaven. As the celestial guards knew that his name was on the register of immortal officials they did not dare to block his path, but let him out through the gate.</P>
<P>He descended by cloud and was back on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit in an instant. Seeing the four Stalwart Generals and all the kings of the monsters drilling their troops there he shouted in a shrill voice, &#8220;Children, I'm back.&#8221; The monkeys all bowed to him, took him into the heart of the cave, and asked him to sit on his throne, while they prepared a banquet to welcome him back.</P>
<P>&#8220;Congratulations, Your Majesty,&#8221; they all said. &#8220;After over a dozen years up there you must be coming back in glory and triumph.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean, over a dozen years?&#8221; asked the Monkey King. &#8220;I've only been away for a fortnight or so.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty can't have noticed the time passing in heaven. A day in heaven lasts as long as a year on earth. May we ask what office you held?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It hurts me to tell you,&#8221; replied the Monkey King with a wave of his hand. &#8220;I feel thoroughly humiliated. That Jade Emperor doesn't know how to use a good man. A man like me&#8212;'Protector of the Horses'. That meant I had to feed his animals for him and wasn't even given an official grading. I didn't know this at first, so I fooled around in the Imperial Stables until today, when I found out from my colleagues how low the job was. I was so angry that I pushed the table over and quit the job. That's why I've come back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Quite right too,&#8221; the other monkeys said. &#8220;Your Majesty can be king in our cave paradise and enjoy as much honour and pleasure as you like, so why go and be his groom?&#8221; Then they gave orders for wine to be brought at once to cheer their king up.</P>
<P>As they were drinking someone came in to report, &#8220;Your Majesty, there are two Single-horned Devil Kings outside who want to see you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Ask them in,&#8221; said the Monkey King, and the two formally-dressed devil kings hurried into the cave and prostrated themselves.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why have you come to see me?&#8221; asked the Handsome Monkey King<SUB>;</SUB> and they replied, &#8220;We have long heard that Your Majesty is looking for men of talent, but we were unable to see you before. Now that Your Majesty has been given heavenly office and come back in triumph, we would like to offer you this yellow robe as a token of our congratulations. We also hope that you will not reject us although we are low and worthless, but will accept our humble services.&#8221; An exultant Monkey King put on the yellow robe and his happy subjects bowed to him in order of precedence. The two devil kings were appointed Commanders of the Van, and when they had thanked the Monkey King for this they asked, &#8220;What office did Your Majesty hold while you were all that time in Heaven?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The Jade Emperor has no respect for talent,&#8221; replied the Monkey King. &#8220;He made me something called 'Protector of the Horses.'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty has such miraculous powers: you should never have been feeding his horses for him. You should have been made a 'Great Sage Equaling Heaven,' shouldn't you?&#8221; The Monkey King was beside himself with delight at this suggestion, and he kept saying how splendid it was.</P>
<P>&#8220;Get me a banner made at once with the words 'Great Sage Equaling Heaven' in big letters on it, and put up a pole to hang it from,&#8221; he ordered his four Stalwart Generals. &#8220;From now on I am to be called 'Great Sage Equaling Heaven,' not 'Your Majesty' or 'King'. Pass this order on to all the other kings of the monsters.&#8221; We will leave him at this point.</P>


<P>When the Jade Emperor held his morning court the next day the Heavenly Teacher Zhang led the deputy and assistant superintendents of the Imperial Stables to the vermilion steps, bowed low, and reported, &#8220;Your Majesty, Sun Wukong, the new Protector of the Horses, left Heaven yesterday because he thought his office was too humble.&#8221;</P>
<P>Just as he was speaking the Heavenly Guardian Virudhaka came from the Southern Gate of Heaven with his heavenly soldiers and reported, &#8220;The Protector of the Horses has gone out through the gate. We do not know why.&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing this the Jade Emperor commanded, &#8220;Let the two divine officials return to their posts; we shall send heavenly soldiers to capture this devil.&#8221;</P>
<P>The pagoda-bearing Heavenly King Li Jing and Prince Nezha stepped forward from the ranks of those attending the audience, and they memorialized, &#8220;Your Imperial Majesty, we beg you to command us, your incompetent servants, to subdue this fiend.&#8221; The Emperor was delighted with this suggestion, and he appointed the Pagoda-bearing Heavenly King as Demon quelling High Marshal, and Prince Nezha as Great God of the Seas. He told them to take their forces down to the lower world at once.</P>
<P>Heavenly King Li and Nezha kowtowed, took their leave, went straight back to their own palace, and assembled their troops, commanders and officers. They put the Mighty Miracle God in charge of the vanguard, and General Fishbelly in command of the rear, while General Yaksa was made adjutant. Within an instant they were outside the Southern Gate of Heaven, and they went straight to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. They chose a piece of level and open ground on which to construct a fortified camp, and ordered the Mighty Miracle God to issue the challenge to battle. On receiving this order the Mighty Miracle God tied on his armour firmly and went to the Water Curtain Cave, holding his flower-spreading battle-axe. When he got there he saw huge numbers of devils&#8212;wolves, tigers and leopards&#8212;wielding spears, brandishing swords, leaping around, fighting each other, and making a great noise outside the little entrance to the cave.</P>
<P>&#8220;Accursed beasts,&#8221; shouted the Mighty Miracle God, &#8220;tell the Protector of the Horses at once that I am a heavenly general come on the orders of the Jade Emperor to subdue him. If you make him come out and surrender immediately it will save the lot of you from being wiped out.&#8221;</P>
<P>The devils went rushing into the cave and reported, &#8220;Disaster, disaster.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What disaster?&#8221; the Monkey King asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;There's a heavenly general outside who says he's come on the orders of the Jade Emperor to subdue you. If you go out and surrender immediately, he says he'll spare our lives.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Fetch me my armour,&#8221; said the Monkey King. He then donned his golden helmet, tied on his golden armour, put on his cloud-walking shoes, and took his As-You-Will gold-banded cudgel in his hand. He led his troops out of the cave and drew them up in battle array. The Mighty Miracle God gazed wide-eyed at the excellent Monkey King:</P>


<P>On his body was gleaming golden armour,</P>
<P>On his head a dazzling golden helmet,</P>
<P>In his hand a gold-banded club,</P>
<P>On his feet a pair of cloud-walking shoes to match.</P>
<P>His devil eyes shone like stars,</P>
<P>His ears were long and hard.</P>
<P>His sturdy frame could be transformed at will,</P>
<P>His voice rang clearly as a bell.</P>
<P>The sharp-mouthed Horse Protector with protruding teeth</P>
<P>Wanted to become a Sage Equaling Heaven.</P>


<P>The Mighty Miracle God shouted in a harsh voice, &#8220;Insolent ape! Don't you recognize me?&#8221;</P>
<P>The Great Sage Sun Wukong replied at once, &#8220;I've never met you before. How should I know which wretched little deity you are? Tell me your name at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll get you, you conceited baboon. So you don't know who I am? I am the Heavenly General Mighty Miracle, the commander of the vanguard for Heavenly King Li, the Pagoda-bearer. I have come here on the orders of the Jade Emperor to accept your surrender. Take off your armour at once and submit to the mercy of Heaven, or I'll wipe out every animal on the mountain. And if you so much as hint at a refusal, I'll smash you to powder.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop talking so big, you lousy god,&#8221; retorted the furious Monkey King, &#8220;and give that long tongue of yours a rest. I'd just love to kill you with this cudgel of mine, but if I did there'd be no one to deliver my message for me, so I'll spare your life. Hurry back to Heaven and tell that Jade Emperor that he doesn't know how to use a good man. Why did he make me waste my infinite powers on feeding his horses for him? Take a look at what's written on my standard. If he's willing to give me this title officially, I'll call off my troops and let Heaven and Earth continue in peace; but if he refuses I'm coming up to the Hall of Miraculous Mist to knock him off his dragon throne.&#8221; When the Mighty Miracle God heard this he looked hard and saw that a tall pole had been planted outside the entrance to the cave, on which hung a banner reading GREAT SAGE EQUALING HEAVEN.</P>
<P>&#8220;Heh, heh, heh,&#8221; he mocked, &#8220;you ignorant ape. What shameless effrontery, to want to be a 'Great Sage Equaling Heaven!' Take that!&#8221; He swung with his battle-axe at the Monkey King who, quite unflustered, parried with his gold banded cudgel. It was a fine battle:</P>


<P>The cudgel was called As-You-Will,</P>
<P>The axe was named Flower Spreader.</P>
<P>As soon as the two met,</P>
<P>You could not tell which was better:</P>
<P>Axe and club</P>
<P>Locked together.</P>
<P>One was concealing his magic powers,</P>
<P>One was a big-mouthed boaster.</P>
<P>They used their magic</P>
<P>To breathe out cloud and mist;</P>
<P>When they opened their hands</P>
<P>They scattered sand and dust.</P>
<P>The heavenly general was a master of magic;</P>
<P>Endless were the changes the Monkey King could make.</P>
<P>When the cudgel was raised it was like a dragon playing in the water;</P>
<P>As the axe came down it was a phoenix among the flowers.</P>
<P>Although the fame of Miracle was known throughout the world,</P>
<P>His skill was no match for his enemy.</P>
<P>If the Great Sage lightly twirled his club,</P>
<P>A mere touch would paralyze.</P>


<P>The Mighty Miracle God was no match for his opponent. He hastened to block the Monkey King's first blow with his axe, which broke in two with a crunch. He fled for his life as fast as he could, and the Monkey King said mockingly, &#8220;You bag of pus, I'll spare you this time. Hurry back with my message, and look sharp about it.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Mighty Miracle God returned to his camp, went straight to the Pagoda-bearing Heavenly King Li Jing, knelt before him, and said with an awkward laugh, &#8220;The Protector of the Horses has really tremendous magic powers. I was no match for him. He beat me, and now I have come to take my punishment.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This fool has ruined our morale,&#8221; exploded the Heavenly King Li in a fury. &#8220;Take him away, and off with his head.&#8221;</P>
<P>Prince Nezha, who was standing to one side, stepped forward, bowed, and said, &#8220;Do not be angry, Your Majesty. Forgive the Mighty Miracle God, and let me go and do battle; then we'll see who's boss.&#8221; The heavenly king accepted his advice, and told Mighty Miracle God to go back and look after the camp while he awaited his punishment.</P>
<P>When he had put on his armour and helmet, Prince Nezha charged straight out of the camp to the Water Curtain Cave. Sun Wukong, who was just going to pull back his troops, saw the ferocity of his onslaught. What a fine prince he was:</P>


<P>His hair in tufts barely covers his scalp,</P>
<P>His cloak not over his shoulders.</P>
<P>How striking his intelligence,</P>
<P>How elegant his air.</P>
<P>Indeed he is the scion of a unicorn in Heaven;</P>
<P>In truth he is a phoenix Immortal from the clouds.</P>
<P>The seed of dragons is different from the common herd;</P>
<P>This fine youth is not at all like mortals.</P>
<P>With him he carries six divine weapons;</P>
<P>Endless his transformations as he soars through the air.</P>
<P>Now he has received an edict from the Jade Emperor's mouth,</P>
<P>Making him Commander of the Three Temples of the Masses.</P>


<P>Sun Wukong went up to him and asked, &#8220;Whose little boy are you then? What do you mean, charging up to my door?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stinking monkey fiend,&#8221; shouted Prince Nezha, &#8220;don't you know who I am? I am Nezha, the third son of the pagoda-bearing Heavenly King, and I have been commanded by the Jade Emperor to come here and arrest you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You do talk big, don't you, little prince,&#8221; said Sun Wukong, laughing at him. &#8220;But as you've still got all your milk teeth and are still wet behind the ears I'll spare your life and I won't hit you. Do you see what it says on my standard? Go and tell the Jade Emperor that if he gives me that title I'll call off my armies and submit to him once more. But if he doesn't do what I want him to, I'll surely attack the Hall of Miraculous Mist.&#8221; Nezha looked up and saw the words &#8220;Great Sage Equaling Heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You wicked monkey! How dare you give yourself a title like that, whatever your magic powers may be! Don't worry, all you're getting is my sword.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Give me a few swipes, then,&#8221; replied Sun Wukong, &#8220;I won't move.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Change,&#8221; yelled Nezha in a passion, and at once he had three heads and six arms, which made him look most ferocious. In his hands he held six weapons, a demon-beheading sword, a demon-hacking cutlass, a demon-binding rope, a demon-quelling pestle, an embroidered ball, and a fire-wheel&#8212;and wielding all these he rushed straight at Sun Wukong.</P>
<P>At the sight of him Sun Wukong exclaimed with astonishment, &#8220;Well, my boy, you certainly know a trick or two. But just behave yourself and watch what I can do.&#8221; Our dear Great Sage shouted &#8220;Change,&#8221; and he too had three heads and six arms. He shook his gold-banded cudgel, and it turned into three cudgels, which he gripped with his six hands to ward off Nezha's blows. It was a great fight, and it made the earth shake and the mountains tremble:</P>


<P>Six-armed Prince Nezha</P>
<P>Heaven-born Monkey King:</P>
<P>Well-matched opponents,</P>
<P>Both in the same class.</P>
<P>One sent down to the lower world on a mission,</P>
<P>The other priding himself as a fighting bull.</P>
<P>Fast moves the point of the demon-beheading sword,</P>
<P>And evil spirits fear the demon-hacking cutlass,</P>
<P>The demon-binding rope flies like a dragon,</P>
<P>While the demon-quelling pestle has the head of a wolf,</P>
<P>The fire-wheel flashes with lightning,</P>
<P>And the embroidered ball shoots everywhere.</P>
<P>The Great Sage's three As-You-Will cudgels</P>
<P>Block and parry with consummate skill.</P>
<P>Though many hard-fought rounds prove inconclusive,</P>
<P>The prince refuses to call the battle off;</P>
<P>Making his six weapons multiply in number,</P>
<P>He throws them in their millions at the Monkey King's head,</P>
<P>But the Monkey King, fearless, roars with laughter</P>
<P>As his iron clubs whirl and think for themselves.</P>
<P>One becomes a thousand; one thousand, ten;</P>
<P>Their wild dance fills the sky as if with dragons.</P>
<P>All the demon kings shut their gates in terror;</P>
<P>Every goblin on the mountain finds some place to hide.</P>
<P>Cloud-black, the anger of the heavenly troops;</P>
<P>Whistling like the wind, the gold-banded cudgels.</P>
<P>On the one side,</P>
<P>The blood-curdling war-cries of the heavenly host.</P>
<P>On the other,</P>
<P>The spine-chilling banners of the monkey fiends.</P>
<P>Both parties are equal in fighting courage;</P>
<P>Neither could be said to be the winner.</P>


<P>Prince Nezha and Sun Wukong both used their divine powers to the full as they fought thirty rounds. When the six weapons of the prince turned into thousands and tens of thousands, so did Sun Wukong's gold-banded cudgel. The air was filled as if with drops of rain or shooting stars, and there was no way of telling who was winning. As Sun Wukong was deft of hand and quick of eye, he plucked one of the hairs from his body in the midst of the fray and shouted &#8220;Change!&#8221; It changed into his own double to mislead Nezha while his real self leapt round till he was behind Nezha and struck at his left shoulder. Nezha was in the middle of performing a spell when he heard the whistle of the cudgel through the air and twisted away as fast as he could. But he was unable to avoid the blow and had to flee wounded. He brought his magic to an end, put his six weapons away, reverted to his true appearance, and abandoned the field of battle in defeat.</P>
<P>This had all been observed by Heavenly King Li, who was on the point of sending reinforcements when his son appeared before him and reported in fear and trembling, &#8220;Father, the Protector of the Horses is very powerful. My magic was outclassed and he has wounded me in the shoulder.&#8221;</P>
<P>The color drained from the face of the horror-struck Heavenly King as he said, &#8220;If the creature has magic powers like that, how are we going to defeat him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Outside the gates of the cave,&#8221; the prince went on to report, &#8220;there is a banner on a pole that reads 'Great Sage Equaling Heaven'. He bragged that if the Jade Emperor gave him this title he would call everything off; otherwise he said he would attack the Hall of Miraculous Mist.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said the Heavenly King, &#8220;we'll disengage now, go back to Heaven, and request that more heavenly troops be sent to capture this wretch. There is plenty of time.&#8221; The prince, in pain and unable to go on fighting, went back to Heaven with the Heavenly King and put in this request, but of that no more for the moment.</P>
<P>Watch as the Monkey King returns to the mountain in triumph to receive the congratulations of the seventy-two kings of the monsters and his six sworn brothers. There was great drinking and singing in the cave paradise. Sun Wukong said to his six sworn brothers, &#8220;As I've called myself Great Sage Equaling Heaven, you can all call yourselves great sages too.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Honorable brother, you're right,&#8221; roared the Bull Demon King. &#8220;I shall call myself the Great Sage Matching Heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll be the Great Sage Overturning the Sea,&#8221; said the Salamander Demon King.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll be the Great Sage Throwing Heaven into Confusion,&#8221; said the Roc Demon King.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll be the Great Sage Who Moves Mountains,&#8221; said the Camel Demon King.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll be the Great Sage Who Travels with the Wind,&#8221; said the Macaque King.</P>
<P>&#8220;And I'll be the Great Sage Who Drives Away Gods,&#8221; said the Lion King. The seven great sages then did just as they pleased and gave themselves the titles they chose, and after enjoying themselves all day they went home.</P>
<P>Heavenly King Li and Prince Nezha led their forces straight to the Palace of Miraculous Mist and made this request: &#8220;We, your subjects, took our forces down to the lower world, under your Divine Edict, to subdue the immortal fiend Sun Wukong. But to our surprise we found that his magical powers were too far-reaching for us to be able to defeat him. We therefore hope that Your Imperial Majesty will send more troops to exterminate him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How could a mere monkey goblin have such great powers that you actually need more troops?&#8221; asked the Jade Emperor.</P>
<P>Prince Nezha then came forward and memorialized, &#8220;We beg Your Majesty to spare us the deaths we deserve. That monkey fiend has an iron cudgel that he used to defeat the Mighty Miracle God and wounded me on the shoulder. He has set a banner up outside the entrance to his cave that reads 'Great Sage Equaling Heaven,' and he says that if you give him this office he will stop fighting and submit; otherwise he will attack the Hall of Miraculous Mist.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the Jade Emperor heard this he asked in horror, &#8220;How dare that monkey fiend talk so wildly? Send all the generals to execute him at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>As he spoke the Great White Planet stepped forward from the ranks of officials. &#8220;That monkey fiend knows how to talk,&#8221; he suggested, &#8220;but he has no idea about real power. If more soldiers were sent to fight him, they might not be able to overcome him at once and their energies would be wasted. But if Your Imperial Majesty were to show your great mercy, you could send down a pacificatory amnesty and let him be a Great Sage Equaling Heaven. It would only be an empty title that he was given, just an honorary appointment.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean by an honorary appointment?&#8221; asked the Jade Emperor.</P>
<P>&#8220;He would be called a Great Sage Equaling Heaven, but he would not be given any responsibility or paid any salary. He would be kept between Heaven and Earth, where his evil nature would be under control and he would be kept from wickedness. Thus Heaven and Earth can be at peace, while sea and sky enjoy tranquillity.&#8221; The Jade Emperor approved this suggestion and ordered that a new edict should be issued for the Great White Planet to deliver.</P>
<P>The Great White Planet left once more through the Southern Gate of Heaven and went straight to have a look at the Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. It was quite different from before. There was an awe-inspiring and spine-chilling atmosphere, and every kind of fiend was present. They were roaring and leaping around with their swords, spears, cutlasses and staves. As soon as they saw the Great White Planet they all went for him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Will your commander please come forward,&#8221; said the Planet. &#8220;I would trouble you to inform your Great Sage that I am a heavenly envoy sent by the Jade Emperor, and I am carrying a divine edict with an invitation for him.&#8221;</P>
<P>The fiends rushed in to report, &#8220;There's an old man outside who says he's come from Heaven with an edict of invitation for you.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Sun Wukong heard this he said, &#8220;I'm glad he's come. I expect he's that Great White Planet who came before. Although I wasn't given a decent job last time I went to Heaven, I did get up there and learn my way around. If it's him again, his intentions must be good.&#8221; He told his commanders to put on a big display of banners and drums and to turn out a guard of honour to welcome him.</P>
<P>Then the Great Sage, wearing his helmet, his yellow robe over his armour, and his cloud-walking shoes, hurried out of the cave at the head of his monkey host, bowed in greeting, and shouted in a loud voice, &#8220;Please come in, venerable Planet. Forgive me for not being here to welcome you.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Planet walked straight into the cave, stood facing the South and said, &#8220;Great Sage, when you left the Imperial Stables because you found the post too humble, the officials of that department naturally reported the matter to the Jade Emperor. The Jade Emperor decreed that all officials have to work their way up from the bottom, and asked why you objected to its being humble. After this Heavenly King Li took Nezha down to the lower world to do battle with you. Your divine powers, Great Sage, were more than they expected, and they suffered defeat. On their return to Heaven they reported that you had set up a banner and wanted to be a 'Great Sage Equaling Heaven'. All the generals wanted to punish you; but I, Great Sage, ran the risk of punishment by suggesting that the armies should not be called out, and that Your Majesty should be given a post instead. The Jade Emperor approved my memorial, and that is why I have come here to invite you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am most grateful for this honour after the trouble I caused you earlier,&#8221; replied Sun Wukong, &#8220;but I am not sure whether there is such a title as 'Great Sage Equaling Heaven' in the upper world.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;After obtaining imperial approval for this title,&#8221; said the Planet, &#8220;I came down bearing a decree. If anything goes wrong, I'll bear the responsibility.&#8221;</P>
<P>A highly delighted Sun Wukong tried his hardest to persuade the Planet to stay to a banquet, but without success, so he went with him by propitious cloud to the Southern Gate of Heaven. The heavenly generals and soldiers all greeted them with respectfully folded arms, and they went straight to the Hall of Miraculous Mist. The Great White Planet did obeisance and said, &#8220;In obedience to the imperial edict your subject has summoned Sun Wukong, the Protector of the Horses, and he is present.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Let Sun Wukong come forward,&#8221; said the Jade Emperor. &#8220;We do now proclaim you Great Sage Equaling Heaven. Your rank is now very high. Let there be no more mischief from you.&#8221; The monkey simply chanted &#8220;na-a-aw&#8221; to express his thanks to the Emperor. The Jade Emperor then ordered the two officials in charge of public works, Zhang and Lu, to build a residence for the Great Sage Equaling Heaven to the left of the Peach Orchard. In the residence there were to be two offices: a Tranquillity Office and a Calm Divinity Office. Both these offices were to have immortal clerks and senior and junior assistants. He then told the Star Lords of the Constellation Five to escort Sun Wukong to his post, and in addition gave him two bottles of imperial wine and ten golden flowers, and admonished him to settle down and keep out of mischief. The Monkey King accepted the order and went that same day with the Star Lords of the Constellation Five to his residence, where he opened the bottles of wine and drained them dry with the help of all present. He then saw the star officials off and returned to his own palace. From then on he lived in happiness and content, and enjoyed untrammelled pleasure in the Palace. Truly,</P>


<P>His immortal name was for ever inscribed in the register of eternal life,</P>
<P>To be transmitted for ten thousand ages, free of the wheel of rebirth.</P>

<p>官封弼马心何足</p>
<p>名注齐天意未宁</p></div>
<p>那太白金星与美猴王，同出了洞天深处，一齐驾云而起。原来悟空筋斗云比众不同，十分快疾，把个金星撇在脑后，先至南天门外。正欲收云前进，被增长天王领着庞刘苟毕、邓辛张陶，一路大力天丁，枪刀剑戟，挡住天门，不肯放进。猴王道：“这个金星老儿乃奸诈之徒！既请老孙，如何教人动刀动枪，阻塞门路？”正嚷间，金星倏到，悟空就觌面发狠道：“你这老儿，怎么哄我？被你说奉玉帝招安旨意来请，却怎么教这些人阻住天门，不放老孙进去”？金星笑道：“大王息怒。你自来未曾到此天堂，却又无名，众天丁又与你素不相识，他怎肯放你擅入？等如今见了天尊，授了仙箓，注了官名，向后随你出入，谁复挡也？”悟空道：“这等说，也罢，我不进去了。”金星又用手扯住道：“你还同我进去。”将近天门，金星高叫道：“那天门天将、大小吏兵放开路者。此乃下界仙人，我奉玉帝圣旨，宣他来也。”那增长天王与众天丁俱才敛兵退避。猴王始信其言。同金星缓步入里观看。真个是——</p>

<p>初登上界，乍入天堂。金光万道滚红霓，瑞气千条喷紫雾。只见那南天门，碧沉沉琉璃造就，明幌幌宝玉妆成。两边摆数十员镇天元帅，一员员顶梁靠柱，持铣拥旄；四下列十数个金甲神人，一个个执戟悬鞭，持刀仗剑。外厢犹可，入内惊人：里壁厢有几根大柱，柱上缠绕着金鳞耀日赤须龙；又有几座长桥，桥上盘旋着彩羽凌空丹顶凤。明霞幌幌映天光，碧雾蒙蒙遮斗口。这天上有三十三座天宫，乃遣云宫、毗沙宫、五明宫、太阳宫、化乐宫……一宫宫脊吞金稳兽；又有七十二重宝殿，乃朝会殿、凌虚殿、宝光殿、天王殿、灵官殿……一殿殿柱列玉麒麟。寿星台上，有千千年不卸的名花；炼药炉边，有万万载常青的瑞草。又至那朝圣楼前，绛纱衣星辰灿烂，芙蓉冠金璧辉煌。玉簪珠履，紫绶金章。金钟撞动，三曹神表进丹墀；天鼓鸣时，万圣朝王参玉帝。又至那灵霄宝殿，金钉攒玉户，彩凤舞朱门。复道回廊，处处玲珑剔透；三檐四簇，层层龙凤翱翔。上面有个紫巍巍，明幌幌，圆丢丢，亮灼灼，大金葫芦顶；下面有天妃悬掌扇，玉女捧仙巾。恶狠狠掌朝的天将，气昂昂护驾的仙卿。正中间，琉璃盘内，放许多重重迭迭太乙丹；玛瑙瓶中，插几枝弯弯曲曲珊瑚树。正是天宫异物般般有，世上如他件件无。金阙银銮并紫府，琪花瑶草暨琼葩。朝王玉兔坛边过，参圣金乌着底飞。猴王有分来天境，不堕人间点污泥。</p>

<p>太白金星领着美猴王，到于灵霄殿外。不等宣诏，直至御前，朝上礼拜。悟空挺身在旁，且不朝礼，但侧耳以听金星启奏。金星奏道：“臣领圣旨，已宣妖仙到了。”玉帝垂帘问曰：“那个是妖仙？”悟空却才躬身答应道：“老孙便是。”仙卿们都大惊失色道：“这个野猴！怎么不拜伏参见，辄敢这等答应道‘老孙便是’却该死了，该死了！”玉帝传旨道：“那孙悟空乃下界妖仙，初得人身，不知朝礼，且姑恕罪。”众仙卿叫声：“谢恩！”猴王却才朝上唱个大喏。玉帝宣文选武选仙卿，看那处少甚官职，着孙悟空去除授。旁边转过武曲星君启奏道：“天宫里各宫各殿，各方各处，都不少官，只是御马监缺个正堂管事。”玉帝传旨道：“就除他做个弼马温罢。”众臣叫谢恩，他也只朝上唱个大喏。玉帝又差木德星官送他去御马监到任。</p>

<p>当时猴王欢欢喜喜，与木德星官径去到任。事毕，木德回宫。他在监里，会聚了监丞、监副、典簿、力士、大小官员人等，查明本监事务，止有天马千匹，乃是：</p>

<p>骅骝骐骥，辏駬纤离；龙媒紫燕，挟翼骕骦；駚騠银忑，祢珝飞黄；辚骒翻羽，赤兔超光；逾辉弥景，腾雾胜黄；追风绝地，飞皞奔霄；逸飘赤电，铜爵浮云；骢珑虎剌，绝尘紫鳞；四极大宛，八骏九逸，千里绝群。此等良马，一个个嘶风逐电精神壮，踏雾登云气力长。</p>

<p>这猴王查看了文簿，点明了马数。本监中典簿管征备草料；力士官管刷洗马匹、扎草、饮水、煮料；监丞、监副辅佐催办。弼马昼夜不睡，滋养马匹。日间舞弄犹可，夜间看管殷勤，但是马睡的，赶起来吃草，走的捉将来靠槽。那些天马见了他，泯耳攒蹄，都养得肉肥膘满。不觉的半月有余。</p>

<p>一朝闲暇，众监官都安排酒席，一则与他接风，一则与他贺喜。正在欢饮之间，猴王忽停杯问曰：“我这弼马温是个什么官衔？”众曰：“官名就是此了。”又问：“此官是个几品？”众道：“没有品从。”猴王道：“没品，想是大之极也。”众道：“不大不大，只唤做未入流。”猴王道：“怎么叫做‘未入流’？”众道：“末等。这样官儿，最低最小，只可与他看马。似堂尊到任之后，这等殷勤，喂得马肥，只落得道声‘好’字；如稍有些尫羸，还要见责；再十分伤损，还要罚赎问罪。”猴王闻此，不觉心头火起，咬牙大怒道：“这般藐视老孙！老孙在那花果山，称王称祖，怎么哄我来替他养马？养马者，乃后生小辈下贱之役，岂是待我的？不做他，不做他！我将去也！”忽喇的一声，把公案推倒，耳中取出宝贝，幌一幌，碗来粗细，一路解数，直打出御马监，径至南天门。众天丁知他受了仙箓，乃是个弼马温，不敢阻当，让他打出天门去了。</p>

<p>须臾，按落云头，回至花果山上，只见那四健将与各洞妖王，在那里操演兵卒，这猴王厉声高叫道“小的们，老孙来了！”一群猴都来叩头，迎接进洞天深处，请猴王高登宝位，一壁厢办酒接风，都道：“恭喜大王，上界去十数年，想必得意荣归也？”猴王道：“我才半月有余，那里有十数年？”众猴道：“大王，你在天上不觉时辰。天上一日，就是下界一年哩。请问大王，官居何职？”猴王摇手道：“不好说，不好说！活活的羞杀人！那玉帝不会用人，他见老孙这般模样，封我做个什么弼马温，原来是与他养马，未入流品之类。我初到任时不知，只在御马监中顽耍。及今日问我同寮，始知是这等卑贱。老孙心中大恼，推倒席面，不受官衔，因此走下来了。”众猴道：“来得好，来得好！大王在这福地洞天之处为王，多少尊重快乐，怎么肯去与他做马夫？”教：“小的们！快办酒来，与大王释闷。”</p>

<p>正饮酒欢会间，有人来报道：“大王，门外有两个独角鬼王，要见大王。”猴王道：“教他进来。”那鬼王整衣跑入洞中，倒身下拜。美猴王问他：“你见我何干？”鬼王道：“久闻大王招贤，无由得见，今见大王授了天箓，得意荣归，特献赭黄袍一件，与大王称庆。肯不弃鄙贱，收纳小人，亦得效犬马之劳。”猴王大喜，将赭黄袍穿起，众等欣然排班朝拜，即将鬼王封为前部总督先锋。鬼王谢恩毕，复启道：“大王在天许久，所授何职？”猴王道：“玉帝轻贤，封我做个什么弼马温！”鬼王听言，又奏道：“大王有此神通，如何与他养马？就做个齐天大圣，有何不可？”猴王闻说，欢喜不胜，连道几个“好，好，好！”教四健将：“就替我快置个旌旗，旗上写‘齐天大圣’四大字，立竿张挂。自此以后，只称我为齐天大圣，不许再称大王。亦可传与各洞妖王，一体知悉。”此不在话下。</p>

<p></p>

<p>却说那玉帝次日设朝，只见张天师引御马监监丞、监副在丹墀下拜奏道：“万岁，新任弼马温孙悟空，因嫌官小，昨日反下天宫去了。”正说间，又见南天门外增长天王领众天丁，亦奏道：“弼马温不知何故，走出天门去了。”玉帝闻言，即传旨：“着两路神元，各归本职，朕遣天兵，擒拿此怪。”班部中闪上托塔李天王与哪吒三太子，越班奏上道：“万岁，微臣不才，请旨降此妖怪。”玉帝大喜，即封托塔天王李靖为降魔大元帅，哪吒三太子为三坛海会大神，即刻兴师下界。李天王与哪吒叩头谢辞，径至本宫，点起三军，帅众头目，着巨灵神为先锋，鱼肚将掠后，药叉将催兵。一霎时出南天门外，径来到花果山。选平阳处安了营寨，传令教巨灵神挑战。巨灵神得令，结束整齐，轮着宣花斧，到了水帘洞外。只见那洞门外，许多妖魔，都是些狼虫虎豹之类，丫丫叉叉，轮枪舞剑，在那里跳斗咆哮。这巨灵神喝道：“那业畜！快早去报与弼马温知道，吾乃上天大将，奉玉帝旨意，到此收伏。教他早早出来受降，免致汝等皆伤残也。”那些怪奔奔波波，传报洞中道：“祸事了，祸事了！”猴王问：“有甚祸事？”众妖道：“门外有一员天将，口称大圣官衔，道：奉玉帝圣旨，来此收伏。教早早出去受降，免伤我等性命。”猴王听说，教：“取我披挂来！”就戴上紫金冠，贯上黄金甲，登上步云鞋，手执如意金箍棒，领众出门，摆开阵势。这巨灵神睁睛观看，真好猴王——</p>

<p>身穿金甲亮堂堂，头戴金冠光映映。手举金箍棒一根，足踏云鞋皆相称。</p>

<p>一双怪眼似明星，两耳过肩眉又硬。挺挺身才变化多，声音响亮如钟磬。</p>

<p>尖嘴咨牙弼马温，心高要做齐天圣。</p>

<p>巨灵神厉声高叫道：“那泼猴！你认得我么？”大圣听言，急问道：“你是那路毛神？老孙不曾会你，你快报名来。”巨灵神道：“我把你那欺心的猢狲！你是认不得我！我乃高上神霄托塔李天王部下先锋，巨灵天将！今奉玉帝圣旨，到此收降你。你快卸了装束，归顺天恩，免得这满山诸畜遭诛。若道半个不字，教你顷刻化为鳷粉！”猴王听说，心中大怒道：“泼毛神，休夸大口，少弄长舌！我本待一棒打死你，恐无人去报信，且留你性命，快早回天，对玉皇说：他甚不用贤！老孙有无穷的本事，为何教我替他养马？你看我这旌旗上字号，若依此字号升官，我就不动刀兵，自然的天地清泰；如若不依，时间就打上灵霄宝殿，教他龙床定坐不成！”这巨灵神闻此言，急睁睛迎风观看，果见门外竖一高竿，竿上有旌旗一面，上写着“齐天大圣”四大字。巨灵神冷笑三声道：“这泼猴，这等不知人事，辄敢无状，你就要做齐天大圣！好好的吃吾一斧！”劈头就砍将去。那猴王正是会家不忙，将金箍棒应手相迎。这一场好杀——</p>

<p>棒名如意，斧号宣花。他两个乍相逢，不知深浅。斧和棒，左右交加。一个暗藏神妙，一个大口称夸。使动法喷云嗳雾；展开手播土扬沙。天将神通就有道，猴王变化实无涯。棒举却如龙戏水，斧来犹似凤穿花。巨灵名望传天下，原来本事不如他。大圣轻轻轮铁棒，着头一下满身麻。</p>

<p>巨灵神抵敌他不住，被猴王劈头一棒，慌忙将斧架隔，傣带的一声，把个斧柄打做两截，急撤身败阵逃生。猴王笑道：“脓包，脓包！我已饶了你，你快去报信，快去报信！”巨灵神回至营门，径见托塔天王，忙哈哈跪下道：“弼马温果是神通广大！末将战他不过，败阵回来请罪。”李天王发怒道：“这厮锉吾锐气，推出斩之！”旁边闪出哪吒太子，拜告：“父王息怒，且恕巨灵之罪，待孩儿出师一遭，便知深浅。”天王听谏，且教回营待罪管事。</p>

<p>这哪吒太子，甲胄齐整，跳出营盘，撞至水帘洞外。那悟空正来收兵，见哪吒来的勇猛。好太子——</p>

<p>总角才遮囟，披毛未苫肩。神奇多敏悟，骨秀更清妍。</p>

<p>诚为天上麒麟子，果是烟霞彩凤仙。龙种自然非俗相，妙龄端不类尘凡。</p>

<p>身带六般神器械，飞腾变化广无边。今受玉皇金口诏，敕封海会号三坛。</p>

<p>悟空迎近前来问曰：“你是谁家小哥？闯近吾门，有何事干？”哪吒喝道：“泼妖猴！岂不认得我？我乃托塔天王三太子哪吒是也。今奉玉帝钦差，至此捉你。”悟空笑道：“小太子，你的奶牙尚未退，胎毛尚未干，怎敢说这般大话？我且留你的性命，不打你。你只看我旌旗上是什么字号，拜上玉帝，是这般官衔，再也不须动众，我自皈依；若是不遂我心，定要打上灵霄宝殿。”哪吒抬头看处，乃“齐天大圣”四字。哪吒道：“这妖猴能有多大神通，就敢称此名号！不要怕，吃吾一剑！”悟空道：“我只站下不动，任你砍几剑罢。”那哪吒奋怒，大喝一声，叫：“变！”即变做三头六臂，恶狠狠手持着六般兵器，乃是斩妖剑、砍妖刀、缚妖索、降妖杵、绣球儿、火轮儿，丫丫叉叉，扑面来打。悟空见了心惊道：“这小哥倒也会弄些手段！莫无礼，看我神通！”好大圣，喝声：“变！”也变做三头六臂，把金箍棒幌一幌，也变作三条，六只手拿着三条棒架住。这场斗，真个是地动山摇，好杀也——</p>

<p>六臂哪吒太子，天生美石猴王，相逢真对手，正遇本源流。那一个蒙差来下界，这一个欺心闹斗牛。斩妖宝剑锋芒快，砍妖刀狠鬼神愁；缚妖索子如飞蟒，降妖大杵似狼头；火轮掣电烘烘艳，往往来来滚绣球。大圣三条如意棒，前遮后挡运机谋。苦争数合无高下，太子心中不肯休。把那六件兵器多教变，百千万亿照头丢。猴王不惧呵呵笑，铁棒翻腾自运筹。以一化千千化万，满空乱舞赛飞虬。唬得各洞妖王都闭户，遍山鬼怪尽藏头。神兵怒气云惨惨，金箍铁棒响飕飕。那壁厢，天丁呐喊人人怕；这壁厢，猴怪摇旗个个忧。发狠两家齐斗勇，不知那个刚强那个柔。</p>

<p>三太子与悟空各骋神威，斗了个三十回合。那太子六般兵，变做千千万万；孙悟空金箍棒，变作万万千千。半空中似雨点流星，不分胜负。原来悟空手疾眼快，正在那混乱之时，他拔下一根毫毛，叫声：“变！”就变做他的本相，手挺着棒，演着哪吒。他的真身却一纵，赶至哪吒脑后，着左膊上一棒打来。哪吒正使法间，听得棒头风响，急躲闪时，不能措手，被他着了一下，负痛逃走，收了法，把六件兵器，依旧归身，败阵而回。</p>

<p>那阵上李天王早已看见，急欲提兵助战，不觉太子倏至面前，战兢兢报道：“父王，弼马温真个有本事！孩儿这般法力，也战他不过，已被他打伤膊也。”天王大惊失色道：“这厮恁的神通，如何取胜？”太子道：“他洞门外竖一竿旗，上写‘齐天大圣’四字，亲口夸称，教玉帝就封他做齐天大圣，万事俱休；若还不是此号，定要打上灵霄宝殿哩！”天王道：“既然如此，且不要与他相持，且去上界，将此言回奏，再多遣天兵，围捉这厮，未为迟也。”太子负痛，不能复战，故同天王回天启奏不题。</p>

<p>你看那猴王得胜归山，那七十二洞妖王与那六弟兄，俱来贺喜。在洞天福地，饮乐无比。他却对六弟兄说：“小弟既称齐天大圣，你们亦可以大圣称之。”内有牛魔王忽然高叫道：“贤弟言之有理，我即称做个平天大圣。”蛟魔王道：“我称做复海大圣。”鹏魔王道：“我称混天大圣。”狮犭它王道：“我称移山大圣。”猕猴王道：“我称通风大圣。”犭禺狨王道：“我称驱神大圣。”此时七大圣自作自为，自称自号，耍乐一日，各散讫。</p>

<p></p>

<p>却说那李天王与三太子领着众将，直至灵霄宝殿，启奏道：“臣等奉旨出师下界，收伏妖仙孙悟空，不期他神通广大，不能取胜，仍望万岁添兵剿除。”玉帝道：“谅一妖猴有多少本事，还要添兵？”太子又近前奏道：“望万岁赦臣死罪！那妖猴使一条铁棒，先败了巨灵神，又打伤臣臂膊。洞门外立一竿旗，上书‘齐天大圣’四字，道是封他这官职，即便休兵来投；若不是此官，还要打上灵霄宝殿也。”玉帝闻言，惊讶道：“这妖猴何敢这般狂妄！着众将即刻诛之。”正说间，班部中又闪出太白金星，奏道：“那妖猴只知出言，不知大小。欲加兵与他争斗，想一时不能收伏，反又劳师。不若万岁大舍恩慈，还降招安旨意，就教他做个齐天大圣。只是加他个空衔，有官无禄便了。”玉帝道：“怎么唤做‘有官无禄’？”金星道：“名是齐天大圣，只不与他事管，不与他俸禄，且养在天壤之间，收他的邪心，使不生狂妄，庶乾坤安靖，海宇得清宁也。”玉帝闻言道：“依卿所奏。”即命降了诏书，仍着金星领去。</p>

<p>金星复出南天门，直至花果山水帘洞外观看。这番比前不同，威风凛凛，杀气森森，各样妖精，无般不有。一个个都执剑拈枪，拿刀弄杖的，在那里咆哮跳跃。一见金星，皆上前动手。金星道：“那众头目来！累你去报你大圣知之。吾乃上帝遣来天使，有圣旨在此请他。”众妖即跑入报道：“外面有一老者，他说是上界天使，有旨意请你。”悟空道：“来得好，来得好！想是前番来的那太白金星。那次请我上界，虽是官爵不堪，却也天上走了一次，认得那天门内外之路。今番又来，定有好意。”教众头目大开旗鼓，摆队迎接。大圣即带引群猴，顶冠贯甲，甲上罩了赭黄袍，足踏云履，急出洞门，躬身施礼。高叫道：“老星请进，恕我失迎之罪。”金星趋步向前，径入洞内，面南立着道：“今告大圣，前者因大圣嫌恶官小，躲离御马监，当有本监中大小官员奏了玉帝。玉帝传旨道：‘凡授官职，皆由卑而尊，为何嫌小？’即有李天王领哪吒下界取战。不知大圣神通，故遭败北，回天奏道：‘大圣立一竿旗，要做齐天大圣。众武将还要支吾，是老汉力为大圣冒罪奏闻，免兴师旅，请大王授箓。玉帝准奏，因此来请。”悟空笑道：“前番动劳，今又蒙爱，多谢，多谢！但不知上天可有此齐天大圣之官衔也？”金星道：“老汉以此衔奏准，方敢领旨而来。如有不遂，只坐罪老汉便是。”</p>

<p>悟空大喜，恳留饮宴不肯，遂与金星纵着祥云，到南天门外。那些天丁天将，都拱手相迎，径入灵霄殿下。金星拜奏道：“臣奉诏宣弼马温孙悟空已到。”玉帝道：“那孙悟空过来，今宣你做个齐天大圣，官品极矣，但切不可胡为。”这猴亦止朝上唱个喏，道声谢恩。玉帝即命工干官张、鲁二班，在蟠桃园右首起一座齐天大圣府，府内设个二司：一名安静司，一名宁神司。司俱有仙吏，左右扶持。又差五斗星君送悟空去到任，外赐御酒二瓶，金花十朵，着他安心定志，再勿胡为。那猴王信受奉行，即日与五斗星君到府，打开酒瓶，同众尽饮。送星官回转本宫，他才遂心满意，喜地欢天，在于天宫快乐，无挂无碍。正是：仙名永注长生箓，不堕轮回万古传。毕竟不知向后如何，且听下回分解。	</div>
