<P>Chen Guangrui Comes to Grief on His Way to His Post</P>
<P>The Monk of the River Current Avenges His Parents</P>
</div>
<P>The story goes on to tell that Chang'an city in the great land of Shaanxi had been a place where emperors and kings had made their capitals for generation after generation. Ever since the Zhou, Qin and Han dynasties, the Three Prefectures had been as rich as brocade, and the eight rivers had flowed round its walls. It was indeed a famous country. At that time Emperor Taizong of the Great Tang was on the throne. He had changed the name of the reign-period to<I> Zhenguan,</I> and had been reigning for thirteen years. The year was<I> ji si</I> and the world was at peace; tribute was being sent in from the eight directions, and all within the four seas acknowledged themselves as subjects.</P>
<P>One day Taizong took his seat on the throne and assembled all his military and civilian officials. When they had finished making their greetings, the minister Wei Zheng came forward from the ranks of officials and memorialized, &#8220;As the world is now at peace and the eight directions are calm, an examination should be held in accordance with the practice of the ancients. Thus we could recruit wise scholars and select men of talent to help with our civilizing mission.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The suggestion of our wise minister is right,&#8221; said the Emperor, and notices inviting worthy men to compete in the examinations were posted throughout the empire. All the Confucian scholars on the civil or military rolls in every prefecture, district and county who had distinguished themselves in the three-stage examinations for their understanding of literature were to go to Chang'an for a final test.</p>

<P>陈光蕊赴任逢灾</P>
<P>江流僧复仇报本</P>
</div>
<p>话表陕西大国长安城，乃历代帝王建都之地。自周、秦、汉以来，三州花似锦，八水绕城流，真个是名胜之邦。彼时是大唐太宗皇帝登基，改元贞观，已登极十三年，岁在己巳，天下太平，八方进贡，四海称臣。忽一日，太宗登位，聚集文武众官，朝拜礼毕，有魏征丞相出班奏道：“方今天下太平，八方宁静，应依古法，开立选场，招取贤士，擢用人材，以资化理。”太宗道：“贤卿所奏有理。”就传招贤文榜，颁布天下：各府州县，不拘军民人等，但有读书儒流，文义明畅，三场精通者，前赴长安应试。</p>

<P>When this notice reached the district of Haizhou it was seen by a man called Chen E, whose courtesy name was Guangrui. He returned home and said to Madame Zhang, his mother, &#8220;The court has issued a yellow notice saying that the Chancellery will be opened for an examination to select men of wisdom and talent. Your child wants to go and take part. If I am given an official post it will bring me fame and make our family illustrious; my wife will be given a title, my sons will be given preferential treatment; and it will bring glory to our house. Such is my ambition; and I have come to tell you, mother, that I am going.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You are a scholar, my son,&#8221; his mother replied, &#8220;and it is right that 'one who studies when young should travel when grown up'. But do take care on the journey to the examinations, and if you are given office, come back home as soon as you can.&#8221; Chen Guangrui then ordered his servants to get his luggage together, took his leave of his mother, and started off on his journey. When he reached Chang'an the examination grounds were open and he went in. Having been successful in this examination, he went to the palace for the three questions test. The Tang Emperor personally awarded him the first place, and he was paraded round the streets on horseback for three days.</P>
<P>It happened that just when the procession was passing the gateway of the minister Yin Kaishan, the minister's unmarried daughter Wenqiao, whose other name was Man-tang-qiao (Beauty Throughout the Hall), was making decorations for the house and throwing an embroidered ball to see who her future husband would be. When Chen Guangrui passed below she saw at once that he was exceptionally handsome, and she knew that he had come first in the recent examinations. She was thoroughly taken with him, and when she dropped her embroidered ball it landed squarely on his black hat. To the sound of pipes and flutes a dozen or so maidservants and serving women hurried downstairs to take hold of the head of Chen Guangrui's horse and invite him into the minister's mansion to marry his daughter. The minister and his wife came into the main hall, and when they had called for a master of ceremonies they married their daughter to Guangrui. When bride and groom had bowed to Heaven, Earth and each other they both bowed to the bride's father and mother. The minister ordered a banquet, and there was a night of drinking and celebration. The bride and groom went hand in hand into the bridal chamber.</P>
<P>At the third quarter of the fifth watch the next morning Emperor Taizong took his throne in the Golden Chariot Hall, and the civil and military officials came to court.</P>
<P>&#8220;What office should Chen Guangrui who came top in the examinations be given?&#8221; the Emperor asked, and the minister Wei Zheng replied, &#8220;Your subject has gone through the list of the prefectures and commanderies, and found that the district of Jiangzhou needs a prefect. I beg Your Majesty to give him this office.&#8221; The Emperor therefore appointed him prefect of Jiangzhou and ordered him to pack his belongings and set off as he had to be there by a set date. Chen Guangrui thanked the Emperor for his grace and withdrew. He went back to the minister's mansion and consulted his wife, then he took his leave of his parents-in-law and set off together with her for his post in Jiangzhou.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>此榜行至海州地方，有一人，姓陈名萼，表字光蕊，见了此榜，即时回家，对母张氏道：“朝廷颁下黄榜，诏开南省，考取贤才，孩儿意欲前去应试。倘得一官半职，显亲扬名，封妻荫子，光耀门闾，乃儿之志也。特此禀告母亲前去。”张氏道：“我儿读书人，幼而学，壮而行，正该如此。但去赴举，路上须要小心，得了官，早早回来。”光蕊便吩咐家僮收拾行李，即拜辞母亲，趱程前进。到了长安，正值大开选场，光蕊就进场。考毕，中选。及廷试三策，唐王御笔亲赐状元，跨马游街三日。不期游到丞相殷开山门首，有丞相所生一女，名唤温娇，又名满堂娇，未曾婚配，正高结彩楼，抛打绣球卜婿。适值陈光蕊在楼下经过，小姐一见光蕊人材出众，知是新科状元，心内十分欢喜，就将绣球抛下，恰打着光蕊的乌纱帽。猛听得一派笙箫细乐，十数个婢妾走下楼来，把光蕊马头挽住，迎状元入相府成婚。那丞相和夫人，即时出堂，唤宾人赞礼，将小姐配与光蕊。拜了天地，夫妻交拜毕，又拜了岳丈、岳母。丞相吩咐安排酒席，欢饮一宵。二人同携素手，共入兰房。次日五更三点，太宗驾坐金銮宝殿，文武众臣趋朝。太宗问道：“新科状元陈光蕊应授何官？”魏征丞相奏道：“臣查所属州郡，有江州缺官。乞我主授他此职。”太宗就命为江州州主，即令收拾起身，勿误限期。光蕊谢恩出朝，回到相府，与妻商议，拜辞岳丈、岳母，同妻前赴江州之任。离了长安登途。</p>

<P>It was late spring as they left Chang'an at the start of their journey. Warm breezes were coaxing the willows into green, and light rain was touching the blossoms with red. Chen Guangrui was able to call at his own home on the way, so he and his bride could pay their respects to his mother, Madame Zhang.</P>
<P>&#8220;Congratulations, my son,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And you have brought a bride back with you too.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Thanks to my mother's blessings, your son was placed first in the examinations,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;and given a parade through the streets on His Majesty's orders. As I was passing the gateway of minister Yin's residence, I happened to be hit by an embroidered ball, and the minister was kind enough to give me his daughter's hand. The court has appointed me prefect of Jiangzhou, so I have come to fetch you, mother, and take you with me to my post.&#8221; Madame Zhang was overjoyed, and she packed her luggage and traveled with them.</P>
<P>One night, after they had been on the road for several days, they put up at the Liu the Second's Ten Thousand Flowers Inn, where Madame Zhang was suddenly taken ill.</P>
<P>&#8220;As I'm not feeling well,&#8221; she said to her son, &#8220;I'd better stay in this inn for a couple of days to get over it before going on.&#8221; Chen Guangrui accepted her suggestion. The next morning he saw a man selling a golden-coloured carp in front of the inn and brought it from him for a string of copper coins, intending to have it lightly fried for his mother. Then he noticed it blinking.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's said that if a fish or a snake blinks it is no ordinary creature,&#8221; he thought. He asked the fisherman where he had caught it.</P>
<P>&#8220;In the Hongjiang River, five miles from the prefectural capital,&#8221; the fisherman replied. Chen Guangrui had the fish taken back to the Hongjiang River to be released there, then went back to the inn to tell his mother about what had happened.</P>
<P>&#8220;It is good to release living things,&#8221; his mother said, &#8220;and I am very pleased.&#8221; Then Chen Guangrui said, &#8220;We have been at this inn for three days, and the time limit set for me is a tight one, so I must be on my way tomorrow morning. Are you well enough yet, mother?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm still poorly,&#8221; his mother replied, &#8220;and it's so hot to travel now that I'm afraid it might make me seriously ill. You had better take a couple of rooms for me and leave me some money; I'll stay here for the time being. You two can go on ahead to your post. Come back to fetch me in the autumn when it's cooler.&#8221; Having discussed it with his wife he rented a wing for her and gave her some money, then they took their leave of her and set off.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>正是暮春天气，和风吹柳绿，细雨点花红。光蕊便道回家，同妻交拜母亲张氏。张氏道：“恭喜我儿，且又娶亲回来。”光蕊道：“孩儿叨赖母亲福庇，忝中状元，钦赐游街，经过丞相殷府门前，遇抛打绣球适中，蒙丞相即将小姐招孩儿为婿。朝廷除孩儿为江州州主，今来接取母亲，同去赴任。”张氏大喜，收拾行程。在路数日，前至万花店刘小二家安下，张氏身体忽然染病，与光蕊道：“我身上不安，且在店中调养两日再去。”光蕊遵命。至次日早晨，见店门前有一人提着个金色鲤鱼叫卖，光蕊即将一贯钱买了，欲待烹与母亲吃，只见鲤鱼闪闪斩眼，光蕊惊异道：“闻说鱼蛇斩眼，必不是等闲之物！”遂问渔人道：“这鱼那里打来的？”渔人道：“离府十五里洪江内打来的。”光蕊就把鱼送在洪江里去放了生。回店对母亲道知此事，张氏道：“放生好事，我心甚喜。”光蕊道：“此店已住三日了，钦限紧急，孩儿意欲明日起身，不知母亲身体好否？”张氏道：“我身子不快，此时路上炎热，恐添疾病。你可这里赁间房屋，与我暂住。付些盘缠在此，你两口儿先上任去，候秋凉却来接我。”光蕊与妻商议，就租了屋宇，付了盘缠与母亲，同妻拜辞前去。</p>

<P>It was a hard journey, setting off every day at dawn and not stopping till nightfall, and before they realized it they reached the ford over the Hongjiang Estuary. They saw two boatmen, Liu Hong and Li Biao, punt their ferry to the bank for them. This was the disaster, these were the enemies, that Chen Guangrui had been fated to meet ever since before he was born. He told his servant to put the luggage on board, while he and his wife climbed sedately into the boat. Liu Hong stared at Miss Yin, and saw that her face was like a full moon, her eyes like autumn waves, her tiny mouth like a cherry, and her waist as supple as a willow; her charms would have made fishes sink and wild geese fall from the sky, and her beauty put moon and flowers to shame. Evil thoughts surged up in him, and he conspired with Li Biao to punt the boat to a misty and deserted place and wait till the middle of the night, when they killed first the servant and then Chen Guangrui. They pushed both the corpses into the river and went away.</P>
<P>When the young lady saw her husband killed she tried to fling herself into the water, but Liu Hong put his arms round her and said, &#8220;If you come with me, you'll be all right; but if you don't, I'll cut you in half.&#8221; Unable to think of any other way out, the young lady had to agree to stay with Liu Hong for the time being at least. The murderer took the boat across to the Southern bank and gave it to Li Biao. Then he dressed up in Chen Guangrui's clothes and, armed with the dead man's credentials, went with the young lady to take up his post in Jiangzhou.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>途路艰苦，晓行夜宿，不觉已到洪江渡口。只见稍水刘洪、李彪二人，撑船到岸迎接。也是光蕊前生合当有此灾难，撞着这冤家。光蕊令家僮将行李搬上船去，夫妻正齐齐上船，那刘洪睁眼看见殷小姐面如满月，眼似秋波，樱桃小口，绿柳蛮腰，真个有沉鱼落雁之容，闭月羞花之貌，陡起狼心，遂与李彪设计，将船撑至没人烟处，候至夜静三更，先将家僮杀死，次将光蕊打死，把尸首都推在水里去了。小姐见他打死了丈夫，也便将身赴水，刘洪一把抱住道：“你若从我，万事皆休；若不从时，一刀两断！”那小姐寻思无计，只得权时应承，顺了刘洪。那贼把船渡到南岸，将船付与李彪自管，他就穿了光蕊衣冠，带了官凭，同小姐往江州上任去了。</p>

<P>The corpse of the murdered servant floated with the current, but Chen Guangrui's body sank straight to the bottom and did not move. A patrolling yaksha demon stationed at the Hongjiang Estuary saw him and rushed straight back to the dragon palace to report. He arrived just as the dragon king was entering the throne-hall.</P>
<P>&#8220;Someone has murdered a learned gentleman at the Hongjiang Estuary, and thrown the body into the bed of the river,&#8221; he reported. The dragon king had the body brought in and laid in front of him. After examining it carefully he said, &#8220;This is the benefactor who saved my life: why has he been murdered? As the saying goes, 'Always repay a kindness'. I must save his life today to repay him for the favour he did me in the past.&#8221; He wrote a memorandum and sent a yaksha with it to the city god and local god of Hongzhou asking for the scholar's soul so that he could save his life. The city god and the local god told a junior devil to give Chen Guangrui's soul to the yaksha, who took it back to the palace of crystal and reported to the dragon king.</P>
<P>&#8220;What is your name, scholar?&#8221; asked the dragon king. &#8220;Where are you from? What brought you here, and why were you killed?&#8221;</P>



<P>Chen Guangrui bowed to him and replied, &#8220;My name is Chen E and my courtesy name is Guangrui. I come from Hongnong County in Haizhou Prefecture. I was given first place in the recent examinations, and was on my way with my wife to take up my post as prefect of Jiangzhou when we boarded a ferry at the bank of this river. The boatman Liu Hong lusted after my wife, so he killed me and threw me overboard. I beg you to save me, Your Majesty.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So that's how things stand,&#8221; said the dragon king. &#8220;I am the golden carp you released. You saved me then, so I must help you now that you are in trouble.&#8221; He had Guangrui's body placed beside a wall and put a &#8220;Face Preserving Pearl&#8221; in its mouth to stop it from decomposing so that the soul could be returned to it in future for him to obtain his revenge. &#8220;As you are now a true soul, you shall stay in my palace for the time being as a commander,&#8221; the dragon king added. Chen Guangrui kowtowed in thanks, and the dragon king gave a banquet to welcome him.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>却说刘洪杀死的家僮尸首，顺水流去，惟有陈光蕊的尸首，沉在水底不动。有洪江口巡海夜叉见了，星飞报入龙宫，正值龙王升殿，夜叉报道：“今洪江口不知甚人把一个读书士子打死，将尸撇在水底。”龙王叫将尸抬来，放在面前，仔细一看道：“此人正是救我的恩人，如何被人谋死？常言道，恩将恩报。我今日须索救他性命，以报日前之恩。”即写下牒文一道，差夜叉径往洪州城隍土地处投下，要取秀才魂魄来，救他的性命。城隍土地遂唤小鬼把陈光蕊的魂魄交付与夜叉去。夜叉带了魂魄到水晶宫，禀见了龙王。龙王问道：“你这秀才，姓甚名谁？何方人氏？因甚到此，被人打死？”光蕊施礼道：“小生陈萼，表字光蕊，系海州弘农县人。忝中新科状元，叨授江州州主，同妻赴任，行至江边上船，不料稍子刘洪，贪谋我妻，将我打死抛尸，乞大王救我一救！”龙王闻言道：“原来如此，先生，你前者所放金色鲤鱼即我也，你是救我的恩人，你今有难，我岂有不救你之理？”就把光蕊尸身安置一壁，口内含一颗定颜珠，休教损坏了，日后好还魂报仇。又道：“汝今真魂，权且在我水府中做个都领。”光蕊叩头拜谢，龙王设宴相待不题。</p>

<P>Miss Yin's hatred for the villainous Liu Hong was such that she wished she could eat his flesh and spread his flayed hide on her bed, but as she was pregnant and the child had not yet been born she had to force herself to go with him. In the twinkling of an eye they reached Jiangzhou. The clerks and constables all turned out to welcome him, and the subordinate officials in the prefecture gave a banquet for him in the main hall of his office.</P>
<P>&#8220;Now that I, your student, have come here, I shall be entirely dependent on the support of all you gentlemen,&#8221; said Liu Hong.</P>

<P>&#8220;Your honour is a great genius,&#8221; the officials replied, &#8220;and you will naturally treat the people as your own children, thus cutting down litigation and making punishment unnecessary. We will all be able to rely on you&#8212;your excessive modesty is uncalled for.&#8221; When the banquet was over they all went away.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>却说殷小姐痛恨刘贼，恨不食肉寝皮，只因身怀有孕，未知男女，万不得已，权且勉强相从。转盼之间，不觉已到江州。吏书门皂，俱来迎接。所属官员，公堂设宴相叙。刘洪道：“学生到此，全赖诸公大力匡持。”属官答道：“堂尊大魁高才，自然视民如子，讼简刑清。我等合属有赖，何必过谦？”公宴已罢，众人各散。</p>

<P>Time flew by. One day, when Liu Hong was far away on official business, the young lady was in a summerhouse in the official residence sighing sadly as she thought of her mother-in-law and her husband. Suddenly she felt weak and her belly started to ache. She fell to the ground unconscious, and before she knew it she gave birth to a son. She heard a voice in her ear saying, &#8220;Man-tang-qiao, you must do as I tell you. I am the Lord of the Southern Pole Star, and I have come to give you this son on the orders of the Bodhisattva Guanyin. One day he will be extraordinarily famous. When the villainous Liu comes back he will certainly want to kill this boy, so you must look after him with great care. Your husband has been rescued by the dragon king; one day you will be reunited with him and your son, and your sufferings will be at an end. Remember my words. Wake up, wake up!&#8221;</P>
<P>When the young lady came to she remembered every word he had spoken, but as she wrapped the baby tight in swaddling clothes, she could not think what to do. When Liu Hong came back he wanted to drown the child the moment he saw him, but the young lady said, &#8220;It's already dark: we can throw him in the river tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>光阴迅速。一日，刘洪公事远出，小姐在衙思念婆婆、丈夫，在花亭上感叹，忽然身体困倦，腹内疼痛，晕闷在地，不觉生下一子。耳边有人嘱曰：“满堂娇，听吾叮嘱。吾乃南极星君，奉观音菩萨法旨，特送此子与你。异日声名远大，非比等闲。刘贼若回，必害此子，汝可用心保护。汝夫已得龙王相救，日后夫妻相会，子母团圆，雪冤报仇有日也。谨记吾言。快醒，快醒！”言讫而去。小姐醒来，句句记得，将子抱定，无计可施。忽然刘洪回来，一见此子，便要淹杀，小姐道：“今日天色已晚，容待明日抛去江中。”</p>
</div>

</div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<P>Fortunately Liu Hong had to go a long way away on urgent business the next day.</P>
<P>&#8220;If I wait till that villain returns my son will be killed,&#8221; thought the young lady, &#8220;so the best thing would be to abandon him in the river as soon as possible and let fate determine whether he is to live or do die. If Heaven is merciful someone will rescue the boy and bring him up, and we shall be reunited one day.&#8221; Then, worrying that she might not be able to recognize him, she bit open her finger and wrote a letter in blood giving a full account of his parentage and background. Then she bit off the little toe of the child's left foot to be an identifying mark, wrapped him up in one of her own shifts, and carried him out of the official residence when nobody was looking. Luckily the residence was not far from the river bank. When she reached it she wept for a while and was just going to throw him in when she noticed a board floating beside the bank. The young lady bowed to Heaven in her gratitude and tied the child to the board with her sash, placing the blood letter next to his chest. Then she pushed him out into the stream to go where he would and returned to the yamen in tears.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>幸喜次早刘洪忽有紧急公事远出。小姐暗思：“此子若待贼人回来，性命休矣！不如及早抛弃江中，听其生死。倘或皇天见怜，有人救得，收养此子，他日还得相逢……”但恐难以识认，即咬破手指，写下血书一纸，将父母姓名、跟脚原由，备细开载。又将此子左脚上一个小指，用口咬下，以为记验；取贴身汗衫一件，包裹此子，乘空抱出衙门。幸喜官衙离江不远。小姐到了江边，大哭一场。正欲抛弃，忽见江岸岸侧飘起一片木板，小姐即朝天拜祷，将此子安在板上，用带缚住，血书系在胸前，推放江中，听其所之。小姐含泪回衙不题。</p>

<P>The boy floated downstream on the plank until he came to a stop under the Jinshan Temple. The abbot of this temple was a monk called Faming who by cultivating the Truth and being awakened to the Way had found the secret of avoiding rebirth. As he was sitting at his meditation he heard a baby crying, and he hurried anxiously down to the riverside to look. He saw a baby lying on a board beside the bank, and got him out of the water as quickly as he could. When he read the letter written in blood that was on the baby's chest he knew why he was there. He gave the child the milk-name Jiangliu, &#8220;River Current,&#8221; and arranged for him to be fostered. The letter in blood he put away in a very safe place. Time passed like an arrow, and the days and months moved as fast as a shuttle. When Jiangliu reached the age of seventeen the abbot told him to have his head tonsured and enter the religious life. Giving him the Buddhist name Xuanzang he laid his hands upon his head and instructed him to observe the monastic discipline. Xuanzang was determined to cultivate the Way.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">


<p>却说此子在木板上，顺水流去，一直流到金山寺脚下停住。那金山寺长老叫做法明和尚，修真悟道，已得无生妙诀。正当打坐参禅，忽闻得小儿啼哭之声，一时心动，急到江边观看，只见涯边一片木板上，睡着一个婴儿，长老慌忙救起。见了怀中血书，方知来历。取个乳名，叫做江流，托人抚养。血书紧紧收藏。光阴似箭，日月如梭，不觉江流年长一十八岁。长老就叫他削发修行，取法名为玄奘，摩顶受戒，坚心修道。</p>

<P>One day in late spring the whole community gathered under the shade of some pine trees to expound the scriptures, meditate and discuss the inner mysteries. A bibulous, meat-eating monk who had been confounded in a disputation by Xuanzang lost his temper and started to abuse him: &#8220;You animal, you don't know your own surname or who your parents were. Don't try any of your clever tricks here.&#8221; Stung by this abuse, Xuanzang went into the temple and knelt before his teacher with tears streaming from his eyes.</P>
<P>&#8220;All men who are born between Heaven and Earth, and who are endowed with the Positive, the Negative, and the Five Elements&#8212;all are begotten by a father and reared by a mother,&#8221; he said. &#8220;How can there be any man alive who never had father and mother?&#8221; He begged over and over again to know his parents' names.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you really wish to find out about your father and mother, come with me into my cell,&#8221; said the abbot, and they went there together. The abbot lifted down a little box from on top of a massive beam, opened it, took out a letter written in blood and a shift, and gave them to Xuanzang, who unfolded the letter and read it. At last he learned about his parents and the wrongs they had suffered.</P>
<P>When he had read it he collapsed, weeping and crying out, &#8220;How can I be a man if I don't avenge my father and mother? For seventeen years I haven't known my own parents, but now I know that I have a mother. I would not be alive today, teacher, had you not rescued me and brought me up. Please allow me to go and see my mother, then I will put an incense-burner on my head and rebuild the temple to repay the great kindness you have shown me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you want to go and look for your mother you had better take the letter written in blood and the shift with you. If you go to the private residence of the prefect of Jiangzhou you will be able to see your mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>一日，暮春天气，众人同在松阴之下，讲经参禅，谈说奥妙。那酒肉和尚恰被玄奘难倒。和尚大怒，骂道：“你这业畜，姓名也不知，父母也不识，还在此捣什么鬼！”玄奘被他骂出这般言语，入寺跪告师父，眼泪双流道：“人生于天地之间，禀阴阳而资五行，尽由父生母养，岂有为人在世而无父母者乎？”再三哀告，求问父母姓名。长老道：“你真个要寻父母，可随我到方丈里来。”玄奘就跟到方丈，长老到重梁之上，取下一个小匣儿，打开来，取出血书一纸，汗衫一件，付与玄奘。玄奘将血书拆开读之，才备细晓得父母姓名，并冤仇事迹。玄奘读罢，不觉哭倒在地道：“父母之仇，不能报复，何以为人？十八年来，不识生身父母，至今日方知有母亲。此身若非师父捞救抚养，安有今日？容弟子去寻见母亲，然后头顶香盆，重建殿宇，报答师父之深恩也！”师父道：“你要去寻母，可带这血书与汗衫前去，只做化缘，径往江州私衙，才得你母亲相见。”</p>

<P>Xuanzang did as his teacher had said and went to Jiangzhou as a mendicant monk. It happened that Liu Hong was away on business, and as Heaven had arranged for mother and son to meet, Xuanzang went straight to the gateway of the residence to beg for alms. Miss Yin had dreamt the previous night of the moon being eclipsed and then coming back to its full roundness.</P>
<P>&#8220;I have never heard from my mother-in-law,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;and my husband was murdered by that evil man. My son was abandoned on the river, and if he was rescued and brought up, he would be seventeen now. Who knows, perhaps Heaven is going to make us meet today.&#8221; As she was deep in her reflections she heard someone chanting scriptures and calling for alms in front of her home, so she thought she would go out and ask him where he had come from, and he replied, &#8220;I am a disciple of Abbot Faming of the Jinshan Temple.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;A disciple of Abbot Faming of the Jinshan Temple, are you?&#8221; she said. She asked him in and gave him a vegetarian meal while observing closely the way he moved and talked.</P>
<P>He seemed very much like her husband, so she sent the servants away and asked, &#8220;Tell me, young teacher, have you been a monk since childhood or did you become one later in life? What is your name? Do you have a mother and father?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I did not become a monk when I was a child nor when I was older,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I must tell you that I bear a hatred as deep as the sea because of a terrible wrong. My father was murdered and my mother carried off by an evil man. The Abbot Faming, my teacher, told me to come and find my mother in the residence of the prefect of Jiangzhou.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What is your mother's name?&#8221; she asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;My mother's name is Yin Wenqiao,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;My father was called Chen Guangrui. My milk-name was Jiangliu, and my Buddhist name is Xuanzang.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am Yin Wenqiao,&#8221; she said, then added, &#8220;Have you any proof?&#8221; When he learned that she was his mother, Xuanzang fell to his knees and wept aloud.</P>
<P>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if you don't believe me, then look at this evidence&#8212;the blood letter and the shift.&#8221; As soon as she saw that they were the real ones, she and her son embraced each other and wept.</P>
<P>Then she said, &#8220;Go away at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I can't possibly leave you, mother, on the very day I've seen you after seventeen years of not even knowing who my parents were,&#8221; he said.</P>
<P>&#8220;My child, you must go away as fast as you can,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;The evil Liu will certainly kill you if he comes back. Tomorrow I'll pretend to be ill and say that I once made a vow to donate a hundred pairs of monks' shoes. I'll come to your temple to fulfil the vow, and I'll talk to you then.&#8221; Xuanzang obediently bowed to her and left.</p>

<p>玄奘领了师父言语，就做化缘的和尚，径至江州。适值刘洪有事出外，也是天教他母子相会，玄奘就直至私衙门口抄化。那殷小姐原来夜间得了一梦，梦见月缺再圆，暗想道：“我婆婆不知音信，我丈夫被这贼谋杀，我的儿子抛在江中，倘若有人收养，算来有十八岁矣，或今日天教相会，亦未可知。”正沉吟间，忽听私衙前有人念经，连叫“抄化”，小姐又乘便出来问道：“你是何处来的？”玄奘答道：“贫僧乃是金山寺法明长老的徒弟。”小姐道：“你既是金山寺长老的徒弟——”叫进衙来，将斋饭与玄奘吃。仔细看他举止言谈，好似与丈夫一般。小姐将从婢打发开去，问道：“你这小师父，还是自幼出家的？还是中年出家的？姓甚名谁？可有父母否？”玄奘答道：“我也不是自幼出家，我也不是中年出家，我说起来，冤有天来大，仇有海样深！我父被人谋死，我母亲被贼人占了。我师父法明长老教我在江州衙内寻取母亲。”小姐问道：“你母姓甚？”玄奘道：“我母姓殷，名唤温娇，我父姓陈，名光蕊。我小名叫做江流，法名取为玄奘。”小姐道：“温娇就是我。但你今有何凭据？”玄奘听说是他母亲，双膝跪下，哀哀大哭：“我娘若不信，见有血书汗衫为证！”温娇取过一看，果然是真，母子相抱而哭，就叫：“我儿快去！”玄奘道：“十八年不识生身父母，今朝才见母亲，教孩儿如何割舍？”小姐道：“我儿，你火速抽身前去！刘贼若回，他必害你性命！我明日假装一病，只说先年曾许舍百双僧鞋，来你寺中还愿。那时节，我有话与你说。”玄奘依言拜别。</p>

<P>Now that she had seen her son Miss Yin was both anxious and happy. One day she said that she was ill, and she lay in her bed refusing food and tea. When Liu Hong came back and asked what was the matter she said, &#8220;When I was young I once vowed that I would donate a hundred pairs of monks' shoes. Five days ago I dreamt that a monk came with a sharp sword in his hand to demand the shoes, and since then I haven't been feeling well.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's easily done,&#8221; said Liu Hong. &#8220;Why didn't you mention it before?&#8221; He took his place in the official hall and gave instructions to yamen assistants Wang and Li that every household living in the city of Jiangzhou was to make a pair of monk's shoes and hand them in within five days.</P>
<P>When the common people had handed all the shoes in, Miss Yin said to Liu Hong, &#8220;Now that the shoes have been made, what temples are there here to which I can take them to fulfil my vow?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In Jiangzhou we have the Jinshan Temple and the Jiaoshan Temple; you can go to whichever of them you prefer,&#8221; replied Liu Hong.</P>
<P>&#8220;I've long heard that the Jinshan Temple is a good one, so I'll go there,&#8221; she said. Liu Hong told the yamen assistants Wang and Li to arrange a boat. Miss Yin went aboard with a trusted servant, the boatman pushed off, and they headed for the Jinshan Temple.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>却说小姐自见儿子之后，心内一忧一喜。忽一日推病，茶饭不吃，卧于床上。刘洪归衙，问其原故，小姐道：“我幼时曾许下一愿，许舍僧鞋一百双。昨五日之前，梦见个和尚，手执利刃，要索僧鞋，便觉身子不快。”刘洪道：“这些小事，何不早说？”随升堂吩咐王左衙、李右衙：江州城内百姓，每家要办僧鞋一双，限五日内完纳。百姓俱依派完纳讫。小姐对刘洪道：“僧鞋做完，这里有什么寺院，好去还愿？”刘洪道：“这江州有个金山寺、焦山寺，听你在那个寺里去。”小姐道：“久闻金山寺好个寺院，我就往金山寺去。”刘洪即唤王、李二衙办下船只。小姐带了心腹人，同上了船，稍水将船撑开，就投金山寺去。</p>

<P>On his return to the temple Xuanzang gave Abbot Faming a full account of what had happened. The abbot was delighted. The next day a maid arrived at the temple to say that her mistress was coining to repay a vow, and all the monks came out to welcome her. When Miss Yin came into the temple she prayed to the Bodhisattva, offered a rich meal to the monks with a donation of money to each of them, and told her maid to put the shoes and the summer socks into the offertory tray. She then went into the Buddha-hall and worshipped with great devotion. When she told him to, Abbot Faming went away to distribute the gifts to the monks. Xuanzang saw that all the other monks had gone and that there was nobody else in the Buddha-hall, so he went up to his mother and knelt down. She told him to take off his shoes and socks and saw that one toe was indeed missing from his left foot. The pair of them hugged each other and cried again, then they bowed to the abbot to thank him for his kindness in bringing the boy up.</p>
<P>&#8220;I'm worried that the villain may get to know of your reunion,&#8221; said the abbot, &#8220;so you had better go back as quickly as you can to avoid trouble.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My son,&#8221; said Miss Yin, &#8220;I shall give you a sandalwood bracelet. You must go to a place called the Ten Thousand Flowers Inn to the Northwest of Hongzhou, which is about five hundred miles from here, where we left Madame Zhang, your paternal grandmother. I shall also write you a letter that you must take to the house of the minister Yin Kaishan which lies to the left of the palace inside the capital city of the Tang Emperor. He is my father. Give him this letter and ask him to submit a memorial to the Tang Emperor asking him to send horse and foot to capture or kill that bandit. Then your father will be avenged and your mother will be rescued. I must stay no longer as I am afraid that evil man may be suspicious if I am late back.&#8221; She left the temple and went back in her boat.</P>

<p>却说玄奘回寺，见法明长老，把前项说了一遍，长老甚喜。次日，只见一个丫鬟先到，说夫人来寺还愿。众僧都出寺迎接。小姐径进寺门，参了菩萨，大设斋衬，唤丫鬟将僧鞋暑袜，托于盘内。来到法堂，小姐复拈心香礼拜，就教法明长老分表与众僧去讫。</p>
<p>玄奘见众僧散了，法堂上更无一人，他却近前跪下。小姐叫他脱了鞋袜看时，那左脚上果然少了一个小指头。当时两个又抱住而哭，拜谢长老养育之恩。法明道：“汝今母子相会，恐奸贼知之，可速速抽身回去，庶免其祸。”小姐道：“我儿，我与你一只香环，你径到洪州西北地方，约有一千五百里之程，那里有个万花店，当时留下婆婆张氏在那里，是你父亲生身之母。我再写一封书与你，径到唐王皇城之内，金殿左边，殷开山丞相家，是你母生身之父母。你将我的书递与外公，叫外公奏上唐王，统领人马，擒杀此贼，与父报仇，那时才救得老娘的身子出来。我今不敢久停，诚恐贼汉怪我归迟。”便出寺登舟而去。</p>

<P>Xuanzang returned to the temple in tears and told the abbot that he was leaving at once for Hongzhou. When he reached the Ten Thousand Flowers Inn he said to the innkeeper Liu the Second, &#8220;How is the mother of Prefect Chen of Jiangzhou who is staying in your inn?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;She used to stay here,&#8221; replied the innkeeper. &#8220;She went blind, and as she didn't pay any rent for three or four years, she now lives in a ruined tile-kiln near the Southern gate and begs in the streets every day to keep herself alive. That official went away a very long time ago and she hasn't heard from him to this day, though I don't know why.&#8221; On learning this he asked the way to the ruined tile-kiln at the Southern gate and found his grandmother.</P>
<P>&#8220;You sound like my son Chen Guangrui,&#8221; said his grandmother.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm not Chen Guangrui, I'm his son. My mother is Miss Yin Wenqiao.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why have your father and mother not come?&#8221; she asked; and he replied, &#8220;My father was murdered by a brigand and my mother was forced to become his wife. I have a letter here and a sandalwood bracelet from my mother.&#8221; His grandmother took the letter and the bracelet, and sobbed aloud. &#8220;My son came here for the sake of fame and glory. I thought that he had forgotten all feelings of decency and gratitude; it never occurred to me that he might have been murdered. What a blessing that Heaven in its mercy did not cut short my son's line, so that I now have a grandson to come and find me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How did you go blind, granny?&#8221; asked Xuanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;I was always thinking of your father and longing for him to come back every day,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but as he never did I wept so much that! lost the sight of both my eyes.&#8221; Xuanzang fell to his knees and prayed to Heaven.</P>
<P>&#8220;Although I am seventeen,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I have been unable to avenge my parents. Today I have come on my mother's orders and found my grandmother; if Heaven is at all moved by my sincerity, may my granny's eyes see again.&#8221; When he had prayed, he licked her eyes with the tip of his tongue. The licking soon opened them, and they could see once more.</P>
<P>His grandmother looked at the little monk with a mixture of joy and sadness and said, &#8220;You really are my grandson&#8212;you're the very image of my son Guangrui.&#8221; Xuanzang took her out of the kiln and reinstalled her in Liu the Second's inn, where he rented a room for her, gave her some money to live on, and told her that he would be back within a month.</p>

<div class="right">
<p>玄奘哭回寺中，告过师父，即时拜别，径往洪州。来到万花店，问那店主刘小二道：“昔年江州陈客官有一母亲住在你店中，如今好么？”刘小二道：“他原在我店中。后来昏了眼，三四年并无店租还我，如今在南门头一个破瓦窑里，每日上街叫化度日。那客官一去许久，到如今杳无信息，不知为何。”玄奘听罢，即时问到南门头破瓦窑，寻着婆婆。婆婆道：“你声音好似我儿陈光蕊。”玄奘道：“我不是陈光蕊，我是陈光蕊的儿子。温娇小姐是我的娘。”婆婆道：“你爹娘怎么不来？”玄奘道：“我爹爹被强盗打死了，我娘被强盗霸占为妻。”婆婆道：“你怎么晓得来寻我？”玄奘道：“是我娘着我来寻婆婆。我娘有书在此，又有香环一只。”那婆婆接了书并香环，放声痛哭道：“我儿为功名到此，我只道他背义忘恩，那知他被人谋死！且喜得皇天怜念，不绝我儿之后，今日还有孙子来寻我。”玄奘问：“婆婆的眼，如何都昏了？”婆婆道：“我因思量你父亲，终日悬望，不见他来，因此上哭得两眼都昏了。”玄奘便跪倒向天祷告道：“念玄奘一十八岁，父母之仇不能报复。今日领母命来寻婆婆，天若怜鉴弟子诚意，保我婆婆双眼复明！”祝罢，就将舌尖与婆婆舔眼。须臾之间，双眼舔开，仍复如初。婆婆觑了小和尚道：“你果是我的孙子！恰和我儿子光蕊形容无二！”婆婆又喜又悲。玄奘就领婆婆出了窑门，还到刘小二店内，将些房钱赁屋一间与婆婆栖身，又将盘缠与婆婆道：“我此去只月余就回。”</p>
</div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<P>Taking his leave of his grandmother, he went straight on to the capital, where he found Minister Yin's house in the Eastern Avenue of the imperial city. &#8220;I am a relation of the minister's,&#8221; he said to the gate-keeper, &#8220;and I would like to see him.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the gate-keeper reported this to the minister, he said, &#8220;I am no relation of any monk.&#8221; But his wife said, &#8220;I had a dream last night that our daughter Man-tang-qiao came home; perhaps he has a letter from our son-in-law.&#8221;</P>
<P>The minister had the young monk brought into the main hall, and when the monk saw the minister and his wife he wept and bowed to the floor before them, then took an envelope out of his bosom and handed it to the minister. The minister opened the letter and read it through, then wailed aloud.</P>
<P>&#8220;What's the matter, my lord?&#8221; asked his wife, and the minister replied, &#8220;This monk is our grandson. Our son-in-law Chen Guangrui was murdered by a brigand, who forced Man-tang-qiao to become his wife.&#8221; His wife too began to weep bitterly when she heard this news.</P>
<P>&#8220;Try not to upset yourself, wife,&#8221; said the minister. &#8220;I shall ask our sovereign at court tomorrow morning to be allowed to lead an army myself. I shall certainly avenge our son-in-law.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>随即辞了婆婆，径往京城。寻到皇城东街殷丞相府上，与门上人道：“小僧是亲戚，来探相公。”门上人禀知丞相，丞相道：“我与和尚并无亲眷。”夫人道：“我昨夜梦见我女儿满堂娇来家，莫不是女婿有书信回来也。”丞相便教请小和尚来到厅上。小和尚见了丞相与夫人，哭拜在地，就怀中取出一封书来，递与丞相。丞相拆开，从头读罢，放声痛哭。夫人问道：“相公，有何事故？”丞相道：“这和尚是我与你的外甥。女婿陈光蕊被贼谋死，满堂娇被贼强占为妻。”夫人听罢，亦痛哭不止。丞相道：“夫人休得烦恼，来朝奏知主上，亲自统兵，定要与女婿报仇。”</p>
</div>

</div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<P>The minister went to court the next day and wrote in a memorial to the Tang Emperor: &#8220;Your subject's son-in-law, the top graduate Chen Guangrui, was murdered by the boatman Liu Hong while going with his family to take up his office in Jiangzhou, and my daughter was forced to become his wife. This Liu Hong has usurped office for many years by masquerading as my son-in-law. This constitutes treason. I beg Your Majesty to dispatch horse and foot at once to destroy this rebellious brigand.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Tang Emperor was so angry when he read this that he ordered Minister Yin to set off at the head of sixty thousand men of the Imperial Guard. The minister left the court with the decree and went to the parade ground to muster the soldiers before setting out for Jiangzhou. By setting out at dawn every day and not stopping till night, they traveled as fast as a shooting star or a flying bird, and before they realized it they had reached Jiangzhou, where Minister Yin's army camped on the Northern bank. That night he sent a messenger with a gold-inscribed tablet to summon the deputy prefect and district judge of Jiangzhou. Minister Tin explained the situation to them and told them to call out their troops to help him. They crossed the river together, and surrounded Liu Hong's yamen before dawn. Liu Hong, who was still in his dreams, heard the sound of cannon and the beating of drums and gongs; when the soldiers rushed his residence he was helpless and soon captured. The minister ordered that Liu Hong and his gang should be tied up and taken to the execution ground, while the army was to encamp outside the city walls.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>次日，丞相入朝，启奏唐王曰：“今有臣婿状元陈光蕊，带领家小江州赴任，被稍水刘洪打死，占女为妻；假冒臣婿，为官多年。事属异变。乞陛下立发人马，剿除贼寇。”唐王见奏大怒，就发御林军六万，着殷丞相督兵前去。丞相领旨出朝，即往教场内点了兵，径往江州进发。晓行夜宿，星落鸟飞，不觉已到江州。殷丞相兵马，俱在北岸下了营寨。星夜令金牌下户唤到江州同知、州判二人，丞相对他说知此事，叫他提兵相助，一同过江而去。天尚未明，就把刘洪衙门围了。刘洪正在梦中，听得火炮一响，金鼓齐鸣，众兵杀进私衙，刘洪措手不及，早被擒住。丞相传下军令，将刘洪一干人犯，绑赴法场，令众军俱在城外安营去了。</p>
</div>

</div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<P>The minister went into the main hall of the yamen and asked his daughter to come out and see him. His daughter, who had been longing to go out, felt too ashamed to face her father and so was on the point of hanging herself.</P>
<P>When Xuanzang learned of this he went as fast as he could to save her, fell on his knees, and said, &#8220;Your son and my grandfather have come here with an army to avenge my father. That brigand has been arrested, so there is no need at all for you to kill yourself. If you die mother, I won't be able to stay alive.&#8221; The minister too came into the residence to talk her out of it.</P>
<P>&#8220;They say that a woman should only have one husband in her life,&#8221; she said to them. &#8220;I was bitterly grieved at the death of my husband at that brigand's hands, and could not bear the disgrace of marrying his murderer; but as I was carrying my husband's child I had to swallow the shame of staying alive. Now, thank goodness, my son has grown up and my father has brought an army to avenge my husband but how could I have the face to see you. The only way I can make up for it to my husband is to kill myself.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My child,&#8221; said the minister, &#8220;this was not a case of abandoning morality for the sake of material gain. You acted under duress, and did nothing to be ashamed of.&#8221; Father and daughter then embraced each other and wept, while Xuanzang sobbed too. &#8220;There is no need for the two of you to be so distressed,&#8221; said the minister, wiping away his tears. &#8220;Today I have captured our enemy, that rebel, and now I must deal with him.&#8221; He got up and went to the execution ground.</P>
<P>As it happened, the assistant prefect of Jiangzhou had sent constables to arrest the other pirate, Li Biao, and they brought him in. The minister was very pleased, and he ordered that Liu Hong and Li Biao were to be put under a close guard. They were each given a hundred strokes of the heavy pole, and statements were taken from them about how and why they had committed the wicked murder of Chen Guangrui. Then Li Biao was nailed on a wooden donkey and pushed to the market-place, where he was sliced into a thousand pieces, after which his head was hung up on public display. Liu Hong was taken to the Hongjiang Estuary where he had murdered Chen Guangrui. The minister, his daughter and Xuanzang went to the riverside, where they made offerings and libations to the emptiness and cut out Liu Hong's heart and liver while he was still alive to sacrifice to Chen Guangrui. They also burnt a funerary address.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>丞相直入衙内正厅坐下，请小姐出来相见。小姐欲待要出，羞见父亲，就要自缢。玄奘闻知，急急将母解救，双膝跪下，对母道：“儿与外公，统兵至此，与父报仇。今日贼已擒捉，母亲何故反要寻死？母亲若死，孩儿岂能存乎？”丞相亦进衙劝解。小姐道：“吾闻妇人从一而终。痛夫已被贼人所杀，岂可面见颜从贼？止因遗腹在身，只得忍耻偷生。今幸儿已长大，又见老父提兵报仇，为女儿者，有何面目相见！惟有一死以报丈夫耳！”丞相道：“此非我儿以盛衰改节，皆因出乎不得已，何得为耻！”父子相抱而哭。玄奘亦哀哀不止。丞相拭泪道：“你二人且休烦恼，我今已擒捉仇贼，且去发落去来。”即起身到法场，恰好江州同知亦差哨兵拿获水贼李彪解到。丞相大喜，就令军牢押过刘洪、李彪，每人痛打一百大棍，取了供状，招了先年不合谋死陈光蕊情由，先将李彪钉在木驴上，推去市曹，剐了千刀，枭首示众讫。把刘洪拿到洪江渡口先年打死陈光蕊处。丞相与小姐、玄奘，三人亲到江边，望空祭奠，活剜取刘洪心肝，祭了光蕊，烧了祭文一道。</p>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<P>The bitter lamentations of the three of them startled the underwater palace. A patrolling yaksha demon handed the funerary address to the dragon king. When he had read it, the dragon king sent Marshal Turtle to ask Chen Guangrui to come and see him.</p>
<P>&#8220;Congratulations, sir, congratulations,&#8221; said the dragon king. &#8220;Your lady, your son and your father-in-law are all sacrificing to you on the bank. I shall now return your soul to you and give you an As-You-Will pearl, two rolling pearls, ten pieces of mermaid silk, and a belt of jade studded with pearls. Today you will be reunited with you wife, your son and your mother.&#8221; Chen Guangrui bowed to him over and over again to express his gratitude. The dragon king then told a yaksha to take Chen Guangrui's body out to the estuary, where he was to return the soul to it; and the yaksha obediently went off.</P>

<div class="right">
<p>三人望江痛哭，早已惊动水府。有巡海夜叉，将祭文呈与龙王。龙王看罢，就差鳖元帅去请光蕊来到，道：“先生，恭喜，恭喜！今有先生夫人、公子同岳丈俱在江边祭你。我今送你还魂去也。再有如意珠一颗，走盘珠二颗，绞绡十端，明珠玉带一条奉送。你今日便可夫妻子母相会也。”光蕊再三拜谢。龙王就令夜叉将光蕊身尸送出江口还魂，夜叉领命而去。</p>

<P>When she had wailed for her husband and sacrificed to him, Miss Tin tried to jump into the water to drown herself, but with a desperate effort Xuanzang managed to keep hold of her. Just at this tense moment they saw a corpse floating towards the bank. Miss Yin, rushing forward to see who it was, recognized it as that of her husband and started a great wailing. Everyone else had now come up to look, and they saw Chen Guangrui open his fist and stretch his foot as his body gradually began to move. Suddenly he sat up, to their great astonishment. He opened his eyes, and the first thing he saw was his wife, his father-in-law and the young monk all weeping beside him.</p>
<P>&#8220;What are you all doing here?&#8221; he asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;After you were killed I gave birth to this son,&#8221; replied his wife, &#8220;and by a piece of good fortune he was brought up by the abbot of the Jinshan Temple. When he came to find me I sent him to see my father; and when my father knew what had happened he submitted a memorial at court and brought an army here to arrest your murderer, whose heart and liver we have just plucked from his living body to sacrifice to you. But how is it that your soul has been returned to you, husband?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It is all because we bought and released that golden carp when we were staying at the Ten Thousand Flowers Inn: the carp, it turned out, was the local dragon king. When that treasonous murderer pushed me into the water I was rescued by the dragon king, who has given me back my soul and presented me with all the treasures I have on me. I never had any idea that you had borne this son, or that my father-in-law had avenged me. Our sorrows are now at an end. This is a very happy moment indeed.&#8221;</P>

<p>却说殷小姐哭奠丈夫一番，又欲将身赴水而死，慌得玄奘拚命扯住。正在仓皇之际，忽见水面上一个死尸浮来，靠近江岸之旁。小姐忙向前认看，认得是丈夫的尸首，一发嚎啕大哭不已。众人俱来观看，只见光蕊舒拳伸脚，身子渐渐展动，忽地爬将起来坐下，众人不胜惊骇。光蕊睁开眼，早见殷小姐与丈人殷丞相同着小和尚俱在身边啼哭。光蕊道：“你们为何在此？”小姐道：“因汝被贼人打死，后来妾身生下此子，幸遇金山寺长老抚养长大，寻我相会。我教他去寻外公，父亲得知，奏闻朝廷，统兵到此，拿住贼人。适才生取心肝，望空祭奠我夫，不知我夫怎生又得还魂。”光蕊道：“皆因我与你昔年在万花店时，买放了那尾金色鲤鱼，谁知那鲤鱼就是此处龙王。后来逆贼把我推在水中，全亏得他救我，方才又赐我还魂，送我宝物，俱在身上。更不想你生下这儿子，又得岳丈为我报仇。真是苦尽甘来，莫大之喜！”</p>

<P>When the other officials heard what had happened they all came to offer their congratulations, and the minister gave a banquet to thank all his subordinates. The army set off on its return journey that same day. When they reached the Ten Thousand Flowers Inn the minister ordered them to encamp while Guangrui and Xuanzang went to the inn to find the old lady. The night before she had dreamt of a withered tree blossoming again while magpies made a clamorous din behind the building.</P>
<P>&#8220;Perhaps my grandson has come,&#8221; she thought, and while the words were still in her mind she saw Guangrui and his son at the gate of the inn.</P>
<P>&#8220;Isn't this my grandmother?&#8221; said the little monk; and the moment Guangrui saw his aged mother he kowtowed to her. Mother and son embraced in tears; then he told her all about what had happened. The innkeeper's account was presented and settled, and then they set off for the capital. When they reached the minister's residence, Guangrui, his wife, his mother and Xuanzang all went in to see the minister's wife, who was overcome with joy and told the servants to lay on a large banquet to celebrate.</P>
<P>&#8220;We can call today's banquet a 'reunion banquet,'&#8220; said the minister, and the whole household was indeed happy.</p>

<p>众官闻知，都来贺喜。丞相就令安排酒席，答谢所属官员，即日军马回程。来到万花店，那丞相传令安营。光蕊便同玄奘到刘家店寻婆婆。那婆婆当夜得了一梦，梦见枯木开花，屋后喜鹊频频喧噪，想道：“莫不是我孙儿来也？”说犹未了，只见店门外，光蕊父子齐到。小和尚指道：“这不是俺婆婆？”光蕊见了老母，连忙拜倒。母子抱头痛哭一场，把上项事说了一遍。算还了小二店钱，起程回到京城。进了相府，光蕊同小姐与婆婆、玄奘都来见了夫人。夫人不胜之喜，吩咐家僮，大排筵宴庆贺。丞相道：“今日此宴可取名为团圆会。”真正合家欢乐。</p>

<P>When the Tang Emperor entered the throne hall early the next morning, Minister Yin stepped forward and submitted a memorial giving a detailed account of what had happened, and recommending Chen Guangrui as a man whose talents could be put to great use. The Tang Emperor approved the memorial and ordered that Chen Guangrui should be appointed a Scholar in order to take part in administration at court. As Xuanzang had decided to follow the contemplative life he was sent to cultivate his conduct in the Hongfu Temple. Later on Miss Yin finally ended her life in a quiet and honorable way, and Xuanzang went back to the Jinshan Temple to report to Abbot Faming. If you don't know what happened afterwards, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>次日早朝，唐王登殿，殷丞相出班，将前后事情备细启奏，并荐光蕊才可大用。唐王准奏，即命升陈萼为学士之职，随朝理政。玄奘立意安禅，送在洪福寺内修行。后来殷小姐毕竟从容自尽，玄奘自到金山寺中报答法明长老。不知后来事体若何，且听下回分解。	</div>
