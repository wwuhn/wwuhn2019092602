<P>The Emotions Bear a Grudge and Inflict Disaster</P>
<P>The Heart's Master Smashes the Light When He Meets the Demons</P>
</div>
<P>The story tells how the Great Sage Sun supported the Tang Priest as they hurried along the main road to the West together with Pig and Friar Sand. Within a few hours they were in sight of a compound with many tall towers and imposing buildings. &#8220;Disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang, reining in his horse, &#8220;what's that place?&#8221; Monkey looked up to gaze at it and this is what he saw.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Tall towers girdled by hills,</P>
<P>Streams winding round pavilions.</P>
<P>Dense grew the wood in front of the gates,</P>
<P>And outside the buildings the scent of flowers hung heavy.</P>
<P>White egrets perched among the willows,</P>
<P>Like flawless jades half hidden in a mist;</P>
<P>Golden orioles sang in the peach-trees,</P>
<P>Flashes of gold in the fiery blossom.</P>
<P>Wild deer in couples</P>
<P>Trod lost to the world across cushions of greenery;</P>
<P>Pairs of mountain birds</P>
<P>Sang as they flew among the red tree-tops.</P>
<P>It was like the Tiantai Cave of Liu and Ruan,</P>
<P>And rivaled the home of the immortals in fairyland.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; Brother Monkey reported, &#8220;that's no princely palace or rich man's mansion. It looks like a Taoist temple or Buddhist monastery. We'll know for sure when we get there.&#8221; On hearing this Sanzang whipped on his horse, and when master and disciples reached the gates to look there was a stone tablet set over the gateway on which was written YELLOW FLOWER TEMPLE. Sanzang dismounted.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yellow Flower Temple means it's a Taoist place,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;so it's all right for us to go in and see them. Although we wear different clothes we cultivate our conduct the same way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;We can go in and have a look round, and at the same time the horse can have a feed. If it looks suitable we can arrange a meal for the master.&#8221;</P>
<P>The master accepted their suggestions and the four of them went inside. A couplet was pasted up on either side of the inner gates:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Palace of immortals: yellow shoots and white snow.</P>
<P>Home of men who can fly: rare and wonderful flowers.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;So the Taoist here refines drugs, plays with a furnace and totes a crucible,&#8221; said Monkey with a grin.</P>
<P>&#8220;Watch your words,&#8221; said Sanzang, giving him a pinch, &#8220;watch your words. We don't know them and they are no relations of ours. This is only a passing encounter. Never mind what they are like.&#8221; Before he had finished saying these words he went in through the inner gate, where he found the doors of the main hall shut tight and a Taoist master sitting under a covered walkway making elixir pills. Just look at how he was dressed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On his head a bright red hat all set with gold,</P>
<P>On his body a jet-black Taoist robe.</P>
<P>On his feet a pair of deep green cloud-treading shoes,</P>
<P>Round his waist a brilliant yellow Lu Dongbin sash.</P>
<P>His face was round like a golden melon,</P>
<P>His eyes like bright stars.</P>
<P>His nose was as big and as high as a Muslim's,</P>
<P>And his lips turned back like a Tartar's.</P>
<P>His heart, set on the Way, was hidden thunder;</P>
<P>He was a true immortal, subduer of tigers and dragons.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As soon as he saw him Sanzang shouted at the top of his voice, &#8220;My respectful greetings, venerable Taoist master.&#8221; The Taoist looked up with a start and was so alarmed by what he saw that he dropped the elixir on which he was working.</P>
<P>Then he neatened his hair-pins and clothes, came down the steps and greeted Sanzang: &#8220;Venerable sir, excuse me for failing to meet you. Please come inside and sit down.&#8221; The venerable elder happily went up into the main hall. On pushing the doors open he saw the statues of the Three Pure Ones and an altar on which stood incense burners and incense, so he planted some joss-sticks in the burner and performed a triple set of obeisances to the Pure Ones before bowing to the Taoist master. He then went to the guest seats, where he sat down with his disciples. Immortal boys were told to bring tea at once, whereupon two boys went inside to fetch the tea-tray, wash the teacups, wipe the teaspoons and prepare some refreshments to eat with it. Their rushing about soon disturbed the pilgrims' enemies.</P>
<P>Now the seven devils from Gossamer Cave had been fellow-students of the Taoist master here, and it was here that they had hurried after putting on their old clothes and calling for their sons. They were making themselves new clothes at the back of the temple when they noticed the boys preparing the tea and asked, &#8220;What visitors have arrived, boys? What are you in such a rush for?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Four Buddhist monks have just turned up,&#8221; the boys replied, &#8220;and the master has told us to prepare tea for them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Is one of the monks pale and fat?&#8221; the she-devils asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Does one of them have a long snout and big ears?&#8221; they asked again.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Then take the tea in as quickly as you can,&#8221; the she-devils said, &#8220;and tip your master a wink to come in here. We've got something urgent to say to him.&#8221;</P>
<P>The boys took five cups of tea out to the Taoist master, who tucked back his sleeves and passed a cup with both hands first to Sanzang and then to Pig, Friar Sand and Brother Monkey. After the tea had been drunk the cups were collected and the boys gave their master a look, at which he bowed and said, &#8220;Please sit down, gentlemen. Boys, put the tray down and keep them company. I have to go out. I'll be back.&#8221; Sanzang and his disciples went out of the hall to look around, guided by one boy.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the Taoist master went back to the abbot's lodgings the seven women all fell to their knees and said, &#8220;Brother, brother, please listen to what we have to say.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Taoist master helped them to their feet and said, &#8220;When you came here this morning you wanted to tell me something, but because of the elixir pills I was making I couldn't see any women. That's why I had to refuse. I have visitors out there now, so you can tell me later.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We have to report, elder brother,&#8221; the she-devils said, &#8220;that it's because the strangers are here that we're talking to you. If the strangers go away there'll be no point in telling you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What are you talking about, sisters?&#8221; the Taoist master said. &#8220;Why do you have to talk to me just now, when the strangers are here? Have you gone off your heads? I'm a man who lives in peace and quiet cultivating immortality, but even if I were a layman with wife and children and family responsibilities I'd wait till my visitor had left before attending to them. How can you be so ill-behaved and disgrace me? Now let me go.&#8221;</P>
<P>All the she-devils grabbed him and said, &#8220;Please don't lose your temper, elder brother. Tell us where the visitors come from.&#8221; The Taoist master pulled a long face and ignored them. &#8220;When the boys came in for the tea just now they told us the visitors are four Buddhist monks,&#8221; the she-devils said.</P>
<P>&#8220;They're monks,&#8221; said the Taoist master angrily, &#8220;what of it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Does one of the four monks have a pale, fat face,&#8221; the she-devils asked, &#8220;and one of them a long snout and big ears? Did you ask them where they're from?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the Taoist said, &#8220;there are two like that among them. How did you know? I suppose you've seen them somewhere.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't know the terrible things that have happened, brother,&#8221; the devils said. &#8220;That monk was sent by the Tang court to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven. He came to our cave this morning begging for food. We captured him because we'd heard of this Tang Priest.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why did you capture him?&#8221; the Taoist asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;We've long known that the Tang Priest has a pure body because he has cultivated his conduct for ten successive incarnations,&#8221; the devils replied. &#8220;Anyone who eats a piece of his flesh will live for ever. That's why we captured him. Later the monk with a long snout and big ears kept us in the Filth-cleansing Spring. First he stole our clothes and then he used his magical powers to insist on bathing with us. He jumped into the water and turned himself into a catfish. From the way he kept swimming around between our thighs he obviously had very improper ideas. He was thoroughly disgraceful. Then he jumped out of the water and turned back into himself. As we weren't going to let him have his way he tried to kill us all with his nine-pronged rake. If we hadn't known a thing or two he'd have murdered the lot of us. We fled in fear and trembling and sent your nephews into battle. We don't know whether they are alive or dead. We have come here to fling ourselves on your mercy and beg you to avenge your fellow-students from long ago.&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing this the Taoist was furious, as could be seen from his changed expression. &#8220;What outrageous monks!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;What hooligans! Don't you worry: I'm going to sort them out.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you're going to fight them,&#8221; said the she-devils in gratitude, &#8220;you must let us help you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There'll be no need to fight,&#8221; said the Taoist, &#8220;no need. As the saying goes, you have to lower yourself to fight someone. Come with me.&#8221;</P>
<P>The women went with him into his room, where he carried a ladder behind the bed, climbed up to the rafters and brought down a little leather box. It was eight inches high, a foot long, four inches wide and locked with a tiny brass lock. From his sleeve he produced a square handkerchief of goose-yellow silk, to the fringes of which a tiny key was tied. Unlocking the box he brought out a packet containing a drug. This drug was:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A thousand pounds of droppings</P>
<P>From all kinds of mountain birds,</P>
<P>Boiled in a copper cauldron,</P>
<P>Reduced on an even fire,</P>
<P>Till the thousand pounds were only a spoonful</P>
<P>That was then reduced to a third.</P>
<P>This was fried even longer,</P>
<P>Refined and smoked once again.</P>
<P>To make the poisonous drug,</P>
<P>More precious than treasures or jewels.</P>
<P>Were you to try out its flavor,</P>
<P>One taste would send yon to Hell.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Sisters,&#8221; said the Taoist master, &#8220;any mortal who eats one grain of this treasure of mine will be dead when it reaches his stomach. Only three grains would be enough to kill a god or an immortal. As these monks may have mastered something of the Way they'll need three grains. Fetch my balance.&#8221; One of the women brought a balance at once.</P>
<P>&#8220;Weigh out twelve grains,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and divide that into four portions.&#8221; Then he took twelve red jujubes, pinched holes in them, stuffed a grain of the drug in each, and put them into four teacups. These were then placed with a fifth cup containing two black jujubes on a tray.</P>
<P>&#8220;Let me question them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If they aren't from Tang that'll be the end of it; but if they are I'll ask for fresh tea and you can give this tea to the boys to bring in. Once they drink it they'll all die and you'll be avenged. That'll cheer you up.&#8221; The seven women were beside themselves with gratitude.</P>
<P>The Taoist changed into another robe and walked out again with a great show of feigned courtesy. He urged the Tang Priest and the others to sit down in the guest seats again. &#8220;Please excuse me, venerable sir,&#8221; the Taoist said. &#8220;The reason why I neglected you just now was because I was at the back telling my disciples to choose some greens and radishes to cook as a vegetarian meal for you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We Buddhist monks came empty-handed,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;We could not possibly trouble you for a meal.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We are all men of religion,&#8221; replied the Taoist master with a smile. &#8220;Whenever we go to a monastery or temple we are entitled to three pints of rice, so why talk of being empty-handed? May I ask you, reverend sir, what monastery you are from, and why you are here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have been sent by His Majesty the Great Tang emperor to fetch the scriptures from the Great Thunder Monastery in the Western Heaven,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;As we were passing your Taoist temple we came in to pay our respects.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this news the Taoist's face was full of animation, as he said, &#8220;It was only because I did not realize you were so faithful to the most virtuous Buddha that I failed to come out a long way to meet you. Please forgive me. Please forgive me.&#8221; Then he told the boys to bring fresh tea at once and get a meal ready as soon as possible, at which the boys went straight inside to fetch the tea.</P>
<P>&#8220;Here's some good tea that's all ready,&#8221; the women called to them. &#8220;Take this in.&#8221; The boys did indeed take the five cups in, and the Taoist master hurriedly passed a cup of red jujube tea to the Tang Priest. As Pig was so big the Taoist took him for the senior disciple, and he thought Friar Sand was the next senior. Thinking that Monkey was the junior one the Taoist only handed him his cup fourth. By the time the sharp-eyed Brother Monkey took his cup he had already noticed that there were two black jujubes in the cup left on the tray.</P>
<P>&#8220;Let's change cups, sir,&#8221; he said. &#8220;To be honest with you,&#8221; the Taoist replied with a smile, &#8220;as a poor Taoist living out here in the wilds I am rather short of tea and food at the moment. I was looking for fruit out at the back just now and I could only find these twelve red jujubes to put into four cups of tea to offer you. As I had to take something with you I made another cup with these inferior jujubes to keep you company. This is just a gesture of respect.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What nonsense,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile. &#8220;As the ancients said, 'You are never poor if you are at home; but poverty on a journey is killing.' You're at home here, so why all this talk about being poor? It's wandering monks like us who are really poor. I'll swap with you. I insist.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said Sanzang when he heard this, &#8220;this immortal gentleman is being very hospitable. You have yours. There is no need for a swap.&#8221; Monkey had no choice. Taking the cup with his left hand he covered it with his right and watched them.</P>
<P>Pig, however, who apart from feeling hungry and thirsty had an enormous appetite at the best of times, picked the three red jujubes out of the cup as soon as he saw them and swallowed them noisily. The master ate his too, as did Friar Sand. In that very instant Pig's face changed color, tears started pouring from Friar Sand's eyes and the Tang Priest began to foam at the mouth. Unable to sit upright, all three of them fainted and fell to the floor.</P>
<P>Realizing that they had been poisoned, the Great Sage raised his teacup in his hands and threw it at the Taoist master's face. The Taoist stopped it with his sleeve and it shattered noisily as it fell to the floor. &#8220;You lout, monk,&#8221; said the Taoist in fury, &#8220;how dare you smash my cup?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Animal,&#8221; said Monkey abusively, &#8220;just look what you've done to those three! What have I ever done to you for you to give my people poisoned tea?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Beast,&#8221; said the Taoist master, &#8220;you asked for it. Don't you realize that?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We've only just come here and talked about things like where we should sit and where we're from,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;We didn't talk big. How can you say we asked for this trouble?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Did you beg for food in Gossamer Cave?&#8221; the Taoist master asked. &#8220;Did you bathe in the Filth-cleansing Spring?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There were seven she-devils in the Filth-cleansing Spring,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;From what you're saying you must be in cahoots with them. I'm sure you're an evil spirit yourself. Stay where you are and take this!&#8221; The splendid Great Sage felt in his ear for his gold-banded cudgel, waved it to make it as thick as a rice-bowl, and struck at the Taoist master's face. The Taoist rapidly turned and dodged the blow, then produced a fine sword with which he fought back.</P>
<P>Their cursing and fighting had by now disturbed the seven she-devils inside, who all rushed out shouting, &#8220;Spare yourself the trouble, elder brother. Let us catch him.&#8221; At the sight of them Monkey became angrier than ever. Whirling his iron cudgel around with both hands he dropped his guard and tumbled in among them, lashing out wildly. The seven women then undid their clothes, revealing their white stomachs, and from their navels they produced by magic thick silken ropes that came reeling out in such abundance that they formed a canopy under which Brother Monkey was confined.</P>
<P>Seeing that things were going badly Monkey got up, said the words of a spell, did a somersault, smashed through the canopy and escaped. Then he stood gloomily in mid-air, controlling his temper and watching as the flashing silken ropes crisscrossed like the warp and weft of cloth on the loom. Within a moment the Yellow Flower Temple's towers and halls were all completely concealed. &#8220;Terrible,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;they're terrible. I've never been up against anything like that before. No wonder Pig fell over so often. What am I to do now? The master and my brothers have been poisoned. This gang of devils are all hand in glove, and I know nothing about their background. I'll go back and question that local god.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage brought his cloud down to land, made a spell with his fingers, said the sacred syllable<I> Om,</I> and forced the old local god to come to him again. The old deity knelt beside the path, trembling with fear and kowtowing as he said, &#8220;Great Sage, you went to rescue your master. Why are you back again?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I rescued him this morning,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and a little way ahead from there we reached a Yellow Flower Temple. When I went in with the master to look around, the head Taoist of the temple greeted us, and in the middle of our conversation he knocked out my master and the other two with poisoned tea. Luckily I didn't drink any, but when I was going to hit him with my cudgel he started talking about begging for food at Gossamer Cave and bathing at the Filth-cleansing Spring, so I knew he was a monster. No sooner had he raised his hand to fight back than the seven women came out and set off their silken ropes. It was a good thing I had the know-how to get away. I reckon that as you're a god who lives round here you're bound to know their background. What sort of evil spirit are they? Tell me the truth if you don't want to be hit.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's less than ten years since those evil spirits came here,&#8221; said the local deity, kowtowing. &#8220;When I was making an inspection three years ago I saw what they really are: seven spider spirits. The silken ropes that come out of them are spiders' webs.&#8221;</P>
<P>The news thoroughly delighted Monkey, who said, &#8220;From what you tell me they're no problem. Very well then. You can go back while I use magic to subdue him.&#8221; The local god kowtowed and went.</P>
<P>Monkey then went to the outside of the Yellow Flower Temple, pulled seventy hairs out of his tail, blew on them with magic breath and shouted, &#8220;Change!&#8221; The hairs turned into seventy little Monkeys. He then blew a magic breath on his gold-banded cudgel, called &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned it into seventy two-pronged forks, one of which he gave to each of the little Monkeys. Monkey himself used one of the forks to twist the silken ropes as he stood outside, then they all attacked together to the rhythm of a tune, tearing the ropes to pieces, each of them tearing off over ten pounds of rope. They dragged seven spiders out from inside. Each was about the size of a wicker basket. All of them held their hands and feet together and had ropes round their necks.</P>
<P>&#8220;Spare us, spare us,&#8221; they said. The seventy little Monkeys then pressed the seven spiders to the ground, refusing to let them go.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't hit them,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;All we want is to make them give my master and my brothers back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Elder Brother,&#8221; shrieked the demons at the tops of their voices, &#8220;give the Tang Priest back and save our lives.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Taoist master rushed outside saying, &#8220;Sisters, I'm going to eat the Tang Priest. I can't save you.&#8221;</P>
<P>This infuriated Brother Monkey. &#8220;If you won't give my master back just watch what happens to your sisters.&#8221; The splendid Great Sage waved his fork, turned it back into an iron cudgel that he lifted with both hands and smashed the seven spider spirits to pulp. Then he shook his tail a couple of times, put the hairs back on it and charged inside alone, swinging his cudgel to fight the Taoist master.</P>
<P>When the Taoist master saw Monkey kill his seven fellow-students it was more than he could bear. Goaded to fury, he raised his sword to fight back. In this battle each of them was seething with anger and giving full play to his divine powers. It was a fine battle:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The evil spirit swung a fine sword;</P>
<P>The Great Sage raised his gold-banded cudgel.</P>
<P>Both were fighting for Sanzang of the Tang,</P>
<P>On whose account the seven women had been killed.</P>
<P>Now they were fighting with all-round skill,</P>
<P>Showing their mighty powers with their weapons.</P>
<P>Powerful was the Great Sage's aura,</P>
<P>And rough the courage of the evil immortal.</P>
<P>Their vigorous moves were as rich as brocade,</P>
<P>And both hands moved as fast as a windlass.</P>
<P>Noisily clanged the sword and cudgel,</P>
<P>And ominously pale were the floating clouds.</P>
<P>Few were the words they spoke</P>
<P>As they used their cunning,</P>
<P>Moving to and fro like brush-strokes in a painting.</P>
<P>The wind and dust they raised scared wolves and tigers;</P>
<P>The stars disappeared as heaven and earth went dark.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the Taoist master had fought fifty or sixty rounds with the Great Sage he felt his hand weakening and his sinews getting slack, so he undid his belt and with a loud flapping noise took off his black robe. &#8220;Well, my lad,&#8221; said the Great Sage with a laugh, &#8220;if you can't beat me you still won't be able to when you strip off.&#8221; Once the Taoist master had stripped off his clothes he raised both hands to reveal under his ribs a thousand eyes flashing golden light. It was terrible:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Dense yellow smoke,</P>
<P>Brilliant golden light.</P>
<P>The dense yellow smoke</P>
<P>Gushed out as clouds from under his ribs;</P>
<P>The brilliant golden light</P>
<P>Came from a thousand eyes like fire.</P>
<P>To left and right they seemed like golden pails;</P>
<P>To East and West they resembled bells of bronze.</P>
<P>Thus an evil immortal used his magic power,</P>
<P>A Taoist master showed divine ability,</P>
<P>Dazzling the eyes, blotting out sun, moon and sky,</P>
<P>Blanketing people with acrid vapors.</P>
<P>The Great Sage Equaling Heaven</P>
<P>Was caught in the golden light and yellow smoke.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey started lashing out desperately with his hands and feet, but could only spin around inside the golden light, unable to take a step either forwards or backwards. It was as if he were turning round and round in a bucket. It was hopeless. He was unbearably hot. In his anxiety he leapt into the air, smashing against the golden light, and crashing head first to the ground. His head ached where he had hit it, and felt anxiously to find that the top of his scalp was tender.</P>
<P>&#8220;What lousy luck,&#8221; he though, &#8220;what lousy luck. This head's useless today. Usually swords and axes can't hurt it, so why has golden light bruised it now? After a while it's bound to go septic, and even if it does get better I might have tetanus.&#8221; He was still feeling unbearably hot. &#8220;I can't move forward or back,&#8221; he thought, working out a plan, &#8220;or to left or right, and I can't smash my way through by going up. Whatever shall I do? I'll damn well have to get out by going down.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage said the words of a spell, shook himself, and turned into one of those scaly diggers called pangolins. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Four sets of iron claws</P>
<P>Dug through the mountain, smashing rocks like powder.</P>
<P>The scales covering his body</P>
<P>Carved through ridges and crags like slicing scallions.</P>
<P>His eyes were as bright</P>
<P>As two gleaming stars;</P>
<P>His mouth was sharper</P>
<P>Than a steel drill or brazen auger.</P>
<P>He was the scaly mountain-borer used in medicine,</P>
<P>The creature known as the pangolin.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Watch him as he burrows into the ground with his head, not coming out again till he has covered over six miles. The golden light could only enclose about three miles. When he emerged and turned back into himself he was exhausted. His muscles ached, his whole body was in pain, and he could not help weeping. Suddenly he burst out with, &#8220;Master,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Since leaving the mountain and joining the faith</P>
<P>I've worked very hard on our way to the West.</P>
<P>The waves of the ocean are nothing to fear,</P>
<P>But in this dry gulch I've come out second best.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Just as the Handsome Monkey King was feeling miserable the sound of sobs could suddenly be heard from the other side of the mountain. Leaning forward and drying his tears he turned to look. A woman appeared, dressed in deep mourning and sobbing at every step as she came from the other side of the mountain. She was holding a dish of cold rice gruel in her left hand and several pieces of yellow paper money for burning to the dead in her right. Monkey sighed and nodded as he said to himself, &#8220;This is a case of</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Weeping eyes meeting weeping eyes,</P>
<P>One broken heart coming across another.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I wonder what this woman is crying about. I'll ask her.&#8221; Before long the woman was coming along the path towards him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Lady Bodhisattva,&#8221; asked Brother Monkey with a bow, &#8220;who are you weeping for?&#8221;</P>
<P>Through her tears the woman replied, &#8220;My husband was murdered by the master of the Yellow Flower Temple with poisoned tea because he got into a quarrel with him over the purchase of some bamboo poles. I'm going to burn this paper money as a mark of my love for him.&#8221;</P>
<P>This made Monkey's tears flow. The sight made the woman say angrily, &#8220;You ignorant fool. I'm grieving over my husband, but what business do you have to be weeping and looking so miserable? Are you mocking me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please don't be angry, Bodhisattva,&#8221; said Monkey with a bow. &#8220;I'm Sun Wukong the Novice, the senior disciple of Tang Sanzang, the younger brother of the Great Tang Emperor in the East. When we passed the Yellow Flower Temple on our way to the Western Heaven we stopped to rest, but the Taoist master there is some kind of evil spirit who's the sworn brother of seven spider spirits. When the spider spirits wanted to kill my master in Gossamer Cave I and my brother disciples Pig and Friar Sand managed to save him. The spider spirits fled to the Taoist's place and told him a pack of lies about us bullying them, so the Taoist knocked out my master and brothers. The three of them and the horse are now prisoners in his temple. I was the only one who didn't drink the tea. I smashed the cup and he attacked me. Because of the noise the seven spider spirits rushed outside to give out their silken ropes and catch me in the web they wove. I only got away by magic. After I'd found out who they really were I used my power of giving myself extra bodies to tear the silken ropes to pieces, drag the demons out and beat them to death. The Taoist master wanted revenge, so he went for me with his sword. When we'd gone sixty rounds he fled beaten, took off his clothes, and used the thousand eyes he has under his ribs to give off countless beams of golden light. I was caught under them, unable to move forwards or backwards, so I turned into a pangolin and burrowed my way out underground. It was when I was feeling thoroughly depressed that I heard you weeping, which was why I asked you those questions. When I saw that you had paper money to give your husband I felt wretched and miserable because I've got nothing for my master when he dies. Making fun of you was the last thing on my mind!&#8221;</P>
<P>Putting down the gruel and the paper money the woman returned Brother Monkey's bow and said, &#8220;Please forgive me. I didn't realize that you were a sufferer too. From what you've just said you don't know who that Taoist is. He's really the Demon King Hundred-eye, who's also known as the Many-eyed Monster. You must have tremendous magical powers to have escaped from the golden light and fought so long, but you couldn't get near him. I'll tell you about a sage you can send for who would be able to smash the golden light and defeat the Taoist.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey's immediate response was to chant a &#8220;na-a-aw&#8221; of respect and say, &#8220;If you know the sage's background, lady Bodhisattva, may I trouble you to tell me about it? If there is such a sage I'll fetch him to rescue my master and avenge your husband.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll tell you,&#8221; the woman said, &#8220;and you can fetch the sage, who will subdue the Taoist, but that will only bring revenge. I'm afraid the sage won't be able to rescue your master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;His poison is truly lethal,&#8221; the woman replied. &#8220;When people are laid low by it the very marrow of their bones rots within three days. I'm afraid that by the time you've been to see the sage and come back again you'll be too late to save him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I know how to travel,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;However far it is I'll only take half a day.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you can travel then listen to this,&#8221; the woman said. &#8220;About three hundred miles from here there's a mountain called Mount Purple Clouds, and in the mountain there's a Thousand Flower Cave where there lives a sage called Vairambha who will be able to defeat that demon.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where's the mountain?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;Which direction should I take?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's due South of here,&#8221; the woman replied, pointing; and by the time Brother Monkey looked back at her she had disappeared.</P>
<P>Monkey quickly did a kowtow and said, &#8220;Which Bodhisattva was that? After all that burrowing you disciple was feeling too stupid to recognize you. I beg you to tell me your name so that I can thank you.&#8221; At this there came a shout from mid-air, &#8220;Great Sage, it's me.&#8221; Monkey quickly looked up to see that it was the Old Lady of Mount Li. Catching up with her in the sky he thanked her with the words, &#8220;Where have you come from to give me these instructions?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;On my way back from Dragon Flower Assembly I noticed that your master was in trouble,&#8221; the Old Lady replied. &#8220;It was to save his life that I pretended to be a woman in mourning for her husband. Hurry up and fetch the sage. But don't tell her I sent you: she is rather difficult.&#8221;</P>
<P>Thanking her, Monkey took his leave and set off straight away on his somersault cloud. Once at Mount Purple Clouds he brought his cloud down and saw the Thousand Flower Cave. Outside the cave:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Blue pines masked the splendid view,</P>
<P>Turquoise cypresses surrounded the immortal's home.</P>
<P>Green willows were packed close along the mountain paths,</P>
<P>Rare flowers filled the watercourses.</P>
<P>Orchids grew all around stone buildings,</P>
<P>And scented blooms gave color to the crags.</P>
<P>Flowing water linked ravines with green,</P>
<P>While clouds enclosed the emptiness of trees.</P>
<P>Noisily sang wild birds.</P>
<P>Slowly strolled the deer,</P>
<P>Elegant grew the bamboo,</P>
<P>And all the red plums were open.</P>
<P>Rooks perched in ancient woods,</P>
<P>While spring birds chirped in the tree of heaven.</P>
<P>Summer wheat filled spreading acres,</P>
<P>And autumn millet grew all over the land.</P>
<P>No leaf fell in all four seasons.</P>
<P>And flowers bloomed throughout the year.</P>
<P>Auspicious rosy glows joined with the Milky Way,</P>
<P>And clouds of good omen were linked with the Great Emptiness.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Great Sage was delighted as he went inside, seeing boundless beauty at every stage. He went straight on, but found it deserted and completely silent. Not even a chicken or a dog could be heard. &#8220;I think that this sage must be out.&#8221; Monkey thought. When he had gone a mile or two further on he saw a Taoist nun sitting on a couch. This is what she looked like:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>She wore a five-flowered hat of brocade,</P>
<P>And a robe of golden silk.</P>
<P>Her cloud-treading shoes were patterned with phoenixes</P>
<P>And round her waist was a sash with double tassels.</P>
<P>Her face looked as old as autumn after a frost,</P>
<P>But her voice was as charming as swallows in the spring.</P>
<P>Long had she mastered the Dharma of Three Vehicles,</P>
<P>And she was ever mindful of the Four Truths.</P>
<P>She knew true achievement, that emptiness is empty,</P>
<P>And through her training had acquired great freedom.</P>
<P>She was the Buddha of the Thousand Flower Cave,</P>
<P>The illustrious Vairambha of great fame.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey went straight up to her without stopping and said, &#8220;Greetings, Bodhisattva Vairambha.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Bodhisattva then came down from her couch, put her hands together to return his greeting and said, &#8220;Great Sage, it was remiss of me not to come out to greet you. Where have you come from?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How do you know that I'm the Great Sage?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;When you made havoc in Heaven the other year,&#8221; Vairambha replied, &#8220;your picture was circulated everywhere. That's why everyone can recognize you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How true it is,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;that</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>While good deeds stay at home</P>
<P>Bad deeds are known far and wide.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Take my conversion to Buddhism, for example. You didn't know about that.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Congratulations,&#8221; said Vairambha. &#8220;When did that happen?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Not long ago my life was spared to escort my master the Tang Priest on his journey to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;My master has been laid low with poisoned tea by the Taoist of the Yellow Flower Temple. When I was fighting with him he caught me in his golden light, and I had to use magic to escape. I have come here to pay you my respects, Bodhisattva, and ask your help because I've heard that you are able to destroy his golden light.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Who told you that?&#8221; the Bodhisattva asked. &#8220;I have not left here since the Ullambana assembly over three hundred years ago. I've lived in complete secrecy and nobody has heard of me, so how is it that you know of me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm an underground devil,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and I can make my own enquiries anywhere at all.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; Vairambha said, &#8220;never mind. I shouldn't really go, but as you have honoured me with a visit, Great Sage, and as the great cause of fetching the scriptures must not be allowed to fail I'll go with you.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey thanked her and said, &#8220;It's very ignorant of me to hurry you along in this way. I wonder what weapon you use.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have an embroidery needle that will put an end to that damned creature,&#8221; said the Bodhisattva.</P>
<P>This was too much for Monkey. &#8220;Old Lady, you've been wasting my time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Had I known it was an embroidery needle I wouldn't have had to trouble you. I could have provided a hundredweight of them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your embroidery needles are all made of iron, steel or gold,&#8221; the Bodhisattva replied. &#8220;They're no use. My treasure isn't iron and isn't steel and isn't gold. It was tempered by my son in the sun.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Who is he?&#8221; asked Monkey. &#8220;He is the Star Lord of the Mane,&#8221; Vairambha replied.</P>
<P>This came as a shock to Monkey, who gazed at the golden light then turned to Vairambha and said, &#8220;The Yellow Flower Temple is where that golden light is coming from.&#8221; Vairambha then took from the lapel of her gown an embroidery needle about the thickness of an eyebrow hair and half an inch long. Holding it between her fingers she threw it into the air. A few moments later there was a loud noise and the golden light was shattered.</P>
<P>&#8220;That's wonderful, Bodhisattva, wonderful!&#8221; exclaimed a delighted Monkey. &#8220;Let's find your needle now.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Isn't this it here?&#8221; asked Vairambha, who was holding it in her hand. Brother Monkey brought his cloud down to land with hers and went into the temple, where he found the Taoist with his eyes shut, unable to move. &#8220;Stop playing blind, damned demon,&#8221; he said abusively, taking his cudgel from his ear ready to hit the Taoist with.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't hit him, Great Sage,&#8221; said Vairambha. &#8220;Go and see your master.&#8221;</P>
<P>On going straight to the reception room at the back Monkey found the three of them bringing up mucus and spittle where they lay on the floor. &#8220;What am I to do?&#8221; wept Monkey. &#8220;What am I to do?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't grieve, Great Sage,&#8221; said Vairambha. &#8220;As I've come out today I think I might as well accumulate some merit by giving you three of these pills that are an antidote to the poison.&#8221; Monkey turned round to bow down and beg her for them, whereupon she produced a torn paper packet from her sleeve containing three red pills that she handed to Monkey, telling him to put one in each of their mouths. This he did, forcing their teeth apart. A few moments later they all started vomiting as the drug reached their stomachs, bringing up the poison and coming back to life. Pig was the first to scramble to his feet.</P>
<P>&#8220;I feel suffocated,&#8221; he said. Sanzang and Friar Sand both came round too, saying that they felt very dizzy.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your tea was poisoned,&#8221; Brother Monkey explained. &#8220;It was the Bodhisattva Vairambha who saved you. Hurry up and bow to her in thanks.&#8221; Sanzang bowed to her to show his gratitude as he straightened up his clothes.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;where's that Taoist? I've got some questions to ask him about why he tried to murder me.&#8221; Monkey then told him all about the spider spirits.</P>
<P>&#8220;If spider spirits are his sisters that damned creature must be an evil spirit too,&#8221; said Pig with fury.</P>
<P>&#8220;He's standing outside the main hall pretending to be blind,&#8221; said Monkey, pointing.</P>
<P>Pig grabbed his rake and was about to hit the Taoist with it when Vairambha stopped him and said, &#8220;Control your temper, Marshal Tian Peng. As the Great Sage knows, I have no servants in my cave. I am going to take him as my doorkeeper.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We are deeply indebted to your great power,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and we will of course obey. But we would like you to turn him back into his real self so that we can have a look at him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Easily done,&#8221; said Vairambha, stepping forward and pointing at the Taoist, who collapsed into the dust and reverted to his real form of a giant centipede spirit seven feet long. Picking him up with her little finger Vairambha rode her auspicious cloud straight back to the Thousand Flower Cave. &#8220;That old lady's a real terror,&#8221; said Pig, looking up. &#8220;How did she manage to subdue that evil creature?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When I asked her what weapon she had to smash the golden light with,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;she told me about a golden embroidery needle of hers that her son had tempered in the sun. When I asked her who her son was she told me he was the Star Lord of the Mane. As I remember, the Mane Star is a cock, so his mother must be a hen. Hens are very good at dealing with centipedes, which is why she could subdue him.&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing this Sanzang performed no end of kowtows. &#8220;Disciples,&#8221; he ordered, &#8220;go and get things ready.&#8221; Friar Sand then went inside to find some rice and prepare a vegetarian meal, so that they could all eat their fill. Then they led the horse up, shouldered the carrying-pole, and asked the master to set out. Monkey started a blaze in the kitchen that in an instant burnt the whole temple to ashes. He then set out on his way. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Tang Priest thanked Vairambha for saving his life;</P>
<P>The emotions were eliminated and the Many-eyed Monster removed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As for what happened on the way ahead, listen to the explanations in the next installment.</P>

<div class="title">
<p>情因旧恨生灾毒</p>
<p>心主遭魔幸破光</p>
</div>
<p>话说孙大圣扶持着唐僧，与八戒、沙僧奔上大路，一直西来。不半晌，忽见一处楼阁重重，宫殿巍巍。唐僧勒马道：“徒弟，你看那是个甚么去处？”行者举头观看，忽然见：山环楼阁，溪绕亭台。门前杂树密森森，宅外野花香艳艳。柳间栖白鹭，浑如烟里玉无瑕；桃内啭黄莺，却似火中金有色。双双野鹿，忘情闲踏绿莎茵；对对山禽，飞语高鸣红树杪。真如刘阮天台洞，不亚神仙阆苑家。行者报道：“师父，那所在也不是王侯第宅，也不是豪富人家，却象一个庵观寺院，到那里方知端的。”三藏闻言，加鞭促马。师徒们来至门前观看，门上嵌着一块石板，上有黄花观三字。三藏下马，八戒道：“黄花观乃道士之家，我们进去会他一会也好，他与我们衣冠虽别，修行一般。”沙僧道：</p>

<p>“说得是，一则进去看看景致，二来也当撒货头口。看方便处，安排些斋饭与师父吃。”长老依言，四众共入，但见二门上有一对春联：“黄芽白雪神仙府，瑶草琪花羽士家。”行者笑道：“这个是烧茅炼药，弄炉火，提罐子的道士。”三藏捻他一把道：“谨言！谨言！我们不与他相识，又不认亲，左右暂时一会，管他怎的？”说不了，进了二门，只见那正殿谨闭，东廊下坐着一个道士在那里丸药。你看他怎生打扮：戴一顶红艳艳戗金冠，穿一领黑淄淄乌皂服，踏一双绿阵阵云头履，系一条黄拂拂吕公绦。面如瓜铁，目若朗星。准头高大类回回，唇口翻张如达达。</p>

<p>道心一片隐轰雷，伏虎降龙真羽士。三藏见了，厉声高叫道：</p>

<p>“老神仙，贫僧问讯了。”那道士猛抬头，一见心惊，丢了手中之药，按簪儿，整衣服，降阶迎接道：“老师父失迎了，请里面坐。”</p>

<p>长老欢喜上殿，推开门，见有三清圣象，供桌有炉有香，即拈香注炉，礼拜三匝，方与道士行礼。遂至客位中，同徒弟们坐下。</p>

<p>急唤仙童看茶，当有两个小童，即入里边，寻茶盘，洗茶盏，擦茶匙，办茶果。忙忙的乱走，早惊动那几个冤家。</p>

<p>原来那盘丝洞七个女怪与这道士同堂学艺，自从穿了旧衣，唤出儿子，径来此处。正在后面裁剪衣服，忽见那童子看茶，便问道：“童儿，有甚客来了，这般忙冗？”仙童道：“适间有四个和尚进来，师父教来看茶。”女怪道：“可有个白胖和尚？”</p>

<p>道：“有。”又问：“可有个长嘴大耳朵的？”道：“有。”女怪道：“你快去递了茶，对你师父丢个眼色，着他进来，我有要紧的话说。”果然那仙童将五杯茶拿出去。道士敛衣，双手拿一杯递与三藏，然后与八戒、沙僧、行者。茶罢收锺，小童丢个眼色，那道士就欠身道：“列位请坐。”教：“童儿，放了茶盘陪侍，等我去去就来。”此时长老与徒弟们，并一个小童出殿上观玩不题。</p>

<p>却说道士走进方丈中，只见七个女子齐齐跪倒，叫：“师兄！师兄！听小妹子一言！”道士用手搀起道：“你们早间来时，要与我说甚么话，可可的今日丸药，这枝药忌见阴人，所以不曾答你。如今又有客在外面，有话且慢慢说罢。”众怪道：“告禀师兄，这桩事，专为客来方敢告诉，若客去了，纵说也没用了。”</p>

<p>道士笑道：“你看贤妹说话，怎么专为客来才说？却不疯了？且莫说我是个清静修仙之辈，就是个俗人家，有妻子老小家务事，也等客去了再处。怎么这等不贤，替我装幌子哩！且让我出去。”众怪又一齐扯住道：“师兄息怒，我问你，前边那客，是那方来的？”道士唾着脸不答应，众怪道：“方才小童进来取茶，我闻得他说，是四个和尚。”道士作怒道：“和尚便怎么？”众怪道：“四个和尚，内有一个白面胖的，有一个长嘴大耳的，师兄可曾问他是那里来的？”道士道：“内中是有这两个，你怎么知道？想是在那里见他来？”女子道：“师兄原不知这个委曲。那和尚乃唐朝差往西天取经去的，今早到我洞里化斋，委是妹子们闻得唐僧之名，将他拿了。”道士道：“你拿他怎的？”女子道：</p>

<p>“我等久闻人说，唐僧乃十世修行的真体，有人吃他一块肉，延寿长生，故此拿了他。后被那个长嘴大耳朵的和尚把我们拦在濯垢泉里，先抢了衣服，后弄本事，强要同我等洗浴，也止他不住。他就跳下水，变作一个鲇鱼，在我们腿裆里钻来钻去，欲行奸骗之事，果有十分惫懒！他又跳出水去，现了本相，见我们不肯相从，他就使一柄九齿钉钯，要伤我们性命。若不是我们有些见识，几乎遭他毒手。故此战兢兢逃生，又着你愚外甥与他敌斗，不知存亡如何。我们特来投兄长，望兄长念昔日同窗之雅，与我今日做个报冤之人！”那道士闻此言，却就恼恨，遂变了声色道：“这和尚原来这等无礼！这等惫懒！你们都放心，等我摆布他！”众女子谢道：“师兄如若动手，等我们都来相帮打他。”道士道：“不用打！不用打！常言道，一打三分低，你们都跟我来。”</p>

<p>众女子相随左右。他入房内，取了梯子，转过床后，爬上屋梁，拿下一个小皮箱儿。那箱儿有八寸高下，一尺长短，四寸宽窄，上有一把小铜锁儿锁住。即于袖中拿出一方鹅黄绫汗巾儿来，汗巾须上系着一把小钥匙儿。开了锁，取出一包儿药来，此药乃是：山中百鸟粪，扫积上千斤。是用铜锅煮，煎熬火候匀。</p>

<p>千斤熬一杓，一杓炼三分。三分还要炒，再锻再重熏。制成此毒药，贵似宝和珍。如若尝他味，入口见阎君！道士对七个女子道：“妹妹，我这宝贝，若与凡人吃，只消一厘，入腹就死；若与神仙吃，也只消三厘就绝。这些和尚，只怕也有些道行，须得三厘。快取等子来。”内一女子急拿了一把等子道：“称出一分二厘，分作四分。”却拿了十二个红枣儿，将枣掐破些儿，揌上一厘，分在四个茶锺内；又将两个黑枣儿做一个茶锺，着一个托盘安了，对众女说：“等我去问他。不是唐朝的便罢；若是唐朝来的，就教换茶，你却将此茶令童儿拿出。但吃了，个个身亡，就与你报了此仇，解了烦恼也。”七女感激不尽。</p>

<p>那道士换了一件衣服，虚礼谦恭走将出去，请唐僧等又至客位坐下道：“老师父莫怪，适间去后面吩咐小徒，教他们挑些青菜萝卜，安排一顿素斋供养，所以失陪。”三藏道：“贫僧素手进拜，怎么敢劳赐斋？”道士笑云：“你我都是出家人，见山门就有三升俸粮，何言素手？敢问老师父，是何宝山？到此何干？”</p>

<p>三藏道：“贫僧乃东土大唐驾下差往西天大雷音寺取经者。却才路过仙宫，竭诚进拜。”道士闻言，满面生春道：“老师乃忠诚大德之佛，小道不知，失于远候，恕罪！恕罪！”叫：“童儿，快去换茶来，一厢作速办斋。”那小童走将进去，众女子招呼他来道：“这里有现成好茶，拿出去。”那童子果然将五锺茶拿出。道士连忙双手拿一个红枣儿茶锺奉与唐僧。他见八戒身躯大，就认做大徒弟，沙僧认做二徒弟，见行者身量小，认做三徒弟，所以第四锺才奉与行者。行者眼乖，接了茶锺，早已见盘子里那茶锺是两个黑枣儿，他道：“先生，我与你穿换一杯。”道士笑道：“不瞒长老说，山野中贫道士，茶果一时不备。才然在后面亲自寻果子，止有这十二个红枣，做四锺茶奉敬。小道又不可空陪，所以将两个下色枣儿作一杯奉陪，此乃贫道恭敬之意也。”行者笑道：“说那里话？古人云，在家不是贫，路上贫杀人。</p>

<p>你是住家儿的，何以言贫！象我们这行脚僧，才是真贫哩。我和你换换，我和你换换。”三藏闻言道：“悟空，这仙长实乃爱客之意，你吃了罢，换怎的？”行者无奈，将左手接了，右手盖住，看着他们。</p>

<p>却说那八戒，一则饥，二则渴，原来是食肠大大的，见那锺子里有三个红枣儿，拿起来锺的都咽在肚里。师父也吃了，沙僧也吃了。一霎时，只见八戒脸上变色，沙僧满眼流泪，唐僧口中吐沫，他们都坐不住，晕倒在地。这大圣情知是毒，将茶锺手举起来，望道士劈脸一掼。道士将袍袖隔起，当的一声，把个锺子跌得粉碎。道士怒道：“你这和尚，十分村卤！怎么把我锺子碎了？”行者骂道：“你这畜生！你看我那三个人是怎么说！我与你有甚相干，你却将毒药茶药倒我的人？”道士道：“你这个村畜生，闯下祸来，你岂不知？”行者道：“我们才进你门，方叙了坐次，道及乡贯，又不曾有个高言，那里闯下甚祸？”道士道：</p>

<p>“你可曾在盘丝洞化斋么？你可曾在濯垢泉洗澡么？”行者道：</p>

<p>“濯垢泉乃七个女怪。你既说出这话，必定与他苟合，必定也是妖精！不要走！吃我一棒！”好大圣，去耳朵里摸出金箍棒，幌一幌，碗来粗细，望道士劈脸打来。那道士急转身躲过，取一口宝剑来迎。他两个厮骂厮打，早惊动那里边的女怪。他七个一拥出来，叫道：“师兄且莫劳心，待小妹子拿他。”行者见了越生嗔怒，双手轮铁棒，丢开解数，滚将进去乱打。只见那七个敞开怀，腆着雪白肚子，脐孔中作出法来：骨都都丝绳乱冒，搭起一个天篷，把行者盖在底下。行者见事不谐，即翻身念声咒语，打个筋斗，扑的撞破天篷走了，忍着性气，淤淤的立在空中看处，见那怪丝绳幌亮，穿穿道道，却是穿梭的经纬，顷刻间，把黄花观的楼台殿阁都遮得无影无形。行者道：“利害！利害！早是不曾着他手！怪道猪八戒跌了若干！似这般怎生是好！我师父与师弟却又中了毒药。这伙怪合意同心，却不知是个甚来历，待我还去问那土地神也。”</p>

<p>好大圣，按落云头，捻着诀，念声“唵”字真言，把个土地老儿又拘来了，战兢兢跪下路旁叩头道：“大圣，你去救你师父的，为何又转来也？”行者道：“早间救了师父，前去不远，遇一座黄花观。我与师父等进去看看，那观主迎接。才叙话间，被他把毒药茶药倒我师父等。我幸不曾吃茶，使棒就打，他却说出盘丝洞化斋、濯垢泉洗澡之事，我就知那厮是怪。才举手相敌，只见那七个女子跑出，吐放丝绳，老孙亏有见识走了。我想你在此间为神，定知他的来历。是个甚么妖精，老实说来，免打！”土地叩头道：“那妖精到此，住不上十年。小神自三年前检点之后，方见他的本相，乃是七个蜘蛛精。他吐那些丝绳，乃是蛛丝。”行者闻言，十分欢喜道：“据你说，却是小可。既这般，你回去，等我作法降他也。”那土地叩头而去。行者却到黄花观外，将尾巴上毛捋下七十根，吹口仙气，叫“变！”即变做七十个小行者；又将金箍棒吹口仙气，叫“变！”即变做七十个双角叉儿棒。每一个小行者，与他一根。他自家使一根，站在外边，将叉儿搅那丝绳，一齐着力，打个号子，把那丝绳都搅断，各搅了有十余斤。里面拖出七个蜘蛛，足有巴斗大的身躯，一个个攒着手脚，索着头，只叫：“饶命！饶命！”此时七十个小行者，按住七个蜘蛛，那里肯放。行者道：“且不要打他，只教还我师父师弟来。”那怪厉声高叫道：“师兄，还他唐僧，救我命也！”那道士从里边跑出道：“妹妹，我要吃唐僧哩，救不得你了。”行者闻言，大怒道：“你既不还我师父，且看你妹妹的样子！”好大圣，把叉儿棒幌一幌，复了一根铁棒，双手举起，把七个蜘蛛精，尽情打烂，却似七个劖肉布袋儿，脓血淋淋，却又将尾巴摇了两摇，收了毫毛，单身轮棒，赶入里边来打道士。</p>

<p>那道士见他打死了师妹，心甚不忍，即发狠举剑来迎。这一场各怀忿怒，一个个大展神通，这一场好杀：妖精轮宝剑，大圣举金箍。都为唐朝三藏，先教七女呜呼。如今大展经纶手，施威弄法逞金吾，大圣神光壮，妖仙胆气粗。浑身解数如花锦，双手腾那似辘轳。乒乓剑棒响。惨淡野云浮。劖言语，使机谋，一来一往如画图。杀得风响沙飞狼虎怕，天昏地暗斗星无。那道士与大圣战经五六十合，渐觉手软，一时间松了筋节，便解开衣带，忽辣的响一声，脱了皂袍。行者笑道：“我儿子！打不过人，就脱剥了也是不能彀的！”原来这道士剥了衣裳，把手一齐抬起，只见那两胁下有一千只眼，眼中迸放金光，十分利害：</p>

<p>森森黄雾，艳艳金光，森森黄雾，两边胁下似喷云；艳艳金光，千只眼中如放火。左右却如金桶，东西犹似铜钟。此乃妖仙施法力，道士显神通，幌眼迷天遮日月，罩人爆燥气朦胧；把个齐天孙大圣，困在金光黄雾中。行者慌了手脚，只在那金光影里乱转，向前不能举步，退后不能动脚，却便似在个桶里转的一般。无奈又爆燥不过，他急了，往上着实一跳，却撞破金光，扑的跌了一个倒栽葱，觉道撞的头疼，急伸头摸摸，把顶梁皮都撞软了，自家心焦道：“晦气！晦气！这颗头今日也不济了！常时刀砍斧剁，莫能伤损，却怎么被这金光撞软了皮肉？久以后定要贡脓，纵然好了，也是个破伤风。”一会家爆燥难禁，却又自家计较道：“前去不得，后退不得，左行不得，右行不得，往上又撞不得，却怎么好？往下走他娘罢！”</p>

<p>好大圣，念个咒语，摇身一变，变做个穿山甲，又名鲮鲤鳞。真个是：四只铁爪，钻山碎石如挝粉；满身鳞甲，破岭穿岩似切葱。两眼光明，好便似双星幌亮；一嘴尖利，胜强如钢钻金锥。药中有性穿山甲，俗语呼为鲮鲤鳞。你看他硬着头，往地下一钻，就钻了有二十余里，方才出头。原来那金光只罩得十余里。出来现了本相，力软筋麻，浑身疼痛，止不住眼中流泪，忽失声叫道：“师父啊！当年秉教出山中，共往西来苦用工。大海洪波无恐惧，阳沟之内却遭风！”</p>

<p>美猴王正当悲切，忽听得山背后有人啼哭，即欠身揩了眼泪，回头观看。但见一个妇人，身穿重孝，左手托一盏凉浆水饭，右手执几张烧纸黄钱，从那厢一步一声哭着走来。行者点头嗟叹道：“正是流泪眼逢流泪眼，断肠人遇断肠人！这一个妇人，不知所哭何事，待我问他一问。”那妇人不一时走上路来，迎着行者。行者躬身问道：“女菩萨，你哭的是甚人？”妇人噙泪道：“我丈夫因与黄花观观主买竹竿争讲，被他将毒药茶药死，我将这陌纸钱烧化，以报夫妇之情。”行者听言，眼中泪下。那妇女见了作怒道：“你甚无知！我为丈夫烦恼生悲，你怎么泪眼愁眉，欺心戏我？”行者躬身道：“女菩萨息怒，我本是东土大唐钦差御弟唐三藏大徒弟孙悟空行者。因往西天，行过黄花观歇马。那观中道士，不知是个甚么妖精，他与七个蜘蛛精，结为兄妹。蜘蛛精在盘丝洞要害我师父，是我与师弟八戒、沙僧救解得脱。那蜘蛛精走到他这里，背了是非，说我等有欺骗之意。道士将毒药茶药倒我师父师弟共三人，连马四口，陷在他观里。</p>

<p>惟我不曾吃他茶，将茶锺掼碎，他就与我相打。正嚷时，那七个蜘蛛精跑出来吐放丝绳，将我捆住，是我使法力走脱。问及土地，说他本相，我却又使分身法搅绝丝绳，拖出妖来，一顿棒打死。这道士即与他报仇，举宝剑与我相斗。斗经六十回合，他败了阵，随脱了衣裳，两胁下放出千只眼，有万道金光，把我罩定。所以进退两难，才变做一个鲮鲤鳞，从地下钻出来。正自悲切，忽听得你哭，故此相问。因见你为丈夫，有此纸钱报答，我师父丧身，更无一物相酬，所以自怨生悲，岂敢相戏！”那妇女放下水饭纸钱，对行者陪礼道：“莫怪，莫怪，我不知你是被难者。才据你说将起来，你不认得那道士。他本是个百眼魔君，又唤做多目怪。你既然有此变化，脱得金光，战得许久，必定有大神通，却只是还近不得那厮。我教你去请一位圣贤，他能破得金光，降得道士。”行者闻言，连忙唱喏道：“女菩萨知此来历，烦为指教指教。果是那位圣贤，我去请求，救我师父之难，就报你丈夫之仇。”妇人道：“我就说出来，你去请他，降了道士，只可报仇而已，恐不能救你师父。”行者道：“怎不能救？”妇人道：“那厮毒药最狠：药倒人，三日之间，骨髓俱烂。你此往回恐迟了，故不能救。”行者道：“我会走路；凭他多远，千里只消半日。”女子道：“你既会走路，听我说：此处到那里有千里之遥。那厢有一座山，名唤紫云山，山中有个千花洞。洞里有位圣贤，唤做毗蓝婆。他能降得此怪。”行者道：“那山坐落何方？</p>

<p>却从何方去？”女子用手指定道：“那直南上便是。”行者回头看时，那女子早不见了。行者慌忙礼拜道：“是那位菩萨？我弟子钻昏了，不能相识，千乞留名，好谢！”只见那半空中叫道：“大圣，是我。”行者急抬头看处，原是黎山老姆，赶至空中谢道：</p>

<p>“老姆从何来指教我也？”老姆道：“我才自龙华会上回来，见你师父有难，假做孝妇，借夫丧之名，免他一死。你快去请他，但不可说出是我指教，那圣贤有些多怪人。”</p>

<p>行者谢了，辞别，把筋斗云一纵，随到紫云山上，按定云头，就见那千花洞。那洞外：青松遮胜境，翠柏绕仙居。绿柳盈山道，奇花满涧渠。香兰围石屋，芳草映岩嵎。流水连溪碧，云封古树虚。野禽声聒聒，幽鹿步徐徐。修竹枝枝秀，红梅叶叶舒。寒鸦栖古树，春鸟嗓高樗。夏麦盈田广，秋禾遍地余。四时无叶落，八节有花如。每生瑞霭连霄汉，常放祥云接太虚。这大圣喜喜欢欢走将进去，一程一节，看不尽天边的景致。直入里面，更没个人儿，见静静悄悄的，鸡犬之声也无，心中暗道：</p>

<p>“这圣贤想是不在家了。”又进数里看时，见一个女道姑坐在榻上。你看他怎生模样：头戴五花纳锦帽，身穿一领织金袍。脚踏云尖凤头履，腰系攒丝双穗绦。面似秋容霜后老，声如春燕社前娇。腹中久谙三乘法，心上常修四谛饶。悟出空空真正果，炼成了了自逍遥。正是千花洞里佛，毗蓝菩萨姓名高。行者止不住脚，近前叫道：“毗蓝婆菩萨，问讯了。”那菩萨即下榻，合掌回礼道：“大圣，失迎了，你从那里来的？”行者道：“你怎么就认得我是大圣？”毗蓝婆道：“你当年大闹天宫时，普地里传了你的形象，谁人不知，那个不识？”行者道：“正是好事不出门，恶事传千里，象我如今皈正佛门，你就不晓的了！”毗蓝道：“几时皈正？恭喜！恭喜！”行者道：“近能脱命，保师父唐僧上西天取经，师父遇黄花观道士，将毒药茶药倒。我与那厮赌斗，他就放金光罩住我，是我使神通走脱了。闻菩萨能灭他的金光，特来拜请。”菩萨道：“是谁与你说的？我自赴了盂兰会，到今三百余年，不曾出门。我隐姓埋名，更无一人知得，你却怎么得知？”</p>

<p>行者道：“我是个地里鬼，不管那里，自家都会访着。”毗蓝道：</p>

<p>“也罢也罢，我本当不去，奈蒙大圣下临，不可灭了求经之善，我和你去来。”行者称谢了，道：“我忒无知，擅自催促，但不知曾带甚么兵器。”菩萨道：“我有个绣花针儿，能破那厮。”行者忍不住道：“老姆误了我，早知是绣花针，不须劳你，就问老孙要一担也是有的。”毗蓝道：“你那绣花针，无非是钢铁金针，用不得。我这宝贝，非钢，非铁，非金，乃我小儿日眼里炼成的。”</p>

<p>行者道：“令郎是谁？”毗蓝道：“小儿乃昴日星官。”行者惊骇不已。早望见金光艳艳，即回向毗蓝道：“金光处便是黄花观也。”</p>

<p>毗蓝随于衣领里取出一个绣花针，似眉毛粗细，有五六分长短，拈在手，望空抛去。少时间，响一声，破了金光。行者喜道：</p>

<p>“菩萨，妙哉妙哉！寻针寻针！”毗蓝托在手掌内道：“这不是？”</p>

<p>行者却同按下云头，走入观里，只见那道士合了眼，不能举步。</p>

<p>行者骂道：“你这泼怪装瞎子哩！”耳朵里取出棒来就打。毗蓝扯住道：“大圣莫打，且看你师父去。”行者径至后面客位里看时，他三人都睡在地上吐痰吐沫哩。行者垂泪道：“却怎么好！</p>

<p>却怎么好”！毗蓝道：“大圣休悲，也是我今日出门一场，索性积个阴德，我这里有解毒丹，送你三丸。”行者转身拜求。那菩萨袖中取出一个破纸包儿，内将三粒红丸子递与行者，教放入口里。行者把药扳开他们牙关，每人揌了一丸。须臾，药味入腹，便就一齐呕哕，遂吐出毒味，得了性命。那八戒先爬起道：“闷杀我也！”三藏沙僧俱醒了道：“好晕也！”行者道：“你们那茶里中了毒了，亏这毗蓝菩萨搭救，快都来拜谢。”三藏欠身整衣谢了。八戒道：“师兄，那道士在那里？等我问他一问，为何这般害我！”行者把蜘蛛精上项事说了一遍，八戒发狠道：“这厮既与蜘蛛为姊妹，定是妖精！”行者指道：“他在那殿外立定装瞎子哩。”八戒拿钯就筑，又被毗蓝止住道：“天蓬息怒，大圣知我洞里无人，待我收他去看守门户也。”行者道：“感蒙大德，岂不奉承！但只是教他现本象，我们看看。”毗蓝道：“容易。”即上前用手一指，那道士扑的倒在尘埃，现了原身，乃是一条七尺长短的大蜈蚣精。毗蓝使小指头挑起，驾祥云径转千花洞去。八戒打仰道：“这妈妈儿却也利害，怎么就降这般恶物？”行者笑道：“我问他有甚兵器破他金光，他道有个绣花针儿，是他儿子在日眼里炼的。及问他令郎是谁，他道是昴日星官。我想昴日星是只公鸡，这老妈妈子必定是个母鸡。鸡最能降蜈蚣，所以能收伏也。”三藏闻言顶礼不尽，教：“徒弟们，收拾去罢。”那沙僧即在里面寻了些米粮，安排了些斋，俱饱餐一顿。牵马挑担，请师父出门。行者从他厨中放了一把火，把一座观霎时烧得煨烬，却拽步长行。正是，唐僧得命感毗蓝，了性消除多目怪。毕竟向前去还有甚么事体，且听下回分解。</p>
