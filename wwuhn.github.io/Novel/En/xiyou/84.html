<P>The Mind-Ape Recognizes the Refiner of Cinnabar</P>
<P>The Girl Reverts to Her True Nature</P>
</div>
<P>The story tells how after Sanzang had been carried out of the cave by the evil spirit Friar Sand went up to him and asked, &#8220;Where is my oldest brother now that you have come out, Master?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He must know what he's doing,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;I expect he's exchanged himself for the master to get him out.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your brother is in her stomach,&#8221; Sanzang replied, pointing at the evil spirit.</P>
<P>&#8220;It is terribly filthy,&#8221; Pig said. &#8220;Whatever are you doing in there? Come out.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Open your mouth,&#8221; said Monkey from inside, &#8220;I'm coming out.&#8221; The she-devil did indeed open her mouth wide. Monkey made himself very small, sprang up into her throat, and was just about to emerge when he became worried that she might cheat and bite him. He then pulled out his iron cudgel, blew on it with magic breath, called &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned it into a jujube stone with which he wedged her jaw open. With one bound he then leapt outside, taking the iron cudgel with him, bowed to resume his own form and raised his cudgel to strike her. At once she drew a pair of fine swords, parrying his blow with a loud clang. They fought a splendid battle on the mountain top.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A pair of dancing, flying swords defended her face;</P>
<P>The gold-banded cudgel struck at her head.</P>
<P>One was a heaven-born monkey, the Mind-ape;</P>
<P>The other had the bones of an earth-born girl turned spirit;</P>
<P>The two of them both had been smitten by anger:</P>
<P>Hatred arose at the celebration; the party was ended.</P>
<P>One longed to mate with the primal masculinity,</P>
<P>The other wanted to defeat the incarnation of the female.</P>
<P>When the cudgel was raised to the sky cold mists spread out;</P>
<P>The swords shook up the earth's black dirt like a sieve.</P>
<P>Because the elder would visit the Buddha</P>
<P>They were locked in fierce combat, each showing great prowess.</P>
<P>When water conflicts with fire motherhood is out;</P>
<P>When Yin and Yang cannot combine each goes its own way.</P>
<P>After the two had been fighting for a very long time</P>
<P>The earth moved, the mountains shook and the trees were destroyed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The sight of their struggle made Pig grumble resentfully about Monkey. &#8220;Brother,&#8221; he said, turning to Friar Sand, &#8220;our elder brother is messing around. When he was in her stomach just now he could have used his fists to make her belly red with blood, rip it open and come out. That would have settled her score. Why did he have to come out through her mouth and fight her? Why did he let her run wild?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right,&#8221; Friar Sand replied, &#8220;but it was thanks to him that the master was rescued from the depths of the cave, even if he is in a fight with her now. Let's ask the master to sit here by himself while we two use our weapons to help our brother beat the evil spirit.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; said Pig with a wave of his hand. &#8220;He's got his magic powers. We'd be useless.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a thing to say,&#8221; retorted Friar Sand. &#8220;This is in all of our interests. We may not be much use, but even a fart can strengthen a breeze.&#8221;</P>
<P>Now that the idiot's dander was up he brandished his rake and shouted, &#8220;Come on!&#8221; Ignoring the master, they rode the wind and went for the evil spirit, striking wildly at her with their rake and staff. The evil spirit, who was already finding Brother Monkey too much to handle, realized that she would be unable to hold out against two more of them. At once she turned and fled.</P>
<P>&#8220;After her, brothers,&#8221; Monkey shouted. Seeing that they were so hot on her heels the evil spirit took the embroidered shoe off her right foot, blew on it with a magic breath, said a spell, called &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned it into her own double swinging a pair of sword. Then she shook herself, turned into a puff of wind and went straight back. There she was, fleeing for her life because she was no match for them. What happened next was quite unexpected: Sanzang's evil star had still not gone away. As the evil spirit reached the archway in front of the entrance to the cave she saw the Tang Priest sitting there by himself, so she went up to him, threw her arm round him, grabbed the luggage, bit through the bridle, and carried him back inside, horse and all.</P>
<P>The story tells not of her but of Pig, who exploited an opening to fell the evil spirit with one blow of his rake, only to find that she was really an embroidered shoe.</P>
<P>&#8220;You pair of idiots,&#8221; said Monkey when he saw it. &#8220;You should have been looking after the master. Nobody asked you to help.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What about that, then, Friar Sand?&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;I said we shouldn't come here. That ape has had a brainstorm. We beat the monster for him and he gets angry with us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Beaten the monster indeed!&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;The monster fooled me yesterday by leaving a shoe behind when I was fighting her. Goodness knows how the master is now that you've left him. Let's go straight back and see.&#8221;</P>
<P>The three of them hurried back to find that the master had disappeared: there was no sign at all of him, the luggage or the white horse. Pig started rushing all over the place in a panic with Friar Sand searching alongside him. The Great Sage Sun was also most anxious. As he searched he noticed half of the bridle rope lying askew beside the path.</P>
<P>Picking it up, he could not hold back his tears as he called in a loud voice, &#8220;Master! When I went I took my leave of you three and the horse, and all I find on my return is this rope.&#8221; It was indeed a case of</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Being reminded of the steed by seeing the saddle,</P>
<P>Missing the beloved amid one's tears.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The sight of Monkey's tears gave Pig an uncontrollable urge to throw back his head and laugh out loud. &#8220;Blockhead,&#8221; said Monkey abusively. &#8220;Do you want us to break up again?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's not what I mean,&#8221; said Pig, still laughing. &#8220;The master's been carried back into the cave. As the saying goes, 'third time lucky'. You've already been into the cave twice, so if you go in again you're sure to rescue the master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well then,&#8221; said Monkey, wiping away his tears, &#8220;as this is the way things are I have no choice. I'll have to go back in. You two don't have to worry about the luggage or the horse any more, so guard the cave-mouth properly.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage turned round and sprang into the cave. This time he did no transformations but appeared in his own dharma form. This is what he was like:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>His cheeks looked strange but his heart was strong;</P>
<P>As a monster since childhood his magic was mighty.</P>
<P>A misshapen face that looked like a saddle;</P>
<P>Eyes fiery bright with golden light.</P>
<P>His hairs were harder than needles of steel,</P>
<P>And striking was the pattern of his tigerskin kilt.</P>
<P>In the sky he could scatter a myriad clouds;</P>
<P>In the sea he could stir up thousandfold waves.</P>
<P>Once with his strength he fought heavenly kings,</P>
<P>Putting a hundred and eight thousand warriors to flight.</P>
<P>His title was Great Sage Equaling Heaven;</P>
<P>He was an expert with the gold-banded cudgel.</P>
<P>Today in the West he was using his powers</P>
<P>To return to the cave and rescue Sanzang.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Watch Monkey as he stops his cloud and heads straight for the evil spirit's residence, where he found the gates under the gate towers shut. Not caring whether or not it was the right thing to do, he smashed them open with one swing of his cudgel and charged inside. It was completely quiet and deserted, and the Tang Priest was nowhere to be seen in the corridor. The tables and chairs in the pavilion and all the utensils had completely disappeared. As the cave measured over a hundred miles around, the evil spirit had very many hiding places in it. This was where she had brought the Tang Priest the previous time, only to be found by Monkey, so after catching him this time she had moved him elsewhere in case Monkey came looking for him again.</P>
<P>Not knowing where they had gone, Monkey stamped his foot and beat his chest with fury, letting himself call out at the top of his voice, &#8220;Master! You are a Tang Sanzang formed in misfortune, a pilgrim monk molded from disaster. Hmm. I know the way well enough. Why isn't he here? Where should I look for him?&#8221;</P>
<P>Just when he was howling with impatience and anxiety his nose was struck by a whiff of incense, which brought him back to himself. &#8220;This incense smoke is coming from the back,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;so I suppose they must be there.&#8221; He strode in at the back, his cudgel in his hand, but still saw no sign of life. What he did see were three side rooms. Near the back wall was a lacquered offertory table carved with dragons on which stood a gilt incense-burner. From this came heavily scented incense smoke. On the table was a tablet inscribed with letters of gold to which the offerings were being made. The letters read, &#8220;Honoured Father, Heavenly King Li.&#8221; In a slightly inferior position was written, &#8220;Honoured Elder Brother, Third Prince Nezha.&#8221;</P>
<P>The sight filled Monkey with delight. He stopped searching for the monster and the Tang Priest, rubbed his cudgel between his fingers to make it as small as an embroidery needle, tucked it inside his ear, gathered up the tablet and the incense-burner with a sweep of his arms and went straight back out through the gates on his clouds. He was still chortling with glee when he reached the mouth of the cave.</P>
<P>When Pig and Friar Sand heard him they unblocked the entrance to the cave and greeted him with, &#8220;You look so happy you must have saved the master, elder brother.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No need for us to save him,&#8221; Monkey replied with a smile. &#8220;We can ask this tablet for him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But that tablet isn't an evil spirit and it can't talk,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;so how can you ask it for him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Look at it,&#8221; said Monkey, putting the tablet on the ground. When Friar Sand went up to look he saw &#8220;Honoured Father, Heavenly King Li&quot; and &#8220;Honoured Elder Brother, Third Prince Nezha&#8221; written on it.</P>
<P>&#8220;What does this mean?&#8221; Friar Sand asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The evil spirit makes offerings to it,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;When I charged into her place there was nobody about, only this tablet. I think she must be a daughter of Heavenly King Li and the younger sister of Prince Nezha who so longed for the lower world that she pretended to be an evil spirit and carried our master off. So who better to demand the master from? You two keep guard here while I take this tablet up to Heaven to lodge a complaint with the Jade Emperor and force those heavenly kings to give our master back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;there's a saying that goes, 'Bring a capital charge and pay for it with your own head.' You can only do a thing like that if you're in the right. Besides, a case in the celestial court isn't something to be started lightly. You'd better tell me what sort of case you're going to bring.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I know what I'm going to do,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;I'm going to produce this tablet and incense-burner as evidence and submit a written deposition too.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What will you write in your deposition?&#8221; Pig asked him. &#8220;Will you tell me?&#8221;</P>
<P>To this Brother Monkey replied, &#8220;The complainant Sun Wukong, whose age is stated in this document, is the disciple of the monk Tang Sanzang who is going from the Tang court in the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven. He submits a complaint that an imitation evil spirit has committed a kidnap. Li Jing, the Pagoda-carrying Heavenly King, and his son Prince Nezha have been slack in controlling their women's quarters. He has allowed his daughter to run away and turn into an evil spirit in the Bottomless Cave in Mount Pitfall, where she has lured countless deluded people to their deaths. She has now carried my master into a remote corner where he cannot be found. If I had not submitted this complaint I would have been deeply worried that the heavenly king and his son in their wickedness had deliberately incited his daughter to become a spirit and cause general disaster. I beg Your Majesty in your mercy to summon the heavenly king to attend a hearing, bring the demon under control and deliver my master. I would be deeply grateful if Your Majesty would determine the correct penalty for this offence. This is my respectful submission.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Pig and Friar Sand heard this they said with delight, &#8220;Brother, you're bound to win if you submit so reasonable a complaint. Be as quick as you can. If you lose any time you may be too late to stop the evil spirit killing our master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll hurry,&#8221; said Brother Monkey, &#8220;I'll hurry. I'll be back in the time it takes to cook rice at the longest or to make a cup of tea if I'm quick.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>With one bound the splendid Great Sage carried the tablet and the incense-burner straight up by auspicious cloud to the outside of the Southern Gate of Heaven, where the Heavenly Kings Powerful and Protector of the Nation greeted him with bows, letting him in and not daring to block his way.</P>
<P>He went straight to the Hall of Universal Radiance, where the four heavenly teachers Zhang, Ge, Xu, and Qiu showed him great courtesy and asked, &#8220;Why are you here, Great Sage?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've got a complaint here,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;There are a couple of people I want to lodge a complaint against.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The scoundrel,&#8221; thought the appalled heavenly teachers, &#8220;who can he be wanting to sue?&#8221; They had no choice but to lead him to the Hall of Miraculous Mist and submit their report to the Jade Emperor, who ordered that Monkey be summoned hi. Monkey then put down the tablet and the incense-burner, bowed to the emperor, and presented his complaint. This was taken by the Ancient Immortal Ge, who spread it out on the emperor's table. When the emperor had read it through from the beginning and learned what had happened he approved the deposition, wrote an imperial rescript on it, and sent the Great White Planet, the Metal Planet Changgeng, to the Cloud Tower Palace to summon the Pagoda-carrying Heavenly King Li to the imperial presence.</P>
<P>Monkey then stepped forward and submitted this memorial: &#8220;I beg that the Heavenly Sovereign will punish him effectively as otherwise there will be further trouble.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Let the complainant go too,&#8221; the Jade Emperor ordered.</P>
<P>&#8220;What, me?&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;His Majesty has issued his decree,&#8221; said the Four Heavenly Teachers, &#8220;so you go with the Metal Planet.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey then went with the planet by cloud. They were soon at the Cloud Tower Palace, the residence of the heavenly king. The Metal Star saw a page standing at the palace gates.</P>
<P>Recognizing the planet, the boy went inside to report, &#8220;The Great White Planet is here.&#8221;</P>
<P>The heavenly king then came out to welcome the planet. Seeing that the planet was carrying a decree from the Jade Emperor, the heavenly king ordered incense to be burned before turning round and seeing to his fury that Monkey had come too. Why do you think he was furious? When Monkey had made great havoc in heaven all those years earlier the Jade Emperor had appointed the heavenly king as Demon-quelling High Marshal and Prince Nezha as Great God of the Three Altars of the Seas to lead the heavenly troops and subdue Monkey. They had been repeatedly worsted in battle. It was resentment at this defeat five hundred years earlier that goaded him to fury.</P>
<P>&#8220;Old Changgeng,&#8221; he said to the planet, showing his irritation, &#8220;what kind of decree have you brought here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It is a case that the Great Sage Sun has brought against you,&#8221; the planet replied.</P>
<P>The heavenly king had been in a bad enough temper before this, but the word &#8220;case&#8221; provoked a thunderous outburst of fury: &#8220;What case has he got against me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He accuses you of masquerading as an evil spirit and kidnapping,&#8221; the planet said. &#8220;Will you please burn incense and read it for yourself.&#8221;</P>
<P>Seething with anger, the heavenly king had an incense table set up, looked into the sky as he thanked the emperor for his grace, made his obeisances, opened out the decree and read it through.</P>
<P>When he saw what it contained he thumped the incense table and exclaimed, &#8220;That ape has trumped up a pack of lies.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please keep your temper,&#8221; the planet replied. &#8220;A tablet and an incense-burner have been submitted to His Majesty as evidence. He says it was your daughter who did it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;All I have are my three sons and a single daughter,&#8221; said the heavenly king. &#8220;My elder son Jinzha serves the Tathagata Buddha as a Vanguard Guardian of the Law Dharma. My second son Moksa is a disciple of Guanyin in the Southern Ocean. My third son Nezha stays with me as my escort at all times. My daughter Zhenying is only six and an innocent child. She could not possibly have become an evil spirit. If you don't believe me I'll carry her out to show you. This ape is really a disgrace. Never mind that I'm one of the most distinguished elder statesmen in heaven and been given the authority to cut heads off before reporting to the throne: not even an ordinary commoner in the lower world should be falsely accused. As the Legal Code says, 'the penalty for false accusation is three grades higher than the crime alleged.'&#8221;</P>
<P>He then ordered his underlings to fetch demon-binding rope and tie Monkey up. The Mighty Miracle God, General Fishbelly and General Yaksha who were drawn up outside the court rushed on Monkey and tied him up.</P>
<P>&#8220;Heavenly King Li,&#8221; the Metal Planet pleaded, &#8220;please don't invite disaster. I have come here with him from the imperial presence under orders from His Majesty to summon you. That rope of yours is heavy, and it could very quickly hurt him badly or strangle him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Metal Star,&#8221; the heavenly king replies, &#8220;there's no way I'm going to stand for his false, trumped-up charge. Won't you take a seat while I fetch my demon-hacking sword to kill this ape with? I'll report to His Majesty with you after I've done that.&#8221; At the sight of the heavenly king fetching the sword the planet trembled with terror.</P>
<P>&#8220;You've made a terrible mistake,&#8221; he said to Monkey. &#8220;A case before the emperor isn't to be lightly started. You've brought this disaster on yourself by not finding the facts out properly and you'll die for it. This is terrible.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey was completely unafraid. &#8220;Don't worry, old man,&#8221; he said with a chuckle, &#8220;this is nothing. This has always been my way of doing business: I lose out at first and win in the end.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before the words were all out of his mouth the heavenly king's sword swung down towards Monkey's head. But Prince Nezha was already in front of Monkey, parrying the blow with his great sword used for cutting men in half at the waist and calling, &#8220;Please calm your temper, father.&#8221;</P>
<P>This greatly shocked the heavenly king. Very strange! If a son used his broadsword to block his father's cutlass he ought to be bawled out, so why did Nezha's father turn pale with shock?</P>
<P>Now when this son had been born to the heavenly king the word<I> Ne</I> was written on the palm of his left hand and<I> Zha</I> on his right one, which was why he was called Nezha. When only three days old the young prince had caused great trouble by plunging into the sea to clean himself. He had kicked the water crystal palace down, captured a dragon and insisted on pulling its sinews out to make a belt. On learning about this, the heavenly king had been so worried about the disastrous consequences that he had decided to kill the boy.</P>
<P>This had made Nezha so indignant that he had seized a sword, cut off his flesh and returned it to his mother, then picked his bones clean and given them back to his father. Having returned his father's seed and his mother's blood he had taken his soul straight off to the Western Paradise to appeal to the Buddha. When the Buddha, who was expounding the sutras to all the Bodhisattvas, heard a call of &#8220;Help!&#8221; from within his curtained and jeweled canopy he had looked with his wise eyes and seen that it was Nezha's soul. He had made Nezha bones out of green lotus root and clothes from lotus leaves, then recited the spell to revive the dead.</P>
<P>Thus it was that Nezha had come back to life. He had used his divine ability and great magical powers to subdue ninety-six caves of demons through dharma. After this Nezha had wanted to kill his father in revenge for having had to pick the flesh off his own bones, leaving the heavenly king with no choice but to beg the help of the Tathagata Buddha. For the sake of harmony the Buddha had given the heavenly king an intricately-made golden As-You-Will reliquary pagoda, in each story of which were Buddhas radiant with splendor. The Buddha called on Nezha to regard these Buddhas as his father, thereby ending the hatred between them. This is why Heavenly King Li is called the Pagoda-bearer. As the heavenly king was at home off duty that day and not carrying the pagoda he was afraid that Nezha was set on revenge. This was why he turned pale with terror.</P>
<P>So he turned his hand back to take the golden pagoda from its stand and hold it as he asked Nezha, &#8220;What do you want to say to me, son? Why have you parried my sword with your broadsword?&#8221;</P>
<P>Throwing his broadsword down, Nezha kowtowed to his father as he replied, &#8220;Father, Your Majesty, there is a daughter of our family in the lower world.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My boy,&#8221; the heavenly king replied, &#8220;I have only had you four children. Where could I have got another daughter from?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You have forgotten, Your Majesty,&#8221; Nezha replied. &#8220;The girl was once an evil spirit. Three hundred years ago she became a monster. She stole and ate some of the Tathagata's incense, flowers and candles on Vulture Peak, and the Tathagata sent us to capture her with heavenly soldiers. When she was caught she should have been beaten to death, but the Tathagata said,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>'Raise fish in deep water but never catch them;</P>
<P>Feed deer in the depths of the mountains in the hope of eternal life.'</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>So we spared her life. In her gratitude she bowed to you as her adoptive father, Your Majesty, and to me as her elder brother. She set up a tablet to us in the lower world to burn incense. I never imagined she'd become an evil spirit again and try to ruin the Tang Priest. Now Sun the Novice has trailed her to her den and brought the tablet up here to use in a case against us before the Jade Emperor. She is your adopted daughter, not my real sister.&#8221;</P>
<P>This came as a terrible shock to the heavenly king. &#8220;Son,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I really had forgotten. What's she called?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;She has three names,&#8221; the prince replied. Where she originally came from she was called Gold-nosed White-haired Mouse Spirit. Then she was called Half-Bodhisattva-Guanyin because she had stolen the incense, flowers and candles. When she was forgiven and sent down to the lower world she changed her name again and became Lady Earth-gusher.&#8221; Only then did the heavenly king come to his senses. He put his pagoda down and started to untie Monkey himself. At this Monkey started playing it up.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't you dare try to untie me!&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you want to do something you can carry me roped up as I am to see the emperor. Then I'll win my case.&#8221; The heavenly king felt weak from terror and the prince could say nothing. Everybody fell back.</P>
<P>The Great Sage meanwhile was rolling about and playing it up, insisting that the heavenly king take him to the emperor. The heavenly king could do nothing except beg the Metal Planet to put in a good word for him.</P>
<P>&#8220;There is an old saying,&#8221; the planet replied, &#8220;that one should always be lenient. You went too far: you tied him up and were going to kill him. The monkey is a notorious trouble-maker. How do you expect me to deal with him? From what your worthy son has said, she is your daughter, even though adopted rather than your own, and a child by adoption is especially dear. However one argues it you are guilty.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Surely you can find some way of putting in a good word for me and helping me off the hook, venerable planet,&#8221; said the heavenly king.</P>
<P>&#8220;I would like to end the quarrel between you,&#8221; the planet replied, &#8220;but I have never done him a good turn that I can remind him of.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Tell him how it was you who proposed that he should be amnestied and given an official post,&#8221; said the heavenly king.</P>
<P>The Metal Planet did then step forward, stroke Brother Monkey and say, &#8220;Great Sage, won't you let us take the rope off before going to see the emperor, just for my sake?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No need to bother, old man,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;I'm a good roller and I can roll all the way there.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've got no decent feelings, you monkey,&#8221; said the planet with a smile. &#8220;I did you some good turns in the old days, but you won't do this little thing for me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What good turn did you ever do me?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;When you were a monster on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit you subdued tigers and dragons, forcibly removed yourself from the register of death and assembled hordes of fiends to run wild and wreak havoc. Heaven wanted to have you arrested. It was only because I made strong representations that an edict of amnesty and recruitment was issued and you were summoned to Heaven to be appointed Protector of the Horses. You drank some of the Jade Emperor's wine of immortality, and it was only because I made strong representations again that you were given the title of Great Sage Equaling Heaven. But you refused to know your place. You stole the peaches and the wine and robbed Lord Lao Zi of his elixir, and so it went on till you ended up in a state of no death and no birth. If it hadn't been for me you'd never have got where you are today.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As the ancients put it,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;'Don't even share a grave with an old man when you're dead: all he'll do is complain.' I was just a Protector of the Horses who made havoc in the heavenly palace: there was nothing much apart from that. Oh well, never mind. I'll show you a bit of consideration as you're such an old man. He can untie me himself.&#8221; Only then did the heavenly king dare step forward, untie the rope, and ask Brother Monkey to dress and take the seat of honour while they all took it in turn to pay their respects to him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Old man,&#8221; Monkey said to the Metal Planet, &#8220;what about it then? I told you I lose first and win later. That's my way of doing business. Make him hurry and see the emperor: delay could be disastrous for my master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be impatient,&#8221; the Metal Planet said. &#8220;After everything that's happened we should take a cup of tea.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you drink his tea, accept favours from him, take a bribe to let a criminal escape, and treat imperial edicts with disrespect I wonder what you'll be charged with,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;I won't stop for tea,&#8221; the Metal Planet replied, &#8220;I won't stop for tea. You're even trying to frame me. Hurry up, Heavenly King Li, we must be on our way.&#8221; The heavenly king dared not go for fear that Monkey would concoct some unfounded story and start playing it up: if Monkey started talking wildly he would be unable to argue against him. So once again the heavenly king pleaded with the Metal Planet to put in a good word for him.</P>
<P>&#8220;I have a suggestion to make,&#8221; the planet said to Monkey. &#8220;Will you follow it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've already agreed about being tied up and hacked at,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;What else have you to say? Tell me! Tell me! If it's a good idea I'll follow it; and if it isn't, don't blame me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;'Fight a lawsuit for one day and it'll go on for ten,'&#8220; said the Metal Planet. &#8220;You brought a case before the emperor saying that the evil spirit is the heavenly king's daughter and the heavenly king says she isn't. You two will argue endlessly in front of His Majesty, but I tell you that a day in heaven is a year in the lower world. In that year the evil spirit will have your master under her control in the cave, and she won't just have married him. By then there may have been a happy event and she may have had a little baby monk. Then your great enterprise will be ruined.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; thought Monkey, his head bowed, &#8220;when I left Pig and Friar Sand I said I'd be back in the time it takes to cook a meal at longest and at quickest before they could make a cup of tea. I've been ages already and it might be too late. Old man,&#8221; he said aloud, &#8220;I'll take your advice. How do we obey this imperial decree?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Have Heavenly King Li muster his troops and go down with you to subdue the demon,&#8221; the Metal Planet replied, &#8220;while I report back to the emperor.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What will you say?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll report that the plaintiff has absconded and that the defendant is therefore excused,&#8221; the planet replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;That's very fine,&#8221; said Monkey with a grin. &#8220;I show you consideration and you accuse me of absconding. Tell him to muster his troops and wait for me outside the Southern Gate of Heaven while you and I report back on our mission.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If he says anything when he's there I'll be accused of treason,&#8221; exclaimed the heavenly king with terror.</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you take me for?&#8221; asked Monkey. &#8220;I'm a real man. Once I've given my word a team of horses couldn't take it back. I'd never slander you.&#8221;</P>
<P>The heavenly king thanked Monkey, who went with the Metal Planet to report back on their mission, while the heavenly king mustered his heavenly troops and went straight to the outside of the Southern Gate of Heaven.</P>
<P>When the Metal Planet and Monkey had their audience with the Jade Emperor they said, &#8220;The person who has trapped the Tang Priest is the Golden-nosed White-haired Mouse turned spirit. She has fraudulently set up a tablet to the heavenly king and his son. As soon as he found out, the heavenly king mustered his troops to go and subdue the demon. We beg your Celestial Majesty to forgive him.&#8221;</P>
<P>Once the Jade Emperor knew what had happened he dropped the prosecution in his heavenly mercy. Monkey then went back on his cloud to the outside of the Southern Gate of Heaven, where he found the heavenly king and the prince waiting for him with their heavenly soldiers draw up on parade. The heavenly commanders met the Great Sage amid blustering winds and seething mists, then they all took their clouds straight down to Mount Pitfall.</P>
<P>Pig and Friar Sand were wide-eyed at the sight of the heavenly hosts coming down with Brother Monkey. Greeting the heavenly king with due courtesy, the idiot said, &#8220;We have put you to great trouble in coming here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't realize, Marshal Tian Peng,&#8221; the heavenly king replied, &#8220;that it was because my son and I accepted a joss-stick from her that the evil spirit in her wickedness captured your master. Please don't be angry with us for being so long. Is this Mount Pitfall? Where is the entrance to the cave?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I know the way very well by now,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;This cave is called the Bottomless Cave and it measures over a hundred miles around. The evil spirit has a great many holes in it. Last time my master was held in the gate tower with double eaves, but it's deadly quiet now. There's not even the shadow of a demon. I don't know where she's taken him to now.&#8221; To this the heavenly king replied,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;'No matter how many the tricks she may try</P>
<P>She'll never escape from the nets of the sky.'</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We'll think of something else when we get to the cave entrance.&#8221;</P>
<P>They all then started out, and after they had gone three or four miles they reached the great rock. &#8220;This is it,&#8221; Monkey said pointing at the entrance that was no larger than the mouth of a large jar.</P>
<P>&#8220;You'll never capture the tiger's cub unless you go into the tiger's lair,&#8221; observed the heavenly king. &#8220;Who dares go in first?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll go,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;No, I'll go first,&#8221; objected Prince Nezha. &#8220;I was the one the emperor ordered to capture the demon.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot then started acting tough, shouting, &#8220;It ought to be me first.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop that din,&#8221; said the heavenly king. &#8220;I'll decide. The Great Sage Sun and the prince will go down with the soldiers while we three hold the entrance. Then we'll have a coordinated action inside and outside, which will make it impossible for her to find her way up to heaven or go further underground. That will show her a bit of our powers.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; they all said in assent.</P>
<P>Watch as Monkey and Prince Nezha slip into the cave at the head of their troops. As they rode their clouds they looked around and saw that it really was a fine cave:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The pair of sun and moon as before;</P>
<P>A vista of rivers and hills like the other world.</P>
<P>Warm mists spread over pools and wells of pearl;</P>
<P>Much more there is to admire down here.</P>
<P>Crimson houses, painted halls,</P>
<P>Red cliffs, green fields,</P>
<P>Willows in the spring and lotos in the autumn;</P>
<P>A rare and splendid cave heaven.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>An instant later they brought their clouds to a halt and went straight to the mansion where the evil spirit had lived before. They went from gateway to gateway in their search, yelling and shouting as they went deeper and deeper inside, trying one place after the next. All the grass for a hundred miles was trampled away. But where was the evil spirit? Where was Sanzang?</P>
<P>&#8220;The wicked beast,&#8221; everyone was saying, &#8220;she must have got out of this cave ages ago. She'll be far away by now.&#8221; What they did not know was that down underneath a dark corner in the Southeast of the cave there was another, smaller cave, where behind a pair of tiny gates there was a tiny cottage with flowers growing in pots and a few canes of bamboo beside the eaves. The atmosphere was dark and heavy with fragrance. This was where the evil spirit had carried Sanzang and was going to force him to marry her. She was sure that Monkey would never find them; none of them realized that her union was fated to be thwarted.</P>
<P>The junior devils were jabbering away in a great crush when a bolder one among them stretched outside the cave for a look around only for her head to butt into a heavenly soldier, who shouted, &#8220;They're here!&#8221; At this Monkey flew into a rage, grasped the gold-banded cudgel and charged straight down in. The cave was tiny and all the demons from the big cave were in there, so that when Prince Nezha sent his heavenly soldiers crowding into the attack, not a single one of the demons could hide.</P>
<P>Monkey found the Tang Priest, the dragon horse and the baggage. The senior demon was at her wit's end. All she could do was to kowtow to Prince Nezha, begging him to spare her life.</P>
<P>&#8220;We are here to arrest you at the Jade Emperor's command,&#8221; Prince Nezha replied, &#8220;which is not something to be treated lightly. My father and I were nearly in terrible trouble because of you.&#8221;</P>
<P>He then shouted at the top of his voice, &#8220;Heavenly soldiers, fetch demon-binding rope. Tie all those evil spirits up.&#8221; The senior demon too had to suffer for a while. They all went back out of the cave together by cloud.</P>
<P>Monkey was chuckling with delight when the heavenly king withdrew his guard from the mouth of the cave and greeted Monkey with the words, &#8220;Now I can meet your master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Many thanks,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;many thanks,&#8221; and he led Sanzang to bow in gratitude to the heavenly king and the prince.</P>
<P>Friar Sand and Pig were all for chopping the senior devil into tiny pieces, but the heavenly king said, &#8220;She was arrested at the Jade Emperor's command, and must not be mistreated. We must go to report back on our mission.&#8221;</P>
<P>The heavenly king and Prince Nezha at the head of their heavenly troops and divine officers escorted the evil spirit as a prisoner to report to the heavenly court and receive the emperor's verdict on her. Meanwhile Brother Monkey guarded the Tang Priest while Friar Sand collected the luggage and Pig went over to the horse and invited the master to ride. Then they all set out along their way again. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The silken net had been cut, the golden sea dried up,</P>
<P>The precious lock undone, and troubles left behind.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you do not know what lay in store for them on their way ahead listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<div class="title">
<p>心猿识得丹头</p>
<p>姹女还归本性</p>
</div>
<p>却说三藏着妖精送出洞外，沙和尚近前问曰：“师父出来，师兄何在？”八戒道：“他有算计，必定贴换师父出来也。”三藏用手指着妖精道：“你师兄在他肚里哩。”八戒笑道：“腌脏杀人！在肚里做甚？出来罢！”行者在里边叫道：“张开口，等我出来！”那怪真个把口张开。行者变得小小的，睮在咽喉之内，正欲出来，又恐他无理来咬，即将铁棒取出，吹口仙气，叫“变！”</p>

<p>变作个枣核钉儿，撑住他的上腭子，把身一纵跳出口外，就把铁棒顺手带出，把腰一躬，还是原身法象，举起棒来就打。那妖精也随手取出两口宝剑，丁当架住。两个在山头上这场好杀：</p>

<p>双舞剑飞当面架，金箍棒起照头来。一个是天生猴属心猿体，一个是地产精灵姹女骸。他两个，恨冲怀，喜处生仇大会垓。那个要取元阳成配偶，这个要战纯阴结圣胎。棒举一天寒雾漫，剑迎满地黑尘筛。因长老，拜如来，恨苦相争显大才，水火不投母道损，阴阳难合各分开。两家斗罢多时节，地动山摇树木摧。</p>

<p>八戒见他们赌斗，口里絮絮叨叨，返恨行者，转身对沙僧道：</p>

<p>“兄弟，师兄胡缠！才子在他肚里，轮起拳来，送他一个满肚红，扒开肚皮钻出来，却不了帐？怎么又从他口里出来，却与他争战，让他这等猖狂！”沙僧道：“正是，却也亏了师兄深洞中救出师父，返又与妖精厮战。且请师父自家坐着，我和你各持兵器，助助大哥，打倒妖精去来。”八戒摆手道：“不，不，不！他有神通，我们不济。”沙僧道：“说那里话！都是大家有益之事，虽说不济，却也放屁添风。”那呆子一时兴发，掣了钉钯，叫声“去来！”他两个不顾师父，一拥驾风赶上，举钉钯，使宝杖，望妖精乱打。那妖精战行者一个已是不能，又见他二人，怎生抵敌，急回头抽身就走。行者喝道：“兄弟们赶上！”那妖精见他们赶得紧，即将右脚上花鞋脱下来，吹口仙气，念个咒语，叫“变！”即变作本身模样，使两口剑舞将来，将身一幌，化一阵清风，径直回去。这番也只说战他们不过，顾命而回，岂知又有这般样事！</p>

<p>也是三藏灾星未退：他到了洞门前牌楼下，却见唐僧在那里独坐，他就近前一把抱住，抢了行李，咬断缰绳，连人和马，复又摄将进去不题。</p>

<p>且说八戒闪个空，一钯把妖精打落地，乃是一只花鞋。行者看见道：“你这两个呆子！看着师父罢了，谁要你来帮甚么功！”八戒道：“沙和尚，如何么！我说莫来。这猴子好的有些夹脑风，我们替他降了妖怪，返落得他生报怨！”行者道：“在那里降了妖怪？那妖怪昨日与我战时，使了一个遗鞋计哄了。你们走了，不知师父如何，我们快去看看！”三人急回来，果然没了师父，连行李白马一并无踪。慌得个八戒两头乱跑，沙僧前后跟寻，孙大圣亦心焦性燥。正寻觅处，只见那路旁边斜軃着半截儿缰绳。他一把拿起，止不住眼中流泪，放声叫道：“师父啊！</p>

<p>我去时辞别人和马，回来只见这些绳！”正是那见鞍思俊马，滴泪想亲人。八戒见他垂泪，忍不住仰天大笑。行者骂道：“你这个夯货！又是要散火哩！”八戒又笑道：“哥啊，不是这话，师父一定又被妖精摄进洞去了。常言道，事无三不成，你进洞两遭了，再进去一遭，管情救出师父来也。”行者揩了眼泪道：“也罢，到此地位，势不容己，我还进去。你两个没了行李马匹耽心，却好生把守洞口。”</p>

<p>好大圣，即转身跳入里面，不施变化，就将本身法相。真个是：古怪别腮心里强，自小为怪神力壮。高低面赛马鞍鞒，眼放金光如火亮。浑身毛硬似钢针，虎皮裙系明花响。上天撞散万云飞，下海混起千层浪。当天倚力打天王，挡退十万八千将。官封大圣美猴精，手中惯使金箍棒。今日西天任显能，复来洞内扶三藏。你看他停住云光，径到了妖精宅外，见那门楼门关了，不分好歹，轮铁棒一下打开，闯将进去。那里边静悄悄，全无人迹，东廊下不见唐僧，亭子上桌椅与各处家火，一件也无。原来他的洞里周围有三百余里，妖精窠穴甚多。前番摄唐僧在此，被行者寻着，今番摄了，又怕行者来寻，当时搬了，不知去向。</p>

<p>恼得这行者跌脚捶胸，放声高叫道：“师父啊！你是个晦气转成的唐三藏，灾殃铸就的取经僧！噫！这条路且是走熟了，如何不在？却教老孙那里寻找也！”正自吆喝爆燥之间，忽闻得一阵香烟扑鼻，他回了性道：“这香烟是从后面飘出，想是在后头哩。”拽开步，提着铁棒，走将进去看时，也不见动静。只见有三间倒坐儿，近后壁却铺一张龙吞口雕漆供桌，桌上有一个大流金香炉，炉内有香烟馥郁。那上面供养着一个大金字牌，牌上写着“尊父李天王之位”，略次些儿写着“尊兄哪吒三太子位”。</p>

<p>行者见了满心欢喜，也不去搜妖怪找唐僧，把铁棒捻作个绣花针儿，揌在耳朵里，轮开手，把那牌子并香炉拿将起来，返云光，径出门去。至洞口，唏唏哈哈，笑声不绝。八戒沙僧听见，掣放洞口，迎着行者道：“哥哥这等欢喜，想是救出师父也？”行者笑道：“不消我们救，只问这牌子要人。”八戒道：“哥啊，这牌子不是妖精，又不会说话，怎么问他要人？”行者放在地下道：</p>

<p>“你们看！”沙僧近前看时，上写着“尊父李天王之位”、“尊兄哪吒三太子位”。沙僧道：“此意何也？”行者道：“这是那妖精家供养的。我闯入他住居之所，见人迹俱无，惟有此牌。想是李天王之女，三太子之妹，思凡下界，假扮妖邪，将我师父摄去。不问他要人，却问谁要？你两个且在此把守，等老孙执此牌位，径上天堂玉帝前告个御状，教天王爷儿们还我师父。”八戒道：</p>

<p>“哥啊，常言道，告人死罪得死罪，须是理顺，方可为之。况御状又岂是可轻易告的？你且与我说，怎的告他？”行者笑道：“我有主张，我把这牌位香炉做个证见，另外再备纸状儿。”八戒道：</p>

<p>“状儿上怎么写？你且念念我听。”行者道：“告状人孙悟空，年甲在牒，系东土唐朝西天取经僧唐三藏徒弟。告为假妖摄陷人口事。今有托塔天王李靖同男哪吒太子，闺门不谨，走出亲女，在下方陷空山无底洞变化妖邪，迷害人命无数。今将吾师摄陷曲邃之所，渺无寻处。若不状告，切思伊父子不仁，故纵女氏成精害众。伏乞怜准，行拘至案，收邪救师，明正其罪，深为恩便。</p>

<p>有此上告。”八戒沙僧闻其言，十分欢喜道：“哥啊，告的有理，必得上风。切须早来，稍迟恐妖精伤了师父性命。”行者道：“我快！我快！多时饭熟，少时茶滚就回。”</p>

<p>好大圣，执着这牌位香炉，将身一纵，驾祥云直至南天门外。时有把天门的大力天王与护国天王见了行者，一个个都控背躬身，不敢拦阻，让他进去。直至通明殿下，有张葛许邱四大天师迎面作礼道：“大圣何来？”行者道：“有纸状儿，要告两个人哩。”天师吃惊道：“这个赖皮，不知要告那个。”无奈，将他引入灵霄殿下启奏。蒙旨宣进，行者将牌位香炉放下，朝上礼毕，将状子呈上。葛仙翁接了，铺在御案。玉帝从头看了，见这等这等，即将原状批作圣旨，宣西方长庚太白金星领旨到云楼宫宣托塔李天王见驾。行者上前奏道：“望天主好生惩治，不然，又别生事端。”玉帝又吩咐：“原告也去。”行者道：“老孙也去？”</p>

<p>四天师道：“万岁已出了旨意，你可同金星去来。”行者真个随着金星，纵云头早至云楼宫。原来是天王住宅，号云楼宫。金星见宫门首有个童子侍立，那童子认得金星，即入里报道：“太白金星老爷来了，”天王遂出迎迓，又见金星捧着旨意，即命焚香。及转身，又见行者跟入，天王即又作怒。你道他作怒为何？</p>

<p>当年行者大闹天宫时，玉帝曾封天王为降魔大元帅，封哪吒太子为三坛海会之神，帅领天兵，收降行者，屡战不能取胜。还是五百年前败阵的仇气，有些恼他，故此作怒。他且忍不住道：</p>

<p>“老长庚，你赍得是甚么旨意？”金星道：“是孙大圣告你的状子。”那天王本是烦恼，听见说个“告”字，一发雷霆大怒道：“他告我怎的？”金星道：“告你假妖摄陷人口事。你焚了香，请自家开读。”那天王气呼呼的设了香案，望空谢恩。拜毕，展开旨意看了，原来是这般这般，如此如此，恨得他手扑着香案道：“这个猴头！他也错告我了！”金星道：“且息怒，现有牌位香炉在御前作证，说是你亲女哩。”天王道：“我止有三个儿子，一个女儿。大小儿名金吒，侍奉如来，做前部护法。二小儿名木叉，在南海随观世音做徒弟。三小儿得名哪吒，在我身边，早晚随朝护驾。一女年方七岁，名贞英，人事尚未省得，如何会做妖精！</p>

<p>不信，抱出来你看。这猴头着实无礼！且莫说我是天上元勋，封受先斩后奏之职，就是下界小民，也不可诬告。律云：诬告加三等。”叫手下：“将缚妖索把这猴头捆了！”那庭下摆列着巨灵神、鱼肚将、药叉雄帅，一拥上前，把行者捆了。金星道：“李天王莫闯祸啊！我在御前同他领旨意来宣你的人。你那索儿颇重，一时捆坏他，阁气。”天王道：“金星啊，似他这等诈伪告扰，怎该容他！你且坐下，待我取砍妖刀砍了这个猴头，然后与你见驾回旨！”金星见他取刀，心惊胆战，对行者道：“你干事差了，御状可是轻易告的？你也不访的实，似这般乱弄，伤其性命，怎生是好？”行者全然不惧，笑吟吟的道：“老官儿放心，一些没事。老孙的买卖，原是这等做，一定先输后赢。”</p>

<p>说不了，天王轮过刀来，望行者劈头就砍。早有那三太子赶上前，将斩腰剑架住，叫道：“父王息怒。”天王大惊失色。噫！</p>

<p>父见子以剑架刀，就当喝退，怎么返大惊失色？原来天王生此子时，他左手掌上有个“哪”字，右手掌上有个“吒”字，故名哪吒。这太子三朝儿就下海净身闯祸，踏倒水晶宫，捉住蛟龙要抽筋为绦子。天王知道，恐生后患，欲杀之。哪吒奋怒，将刀在手，割肉还母，剔骨还父，还了父精母血，一点灵魂，径到西方极乐世界告佛。佛正与众菩萨讲经，只闻得幢幡宝盖有人叫道：“救命！”佛慧眼一看，知是哪吒之魂，即将碧藕为骨，荷叶为衣，念动起死回生真言，哪吒遂得了性命。运用神力，法降九十六洞妖魔，神通广大，后来要杀天王，报那剔骨之仇。天王无奈，告求我佛如来。如来以和为尚，赐他一座玲珑剔透舍利子如意黄金宝塔，那塔上层层有佛，艳艳光明。唤哪吒以佛为父，解释了冤仇。所以称为托塔李天王者，此也。今日因闲在家，未曾托着那塔，恐哪吒有报仇之意，故吓个大惊失色。却即回手，向塔座上取了黄金宝塔，托在手间问哪吒道：“孩儿，你以剑架住我刀，有何话说？”哪吒弃剑叩头道：“父王，是有女儿在下界哩。”天王道：“孩儿，我只生了你姊妹四个，那里又有个女儿哩？”哪吒道：“父王忘了，那女儿原是个妖精，三百年前成怪，在灵山偷食了如来的香花宝烛，如来差我父子天兵，将他拿住。拿住时，只该打死，如来吩咐道，积水养鱼终不钓，深山喂鹿望长生，当时饶了他性命。积此恩念，拜父王为父，拜孩儿为兄，在下方供设牌位，侍奉香火。不期他又成精，陷害唐僧，却被孙行者搜寻到巢穴之间，将牌位拿来，就做名告了御状。</p>

<p>此是结拜之恩女，非我同胞之亲妹也。”天王闻言悚然惊讶道：</p>

<p>“孩儿，我实忘了，他叫做甚么名字？”太子道：“他有三个名字：</p>

<p>他的本身出处，唤做金鼻白毛老鼠精；因偷香花宝烛，改名唤做半截观音；如今饶他下界，又改了，唤做地涌夫人是也。”天王却才省悟，放下宝塔，便亲手来解行者。行者就放起刁来道：</p>

<p>“那个敢解我！要便连绳儿抬去见驾，老孙的官事才赢！”慌得天王手软，太子无言，众家将委委而退。那大圣打滚撒赖，只要天王去见驾。天王无计可施，哀求金星说个方便。金星道：“古人云，万事从宽。你干事忒紧了些儿，就把他捆住，又要杀他。</p>

<p>这猴子是个有名的赖皮，你如今教我怎的处！若论你令郎讲起来，虽是恩女，不是亲女，却也晚亲义重，不拘怎生折辨，你也有个罪名。”天王道：“老星怎说个方便，就没罪了。”金星道：</p>

<p>“我也要和解你们，却只是无情可说。”天王笑道：“你把那奏招安授官衔的事说说，他也罢了。”真个金星上前，将手摸着行者道：“大圣，看我薄面，解了绳好去见驾。”行者道：“老官儿，不用解，我会滚法，一路滚就滚到也。”金星笑道：“你这猴忒恁寡情，我昔日也曾有些恩义儿到你，你这些些事儿，就不依我？”</p>

<p>行者道：“你与我有甚恩义？”金星道：“你当年在花果山为怪，伏虎降龙，强消死籍，聚群妖大肆猖狂，上天欲要擒你，是老身力奏，降旨招安，把你宣上天堂，封你做弼马温。你吃了玉帝仙酒，后又招安，也是老身力奏，封你做齐天大圣。你又不守本分，偷桃盗酒，窃老君之丹，如此如此，才得个无灭无生。若不是我，你如何得到今日？”行者道：“古人说得好，死了莫与老头儿同墓，干净会揭挑人！我也只是做弼马温，闹天宫罢了，再无甚大事。也罢，也罢，看你老人家面皮，还教他自己来解。”天王才敢向前，解了缚，请行者着衣上坐，一一上前施礼。</p>

<p>行者朝了金星道：“老官儿，何如？我说先输后赢，买卖儿原是这等做。快催他去见驾，莫误了我的师父。”金星道：“莫忙，弄了这一会，也吃锤茶儿去。”行者道：“你吃他的茶，受他的私，卖放犯人，轻慢圣旨，你得何罪？”金星道：“不吃茶！不吃茶！连我也赖将起来了！李天王，快走快走！”天王那里敢去，怕他没的说做有的，放起刁来，口里胡说乱道，怎生与他折辨，没奈何，又央金星，教说方便。金星道：“我有一句话儿，你可依我？”行者道：“绳捆刀砍之事，我也通看你面，还有甚话？你说！</p>

<p>你说！说得好，就依你；说得不好，莫怪。”金星道：“一日官事十日打，你告了御状，说妖精是天王的女儿，天王说不是，你两个只管在御前折辨，反复不已，我说天上一日，下界就是一年。这一年之间，那妖精把你师父陷在洞中，莫说成亲，若有个喜花下儿子，也生了一个小和尚儿，却不误了大事？”行者低头想道：“是啊！我离八戒沙僧，只说多时饭熟、少时茶滚就回，今已弄了这半会，却不迟了？老官儿，既依你说，这旨意如何回缴？”</p>

<p>金星道：“教李天王点兵，同你下去降妖，我去回旨。”行者道：</p>

<p>“你怎么样回？”金星道：“我只说原告脱逃，被告免提。”行者笑道：“好啊！我倒看你面情罢了，你倒说我脱逃！教他点兵在南天门外等我，我即和你回旨缴状去。”天王害怕道：“他这一去，若有言语，是臣背君也。”行者道：“你把老孙当甚么样人？我也是个大丈夫！一言既出，驷马难追，岂又有污言顶你？”天王即谢了行者，行者与金星回旨。天王点起本部天兵，径出南天门外。金星与行者回见玉帝道：“陷唐僧者，乃金鼻白毛老鼠成精，假设天王父子牌位。天王知之，已点兵收怪去了，望天尊赦罪。”玉帝已知此情，降天恩免究。行者即返云光，到南天门外，见天王、太子，布列天兵等候。噫！那些神将，风滚滚，雾腾腾，接住大圣，一齐坠下云头，早到了陷空山上。</p>

<p>八戒沙僧眼巴巴正等，只见天兵与行者来了。呆子迎着天王施礼道：“累及！累及！”天王道：“天蓬元帅，你却不知，只因我父子受他一炷香，致令妖精无理，困了你师父，来迟莫怪。这个山就是陷空山了？但不知他的洞门还向那边开？”行者道：</p>

<p>“我这条路且是走熟了。只是这个洞叫做个无底洞，周围有三百余里，妖精窠穴甚多。前番我师父在那两滴水的门楼里，今番静悄悄，鬼影也没个，不知又搬在何处去也。”天王道：“任他设尽千般计，难脱天罗地网中。到洞门前，再作道理。”大家就行。咦，约有十余里，就到了那大石边。行者指那缸口大的门儿道：“兀的便是也。”天王道：“不入虎穴，安得虎子！谁敢当先”行者道：“我当先。”三太子道：“我奉旨降妖，我当先。”那呆子便莽撞起来，高声叫道：“当头还要我老猪！”天王道：“不须罗噪，但依我分摆：孙大圣和太子同领着兵将下去，我们三人在口上把守，做个里应外合，教他上天无路，入地无门，才显些些手段。”众人都答应了一声“是”。</p>

<p>你看那行者和三太子，领了兵将，望洞里只是一溜。驾起云光，闪闪烁烁，抬头一望，果然好个洞啊：依旧双轮日月，照般一望山川。珠渊玉井暖韬烟，更有许多堪羡。迭迭朱楼画阁，嶷嶷赤壁青田。三春杨柳九秋莲，兀的洞天罕见。顷刻间，停住了云光，径到那妖精旧宅。挨门儿搜寻，吆吆喝喝，一重又一重，一处又一处，把那三百里地草都踏光了，那见个妖精？那见个三藏？都只说：“这孽畜一定是早出了这洞，远远去哩。”那晓得在那东南黑角落上，望下去，另有个小洞。洞里一重小小门，一间矮矮屋，盆栽了几种花，檐傍着数竿竹，黑气氲氲，暗香馥馥，老怪摄了三藏，搬在这里逼住成亲，只说行者再也找不着。</p>

<p>谁知他命合该休，那些小怪在里面，一个个哜哜嘈嘈，挨挨簇簇。中间有个大胆些的，伸起颈来，望洞外略看一看，一头撞着个天兵，一声嚷道：“在这里！”那行者恼起性来，捻着金箍棒，一下闯将进去，那里边窄小，窝着一窟妖精。三太子纵起天兵，一齐拥上，一个个那里去躲？行者寻着唐僧，和那龙马，和那行李。那老怪寻思无路，看着哪吒太子，只是磕头求命。太子道：</p>

<p>“这是玉旨来拿你，不当小可。我父子只为受了一炷香。险些儿和尚拖木头，做出了寺！”啈声“天兵，取下缚妖索，把那些妖精都捆了！”老怪也少不得吃场苦楚。返云光，一齐出洞。行者口里嘻嘻嘎嘎。天王掣开洞口，迎着行者道：“今番却见你师父也。”行者道：“多谢了！多谢了！”就引三藏拜谢天王，次及太子。沙僧八戒只是要碎剐那老精，天王道：“他是奉玉旨拿的，轻易不得。我们还要去回旨哩。”一边天王同三太子领着天兵神将，押住妖精，去奏天曹，听候发落；一边行者拥着唐僧，沙僧收拾行李，八戒拢马，请唐僧骑马，齐上大路。这正是：割断丝萝干金海，打开玉锁出樊笼。毕竟不知前去何如，且听下回分解。</p>
