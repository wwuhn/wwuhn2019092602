<P>A Pill of Red Cinnabar Is Brought from Heaven</P>
<P>After Three Years the Monarch Is Revived</P>
</div>
<P>The story tells how the Great Sage Sun, his head aching unbearably, pleaded with his master: &#8220;Stop, stop, I'll bring him back to life.&#8221; When Sanzang asked how, Monkey replied, &#8220;The only way is to go to the Underworld, find out which of the kings down there has his soul, and ask for it back to revive him with.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't trust Monkey, Master,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;He told me earlier there'd be no need to go to the Underworld because he could get him brought back to life in the world of the living. He thought that would be a good way of showing off his powers.&#8221;</P>
<P>The venerable elder, taken in once again by this breath of evil, started reciting the Band-tightening Spell, which threw Monkey into such a desperate state that he accepted the condition gladly: &#8220;I'll cure him within the world of the living, I really will.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't stop,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;carry on saying the spell.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You stupid, evil beast,&#8221; railed Monkey, &#8220;inciting the master to say that spell.&#8221; Pig was falling about with laughter.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother, brother, you thought you could put one over on me, but you never imagined I'd put one over on you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop, Master, stop,&#8221; pleaded Monkey. &#8220;I'll bring him back to life without leaving the world of the living.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;And how are you going to do that?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;With a single somersault of my cloud I can rush in through the Southern Gate of Heaven,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I won't go to the Palace of the Dipper and the Bull or to the Hall of Miraculous Mist, but straight up to the Tushita Palace in the Lihen Heaven above the Thirty-third Heaven to see the Supreme Lord Lao Zi. I'll ask him for one of his Nine-cycle Soul-returning Pills and that, I guarantee, will bring him back to life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Off you go then,&#8221; said Sanzang, delighted to hear this, &#8220;and be as quick as you can.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's the third watch now; it'll be after dawn by the time I get back,&#8221; said Brother Monkey. &#8220;But it's an awful shame to see that king lying there dead and cold. There ought to be a mourner watching over him and weeping.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't tell me,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;that ape wants me to be the mourner.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You most certainly will be,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;If you don't weep for him I won't be able to bring him back to life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You go, brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;and leave the crying to me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's more than one way of crying,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Just yelling with your mouth is what they call wailing. Squeezing some tears out is weeping. What we need is sobbing and tears together, and sobbing as though your heart is broken, for really proper weeping and wailing.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Shall I give you a demonstration?&#8221; asked Pig. He tore a strip of paper from somewhere, twisted it into a spill, and pushed it up his nose twice, which made him sneeze several times. Just watch as the tears come streaming down and his nose runs as he starts to wail. He sobbed and sobbed uncontrollably, talking all sorts of nonsense as if someone really had just died.</P>
<P>It was so distressing a performance that the Tang Priest started to cry, so upset was he. &#8220;That's just the sort of grief I want,&#8221; laughed Monkey, &#8220;and you're not to stop crying. It was you who tricked the master into sending me off, you idiot, and I'll hear if you stop wailing. Carry on like this and you'll be fine; but if you stop for even a few moments I'll give you twenty blows of my cudgel on your ankles.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Off you go,&#8221; laughed Pig. &#8220;Once I get crying like this I can keep it up for a couple of days.&#8221; Hearing all this fuss and bother, Friar Sand fetched some incense sticks and lit them as an offering.</P>
<P>&#8220;Very good,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;As you are all being so respectful I'll be able to do my best.&#8221;</P>
<P>Thus the Great Sage left his master and two fellow-disciples in the middle of the night and shot up on a somersault cloud. He went in through the Southern Gate of Heaven, and was as good as his word: he did not go to the Hall of Miraculous Mist or the Palace of the Dipper and the Bull, but took his shining cloud straight up to the Tushita Palace in the Lihen Heaven. No sooner was he inside than he saw the Supreme Lord Lao Zi sitting in his elixir laboratory where immortal boys were using a plantain-leaf fan to fan the furnace where elixir was refined.</P>
<P>When the Supreme Lord saw that Monkey was there he told the boys who were looking after the elixir, &#8220;Be very careful: the elixir thief is back.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey paid his respects with a smile: &#8220;How dreary of you, old man. No need to be on your guard against me. I don't do things like that any more.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Ape,&#8221; said Lord Lao Zi, &#8220;you stole a lot of my magic pills five hundred years ago when you made havoc in Heaven. The Little Sage Erlang captured you and brought you up here to be refined for forty-nine days in my elixir furnace. Goodness only knows how much charcoal we used up. Since you've been lucky enough to escape and be converted to Buddhism, you've been escorting the Tang Priest on his journey to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures. When you subdued those monsters on Flat-top Mountain the other day you were very wicked; you refused to give me back my treasures. What are you here for now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I really wasn't being late with them,&#8221; protested Monkey. &#8220;When the time came I gave you back your five treasures. What are you being so suspicious of me for?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why have you come sneaking into my palace when you ought to be on your journey?&#8221; Lord Lao Zi asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Since last I saw you,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;we've come to a country further West called Wuji, where an evil spirit disguised as a Taoist called up wind and rain, murdered the king, and turned himself into the king's double. Now he's sitting in the palace. Last night my master was reading sutras in the Precious Wood Monastery when he was visited by the king's ghost, who begged me to subdue the fiend for him and sort right from wrong. I didn't know whether to believe this, so I went with my fellow-disciple Pig into the palace gardens that night. We smashed our way in and found where he was buried in an eight-sided well with glazed-tile walls. We fished up his body, and it was in perfect condition. When we went back to the monastery to see my master he ordered me in his compassion to bring the king back to life. He won't let me go to the Underworld to ask for his soul back: I've got to find a way of saving him in the world of the living. The reason I've come to pay my respects to you is because there's no other place I can get him revived. I beg you, great Patriarch, in your mercy to lend me a thousand of your Nine-cycle Soul-returning Pills to save him with.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What outrageous nonsense, you ape,&#8221; said Lord Lao Zi. &#8220;A thousand? Two thousand? Do you want to make a meal of them? They're not just pellets of dirt. Clear off! I've none left.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What about a hundred or thereabouts?&#8221; asked Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Not even that,&#8221; said Lord Lao Zi. &#8220;Ten or so?&#8221; asked Monkey. &#8220;Stop pestering me, you wretched ape,&#8221; said Lord Lao Zi. &#8220;None at all. Clear off!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you really haven't got any,&#8221; said Monkey with a laugh, &#8220;I'll have to ask for help elsewhere.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Get out! Get out! Get out!&#8221; roared Lord Lao Zi, at which Monkey turned away and went.</P>
<P>It then suddenly occurred to Lord Lao Zi that Monkey was so wicked that even after he had announced his departure and gone, he might slip back and steal some. So he sent some immortal boys to call Monkey back. &#8220;You're so light-fingered, you monkey,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that I'd better give you a Soul-returning Pill.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Since you know my powers, old man,&#8221; said Brother Monkey, &#8220;bring out all your golden elixir and split it forty-sixty with me. You can consider yourself lucky. I might have taken the lot of them, like scooping up water in a leather sieve.&#8221; The patriarch produced the gourd and turned it upside-down. A solitary golden pill fell out. &#8220;It's the only one I have,&#8221; said Lord Lao Zi, handing it to Monkey. &#8220;Take it. I'm giving it to you to revive the king with and you can take the credit for it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Just a moment,&#8221; thought Monkey as he accepted it. &#8220;Let me taste it. He might be trying to fool me with a fake.&#8221; He popped it into his mouth, to the consternation of the patriarch, who grabbed him by the skullcap with one hand and seized his fist with the other. &#8220;Damned ape,&#8221; roared Lord Lao Zi, &#8220;if you've swallowed that I'll have had you killed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a face,&#8221; laughed Monkey. &#8220;How petty you look. I wouldn't want to eat your pill. It's not worth tuppence, and it's nothing like it's cracked up to be. Here it is.&#8221; Monkey had a pouch under his chin in which he had been keeping the pill.</P>
<P>Lord Lao Zi felt it, then said, &#8220;Clear off, and never come back here to pester me again.&#8221; The Great Sage then thanked the patriarch and left the Tushita Palace.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Watch him as he leaves the jade gates in a thousand beams of light and comes down to earth amid ten thousand auspicious clouds. In an instant he was out through the Southern Gate of Heaven and back to the land in the East, where the sun was now rising. He brought his cloud straight down to land outside the gate of the Precious Wood Monastery, where Pig could still be heard wailing. He approached and called, &#8220;Master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're back, Wukong,&#8221; said Sanzang with delight. &#8220;Have you got the pill?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Of course he would,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;even if he had to steal it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you can go away now. We don't need you to do that any more. Dry your tears or go and weep somewhere else.&#8221; Monkey then asked Friar Sand to fetch him some water. Friar Sand hurried to the well at the back where there was a convenient bucket and fetched Monkey half a bowlful of water. Monkey took the water, spat the pill out, and placed it between the king's lips. Then he prized the body's teeth apart with both hands and spurted the pill with a mouthful of clean water down into the king's stomach. For the next hour wild noises could be heard from the stomach, but still the body could not move. &#8220;Master,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;not even fetching my golden elixir is going to save him. Are you really going to torture me to death?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Of course he will come back to life,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;How else could a body so long dead swallow the water? This shows the miraculous power of the golden elixir. Once the golden elixir is in the stomach, the stomach starts singing; and when the stomach sings the blood-pulses move in harmony with it. The only thing is that the vital breath has been cut off and cannot extend itself. Iron would rust if it had been in a well for three years&#8212;how do you expect a human body to react? Now that his own vital breath has gone someone has to give him a mouthful of air.&#8221; Pig stepped forward to do this, only to be grabbed by Sanzang, who said, &#8220;You won't do. Get Wukong to come.&#8221;</P>
<P>Why did the master insist on this? It was because Pig had been a vicious man-eater since childhood, which meant that his breath was impure; whereas Monkey had cultivated his conduct since he was young and lived off the fruits of pine, cypress and peach trees, which gave him pure breath. So the Great Sage stepped forward, made a terrible thunder-god face, put his mouth to the king's lips, and blew in. The breath went down the kings mouth, through the High Tower,<SUP></SUP> round the Bright Hall and straight to the Cinnabar Field, then flowed back from the Bubbling Springs to the Mud-pill Palace. With a noisy rush of air the king's vital breath came together and his spirit refunded.</P>
<P>He sat up flexed his hands and feet, and called out, &#8220;Master.&#8221; Then he knelt in the dust and said, &#8220;I remember visiting you last night as a ghost, but I never expected to return to the world of the living today.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang hastened to raise him to his feet and said, &#8220;Your Majesty, it was none of my doing. You should thank my disciple.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a thing to say, Master,&#8221; laughed Monkey. &#8220;As the saying goes, 'A house can't have two masters.' It's quite right that you should accept his thanks.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang, still uncomfortable about accepting this courtesy, helped the king to his feet and took him into the meditation hall. Here the king bowed in greeting to Pig, Monkey and Friar Sand before taking his seat. By now the monks of the monastery had prepared breakfast, and they were going to bring it in when they saw the dripping wet king to their general alarm and suspicion.</P>
<P>Monkey leap out to say, &#8220;Don't worry, monks. This is the king of Wuji, your true sovereign. Three years ago he was murdered by a demon, and I brought him back to life last night. Today we'll be going to the capital to sort right from wrong. If you have any food, bring it in. We'll eat and then we'll be on our way.&#8221; The monks then brought in hot water for the king to wash with and a change of clothes. They took off the king's yellow ochre robe and gave him two of the abbot's cloth habits, with a yellow silk cord to tie around the waist instead of the belt of Lantian jade. They slipped off his no-worry shoes and put a pair of old monastic sandals on his feet instead. Then they all ate breakfast and the horse was saddled up.</P>
<P>&#8220;How heavy's the luggage, Pig?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I've been carrying it for so long that I don't know any more,&#8221; Pig replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Divide the stuff into two loads,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;and give one to the king to carry. We must be in town early to get on with the job.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm in luck,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;It took me one heck of an effort to carry him here, but now that he's alive again he's doing my work for me.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot asked the monastery for a carrying-pole and divided the luggage unfairly. He put all the light things into his load and the heavier ones into the king's. &#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; laughed Monkey, &#8220;don't you feel hard done by, dressed like that and having to walk with us carrying a load?&#8221; The monarch fell straight to his knees and replied, &#8220;Master, you're the father and mother who have given me a second life. Never mind carrying the baggage&#8212;I'd be your groom to serve you on your journey to the Western Heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No need for you to go there,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;We are bound to by fate. You'll just have to carry the stuff the fifteen miles into town. Once we've captured the fiend you must go back to ruling again and we'll go on to fetch our scriptures.&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig's comment on this was, &#8220;That means he'll only carry it for those fifteen miles, and I'll have to continue as the permanent porter.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's enough of that nonsense, brother,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Hurry out and lead the way.&#8221; Pig then led the way forward with the king while Friar Sand helped the master mount and Monkey brought up the rear. The five hundred monks of the monastery drew themselves up in an orderly procession to see them off to the accompaniment of music. &#8220;There's no need for you to come any further to see us on our way,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile. &#8220;It would be disastrous if any official heard about it and news of what we are going to do leaked out. Please please go straight back. I'd just like you to get His Majesty's clothes clean and tidy then send them into the capital this evening or tomorrow morning. I'll see to it that you're properly rewarded.&#8221; The monks obediently returned, and Monkey hastened his pace to catch up with his master as they pressed ahead. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In the West there was a magic spell to yield the truth;</P>
<P>Metal and Wood together refined the spirit.</P>
<P>The Mother of Cinnabar had a mysterious dream,</P>
<P>The boy grieved over the useless body.</P>
<P>The true ruler had to be found at the bottom of a well,</P>
<P>And a visit to Lord Lao Zi in Heaven was required.</P>
<P>Realizing that matter is void, he regained his nature;</P>
<P>The Buddha indeed saves those who are so predestined.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>It took master and disciples less than a morning to make their journey, and they were soon near the city. &#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;I think that must be the capital of Wuji ahead of us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Let's get there soon and do our job.&#8221; As they entered the city they saw that the people in the streets were well dressed and that there was an air of busy prosperity. The phoenix pavilions and dragon towers of the palace looked most magnificent, and there is a poem to prove it:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>These palaces resemble those of a great state;</P>
<P>The singing and dancing here are like in Tang.</P>
<P>Flowers face precious fans, and red clouds sail above;</P>
<P>Robes shine emerald in the sun.</P>
<P>The peacock gates open on clouds of incense,</P>
<P>Coloured flags fly over the curtains of pearl.</P>
<P>Truly an admirable picture of prosperity:</P>
<P>The officials stand silent with nothing to report.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sanzang dismounted and said, &#8220;Disciple, I think we should go to the palace and submit our travel document so as to avoid trouble from petty officials.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;My brothers and I will all go in together. It'll be much easier to manage if there are several of us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you all go in,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;don't talk rough. Pay your respects to him as a subject would to his sovereign before you say anything.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Does that mean kowtowing?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;the full obeisance with five bows and three kowtows.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're useless, Master,&#8221; laughed Brother Monkey. &#8220;It would be really stupid to do obeisance to him. You'd better let me go in first and sort things out. I'll see what he has to say before deciding how to reply. If I bow, you all bow; and if I squat, you all squat.&#8221;</P>
<P>Watch as the trouble-making Monkey King leads them to the palace gates and says to the official on duty there, &#8220;We are pilgrims sent by the Great Tang Emperor in the East to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven. Today we have come to present our credentials and I would trouble you, distinguished sir, to pass them on for us. In this way you will not hinder our excellent achievement.&#8221;</P>
<P>The gate officer then went in through the Southern gates of the palace, knelt on the steps, and reported, &#8220;There are five monks outside the gates who say that they are pilgrims sent by the Great Tang to worship the Buddha and fetch scriptures from the Western Heaven. They are now here to present their credentials, and rather than intrude uninvited they are awaiting they royal summons outside the gates.&#8221;</P>
<P>The fiend-monarch sent for them at once. As he went in through the palace gates with the Tang Priest, the king who had been brought back to life could not hold back his tears, which flowed down his cheeks. &#8220;How awful it is,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;that my kingdom, which is as strong as bronze and iron, has been secretly stolen from me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't upset yourself, Your Majesty,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;or you'll give the game away. My cudgel is dancing in my ear and it's absolutely bound to succeed. I guarantee that I'll kill the fiend and sweep away all his filth. The kingdom will soon be yours again.&#8221; The king dared not disobey, so wiping away his tears with his clothes he took his life in his hands and followed them as they went into the main audience hall of the palace.</P>
<P>Next were to be seen the civil and military officials and the four hundred courtiers, all towering over them in majestic silence. Monkey led the Tang Priest to stand unmoving at the foot of the white jade steps. The officials below the steps all trembled with fear.</P>
<P>&#8220;What a stupid monk,&#8221; they said. &#8220;Fancy seeing our king without even bowing to him or saying anything polite. He hasn't even made a respectful chant. What brazen effrontery.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before the words were out of their mouths the fiend-king asked, &#8220;Where is that monk from?&#8221;</P>
<P>To this Monkey boldly replied, &#8220;He is a pilgrim sent by imperial command from the land of Great Tang in the East of the Southern Jambu Continent to go to the Thunder Monastery in India in the West in order to worship the living Buddha and fetch the true scriptures. Now that he is here he does not wish to pass through your country without reporting his presence, which is why he has come today to submit his credentials.&#8221;</P>
<P>Hearing this, the fiend-king thought angrily, &#8220;What's so special about your Eastern land? I don't pay tribute to your court or have any dealings with your monarch. So how dare you be so rude and not bow to me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We in the East have long had a Heavenly dynasty,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile, &#8220;and been regarded as a superior country, while yours is just an inferior frontier state. As the old saying has it,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The emperor of a greater land</P>
<P>Is the father and the superior,</P>
<P>The ruler of a lesser state</P>
<P>Is the son and the inferior.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>You didn't even come out to meet us. How dare you complain about us not bowing!&#8221;</P>
<P>In a raging fury the fiend-king ordered his civil and military officials, &#8220;Arrest that uncouth monk.&#8221; At the word &#8220;Arrest&#8221; the officials all rushed at Monkey, who gave a shout, pointed at them, and told them to keep back. By pointing at them he made magic that immobilized them. None of the officials could now move. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The colonels before the steps became wooden figurines;</P>
<P>The generals in the hall were statues of clay.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Seeing that all his civil and military officials had been turned to statues, the fiend-king leapt down from his dragon throne and was just about to seize Monkey, who thought gleefully, &#8220;Just what I want. Even if his head is made of iron, one touch of my cudgel will be enough to make a hole in it.&#8221; But as the fiend started to move a rescuer came forward from beside him.</P>
<P>Do you know who it was? It was the crown prince of Wuji, who rushed forward to grab the fiend's court robes, kneel before him, and say, &#8220;Please don't be angry, Your Majesty.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why, my boy?&#8221; asked the fiend.</P>
<P>&#8220;Let me tell you, father. Three years ago I heard tell that a holy monk had been sent by the Tang Emperor to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven. I never thought that he would be here in our country today. Your Majesty has a fiery temper, and I'm afraid that you will have the monk beheaded, and that the Great Tang Emperor will be furious when he eventually hears the news. Since making himself ruler the Tang Emperor Li Shimin has unified the country, but he isn't satisfied yet. He has sent military expeditions overseas already. If he learns, sir, that you have killed this holy priest who is his sworn brother he's bound to raise an army to wage war on you. Our forces are much too weak to cope, but by then it will be too late for regrets. If Your Majesty will accept your son's suggestion you should have the four monks arrested and thoroughly questioned. Hold them on the charge of not paying obeisance to the royal presence; sentence can be passed later.&#8221;</P>
<P>All these suggestion to hold the fiend back were made because the crown prince was worried that the fiend would harm the Tang Priest. He did not realize that Monkey had deliberately done things in that way in order to get a crack at the fiend.</P>
<P>The fiend accepted the prince's advice, stood before his throne, and roared, &#8220;Monk, when did you leave the East? Why did the Tang monarch send you to fetch scriptures?&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey stood proud as he replied, &#8220;My master is the Tang Emperor's sworn brother, and his title is Sanzang. The Tang Emperor has a minister called Wei Zheng who beheaded the old dragon of the Jing River in a dream because Heaven ordered him to. When the Tang Emperor came back to life after dreaming that he had toured the Underworld, he held a Great Water and Land Mass to save the souls of all those who had been unjustly slain. Because my master preached on the scriptures with such broad compassion the Bodhisattva Guanyin instructed him to travel West. My master made a solemn vow volunteering gladly to do this in order to express his full loyalty to his country, and was given a letter of credence by the Tang Emperor. This was three days before the full moon in the ninth month of the thirteenth year of the reign-period<I> Tien Guan.</I> After leaving the lands of the East he came to the Double-boundary Mountain, where he took me to be his senior disciple; my name is Sun Wukong, Sun the Novice, or Brother Monkey. Then he came to Gao Village in the Land of Stubet, where he took his second disciple, called Zhu Bajie, Zhu Wuneng, or Pig. At the Flowing Sands River he took his third disciple, Sha Wujing, or Friar Sand. Then the day before yesterday he took on a lay brother at the Precious Wood Monastery to be our porter.&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing all this the fiend, who had no way of searching the Tang Priest, or of using a crafty approach to questioning Monkey, glared angrily and said, &#8220;When you left the East you were travelling alone. Of the four followers you picked up the three regular monks are no problem. But I won't stand for your taking that lay brother. I'm sure the fellow was kidnapped. What's he called? Does he have an official ordination license? Bring him forward to make a statement.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this the real king began to tremble as the asked, &#8220;Master, what shall I say?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be afraid,&#8221; said Monkey, giving him a pinch. &#8220;I'll speak for you.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage hurried forward and yelled to the fiend at the top of his voice, &#8220;Your Majesty, this old lay brother is dumb, and a bit deaf too. But when he was young he once went to the Western Heaven, so he knows the way. I'm very familiar with his background, so I beg Your Majesty in your mercy to allow me to speak on his behalf.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Unless you want to be punished you'd better make a full and frank statement at once,&#8221; said the fiend.</P>
<P>To this Monkey said,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;The brother now confessing is getting on in years,</P>
<P>Struck both deaf and dumb, and bankrupt too.</P>
<P>Long have his family lived in this region</P>
<P>Till five years ago catastrophe struck.</P>
<P>No rain fell, and the people suffered drought;</P>
<P>Monarch and commoners all kept and fast.</P>
<P>Incense was burned amid their prayers to Heaven,</P>
<P>But for hundreds of miles no clouds could be seen.</P>
<P>When all of the people were in agonies of hunger,</P>
<P>A wizard from Zhongshan suddenly arrived.</P>
<P>He showed his great powers to bring the wind and rain,</P>
<P>Then secretly murdered the ruler of the country,</P>
<P>Pushed him down the well in the palace's garden,</P>
<P>Took the throne himself in the king's own likeness.</P>
<P>Luckily I came and did a great good deed,</P>
<P>Raising the dead and restoring him to life.</P>
<P>Then he volunteered to act as our porter</P>
<P>And go to the West together with us monks.</P>
<P>The false king is really a very evil wizard;</P>
<P>The lay brother is in fact the true king in disguise.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Hearing this as he sat in his palace's throne hall, the fiend was so frightened that his heart leapt like a little deer, and his face flushed. He drew away at once and was just about to flee, but he was unarmed. He turned round to see that one of the officers of the palace guard who had a sword at his waist was standing stock-still like an idiot because Monkey's magic had immobilized him.</P>
<P>The fiend grabbed the sword and rose into the air on a cloud, to the thunderous fury of Friar Sand and loud complaints from Pig about Monkey's impatience: &#8220;If you'd taken it a bit more gently you could have calmed him down and got him. If he gets away on his cloud now, where ever will you find him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop that awful din, brothers,&#8221; laughed Monkey. &#8220;Let's ask the prince to come down and pay his respects to his father, and invite the queen and the consorts to bow to their husband.&#8221; He then recited the words to lift the immobilizing spell, and said, &#8220;When the officials come to, tell them all to come and pay homage to their sovereign. Then it will be known who is the real king. Tell everyone what has happened so that the truth can be known. I'm off to find the demon.&#8221; The splendid Great Sage then gave Pig and Friar Sand his parting instructions: &#8220;Look after them all&#8212;king and ministers, father and son, queen and consorts, and our master.&#8221; By the time he had finished speaking he had already disappeared.</P>
<P>He was already up in the ninth layer of cloud, looking all around for the fiend. He saw that the wretch had got away with his life and was fleeing back to the East. Monkey was soon close behind him and shouting, &#8220;Where do you think you're going, monster? Monkey's after you.&#8221;</P>
<P>The fiend turned to look, raised his sword, and shouted, &#8220;You scoundrel, Monkey. It was none of your business that I was sitting on someone else's throne. Why did you have to come here righting wrongs and giving my secret away?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll get you, you cheeky monster,&#8221; chuckled Monkey. &#8220;Don't imagine you'll ever be a king again. As you knew who I was you should have made yourself scarce instead of giving my master a bad time. What sort of confession were you trying to extort from him? The one you got just now? If you won't go, tough guy, try a taste of my cudgel.&#8221; The fiend dodged the blow then struck back at Monkey's face with his sword. Once the two of them were in action it was a splendid fight. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Fierce was the Monkey king, and strong the demon monarch,</P>
<P>As cudgel parried sword while they fought against each other.</P>
<P>For one whole day the Three Worlds are in cloud</P>
<P>Just because a monarch recovered his throne.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After a few rounds the fiend realized that he was no match for Monkey and fled back to the city by the way he had come. He rushed through the two lines of civil and military officials before the white jade steps, turned himself into the likeness of the Tang Priest with a shake of his body, and stood holding his hands together before the steps of the throne hall.</P>
<P>When the Great Sage caught the monster up and had raised his cudgel to strike him down the monster said, &#8220;Disciple, it's me, don't hit me.&#8221; Monkey then raised his cudgel to strike the real Tang Priest, who also said, &#8220;Disciple, it's me, don't hit me.&#8221; Both Tang Priests were so alike as to be indistinguishable.</P>
<P>&#8220;If I kill the Tang Priest who is really the demon in disguise, that will be a great achievement,&#8221; thought Monkey. &#8220;But if I killed my real master that would be terrible.&#8221; So he had to stay his hand while he asked Pig and Friar Sand, &#8220;Which one is the fiend and which is our master? Point the fiend out to me and I'll kill him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You made such a noise when you were fighting up there,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;that I blinked, and when I opened my eyes again there were two masters. I don't know which is the real one.&#8221;</P>
<P>As soon as he heard this Monkey made magic with his hands, said the words of the spell, and called on all the devas who guard the dharma, the Six Dings, the Six Jias, the Protectors of the Four Quarters and the Centre, the Four Duty Gods, and the Eighteen Guardians of the Faith, as well as the local deities and mountain gods: &#8220;I'm here to subdue a demon, but the demon has turned himself into my master. They're so alike I can't tell them apart. As you have secret understanding, please invite my master to enter the throne hall so that I can capture the fiend.&#8221;</P>
<P>Now the fiend was good at cloud-jumping, and the moment he heard what Monkey was saying he got out by leaping on the roof of the throne hall, so that when Monkey raised his cudgel he struck at the Tang Priest. Oh dear! Had he not called in those gods he would have beaten twenty Tang Priests to pulp there and then. Luckily the gods blocked his cudgel and said, &#8220;Great Sage, the fiend is a cloud-jumper. He's got up on the roof.&#8221; But as soon as Monkey went up on the roof after him the fiend jumped down again, grabbed hold of the real Tang Priest, and got the two of them muddled up again in the crowds. They were once again indistinguishable.</P>
<P>Monkey was most upset, and on hearing Pig's mocking laughter from beside him he burst into a fury: &#8220;What's wrong with you, cretin? You'll have to be at the beck and call of two masters now, so why are you looking so pleased?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Call me stupid if you like, brother,&#8221; laughed Pig, &#8220;but you're even sillier than me. If you can't tell which is the master, don't waste your effort trying. If you can bear the headache, ask our master to say the spell. Friar Sand and I will each stand by one of them and listen. The one who doesn't know the words will be the fiend. What's the problem?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Good for you, brother,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Only three people know the words of that spell. They came from the heart of Lord Buddha and were taught to the Bodhisattva Guanyin, who passed them on to our master. Nobody else knows them. Very well then. Say the spell, Master.&#8221; The Tang Priest then really did begin to recite it. The fiend, who could not possibly have known the words, could only mumble some gibberish.</P>
<P>&#8220;This one here who's mumbling is the fiend,&#8221; said Pig. Letting go of the monster and raising his rake to strike him with, the fiend leapt up into the air and flew away on a cloud.</P>
<P>With a great shout the splendid Pig mounted another cloud and went after him. Friar Sand too was so excited that he abandoned the Tang Priest and brandished his own staff for battle. Only then did the Tang Priest stop saying the spell. The Great Sage Monkey grabbed his cudgel and joined in the aerial chase despite his headache. In this fight three ferocious monks had one wretched fiend surrounded. As the fiend was held in check by Pig's rake and Friar Sand's staff, Monkey laughed and said, &#8220;I can't go straight up to him and hit him head-on because he's so scared of me that he'd run away. I'll go up higher, turn myself upside-down, and hit him that way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Great Sage then sprang up in auspicious light to the ninth layer of cloud, and was just about to deliver his blow when a multicolored cloud appeared to the Northwest and a voice shouted loudly, &#8220;Don't hit him, Sun Wukong.&#8221; Monkey turned round to see that this was the Bodhisattva Manjusri checked his blow at once, and did obeisance.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you going, Bodhisattva?&#8221; he asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm here to collect that fiend for you,&#8221; Manjusri replied. Monkey thanked him for his trouble. Manjusri produced the demon-revealing mirror from his sleeve to reveal the fiend's true form, then Monkey called Pig and Friar Sand to come to greet the Bodhisattva. When they all looked in the mirror they saw that the monster was quite appallingly ugly:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Eyes like glazed dishes,</P>
<P>A head like a steel cauldron.</P>
<P>His whole body blue as indigo in summer,</P>
<P>His claws as white as autumn frosts.</P>
<P>Two floppy ears,</P>
<P>A tail as long as a broom.</P>
<P>Blue hairs bristling with courage,</P>
<P>Red eyes shining with gold.</P>
<P>Flat teeth like jade flagstones,</P>
<P>Round whiskers sticking out like spears.</P>
<P>When his true image is shown in the mirror</P>
<P>He is Manjusri's Lion King.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Bodhisattva,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;he's the blue-haired lion from under your throne. Why did he run away here to be an evil spirit, and why didn't you subdue him before?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; replied the Bodhisattva, &#8220;he didn't run away. He was sent here by the Lord Buddha.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How could the Lord Buddha possibly have sent this beast here to become a spirit and usurp a throne? I could have done with some of his edicts to help me to put up with the misery of escorting the Tang Priest.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There are some things you don't know,&#8221; said Manjusri. &#8220;That king of Wuji was a benevolent man and used to feast monks. The Lord Buddha sent me here to bring him to the West, where he might become a golden arhat. Because I could not appear to him in my real form I turned into an ordinary monk and asked him for some vegetarian food. When he was unable to answer some questions I asked he took me for an evildoer, had me tied up, and immersed me in the palace moat for three days. Luckily the Six Jias saved me with their golden bodies and took me back to the West, where I reported to the Tathagata Buddha. It was he who ordered that the king be pushed into the well and soaked for three years as punishment for my three-day soaking. 'Every mouthful we eat or drink is predestined.' By coming here you have now won a great merit.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You may have repaid your private grudge, like repaying every mouthful, but goodness only knows how many people that monster murdered,&#8221; replied Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;He never killed anyone,&#8221; the Bodhisattva replied. &#8220;In the three years since his arrival the winds and rains have come at the right time, the state has been strong and the people have known peace. He did nobody any harm.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Even if all that is granted,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;he's been sleeping with the queen and the consorts in the harem. Surely this has sullied them and been an affront to morality.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He has not sullied them at all,&#8221; the Bodhisattva replied. &#8220;He's a gelded lion.&#8221;</P>
<P>Hearing this Pig went up to the creature and had a feel. &#8220;This evil spirit's got a bad reputation he doesn't deserve,&#8221; he chuckled, &#8220;like a teetotaler with a red nose.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;take him with you. If you hadn't come, Bodhisattva, I'd never have spared his life.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Bodhisattva then said a spell and shouted, &#8220;Return to the Truth, beast. What are you waiting for?&#8221; Only then did the fiend-king return to his original form, Manjusri placed a lotus-blossom over the monster to tame him, sat on his back, and left Monkey amid golden light. Ah!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Manjusri returned to Wutai Mountain</P>
<P>To hear the scriptures taught beneath the lotus throne.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know how the Tang Priest and his disciples left the city, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>一粒金丹天上得</p>
<p>三年故主世间生</p>
</div>
<p>话说那孙大圣头痛难禁，哀告道：“师父，莫念！莫念！等我医罢！”长老问：“怎么医？”行者道：“只除过阴司，查勘那个阎王家有他魂灵，请将来救他。”八戒道：“师父莫信他。他原说不用过阴司，阳世间就能医活，方见手段哩。”那长老信邪风，又念《紧箍儿咒》，慌得行者满口招承道：“阳世间医罢！阳世间医罢！”八戒道：“莫要住！只管念！只管念！”行者骂道：“你这呆孽畜，撺道师父咒我哩！”八戒笑得打跌道：“哥耶！哥耶！你只晓得捉弄我，不晓得我也捉弄你捉弄！”行者道：“师父，莫念！莫念！待老孙阳世间医罢。”三藏道：“阳世间怎么医？”行者道：“我如今一筋斗云，撞入南天门里，不进斗牛宫，不入灵霄殿，径到那三十三天之上离恨天宫兜率院内，见太上老君，把他九转还魂丹求得一粒来，管取救活他也。”三藏闻言大喜道：“就去快来。”行者道：“如今有三更时候罢了，投到回来，好天明了。只是这个人睡在这里，冷淡冷淡，不象个模样；须得举哀人看着他哭，便才好哩。”八戒道：“不消讲，这猴子一定是要我哭哩。”行者道：“怕你不哭！你若不哭，我也医不成！”八戒道：“哥哥，你自去，我自哭罢了。”行者道：“哭有几样：若干着口喊谓之嚎，扭搜出些眼泪儿来谓之啕。又要哭得有眼泪，又要哭得有心肠，才算着嚎啕痛哭哩。”八戒道：“我且哭个样子你看看。”他不知那里扯个纸条，拈作一个纸拈儿，往鼻孔里通了两通，打了几个涕喷，你看他眼泪汪汪，粘涎答答的，哭将起来，口里不住的絮絮叨叨，数黄道黑，真个象死了人的一般。哭到那伤情之处，唐长老也泪滴心酸。行者笑道：“正是那样哀痛，再不许住声。你这呆子哄得我去了，你就不哭，我还听哩！</p>

<p>若是这等哭便罢，若略住住声儿，定打二十个孤拐！”八戒笑道：“你去你去！我这一哭动头，有两日哭哩。”沙僧见他数落，便去寻几枝香来烧献，行者笑道：“好好好！一家儿都有些敬意，老孙才好用功。”</p>

<p>好大圣，此时有半夜时分，别了他师徒三众，纵筋斗云，只入南天门里，果然也不谒灵霄宝殿，不上那斗牛天宫，一路云光，径来到三十三天离恨天兜率宫中。才入门，只见那太上老君正坐在那丹房中，与众仙童执芭蕉扇扇火炼丹哩。他见行者来时，即吩咐看丹的童儿：“各要仔细，偷丹的贼又来也。”行者作礼笑道：“老官儿，这等没搭撒，防备我怎的？我如今不干那样事了。”老君道：“你那猴子，五百年前大闹天宫，把我灵丹偷吃无数，着小圣二郎捉拿上界，送在我丹炉炼了四十九日，炭也不知费了多少。你如今幸得脱身，皈依佛果，保唐僧往西天取经，前者在平顶山上降魔，弄刁难，不与我宝贝，今日又来做甚？”行者道：“前日事，老孙更没稽迟，将你那五件宝贝当时交还，你反疑心怪我？”老君道：“你不走路，潜入吾宫怎的？”行者道：“自别后，西过一方，名乌鸡国。那国王被一妖精假妆道士，呼风唤雨，阴害了国王，那妖假变国王相貌，现坐金銮殿上。是我师父夜坐宝林寺看经，那国王鬼魂参拜我师，敦请老孙与他降妖，辨明邪正。正是老孙思无指实，与弟八戒，夜入园中，打破花园，寻着埋藏之所，乃是一眼八角琉璃井内，捞上他的尸首，容颜不改。到寺中见了我师，他发慈悲，着老孙医救，不许去赴阴司里求索灵魂，只教在阳世间救治。我想着无处回生，特来参谒，万望道祖垂怜，把九转还魂丹借得一千丸儿，与我老孙搭救他也。”老君道：“这猴子胡说！甚么一千丸，二千丸！</p>

<p>当饭吃哩！是那里土块捘的，这等容易？咄！快去！没有！”行者笑道：“百十丸儿也罢。”老君道：“也没有。”行者道：“十来丸也罢。”老君怒道：“这泼猴却也缠帐！没有，没有！出去，出去！”</p>

<p>行者笑道：“真个没有，我问别处去救罢。”老君喝道：“去！去！</p>

<p>去！”这大圣拽转步，往前就走。老君忽的寻思道：“这猴子惫懒哩，说去就去，只怕溜进来就偷。”即命仙童叫回来道：“你这猴子，手脚不稳，我把这还魂丹送你一丸罢。”行者道：“老官儿，既然晓得老孙的手段，快把金丹拿出来，与我四六分分，还是你的造化哩；不然，就送你个皮笊篱，一捞个罄尽。”那老祖取过葫芦来，倒吊过底子，倾出一粒金丹，递与行者道：“止有此了，拿去，拿去！送你这一粒，医活那皇帝，只算你的功果罢。”</p>

<p>行者接了道：“且休忙，等我尝尝看，只怕是假的，莫被他哄了。”扑的往口里一丢，慌得那老祖上前扯住，一把揪着顶瓜皮，揝着拳头骂道：“这泼猴若要咽下去，就直打杀了！”行者笑道：“嘴脸！小家子样！那个吃你的哩！能值几个钱？虚多实少的，在这里不是？”原来那猴子颏下有嗉袋儿，他把那金丹噙在嗉袋里，被老祖捻着道：“去罢！去罢！再休来此缠绕！”这大圣才谢了老祖，出离了兜率天宫。</p>

<p>你看他千条瑞霭离瑶阙，万道祥云降世尘，须臾间下了南天门，回到东观，早见那太阳星上。按云头，径至宝林寺山门外，只听得八戒还哭哩，忽近前叫声：“师父。”三藏喜道：“悟空来了，可有丹药？”行者道：“有。”八戒道：“怎么得没有？他偷也去偷人家些来！”行者笑道：“兄弟，你过去罢，用不着你了。你揩揩眼泪，别处哭去。”教：“沙和尚，取些水来我用。”沙僧急忙往后面井上，有个方便吊桶，即将半钵盂水递与行者。行者接了水，口中吐出丹来，安在那皇帝唇里，两手扳开牙齿，用一口清水，把金丹冲灌下肚。有半个时辰，只听他肚里呼呼的乱响，只是身体不能转移。行者道：“师父，弄我金丹也不能救活，可是掯杀老孙么！”三藏道：“岂有不活之理。似这般久死之尸，如何吞得水下？此乃金丹之仙力也。自金丹入腹，却就肠鸣了，肠鸣乃血脉和动，但气绝不能回伸。莫说人在井里浸了三年，就是生铁也上锈了，只是元气尽绝，得个人度他一口气便好。”</p>

<p>那八戒上前就要度气，三藏一把扯住道：“使不得！还教悟空来。”那师父甚有主张：原来猪八戒自幼儿伤生作孽吃人，是一口浊气；惟行者从小修持，咬松嚼柏，吃桃果为生，是一口清气。这大圣上前，把个雷公嘴噙着那皇帝口唇，呼的一口气收入咽喉，度下重楼，转明堂，径至丹田，从涌泉倒返泥垣宫。呼的一声响喨，那君王气聚神归，便翻身，轮拳曲足，叫了一声“师父！”双膝跪在尘埃道：“记得昨夜鬼魂拜谒，怎知道今朝天晓返阳神！”三藏慌忙搀起道：“陛下，不干我事，你且谢我徒弟。”行者笑道：“师父说那里话？常言道，家无二主，你受他一拜儿不亏。”三藏甚不过意，搀起那皇帝来，同入禅堂，又与八戒、行者、沙僧拜见了，方才按座。只见那本寺的僧人，整顿了早斋，却欲来奉献；忽见那个水衣皇帝，个个惊张，人人疑说。</p>

<p>孙行者跳出来道：“那和尚，不要这等惊疑，这本是乌鸡国王，乃汝之真主也。三年前被怪害了性命，是老孙今夜救活，如今进他城去，要辨明邪正。若有了斋，摆将来，等我们吃了走路。”</p>

<p>众僧即奉献汤水，与他洗了面，换了衣服。把那皇帝赭黄袍脱了，本寺僧官，将两领布直裰，与他穿了；解下蓝田带，将一条黄丝绦子与他系了；褪下无忧履，与他一双旧僧鞋撒了。却才都吃了早斋，扣背马匹。</p>

<p>行者问：“八戒，你行李有多重？”八戒道：“哥哥，这行李日逐挑着，倒也不知有多重。”行者道：“你把那一担儿分为两担，将一担儿你挑着，将一担儿与这皇帝挑，我们赶早进城干事。”</p>

<p>八戒欢喜道：“造化！造化！当时驮他来，不知费了多少力，如今医活了，原来是个替身。”那呆子就弄玄虚，将行李分开，就问寺中取条匾担，轻些的自己挑了，重些的教那皇帝挑着。行者笑道：“陛下，着你那般打扮，挑着担子，跟我们走走，可亏你么？”那国王慌忙跪下道：“师父，你是我重生父母一般，莫说挑担，情愿执鞭坠镫，伏侍老爷，同行上西天去也。”行者道：“不要你去西天，我内中有个缘故。你只挑得四十里进城，待捉了妖精，你还做你的皇帝，我们还取我们的经也。”八戒听言道：“这等说，他只挑四十里路，我老猪还是长工！”行者道：“兄弟，不要胡说，趁早外边引路。”真个八戒领那皇帝前行，沙僧伏侍师父上马，行者随后，只见那本寺五百僧人，齐齐整整，吹打着细乐，都送出山门之外。行者笑道：“和尚们不必远送，但恐官家有人知觉，泄漏我的事机，反为不美。快回去！快回去！但把那皇帝的衣服冠带，整顿干净，或是今晚明早，送进城来，我讨些封赡赏赐谢你。”众僧依命各回讫。行者搀开大步，赶上师父，一直前来，正是：西方有诀好寻真，金木和同却炼神。丹母空怀懞懂梦，婴儿长恨杌樗身。必须井底求明主，还要天堂拜老君。悟得色空还本性，诚为佛度有缘人。</p>

<p>师徒们在路上，那消半日，早望见城池相近，三藏道：“悟空，前面想是乌鸡国了。”行者道：“正是，我们快赶进城干事。”</p>

<p>那师徒进得城来，只见街市上人物齐整，风光闹热，早又见凤阁龙楼，十分壮丽。有诗为证，诗曰：海外宫楼如上邦，人间歌舞若前唐。花迎宝扇红云绕，日照鲜袍翠雾光。孔雀屏开香霭出，珍珠帘卷彩旗张。太平景象真堪贺，静列多官没奏章。三藏下马道：“徒弟啊，我们就此进朝倒换关文，省得又拢那个衙门费事。”行者道：“说得有理，我兄弟们都进去，人多才好说话。”唐僧道：“都进去，莫要撒村，先行了君臣礼，然后再讲。”</p>

<p>行者道：“行君臣礼，就要下拜哩。”三藏道：“正是，要行五拜三叩头的大礼。”行者笑道：“师父不济，若是对他行礼，诚为不智。你且让我先走到里边，自有处置。等他若有言语，让我对答。我若拜，你们也拜；我若蹲，你们也蹲。”你看那惹祸的猴王，引至朝门，与阁门大使言道：“我等是东土大唐驾下差来上西天拜佛求经者，今到此倒换关文，烦大人转达，是谓不误善果。”那黄门官即入端门，跪下丹墀启奏道：“朝门外有五众僧人，言是东土唐国钦差上西天拜佛求经，今至此倒换关文，不敢擅入，现在门外听宣。”</p>

<p>那魔王即令传宣。唐僧却同入朝门里面，那回生的国主随行。正行，忍不住腮边堕泪，心中暗道：“可怜！我的铜斗儿江山，铁围的社稷，谁知被他阴占了！”行者道：“陛下切莫伤感，恐走漏消息。这棍子在我耳朵里跳哩，如今决要见功，管取打杀妖魔，扫荡邪物，这江山不久就还归你也。”那君王不敢违言，只得扯衣揩泪，舍死相生，径来到金銮殿下。又见那两班文武，四百朝官，一个个威严端肃，像貌轩昂。这行者引唐僧站立在白玉阶前，挺身不动，那阶下众官，无不悚惧，道：“这和尚十分愚浊！怎么见我王便不下拜，亦不开言呼祝？喏也不唱一个，好大胆无礼！”说不了，只听得那魔王开口问道：“那和尚是那方来的？”行者昂然答道：“我是南赡部洲东土大唐国奉钦差前往西域天竺国大雷音寺拜活佛求真经者，今到此方，不敢空度，特来倒换通关文牒。”那魔王闻说，心中作怒道：“你东土便怎么！我不在你朝进贡，不与你国相通，你怎么见吾抗礼，不行参拜！”行者笑道：“我东土古立天朝，久称上国，汝等乃下土边邦。自古道，上邦皇帝，为父为君；下邦皇帝，为臣为子。你倒未曾接我，且敢争我不拜？”那魔王大怒，教文武官：“拿下这野和尚去！”说声叫“拿”，你看那多官一齐踊跃。这行者喝了一声，用手一指，教：“莫来！”那一指，就使个定身法，众官俱莫能行动，真个是校尉阶前如木偶，将军殿上似泥人。</p>

<p>那魔王见他定住了文武多官，急纵身，跳下龙床，就要来拿。猴王暗喜道：“好！正合老孙之意，这一来就是个生铁铸的头，汤着棍子，也打个窟窿！”正动身，不期旁边转出一个救命星来。你道是谁，原来是乌鸡国王的太子，急上前扯住那魔王的朝服，跪在面前道：“父王息怒。”妖精问：“孩儿怎么说？”太子道：“启父王得知，三年前闻得人说，有个东土唐朝驾下钦差圣僧往西天拜佛求经，不期今日才来到我邦。父王尊性威烈，若将这和尚拿去斩首，只恐大唐有日得此消息，必生嗔怒。你想那李世民自称王位，一统江山，心尚未足，又兴过海征伐。若知我王害了他御弟圣僧，一定兴兵发马，来与我王争敌。奈何兵少将微，那时悔之晚矣。父王依儿所奏，且把那四个和尚，问他个来历分明，先定他一段不参王驾，然后方可问罪。”</p>

<p>这一篇，原来是太子小心，恐怕来伤了唐僧，故意留住妖魔，更不知行者安排着要打。那魔王果信其言，立在龙床前面，大喝一声道：“那和尚是几时离了东土？唐王因甚事着你求经？”行者昂然而答道：“我师父乃唐王御弟，号曰三藏。因唐王驾下有一丞相，姓魏名徵，奉天条梦斩泾河老龙。大唐王梦游阴司地府，复得回生之后，大开水陆道场，普度冤魂孽鬼。因我师父敷演经文，广运慈悲，忽得南海观世音菩萨指教来西。我师父大发弘愿，情欣意美，报国尽忠，蒙唐王赐与文牒。那时正是大唐贞观十三年九月望前三日。离了东土，前至两界山，收了我做大徒弟，姓孙，名悟空行者；又到乌斯国界高家庄，收了二徒弟，姓猪，名悟能八戒；流沙河界，又收了三徒弟，姓沙，名悟净和尚；前日在敕建宝林寺，又新收个挑担的行童道人。”魔王闻说，又没法搜检那唐僧，弄巧计盘诘行者，怒目问道：“那和尚，你起初时，一个人离东土，又收了四众，那三僧可让，这一道难容。那行童断然是拐来的。他叫做甚么名字？有度牒是无度牒？拿他上来取供。”唬得那皇帝战战兢兢道：“师父啊！</p>

<p>我却怎的供？”孙行者捻他一把道：“你休怕，等我替你供。”好大圣，趋步上前，对怪物厉声高叫道：“陛下，这老道是一个瘖痖之人，却又有些耳聋。只因他年幼间曾走过西天，认得道路，他的一节儿起落根本，我尽知之，望陛下宽恕，待我替他供罢。”魔王道：“趁早实实的替他供来，免得取罪。”行者道：“供罪行童年且迈，痴聋瘖痖家私坏。祖居原是此间人，五载之前遭破败。天无雨，民干坏，君王黎庶都斋戒。焚香沐浴告天公，万里全无云叆叇。百姓饥荒若倒悬，锺南忽降全真怪。呼风唤雨显神通，然后暗将他命害。推下花园水井中，阴侵龙位人难解。幸吾来，功果大，起死回生无挂碍。情愿皈依作行童，与僧同去朝西界。假变君王是道人，道人转是真王代。”那魔王在金銮殿上，闻得这一篇言语，唬得他心头撞小鹿，面上起红云，急抽身就要走路，奈何手内无一兵器，转回头，只见一个镇殿将军，腰挎一口宝刀，被行者使了定身法，直挺挺如痴如痖，立在那里，他近前，夺了这宝刀，就驾云头望空而去。气得沙和尚爆躁如雷，猪八戒高声喊叫，埋怨行者是一个急猴子：“你就慢说些儿，却不稳住他了？如今他驾云逃走，却往何处追寻？”行者笑道：“兄弟们且莫乱嚷。我等叫那太子下来拜父，嫔后出来拜夫。”却又念个咒语，解了定身法，“教那多官苏醒回来拜君，方知是真实皇帝，教诉前情，才见分晓，我再去寻他。好大圣，吩咐八戒、沙僧：“好生保护他君臣父子嫔后与我师父！”只听说声去，就不见形影。</p>

<p>他原来跳在九霄云里，睁眼四望，看那魔王哩。只见那畜果逃了性命，径往东北上走哩。行者赶得将近，喝道：“那怪物，那里去！老孙来了也！”那魔王急回头，掣出宝刀，高叫道：“孙行者，你好惫懒！我来占别人的帝位，与你无干，你怎么来抱不平，泄漏我的机密！”行者呵呵笑道：“我把你大胆的泼怪！皇帝又许你做？你既知我是老孙，就该远遁；怎么还刁难我师父，要取甚么供状！适才那供状是也不是？你不要走！好汉吃我老孙这一棒！”那魔侧身躲过，掣宝刀劈面相还。他两个搭上手，这一场好杀，真是：猴王猛，魔王强，刀迎棒架敢相当。一天云雾迷三界，只为当朝立帝王。他两个战经数合，那妖魔抵不住猴王，急回头复从旧路跳入城里，闯在白玉阶前两班文武丛中，摇身一变，即变得与唐三藏一般模样，并搀手，立在阶前。</p>

<p>这大圣赶上，就欲举棒来打，那怪道：“徒弟莫打，是我！”急掣棒要打那个唐僧，却又道：“徒弟莫打，是我！”一样两个唐僧，实难辨认。“倘若一棒打杀妖怪变的唐僧，这个也成了功果；假若一棒打杀我的真实师父，却怎么好！”只得停手，叫八戒、沙僧问道：“果然那一个是怪，那一个是我的师父？你指与我，我好打他。”八戒道：“你在半空中相打相嚷，我瞥瞥眼就见两个师父，也不知谁真谁假。”行者闻言，捻诀念声咒语，叫那护法诸天、六丁六甲、五方揭谛、四值功曹、一十八位护驾伽蓝、当坊土地、本境山神道：“老孙至此降妖，妖魔变作我师父，气体相同，实难辨认。汝等暗中知会者，请师父上殿，让我擒魔。”原来那妖怪善腾云雾，听得行者言语，急撒手跳上金銮宝殿。这行者举起棒望唐僧就打。可怜！若不是唤那几位神来，这一下，就是二千个唐僧，也打为肉酱！多亏众神架住铁棒道：“大圣，那怪会腾云，先上殿去了。”行者赶上殿，他又跳将下来扯住唐僧，在人丛里又混了一混，依然难认。</p>

<p>行者心中不快，又见那八戒在旁冷笑，行者大怒道：“你这夯货怎的？如今有两个师父，你有得叫，有得应，有得伏侍哩，你这般欢喜得紧！”八戒笑道：“哥啊，说我呆，你比我又呆哩！</p>

<p>师父既不认得，何劳费力？你且忍些头疼，叫我师父念念那话儿，我与沙僧各搀一个听着。若不会念的，必是妖怪，有何难也？”行者道：“兄弟，亏你也，正是，那话儿只有三人记得。原是我佛如来心苗上所发，传与观世音菩萨，菩萨又传与我师父，便再没人知道。也罢，师父，念念。”真个那唐僧就念起来。那魔王怎么知得，口里胡哼乱哼。八戒道：“这哼的却是妖怪了！”</p>

<p>他放了手，举钯就筑。那魔王纵身跳起，踏着云头便走。好八戒，喝一声，也驾云头赶上，慌得那沙和尚丢了唐僧，也掣出宝杖来打，唐僧才停了咒语。孙大圣忍着头疼，揝着铁棒，赶在空中。呀！这一场，三个狠和尚，围住一个泼妖魔。那魔王被八戒沙僧使钉钯宝杖左右攻住了，行者笑道：“我要再去，当面打他，他却有些怕我，只恐他又走了。等我老孙跳高些，与他个捣蒜打，结果了他罢。”</p>

<p>这大圣纵祥光，起在九霄，正欲下个切手，只见那东北上，一朵彩云里面，厉声叫道：“孙悟空，且休下手！”行者回头看处，原来文殊菩萨，急收棒，上前施礼道：“菩萨，那里去？”文殊道：“我来替你收这个妖怪的。”行者谢道：“累烦了。”那菩萨袖中取出照妖镜，照住了那怪的原身。行者才招呼八戒、沙僧齐来见了菩萨。却将镜子里看处，那魔王生得好不凶恶：眼似琉璃盏，头若炼炒缸。浑身三伏靛，四爪九秋霜。搭拉两个耳，一尾扫帚长。青毛生锐气，红眼放金光。匾牙排玉板，圆须挺硬枪。镜里观真象，原是文殊一个狮猁王。行者道：“菩萨，这是你坐下的一个青毛狮子，却怎么走将来成精，你就不收服他？”</p>

<p>菩萨道：“悟空，他不曾走，他是佛旨差来的。”行者道：“这畜类成精，侵夺帝位，还奉佛旨差来。似老孙保唐僧受苦，就该领几道敕书！”菩萨道：“你不知道；当初这乌鸡国王，好善斋僧，佛差我来度他归西，早证金身罗汉。因是不可原身相见，变做一种凡僧，问他化些斋供。被吾几句言语相难，他不识我是个好人，把我一条绳捆了，送在那御水河中，浸了我三日三夜。多亏六甲金身救我归西，奏与如来、如来将此怪令到此处推他下井，浸他三年，以报吾三日水灾之恨。一饮一啄，莫非前定。今得汝等来此，成了功绩。”行者道：“你虽报了甚么一饮一啄的私仇，但那怪物不知害了多少人也。”菩萨道：“也不曾害人，自他到后，这三年间，风调雨顺，国泰民安，何害人之有？”行者道：“固然如此，但只三宫娘娘，与他同眠同起，点污了他的身体，坏了多少纲常伦理，还叫做不曾害人？”菩萨道：“点污他不得，他是个骗了的狮子。”八戒闻言，走近前，就摸了一把，笑道：“这妖精真个是糟鼻子不吃酒——枉担其名了！”行者道：“既如此，收了去罢。若不是菩萨亲来，决不饶他性命。”那菩萨却念个咒，喝道：“畜生，还不皈正，更待何时！”那魔王才现了原身。菩萨放莲花罩定妖魔，坐在背上，踏祥光辞了行者。咦！</p>

<p>径转五台山上去，宝莲座下听谈经。毕竟不知那唐僧师徒怎的出城，且听下回分解。</p>
