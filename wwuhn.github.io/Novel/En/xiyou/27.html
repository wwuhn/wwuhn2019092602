<P>Sun Wukong Looks for the Formula in the Three Islands</P>
<P>Guanyin Revives the Tree with a Spring of Sweet Water</P>
</div>
<P>As the poem goes,</P>
<P>When living in the world you must be forbearing;</P>
<P>Patience is essential when training oneself.</P>
<P>Although it's often said that violence is good business,</P>
<P>Think before you act, and never bully or be angry.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>True gentlemen who never strive are famed for ever;</P>
<P>The virtue-loving sages are renowned to this day.</P>
<P>Strong men always meet stronger than themselves,</P>
<P>And end up as failures who are in the wrong.</P>

<P>The Great Immortal Zhen Yuan held Monkey in his hand and said, &#8220;I've heard about your powers and your fame, but this time you have gone too far. Even if you manage to remove yourself, you won't escape my clutches. You and I shall argue it out as far as the Western Heaven, and even if you see that Buddha of yours, you'll still have to give me back my manfruit tree first. Don't try any of your magic now.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a small-minded bloke you are, sir,&#8221; Monkey replied with a laugh. &#8220;If you want your tree brought back to life, there's no problem. If you'd told me earlier we could have been spared all this quarrelling.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you hadn't made trouble I'd have forgiven you,&#8221; said the Great Immortal.</P>
<P>&#8220;Would you agree to release my master if I gave you back the tree alive?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;If your magic is strong enough to revive the tree,&#8221; the Great Immortal replied, &#8220;I shall bow to you eight times and take you as my brother.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's easy then,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Release them and I guarantee to give you back your tree alive.&#8221;</P>
<P>Trusting him not to escape, the Great Immortal ordered that Sanzang, Pig and Friar Sand be set free. &#8220;Master,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;I wonder what sort of trick Monkey is up to.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll tell you what sort of trick,&#8221; retorted Pig. &#8220;A pleading for favour trick. The tree's dead and can't possibly be revived. Finding a cure for the tree is an excuse for going off by himself without giving a damn for you or me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He wouldn't dare abandon us,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;Let's ask him where he's going to find a doctor for it. Monkey,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;why did you fool the Immortal elder into untying us?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Every word I said was true,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;I wasn't leading him on.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where will you go to find a cure?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's an old saying that 'cures come from over the sea'. I'll go to the Eastern Sea and travel round the Three Islands and Ten Continents visiting the venerable Immortals and sages to find a formula for bringing the dead back to life. I promise that I'll cure that tree.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When will you come back?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll only need three days.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case I'll give you three days. If you are back within that time, that will be all right, but if you are late I shall recite that spell.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll do as you say,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>He immediately straightened up his tiger-skin kilt, went out through the door, and said to the Great Immortal, &#8220;Don't worry, sir, I'll soon be back. Mind you look after my master well. Give him tea three times a day and six meals, and don't leave any out. If you do, I'll settle that score when I come back, and I'll start by holing the bottoms of all your pans. If his clothes get dirty, wash them for him. I won't stand for it if he looks sallow, and if he loses weight you'll never see the back of me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Go away, go away,&#8221; the Great Immortal replied. &#8220;I certainly won't let him go hungry.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Monkey King left the Wuzhuang Temple with a bound of his somersault cloud and headed for the Eastern Sea. He went through the air as fast as a flash of lightning or a shooting star, and he was soon in the blessed land of Penglai. As he landed his cloud he looked around him and saw that it was indeed a wonderful place. A poem about it goes:</P>
<div class="poet">
<P>A great and sacred land where the Immortal sages</P>
<P>Still the waves as they come and go.</P>
<P>The shade of the jasper throne cools the heart of the sky;</P>
<P>The radiance of the great gate-pillars shimmers high above the sea.</P>
<P>Hidden in the coloured mists are flutes of jade;</P>
<P>The moon and the stars shine on the golden leviathan.</P>
<P>The Queen Mother of the Western Pool often comes here</P>
<P>To give her peaches to the Three Immortals.</P>
</div>
<P>Gazing at the enchanted land that spread out before him, Brother Monkey entered Penglai. As he was walking along, he noticed three old men sitting round a chess table under the shade of a pine tree outside a cloud-wreathed cave. The one watching the game was the Star of Longevity, and the players were the Star of Blessings and the Star of Office.</P>
<P>&#8220;Greetings, respected younger brothers,&#8221; Monkey called to them, and when they saw him they swept the pieces away, returned his salutation, and said, &#8220;Why have you come here, Great Sage?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;To see you,&#8221; he replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;I've heard,&#8221; said the Star of Longevity, &#8220;that you have given up the Way for the sake of the Buddha, and have thrown aside your life to protect the Tang Priest on his journey to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven. How can you spare the time from your endless crossings of waters and mountains just to see us?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;To tell you the truth,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;I was on my way to the West until a spot of bother held us up. I wonder if you could do me a small favour.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where did this happen?&#8221; asked the Star of Blessings, &#8220;what has been holding you up? Please tell us and we'll deal with it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We've been held up because we went via the Wuzhuang Temple on the Mountain of Infinite Longevity,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;But the Wuzhuang Temple is the palace of the Great Immortal Zhen Yuan,&#8221; exclaimed the three Immortals with alarm, &#8220;don't say that you've stolen some of his manfruit!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What if I had stolen and eaten some?&#8221; asked Monkey with a grin.</P>
<P>&#8220;You ignorant ape,&#8221; the three Immortals replied. &#8220;A mere whiff of that fruit makes a man live to be three hundred and sixty, and anyone who eats one will live forty-seven thousand years. They are called 'Grass-returning Cinnabar of Ten Thousand Longevities,' and our Way hasn't a patch on them. Manfruit makes you as immortal as Heaven with the greatest of ease, while it takes us goodness knows how long to nourish our essence, refine the spirit, preserve our soul, harmonize water and fire, capture the<I> kan</I> to fill out the<I> li.</I> How can you possibly ask whether it would matter? There is no other miraculous tree like it on earth.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Miraculous tree,&#8221; scoffed Monkey, &#8220;miraculous tree! I've put an end to that miraculous tree.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What? Put an end to it?&#8221; the three Immortals asked, struck with horror.</P>
<P>&#8220;When I was in his temple the other day,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;the Great Immortal wasn't at home. There were only a couple of boys who received my master and gave him two manfruits. My master didn't know what they were and said that they were newborn babies; he refused to eat them. The boys took them away and ate them themselves instead of offering them to the rest of us, so I went and pinched three, one for each of us disciples. Those disrespectful boys swore and cursed at us no end, which made me so angry that I knocked their tree over with a single blow. All the fruit disappeared, the leaves fell, the roots came out, and the branches were smashed up. The tree was dead. To our surprise the two boys locked us in, but I opened the lock and we escaped. When the Great Immortal came home the next day, he came after us and found us. Our conversation didn't go too smoothly and we started to fight him, but he dodged us, spread his sleeve out, and caught us all up in it. After being tied up then flogged and interrogated for a day, we escaped again, but he caught up with us and captured us again. Although he had not an inch of steel on him, he fought us off with his whisk, and even with our three weapons we couldn't touch him. He caught us the same way as before. He had my master and two brothers wrapped up in bandages and lacquered, and was going to throw me into a cauldron of oil, but I used a trick to take my body away and escape, smashing that pan of his. Now that he has realized he can't catch me and keep me he's getting a bit scared of me, and I had a good talk with him. I told him that if he released my master and my brothers I'd guarantee to cure the tree and bring it back to life, which would satisfy both parties. As it occurred to me that 'cures come from over the sea,' I came here specially to visit you three brothers of mine. If you have any cures that will bring a tree back to life, please tell me one so that I can get the Tang Priest out of trouble as quickly as possible.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You ape,&#8221; the Three Stars said gloomily when they heard this. &#8220;You don't know who you're up against. That Master Zhen Yuan is the Patriarch of the Immortals of the earth, and we are the chiefs of the divine Immortals. Although you have become a heavenly Immortal, you are still only one of the irregulars of the Great Monad, not one of the elite. You'll never be able to escape his clutches. If you'd killed some animal, bird, insect or reptile, Great Sage, we could have given you some pills made from sticky millet to bring it back to life, but that manfruit tree is a magic one and can't possibly be revived. There's no cure, none at all.&#8221; When he heard that there was no cure, Monkey's brows locked in a frown, and his forehead was creased in a thousand wrinkles.</P>
<P>&#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; said the Star of Blessing, &#8220;even though we have no cure here, there may be one somewhere else. Why be so worried?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If there were anywhere else for me to go,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;it would be easy. It wouldn't even matter if I had to go to the furthest corner of the ocean, or to the cliff at the end of the sky, or if I had to penetrate the Thirty-sixth Heaven. But the trouble is that the Tang Patriarch is very strict and has given me a time-limit of three days. If I'm not back in three days he'll recite the Band-tightening Spell.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Splendid, splendid,&#8221; laughed the three stars. &#8220;If you weren't restricted by that spell you'd go up to Heaven again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Calm down, Great Sage,&#8221; said the Star of Longevity, &#8220;there's no need to worry. Although that Great Immortal is senior to us he is a friend of ours, and as we haven't visited him for a long time and would like to do you a favour we'll go and see him. We'll explain things for you and tell that Tang monk not to recite the Band-tightening Spell. We won't go away until you come back, however long you take, even if it's a lot longer that three to five days.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Thank you very much,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;May I ask you to set out now as I'm off?&#8221; With that he took his leave.</P>
<P>The Three Stars went off on beams of auspicious light to the Wuzhuang Temple, where all present heard cranes calling in the sky as the three of them arrived.</P>
<div class="poet">
<P>The void was bathed in blessed glow,</P>
<P>The Milky Way heavy with fragrance.</P>
<P>A thousand wisps of coloured mist enveloped the feather-clad ones;</P>
<P>A single cloud supported the immortal feet.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Green and red phoenixes circled and soared,</P>
<P>As the aroma in their sleeves wafted over the earth.</P>
<P>These dragons leant on their staffs and smiled,</P>
<P>And jade-white beards waved before their chests.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Their youthful faces were untroubled by sorrow,</P>
<P>Their majestic bodies were rich with blessing.</P>
<P>They carried star-chips to count their age,</P>
<P>And at their waists hung gourds and talismans.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Their life is infinitely long,</P>
<P>And they live on the Ten Continents and Three Islands.</P>
<P>They often come to bring blessings to mortals,</P>
<P>Spreading good things a hundred-fold among humans.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The glory and blessings of the universe</P>
<P>Come now as happiness unlimited.</P>
<P>As these three elders visit the Great Immortal on auspicious light,</P>
<P>There is no end to good fortune and peace.</P>
</div>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; the immortal youths rushed to report when they saw them, &#8220;the Three Stars from the sea are here.&#8221; The Great Immortal Zhen Yuan, who was talking with the Tang Priest, came down the steps to welcome them when he heard this.</P>
<P>When Pig saw the Star of Longevity he went up and tugged at his clothes. &#8220;I haven't seen you for ages, you meat-headed old fellow,&#8221; he said with a grin. &#8220;You're getting very free and easy, turning up without a hat.&#8221; With these words he thrust his own clerical hat on the star's head, clapped his hands, and roared with laughter. &#8220;Great, great. You've been 'capped and promoted' all right.&#8221; Flinging the hat down, the Star of Longevity cursed him for a disrespectful moron.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm no moron,&#8221; said Pig, but you're all slaves.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're most certainly a moron,&#8221; the Star of Blessing replied, &#8220;so how dare you call us slaves?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you aren't slaves then,&#8221; Pig retorted, &#8220;why do people always ask you to 'bring us long life,' 'bring us blessings,' and 'bring us a good job?'&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang shouted at Pig to go away, then quickly tidied himself up and bowed to the Three Stars. The Three Stars greeted the Great Immortal as befitted members of a younger generation, after which they all sat down. &#8220;We have not seen your illustrious countenance for a long time,&#8221; the Star of Office said, &#8220;which shows our great lack of respect. The reason we come to see you now is because the Great Sage Monkey has made trouble in your immortal temple.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Has Monkey been to Penglai?&#8221; the Great Immortal asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the Star of Longevity. &#8220;He came to our place to ask for a formula to restore the elixir tree that he killed. As we have no cure for it, he has had to go elsewhere in search of it. We are afraid that if he exceeds the three-day time-limit the holy priest has imposed, the Band-tightening Spell may be said. We have come in the first place to pay our respects and in the second to ask for an extension of the limit.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I won't recite it, I promise,&#8221; answered Sanzang as soon as he heard this.</P>
<P>As they were talking Pig came rushing in again to grab hold of the Star of Blessing and demand some fruit from him. He started to feel in the star's sleeves and rummage round his waist, pulling his clothes apart as he searched everywhere.</P>
<P>&#8220;What sort of behavior is that?&#8221; asked Sanzang with a smile.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm not misbehaving,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;This is what's meant by the saying, 'blessings wherever you look.'&#8220; Sanzang shouted at him to go away again. The idiot withdrew slowly, glaring at the Star of Blessing with unwavering hatred in his eyes.</P>
<P>&#8220;I wasn't angry with you, you moron,&#8221; said the star, &#8220;so why do you hate me so?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I don't hate you,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;This is what they call 'turning the head and seeing blessing.'&#8220; As the idiot was going out he saw a young boy came in with four tea ladles, looking for bowls in the abbot's cell in which to put fruit and serve tea. Pig seized one of the ladles, ran to the main hall of the temple, snatched up a hand-bell, and started striking it wildly. He was enjoying himself enormously when the Great Immortal said, &#8220;This monk gets more and more disrespectful.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm not being disrespectful,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;I'm 'ringing in happiness for the four seasons.'&#8221;</P>
<P>While Pig was having his jokes and making trouble, Monkey had bounded away from Penglai by auspicious cloud and come to the magic mountain Fangzhang. This was a really wonderful place. As the poem goes,</P>
<div class="poet">
<P>The towering Fangzhang is another heaven,</P>
<P>Where gods and Immortals meet in the Palace of the Great Unity.</P>
<P>The purple throne illuminates the road to the Three Pure Ones,</P>
<P>The scent of flowers and trees drifts among the clouds.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Many a golden phoenix comes to rejoice around its flowery portals;</P>
<P>What makes the fields of magical mushrooms glisten like jade?</P>
<P>Pale peaches and purple plums are newly ripened,</P>
<P>Ready to give even longer life to the Immortals.</P>
</div>
<P>But as Monkey brought his cloud down he was in no mood to enjoy the view. As he was walking along he smelt a fragrance in the wind, heard the cry of the black stork, and saw an Immortal:</P>
<div class="poet">
<P>The sky was filled with radiant light,</P>
<P>As multicolored clouds shone and glowed.</P>
<P>Red phoenixes looked brighter than the flowers in their beaks;</P>
<P>Sweetly sang green ones as they danced in flight.</P>
<P>His blessings were as great as the Eastern Sea, his age that of a mountain;</P>
<P>Yet his face was a child's and his body was strong.</P>
<P>In a bottle he kept his pills of eternal youth,</P>
<P>And a charm for everlasting life hung from his waist.</P>
<P>He had often sent blessings down to mankind,</P>
<P>Several times saving mortals from difficulties.</P>
<P>He once gave longer life to Emperor Wu,</P>
<P>And always went to the Peach Banquets at the Jade Pool.</P>
<P>He taught all monks to cast off worldly fates;</P>
<P>His explanations of the great Way were clear as lightning.</P>
<P>He had crossed the seas to pay his respects,</P>
<P>And had seen the Buddha on the Vulture Peak.</P>
<P>His title was Lord Emperor of Eastern Glory,</P>
<P>The highest-ranked Immortal of the mists and clouds.</P>
</div>
<P>When Brother Monkey saw him he hailed him with the words, &#8220;I salute you, Lord Emperor.&#8221; The Lord Emperor hastened to return his greeting and say, &#8220;I should have welcomed you properly, Great Sage. May I ask you home for some tea?&#8221; He led Monkey by the hand to his palace of cowrie-shells, where there was no end of jasper pools and jade towers. They were sitting waiting for their tea when a boy appeared from behind an emerald screen. This is how he looked:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A Taoist robe that sparkled with color hung from his body,</P>
<P>And light gleamed from the silken sash round his waist.</P>
<P>On his head he wore a turban with the sign of the stars of the Dipper,</P>
<P>And the grass sandals on his feet had climbed all the magical mountains.</P>
<P>He was refining his True Being, shuffling off his shell,</P>
<P>And when he had finished he would reach unbounded bliss.</P>
<P>His understanding had broken through to the origins,</P>
<P>And his master knew that he was free from mistakes.</P>
<P>Avoiding fame and enjoying the present he had won long life</P>
<P>And did not care about the passing of time.</P>
<P>He had been along the crooked portico, climbed to the precious hall,</P>
<P>And three times received the peaches of Heaven.</P>
<P>Clouds of incense appeared to rise from behind the emerald screen;</P>
<P>This young Immortal was Dongfang Shuo himself.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;So you're here, you young thief,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile when he saw him. &#8220;There are no peaches for you to steal here in the Lord Emperor's palace.&#8221;</P>
<P>Dongfang Shuo greeted him respectfully and replied, &#8220;What have you come for, you old thief? My master doesn't keep any pills of immortality here for you to pinch.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop talking nonsense, Manqian,&#8221; the Lord Emperor shouted, &#8220;and bring some tea.&#8221; Manqian was Dongfang Shuo's Taoist name. He hurried inside and brought out two cups of tea.</P>
<P>When the two of them had drunk it, Monkey said, &#8220;I came here to ask you to do something for me. I wonder if you'd be prepared to.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; the Lord Emperor asked. &#8220;Do tell me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have been escorting the Tang Priest on his journey to the West,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and our route took us via the Wuzhuang Temple on the Mountain of Infinite Longevity. The youths there were so ill-mannered that I lost my temper and knocked their manfruit tree over. We've been held up for a while as a result, and the Tang Priest cannot get away, which is why I have come to ask you, sir, to give me a formula that will cure it. I do hope that you will be good enough to agree.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You thoughtless ape,&#8221; the Lord Emperor replied, &#8220;you make trouble wherever you go. Master Zhen Yuan of the Wuzhunang Temple has the sacred title Conjoint Lord of the Age, and he is the Patriarch of the Immortals of the Earth. Why ever did you clash with him? That manfruit tree of his is Grass-returning Cinnabar. It was criminal enough of you to steal some of the fruit, and knocking the tree over makes it impossible for him ever to make it up with you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;True,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;When we escaped he caught up with us and swept us into his sleeve as if we were so many sweat-rags, which made me furious. However, he had to let me go and look for a formula that would cure it, which is why I've come to ask your help.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have a nine-phased returning pill of the Great Monad, but it can only bring animate objects back to life, not trees. Trees are lives compounded of the Wood and Earth elements and nurtured by Heaven and Earth. If it were an ordinary mortal tree I could bring it back to life, but the Mountain of Infinite Longevity is the blessed land of a former heaven, the Wuzhuang Temple is the Cave Paradise of the Western Continent of Cattle-gift, and the manfruit tree is the life-root from the time when Heaven and Earth were separated. How could it possibly be revived? I have no formula, none at all.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case I must take my leave,&#8221; replied Monkey, and when the Lord Emperor tried to detain him with a cup of jade nectar he said, &#8220;This is too urgent to allow me to stay.&#8221; He rode his cloud back to the island of Yingzhou, another wonderful place, as this poem shows:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Trees of pearls glowed with a purple haze;</P>
<P>The Yingzhou palaces led straight to the heavens.</P>
<P>Blue hills, green rivers, and the beauty of exquisite flowers;</P>
<P>Jade mountains as hard as iron.</P>
<P>Pheasants called at the sunrise over the sea,</P>
<P>Long-lived phoenixes breathe in the red clouds.</P>
<P>People, do not look so hard at the scenery in your jar:</P>
<P>Beyond the world of phenomena is an eternal spring.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On reaching Yingzhou he saw a number of white-haired Immortals with the faces of children playing chess and drinking under a pearl tree at the foot of a cinnabar cliff. They were laughing and singing. As the poem says, there were</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Light-filled auspicious clouds,</P>
<P>Perfume floating in a blessed haze.</P>
<P>Brilliant phoenixes singing at the mouth of a cave,</P>
<P>Black cranes dancing on a mountain top.</P>
<P>Pale green lotus-root and peaches helped their wine down,</P>
<P>Pears and fiery red dates gave them a thousand years of life.</P>
<P>Neither of them had ever heard an imperial edict,</P>
<P>But each was entered on the list of Immortals.</P>
<P>They drifted and floated with the waves,</P>
<P>Free and easy in unsullied elegance.</P>
<P>The passage of the days could not affect them;</P>
<P>Their freedom was guaranteed by Heaven and Earth.</P>
<P>Black apes come in pairs,</P>
<P>Looking most charming as they present fruit;</P>
<P>White deer, bowing two by two,</P>
<P>Thoughtfully offer flowers.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>These old men were certainly living a free and happy life. &#8220;How about letting me play with you?&#8221; Monkey shouted at the top of his voice, and when the Immortals saw him they hurried over to welcome him. There is a poem to prove it that goes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the magic root of the manfruit tree was broken;</P>
<P>The Great Sage visited the Immortals in search of a cure.</P>
<P>Winding their way through the vermilion mist, the Nine Ancients</P>
<P>Came out of the precious forest to greet him.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey, who knew the Nine Ancients, said with a smile, &#8220;You nine brothers seem to be doing very nicely.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you had stayed on straight and narrow in the old days, Great sage,&#8221; they replied, &#8220;and not wrecked the Heavenly Palace you would be doing even better that we are. Now we hear that you have reformed and are going West to visit the Buddha. How did you manage the time off to come here?&#8221; Monkey told them how he was searching for a formula to cure the tree.</P>
<P>&#8220;What a terrible thing to do,&#8221; they exclaimed in horror, &#8220;what a terrible thing. We honestly have no cure at all.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case I must take my leave of you.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Nine Ancients tried to detain him with jasper wine and jade lotus-root, but Monkey refused to sit down, and stayed on his feet while he drank only one cup of wine and ate only one piece of lotus-root. Then he hurried away from Yingzhou and back to the Great Eastern Ocean. When he saw that Potaraka was not far away, he brought his cloud down to land on the Potara Crag, where he saw the Bodhisattva Guanyin expounding the scriptures and preaching the Buddha's Law to all the great gods of heaven, Moksa, and the dragon maiden in the Purple Bamboo Grove. A poem about it goes:</P>
<P>Thick the mists round the lofty city of the sea's mistress,</P>
<P>And no end to the greater marvels to be seen.</P>
<P>The Shaolin Temple really has the true flavor,</P>
<P>With the scent of flowers and fruit and the trees all red.</P>
<P>The Bodhisattva saw Monkey arrive and ordered the Great Guardian God of the Mountain to go and welcome him. The god emerged from the bamboo grove and shouted, &#8220;Where are you going, Monkey?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You bear monster,&#8221; Monkey shouted back, &#8220;how dare you address me as 'Monkey'? If I hadn't spared your life that time you'd have been just a demon's corpse on the Black Wind Mountain. Now you've joined the Bodhisattva, accepted enlightenment, and come to live on this blessed island where you hear the Law being taught all the time. Shouldn't you address me as 'sir?'&#8221;</P>
<P>It was indeed thanks to Monkey that the black bear had been enlightened and was now guarding the Bodhisattva's Potaraka as one of the great gods of heaven, so all he could do was to force a smile and say, &#8220;The ancients said, Great Sage, that a gentleman does not bear grudges. Why should you care about what you're called? Anyhow, the Bodhisattva has sent me to welcome you.&#8221; Monkey then became grave and serious as he went into the Purple Bamboo Grove with the Great God and did obeisance to the Bodhisattva.</P>
<P>&#8220;How far has the Tang Priest got, Monkey?&#8221; she asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;He has reached the Mountain of Infinite Longevity in the Western Continent of Cattle-gift,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Have you met the Great Immortal Zhen Yuan who lives in the Wuzhuang Temple on that mountain?&#8221; she asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;As your disciple didn't meet the Great Immortal Zhen Yuan when I was in the Wuzhuang Temple,&#8221; replied Monkey, bowing down to the ground, &#8220;I destroyed his manfruit tree and offended him. As a result my master is in a very difficult position and can make no progress.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You wretched ape,&#8221; said the Bodhisattva angrily now that she knew about it, &#8220;you have no conscience at all. That manfruit tree of his is the life-root from the time when Heaven and Earth were separated, and Master Zhen Yuan is the Patriarch of the Earth's Immortals, which means even I have to show him a certain respect. Why ever did you harm his tree?&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey bowed once more and said, &#8220;I really didn't know. He was away that day and there were only two immortal youths to look after us. When Pig heard that they had this fruit he wanted to try one, so I stole three for him and we had one each. They swore at us no end when they found out, so I lost my temper and knocked the tree over. When he came back the next day he chased us and caught us all up in his sleeve. We were tied up and flogged for a whole day. We got away that night but he caught up with us and put us in his sleeve again. All our escape attempts failed, so I promised him I'd put the tree right. I've been searching for a formula all over the seas and been to all three islands of Immortals, but the gods and Immortals are all useless, which is why I decided to come and worship you, Bodhisattva, and tell you all about it. I beg you in your mercy to grant me a formula so that I can save the Tang Priest and have him on his way West again as soon as possible.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why didn't you come and see me earlier instead of searching the islands for it?&#8221; the Bodhisattva asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm in luck,&#8221; thought Monkey with delight when he heard this, &#8220;I'm in luck. The Bodhisattva must have a formula.&#8221; He went up to her and pleaded for it again.</P>
<P>&#8220;The 'sweet dew' in this pure vase of mine,&#8221; she said, &#8220;is an excellent cure for magic trees and plants.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Has it ever been tried out?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;How?&#8221; he asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Some years ago Lord Lao Zi beat me at gambling,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;and took my willow sprig away with him. He put it in his elixir-refining furnace and burnt it to a cinder before sending it back to me. I put it back in the vase, and a day and a night later it was as green and leafy as ever.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm really in luck,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;really in luck. If it can bring a cinder back to life, something that has only been pushed over should be easy.&#8221; The Bodhisattva instructed her subjects to look after the grove as she was going away for a while. Then she took up her vase, and her white parrot went in front singing while Monkey followed behind. As the poem goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The jade-haired golden one is hard to describe to mortals;</P>
<P>She truly is a compassionate deliverer.</P>
<P>Although in aeons past she had known the spotless Buddha,</P>
<P>Now she had acquired a human form.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After several lives in the sea of suffering she had purified the waves,</P>
<P>And in her heart there was no speck of dust.</P>
<P>The sweet dew that had long undergone the miraculous Law</P>
<P>Was bound to give the magic tree eternal life.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Great Immortal and the Three Stars were still in lofty conversation when they saw Monkey bring his cloud down and heard him shout, &#8220;The Bodhisattva's here. Come and welcome her at once.&#8221; The Three Stars and Master Zheng Yuan hurried out with Sanzang and his disciples to greet her. On bringing her cloud to a stop, she first talked with Master Zhen Yuan and then greeted the Three Stars, after which she climbed to her seat. Monkey then led the Tang Priest, Pig, and Friar Sand out to do obeisance before the steps, and all the Immortals in the temple came to bow to her as well.</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no need to dither about, Great Immortal,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Get an incense table ready at once and ask the Bodhisattva to cure that whatever-it-is tree of yours.&#8221; The Great Immortal Zhen Yuan bowed to the Bodhisattva and thanked her:</P>
<P>&#8220;How could I be so bold as to trouble the Bodhisattva with my affairs?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The Tang Priest is my disciple, and Monkey has offended you, so it is only right that I should make up for the loss of your priceless tree.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case there is no need for you to refuse,&#8221; said the Three Stars. &#8220;May we invite you, Bodhisattva, to come into our orchard and take a look?&#8221;</P>
<P>The Great Sage had an incense table set up and the orchard swept, then he asked the Bodhisattva to lead the way. The Three Stars followed behind. Sanzang, his disciples, and all the Immortals of the temple went into the orchard to look, and they saw the tree lying on the ground with the earth torn open, its roots laid bare, its leaves fallen and its branches withered. &#8220;Put your hand out, Monkey,&#8221; said the Bodhisattva, and Brother Monkey stretched out his left hand. The Bodhisattva dipped her willow spray into the sweet dew in her vase, then used it to write a spell to revive the dead on the palm of Monkey's hand. She told him to place it on the roots of the tree until he saw water coming out. Monkey clenched his fist and tucked it under the roots; before long a spring of clear water began to form a pool.</P>
<P>&#8220;That water must not be sullied by vessels made of any of the Five Elements, so you will have to scoop it out with a jade ladle. If you prop the tree up and pour the water on it from the very top, its bark and trunk will knit together, its leaves will sprout again, the branches will be green once more, and the fruit will reappear.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Fetch a jade ladle this moment, young Taoists,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;We poor monks have no jade ladle in our destitute temple. We only have jade tea-bowls and wine-cups. Would they do?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As long as they are jade and can scoop out water they will do,&#8221; the Bodhisattva replied. &#8220;Bring them out and try.&#8221; The Great Immortal then told some boys to fetch the twenty or thirty teabowls and the forty or fifty wine-cups and ladle the clear water out from under the roots. Monkey, Pig and Friar Sand put their shoulders under the tree, raised it upright, and banked it up with earth. Then they presented the sweet spring water cup by cup to the Bodhisattva, who sprinkled it lightly on the tree with her spray of willow and recited an incantation. When a little later the water had all been sprinkled on the tree the leaves really did become as dense and green as ever, and there were twenty-three manfruits growing there.</P>
<P>Pure Wind and Bright Moon, the two immortal boys, said, &#8220;When the fruit disappeared the other day there were only twenty-two of them; so why is there an extra one now that it has come back to life?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;'Time shows the truth about a man,'&#8220; Monkey replied. &#8220;I only stole three that day. The other one fell on the ground, and the local deity told me that this treasure always entered earth when it touched it. Pig accused me of taking it as a bit of extra for myself and blackened my reputation, but at long last the truth has come out.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The reason why I did not use vessels made from the Five Elements was because I knew that this kind of fruit is allergic to them,&#8221; said the Bodhisattva. The Great Immortal, now extremely happy, had the golden rod fetched at once and knocked down ten of the fruits. He invited the Bodhisattva and the Three Stars to come to the main hall of the temple to take part a Manfruit Feast to thank them for their labors. All the junior Immortals arranged tables, chairs, and cinnabar bowls, The Bodhisattva was asked to take the seat of honour with the Three Stars on her left, the Tang Priest on her right, and Master Zhen Yuan facing her as the host. They ate one fruit each, and there are some lines about it:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In the ancient earthly paradise on the Mountain of Infinite Longevity</P>
<P>The manfruit ripens once in nine thousand years.</P>
<P>When the magic roots were bared and the branches dead,</P>
<P>The sweet dew brought leaves and fruit back to life.</P>
<P>The happy meeting of the Three Stars was predestined;</P>
<P>It was fated that the four monks would encounter one another.</P>
<P>Now that they have eaten the manfruit at this feast,</P>
<P>They will all enjoy everlasting youth.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Bodhisattva and the Three Stars ate one each, as did the Tang Priest, who realized at last that this was an Immortal's treasure, and Monkey, Pig and Friar Sand. Master Zhen Yuan had one to keep them company and the Immortals of the temple divided the last one between them. Monkey thanked the Bodhisattva, who went back to Potaraka, and saw the Three Stars off on their journey home to the island of Penglai.</P>
<P>Master Zhen Yuan set out some non-alcoholic wine and made Monkey his sworn brother. This was a case of &#8220;if you don't fight you can't make friends,&#8221; and their two households were now united. That night Sanzang and his disciples went to bed feeling very happy. That venerable priest had now</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Been lucky enough to eat the Grass-returning Cinnabar,</P>
<P>Gaining long life, and resistance to fiends and monsters.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Listen to the next installment to hear how they took their leave the next day.</P>	</div>

<p>孙悟空三岛求方</p>
<p>观世音甘泉活树</p>
</div>
<p>诗曰：处世须存心上刃，修身切记寸边而。常言刃字为生意，但要三思戒怒欺。上士无争传亘古，圣人怀德继当时。刚强更有刚强辈，究竟终成空与非。却说那镇元大仙用手搀着行者道：“我也知道你的本事，我也闻得你的英名，只是你今番越理欺心，纵有腾那，脱不得我手。我就和你讲到西天，见了你那佛祖，也少不得还我人参果树。你莫弄神通！”行者笑道：“你这先生好小家子样！若要树活，有甚疑难！早说这话，可不省了一场争竞？”大仙道：“不争竞，我肯善自饶你？”行者道：“你解了我师父，我还你一颗活树如何？”大仙道：“你若有此神通，医得树活，我与你八拜为交，结为兄弟。”行者道：“不打紧，放了他们，老孙管教还你活树。”大仙谅他走不脱，即命解放了三藏、八戒、沙僧。沙僧道：“师父啊，不知师兄捣得是甚么鬼哩。”</p>

<p>八戒道：“甚么鬼！这叫做当面人情鬼！树死了，又可医得活？</p>

<p>他弄个光皮散儿好看，者着求医治树，单单了脱身走路，还顾得你和我哩！”三藏道：“他决不敢撒了我们，我们问他那里求医去。”遂叫道：“悟空，你怎么哄了仙长，解放我等？”行者道：</p>

<p>“老孙是真言实语，怎么哄他？”三藏道：“你往何处去求方？”行者道：“古人云，方从海上来。我今要上东洋大海，遍游三岛十洲，访问仙翁圣老，求一个起死回生之法，管教医得他树活。”</p>

<p>三藏道：“此去几时可回？”行者道：“只消三日。”三藏道：“既如此，就依你说，与你三日之限。三日里来便罢，若三日之外不来，我就念那话儿经了。”行者道：“遵命，遵命。”你看他急整虎皮裙，出门来对大仙道：“先生放心，我就去就来。你却要好生伏侍我师父，逐日家三茶六饭，不可欠缺。若少了些儿，老孙回来和你算帐，先捣塌你的锅底。衣服禳了，与他浆洗浆洗。脸儿黄了些儿，我不要；若瘦了些儿，不出门。”那大仙道：“你去，你去，定不教他忍饿。”</p>

<p>好猴王，急纵觔斗云，别了五庄观，径上东洋大海。在半空中，快如掣电，疾如流星，早到蓬莱仙境。按云头，仔细观看，真个好去处！有诗为证，诗曰：大地仙乡列圣曹，蓬莱分合镇波涛。瑶台影蘸天心冷，巨阙光浮海面高。五色烟霞含玉籁，九霄星月射金鳌。西池王母常来此，奉祝三仙几次桃。那行者看不尽仙景，径入蓬莱。正然走处，见白云洞外，松阴之下，有三个老儿围棋：观局者是寿星，对局者是福星、禄星。行者上前叫道：“老弟们，作揖了。”那三星见了，拂退棋枰，回礼道：“大圣何来？”行者道：“特来寻你们耍子。”寿星道：“我闻大圣弃道从释，脱性命保护唐僧往西天取经，遂日奔波山路，那些儿得闲，却来耍子？”行者道：“实不瞒列位说，老孙因往西方，行在半路，有些儿阻滞，特来小事欲干，不知肯否？”福星道：“是甚地方？是何阻滞？乞为明示，吾好裁处。”行者道：“因路过万寿山五庄观有阻。”三老惊讶道：“五庄观是镇元大仙的仙宫。你莫不是把他人参果偷吃了”行者笑道：“偷吃了能值甚么？”三老道：“你这猴子，不知好歹。那果子闻一闻，活三百六十岁；吃一个，活四万七千年，叫做万寿草还丹。我们的道，不及他多矣！</p>

<p>他得之甚易，就可与天齐寿；我们还要养精、炼气、存神，调和龙虎，捉坎填离，不知费多少工夫。你怎么说他的能值甚紧？天下只有此种灵根！”行者道：“灵根！灵根！我已弄了他个断根哩！”三老惊道：“怎的断根？”行者道：“我们前日在他观里，那大仙不在家，只有两个小童，接待了我师父，却将两个人参果奉与我师。我师不认得，只说是三朝未满的孩童，再三不吃。那童子就拿去吃了，不曾让得我们。是老孙就去偷了他三个，我三兄弟吃了。那童子不知高低，贼前贼后的骂个不住。是老孙恼了，把他树打了一棍，推倒在地，树上果子全无，桠开叶落，根出枝伤，已枯死了。不想那童子关住我们，又被老孙扭开锁走了。次日清晨，那先生回家赶来，问答间，语言不和，遂与他赌斗，被他闪一闪，把袍袖展开，一袖子都笼去了。绳缠索绑，拷问鞭敲，就打了一日。是夜又逃了，他又赶上，依旧笼去。他身无寸铁，只是把个塵尾遮架，我兄弟这等三般兵器，莫想打得着他。这一番仍旧摆布，将布裹滚了我师父与两师弟，却将我下油锅。我又做了个脱身本事走了，把他锅都打破。他见拿我不住，尽有几分醋我。是我又与他好讲，教他放了我师父、师弟，我与他医树管活，两家才得安宁。我想着方从海上来，故此特游仙境，访三位老弟，有甚医树的方儿，传我一个，急救唐僧脱苦。”三星闻言，心中也闷道：“你这猴儿，全不识人。那镇元子乃地仙之祖，我等乃神仙之宗；你虽得了天仙，还是太乙散数，未入真流，你怎么脱得他手？若是大圣打杀了走兽飞禽，蜾虫鳞长，只用我黍米之丹，可以救活。那人参果乃仙木之根，如何医治？没方，没方。”那行者见说无方，却就眉峰双锁，额蹙千痕。福星道：“大圣，此处无方，他处或有，怎么就生烦恼？”行者道：“无方别访，果然容易，就是游遍海角天涯，转透三十六天亦是小可；只是我那唐长老法严量窄，止与了我三日期限。三日以外不到，他就要念那《紧箍儿咒》哩。”三星笑道：“好！好！</p>

<p>好！若不是这个法儿拘束你，你又钻天了。”寿星道：“大圣放心，不须烦恼。那大仙虽称上辈，却也与我等有识。一则久别，不曾拜望；二来是大圣的人情。如今我三人同去望他一望，就与你道达此情，教那唐和尚莫念《紧箍儿咒》，休说三日五日，只等你求得方来，我们才别。”行者道：感激！感激！就请三位老弟行行，我去也。”大圣辞别三星不题。</p>

<p>却说这三星驾起祥光，即往五庄观而来。那观中合众人等，忽听得长天鹤唳，原来是三老光临。但见那：盈空蔼蔼祥光簇，霄汉纷纷香馥郁。彩雾千条护羽衣，轻云一朵擎仙足。青鸾飞，丹凤鷫，袖引香风满地扑。拄杖悬龙喜笑生，皓髯垂玉胸前拂。童颜欢悦更无忧，壮体雄威多有福。执星筹，添海屋，腰挂葫芦并宝箓。万纪千旬福寿长，十洲三岛随缘宿。常来世上送千祥，每向人间增百福。概乾坤，荣福禄，福寿无疆今喜得。</p>

<p>三老乘祥谒大仙，福堂和气皆无极。那仙童看见，即忙报道：</p>

<p>“师父，海上三星来了。”镇元子正与唐僧师弟闲叙，闻报即降阶奉迎。那八戒见了寿星，近前扯住，笑道：“你这肉头老儿，许久不见，还是这般脱洒，帽儿也不带个来。”遂把自家一个僧帽，扑的套在他头上，扑着手呵呵大笑道：“好！好！好！真是加冠进禄也！”那寿星将帽子掼了骂道：“你这个夯货，老大不知高低！”八戒道：“我不是夯货，你等真是奴才！”福星道：“你倒是个夯货，反敢骂人是奴才！”八戒又笑道：“既不是人家奴才，好道叫做添寿、添福、添禄？”那三藏喝退了八戒，急整衣拜了三星。那三星以晚辈之礼见了大仙，方才叙坐。坐定，禄星道：“我们一向久阔尊颜，有失恭敬，今因孙大圣搅扰仙山，特来相见。”大仙道：“孙行者到蓬莱去的？”寿星道：“是，因为伤了大仙的丹树，他来我处求方医治，我辈无方，他又到别处求访，但恐违了圣僧三日之限，要念《紧箍儿咒》。我辈一来奉拜，二来讨个宽限。”三藏闻言，连声应道：“不敢念，不敢念。”正说处，八戒又跑进来，扯住福星，要讨果子吃。他去袖里乱摸，腰里乱吞，不住的揭他衣服搜检。三藏笑道：“那八戒是甚么规矩！”八戒道：“不是没规矩，此叫做番番是福。”三藏又叱令出去，那呆子出门，瞅着福星，眼不转睛的发狠，福星道：“夯货！我那里恼了你来，你这等恨我？”八戒道：“不是恨你，这叫回头望福。”那呆子出得门来，只见一个小童，拿了四把茶匙，方去寻锤取果看茶，被他一把夺过，跑上殿，拿着小磬儿，用手乱敲乱打，两头玩耍。大仙道：“这个和尚，越发不尊重了！”八戒笑道：“不是不尊重，这叫做四时吉庆。”</p>

<p>且不说八戒打诨乱缠，却表行者纵祥云离了蓬莱，又早到方丈仙山。这山真好去处，有诗为证，诗曰：方丈巍峨别是天，太元宫府会神仙。紫台光照三清路，花木香浮五色烟。金凤自多槃蕊阙，玉膏谁逼灌芝田？碧桃紫李新成熟，又换仙人信万年。那行者按落云头，无心玩景，正走处，只闻得香风馥馥，玄鹤声鸣，那壁厢有个神仙，但见：盈空万道霞光现，彩雾飘飖光不断。丹凤衔花也更鲜，青鸾飞舞声娇艳。福如东海寿如山，貌似小童身体健。壶隐洞天不老丹，腰悬与日长生篆。人间数次降祯祥，世上几番消厄愿。武帝曾宣加寿龄，瑶池每赴蟠桃宴。教化众僧脱俗缘，指开大道明如电。也曾跨海祝千秋，常去灵山参佛面。圣号东华大帝君，烟霞第一神仙眷。孙行者觌面相迎，叫声：“帝君，起手了。”那帝君慌忙回礼道：“大圣，失迎。请荒居奉茶。”遂与行者搀手而入。果然是贝阙仙宫，看不尽瑶池琼阁。方坐待茶，只见翠屏后转出一个童儿。他怎生打扮：身穿道服飘霞烁，腰束丝绦光错落。头戴纶巾布斗星，足登芒履游仙岳。炼元真，脱本壳，功行成时遂意乐。识破原流精气神，主人认得无虚错。逃名今喜寿无疆，甲子周天管不着。转回廊，登宝阁，天上蟠桃三度摸。缥缈香云出翠屏，小仙乃是东方朔。行者见了，笑道：“这个小贼在这里哩！帝君处没有桃子你偷吃！”东方朔朝上进礼，答道：“老贼，你来这里怎的？我师父没有仙丹你偷吃。”帝君叫道：“曼倩休乱言，看茶来也。”曼倩原是东方朔的道名，他急入里取茶二杯。饮讫，行者道：“老孙此来，有一事奉干，未知允否？”帝君道：“何事？自当领教。”</p>

<p>行者道：“近因保唐僧西行，路过万寿山五庄观，因他那小童无状，是我一时发怒，把他人参果树推倒，因此阻滞，唐僧不得脱身，特来尊处求赐一方医治，万望慨然。”帝君道：“你这猴子，不管一二，到处里闯祸。那五庄观镇元子，圣号与世同君，乃地仙之祖。你怎么就冲撞出他？他那人参果树，乃草还丹。你偷吃了，尚说有罪；却又连树推倒，他肯干休？”行者道：“正是呢，我们走脱了，被他赶上，把我们就当汗巾儿一般，一袖子都笼了去，所以角气。没奈何，许他求方医治，故此拜求。”帝君道：</p>

<p>“我有一粒九转太乙还丹，但能治世间生灵，却不能医树。树乃水土之灵，天滋地润。若是凡间的果木，医治还可；这万寿山乃先天福地，五庄观乃贺洲洞天，人参果又是天开地辟之灵根，如何可治？无方！无方！”</p>

<p>行者道：“既然无方，老孙告别。”帝君仍欲留奉玉液一杯，行者道：“急救事紧，不敢久滞。”遂驾云至瀛洲海岛。也好去处，有诗为证，诗曰：珠树玲珑照紫烟，瀛洲宫阙接诸天。青山绿水琪花艳，玉液锟鋘铁石坚。五色碧鸡啼海日，千年丹凤吸朱烟。世人罔究壶中景，象外春光亿万年。那大圣至瀛洲，只见那丹崖珠树之下，有几个皓发皤髯之辈，童颜鹤鬓之仙，在那里着棋饮酒，谈笑讴歌。真个是：祥云光满，瑞霭香浮。彩鸾鸣洞口，玄鹤舞山头。碧藕水桃为按酒，交梨火枣寿千秋。一个个丹诏无闻，仙符有籍；逍遥随浪荡，散淡任清幽。周天甲子难拘管，大地乾坤只自由，献果玄猿，对对参随多美爱；衔花白鹿，双双拱伏甚绸缪。那些老儿正然洒乐，这行者厉声高叫道：</p>

<p>“带我耍耍儿便怎的！”众仙见了，急忙趋步相迎。有诗为证，诗曰：人参果树灵根折，大圣访仙求妙诀。缭绕丹霞出宝林，瀛洲九老来相接。行者认得是九老，笑道：“老兄弟们自在哩！”九老道：“大圣当年若存正，不闹天宫，比我们还自在哩。如今好了，闻你归真向西拜佛，如何得暇至此？”行者将那医树求方之事，具陈了一遍。九老也大惊道：“你也忒惹祸！惹祸！我等实是无方。”行者道：“既是无方，我且奉别。”</p>

<p>九老又留他饮琼浆，食碧藕。行者定不肯坐，止立饮了他一杯浆，吃了一块藕，急急离了瀛洲，径转东洋大海。早望见落伽山不远，遂落下云头，直到普陀岩上，见观音菩萨在紫竹林中与诸天大神、木叉、龙女，讲经说法。有诗为证，诗曰：海主城高瑞气浓，更观奇异事无穷。须知隐约千般外，尽出希微一品中。四圣授时成正果，六凡听后脱樊笼。少林别有真滋味，花果馨香满树红。</p>

<p>那菩萨早已看见行者来到，即命守山大神去迎。那大神出林来，叫声：“孙悟空，那里去？”行者抬头喝道：“你这个熊罴！</p>

<p>我是你叫的悟空？当初不是老孙饶了你，你已此做了黑风山的尸鬼矣。今日跟了菩萨，受了善果，居此仙山，常听法教，你叫不得我一声老爷？”那黑熊真个得了正果，在菩萨处镇守普陀，称为大神，是也亏了行者。他只得陪笑道：“大圣，古人云，君子不念旧恶，只管题他怎的！菩萨着我来迎你哩。”这行者就端肃尊诚，与大神到了紫竹林里，参拜菩萨。菩萨道：“悟空，唐僧行到何处也？”行者道：“行到西牛贺洲万寿山了。”菩萨道：“那万寿山有座五庄观，镇元大仙你曾会他么？”行者顿首道：“因是在五庄观，弟子不识镇元大仙，毁伤了他的人参果树，冲撞了他，他就困滞了我师父，不得前进。”那菩萨情知，怪道：“你这泼猴，不知好歹！他那人参果树，乃天开地辟的灵根。镇元子乃地仙之祖，我也让他三分，你怎么就打伤他树！”行者再拜道：“弟子实是不知。那一日，他不在家，只有两个仙童，候待我等。是猪悟能晓得他有果子，要一个尝新，弟子委偷了他三个，兄弟们分吃了。那童子知觉，骂我等无已，是弟子发怒，遂将他树推倒。他次日回来赶上，将我等一袖子笼去，绳绑鞭抽，拷打了一日。我等当夜走脱，又被他赶上，依然笼了。三番两次，其实难逃，已允了与他医树。却才自海上求方，遍游三岛，众神仙都没有本事。弟子因此志心朝礼，特拜告菩萨，伏望慈悯，俯赐一方，以救唐僧早早西去。”菩萨道：“你怎么不早来见我，却往岛上去寻找？”行者闻得此言，心中暗喜道：“造化了！造化了！</p>

<p>菩萨一定有方也！”他又上前恳求，菩萨道：“我这净瓶底的甘露水，善治得仙树灵苗。”行者道：“可曾经验过么？”菩萨道：</p>

<p>“经验过的。”行者问：“有何经验？”菩萨道：“当年太上老君曾与我赌胜：他把我的杨柳枝拔了去，放在炼丹炉里，炙得焦干，送来还我。是我拿了插在瓶中，一昼夜，复得青枝绿叶，与旧相同。”行者笑道：“真造化了！真造化了！烘焦了的尚能医活，况此推倒的，有何难哉！”菩萨吩咐大众：“看守林中，我去去来。”</p>

<p>遂手托净瓶，白鹦哥前边巧啭，孙大圣随后相从。有诗为证，诗曰：玉毫金象世难论，正是慈悲救苦尊。过去劫逢无垢佛，至今成得有为身。几生欲海澄清浪，一片心田绝点尘。甘露久经真妙法，管教宝树永长春。</p>

<p>却说那观里大仙与三老正然清话，忽见孙大圣按落云头，叫道：“菩萨来了，快接快接！”慌得那三星与镇元子共三藏师徒，一齐迎出宝殿。菩萨才住了祥云，先与镇元子陪了话，后与三星作礼。礼毕上坐，那阶前，行者引唐僧、八戒、沙僧都拜了。</p>

<p>那观中诸仙，也来拜见。行者道：“大仙不必迟疑，趁早儿陈设香案，请菩萨替你治那甚么果树去。”大仙躬身谢菩萨道：“小可的勾当，怎么敢劳菩萨下降？”菩萨道：“唐僧乃我之弟子，孙悟空冲撞了先生，理当赔偿宝树。”三老道：“既如此，不须谦讲了。请菩萨都到园中去看看。”</p>

<p>那大仙即命设具香案，打扫后园，请菩萨先行，三老随后。</p>

<p>三藏师徒与本观众仙，都到园内观看时，那棵树倒在地下，土开根现，叶落枝枯。菩萨叫：“悟空，伸手来。”那行者将左手伸开。菩萨将杨柳枝，蘸出瓶中甘露，把行者手心里画了一道起死回生的符字，教他放在树根之下，但看水出为度。那行者捏着拳头，往那树根底下揣着，须臾有清泉一汪。菩萨道：“那个水不许犯五行之器，须用玉瓢舀出，扶起树来，从头浇下，自然根皮相合，叶长芽生，枝青果出。”行者道：“小道士们，快取玉瓢来。”镇元子道：“贫道荒山，没有玉瓢，只有玉茶盏、玉酒杯，可用得么？”菩萨道：“但是玉器，可舀得水的便罢，取将来看。”</p>

<p>大仙即命小童子取出有二三十个茶盏，四五十个酒盏，却将那根下清泉舀出。行者、八戒、沙僧，扛起树来，扶得周正，拥上土，将玉器内甘泉，一瓯瓯捧与菩萨。菩萨将杨柳枝细细洒上，口中又念着经咒。不多时，洒净那舀出之水，只见那树果然依旧青枝绿叶浓郁阴森，上有二十三个人参果。清风、明月二童子道：“前日不见了果子时，颠倒只数得二十二个，今日回生，怎么又多了一个？”行者道：“日久见人心。前日老孙只偷了三个，那一个落下地来，土地说这宝遇土而入，八戒只嚷我打了偏手，故走了风信，只缠到如今，才见明白。”菩萨道：“我方才不用五行之器者，知道此物与五行相畏故耳。”那大仙十分欢喜，急令取金击子来，把果子敲下十个，请菩萨与三老复回宝殿，一则谢劳，二来做个人参果会。众小仙遂调开桌椅，铺设丹盘，请菩萨坐了上面正席，三老左席，唐僧右席，镇元子前席相陪，各食了一个。有诗为证，诗曰：万寿山中古洞天，人参一熟九千年。灵根现出芽枝损，甘露滋生果叶全。三老喜逢皆旧契，四僧幸遇是前缘。自今会服人参果，尽是长生不老仙。此时菩萨与三老各吃了一个，唐僧始知是仙家宝贝，也吃了一个，悟空三人亦各吃一个，镇元子陪了一个，本观仙众分吃了一个。</p>

<p>行者才谢了菩萨回上普陀岩，送三星径转蓬莱岛。镇元子却又安排蔬酒，与行者结为兄弟。这才是不打不成相识，两家合了一家。师徒四众，喜喜欢欢，天晚歇了。那长老才是：有缘吃得草还丹，长寿苦捱妖怪难。毕竟到明日如何作别，且听下回分解。</p>
