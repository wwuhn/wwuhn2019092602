<P>Monkey Makes Havoc in the Jindou Cave</P>
<P>The Buddha Gives a Hint About the Owner</P>
</div>
<P>The story tells how after recovering his gold-banded cudgel Monkey fought his way out of the cave and jumped up to the peak to see all the gods. He was very pleased with himself. &#8220;How did it go this time?&#8221; asked Heavenly King Li. &#8220;I did a transformation and went into the cave,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;where I saw the devils dancing, singing and drinking to celebrate their victory. But I heard nothing about where the demon keeps his treasure. When I went round to the back I heard the horses and dragons whimpering and realized they must be the fire beasts. My gold-banded cudgel was leaning against the Eastern wall, so I took it and fought my way out of the cave.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You have your treasure now,&#8221; said the gods, &#8220;but how are we going to get ours back?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Easy,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;easy. With this iron cudgel I can beat him whatever he does. I'll recover your treasures.&#8221; As they were talking there rose from the mountainside a concerted sound of gongs and drums as well as earth-shaking shouts: the Great Rhinoceros King was leading his host of spirits out in pursuit of Monkey, who called out at the sight of them, &#8220;Great, great, Just what I want. Please sit down, gentlemen, while I go to capture him.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage raised his iron cudgel and struck at the demon's face with a shout, &#8220;Where do you think you're going, damned demon? Take this!&#8221; Warding the blow off with his spear, the demon insulted him back: &#8220;Thieving ape! You're a disgrace. How dare you steal my property in broad daylight?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll get you, evil beast. Have the decency to die! All you can do is use your ring to steal our property in broad daylight. None of those things are really yours. Stay where you are, and take this!&#8221; Once again the monster parried with his spear. It was a splendid fight.</P>
<P>The Great Sage was ferocious,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The demon was not gentle.</P>
<P>Both sides fought with courage;</P>
<P>Neither would give in.</P>
<P>The iron cudgel was a dragon's tail,</P>
<P>The long spear was a serpent's head.</P>
<P>Blows from the cudgel whistled like the wind,</P>
<P>The spear's moves flowed as smoothly as a stream.</P>
<P>The mountain darkened, wreathed in coloured mists;</P>
<P>Auspicious clouds hung heavy on the woods.</P>
<P>The birds in the air all stopped their flying;</P>
<P>The wild beasts of the field all hid away.</P>
<P>The demons on one side raised battle cries</P>
<P>While Monkey on the other was Ml of vigor.</P>
<P>An iron club that no one could withstand</P>
<P>Had fought its way along the long road West;</P>
<P>A long spear that was a worthy match,</P>
<P>And always held its power supreme on Mount Jindou.</P>
<P>Once they joined battle there could be no respite:</P>
<P>They swore to carry on until one conquered.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The demon king and the Great Sage had been fighting for six hours without either gaining the upper hand. As night was falling the evil spirit held out his spear and said, &#8220;Stop, Wukong. It's too dark for fighting now. Let's have a night's sleep and I'll go on having it out with you tomorrow.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Shut up, damned demon,&#8221; replied Monkey abusively. &#8220;I've only just warmed up. I don't care how late it is: I'm going to carry on till one of us has won.&#8221; The demon gave a shout, made a feint with his spear, and fled for his life, leading his host of devils in retreat back to the cave, where they shut the doors tight.</P>
<P>When Monkey returned to the mountain top with his cudgel the gods from Heaven all congratulated him. &#8220;You really are strong and capable, Great Sage Equaling Heaven,&#8221; they said, &#8220;and your powers are boundless.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're overdoing your praises,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Heavenly King Li, coming up to him, &#8220;this is not empty praise. You really are a tough guy. The force you were up against today was as strong as the Heaven and Earth nets all those years age.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Let's not go into all that ancient history,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;That demon must be exhausted after his fight with me. I haven't been put to any trouble worth speaking of, so if you'll all sit here and relax I'll go back into the cave, find out where he keeps the ring, and steal it if I possibly can. Then I'll capture the monster, find your weapons, and return them to you to take back to Heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's late now,&#8221; said Prince Nezha. &#8220;You'd better have a good night's sleep and go tomorrow morning.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't understand life, my lad,&#8221; replied Monkey. &#8220;Who ever heard of a burglar liking to steal in broad daylight? This sort of groping about has to be done in secret under cover of darkness. That's the way the job's done.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop arguing, Your Highness,&#8221; said the Star Lord of Fire and the two thunder gods, &#8220;We don't know anything about that sort of thing, and the Great Sage is an old hand. Let him make the most of the nighttime, when the demon is exhausted and nobody is expecting anything to happen. Please go at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>With a chuckle the splendid Great Sage tucked his iron cudgel away, jumped down from the peak and went to the mouth of the cave, where he shook himself and turned into a cricket. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Hard mouth, black skin, and long antennae,</P>
<P>Bright eyes and legs that bend like branches.</P>
<P>In the clear wind and in moonlight he sings by the wall;</P>
<P>When the night is still he talks like a human.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As he weeps in the dew the scenery seems cold;</P>
<P>His marvellous voice now comes in fits and starts.</P>
<P>Just when the homesick traveler least wishes to hear him</P>
<P>He finds him lurking underneath the bed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>With a few bounds of his mighty legs Monkey was at the doors. Squeezing through the narrow gap between them he squatted at the foot of the wall, looking carefully at where the light was coming from. He saw all the big and little devils devouring their food like wolves or tigers. Monkey chirped for a while, and a little later the banquet was cleared away and the devils all went to bed. About two hours later, when Monkey had just reached the room at the back, he heard the demon king ordering, &#8220;Little ones on the doors, stay awake! Sun Wukong may change himself into something and sneak in here to steal.&#8221;</P>
<P>Those who were on watch duty that night were neatly turned out and sounding their clappers and bells. This made it even easier for the Great Sage, to go about his business. Creeping into the monster's bedroom he saw a stone bed on either side of which stood powdered and painted mountain and tree spirits. They were spreading out the bedding and waiting on the old demon, taking off his boots and clothes. When the old demon was undressed Monkey could see the ring gleaming white on his left arm. It looked like a bracelet made from a string of pearls. Instead of taking it off the demon pushed it up his arm a couple of times to jam it more firmly into place before going to sleep. Seeing this, Monkey changed himself again, this time into a brown-skinned flea that jumped up on the bed, burrowed into the bedding, climbed on the monster's arm, and bit him so hard that he sat up with a yell of, &#8220;Bloody slaves, you need some more flogging. You didn't shake out the quilt or dust the bed, and I've just been bitten.&#8221; He rubbed the ring twice more and went back to sleep. Monkey climbed on the ring and bit him again, so that the monster sat up again, unable to sleep. &#8220;I'm itching to death,&#8221; he complained.</P>
<P>Seeing that the security was so strict and that the demon kept the treasure on himself and was not going to take it off Monkey realized that he would be unable to steal it. So he jumped down from the bed, turned himself back into a cricket, left the bedroom, and went straight to the back, where he heard the groans and whimpers of the dragons and horses again, but now from behind tightly shut doors. Monkey turned back to his own form and went up to the doors to open the lock by magic. He said a spell and rubbed the lock, making its tongues both click open. He then pushed the doors open and rushed inside, where it was as bright as day in the light from all the fire instruments and creatures. He noticed some weapons leaning against the walls on either side: Prince Nezha's demon-hacking cutlass and other arms as well as the fire bows, arrows and the rest of the Star Lord of Fire's gear. Looking all around by the light of the fires he noticed to his delight a handful of hairs lying in a bamboo basket on a stone table behind the doors. Monkey picked them up, blew on them twice with warm breath, shouted &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned them into three or four dozen little monkeys. He told them to take the cutlass, sword, pestle, rope, ball, wheel, bow, arrows, spear, carts, gourd, fire crows, fire rats, fire horses and everything else that had been caught in the ring; then he mounted the fire dragon and started a blaze burning from the inside outwards. There was a great roaring and loud cracks that sounded like thunder and cannons. All the big and little demons were thrown into such panic and confusion that they wrapped themselves in their quilts, covered their heads, shouted and wept. As they had nowhere to flee most of them were burnt to death. When the Handsome Monkey King returned in victory it was about midnight.</P>
<P>When Heavenly King Li and the other gods spotted the dazzling fire from the mountaintop they rushed forward to see Brother Monkey riding the dragon and driving the little monkeys straight up to the peak. &#8220;Come and get your weapons,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;come and get your weapons.&#8221; The Star Lord of Fire and Nezha shouted greetings, whereupon Monkey shook himself and put all the hairs back on his body. Nezha recovered his six weapons, and the Star Lord told his subordinates to collect the fire dragon and the rest<I></I> of the fire creatures and implements. They were all laughing with pleasure as they congratulated Monkey.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The blaze in the Jindou Cave gave the Great Rhinoceros King such a fright that his souls left his body. He sat up at once, threw open the doors of his bedroom, and held the ring out in both hands to the East and the West to put out the fire. Then he ran all around holding out his treasure, which extinguished all the flames and smoke that filled the air, and tried to rescue his demons, most of whom were dead. He could only muster a hundred or so, male and female; and when he looked at where the weapons were kept he found them all gone. Going round to the back he saw Pig, Friar Sand and the Tang Priest still tied up there, the white horse still tethered to the trough and the luggage still in the room.</P>
<P>&#8220;I wonder which careless little devil started that fire,&#8221; he said angrily. &#8220;Look what it has done!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; said his attendants, &#8220;the fire was nothing to do with anyone in our household. It was probably a burglar who let all the fire creatures go and stole the magic weapons.&#8221;</P>
<P>Only then did the demon realize what had happened. &#8220;I'm certain it was Sun Wukong,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It can't have been anyone else. No wonder I couldn't get to sleep. The thieving monkey must have turned himself into something to get in here and bite my arm twice. He must have been trying to steal my treasure but failed because I was wearing it too tightly. So he stole the weapons and released the fire dragon. What a vicious idea: he was trying to burn me to death. Evil monkey! Your cleverness will get you nowhere: you don't know my powers yet. As long as I have this treasure I can go into the ocean without drowning and into fire without being burnt. If I catch that bandit I'll chop him up into little bits and burn him as a torch. That's the only way I'll feel better about it.&#8221;</P>
<P>After he had been talking to himself in his misery for a long time he did not notice the cocks crowing for the dawn. Up on the mountaintop Prince Nezha, who now had his six weapons back, said to Monkey, &#8220;Great Sage, it's light now and we must lose no time. We should fight the demon while his morale is still low. We'll support you with all the fire forces while you take him on, and this time I think you'll be able to capture him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;We'll all pull together. Let's have some fun.&#8221; Every one of them braced himself and displayed his martial prowess as they headed for the mouth of the cave. &#8220;Come out, damned demon,&#8221; shouted Monkey, &#8220;and fight with me.&#8221; The two stone doors had been reduced to ashes by the blaze, and the little devils inside were sweeping up and picking over the cinders. The approach of all the gods made them drop their brooms and their ash forks in panic as they rushed back inside to report, &#8220;Sun Wukong is here with a host of gods from Heaven demanding battle again.&#8221; The news caused the rhinoceros monster great alarm. He noisily ground his teeth of steel, his eyes bulged with fury, and he went out holding his spear and his treasure, pouring out insults: &#8220;I'll get you, you thieving arsonist of an ape. What sort of powers do you have that give you the right to treat me with such contempt?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Damned devil,&#8221; retorted Monkey with a smile on his face, &#8220;if you want to know my powers I'll tell you:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Since I was little my powers have been great;</P>
<P>My fame has spread in heaven and in earth.</P>
<P>As a bright young thing I learned to be immortal,</P>
<P>Acquiring the traditions of eternal youth.</P>
<P>I determined to visit the land of the heart</P>
<P>And reverently went to the country of the sages.</P>
<P>I learned the magic of infinite changes</P>
<P>And roamed at will through cosmic space.</P>
<P>My hobby was subduing the tigers on the hills;</P>
<P>When bored I forced the ocean dragons to submit.</P>
<P>I was monarch of the Mountain of Flowers and of Fruit,</P>
<P>And showed off my power in the Water Curtain Cave.</P>
<P>Often I decided to go up to Heaven</P>
<P>And in my folly I occupied the place above.</P>
<P>I was called the Great Sage Equaling Heaven</P>
<P>And given the title of Handsome Monkey King.</P>
<P>When they held a banquet of their magic peaches</P>
<P>I was most angry at not being invited.</P>
<P>Secretly I went to steal jade liquor,</P>
<P>Drinking this rare wine in their elegant pavilions.</P>
<P>Liver of dragons, the marrow of the phoenix,</P>
<P>And many other delicacies did I steal that day.</P>
<P>I ate my fill of those immortal peaches,</P>
<P>And packed my stomach with pills of eternal life.</P>
<P>I then purloined all kinds of Heavenly marvel</P>
<P>And tucked away the treasures of that palace.</P>
<P>Because the Jade Emperor had learned of my powers</P>
<P>Heavenly soldiers were sent into battle</P>
<P>The Nine Bright Shiners I sent on their way;</P>
<P>I wounded all five of the evil constellations.</P>
<P>The generals of Heaven were no match for me:</P>
<P>A hundred thousand soldiers all lost their nerve.</P>
<P>The Jade Emperor then was forced to summon</P>
<P>The Little Sage Erlang to join in the fight.</P>
<P>We both went through our seventy-two changes,</P>
<P>Each of us showing his spirit and strength.</P>
<P>The Bodhisattva Guanyin came to their aid</P>
<P>With her vase of pure water and her sprig of willow,</P>
<P>And Lao Zi used his Diamond Jade</P>
<P>To take me a prisoner back up to Heaven.</P>
<P>They led me in chains to the Jade Monarch's palace</P>
<P>Where legal officials determined my fate.</P>
<P>Strong soldiers were ordered to cut off my head,</P>
<P>But the hacks at my scalp only made sparks fly</P>
<P>When they tried all their tricks but nothing killed me.</P>
<P>I then was escorted to the palace of Lao Zi.</P>
<P>The Six Dings refined me with the fire of their furnace</P>
<P>And made my whole body as hard as steel.</P>
<P>After seven times seven days the furnace was opened,</P>
<P>And out I jumped, more terrible than ever.</P>
<P>The gods all shut their gates, unable to resist,</P>
<P>And the sages decided to ask the Buddha's help.</P>
<P>Great was the power of the Buddha's dharma,</P>
<P>Indeed his wisdom is infinitely mighty.</P>
<P>I wagered with a somersault to jump out of his hand,</P>
<P>But he crushed me with a mountain that rendered me powerless.</P>
<P>Then the Jade Emperor celebrated peace</P>
<P>And the West was proclaimed to be a land of bliss.</P>
<P>I was crushed by the mountain for five hundred years</P>
<P>Never tasting a mouthful of tea or of food.</P>
<P>When the Golden Cicada came down to earth</P>
<P>He was sent from the East to visit the Buddha.</P>
<P>He wants to bring the scriptures back to China,</P>
<P>So the Tang ruler could save his ancestors' souls.</P>
<P>Guanyin converted me to the side of goodness,</P>
<P>To hold to the teachings and keep myself in check.</P>
<P>Since I was released from the agonizing mountain</P>
<P>I have been heading West to fetch the true scriptures.</P>
<P>Do not try to use your evil cunning, devil:</P>
<P>Return to me my master to worship the Buddha.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When he had heard all this the demon pointed at Monkey and replied, &#8220;So you're the thief who robbed Heaven. Stay where you are and take this!&#8221; The Great Sage parried the spear whit his cudgel, and just as the two of them were starting to fight again Nezha and the Star Lord of Fire lost their tempers and flung all their magic weapons and fire-raising equipment at the demon king. Monkey was more ferocious than ever, while the thunder gods with their thunder splinters and the Heavenly King with his sword rushed into the fray together, not worrying about rank and seniority.</P>
<P>The demon king gave a mocking and majestic laugh, discreetly brought the ring out of his sleeve and threw it into the air with a shout of &#8220;Catch them!&#8221; It came whistling down, catching the six magic weapons, all the fire-raising equipment and creatures, the thunder gods' thunderbolt, the Heavenly King's sword and Monkey's cudgel. Once again the gods were all empty-handed and the Great Sage Sun disarmed. The triumphant demon turned round to say, &#8220;Little ones, fetch rocks to make new doors, and start digging and building to refurbish all the rooms inside. When that's done I'll slaughter the Tang Priest and his disciples as a thanksgiving to the local god, and you'll all have a share.&#8221; The little demons all set to as they had been instructed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Heavenly King Li led his troops back up the mountain the Star Lord of Fire was grumbling about Nezha's impatience and the thunder gods were angry with the Heavenly King for behaving badly. The only person keeping quiet was the Earl of the Yellow River. Seeing how they were all unwilling to look each other in the face and were worried, desperate, resentful and trying to make himself look cheerful, Brother Monkey said to them with a smile, &#8220;Don't be upset. Victory and defeat are all part of the soldier's routine. The demon's only so-so in fighting skill. The only thing that makes him so dangerous is that ring which has caught all our weapons again. Don't worry. I'll go and make some more inquiries about who and what he is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But last time you asked the Jade Emperor to have an inspection of the whole of Heaven you found no trace of him,&#8221; said Prince Nezha. &#8220;Where are you going to look for him now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As I recall,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;the Buddha's dharma is boundless. I'll go to the Western Heaven to ask the Tathagata Buddha to look at all four continents with his all-seeing eyes and find out where the demon was born, where his home is officially registered, and what his ring really is. Whatever happens we must capture him to avenge you gentlemen and allow you to return to Heaven happy.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said the gods, &#8220;don't stay here a moment longer. Go at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>Splendid Monkey said, &#8220;Go!&#8221; and with one bound of his somersault cloud he was soon at Vulture Peak. Bringing down his auspicious right he looked all around. It was a wonderful place:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Nobly tower the sacred peaks,</P>
<P>Pure is the beauty of the many crags,</P>
<P>Magical summits rise to touch the jade-blue sky,</P>
<P>This is what holds the Western Heaven in place,</P>
<P>Dominating China with its great might.</P>
<P>Its primal energy permeates earth and sky,</P>
<P>Covering all with splendor as its majesty spreads.</P>
<P>The sounds of bells and chimes reverberate for long</P>
<P>While voices can be heard reciting holy sutras.</P>
<P>Under blue pines the faithful preach</P>
<P>While arhats stroll among the cypresses.</P>
<P>White cranes come with purpose to the Vulture peak;</P>
<P>Phoenixes choose to perch on its empty pavilions.</P>
<P>Monkeys in twos pick immortal fruit;</P>
<P>Pairs of deer present milk vetch.</P>
<P>The songs of hidden birds seem to pour out their woes;</P>
<P>One cannot put names to the strange and brilliant flowers.</P>
<P>Ridge upon ridge enfold here many times over;</P>
<P>Smooth are the ancient paths that wind around.</P>
<P>This is a place of purity and magic,</P>
<P>The noble home of the enlightened Buddha.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As Monkey was admiring the mountain scenery someone called to him, &#8220;Where have you come from, Sun Wukong, and where are you going?&#8221; He turned round at once to see it was an honorable bhiksuni, or nun.</P>
<P>&#8220;There is a matter on which I would like to see the Tathagata,&#8221; said Monkey with a bow.</P>
<P>&#8220;You're so naughty,&#8221; said the bhiksuni. &#8220;If you're here to see the Tathagata why don't you go straight up to his monastery instead of admiring the scenery?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I only had the effrontery to look because this is my first visit,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Come with me at once,&#8221; said the bhiksuni, and Monkey went with her to the gates of the Thunder Monastery, where their way was blocked by the eight vajrapanis, the ferocious guardian gods. &#8220;Wait here for a while, Wukong, while I make a report on your behalf,&#8221; said the bhiksuni. Monkey stood outside the gates while the bhiksuni went into the Buddha's presence, put her hands together, and said, &#8220;Sun Wukong is here on a matter over which he wishes to see you, Tathagata.&#8221; The Buddha sent for Monkey, and the vajrapanis then allowed him in.</P>
<P>When Monkey had made his kowtows the Buddha asked, &#8220;Why are you here by yourself? I was told that you were converted to the faith after the honorable Guanyin released you, and that you were escorting the Tang Priest here to fetch the scriptures. What has happened?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I report to my Buddha,&#8221; said Monkey, his head touching the ground, &#8220;that your disciple has been escorting the Tang Priest Westwards ever since my conversion. At the Jindou Cave in Mount Jindou we're up against an evil demon called the Great Rhinoceros King who has tremendous magic powers. He is holding my master and fellow disciples as prisoners in his cave. I have asked the demon to return them, but his intentions are evil. When we fought he grabbed my iron cudgel with a gleaming white ring. I thought he might be some officer from Heaven with a yearning for earthly things so I went straight up there, but on inspection could not find any missing. The Jade Emperor kindly sent Heavenly King Li and his son Nezha to help me, but the demon took the prince's six weapons. Then I asked the Star Lord of Fire to burn him out, but he took all the fire-raising equipment and creatures. Next I asked the Star Lord of Water to drown him, but not a drop touched him. I went to a lot of effort to steal back the cudgel and all the rest of it, challenged him to another fight, and lost it all to him again. I have no way of subduing him. That is why I have come to ask my Buddha to show his disciple mercy and look to see where the monster is from. Then I'll be able to arrest his relations and neighbors, capture him and rescue the master. Then we'll all be able to seek the true achievement together reverently.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the Buddha heard this his all-seeing eyes looked far away, and all was revealed to him at once. &#8220;I know who that monster is,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but I must not tell you. You cannot keep your mouth shut, little monkey, and once you put it about that I told you he would stop fighting you and come to make a row here on Vulture Peak. I would only be asking for trouble for myself. Instead I will give you some dharma power to help you capture him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What dharma power will the Tathagata give me?&#8221; asked Monkey, kowtowing in thanks. The Tathagata Buddha then told his eighteen arhats to open their treasury and take eighteen grains of golden cinnabar sand with them.</P>
<P>&#8220;What does golden cinnabar sand do?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Go and have another contest with the demon outside the cave,&#8221; the Buddha replied. &#8220;Lure him out so that the arhats can drop their sand on him and fix him to the spot. He will not be able to move his body or lift a leg, and you will be able to beat him up as you see fit.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Splendid,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile, &#8220;splendid. Let's go straight away.&#8221; Not daring to delay, the arhats fetched the golden cinnabar sand and set out, while Brother Monkey thanked the Buddha once more. When they were on their way Monkey found on counting that there were only sixteen arhats.</P>
<P>&#8220;What sort of place is this if you let people bribe their way out of their duties?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean, bribing their way out of their duties?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Eighteen of you were sent,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;so why are there only sixteen of you now?&#8221;</P>
<P>Before the words were out of his mouth the arhats Dragon-subduer and Tiger-queller came up to him and asked, &#8220;Wukong, how can you be so wicked? We stayed behind to receive the Buddha's instructions.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've too tricky,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;too tricky. If I'd called out any later I dare say you wouldn't have come at all.&#8221; All the arhats were laughing as they mounted their auspicious clouds.</P>
<P>They were soon at Mount Jindou. When Heavenly King Li saw them he led his hosts out in greeting and started to tell them all that had happened. &#8220;Spare us the details,&#8221; the arhats said, &#8220;Call him out as soon as you can.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Great Sage made a spell with his hands, went to the mouth of the cave, and started shouting insults: &#8220;Come out, you bloated fiend, come out and see if you can beat your grandfather Monkey.&#8221;</P>
<P>The little devils flew in to report, and the demon king said in fury, &#8220;Who's the thieving ape asked along to help him in his wickedness?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There are no soldiers with him,&#8221; the little devils replied. &#8220;He's there by himself.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How could he possibly dare to come back here alone?&#8221; the demon king wondered. &#8220;I've got his cudgel. Does he want another boxing match?&#8221; Taking his ring and brandishing his spear the demon told the little devils to clear away the rocks blocking the entrance and leapt outside. &#8220;Damned ape,&#8221; he shouted insultingly, &#8220;make yourself scarce. You've been beaten often enough. What are you here shouting for again?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Damned demon,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you don't know what's good for you. The only way to stop me coming back is to surrender, apologize and give my master and my fellow disciples back. Do that and I'll spare you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've already had those three monks of yours cleaned up,&#8221; the monster replied, &#8220;and soon I'm going to slaughter them. Don't you realize that yet? Get lost!&#8221;</P>
<P>At the word &#8220;slaughter&#8221; Monkey stamped his feet, and his cheeks reddened as he could not hold back his anger for a moment longer. Dropping his guard he took a sidestep and swung his fist at the monster's face. The monster struck back with his spear, and not realizing that Monkey was deliberately springing from side to side he allowed himself to be lured South further and further from the cave. Monkey then called on the arhats to throw their golden cinnabar sand at the demon all together. It was a marvellous display of divine power. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>At first it spread like mist or smoke</P>
<P>Drifting gently down from the sky.</P>
<P>A vast expanse of whiteness</P>
<P>In which nothing can be seen;</P>
<P>A blanket of obscurity</P>
<P>That hides one's way in an instant.</P>
<P>The woodcutter loses his mate when gathering firewood;</P>
<P>The young Taoist gathering herbs cannot see his home.</P>
<P>The fine grains blow in the wind like flour,</P>
<P>The coarse ones roll like sesame seeds.</P>
<P>The world is lost to sight, the mountain peaks are dark,</P>
<P>And sunshine from the sky is blotted out.</P>
<P>This is not the dust kicked up by horses</P>
<P>Nor like the softness of a fragrant carriage.</P>
<P>This cinnabar sand is a merciless thing</P>
<P>Covering heaven and earth and capturing all demons.</P>
<P>Only because the monster attacked the true Way</P>
<P>Were the arhats commanded to show off its splendor.</P>
<P>In their hands they were holding pearls of brilliance</P>
<P>To shine with dazzling brightness at the right time.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the demon was being blinded by the flying sand he bent down to see that it was already three feet deep on the ground. In his alarm he sprang up at once to the level above it, but before he had steadied himself it was already over two feet deeper. Now desperate, he pulled his feet free, took out his ring, and threw it up in the air with a shout of &#8220;Catch them!&#8221; As it came whistling down it caught all eighteen grains of golden cinnabar sand. The monster went back into his cave.</P>
<P>The empty-handed arhats stopped their clouds. &#8220;Why have you stopped dropping your sand, arhats?&#8221; asked Monkey as he came towards them.</P>
<P>&#8220;There was a noise just now and all our golden cinnabar sand disappeared,&#8221; they replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;That thing must have caught it too,&#8221; said Monkey with a laugh.</P>
<P>&#8220;If he's as invincible as this however are we going to capture him?&#8221; the Heavenly King and the rest of them said. &#8220;When will we ever go back to Heaven, and how will we be able to face the Jade Emperor?&#8221;</P>
<P>Then the two arhats Dragon-subduer and Tiger-queller said to Monkey, &#8220;Wukong, do you know why we two were late setting out?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I was cross because I thought you were skulking somewhere and not coming,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I didn't know you were having a conversation.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The Tathagata Buddha gave us these instructions,&#8221; the arhats replied. &#8220;He said, 'That fiend has very great magic powers. If you lose your golden cinnabar sand tell Sun Wukong to go to Lord Lao Zi's Tushita Palace in the Lihen Heaven to find out about the fiend's background. If he does that he may be able to capture the monster easily.'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a horrible thing to do,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;The Buddha's tricked me again. He should have told me before and spared you this long journey.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As those are the Buddha's clear instructions you should be on your way as soon as possible,&#8221; said Heavenly King Li.</P>
<P>Splendid Monkey. Saying, &#8220;I'm off!&#8221; he sent his somersault cloud straight in through the Southern Gate of Heaven, where the four marshals raised their hands in greeting and asked how the capture of the demon was going. &#8220;I haven't got him yet,&#8221; said Monkey without stopping, &#8220;but I now know where to find out about his background.&#8221; Not daring to delay him, the four marshals let him pass through. He did not go to the Hall of Miraculous Mist or the Palace of the Dipper and the Bull, but went straight to the gates of the Tushita Palace in the Lihen Heaven that lies beyond the thirty-three heavens, where he saw two immortal boys standing in attendance. Monkey did not report his name but rushed straight in, to the consternation of the boys who grabbed him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; they asked, &#8220;and where are you going?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am the Great Sage Equaling Heaven,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and I'm here to see Lord Lao Zi.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How could you be so ill-mannered?&#8221; the boys said. &#8220;Just wait there while we make a report.&#8221; Allowing no further discussion Monkey shouted at them and went straight in, colliding with Lord Lao Zi who was coming out to meet him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Haven't seen you for ages, old fellow,&#8221; said Monkey after bowing and uttering a respectful &#8220;re-e-er.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why are you here, you little monkey, instead of going to fetch scriptures?&#8221; asked Lord Lao Zi with a smile. To this Monkey replied,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;To fetch the holy scriptures</P>
<P>I toil day and night,</P>
<P>And now that I'm in trouble</P>
<P>To see you would be right.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;What have your troubles on the road to the Western Heaven to do with me?&#8221; Lord Lao Zi asked. Monkey's answer was:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Of the Buddha's West Heaven</P>
<P>Please don't talk today.</P>
<P>It's to follow a trail</P>
<P>That I've come up this way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;But this is a Supreme Immortals' palace,&#8221; Lord Lao Zi replied, &#8220;so how can you be following anyone's trail up here?&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey went into the palace and looked about him with great concentration. When he had gone along a number of covered walkways he noticed a boy sleeping by the buffalo pen, from which the water-buffalo was missing. &#8220;Old man,&#8221; shouted Monkey, &#8220;your buffalo's escaped, your buffalo's escaped.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When did that wicked beast get away?&#8221; asked Lord Lao Zi with horror. The noise woke up the boy, who knelt before Lord Lao Zi and said, &#8220;My lord, I was asleep. I don't know when it went.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When did you go to sleep, you little wretch?&#8221; asked Lord Lao Zi angrily.</P>
<P>&#8220;I picked up an elixir pill in the elixir laboratory and ate it,&#8221; replied the boy with kowtows, &#8220;then went to sleep here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I suppose you ate one of the seven-fired elixir tablets that must have been dropped when I refined them the other day, damn you,&#8221; said Lord Lao Zi. &#8220;One of those tablets would make you sleep for seven days. The evil beast took the chance to escape and go down to the mortal world when you went to sleep and left it unguarded. That must have been seven days ago.&#8221; He then ordered an inspection to find out if it had stolen any treasures.</P>
<P>&#8220;It doesn't have any treasures, only a terrible ring,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>When Lord Lao Zi made an urgent check he found that nothing was missing except a diamond jade bangle. &#8220;The evil beast must have stolen my Diamond Jade Bangle,&#8221; said Lord Lao Zi.</P>
<P>&#8220;So that's what his treasure is,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;that's what he fought me with. Goodness only knows how many of our weapons he's caught with that now he's rampaging around in the mortal would.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where is that wicked beast now?&#8221; Lord Lao Zi asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;In the Jindou Cave on Mount Jindou, where he's holding the Tang Priest and has captured my gold-banded cudgel. I asked for the help of heavenly soldiers, and he took Prince Nezha's magic weapons. When I invited the Star Lord of Fire to come his fire-raising equipment and creatures were taken. Although the Earl of the Yellow River couldn't drown him, at least his gear wasn't taken. Then when I asked the Buddha to send his arhats to scatter their golden cinnabar sand the demon took all that too. It looks as though you are guilty of a very serious crime in allowing a thieving and murderous monster to get away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That Diamond Jade Bangle is a treasure I refined and created after I went out through the Han Pass to convert the foreigners. Nothing can get anywhere near it, not weapons, fire or water. But if my Plantain Fan had been stolen not even I would have been able to do anything about it&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey was feeling very pleased as he accompanied Lord Lao Zi, who was carrying his Plantain Fan, out of the palace by auspicious cloud. Once they were through the Southern Gate of Heaven they brought the cloud straight down to Mount Jindou, where Lord Lao Zi greeted the eighteen arhats, the thunder gods, the Earl of the Yellow River, the Star Lord of Fire, Heavenly King Li and Prince Nezha, who told him all about what had happened. &#8220;For me to catch him Sun Wukong will have to go down to lure him out once more,&#8221; Lord Lao Zi said.</P>
<P>Monkey jumped down from the peak and started yelling abuse once more. &#8220;Bloated, evil beast, come out and be killed.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the little devils reported once again the demon king said, &#8220;I wonder who the evil monkey has fetched this time.&#8221; He went out with his spear and his treasure to have Monkey cursing him once again.</P>
<P>&#8220;Vicious demon, you're definitely going to die this time. Stay there, and take this!&#8221; Monkey leapt straight at him, punched the demon on the ear with a swing of his fist, turned and fled. The demon was going after him, wielding his spear, when a shout came from the top of the mountain: &#8220;Go home, buffalo. What are you waiting for?&#8221;</P>
<P>When the demon looked up and saw Lord Lao Zi he trembled with fear. &#8220;That thieving ape really is a devil. How did he ever persuade my master to come?&#8221;</P>
<P>When Lord Lao Zi recited a spell and fanned his fan once, the monster surrendered the ring which the lord caught in his hand. When he fanned it again all the strength went out of the monster, who reverted to his true form as a water-buffalo. Lord Lao Zi then blew on the Diamond Bangle with magic breath, put it thorough the buffalo's nose, undid the sash at his own waist, threaded it through the ring and held it.</P>
<P>To this day water-buffaloes still have devices called pegs put through their noses through which a rope can be run: this does the same job.</P>
<P>Lord Lao Zi then took his leave of the gods, mounted the buffalo, and rode on his multicolored cloud up to the Tushita Heaven, taking the demon with him on its lead.</P>
<P>Only then could the Great Sage Sun, Heavenly King Li and all of the host charge into the cave, killing all the hundred and more big and little devils and recovering their weapons and equipment. Monkey thanked Heavenly King Li and Nezha, who went back to Heaven; the thunder gods, who returned to their residence; the Star Lord of Fire, who went to his palace; the Earl of the Yellow River who went to his river; and the arhats, who returned to the Western Heaven. Finally he released the Tang Priest, Pig and Friar Sand and took back his iron cudgel. When the three of them had thanked Monkey the horse and the luggage were got ready and master and disciples left the cave to find the main route to the West.</P>
<P>As they were walking along they heard a call of &#8220;Holy Tang Priest, have a vegetarian meal,&#8221; which startled the master. If you do not know who was calling, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>悟空大闹金山兜洞</p>
<p>如来暗示主人公</p>
</div>
<p>话说孙大圣得了金箍棒，打出门前，跳上高峰，对众神满心欢喜。李天王道：“你这场如何”行者道：“老孙变化进他洞去，那怪物越发唱唱舞舞的，吃得胜酒哩，更不曾打听得他的宝贝在那里。我转他后面，忽听得马叫龙吟，知是火部之物。东壁厢靠着我的金箍棒，是老孙拿在手中，一路打将出来也。”众神道：“你的宝贝得了，我们的宝贝何时到手？”行者道：“不难！</p>

<p>不难！我有了这根铁棒，不管怎的，也要打倒他，取宝贝还你。”</p>

<p>正讲处，只听得那山坡下锣鼓齐鸣，喊声振地，原来是兕大王帅众精灵来赶行者。行者见了，叫道：“好！好！好！正合吾意！</p>

<p>列位请坐，待老孙再去捉他。”</p>

<p>好大圣，举铁棒劈面迎来，喝道：“泼魔那里走！看棍！”那怪使枪支住，骂道：“贼猴头！着实无礼！你怎么白昼劫吾物件？”行者道：“我把你这个不知死的孽畜！你倒弄圈套白昼抢夺我物！那件儿是你的？不要走！吃老爷一棍！”那怪物轮枪隔架。这一场好战：大圣施威猛，妖魔不顺柔。两家齐斗勇，那个肯干休！这一个铁棒如龙尾，那一个长枪似蟒头。这一个棒来解数如风响，那一个枪架雄威似水流。只见那彩雾朦朦山岭暗，祥云叆叆树林愁。满空飞鸟皆停翅，四野狼虫尽缩头。那阵上小妖呐喊，这壁厢行者抖擞。一条铁棒无人敌，打遍西方万里游。那杆长枪真对手，永镇金皘称上筹。相遇这场无好散，不见高低誓不休。那魔王与孙大圣战经三个时辰，不分胜败，早又见天色将晚。妖魔支着长枪道：“悟空，你住了，天昏地暗，不是个赌斗之时，且各歇息歇息，明朝再与你比迸。”行者骂道：“泼畜休言！老孙的兴头才来，管甚么天晚！是必与你定个输赢！”那怪物喝一声，虚幌一枪，逃了性命，帅群妖收转干戈，入洞中将门紧紧闭了。</p>

<p>这大圣拽棍方回，天神在岸头贺喜，都道：“是有能有力的大齐天，无量无边的真本事！”行者笑道：“承过奖！承过奖！”李天王近前道：“此言实非褒奖，真是一条好汉子！这一阵也不亚当时瞒地网罩天罗也！”行者道：“且休题夙话。那妖魔被老孙打了这一场，必然疲倦。我也说不得辛苦，你们都放怀坐坐，等我再进洞去打听他的圈子，务要偷了他的，捉住那怪，寻取兵器，奉还汝等归天。”太子道：“今已天晚，不若安眠一宿，明早去罢。”行者笑道：“这小郎不知世事！那见做贼的好白日里下手？似这等掏摸的，必须夜去夜来，不知不觉，才是买卖哩。”火德与雷公道：“三太子休言，这件事我们不知，大圣是个惯家熟套，须教他趁此时候，一则魔头困倦，二来夜黑无防，就请快去！快去！”</p>

<p>好大圣，笑唏唏的，将铁棒藏了，跳下高峰，又至洞口，摇身一变，变作一个促织儿，真个嘴硬须长皮黑，眼明爪脚丫叉。</p>

<p>风清月明叫墙涯，夜静如同人话。泣露凄凉景色，声音断续堪夸。客窗旅思怕闻他，偏在空阶床下。蹬开大腿三五跳，跳到门边，自门缝里钻将进去，蹲在那壁根下，迎着里面灯光，仔细观看。只见那大小群妖，一个个狼餐虎咽，正都吃东西哩。行者揲揲锤锤的叫了一遍。少时间，收了家火，又都去安排窝铺，各各安身。约摸有一更时分，行者才到他后边房里，只听那老魔传令，教：“各门上小的醒睡！恐孙悟空又变甚么私入家偷盗。”又有些该班坐夜的，涤涤托托，梆铃齐响，这大圣越好行事，钻入房门，见有一架石床，左右列几个抹粉搽胭的山精树鬼，展铺盖伏侍老魔，脱脚的脱脚，解衣的解衣。只见那魔王宽了衣服，左肐膊上，白森森的套着那个圈子，原来象一个连珠镯头模样。你看他更不取下，转往上抹了两抹，紧紧的勒在肐膊上，方才睡下。行者见了，将身又变，变作一个黄皮虼蚤，跳上石床，钻入被里，爬在那怪的肐膊上，着实一口，叮的那怪翻身骂道：“这些少打的奴才！被也不抖，床也不拂，不知甚么东西，咬了我这一下！”他却把圈子又捋上两捋，依然睡下。行者爬上那圈子，又咬一口。那怪睡不得，又翻过身来道：“刺闹杀我也！”</p>

<p>行者见他关防得紧，宝贝又随身，不肯除下，料偷他的不得。跳下床来，还变做促织儿，出了房门，径至后面，又听得龙吟马嘶，原来那层门紧锁，火龙火马，都吊在里面。行者现了原身，走近门前，使个解锁法，念动咒语，用手一抹，扢扠一声，那锁双鐄俱就脱落，推开门，闯将进去观看，原来那里面被火器照得明晃晃的，如白日一般。忽见东西两边斜靠着几件兵器，都是太子的砍妖刀等物，并那火德的火弓火箭等物。行者映火光，周围看了一遍，又见那门背后一张石桌子上有一个篾丝盘儿，放着一把毫毛。大圣满心欢喜，将毫毛拿起来，呵了两口热气，叫声“变！”即变作三五十个小猴，教他都拿了刀、剑、杵、索、球、轮及弓、箭枪、车、葫芦、火鸦、火鼠、火马一应套去之物，骑了火龙，纵起火势，从里边往外烧来。只听得烘烘焃焃，扑扑乒乒，好便似咋雷连炮之声。慌得那些大小妖精，梦梦查查的，披着被，朦着头，喊的喊，哭的哭，一个个走头无路，被这火烧死大半。美猴王得胜回来，只好有三更时候。却说那高峰上，李天王众位忽见火光幌亮，一拥前来，见行者骑着龙，喝喝呼呼，纵着小猴，径上峰头，厉声高叫道：“来收兵器！来收兵器！”火德与哪吒答应一声，这行者将身一抖，那把毫毛复上身来。哪吒太子收了他六件兵器，火德星君着众火部收了火龙等物，都笑吟吟赞贺行者不题。</p>

<p>却说那金皘洞里火焰纷纷，唬得个兕大王魂不附体，急欠身开了房门，双手拿看圈子，东推东火灭，西推西火消，满空中冒烟突火，执着宝贝跑了一遍，四下里烟火俱熄。急忙收救群妖，已此烧杀大半，男男女女，收不上百十余丁；又查看藏兵之内，各件皆无；又去后面看处，见八戒、沙僧与长老还捆住未解，白龙马还在槽上，行李担亦在屋里。妖魔遂恨道：“不知是那个小妖不仔细，失了火，致令如此！”旁有近侍的告道：“大王，这火不干本家之事，多是个偷营劫寨之贼，放了那火部之物，盗了神兵去也。”老魔方然省悟道：“没有别人，断乎是孙悟空那贼！怪道我临睡时不得安稳！想是那贼猴变化进来，在我这肐膊叮了两口。一定是要偷我的宝贝，见我抹勒得紧，不能下手，故此盗了兵器，纵着火龙，放此狠毒之心，意欲烧杀我也。贼猴啊！你枉使机关，不知我的本事！我但带了这件宝贝，就是入大海而不能溺，赴火池而不能焚哩！这番若拿住那贼，只把刮了点垛，方趁我心！”说着话，懊恼多时，不觉的鸡鸣天晓。</p>

<p>那高峰上太子得了六件兵器，对行者道：“大圣，天色已明，不须怠慢。我们趁那妖魔挫了锐气，与火部等扶住你，再去力战，庶几这次可擒拿也。”行者笑道：“说得有理。我们齐了心，耍子儿去耶！”一个个抖擞威风，喜弄武艺，径至洞口。行者叫道：“泼魔出来！与老孙打者！”原来那里两扇石门被火气化成灰烬，门里边有几个小妖，正然扫地撮灰，忽见众圣齐来，慌得丢了扫帚，撇下灰耙，跑入里面，又报道：“孙悟空领着许多天神，又在门外骂战哩！”那兕怪闻报大惊，扢迸迸，钢牙咬响；</p>

<p>滴溜溜，环眼睁圆，挺着长枪，带了宝贝，走出门来，泼口乱骂道：“我把你这个偷营放火的贼猴！你有多大手段，敢这等藐视我也？”行者笑脸儿骂道：“泼怪物！你要知我的手段，且上前来，我说与你听：自小生来手段强，乾坤万里有名扬。当时颖悟修仙道，昔日传来不老方。立志拜投方寸地，虔心参见圣人乡。</p>

<p>学成变化无量法，宇宙长空任我狂。闲在山前将虎伏，闷来海内把龙降。祖居花果称王位，水帘洞里逞刚强。几番有意图天界，数次无知夺上方。御赐齐天名大圣，敕封又赠美猴王。只因宴设蟠桃会，无简相邀我性刚。暗闯瑶池偷玉液，私行空阁饮琼浆；龙肝凤髓曾偷吃，百味珍馐我窃尝；千载蟠桃随受用，万年丹药任充肠。天宫异物般般取，圣府奇珍件件藏。玉帝访我有手段，即发天兵摆战场。九曜恶星遭我贬，五方凶宿被吾伤。普天神将皆无敌，十万雄师不敢当。威逼玉皇传旨意，灌江小圣把兵扬。相持七十单二变，各弄精神个个强。南海观音来助战，净瓶杨柳也相帮。老君又使金刚套，把我擒拿到上方。</p>

<p>绑见玉皇张大帝，曹官拷较罪该当。即差大力开刀斩，刀砍头皮火焰光。百计千方弄不死，将吾押赴老君堂。六丁神火炉中炼，炼得浑身硬似钢。七七数完开鼎看，我身跳出又凶张。诸神闭户无遮挡，众圣商量把佛央。其实如来多法力，果然智慧广无量。手中赌赛翻筋斗，将山压我不能强。玉皇才设安天会，西域方称极乐场。压困老孙五百载，一些茶饭不曾尝。金蝉长老临凡世，东土差他拜佛乡。欲取真经回上国，大唐帝主度先亡。观音劝我皈依善，秉教迦持不放狂。解脱高山根下难，如今西去取经章。泼魔休弄獐狐智，还我唐僧拜法王！”那怪闻言，指着行者道：“你原来是个偷天的大贼！不要走！吃吾一枪！”这大圣使棒来迎。两个正自相持，这壁厢哪吒太子生嗔，火德星君发狠，即将那六件神兵，火部等物，望妖魔身上抛来，孙大圣更加雄势。一边又雷公使捎，天王举刀，不分上下，一拥齐来。那魔头巍巍冷笑，袖子中暗暗将宝贝取出，撒手抛起空中，叫声“着！”唿喇的一下，把六件神兵、火部等物、雷公捎、天王刀、行者棒，尽情又都捞去，众神灵依然赤手，孙大圣仍是空拳。妖魔得胜回身，叫：“小的们，搬石砌门，动土修造，从新整理房廊。待齐备了，杀唐僧三众来谢土，大家散福受用。”众小妖领命维持不题。</p>

<p>却说那李天王帅众回上高峰，火德怨哪吒性急，雷公怪天王放刁，惟水伯在旁无语。行者见他们面不厮睹，心有萦思，没奈何，怀恨强欢，对众笑道：“列位不须烦恼，自古道，胜败兵家之常。我和他论武艺，也只如此。但只是他多了这个圈子，所以为害，把我等兵器又套将去了。你且放心，待老孙再去查查他的脚色来也。”太子道：“你前启奏玉帝，查勘满天世界，更无一点踪迹，如今却又何处去查？”行者道：“我想起来，佛法无边，如今且上西天问我佛如来，教他着慧眼观看大地四部洲，看这怪是那方生长，何处乡贯住居，圈子是件甚么宝贝。不管怎的，一定要拿他，与列位出气，还汝等欢喜归天。”众神道：</p>

<p>“既有此意，不须久停，快去快去！”</p>

<p>好行者，说声去，就纵筋斗云，早至灵山，落下祥光，四方观看，好去处：灵峰疏杰，迭嶂清佳，仙岳顶巅摩碧汉。西天瞻巨镇，形势压中华。元气流通天地远，威风飞彻满台花。时闻钟磬音长，每听经声明朗。又见那青松之下优婆讲，翠柏之间罗汉行。白鹤有情来鹫岭，青鸾着意佇闲亭。玄猴对对擎仙果，寿鹿双双献紫英。幽鸟声频如诉语，奇花色绚不知名。回峦盘绕重重顾，古道湾环处处平。正是清虚灵秀地，庄严大觉佛家风。那行者正然点看山景，忽听得有人叫道：“孙悟空，从那里来？往何处去？”急回头看，原来是比丘尼尊者。大圣作礼道：</p>

<p>“正有一事，欲见如来。”比丘尼道：“你这个顽皮！既然要见如来，怎么不登宝刹，且在这里看山？”行者道：“初来贵地，故此大胆。”比丘尼道：“你快跟我来也。”这行者紧随至雷音寺山门下，又见那八大金刚，雄纠纠的两边挡住，比丘尼道。“悟空，暂候片时，等我与你奏上去来。”行者只得住立门外。那比丘尼至佛前合掌道：“孙悟空有事，要见如来。”如来传旨令入，金刚才闪路放行。行者低头礼拜毕，如来问道：“悟空，前闻得观音尊者解脱汝身，皈依释教，保唐僧来此求经，你怎么独自到此？有何事故？”行者顿首道：“上告我佛，弟子自秉迦持，与唐朝师父西来，行至金皘山金皘洞，遇着一个恶魔头，名唤兕大王，神通广大，把师父与师弟等摄入洞中。弟子向伊求取，没好意，两家比迸，被他将一个白森森的一个圈子，抢了我的铁棒。我恐他是天将思凡，急上界查勘不出。蒙玉帝差遣李天王父子助援，又被他抢了太子的六般兵器。及请火德星君放火烧他，又被他将火具抢去。又请水德星君放水渰他，一毫又渰他不着，弟子费若干精神气力，将那铁棒等物偷出，复去索战，又被他将前物依然套去，无法收降，因此特告我佛，望垂慈与弟子看看，果然是何物出身，我好去拿他家属四邻，擒此魔头，救我师父，合拱虔诚，拜求正果。”如来听说，将慧眼遥观，早已知识，对行者道：“那怪物我虽知之，但不可与你说。你这猴儿口敞，一传道是我说他，他就不与你斗，定要嚷上灵山，反遗祸于我也。我这里着法力助你擒他去罢。”行者再拜称谢道：“如来助我甚么法力”如来即令十八尊罗汉开宝库取十八粒“金丹砂”与悟空助力。行者道：“金丹砂却如何？”如来道：“你去洞外，叫那妖魔比试。演他出来，却教罗汉放砂，陷住他，使他动不得身，拔不得脚，凭你揪打便了。”行者笑道：“妙！妙！妙！趁早去来！”那罗汉不敢迟延，即取金丹砂出门，行者又谢了如来。一路查看，止有十六尊罗汉，行者嚷道：“这是那个去处，却卖放人！”众罗汉道：“那个卖放？”行者道：“原差十八尊，今怎么只得十六尊？”</p>

<p>说不了，里边走出降龙、伏虎二尊，上前道：“悟空，怎么就这等放刁？我两个在后听如来吩咐话的。”行者道：“忒卖法！忒卖法！才自若嚷迟了些儿，你敢就不出来了。”众罗汉笑呵呵驾起祥云。</p>

<p>不多时，到了金皘山界。那李天王见了，帅众相迎，备言前事。罗汉道：“不必絮繁，快去叫他出来。”这大圣捻着拳头，来于洞口，骂道：“泼怪物，快出来与你孙外公见个上下！”那小妖又飞跑去报，魔王怒道：“这贼猴又不知请谁来猖獗也！”小妖道：“更无甚将，止他一人。”魔王道：“那根棒子已被我收来，怎么却又一人到此？敢是又要走拳？”随带了宝贝，绰枪在手，叫小妖搬开石块，跳出门来骂道：“贼猴！你几番家不得便宜，就该回避，如何又来吆喝？”行者道：“这泼魔不识好歹！若要你外公不来，除非你服了降，陪了礼，送出我师父师弟，我就饶你！”</p>

<p>那怪道：“你那三个和尚已被我洗净了，不久便要宰杀，你还不识起倒！去了罢！”行者听说宰杀二字，扢蹬蹬腮边火发，按不住心头之怒，丢了架子，轮着拳，斜行抅步，望妖魔使个挂面。</p>

<p>那怪展长枪，劈手相迎。行者左跳右跳，哄那妖魔。妖魔不是是计，赶离洞口南来。行者即招呼罗汉把金丹砂望妖魔一齐抛下，共显神通，好砂！正是那：似雾如烟初散漫，纷纷霭霭下天涯。白茫茫，到处迷人眼；昏漠漠，飞时找路差。打柴的樵子失了伴，采药的仙童不见家。细细轻飘如麦面，粗粗翻复似芝麻。</p>

<p>世界朦胧山顶暗，长空迷没太阳遮。不比嚣尘随骏马，难言轻软衬香车。此砂本是无情物，盖地遮天把怪拿。只为妖魔侵正道，阿罗奉法逞豪华。手中就有明珠现，等时刮得眼生花。那妖魔见飞砂迷目，把头低了一低，足下就有三尺余深，慌得他将身一纵，跳在浮上一层，未曾立得稳，须臾，又有二尺余深。</p>

<p>那怪急了，拔出脚来，即忙取圈子，往上一撇，叫声“着！”唿喇的一下，把十八粒金丹砂又尽套去，拽回步，径归本洞。</p>

<p>那罗汉一个个空手停云。行者近前问道：“众罗汉，怎么不下砂了？”罗汉道：“适才响了一声，金丹砂就不见矣。”行者笑道：“又是那话儿套将去了。”天王等众道：“这般难伏啊，却怎么捉得他，何日归天，何颜见帝也！”旁有降龙、伏虎二罗汉对行者道：“悟空，你晓得我两个出门迟滞何也？”行者道：“老孙只怪你躲避不来，却不知有甚话说。”罗汉道：“如来吩咐我两个说，那妖魔神通广大，如失了金丹砂，就教孙悟空上离恨天兜率宫太上老君处寻他的踪迹，庶几可一鼓而擒也。”行者闻言道：“可恨！可恨！如来却也闪赚老孙！当时就该对我说了，却不免教汝等远涉！”李天王道：“既是如来有此明示，大圣就当早起。”</p>

<p>好行者，说声去，就纵一道筋斗云，直入南天门里。时有四大元帅擎拳拱手道：“擒怪事如何？”行者且行且答道：“未哩！</p>

<p>未哩！如今有处寻根去也。”四将不敢留阻，让他进了天门，不上灵屑殿，不入斗牛宫，径至三十三天之外离恨天兜率宫前，见两仙童侍立，他也不通姓名，一直径走，慌得两童扯住道：</p>

<p>“你是何人？待往何处去？”行者才说：“我是齐天大圣，欲寻李老君哩。”仙童道：“你怎这样粗鲁？且住下，让我们通报。”行者那容分说，喝了一声，往里径走，忽见老君自内而出，撞个满怀。行者躬身唱个喏道：“老官，一向少看。”老君笑道：“这猴儿不去取经，却来我处何干？”行者道：“取经取经，昼夜无停；有些阻碍，到此行行。”老君道：“西天路阻，与我何干？”行者道：</p>

<p>“西天西天，你且休言；寻着踪迹，与你缠缠。”老君道：“我这里乃是无上仙宫，有甚踪迹可寻？”行者入里，眼不转睛，东张西看，走过几层廊宇，忽见那牛栏边一个童儿盹睡，青牛不在栏中。行者道：“老官，走了牛也！走了牛也！”老君大惊道：“这孽畜几时走了？”正嚷间，那童儿方醒，跪于当面道：“爷爷，弟子睡着，不知是几时走的。”老君骂道：“你这厮如何盹睡？”童儿叩头道：“弟子在丹房里拾得一粒丹，当时吃了，就在此睡着。”</p>

<p>老君道：“想是前日炼的七返火丹，吊了一粒，被这厮拾吃了。</p>

<p>那丹吃一粒，该睡七日哩，那孽畜因你睡着，无人看管，遂乘机走下界去，今亦是七日矣。”即查可曾偷甚宝贝。行者道：“无甚宝贝，只见他有一个圈子，甚是利害。”老君急查看时，诸般俱在，止不见了金刚琢。老君道：“是这孽畜偷了我金刚琢去了！”</p>

<p>行者道：“原来是这件宝贝！当时打着老孙的是他！如今在下界张狂，不知套了我等多少物件！”老君道：“这孽畜在甚地方？”行者道：“现住金皘山金皘洞。他捉了我唐僧进去，抢了我金箍棒。请天兵相助，又抢了太子的神兵。及请火德星君，又抢了他的火具。惟水伯虽不能渰死他，倒还不曾抢他物件。至请如来着罗汉下砂，又将金丹砂抢去。似你这老官，纵放怪物，抢夺伤人，该当何罪？”老君道：“我那金刚琢，乃是我过函关化胡之器，自幼炼成之宝。凭你甚么兵器，水火，俱莫能近他。若偷去我的芭蕉扇儿，连我也不能奈他何矣。”</p>

<p>大圣才欢欢喜喜，随着老君。老君执了芭蕉扇，驾着祥云同行，出了仙宫，南天门外，低下云头，径至金皘山界，见了十八尊罗汉、雷公、水伯、火德、李天王父子，备言前事一遍。老君道：“孙悟空还去诱他出来，我好收他。”这行者跳下峰头，又高声骂道：“北泼孽畜！趁早出来受死！”那小妖又去报知，老魔道：“这贼猴又不知请谁来也。”急绰枪举宝，迎出门来。行者骂道：“你这泼魔，今番坐定是死了！不要走！吃吾一掌！”急纵身跳个满怀，劈脸打了一个耳括子，回头就跑。那魔轮枪就赶，只听得高峰上叫道：“那牛儿还不归家，可待何日？”那魔抬头，看见是太上老君，就唬得心惊胆战道：“这贼猴真个是个地里鬼！</p>

<p>却怎么就访得我的主公来也？”老君念个咒语，将扇子搧了一下，那怪将圈子丢来，被老君一把接住；又一，搧那怪物力软筋麻，现了本相，原来是一只青牛。老君将金钢琢吹口仙气，穿了那怪的鼻子，解下勒袍带，系于琢上，牵在手中。至今留下个拴牛鼻的拘儿，又名宾郎，职此之谓。老君辞了众神，跨上青牛背上，驾彩云，径归兜率院；缚妖怪，高升离恨天。孙大圣才同天王等众打入洞里，把那百十个小妖尽皆打死，各取兵器，谢了天王父子回天，雷公入府，火德归宫，水伯回河，罗汉向西；然后才解放唐僧八戒沙僧，拿了铁棒。他三人又谢了行者，收拾马匹行装，师徒们离洞，找大路方走。正走间，只听得路旁叫：</p>

<p>“唐圣僧，吃了斋饭去。”那长老心惊。不知是甚么人叫唤，且听下回分解。</p>
