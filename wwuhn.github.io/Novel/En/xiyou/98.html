<P>The Monks and Their Supporters Meet With Demonic Attack</P>
<P>The Sage Makes the Spirit Reappear to Save the Primal One</P>
</div>
<P>We will tell not of how the Tang Priest and the others endured a hard night in the dilapidated palace of Padmaprabha, but of a group of evil villains in Diling county in the prefecture of Brazentower who had squandered all their families' fortunes in whoring, drinking and gambling. Having nothing else left to live on they had formed a criminal gang of a dozen and more members and were discussing which family was the richest in the city and which the second richest. The idea was to rob them of their gold and silver and thus get some money to spend.</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no need to go round making enquiries,&#8221; one of them said, &#8220;or work it out in detail. The Mr. Kou who saw the Tang monk off today is rolling in money. Let's strike tonight in the rain. There'll be nobody ready for us in the streets and the fire wardens won't be patrolling. When we've stolen his property we'll be able to go with the girls, gamble and have a good time again. That would be great, wouldn't it?&#8221;</P>
<P>The other robbers were all delighted with the suggestion, and with one heart they all set out in the rain carrying daggers, spiked clubs, sticks, coshes, ropes and torches. Flinging open the main gates of the Kou house they charged inside, shouting and sending everyone inside, young and old, male and female, scurrying into hiding. The old woman hid under the bed and the old man slipped behind the gates, while Kou Liang, Kou Dong and their families fled for their lives in all directions. Holding their knives in their hands and lighting torches, the bandits opened up all the chests in the house and grabbed as much of the gold, silver, jewelry, hair ornaments, clothing, vessels and other household goods as they wanted. Mr. Kou could not bear to lose all this, so taking his life in his hands he come out from behind the gate to plead with the robbers.</P>
<P>&#8220;Take as much as you want, great kings,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but please leave me a few clothes to be buried in.&#8221; The robbers were in no mood for argument. They rushed up to him, tripped and kicked him to the ground. Alas,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>His three souls vanished to the underworld;</P>
<P>His seven spirits left the world of men.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The successful robbers left the Kou house, put up a rope ladder from the foot of the city wall, took it in turns to cross and fled Westwards in the rain. Only when they saw that the robbers had gone did the servants of the Kou family dare show their heads again. When they looked for old Mr. Kou and found him lying dead on the floor they started weeping aloud. &#8220;Heavens! The master's been murdered!&#8221; they all said as they wept, embracing the body and sobbing in misery.</P>
<P>When it was almost the fourth watch the resentful Mrs. Kou, who was angry with the Tang Priest and his followers for rejecting their hospitality, and also because the extravagance of their send-off had provoked this disaster, decided to ruin the four of them. Helping Kou Liang to his feet, she said, &#8220;Don't cry, my son. Your father fed monks day in and day out. Who ever would have thought that he would complete the number by feeding a gang of monks who'd murder him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; the brothers asked, &#8220;how did those monks murder him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Those bandits were so bold and vicious that when they charged in I hid under the bed,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;Although I was trembling I made sure to take a very good look at them by the light of the torches. Do you know who they were? The Tang Priest was lighting torches, Pig was holding a knife, Friar Sand was taking the gold and silver, and Monkey killed your father.&#8221; The two sons believed all this.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you saw all that clearly, mother,&#8221; they said, &#8220;you must be right. They spent a fortnight in our house, so they knew all the doors, walls, windows and passageways. They must have been tempted by our wealth and come back here under cover of rain and darkness. How evil! They've stolen our property and murdered our father. Once it's light we'll go to the local government and report them as wanted men.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What sort of wanted notice should we write?&#8221; Kou Dong asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;We'll write what our mother said,&#8221; Kou Liang replied, and he wrote:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Tang Priest lit the torches, Pig incited to murder, Friar Sand stole the gold and silver and Sun the Novice murdered our father.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The whole household was in such a hubbub that before they noticed it day had dawned. While invitations were sent out to their relatives and a coffin was ordered Kou Liang and his brother went to the local government offices to deposit their complaint. Now the prefect of Brazentower:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Had always been upright,</P>
<P>Was good by nature.</P>
<P>As a boy he had studied by the light of the snow;</P>
<P>When young he had taken the palace examinations.</P>
<P>His heart was always set on loyalty and justice,</P>
<P>And filled with thoughts of kindness and benevolence.</P>
<P>His name would be transmitted in annals for a thousand years,</P>
<P>Like a Gong Sui or Huang Ba come back to life;</P>
<P>His fame would resound for ten thousand ages in the balls of office,</P>
<P>Zhuo Mao and Lu Gong reborn.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When he had taken his seat in the hall and declared that all matters could be dealt with, he ordered that the placard asking for plaints should be carried outside. Kou Liang and his brother then came in holding the placard, knelt down and called aloud, &#8220;Your Honour, we have come to denounce some bandits as thieves and murderers.&#8221; The prefect accepted their complaint and read what it had to say.</P>
<P>&#8220;I was told yesterday that your family completed your vow of feeding monks,&#8221; the prefect said, &#8220;by feeding four distinguished ones, arhats from the Tang Dynasty in the East. You made a great display of sending them off with drums and music. So how could such a thing as this have possibly happened?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Honour,&#8221; said Kou Liang, kowtowing, &#8220;our father Kou Hong had been feeding monks for twenty-four years. These four monks who had come from afar just happened to make up the ten thousand, which was why he held a service to mark the completion and kept them there for a fortnight. They got to know all the passageways, doors and windows. They were seen off during the day and came back yesterday evening. During the dark and stormy night they charged into the house with torches and weapons to steal our gold, silver, jewelry, clothes and hair ornaments. They beat our father to death and left him lying on the ground. We beg you to be our protector.&#8221; On hearing this the prefect mustered infantry, cavalry and able-bodied civilian conscripts, 150 men in all, who rushed straight out of the Western gate carrying sharp weapons in pursuit of the Tang Priest and his three disciples.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story now tells how master and disciples stayed in the ruins of the minor palace of padmaprabha until dawn, when they went out and started hurrying Westwards. The bandits, who had gone along the main road West all night till daybreak after robbing the Kou family and leaving the city, had passed the palace of Padmaprabha and hidden in the mountains some six or seven miles to the West. Here they were just dividing up the gold and silver when the Tang Priest and his three followers came into view, also heading West along the road.</P>
<P>The bandits, whose greed was not yet sated, pointed at the Tang Priest and said, &#8220;Look! Aren't they the monks who were seen off yesterday?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;And a very welcome arrival too,&#8221; said the other bandits, laughing, &#8220;Let's do a bit more of our dirty business. Those monks coming along the road spent a long time in the Kou house. Goodness only knows how much stuff they're carrying. Let's hold them up, take their travel money and white horse, and share it all out. That'll suit us very nicely.&#8221; The robbers then rushed to the road, brandishing their weapons and yelling their war cry as they formed a line.</P>
<P>&#8220;Stay where you are, monks,&#8221; they shouted. &#8220;Leave some toll money and we'll spare your lives. If so much as half a 'no' comes out through your teeth you'll all be cut down without mercy.&#8221; The Tang Priest was shaking with terror as he sat on his horse.</P>
<P>&#8220;What are we to do?&#8221; Pig and Friar Sand asked Brother Monkey with alarm. &#8220;What are we to do? We had a miserable night in the rain, and after starting out again this morning we're being robbed by bandits. How true is it that troubles never come singly.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be frightened, Master,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile, &#8220;and stop worrying, brothers. Wait while I go and ask them a few questions.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage put on his tigerskin kilt, straightened up his brocade and cotton tunic, went up to them, put his hands together in front of his chest and asked, &#8220;What are you gentlemen doing?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't you care whether you live or die, you swine?&#8221; the robbers yelled back at him. &#8220;How dare you question us! Have you got no eyes in your head? Don't you realize who we great kings are? Hand your toll money over at once and we'll let you go on your way.&#8221;</P>
<P>When he heard this, Monkey wreathed his face in smiles and replied, &#8220;So you're bandits who hold people up on the road.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Kill him!&#8221; the bandits yelled with fury.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesties,&#8221; said Monkey with feigned terror, &#8220;Your Majesties, I'm only a monk from the country. I don't know the right things to say. Please don't be angry if I've offended you, please don't. If what you want is toll money all you have to do is to ask me: no need to ask the other three. I'm the bookkeeper. All the money we get for chanting sutras and as alms, all we beg and all we're given, goes into the bundles, and I'm in charge of spending it. The man on the horse is my master. All he can do is recite sutras. He doesn't care about anything else. He's forgotten all about wealth and sex, and he's got nothing at all. The black-faced one is a junior I collected on our journey. All he can do is look after the horse. And the one with a long snout is a laborer I hired. He's only good for carrying a pole. Let those three go while I fetch our travel money, cassocks and begging bowls. I'll give you all you want.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You seem to be an honest chap, monk,&#8221; the robbers said, &#8220;so we'll spare your life. Tell the other three to leave their luggage, and we'll let them go.&#8221; Monkey turned back and gave them a look. Friar Sand put down the carrying-pole with the luggage, and led the master's horse as they carried on Westwards. Monkey bowed down to undo the bundle, took a pinch of dust from the ground, and scattered it on the bundle as he said the words of a spell.</P>
<P>It was body-fixing magic, so the moment he shouted, &#8220;Stop!&#8221; the thirty and more bandits all stood stock still, grinding their teeth, staring, their hands apart. None of them could speak or move.</P>
<P>&#8220;Come back, Master,&#8221; shouted Monkey, &#8220;come back!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is terrible,&#8221; said Pig in alarm, &#8220;this is terrible. Big brother's informed on us. He isn't carrying any money on him, and there's no gold or silver in the bundle. He must be calling the master back to ask him to give up his horse. He's going to get the clothes stripped off our backs.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't talk such rubbish, brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand with a laugh. &#8220;Big brother knows what he's doing. He's always been able to beat vicious monsters and demons up till now, so what do we have to fear from a few petty thieves? He must be calling us back because he's got something to say to us. Let's go straight there and find out.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the venerable elder heard this he cheerfully turned his horse round and went back. &#8220;Wukong,&#8221; he called, &#8220;why have you called us back?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Hear what these robbers have got to say for themselves,&#8221; Brother Monkey said.</P>
<P>Pig went up to them, shoved them and asked, &#8220;Why don't you move, bandits?&#8221; The bandits remained completely unconscious and said nothing.</P>
<P>&#8220;They're thick, and dumb too,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;I fixed them by magic,&#8221; said Monkey with a laugh.</P>
<P>&#8220;Even if you fixed them,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;you didn't fix their mouths, so why aren't they making a sound?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please dismount and sit down, Master,&#8221; said Brother Monkey. &#8220;As the saying goes, 'People only get arrested by mistake; they never get released by mistake.' Knock all the robbers over, brother, and tie them up. Then we'll force them to make statements. Find out if they're beginners or old hands.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Haven't got any rope,&#8221; said Friar Sand. Monkey then pulled out some of his hairs, blew on them with magic breath and turned them into thirty lengths of rope. They all set to, knocked the robbers over, and tied their hands and feet together. Then Monkey said the words that ended the spell, whereupon the bandits gradually revived.</P>
<P>Monkey invited the Tang Priest to take the seat of honour while he and the other two shouted, holding their weapons, &#8220;Hairy bandits! How many of you are there altogether, and how many years have you been in this line of business? How many things have you stolen? Have you murdered anyone? Is this your first offence? Or your second? Or your third?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Spare our lives, your lordships,&#8221; pleaded the robbers.</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop shouting,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;and come clean.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We aren't hardened robbers, your lordships,&#8221; they said. &#8220;We're all from good families. Because we're a bad lot we squandered all the wealth we'd inherited in drinking, gambling, whoring and living it up. We've never worked, and now we've got no money either. We found out that Mr. Kou's family was one of the richest in the prefecture of Brazentower, so last night we got together to rob it under cover of darkness and rain. We stole some gold, silver, clothing and jewelry, and were just dividing it up in a mountain hollow to the North of the track when we noticed you gentlemen coming. Some of us recognized you as the monks Mr. Kou saw off, so we were sure that you must have some goods on you. Then we saw how heavy your luggage was and how fast the white horse was going. It was our disgraceful greed that made us try to hold you up. Never did we imagine that you would have such divine powers and be able to tie us up. We beg you to be merciful to us. Take back what we stole and spare our lives.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang was violently shocked to hear that their booty had been stolen from the Kou household. He stood up at once and said, &#8220;Mr. Kou was a very good man, Wukong, so how did he bring such a disaster on himself?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It was all because the coloured hangings and fancy parasols, and the huge numbers of drummers and musicians when we were seen off attracted too much attention,&#8221; replied Monkey with a smile. &#8220;That's why this gang of desperadoes attacked his house. Luckily they ran into us, and we've taken back all the gold, silver, clothing and jewelry.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We put Mr. Kou out for a whole fortnight,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;so we owe him a huge debt of gratitude that we have not yet been able to repay. Would it not be a good deed to return this property to his house?&#8221; Monkey agreed, and he went to the mountain hollow with Pig and Friar Sand to fetch the booty, which they packed up and loaded on the horse. He told Pig to carry the load of gold and silver while friar Sand carried their own luggage. Monkey was just on the point of killing all the bandits with his cudgel when he had the worrying thought that the Tang Priest might get angry with him for committing murder. So he could only shake himself and take back all the hairs. Now that their hands and feet had been untied the thieves all got up then fled for their lives into the undergrowth. The Tang Priest then turned back the way he had come to return the booty to Mr. Kou. In making this journey he was like a moth flying into a flame and coming to disaster. There is a poem about it that goes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Kindness to others is rarely with kindness rewarded;</P>
<P>Kindness will often to hate and hostility lead.</P>
<P>Plunge in the water to rescue the drowning? You'll suffer.</P>
<P>Think before acting and spare yourself grief you don't need.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sanzang and his disciples were just heading back with the gold, silver, clothing and jewelry when the crowd of men armed with spears and swords arrived. &#8220;Disciples,&#8221; said Sanzang with alarm, &#8220;look at all those armed men coming here. What is happening?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's a disaster,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;a disaster. They're the robbers we set free. They've found weapons and ganged up with some more people. Now they've come back and they're going to kill us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They don't look like bandits, brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;Big brother, take a closer look.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The master's in bad trouble again,&#8221; Monkey whispered to Friar Sand. &#8220;These must be soldiers here to capture the bandits.&#8221; Before he had finished saying this the soldiers were upon the master and his disciples, surrounding them.</P>
<P>&#8220;You're a fine bunch of monks,&#8221; they said, &#8220;robbing a house then swaggering around here like this.&#8221; They then rushed them, dragged the Tang Priest off his horse and tied him up. Next they tied up Brother Monkey and the others, and carried them off hanging from poles, two men to each of them. Driving the horse along and seizing the baggage, they went back to the prefectural city. This is what could be seen:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Tang Priest,</P>
<P>Shivering and shaking,</P>
<P>Weeping and lost for words.</P>
<P>Zhu Bajie,</P>
<P>Muttering and grumbling,</P>
<P>Full of complaints.</P>
<P>Friar Sand,</P>
<P>Talking away,</P>
<P>While secretly feeling uncertain.</P>
<P>Sun the Novice,</P>
<P>Chuckling merrily,</P>
<P>Ready to use his powers.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Hustled and carried along by the soldiers, they were soon back in the city, where the soldiers escorted them straight to the prefect's court.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Honour,&#8221; they reported, &#8220;the constables have captured the robbers and brought them back.&#8221; The prefect, sitting in his place in the court, rewarded the constables, inspected the booty and sent for the Kou family to collect it. Then he had Sanzang and the others brought into court.</P>
<P>&#8220;You monks maintain that you come from a place far away to the East and are going to worship the Buddha in the Western Heaven,&#8221; he said, interrogating them. &#8220;But really you're housebreakers who used dirty tricks so that you could get to know your way around.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Honour,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;we are not robbers. I would not dare to deceive you. We carry a passport with us as proof. It was because we were so grateful to Mr. Kou's family for feeding us for a fortnight that when we ran into the robbers along our way we recovered the booty they had stolen from the Kou house. We were taking it back to the Kou house to pay our debt of gratitude when to our astonishment we were arrested as robbers by the constables. We really are not robbers, and I beg Your Honour to investigate closely.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You only made up that fancy talk about paying a debt of gratitude because you were arrested by the soldiers,&#8221; the prefect replied. &#8220;If you really met other robbers why didn't you show your gratitude by capturing them and turning them in? Why are only the four of you here? Look at the wanted notice Kou Liang submitted. He accuses you by name. How dare you still dispute it!&#8221; When Sanzang heard this he felt like a storm-tossed boat on the ocean, and all his souls flew away.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; he said, &#8220;why don't you come forward and argue in our defense?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The booty proves it,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Arguing would do no good.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's right,&#8221; the prefect said. &#8220;The booty is all here as proof. Do you still dare to deny it? Fetch the head-clamp,&#8221; he instructed his underlings, &#8220;and put it round the head of the bald robber. Then beat him again.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey was now very anxious. &#8220;Even though my master is fated to suffer this,&#8221; he thought to himself, &#8220;I mustn't let it be too tough for him.&#8221; Seeing the yamen runners tightening the cord to fix the head-clamp in place he opened his mouth to speak.</P>
<P>&#8220;Please don't squeeze that monk's head, Your Honour. When we robbed the Kou house last night I was the one who lit the torches, carried the sword, stole the goods and killed the man. I was the ringleader. If you want to torture anyone, torture me. It's nothing to do with them. The only thing is that you mustn't let me go.&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing this the prefect ordered, &#8220;Put the clamp on him first.&#8221; The underlings then all fell on Monkey, fixed the clamp on his head, and tightened it so hard that the cord snapped with a twang. The clamp was fastened, tightened and snapped with a twang again. They did this three or four times, and the skin on his head was not even creased.</P>
<P>When they changed the cord and were tightening it again someone was heard coming in to report, &#8220;Your Honour, the Lord Assistant Protector Chen from the capital is coming. Will you please come to greet him outside the city?&#8221;</P>
<P>The prefect then ordered the head torturer, &#8220;Throw the bandits into gaol and keep a good eye on them. The torture and interrogation will continue after I have gone to greet my superior.&#8221; The head torturer then marched the Tang Priest and the other three into the gaol. Pig and Friar Sand carried their luggage in with them.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;what are we to do?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In you go, Master,&#8221; said Monkey with a grin, &#8220;in you go. There aren't any dogs barking in there. It'll be a lark.&#8221; The four of them were then taken inside, and each of them was pushed on a torture rack, to which their bellies, heads and chests were tightly fastened. The warders then started beating them up again.</P>
<P>Finding the agony unbearable, Sanzang called out, &#8220;Whatever shall I do, Wukong? Whatever shall I do?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They're beating us because they want money,&#8221; Brother Monkey replied. &#8220;As the saying goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Stay put when things are going well;</P>
<P>Spend cash when things are going ill.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>They'll stop if you give them some money.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But where am I to get money from?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you haven't any money,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;clothes will do. Give them the cassock.&#8221;</P>
<P>These words cut Sanzang to the heart, but realizing that the beating was more than he could take he could only say, &#8220;Do as you will, Wukong.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; Monkey called out, &#8220;there's no need to beat us any more. There's a brocade cassock in one of the two bundles we brought in with us that's worth a fortune. Open them up and take it.&#8221; When the warders heard this they all set to together, opening the bundles up to search them. There were some cotton clothes and a document case, but none of these were worth anything. Seeing something glowing brightly inside several layers of oiled paper the warders realized that it must be a treasure. When they shook it open and looked at it, this is what it looked like:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Exquisitely decorated with shining pearls,</P>
<P>Set with some wonderful Buddha treasures.</P>
<P>Embroidered dragons curled around;</P>
<P>Flying phoenixes adorned brocade edges.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As they all struggled to look they disturbed the head gaoler, who came up to them and shouted, &#8220;What are you all making this row about?&#8221;</P>
<P>Falling to their knees, the warders replied, &#8220;His Honour has just started a case against four monks and sent them here. When we roughed them up a bit they gave us these two bundles. After we opened them we saw this, and we don't know how to deal with it. It would be a real pity to tear it up to divide between us, but it would be hard on everyone else if just one of us had it. It's a good thing you've come, sir: you can give us a ruling.&#8221; The head gaoler could see that it was a cassock. Then he inspected the other clothes and the document case, and on opening the case to read the passport he saw that it was covered with seals and signatures from many states.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's a good thing I saw this in time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If I hadn't, you people would have caused bad trouble. These monks aren't robbers. On no account touch their things. When His Honour questions them again tomorrow we'll find out the truth.&#8221; The warders then gave the wrapping cloths back to the prisoners, who repacked them and handed them over to the head gaoler for safekeeping.</P>
<P>Evening was slowly drawing in. The drum could be heard from its tower, and the fire wardens began their patrols. By the third mark of the fourth watch Monkey could see that the others had stopped groaning and were fast asleep. &#8220;The master was fated to meet with the hardship of a night in gaol,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;That was why I said nothing in our defense and didn't use my magic powers. But now the fourth watch is nearly over, and his suffering's almost done. I'd better start getting things sorted out if we're to leave this gaol at dawn.&#8221;</P>
<P>Just watch as he uses his powers to make himself smaller, get off the rack, shake himself and turn into a midge who flies out of the prison through a gap between the tiles over the eaves. By the light of the stars and the moon in the still, silent night sky, he could see where he was going, and he flew quietly straight towards the gates of the Kou house. On the West side of the road was a house where a lamp was shining brightly, and as he flew closer for a better look he saw that it was a house of beancurd-makers. An old man could be seen looking after the fire while an old woman was squeezing out the bean juice.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wife,&#8221; the old man suddenly called out, &#8220;Mr. Kou had wealth and sons, but he didn't live long. When we were boys we were both at school together. I was five years older than him. His father was called Kou Ming. In those days he had less than 150 acres. He couldn't even collect his overdue rents. Old Kou Ming died when his son was nineteen, and once the young man took charge of the household things went really well. He married the daughter of Zhang Wang&#8212;she used to be known as Threadneedle when she was a girl, but she made her husband a rich man. Once she came into his house his crops were good and the debts to him got paid. Whatever he bought showed a profit, and whatever he went in for made money. His family's worth a hundred thousand now. When he reached forty he turned pious and he fed ten thousand monks. Fancy him being kicked to death by robbers last night! Poor man. He was only sixty-four. Who would have thought so good a man would meet with so evil a reward and be murdered just when everything was going well for him? What a pity! What a pity!&#8221;</P>
<P>By the time Monkey had listened to all this it was now at the first mark of the fifth watch. He then flew into the Kou house, where a coffin was placed in the main room. A lamp was burning at the head, and around the coffin was incense, candles and fruit. His wife was weeping beside him, and the two sons also came to kowtow and weep, while their wives brought two bowls of rice as an offering. Monkey landed at the head of the coffin and coughed. This gave the two daughters-in-law such a fright that they ran outside waving their arms about.</P>
<P>Kou Liang and his brother lay on the floor, too terrified to move, and crying out, &#8220;Oh, father, oh!&#8221; Their mother, being bolder, hit the head of the coffin and said, &#8220;Have you come back to life, old man?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Monkey, imitating Mr. Kou's voice, to the great alarm of the two sons, who kept kowtowing, weeping, and repeating, &#8220;Oh, Father, oh!&#8221;</P>
<P>Their mother summoned up even more courage to ask, &#8220;Husband, if you haven't come back to life why are you talking?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;King Yama has sent demons to bring me here to talk to you,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;He told me that Threadneedle Zhang had been lying and trying to frame the innocent.&#8221;</P>
<P>In her surprise at hearing him call her by the name she had been known as a child, the old woman fell at once to her knees, kowtowed and said, &#8220;You're a fine old man! Fancy calling me by my childhood name at this age! What lies have I been telling? Which innocent people have I framed?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wasn't there something about 'The Tang Priest lit the torches, Pig incited to murder, Friar Sand stole the gold and silver, and Sun the Novice murdered our father?'&#8220; Monkey replied. &#8220;Your lies have landed those good men in terrible trouble. What really happened was that the Tang Priest and the other three teachers met some bandits and got our property back for us to show their thanks. How good of them! But you had to concoct a wanted notice and send our sons to denounce them to the authorities. The court threw them in gaol without making a careful investigation. The gaol god, the local deity and the city god were all so alarmed and uneasy that they reported it to King Yama, and he ordered demons to escort me back home. I'm to tell you to have them released as soon as possible. If you don't, I will have to make havoc here for a month. Nobody in the household, young or old&#8212;not even the dogs and the chickens&#8212;will be spared.&#8221;</P>
<P>Kou Liang and his brother kowtowed again and begged, &#8220;Please go back, Father, and don't harm us all. At dawn we'll submit a petition to the court for their release and withdraw our charge against them. We only want peace for both the living and the dead.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he called out, &#8220;Burn sacrificial paper money. I am leaving.&#8221; All his family started burning paper money. Monkey then rose up on his wings and flew straight to the prefect's residence. Bending low to look he saw that there was a light in the bedroom: the prefect was already up. When Monkey flew into the main room, he saw a scroll-painting hanging on the back wall. It showed an official riding a piebald horse with several servants holding a blue umbrella and carrying a folding chair. Monkey did not know what the picture was about, but landed in the middle of it. All of a sudden the prefect came out of the bedroom and bent low to comb and wash himself. Monkey gave a sharp cough, alarming the prefect and sending him hurrying back into his bedroom. When he had combed his hair, washed himself and put on his formal clothes the prefect came out to burn incense to the picture and pray to it.</P>
<P>&#8220;Venerable uncle, divine Jiang Qianyi, your dutiful nephew Jiang Kunsan is now prefect of Brazentower, thanks to the hereditary privilege won for me by your ancestral virtue, and also to my success in the examinations. Morning and evening I offer incense without interruption. Why did you speak today? I beg you not to haunt us and terrify the household.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So this is a holy picture of his ancestor,&#8221; Brother Monkey thought with a hidden smile, and making the most of this chance he called out, &#8220;Nephew Kunsan, you have always been uncorrupt in the office you were given through ancestral privilege. How could you have been so stupid yesterday? You took four holy monks for thieves and threw them into prison without finding out why they had come. The prison god, the local deity and the city god were all so disturbed by this that they reported it to the king of Hell. He told demon envoys to bring me here to speak to you and advise you to consider the circumstances and find out the truth, and release them at once. Otherwise you'll have to come back to the Underworld with me for the case to be sorted out.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the prefect heard this he replied in terror, &#8220;Please go back now, sit. Your nephew will go straight into court and release them at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well then,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;Burn some sacrificial paper money. I am going to report back to King Yama.&#8221; The prefect lit incense, burned paper money and bowed in thanks. When Monkey flew out again and looked around he saw that the East was already turning white. He then flew to the Diling county office, where all the county officials could be seen in the courtroom.</P>
<P>&#8220;If I talk when I'm a midge,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;and someone spots me it'll give the game away. That wouldn't do.&#8221; So he gave himself a giant magical body where he was in mid air, and stretched down one foot that filled the whole courtroom. &#8220;Listen to me, you officials,&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;I am the Roving God Rambler, sent here by the Jade Emperor. He says that sons of the Buddha on their way to fetch the scriptures have been beaten up in the prefectural gaol here, which has disturbed the gods of the three worlds. He has asked me to tell you to release them at once. If anything goes wrong I'm to use my other foot to kick all you county and prefecture officials to death, then crush all the people around here and trample the whole city to dust and ashes.&#8221; At this the county magistrate and the other officials all fell to their knees and kowtowed in worship.</P>
<P>&#8220;Please go back now, superior sage,&#8221; they pleaded. &#8220;We are now going to the prefectural offices to request His Honour to release them immediately. We implore you not to move your feet and terrify us to death.&#8221; Only then did Monkey put away that magical body, turn into a midge again and fly back into the gaol through a gap between the tiles at the eaves, climb into his rack and go to sleep.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story now tells that no sooner had the prefect entered his courtroom and ordered the notice inviting people to submit written requests to be carried outside than Kou Liang and his brother fell to their knees at the entrance, holding the notice in their arms. The prefect ordered them to come in, and when the prefect read the document that the two of them submitted he said in fury, &#8220;Yesterday you handed me a wanted notice. The thieves were arrested and you had the booty back. So why are you asking for them to be released today?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Honour,&#8221; the two brothers replied, tears streaming down, &#8220;last night our father's spirit appeared to us and said 'the holy monks from Tang captured the bandits, took our property back from them, released them and were kindly bringing the goods back to us to show their gratitude. How could you have treated them as robbers, captured them and made them suffer in gaol? The local god in the gaol and the city god were so alarmed and uneasy that they reported it to King Yama. King Yama ordered demons to escort me back to tell you to go to the prefectural court and submit another plea for the Tang Priest's release and thus avoid disaster. Otherwise everybody in the household would be killed.' This is why we have come with this request for their release. We beg you to help us, Your Honour.&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing this the prefect thought, &#8220;Their father is a new ghost whose body is still warm, so it's not surprising that he should have appeared to them after what happened. But my uncle has been dead for five or six years. Why did he appear to me early this morning and tell me to investigate and release them? It really does look as though an injustice has been done.&#8221;</P>
<P>As the prefect was thinking things over the magistrate and other officials of Diling county came rushing into the courtroom to say in a wild panic, &#8220;Disaster, Your Honour, disaster! The Jade Emperor has just sent the Roving God Rambler down to earth to tell you to release those good men from gaol this very moment. The monks captured yesterday weren't robbers: they are disciples of the Buddha going to fetch the scriptures. If there's any delay he's going to kick all us officials to death, then trample the whole city and all the people in it to dust and ashes.&#8221; The prefect turned pale at this new shock, then told the head gaoler to write a release order and deliver them to the court. The prison doors were immediately opened and they were led out.</P>
<P>&#8220;Goodness knows what sort of beating we're in for today,&#8221; said Pig gloomily.</P>
<P>&#8220;I can guarantee that they won't dare give you a single clout,&#8221; said Monkey with a grin. &#8220;I've fixed everything up. When you go into the courtroom you absolutely mustn't kneel. He'll come down into the court to invite us to take the best seats. Then we'll ask for our luggage and the horse back from him. If anything's missing I'll give him a beating for your entertainment.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before he had finished speaking they reached the entrance to the courtroom, where the prefect, the county magistrate and all the other officials came out to welcome them with the words, &#8220;When you holy monks arrived yesterday we were under urgent pressure to meet our superiors. In addition, we did see the stolen goods. That is why we did not find out the truth.&#8221; The Tang Priest put his hands together in front of his chest, bowed and recounted in detail everything that had happened.</P>
<P>The officials were all voluble in admitting, &#8220;We were wrong, we were wrong. Please, please don't be angry with us.&#8221;</P>
<P>They then asked if the monks had lost anything in the prison. Monkey stepped forward, opened his eyes wide in a glare and yelled at the top of his voice, &#8220;Our white horse was taken by the court officers, and the gaolers took our luggage. Give it back right now. It's our turn to torture and question you lot how. What should the punishment for wrongfully arresting innocent people as bandits be?&#8221;</P>
<P>Seeing how ugly he was acting, the prefectural and county officials were all terrified. They told the people who had taken the horse to return the horse, and the men who had taken the luggage to return every single piece of it. Just look at how viciously the three disciples start acting, while the officials could only blame the Kou family to cover up their own blunder.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciples,&#8221; said Sanzang, trying to calm them down. &#8220;Let us go to the Kou house to question them and argue it out with them in order to make everything clear. Then we can find out who it was who took us for robbers.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Good idea,&#8221; said Brother Monkey. &#8220;I'll call the dead man back and ask him who killed him.&#8221;</P>
<P>Friar Sand hoisted the Tang Priest up on the horse right there in the courtroom, then escorted him outside with much shouting. All the prefectural and county officials accompanied them to the Kou house, so alarming Kou Liang and his brother that they kowtowed repeatedly in front of the gateway then led them into the hall. This was where old Mr. Kou's coffin lay, and the whole family was to be seen weeping inside the mourning drapes around it.</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop howling, you lying old woman,&#8221; Monkey shouted. &#8220;You tried to get innocent men killed. Wait till I call your husband back. We'll see what he has to say about who murdered him. That'll shame her.&#8221; The officials all thought that Monkey was joking, but then he said, &#8220;Please keep my master company for a moment, Your Honors, Pig, Friar Sand, protect him well. I'm off. I'll soon be back.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage bounded outside and rose up into the sky.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Coloured clouds were all around to cover up the house.</P>
<P>Auspicious auras filled the sky to protect the primal deity.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Only then did everyone recognize that Monkey was an immortal who could ride clouds and mists, and a sage who could bring the dead back to life. We will not tell of how they all burned incense and worshipped.</P>
<P>The Great Sage went straight to the Underworld by somersault cloud and charged into the Senluo Palace, causing such alarm that:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Ten Kings of the Underworld came out to raise their bands in greeting;</P>
<P>The demon judges of the five regions kowtowed in welcome.</P>
<P>A thousand trees of knives all leaned away;</P>
<P>Ten thousand hills of swords all leveled themselves.</P>
<P>In the City of the Unjustly Slain the fiends were converted;</P>
<P>Under the bridge over Punishment River the dead return to life.</P>
<P>The divine light was like the grace of Heaven,</P>
<P>And everywhere shone bright in the palaces of darkness.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Ten Kings received the Great Sage, greeted him, and asked him why he had come. &#8220;Who's got the ghost of Kou Hong who used to feed monks in Diling County in the prefecture of Brazentower?&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Find him and give him to me at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Kou Hong is a very good man,&#8221; the Ten King replied. &#8220;He came here himself. No demon had to envoys drag him here with their hooks. He met King Ksitigarbha's Goldenclad Boy, who took him to see Ksitigarbha.&#8221; Monkey then took his leave of them and went straight to the Turquoise Cloud Palace, where he saw the Bodhisattva King Ksitigarbha. When the Bodhisattva had greeted him Monkey explained what had happened.</P>
<P>&#8220;Liang Hong's allotted span had been completed,&#8221; the Bodhisattva said with delight, &#8220;and his life was over. That is why he left the world behind and came here without touching his bed. As he was such a good man who had fed monks I have made him a chief recorder in charge of the register of good deeds. But since you have come here to fetch him, Great Sage, I shall grant him a twelve-year extension of his life on earth. Let him leave with the Great Sage.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Goldenclad Boy then led out Kou Hong, who on seeing Monkey kept saying, &#8220;Teacher, save me! Teacher!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You were kicked to death by robbers,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;and now you're in the Bodhisattva King Ksitigarbha's place in the Under world. I've come to fetch you and take you to the world of the living to sort this matter out. The Bodhisattva will let you go back and has given you another twelve years of life, after which you'll come back here.&#8221; The old gentleman kowtowed to him endlessly.</P>
<P>Having thanked and taken his leave of the Bodhisattva, Monkey blew on Kou Hong, turned him into vapor, tucked him into his sleeve and left the Underworld to go back to the world of the living. He rode his cloud back to the Kou house, told Pig to lever the lid off the coffin and pushed Kou Hong's spirit back into the body.</P>
<P>A moment later Kou Hong started breathing as he came back to life. Climbing out of his coffin, he kowtowed to the Tang Priest and his three disciples with the words, &#8220;Teachers, teachers, I was wrongly killed, but my master went to the Underworld to bring me back to life. I owe him my recovery.&#8221;</P>
<P>His thanks were unending. When he turned round and saw all the officials drawn up in line he kowtowed again and asked, &#8220;Why are all your lordships in my house?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your sons first submitted a wanted notice,&#8221; the prefect replied, &#8220;and accused the holy monks by name. I sent men to arrest them, not realizing that the holy monks had met the robbers who raided your house, taken the booty off them and were returning it to your house. I was wrong to have them arrested, and I had them thrown into gaol without making a detailed investigation. Last night your spirit appeared, my late uncle came to lodge a complaint with me, and the Roving God Rambler came down to earth in the county offices. After so many manifestations I released the holy monks, and they have brought you back to life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Honour,&#8221; said Mr. Kou on his knees, &#8220;these four holy monks really have been wronged. That night over thirty bandits with torches and weapons robbed my house. Because I could not bear to lose all those things I tried to reason with the robbers, but to my horror they kicked me to death. What's it got to do with these four gentlemen?&#8221;</P>
<P>He then called for his wife. &#8220;Why did you people make that lying report about who had killed me? Will you please determine their punishments, Your Honour.&#8221; Everyone in the family, young and old alike, kowtowed. In his magnanimity the prefect spared them from punishment. Kou Hong then ordered a banquet to thank the prefectural and county officials for their generosity. The officials all returned to their offices without sitting down at the banquet. The next day the sign announcing that monks would be fed was hung out again, and another attempt was made to keep Sanzang there. Sanzang refused absolutely to stay any longer. Once again Mr. Kou invited his friends and relations, arranged for flags and canopies and saw them off as before. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>However remote the place evil deeds can be done;</P>
<P>Heaven may be high, but it does not desert the good.</P>
<P>Steadily they plod along towards the Tathagata</P>
<P>Until they reach the gate of bliss on Vulture Peak.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you do not know what happened when they met the Buddha, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>金酬外护遭魔毒</P>
<p>圣显幽魂救本原</p>
</div>
<p>且不言唐僧等在华光破屋中，苦奈夜雨存身。却说铜台府地灵县城内有伙凶徒，因宿娼、饮酒、赌博，花费了家私，无计过活，遂伙了十数人做贼，算道本城那家是第一个财主，那家是第二个财主，去打劫些金银用度。内有一人道：“也不用缉访，也不须算计，只有今日送那唐朝和尚的寇员外家，十分富厚。我们乘此夜雨，街上人也不防备，火甲等也不巡逻，就此下手，劫他些资本，我们再去嫖赌儿耍子，岂不美哉！众贼欢喜，齐了心，都带了短刀、蒺藜、拐子、闷棍、麻绳、火把，冒雨前来，打开寇家大门，呐喊杀入。慌得他家里若大若小，是男是女，俱躲个干净。妈妈儿躲在床底，老头儿闪在门后，寇梁、寇栋与着亲的几个儿女，都战战兢兢的四散逃走顾命。那伙贼，拿着刀，点着火，将他家箱笼打开，把些金银宝贝，首饰衣裳，器皿家火，尽情搜劫。那员外割舍不得，拚了命，走出门来对众强人哀告道：“列位大王，彀你用的便罢，还留几件衣物与我老汉送终”那众强人那容分说，赶上前，把寇员外撩阴一脚踢翻在地，可怜三魂渺渺归阴府，七魄悠悠别世人！众贼得了手，走出寇家，顺城脚做了软梯，漫城墙一一系出，冒着雨连夜奔西而去。</p>

<p>那寇家僮仆、见贼退了，方才出头。及看时，老员外已死在地下，放声哭道：“天呀！主人公已打死了！”众皆伏尸而哭，悲悲啼啼。</p>

<p>将四更时，那妈妈想恨唐僧等不受他的斋供，因为花扑扑的送他，惹出这场灾祸，便生妒害之心，欲陷他四众，扶着寇梁道：“儿啊，不须哭了。你老子今日也斋僧，明日也斋僧，岂知今日做圆满，斋着那一伙送命的僧也！”他兄弟道：“母亲，怎么是送命的僧？”妈妈道：“贼势凶勇，杀进房来，我就躲在床下，战兢兢的留心向灯火处看得明白，你说是谁？点火的是唐僧，持刀的是猪八戒，搬金银的是沙和尚，打死你老子的是孙行者。”</p>

<p>二子听言，认了真实道：“母亲既然看得明白，必定是了。他四人在我家住了半月，将我家门户墙垣，窗棂巷道，俱看熟了，财动人心，所以乘此夜雨，复到我家，既劫去财物，又害了父亲，此情何毒！待天明到府里递失状坐名告他。”寇栋道：“失状如何写？”寇梁道：“就依母亲之言。”写道：“唐僧点着火，八戒叫杀人。沙和尚劫出金银去，孙行者打死我父亲。”一家子吵吵闹闹，不觉天晓。一壁厢传请亲人，置办棺木；一壁厢寇梁兄弟，赴府投词。原来这铜台府刺史正堂大人，平生正直，素性贤良。</p>

<p>少年向雪案攻书，早岁在金銮对策。常怀忠义之心，每切仁慈之念。名扬青史播千年，龚黄再见；声振黄堂传万古，卓鲁重生。当时坐了堂，发放了一应事务，即令抬出放告牌。这寇梁兄弟抱牌而入，跪倒高叫道：“爷爷，小的们是告强盗得财，杀伤人命重情事。”刺史接上状去，看了这般这的，如此如彼，即问道：“昨日有人传说，你家斋僧圆满，斋得四众高僧，乃东土唐朝的罗汉，花扑扑的满街鼓乐送行，怎么却有这般事情？”寇梁等磕头道：“爷爷，小的父亲寇洪斋僧二十四年，因这四僧远来，恰足万僧之数，因此做了圆满，留他住了半月。他就将路道、门窗都看熟了。当日送出，当晚复回，乘黑夜风雨，遂明火执杖，杀进房来，劫去金银财宝，衣服首饰，又将父打死在地。</p>

<p>望爷爷与小民做主！”刺史闻言，即点起马步快手并民壮人役，共有百五十人，各执锋利器械，出西门一直来赶唐僧四众。</p>

<p>却说他师徒们，在那华光行院破屋下挨至天晓方才出门，上路奔西。可可的那些强盗当夜打劫了寇家，系出城外，也向西方大路上，行经天晓，走过华光院西去，有二十里远近，藏于山凹中，分拨金银等物。分还未了，忽见唐僧四众顺路而来，众贼心犹不歇，指定唐僧道：“那不是昨日送行的和尚来了！”众贼笑道：“来得好！来得好！我们也是干这般没天理的买卖。这些和尚缘路来，又在寇家许久，不知身边有多少东西，我们索性去截住他，夺了盘缠，抢了白马凑分，却不是遂心满意之事？”众贼遂持兵器，呐一声喊，跑上大路，一字儿摆开，叫道：</p>

<p>“和尚，不要走！快留下买路钱，饶你性命！牙迸半个不字，一刀一个，决不留存！”唬得个唐僧在马上乱战，沙僧与八戒心慌，对行者道：“怎的了！怎的了！苦奈得半夜雨天，又早遇强徒断路，诚所谓祸不单行也！”行者笑道：！师父莫怕，兄弟勿忧。等老孙去问他一问。”</p>

<p>好大圣，束一束虎皮裙子，抖一抖锦布直裰，走近前，叉手当胸道：“列位是做甚么的？”贼徒喝道：“这厮不知死活，敢来问我！你额颅下没眼，不认得我是大王爷爷！快将买路钱来，放你过去！”行者闻言，满面陪笑道：“你原来是剪径的强盗！”</p>

<p>贼徒发狠叫：“杀了！”行者假假的惊恐道：“大王！大王！我是乡村中的和尚，不会说话，冲撞莫怪，莫怪！若要买路钱，不要问那三个，只消问我。我是个管帐的，凡有经钱、衬钱，那里化缘的、布施的，都在包袱中，尽是我管出入，那个骑马的，虽是我的师父，他却只会念经，不管闲事，财色俱忘，一毫没有。那个黑脸的，是我半路上收的个后生，只会养马。那个长嘴的，是我雇的长工，只会挑担。你把三个放过去，我将盘缠衣钵尽情送你。”众贼听说：“这个和尚倒是个老实头儿。既如此，饶了你命，教那三个丢下行李，放他过去。”行者回头使个眼色，沙僧就丢了行李担子，与师父牵着马，同八戒往西径走。行者低头打开包袱，就地挝把尘土，往上一洒，念个咒语，乃是个定身之法，喝一声“住！”那伙贼共有三十来名，一个个咬着牙，睁着眼，撒着手，直直的站定，莫能言语，不得动身。行者跳出路口叫道：“师父，回来！回来！”八戒慌了道：“不好，不好！师兄供出我们来了！他身上又无钱财，包袱里又无金银，必定是叫师父要马哩，叫我们是剥衣服了。”沙僧笑道：“二哥莫乱说！大哥是个了得的，向者那般毒魔狠怪，也能收服，怕这几个毛贼？他那里招呼，必有话说，快回去看看。”长老听言，欣然转马回至边前，叫道：“悟空，有甚事叫回来也？”行者者：“你们看这些贼是怎的说？”八戒近前推着他，叫道：“强盗，你怎的不动弹了？”</p>

<p>那贼浑然无知，不言不语。八戒道：“好的痴哑了！”行者笑道：</p>

<p>“是老孙使个定身法定住也。”八戒道：“既定了身，未曾定口，怎么连声也不做？“行者道：“师父请下马坐着。常言道，只有错拿，没有错放。兄弟，你们把贼都扳翻倒捆了，教他供一个供状，看他是个雏儿强盗，把势强盗。”沙僧道：“没绳索哩。”行者即拔下些毫毛，吹口仙气，变作三十条绳索，一齐下手，把贼扳翻，都四马攒蹄捆住，却又念念解咒，那伙贼渐渐苏醒。</p>

<p>行者请唐僧坐在上首，他三人各执兵器喝道：“毛贼，你们一起有多少人？做了几年买卖？打劫了有多少东西？可曾杀伤人口？还是初犯，却是二犯，三犯？”众贼开口道：“爷爷饶命！”行者道：“莫叫唤！从实供来！”众贼道：“老爷，我们不是久惯做贼的，都是好人家子弟。只因不才，吃酒赌钱，宿娼顽耍，将父祖家业尽花费了，一向无干，又无钱用。访知铜台府城中寇员外家资财豪富，昨日合伙，当晚乘夜雨昏黑，就去打劫。劫的有些金银服饰，在这路北下山凹里正自分赃，忽见老爷们来。内中有认得是寇员外送行的，必定身边有物；又见行李沉重，白马快走，人心不足，故又来邀截。岂知老爷有大神通法力，将我们困住。万望老爷慈悲，收去那劫的财物，饶了我的性命也！”三藏听说是寇家劫的财物，猛然吃了一惊，慌忙站起道：“悟空，寇老员外十分好善，如何招此灾厄？”行者笑道：“只为送我们起身，那等彩帐花幢，盛张鼓乐，惊动了人眼目，所以这伙光棍就去下手他家。今又幸遇着我们，夺下他这许多金银服饰。三藏道：“我们扰他半月，感激厚恩，无以为报，不如将此财物护送他家，却不是一件好事？”行者依言，即与八戒、沙僧，去山凹里取将那些赃物，收拾了，驮在马上。又教八戒挑了一担金银，沙僧挑着自己行李。行者欲将这伙强盗一棍尽情打死，又恐唐僧怪他伤人性命，只得将身一抖，收上毫毛。那伙贼松了手脚，爬起来，一个个落草逃生而去。这唐僧转步回身，将财物送还员外。这一去，却似飞蛾投火，反受其殃。有诗为证，诗曰：恩将恩报人间少，反把恩慈变作仇。下水救人终有失，三思行事却无忧。</p>

<p>三藏师徒们将着金银服饰拿转，正行处，忽见那枪刀簇簇而来。三藏大惊道：“徒弟，你看那兵器簇拥相临，是甚好歹？”</p>

<p>八戒道：“祸来了，祸来了！这是那放去的强盗，他取了兵器，又伙了些人，转过路来与我们斗杀也！”沙僧道：“二哥，那来的不是贼势。大哥，你仔细观之。”行者悄悄的向沙僧道：“师父的灾星又到了，此必是官兵捕贼之意。”说不了，众兵卒至边前，撒开个圈子阵，把他师徒围住道：“好和尚，打劫了人家东西，还在这里摇摆哩！”一拥上前，先把唐僧抓下马来，用绳捆了，又把行者三人，也一齐捆了，穿上扛子，两个抬一个，赶着马，夺了担，径转府城。只见那：唐三藏，战战兢兢，滴泪难言。猪八戒，絮絮叨叨，心中报怨。沙和尚，囊突突，意下踌躇。孙行者，笑唏唏，要施手段。众官兵攒拥扛抬，须臾间拿到城里，径自解上黄堂报道：“老爷，民快人等，捕获强盗来了。”那刺史端坐堂上，赏劳了民快，捡看了贼赃，当叫寇家领去，却将三藏等提近厅前，问道：“你这起和尚，口称是东土远来，向西天拜佛，却原来是些设法躧看门路，打家劫舍之贼！”三藏道：“大人容告：贫僧实不是贼，决不敢假，随身现有通关文牒可照。只因寇员外家斋我等半月，情意深重，我等路遇强盗，夺转打劫寇家的财物，因送还寇家报恩，不期民快人等捉获，以为是贼，实不是贼。望大人详察。”刺史道：“你这厮见官兵捕获，却巧言报恩。</p>

<p>既是路遇强盗，何不连他捉来，报官报恩？如何只是你四众！你看！寇梁递得失状，坐名告你，你还敢展挣？”三藏闻言，一似大海烹舟，魂飞魄丧，叫：“悟空，你何不上来折辨！”行者道：“有赃是实，折辨何为！”刺史道：“正是啊！赃证现存，还敢抵赖？”</p>

<p>叫手下：“拿脑箍来，把这秃贼的光头箍他一箍，然后再打！”行者慌了，心中暗想道：“虽是我师父该有此难，还不可教他十分受苦。”他见那皂隶们收拾索子结脑箍，即便开口道：“大人且莫箍那个和尚。昨夜打劫寇家，点火的也是我，持刀的也是我，劫财的也是我，杀人的也是我。我是个贼头，要打只打我，与他们无干，但只不放我便是。”刺史闻言就教：“先箍起这个来。”</p>

<p>皂隶们齐来上手，把行者套上脑箍，收紧了一勒，扢扑的把索子断了。又结又箍，又扢扑的断了。一连箍了三四次，他的头皮，皱也不曾皱一些儿。却又换索子再结时，只听得有人来报道：“老爷，都下陈少保爷爷到了，请老爷出郭迎接。”那刺史即命刑房吏：“把贼收监，好生看辖，待我接过上司，再行拷问。”</p>

<p>刑房吏遂将唐僧四众，推进监门。八戒、沙僧将自己行李担进随身。</p>

<p>三藏道：“徒弟，这是怎么起的？“行者笑道：“师父，进去进去！这里边没狗叫，倒好耍子！”可怜把四众捉将进去，一个个都推入辖床，扣拽了滚肚、敌脑、攀胸，禁子们又来乱打。三藏苦痛难禁，只叫：“悟空！怎的好！怎的好！”行者道：“他打是要钱哩。常言道好处安身，苦处用钱。如今与他些钱，便罢了。”</p>

<p>三藏道：“我的钱自何来？”行者道：“若没钱，衣物也是，把那袈裟与了他罢。”三藏听说就如刀刺其心，一时间见他打不过，只得开言道：“悟空，随你罢。”行者便叫：“列位长官，不必打了。</p>

<p>我们担进来的那两个包袱中，有一件锦襕袈裟，价值千金。你们解开拿了去罢。”众禁子听言，一齐动手，把两个包袱解看。</p>

<p>虽有几件布衣，虽有个引袋，俱不值钱，只见几层油纸包裹着一物，霞光焰焰，知是好物。抖开看时，但只见：巧妙明珠缀，稀奇佛宝攒。盘龙铺绣结，飞凤锦沿边。众皆争看，又惊动本司狱官，走来喝道：“你们在此嚷甚的？”禁子们跪道：“老爹才子却提控，送下四个和尚，乃是大伙强盗。他见我们打了他几下，把这两个包袱与我。我们打开看时，见有此物，无可处置。若众人扯破分之，其实可惜；若独归一人，众人无利。幸老爹来，凭老爹做个劈着。”狱官见了，乃是一件袈裟，又将别项衣服，并引袋儿通检看了，又打开袋内关文一看，见有各国的宝印花押，道：“早是我来看呀！不然，你们都撞出事来了。这和尚不是强盗，切莫动他衣物，待明日太爷再审，方知端的。”众禁子听言，将包袱还与他，照旧包裹，交与狱官收讫。</p>

<p>渐渐天晚，听得楼头起鼓，火甲巡更。捱至四更三点，行者见他们都不呻吟，尽皆睡着，他暗想道：“师父该有这一夜牢狱之灾，老孙不开口折辨，不使法力者，盖为此耳。如今四更将尽，灾将满矣，我须去打点打点，天明好出牢门。”你看他弄本事，将身小一小，脱出辖床，摇身一变，变做个蜢虫儿，从房檐瓦缝里飞出。见那星光月皎，正是清和夜静之天，他认了方向，径飞向寇家门首，只见那街西下一家儿灯火明亮。又飞近他门口看时，原来是个做豆腐的，见一个老头儿烧火，妈妈儿挤浆。</p>

<p>那老儿忽的叫声：“妈妈，寇大官且是有子有财，只是没寿。我和他小时同学读书，我还大他五岁。他老子叫做寇铭，当时也不上千亩田地，放些租帐，也讨不起。他到二十岁时，那铭老儿死了，他掌着家当，其实也是他一步好运。娶的妻是那张旺之女，小名叫做穿针儿，却倒旺夫。自进他门，种田又收，放帐又起；买着的有利，做着的赚钱，被他如今挣了有十万家私。他到四十岁上，就回心向善，斋了万僧，不期昨夜被强盗踢死。可怜！今年才六十四岁，正好享用，何期这等向善，不得好报，乃死于非命？可叹！可叹！”</p>

<p>行者一一听之，却早五更初点。他就飞入寇家，只见那堂屋里已停着棺材，材头边点着灯，摆列着香烛花果，妈妈在旁啼哭；又见他两个儿子也来拜哭，两个媳妇拿两盏饭儿供献。</p>

<p>行者就钉在他材头上，咳嗽了一声，唬得那两个媳妇查手舞脚的往外跑，寇梁兄弟伏在地下不敢动，只叫：“爹爹！口乐！</p>

<p>口乐！</p>

<p>口乐！”那妈妈子胆大，把材头扑了一把道：“老员外，你活了？”</p>

<p>行者学着那员外的声音道：“我不曾活。”两个儿子一发慌了，不住的叩头垂泪，只叫：“爹爹！口乐！</p>

<p>口乐！</p>

<p>口乐！”妈妈子硬着胆又问道：“员外，你不曾活，如何说话？”行者道：“我是阎王差鬼使押将来家与你们讲话的。”说道：“那张氏穿针儿枉口诳舌，陷害无辜。”那妈妈子听见叫他小名，慌得跪倒磕头道：“好老儿啊！</p>

<p>这等大年纪还叫我的小名儿！我那些枉口诳舌，害甚么无辜？”</p>

<p>行者喝道：“那里有个甚么唐僧点着火，八戒叫杀人，沙僧劫出金银去，行者打死你父亲？只因你诳言，把那好人受难。那唐朝四位老师，路遇强徒，夺将财物，送来谢我，是何等好意！你却假捻失状，着儿子们首官，官府又未细审，又如今把他们监禁，那狱神、土地、城隍俱慌了，坐立不宁，报与阎王。阎王转差鬼使押解我来家，教你们趁早解放他去；不然，教我在家搅闹一月，将合门老幼并鸡狗之类，一个也不存留！”寇梁兄弟又磕头哀告道：“爹爹请回，切莫伤残老幼，待天明就去本府投递解状，愿认招回，只求存殁均安也。”行者听了即叫：“烧纸，我去呀！”他一家儿都来烧纸。</p>

<p>行者一翅飞起，径又飞至刺史住宅里面。低头观看，那房内里已有灯光，见刺史已起来了。他就飞进中堂看时，只见中间后壁挂着一轴画儿，是一个官儿骑着一匹点子马，有几个从人，打着一把青伞，搴着一张交床，更不识是甚么故事，行者就钉在中间。忽然那刺史自房里出来，湾着腰梳洗。行者猛的里咳嗽一声，把刺史唬得慌慌张张，走入房内梳洗毕，穿了大衣，即出来对着画儿焚香祷告道：“伯考姜公乾一神位，孝侄姜坤三蒙祖上德荫，忝中甲科，今叨受铜台府刺史，旦夕侍奉香火不绝，为何今日发声？切勿为邪为祟，恐唬家众。”行者暗笑道：</p>

<p>“此是他大爷的神子！”却就绰着经儿叫道：“坤三贤侄，你做官虽承祖荫，一向清廉，怎的昨日无知，把四个圣僧当贼，不审来因，囚于禁内！那狱神、土地、城隍不安，报与阎君，阎君差鬼使押我来对你说，教你推情察理，快快解放他；不然，就教你去阴司折证也。”刺史听说，心中悚惧道：“大爷请回，小侄升堂，当就释放。”行者道：“既如此，烧纸来，我去见阎君回话。”刺史复添香烧纸拜谢。</p>

<p>行者又飞出来看时，东方早已发白。及飞到地灵县，又见那合县官却都在堂上，他思道：“蜢虫儿说话，被人看见，露出马脚来不好。”他就半空中，改了个大法身，从空里伸下一只脚来，把个县堂躧满，口中叫道：“众官听着：吾乃玉帝差来的浪荡游神。说你这府监里屈打了取经的佛子，惊动三界诸神不安，教吾传说，趁早放他；若有差池，教我再来一脚，先踢死合府县官，后躧死四境居民，把城池都踏为灰烬！”概县官吏人等，慌得一齐跪倒，磕头礼拜道：“上圣请回。我们如今进府，禀上府尊，即教放出，千万莫动脚，惊唬死下官。”行者才收了法身，仍变做个蜢虫儿，从监房瓦缝儿飞入，依旧钻在辖床中间睡着。</p>

<p>却说那刺史升堂，才抬出投文牌去，早有寇梁兄弟抱牌跪门叫喊。刺史着令进来，二人将解状递上。刺史见了发怒道：</p>

<p>“你昨日递了失状，就与你拿了贼来，你又领了赃去，怎么今日又来递解状？”二人滴泪道：“老爷，今夜小的父亲显魂道：‘唐朝圣僧，原将贼徒拿住，夺获财物，放了贼去，好意将财物送还我家报恩，怎么反将他当贼，拿在狱中受苦！狱中土地城隍俱不安，报了阎王，阎王差鬼使押解我来教你赴府再告，释放唐僧，庶免灾咎，不然，老幼皆亡。’因此，特来递个解词，望老爷方便！方便！”刺史听他说了这话，却暗想道：“他那父亲，乃是热尸新鬼，显魂报应犹可；我伯父死去五六年了，却怎么今夜也来显魂，教我审放？看起来必是冤枉。”正忖度间，只见那地灵县知县等官，急急跑上堂乱道：“老大人，不好了！不好了！适才玉帝差浪荡游神下界，教你快放狱中好人。昨日拿的那些和尚，不是强盗，都是取经的佛子。若少迟延，就要踢杀我等官员，还要把城池连百姓俱尽踏为灰烬。”刺史又大惊失色，即叫刑房吏火速写牌提出。当时开了监门提出，八戒愁道：“今日又不知怎的打哩。行者笑道：“管你一下儿也不敢打，老孙俱已干办停当。上堂切不可下跪，他还要下来请我们上坐，却等我问他要行李，要马匹。少了一些儿，等我打他你看。”说不了，已至堂口，那刺史、知县并府县大小官员，一见都下来迎接道：“圣僧昨日来时，一则接上司忙迫，二则又见了所获之赃，未及细问端的。”唐僧合掌躬身，又将前情细陈了一遍。众官满口认称，都道：“错了错了！莫怪莫怪！”又问狱中可曾有甚疏失，行者近前努目睁看，厉声高叫道：“我的白马是堂上人得了，行李是狱中人得了，快快还我！今日却该我拷较你们了！枉拿平人做贼，你们该个甚罪？”府县官见他作恶，无一个不怕，即便叫收马的牵马来，收行李的取行李来，一一交付明白。你看他三人一个个逞凶，众官只以寇家遮饰。三藏劝解了道：“徒弟，是也不得明白。我们且到寇家去，一则吊问，二来与他对证对证，看是何人见我做贼。”行者道：“说得是，等老孙把那死的叫起来，看是那个打他。”沙僧就在府堂上把唐僧撮上马，吆吆喝喝，一拥而出。那些府县多官，也一一俱到寇家，唬得那寇梁兄弟在门前不住的磕头，接进厅。只见他孝堂之中，一家儿都在孝幔里啼哭，行者叫道：“那打诳语栽害平人的妈妈子，且莫哭！等老孙叫你老公来，看他说是那个打死的，羞他一羞！”众官员只道孙行者说的是笑话。行者道：“列位大人，略陪我师父坐坐。八戒、沙僧好生保护，等我去了就来。”好大圣，跳出门，望空就起，只见那遍地彩霞笼住宅，一天瑞气护元神。众等方才认得是个腾云驾雾之仙，起死回生之圣，这里一一焚香礼拜不题。</p>

<p>那大圣一路筋斗云，直至幽冥地界，径撞入森罗殿上，慌得那十代阎君拱手接，五方鬼判叩头迎。千株剑树皆敧侧，万迭刀山尽坦平。枉死城中魑魅化，奈河桥下鬼超生。正是那神光一照如天赦，黑暗阴司处处明。十阎王接下大圣，相见了问及何来何干。行者道：“铜台府地灵县斋僧的寇洪之鬼，是那个收了？快点查来与我。”十阎王道：“寇洪善士，也不曾有鬼使勾他，他自家到此，遇着地藏王的金衣童子，他引见地藏也。”行者即别了，径至翠云宫，见地藏王菩萨。菩萨与他礼毕，具言前事，菩萨喜道：“寇洪阳寿，止该卦数，命终不染床席，弃世而来。我因他斋僧，是个善士，收他做个掌善缘簿子的案长。既大圣来取，我再延他阳寿一纪，教他跟大圣去。金衣童子遂领出寇洪，寇洪见了行者，声声叫道：“老师！老师！救我一救！”</p>

<p>行者道：“你被强盗踢死。此乃阴司地藏王菩萨之处，我老孙特来取你到阳世间，对明此事，既蒙菩萨放回，又延你阳寿一纪，待十二年之后，你再来也。”那员外顶礼不尽。行者谢辞了菩萨，将他吹化为气，掉于衣袖之间，同去幽府，复返阳间。驾云头到了寇家，即唤八戒捎开材盖，把他魂灵儿推付本身。须臾间，透出气来活了，那员外爬出材来，对唐僧四众磕头道：“师父！师父！寇洪死于非命，蒙师父至阴司救活，乃再造之恩！”</p>

<p>言谢不已。及回头见各官罗列，即又磕头道：“列位老爹都如何在舍？”那刺史道：“你儿子始初递失状，坐名告了圣僧，我即差人捕获；不期圣僧路遇杀劫你家之贼，夺取财物，送还你家。是我下人误捉，未得详审，当送监禁。今夜被你显魂，我先伯亦来家诉告，县中又蒙浪荡游神下界，一时就有这许多显应，所以放出圣僧，圣僧却又去救活你也。”那员外跪道：“老爹，其实枉了这四位圣僧！那夜有三十多名强盗，明火执杖，劫去家私，是我难舍，向贼理说，不期被他一脚撩阴踢死，与这四位何干！”</p>

<p>叫过妻子来，“是谁人踢死，你等辄敢妄告？请老爹定罪。”当时一家老小只是磕头，刺史宽恩，免其罪过。寇洪教安排筵宴，酬谢府县厚恩，个个未坐回衙。至次日，再挂斋僧牌，又款留三藏，三藏决不肯住。却又请亲友，办旌幢，如前送行而去。咦！</p>

<p>这正是：地辟能存凶恶事，天高不负善心人。逍遥稳步如来径，只到灵山极乐门，毕竟不知见佛何如，且听下回分解。</p>
