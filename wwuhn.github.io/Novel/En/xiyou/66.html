<div class="title">
<P>A Demon Creates a False Thunder Peak</P>
<P>All Four Pilgrims Meet with Disaster</P>
</div>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The cause and effect this time revealed</P>
<P>Should make one do what's good and shun the evil.</P>
<P>Once a thought is born</P>
<P>The Intelligence is aware of it.</P>
<P>And lets it become action.</P>
<P>Why strive to learn stupidity or skill?</P>
<P>Both are medicines for heartlessness.</P>
<P>Do what is right while you are still alive;</P>
<P>Do not just drift.</P>
<P>Recognize the root and the source,</P>
<P>Escape from the trunk and the husk.</P>
<P>If seeking long life you must grasp this.</P>
<P>Watch clearly at every moment,</P>
<P>Refine your thoughts.</P>
<P>Go through the three passes, fill up the black sea;</P>
<P>The good will surely ride on the phoenix and crane.</P>
<P>Then your gloom will change to compassion</P>
<P>As you ascend to absolute bliss.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Tang Sanzang's thoughts were so pure that not only did the heavenly gods protect him: even the vegetable spirits had taken him along a part of his journey for a night of elegant conversation, thereby saving him from having to go through the thorns and brambles. Nor were there any more creepers to entangle them. As the four of them carried on West for another long period winter ended and spring returned.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>All things begin to flower,</P>
<P>The handle of the Dipper returns to the East.</P>
<P>Everywhere the grass is green,</P>
<P>As are the leaves of willows on the bank.</P>
<P>The ridge covered in peach blossom is red brocade;</P>
<P>The mist over the stream is a translucent gauze.</P>
<P>Frequent wind and rain,</P>
<P>Unbounded feeling.</P>
<P>Flowers open their hearts to the sun,</P>
<P>Swallows carry off the delicate moss.</P>
<P>Wang Wei should have painted the beauty of the mountains;</P>
<P>The birdsong is as persuasive as Su Qin's golden tongue.</P>
<P>Though no one sees these fragrant cushions of flowers</P>
<P>The butterflies and singing bees adore them.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Master and disciples made their way across the flowers and the grass ambling along with the horse until they made out in the distance a mountain so high that it touched the sky. Pointing at it with his riding crop Sanzang said, &#8220;I wonder how high that mountain is, Wukong. It touches the heavens and pierces the firmament.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Isn't there some ancient poem that says, 'Heaven alone is supreme: no mountain can equal its height?'&#8220; Monkey replied. &#8220;However high a mountain is it can't possibly join up with the sky.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Then why's Mount Kunlun called the pillar of heaven?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Evidently you don't know that part of the sky has always been missing in the Northwest,&#8221; Brother Monkey replied. &#8220;As Kunlun's in the Northwest corner it plugs that hole in the sky. That's why it's called the pillar of heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand with a smile, &#8220;stop telling him all that. He'll brag about it to make himself superior. We'll know how high the mountain is when we've climbed it.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot started chasing Friar Sand and brawling with him in a playful way, and the master's horse galloped as if on wings. They were soon at the foot of a precipice up which they made their way painfully slowly. This is what the mountain was like:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The wind rustling in the woods,</P>
<P>Water gushing along the beds of ravines.</P>
<P>Crows and sparrows cannot fly across it;</P>
<P>Even gods and immortals find it hard.</P>
<P>Scars and gullies endlessly twisting;</P>
<P>Clouds of dust blowing where no one can go;</P>
<P>Rocks in strange and fascinating shapes.</P>
<P>Clouds like vast expanses of water,</P>
<P>While elsewhere birds sing in the trees.</P>
<P>Deer carry magic fungus in their mouths.</P>
<P>Apes pick peaches.</P>
<P>Foxes and raccoon dogs spring around on the cliffs,</P>
<P>Large and small deer play on the ridge.</P>
<P>Then comes the spine-chilling roar of a tiger,</P>
<P>And the way is blocked by leopards and wolves.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sanzang was terrified by what he saw, but Monkey's powers were enormous. With his gold-banded cudgel and a mighty roar he sent the wolves, tigers, leopards and other wild beasts running then cleared the way for the master to reach the top of the mountain. Once they were over the summit ridge and had started going down the gentle Western slope they saw divine light and coloured clouds over some imposing buildings from which came the muffled sounds of bells and stone chimes.</P>
<P>&#8220;Look and see what that place is, disciples,&#8221; said Sanzang. Monkey raised his head, shaded his eyes with his hands, and on careful examination saw that it was a fine place:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Magnificent architecture,</P>
<P>A famous monastery.</P>
<P>The valley of emptiness is full of the earth's vibrations;</P>
<P>Heavenly fragrance pervades the stillness.</P>
<P>Rain in the bluish pines obscures the buildings;</P>
<P>Mist around the green bamboo protects the preaching hall.</P>
<P>Through coloured clouds one can make out the dragon palace;</P>
<P>The infinite worlds are seen in shimmering light.</P>
<P>Red balustrades and doors of marble,</P>
<P>Painted and carved beams.</P>
<P>Incense fills the hall in which the scriptures are taught;</P>
<P>The moon hangs over the window where the mysteries are passed on.</P>
<P>Birds sing in red trees,</P>
<P>Cranes drink from a spring in the rocks.</P>
<P>The flowers as fine as those of the Jetavana;</P>
<P>All the doors open on the brilliance of Sravasti.</P>
<P>Beside the towering buildings the gates face crags;</P>
<P>Slow is the rhythm of the bell and chime.</P>
<P>A light breeze blows into open windows,</P>
<P>And under the rolled-up curtains is a smoky haze.</P>
<P>Among the monks emotions are all calm;</P>
<P>Peace reigns in the absence of worldliness.</P>
<P>A land of immortals unsullied by earth's dust,</P>
<P>This splendid monastery of the pure land.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When he had taken a good look at it Monkey went back to report, &#8220;It's a monastery, Master, but for some reason there's something evil about the auspicious dhyana atmosphere. The place looks like the Thunder Monastery but the distance to here is wrong. Whatever we do we mustn't go rushing inside. If we do we may run into something nasty.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But if it looks like the Thunder Monastery this must surely be the Vulture Peak,&#8221; said the Tang Priest. &#8220;Don't try to frustrate my sincerest wish and put off what I've come for.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But it isn't vulture peak,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I've been there several times and this isn't the way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Even if it isn't there must be good people living here,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be so suspicious,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;The road goes straight past the gate, so we can find out at a glance,&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>Whipping on the horse, the venerable elder arrived at the monastery gate, above which the words THUNDER MONASTERY were written.</P>
<P>This came as such a surprise to him that he fell to the ground from the horse, saying abusively, &#8220;Wretched macaque! You'll be the death of me. Here we are at the Thunder Monastery and you're still trying to trick me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be angry, Master,&#8221; said Monkey with a forced smile. &#8220;Take another look. There are three words over the gate. Why did you only read two of them out, then get angry with me?&#8221; Still shaking, the master climbed to his feet again for another look and saw that there were in fact three words written there: LESSER THUNDER MONASTERY.</P>
<P>&#8220;Even if it is the Lesser Thunder Monastery,&#8221; Sanzang said, &#8220;there must be a Buddha in here. The three thousand Buddhas of whom the scriptures speak can't all live in the same place, just as the Bodhisattva Guanyin lives in the Southern Sea, Samantabhadra lives on Mount Emei and Manjusri on Mount Wutai. I wonder which Buddha's holy seat this is. As the saying has it,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Wherever there's a Buddha there are scriptures;</P>
<P>Everywhere you go you'll find some treasures.</P>
<P>Let's go in.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;No, we mustn't,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;This place looks thoroughly sinister. Don't blame me if this leads to disaster.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Even if there is not Buddha here there's bound to be a statue of a Buddha, and I am under a vow to worship every Buddha statue I pass,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;I won't blame you.&#8221; He then told Pig to get out his cassock, put on his mitre, neatened his clothes up and strode forward.</P>
<P>As he did so a voice from inside the gate called out, &#8220;Tang Priest, you've come from the East to worship our Buddha, so why are you still being so casual about it?&#8221; Sanzang at once started kowtowing, as did Pig while Friar Sand knelt. The Great Sage hung back, holding the horse and looking after the luggage. Once they were inside the inner gates they reached the Buddha Hall, outside of which were drawn up the five hundred arhats, the three thousand protectors, the four vajrapanis, the eight Bodhisattvas, nuns, lay people, and countless holy monks and lay brothers. Everywhere was the scent of flowers and auspicious vapors. The venerable elder, Pig and Friar Sand were all so overwhelmed that they kowtowed at every step until they reached the hall. Monkey alone did not bow.</P>
<P>&#8220;Sun Wukong,&#8221; came a shrill shout from the throne, &#8220;why don't you kowtow when you see the Buddha?&#8221; Nobody realized that Monkey had spotted as he took a careful look around that this was all false.</P>
<P>Letting go of the horse and putting down the luggage he shouted as he brandished his cudgel, &#8220;Evil beasts! What a nerve! How dare you try to ruin the Buddha's good name by pretending to be him! Stay where you are!&#8221; He raised his cudgel in both hands and was just about to strike when a pair of bronze cymbals came out of the sky to join together with a mighty crash, enclosing him completely from head to toe. Pig and Friar Sand grabbed desperately for their rake and staff, only to be so closely surrounded by the arhats, protectors, holy monks and lay brothers that they could not move. They and Sanzang too were all captured and roped up tightly.</P>
<P>Now the Buddha on the lotus throne was a demon king and all the arhats and others his little devils. They now put off their Buddha disguises, so that they looked once more like the evil creatures they really were, and carried the three of them round to the back to be kept under guard while Monkey was sealed inside the cymbals, never to be released. The cymbals were then set on a pedestal, and here he was to be turned to pus and blood within three days and nights, after which the other three were to be steamed in an iron steamer and eaten. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The green-eyed macaque saw that it was false;</P>
<P>The dhyana monk worshipped the appearance of the Buddha.</P>
<P>The yellow-wife blindly joined in the prostration,</P>
<P>While the mother of wood foolishly agreed.</P>
<P>The monsters used force to oppress the true nature;</P>
<P>Evilly the demon king mistreated the holy man.</P>
<P>The demon king was greater than the narrow Way;</P>
<P>By taking the wrong course they threw away their lives.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Having locked the Tang Priest and his two disciples away and tied the horse up at the back they put Sanzang's cassock and mitre back into the luggage and stored that away too. They then put everything under a close guard.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Inside the cymbals Monkey found it pitch black and so hot that he was soon pouring with sweat. Push and shove though he might, there was no way he could get out, and when in desperation he hit out wildly all around with his iron cudgel he could not move the cymbals by even a fraction of an inch. Then he made a hand-spell that made him ten thousand feet tall; the cymbals grew with him. There was not a crack anywhere through which a chink of light could get in. He made another hand-spell to make himself smaller and shrank till he was as tiny as a mustard-seed. The cymbals shrank with him, and still there was no hole.</P>
<P>He blew a magic breath on the iron cudgel, said, &#8220;Change!&#8221; and made it into a flagpole with which to prop the cymbals up. Then he pulled two of the longer hairs from the back of his head, blew on them, said, &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned them into a five-part drill with a plum-blossom shaped bit which he turned a thousand times or more. There was a rasping noise but the drill made no impression.</P>
<P>By now he was feeling desperate, so he made another handspell and recited the words,<I> &#8220;Om ram</I> peaceful dharma world; eternal keen purity of the heavenly unity.&#8221;</P>
<P>This compelled the Five Protectors, the Six Dings, the Six Jias and the Eighteen Guardians of the Faith to gather round the cymbals and say, &#8220;Great Sage, we are all protecting your master and keeping the demons from harming him, so why do you call us here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If he dies it serves him right for ignoring my advice,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;You lot had better find some magic to get these cymbals open at once and have me out of here so I can decide what to do. It's completely dark in here, I'm feeling very hot, and it's so stuffy it'll kill me.&#8221; The gods all tried to lift the cymbals, but as before it was impossible to move them by even a fraction of an inch.</P>
<P>&#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; said the Gold-headed Protector, &#8220;goodness only knows what kind of treasure this is, but they're all of a piece from top to bottom. We gods aren't strong enough to move them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;And I've lost count of the number of my magic powers I've used here without being able to move them either,&#8221; said Monkey. When the Protector heard this he told the Six Dings to look after Monkey and the Six Jias to watch over the cymbals while the guardians kept their eyes on what was happening all around.</P>
<P>He then set off on his beam of auspicious light and a moment later shot in through the Southern Gate of Heaven, where he did not wait to be summoned but rushed straight to the steps of the Hall of Miraculous Brightness to prostrate himself before the Jade Emperor and report, &#8220;My sovereign, I am one of the Protectors of the Four Quarters and the Centre. The Great Sage Equaling Heaven who is escorting the Tang Priest on the journey to fetch the scriptures has now reached a mountain with a monastery called the Lesser Thunder Monastery on it. The Tang Priest went in to worship under the illusion that he had reached Vulture Peak, but it turned out that the whole thing was a decoy to trap them. The Great Sage is caught inside a pair of cymbals and can't go anywhere. He's gradually dying. That is what I have come to report.&#8221; At once the Jade Emperor ordered that the Twenty-eight Constellations be sent to rescue them and defeat the demons.</P>
<P>Not daring to delay for a moment, the constellations went out through the gate of Heaven with the Protector and were soon inside the monastery. It was now the second of the night's five watches, and all the demons, senior and junior, had gone to sleep after the feast their king had given them to celebrate the Tang priest's capture. Doing nothing to disturb them, the constellations went to the cymbals and reported, &#8220;Great Sage, we're the Twenty-eight Constellations. The Jade Emperor has sent us here to rescue you.&#8221; The news made Monkey very happy. &#8220;Smash them open with your weapons and get me out of here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We don't dare to,&#8221; the constellations replied. &#8220;This is pure gold and if we hit it the noise would wake the devils up and it would be impossible to rescue you. We'll have to try to work it open with our weapons. The moment you see a chink of light in there, out you come.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Monkey. They used their spears, swords, sabers and battle-axes to try to lever, prise, lift, and force it open, but despite all their efforts the third watch came and still they had failed to make the slightest impression on them. It was as if the cymbals had been cast as a single whole. Not a chink of light could Monkey see from inside, no matter how hard he looked and crawled and rolled all around.</P>
<P>Then the Metal Dragon of the constellation Gullet said, &#8220;Don't get impatient, Great Sage. This must be an As-You-Will treasure and I'm sure it can be changed. You feel where the cymbals join from the inside. Once I get my horn between them you can turn yourself into something and get out where I've loosened them.&#8221; Monkey followed this suggestion and felt frantically around inside. Meanwhile the constellation made himself so small that his horn was no bigger than the point of a needle. He pushed hard with it where the two cymbals joined, and by exerting tremendous pressure he managed to penetrate inside.</P>
<P>He then gave himself a magic body by saying, &#8220;Grow! Grow! Grow!&#8221; The horn became as thick as a rice-bowl, but the cymbals were more like creatures of skin and flesh than objects cast from metal: they kept their close bite on the Metal Dragon of Gullet's horn, and not a crack appeared anywhere around.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's no use,&#8221; said Monkey, feeling the constellation's horn, &#8220;it's not at all loose anywhere around it. There's nothing for it: you'll have to bear the pain and pull me out.&#8221; The splendid Great Sage then changed his gold-banded cudgel into a steel gimlet, bored a hole in the tip of the horn, made himself the size of a mustard seed, crawled into the hole, squatted there, and shouted, &#8220;Pull it out.&#8221; Only through stupendous efforts did the constellation manage to pull his horn out, which left him so weak and exhausted that he collapsed.</P>
<P>Monkey then crawled out of the hole in the horn again, resumed his own appearance, raised his cudgel and smashed the cymbals apart with a tremendous noise like a copper mountain collapsing. The Buddhist instruments now lay shattered into thousands of fragments of gold. This gave the Twenty-eight Constellations a terrible fright and made the Protectors' hair stand on end. All the devils woke up, and as the demon king was shocked out of his sleep he jumped up, pulled on his clothes and had the drums beaten to muster all the demons with their weapons. By now it was nearly dawn and they all gathered round the throne. On seeing Monkey and the constellations standing in a ring round the fragments of the golden cymbals the demon king went pale from shock and ordered his underlings to shut the front gates and not let them escape.</P>
<P>As soon as Monkey heard this he led the Twenty-eight Constellations to spring up on their clouds till they were above the ninth heaven, while the demon king had the fragments of gold tidied away and drew his devilish forces up outside the monastery gates.</P>
<P>In his anger the king had no choice but to put on his armor, take his short and flexible wolf's-tooth spiked mace and come out of his camp shouting, &#8220;Sun the Novice! A real man doesn't run away from a fight. Come back and fight three rounds with me.&#8221; This was more than Monkey could stand, and he landed his cloud at the head of his starry host to see what the evil spirit looked like.</P>
<P>This is what he saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Matted hair</P>
<P>Held in place by a thin gold band;</P>
<P>Eyes flashing</P>
<P>Under a pair of frowning yellow brows;</P>
<P>A pear-shaped nose</P>
<P>With flaring nostrils;</P>
<P>A square-cut mouth</P>
<P>With sharp-pointed teeth.</P>
<P>He wore a coat of chain-mail</P>
<P>Tied with a tasseled raw silk sash;</P>
<P>On his feet were a pair of oxhide boots</P>
<P>And he carried a wolf's-tooth mace.</P>
<P>He looked both like a wild beast and at the same time not;</P>
<P>His face was human and yet not human.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;What kind of monster do you think you are?&#8221; shouted Monkey as he brandished his cudgel. &#8220;How can you have the effrontery to pose as a Buddha, occupy a mountain and create a false Lesser Thunder Monastery?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The only reason you've got the nerve to come rampaging around my magic mountain must be that you don't know my name,&#8221; the monster said. &#8220;This is the Lesser Western Heaven, and Heaven has given me these fine buildings because I have cultivated my conduct and gained the true achievement. I am called the Yellow-browed Buddha, though in their ignorance the people around here call me King Yellow Brow or Lord Yellow Brow. I've known about your journey to the West for a very long time now and I have some magic powers, which was why I could create those illusions to lure your master in so that you and I could have a trial of strength. If you can beat me I'll spare your master and his disciples and allow you to fulfil your true achievement. But if you can't I'll kill the lot of you and go myself to see the Tathagata Buddha, fetch the scriptures and take them to China.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You talk too much, evil spirit,&#8221; said Monkey with a laugh. &#8220;If you want a trial of strength try this from my cudgel.&#8221; With great pleasure the demon king parried it and a fine fight ensued:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A pair of cudgels,</P>
<P>Each quite different.</P>
<P>To start with what they looked like,</P>
<P>One was a short and flexible Buddha weapon,</P>
<P>The other was hard from the stores of the sea.</P>
<P>Both of them could be changed at will,</P>
<P>And today they met in a struggle for mastery.</P>
<P>The soft wolf's-tooth mace was adorned with brocade,</P>
<P>The hard gold-banded cudgel had dragon patterns.</P>
<P>They could both be admirably big or small,</P>
<P>Any length you liked and always just right.</P>
<P>Monkey and monster were evenly matched:</P>
<P>This fight between them was the real thing.</P>
<P>The monkey tamed by faith was now the mind-ape;</P>
<P>The evil monster had offended Heaven with deception.</P>
<P>In his anger and loathing neither showed mercy;</P>
<P>Both had their ways of being savagely vicious.</P>
<P>One struck to the head, never easing the pressure;</P>
<P>The other hit at the face and could not be fought off.</P>
<P>The sun went dark behind the clouds they made;</P>
<P>They breathed out mists that hid the towering crags.</P>
<P>Cudgel met cudgel as the rivals fought,</P>
<P>Both forgetting life and death for the Tang priest's sake.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The two of them fought fifty rounds without either emerging as victor. By the monastery gate there was much beating of drums and gongs as the evil spirits shouted their war-cries and waved their flags. Facing them were the heavenly soldiers of the Twenty-eight Constellations and the holy hosts of the Five Protectors, who were all armed and shouting as they surrounded the demon king. The demons outside the monastery gate were too frightened to beat their drums, and their hands were shaking so badly that they could not strike their gongs.</P>
<P>The old demon king was not at all afraid. He held all the enemy troops at bay with his mace in one hand while with the other he undid an old white cotton pouch that was round his waist as a sash; this he threw into the air. With a loud swish it caught the Great Sage Monkey, the Twenty-eight Constellations and the Protectors of the Four Quarters and the Centre; he then slung them over his shoulder and carried them back inside. All the little demons returned in triumph. The demon king told his underlings to fetch forty or fifty hempen ropes, opened the bag, and took his prisoners out one at a time to be tied up, Each of them felt that his bones had turned soft. Their muscles were numb and their skin hung loosely on them. Once tied up they were all carried out to the back and flung on the ground indiscriminately. The demon king then ordered a banquet and the devils drank from dawn till dusk before it broke up and they all went off to sleep.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In the middle of the night, as the Great Sage Monkey lay there tied up with all the gods, he heard the sound of weeping. Listening more carefully he recognized the voice of Sanzang, who was saying as he sobbed, &#8220;Wukong,&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;I wish I had heeded the warning you gave:</P>
<P>From this disaster we could have steered clear.</P>
<P>While you're being tortured in cymbals of gold,</P>
<P>Nobody knows I'm a prisoner here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Bitter the fate that afflicts us all four;</P>
<P>All our achievements have now come to naught.</P>
<P>How can we be saved from this awful impasse</P>
<P>To go to the West and then home as we ought?&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he felt sorry for his master. &#8220;Although ignoring my advice was what caused this disaster,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;at least you're remembering me in your troubles. I'd better save them all and let them get away while it's night, the demons are all asleep and nobody's on guard.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage used escaping magic to make himself so small that he slipped out of his bonds, went up to the Tang Priest and said, &#8220;Master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why are you here?&#8221; Sanzang asked, recognizing his voice. Monkey told him very quietly what had happened, to his great delight.</P>
<P>&#8220;Please rescue me as soon as you can,&#8221; Sanzang said. &#8220;From now on I'll do whatever you say and not be so stubborn.&#8221;</P>
<P>Only then did Monkey start moving, first releasing the master, Pig and Friar Sand, then the Twenty-eight Constellations; and the Protectors of the Four Quarters and the Centre, all of whom he untied one by one. Next he brought the horse over and told his master to carry on ahead as quickly as possible. Once they were outside Monkey realized that he did not know where the luggage was and went back to look for it.</P>
<P>&#8220;You seem to think that things matter more than people,&#8221; said the Metal Dragon of Gullet. &#8220;It ought to be enough that we've rescued your master. Why do you want to look for the luggage?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Of course people are important,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;but things are even more important. In the luggage there's our passport, the brocade cassock and the golden begging bowl. They're all great treasures of the Buddhist faith, and we must have them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You go back and look for them, brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;while we start out. We'll wait for you later.&#8221; Watch how the stars crowd round the Tang Priest and all use their magic powers at once to take him out of the enclosure with a breath of wind as they hurry along the main road down the slope till they reach level ground and rest.</P>
<P>At about the third watch the Great Sage Monkey crept slowly and stealthily back inside to find gate inside gate all very tightly closed. When he climbed up to the upper story of a building to take a look he saw that the windows were all fastened too. He was on the point of going down again but dared not move for fear of the window-frames making a noise. He therefore made a hand-spell, shook himself and turned into a mouse immortal, or what is more commonly known as a bat. Do you know what he looked like?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>His head was pointed like a rat's,</P>
<P>His eyes like a rat's did spark.</P>
<P>He emerged at twilight on his wings,</P>
<P>To sleep by day in the dark.</P>
<P>He hid away among the tiles;</P>
<P>The mosquitoes he caught were his food.</P>
<P>Bright moonlit nights he liked the best;</P>
<P>At flying he really was good.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He found his way in under the rafters through an open-ended tile then flew over doors till he got to the middle of the building. Here he noticed a faintly glimmering beam of light coming from under a second-floor window. It was not like the light of a lantern or candle, the glow of burning incense, a beam of evening sunlight or a flash of lightning. He went closer to the window, his heart in his mouth with excitement, and looked inside to see that the glow was coming from the luggage. The evil spirit had taken the cassock off the Tang Priest, but instead of folding it up he had thrust it untidily back into the bundles. The reason why the cassock glowed was because it was a Buddha treasure itself, with As-You-Will pearls, mani pearls, red cornelian, purple coral, sarira Buddha-relics and night-shining pearls on it. He was very pleased when he saw these things and turned back into himself to pick them up, put the carrying pole on his shoulder, and take them downstairs without stopping to adjust the ropes to balance the loads.</P>
<P>Unfortunately the load at one end slipped off and landed with a loud crash on the floorboards. Alas!</P>
<P>This noise woke up the old demon king sleeping downstairs, and he leapt out of bed with a cry of &#8220;Intruders! Intruders!&#8221; At this all the big and little demons got up too, lit lamps, and started searching all around, all shouting loudly the while, &#8220;The Tang Priest's escaped!&#8221; someone came in to report, to be followed by another saying, &#8220;Sun the Novice and all the rest of them have got away.&#8221; The old demon then ordered strict security on all the gates. As soon as Monkey heard this he abandoned the luggage, somersaulted out through the windows and fled before they could catch him.</P>
<P>No matter how hard they looked, the evil spirits could not find the Tang Priest and the rest of them. By now the day was beginning to dawn, so the demon king seized his mace and led his hosts in hot pursuit. They found the camp of the Twenty-eight Constellations and the Five Protectors surrounded by mists and cloud at the foot of the mountain. &#8220;Where do you think you're going?&#8221; the demon king shouted. &#8220;I'm here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brothers,&#8221; called the Wooden Lesser Dragon of the Constellation Horn in alarm, &#8220;the monsters are here.&#8221; The Metal Dragon of the Gullet, the Earth Bat of the Woman, the Sun Hare of the Chamber, the Moon Fox of the Heart, the Fire Tiger of the Tail, the Water Leopard of the Winnower, the Wooden Unicorn of the Dipper, the Metal Bull of the Ox, the Earth Raccoon-dog of the Base, the Sun Rat of the Barrens, the Moon Swallow of the Roof, the Fire Pig of the House, the Water Beast of the Wall, the Wooden Wolf of the Strider, the Metal Dog of the Harvester, the Earth Boar of the Stomach, the Sun Cock of the Pleiades, the Moon Crow of the Net, the Fire Monkey of the Turtle, the Water Ape of Orion, the Wooden Hyena of the Well, the Metal Goat of the Ghosts, the Earth River Deer of the Willow, the Sun Horse of the Seven Stars, the Moon Deer of the Spread Net, the Fire Snake-of the Wing, and the Water Worm of the Axletree, at the head of the Golden-headed Protector, the Silver-headed Protector, the Six Dings, the Six Jias, the Guardians of the Faith, Pig and Friar Sand&#8212;they did not take the Tang Priest or the white dragon horse&#8212;all rushed forward with their weapons. At the sight of them the demon king laughed a contemptuous laugh, whistled, and called up four or five thousand evil spirits, each of whom was powerful and strong. A bitter fight then followed on the Western slopes of the mountain, and a fine battle it was too:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The evil demon king had tricked the true nature:</P>
<P>The gentle true nature was no match for him.</P>
<P>With so many plots it was hard to escape from pain;</P>
<P>When so much cunning was used there could be no peace.</P>
<P>All the heavens offered their protection,</P>
<P>And hosts of sages helped to wage the fight.</P>
<P>The mother of wood suffers for showing mercy.</P>
<P>Determination moves the yellow-wife.</P>
<P>The bitter fight shook heaven and earth;</P>
<P>Both sides spread their nets in the struggle.</P>
<P>On one side the waving of banners and warcries,</P>
<P>On the other the beating of drums and gongs.</P>
<P>A cold sea of light from massed sabers and spears,</P>
<P>And a murderous look of the swords and the halberds.</P>
<P>The demon troops were cruel and tough;</P>
<P>The heavenly soldiers were no match for them.</P>
<P>Dreary clouds blocked out the sun and moon;</P>
<P>Spine-chilling mists lay over the landscape.</P>
<P>Hard and bitter was the fight,</P>
<P>And all because Sanzang wanted to visit the Buddha.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The evil spirit now felt more ferocious than ever as he led his hosts into the attack. Just when the issue was hanging in the balance there could be heard an angry roar from Monkey of, &#8220;I'm here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What about the luggage!&#8221; Pig asked as he greeted him.</P>
<P>&#8220;I barely got away with my life,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;so what are you asking about the luggage for?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop talking, you two,&#8221; said Friar Sand, who was wielding his staff. &#8220;Hurry up and fight the evil spirits.&#8221; The Constellations, Protectors, Dings, Jias and all the other gods had been surrounded and bunched together by the demons in the wild melee, while the demon king attacked the three of them with his mace. Monkey, Pig and Friar Sand held the enemy off by striking and swinging with their cudgel, staff and rake. The earth and sky were now plunged into darkness, and still there was no victor. They fought on till the sun set in the Western hills and the moon rose over the Eastern islands.</P>
<P>Seeing how late it now was, the demon whistled and told all the fiends to be specially careful while he produced his treasure once more. Monkey could see clearly as he undid the pouch and took it in his hands.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is bad,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Let's get out of here.&#8221; And with that he somersaulted straight up to the ninth heaven, not concerning himself with Pig, Friar Sand and the heavenly hosts, who failed to take his hint and were left behind to be caught in the bag again. Monkey alone escaped. The demon king then called off his forces and took them back inside the monastery, where once more he sent for ropes and tied them up again. The<I></I> Tang Priest, Pig and Friar Sand were hung up from a high beam and the white horse was tethered at the back. The gods, who were also bound, were carried down into a cellar that was then covered and sealed. We will not go into how the devils then packed everything away once more.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Monkey saved his life by springing up into the clouds and saw the devil soldiers returning, not waving their banners, he knew that his side must have been made prisoner once more. As he landed his auspicious light on the Eastern summit</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He ground his teeth in hatred of the demon;</P>
<P>The tears flowed free as Monkey missed his master.</P>
<P>Then in despair he turned his face to heaven</P>
<P>And groaned aloud at Sanzang's new disaster.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; he called, &#8220;in whatever past world did you lay down so many difficulties for yourself that you meet evil spirits at every turn? There's no end to your troubles. What are we to do?&#8221; He sighed alone up there for a long time before calming himself down and working out what to do.</P>
<P>&#8220;I wonder what sort of pouch it is the devil has that can hold so many things inside!&#8221; he thought. &#8220;Now it's got the gods, the heavenly generals and a lot of other people too. I'll have to ask Heaven to help me, but I fear the Jade Emperor will be angry about what has happened. Now I remember there's a True Martial God of the North, the Heavenly Honoured Demon Suppressor, who now lives on Mount Wudang in the Southern Continent of Jambu. I'll go and ask him to rescue my master.&#8221; Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>With the Way still uncompleted ape and horse were scattered;</P>
<P>When the mind was masterless the Five Elements lacked life.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know what happened on this journey listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>妖邪假设小雷音</p>
<p>四众皆遭大厄难</p>
</div>
<p>这回因果，劝人为善，切休作恶。一念生，神明照鉴，任他为作。拙蠢乖能君怎学，两般还是无心药。趁生前有道正该修，莫浪泊。认根源，脱本壳。访长生，须把捉。要时时明见，醍醐斟酌。贯彻三关填黑海，管教善者乘鸾鹤。那其间愍故更慈悲，登极乐。话表唐三藏一念虔诚，且休言天神保护，似这草木之灵，尚来引送，雅会一宵，脱出荆棘针刺，再无萝蓏攀缠。四众西进，行彀多时，又值冬残，正是那三春之日：物华交泰，斗柄回寅。草芽遍地绿，柳眼满堤青。一岭桃花红锦涴，半溪烟水碧罗明。几多风雨，无限心情。日晒花心艳，燕衔苔蕊轻。山色王维画浓淡，鸟声季子舌纵横。芳菲铺绣无人赏，蝶舞蜂歌却有情。师徒们也自寻芳踏翠，缓随马步，正行之间，忽见一座高山，远望着与天相接。三藏扬鞭指道：“悟空，那座山也不知有多少高，可便似接着青天，透冲碧汉。”行者道：“古诗不云只有天在上，更无山与齐。但言山之极高，无可与他比并，岂有接天之理！”八戒道：“若不接天，如何把昆仑山号为天柱？”行者道：“你不知，自古天不满西北。昆仑山在西北乾位上，故有顶天塞空之意，遂名天柱。”沙僧笑道：“大哥把这好话儿莫与他说，他听了去，又降别人。我们且走路，等上了那山，就知高下也。”</p>

<p>那呆子赶着沙僧厮耍厮斗，老师父马快如飞，须臾，到那山崖之边。一步步往上行来，只见那山：林中风飒飒，涧底水潺潺。鸦雀飞不过，神仙也道难。千崖万壑，亿曲百湾。尘埃滚滚无人到，怪石森森不厌看。有处有云如水滉，是方是树鸟声繁。鹿衔芝去，猿摘桃还。狐貉往来崖上跳，麖獐出入岭头顽。</p>

<p>忽闻虎啸惊人胆，斑豹苍狼把路拦。唐三藏一见心惊，孙行者神通广大，你看他一条金箍棒，哮吼一声，吓过了狼虫虎豹，剖开路，引师父直上高山。行过岭头，下西平处，忽见祥光蔼蔼，彩雾纷纷，有一所楼台殿阁，隐隐的钟磬悠扬。三藏道：“徒弟们，看是个甚么去处。”行者抬头，用手搭凉篷，仔细观看，那壁厢好个所在！真个是：珍楼宝座，上刹名方。谷虚繁地籁，境寂散天香。青松带雨遮高阁，翠竹留云护讲堂。霞光缥缈龙宫显，彩色飘飖沙界长。朱栏玉户，画栋雕梁。谈经香满座，语箓月当窗。鸟啼丹树内，鹤饮石泉旁。四围花发琪园秀，三面门开舍卫光。楼台突兀门迎嶂，钟磬虚徐声韵长。窗开风细，帘卷烟茫。有僧情散淡，无俗意和昌。红尘不到真仙境，静土招提好道场。行者看罢回复道：“师父，那去处是便是座寺院，却不知禅光瑞蔼之中，又有些凶气何也。观此景象，也似雷音，却又路道差池。我们到那厢，决不可擅入，恐遭毒手。”唐僧道：“既有雷音之景，莫不就是灵山？你休误了我诚心，担搁了我来意。”行者道：“不是不是！灵山之路我也走过几遍，那是这路途！”八戒道：“纵然不是，也必有个好人居住。”沙僧道：“不必多疑，此条路未免从那门首过，是不是一见可知也。”行者道：</p>

<p>“悟净说得有理。”</p>

<p>那长老策马加鞭至山门前，见雷音寺三个大字，慌得滚下马来，倒在地下，口里骂道：“泼猢狲！害杀我也！现是雷音寺，还哄我哩！”行者陪笑道：“师父莫恼，你再看看。山门上乃四个字，你怎么只念出三个来，倒还怪我？”长老战兢兢的爬起来再看，真个是四个字，乃小雷音寺。三藏道：“就是小雷音寺，必定也有个佛祖在内。经上言三千诸佛，想是不在一方：似观音在南海，普贤在峨眉，文殊在五台。这不知是那一位佛祖的道场。</p>

<p>古人云，有佛有经，无方无宝，我们可进去来。”行者道：“不可进去，此处少吉多凶，若有祸患，你莫怪我。”三藏道：“就是无佛，也必有个佛象。我弟子心愿遇佛拜佛，如何怪你。”即命八戒取袈裟，换僧帽，结束了衣冠，举步前进。只听得山门里有人叫道：“唐僧，你自东土来拜见我佛，怎么还这等怠慢？”三藏闻言即便下拜，八戒也磕头，沙僧也跪倒，惟大圣牵马收拾行李在后。方入到二层门内，就见如来大殿。殿门外宝台之下，摆列着五百罗汉、三千揭谛、四金刚、八菩萨、比丘尼、优婆塞、无数的圣僧、道者，真个也香花艳丽，瑞气缤纷。慌得那长老与八戒沙僧一步一拜，拜上灵台之间，行者公然不拜。又闻得莲台座上厉声高叫道：“那孙悟空，见如来怎么不拜？”不知行者又仔细观看，见得是假，遂丢了马匹行囊，掣棒在手喝道：“你这伙孽畜，十分胆大！怎么假倚佛名，败坏如来清德！不要走！”</p>

<p>双手轮棒，上前便打。只听得半空中叮狢一声，撇下一副金铙，把行者连头带足，合在金铙之内。慌得个猪八戒、沙和尚连忙使起钯杖，就被些阿罗揭谛、圣僧道者一拥近前围绕。他两个措手不及，尽被拿了，将三藏捉住，一齐都绳缠索绑，紧缚牢栓。</p>

<p>原来那莲花座上装佛祖者乃是个妖王，众阿罗等都是些小怪。遂收了佛祖体象，依然现出妖身，将三众抬入后边收藏，把行者合在金铙之中永不开放，只搁在宝台之上，限三昼夜化为脓血。化后，才将铁笼蒸他三个受用。这正是：碧眼猢儿识假真，禅机见象拜金身。黄婆盲目同参礼，木母痴心共话论。邪怪生强欺本性，魔头怀恶诈天人。诚为道小魔头大，错入旁门枉费身。那时群妖将唐僧三众收藏在后，把马拴在后边，把他的袈裟僧帽安在行李担内，亦收藏了，一壁厢严紧不题。</p>

<p>却说行者合在金铙里，黑洞洞的，燥得满身流汗，左拱右撞，不能得出，急得他使铁棒乱打，莫想得动分毫。他心里没了算计，将身往外一挣，却要挣破那金铙，遂捻着一个诀，就长有千百丈高，那金铙也随他身长，全无一些瑕缝光明。却又捻诀把身子往下一小，小如芥菜子儿，那铙也就随身小了，更没些些孔窍。他又把铁棒吹口仙气，叫“变！”即变做幡竿一样，撑住金铙。他却把脑后毫毛选长的拔下两根，叫“变！”即变做梅花头五瓣钻儿，挨着棒下，钻有千百下，只钻得苍苍响魀，再不钻动一些。行者急了，却捻个诀，念一声“唵囒静法界，乾元亨利贞”的咒语，拘得那五方揭谛，六丁六甲、一十八位护教伽蓝，都在金铙之外道：“大圣，我等俱保护着师父，不教妖魔伤害，你又拘唤我等做甚？”行者道：“我那师父，不听我劝解，就弄死他也不亏！但只你等怎么快作法将这铙钹掀开，放我出来，再作处治。这里面不通光亮，满身暴燥，却不闷杀我也？”众神真个掀铙，就如长就的一般，莫想揭得分毫。金头揭谛道：“大圣，这铙钹不知是件甚么宝贝，连上带下，合成一块。小神力薄，不能掀动。”行者道：“我在里面，不知使了多少神通，也不得动。”</p>

<p>揭谛闻言，即着六丁神保护着唐僧，六甲神看守着金铙，众伽蓝前后照察，他却纵起祥光，须臾间闯入南天门里，不待宣召，直上灵霄宝殿之下，见玉帝俯伏启奏道：“主公，臣乃五方揭谛使。今有齐天大圣保唐僧取经，路遇一山，名小雷音寺。</p>

<p>唐僧错认灵山进拜，原来是妖魔假设，困陷他师徒，将大圣合在一副金铙之内，进退无门，看看至死，特来启奏。”即传旨：</p>

<p>“差二十八宿星辰，快去释厄降妖。”那星宿不敢少缓，随同揭谛，出了天门，至山门之内。有二更时分，那些大小妖精，因获了唐僧，老妖俱犒赏了，各去睡觉。众星宿更不惊张，都到铙钹之外报道：“大圣，我等是玉帝差来二十八宿，到此救你。”行者听说大喜，便教：“动兵器打破，老孙就出来了！”众星宿道：“不敢打，此物乃浑金之宝，打着必响；响时惊动妖魔，却难救拔。</p>

<p>等我们用兵器捎他，你那里但见有一些光处就走。”行者道：</p>

<p>“正是。”你看他们使枪的使枪，使剑的使剑，使刀的使刀，使斧的使斧；扛的扛，抬的抬，掀的掀，捎的捎，弄到有三更天气，漠然不动，就是铸成了囫囵的一般。那行者在里边，东张张，西望望，爬过来，滚过去，莫想看见一些光亮。亢金龙道：“大圣啊，且休焦躁，观此宝定是个如意之物，断然也能变化。你在那里面，于那合缝之处，用手摸着，等我使角尖儿拱进来，你可变化了，顺松处脱身。”行者依言，真个在里面乱摸。这星宿把身变小了，那角尖儿就似个针尖一样，顺着钹合缝口上，伸将进去，可怜用尽千斤之力，方能穿透里面。却将本身与角使法象，叫“长！长！长！”角就长有碗来粗细。那钹口倒也不象金铸的，好似皮肉长成的，顺着亢金龙的角，紧紧噙住，四下里更无一丝拔缝。行者摸着他的角叫道：“不济事！上下没有一毫松处！</p>

<p>没奈何，你忍着些儿疼，带我出去。”好大圣，即将金箍棒变作一把钢钻儿，将他那角尖上钻了一个孔窍，把身子变得似个芥菜子儿，拱在那钻眼里蹲着叫：“扯出角去！扯出角去！”这星宿又不知费了多少力，方才拔出，使得力尽筋柔，倒在地下。</p>

<p>行者却自他角尖钻眼里钻出，现了原身，掣出铁棒，照铙钹当的一声打去，就如崩倒铜山，咋开金铙，可惜把个佛门之器，打做个千百块散碎之金！唬得那二十八宿惊张，五方揭谛发竖，大小群妖皆梦醒。老妖王睡里慌张，急起来披衣擂鼓，聚点群妖，各执器械。此时天将黎明，一拥赶到宝台之下，只见孙行者与列宿围在碎破金铙之外，大惊失色，即令：“小的们！紧关了前门，不要放出人去！”行者听说，即携星众，驾云跳在九霄空里。那妖王收了碎金，排开妖卒，列在山门外。妖王怀恨，没奈何披挂了，使一根短软狼牙棒，出营高叫：“孙行者！好男子不可远走高飞！快向前与我交战三合！”行者忍不住，即引星众，按落云头，观看那妖精怎生模样，但见他：蓬着头，勒一条扁薄金箍；光着眼，簇两道黄眉的竖。悬胆鼻，孔窃开查；四方口，牙齿尖利。穿一副叩结连环铠，勒一条生丝攒穗绦。脚踏乌喇鞋一对，手执狼牙棒一根。此形似兽不如兽，相貌非人却似人。行者挺着铁棒喝道：“你是个甚么怪物，擅敢假装佛祖，侵占山头，虚设小雷音寺！”那妖王道：“这猴儿是也不知我的姓名，故来冒犯仙山。此处唤做小西天，因我修行，得了正果，天赐与我的宝阁珍楼。我名乃是黄眉老佛，这里人不知，但称我为黄眉大王、黄眉爷爷。一向久知你往西去，有些手段，故此设象显能，诱你师父进来，要和你打个赌赛。如若斗得过我，饶你师徒，让汝等成个正果；如若不能，将汝等打死，等我去见如来取经，果正中华也。”行者笑道：“妖精不必海口，既要赌，快上来领棒！”那妖王喜孜孜，使狼牙棒抵住。这一场好杀：两条棒，不一样，说将起来有形状：一条短软佛家兵，一条坚硬藏海藏。都有随心变化功，今番相遇争强壮。短软狼牙杂锦妆，坚硬金箍蛟龙象。若粗若细实可夸，要短要长甚停当。猴与魔，齐打仗，这场真个无虚诳。驯猴秉教作心猿，泼怪欺天弄假象。</p>

<p>嗔嗔恨恨各无情，恶恶凶凶都有样。那一个当头手起不放松，这一个架丢劈面难推让。喷云照日昏，吐雾遮峰嶂。棒来棒去两相迎，忘生忘死因三藏。看他两个斗经五十回合，不见输赢。</p>

<p>那山门口，鸣锣擂鼓，众妖精呐喊摇旗。这壁厢有二十八宿天兵共五方揭谛众圣，各掮器械，吆喝一声，把那魔头围在中间，吓得那山门外群妖难擂鼓，战兢兢手软不敲锣。老妖魔公然不惧，一只手使狼牙棒，架着众兵，一只手去腰间解下一条旧白布搭包儿，往上一抛，滑的一声响喨，把孙大圣、二十八宿与五方揭谛，一搭包儿通装将去，挎在肩上，拽步回身，众小妖个个欢然得胜而回。老妖教小的们取了三五十条麻索，解开搭包，拿一个，捆一个，一个个都骨软筋麻，皮肤窊皱。捆了抬去后边，不分好歹，俱掷之于地。妖王又命排筵畅饮，自旦至暮方散，各归寝处不题。</p>

<p>却说孙大圣与众神捆至夜半，忽闻有悲泣之声。侧耳听时，却原来是三藏声音，哭道：“悟空啊！我自恨当时不听伊，致令今日受灾危。金铙之内伤了你，麻绳捆我有谁知。四人遭逢缘命苦，三千功行尽倾颓。何由解得迍邅难，坦荡西方去复归！”行者听言，暗自怜悯道：“那师父虽是未听吾言，今遭此毒，然于患难之中，还有忆念老孙之意。趁此夜静妖眠，无人防备，且去解脱众等逃生也。”好大圣，使了个遁身法，将身一小，脱下绳来，走近唐僧身边，叫声“师父。”长老认得声音，叫道：</p>

<p>“你为何到此？”行者悄悄的把前项事告诉了一遍，长老甚喜道：“徒弟！快救我一救！向后事但凭你处，再不强了！”行者才动手，先解了师父，放了八戒沙僧，又将二十八宿、五方揭谛个个解了，又牵过马来，教快先走出去。方出门，却不知行李在何处，又来找寻。亢金龙道：“你好重物轻人！既救了你师父就彀了，又还寻甚行李？”行者道：“人固要紧，衣钵尤要紧。包袱中有通关文牒、锦襕袈裟、紫金钵盂，俱是佛门至宝，如何不要！”</p>

<p>八戒道：“哥哥，你去找寻，我等先去路上等你。”你看那星众，簇拥着唐僧，使个摄法，共弄神通，一阵风撮出垣围，奔大路下了山坡，却屯于平处等候。</p>

<p>约有三更时分，孙大圣轻挪慢步，走入里面，原来一层层门户甚紧。他就爬上高楼看时，窗牖皆关，欲要下去，又恐怕窗棂儿响，不敢推动。捻着诀，摇身一变，变做一个仙鼠，俗名蝙蝠。你道他怎生模样：头尖还似鼠，眼亮亦如之。有翅黄昏出，无光白昼居。藏身穿瓦穴，觅食扑蚊儿。偏喜晴明月，飞腾最识时。他顺着不封瓦口椽子之下，钻将进去，越门过户，到了中间看时，只见那第三重楼窗之下，熌灼灼一道毫光，也不是灯烛之光，香火之光，又不是飞霞之光，掣电之光。他半飞半跳，近于光前看时，却是包袱放光。那妖精把唐僧的袈裟脱了，不曾折，就乱乱的揌在包袱之内。那袈裟本是佛宝，上边有如意珠、摩尼珠、红玛瑙、紫珊瑚、舍利子、夜明珠，所以透的光彩。</p>

<p>他见了此衣钵，心中一喜，就现了本象，拿将过来，也不管担绳偏正，抬上肩，往下就走，不期脱了一头，扑的落在楼板上，唿喇的一声响喨。噫！有这般事：可可的老妖精在楼下睡觉，一声响把他惊醒，跳起来乱叫道：“有人了！有人了！”那些大小妖都起来，点灯打火，一齐吆喝，前后去看。有的来报道：“唐僧走了！”又有的来报道：“行者众人俱走了！”老妖急传号令，教：</p>

<p>“拿！各门上谨慎！”行者听言，恐又遭他罗网，挑不成包袱，纵筋斗就跳出楼窗外走了。</p>

<p>那妖精前前后后，寻不着唐僧等，又见天色将明，取了棒，帅众来赶，只见那二十八宿与五方揭谛等神，云雾腾腾，屯住山坡之下。妖王喝了一声“那里去！吾来也！”角木蛟急唤：“兄弟们！怪物来了！”亢金龙、女土蝠、房日兔、心月狐、尾火虎、箕水豹、斗木獬、牛金牛、氐土貉、虚日鼠、危月燕、室火猪、壁水獝、奎木狼、娄金狗、胃土彘、昴日鸡、毕月乌、觜火猴、参水猿、井木犴、鬼金羊、柳土獐、星日马、张月鹿、翼火蛇、轸水蚓，领着金头揭谛、银头揭谛、六甲、六丁等神、护教伽蓝，同八戒沙僧，不领唐三藏，丢了白龙马，各执兵器，一拥而上。这妖王见了，呵呵冷笑，叫一声哨子，有四五千大小妖精，一个个威强力胜，浑战在西山坡上。好杀：魔头泼恶欺真性，真性温柔怎奈魔。百计施为难脱苦，千方妙用不能和。诸天来拥护，众圣助干戈。留情亏木母，定志感黄婆。浑战惊天并振地，强争设网与张罗。那壁厢摇旗呐喊，这壁厢擂鼓筛锣。枪刀密密寒光荡，剑戟纷纷杀气多。妖卒凶还勇，神兵怎奈何！愁云遮日月，惨雾罩山河。苦掤苦拽来相战，皆因三藏拜弥陀。那妖精倍加勇猛，帅众上前掩杀。正在那不分胜败之际，只闻得行者叱咤一声道：“老孙来了！”八戒迎着道：“行李如何？”行者道：“老孙的性命几乎难免，却便说甚么行李！”沙僧执着宝杖道：“且休叙话，快去打妖精也！”那星宿、揭谛、丁甲等神，被群妖围在垓心浑杀，老妖使棒来打他三个。这行者、八戒、沙僧丢开棍杖、轮着钉钯抵住。真个是地暗天昏，不能取胜，只杀得太阳星，西没山根；太阴星，东生海峤。那妖见天晚，打个哨子，教群妖各各留心，他却取出宝贝。孙行者看得分明，那怪解下搭包，拿在手中。行者道声“不好了！走啊！”他就顾不得八戒沙僧、诸天等众，一路筋斗，跳上九霄空里。众神、八戒、沙僧不解其意，被他抛起去，又都装在里面，只是走了行者。那妖王收兵回寺，又教取出绳索，照旧绑了。将唐僧、八戒、沙僧悬梁高吊，白马拴在后边，诸神亦俱绑缚，抬在地窖子内，封了盖锁。那众妖遵依，一一收了不题。</p>

<p>却说行者跳在九霄，全了性命，见妖兵回转，不张旗号，已知众等遭擒。他却按下祥光，落在那东山顶上，咬牙恨怪物，滴泪想唐僧，仰面朝天望，悲嗟忽失声，叫道：“师父啊！你是那世里造下这迍邅难，今生里步步遇妖精，似这般苦楚难逃，怎生是好！”独自一个，嗟叹多时，复又宁神思虑，以心问心道：“这妖魔不知是个甚么搭包子，那般装得许多物件？如今将天神天将许多人又都装进去了，我待求救于天，奈恐玉帝见怪。我记得有个北方真武，号曰荡魔天尊，他如今现在南赡部洲武当山上，等我去请他来搭救师父一难。”正是：仙道未成猿马散，心神无主五行枯。毕竟不知此去端的如何，且听下回分解。</p>
