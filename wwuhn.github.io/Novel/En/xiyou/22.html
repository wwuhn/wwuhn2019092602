<P>The Protectors of the Faith Build a Farm for the Great Sage</P>
<P>Lingji from Sumeru Pacifies the Wind Devil</P>
	</div>




<P>The fifty petty devils fled routed into the cave, their banners and drums smashed, to report, &#8220;Your Majesty, the Tiger of the Vanguard is no match for the hairy-faced monk, who chased him down the mountain.&#8221; The old fiend was very angry at the news, and he sat silent with his head bowed as he thought over what to do.</P>
<P>Then the petty demons from the gate came in to announce, &#8220;Your Majesty, the hairy-faced monk has killed the Tiger of the Vanguard and dragged his body to the gates, where he's insulting us to provoke us to fight.&#8221;</P>
<P>The old fiend was angrier than ever when he heard this, and he said, &#8220;This wretch doesn't know what he's doing, killing my Commander of the Vanguard although I haven't eaten his master. Hateful beast. Bring my armour. I've heard of this Brother Monkey, and now I think I'll go out to have a look at this nine-headed, eight-tailed monk. I'll capture him to avenge my Tiger of the Vanguard.&#8221; The junior devils brought the armour as fast as they could, and when the old fiend had put it all on properly, he took his steel trident and led his devilish host out of the cave. He was full of martial dignity as he came out, and you can see how he was equipped:</P>


<P>His golden helmet shone in the sun,</P>
<P>And light was reflected from his golden armour.</P>
<P>A pheasant's tail floated above his helmet,</P>
<P>And the thin silk robe over his armour was pale goose-yellow.</P>
<P>The belt that girded his armour was dragon-brilliant;</P>
<P>His shining breastplate dazzled the eye.</P>
<P>His deerskin boots</P>
<P>Were the color of locust-tree blossom;</P>
<P>His brocade kilt</P>
<P>Was patterned with willow leaves.</P>
<P>With a sharp steel trident in his hand,</P>
<P>He was no less awesome than the Little Sage Erlang.</P>


<P>As he came out of his cave the old fiend shouted at the top of his voice, &#8220;Are you Brother Monkey?&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey, who was jumping up and down on the tiger monster's corpse and brandishing his cudgel, replied, &#8220;Your grandfather, Monkey, is here. Send my master out.&#8221; The evil spirit looked carefully at Monkey and saw that he had a miserable little body and a pinched face, and did not even stand four feet tall.</P>
<P>&#8220;Poor little thing,&#8221; he said with a laugh. &#8220;I'd imagined that you were some sort of invincible hero, but now I see what a little sick devil you really are, all skin and bone.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey smiled back and said, &#8220;You've no eyes in your head, my child. I may be tiny, but if you hit me on the head with the handle of your trident, I'll grow another six feet.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Make your head hard then,&#8221; the monster replied, &#8220;here it comes.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Great Sage did not flinch as the monster hit him, then with a bend of his waist he grew six feet taller, making himself ten feet tall altogether, to the astonishment of the monster, who put his trident down and shouted, &#8220;Brother Monkey, why do you come and do these defensive transformations at my gate? Stop fooling around, and come over here so we can compare tricks.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My child,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;as the saying goes, 'If you have any warm feelings, don't raise your hand in anger; and if you raise your hand in anger, put all feelings aside.' I have a very heavy hand, and I'm afraid that you may not be able to stand my cudgel.&#8221; No longer wishing to talk, the monster whirled his trident round and lunged at Monkey's chest. With unrushed expertise Monkey did a &#8220;Black Dragon Pawing the Ground&#8221; movement to parry the trident with his cudgel before striking at the monster's head. There followed a fine duel between the pair of them at the mouth of the Yellow Wind Gave:</P>


<P>The demon king was furious,</P>
<P>The Great Sage showed his might.</P>
<P>The furious demon king</P>
<P>Wanted to catch Monkey in revenge for his Vanguard Commander;</P>
<P>The mighty Great Sage</P>
<P>Intended to capture the evil spirit and rescue his master.</P>
<P>When the trident came the cudgel parried,</P>
<P>When the cudgel struck the trident blocked.</P>
<P>One was supreme commander of the mountain,</P>
<P>The other was the Handsome Monkey King, Protector of the Law.</P>
<P>At first they fought in the dust,</P>
<P>But then they rose into mid-air.</P>
<P>The steel-tipped trident</P>
<P>Was bright-pointed and deadly sharp;</P>
<P>The As-You-Will cudgel</P>
<P>Was black and banded with gold.</P>
<P>Whoever was run through would go to the Underworld;</P>
<P>If either was hit he would surely meet King Yama.</P>
<P>All depended on a fast hand and a quick eye;</P>
<P>Strength and vigor were essential.</P>
<P>Each was mindless of life or death,</P>
<P>Who would survive, and who would be killed?</P>


<P>After some thirty rounds of combat between the old fiend and the Great Sage the issue was still not settled. As Monkey wanted to win glory he used an &#8220;extra body&#8221; trick: plucking a hair out, he chewed it into little bits, blew them all out, and shouted, &#8220;Change!&#8221; They turned into well over a hundred Monkeys, all dressed like him and wielding iron cudgels. They surrounded the monster in mid-air, and in his fright he countered with a trick of his own. He turned his head sharply to the Southeast opened his mouth three times, and blew. A yellow hurricane suddenly arose. It was really terrible.</P>


<P>As it howled and moaned all was changed;</P>
<P>Without sign or shadow the yellow dust whirled,</P>
<P>Whistling through forests, toppling mountains, and uprooting trees,</P>
<P>Picking up dust to blot out the tumbling ridge.</P>
<P>The Yellow River's waters were all in turmoil,</P>
<P>While the Yangtse's waves were blown backwards.</P>
<P>The Polar palace was rocked in the sky,</P>
<P>The Senluo Palace in the Underworld was all but blown down.</P>
<P>Heaven was filled with the shouting of Arhats,</P>
<P>The Eight Great Vajrapanis were all yelling wildly.</P>
<P>Manjusri's black-coated lion fled,</P>
<P>Samantabhadra's white elephant was nowhere to be found.</P>
<P>The True Martial Emperor's tortoise and snake were missing,</P>
<P>Zi Tong's mule was blown away by its saddle-cloth.</P>
<P>Travelling merchants called on Heaven,</P>
<P>Boatmen made vows to the gods as they sought safety.</P>
<P>Lives were washed away in the torrent,</P>
<P>Fortune or death was decided by the waters.</P>
<P>The cave palace on the magic mountain was murky dark,</P>
<P>And Penglai, island of joy, was wrapped in gloom.</P>
<P>Lao Zi could hardly manage to look after his furnace,</P>
<P>The Star of Longevity put away his fan of dragon's beard grass.</P>
<P>The Queen Mother, on her way to a Peach Banquet,</P>
<P>Had the pendants at her waist blown in a tangle.</P>
<P>Erlang could not find his city of Guanzhou;</P>
<P>Nezha could scarcely draw his sword from its scabbard.</P>
<P>Heavenly King Li lost sight of the pagoda in his hand,</P>
<P>Lu Ban the carpenter dropped his gold-tipped awl.</P>
<P>Three stories of the pagoda at Thunder Monastery fell,</P>
<P>And the stone bridge at Zhaozhou collapsed.</P>
<P>The red wheel of the sun sent out no light,</P>
<P>And all the stars in the sky were dimmed.</P>
<P>The birds of the Southern hills were carried to the North,</P>
<P>The waters of the East lake flowed to the West.</P>
<P>Husband was parted from wife,</P>
<P>Mother snatched from child.</P>
<P>The dragon king searched the seas for his yakshas,</P>
<P>The thunder god hunted everywhere for his lightning.</P>
<P>The Ten Kings of hell looked for the judge,</P>
<P>While the bull-headed demons searched for the horse-faced.</P>
<P>This hurricane overturned Potaraka Island,</P>
<P>Rolling up all of Guanyin's scriptures.</P>
<P>The white lotus went flying beyond the seas,</P>
<P>And the twelve courts of the Bodhisattva were all blown down.</P>
<P>Pan Gu, who had seen all winds since creation,</P>
<P>Had never seen one as fine as this,</P>
<P>Howl, howl&#8212;</P>
<P>As mountains and seas trembled,</P>
<P>Heaven and Earth were all but blasted asunder.</P>


<P>The hurricane that the monster had summoned up made all the little Monkeys that the Great Sage had produced from his hair whirl round in mid-air like so many spinning-wheels, and, far from being able to use their cudgels, they could not even control their own bodies. At this critical moment Monkey shook his hair and put it back on his body, then advanced to give battle with his iron cudgel held high. The monster blew another yellow hurricane at him, and it was so strong that Monkey had to shut his fiery eyes with their golden pupils tight. Opening them was out of the question. Unable to use his iron cudgel, he had to flee from the scene of battle, at which the monster put his wind away and went back to his cave.</P>
<P>When Pig saw the great yellow hurricane blow up and cast Heaven and Earth into darkness, he held on to the horse and kept a grip on the carrying pole while he crouched in the hollow on the mountain side, not daring to open his eyes or raise his head as he invoked the Buddha and made all sorts of vows to him. He did not know whether Monkey had won or lost, or whether their master was still alive. As he worried about all this the wind died down and the sky became clear again. He raised his head to look towards the entrance of the cave, but he could neither see any weapons nor hear any gongs or drums. The idiot did not want to get any nearer to those gates, and there was nobody else to look after the horse and the baggage, so he was stuck there, not knowing what to do, and feeling miserable. His gloomy thoughts were interrupted by the sound of Monkey shouting to the West of him. Pig half rose to his feet to welcome him and said, &#8220;That was quite a wind, elder brother. Where've you been?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That was terrible,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;Never in my life have I known such a hurricane. That old fiend came out to fight me with a steel trident, and after we'd been at it for thirty rounds I used my extra body trick to surround him. This made him so worried that he deliberately summoned up the wind. It was really vicious&#8212;it blew so hard I couldn't stand my ground, so I had to put my tricks away and clear out. What a wind, what a wind! I can call up wind or rain, but I've never produced anything as vicious as his.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Can that evil monster fight well?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;He's not bad at all,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and he has a very neat way with this trident. We were evenly matched, apart from that foul wind, which makes him unbeatable.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Then how are we going to rescue our master?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;His rescue will have to wait,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;I wonder if there's an oculist near here to treat my eyes.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What's happened to them?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;When that monster blew his wind at me,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;it made my eyes very sore, and they keep on watering.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We're halfway up a mountain, and night's falling,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;Never mind about an oculist, there's nowhere for us to shelter for the night.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no problem about shelter,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;I don't think that evil spirit will dare to do our master any harm, so let's find the main path and look for a house to stay in tonight. We can come back here at first light to subdue that fiend.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well, very well,&#8221; Pig replied.</P>
<P>Leading the horse and carrying the baggage, they came out of the hollow and went along the path. The dusk was gradually deepening when they heard dogs barking under a hill to the South of the path. They stopped to look and saw a farmhouse with a lamp shining brightly in its window. The pair of them stopped bothering to look for the path and cut straight through the grass to the gate. They saw</P>



<P>Dark magic fungus,</P>
<P>Greeny white rocks.</P>
<P>The magic fungus was dark among the many herbs,</P>
<P>The white rocks were green with moss.</P>
<P>Some tiny fireflies made dots of light</P>
<P>Against the dense ranks of the forest trees.</P>
<P>Heavy was the fragrance of the orchid,</P>
<P>And the tender bamboo had been newly cut.</P>
<P>A pure spring flowed along a winding bed,</P>
<P>An ancient cypress hung over a cliff.</P>
<P>No travelers came to this remote spot,</P>
<P>And only wild flowers bloomed before the gate.</P>


<P>As they did not want to march straight in, the two of them shouted, &#8220;Open up, open up.&#8221;</P>
<P>An old man came out at the head of several farm hands carrying forks, rakes and brooms. &#8220;Who are you,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;who are you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We are the disciples of the holy priest of the Great Tang in the East,&#8221; replied Monkey with a bow. &#8220;We were crossing these mountains on our way to the West to visit the Buddha and ask for the scriptures when the Great King of the Yellow Wind snatched our master away. We haven't been able to rescue him yet, but as it is getting dark we have come to beg for a night's lodging in your mansion, and we hope very much that you will help us.&#8221;</P>
<P>The old man returned his bow and said, &#8220;I'm sorry I didn't welcome you properly. This is a place where we see a lot of clouds but very few people, and when I heard you shouting at the gate I feared it might be fox-spirits, tigers, bandits from the mountains, or something of the sort. I am afraid that I have stupidly offended you: I did not realize it would be two reverend gentlemen. Please come in.&#8221; Taking the horse and the luggage with them they went inside, tethered the animal, put down the carrying pole, bowed to the old man, and sat down. A servant came in with tea, and when they had drunk it some bowls of sesame meal were produced. After they had eaten, the old man had beds prepared for them and suggested that they went to bed. &#8220;We don't need to sleep yet,&#8221; Monkey replied, adding, &#8220;may I ask you, kind sir, if eye ointment is sold anywhere around here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do you have a chronic eye complaint, reverend sir?&#8221; the old man asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I can tell you truthfully, sir,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;that we religious men have never been ill before, and I've never had trouble with my eyes before.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Then why are you asking for ointment?&#8221; the old man asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;We were trying to rescue our master on the Yellow Wind Ridge today,&#8221; Monkey explained, &#8220;when that monster started blowing his wind at me, which made my eyes ache. They're streaming with tears now, which is why I want to find some eye ointment.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;A fine story,&#8221; the old man commented. &#8220;How could you tell such lies, a reverend gentleman, and so young a one at that? The Great King of the Yellow Wind's hurricane is really terrible. It can't be compared with spring winds, autumn winds, pine and bamboo winds, or North, South, East and West winds.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It must be a brain-snatching wind,&#8221; interrupted Pig, &#8220;or a goat's ear wind, or a hemp wind, or a head-twisting wind.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; the old man said, &#8220;it's called a Divine Samadhi Wind.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What's it like?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>


<P>&#8220;It can darken Heaven and Earth,</P>
<P>Make gods and devils gloomy,</P>
<P>Split rocks open and bring cliffs down,</P>
<P>And it doesn't stop till you're dead,&#8221;</P>


<P>the old man replied. &#8220;If you'd encountered that wind, you couldn't possibly have survived. Only a god or an Immortal would be able to survive such a wind.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Quite right,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;quite right. Although we're not gods or Immortals ourselves, I regard them as my juniors, and this life of mine is extremely hard to snuff out&#8212;all the wind could do was to make my eyes very sore.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If what you say is true,&#8221; the old man said, &#8220;you must really be somebody. Although there is nowhere that sells eye ointment here, I sometimes suffer from watering eyes myself when I'm in the wind, and I once met an unusual person who gave me a prescription for 'Three Flower Nine Seed Ointment'. This cures all inflammations of the eye.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey bowed his head, chanted a respectful &#8220;na-a-aw,&#8221; and said, &#8220;Please put a little on my eyes for me to try.&#8221; The old man consented, went inside, and brought out a tiny agate bottle. Removing the stopper, he dipped a jade hairpin inside and put a tiny amount in Monkey's eyes, then told him not to open them. He could go to sleep without worrying, and in the morning he would be cured. When he had finished applying it he put the stopper back the bottle and gave it to a servant to put away inside. Pig opened their bundles, spread out their bedding, and told Monkey to go to bed.</P>
<P>Monkey groped about so wildly with his eyes shut that Pig laughed at him and said, &#8220;Would you like a blind man's stick, sir?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Chaff-guzzling moron,&#8221; Monkey retorted, &#8220;do you want to make a blind man of me?&#8221; The idiot chuckled himself quietly to sleep, but Monkey sat thinking on the bed until midnight before he dozed off.</P>
<P>At about five the next morning, just before the break of day, Brother Monkey rubbed his face, opened his eyes and said, &#8220;It certainly is good ointment&#8212;I can see far, and more clearly than ever.&#8221; He turned round to look behind him, and to his astonishment there was no house, windows, or doors; all that could be seen were some ancient locust trees and tall willows. The pair of them were sleeping on cushions of green sedge.</P>
<P>&#8220;What are you shouting for?&#8221; asked Pig as he woke up.</P>
<P>&#8220;Open your eyes and look,&#8221; replied Monkey. The idiot raised his head, and when he saw that there was nobody there, he leapt up in a panic with the words, &#8220;Where's our horse?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Over there, tied to a tree,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;What about the luggage?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There, beside your head.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The wretches,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;moving way in the middle of the night. Damn it, we must have been almost dead asleep. However did they dismantle the house without us hearing a thing?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Idiot,&#8221; said Monkey with a snigger, &#8220;don't go shouting all over the place. Can you see what that piece of paper on the tree over there is?&#8221; Pig went over, tore it down, and saw that there were four lines of verse on it:</P>


<P>&#8220;This farm was not inhabited by mortals;</P>
<P>The Revealers of the Truth produced the house by magic.</P>
<P>I gave you good medicine to cure your eyes:</P>
<P>Subdue demons with all your heart, and never hesitate.&#8221;</P>


<P>&#8220;So those tough gods came to play their tricks, although I haven't called the roll since they changed the dragon into a horse,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't show off, brother,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;How could they possibly answer to your roll-call?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't realize,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;that the Protectors of the Faith, the Six Dings, the Six Jias, the Revealers of the Truth of the Five Regions and the Four Duty Gods have all been ordered by the Bodhisattva to give secret protection to our master. They reported their names to me then, but as I've had you with me recently I haven't needed them again, which is why I haven't called the roll.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;if they have been ordered to protect our master in secret, then of course they can't appear in their true forms. That was why they produced the magic farm. You mustn't be angry with them. Yesterday they gave you eye ointment and fed us&#8212;they did all they could. Don't be angry with them. Let's go and rescue the master instead.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How right you are,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;It's not far from here to the Yellow Wind Cave, so there's no need for you to move. You'd better stay in the wood and look after the horse and the luggage while I go to the cave to see what I can find out about where our master is before fighting the monster again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;find out for sure whether he's alive or dead. If the master's dead, we'd better each go our own way, and if he's alive we'll do everything we can to save him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop talking such nonsense,&#8221; replied Monkey. &#8220;I'm off.&#8221;</P>
<P>With a single jump he arrived at the entrance to the cave, where the gates were still locked as everyone was asleep. Monkey did not call on them to open the gates as he did not want to alarm the monsters. Instead he said a spell, made a magic movement with his hand, shook himself, and turned into a neat little mosquito. There are some lines about it that go:</P>


<P>Its troublesome little body has a sharp bite,</P>
<P>Its faint buzz echoes like thunder.</P>
<P>Clever at getting through the curtains round the bed,</P>
<P>It particularly loves the summer's warm weather.</P>
<P>It fears only smoke and fly-swatters,</P>
<P>And loves the brilliance of the lamp.</P>
<P>Light and tiny, it flies straight in,</P>
<P>Entering the evil spirit's cave.</P>


<P>Seeing that the lowly demon on the gate was fast asleep and snoring, Monkey bit him on the face, at which the creature woke up and said, &#8220;My lord! What an enormous mosquito! It's raised a huge lump with a single bite.&#8221; Then he opened his eyes and announced, &#8220;It's light.&#8221; The two gates creaked open, and Monkey flew inside with a buzz to see the old demon giving orders that a very close watch was to be kept at all the gates, and all the weapons are to be assembled at such-and-such a spot.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm afraid that yesterday's wind may not have killed Brother Monkey,&#8221; he was saying, &#8220;and I think he's bound to come back today. When he does, I'll finish him off.&#8221;</P>
<P>When he heard this, Monkey flew across to the back of the hall where he saw a door that was tightly closed. He slipped through the crack between the two leaves of the door and found himself in a large empty garden, on one side of which was the wind-settling stake with the Tang Priest tied to it. The tears were pouring down Sanzang's face as he wondered where Monkey and Pig were. Monkey stopped flying as he stung his shaven pate and called, &#8220;Master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Monkey,&#8221; said Sanzang, recognizing his voice, &#8220;do you want to get me killed? Where are you calling me from?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm on your head, master. Don't be anxious or worried. We are sure to catch that evil spirit and save your life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How long will it be till you catch that evil spirit, disciple?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Pig has already killed the tiger monster who captured you,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;but that old fiend has a terrible way with a hurricane. All the same, I'm certain that I can catch him today, so don't worry and stop crying. I'm off now.&#8221;</P>
<P>With those words he buzzed away to the front hall, where he saw the old monster sitting on his throne and reviewing his captains. A junior evil spirit suddenly rushed in with a command flag in his hands and announced, &#8220;I had just gone out to patrol the mountain, Your Majesty, when I saw a monk with a long snout and big ears sitting in the woods. If I hadn't run as fast as I could, he'd have caught me. But I didn't see that hairy-faced monk.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If Brother Monkey wasn't there,&#8221; the old fiend said, &#8220;he must have been killed by the wind, and he won't be going off to get soldiers to rescue his master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If the wind killed him, Your Majesty,&#8221; the other devils said, &#8220;we are in luck. But if he wasn't killed and went to fetch divine soldiers instead, what's to be done?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What's so frightening about divine soldiers?&#8221; the old fiend said. &#8220;None of them can put down my wind except the Bodhisattva Lingji, so there's no need to fear the rest of them.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this as he sat on a roof-beam, he was beside himself with delight. Flying straight out, he reverted to his real form and went back to the wood, calling, &#8220;Brother.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where have you been?&#8221; Pig asked. &#8220;I chased an evil spirit with a command flag away just now.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Good for you,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile, &#8220;good for you. I changed myself into a mosquito and went into the cave to see our master. He was tied to a wind-settling stake in there and crying. I told him not to cry, flew up to a roof-beam, and had a good listen. I saw the one with the command flag come puffing and panting in to report that you'd chased him away and that he hadn't seen me. The old fined was making some wild guesses. First he said that I had been killed by his wind, then he said I'd gone to ask for the help of divine soldiers. It's wonderful&#8212;he gave the fellow's name away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Whose name?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;He said that no divine soldier could suppress his wind except the Bodhisattva Lingji,&#8221; Monkey continued, adding, &#8220;but I don't know where the Bodhisattva Lingji lives.&#8221;</P>
<P>As they were wondering what to do, an old man came along the road. Look at him:</P>


<P>He was strong enough not to need a stick,</P>
<P>But his beard was like ice and his flowing hair snowy.</P>
<P>Although his gold-flecked sparkling eyes seemed somewhat dim,</P>
<P>His aged bones and muscles had not lost their strength.</P>
<P>Slowly he walked, back bent, and head bowed down,</P>
<P>But his broad brow and rosy cheeks were those of a boy.</P>
<P>If you gave him a name from his looks,</P>
<P>The Star of Longevity had come out of his cave.</P>


<P>When Pig saw him he said with delight, &#8220;Brother, you know the saying, 'If you want to know the way down the mountain, ask a regular traveler.' Why don't you ask him?&#8221; The Great Sage put his iron cudgel away, unhitched his clothes, and went up to the old man. &#8220;Greetings, grandfather,&#8221; he said.</P>
<P>Half replying to him and half not, the old man returned his bow and asked, &#8220;Where are you from, monk, and what are you doing in this desolate spot?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We are holy monks going to fetch the scriptures,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Yesterday we lost our master here, and we would like to ask you, sir, where the Bodhisattva Lingji lives.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Lingji lives a thousand miles due South of here,&#8221; the old man said, &#8220;on a mountain called Little Mount Sumeru. There is a holy place there which is the monastery where he preaches the scriptures. Are you going to fetch scriptures from him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;we're going not to fetch scriptures from him, but to trouble him over something else. How does one get there?&#8221;</P>
<P>The old man pointed South and said, &#8220;That twisting path will take you.&#8221; Thus tricking the Great Sage into turning round to look, the old man turned into a puff of wind and disappeared from sight. All that could be seen of him was a piece of paper he had left beside the road. On it there were four lines of verse that read:</P>


<P>&#8220;I report to the Great Sage Equaling Heaven,</P>
<P>That I am Long Life Li.</P>
<P>On Sumeru Mountain there is a Flying Dragon Staff,</P>
<P>The weapon the Buddha once gave to Lingji.&#8221;</P>


<P>Brother Monkey took the note turned, and set off. &#8220;What lousy luck we've been having for the last few days, brother,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;For the last couple of days we've been seeing ghosts even in broad daylight. Who was that old man who turned into a wind?&#8221; Monkey handed the piece of paper to him, and when he had read it he said, &#8220;Who is this Long Life Li?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He's the Great White Planet of the West,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>Pig immediately bowed low and said, &#8220;My benefactor, my benefactor. If he hadn't put in a memorial to the Jade Emperor, I don't know what would have become of me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So you're capable of feeling gratitude,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Meanwhile, you're to hide deep in these woods without showing yourself, and keep a close watch on the baggage and the horse while I go to Mount Sumeru to ask the Bodhisattva to come.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Understood,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;understood. You go as fast as you can. I've learned the tortoise's trick, and can pull my head in when necessary.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Great Sage Monkey leapt into the air and headed South on his somersault cloud at tremendous speed. He could cover a thousand miles with a nod of his head, and do eight hundred stages with a twist of his waist. It was only an instant before he saw a high mountain surrounded by auspicious clouds and a propitious aura. In a valley on the mountain there was a monastery from which the distant sounds of bells and stone chimes could be heard, and a haze of incense smoke hung above it. Monkey went straight to the gate, where he saw a lay brother with prayer beads round his neck who was invoking the Buddha.</P>
<P>&#8220;Greetings, lay brother,&#8221; said Monkey, clasping his hands in salutation.</P>
<P>The lay brother bowed to him in reply and said, &#8220;Where are you from, sir?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Is this where the Bodhisattva Lingji preaches the scriptures?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, this is the place,&#8221; the lay brother replied. &#8220;Have you a message for him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I would like you to tell him that I am Brother Sun Wukong, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven, a disciple of the Patriarch Sanzang, the younger brother of His Majesty the Emperor of the Great Tang in the East, and there is a matter about which I should like to see the Bodhisattva.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's far too many words for me to remember, sir,&#8221; said the lay brother with a smile.</P>
<P>&#8220;Then tell him that the Tang Priest's disciple Sun Wukong is here,&#8221; Monkey replied. The lay brother did as he asked and went into the preaching hall to pass on the message. The Bodhisattva put on his cassock, burnt some incense, and prepared to receive him. As the Great Sage went through the gate and looked inside he saw:</P>


<P>A hall full of brocade,</P>
<P>A room of awe-inspiring majesty.</P>
<P>All the monks were chanting the Lotus Sutra</P>
<P>While the aged head priest lightly struck the golden chime.</P>
<P>The offerings made to the Buddha</P>
<P>Were magic fruit and magic flowers;</P>
<P>Set out on tables</P>
<P>Were meatless delicacies.</P>
<P>Dazzling candles</P>
<P>Sent golden flames up to the rainbow,</P>
<P>From fragrant incense</P>
<P>Jade smoke rose to the translucent mist.</P>
<P>With the sermon over and the mind at peace, a trance was entered.</P>
<P>White clouds coiled around the tops of the pine trees.</P>
<P>When the sword of wisdom is sheathed, the demon is beheaded;</P>
<P>Great are the powers of the prajna-paramita.</P>


<P>The Bodhisattva straightened his clothes and came out to meet Monkey, who climbed the steps into the hall and sat in the guest's seat. When the orders were given for tea to be brought, Monkey said, &#8220;I won't trouble you to give me tea. My master is in trouble on the Yellow Wind Mountain, and I have come to ask you, Bodhisattva, to use your great powers to subdue the demon and rescue my master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have been ordered by the Tathagata Buddha to guard over the Yellow Wind Monster,&#8221; the Bodhisattva replied. &#8220;The Tathagata gave me a Wind-settling Pill and a Flying Dragon Staff. When I captured that monster before, the Tathagata spared his life and exiled him to live in seclusion on this mountain, where he is not allowed to kill or do any other evil. I never imagined that he would want to murder your master today. I must hold myself responsible for this as I have failed to carry out my orders.&#8221; The Bodhisattva wanted to keep Monkey for a meal and a talk, but in response to Monkey's urgent pleading he took his Flying Dragon Staff and rode off with the Great Sage by cloud.</P>
<P>A moment later they reached the Yellow Wind Mountain, and the Bodhisattva said, &#8220;Great Sage, as this evil monster is a bit scared of me, I'd better stay here inside the cloud while you go down and challenge him to come out and fight. Once you've lured him out, I can use my divine power.&#8221; Doing as he suggested, Monkey brought his cloud down to land; and without more ado he smashed down the gates of the cave with his iron cudgel.</P>
<P>&#8220;Fiendish monster,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;give my master back.&#8221;</P>
<P>The junior fiends on the gate all rushed back to report this, and the old monster said, &#8220;That damned ape really has a cheek&#8212;instead of behaving himself properly, he comes to smash my gates down. This time I'll use a magic wind that will certainly blow him to death.&#8221; Putting on his armour and taking his trident as before, he went out through the gate, and the moment he saw Monkey, he thrust straight at his chest with his trident, not uttering a single word. Monkey sidestepped to dodge it and hit back at the monster's face with his cudgel. When only a few rounds had been fought, the monster turned to the Southeast and was just going to open his mouth and blow out a wind when the Bodhisattva Lingji appeared in mid-air and dropped the Flying Dragon Staff on him. While the monster recited all sorts of spells, an eight-clawed golden dragon grabbed him with two of its claws and smashed him several times against a rock-face. At this the monster reverted to his real form&#8212;a brown marten.</P>
<P>Monkey rushed at it and had raised his cudgel to kill it when the Bodhisattva stopped him and said, &#8220;Don't kill it, Great Sage. I must take it back to see the Tathagata. He used to be a marten who had obtained the Way underneath the Vulture Peak, and once he stole some of the pure oil from a crystal lamp. When the lamp went out he was so afraid of being caught by a Vajrapani that he ran away and became a spirit monster here. The Tathagata decided that as this was not a capital offence I should be sent to keep guard over him; but if he took life or committed any other evil deeds he was to be taken to the Vulture Peak. As he has now offended you, Great Sage, and captured the Tang Priest with the intention of murdering him, I must take him to see the Tathagata to be sentenced for his crime before this business can be regarded as cleared up.&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig, meanwhile, who had been wondering about Monkey as he waited in the wood, heard a shout from the mountainside, &#8220;Pig, bring the luggage and the horse out.&#8221;</P>
<P>Recognizing the voice as Monkey's, the idiot rushed out of the wood with the things and asked Monkey, &#8220;How did it go?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I asked the Bodhisattva Lingji to come, and he used his Flying Dragon Staff to capture the evil spirit, who turned out to have been the spirit of a brown-coated marten and was taken off to the Vulture Peak by the Bodhisattva to see the Buddha. We two had better go into the cave to rescue our master.&#8221; The idiot was very pleased to hear the news.</P>
<P>The pair of them charged into the cave and killed all the evil hares, fox-fiends, roebuck, and deer inside with the iron club and the rake. Then they went into the garden at the back to rescue their master. When he was outside he asked, &#8220;How did you two capture that evil spirit? How did you manage to rescue me?&#8221; Monkey told him all about how Lingji had subdued the fined, and Sanzang expressed his gratitude at great length while the two prepared a meal from the meatless food that there was in the cave. Then they left the cave and looked for the main path West once more.</P>
<P>If you don't know what happened later, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>护法设庄留大圣</p>
<p>须弥灵吉定风魔</p>
</div>
<p>却说那五十个败残的小妖，拿着些破旗破鼓，撞入洞里，报道：“大王，虎先锋战不过那毛脸和尚，被他赶下东山坡去了。”老妖闻说，十分烦恼，正低头不语，默思计策，又有把前门的小妖道：“大王，虎先锋被那毛脸和尚打杀了，拖在门口骂战哩。”那老妖闻言，愈加烦恼道：“这厮却也无知！我倒不曾吃他师父，他转打杀我家先锋，可恨！可恨！”叫：“取披挂来。我也只闻得讲甚么孙行者，等我出去，看是个甚么九头八尾的和尚，拿他进来，与我虎先锋对命。”众小妖急急抬出披挂。老妖结束齐整，绰一杆三股钢叉，帅群妖跳出本洞。那大圣停立门外，见那怪走将出来，着实骁勇。看他怎生打扮，但见：金盔晃日，金甲凝光。盔上缨飘山雉尾，罗袍罩甲淡鹅黄。勒甲绦盘龙耀彩，护心镜绕眼辉煌。鹿皮靴，槐花染色；锦围裙，柳叶绒妆。手持三股钢叉利，不亚当年显圣郎。</p>

<p>那老妖出得门来，厉声高叫道：“那个是孙行者？”这行者脚躧着虎怪的皮囊，手执着如意的铁棒，答道：“你孙外公在此，送出我师父来！”那怪仔细观看，见行者身躯鄙猥，面容羸瘦，不满四尺，笑道：“可怜！可怜！我只道是怎么样扳翻不倒的好汉，原来是这般一个骷髅的病鬼！”行者笑道：“你这个儿子，忒没眼色！你外公虽是小小的，你若肯照头打一叉柄，就长三尺。”那怪道：“你硬着头，吃吾一柄。”大圣公然不惧。那怪果打一下来，他把腰躬一躬，足长了三尺，有一丈长短，慌得那妖把钢叉按住，喝道：“孙行者，你怎么把这护身的变化法儿，拿来我门前使唤！莫弄虚头！走上来，我与你见见手段！”行者笑道：“儿子啊！常言道：留情不举手，举手不留情。你外公手儿重重的，只怕你捱不起这一棒！”那怪那容分说，拈转钢叉，望行者当胸就刺。这大圣正是会家不忙，忙家不会，理开铁棒，使一个乌龙掠地势，拨开钢叉，又照头便打。他二人在那黄风洞口，这一场好杀：妖王发怒，大圣施威。妖王发怒，要拿行者抵先锋；大圣施威，欲捉精灵救长老。叉来棒架，棒去叉迎。一个是镇山都总帅，一个是护法美猴王。初时还在尘埃战，后来各起在中央。点钢叉，尖明锐利；如意棒，身黑箍黄。戳着的魂归冥府，打着的定见阎王。全凭着手疾眼快，必须要力壮身强。两家舍死忘生战，不知那个平安那个伤！</p>

<p>那老妖与大圣斗经三十回合，不分胜败。这行者要见功绩，使一个身外身的手段：把毫毛揪下一把，用口嚼得粉碎，望上一喷，叫声“变！”变有百十个行者，都是一样打扮，各执一根铁棒，把那怪围在空中。那怪害怕，也使一般本事：急回头，望着巽地上把口张了三张，嘑的一口气，吹将出去，忽然间，一阵黄风，从空刮起。好风！真个利害：冷冷飕飕天地变，无影无形黄沙旋。穿林折岭倒松梅，播土扬尘崩岭坫。黄河浪泼彻底浑，湘江水涌翻波转。碧天振动斗牛宫，争些刮倒森罗殿。五百罗汉闹喧天，八大金刚齐嚷乱。文殊走了青毛狮，普贤白象难寻见。真武龟蛇失了群，梓橦骡子飘其韂。行商喊叫告苍天，梢公拜许诸般愿。烟波性命浪中流，名利残生随水办。仙山洞府黑攸攸，海岛蓬莱昏暗暗。老君难顾炼丹炉，寿星收了龙须扇。</p>

<p>王母正去赴蟠桃，一风吹断裙腰钏。二郎迷失灌州城，哪吒难取匣中剑。天王不见手心塔，鲁班吊了金头钻。雷音宝阙倒三层，赵州石桥崩两断。一轮红日荡无光，满天星斗皆昏乱。南山鸟往北山飞，东湖水向西湖漫。雌雄拆对不相呼，子母分离难叫唤。龙王遍海找夜叉，雷公到处寻闪电。十代阎王觅判官，地府牛头追马面。这风吹倒普陀山，卷起观音经一卷。白莲花卸海边飞，欢倒菩萨十二院。盘古至今曾见风，不似这风来不善。唿喇喇，乾坤险不炸崩开，万里江山都是颤！那妖怪使出这阵狂风，就把孙大圣毫毛变的小行者刮得在那半空中，却似纺车儿一般乱转，莫想轮得棒，如何拢得身？慌得行者将毫毛一抖，收上身来，独自个举着铁棒，上前来打，又被那怪劈脸喷了一口黄风，把两只火眼金睛，刮得紧紧闭合，莫能睁开，因此难使铁棒，遂败下阵来。那妖收风回洞不题。</p>

<p>却说猪八戒见那黄风大作，天地无光，牵着马，守着担，伏在山凹之间，也不敢睁眼，不敢抬头，口里不住的念佛许愿，又不知行者胜负何如，师父死活何如。正在那疑思之时，却早风定天晴，忽抬头往那洞门前看处，却也不见兵戈，不闻锣鼓。呆子又不敢上他门，又没人看守马匹、行李，果是进退两难，怆惶不已。忧虑间，只听得孙大圣从西边吆喝而来，他才欠身迎着道：“哥哥，好大风啊！你从那里走来？”行者摆手道：“利害！利害！我老孙自为人，不曾见这大风。那老妖使一柄三股钢叉，来与老孙交战，战到有三十余合，是老孙使一个身外身的本事，把他围打，他甚着急，故弄出这阵风来，果是凶恶，刮得我站立不住，收了本事，冒风而逃。哏，好风！哏，好风！老孙也会呼风，也会唤雨，不曾似这个妖精的风恶！”八戒道：“师兄，那妖精的武艺如何？”行者道：“也看得过，叉法儿倒也齐整，与老孙也战个手平。却只是风恶了，难得赢他。”八戒道：“似这般怎生救得师父？”行者道：“救师父且等再处，不知这里可有眼科先生，且教他把我眼医治医治。”八戒道：“你眼怎的来？”行者道：“我被那怪一口风喷将来，吹得我眼珠酸痛，这会子冷泪常流。”八戒道：“哥啊，这半山中，天色又晚，且莫说要甚么眼科，连宿处也没有了！”行者道：“要宿处不难。我料着那妖精还不敢伤我师父，我们且找上大路，寻个人家住下，过此一宵，明日天光，再来降妖罢。”八戒道：“正是，正是。”</p>

<p>他却牵了马，挑了担，出山凹，行上路口。此时渐渐黄昏，只听得那路南山坡下，有犬吠之声。二人停身观看，乃是一家庄院，影影的有灯火光明。他两个也不管有路无路，漫草而行，直至那家门首，但见：紫芝翳翳，白石苍苍。紫芝翳翳多青草，白石苍苍半绿苔。数点小萤光灼灼，一林野树密排排。香兰馥郁，嫩竹新栽。清泉流曲涧，古柏倚深崖。地僻更无游客到，门前惟有野花开。他两个不敢擅入，只得叫一声：“开门，开门！”</p>

<p>那里有一老者，带几个年幼的农夫，叉钯扫帚齐来，问道：“甚么人？甚么人？”行者躬身道：“我们是东土大唐圣僧的徒弟，因往西方拜佛求经，路过此山，被黄风大王拿了我师父去了，我们还未曾救得。天色已晚，特来府上告借一宵，万望方便方便。”那老者答礼道：“失迎，失迎。此间乃云多人少之处，却才闻得叫门，恐怕是妖狐老虎及山中强盗等类，故此小介愚顽，多有冲撞，不知是二位长老。请进，请进。”他兄弟们牵马挑担而入，径至里边，拴马歇担，与庄老拜见叙坐。又有苍头献茶，茶罢捧出几碗胡麻饭。饭毕，命设铺就寝，行者道：“不睡还可，敢问善人，贵地可有卖眼药的？”老者道：“是那位长老害眼？”</p>

<p>行者道：“不瞒你老人家说，我们出家人，自来无病，从不晓得害眼。”老人道：“既不害眼，如何讨药？”行者道：“我们今日在黄风洞口救我师父，不期被那怪将一口风喷来，吹得我眼珠酸痛。今有些眼泪汪汪，故此要寻眼药。”那老者道：“善哉！善哉！ｗωｗ奇Qisuu書com网</p>

<p>你这个长老，小小的年纪，怎么说谎？那黄风大圣风最利害。他那风，比不得甚么春秋风、松竹风与那东西南北风。”八戒道：</p>

<p>“想必是夹脑风、羊耳风、大麻风、偏正头风？”长者道：“不是，不是。他叫做三昧神风。”行者道：“怎见得？”老者道：“那风，能吹天地暗，善刮鬼神愁，裂石崩崖恶，吹人命即休。你们若遇着他那风吹了呵，还想得活哩！只除是神仙，方可得无事。”行者道：“果然！果然！我们虽不是神仙，神仙还是我的晚辈，这条命急切难休，却只是吹得我眼珠酸痛！”那老者道：“既如此说，也是个有来头的人。我这敝处却无卖眼药的，老汉也有些迎风冷泪，曾遇异人传了一方，名唤三花九子膏，能治一切风眼。”</p>

<p>行者闻言，低头唱喏道：“愿求些儿，点试，点试。”那老者应承，即走进去，取出一个玛瑙石的小罐儿来，拔开塞口，用玉簪儿蘸出少许与行者点上，教他不得睁开，宁心睡觉，明早就好。点毕，收了石罐，径领小介们退于里面。八戒解包袱，展开铺盖，请行者安置。行者闭着眼乱摸，八戒笑道：“先生，你的明杖儿呢？”行者道：“你这个馕糟的呆子！你照顾我做瞎子哩！”那呆子哑哑的暗笑而睡。行者坐在铺上，转运神功，直到有三更后，方才睡下。</p>

<p>不觉又是五更将晓，行者抹抹脸，睁开眼道：“果然好药！</p>

<p>比常更有百分光明！”却转头后边望望，呀！那里得甚房舍窗门，但只见些老槐高柳，兄弟们都睡在那绿莎茵上。那八戒醒来道：“哥哥，你嚷怎的？”行者道：“你睁开眼看看。”呆子忽抬头，见没了人家，慌得一毂辘爬将起来道：“我的马哩？”行者道：“树上拴的不是？”“行李呢？”行者道：“你头边放的不是？”</p>

<p>八戒道：“这家子惫懒也。他搬了，怎么就不叫我们一声？通得老猪知道，也好与你送些茶果。想是躲门户的，恐怕里长晓得，却就连夜搬了。噫！我们也忒睡得死！怎么他家拆房子，响也不听见响响？”行者吸吸的笑道：“呆子，不要乱嚷，你看那树上是个甚么纸帖儿。”八戒走上前，用手揭了，原来上面四句颂子云：“庄居非是俗人居，护法伽蓝点化庐。妙药与君医眼痛，尽心降怪莫踌躇。”行者道：“这伙强神，自换了龙马，一向不曾点他，他倒又来弄虚头！”八戒道：“哥哥莫扯架子，他怎么伏你点札？”行者道：“兄弟，你还不知哩。这护教伽蓝、六丁六甲、五方揭谛、四值功曹，奉菩萨的法旨暗保我师父者。自那日报了名，只为这一向有了你，再不曾用他们，故不曾点札罢了。”八戒道：“哥哥，他既奉法旨暗保师父，所以不能现身明显，故此点化仙庄。你莫怪他，昨日也亏他与你点眼，又亏他管了我们一顿斋饭，亦可谓尽心矣。你莫怪他，我们且去救师父来。”行者道：“兄弟说得是。此处到那黄风洞口不远。你且莫动身，只在林子里看马守担，等老孙去洞里打听打听，看师父下落如何，再与他争战。”八戒道：“正是这等，讨一个死活的实信。假若师父死了，各人好寻头干事；若是未死，我们好竭力尽心。”行者道：“莫乱谈，我去也！”</p>

<p>他将身一纵，径到他门首，门尚关着睡觉。行者不叫门，且不惊动妖怪，捻着诀，念个咒语，摇身一变，变做一个花脚蚊虫，真个小巧！有诗为证，诗曰：扰扰微形利喙，嘤嘤声细如雷。</p>

<p>兰房纱帐善通随，正爱炎天暖气。只怕熏烟扑扇，偏怜灯火光辉。轻轻小小忒钻疾，飞入妖精洞里。只见那把门的小妖，正打鼾睡，行者往他脸上叮了一口，那小妖翻身醒了，道：“我爷哑！好大蚊子！一口就叮了一个大疙疸！”忽睁眼道：“天亮了。”</p>

<p>又听得支的一声，二门开了。行者嘤嘤的飞将进去，只见那老妖吩咐各门上谨慎，一壁厢收拾兵器：“只怕昨日那阵风不曾刮死孙行者，他今日必定还来，来时定教他一命休矣。”行者听说，又飞过那厅堂，径来后面。但见层门，关得甚紧，行者漫门缝儿钻将进去，原来是个大空园子，那壁厢定风桩上绳缠索绑着唐僧哩。那师父纷纷泪落，心心只念着悟空、悟能，不知都在何处。行者停翅，叮在他光头上，叫声“师父”。那长老认得他的声音道：“悟空啊，想杀我也！你在那里叫我哩？”行者道：“师父，我在你头上哩。你莫要心焦，少得烦恼，我们务必拿住妖精，方才救得你的性命。”唐僧道：“徒弟啊，几时才拿得妖精么？”行者道：“拿你的那虎怪，已被八戒打死了，只是老妖的风势利害。料着只在今日，管取拿他。你放心莫哭，我去哑。”</p>

<p>说声去，嘤嘤的飞到前面，只见那老妖坐在上面，正点札各路头目。又见那洞前有一个小妖，把个令字旗磨一磨，撞上厅来报道：“大王，小的巡山，才出门，见一个长嘴大耳朵的和尚坐在林里，若不是我跑得快些，几乎被他捉住。却不见昨日那个毛脸和尚。”老妖道：“孙行者不在，想必是风吹死也，再不便去那里求救兵去了！”众妖道：“大王，若果吹杀了他，是我们的造化，只恐吹不死他，他去请些神兵来，却怎生是好？”老妖道：“怕他怎的，怕那甚么神兵！若还定得我的风势，只除了灵吉菩萨来是，其余何足惧也！”行者在屋梁上，只听得他这一句言语，不胜欢喜，即抽身飞出，现本相来至林中，叫声“兄弟！”</p>

<p>八戒道：“哥，你往那里去来？刚才一个打令字旗的妖精，被我赶了去也。”行者笑道：“亏你！亏你！老孙变做蚊虫儿，进他洞去探看师父，原来师父被他绑在定风桩上哭哩。是老孙吩咐，教他莫哭，又飞在屋梁上听了一听。只见那拿令字旗的，喘嘘嘘的，走进去报道：只是被你赶他，却不见我。老妖乱猜乱说，说老孙是风吹杀了，又说是请神兵去了。他却自家供出一个人来，甚妙！甚妙！”八戒道：“他供的是谁？”行者道：“他说怕甚么神兵，那个能定他的风势！只除是灵吉菩萨来是。但不知灵吉住在何处？”</p>

<p>正商议处，只见大路旁走出一个老公公来。你看他怎生模样：身健不扶拐杖，冰髯雪鬓蓬蓬。金花耀眼意朦胧，瘦骨衰筋强硬。屈背低头缓步，庞眉赤脸如童。看他容貌是人称，却似寿星出洞。八戒望见大喜道：“师兄，常言道，要知山下路，须问去来人。你上前问他一声，何如？”真个大圣藏了铁棒，放下衣襟，上前叫道：“老公公，问讯了。”那老者半答不答的，还了个礼道：“你是那里和尚？这旷野处，有何事干？”行者道：“我们是取经的圣僧，昨日在此失了师父，特来动问公公一声，灵吉菩萨在那里住？”老者道：“灵吉在直南上，到那里，还有二千里路。有一山，呼名小须弥山。山中有个道场，乃是菩萨讲经禅院。汝等是取他的经去了？”行者道：“不是取他的经，我有一事烦他，不知从那条路去。”老者用手向南指道：“这条羊肠路就是了。”哄得那孙大圣回头看路，那公公化作清风，寂然不见，只是路旁边下一张简帖，上有四句颂子云：“上复齐天大圣听，老人乃是李长庚。须弥山有飞龙杖，灵吉当年受佛兵。”行者执了帖儿，转身下路。八戒道：“哥啊，我们连日造化低了。这两日忏日里见鬼！那个化风去的老儿是谁？”行者把帖儿递与八戒，念了一遍道：“李长庚是那个？”行者道：“是西方太白金星的名号。”八戒慌得望空下拜道：“恩人！恩人！老猪若不亏金星奏准玉帝呵，性命也不知化作甚的了！”行者道：“兄弟，你却也知感恩。但莫要出头，只藏在这树林深处，仔细看守行李、马匹，等老孙寻须弥山，请菩萨去耶。”八戒道：“晓得！晓得！你只管快快前去！老猪学得个乌龟法，得缩头时且缩头。”</p>

<p>孙大圣跳在空中，纵觔斗云，径往直南上去，果然速快。他点头经过三千里，扭腰八百有余程。须臾见一座高山，半中间有祥云出现，瑞霭纷纷，山凹里果有一座禅院，只听得钟磬悠扬，又见那香烟缥缈。大圣直至门前，见一道人，项挂数珠，口中念佛。行者道：“道人作揖。”那道人躬身答礼道：“那里来的老爷？”行者道：“这可是灵吉菩萨讲经处么？”道人道：“此间正是，有何话说？”行者道：“累烦你老人家与我传答传答：我是东土大唐驾下御弟三藏法师的徒弟，齐天大圣孙悟空行者。今有一事，要见菩萨。”道人笑道：“老爷字多话多，我不能全记。”行者道：“你只说是唐僧徒弟孙悟空来了。”道人依言，上讲堂传报。那菩萨即穿袈裟，添香迎接。</p>

<p>这大圣才举步入门，往里观看，只见那满堂锦绣，一屋威严。众门人齐诵《法华经》，老班首轻敲金铸磬。佛前供养，尽是仙果仙花；案上安排，皆是素肴素品。辉煌宝烛，条条金焰射虹霓；馥郁真香，道道玉烟飞彩雾。正是那讲罢心闲方入定，白云片片绕松梢。静收慧剑魔头绝，般若波罗善会高。那菩萨整衣出迓，行者登堂，坐了客位，随命看茶。行者道：“茶不劳赐，但我师父在黄风山有难，特请菩萨施大法力降怪救师。”菩萨道：“我受了如来法令，在此镇押黄风怪。如来赐了我一颗定风丹，一柄飞龙宝杖。当时被我拿住，饶了他的性命，放他去隐性归山，不许伤生造孽，不知他今日欲害令师，有违教令，我之罪也。”那菩萨欲留行者，治斋相叙，行者恳辞，随取了飞龙杖，与大圣一齐驾云。不多时，至黄风山上。菩萨道：“大圣，这妖怪有些怕我，我只在云端里住定，你下去与他索战，诱他出来，我好施法力。”行者依言，按落云头，不容分说，掣铁棒把他洞门打破，叫道：“妖怪，还我师父来也！”慌得那把门小妖，急忙传报。那怪道：“这泼猴着实无礼！再不伏善，反打破我门！这一出去，使阵神风，定要吹死！”仍前披挂，手绰钢叉，又走出门来，见了行者，更不打话，拈叉当胸就刺。大圣侧身躲过，举棒对面相还。战不数合，那怪吊回头，望巽地上才待要张口呼风，只见那半空里，灵吉菩萨将飞龙宝杖丢将下来，不知念了些甚么咒语，却是一条八爪金龙，拨喇的轮开两爪，一把抓住妖精，提着头，两三捽，捽在山石崖边，现了本相，却是一个黄毛貂鼠。行者赶上举棒就打，被菩萨拦住道：“大圣，莫伤他命，我还要带他去见如来。”对行者道：“他本是灵山脚下的得道老鼠，因为偷了琉璃盏内的清油，灯火昏暗，恐怕金刚拿他，故此走了，却在此处成精作怪。如来照见了他，不该死罪，故着我辖押，但他伤生造孽，拿上灵山；今又冲撞大圣，陷害唐僧，我拿他去见如来，明正其罪，才算这场功绩哩。”行者闻言，却谢了菩萨。菩萨西归不题。</p>

<p>却说猪八戒在那林内，正思量行者，只听得山坂下叫声“悟能兄弟，牵马挑担来耶。”那呆子认得是行者声音，急收拾跑出林外，见了行者道：“哥哥，怎的干事来？”行者道：“请灵吉菩萨使一条飞龙杖，拿住妖精，原来是个黄毛貂鼠成精，被他带去灵山见如来去了。我和你洞里去救师父。”那呆子才欢欢喜喜。二人撞入里面，把那一窝狡兔、妖狐、香獐、角鹿，一顿钉钯铁棒尽情打死，却往后园拜救师父。师父出得门来，问道：</p>

<p>“你两人怎生捉得妖精？如何方救得我？”行者将那请灵吉降妖的事情，陈了一遍，师父谢之不尽。他兄弟们把洞中素物，安排些茶饭吃了，方才出门，找大路向西而去。毕竟不知向后如何，且听下回分解。</p>
