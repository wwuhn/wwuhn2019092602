<P>The Mind-ape is jealous of the Mother of Wood</P>
<P>The Demon Chief Plots to Devour the Master of Dhyana</P>
</div>
<P>The story tells how when the king held his dawn audience the civil and military officials all carried memorials. &#8220;Sovereign Lord,&#8221; they reported, &#8220;we beg you to forgive your servants for their lack of decorum.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; the king replied, &#8220;you are all as courteous as ever. What lack of decorum are you showing?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Sovereign Lord,&#8221; they said, &#8220;we do not know why, but all of your servants lost their hair last night.&#8221; Holding in his hand these memorials about the lost hair, the king descended from his dragon throne to say to the officials, &#8220;Indeed, we do not know why either, but everyone in the palace, young and old, lost their hair last night.&#8221;</P>
<P>King and ministers alike all wept as they said, &#8220;From now on we will not dare kill any more monks.&#8221; The king then returned to his throne and the officials took their places in their proper ranks. The king then said, &#8220;Let those with business here come forward from their ranks to report. If there is no other business the curtain may be rolled up and the audience ended.&#8221;</P>
<P>The commander-in-chief of the capital's garrison then moved forward from the ranks of military officials and the East city commissioner moved forward from the ranks of the civil officials to kowtow at the steps of the throne and report, &#8220;We were patrolling the city on Your Majesty's orders last night when we recaptured a trunk of bandits' booty and a white horse. As we do not dare take unauthorized action over these we beg Your Majesty to issue an edict.&#8221; The king was delighted.</P>
<P>&#8220;Bring it here, trunk and all,&#8221; he ordered.</P>
<P>The two officials then returned to their own offices, mustered a full complement of soldiers and had the trunk carried out. Sanzang, who was inside, felt his soul leaving his body. &#8220;Disciples,&#8221; he said, &#8220;what shall we say in our defense when we reach the king?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Shut up,&#8221; said Monkey with a grin. &#8220;I've fixed everything. When the trunk's opened the king will bow to us as his teachers. The only thing is that Pig mustn't quarrel about precedence.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If they don't kill me that'll be heaven,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;What would I want to quarrel about?&#8221; Before these words were all out of his mouth they had been carried to the palace entrance and in through the Tower of Five Phoenixes to be set at the foot of the steps to the throne.</P>
<P>On being invited by the two officials to have the trunk opened and look inside the king ordered that this be done. No sooner was the lid lifted than Pig, who could restrain himself no longer, sprang outside, giving all the officials such a fright that they shivered, unable to speak. Next Brother Monkey could be seen helping the Tang Priest out, while Friar Sand lifted the luggage out.</P>
<P>Seeing that the commander-in-chief was holding the white horse, Pig went up to him, made an angry noise and said, &#8220;That's my horse. Hand it over!&#8221; This so terrified the official that he collapsed head over heels.</P>
<P>The four pilgrims all stood upright in the middle of the steps, and when the king saw that they were monks he came down at once from his dragon throne, sent for his queen and consorts from the inner quarters, descended the steps of the throne hall, bowed to them along with all his officials and asked, &#8220;What brings you venerable gentlemen here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have been sent by His Majesty the Great Tang Emperor to go to the Great Thunder Monastery in India in the West to worship the living Buddha and fetch the true scriptures,&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Venerable Master,&#8221; the king said, &#8220;you have come from far away. But why did you sleep in this trunk last night?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I knew that Your Majesty had sworn a vow to kill Buddhist monks,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;which is why I did not dare to visit your illustrious country openly, but disguised myself as a layman to arrive late at night to find lodging in one of your inns. We slept in the trunk because we were afraid that our real identity would be discovered. Unfortunately the trunk was stolen by bandits, then brought back here by the commander-in-chief. Now that I have been able to see Your Majesty's dragon countenance, the clouds have cleared away and the sun has come out. I hope that Your Majesty will pardon and release me, ascetic monk that I am: my gratitude will be as deep as the ocean.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Venerable Master,&#8221; the king replied, &#8220;you are a distinguished monk from our suzerain heavenly dynasty. It was wrong of us not to go out to welcome you. For years we have been fulfilling a vow to kill monks because a monk once maligned us. The vow we made to heaven was to kill ten thousand monks to make up a round number. We never imagined that today we would return to the truth and that we would all be turned into monks. Now all of us, king, officials, queen and consorts, have had our hair shaved off. I beg, Venerable Master, that you will not be grudging with your lofty virtue and will take us as your disciples.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Pig heard this he started roaring with laughter: &#8220;If you're going to be our disciples what introductory presents have you got for us?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you will accept us as your follower, Master,&#8221; the king replied, &#8220;we will present you with all the wealth in our kingdom.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't talk about wealth to us,&#8221; said Brother Monkey, &#8220;as we're proper monks. As long as you inspect and return our passport and escort us out of the city I can guarantee that your monarchy will last for ever and that you will enjoy a long and happy life.&#8221; On hearing this the king ordered his office of foreign relations to arrange a great feast at which monarch and officials together returned to the one truth. The passport was immediately inspected and returned, after which Sanzang was asked to change the name of the country.</P>
<P>&#8220;'Dharma' in the name of Your Majesty's country is excellent,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;but the 'destructia' part is nonsense. Now that we've come here you should change the name to 'Dharmarespectia'. This would guarantee</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Clear waters and victory for a thousand generations;</P>
<P>Timely winds and rain with universal peace.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The king thanked them for their gracious kindness, had the royal carriage prepared and escorted the Tang Priest and his three disciples Westwards out of the city.</P>
<P>We will say no more of how monarch and subjects now held to the true faith, but tell how after leaving the king of Dharmarespectia the venerable elder said happily from on his horse, &#8220;What excellent magic you used, Wukong. It worked very well.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Elder brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;where did you find so many barbers to shave all those heads in one night?&#8221; Monkey then told them all about how he had used his miraculous powers, at which they all laughed so much they could not stop.</P>
<P>Just as they were feeling so cheerful a great mountain came into view, blocking their way. Reining in the horse, the Tang Priest said, &#8220;Disciples, see how high that mountain is. You must be very careful.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry,&#8221; said Monkey with a grin, &#8220;don't worry. I promise you nothing will go wrong.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't say that,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;I can see those jutting peaks, and even from a distance it looks rather sinister. Storm clouds are streaming from it, and I am beginning to feel frightened. My whole body is turning numb and my spirits are disturbed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You have already forgotten the<I> Heart Sutra</I> that the Rook's Nest Hermit taught you,&#8221; said Brother Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;I can still remember it,&#8221; Sanzang said.</P>
<P>&#8220;Even if you can still remember that,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;there is a quatrain that you've forgotten.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What quatrain?&#8221; Sanzang asked, to which Monkey replied,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do not go far to seek the Buddha on Vulture Peak;</P>
<P>Vulture Peak is in your heart.</P>
<P>Everybody has a Vulture Peak stupa</P>
<P>Under which to cultivate conduct.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Of course I know it, disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;According to that quatrain the thousands of scriptures all come down to cultivating the heart.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Goes without saying,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;When the heart is purified it can shine alone;</P>
<P>When the heart is preserved all perceptions are pure.</P>
<P>If there is any mistake then laziness follows,</P>
<P>And success will not come in a myriad years.</P>
<P>As long as your will is sincere Thunder Peak is before your eyes.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>But if you're as scared, frightened and disturbed as this the Great Way is distant, and Thunder Peak is far, far away. Forget those wild fears and come with me.&#8221; When the venerable elder heard this his spirits were revived and his worries disappeared.</P>
<P>The four of them had only gone a few more steps when they reached the mountain. When they raised their eyes this was what they saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A fine mountain,</P>
<P>Dappled with many colours.</P>
<P>White clouds drifted around the peak,</P>
<P>And cool were the shadows of the trees in front of the cliff.</P>
<P>The birds rustled in the leaves,</P>
<P>The beasts were ferocious.</P>
<P>Among the woods were a thousand pines,</P>
<P>On the ridge a few bamboos.</P>
<P>Howls came from gray wolves seizing their prey,</P>
<P>And roars from hungry tigers fighting over food.</P>
<P>Long screamed the wild apes searching for fruit;</P>
<P>The David's-deer climbed through blossoms into mists of green.</P>
<P>The wind was blowing,</P>
<P>The waters babbled,</P>
<P>And hidden birds sang in the deserted pass.</P>
<P>Here and there wisteria was climbing</P>
<P>While rare flowers bloomed by the stream amid orchids.</P>
<P>Intricately shaped and strange were the rocks,</P>
<P>And sheer rose the crags.</P>
<P>Foxes and raccoon-dogs ran in packs;</P>
<P>Badgers and apes were playing in groups.</P>
<P>The travelers were worried by so high and steep a mountain:</P>
<P>Why was the ancient track so twisted?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>While master and disciples were moving timidly ahead they heard the howling of a wind. &#8220;There's a wind,&#8221; said Sanzang in fear.</P>
<P>&#8220;In the spring there are mild winds,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;in the summer hot ones, in the autumn golden ones and in the winter North winds. There are winds in all four seasons. What's so frightening about a wind?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This wind is blowing very hard,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;It is definitely not a wind from heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But winds always come from the earth and clouds from mountains,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;so how could there be a wind from heaven?&#8221; Before he had finished speaking a mist arose. That mist really was</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Darkness joining up with the sky,</P>
<P>Obscurity making the whole earth dim.</P>
<P>The sun had completely vanished from sight</P>
<P>And no bird sang.</P>
<P>All was as indistinct as primal chaos,</P>
<P>And the air seemed filled with flying dust.</P>
<P>The trees on the mountain could not be seen</P>
<P>Where had the herb-gatherers gone?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said Sanzang in fright, &#8220;why is there this mist when the wind is still blowing?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't get upset,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Get off your horse, Master. I'll go and see whether or not it's sinister while you two keep guard, brothers.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage needed only to bow in order to be in mid-air. Holding his hand to his brow for shade, he opened his fiery eyes wide and looked down to see an evil spirit sitting at the foot of a beetling scar. Just look and see what he was like:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A mighty body full of charm,</P>
<P>A heroic manner of great vigor.</P>
<P>The fangs protruding from his mouth were drills of steel;</P>
<P>His nose hung like a jade hook in the middle.</P>
<P>His golden eyes with pupils round gave animals a fright;</P>
<P>Demons and gods were scared of his bristling silver whiskers.</P>
<P>He sat upright by the cliff in terrible might,</P>
<P>Making the mist and wind as he hatched his plot.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On either side of him some thirty or forty junior demons could be seen, all drawn up in line and blowing out mist and wind for all they were worth. Monkey grinned at this and thought, &#8220;So my master is clairvoyant. He said it wasn't a heavenly wind, and it was in fact caused by this evil spirit trying to fool us. Now if I went straight down and hit him with what they call a 'garlicsmasher' that'd kill him sure enough, but it would ruin my reputation.&#8221; Monkey had been a true hero all his life and was quite incapable of playing a dirty trick like that.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'd better go back and give Pig some attention. I'll ask him to hit the evil spirit first. If Pig's good enough to kill the evil spirit we'll be in luck. If he isn't and the evil spirit captures him I can come back to rescue him and win myself a bit of fame. He's always putting on such an act and being so lazy&#8212;he won't make an effort. Still, he is very greedy and partial to a good feed. I think I'll try a trick on him and see how that works.&#8221;</P>
<P>At once he brought his cloud down to land in front of Sanzang, who asked, &#8220;Are the wind and the mist sinister or not?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's clear now,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;They've gone.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;they have eased off a little.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile, &#8220;my eyesight is very good usually, but this time I was wrong. I thought there'd probably be a monster behind that wind and mist but there wasn't.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What caused them then?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;There's a village not far ahead,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;where the people are so pious that they're steaming white rice and white breadrolls to feed monks with. I think that the mist must have been steam escaping from their steamers. It was the result of their goodness.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Pig heard this he thought Monkey was telling the truth, so he grabbed hold of him and whispered, &#8220;Did you eat their food before you came back?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Only a bit,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;The vegetable dishes were too salty&#8212;I didn't want to eat too much.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Screw that,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;I'd eat my fill of it however salty it was. If it made me really thirsty I'd come back for a drink of water.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Would you like some?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Sure thing,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;I'm hungry and I'd like some now. What do you think?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You mustn't even talk about it,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;As the ancient book says, 'When the father is present the son must do nothing on his own account.' Our master, who's as good as a father to you, is here, so none of us should dare go ahead.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you'll say nothing about it, I'm going,&#8221; replied Pig with a grin.</P>
<P>&#8220;Let's see how you do it,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;I'll say nothing.&#8221; When it came to eating the idiot knew a thing or two.</P>
<P>He went up to his master, made a loud &#8220;na-a-aw&#8221; of respect, and said, &#8220;Master, elder brother has just told me that there are people in a village ahead of us who feed monks. Just look at that horse. It looks as though it's going to start playing it up. We'll be causing a lot of trouble if we have to ask for grass and other fodder for it. Luckily the wind and the clouds have gone now, so why don't you all sit here for a while while I fetch some tender grass? We can go and beg for food from that house when we've fed the horse.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Splendid,&#8221; said the Tang Priest with delight. &#8220;I wondered why you've become so hardworking today. Be as quick as you can.&#8221;</P>
<P>Smiling secretly to himself the idiot started out. &#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Monkey, catching up and grabbing hold of him, &#8220;they feed monks all right, but only good-looking ones.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case I'll have to change again,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Brother Monkey, &#8220;you change.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid idiot, who could perform thirty-six transformations, went into a hollow on the mountainside, made a spell with his hands, said the magic words, shook himself and turned himself into a short, skinny monk, beating a wooden fish-shaped dram with his hand and mumbling, &#8220;Oh great one, oh great one,&#8221; because he knew no scriptures to recite.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After putting away the wind and the mist the evil spirit ordered all his devils to form a circle round the main road, ready for any travelers. The idiot's luck was out, and he was soon inside the trap and surrounded by the devils, who grabbed at his clothes and his silken sash as they all crowded in on him together.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't pull,&#8221; Pig said. &#8220;You can let me eat in all your houses in turn.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you want to eat, monk?&#8221; the devils asked. &#8220;You feed monks here,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;and I've come to be fed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So you're hoping to be fed, are you, monk?&#8221; said the demons. &#8220;You don't seem to realize that what we like doing best here is eating monks. We're all evil immortals who've found the Way here in the mountains, and the only thing we want to do is to catch you monks, take you home with us, pop you in the steamer till you're tender and eat you. And you're still hoping for a vegetarian meal!&#8221;</P>
<P>At this Pig's heart was filled with terror, and he started complaining about Monkey. &#8220;That Protector of the Horses is a crook. He lied to me about them feeding monks in this village. There aren't any villagers here and there's nobody who feeds monks. They're all evil spirits.&#8221; The idiot was being tugged at so hard that he turned back into himself, pulled the rake out from his belt and struck out wildly, driving all the junior devils back.</P>
<P>They rushed back to report to the senior demon, &#8220;Disaster, Your Majesty.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What disaster?&#8221; the senior demon asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;A neat-looking monk came along in front of the mountain,&#8221; they replied, &#8220;so we decided to catch him and steam him. We were going to keep what we couldn't eat now for a bad day. Then to our astonishment he transformed himself.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What did he turn himself into?&#8221; the senior demon asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Not into anything human,&#8221; they replied. &#8220;He's got a long snout, big ears, and a bristly mane on his back. He lashed out furiously at us with a rake that he used two-handed. He gave us such a terrible fright that we've run straight back to report to Your Majesty.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be afraid,&#8221; the senior demon said. &#8220;Let me go and have a look.&#8221; Swinging his iron mace he went up for a closer look and saw that the idiot really was hideous. This is what he looked like:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A snout like a husking hammer over three feet long;</P>
<P>Tusks like silver nails protruding from his mouth.</P>
<P>Two round eyes that flashed like lightning;</P>
<P>A pair of ears that made a howling wind when they flapped.</P>
<P>The bristles behind his head were rows of iron arrows;</P>
<P>All of his hide was rough and green and scabby.</P>
<P>In his hands he held an amazing object:</P>
<P>A nine-toothed rake of which everyone was afraid.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Summoning up his courage, the evil spirit shouted, &#8220;Where are you from? What's your name? Tell me at once and I'll spare your life.&#8221;</P>
<P>To this Pig replied with a laugh, &#8220;So you can't recognize your own ancestor Pig either, my boy. Come closer and I'll tell you:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>For my huge mouth and tusks and mighty powers</P>
<P>I was made Marshal Tian Peng by the Jade Emperor,</P>
<P>Commanding eighty thousand marines on the River of Heaven,</P>
<P>And happy amid all the joys of the heavenly palace.</P>
<P>Because when drunk I fluted with a palace lady</P>
<P>I decided to play the hero for a while.</P>
<P>One butt from my snout destroyed the Dipper and Bull Palace;</P>
<P>I ate the magic mushrooms of the Queen Mother of the West.</P>
<P>The Jade Emperor himself gave me two thousand hammer-blows,</P>
<P>Made me an exile from the world of Heaven.</P>
<P>This made me determined to nourish my spirit,</P>
<P>And become an evil monster in the lower world.</P>
<P>Just when I had made a good marriage in Gao Village</P>
<P>Fate brought me up against my brother Monkey.</P>
<P>He subdued me with his gold-banded cudgel;</P>
<P>I was forced to bow my head and enter the Buddhist faith.</P>
<P>I do the heavy work, saddle the horse and carry luggage:</P>
<P>I must have been the Tang Priest's debtor in an earlier life.</P>
<P>As the iron-footed Marshal Tian Peng my surname was Zhu;</P>
<P>My name as a Buddhist is Zhu Bajie.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the evil spirit heard this he shouted, &#8220;So you're the Tang Priest's disciple. I've long heard that his flesh is very tasty. You're one of the people I most want to catch. I'm not going to spare you now you've fallen into my clutches. Stay where you are, and take this from my mace.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Evil beast,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;You must have been a dyer before.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean, I must have been a dyer?&#8221; the evil spirit asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you weren't a dyer, how come you know how to use a pestle?&#8221; Pig retorted, and with no further argument the monster was upon him, striking furiously. They fought a fine battle in the mountain hollow:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A nine-toothed rake,</P>
<P>An iron mace.</P>
<P>As the rake went through its movements they were like a howling gale;</P>
<P>The mace's skilful blows came as thick and fast as rain.</P>
<P>One was an unknown ogre blocking the mountain road;</P>
<P>The other was the offending Tian Peng now guarding his true nature's master.</P>
<P>When one's nature is right monsters cause no fear;</P>
<P>When the mountain is high earth cannot come from metal.</P>
<P>One fought with his mace like a python from a pool;</P>
<P>The other's rake was like a dragon from the waters.</P>
<P>Their angry shouts shook mountains and rivers;</P>
<P>Their mighty roars caused terror down in hell.</P>
<P>Each of the heroes displayed his prowess,</P>
<P>Staking his life on his magical powers.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We will say no more of how Pig set a mighty wind blowing as he fought the evil spirit, who ordered his junior devils to keep Pig surrounded. Instead the story tells how Brother Monkey suddenly gave a bitter laugh behind the Tang Priest's back.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why are you laughing like that, elder brother?&#8221; Friar Sand asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Pig really is an idiot,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;As soon as he heard that they feed monks there he fell for my trick. He's been away a long time now. If he'd beaten the evil spirit with a single blow of his rake you'd have seen him coming back in triumph by now, loudly insisting on his great victory. But if the demon's been too much for him and captured him my luck's out. Goodness only knows how often he'll have cursed the Protector of the Horses behind my back. Say nothing while I go to take a look around, Wujing.&#8221;</P>
<P>With that the splendid Great Sage, who did not want the venerable elder to know what was happening, quietly pulled a hair out of the back of his head, blew on it with magic breath, said &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned it into his own double to stay with the master together with Friar Sand. Then his real self disappeared as he leapt up into the air to look around. He saw the idiot lashing out wildly with his rake at the devils who were surrounding him and gradually getting the better of him.</P>
<P>This was more than Monkey could bear. Bringing his cloud down to land, he shouted at the top of his voice, &#8220;Take it easy, Pig. Monkey's here.&#8221; Recognizing that it was Monkey's voice gave the idiot a chance to be more ferocious than ever as he hit wildly forward with his rake. The evil spirit was no match for him.</P>
<P>&#8220;You weren't up to much before, monk,&#8221; he said, &#8220;so how come you're so fierce now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You'd better stop bullying me now, my lad,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;I've got one of my people here now.&#8221; A moment later he was swinging wildly again with the rake. The evil spirit, unable to stave off the blows, led his devils away in defeat. As soon as Monkey saw that the devils had been beaten he drew no closer but went straight back on his cloud, shook the hair and put it back on his body. With his mortal, fleshly eyes the Tang Priest noticed nothing of this.</P>
<P>Before long a triumphant Pig returned too, so exhausted that his nose was dripping with snot as he foamed at the mouth and was panting loudly. &#8220;Master!&#8221; he called.</P>
<P>When the Tang Priest saw him he exclaimed in astonishment, &#8220;Pig, you went to fetch some grass for the horse. Why have you come back in so terrible a state? Were there watchmen on the mountain who wouldn't let you cut any?&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot flung his rake down, beat his chest and stamped his feet as he replied, &#8220;Don't ask me about it, Master. If I had to tell you I'd die of shame.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What would you be so ashamed of?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Elder brother tricked me,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;He told me that it wasn't an evil spirit behind that wind and mist. He said there was nothing sinister about it, but that it was from a village where the people were so pious that they were steaming white rice and breadrolls made with white flour to feed monks with. I believed him. As I was so hungry I thought I'd go ahead to beg for some. Fetching grass for the horse was only an excuse. I never expected to be surrounded by a crowd of evil spirits. They gave me a hard fight, and if Monkey hadn't helped me out with his mourner's staff I'd have had no hope of escaping and getting back here.&#8221;</P>
<P>'The idiot's talking nonsense,&#8221; said Monkey, who was standing beside them, with a smile. &#8220;If you've taken to robbery you're trying to get a whole gaolful of people into trouble. I've been looking after the master here. I've never left his side.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It is true,&#8221; Sanzang said, &#8220;Wukong has never left my side.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot then sprang up shouting, &#8220;You don't understand, Master. He's got a double.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Is there really a monster there, Wukong?&#8221; Sanzang asked. Monkey could keep his deception up no longer.</P>
<P>&#8220;There are a few little devils,&#8221; Monkey replied with a bow and a smile, &#8220;but they won't dare give us any trouble. Come here, Pig. I'm going to look after you. We're going to escort the master along this steep mountain path as if we were an army on the march.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;You'll be the commander of the vanguard,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;going in front and clearing the way. If the evil spirit doesn't show up again that will be that; but if he does, you fight him. When you beat the evil spirit that'll be something to your credit.&#8221;</P>
<P>Reckoning that the evil spirit's powers were much the same as his own, Pig said, &#8220;Very well then. I'm ready to die at his hands. I'll take the lead.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Idiot,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;if you start by saying such unlucky things you'll never get anywhere.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As you know, brother,&#8221; Pig replied,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;When a gentleman goes to a banquet</P>
<P>He gets either drunk or well filled;</P>
<P>When a hero goes into a battle</P>
<P>He gets either wounded or killed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>By saying something unlucky first I'll make myself stronger later.&#8221; This delighted Monkey, who saddled the horse and invited the master to ride while Friar Sand carried the luggage as they all followed Pig into the mountains.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The evil spirit meanwhile led a few of his underlings who had survived the rout straight back to his cave, where he sat brooding in silence high up above a rocky precipice. Many of the junior devils who looked after things in his household came up to him and asked, &#8220;Why are you so miserable today, Your Majesty? You're usually in-such high spirits when you come back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Little ones,&#8221; said the demon king, &#8220;usually when I go out to patrol the mountains I can be sure of bringing home a few people or animals I've caught to feed you with. Today my luck was out: I've met my match.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Who?&#8221; the junior devils asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;A monk,&#8221; the demon king replied, &#8220;a disciple of the Tang Priest from the East who's going to fetch the scriptures. He's called Zhu Bajie. He went for me so hard with his rake that he beat me. I had to run away. I'm thoroughly fed up. For ages now I've heard it said that the Tang Priest is an arhat who has cultivated his conduct for ten successive lifetimes. Anyone who eats a piece of his flesh will live for ever. To my surprise he's come to my mountain today, and it would have been an ideal time to catch him, cook him and eat him. I never realized he'd have a disciple like that one.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before he had finished saying this a junior devil slipped forward from the ranks. First he gave three sobs in front of the demon king, then three laughs.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why sob then laugh?&#8221; shouted the demon king.</P>
<P>The junior devil fell to his knees as he replied, &#8220;Because Your Majesty just said that you wanted to eat the Tang Priest. His flesh isn't worth eating.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But everyone says that a piece of his flesh will make you live as long as the heavens,&#8221; said the demon king. &#8220;How can you say that it's not worth eating?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If he were so good to eat,&#8221; the junior devil replied, &#8220;he'd never have got this far. Other demons would have eaten him up. And he's got three disciples with him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do you know who?&#8221; the demon king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The senior disciple is Sun the Novice,&#8221; said the junior devil, &#8220;and the third disciple is Friar Sand. The one you met must have been his second disciple Zhu Bajie.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How does Friar Sand compare with Zhu Bajie?&#8221; asked the demon king.</P>
<P>&#8220;He's much the same,&#8221; the junior devil said,</P>
<P>&#8220;What about Sun the Novice?&#8221; the demon king asked, at which the junior devil thrust out his tongue in horror and replied, &#8220;I daren't tell you. That Monkey has tremendous magic powers and can do all sorts of transformations. Five hundred years ago he made terrible havoc in heaven. None of the heavenly warriors dared give him any trouble, from the Twenty-eight Constellations, the Star Lords of the Nine Bright Shiners, the Gods of the Twelve Branches, the Five Officers and the Four Ministers, the East and West Dippers and the Gods of the North and the South, to the Five Peaks and the Four Rivers. How can you have the nerve to want to eat the Tang Priest?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How do you know so much about him?&#8221; the demon king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I used to live in the Lion Cave of the demon king on Lion Ridge,&#8221; the junior devil replied. &#8220;He was reckless enough to want to eat the Tang Priest, and that Sun the Novice smashed his way in through the gates with his gold-banded cudgel. It was terrible. They were wiped out. Luckily I had enough sense to escape by the back door and come here, where Your Majesty allowed me to stay. That's how I know about his powers.&#8221;</P>
<P>The senior demon turned pale with shock when he heard this: it was a case of the commander-in-chief being afraid of the soothsayer's words. How could he help being alarmed when he heard all this from one of his own people? Just when they were all feeling terrified another junior devil stepped forward and said, &#8220;Don't be so upset and afraid, Your Majesty. As the saying goes, easy does it. If you want to catch the Tang Priest let me make you a plan to capture him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What plan?&#8221; the senior demon asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I have a plan to 'divide the petals of the plum blossom.'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean by 'dividing the petals of the plum blossom?'&#8220; the demon king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Call the roll of all the devils in the cave,&#8221; the junior devil replied. &#8220;Choose the best hundred from all thousand of them, then the best ten out of that hundred, and finally the best three out of the ten. They must be capable and good at transformations. Have them all turn into Your Majesty's doubles, wear Your Majesty's helmet and armor, carry Your Majesty's mace, and lie in wait in three different places. First send one out to fight Zhu Bajie, then one to fight Sun the Novice and finally one to fight Friar Sand. This way you'll only have to spare three junior devils to draw the three disciples away. Then Your Majesty will be able to stretch down from mid-air with your cloud-grabbing hand to catch the Tang Priest. He'll be in the bag. It'll be as easy as catching flies in a dish of fish juice. Nothing to it.&#8221;</P>
<P>This suggestion delighted the demon king, who said, &#8220;What a brilliant plan, brilliant! If I don't catch the Tang Priest this way, that'll be that. But if I do I can assure you you'll be richly rewarded. I'll make you commander of the vanguard.&#8221; The junior devil kowtowed to thank him for his grace and went off to call the roll of the devils. After all the monsters in the cave had been carefully checked through, three capable junior devils were selected. They turned into the senior devil's doubles and went to lie in wait for the Tang Priest with their iron maces.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The venerable Tang elder meanwhile was following Pig along the way without a care in the world. When they had been going for some time there was a crashing sound from beside the track and out leapt a junior devil who rushed straight at them, evidently to grab Sanzang. &#8220;The evil spirit's here, Pig,&#8221; Monkey shouted. &#8220;Get him!&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot, who was taken in by the imposture, hacked wildly at the devil with his rake. The evil spirit parried Pig's blows with his mace as he met the onslaught. While the battle between the pair of them ebbed and flowed on the mountainside there was a noise in the undergrowth as another monster sprang out and charged at the Tang Priest.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is bad, Master,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Pig can't see straight. He's let the monster escape to catch you. I'm going to fight him.&#8221; Pulling his cudgel out in a flash, he went up to the monster, shouting, &#8220;Where d'you think you're going? Take this!&#8221;</P>
<P>Without saying a word the evil spirit raised his mace to meet the attack. But while the two of them were locked in combat, swinging at each other, there was a howling wind from the other side of the mountain and a third evil spirit sprang out who also rushed straight at the Tang Priest. When Friar Sand saw it he exclaimed in alarm, &#8220;Master, big brother and second brother both can't see straight. They've let the evil spirit get away to catch you. Stay on the horse while I get him.&#8221;</P>
<P>Friar Sand was taken in too. Brandishing his staff he blocked the evil spirit's iron mace and started a bitter combat. It was a wild fight with shouts and awful yells, and they drew further and further away. When the demon king saw from up in the sky that the Tang Priest was alone on the horse he reached down with his five-clawed steel hook and seized him. The master lost horse and stirrups as the evil spirit carried him off in a gust of wind. Alas! This was a case of</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the dhyana-nature encountered a monster the true achievement was hard;</P>
<P>The monk of the river current met once more with a star of disaster.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Bringing his wind down to land, the demon king took the Tang Priest into the cave and called, &#8220;Commander of the vanguard!&#8221;</P>
<P>The junior devil who had made the plan came forward, knelt and said, &#8220;I am not worthy.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you say that?&#8221; the demon king replied. &#8220;Once the commander-in-chief has spoken, white becomes black. What I said before was that if I failed to catch the Tang Priest, that would be that; but that if I succeeded I'd make you my commander of the vanguard. Your brilliant plan has succeeded today, so there is no reason why I should break faith with you. Bring the Tang Priest here and tell the underlings to fetch water, scrub the cooking pot, fetch some firewood and light the fire. When he's been steamed you and I will each have a piece of his flesh and live for ever.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; the commander of the vanguard replied, &#8220;he mustn't be eaten yet.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why ever not?&#8221; the demon king asked. &#8220;We've captured him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It wouldn't matter if you ate him, Your Majesty,&#8221; said the commander of the vanguard, &#8220;as far as Zhu Bajie and Friar Sand are concerned. They would be reasonable. But I'm worried about that Sun the Novice: he'd be really vicious. If he found out we'd eaten the Tang Priest he wouldn't come to give us a straight fight. He'd just thrust that gold-banded cudgel of his into the mountainside and make a hole so big that the whole mountain would collapse. We'd be homeless.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you suggest, commander of the vanguard?&#8221; the demon king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;In my opinion,&#8221; the commander replied, &#8220;we should send the Tang Priest out to the back garden, tie him to a tree, and starve him for two or three days. That will clean him up inside and let us make sure that the three disciples don't come here looking for him. Once we've found out that they've gone home we can bring the Tang Priest out and enjoy him at our leisure. That'd be better, wouldn't it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; the senior demon said with a laugh. &#8220;You're right, commander of the vanguard.&#8221;</P>
<P>An order was issued and the Tang Priest taken into the back garden to be roped to a tree, while all the junior devils went out to the front to keep watch. Look at the venerable elder as he suffers in his bonds, tied up tightly and unable to stop the tears rolling down his cheeks.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciples,&#8221; he called, &#8220;where did you chase those demons to when you went to capture them in the mountains? I have been captured by a wicked ogre and have met with disaster. When will I ever see you again? The pain is killing me.&#8221;</P>
<P>Just when the tears from both eyes were joining in a single stream he heard someone calling from a tree opposite, &#8220;Venerable elder, you're here too.&#8221;</P>
<P>Taking control of himself, the Tang Priest asked, &#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm a woodcutter who lives on this mountain,&#8221; the other replied. &#8220;I've been tied up here for three days. I reckon they're going to eat me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Woodcutter,&#8221; said the Tang Priest with tears in his eyes, &#8220;If you die it will only be you. You have nothing else to worry about. But if I die it won't be a clean end.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean, it won't be a clean end, venerable elder?&#8221; the woodcutter asked. &#8220;You have no parents, wife or children, so if you die that'll be that.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am from the East,&#8221; the Tang Priest replied, &#8220;and was going to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven. I was going on the orders of Emperor Taizong of the Tang to worship the living Buddha and fetch the true scriptures. This was to save all the lonely souls in the underworld who have nobody to care for them. If I lose my life today the vain waiting will kill my sovereign and I will let down his ministers. Countless wronged souls in the City of the Unjustly Slain will suffer a terrible disappointment and never ever be able to escape from the wheel of life. The true achievement will all be turned to dust in the wind. How can that possibly be considered a clean end?&#8221;</P>
<P>When the woodcutter heard this the tears fell from his eyes as he said, &#8220;If you die that is all there to it. But my death will be even more painful for me to bear. I lost my father when I was a boy, and live alone with my mother. Because we had no property I have had to make our living as a woodcutter. My aged mother is eighty-two this year and I am her only support. If I die who will there be to bury her? It's very hard to bear: the pain of it is killing me.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the venerable elder heard this he began to wail aloud, &#8220;Oh dear, oh dear,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Even the mountain man thinks of his mother;</P>
<P>I am reciting the sutras in vain.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Serving one's monarch and serving one's parents are both the same in principle. You are moved by your mother's goodness to you and I by my sovereign lord's goodness to me.&#8221; This was indeed a case of</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Weeping eyes looking at eyes that weep,</P>
<P>A heartbroken one who sees off one with a broken heart.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>But we will say no more of Sanzang's sufferings as we return to Monkey, who after driving the junior devil back down the grassy slope rushed back to the track to find that his master had disappeared. All that was left were the white horse and the luggage. In his alarm he led the horse and shouldered the carrying-pole as he headed for the top of the mountain in his search for the master. Oh dear! Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The long-suffering monk of the river current had met with new suffering;</P>
<P>The Great Sage, subduer of demons, had run into a demon.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you do not know how his search for his master ended, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>心猿妒木母</p>
<p>魔主计吞禅</p>
</div>
<p>话说那国王早朝，文武多官俱执表章启奏道：“主公，望赦臣等失仪之罪。”国王道：“众卿礼貌如常，有何失仪？”众卿道：</p>

<p>“主公啊，不知何故，臣等一夜把头发都没了。”国王执了这没头发之表，下龙床对群臣道：“果然不知何故，朕宫中大小人等，一夜也尽没了头发。”君臣们都各汪汪滴泪道：“从此后，再不敢杀戮和尚也。”王复上龙位，众官各立本班。王又道：“有事出班来奏，无事卷帘散朝。”只见那武班中闪出巡城总兵官，文班中走出东城兵马使，当阶叩头道：“臣蒙圣旨巡城，夜来获得贼赃一柜，白马一匹。微臣不敢擅专，请旨定夺。”国王大喜道：</p>

<p>“连柜取来。”二臣即退至本衙，点起齐整军士，将柜抬出。三藏在内，魂不附体道：“徒弟们，这一到国王前，如何理说？”行者笑道：“莫嚷！我已打点停当了。开柜时，他就拜我们为师哩，只教八戒不要争竞长短。”八戒道：“但只免杀，就是无量之福，还敢争竞哩！”说不了，抬至朝外，入五凤楼，放在丹墀之下。二臣请国王开看，国王即命打开。方揭了盖，猪八戒就忍不住往外一跳，唬得那多官胆战，口不能言，又见孙行者搀出唐僧，沙和尚搬出行李。八戒见总兵官牵着马，走上前，咄的一声道：</p>

<p>“马是我的！拿过来！”吓得那官儿翻跟头，跌倒在地。四众俱立在阶中。那国王看见是四个和尚，忙下龙床，宣召三宫妃后，下金銮宝殿，同群臣拜问道：“长老何来？”三藏道：“是东土大唐驾下差往西方天竺国大雷音寺拜活佛取真经的。”国王道：</p>

<p>“老师远来，为何在这柜里安歇？”三藏道：“贫僧知陛下有愿心杀和尚，不敢明投上国，扮俗人，夜至宝方饭店里借宿。因怕人识破原身，故此在柜中安歇。不幸被贼偷出，被总兵捉获抬来，今得见陛下龙颜，所谓拨云见日。望陛下赦放贫僧，海深恩便也！”国王道：“老师是天朝上国高僧，朕失迎迓。朕常年有愿杀僧者，曾因僧谤了朕，朕许天愿，要杀一万和尚做圆满。不期今夜皈依，教朕等为僧。如今君臣后妃，发都剃落了，望老师勿吝高贤，愿为门下。”八戒听言，呵呵大笑道：“既要拜为门徒，有何贽见之礼？”国王道：“师若肯从，愿将国中财宝献上。”行者道：“莫说财宝，我和尚是有道之僧。你只把关文倒换了，送我们出城，保你皇图永固，福寿长臻。”那国王听说，即着光禄寺大排筵宴，君臣合同，拜归于一，即时倒换关文，求三藏改换国号。行者道：“陛下法国之名甚好，但只灭字不通，自经我过，可改号钦法国，管教你海晏河清千代胜，风调雨顺万方安。”国王谢了恩，摆整朝銮驾，送唐僧四众出城西去。君臣们秉善归真不题。</p>

<p>却说长老辞别了钦法国王，在马上欣然道：“悟空，此一法甚善，大有功也。”沙僧道：“哥啊，是那里寻这许多整容匠，连夜剃这许多头？”行者把那施变化弄神通的事说了一遍，师徒们都笑不合口。正欢喜处，忽见一座高山阻路，唐僧勒马道：(奇*书*网^.^整*理*提*供)</p>

<p>“徒弟们，你看这面前山势崔巍，切须仔细！”行者笑道：“放心！</p>

<p>放心！保你无事！”三藏道：“休言无事。我见那山峰挺立，远远的有些凶气，暴云飞出，渐觉惊煌，满身麻木，神思不安。”行者笑道：“你把乌巢禅师的《多心经》早已忘了？”三藏道：“我记得。”行者道：“你虽记得，还有四句颂子，你却忘了哩。”三藏道：“那四句？”行者道：“佛在灵山莫远求，灵山只在汝心头。人人有个灵山塔，好向灵山塔下修。”三藏道：“徒弟，我岂不知？</p>

<p>若依此四句，千经万典，也只是修心。”行者道：“不消说了，心净孤明独照，心存万境皆清。差错些儿成惰懈，千年万载不成功。但要一片志诚，雷音只在眼下。似你这般恐惧惊惶，神思不安，大道远矣，雷音亦远矣。且莫胡疑，随我去。”那长老闻言，心神顿爽，万虑皆休。</p>

<p>四众一同前进。不几步，到于山上，举目看时：那山真好山，细看色班班。顶上云飘荡，崖前树影寒。飞禽淅沥，走兽凶顽。林内松千干，峦头竹几竿。吼叫是苍狼夺食，咆哮是饿虎争餐。野猿长啸寻鲜果，麋鹿攀花上翠岚。风洒洒，水潺潺，时闻幽鸟语间关。几处藤萝牵又扯，满溪瑶草杂香兰。磷磷怪石，削削峰岩。狐狢成群走，猴猿作队顽。行客正愁多险峻，奈何古道又湾还！师徒们怯怯惊惊，正行之时，只听得呼呼一阵风起。三藏害怕道：“风起了！”行者道：“春有和风，夏有熏风，秋有金风，冬有朔风：四时皆有风，风起怕怎的？”三藏道：“这风来得甚急，决然不是天风。”行者道：“自古来，风从地起，云自山出，怎么得个天风？”说不了，又见一阵雾起。那雾真个是：漠漠连天暗，蒙蒙匝地昏。日色全无影，鸟声无处闻。宛然如混沌，仿佛似飞尘。不见山头树，那逢采药人？三藏一发心惊道：</p>

<p>“悟空，风还未定，如何又这般雾起？”行者道：“且莫忙，请师父下马，你兄弟二个在此保守，等我去看看是何吉凶。”</p>

<p>好大圣，把腰一躬就到半空，用手搭在眉上，圆睁火眼，向下观之，果见那悬岩边坐着一个妖精。你看他怎生模样：炳炳文斑多采艳，昂昂雄势甚抖擞。坚牙出口如钢钻，利爪藏蹄似玉钩。金眼圆睛禽兽怕，银须倒竖鬼神愁。张狂哮吼施威猛，嗳雾喷风运智谋。又见那左右手下有三四十个小妖摆列，他在那里逼法的喷风嗳雾。行者暗笑道：“我师父也有些儿先兆。他说不是天风，果然不是，却是个妖精在这里弄喧儿哩。若老孙使铁棒往下就打，这叫做捣蒜打，打便打死了，只是坏了老孙的名头。”那行者一生豪杰，再不晓得暗算计人。他道：“我且回去，照顾猪八戒照顾，教他来先与这妖精见一仗。若是八戒有本事，打倒这妖，算他一功；若无手段，被这妖拿去，等我再去救他，才好出名。他想道，八戒有些躲懒，不肯出头，却只是有些口紧，好吃东西。等我哄他一哄，看他怎么说。”即时落下云头，到三藏前。三藏问道：“悟空，风雾处吉凶何如？”行者道：</p>

<p>“这会子明净了，没甚风雾。”三藏道：“正是，觉到退下些去了。”行者笑道：“师父，我常时间还看得好，这番却看错了。我只说风雾之中恐有妖怪，原来不是。”三藏道：“是甚么？”行者道：“前面不远，乃是一庄村。村上人家好善，蒸的白米干饭，白面馍馍斋僧哩。这些雾，想是那些人家蒸笼之气，也是积善之应。”八戒听说，认了真实，扯过行者悄悄的道：“哥哥，你先吃了他的斋来的？”行者道：“吃不多儿，因那菜蔬太咸酌了些，不喜多吃。”八戒道：“啐！凭他怎么咸，我也尽肚吃他一饱！十分作渴，便回来吃水。”行者道：“你要吃么？”八戒道：“正是，我肚里有些饥了，先要去吃些儿，不知如何？”行者道：“兄弟莫题，古书云，父在，子不得自专。师父又在此，谁敢先去？”八戒笑道：“你若不言语，我就去了。”行者道：“我不言语，看你怎么得去。”那呆子吃嘴的见识偏有，走上前唱个大喏道：“师父，适才师兄说，前村里有人家斋僧。你看这马，有些要打搅人家，便要草要料，却不费事？幸如今风雾明净，你们且略坐坐，等我去寻些嫩草儿，先喂喂马，然后再往那家子化斋去罢。”唐僧欢喜道：“好啊！你今日却怎肯这等勤谨？快去快来。”那呆子暗暗笑着便走，行者赶上扯住道：“兄弟，他那里斋僧，只斋俊的，不斋丑的。”八戒道：“这等说，又要变化是。”行者道：“正是，你变变儿去。”好呆子，他也有三十六般变化，走到山凹里，捻着诀，念动咒语，摇身一变，变做个矮胖和尚，手里敲个木鱼，口里哼阿哼的，又不会念经，只哼的是“上大人”。</p>

<p>却说那怪物收风敛雾，号令群妖，在于大路口上摆开一个圈子阵，专等行客。这呆子晦气，不多时撞到当中，被群妖围住，这个扯住衣服，那个扯着丝绦，推推拥拥，一齐下手。八戒道：“不要扯，等我一家家吃将来。”群妖道：“和尚，你要吃甚的？”八戒道：“你们这里斋僧，我来吃斋的。”群妖道：“你想这里斋僧，不知我这里专要吃僧。我们都是山中得道的妖仙，专要把你们和尚拿到家里，上蒸笼蒸熟吃哩，你倒还想来吃斋！”</p>

<p>八戒闻言，心中害怕，才报怨行者道：“这个弼马温，其实惫懒！</p>

<p>他哄我说是这村里斋僧，这里那得村庄人家，那里斋甚么僧，却原来是些妖精！”那呆子被他扯急了，即便现出原身，腰间掣钉钯，一顿乱筑，筑退那些小妖。小妖急跑去报与老怪道：“大王，祸事了！”老修道：“有甚祸事？”小妖道：“山前来了一个和尚，且是生得干净。我说拿家来蒸他吃，若吃不了，留些儿防天阴，不想他会变化。”老妖道：“变化甚的模样？”小妖道：“那里成个人相！长嘴大耳朵，背后又有鬃，双手轮一根钉钯，没头没脸的乱筑，唬得我们跑回来报大王也。”老怪道：“莫怕，等我去看。”轮着一条铁杵，走近前看时，见呆子果然丑恶。他生得：碓嘴初长三尺零，獠牙觜出赛银钉。一双圆眼光如电，两耳扇风唿唿声。脑后鬃长排铁箭，浑身皮糙癞还青。手中使件蹊跷物，九齿钉钯个个惊。妖精硬着胆喝道：“你是那里来的，叫甚名字？快早说来，饶你性命！”八戒笑道：“我的儿，你是也不认得你猪祖宗哩！上前来，说与你听：巨口獠牙神力大，玉皇升我天蓬帅。掌管天河八万兵，天宫快乐多自在。只因酒醉戏宫娥，那时就把英雄卖。一嘴拱倒斗牛宫，吃了王母灵芝菜。玉皇亲打二千锤，把吾贬下三天界。教吾立志养元神，下方却又为妖怪。正在高庄喜结亲，命低撞着孙兄到。金箍棒下受他降，低头才把沙门拜。背马挑包做夯工，前生少了唐僧债。铁脚天蓬本姓猪，法名改作猪八戒。”那妖精闻言，喝道：“你原来是唐僧的徒弟。我一向闻得唐僧的肉好吃，正要拿你哩，你却撞得来，我肯饶你？不要走！看杵！”八戒道：“孽畜，你原来是个染博士出身！”妖精道：“我怎么是染博士？”八戒道：“不是染博士，怎么会使棒槌？”那怪那容分说，近前乱打。他两个在山凹里，这一场好杀：九齿钉钯，一条铁棒。钯丢解数滚狂风，杵运机谋飞骤雨。一个是无名恶怪阻山程，一个是有罪天蓬扶性主。性正何愁怪与魔，山高不得金生土。那个杵架犹如蟒出潭，这个钯来却似龙离浦。喊声叱咤振山川，吆喝雄威惊地府。两个英雄各逞能，舍身却把神通赌。八戒长起威风，与妖精厮斗，那怪喝令小妖把八戒一齐围住不题。</p>

<p>却说行者在唐僧背后，忽失声冷笑。沙僧道：“哥哥冷笑，何也？”行者道：“猪八戒真个呆呀！听见说斋僧，就被我哄去了，这早晚还不见回来。若是一顿钯打退妖精，你看他得胜而回，争嚷功果；若战他不过，被他拿去，却是我的晦气，背前面后，不知骂了多少弼马温哩！悟净，你休言语，等我去看看。”好大圣，他也不使长老知道，悄悄的脑后拔了一根毫毛，吹口仙气，叫“变！”即变做本身模样，陪着沙僧，随着长老。他的真身出个神，跳在空中观看，但见那呆子被怪围绕，钉钯势乱，渐渐的难敌。行者忍不住，按落云头，厉声高叫道：“八戒不要忙，老孙来了！”那呆子听得是行者声音，仗着势，愈长威风，一顿钯，向前乱筑，那妖精抵敌不住，道：“这和尚先前不济，这会子怎么又发起狠来。”八戒道：“我的儿，不可欺负我！我家里人来也！”一发向前，没头没脸筑去。那妖精抵架不住，领群妖败阵去了。行者见妖精败去，他就不曾近前，拨转云头，径回本处，把毫毛一抖，收上身来。长老的肉眼凡胎，那里认得。</p>

<p>不一时，呆子得胜，也自转来，累得那粘涎鼻涕，白沫生生，气呼呼的，走将来叫声“师父！”长老见了，惊讶道：“八戒，你去打马草的，怎么这般狼狈回来？想是山上人家有人看护，不容你打草么？”呆子放下钯，捶胸跌脚道：“师父！莫要问！说起来就活活羞杀人！”长老道：“为甚么羞来？”八戒道：“师兄捉弄我！他先头说风雾里不是妖精，没甚凶兆，是一庄村人家好善，蒸白米干饭、白面馍馍斋僧的，我就当真，想着肚里饥了，先去吃些儿，假倚打草为名，岂知若干妖怪，把我围了，苦战了这一会，若不是师兄的哭丧棒相助，我也莫想得脱罗网回来也！”行者在旁笑道：“这呆子胡说！你若做了贼，就攀上一牢人。是我在这里看着师父，何曾侧离？”长老道：“是啊，悟空不曾离我。”那呆子跳着嚷道：“师父！你不晓得！他有替身！”长老道：“悟空，端的可有怪么？”行者瞒不过，躬身笑道：“是有个把小妖儿，他不敢惹我们。八戒，你过来，一发照顾你照顾。我们既保师父，走过险峻山路，就似行军的一般。”八戒道：“行军便怎的？”行者道：“你做个开路将军，在前剖路。那妖精不来便罢，若来时，你与他赌斗，打倒妖精，算你的功果。”八戒量着那妖精手段与他差不多，却说：“我就死在他手内也罢，等我先走！”行者笑道：“这呆子先说晦气话，怎么得长进！”八戒道：</p>

<p>“哥啊，你知道公子登筵，不醉即饱；壮士临阵，不死带伤？先说句错话儿，后便有威风。”行者欢喜，即忙背了马，请师父骑上，沙僧挑着行李，相随八戒，一路入山不题。</p>

<p>却说那妖精帅几个败残的小妖，径回本洞，高坐在那石崖上，默默无言。洞中还有许多看家的小妖，都上前问道：“大王常时出去，喜喜欢欢回来，今日如何烦恼？”老妖道：“小的们，我往常出洞巡山，不管那里的人与兽，定捞几个来家，养赡汝等，今日造化低，撞见一个对头。”小妖问：“是那个对头？”老妖道：“是一个和尚，乃东土唐僧取经的徒弟，名唤猪八戒。我被他一顿钉钯，把我筑得败下阵来。好恼啊！我这一向常闻得人说，唐僧乃十世修行的罗汉，有人吃他一块肉，可以延寿长生。</p>

<p>不期他今日到我山里，正好拿住他蒸吃，不知他手下有这等徒弟！”说不了，班部丛中闪上一个小妖，对老妖哽哽咽咽哭了三声，又嘻嘻哈哈的笑了三声。老妖喝道：“你又哭又笑，何也？”</p>

<p>小妖跪下道：“大王才说要吃唐僧，唐僧的肉不中吃。”老妖道：</p>

<p>“人都说吃他一块肉可以长生不老，与天同寿，怎么说他不中吃？”小妖道：“若是中吃，也到不得这里，别处妖精，也都吃了。</p>

<p>他手下有三个徒弟哩。”老妖道：“你知是那三个？”小妖道：“他大徒弟是孙行者，三徒弟是沙和尚，这个是他二徒弟猪八戒。”</p>

<p>老妖道：“沙和尚比猪八戒如何？”小妖道：“也差不多儿。”“那个孙行者比他如何？”小妖吐舌道：“不敢说！那孙行者神通广大，变化多端！他五百年前曾大闹天宫，上方二十八宿、九曜星官、十二元辰、五卿四相、东西星斗、南北二神、五岳四渎、普天神将，也不曾惹得他过，你怎敢要吃唐僧？”老妖道：“你怎么晓得他这等详细？”小妖道：“我当初在狮驼岭狮驼洞与那大王居住，那大王不知好歹，要吃唐僧，被孙行者使一条金箍棒，打进门来，可怜就打得犯了骨牌名，都断么绝六，还亏我有些见识，从后门走了，来到此处，蒙大王收留，故此知他手段。”老妖听言，大惊失色，这正是大将军怕谶语，他闻得自家人这等说，安得不惊？正都在悚惧之际，又一个小妖上前道：“大王莫恼，莫怕。常言道，事从缓来，若是要吃唐僧，等我定个计策拿他。”老妖道：“你有何计？”小妖道：“我有个分瓣梅花计。”老妖道：“怎么叫做分瓣梅花计？”小妖道：“如今把洞中大小群妖，点将起来，千中选百，百中选十，十中只选三个，须是有能干、会变化的，都变做大王的模样，顶大王之盔，贯大王之甲，执大王之杵，三处埋伏。先着一个战猪八戒，再着一个战孙行者，再着一个战沙和尚：舍着三个小妖，调开他弟兄三个，大王却在半空伸下拿云手去捉这唐僧，就如探囊取物，就如鱼水盆内捻苍蝇，有何难哉！”老妖闻此言，满心欢喜道：“此计绝妙！绝妙！这一去，拿不得唐僧便罢；若是拿了唐僧，决不轻你，就封你做个前部先锋。”小妖叩头谢恩，叫点妖怪，即将洞中大小妖精点起，果然选出三个有能的小妖，俱变做老妖，各执铁杵，埋伏等待唐僧不题。</p>

<p>却说这唐长老无虑无忧，相随八戒上大路，行彀多时，只见那路旁边扑喇的一声响喨，跳出一个小妖，奔向前边，要捉长老。孙行者叫道：“八戒！妖精来了，何不动手？”那呆子不认真假，掣钉钯赶上乱筑，那妖精使铁杵急架相迎。他两个一往一来的，在山坡下正然赌斗，又见那草科里响一声，又跳出个怪来，就奔唐僧。行者道：“师父！不好了！八戒的眼拙，放那妖精来拿你了，等老孙打他去！”急掣棒迎上前喝道：“那里去！</p>

<p>看棒！”那妖精更不打话，举杵来迎。他两个在草坡下一撞一冲，正相持处，又听得山背后呼的风响，又跳出个妖精来，径奔唐僧。沙僧见了，大惊道：“师父！大哥与二哥的眼都花了，把妖精放将来拿你了！你坐在马上，等老沙拿他去！”这和尚也不分好歹，即掣杖，对面挡住那妖精铁杵，恨苦相持。吆吆喝喝，乱嚷乱斗，渐渐的调远。那老怪在半空中，见唐僧独坐马上，伸下五爪钢钩，把唐僧一把挝住。那师父丢了马，脱了镫，被妖精一阵风径摄去了。可怜！这正是禅性遭魔难正果，江流又遇苦灾星！</p>

<p>老妖按下风头，把唐僧拿到洞里，叫：“先锋！”那定计的小妖上前跪倒，口中道：“不敢！不敢！”老妖道：“何出此言？大将军一言既出，如白染皂。当时说拿不得唐僧便罢，拿了唐僧，封你为前部先锋。今日你果妙计成功，岂可失信于你？你可把唐僧拿来，着小的们挑水刷锅，搬柴烧火，把他蒸一蒸，我和你都吃他一块肉，以图延寿长生也。先锋道：“大王，且不可吃。”老怪道：“既拿来，怎么不可吃？”先锋道：“大王吃了他不打紧，猪八戒也做得人情，沙和尚也做得人情，但恐孙行者那主子刮毒。他若晓得是我们吃了，他也不来和我们厮打，他只把那金箍棒往山腰里一搠，搠个窟窿，连山都掬倒了，我们安身之处也无之矣！”老怪道：“先锋，凭你有何高见？”先锋道：“依着我，把唐僧送在后园，绑在树上，两三日不要与他饭吃，一则图他里面干净；二则等他三人不来门前寻找，打听得他们回去了，我们却把他拿出来，自自在在的受用，却不是好？”老怪笑道：</p>

<p>“正是，正是！先锋说得有理！”一声号令，把唐僧拿入后园，一条绳绑在树上，众小妖都去前面去听候。你看那长老苦捱着绳缠索绑，紧缚牢拴，止不住腮边流泪，叫道：“徒弟呀！你们在那山中擒怪，甚路里赶妖？我被泼魔捉来，此处受灾，何日相会？</p>

<p>痛杀我也！”正自两泪交流，只见对面树上有人叫道：“长老，你也进来了！”长老正了性道：“你是何人？”那人道：“我是本山中的樵子，被那山主前日拿来，绑在此间，今已三日，算计要吃我哩。”长老滴泪道：“樵夫啊，你死只是一身，无甚挂碍，我却死得不甚干净。”樵子道：“长老，你是个出家人，上无父母，下无妻子，死便死了，有甚么不干净？”长老道：“我本是东土往西天取经去的，奉唐朝太宗皇帝御旨拜活佛，取真经，要超度那幽冥无主的孤魂。今若丧了性命，可不盼杀那君王，孤负那臣子？</p>

<p>那枉死城中无限的冤魂，却不大失所望，永世不得超生？一场功果，尽化作风尘，这却怎么得干净也？”樵子闻言，眼中堕泪道：“长老，你死也只如此，我死又更伤情。我自幼失父，与母鳏居，更无家业，止靠着打柴为生。老母今年八十三岁，只我一人奉养。倘若身丧，谁与他埋尸送老？苦哉苦哉！痛杀我也！”长老闻言，放声大哭道：“可怜，可怜！山人尚有思亲意，空教贫僧会念经！事君事亲，皆同一理。你为亲恩，我为君恩。”正是那流泪眼观流泪眼，断肠人送断肠人！且不言三藏身遭困苦，却说孙行者在草坡下战退小妖，急回来路旁边，不见了师父，止存白马行囊。慌得他牵马挑担，向山头找寻。咦！正是那：有难的江流专遇难，降魔的大圣亦遭魔。毕竟不知寻找师父下落如何，且听下回分解。</p>
