Chapter 36
<div class="title">
<P>When the Mind-Ape Stands Correct All Evil Causes Submit</P>
<P>When the Side-Gate Is Smashed the Moon Appears in Its Brightness</P>
</div>
<P>The story tells how Sun the Novice brought his cloud down to land and told the master and his fellow-disciples all about the Bodhisattva borrowing the two servant lads and Lord Lao recovering his treasures. Sanzang expressed his thanks at great length, then with great determination and pious sincerity prepared to head West for all he was worth. As he climbed into the saddle, Pig shouldered the luggage, Friar Sand held the horse's bridle, and Monkey cleared a path straight ahead down the mountainside with his iron cudgel. We can give no full account of how they slept in the rain, dined off the wind, were wrapped in frost and exposed to the dew. When they had been travelling for a long time they found the way forward blocked by another mountain.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciples,&#8221; shouted Sanzang from the back of his horse, &#8220;just look at how high and craggy that mountain is. You must be very careful and on your guard; I'm afraid that monsters may attack us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop your wild imaginings, Master,&#8221; replied Monkey, &#8220;and calm yourself. Of course nothing will happen.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But why is the journey to the Western Heaven so hard, disciple?&#8221; asked Sanzang. &#8220;As I recall I have been through four or five years of springs, summers, autumns and winters since leaving the city of Chang'an. Why haven't I got there yet?&#8221;</P>
<P>The question made Monkey chuckle: &#8220;It's early yet. We're not even out of the front door.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop lying, brother,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;There's no such front door on earth.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But we're still wandering around in the hall,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't try to intimidate us by talking so big,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;There couldn't possibly be a hall as large as this: there's nowhere you could buy roof-beams big enough.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you look at it my way, brother,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;the blue sky is the roof tiles, the sun and the moon are the windows, and the Four Mountains and Five Peaks are the pillars and beams. Heaven and earth are just like a big hall.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's enough of that,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;Why don't we just stroll around for a while then go back?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't talk nonsense,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Keep going with me.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage shouldered his iron cudgel, calmed the Tang Priest down, and cleared their way forward through the mountains. As the master gazed at it from his horse he saw that it was a splendid mountain view. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The towering peak touches the Dipper's handle;</P>
<P>The tops of the trees seem to reach the clouds.</P>
<P>From banked-up mists of blue</P>
<P>Comes the cry of the ape in the valley-mouth;</P>
<P>Deep in the turquoise shadows</P>
<P>Cranes call among the pines.</P>
<P>As the wind howls mountain sprites appear in the gullies,</P>
<P>Playing tricks on the wood-cutters;</P>
<P>Crafty foxes sit on the edge of rock-faces,</P>
<P>To the terror of hunters.</P>
<P>A splendid mountain,</P>
<P>Its every face towering and sheer.</P>
<P>Strange-shaped pines spread their bright green canopies;</P>
<P>From withered old trees hang vines of wisteria.</P>
<P>As spring waters fly through the air</P>
<P>The cold breeze cuts through and chills.</P>
<P>Where the crag towers aloft</P>
<P>A pure wind strikes the eye and startles the dreaming soul.</P>
<P>Sometimes the roar of the tiger is heard,</P>
<P>And often the songs of the mountain birds.</P>
<P>Herds of deer and muntjac make their way through the brambles,</P>
<P>Leaping and jumping;</P>
<P>River-deer and roebucks look for their food,</P>
<P>Rushing and scurrying.</P>
<P>Standing on the grassy slope,</P>
<P>No traveler can one see;</P>
<P>Walking deep in the hollows,</P>
<P>All around are jackals and wolves.</P>
<P>This is no place for a Buddha's self-cultivation,</P>
<P>But a haunt of birds and beasts.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The master trembled as he advanced deep into these mountains, his heart gripped with terror. Reining in his horse, he called out,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;After I grew in wisdom and took my vows,</P>
<P>His Majesty escorted me from the capital.</P>
<P>On my journey I met three wayward ones</P>
<P>To help me along as I rode in the saddle.</P>
<P>Over Hillside and gully I seek the scriptures,</P>
<P>Climbing many mountains to worship the Buddha.</P>
<P>Guarding myself as if behind a fence,</P>
<P>When will I return to visit the royal palace?&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey's reaction to hearing this was to say with a mocking laugh, &#8220;Don't worry, Master, and don't be so anxious. Just take it easy and carry on. Besides, you're bound to succeed because you're such a trier.&#8221; Master and disciples strode forward, enjoying the mountain scenery. Before they realized it the sun had sunk in the West. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>From the ten-mile pavilion no travelers leave,</P>
<P>In the ninefold heavens the stars appear,</P>
<P>On the eight streams the boats are all in harbor,</P>
<P>In seven thousand cities the gates have been shut.</P>
<P>From the six palaces and five departments the officials have gone;</P>
<P>On the four seas and three rivers the fishing lines rest.</P>
<P>In the two towers the drum and bell sound;</P>
<P>One bright moon fills the earth and sky.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Looking into the distance the venerable elder saw many lines of towers and great halls, one behind another. &#8220;Disciples,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;it's getting late now. Luckily there are those towers and halls nearby. I think they must belong to a Buddhist or Taoist monastery or convent. Let's spend the night there and be on our way again in the morning.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right, Master,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;but be patient. Wait till I've had a look to see whether it's a good or an evil place.&#8221; The Great Sage leapt up into the air and examined it very closely. It was indeed a Buddhist monastery. He could see</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A tiled wall plastered with red,</P>
<P>Golden studs on both the gates.</P>
<P>Line behind line of towers, amid the hills,</P>
<P>Hall upon hall concealed within the mountains.</P>
<P>The Building of Ten Thousand Buddhas faces the Tathagata Hall,</P>
<P>The Sunshine Terrace opposite the Hero Gate.</P>
<P>The seven-storied pagoda gathers night mists,</P>
<P>The three Buddha statues show their glory.</P>
<P>The Manjusri Tower next to the monks' dormitory,</P>
<P>The Maitreya Pavilion beside the Hall of Mercy.</P>
<P>Outside the Mountain Tower the green lights dance,</P>
<P>Purple clouds rise from the Void-pacing Hall.</P>
<P>The green of the pines joins the green of the bamboo,</P>
<P>All is purity in the abbot's meditation hall.</P>
<P>In quiet elegance the music is performed,</P>
<P>And all the streams rejoice as they return.</P>
<P>In the place of meditation dhyana monks teach;</P>
<P>Many instruments play in the music room.</P>
<P>On the Terrace of Wonder the epiphyllum flower falls,</P>
<P>Before the preaching hall the palm of scripture grows.</P>
<P>The place of the Three Treasures is shaded by the woods;</P>
<P>The mountains guard the Indian prince's palace.</P>
<P>Along the walls the burning lamps shine bright;</P>
<P>The air is thick with smoke from incense sticks.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Bringing his cloud down to land, Sun the Great Sage reported to Sanzang, &#8220;Master, it's a Buddhist monastery, and it will be a good place to spend the night. Let's go there.&#8221; The venerable elder let his horse go forward again, and they went straight on till they were outside the monastery gate. &#8220;Master,&#8221; asked Monkey, &#8220;what monastery is this?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's most unreasonable to ask that,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;when my horse has only this moment stopped and I haven't even had the time to take my foot out of the stirrup.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But you've been a monk since childhood, venerable sir,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;You were taught Confucian books before you studied the sutras and the dharma. You're very widely educated and on top of that you've been shown great kindness by the Tang Emperor. So how come you can't read those great big letters over the gate?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You stupid macaque,&#8221; cursed the venerable elder, &#8220;you don't know what you're talking about. I was urging my horse Westwards and had the sun in my eyes. Besides, the letters are hidden by the dust. That's why I didn't see them.&#8221; At this Monkey bowed, made himself over twenty feet tall, wiped the dust away with his hand, and invited his master to read them. There were five words written large: IMPERIALLY FOUNDED PRECIOUS WOOD MONASTERY. Monkey resumed his normal size and asked the master which of them was to go into the monastery to ask for lodging.</P>
<P>&#8220;I will,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;You are all so ugly, coarsely spoken, abrasive and overbearing that you might give the monks here such a fright that they refused to shelter us. That would be no good.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case, Master,&#8221; replied Monkey, &#8220;enough said. Please go in.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang laid down his monastic staff, removed his cape, neatened up his clothes, put his hands together and went in through the monastery gates. Behind red lacquered railings on either side two vajrapani guardian gods sat on high. These statues were both majestic and hideous:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>One's iron face and steel whiskers seemed to be alive,</P>
<P>The other's scorched brow and bulging eyes were exquisitely carved.</P>
<P>On the left were fists knobbly like pig iron,</P>
<P>To the right were hands as rough as copper ore.</P>
<P>Their golden chainmail gleamed in the light,</P>
<P>Helmet and embroidered sash floated in the breeze.</P>
<P>Many worship the Buddha in the West;</P>
<P>Red glows the incense in stone tripods.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Sanzang saw these statues he nodded, sighed and said, &#8220;If we had people in the East who could make big statues like these to burn incense to and worship I'd never have needed to go to the Western Heaven.&#8221; With more sighs he went through the inner gates of the monastery, where could be seen statues of Four Heavenly Kings, Dhrtarastra, Vaisravana, Virudhaka and Yirupaksa, set to the East, North, South and West to ensure the proper amounts of wind and rain. Once inside the inner gates he saw four lofty pines, each with a spreading canopy shaped like a parasol. He suddenly looked up to see the main Buddha hall. Placing his hands together in homage he prostrated himself before the images, then rose, walked round the platform on which the Buddha statues sat, and went out by the back door. He saw that at the back of the Buddha statues was one of the Bodhisattva Guanyin saving all beings in the Southern Sea. The craftsmanship was superb: there were figures of shrimps, fish, crabs, and turtles with heads and tails emerging from the composition as they leapt and played in the ocean waves.</P>
<P>The venerable elder nodded several more times, and sighed over and over again, &#8220;Oh dear! If all the creatures of scale and shell worship the Buddha, why is it that man alone will not live virtuously?&#8221;</P>
<P>As he sighed a monk came out through the innermost gate. Seeing Sanzang's remarkable and distinguished appearance he hurried up to him, greeted him courteously, and said, &#8220;Where are you from, reverend sir?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have been sent by His Majesty the Tang Emperor,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;to worship the Buddha in the Western Heaven and fetch the scriptures. As we have reached your illustrious monastery at evening I request that we be allowed to spend the night here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Reverend Sir,&#8221; said the monk, &#8220;please don't be angry with, me, but it's not for me to decide. I'm just a lay brother who sweeps and strikes the bell and does menial duties. We have a reverend abbot inside who is in charge here and I'll have to report to him. If he allows you to stay I'll come out again with an invitation, but if he doesn't then I'm afraid I won't be able to waste any more of your time.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Thank you for your trouble,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>The lay brother hurried inside to report to the abbot, who was also the superintendent of ecclesiastical affairs, &#8220;There's someone outside, sir.&#8221; The abbot rose, dressed himself in his miter and his vestments, and quickly opened the doors to let him in.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221; he asked the lay brother.</P>
<P>&#8220;Can't you see him over there, behind the main hall?&#8221; the lay brother replied.</P>
<P>Sanzang, who was leaning against the gateway, was bareheaded and wearing a monastic habit made of twenty-five strips of cloth and a pair of dirty, water-stained Bodhidharma sandals. At the sight of him the abbot said to the lay brother, &#8220;You need a lot more floggings yet, brother. Don't you realize that I hold high office in this monastery and only receive the gentry who come from town to burn incense here? How could you be so empty-headed as to ask me to receive a monk like that? Just look at his face. You can see he isn't honest. He's probably a wandering mendicant monk asking for lodging here because it's late. Our lodgings are not to be disturbed by the likes of him. He can spend the night squatting under the eaves. Why tell me about him?&#8221; With that he turned and walked away.</P>
<P>Sanzang, who heard all this, had tears running down his face. &#8220;Alas,&#8221; he said, &#8220;alas. How true it is that 'a man away from home is dirt.' I have been a monk since I was a boy. I have never</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>'Absolved the dead when eating meat</P>
<P>Or thought of doing harm,</P>
<P>Or read the Sutras angrily,</P>
<P>Or reflected without calm.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Nor have I</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Thrown roof tiles, or heaved a brick</P>
<P>To harm a temple building,</P>
<P>Or ever scraped from arhat's face</P>
<P>The very precious gilding.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Oh dear! Goodness only knows in what existence I did such harm to Heaven and Earth that I should always be meeting evil people in this one. Even if you will not give us a night's lodging, monk, why did you have to say such disgraceful things, and tell us to squat under the front eaves? It's a good thing you said nothing like that to Wukong. If you had he would have come in here and smashed your feet with his iron cudgel.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Oh well, never mind,&#8221; thought Sanzang. &#8220;As the saying goes, manners maketh man. I'll go in, ask him and see what he decides.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Master walked in through the gate to the abbot's lodgings, where he saw the abbot sitting with his outer clothes off and seething with fury. Sanzang did not know from the pile of paper on his table whether he was reading scripture or writing out Buddhist pardons for somebody.</P>
<P>Not venturing to go any further in, Sanzang stood in the courtyard, bowed, and called aloud, &#8220;My lord abbot, your disciple pays his respects.&#8221;</P>
<P>The monk, apparently very irritated that he had come in, barely acknowledged his greeting and asked, &#8220;Where are you from?&#8221;</P>
<P>To this Sanzang replied, &#8220;I have been sent by His Majesty the Great Tang Emperor to worship the living Buddha in the Western Heaven and fetch the scriptures. It was because I have reached your illustrious monastery at nightfall that I have come to ask for lodging. I'll leave before first light tomorrow. I beg, venerable abbot, that you will show me kindness.&#8221;</P>
<P>Only then did the abbot make a slight bow and ask, &#8220;Are you Tang Sanzang?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, I am.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you are going to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures, how is that you don't know the way?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've never been here before,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;About a mile and a half to the West is Ten Mile Inn,&#8221; said the abbot, &#8220;where they sell food and you can put up for the night. It would not be convenient for you monks from far away to stay here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There is a saying, abbot,&#8221; replied Sanzang, &#8220;that 'Buddhist and Taoist monasteries and convents are all rest-houses for us monks; the sight of the temple gate is worth a big helping of rice.' You can't refuse us. What do you mean by it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You wandering monks,&#8221; roared the abbot in fury, &#8220;you've all got the gift of the gab, haven't you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why do you say that?&#8221; asked Sanzang, to which the abbot replied, &#8220;There's an old saying that goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the tiger came to town,</P>
<P>Every household shut its door.</P>
<P>Although he'd bitten no one yet,</P>
<P>Tiger's name was bad before.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean, 'Tiger's name was bad before?'&#8220; asked Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;Some years ago,&#8221; the other replied, &#8220;a group of itinerant monks came and sat down at our gates. Seeing how wretched they were&#8212;their clothes all torn, barefoot and bareheaded&#8212;I was sorry for them being so ragged. So I asked them into my quarters, gave them the best places to sit, provided them with a meal, lent each of them an old habit, and let them stay for a few days. Little did I imagine that the free food and the free clothing would put all thought of leaving out of their minds. They stayed for seven or eight years. Staying wasn't so bad, but it was all the terrible things they did.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What terrible things?&#8221; asked Sanzang. &#8220;Listen while I tell you,&#8221; replied the abbot,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;When idle or bored they threw bricks around,</P>
<P>Or tore out the studs from the monastery walls.</P>
<P>On cold days they burnt all the window-frames up,</P>
<P>Slept outside in summer on dismantled doors.</P>
<P>&#8220;They ripped up the banners to make themselves foot-cloths,</P>
<P>Traded our incense and ivory for turnips,</P>
<P>Stole oil from the lamp that never goes out,</P>
<P>And gambled away all our cauldrons and dishes.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Oh dear,&#8221; thought Sanzang on hearing this, &#8220;I'm not a spineless monk like them.&#8221; He was on the point of tears, but then thought that the abbot might mock him, so he discreetly dried them with his clothes, held back his sobs, and hurried out to see his three disciples.</P>
<P>At the sigh of his master's angry expression Monkey asked him, &#8220;Master, did the monks in there beat you up?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;They must have,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;or why else did I hear sobbing? Did they tell you off?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;They did not tell me off.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If they didn't beat you or reproach you, why look so upset?&#8221; asked Monkey. &#8220;Don't tell me it's because you're homesick.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is not a good place,&#8221; said the Tang Priest.</P>
<P>&#8220;They must be Taoists here,&#8221; said Monkey with a grin.</P>
<P>&#8220;You only get Taoists in a Taoist temple,&#8221; retorted Sanzang angrily. &#8220;In a Buddhist monastery there are Buddhist monks.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're hopeless,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;If they're Buddhist monks they're like us. As the saying goes, 'All in the Buddhist community are friends.' You sit here while I take a look around.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Monkey touched the gold band round his head, tightened his kilt, went straight into the main shrine-hall, pointed at the three Buddha statues and said, &#8220;You may only be imitations made of gilded clay, but you must have some feeling inside. I'm here this evening to ask for a night's lodging because I'm escorting the holy Tang Priest to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures in the Western Heaven. Announce us this instant. If you don't put us up for the night I'll smash you gilded bodies with one crack of this cudgel and show you up for the dirt that you really are.&#8221;</P>
<P>While Monkey was indulging in this bad temper and bluster a lay brother responsible for burning the evening incense had lit several sticks and was putting them into the burner in front of the Buddhas. An angry shout from Monkey gave him such a fright that he fell over. Picking himself up he saw Monkey's face, at which he collapsed again, then rolled and staggered to the abbot's cell, where he reported, &#8220;Reverend sir, there's a monk outside.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You lay brothers really need more flogging,&#8221; said the abbot. &#8220;I've already said they can squat under the eaves, so why report again? Next time it will be twenty strokes.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But, reverend sir,&#8221; said the lay brother, &#8220;this is a different monk. He looks thoroughly vicious, and he's got no backbone either.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What's he like?&#8221; the abbot asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Round eyes, pointed ears, hair all over his cheeks, and a face as ugly as a thunder god,&#8221; said the lay brother. &#8220;He's got a cudgel in his hand and he's gnashing his teeth in fury. He must be looking for someone to kill.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll go out and see him,&#8221; said the abbot. No sooner had he opened his door than Monkey charged in. He really was ugly: an irregular, knobbly face, a pair of yellow eyes, a bulging forehead, and teeth jutting out. He was like a crab, with flesh on the inside and bone on the outside. The old monk was so frightened that he fastened the doors of his quarters.</P>
<P>Monkey, who was right behind him, smashed through the doors and said, &#8220;Hurry up and sweep out a thousand nice clean rooms for me. I want to go to sleep.&#8221;</P>
<P>The abbot, hiding in his room, said to the lay brother, &#8220;It's not his fault he's so ugly. He's just talking big to make up for that face. There are only three hundred rooms in the whole monastery, even counting my lodgings, the Buddha Hall, the drum and bell towers and the cloisters, but he's asking for a thousand to sleep in. We can't possibly get them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Reverend sir,&#8221; said the lay brother, &#8220;I'm terrified. You had better answer him, however you will.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Venerable sir,&#8221; called the abbot, shaking with fear, &#8220;you ask for lodging, but our little monastery would be most inconvenient, so we won't be able to entertain you. Please spend the night somewhere else.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey made his cudgel as thick as a rice-bowl and stood it on its end in the courtyard outside the abbot's cell. &#8220;If it would be inconvenient, monk,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you'd better move out.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But I've lived here since I was a boy,&#8221; the abbot said, &#8220;my master's master passed the monastery on to my master, who passed it on to my generation, and we'll hand it on in turn to our successors and our successors' successors. Goodness only knows what he's up to, charging in here and trying to move us out.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No problem at all, reverend sir,&#8221; said the lay brother. &#8220;We can go. He's already brought his pole into the yard.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop talking nonsense,&#8221; said the abbot. &#8220;There are four of five hundred of us monks, old and young, so where could we go? If we went there would be nowhere for us to stay.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If there's nowhere you can move to,&#8221; said Monkey, who had heard the conversation, &#8220;you'll have to send someone out to take me on in a quarterstaff fight.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Go out and fight him for me,&#8221; the abbot ordered the lay brother.</P>
<P>&#8220;Reverend Sir,&#8221; the lay brother protested, &#8220;you can't ask me to fight with a staff against a caber that size.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You must,&#8221; the abbot replied, adding, &#8220;'An army is built up for many years to be used in a single morning.'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Never mind him hitting you with that caber,&#8221; said the lay brother, &#8220;it would squash you flat if it just fell on you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;And even if it didn't fall on you and squash you,&#8221; said the abbot, &#8220;with it standing out there in the yard you might be walking around at night, forget it was there, and give yourself a dent in the head just by bumping into it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Now you realize how heavy it is, reverend sir, how can you expect me to go out and fight him with my staff?&#8221; said the lay brother. This was how the monks quarreled among themselves.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Monkey, hearing all this, &#8220;you're no match for me. But if I were to kill just one of you with this cudgel my master would be angry with me for committing murder again. I'd better find something else to hit as a demonstration for you.&#8221; Looking and seeing a stone lion outside the doors to the abbot's room, he raised his cudgel and smashed it to smithereens with a single resounding blow. When the abbot saw this through the window the fright turned his bones and muscles to jelly. He dived under the bed.</P>
<P>The lay brother climbed into the cooking-stove and kept saying, &#8220;Sir, sir, that cudgel's too heavy, I'm no match for you. I beg you, I beg you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I won't hit you, monk,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I've just got a question for you: how many monks are there in the monastery?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We have two hundred and eighty-five cells all told,&#8221; replied the abbot, shaking with fear, &#8220;and five hundred monks holding official ordination licenses.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I want you to draw those five hundred monks up on parade,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;get them dressed in long habits, and receive my master. Then I won't hit you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you won't hit me, sir,&#8221; said the abbot, &#8220;I'd gladly carry him in.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Hurry up then,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;I don't care if the fright breaks your gallbladder, or even if it breaks your heart,&#8221; said the abbot to the lay brother. &#8220;Go out and tell them all to come here and welcome His Grace the Tang Priest.&#8221;</P>
<P>The lay brother had no choice but to take his life in his hands. Not daring to go through the front door, he squirmed out through a gap in the back wall and went straight to the main hall, where he struck the drum that was to the East and the bell that was to the West. The sound of the two together startled all the monks young and old in the dormitories on both sides.</P>
<P>They came to the main hall and asked, &#8220;Why are the drum and bell sounding now? It's too early.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Go and change at once,&#8221; said the lay brother, &#8220;then get yourselves into your groups under the senior monk and go outside the main gates to welcome His Grace from the land of Tang.&#8221; All the monks then went out through the gates in a most orderly procession to greet him. Some wore full cassocks, and some tunics; those who had neither wore a kind of sleeveless smock, and the poorest of all who had no proper garment draped the two ends of their loin-cloths over their shoulders.</P>
<P>&#8220;Monks, what's that you're wearing?&#8221; demanded Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Sir, don't hit us,&#8221; they said, seeing his ugly and evil face, &#8220;let us explain. This is cloth we beg for in town. We don't have any tailors here, so these are paupers' wrappers we make ourselves.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey laughed inside at this, then escorted them all out through the gates to kneel down. The abbot kowtowed and called out, &#8220;Your Grace of Tang, please take a seat in my lodgings.&#8221;</P>
<P>Seeing all this, Pig said, &#8220;Master, you're completely useless. When you went in you were all tears and pouting so much you could have hung a bottle from your lips. How come that only Monkey knows tow to make them welcome us with kowtows?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Ill-mannered idiot,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;As the saying goes, even a devil's afraid of an ugly mug.&#8221; Sanzang was most uncomfortable at the sight of them all kowtowing and bowing, so he stepped forward and invited them all to rise. They all kowtowed again and said, &#8220;Your Grace, if you would ask your disciple to show some mercy and not hit us with that caber we'll gladly kneel here for a month.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You must not hit them, Wukong,&#8221; said the Tang Priest.</P>
<P>&#8220;I haven't hit them,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;If I had, I'd have wiped the lot of them out.&#8221; Only then did all the monks rise to their feet. Leading the horse, shouldering the shoulder-poles with the luggage, carrying the Tang Priest, giving Pig a piggyback, and supporting Friar Sand they all went in through the main gates to the abbot's lodgings at the back, where they took their seats in due order.</P>
<P>The monks all started kowtowing again. &#8220;Please rise, lord abbot,&#8221; Sanzang said. &#8220;There is no need for any more kowtows, which are oppressive for a poor monk like me. We are both followers of the Buddhist faith.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Grace is an Imperial Commissioner,&#8221; the abbot replied, &#8220;and I failed to greet you properly. You came to our wretched monastery, but when I met you my mortal eyes did not recognize your illustrious status. May I venture to ask, Your Grace, whether you are eating a vegetarian or a meat diet on your journey? We would like to prepare a meal.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Vegetarian food,&#8221; replied Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;And I imagine that these reverend gentlemen,&#8221; said the abbot, &#8220;like to eat meat.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;We are vegetarians, and have been all our lives.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Good Heavens,&#8221; exclaimed the abbot, &#8220;can even creatures like these be vegetarians?&#8221;</P>
<P>Then a very bold monk came forward to ask, &#8220;Sirs, as you eat vegetarian food, how much rice should we cook for you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Mean little monks,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;why ask? Cook us a bushel.&#8221; The monks then moved as fast as they could to clean the stoves and the cauldrons and serve food and tea in all the cells. The lamps were hung high and tables and chairs brought to entertain the Tan Priest.</P>
<P>When master and disciples had eaten their supper the monks cleared the things away. Sanzang thanked the abbot: &#8220;Lord abbot, we have put your illustrious monastery to great trouble.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; the abbot protested, &#8220;we have entertained you very poorly.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;May my disciples and I spend the night here?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry, Your Grace,&#8221; the abbot replied, &#8220;we will arrange things.&#8221; Then he called out, &#8220;Are there any lay brothers on duty over there?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, reverend sir,&#8221; a lay brother replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Then send a couple of them to see to the fodder for His Grace's horse,&#8221; the abbot instructed, &#8220;and have some sweep out and clean up the front meditation hall. Put beds in there for these venerable gentlemen to sleep in.&#8221; The lay brothers did as they had been told and arranged everything, then invited the Tang Priest to go to bed. Master and disciples led the horse and carried their baggage out of the abbot's quarters to the meditation hall. Looking in through the doors they saw the lamp burning brightly and four rattan beds set up at the ends of the room. Monkey told the lay brother who was looking after the fodder to carry it inside, lay it in the meditation hall, and tie up the white horse; the lay brothers were then all dismissed. Sanzang sat in the middle, right under the lamp, while the five hundred monks stood in their two divisions waiting upon him, not daring to leave.</P>
<P>&#8220;You may now leave, gentlemen,&#8221; said Sanzang, bowing to them from his chair, &#8220;as we would like to go to sleep.&#8221; But the monks dared not withdraw.</P>
<P>The abbot stepped forward and said to them, &#8220;Help Their Graces to bed, then leave.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You have done that already,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;so you may all now go.&#8221; Only then did they disperse.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On going outside to relieve himself the Tang Priest saw the moon shining in the sky. He called his disciples, Monkey, Pig and Friar Sand, who came out to stand in attendance. He was moved by the brightness and purity of the moon as it shone from high in the jade firmament, making all in heaven and on earth clearly visible. He recited a long poem in the ancient style in the moonlight with a nostalgic feeling. It went:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A white soul hangs, a mirror in the sky,</P>
<P>Reflected whole in the mountain stream.</P>
<P>Pure light fills the towers of jade,</P>
<P>Cool air swirls round the silver bowls.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The same pure light shines on a thousand miles;</P>
<P>This is the clearest night of the year.</P>
<P>It rises from the sea like a frosty disk,</P>
<P>Hang in the heavens as a wheel of ice.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sad the lonely traveler by the inn's cold window;</P>
<P>The old man goes to sleep in the village pub.</P>
<P>In the Han garden one is shocked by graying hair;</P>
<P>In the Qin tower the lady prepares herself for bed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Yu Liang's lines on the moon are recorded by history;</P>
<P>Yuan Hong lay sleepless under the moon in a river boat.</P>
<P>The light that floats in the cup is cold and weak;</P>
<P>The purity shining in the court is strong and full of magic.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>At every window are chanted poems to the snow,</P>
<P>In every courtyard the icy crescent is described.</P>
<P>Tonight we share quiet pleasure in the cloister;</P>
<P>When shall we ever all go home together?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Having heard the poem, Monkey went up to him and said, &#8220;Master, you only know about the moon's beauty, and you're homesick too. You don't know what the moon's really about. It's like the carpenter's line and compasses&#8212;it keeps the heavenly bodies in order. On the thirtieth of every month the metal element of its male soul has all gone, and the water element of its female soul fills the whole disk. That is why it goes black and has no light. That's what is called the end of the old moon. This is the time, between the last day of the old moon and the first of the new, when it mates with the sun. The light makes it conceive. By the third day the first male light is seen, and on the eight day the second male light. When the moon's male and female souls each have half of it, the moon is divided as if by a string. That is why it is called the first quarter. On the fifteenth night, tonight, all three male lights are complete, and the moon is round. This is called the full moon. On the sixteenth the first female principle is born, followed on the twenty-second by the second. At this stage the two souls are matched again and the moon is again divided as if by a string. This is what is called the third quarter. By the thirtieth the three female principles are complete, and it is the last day of the old moon. This is what is meant by 'prenatal absorption and refinement'. If we are all able gently to raise the 'double eight' and achieve it in nine by nine days, it will be easy to see the Buddha and easy to go home again too. As the poem goes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After the first quarter and before the third,</P>
<P>Medicines taste bland, with all pneuma signs complete.</P>
<P>When it is gathered and refined in the furnace,</P>
<P>The achievement of the will is the Western Heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On learning this the venerable elder was instantly enlightened and he fully comprehended the truth, and as he thanked Monkey his heart was filled with happiness. Friar Sand laughed as he stood beside them. &#8220;What my brother says is true, as far as it goes,&#8221; he commented. &#8220;In the first quarter the male is dominant, and after the third quarter the female. When male and female are half and half the metal element obtains water. But what he did not say was this:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Fire and water support each other, each with its own fate;</P>
<P>All depend on the Earth Mother to combine them naturally.</P>
<P>The three meet together, without competing;</P>
<P>Water is in the Yangtze River, and the moon on the sky.&#8221;</P>
<P>Hearing this removed another obstruction from the venerable elder's mind. Indeed:</P>
<P>When reason fathoms one mystery, a thousand are made clear;</P>
<P>The theory that breaks through non-life leads to immortality.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Whereupon Pig went up to his master, tugged at his clothes, and said, &#8220;Pay no attention to all that nonsense, Master. We're missing our sleep. As for that moon, well:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Soon after it's defective the moon fills up again,</P>
<P>Just as at birth I too was incomplete.</P>
<P>They complain my belly's too big when I eat,</P>
<P>And say that I drool when I'm holding a bowl.</P>
<P>They are all neat and blessed by cultivation;</P>
<P>I was born stupid and have a baser fate.</P>
<P>You'll achieve the Three Ways of existence by fetching the scriptures,</P>
<P>And go straight up to the Western Heaven with a wag of your tail and your head.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;That will do,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;Disciples, you've had a hard journey, so go to bed. I have to read this sutra first.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You must be wrong, Master,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;You became a monk when you were very young and know all the surras of your childhood by heart. Now you are going to the Western Heaven on the orders of the Tang Emperor to fetch the true scriptures of the Great Vehicle, but you haven't succeeded yet. You haven't seen the Buddha or got the scriptures. So what sutra will you read?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Ever since leaving Chang'an,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;I have been travelling in such a rush every day that I have forgotten the scriptures of my youth. As I have some free time tonight I shall relearn them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case we'll turn in first,&#8221; said Monkey. Each of the three of them went to sleep on his rattan bed while their master closed the door of the meditation hall, turned up the silver lamp, and opened out the scroll of scripture, which he silently read. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the first drum sounds in the tower the people are all silent.</P>
<P>In the fishing boat by the bank the fires have been put out.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know how the venerable elder left the temple, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>心猿正处诸缘伏</p>
<p>劈破旁门见月明</p>
</div>
<p>却说孙行者按落云头，对师父备言菩萨借童子、老君收去宝贝之事。三藏称谢不已，死心塌地，办虔诚，舍命投西，攀鞍上马，猪八戒挑着行李，沙和尚拢着马头，孙行者执了铁棒，剖开路，径下高山前进。说不尽那水宿风餐，披霜冒露，师徒们行罢多时，前又一山阻路。三藏在那马上高叫：“徒弟啊，你看那里山势崔巍，须是要仔细提防，恐又有魔障侵身也。”行者道：“师父休要胡思乱想，只要定性存神，自然无事。”三藏道：“徒弟呀，西天怎么这等难行？我记得离了长安城，在路上春尽夏来，秋残冬至，有四五个年头，怎么还不能得到？”行者闻言，呵呵笑道：“早哩！早哩！还不曾出大门哩！”八戒道：“哥哥不要扯谎，人间就有这般大门？”行者道：“兄弟，我们还在堂屋里转哩！”沙僧笑道：“师兄，少说大话吓我，那里就有这般大堂屋，却也没处买这般大过梁啊。”行者道：“兄弟，若依老孙看时，把这青天为屋瓦，日月作窗棂，四山五岳为梁柱，天地犹如一敞厅！”八戒听说道：“罢了！罢了！我们只当转些时回去罢。”行者道：“不必乱谈，只管跟着老孙走路。”</p>

<p>好大圣，横担了铁棒，领定了唐僧，剖开山路，一直前进。</p>

<p>那师父在马上遥观，好一座山景，真个是：山顶嵯峨摩斗柄，树梢仿佛接云霄。青烟堆里，时闻得谷口猿啼；乱翠阴中，每听得松间鹤唳。啸风山魅立溪间，戏弄樵夫；成器狐狸坐崖畔，惊张猎户。好山！看那八面崖巍，四围险峻。古怪乔松盘翠盖，枯摧老树挂藤萝。泉水飞流，寒气透人毛发冷；巅峰屹崒，清风射眼梦魂惊。时听大虫哮吼，每闻山鸟时鸣。麂鹿成群穿荆棘，往来跳跃；獐兔结党寻野食，前后奔跑。佇立草坡，一望并无客旅；行来深凹，四边俱有豺狼。应非佛祖修行处，尽是飞禽走兽场。那师父战战兢兢，进此深山，心中凄惨，兜住马，叫声：“悟空啊！我自从益智登山盟，王不留行送出城。路上相逢三棱子，途中催趱马兜铃。寻坡转涧求荆芥，迈岭登山拜茯苓。防己一身如竹沥，茴香何日拜朝廷？”孙大圣闻言，呵呵冷笑道：“师父不必挂念，少要心焦，且自放心前进，还你个功到自然成也。”</p>

<p>师徒们玩着山景，信步行时，早不觉红轮西坠，正是：十里长亭无客走，九重天上现星辰。八河船只皆收港，七千州县尽关门。</p>

<p>六宫五府回官宰，四海三江罢钓纶。两座楼头钟鼓响，一轮明月满乾坤。</p>

<p>那长老在马上遥观，只见那山凹里有楼台迭迭，殿阁重重。三藏道：“徒弟，此时天色已晚，幸得那壁厢有楼阁不远，想必是庵观寺院，我们都到那里借宿一宵，明日再行罢。”行者道：“师父说得是。不要忙，等我且看好歹如何。”那大圣跳在空中，仔细观看，果然是座山门，但见八字砖墙泥红粉，两边门上钉金钉。迭迭楼台藏岭畔，层层宫阙隐山中。万佛阁对如来殿，朝阳楼应大雄门。七层塔屯云宿雾，三尊佛神现光荣。文殊台对伽蓝舍，弥勒殿靠大慈厅。看山楼外青光舞，步虚阁上紫云生。松关竹院依依绿，方丈禅堂处处清。雅雅幽幽供乐事，川川道道喜回迎。参禅处有禅僧讲，演乐房多乐器鸣。妙高台上昙花坠，说法坛前贝叶生。正是那林遮三宝地，山拥梵王宫。半壁灯烟光闪灼，一行香霭雾朦胧。孙大圣按下云头，报与三藏道：“师父，果然是一座寺院，却好借宿，我们去来。”</p>

<p>这长老放开马，一直前来，径到了山门之外。行者道：“师父，这一座是甚么寺？”三藏道：“我的马蹄才然停住，脚尖还未出镫，就问我是甚么寺，好没分晓！”行者道：“你老人家自幼为僧，须曾讲过儒书，方才去演经法，文理皆通，然后受唐王的恩宥，门上有那般大字，如何不认得？”长老骂道：“泼猢狲！说话无知！我才面西催马，被那太阳影射，奈何门虽有字，又被尘垢朦胧，所以未曾看见。”行者闻言，把腰儿躬一躬，长了二丈余高，用手展去灰尘道：“师父，请看。”上有五个大字，乃是敕建宝林寺。行者收了法身，道：“师父，这寺里谁进去借宿？”三藏道：“我进去。你们的嘴脸丑陋，言语粗疏，性刚气傲，倘或冲撞了本处僧人，不容借宿，反为不美。”行者道：“既如此，请师父进去，不必多言。”</p>

<p>那长老却丢了锡杖，解下斗篷，整衣合掌，径入山门，只见两边红漆栏杆里面，高坐着一对金刚，装塑的威仪恶丑：一个铁面钢须似活容，一个燥眉圜眼若玲珑。左边的拳头骨突如生铁，右边的手掌崚嶒赛赤铜。金甲连环光灿烂，明盔绣带映飘风。西方真个多供佛，石鼎中间香火红。三藏见了，点头长叹道：“我那东土，若有人也将泥胎塑这等大菩萨，烧香供养啊，我弟子也不往西天去矣。”正叹息处，又到了二层山门之内，见有四大天王之相，乃是持国、多闻、增长、广目，按东北西南风调雨顺之意。进了二层门里，又见有乔松四树，一树树翠盖蓬蓬，却如伞状，忽抬头，乃是大雄宝殿。那长老合掌皈依，舒身下拜。拜罢起来，转过佛台，到于后门之下，又见有倒座观音普度南海之相。那壁上都是良工巧匠装塑的那些虾鱼蟹鳖，出头露尾，跳海水波潮耍子。长老又点头三五度，感叹万千声道：“可怜啊！鳞甲众生都拜佛，为人何不肯修行！”正赞叹间，又见三门里走出一个道人。那道人忽见三藏相貌稀奇，丰姿非俗，急趋步上前施礼道：“师父那里来的？”三藏道：“弟子是东土大唐驾下差来上西天拜佛求经的，今到宝方，天色将晚，告借一宿。”那道人道：“师父莫怪，我做不得主。我是这里扫地撞钟打勤劳的道人，里面还有个管家的老师父哩，待我进去禀他一声。他若留你，我就出来奉请；若不留你，我却不敢羁迟。”三藏道：“累及你了。”</p>

<p>那道人急到方丈报道：“老爷，外面有个人来了。”那僧官即起身，换了衣服，按一按毗卢帽，披上袈裟，急开门迎接，问道人：“那里人来？”道人用手指定道：“那正殿后边不是一个人？”那三藏光着一个头，穿一领二十五条达摩衣，足下登一双拖泥带水的达公鞋，斜倚在那后门首。僧官见了大怒道：“道人少打！你岂不知我是僧官，但只有城上来的士夫降香，我方出来迎接。这等个和尚，你怎么多虚少实，报我接他！看他那嘴脸，不是个诚实的，多是云游方上僧，今日天晚，想是要来借宿。我们方丈中，岂容他打搅！教他往前廊下蹲罢了，报我怎么！”抽身转去。长老闻言，满眼垂泪道：“可怜！可怜！这才是人离乡贱！我弟子从小儿出家，做了和尚，又不曾拜谶吃荤生歹意，看经怀怒坏禅心；又不曾丢瓦抛砖伤佛殿，阿罗脸上剥真金。噫！可怜啊！不知是那世里触伤天地，教我今生常遇不良人！和尚你不留我们宿便罢了，怎么又说这等惫懒话，教我们在前道廊下去蹲？此话不与行者说还好，若说了，那猴子进来，一顿铁棒，把孤拐都打断你的！”长老道：“也罢，也罢，常言道，人将礼乐为先。我且进去问他一声，看意下如何。”</p>

<p>那师父踏脚迹，跟他进方丈门里，只见那僧官脱了衣服，气呼呼的坐在那里，不知是念经，又不知是与人家写法事，见那桌案上有些纸札堆积。唐僧不敢深入，就立于天井里，躬身高叫道：“老院主，弟子问讯了！”那和尚就有些不耐烦他进里边来的意思，半答不答的还了个礼道：“你是那里来的？”三藏道：“弟子乃东土大唐驾下差来上西天拜活佛求经的，经过宝方天晚，求借一宿，明日不犯天光就行了。万望老院主方便方便。”那僧官才欠起身来道：“你是那唐三藏么？”三藏道：“不敢，弟子便是。”僧官道：“你既往西天取经，怎么路也不会走？”</p>

<p>三藏道：“弟子更不曾走贵处的路。”他道：“正西去，只有四五里远近，有一座三十里店，店上有卖饭的人家，方便好宿。我这里不便，不好留你们远来的僧。”三藏合掌道：“院主，古人有云，庵观寺院，都是我方上人的馆驿，见山门就有三升米分。你怎么不留我，却是何情？”僧官怒声叫道：“你这游方的和尚，便是有些油嘴油舌的说话！”三藏道：“何为油嘴油舌？”僧官道：“古人云，老虎进了城，家家都闭门。虽然不咬人，日前坏了名。”三藏道：“怎么日前坏了名？”他道：“向年有几众行脚僧，来于山门口坐下，是我见他寒薄，一个个衣破鞋无，光头赤脚，我叹他那般褴褛，即忙请入方丈，延之上坐。款待了斋饭，又将故衣各借一件与他，就留他住了几日。怎知他贪图自在衣食，更不思量起身，就住了七八个年头。住便也罢，又干出许多不公的事来。”三藏道：“有甚么不公的事？”僧官道：“你听我说：</p>

<p>闲时沿墙抛瓦，闷来壁上扳钉。冷天向火折窗棂，夏日拖门拦径。幡布扯为脚带，牙香偷换蔓菁。常将琉璃把油倾，夺碗夺锅赌胜。”三藏听言，心中暗道：“可怜啊！我弟子可是那等样没脊骨的和尚？”欲待要哭，又恐那寺里的老和尚笑他，但暗暗扯衣揩泪，忍气吞声，急走出去，见了三个徒弟。那行者见师父面上含怒，向前问：“师父，寺里和尚打你来？”唐僧道：“不曾打。”</p>

<p>八戒说：“一定打来，不是，怎么还有些哭包声？”那行者道：“骂你来？”唐僧道：“也不曾骂。”行者道：“既不曾打，又不曾骂，你这般苦恼怎么？好道是思乡哩？”唐僧道：“徒弟，他这里不方便。”行者笑道：“这里想是道士？”唐僧怒道：“观里才有道士，寺里只是和尚。”行者道：“你不济事，但是和尚，即与我们一般。常言道，既在佛会下，都是有缘人。你且坐，等我进去看看。”</p>

<p>好行者，按一按顶上金箍，束一束腰间裙子，执着铁棒，径到大雄宝殿上，指着那三尊佛像道：“你本是泥塑金装假像，内里岂无感应？我老孙保领大唐圣僧往西天拜佛求取真经，今晚特来此处投宿，趁早与我报名！假若不留我等，就一顿棍打碎金身，教你还现本相泥土！”这大圣正在前边发狠捣叉子乱说，只见一个烧晚香的道人，点了几枝香，来佛前炉里插，被行者咄的一声，唬了一跌，爬起来看见脸，又是一跌，吓得滚滚蹡蹡，跑入方丈里报道：“老爷！外面有个和尚来了！”那僧官道：“你这伙道人都少打！一行说教他往前廊下去蹲，又报甚么！再说打二十！”道人说：“老爷，这个和尚，比那个和尚不同，生得恶躁，没脊骨。”僧官道：“怎的模样？”道人道：“是个圆眼睛，查耳朵，满面毛，雷公嘴。手执一根棍子，咬牙恨恨的，要寻人打哩。”僧官道：“等我出去看。”他即开门，只见行者撞进来了，真个生得丑陋：七高八低孤拐脸，两只黄眼睛，一个磕额头；獠牙往外生，就象属螃蟹的，肉在里面，骨在外面。那老和尚慌得把方丈门关了。行者赶上，扑的打破门扇，道：“赶早将干净房子打扫一千间，老孙睡觉！”僧官躲在房里，对道人说：“怪他生得丑么，原来是说大话，折作的这般嘴脸。我这里连方丈、佛殿、钟鼓楼、两廊，共总也不上三百间，他却要一千间睡觉，却打那里来？”道人说：“师父，我也是吓破胆的人了，凭你怎么答应他罢。”那僧官战索索的高叫道：“那借宿的长老，我这小荒山不方便，不敢奉留，往别处去宿罢。”行者将棍子变得盆来粗细，直壁壁的竖在天井里，道：“和尚，不方便，你就搬出去！”僧官道：“我们从小儿住的寺，师公传与师父，师父传与我辈，我辈要远继儿孙。他不知是那里勾当，冒冒实实的，教我们搬哩。”</p>

<p>道人说：“老爷，十分不狤魀，搬出去也罢，扛子打进门来了。”</p>

<p>僧官道：“你莫胡说！我们老少众大四五百名和尚，往那里搬？</p>

<p>搬出去，却也没处住。”行者听见道：“和尚，没处搬，便着一个出来打样棍！”老和尚叫：“道人你出去与我打个样棍来。”那道人慌了道：“爷爷呀！那等个大扛子，教我去打样棍！”老和尚道：“养军千日，用军一朝。你怎么不出去？”道人说：“那扛子莫说打来，若倒下来，压也压个肉泥！”老和尚道：“也莫要说压，只道竖在天井里，夜晚间走路，不记得啊，一头也撞个大窟窿！”道人说：“师父，你晓得这般重，却教我出去打甚么样棍？”</p>

<p>他自家里面转闹起来，行者听见道：“是也禁不得，假若就一棍打杀一个，我师父又怪我行凶了。且等我另寻一个甚么打与你看看。”忽抬头，只见方丈门外有一个石狮子，却就举起棍来，乒乓一下打得粉乱麻碎。那和尚在窗眼儿里看见，就吓得骨软筋麻，慌忙往床下拱，道人就往锅门里钻，口中不住叫：“爷爷，棍重棍重！禁不得！方便方便！”行者道：“和尚，我不打你。我问你：“这寺里有多少和尚？”僧官战索索的道：“前后是二百八十五房头，共有五百个有度牒的和尚。”行者道：“你快去把那五百个和尚都点得齐齐整整，穿了长衣服出去，把我那唐朝的师父接进来，就不打你了。”僧官道：“爷爷，若是不打，便抬也抬进来。”行者道：“趁早去！”僧官叫：“道人，你莫说吓破了胆，就是吓破了心，便也去与我叫这些人来接唐僧老爷爷来。”</p>

<p>那道人没奈何，舍了性命，不敢撞门，从后边狗洞里钻将出去，径到正殿上，东边打鼓，西边撞钟。钟鼓一齐响处，惊动了两廊大小僧众，上殿问道：“这早还下晚哩，撞钟打鼓做甚？”</p>

<p>道人说：“快换衣服，随老师父排班，出山门外迎接唐朝来的老爷。”那众和尚，真个齐齐整整，摆班出门迎接。有的披了袈裟，有的着了褊衫，无的穿着个一口钟直裰，十分穷的，没有长衣服，就把腰裙接起两条披在身上。行者看见道：“和尚，你穿的是甚么衣服？”和尚见他丑恶，道：“爷爷，不要打，等我说。这是我们城中化的布，此间没有裁缝，是自家做的个一裹穷。”</p>

<p>行者闻言暗笑，押着众僧，出山门下跪下。那僧官磕头高叫道：“唐老爷，请方丈里坐。”八戒看见道：“师父老大不济事，你进去时，泪汪汪，嘴上挂得油瓶。师兄怎么就有此獐智，教他们磕头来接？”三藏道：“你这个呆子，好不晓礼！常言道，鬼也怕恶人哩。”唐僧见他们磕头礼拜，甚是不过意，上前叫：“列位请起。”众僧叩头道：“老爷，若和你徒弟说声方便，不动扛子，就跪一个月也罢。”唐僧叫：“悟空，莫要打他。”行者道：“不曾打，若打，这会已打断了根矣。”那些和尚却才起身，牵马的牵马，挑担的挑担，抬着唐僧，驮着八戒，挽着沙僧，一齐都进山门里去，却到后面方丈中，依叙坐下。众僧却又礼拜，三藏道：“院主请起，再不必行礼，作践贫僧，我和你都是佛门弟子。”僧官道：“老爷是上国钦差，小和尚有失迎接。今到荒山，奈何俗眼不识尊仪，与老爷邂逅相逢。动问老爷：一路上是吃素？是吃荤？我们好去办饭。”三藏道：“吃素。”僧官道：“徒弟，这个爷爷好的吃荤。”行者道：“我们也吃素，都是胎里素。”那和尚道：“爷爷呀，这等凶汉也吃素！”有一个胆量大的和尚，近前又问：“老爷既然吃素，煮多少米的饭方彀吃？”八戒道：“小家子和尚！问甚么！一家煮上一石米。”那和尚都慌了，便去刷洗锅灶，各房中安排茶饭，高掌明灯，调开桌椅，管待唐僧。</p>

<p>师徒们都吃罢了晚斋，众僧收拾了家火，三藏称谢道：“老院主，打搅宝山了。”僧官道：“不敢不敢，怠慢怠慢。”三藏道：“我师徒却在那里安歇？”僧官道：“老爷不要忙，小和尚自有区处。”叫道人：“那壁厢有几个人听使令的？”道人说：“师父，有。”僧官吩咐道：“你们着两个去安排草料，与唐老爷喂马；着几个去前面把那三间禅堂，打扫干净，铺设床帐，快请老爷安歇。”那些道人听命，各各整顿齐备，却来请唐老爷安寝。他师徒们牵马挑担出方丈，径至禅堂门首看处，只见那里面灯火光明，两梢间铺着四张藤屉床。行者见了，唤那办草料的道人，将草料抬来，放在禅堂里面，拴下白马，教道人都出去。三藏坐在中间，灯下两班儿立五百个和尚，都伺候着，不敢侧离。三藏欠身道：“列位请回，贫僧好自在安寝也。”众僧决不敢退。僧官上前吩咐大众：“伏侍老爷安置了再回。”三藏道：“即此就是安置了，都就请回。”众人却才敢散去讫。</p>

<p>唐僧举步出门小解，只见明月当天，叫：“徒弟。”行者、八戒，沙僧都出来侍立。因感这月清光皎洁，玉宇深沉，真是一轮高照，大地分明，对月怀归，口占一首古风长篇。诗云：“皓魄当空宝镜悬，山河摇影十分全。琼楼玉宇清光满，冰鉴银盘爽气旋。万里此时同皎洁，一年今夜最明鲜。浑如霜饼离沧海，却似冰轮挂碧天。别馆寒窗孤客闷，山村野店老翁眠。乍临汉苑惊秋鬓，才到秦楼促晚奁。庾亮有诗传晋史，袁宏不寐泛江船。</p>

<p>光浮杯面寒无力，清映庭中健有仙。处处窗轩吟白雪，家家院宇弄冰弦。今宵静玩来山寺，何日相同返故园？”行者闻言，近前答曰：“师父啊，你只知月色光华，心怀故里，更不知月中之意，乃先天法象之规绳也。月至三十日，阳魂之金散尽，阴魄之水盈轮，故纯黑而无光，乃曰晦。此时与日相交，在晦朔两日之间，感阳光而有孕。至初三日一阳现，初八日二阳生，魄中魂半，其平如绳，故曰上弦。至今十五日，三阳备足，是以团圆，故曰望。至十六日一阴生，二十二日二阴生，此时魂中魄半，其平如绳，故曰下弦。至三十日三阴备足，亦当晦。此乃先天采炼之意。我等若能温养二八，九九成功，那时节，见佛容易，返故田亦易也。诗曰：前弦之后后弦前，药味平平气象全。采得归来炉里炼，志心功果即西天。”那长老听说，一时解悟，明彻真言，满心欢喜，称谢了悟空。沙僧在旁笑道：“师兄此言虽当，只说的是弦前属阳，弦后属阴，阴中阳半，得水之金；更不道水火相搀各有缘，全凭土母配如然。三家同会无争竞，水在长江月在天。”那长老闻得，亦开茅塞。正是理明一窍通千窍，说破无生即是仙。八戒上前扯住长老道：“师父，莫听乱讲，误了睡觉。</p>

<p>这月啊：缺之不久又团圆，似我生来不十全。吃饭嫌我肚子大，拿碗又说有粘涎。他都伶俐修来福，我自痴愚积下缘。我说你取经还满三途业，摆尾摇头直上天！”三藏道：“也罢，徒弟们走路辛苦，先去睡下，等我把这卷经来念一念。”行者道：“师父差了，你自幼出家，做了和尚，小时的经文，那本不熟？却又领了唐王旨意，上西天见佛，求取大乘真典。如今功未完成，佛未得见，经未曾取，你念的是那卷经儿？”三藏道：“我自出长安，朝朝跋涉，日日奔波，小时的经文恐怕生了；幸今夜得闲，等我温习温习。”行者道：“既这等说，我们先去睡也。”他三人各往一张藤床上睡下。长老掩上禅堂门，高剔银缸，铺开经本，默默看念。正是那：楼头初鼓人烟静，野浦渔舟火灭时。毕竟不知那长老怎么样离寺，且听下回分解。</p>
