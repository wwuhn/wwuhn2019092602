<P>On the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit the Devils Rise</P>
<P>Sanzang Meets a Monster in the Black Pine Forest</P>
</div>
<P>The Great Sage was gazing at the Eastern Ocean, sighing sadly at being driven away by the Tang Priest. &#8220;I haven't been this way for five hundred years,&#8221; he said. As he looked at the sea,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Vast were the misty waters,</P>
<P>Boundless the mighty waves.</P>
<P>The vast and misty waters stretched to the Milky Way;</P>
<P>The boundless and mighty waves were linked to the earth's arteries.</P>
<P>The tides came surging,</P>
<P>The waters swirled around.</P>
<P>The surging tides</P>
<P>Roared like the thunder in spring;</P>
<P>The swirling waters</P>
<P>Howled like a summer hurricane.</P>
<P>The blessed ancients riding on dragons</P>
<P>Surely must have frowned as they came and went;</P>
<P>Immortal youths flying on cranes</P>
<P>Certainly felt anxious as they passed above.</P>
<P>There were no villages near the coast,</P>
<P>And scarcely a fishing boat beside the sea.</P>
<P>The waves' crests were like immemorial snows;</P>
<P>The wind made autumn in July.</P>
<P>Wild beasts roamed at will,</P>
<P>Shore birds bobbed in the waves.</P>
<P>There was no fisherman in sight,</P>
<P>And the only sound was the screaming of the gulls.</P>
<P>Though the fish were happy at the bottom of the sea,</P>
<P>Anxiety gripped the wild geese overhead.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>With a spring Monkey leapt over the Eastern Ocean and was soon back at the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. As he brought his cloud down and gazed around him, he saw that all the vegetation on the mountain had gone and the mists had disappeared completely. The peaks had collapsed and the woods were shriveled and dead. Do you know why? It was because when Monkey was taken to the upper world after wrecking the Heavenly Palace, the god Erlang and the Seven Brothers of Meishan had burnt it all down. This made the Great Sage even more miserable than ever. There is a poem in the ancient style about the ruined landscape of the mountain:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I came back to the immortal mountain in tears;</P>
<P>On seeing it, my sorrow is doubled.</P>
<P>I used to think that it was safe from harm,</P>
<P>But now I know that it has been destroyed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If only Erlang had not defeated me;</P>
<P>Curse you for bullying me like that.</P>
<P>I shall dig up the graves of your ancestors,</P>
<P>And not stop at destroying their tombs.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Gone, gone, the mists that filled the sky;</P>
<P>Scattered the winds and clouds that covered the earth.</P>
<P>On the Eastern ridge the tiger's roar is silent.</P>
<P>The ape's howl no more on the Western mountain.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>No sign of hare or fox in the Northern valley;</P>
<P>No shadow of a deer in the Southern ravine.</P>
<P>The blue rock was burnt to a thousand cinders,</P>
<P>The jade-green sands are now just mud.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The lofty pines outside the cave all lean askew;</P>
<P>Few are the cypresses before the cliff.</P>
<P>Cedar, fir, locust, chestnut, juniper, and sandalwood&#8212;all are burnt.</P>
<P>Peach, apricot, plum, pear, and jujube&#8212;gone every one.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>How are the silkworms to be fed without oak and mulberry?</P>
<P>The birds cannot nest with no willow or bamboo.</P>
<P>The crags and boulders have been turned to dust,</P>
<P>The springs have dried up, and weeds grow in the stream-beds.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The earth is black in front of the cliff, and no orchids grow.</P>
<P>Creepers crawl in the brown mud by the path.</P>
<P>Where did the birds of yesterday fly?</P>
<P>To what other mountain did the animals go?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Leopards and pythons dislike this ruined spot;</P>
<P>Cranes and snakes avoid the desolation.</P>
<P>My criminal thoughts of those days past</P>
<P>Brought on the disaster of today.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Great Sage, deep in gloom, heard a sound from a thorny hollow in front of a grassy slope as seven or eight little monkeys leapt out, rushed up to him, and surrounded him kowtowing. &#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; they shouted, &#8220;have you come home today?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why aren't you playing?&#8221; the Handsome Monkey King asked them. &#8220;Why were you all hiding? I was here for ages without seeing a sign of you. Why?&#8221;</P>
<P>Tears poured from the eyes of the other monkeys as they told him, &#8220;Ever since you were taken up to Heaven as a prisoner, Great Sage, the hunters have given us a terrible time. What with their powerful bows and crossbows, their brown falcons and evil hounds, their nets, loops, hooks, and spears, we are all too afraid for our lives to come out and play. We have to hide deep in our caves and keep away from our usual dens. When we're hungry we filch some grass from the hillside, and we drink the fresh spring water from the stream. We've only just heard you, Great Sage, Your Majesty, and come out to greet you. Please, please help us.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Great Sage felt more depressed than ever on hearing this, and he went on to ask, &#8220;How many of you are there left on this mountain?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Only about a thousand of all ages.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In the old days,&#8221; said the Great Sage, &#8220;I had forty-seven thousand fiends. Where have they all gone now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;After you went away the god Erlang set fire to the mountain and most of us were killed in the blaze. Some of us squatted at the bottom of wells, or hid in gullies, or took cover under the iron bridge, and escaped with our lives. When the fire burnt itself out and the smoke cleared we came out to find that there were no more plants or fruit to feed us, making life almost impossible, so half of the survivors went away. The rest of us have been having a very lean time on this mountain, and half of those left have been caught by hunters in the past two years.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do they do that for?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;We hate the very name 'hunters,'&#8220; the other monkeys replied. &#8220;They shoot us with arrows, spear us, poison us, and beat us to death. They take us away to skin us and cut the flesh from our bones before boiling us in soy sauce, steaming us with vinegar, frying us in oil, or stir-cooking us with salt. Then they eat us to help their rice down. Those of us who are caught in nets or loops are taken away alive and made to dance in a ring, act, do somersaults, jump around, play drums and gongs in the street, and make fools of themselves in every possible way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Who's in charge in the cave?&#8221; asked Monkey, now thoroughly angry.</P>
<P>&#8220;Marshals Ma and Liu and Generals Ben and Ba,&#8221; they replied, &#8220;are still in command.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Then tell them that I'm here,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>The junior fiends rushed in to report, &#8220;His Majesty the Great Sage has come home.&#8221; As soon as they heard this Ma, Liu, Ben and Ba rushed out to kowtow and welcome him into the cave.</P>
<P>The Great Sage sat in the middle of it, with his fiendish hosts prostrating themselves before him and asking, &#8220;Why have you come back to your mountain instead of going to the West, Your Majesty? We heard recently that you had come back to life and were escorting the Tang Priest to fetch scriptures from the Western Heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What you don't know, my little ones,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;is that Sanzang can't tell a good man when he sees one. I captured monsters and demons for him all along the way, and I used every one of my magical powers to kill evil spirits for him. But he called me a murderer and wouldn't have me as his disciple any longer. He sent me back here and gave me a letter of dismissal to certify that he'll never employ me again.&#8221;</P>
<P>All the monkeys clapped their hands for joy. &#8220;What luck,&#8221; they said, &#8220;what luck. Now you're home again after being some kind of monk or other, you can be our leader for the next few years.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Lay on some coconut toddy at once to welcome His Majesty back,&#8221; someone ordered.</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the Great Sage, &#8220;don't let's drink. How often do the hunters come to our mountain?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; replied Marshals Ma and Liu, &#8220;they come here in all seasons and harass us for days on end.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Then why haven't they come today?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;They'll be here soon enough,&#8221; replied the marshals.</P>
<P>&#8220;Little ones,&#8221; Monkey ordered, &#8220;you are all to go out, gather those broken cinders that were burnt brittle in the fire, and pile them up. I want twenty to thirty or fifty to sixty in a pile. I have a use for them.&#8221; Like a swarm of bees the little monkeys rushed around making piles all over the place. When Monkey saw them he said, &#8220;Go and hide in the cave, little ones, while I do some magic.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the Great Sage went up to the mountain peak to look around he saw over a thousand men with horses approaching from the South. They were beating drums and gongs, and they all had falcons, hounds, swords or spears. Examining them closely the Monkey King saw that they were most menacing&#8212;fine lads and brave ones:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>With fox skins over their shoulders,</P>
<P>And brocade covering their chests.</P>
<P>Their quivers were full of wolf-fanged arrows,</P>
<P>And carved bows hung by their legs.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The men were like tigers that comb the hills,</P>
<P>The horses like ravine-leaping dragons.</P>
<P>They came in hordes, leading their hounds,</P>
<P>And their arms were packed with falcons.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In thornwood baskets they carried muskets,</P>
<P>And powerful eagles were fastened to their belts.</P>
<P>They had sticky poles by the hundred</P>
<P>And hare forks by the thousand.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Bull-headed fiends blocked the paths with nets,</P>
<P>Demon kings were handling knotted ropes.</P>
<P>As they all roared their ferocious cries</P>
<P>They swarmed over the hill like the stars in the sky.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Great Sage was furious at the sight of them spreading all over his mountain. He made a spell with his fist, muttered the words that went with it, breathed in a mouthful of air from the quarter that the winds came from, and puffed it out again. It was now a hurricane, a splendid hurricane,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Picking up the dust and earth,</P>
<P>Blowing down trees and whole forests.</P>
<P>Waves reared up as high as mountains,</P>
<P>As they beat in thousands upon the shore.</P>
<P>Heaven and Earth were thrown into gloom,</P>
<P>Sun and moon cast into darkness.</P>
<P>One gust shook the pines with a tiger's roar,</P>
<P>Howling like a dragon as it rushed through the bamboos.</P>
<P>Heaven belched angrily through all its orifices,</P>
<P>As flying dirt and stones brought injury and death.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The hurricane that the Great Sage had called up made the piles of broken stone whirl wildly around, and the thousand men with their horses were reduced to a pathetic state.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The aconite was smashed to pieces by the stones,</P>
<P>While the flying dirt injured all the sea horses.</P>
<P>Ginseng and cassia were in panic by the ridge,</P>
<P>And blood stained the cinnabar ground.</P>
<P>The aconite was stranded away from home,</P>
<P>The betel-nut could not return to its own town.</P>
<P>Corpses lay scattered like powder on the mountainside</P>
<P>Leaving the red lady waiting anxiously at home.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As another poem says,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>With men and horses all dead, they could not go back&#8212;</P>
<P>Ghosts and lonely spirits in terrible confusion.</P>
<P>Alas that the martial and heroic generals</P>
<P>Should bleed in the sand for trusting fools.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Bringing his cloud down, the Great Sage clapped his hands and laughed aloud. &#8220;What luck,&#8221; he said, &#8220;what luck. Ever since I submitted to the Tang Priest and became a monk, he was always telling me 'if you do good for a thousand days you still won't have done enough, but if you do ill for one day that will be too much.' How true it was. I killed a few evil spirits when I was with him and he regarded me as a murderer; and now I've come home I've wiped out all these hunters.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Come out, little ones,&#8221; he shouted, and now that the hurricane was over and the Great Sage had called them, the monkeys came bounding out one after the other. &#8220;Go and strip the clothes off the dead hunters at the foot of the Southern mountain,&#8221; he said, &#8220;bring them back here, and wash the bloodstains out. Then you can wear them to keep warm. Push all the corpses into the pool that's ten thousand fathoms deep, and when you've dragged all the dead horses here, strip off their hides to make into boots, and pickle their flesh&#8212;it'll feed us for a long time. I'll give you all those bows, arrows, spears and swords for you to practice your military skills with. And bring me back all those many coloured flags and banners for us to use.&#8221; The monkeys all accepted his orders.</P>
<P>The Great Sage had the banners unstitched and washed, then put them all together as one multicolored banner which bore the legend, Great Sage Equaling Heaven, Restorer of the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit, Recreator of the Water Curtain Cave. They hung the banner from a pole outside the cave, and for days on end he invited demons and held gatherings of the wild beasts. He accumulated provisions, and the word &#8220;monk&#8221; was never mentioned. As he was so generous and his powers so great he was able to go and borrow some sweet magic waters from the dragon kings of the four seas with which to bathe the mountain and make it green again. In front of it he planted elms and willows, and behind it pines and cedars; he also put in peaches, greengages, jujubes, and plums. Thus he led a happy and carefree life.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Let us return to the Tang Priest, who had trusted the word of crafty Nature and dismissed the Mind Ape. He climbed into his saddle, and with Pig leading the way and Friar Sand carrying the luggage they carried on Westwards. After crossing the White Tiger Ridge they saw a range of forested hills of which it could truthfully be said that creepers climbed and twisted among the bluish cypresses and green pines.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciples,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;this rough mountain path is very hard going, and we must be careful in the dense pine forests ahead as I'm afraid there may be evil spirits and monsters.&#8221; At this the idiot Pig summoned up his spirits and, telling Friar Sand to guide the horse, cleared a path with his rake along which he led the Tang Priest into the forest. As they were going along, the venerable Sanzang reined in his horse and said to Pig, &#8220;I'm really starving today. Is there anywhere you could find some food for me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please dismount, master,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;and wait here while I go and find some.&#8221; Sanzang dismounted, while Friar Sand put down his load, took out his begging bowl, and handed it to Pig. &#8220;I'm off,&#8221; said Pig, and when asked by Sanzang where he was going he replied, &#8220;Don't let that bother you. I'll beg you some food even if it's like cutting through ice to get fire, or even if it means squeezing oil out of snow.&#8221;</P>
<P>He traveled West about four miles from the pine forest without meeting anybody. It was indeed a lonely place inhabited only by wolves and tigers. The idiot found the going heavy, and he muttered to himself, &#8220;When Monkey was with us the old priest could have anything he wanted, but now I have to do it all. How true it is that 'you have to keep house to realize how expensive rice and firewood are, and raise sons to understand parental love'. There's nowhere at all to beg on this road.&#8221; By now he felt sleepy after all this walking and he thought, &#8220;If I go back now and tell the old monk that there's nowhere I can beg food, he may not believe I've come this far. I'd better hang around here for another hour or two before reporting back. Oh well, I may as well take a snooze in that grass.&#8221; With that the idiot pillowed his head in the grass and went to sleep. He had only meant to take forty winks and then get up again, not realizing that he was so exhausted by the journey that he would be sound asleep as soon as his head was down.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Let us leave Pig asleep there and return to Sanzang in the forest. As he was feeling anxious and unsettled he said to Friar Sand, &#8220;It's late now. Why isn't Pig back from begging for food?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;you still don't understand him. He's found out that many of these Westerners give food to monks, and with his big belly he won't be bothering about you. He won't be back till he's eaten his fill.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;True,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;If he's greedily stuffing himself somewhere far away we needn't concern ourselves with him. It's getting late and this is no place to spend the night. We must find somewhere to stay.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no rush, master,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;You sit and wait here while I go and find him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;very well. Never mind about the food. It's somewhere for the night that matters.&#8221; Clasping his precious staff, Friar Sand went off through the pine forest in search of Pig.</P>
<P>Sanzang felt thoroughly tired and miserable as he sat alone in the forest, so he summoned up his spirits, leapt to his feet, hid all the luggage in a cache, tethered the horse to a tree, took off his reed hat, and drove his staff into the ground. Then he straightened out his black robes and took a leisurely stroll among the trees to cheer himself up. As he looked at all the wild flowers he did not hear the calls of the birds returning to their nests. The grass was deep and the forest paths were narrow, and in his distraction he lost his way. He had started out to cheer himself up and also to find Pig and Friar Sand; what he did not realize was that they had headed due West while he, after wandering in all directions, was going South. He came out of the forest and looked up to see a dazzling golden light. On closer examination he saw that it was the golden roof of a pagoda whose gleaming in the setting sun. &#8220;What a sad destiny my disciples have,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;When I left the land of the East, I vowed that I would burn incense in every temple I passed, would worship every Buddha statue I saw, and sweep up every pagoda I encountered. Isn't that a golden pagoda gleaming over there? Why didn't we go that way? There's bound to be a monastery at the foot of the pagoda, and the monastery must surely contain monks. Let me have a look. The luggage and the white horse can come to no harm in that uninhabited spot. If there is some suitable place we can all spend the night here when my disciples come back.&#8221;</P>
<P>Alas! The venerable Sanzang was once more the victim of delusion. He strode over to the pagoda, and what he saw was</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A cliff ten thousand fathoms high,</P>
<P>A lofty mountain reaching to the firmament.</P>
<P>Its roots sunk deep into the earth,</P>
<P>Its peak thrust up into the sky.</P>
<P>On either side were trees by the thousand,</P>
<P>While creepers stretched many miles around.</P>
<P>The wind made shadows as it bent the tips of the flowers;</P>
<P>The moon had no root where the waters flowed under the clouds.</P>
<P>A fallen tree spanned a deep ravine,</P>
<P>Withered creepers were knotted round the gleaming peak.</P>
<P>Under the stone bridge,</P>
<P>Ran the water from a spring;</P>
<P>On the sacred altar</P>
<P>The ever-burning lamp was as bright as chalk.</P>
<P>From a distance it looked like the Three Islands of Paradise;</P>
<P>Close to, it resembled the blessed land of Penglai.</P>
<P>Fragrant pine and purple bamboo grew round the mountain brooks,</P>
<P>Magpies, monkeys, crows, and apes roamed the lofty ridge.</P>
<P>Outside the door of a cave</P>
<P>Animals came and went in orderly groups.</P>
<P>Among the trees</P>
<P>Flocks of birds were briefly seen.</P>
<P>Luxuriant grew the green and scented herbs,</P>
<P>As the wild flowers bloomed in all their glory.</P>
<P>This was clearly an evil place</P>
<P>That the deluded priest approached,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sanzang stepped out and was soon at the gate of the pagoda. Seeing a curtain of speckled bamboo hanging inside, he lifted it up and went in. He raised his head and saw an evil monster sleeping on a stone bed. Do you know what he looked like?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A dark blue face,</P>
<P>White fangs,</P>
<P>A huge gaping mouth.</P>
<P>On either side of it were matted hairs</P>
<P>All stained with fat and grease.</P>
<P>The purple tufts of his beard and moustache</P>
<P>Made one think of splayed-out lichee shoots.</P>
<P>His nose was as hooked as a parrot's beak</P>
<P>His eyes as dim as stars in the dawn.</P>
<P>His two fists</P>
<P>Were the size of a monk's begging bowl;</P>
<P>His indigo-blue feet</P>
<P>Were like a pair of logs.</P>
<P>The pale yellow robe that was flung across him</P>
<P>Was grander than a brocade cassock.</P>
<P>The sword in his hand</P>
<P>Gleamed and flashed;</P>
<P>The rock on which he slept</P>
<P>Was exquisite, smooth and flawless.</P>
<P>As a little fiend he had marshaled ant formations,</P>
<P>When a senior demon he had sat in the wasps' headquarters.</P>
<P>At the sight of his awe-inspiring might</P>
<P>All would shout out,</P>
<P>Calling him master.</P>
<P>He had created three men drinking in the moonlight,</P>
<P>And had magicked out of the wind cups of refreshing tea.</P>
<P>Consider his tremendous supernatural powers&#8212;</P>
<P>In the wink of an eyelid</P>
<P>He could be at the ends of the earth.</P>
<P>In wild forests he could sing like a bird;</P>
<P>Deep in the bush he would stay with snakes and tigers.</P>
<P>When an Immortal farms the land it bears white jade;</P>
<P>When a Taoist master tends the fire he produces elixir.</P>
<P>Although this little cave-mouth</P>
<P>Did not lead to the Avichi Hell,</P>
<P>Yet this ferocious monster</P>
<P>Was a bull-headed demon.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sanzang was so terrified at the sight of him that he shrank back, his whole body numb with terror. No sooner had he turned to go than the monster, whose powers really were tremendous, opened a fiendish eye with a golden pupil and shouted, &#8220;Who is that outside the door, little ones?&#8221;</P>
<P>A junior devil poked his head out to look, saw a shaven-headed priest, and ran in to report, &#8220;A monk, Your Majesty. He has a large face and a round head, and his ears hang down to his shoulders. His flesh looks most tender and his skin extremely delicate. He's a very promising monk.&#8221;</P>
<P>The monster cackled and said, &#8220;This is what they call 'a fly landing on a snake's head, or food and clothing presenting themselves to you'. Go and catch him for me, lads, and bring him back here. I'll reward you well.&#8221; The junior demons rushed out after Sanzang like a swarm of bees; and Sanzang, in his alarm, started to run so fast he seemed to fly. But he was so terrified that his legs were soon like numb jelly, and on top of this the path was very uneven and it was twilight in the deep forest. He could not move fast enough, and the junior demons picked him up and carried him back.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A dragon in shallows falls victim to shrimps;</P>
<P>A tiger on the plain can be put upon by dogs.</P>
<P>Although good deeds always run into trouble,</P>
<P>The Tang Priest on his Westward journey has been most unlucky.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The junior devils carried the Tang Priest as far as the bamboo curtain and put him down outside it as they announced with great delight, &#8220;We've brought the monk back, Your Majesty.&#8221; The old demon stole a look and saw that Sanzang, who was holding his head high with dignity, must be a fine monk.</P>
<P>&#8220;So fine a monk,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;must be a superior person, so I mustn't treat him as a nobody. If I don't overawe him he won't submit to me.&#8221; Like a fox pretending to be as awe-inspiring as a tiger, he made his red whiskers bristle, his bloody hair stand on end, and his eyeballs bulge in a glare. &#8220;Bring that monk in,&#8221; he roared.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes sir,&#8221; the other fiends shouted in chorus, pushing Sanzang inside. As the saying goes, &#8220;You have to bow your head under low eaves,&#8221; and Sanzang was obliged to put his hands together and greet him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where do you live, monk?&#8221; the monster asked. &#8220;Where have you come from, and where are you going? Tell me at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am a priest from the Tang country, and I am going to the West on the command of His Majesty the Tang Emperor to ask for holy scriptures. As I was passing your distinguished mountain, I came over to visit the holy men of this pagoda. I did not realize that I would disturb Your Excellency, and I beg you to forgive me. When I return East with the scriptures from the West I shall see to it that your fame will be eternally celebrated.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I thought you must be someone from a superior country,&#8221; said the fiend, bellowing with laughter, &#8220;and as that's who you are, I'm going to eat you up. It was splendid of you to come, splendid&#8212;otherwise we might have let you slip. You were fated to be the food in my mouth, so of course you came rushing here. We'll never let you go; and you'll never escape.&#8221; Then he ordered the junior demons to tie him up. They rushed upon him and bound him tight to a soul-fixing stake.</P>
<P>Holding his sword in his hands, the old fiend asked, &#8220;How many of you are there altogether? You wouldn't have the guts to go to the Western Heaven all by yourself.&#8221; Eyeing the sword in his hand, Sanzang had to answer truthfully.</P>
<P>&#8220;I have two disciples, Your Majesty,&#8221; he said, &#8220;called Pig and Friar Sand. They have both gone begging for food outside the pine forest. Apart from them there is a load of baggage and a white horse that I left in the wood.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;More luck!&#8221; said the fiend. &#8220;Two disciples as well makes three of you, four counting the horse, which is enough for a meal.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We'll go and get 'em,&#8221; the junior fiends said.</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; the old monster said, &#8220;don't go. Lock the front gate. As they've gone begging for food they'll have to find their master for him to eat it, and when they can't find him they're bound to come searching for him here. As the saying goes, 'it's easiest to do business at home.' Just wait and we'll catch them all in good time.&#8221; The junior demons shut the front gate.</P>
<P>We will leave the unlucky Sanzang and return to Friar Sand, who was now three or four miles outside the forest in his search for Pig but had not yet seen any village. As he stood on a hillock looking around him, he heard a voice in the undergrowth; and sweeping the tall grass aside with his staff, he discovered the idiot talking in his sleep. Pig woke up when Friar Sand twisted his ear. &#8220;You idiot,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;who said you could sleep here instead of begging for food as our master told you?&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig, waking up with a start, asked, &#8220;What's the time, brother?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Get up at once,&#8221; replied Friar Sand. &#8220;The master told us two to find somewhere to stay whether we can beg any food or not.&#8221;</P>
<P>Holding his begging bowl and his rake, the drowsy Pig headed straight back with Friar Sand, and when they looked for their master in the wood they could not see him. &#8220;It's all because you didn't come back from begging for food, you idiot,&#8221; said Friar Sand indignantly. &#8220;Master must have been carried off by an evil spirit.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't talk nonsense, brother,&#8221; replied a grinning Pig. &#8220;This forest is a very proper sort of place and couldn't possibly have any evil spirits in it. I expect the old monk got bored sitting here and went off somewhere to look around. Let's go and find him.&#8221; They took the horse's bridle, picked up the shoulder-pole with the luggage, collected Sanzang's hat and staff, and left the pine wood in search of their master.</P>
<P>But Sanzang was not fated to die this time. When the two had been looking for him without success for a while, they saw a shimmering golden light due South of them. &#8220;Blessed indeed are the blessed, brother;&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;Look where the master must be staying. That light is coming from a pagoda, and they would be bound to look after him well. I expect they've laid on a meal and are making him stay to eat it. Let's get a move on and have some of it ourselves.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It certainly can't be anything sinister,&#8221; replied Friar Sand. &#8220;We must go and have a look.&#8221;</P>
<P>As the pair of them arrived at the gates they found them closed. Above the gates they saw a horizontal tablet of white jade on which were carved the words MOON WATERS CAVE, BOWL MOUNTAIN.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;this is no temple. It's an evil spirit's cave. If our master is in there we'll never see him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Never fear,&#8221; replied Pig. &#8220;Tether the horse and mind the luggage while I ask for news of him.&#8221; With that the idiot raised his rake and shouted at the top of his voice. &#8220;Open up, open up.&#8221; The junior devil who was on gate duty opened the gates, and at the sight of the pair of them he rushed inside to report, &#8220;Your Majesty, we're in business.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What sort of business?&#8221; the old monster asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;There are two monks outside the gates,&#8221; the junior demon replied. &#8220;One has a long snout and big ears and the other looks down on his luck, and they are shouting at us to open up.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That means Pig and Friar Sand have come looking for him,&#8221; said the old monster. &#8220;Ha! They were bound to. What brought them here? They look stupid, but I'd better treat them with respect.&#8221; He called for his armor to be put on him, and when the junior demons had brought it and fastened it on, he took his sword in his hand and marched straight out of the cave.</P>
<P>When Pig and Friar Sand, who were waiting outside, saw the ferocious demon come out this is what he looked like:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A blue face, a red beard, and scarlet hair blowing free;</P>
<P>Golden armor dazzling bright.</P>
<P>Around his waist was a belt of cowries,</P>
<P>And his armor was strapped to his chest with cloud-walking cords.</P>
<P>As he stood before the mountain the wind roared;</P>
<P>Mighty were the waves when he roamed across the seas.</P>
<P>A pair of indigo, muscled hands</P>
<P>Held a soul-chasing, life-snatching sword.</P>
<P>If you want to know this creature's name,</P>
<P>Address him as Yellow Robe.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As the old monster Yellow Robe came out through the gates he asked, &#8220;Where are you monks from, and why are you yelling at my gates?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't you recognize me, son?&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;I'm your father. I've been sent by the Great Tang on a mission to the Western Heaven. My master is Sanzang, the Emperor's younger brother. If he's here, send him out at once and save me the trouble of having to smash my way in with this rake.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes indeed,&#8221; laughed the monster, &#8220;there is a Tang Priest in my place. I haven't showed him any discourtesy, and I've laid on a meal of human flesh dumplings for him. Why don't you two come in and have some?&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot would have gone in quite trustingly if Friar Sand had not held him back and said, &#8220;He's luring you in, brother. Besides, when have you ever eaten human flesh?&#8221; The idiot saw the light as last, and he struck at the evil monster's face with his rake. The monster sidestepped and parried with his steel sword. They both showed their magic powers as they leapt up on clouds to continue the fight in mid-air. Friar Sand abandoned the baggage and the white horse and rushed to Pig's aid. It was a fine battle up in the clouds between the two wolfish monks and the evil monster:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the staff was raised it was met by the sword;</P>
<P>The same sword parried the rake's blow.</P>
<P>One devil general displaying his prowess,</P>
<P>A pair of monkish gods revealing their transformations.</P>
<P>The nine-pronged rake was quite magnificent;</P>
<P>The demon-submitting staff was truly terrifying.</P>
<P>They came from before and behind, from left and right,</P>
<P>But Yellow Robe was calm and unafraid.</P>
<P>See how his blade of tempered steel shines like silver;</P>
<P>Great indeed were his magical powers.</P>
<P>Their fighting filled the sky</P>
<P>With mists and clouds;</P>
<P>Amid the mountains</P>
<P>Cliffs crashed and fell.</P>
<P>One was fighting for fame</P>
<P>So how could he stop?</P>
<P>The others, fighting for their master,</P>
<P>Were completely unafraid.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The three of them fought dozens of rounds in mid-air without issue. They were all fighting for their very lives, and nothing could have kept them apart.</P>
<P>If you don't know how they saved the Tang Priest, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>	</div>

<p>花果山群妖聚义</p>
<p>黑松林三藏逢魔</p>
</div>
<p>却说那大圣虽被唐僧逐赶，然犹思念，感叹不已，早望见东洋大海，道：“我不走此路者，已五百年矣！”只见那海水：烟波荡荡，巨浪悠悠。烟波荡荡接天河，巨浪悠悠通地脉。潮来汹涌，水浸湾环。潮来汹涌，犹如霹雳吼三春；水浸湾环，却似狂风吹九夏。乘龙福老，往来必定皱眉行；跨鹤仙童，反复果然忧虑过。近岸无村社，傍水少渔舟。浪卷千年雪，风生六月秋。</p>

<p>野禽凭出没，沙鸟任沉浮，眼前无钓客，耳畔只闻鸥。海底游鱼乐，天边过雁愁。那行者将身一纵，跳过了东洋大海，早至花果山。按落云头，睁睛观看，那山上花草俱无，烟霞尽绝；峰岩倒塌，林树焦枯。你道怎么这等？只因他闹了天宫，拿上界去，此山被显圣二郎神，率领那梅山七弟兄，放火烧坏了。这大圣倍加凄惨，有一篇败山颓景的古风为证，古风云：回顾仙山两泪垂，对山凄惨更伤悲。当时只道山无损，今日方知地有亏。可恨二郎将我灭，堪嗔小圣把人欺。行凶掘你先灵墓，无干破尔祖坟基。满天霞雾皆消荡，遍地风云尽散稀。东岭不闻斑虎啸，西山那见白猿啼？北溪狐兔无踪迹，南谷獐豝没影遗。青石烧成千块土，碧砂化作一堆泥。洞外乔松皆倚倒，崖前翠柏尽稀少。椿杉槐桧栗檀焦，桃杏李梅梨枣了。柘绝桑无怎养蚕？柳稀竹少难栖鸟。峰头巧石化为尘，涧底泉干都是草。崖前土黑没芝兰，路畔泥红藤薜攀。往日飞禽飞那处？当时走兽走何山？</p>

<p>豹嫌蟒恶倾颓所，鹤避蛇回败坏间。想是日前行恶念，致令目下受艰难。</p>

<p>那大圣正当悲切，只听得那芳草坡前、曼荆凹里响一声，跳出七八个小猴，一拥上前，围住叩头，高叫道：“大圣爷爷！今日来家了？”美猴王道：“你们因何不耍不顽，一个个都潜踪隐迹？我来多时了，不见你们形影，何也？”群猴听说，一个个垂泪告道：“自大圣擒拿上界，我们被猎人之苦，着实难捱！怎禁他硬弩强弓，黄鹰劣犬，网扣枪钩，故此各惜性命，不敢出头顽耍，只是深潜洞府，远避窝巢，饥去坡前偷草食，渴来涧下吸清泉。却才听得大圣爷爷声音，特来接见，伏望扶持。”那大圣闻得此言，愈加凄惨，便问：“你们还有多少在此山上？”群猴道：</p>

<p>“老者小者，只有千把。”大圣道：“我当时共有四万七千群妖，如今都往那里去了？”群猴道：“自从爷爷去后，这山被二郎菩萨点上火，烧杀了大半。我们蹲在井里，钻在涧内，藏于铁板桥下，得了性命。及至火灭烟消，出来时，又没花果养赡，难以存活，别处又去了一半。我们这一半，捱苦的住在山中，这两年，又被些打猎的抢了一半去也。”行者道：“他抢你去何干？”群猴道：“说起这猎户可恨！他把我们中箭着枪的，中毒打死的，拿了去剥皮剔骨，酱煮醋蒸，油煎盐炒，当做下饭食用。或有那遭网的，遇扣的，夹活儿拿去了，教他跳圈做戏，翻筋斗，竖蜻蜓，当街上筛锣擂鼓，无所不为的顽耍。”大圣闻此言，更十分恼怒道“洞中有甚么人执事？”群妖道：“还有马流二元帅，奔芭二将军管着哩。”大圣道：“你们去报他知道，说我来了。”那些小妖，撞入门里报道：“大圣爷爷来家了。”那马流奔芭闻报，忙出门叩头，迎接进洞。大圣坐在中间，群怪罗拜于前，启道：“大圣爷爷，近闻得你得了性命，保唐僧往西天取经，如何不走西方，却回本山？”大圣道：“小的们，你不知道，那唐三藏不识贤愚。我为他一路上捉怪擒魔，使尽了平生的手段，几番家打杀妖精，他说我行凶作恶，不要我做徒弟，把我逐赶回来，写立贬书为照，永不听用了。”众猴鼓掌大笑道：“造化！造化！做甚么和尚，且家来，带携我们耍子几年罢！”叫：“快安排椰子酒来，与爷爷接风。”大圣道：“且莫饮酒，我问你那打猎的人，几时来我山上一度？”马流道：“大圣，不论甚么时度，他逐日家在这里缠扰。”</p>

<p>大圣道：“他怎么今日不来？”马流道：“看待来耶。”大圣吩咐：</p>

<p>“小的们，都出去把那山上烧酥了的碎石头与我搬将起来堆着。或二三十个一推，或五六十个一堆，堆着我有用处。”那些小猴都是一窝峰，一个个跳天搠地，乱搬了许多堆集。大圣看了，教：“小的们，都往洞内藏躲，让老孙作法。”</p>

<p>那大圣上了山巅看处，只见那南半边，冬冬鼓响，噹噹锣鸣，闪上有千余人马，都架着鹰犬，持着刀枪。猴王仔细看那些人，来得凶险。好男子，真个骁勇！但见：狐皮苫肩顶，锦绮裹腰胸。袋插狼牙箭，胯挂宝雕弓。人似搜山虎，马如跳涧龙。成群引着犬，满膀架其鹰。荆筐抬火炮，带定海东青。粘竿百十担，兔叉有千根。牛头拦路网，阎王扣子绳，一齐乱吆喝，散撒满天星。大圣见那些人布上他的山来，心中大怒，手里捻诀，口内念念有词，往那巽地上吸了一口气，呼的吹将去，便是一阵狂风。好风！但见：扬尘播土，倒树摧林。海浪如山耸，浑波万迭侵。乾坤昏荡荡，日月暗沉沉。一阵摇松如虎啸，忽然入竹似龙吟。万窍怒号天噫气，飞砂走石乱伤人。大圣作起这大风，将那碎石，乘风乱飞乱舞，可怜把那些千余人马，一个个石打乌头粉碎，沙飞海马俱伤。人参官桂岭前忙，血染朱砂地上。附子难归故里，槟榔怎得还乡？尸骸轻粉卧山场，红娘子家中盼望。有诗为证：人亡马死怎归家？野鬼孤魂乱似麻。可怜抖擞英雄将，不辨贤愚血染沙。</p>

<p>大圣按落云头，鼓掌大笑道：“造化！造化！自从归顺唐僧，做了和尚，他每每劝我话道：千日行善，善犹不足；一日行恶，恶自有余。真有此话！我跟着他，打杀几个妖精，他就怪我行凶，今日来家，却结果了这许多猎户。”叫：“小的们，出来！”那群猴，狂风过去，听得大圣呼唤，一个个跳将出来。大圣道：“你们去南山下，把那打死的猎户衣服，剥得来家洗净血迹，穿了遮寒；把死人的尸首，都推在那万丈深潭里；把死倒的马，拖将来，剥了皮，做靴穿，将肉腌着，慢慢的食用；把那些弓箭枪刀，与你们操演武艺；将那杂色旗号，收来我用。”群猴一个个领诺。</p>

<p>那大圣把旗拆洗，总斗做一面杂彩花旗，上写着“重修花果山复整水帘洞齐天大圣”十四字，竖起杆子，将旗挂于洞外，逐日招魔聚兽，积草屯粮，不题和尚二字。他的人情又大，手段又高，便去四海龙王，借些甘霖仙水，把山洗青了。前栽榆柳，后种松楠，桃李枣梅，无所不备，逍遥自在，乐业安居不题。</p>

<p>却说唐僧听信狡性，纵放心猿，攀鞍上马，八戒前边开路，沙僧挑着行李西行。过了白虎岭，忽见一带林丘，真个是藤攀葛绕，柏翠松青。三藏叫道：“徒弟呀，山路崎岖，甚是难走，却又松林丛簇，树木森罗，切须仔细，恐有妖邪妖兽。”你看那呆子，抖擞精神，叫沙僧带着马，他使钉钯开路，领唐僧径入松林之内。正行处，那长老兜住马道：“八戒，我这一日其实饥了，那里寻些斋饭我吃？”八戒道：“师父请下马，在此等老猎去寻。”</p>

<p>长老下了马，沙僧歇了担，取出钵盂，递与八戒。八戒道：“我去也。”长老问：“那里去？”八戒道：“莫管，我这一去，钻冰取火寻斋至，压雪求油化饭来。”你看他出了松林，往西行经十余里，更不曾撞着一个人家，真是有狼虎无人烟的去处。那呆子走得辛苦，心内沉吟道：“当年行者在日，老和尚要的就有，今日轮到我的身上，诚所谓当家才知柴米价，养子方晓父娘恩，公道没去化处。”却又走得瞌睡上来，思道：“我若就回去，对老和尚说没处化斋，他也不信我走了这许多路。须是再多幌个时辰，才好去回话。也罢，也罢，且往这草科里睡睡。”呆子就把头拱在草里睡下，当时也只说朦胧朦胧就起来，岂知走路辛苦的人，丢倒头，只管齁齁睡起。</p>

<p>且不言八戒在此睡觉，却说长老在那林间，耳热眼跳，身心不安，急回叫沙僧道：“悟能去化斋，怎么这早晚还不回？”沙僧道：“师父，你还不晓得哩，他见这西方上人家斋僧的多，他肚子又大，他管你？只等他吃饱了才来哩。”三藏道：“正是呀，倘或他在那里贪着吃斋，我们那里会他？天色晚了，此间不是个住处，须要寻个下处方好哩。”沙僧道：“不打紧，师父，你且坐在这里，等我去寻他来。”三藏道：“正是，正是。有斋没斋罢了，只是寻下处要紧。”沙僧绰了宝杖，径出松林来找八戒。</p>

<p>长老独坐林中，十分闷倦，只得强打精神，跳将起来，把行李攒在一处，将马拴在树上，取下戴的斗笠，插定了锡杖，整一整缁衣，徐步幽林，权为散闷。那长老看遍了野草山花，听不得归巢鸟噪。原来那林子内都是些草深路小的去处，只因他情思紊乱，却走错了。他一来也是要散散闷。二来也是要寻八戒沙僧。不期他两个走的是直西路，长老转了一会，却走向南边去了。出得松林，忽抬头，见那壁厢金光闪烁，彩气腾腾，仔细看处，原来是一座宝塔，金顶放光。这是那西落的日色，映着那金顶放亮。他道：“我弟子却没缘法哩！自离东土，发愿逢庙烧香，见佛拜佛，遇塔扫塔。那放光的不是一座黄金宝塔？怎么就不曾走那条路？塔下必有寺院，院内必有僧家，且等我走走。这行李、白马，料此处无人行走，却也无事。那里若有方便处，待徒弟们来，一同借歇。”噫！长老一时晦气到了。你看他拽开步，竟至塔边，但见那：石崖高万丈，山大接青霄。根连地厚，峰插天高。两边杂树数千颗，前后藤缠百余里。花映草梢风有影，水流云窦月无根。倒木横担深涧，枯藤结挂光峰。石桥下，流滚滚清泉；台座上，长明明白粉。远观一似三岛天堂，近看有如蓬莱胜境。香松紫竹绕山溪，鸦鹊猿猴穿峻岭。洞门外，有一来一往的走兽成行；树林里，有或出或入的飞禽作队。青青香草秀，艳艳野花开。这所在分明是恶境，那长老晦气撞将来。那长老举步进前，才来到塔门之下，只见一个斑竹帘儿，挂在里面。他破步入门，揭起来，往里就进，猛抬头，见那石床上，侧睡着一个妖魔。你道他怎生模样：青靛脸，白獠牙，一张大口呀呀。两边乱蓬蓬的鬓毛，却都是些胭脂染色；三四紫巍巍的髭髯，恍疑是那荔枝排芽。鹦嘴般的鼻儿拱拱，曙星样的眼儿巴巴。两个拳头，和尚钵盂模样；一双蓝脚，悬崖榾柮枒槎。斜披着淡黄袍帐，赛过那织锦袈裟。拿的一口刀，精光耀映；眠的一块石，细润无瑕。他也曾小妖排蚁阵，他也曾老怪坐蜂衙，你看他威风凛凛，大家吆喝叫一声爷。他也曾月作三人壶酌酒，他也曾风生两腋盏倾茶，你看他神通浩浩，霎着下眼游遍天涯。</p>

<p>荒林喧鸟雀，深莽宿龙蛇。仙子种田生白玉，道人伏火养丹砂。</p>

<p>小小洞门，虽到不得那阿鼻地狱；楞楞妖怪，却就是一个牛头夜叉。</p>

<p>那长老看见他这般模样，唬得打了一个倒退，遍体酥麻，两腿酸软，即忙的抽身便走。刚刚转了一个身，那妖魔他的灵性着实是强大，撑开着一双金睛鬼眼，叫声：“小的们，你看门外是甚么人！”一个小妖就伸头望门外一看，看见是个光头的长老，连忙跑将进去，报道：“大王，外面是个和尚哩，团头大面，两耳垂肩，嫩刮刮的一身肉，细娇娇的一张皮：且是好个和尚！”那妖闻言，呵声笑道：“这叫做个蛇头上苍蝇，自来的衣食。你众小的们，疾忙赶上去，与我拿将来，我这里重重有赏！”</p>

<p>那些小妖，就是一窝蜂，齐齐拥上。三藏见了，虽则是一心忙似箭，两脚走如飞，终是心惊胆颤，腿软脚麻，况且是山路崎岖，林深日暮，步儿那里移得动？被那些小妖，平抬将去，正是：龙游浅水遭虾戏，虎落平原被犬欺。纵然好事多磨障，谁象唐僧西向时？</p>

<p>你看那众小妖，抬得长老，放在那竹帘儿外，欢欢喜喜，报声道：“大王，拿得和尚进来了。”那老妖，他也偷眼瞧一瞧，只见三藏头直上，貌堂堂，果然好一个和尚，他便心中想道：“这等好和尚，必是上方人物，不当小可的，若不做个威风，他怎肯服降哩？”陡然间，就狐假虎威，红须倒竖，血发朝天，眼睛迸裂，大喝一声道：“带那和尚进来！”众妖们，大家响响的答应了一声“是！”就把三藏望里面只是一推。这是既在矮檐下，怎敢不低头！三藏只得双手合着，与他见个礼，那妖道：“你是那里和尚？从那里来？到那里去？”快快说明！”三藏道：“我本是唐朝僧人，奉大唐皇帝敕命，前往西方访求经偈，经过贵山，特来塔下谒圣，不期惊动威严，望乞恕罪。待往西方取得经回东土，永注高名也。”那妖闻言，呵呵大笑道：“我说是上邦人物，果然是你。正要吃你哩，却来的甚好！甚好！不然，却不错放过了？</p>

<p>你该是我口里的食，自然要撞将来，就放也放不去，就走也走不脱！”叫小妖：“把那和尚拿去绑了！”果然那些小妖一拥上前，把个长老绳缠索绑，缚在那定魂桩上。老妖持刀又问道：</p>

<p>“和尚，你一行有几个？终不然一人敢上西天？”三藏见他持刀，又老实说道：“大王，我有两个徒弟，叫做猪八戒、沙和尚，都出松林化斋去了。还有一担行李，一匹白马，都在松林里放着哩。”老妖道：“又造化了！两个徒弟，连你三个，连马四个，彀吃一顿了！”小妖道：“我们去捉他来。”老妖道：“不要出去，把前门关了。他两个化斋来，一定寻师父吃，寻不着，一定寻着我门上。常言道，上门的买卖好做，且等慢慢的捉他。”众小妖把前门闭了。</p>

<p>且不言三藏逢灾。却说那沙僧出林找八戒，直有十余里远近，不曾见个庄村。他却站在高埠上正然观看，只听得草中有人言语，急使杖拨开深草看时，原来是呆子在里面说梦话哩。</p>

<p>被沙僧揪着耳朵，方叫醒了，道：“好呆子啊！师父教你化斋，许你在此睡觉的？”那呆子冒冒失失的醒来道：“兄弟，有甚时候了？”沙僧道：“快起来！师父说有斋没斋也罢，教你我那里寻下住处去哩。”呆子懵懵懂懂的，托着钵盂，拑着钉钯，与沙僧径直回来，到林中看时，不见了师父。沙僧埋怨道：“都是你这呆子化斋不来，必有妖精拿师父也。”八戒笑道：“兄弟，莫要胡说。那林子里是个清雅的去处，决然没有妖精。想是老和尚坐不住，往那里观风去了。我们寻他去来。”二人只得牵马挑担，收拾了斗篷锡杖，出松林寻找师父。</p>

<p>这一回，也是唐僧不该死。他两个寻一会不见，忽见那正南下有金光闪灼，八戒道：“兄弟啊，有福的只是有福。你看师父往他家去了，那放光的是座宝塔，谁敢怠慢？一定要安排斋饭，留他在那里受用。我们还不走动些，也赶上去吃些斋儿。”</p>

<p>沙僧道：“哥啊，定不得吉凶哩。我们且去看来。”二人雄纠纠的到了门前，呀！闭着门哩。只见那门上横安了一块白玉石板，上镌着六个大字：“碗子山波月洞”。沙僧道：“哥啊，这不是甚么寺院，是一座妖精洞府也。我师父在这里，也见不得哩。”八戒道：“兄弟莫怕，你且拴下马匹，守着行李，待我问他的信看。”那呆子举着钯，上前高叫：“开门！开门！”那洞内有把门的小妖开了门，忽见他两个的模样，急抽身跑入里面报道：“大王！买卖来了！”老妖道：“那里买卖？”小妖道：“洞门外有一个长嘴大耳的和尚，与一个晦气色的和尚，来叫门了！”老妖大喜道：“是猪八戒与沙僧寻将来也！噫，他也会寻哩！怎么就寻到我这门上？既然嘴脸凶顽，却莫要怠慢了他。”叫：“取披挂来！”</p>

<p>小妖抬来，就结束了，绰刀在手，径出门来。</p>

<p>却说那八戒、沙僧在门前正等，只见妖魔来得凶险。你道他怎生打扮：青脸红须赤发飘，黄金铠甲亮光饶。裹肚衬腰磲石带，攀胸勒甲步云绦。闲立山前风吼吼，闷游海外浪滔滔。一双蓝靛焦筋手，执定追魂取命刀。要知此物名和姓，声扬二字唤黄袍。那黄袍老怪出得门来，便问：“你是那方和尚，在我门首吆喝？”八戒道：“我儿子，你不认得？我是你老爷！我是大唐差往西天去的！我师父是那御弟三藏。若在你家里，趁早送出来，省了我钉钯筑进去！”那怪笑道：“是，是，是有一个唐僧在我家。我也不曾怠慢他，安排些人肉包儿与他吃哩。你们也进去吃一个儿，何如？”这呆子认真就要进去，沙僧一把扯住道：</p>

<p>“哥啊，他哄你哩，你几时又吃人肉哩？”呆子却才省悟，掣钉钯，望妖怪劈脸就筑。那怪物侧身躲过，使钢刀急架相迎。两个都显神通，纵云头，跳在空中厮杀。沙僧撇了行李白马，举宝杖，急急帮攻。此时两个狠和尚，一个泼妖魔，在云端里，这一场好杀，正是那：杖起刀迎，钯来刀架。一员魔将施威，两个神僧显化。九齿钯真个英雄，降妖伐诚然凶咤。没前后左右齐来，那黄袍公然不怕。你看他蘸钢刀晃亮如银，其实的那神通也为广大。只杀得满空中雾绕云迷、半山里崖崩岭咋。一个为声名，怎肯干休？一个为师父，断然不怕。他三个在半空中，往往来来，战经数十回合，不分胜负。各因性命要紧，其实难解难分。</p>

<p>毕竟不知怎救唐僧，且听下回分解。
