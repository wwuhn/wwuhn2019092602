<P>Zhu Bajie Helps to Defeat a Demon King</P>
<P>Monkey's Third Attempt to Borrow the Fan</P>
</div>
<P>The story tells how the Bull Demon King caught up with the Great Sage Sun and saw him looking very cheerful as he went along with the plantain fan over his shoulder. &#8220;So the macaque has also tricked the art of using the fan out of her,&#8221; the demon king thought. &#8220;If I ask him for it back to his face he's bound to refuse, and if he fans me with it and sends me sixty thousand miles away that would be just what he wants. Now I know that the Tang Priest is sitting waiting by the main road. When I was an evil spirit in the old days I used to know his second disciple the Pig Spirit. I think I'll turn myself into a double of the Pig Spirit and play a trick back on him. That macaque will no doubt be so pleased with himself that he won't really be on his guard.&#8221; The splendid demon king could also do seventy-two transformations and his martial skills were on a par with those of the Great Sage: it was just that he was rather more clumsily built, was less quick and penetrating, and not so adaptable.</P>
<P>First he hid the swords then he said the words of the spell, turned himself into the exact likeness of Pig, went down, and met Monkey face to face. &#8220;I'm here, brother,&#8221; he called.</P>
<P>The Great Sage was indeed delighted. As the ancient saying goes, a cat that's won a fight is more pleased with himself than a tiger. Monkey was so confident of his powers that he did not bother to investigate why the new arrival was here, but seeing that he looked like Pig, called out, &#8220;Where are you going brother?&#8221;</P>
<P>The Bull Demon King made up an answer on the spot: &#8220;You'd been away for so long that the master wondered if the Bull Demon King's magic powers were too much for you and you couldn't get the treasure. So he sent me to meet you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There was no need to worry,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I've already got it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How did you manage that?&#8221; the Bull Demon King asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Old Bull and I fought over a hundred rounds without either of us getting the upper hand till he broke off the fight and went to the bottom of the Green Wave Pool in Ragged Rock Mountain for a banquet with a whole lot of lesser dragons and dragons. I tailed-him there, turned into a crab, stole the water-averting golden-eyed beast, made myself look like him, and went to the Plantain Cave to trick Raksasi, She as good as married me on the spot and I conned it out of her.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You had to go to a lot of trouble, brother,&#8221; the Bull Demon King replied. &#8220;Can I hold the fan?&#8221; Not realizing that this Pig was an impostor, or even considering the possibility, the Great Sage Sun handed him the fan.</P>
<P>Now the Bull Demon King knew the secret of making the fan shrink or grow, and as soon as he had the fan in his hands he made a spell with them that nobody could see, shrunk it back to the size of an apricot leaf, and reverted to his true form. &#8220;Bloody macaque,&#8221; he swore, &#8220;do you know who I am now?&#8221; As soon as he saw this Monkey regretted making so terrible a mistake.</P>
<P>With a cry of anguish he stamped his feet and yelled, &#8220;Aagh! After all these years I've been hunting wild geese a gosling has pecked out my eye!&#8221; He was now leaping around in a thunderous fury, and he took a crack at the Bull Demon King's head with his iron cudgel. The demon king then fanned him with the fan, not realizing that the Great Sage had inadvertently swallowed the wind-fixing pill he had in his mouth when he turned himself into a tiny insect to go into Raksasi's stomach. This had made all his entrails, his skin and his bones so solid and firm that no matter how hard the Bull Demon King fanned he could not move him. This alarmed the Bull Demon King, who put the treasure in his mouth and fought back, swinging a sword in each hand. The two of them fought a splendid battle up in mid-air:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Great Sage Equaling Heaven,</P>
<P>The Bull Demon King of evil,</P>
<P>All for the sake of a plantain-leaf fan.</P>
<P>When they met each showed his powers;</P>
<P>The careless Great Sage got the fan by a trick,</P>
<P>But allowed the Bull King to take it back.</P>
<P>One mercilessly raised the golden cudgel,</P>
<P>The other wielded with skill his blue-tipped swords.</P>
<P>The mighty Great Sage belched out coloured mists</P>
<P>While the evil Bull King breathed brilliant lights.</P>
<P>Well matched in courage,</P>
<P>Both of them wicked,</P>
<P>They gnashed and ground their teeth in terrible wrath.</P>
<P>Heaven and earth were darkened by the dust they kicked up;</P>
<P>Gods and ghosts alike hid from the flying stones.</P>
<P>&#8220;How dare you try to turn a trick against me!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll get you for what my wife promised you!&#8221;</P>
<P>Coarse was their language and fierce were their tempers.</P>
<P>&#8220;For tricking my wife you deserve to die.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When I sue you the sentence will surely be death.&#8221;</P>
<P>The cunning Great Sage Equaling Heaven,</P>
<P>The murderous Strongarm Demon King:</P>
<P>Both of them only wanting to fight,</P>
<P>Neither of them willing to pause and discuss.</P>
<P>Equal the effort of swords and of cudgel;</P>
<P>Had either relaxed he'd have gone straight to Hell.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story now tells not of those two locked in their struggle but of the Tang Priest sitting by the road and finding the heat unbearable. He was also very anxious and thirsty.</P>
<P>&#8220;May I ask you,&#8221; he said to the local deity, &#8220;what that Bull Demon King's powers are like?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He has very great magic,&#8221; the local god replied, &#8220;and his dharma powers are unlimited. He and the Great Sage Sun are well matched.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong is a very good traveler,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;He can normally go six or seven hundred miles and back in an instant. Why has he been away all day? I'm sure he must be fighting the Bull Demon King.&#8221; With that he called for Pig and Friar Sand and asked, &#8220;Which of you will go to meet your elder brother? If he is up against an enemy you will have to help him in the fight, get the fan, and come back. I am very impatient to cross these mountains and continue along our way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's getting late,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;and I'd like to go to meet him. The only thing is that I don't know the way to Mount Thunder Piled.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But I do,&#8221; the local god said. &#8220;Tell the Curtain-lifting General to keep your master company while you and I go there.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang was delighted. &#8220;I am most grateful to you for going to such trouble,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I shall thank you again when you have succeeded.&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig then summoned up his spirits, tightened the belt round his black brocade tunic, and took his rake in his hands as he rose up on his cloud with the local god and headed due East. As they were going along they heard great shouts and were buffeted by strong winds. Stopping his cloud for a good look he saw that it was all caused by Monkey and the Bull Demon King fighting.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why don't you join in, Marshal Tian Peng?&#8221; the local deity asked. &#8220;What are you waiting for?&#8221;</P>
<P>At that the idiot brandished his rake and said with a great shout, &#8220;Brother, I'm coming.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Idiot,&#8221; said Monkey bitterly, &#8220;you've ruined things for me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But the master told me to come to meet you,&#8221; Pig protested. &#8220;He asked the local god to guide me as I don't know the way. That's why I'm a bit late. How can you say I've ruined things for you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm not angry with you for being late,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;It's this damned bull who's a thorough disgrace. I'd got the fan off Raksasi, but he turned himself into your double and came to meet me. I was so pleased to see you that I passed him the fan. He turned back into himself and we've been fighting it out ever since. That's why I said you'd ruined things for me.&#8221;</P>
<P>This news put Pig into a flaming temper. Raising his rake he shouted abuse to the Bull Demon King's face: &#8220;I'll get you, you pox-ridden bag of blood! I'll get you for pretending to be me, your own ancestor, to trick my brother and stir up trouble between us.&#8221;</P>
<P>Watch as he starts lashing out wildly with the rake. The Bull Demon King, who had been fighting Monkey all day, was tiring, and he also realized that he would never be able to withstand the onslaught of Pig's rake, so he fled in defeat. But his way was blocked by a force of spirit soldiers led by the local god of the Fiery Mountains.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wait, Strongarm King,&#8221; the local deity said. &#8220;All the gods and heavens are protecting Tang Sanzang on his journey West to fetch the scriptures. The Three Worlds all know about him, and the Ten Directions are supporting him. Please lend him your plantain fan to blow out the flames so that he can cross the mountains without danger or disaster. Otherwise Heaven will hold you criminally responsible and you're bound to be executed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You haven't looked into the rights and wrongs of this at all,&#8221; King Demon Bull replied. &#8220;That damned ape has done one evil thing after another: he's stolen my son, bullied my concubine, and defrauded my wife. I wish I could swallow him whole and turn him into shit to feed to the dogs. I'll never lend him my treasure.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before the words were all out of his mouth Pig had caught up with him and was saying abusively, &#8220;I'll get you, you poxy bull. The fan or your life!&#8221; The Bull Demon King had to turn round to fight Pig off with his swords while the Great Sage Monkey wielded his cudgel to help him. It was a fine fight they had there:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A boar turned spirit,</P>
<P>A bull become monster.</P>
<P>A monkey who had robbed Heaven and found the Way.</P>
<P>Dharma-nature can always overcome what has been created;</P>
<P>Earth must be used to combine with the prime cause.</P>
<I>
<P>Pointed and sharp were the nine teeth of the rake;
</I>
<P>Flexible and keen were the two sword blades.</P>
<P>The movements of the iron cudgel dominated the fray;</P>
<P>The local god formed the cinnabar head.</P>
<P>The three of them struggled to overcome,</P>
<P>Each of them scheming to give play to his powers.</P>
<P>Metal money is best at making the bull draw the plough;</P>
<P>If the boar goes in the oven, wood is finished.</P>
<P>Unless the heart is in it the Way cannot be completed;</P>
<P>To keep the spirit controlled the monkey must be tied up.</P>
<P>Amid wild shouts and desperate pleas</P>
<P>The three types of weapon whistled through the air.</P>
<P>There was no kindness in the blows of rake and sword;</P>
<P>The gold-banded cudgel rose for good reason.</P>
<P>Their fight put out the stars and dimmed the moon;</P>
<P>The sky was filled with a cold, dark dreary fog.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The demon king fought hard and courageously for mastery, falling back all the while. When the dawn came after a whole night of battle there was still no victor, and in front of them now was the entrance to the Cloud-touching Cave on Mount Thunder Piled. The ear-splitting noise that the three of them, the local god and the spirit soldiers were making alarmed Princess Jade, who sent her serving girls to see who was causing the din.</P>
<P>The little demons on the doors came in to report, &#8220;It's our master. He's fighting the man with a face like a thunder god, another monk with a long snout and big ears, and the local god of the Fiery Mountains and his men.&#8221; The moment Princess Jade heard this she ordered the senior and junior officers of the guard to take their swords and spears and help their lord.</P>
<P>&#8220;Good to see you,&#8221; said the Bull Demon King with delight, &#8220;good to see you.&#8221; All the demons rushed wildly into the attack. It was more than Pig could cope with and he fled in defeat, trailing his rake behind him. The Great Sage sprang aloft out of the multiple encirclement on a somersault cloud; the spirit soldiers broke and ran. Old Bull led his host of demons back to the cave in victory and the doors were shut tightly behind them.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;He's tough, damn him,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;He started fighting me at about four yesterday afternoon and we were nowhere near a result when you two came along to help last night. He fought for half a day and a whole night without showing any sign of tiring. And that bunch of little devils who came out just now were a rough lot too. Now he's shut the doors of his cave and won't come out. What are we to do?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It was about ten yesterday morning when you left the master, brother,&#8221; Pig said, &#8220;so why was it four in the afternoon when you started fighting him? What were you doing for the six hours in between?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I reached this mountain soon after I left you,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and saw a woman. When I questioned her she turned out to be his favorite concubine Princess Jade. I gave her a bit of a fright with my cudgel, so she fled into the cave and sent her Bull Demon King out. He and I swapped a few insults then started fighting. We'd been at it for a couple of hours when someone came to invite him to a banquet. I tailed him to the bottom of the Green Wave Pool on Ragged Rock Mountain and turned into a crab to do a little spying. Then I stole his water-averting golden-eyed beast and changed myself into the Bull Demon King's double to go back to the Plantain Cave on Mount Turquoise Cloud, where I conned Raksasi into giving me the fan. I went outside to try the magic spell out on the fan and made it grow, but I didn't know how to make it shrink again. As I was walking along with it on my shoulder he turned himself into your spitting image and tricked it back off me again. That's how I wasted six hours.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As the saying goes,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;it's just like a boatful of beancurd sinking: it came out of the wet and it disappeared into the wet. Easy come, easy go, But how are we going to take our master across the mountains if we're having so hard a time getting the fan? We'll just have to go back and make a bloody detour.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't get impatient, Great Sage,&#8221; the local god said, &#8220;and don't try to be lazy, Marshal Tian Peng. If you make a detour that will mean leaving the straight and narrow: you'll never cultivate your conduct that way. As the old saying goes, 'In walking never take a short cut.' You mustn't talk about detours. Your master is waiting by the main road, desperate for your success.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said Monkey, his resolve stiffened, &#8220;don't talk nonsense, idiot. The local deity is right. As for that Bull Demon King, we'll have to&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Straggle for mastery,</P>
<P>Use our powers,</P>
<P>Until we can make the whole earth change.</P>
<P>Since coming to the West he has never met a rival:</P>
<P>The Bull King was originally the mind-ape transformed.</P>
<P>Only today do the sources flow:</P>
<P>We must hold out till we borrow the fan.</P>
<P>Put out the flames in the cool of the dawn,</P>
<P>Smash through obstinate emptiness to visit the Buddha.</P>
<P>When all is fulfilled we will rise to heavenly bliss,</P>
<P>And all go to the assembly under the Dragon-flower Tree.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>These words braced Pig's spirits too, and eagerly he said,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes, yes!</P>
<P>Go, go, go!</P>
<P>Never mind what the Bull King's powers are,</P>
<P>Wood grows in the nor'nor'west and is matched with a pig;</P>
<P>The bull-calf will be led back to the earth.</P>
<P>Metal was born in West sou'west and was an ape,</P>
<P>Without any conflict or conquest and full of peace.</P>
<P>We must use the plantain leaf as if it were water</P>
<P>To put out the flames and bring harmony.</P>
<P>Hard work by night and day with never a rest</P>
<P>Will lead us to success and the Ullambana feast.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The two of them led the local deity and his spirit soldiers forward, then battered the doors of the Cloud-touching Cave to pieces with the rake and the cudgel. This so terrified the guard commanders that they rushed inside to report, &#8220;Your Majesty, Sun Wukong's brought his troops here and has smashed down our front doors.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Bull Demon King was just then telling Princess Jade what had happened and feeling thoroughly fed up with Monkey. The news of the front doors being smashed made him beside himself with fury, so he put his armor on immediately and went outside with his iron mace in his hands shouting abusively, &#8220;Damned macaque! You must think you're a very big shot indeed, coming here to play the hooligan and smash down my front door.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Old skinflint,&#8221; retorted Pig, going forward, &#8220;who do you think you are, trying to put other people in their place? Don't move! Take this!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Idiot!&#8221; the Bull Demon King replied. &#8220;Chaff-guzzler! You're not worth bothering with. Tell that monkey to come here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't know what's good for you, cud-chewer,&#8221; called Monkey. &#8220;Yesterday you were still my sworn brother, but today we're enemies. Watch this carefully!&#8221; The Bull Demon King met their onslaught with spirit, and the ensuing fight was even finer than the one before. The three heroes were locked in a melee. What a battle!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Rake and iron cudgel showing their might,</P>
<P>Leading the spirit soldiers to attack the ancient beast.</P>
<P>The beast displayed his terrible strength when fighting alone,</P>
<P>Reviving his powers that rivaled those of Heaven.</P>
<P>The rake hit hard,</P>
<P>The mace struck,</P>
<P>The iron cudgel showed its heroic powers.</P>
<P>The three weapons rang against each other,</P>
<P>Blocking and parrying, never giving way.</P>
<P>One said he was the champion,</P>
<P>Another claimed, &#8220;I am the best.&#8221;</P>
<P>The earth soldiers who were watching could hardly tell them apart.</P>
<P>As wood and earth were locked in combat.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why won't you lend us the plantain fan?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You had the effrontery to mistreat my wife,</P>
<P>To ruin my son and terrify my concubine.</P>
<P>I haven't punished you for all of that yet,</P>
<P>And now you harass us and beat down my doors.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Be on your guard against the As-You-Will cudgel:</P>
<P>A touch of it will tear your skin open.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Mind you avoid the teeth of my rake:</P>
<P>One blow, and nine wounds all gush blood.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Bull Monster fearlessly gave play to his might,</P>
<P>Wielding his mace with skill and with cunning.</P>
<P>Their movements turned the rain clouds upside-down,</P>
<P>As each of them snorted out his mists and winds.</P>
<P>This was indeed a battle to the death,</P>
<P>As they fought it out together with hatred in their hearts.</P>
<P>Taking new stances,</P>
<P>Offering openings high and low,</P>
<P>They attacked and they parried with never a mistake.</P>
<P>The two brother disciples were united in their efforts;</P>
<P>The solitary mace showed its might alone.</P>
<P>They battled from dawn till eight in the morning</P>
<P>Till the Bull Demon had to abandon the fight.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>With death in their hearts and no thought of survival the three of them fought another hundred or so rounds till Pig took advantage of Monkey's miraculous powers to put all his brute strength into a rain of blows from his rake that were more than the Bull Demon King could withstand. He turned and fled defeated back to his cave, only to find the entrance blocked by the local god and his spirit troops.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where do you think you're going, Strongarm King?&#8221; the local god shouted. &#8220;We're here.&#8221; As he could not get into his cave the Bull Demon King fled, only to be pursued by Pig and Monkey. In his panic the Bull Demon King tore off his helmet and armor, threw away his mace, shook himself, turned into a swan and flew away. Monkey looked around and said with a grin, &#8220;Pig, Old Bull's gone.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot had not the faintest idea of what had happened and neither had the local god as they looked all around and aimlessly searched Mount Thunder Piled. &#8220;Isn't that him flying up there?&#8221; said Monkey, pointing.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's a swan,&#8221; Pig replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;it's what Old Bull turned himself into.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So what are we going to do about it?&#8221; the local god asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;You two charge in there, wipe all the demons out without quarter and tear down his den,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;That will cut off his retreat while I go and match transformations with him.&#8221; We shall say no more of Pig and the local god smashing their way into the cave as they had been instructed.</P>
<P>Putting away his gold-banded cudgel and saying the words of a spell while making the necessary hand movements, Monkey shook himself and turned into a vulture who soared up into the clouds with his wings beating noisily, then swooped down on the swan, seizing its neck and gouging at its eyes. Realizing that this was Sun Wukong transformed the Bull Demon King braced himself and turned into a golden eagle who gouged, back at the vulture. Then Monkey turned into a black phoenix to chase the eagle, only to be recognized by the Bull King, who turned into a white crane and flew off South with a loud call. Monkey stopped, braced his feathers, and turned into a red phoenix, who called loudly too. At the sight of the phoenix, the king of all the birds whom no bird dared treat with disrespect, the white crane swooped down beside the precipice with a beat of his wings, shook himself, and turned into a river-deer grazing in a timid, stupid way at the foot of the cliff. Monkey spotted him, came swooping down too, and turned into a hungry tiger that came running after the river-deer, swishing his tail hungrily. The demon king had to move fast as he transformed himself into a huge leopard with spots like golden coins who turned to savage the hungry tiger. Seeing this, Monkey faced the wind, shook himself, and turned into a golden-eyed lion with a voice like thunder, a brazen head and an iron brow. He spun round to devour the leopard, at which the Bull Demon King immediately became a giant bear that ran after the lion. Monkey then rolled himself up and became an elephant with tusks shaped like bamboo shoots, and a trunk like a python that he stretched out to wrap round the bear.</P>
<P>The Bull Demon King chuckled and switched back into his own original shape as a great white bull with a craggy head and flashing eyes. Each of his horns was like an iron pagoda, and his teeth were rows of sharp swords. He was about ten thousand feet long from head to tail and stood eight thousand feet high at the shoulder.</P>
<P>&#8220;What are you going to do to me now, damned macaque?&#8221; he shouted to Brother Monkey at the top of his voice; at which Monkey too reverted to his own form, pulled out his gold-banded cudgel, bowed forward and shouted &#8220;Grow!&#8221; He then grew to be a hundred thousand feet tall with a head like Mount Taishan, eyes like the sun and moon, a mouth like a pool of blood and teeth like doors. He raised his iron cudgel and struck at the Bull Demon King's head; and the Bull Demon King hardened his head and charged Monkey with his horns. This was a ridge-rocking, mountain-shaking, heaven-scaring, earth-frightening battle, and there is a poem to prove it that goes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Way grows by one foot, the demon by ten thousand;</P>
<P>The cunning mind-ape puts him down by force.</P>
<P>If the Fiery Mountains' flames are to be put out,</P>
<P>The precious fan must blow them cool.</P>
<P>The yellow-wife is determined to protect the primal ancient;</P>
<P>The mother of wood is set on wiping out the demons.</P>
<P>When the Five Elements are harmonized they return to the true achievement;</P>
<P>Evil and dirt are refined away as they travel to the West.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The two of them gave such a great display of their magic powers as they fought on the mountain that they alarmed all the deities, the Gold-headed Protector, the Six Jias, the Six Dings and the Eighteen Guardians of the Faith, who were passing through the air, came to surround the demon king. He was not in the least afraid as he butted to East and West with his straight, shining, iron horns, and lashed to North and South with his strong and hairy tail. Sun Wukong stood up to him head on while all the other gods surrounded him till in his despair the Bull Demon King rolled on the ground, turned back into his usual form, and headed for the Plantain Cave. Monkey too put away his magical form and joined in the chase with all the gods, but once in the cave the demon king shut the doors fast. The gods then threw a watertight encirclement around Mount Turquoise Cloud. Just when they were all about to storm the doors they heard the shouts of Pig arriving with the local god and his spirit soldiers.</P>
<P>&#8220;How are things in the Cloud-touching Cave?&#8221; Monkey asked, greeting him.</P>
<P>&#8220;I finished off Old Bull's woman with one blow from my rake,&#8221; grinned Pig, &#8220;and when I stripped her I found she was a jade-faced fox spirit. Her demons were all donkeys, mules, bulls, badgers, foxes, raccoon dogs, river-deer, goats, tigers, elk, deer and things like that. We killed the lot of them and burnt down all the buildings in the cave. The local god tells me he's got another woman who lives here, so we've come here to wipe her out too.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've done well, brother,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Congratulations. I tried competing with Old Bull in transformations, but I couldn't beat him. He turned into a simply enormous white bull, and I made myself as big as heaven and earth. We were just battling it out when all the gods came down and surrounded him. After a long time he turned back into himself and went into the cave.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Is this Plantain Cave?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes yes,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;Raksasi's in here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Then why don't we storm the place and wipe the lot of them out to get the fan?&#8221; said Pig, his blood still up. &#8220;Are we going to let the two of them live to be any older and wiser and love each other with tender passion?&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid idiot then summoned up his strength to bring his rake down on the doors so hard that doors, rock-face and all collapsed with a mighty rumble. The serving girls rushed inside to report, &#8220;Your Majesty, someone's smashed the doors in and we don't know who he is.&#8221; The Bull Demon King himself had just run panting in and was still telling Raksasi about his fight with Monkey for the fan when he heard this report, which made him very angry indeed.</P>
<P>At once he spat out the fan and gave it to Raksasi, who took it in her hands and said tearfully, &#8220;Your Majesty, give the macaque the fan if he'll call his troops off.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wife,&#8221; the Bull Demon King replied, &#8220;it may only be a little thing in itself, but I hate and loathe him. Wait here while I have it out with him again.&#8221; Once more the demon put on his armor, chose another pair of swords, and went out to find Pig smashing the doors down with his rake. Without a word Old Bull raised his swords and cut at Pig's head. Pig parried with his rake and fell back a few paces till he was outside the doors, where Monkey swung his cudgel at the Bull Demon King's head. The Bull Monster then mounted a storm wind and sprang away from the cave to fight Monkey once more on Mount Turquoise Cloud. All the gods surrounded him, while the local god's soldiers joined in the fray from either side. It was a splendid fight:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Mists obscured the world,</P>
<P>Fog shrouded heaven and earth.</P>
<P>A whistling evil wind sent sand and pebbles rolling;</P>
<P>Towering wrath had the ocean's waves breaking.</P>
<P>With a newly-sharpened pair of swords,</P>
<P>And a body encased in armor once more,</P>
<P>His hatred was deeper than the sea,</P>
<P>And loathing made his fury greater than ever.</P>
<P>In his pursuit of glory the Great Sage Equaling Heaven</P>
<P>No longer regarded the other as an old friend.</P>
<P>Pig was using his might to obtain the fan</P>
<P>While the gods and protectors tried to capture the Bull.</P>
<P>Neither of the Bull King's hands could rest</P>
<P>As he blocked to left and right with heavenly skill.</P>
<P>Birds folded their wings, unable to fly past;</P>
<P>Fish stopped leaping and sank to the bottom.</P>
<P>Ghosts wept, gods howled; the earth and sky were dark;</P>
<P>Dragons and tigers were terrified and the sun was dimmed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Bull Demon King fought over fifty rounds for all he was worth till he abandoned the field and fled North, unable to hold out any longer. He was soon blocked by the Vajrapani Bofa from the Hidden Demon Cave on Mount Wutai whose magical powers were very extensive. &#8220;Bull Monster,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;Where are you going? I have been commanded by the Lord Sakyamuni Buddha to spread out heaven-and-earth nets and arrest you here.&#8221;</P>
<P>As he spoke the Great Sage, Pig and all the gods caught up. In his desperation the demon king turned and fled South only to find his way blocked by the Vajrapani Shenzhi of the Cave of Cool Purity on Mount Emei, who shouted, &#8220;I am here on the Buddha's orders to take you.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Bull Demon King was now so terrified and exhausted that he turned and fled East, only to be blocked by the Vairocana monk, the Vajrapani Dali of Mo'er Cave on Mount Sumeru, who shouted, &#8220;Where are you going, Old Bull? I am on a secret mission from the Tathagata to catch you.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Bull Demon King withdrew in terror once more, this time to the West, where he came up against the imperishable king, the Vajrapani Yongzhu from the Golden Brightness Ridge on Mount Kunlun, shouting, &#8220;Where are you going, damn you? I have been personally instructed by the venerable Buddha of the Thunder Monastery in the Western Heaven to cut off your escape this way. Nobody will let you pass.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Old Bull was now trembling with fear, but it was too late for regrets. On all sides he was surrounded by the Buddha's troops and heavenly generals. It really was as if he were caught in a high net from which there was no escape. In his despair he heard Monkey coming after him at the head of his forces, so he sprang on his cloud and went up.</P>
<P>At just that moment Heavenly King Li the Pagoda-carrier was encamped in the sky with Prince Nezha, the Fish-bellied Yaksa and the Mighty Miracle God.</P>
<P>&#8220;Not so fast,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;not so fast. I am here on the mandate of the Jade Emperor to exterminate you.&#8221; In his extremity the Bull Demon King shook himself, turned back into the giant white bull, and tried to gore the Heavenly King with his iron horns, while the Heavenly King hacked at him with his sword. Soon Brother Monkey arrived.</P>
<P>&#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; Prince Nezha shouted at the top of his voice, &#8220;I can't greet you properly as I'm in armor. Yesterday my father and I went to see the Tathagata Buddha, who sent a note to the Jade Emperor. It said that the Tang Priest was held up by the Fiery Mountains and that you couldn't subdue the Bull Demon King, Great Sage. The Jade Emperor then ordered my father to bring his forces here to help.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But this damned creature's magical powers are tremendous,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and he's turned himself into this. What are we going to do about him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Have no doubts,&#8221; replied Nezha with a smile. &#8220;Watch me catch him.&#8221;</P>
<P>The prince then shouted, &#8220;Change!&#8221; gave himself three heads and six arms, and took a flying leap upon the Bull Demon King's back. With one swing of his demon-beheading sword he had the bull's head off before he even realized he had done it. The Heavenly King threw down his sword and went to meet Monkey. But another head grew out from the Bull Demon King's throat, its mouth breathing black vapors and its eyes flashing golden light. Nezha cut again, but as the head fell a new one appeared. Nezha's sword cut a dozen heads off and a dozen new heads immediately grew again. Nezha then hung his fire-wheel on the bull's horns, blew on the magic fire, and made it blaze so fiercely that the Bull Demon King bellowed in desperate pain, shaking his head and tail and trying for all he was worth to escape.</P>
<P>Just when he was about to do another transformation and get away his true image was fixed in Heavenly King Li's demon-revealing mirror. Now he could make no more changes and he had no way of escape.</P>
<P>He could only call out, &#8220;Spare my life! I wish to be converted to the Buddhist faith.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you value your life, hand the fan over at once,&#8221; said Nezha. &#8220;My wife is looking after it,&#8221; the Bull Demon King replied.</P>
<P>Hearing this reply, Nezha undid his demon-binding rope and slipped it round his neck, then took him by the nose, ran the rope through it, and led him along by hand. Monkey meanwhile gathered together the four vajrapanis, the Six Dings, the Six Jias, the Guardians of the Faith, Heavenly King Li, the Mighty Miracle God, Pig, the local god and the spirit soldiers to crowd around the white bull and lead him back to the entrance to the Plantain Cave.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wife,&#8221; Old Bull called, &#8220;bring the fan out and save my life.&#8221; As soon as she heard this Raksasi took off her jewelry and bright-coloured clothing, dressed her hair like a Taoist nun and put on a white silk habit like a Buddhist one.</P>
<P>She came out through the doors carrying the twelve-foot fan with both hands, and at the sight of the vajrapanis, the gods, the Heavenly King and Nezha she fell to her knees in terror, kowtowing in worship and saying, &#8220;I beg you Bodhisattvas to spare my husband and me. I present the fan to my brother-in-law Monkey for him to win his glory with.&#8221; Monkey went forward, took the fan, and rode back East by auspicious cloud with the others.</P>
<P>Sanzang and Friar Sand had been waiting a very long time, sometimes sitting and sometimes standing, for Monkey to come back. They were extremely anxious by the time the sky was suddenly filled with auspicious clouds and the earth was lit up by blessed light as all the gods came whistling through the air towards them. &#8220;Wujing,&#8221; said the venerable elder in terror, &#8220;whose divine soldiers are coming from over there?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Friar Sand, who could recognize them, &#8220;it's the four vajrapanis, the Golden-headed Protector, the Six Jias, the Six Dings, the Guardians of the Faith and all the other passing gods. The one leading the bull is Prince Nezha, and there's Heavenly King Li the Pagoda-carrier holding a mirror. My eldest brother is carrying the plantain fan, and that's second brother and the local god behind him. The others are all escort troops.&#8221;</P>
<P>Hearing this, Sanzang put on his Vairocana mitre and his cassock then went with Friar Sand to welcome the gods and thank them with these words: &#8220;What merits do I, your disciple, have that I put all you holy ones to the trouble of coming down to earth?&#8221;</P>
<P>To this the four vajrapanis replied, &#8220;Congratulations, holy monk. The great task has now been achieved. We were sent to help you on the Buddha's orders. You must now continue your self-cultivation and not slacken for a moment.&#8221; Sanzang replied amid kowtows that he accepted their commands.</P>
<P>The Great Sage Sun took the fan close to the Fiery Mountains, waved it as hard as he could, and put the flames out. Their glare disappeared. He waved the fan again and the rustle of a cool breeze could be heard; and at the third wave the sky was overcast with cloud and a fine rain began to fall. There is a poem that bears witness to this:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>For hundreds of miles the mountains of fire</P>
<P>Lit heaven and earth with notorious flames.</P>
<P>When fire roasts the five passions the elixir cannot be made.</P>
<P>When flame burns the three passes the Way is not pure.</P>
<P>To borrow the plantain fan and bring down rain,</P>
<P>Heavenly gods had to help with their spiritual power.</P>
<P>When the bull is led to the Buddha it must stop being evil;</P>
<P>When water and fire are allied the nature is calm.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Having been relieved of his cares Sanzang stopped worrying. All the hosts then reverently thanked the vajrapanis, who all returned to their mountains, and the Six Dings and Six Jias went back into the sky to give their protection. The deities who had been passing by all went on their way; and the Heavenly King and Nezha led the bull back to hand him over to the Buddha. This left only the local mountain god waiting there with Raksasi under his guard.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why aren't you on your way, Raksasi?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;What are you standing there waiting for?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I beg you in your mercy, Great Sage,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;to give me back the fan.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've got a cheek, damned bitch,&#8221; roared Pig. &#8220;We've spared your life and that should be enough for you. What do you want the fan for? When we've crossed the mountains we'll be able to sell it for food. Do you think we're going to give it to you after all the trouble and effort we've been to? It's raining, so be off home with you.&#8221;</P>
<P>She bowed again and said, &#8220;But the Great Sage promised to give it back when he'd put the fire out. I'm very sorry about all that has happened. It was only because I was feeling so upset that I put you to all that trouble. We too have learned to live like human beings. The only thing is that we had not been converted to the pursuit of the true achievement. Now our true bodies have turned to the West, and we will not dare do anything wicked again. I beg you to return the fan so that I can reform and cultivate myself.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; said the local deity, &#8220;let us make full use of this woman's knowledge of the art of extinguishing fire to put these fires out for good, and give her back her fan. Then I will be able to live here in peace, help the people who live here, and be given offerings of blood and food. This would truly be a great kindness to me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I heard the local people saying that when the fan puts the flames out in these mountains they can only gather one harvest before they start burning again,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;How are we going to be able to put them out forever?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;All you have to do to put the flames out forever,&#8221; said Raksasi, &#8220;is wave the fan forty-nine times. Then they'll never burn again.&#8221;</P>
<P>Now that Brother Monkey knew this he took the fan and fanned the mountains with it forty-nine times as hard as he possibly could, whereupon heavy rain began to pour down. The fan really was a treasure: where there were flames it rained, and where there were not the sky was clear. By standing where there no flames master and disciples avoided getting wet. After spending the night sitting there they got the horse and luggage ready the next morning and returned the fan to Raksasi.</P>
<P>&#8220;If I don't give it back to you,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;people might say I don't keep my word. Take the fan with you, go back to your mountain and don't make any more trouble. As you've achieved human form I'll spare your life.&#8221; Taking the fan from him Raksasi said the words of the spell, pinched the thread so that it shrank back to the size of an apricot leaf and put it in her mouth. She then thanked them all and prepared to cultivate her conduct as a hermit. Later she too achieved the true reward and her name was made eternally famous through the scriptures. Raksasi and the local god expressed their deep gratitude to the four sages and escorted them along their way. As Monkey, Pig and Friar Sand escorted Sanzang along his way their bodies felt cool and the ground under their feet was pleasantly damp. This was indeed a case of</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>With the help of trigrams Kan and Li the primal is compounded;</P>
<P>When fire and water are balanced the Great Way is completed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know how many years it was till they returned to the East, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>猪八戒助力败魔王</p>
<p>孙行者三调芭蕉扇</p>
</div>
<p>话表牛魔王赶上孙大圣，只见他肩膊上掮着那柄芭蕉扇，怡颜悦色而行。魔王大惊道：“猢狲原来把运用的方法儿也叨餂得来了。我若当面问他索取，他定然不与。倘若扇我一扇，要去十万八千里远，却不遂了他意？我闻得唐僧在那大路上等候。他二徒弟猪精，三徒弟沙流精，我当年做妖怪时，也曾会他，且变作猪精的模样，返骗他一场。料猢狲以得意为喜，必不详细提防。”好魔王，他也有七十二变，武艺也与大圣一般，只是身子狼犺些，欠钻疾，不活达些；把宝剑藏了，念个咒语，摇身一变，即变作八戒一般嘴脸，抄下路，当面迎着大圣，叫道：</p>

<p>“师兄，我来也！”这大圣果然欢喜，古人云，得胜的猫儿欢似虎也，只倚着强能，更不察来人的意思，见是个八戒的模样，便就叫道：“兄弟，你往那里去？”牛魔王绰着经儿道：“师父见你许久不回，恐牛魔王手段大，你斗他不过，难得他的宝贝，教我来迎你的。”行者笑道：“不必费心，我已得了手了。”牛王又问道：</p>

<p>“你怎么得的？”行者道：“那老牛与我战经百十合，不分胜负。</p>

<p>他就撇了我，去那乱石山碧波潭底，与一伙蛟精龙精饮酒。是我暗跟他去，变作个螃蟹，偷了他所骑的辟水金睛兽，变了老牛的模样，径至芭蕉洞哄那罗刹女。那女子与老孙结了一场干夫妻，是老孙设法骗将来的。”牛王道：“却是生受了，哥哥劳碌太甚，可把扇子我拿。”孙大圣那知真假，也虑不及此，遂将扇子递与他。</p>

<p>原来那牛王，他知那扇子收放的根本，接过手，不知捻个甚么诀儿，依然小似一片杏叶，现出本象，开言骂道：“泼猢狲！</p>

<p>认得我么？”行者见了，心中自悔道：“是我的不是了！”恨了一声，跌足高呼道：“咦！逐年家打雁，今却被小雁儿鹐了眼睛。”</p>

<p>狠得他爆躁如雷，掣铁棒，劈头便打，那魔王就使扇子搧他一下，不知那大圣先前变蟭蟟虫入罗刹女腹中之时，将定风丹噙在口里，不觉的咽下肚里，所以五脏皆牢，皮骨皆固，凭他怎么搧，再也搧他不动。牛王慌了，把宝贝丢入口中，双手轮剑就砍。那两个在那半空中这一场好杀：齐天孙大圣，混世泼牛王，只为芭蕉扇，相逢各骋强。粗心大圣将人骗，大胆牛王把扇诓。</p>

<p>这一个，金箍棒起无情义；那一个，双刃青锋有智量。大圣施威喷彩雾，牛王放泼吐毫光。齐斗勇，两不良，咬牙锉齿气昂昂。</p>

<p>播土扬尘天地暗，飞砂走石鬼神藏。这个说：“你敢无知返骗我！”那个说：“我妻许你共相将！”言村语泼，性烈情刚。那个说：“你哄人妻女真该死！告到官司有罪殃！”伶俐的齐天圣，凶顽的大力王，一心只要杀，更不待商量。棒打剑迎齐努力，有些松慢见阎王。</p>

<p>且不说他两个相斗难分，却表唐僧坐在途中，一则火气蒸人，二来心焦口渴，对火焰山土地道：“敢问尊神，那牛魔王法力如何？”土地道：“那牛王神通不小，法力无边，正是孙大圣的敌手。”三藏道：“悟空是个会走路的，往常家二千里路，一霎时便回，怎么如今去了一日？断是与那牛王赌斗。”叫：“悟能，悟净！你两个，那一个去迎你师兄一迎？倘或遇敌，就当用力相助，求得扇子来，解我烦躁，早早过山赶路去也。”八戒道：“今日天晚，我想着要去接他，但只是不认得积雷山路。”土地道：</p>

<p>“小神认得。且教卷帘将军与你师父做伴，我与你去来。”三藏大喜道：“有劳尊神，功成再谢。”</p>

<p>那八戒抖擞精神，束一束皂锦直裰，搴着钯，即与土地纵起云雾，径回东方而去。正行时，忽听得喊杀声高，狂风滚滚。</p>

<p>八戒按住云头看时，原来孙行者与牛王厮杀哩。土地道：“天蓬还不上前怎的？”呆子掣钉钯，厉声高叫道：“师兄，我来也！”行者恨道：“你这夯货，误了我多少大事！”八戒道：“师父教我来迎你，因认不得山路，商议良久，教土地引我，故此来迟；如何误了大事？”行者道：“不是怪你来迟，这泼牛十分无礼！我向罗刹处弄得扇子来，却被这厮变作你的模样，口称迎我，我一时欢悦，转把扇子递在他手，他却现了本象，与老孙在此比并，所以误了大事也。”八戒闻言大怒，举钉钯当面骂道：“我把你这血皮胀的遭瘟！你怎敢变作你祖宗的模样，骗我师兄，使我兄弟不睦！”你看他没头没脸的使钉钯乱筑，那牛王一则是与行者斗了一日，力倦神疲；二则是见八戒的钉钯凶猛，遮架不住，败阵就走。只见那火焰山土地，帅领阴兵，当面挡住道：“大力王，且住手，唐三藏西天取经，无神不保，无天不佑，三界通知，十方拥护。快将芭蕉扇来搧息火焰，教他无灾无障，早过山去；</p>

<p>不然，上天责你罪愆，定遭诛也。”牛王道：“你这土地，全不察理！那泼猴夺我子，欺我妾，骗我妻，番番无道，我恨不得囫囵吞他下肚，化作大便喂狗，怎么肯将宝贝借他！”说不了，八戒赶上骂道：“我把你个结心癀！快拿出扇来，饶你性命！”那牛王只得回头，使宝剑又战八戒，孙大圣举棒相帮，这一场在那里好杀：成精豕，作怪牛，兼上偷天得道猴。禅性自来能战炼，必当用土合元由。钉钯九齿尖还利，宝剑双锋快更柔。铁棒卷舒为主仗，土神助力结丹头。三家刑克相争竞，各展雄才要运筹。</p>

<p>捉牛耕地金钱长，唤豕归炉木气收。心不在焉何作道，神常守舍要拴猴。胡乱嚷，苦相求，三般兵刃响搜搜。钯筑剑伤无好意，金箍棒起有因由。只杀得星不光兮月不皎，一天寒雾黑悠悠！那魔王奋勇争强，且行且斗，斗了一夜，不分上下，早又天明。前面是他的积雷山摩云洞口，他三个与土地阴兵，又喧哗振耳，惊动那玉面公主，唤丫鬟看是那里人嚷。只见守门小妖来报：“是我家爷爷与昨日那雷公嘴汉子并一个长嘴大耳的和尚同火焰山土地等众厮杀哩！”玉面公主听言，即命外护的大小头目，各执枪刀助力。前后点起七长八短，有百十余口，一个个卖弄精神，拈枪弄棒，齐告：“大王爷爷，我等奉奶奶内旨，特来助力也！”牛王大喜道：“来得好！来得好！”众妖一齐上前乱砍。八戒措手不及，倒拽着钯败阵而走，大圣纵筋斗云跳出重围，众阴兵亦四散奔走。老牛得胜，聚众妖归洞，紧闭了洞门不题。</p>

<p>行者道：“这厮骁勇！自昨日申时前后，与老孙战起，直到今夜，未定输赢，却得你两个来接力。如此苦斗半日一夜，他更不见劳困。才这一伙小妖，却又莽壮。他将洞门紧闭不出，如之奈何？”八戒道：“哥哥，你昨日巳时离了师父，怎么到申时才与他斗起？你那两三个时辰，在那里的？”行者道：“别你后，顷刻就到这座山上，见一个女子问讯，原来就是他爱妾玉面公主。被我使铁棒唬他一唬，他就跑进洞，叫出那牛王来。与老孙狔言狔语，嚷了一会，又与他交手，斗了有一个时辰。正打处，有人请他赴宴去了。是我跟他到那乱石山碧波潭底，变作一个螃蟹，探了消息，偷了他辟水金睛兽，假变牛王模样，复至翠云山芭蕉洞，骗了罗刹女，哄得他扇子。出门试演试演方法，把扇子弄长了，只是不会收小。正掮了走处，被他假变做你的嘴脸，返骗了去，故此耽搁两三个时辰也。”八戒道：“这正是俗语云，大海里翻了豆腐船，汤里来，水里去。如今难得他扇子，如何保得师父过山？且回去，转路走他娘罢！”土地道：“大圣休焦恼，天蓬莫懈怠。但说转路，就是入了旁门，不成个修行之类，古语云，行不由径，岂可转走？你那师父，在正路上坐着，眼巴巴只望你们成功哩！”行者发狠道：“正是正是，呆子莫要胡谈！土地说得有理，我们正要与他赌输赢，弄手段，等我施为地煞变。自到西方无对头，牛王本是心猿变。今番正好会源流，断要相持借宝扇。趁清凉，息火焰，打破顽空参佛面。行满超升极乐天，大家同赴龙华宴！”那八戒听言，便生努力，殷勤道：</p>

<p>“是，是，是！去，去，去！管甚牛王会不会，木生在亥配为猪，牵转牛儿归土类。申下生金本是猴，无刑无克多和气。用芭蕉，为水意，焰火消除成既济。昼夜休离苦尽功，功完赶赴盂兰会。”</p>

<p>他两个领着土地阴兵一齐上前，使钉钯，轮铁棒，乒乒乓乓，把一座摩云洞的前门，打得粉碎。唬得那外护头目，战战兢兢，闯入里边报道：“大王！孙悟空率众打破前门也！”那牛王正与玉面公主备言其事，懊恨孙行者哩，听说打破前门，十分发怒，急披挂，拿了铁棍，从里边骂出来道：“泼猢狲！你是多大个人儿，敢这等上门撒泼，打破我门扇？”八戒近前乱骂道：“泼老剥皮！你是个甚样人物，敢量那个大小！不要走！看钯！”牛王喝道：“你这个囔糟食的夯货，不见怎的！快叫那猴儿上来！”行者道：“不知好歹的盞草！我昨日还与你论兄弟，今日就是仇人了！仔细吃吾一棒！”那牛王奋勇而迎。这场比前番更胜。三个英雄，厮混在一处。好杀：钉钯铁棒逞神威，同帅阴兵战老牺，牺牲独展凶强性，遍满同天法力恢。使钯筑，着棍擂，铁棒英雄又出奇。三般兵器叮当响，隔架遮拦谁让谁？他道他为首，我道我夺魁。士兵为证难分解，木土相煎上下随。这两个说：</p>

<p>“你如何不借芭蕉扇！”那一个道：“你焉敢欺心骗我妻！赶妾害儿仇未报，敲门打户又惊疑！”这个说：“你仔细堤防如意棒，擦着些儿就破皮！”那个说：“好生躲避钯头齿，一伤九孔血淋漓！”牛魔不怕施威猛，铁棍高擎有见机。翻云覆雨随来往，吐雾喷风任发挥。恨苦这场都拚命，各怀恶念喜相持。丢架子，让高低，前迎后挡总无亏。兄弟二人齐努力，单身一棍独施为。</p>

<p>卯时战到辰时后，战罢牛魔束手回。他三个含死忘生，又斗有百十余合。八戒发起呆性，仗着行者神通，举钯乱筑。牛王遮架不住，败阵回头，就奔洞门，却被土地阴兵拦住洞门，喝道：</p>

<p>“大力王，那里走！吾等在此！”那老牛不得进洞，急抽身，又见八戒、行者赶来，慌得卸了盔甲，丢了铁棍，摇身一变，变做一只天鹅，望空飞走。行者看见，笑道：“八戒！老牛去了。”那呆子漠然不知，土地亦不能晓，一个个东张西觑，只在积雷山前后乱找。行者指道：“那空中飞的不是？”八戒道：“那是一只天鹅。”行者道：“正是老牛变的。”土地道：“既如此，却怎生么？”</p>

<p>行者道：“你两个打进此门，把群妖尽情剿除，拆了他的窝巢，绝了他的归路，等老孙与他赌变化去。”那八戒与土地，依言攻破洞门不题。</p>

<p>这大圣收了金箍棒，捻诀念咒，摇身一变，变作一个海东青，飕的一翅，钻在云眼里，倒飞下来，落在天鹅身上，抱住颈项嗛眼。那牛王也知是孙行者变化，急忙抖抖翅，变作一只黄鹰，返来嗛海东青。行者又变作一个乌凤，专一赶黄鹰。牛王识得，又变作一只白鹤，长唳一声，向南飞去。行者立定，抖抖翎毛，又变作一只丹凤，高鸣一声。那白鹤见凤是鸟王，诸禽不敢妄动，刷的一翅，淬下山崖，将身一变，变作一只香獐，乜乜些些，在崖前吃草。行者认得，也就落下翅来，变作一只饿虎，剪尾跑蹄，要来赶獐作食。魔王慌了手脚，又变作一只金钱花斑的大豹，要伤饿虎。行者见了，迎着风，把头一幌，又变作一只金眼狻猊，声如霹雳，铁额铜头，复转身要食大豹。牛王着了急，又变作一个人熊，放开脚，就来擒那狻猊。行者打个滚，就变作一只赖象，鼻似长蛇，牙如竹笋，撒开鼻子，要去卷那人熊。牛王嘻嘻的笑了一笑，现出原身，一只大白牛，头如峻岭，眼若闪光，两只角似两座铁塔，牙排利刃。连头至尾，有千余丈长短，自蹄至背，有八百丈高下，对行者高叫道：“泼猢狲！你如今将奈我何？”行者也就现了原身，抽出金箍棒来，把腰一躬，喝声叫：“长！”长得身高万丈，头如泰山，眼如日月，口似血池，牙似门扇，手执一条铁棒，着头就打。那牛王硬着头，使角来触。这一场，真个是撼岭摇山，惊天动地！有诗为证，诗曰：道高一尺魔千丈，奇巧心猿用力降。若得火山无烈焰，必须宝扇有清凉。黄婆矢志扶元老，木母留情扫荡妖。和睦五行归正果，炼魔涤垢上西方。他两个大展神通，在半山中赌斗，惊得那过往虚空一切神众与金头揭谛、六甲六丁、一十八位护教伽蓝都来围困魔王。那魔王公然不惧，你看他东一头，西一头，直挺挺光耀耀的两只铁角，往来抵触；南一撞，北一撞，毛森森筋暴暴的一条硬尾，左右敲摇。孙大圣当面迎，众多神四面打，牛王急了，就地一滚，复本象，便投芭蕉洞去。行者也收了法象，与众多神随后追袭。那魔王闯入洞里，闭门不出，概众把一座翠云山围得水泄不通。</p>

<p>正都上门攻打，忽听得八戒与土地阴兵嚷嚷而至。行者见了问曰：“那摩云洞事体如何？”八戒笑道：“那老牛的娘子被我一钯筑死，剥开衣看，原来是个玉面狸精。那伙群妖，俱是些驴骡犊特、獾狐狢獐、羊虎麋鹿等类，已此尽皆剿戮，又将他洞府房廊放火烧了。土地说他还有一处家小，住居此山，故又来这里扫荡也。”行者道：“贤弟有功，可喜！可喜！老孙空与那老牛赌变化，未曾得胜。他变做无大不大的白牛，我变了法天象地的身量，正和他抵触之间，幸蒙诸神下降，围困多时，他却复原身，走进洞去矣。”八戒道：“那可是芭蕉洞么？”行者道：“正是！</p>

<p>正是！罗刹女正在此间。”八戒发狠道：“既是这般，怎么不打进去，剿除那厮，问他要扇子，倒让他停留长智，两口儿叙情！”好呆子，抖擞威风，举钯照门一筑，忽辣的一声，将那石崖连门筑倒了一边。慌得那女童忙报：“爷爷！不知甚人把前门都打坏了！”牛王方跑进去，喘嘘嘘的，正告诉罗刹女与孙行者夺扇子赌斗之事，闻报心中大怒，就口中吐出扇子，递与罗刹女。罗刹女接扇在手，满眼垂泪道：“大王！把这扇子送与那猢狲，教他退兵去罢。”牛王道：“夫人啊，物虽小而恨则深。你且坐着，等我再和他比并去来。”那魔重整披挂，又选两口宝剑，走出门来，正遇着八戒使钯筑门，老牛更不打话，掣剑劈脸便砍。八戒举钯迎着，向后倒退了几步，出门来，早有大圣轮棒当头。那牛魔即驾狂风，跳离洞府，又都在那翠云山上相持。众多神四面围绕，土地兵左右攻击。这一场，又好杀哩：云迷世界，雾罩乾坤。飒飒阴风砂石滚，巍巍怒气海波浑。重磨剑二口，复挂甲全身。结冤深似海，怀恨越生嗔。你看齐天大圣因功绩，不讲当年老故人。八戒施威求扇子，众神护法捉牛君。牛王双手无停息，左遮右挡弄精神。只杀得那过鸟难飞皆敛翅，游鱼不跃尽潜鳞；鬼泣神嚎天地暗，龙愁虎怕日光昏！</p>

<p>那牛王拚命捐躯，斗经五十余合，抵敌不住，败了阵，往北就走。早有五台山秘魔岩神通广大泼法金刚阻住道：“牛魔，你往那里去！我等乃释迦牟尼佛祖差来，布列天罗地网，至此擒汝也！”正说间，随后有大圣、八戒、众神赶来。那魔王慌转身向南走，又撞着峨眉山清凉洞法力无量胜至金刚挡住喝道：“吾奉佛旨在此，正要拿住你也！”牛王心慌脚软，急抽身往东便走，却逢着须弥山摩耳崖毗卢沙门大力金刚迎住道：“你老牛何往！我蒙如来密令，教来捕获你也！”牛王又悚然而退，向西就走，又遇着昆仑山金霞岭不坏尊王永住金刚敌住喝道：“这厮又将安走！我领西天大雷音寺佛老亲言，在此把截，谁放你也！”那老牛心惊胆战，悔之不及。见那四面八方都是佛兵天将，真个似罗网高张，不能脱命。正在仓惶之际，又闻得行者帅众赶来，他就驾云头，望上便走。却好有托塔李天王并哪吒太子，领鱼肚药叉、巨灵神将，幔住空中，叫道：“慢来！慢来！吾奉玉帝旨意，特来此剿除你也！”牛王急了，依前摇身一变，还变做一只大白牛，使两只铁角去触天王，天王使刀来砍。随后孙行者又到，哪吒太子厉声高叫：“大圣，衣甲在身，不能为礼。</p>

<p>愚父子昨日见佛如来，发檄奏闻玉帝，言唐僧路阻火焰山，孙大圣难伏牛魔王，玉帝传旨，特差我父王领众助力。”行者道：</p>

<p>“这厮神通不小！又变作这等身躯，却怎奈何？”太子笑道：“大圣勿疑，你看我擒他。”这太子即喝一声“变！”变得三头六臂，飞身跳在牛王背上，使斩妖剑望颈项上一挥，不觉得把个牛头斩下。天王收刀，却才与行者相见。那牛王腔子里又钻出一个头来，口吐黑气，眼放金光。被哪吒又砍一剑，头落处，又钻出一个头来。一连砍了十数剑，随即长出十数个头。哪吒取出火轮儿挂在那老牛的角上，便吹真火，焰焰烘烘，把牛王烧得张狂哮吼，摇头摆尾。才要变化脱身，又被托塔天王将照妖镜照住本象，腾那不动，无计逃生，只叫“莫伤我命！情愿归顺佛家也！”哪吒道：“既惜身命，快拿扇子出来！”牛王道：“扇子在我山妻处收着哩。”</p>

<p>哪吒见说，将缚妖索子解下，跨在他那颈项上，一把拿住鼻头，将索穿在鼻孔里，用手牵来。孙行者却会聚了四大金刚、六丁六甲、护教伽蓝、托塔天王、巨灵神将并八戒、土地、阴兵，簇拥着白牛，回至芭蕉洞口。老牛叫道：“夫人，将扇子出来，救我性命！”罗刹听叫，急卸了钗环，脱了色服，挽青丝如道姑，穿缟素似比丘，双手捧那柄丈二长短的芭蕉扇子，走出门，又见有金刚众圣与天王父子，慌忙跪在地下，磕头礼拜道：“望菩萨饶我夫妻之命，愿将此扇奉承孙叔叔成功去也！”行者近前接了扇，同大众共驾祥云，径回东路。</p>

<p>却说那三藏与沙僧，立一会，坐一会，盼望行者，许久不回，何等忧虑！忽见祥云满空，瑞光满地，飘飘飖飖，盖众神行将近，这长老害怕道：“悟净！那壁厢是谁神兵来也？”沙僧认得道：“师父啊，那是四大金刚、金头揭谛、六甲六丁、护教伽蓝与过往众神。牵牛的是哪吒三太子，拿镜的是托塔李天王，大师兄执着芭蕉扇，二师兄并土地随后，其余的都是护卫神兵。”三藏听说，换了毗卢帽，穿了袈裟，与悟净拜迎众圣，称谢道：“我弟子有何德能，敢劳列位尊圣临凡也！”四大金刚道：“圣僧喜了，十分功行将完！吾等奉佛旨差来助汝，汝当竭力修持，勿得须臾怠情。”三藏叩齿叩头，受身受命。</p>

<p>孙大圣执着扇子，行近山边，尽气力挥了一扇，那火焰山平平息焰，寂寂除光；行者喜喜欢欢，又搧一扇，只闻得习习潇潇，清风微动；第三扇，满天云漠漠，细雨落霏霏。有诗为证，诗曰：火焰山遥八百程，火光大地有声名。火煎五漏丹难熟，火燎三关道不清。时借芭蕉施雨露，幸蒙天将助神功。牵牛归佛休颠劣，水火相联性自平。此时三藏解燥除烦，清心了意。四众皈依，谢了金刚，各转宝山。六丁六甲升空保护，过往神祇四散，天王太子牵牛径归佛地回缴。止有本山土地，押着罗刹女，在旁伺候。行者道：“那罗刹，你不走路，还立在此等甚？”罗刹跪道：“万望大圣垂慈，将扇子还了我罢。”八戒喝道：“泼贱人，不知高低！饶了你的性命就彀了，还要讨甚么扇子，我们拿过山去，不会卖钱买点心吃？费了这许多精神力气，又肯与你！雨蒙蒙的，还不回去哩！”罗刹再拜道：“大圣原说扇息了火还我。</p>

<p>今此一场，诚悔之晚矣。只因不倜傥，致令劳师动众。我等也修成人道，只是未归正果，见今真身现象归西，我再不敢妄作。</p>

<p>愿赐本扇，从立自新，修身养命去也。”土地道：“大圣！趁此女深知息火之法，断绝火根，还他扇子，小神居此苟安，拯救这方生民；求些血食，诚为恩便。”行者道：“我当时问着乡人说，这山扇息火，只收得一年五谷，便又火发！”如何治得除根？”罗刹道：“要是断绝火根，只消连扇四十九扇，永远再不发了。”行者闻言，执扇子，使尽筋力。望山头连扇四十九扇，那山上大雨淙淙，果然是宝贝：有火处下雨，无火处天晴。他师徒们立在这无火处，不遭雨湿。坐了一夜，次早才收拾马匹行李，把扇子还了罗刹，又道：“老孙若不与你，恐人说我言而无信。你将扇子回山，再休生事。看你得了人身，饶你去罢！”那罗刹接了扇子。念个咒语，捏做个杏叶儿，噙在口里，拜谢了众圣，隐姓修行，后来也得了正果，经藏中万古流名。罗刹、土地俱感激谢恩，随后相送。行者、八戒、沙僧，保着三藏遂此前进，真个是身体清凉，足下滋润。诚所谓：坎离既济真元合，水火均平大道成。毕竟不知几年才回东土，且听下回分解。</p>
