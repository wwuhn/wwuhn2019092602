<P>In Bhiksuland the Hidden Gods Are Sent on an Errand of Mercy</P>
<P>In the Palace the Monster Is Revealed and the Way Discussed</P>
</div>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A single thought at once disturbs a hundred monsters;</P>
<P>The hardest efforts are all to no avail.</P>
<P>One can only wash away each speck of dust,</P>
<P>Tidy everything and polish well.</P>
<P>Sweep all causation away and come to nirvana;</P>
<P>Waste no time and destroy the thousand demons.</P>
<P>You surely will be free from obstructions,</P>
<P>And rise to the Daluo Heaven when your deeds are done.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story tells how the Great Sage Sun used all his ingenuity to fetch the Tathagata to subdue the demons and rescue Sanzang and the other two disciples, after which they left the city of Leonia and headed West. When they had been travelling for several more months it was winter, and this is what could be seen:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The plum on the ridge was like broken jade</P>
<P>As the water in the pond slowly turned to ice.</P>
<P>All the red autumn leaves had fallen,</P>
<P>And the green of the pine looked fresher than ever.</P>
<P>The pale and scudding clouds were on the point of snowing;</P>
<P>Flat lay the withered grass upon the hills.</P>
<P>As far as the eye could see was chilly brightness</P>
<P>As the unseen cold went right into the bone.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Master and disciples braved the cold, sleeping out in the rain and dining off the wind, until as they were walking along another walled and moated city came into sight. &#8220;What sort of place is that over there, Wukong?&#8221; Sanzang asked Monkey, who replied, &#8220;We'll know when we get there. If it's the capital of a Western kingdom we'll have to present our passport to be inspected and returned. If it's a prefecture or county town we'll go straight through.&#8221; Before master and disciples could finish their conversation they had arrived at the city gates.</P>
<P>Sanzang dismounted and the four of them went in through the curtain wall outside the gates. Noticing an old soldier sleeping shielded from the wind under the South-facing wall, Brother Monkey went up to him, shook him and said, &#8220;Sir!&#8221;</P>
<P>When the old soldier awoke with a start to open his bleary eyes and see Monkey he fell to his knees to kowtow and say, &#8220;My Lord!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no need for such alarm,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'm no evil god, so why call me your lord?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Aren't you Lord Thunder God?&#8221; the old soldier asked, kowtowing again.</P>
<P>&#8220;What a thing to say,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;We're monks from the East on our way to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven. We've just arrived here. Could I ask what this place is called?&#8221; This answer finally eased the old soldier's mind.</P>
<P>With a yawn he got back on his feet, stretched and said, &#8220;Please forgive me, reverend gentlemen. This country used to be called Bhiksuland but its name has been changed to Boytown.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do you have a king?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; the old soldier replied.</P>
<P>Monkey then turned to report to the Tang Priest, &#8220;This country used to be called Bhiksuland but the name's been altered to Boytown, though I don't know what the change signifies.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If it was Bhiksuland before why is it Boytown now?&#8221; the Tang Priest wondered.</P>
<P>&#8220;I expect there was a King Bhiksu who died,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;and they changed the name to Boytown when a boy succeeded him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Impossible,&#8221; said the Tang Priest, &#8220;impossible. Let's go in and make some enquiries in the street.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's right,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;The old soldier wouldn't have known anyhow, and on top of that elder brother gave him such a fright that he talked nonsense. We'll ask some more questions in the city.&#8221;</P>
<P>When they had gone through the third pair of gates they came to a great market on a main street. The people were well-dressed and their bearing distinguished.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A hubbub of voices came from bar and music hall;</P>
<P>High hung the curtains outside splendid shop and teahouse.</P>
<P>Business was good in firms by the thousand;</P>
<P>Wealth flowed free in shopping street and market.</P>
<P>The dealers in metal and silk were swarming like ants,</P>
<P>Caring only for money while struggling for fame and wealth.</P>
<P>With these noble manners, magnificent scenery</P>
<P>And peaceful waters it was a time of prosperity.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The master and his three disciples, who were leading the horse and carrying the baggage, spent some time walking around the streets as they admired the general air of prosperity. In the entrance to every house there was a basketwork coop of the sort geese are kept in. &#8220;Disciples,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;why do all the people here put coops in their gateways?&#8221; Pig's response to this was to look around and see that there were indeed lines of coops hung with satin curtains of many colours. &#8220;Master,&#8221; said the idiot with a smile, &#8220;today must be a lucky one for weddings and celebrations. Everybody's having a wedding.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;How could every single family possibly be having a wedding? There must be some other reason for this. I'm going over to take a look.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're not to go,&#8221; said Sanzang, grabbing hold of him. &#8220;You look so ugly that people might take offence.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll go as something else,&#8221; Brother Monkey replied.</P>
<P>Making a spell with his hands the splendid Great Sage said the words of a spell, shook himself, turned into a bee, spread his wings, flew to one of the coops and slipped in through the curtains to take a look. A little boy was sitting inside. Monkey looked inside another family's coop and there was a child in that too. He inspected eight or nine households and all of them had a child. All were boys: there was not a single girl. Some were sitting up in their coops and playing and some were crying; some were eating fruit and some were snoozing.</P>
<P>His inspection over, Monkey turned back into his normal self and reported to the Tang Priest, &#8220;There are little boys in the coops. The oldest is under six and the youngest only four. I don't know why they're here.&#8221; Sanzang wondered what the explanation could be.</P>
<P>Turning a comer they saw the gateway to an official building. It was a government hostel with golden pavilions. The venerable elder was delighted.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciples,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we will go into this hostel. We can find out where we are, give the horse a rest and put up for the night.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, that's right,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;Let's go straight in.&#8221; This the four of them happily did, a fact that the officials there reported to the hostel's superintendent.</P>
<P>When the superintendent had led them inside greetings had been exchanged and they had all sat down, the superintendent asked, &#8220;Where have you come from, reverend sir?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am a monk sent by the Great Tang in the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;Now that we have arrived at this excellent establishment I will of course present my passport for inspection. Could we, I wonder, impose on your hospitality for the night?&#8221;</P>
<P>The superintendent ordered tea, and when it had been drank he saw to their entertainment and told the staff who were on duty to look after the pilgrims. After thanking him for this Sanzang went on to ask, &#8220;Could we go to the palace today to see His Majesty and have our passport inspected?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That will not be possible this evening,&#8221; the superintendent replied. &#8220;It will have to wait until tomorrow morning. I hope that you will spend a comfortable night in this humble hostel.&#8221;</P>
<P>A little later, when all had been prepared, the superintendent of the hostel invited the four travelers to take a vegetarian meal with him. He also told his staff to sweep out the guest rooms for them to spend the night in. Sanzang expressed endless gratitude. When they were all seated the venerable elder said, &#8220;I wonder if I could trouble you for information on something that I cannot understand. How do you raise children in your country?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;People are the same the whole world over, just as there are never two suns in the sky,&#8221; the superintendent replied. &#8220;Children are born when their time comes after the father's seed has joined with the mother's blood and they have been in the womb for ten lunar months. After they are born they are suckled for three years and their bodies gradually grow. Everybody knows that.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What you tell me is no different from how they grow in my humble country,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;But when we came into the city we saw a goose coop with a little boy inside in front of every house in the street. This is something I cannot understand, which is why I ventured to raise the question.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Ignore that, reverend sir,&#8221; whispered the hostel superintendent into Sanzang's ear. &#8220;Don't ask about it. Put it out of your mind. Don't even mention it. Would you like to settle down for the night before starting your journey again tomorrow morning?&#8221; Sanzang's response was to seize hold of the superintendent and demand an explanation.</P>
<P>&#8220;Watch your words,&#8221; the superintendent replied, shaking his head and wagging his finger, but Sanzang was not going to drop the matter. He insisted on being told all the details. The superintendent had no choice but to dismiss all the staff on duty.</P>
<P>When they were alone under the lamplight he whispered to Sanzang, &#8220;The goose coops you asked about are there because our king is a bad ruler. Why ever do you have to keep asking about it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How is he a bad ruler?&#8221; Sanzang asked. &#8220;I will not be able to set my mind at ease until you give me an explanation.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This country is really called Bhiksuland,&#8221; the superintendent replied. &#8220;Boytown is only what the people have started calling it. Three years ago an old man dressed as a Taoist came here with a girl just fifteen years old. She was a ravishing beauty, just like a Bodhisattva Guanyin. He presented her to our present king, who was so smitten by her charms that she became the favorite of all his women. She was given the title Queen Beauty. For some time now he's had no eyes for any of his other queens or consorts. He's so insatiable that he's been at it day and night. The result is nervous exhaustion and physical collapse. He's eating and drinking next to nothing. He might die at any moment. The Royal College of Physicians has tried every possible medicine without any success. The Taoist who presented the girl to the king was rewarded with the title of Elder of the Nation. He has a secret foreign formula for making people live a great deal longer. He's been to ten continents and the three magic islands to collect the ingredients. Everything is ready. The only problem is that it needs a terrible adjuvant to help it&#8212;a potion made from the hearts of 1,111 little boys. When he's taken it he'll have a thousand years of vigorous life ahead of him. All the little boys being kept in the coops are the ones that have been chosen. Their parents are so afraid of the king that none of them dares weep. That's why they've put out the story that this place is now called Boytown. When you go to the palace tomorrow morning, reverend sir, you must only present your passport to be inspected and returned. Say nothing about any of this.&#8221; When he had said all this he left them.</P>
<P>Sanzang was so horrified by what he had heard that his bones turned soft and his muscles went numb. He could not help the tears that streamed down his face as he started sobbing aloud. &#8220;Foolish king,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;foolish king. Your lechery has ruined your health, and now you are planning to destroy all those young lives. How could you? What misery! The pain of it all is killing me.&#8221; There is a poem about it that goes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The wicked monarch's folly makes him forget the truth;</P>
<P>His health is ruined by his unbridled lusts.</P>
<P>Pursuing eternal life by killing little children,</P>
<P>He slaughters his subjects to avoid Heaven's punishment.</P>
<P>This is all more than the merciful monk can bear:</P>
<P>He cannot accept the official's worldly wisdom.</P>
<P>Long are his sighs as he weeps in the lamplight;</P>
<P>Stricken with grief is the Buddha worshipper.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Pig, going up to him, &#8220;what's the matter with you? What you're doing is like taking a stranger's coffin to your own home and weeping over it. Don't upset yourself like that. As the rhyme goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When a monarch insists that his subjects will die</P>
<P>None that are loyal to live will aspire;</P>
<P>When a father commands his own offspring to perish</P>
<P>Any dutiful son will most surely expire.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The people he's going to kill are his own subjects. What are they to you? Take off your clothes, get some sleep and 'don't worry about the ancients.'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang, his tears still flowing, &#8220;you haven't a shred of compassion. The most important thing for us monks as we accumulate good deeds is to help others. How could this deluded king be so set in his wickedness? Never have I ever heard that eating human hearts could prolong life. How could something so terrible not grieve me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't grieve so, Master,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;When you present our passport tomorrow and seethe king you can talk to him about it. Even if he doesn't accept your advice you'll be able to see what the Elder of the Nation looks like. Probably he's an evil spirit who's thought all this up because he wants to eat human hearts.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wujing is right,&#8221; said Brother Monkey. &#8220;Go to bed now, Master, and tomorrow morning I'll go to court with you to see what this Elder of the Nation is like. If he's human he's probably a heretic who doesn't follow orthodox ways but believes in drugs, and I'll convert him with the essential teachings of intrinsic nature. If he's an evil spirit I'll catch him, show the king what he is, and urge the king to control his desires and build up his strength. Whatever happens I won't let him kill those children.&#8221;</P>
<P>As soon as he heard this Sanzang bowed to Monkey with great courtesy and said, &#8220;What an excellent suggestion! But when we see the deluded king we must say nothing about this in case he thinks we are guilty of not knowing our place and spreading slander. What could we do if that happened?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've got my magic powers,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;First of all I'm going to get the little boys in the coops away from the city so that he'll have nobody to take the hearts out of tomorrow. The local officials will of course report this and the king will be bound either to order a discussion with the Elder of the Nation or else to demand more information. This will give us a chance to submit our memorial without getting ourselves into trouble.&#8221; Sanzang was very pleased.</P>
<P>&#8220;How are you going to get the children out of the town now?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;If you really can rescue them you will be doing the greatest of good deeds, worthy disciple. But do it quick, because if you lose any time you may be too late.&#8221;</P>
<P>Summoning up his might Monkey stood up and gave Pig and Friar Sand their parting instructions: &#8220;Sit here with the master while I do my stuff. If you notice a magical wind blowing that'll be the boys leaving the city.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang and the other two disciples said, &#8220;We invoke the Saviour Bhaisajya-guru Buddha. We invoke the Saviour Bhaisajya-guru Buddha.&#8221;</P>
<P>Once outside the doors the Great Sage whistled, rose into mid-air, made a spell with his hands and said the magic words, called out &#8220;<I>Om</I> pure dharma world,&#8221; and summoned the city god, the local deities, the officiating immortals, the Protectors of the Faith of the four quarters and the center, the Four Duty Gods, the Six Dings and the Six Jias and the Guardians of the Teaching.</P>
<P>They all came to him where he was in midair, bowed and said, &#8220;Great Sage, what is the urgent business on which you have summoned us in the middle of the night?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My journey has brought me to Bhiksuland,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;where the king is a bad one who believes in evil doctrines. He wants to take the hearts out of little boys to make the adjuvant to a medicine that he hopes will make him live for ever. My master finds this utterly horrible and has asked me to rescue the boys and destroy the demon. That is why I've asked all you gentlemen here. I want you to use your magical powers to lift all the little boys, coops and all, over the city wall into a mountain hollow or somewhere deep in a forest. Keep them there for a day or two. Give them fruit to eat and don't let them go hungry. Keep watch over them in secret and don't frighten them or make them cry. When I've eliminated the evil, brought the country back to good government and persuaded the king to mend his ways and am about to leave, you must bring them back to me.&#8221;</P>
<P>The gods all listened to their orders then brought their clouds down to land so that they could use their magical powers. The city was filled with a blustering negative wind that brought with it an all-pervasive and sinister fog.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>All the stars in the sky were obscured by the negative wind;</P>
<P>The moon was blacked out by the magical fog for many a mile.</P>
<P>At first the wind was gusty,</P>
<P>And then it blew like a hurricane.</P>
<P>When it was gusting</P>
<P>All ran to the gateways to rescue their children;</P>
<P>Then in the hurricane</P>
<P>They wanted to save their own flesh and blood in the coops.</P>
<P>The air turned so chilly that none dared show their heads;</P>
<P>The cold was so piercing that clothes froze like iron.</P>
<P>Vainly did parents look all around;</P>
<P>The families all were stricken with grief.</P>
<P>The sinister wind blew right across the land</P>
<P>As the boys in their baskets were carried off by the gods.</P>
<P>Although that was a night of bereavement and grief</P>
<P>Joy was coming to all the next day.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>There is another poem about it that goes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Compassion has always been strong in the Sakyamuni faith;</P>
<P>The achievement of goodness explains the Great Vehicle.</P>
<P>A multitude of holy ones all accumulate goodness;</P>
<P>For the Three Refuges and Five Precepts harmony is needed.</P>
<P>The land of Bhiksu was not to be ruined by its monarch</P>
<P>When a thousand little boys were to forfeit their lives.</P>
<P>Monkey and his master had brought them to safety,</P>
<P>Which conferred more merit than the Great Wisdom.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>By the third watch of the night the gods had carried all the coops off and hidden them in all the safe places. Monkey then landed his auspicious light and went straight back to the government hostel, where to his secret delight he could hear the other three still chanting, &#8220;We invoke the Saviour Bhaisajya-guru Buddha.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; he said, going up to them, &#8220;I'm back. What was the negative wind like?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Terrific,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;How did the rescue of the children go?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Every single one of them has been saved,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;They'll all be brought back when we set out again.&#8221; The master thanked him over and over again before finally going to sleep.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Sanzang awoke at dawn he dressed himself in his best vestments and said, &#8220;Wukong, I am going to the early audience to present our passport.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you go by yourself, Master,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;I'm afraid that you won't be able to manage. Let me go with you. Then I'll be able to find out about the evil in this country.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you go you will refuse to pay homage,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;and the king may well take it amiss.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I won't be seen,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'll go with you in secret and protect you.&#8221; This pleased Sanzang very much. He had told Pig and Friar Sand to look after the luggage and horse and was just about to set out when the superintendent of the hostel came in to see him. The superintendent was struck by the difference between vestments he wore this day compared with what he had been wearing the day before.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>His cassock was of brocade, set with exotic gems;</P>
<P>On his head he wore a gold-topped Vairocana mitre.</P>
<P>He held a nine-ringed monastic staff</P>
<P>And hid a divine radiance in his breast.</P>
<P>The passport was fastened tightly to his body,</P>
<P>Wrapped in brocade inside another cloth.</P>
<P>He moved like an arhat come down to earth;</P>
<P>His face was truly that of a living Buddha.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the superintendent had greeted Sanzang courteously he murmured into his ear advice against meddling in matters that were none of his business. Sanzang nodded and assented. The Great Sage stole to a place by the gate, said the words of a spell, shook himself and turned into the tiniest of insects that flew with a high-pitched hum to Sanzang's mitre.</P>
<P>Sanzang left the government hostel and headed straight for the palace.</P>
<P>Arriving at the palace gates Sanzang saw a eunuch officer to whom he bowed and said, &#8220;This humble monk has been sent by the Great Tang in the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven. Now that I have reached your distinguished country I must present my passport to be inspected and returned. I beg Your Excellency to report this to His Majesty.&#8221; This the eunuch duly did.</P>
<P>The king was very pleased. &#8220;A monk from afar must be a holy man,&#8221; he said, ordering that Sanzang be asked in. When the venerable elder had paid his respects at the foot of the steps of the throne hall he was invited to enter the hall and take a seat. Sanzang thanked the king and sat down. The king looked weak and enervated. When he raised his hands to make a polite salutation he could not do so properly, and he was incapable of continuous speech. His right was so blurred that he had to make several attempts to read the document that Sanzang handed to him before he could sign, seal and return it to the Tang Priest, who put it away again.</P>
<P>The king was just about to ask why they were fetching the scriptures when one of his aides reported, &#8220;His Excellency the Elder of the Nation is here.&#8221; Leaning on one of his young eunuch attendants the king struggled down from his throne to greet the Elder. Sanzang hastily got to his feet, stood to one side and looked round to see that the Elder of the Nation was an aged Taoist who advanced with a swagger towards the steps of the throne.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On his head he wore a goose-yellow silken cap,</P>
<P>Round his body a scented cloak of silk and crane feathers,</P>
<P>And at his waist a triple sash of blue velvet.</P>
<P>On his feet were sandals of hemp and grasscloth;</P>
<P>At the top of his rattan stick coiled a dragon.</P>
<P>The pouch at his chest was embroidered with dragon, phoenix and flowers.</P>
<P>His jadelike face radiated well-being;</P>
<P>A gray beard blew about his chin.</P>
<P>Flames shot from golden pupils</P>
<P>In eyes even longer than his eyebrows.</P>
<P>Clouds followed his steps</P>
<P>As he wandered through incense-laden mists.</P>
<P>The officials below the steps received him with obeisances,</P>
<P>Announcing the presence of the Elder of the Nation.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When he reached the throne hall the Elder of the Nation performed no obeisance but arrogantly strode straight in. The king leaned forward in a bow and said, &#8220;We are most fortunate that you have condescended to make your immortal way here, Elder of the Nation.&#8221; He ordered that an embroidered stool be set on his left for the Elder to sit on.</P>
<P>Taking a step forward Sanzang bowed and said, &#8220;Greetings, Elder of the Nation.&#8221; The Elder sat majestically on his seat, but instead of returning Sanzang's courtesy he turned to the king and asked, &#8220;Where's this monk from?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He has been sent by the Tang court in the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven,&#8221; the king replied, &#8220;and is here to present his passport for inspection.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The road West is dark and dismal,&#8221; said the Elder of the Nation with a smile. &#8220;There's nothing good about it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The West has always been a land of bliss,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;How could it not be good?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There is an old saying we once heard that monks are disciples of the Buddha,&#8221; said the king. &#8220;I wonder whether it is true that by being a monk and turning to the Buddha one can live for ever.&#8221; When Sanzang heard this he put his hands together and replied:</P>
<P>&#8220;One who becomes a monk gets away from all kinds of causation. By understanding nature he learns that all dharmas are empty. Great wisdom is casual and drifts in non-living. The true secret is hidden; it wanders in extinction. When the three worlds are empty all origins are ordered; when the six sense-organs are purified all troubles are finished. To be resolute, single-minded and enlightened one must understand the heart. When the heart is purified it can shine alone; when the heart is sincere all regions are imbued with it. The true appearance has neither deficiency nor excess and can be seen in life. The images of illusion always decay. Why seek what is beyond one's lot? The way to enter meditation is through meritorious deeds and by sitting in silence; the root of cultivating one's conduct truly is charity and kindness. Great skill appears as clumsiness and knows that all deeds are achieved through inaction. The finest plans involve no calculation; everything must be left alone. It only needs one heart not to move for every action to be perfect. It is truly absurd to try to strengthen the male by drawing on the female and nonsensical to try to extend one's years by taking elixirs. The only essential is that all the causation of every speck of dust must be discarded and that every type of matter should be empty. Live plain and pure; let your desires be few. Then naturally you will enjoy life without end for ever.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the Elder of the Nation heard this he laughed at it. &#8220;Phooey,&#8221; he said, pointing at the Tang Priest, &#8220;phooey! You're talking a load of rubbish, monk. Fancy you talking about understanding nature, and you a member of the faith that preaches nirvana. You don't have any idea of where nature comes from. Sitting still like a dead tree to enter dhyana is wasted effort as far as self-cultivation and tempering are concerned. In the words of the saying,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sit, sit, sit;</P>
<P>Your backside's split.</P>
<P>The fire's too hot;</P>
<P>Good that's not.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>What you don't realize at all is this:</P>
<P>&#8220;One who cultivates immortality has strong bones; one who attains the Way has the most magical spirit. Carrying his bowl and ladle he goes into the mountains to visit his friends; he picks every kind of herb to succor humanity. He makes a rainhat from immortal flowers, plucks the fragrant orchid to make his bed. He sings, claps and dances, then goes to sleep. When expounding the Way he teaches the doctrines of the Supreme One; he eliminates the evil of the human world with holy water. He takes the finest breath of heaven and earth, gathers the essence of the sun and moon. By controlling the negative and positive forces he creates the elixir; through the mastery of fire and water the foetus is formed. On the sixteenth day of the month the negative is eliminated, hazily and obscurely. In the twenty-seventh day of winter the positive begins to grow, darkly and mysteriously. He gathers the herbs of each of the four seasons, refining his elixir to nourish the nine transformations. Astride his blue phoenix he ascends to the purple palace; riding his white crane he goes to the jasper capital. He visits all the splendors of Heaven, showing the efficacy of the wonderful Way. Just compare it with the dhyana teachings of your Sakyamuni, your elimination of atman and your nirvana that enables you to shuffle off your stinking husk. None of this lifts you out of the worldly dust. Among the Three Teachings it is supreme; the Way alone has always been esteemed.&#8221;</P>
<P>The king was delighted to hear this exposition, and all the court officials exclaimed with admiration, &#8220;That's splendid, 'the Way alone has always been esteemed.'&#8220; Sanzang was overcome by humiliation at all this praise going to his rival. The king then told his department of foreign relations to lay on a banquet of vegetarian food for the monks from a far country when they left the city to travel West.</P>
<P>Sanzang thanked the king for his kindness and withdrew. As he was leaving the throne hall and going out of the palace Monkey flew down from the top of his mitre to say into his ear, &#8220;Master, the Elder of the Nation is an evil spirit, and the king has been bewitched. Go back to the hostel and wait for your meal while I get some information here.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang understood this and left through the main gates of the palace.</P>
<P>Of him we will say no more. Watch Monkey as he flies straight to a jade screen in the throne hall and lands on it. From the ranks of officials the military commanders of the capital stepped forward to report, &#8220;Your Majesty, last night a cold wind carried away the little boys in their goose coops from every house in every ward of the city. They have vanished without a trace, coops and all.&#8221;</P>
<P>This report both alarmed and angered the king, who said to the Elder of the Nation, &#8220;Heaven must be destroying us. We had the good fortune to be given the formula for your elixir after months of serious illness that the royal physicians have been unable to cure. We were preparing to have the boys cut open at noon today and their hearts taken out to be made into the adjuvant for the elixir. Never did we imagine that a cold wind would blow them all away. If this is not Heaven destroying us what is it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't upset yourself,&#8221; the Elder of the Nation replied with a smile. &#8220;By blowing them away Heaven is giving Your Majesty eternal life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you maintain that Heaven is giving me eternal life when they have just been blown away?&#8221; the king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;When I was coming to court this morning,&#8221; the Elder of the Nation replied, &#8220;I saw a uniquely marvellous adjuvant that will be far superior to 1,111 little boys' hearts. They would only lengthen Your Majesty's life by a thousand years, but if you take my elixir with this other adjuvant you can live for a hundred million years.&#8221;</P>
<P>The king was mystified about what this adjuvant could be, but only after repeated questions did the Elder of the Nation reply, &#8220;The monk from the East who is being sent to fetch the scriptures has pure organs and regular features. His is the body of one who has cultivated his conduct for ten lifetimes. He has been a monk since childhood and has preserved his masculine purity, which all makes him ten thousand times better than those little boys. If you can make a decoction from his heart with which to take my elixir I can guarantee you an extremely long life.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the deluded king heard this he believed it completely. &#8220;Why didn't you tell us before?&#8221; he said to the Elder of the Nation. &#8220;If it's as good as you say we should have kept him when he was here just now and not let him go.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This will present no problem,&#8221; the Elder of the Nation said. &#8220;You have already told the department of foreign relations to give him a vegetarian banquet. He can't possibly leave the city before eating the meal. Urgent orders must be issued to have the gates firmly closed. Send troops to surround the government hostel and bring that monk here. First we will try to win his heart by treating him with courtesy. If he agrees we will cut it out and give him a royal burial, build him a temple and make offerings to him. If he will not agree we'll use rough methods. We can tie him up and cut it out. There will be no problem.&#8221; The deluded ruler accepted this suggestion and ordered that all the gates be closed. He then sent the officers and men of the royal guard to surround the hostel.</P>
<P>Having found all this out Monkey flew straight to the hostel, turned back into himself and said to the Tang Priest, &#8220;Something terrible's happened, Master, something terrible.&#8221; Sanzang had just begun to eat the king's vegetarian banquet with Pig and Friar Sand when this sudden announcement scattered his three bodily spirits and made smoke come out of his seven orifices. He collapsed in the dust, pouring with sweat, and unable to see clearly or speak.</P>
<P>Friar Sand was so alarmed he came forward to help him back to his feet, calling, &#8220;Wake up, Master, wake up.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What's so terrible?&#8221; Pig asked. &#8220;What's so terrible? You should have broken the news gently instead of giving the master such a scare.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When the master left the palace I went back to keep an eye on things,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;That Elder of the Nation is an evil spirit. A moment later the city garrison came to report about the cold wind carrying the little boys away. This upset the king, but the Elder of the Nation cheered him up by saying that this was Heaven giving him eternal life. He wants to use your heart as an adjuvant for the elixir of immortality, Master. The deluded king has accepted this wicked suggestion and ordered his best troops to surround this hostel. He's also sent an aide to ask you for your heart, Master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a merciful and compassionate chap you are,&#8221; said Pig with a laugh. &#8220;You saved the boys and made the wind blow all right, but now you've got us in this disastrous mess.&#8221;</P>
<P>Trembling and shaking, Sanzang dragged himself to his feet, seized hold of Monkey and said imploringly, &#8220;Good disciple, how are we to get out of this?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you want to get out of this,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;there'll have to be a switch.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean by a switch?&#8221; Friar Sand asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you want to survive,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;the disciple will have to become the master and the master the disciple. Do that and we'll be safe.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Save my life,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;and I will gladly become your disciple or even your disciple's disciple.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case there must be no hesitation,&#8221; Monkey replied, continuing, &#8220;Pig, mix up some mud at once.&#8221; The idiot loosened some earth with his rake then, not daring to go outside for water, lifted his tunic to make some water himself. With this he mixed up a lump of foul-smelling mud that he handed to Monkey. Monkey had no option but to beat it out flat and press it against his face so that it looked like a monkey's face. Then he told his master to stand up and neither move nor say anything while he placed the mask on his face, said the words of a spell, blew a magic breath and said, &#8220;Change!&#8221;</P>
<P>The venerable elder now looked just like Monkey. He took off his own clothes and put on Monkey's while Monkey dressed in his master's clothes, made a spell with his hands, said the magic words, shook himself and made himself look just like the Tang Priest. Even Pig and Friar Sand could not tell that he really was not.</P>
<P>Just when they had completed the disguises together there came the sound of gongs and drums as a dense forest of spears and swords appeared. The commanders of the royal guard had surrounded the hostel with their three thousand men. A royal aide came into the main hall of the hostel to ask, &#8220;Where is the reverend gentleman from the Tang court in the East?&#8221;</P>
<P>The superintendent of the hostel anxiously fell to his knees and said, pointing, &#8220;In the guest room over there.&#8221;</P>
<P>The aide then went into the room and said, &#8220;Venerable elder from Tang, His Majesty has sent for you.&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig and Friar Sand stood on either side of the imitation Monkey to guard him while the imitation Tang Priest went out through the door, bowed and said, &#8220;Your Excellency, what does His Majesty wish to say to me? Why has he sent for me?&#8221; The aide stepped forward to grab hold of him and say, &#8220;You and I are going to the palace. His Majesty must have some use for you.&#8221; Alas!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Wickedness was stronger than goodness and mercy;</P>
<P>Goodness and mercy only led to catastrophe.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know whether they were to survive this departure listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>比丘怜子遣阴神</p>
<p>金殿识魔谈道德</p>
</div>
<p>一念才生动百魔，修持最苦奈他何！但凭洗涤无尘垢，也用收拴有琢磨。扫退万缘归寂灭，荡除千怪莫蹉跎。管教跳出樊笼套，行满飞升上大罗。话说孙大圣用尽心机，请如来收了众怪，解脱三藏师徒之难，离狮驼城西行。又经数月，早值冬天，但见那岭梅将破玉，池水渐成冰。红叶俱飘落，青松色更新。淡云飞欲雪，枯草伏山平。满目寒光迥，阴阴诱骨泠。师徒们冲寒冒冷，宿雨餐风，正行间，又见一座城池。三藏问道：</p>

<p>“悟空，那厢又是甚么所在？”行者道：“到跟前自知，若是西邸王位，须要倒换关文；若是府州县，径过。”师徒言语未毕，早至城门之外。三藏下马，一行四众进了月城，见一个老军，在向阳墙下，偎风而睡。行者近前摇他一下，叫声：“长官。”那老军猛然惊觉，麻麻糊糊的睁开眼，看见行者，连忙跪下磕头，叫：“爷爷！”行者道：“你休胡惊作怪，我又不是甚么恶神，你叫爷爷怎的！”老军磕头道：“你是雷公爷爷！”行者道：“胡说！吾乃东土去西天取经的僧人。适才到此，不知地名，问你一声的。”那老军闻言，却才正了心，打个呵欠，爬起来，伸伸腰道：“长老，长老，恕小人之罪。此处地方，原唤比丘国，今改作小子城。”行者道：“国中有帝王否？”老军道：“有！有！有！”行者却转身对唐僧道：“师父，此处原是比丘国，今改小子城。但不知改名之意何故也。”唐僧疑惑道：“既云比丘，又何云小子？”八戒道：“想是比丘王崩了，新立王位的是个小子，故名小子城。”唐僧道：</p>

<p>“无此理！无此理！我们且进去，到街坊上再问。”沙僧道：“正是，那老军一则不知，二则被大哥唬得胡说，且入城去询问。”</p>

<p>又入三层门里，到通衢大市观看，倒也衣冠济楚，人物清秀。但见那：酒楼歌馆语声喧，彩铺茶房高挂帘。万户千门生意好，六街三市广财源。买金贩锦人如蚁，夺利争名只为钱。礼貌庄严风景盛，河清海晏太平年。师徒四众牵着马，挑着担，在街市上行彀多时，看不尽繁华气概，但只见家家门口一个鹅笼。三藏道：“徒弟啊，此处人家，都将鹅笼放在门首，何也？”八戒听说，左右观之，果是鹅笼，排列五色彩缎遮幔。呆子笑道：“师父，今日想是黄道良辰，宜结婚姻会友，都行礼哩。”行者道：“胡谈！</p>

<p>那里就家家都行礼！其间必有缘故，等我上前看看。”三藏扯住道：“你莫去，你嘴脸丑陋，怕人怪你。”行者道：“我变化个儿去来。”好大圣，捻着诀，念声咒语，摇身一变，变作一个蜜蜂儿，展开翅，飞近边前，钻进幔里观看，原来里面坐的是个小孩儿。</p>

<p>再去第二家笼里看，也是个小孩儿。连看八九家，都是个小孩儿，却是男身，更无女子。有的坐在笼中顽耍，有的坐在里边啼哭，有的吃果子，有的或睡坐。行者看罢，现原身回报唐僧道：</p>

<p>“那笼里是些小孩子，大者不满七岁，小者只有五岁，不知何故。”三藏见说，疑思不定。忽转街见一衙门，乃金亭馆驿。长老喜道：“徒弟，我们且进这驿里去，一则问他地方，二则撒喂马匹，三则天晚投宿。”沙僧道：“正是，正是，快进去耶。”四众欣然而入。只见那在官人果报与驿丞，接入门，各各相见。叙坐定，驿丞问：“长老自何方来？”三藏言：“贫僧东土大唐差往西天取经者，今到贵处，有关文理当照验，权借高衙一歇。”驿丞即命看茶，茶毕即办支应，命当直的安排管待。三藏称谢，又问：“今日可得入朝见驾，照验关文？”驿丞道：“今晚不能，须待明日早朝。今晚且于敝衙门宽住一宵。”</p>

<p>少顷，安排停当，驿丞即请四众，同吃了斋供，又教手下人打归客房安歇。三藏感谢不尽。既坐下，长老道：“贫僧有一件不明之事请教，烦为指示。贵处养孩儿，不知怎生看待。”驿丞道：“天无二日，人无二理。养育孩童，父精母血，怀胎十月，待时而生，生下乳哺三年，渐成体相，岂有不知之理！”三藏道：</p>

<p>“据尊言与敝邦无异。但贫僧进城时，见街坊人家，各设一鹅笼，都藏小儿在内。此事不明，故敢动问。”驿丞附耳低言道：</p>

<p>“长老莫管他，莫问他，也莫理他、说他。请安置，明早走路。”长老闻言，一把扯住驿丞，定要问个明白。驿丞摇头摇手只叫：</p>

<p>“谨言！”三藏一发不放，执死定要问个详细。驿丞无奈，只得屏去一应在官人等，独在灯光之下，悄悄而言道：“适所问鹅笼之事，乃是当今国主无道之事。你只管问他怎的！”三藏道：“何为无道？必见教明白，我方得放心。”驿丞道：“此国原是比丘国，近有民谣，改作小子城。三年前，有一老人打扮做道人模样，携一小女子，年方一十六岁，其女形容娇俊，貌若观音，进贡与当今，陛下爱其色美，宠幸在宫，号为美后。近来把三宫娘娘，六院妃子，全无正眼相觑，不分昼夜，贪欢不已。如今弄得精神瘦倦，身体尪羸，饮食少进，命在须臾。太医院检尽良方，不能疗治。那进女子的道人，受我主诰封，称为国丈。国丈有海外秘方，甚能延寿，前者去十洲、三岛，采将药来，俱已完备。但只是药引子利害：单用着一千一百一十一个小儿的心肝，煎汤服药，服后有千年不老之功。这些鹅笼里的小儿，俱是选就的，养在里面。人家父母，惧怕王法，俱不敢啼哭，遂传播谣言，叫做小儿城。此非无道而何？长老明早到朝，只去倒换关文，不得言及此事。”言毕抽身而退。唬得个长老骨软筋麻，止不住腮边泪堕，忽失声叫道：“昏君，昏君！为你贪欢爱美，弄出病来，怎么屈伤这许多小儿性命！苦哉！苦哉！痛杀我也！”有诗为证，诗曰：邪主无知失正真，贪欢不省暗伤身。因求永寿戕童命，为解天灾杀小民。僧发慈悲难割舍，官言利害不堪闻。灯前洒泪长吁叹，痛倒参禅向佛人。八戒近前道：“师父，你是怎的起哩？</p>

<p>专把别人棺材抬在自家家里哭！不要烦恼！常言道，君教臣死，臣不死不忠；父教子亡，子不亡不孝。他伤的是他的子民，与你何干！且来宽衣服睡觉，莫替古人耽忧。”三藏滴泪道：“徒弟啊，你是一个不慈悯的！我出家人，积功累行，第一要行方便。</p>

<p>怎么这昏君一味胡行！从来也不见吃人心肝，可以延寿。这都是无道之事，教我怎不伤悲！”沙僧道：“师父且莫伤悲，等明早倒换关文，觌面与国王讲过。如若不从，看他是怎么模样的一个国丈。或恐那国丈是个妖精，欲吃人的心肝，故设此法，未可知也。”行者道：“悟净说得有理。师父，你且睡觉，明日等老孙同你进朝，看国丈的好歹。如若是人，只恐他走了旁门，不知正道，徒以采药为真，待老孙将先天之要旨，化他皈正；若是妖邪，我把他拿住，与这国王看看，教他宽欲养身，断不教他伤了那些孩童性命。”三藏闻言，急躬身反对行者施礼道：“徒弟啊，此论极妙！极妙！但只是见了昏君，不可便问此事，恐那昏君不分远近，并作谣言见罪，却怎生区处？”行者笑道：“老孙自有法力，如今先将鹅笼小儿摄离此城，教他明日无物取心。地方官自然奏表，那昏君必有旨意，或与国丈商量，或者另行选报。</p>

<p>那时节，借此举奏，决不致罪坐于我也。”三藏甚喜，又道：“如今怎得小儿离城？若果能脱得，真贤徒天大之德！可速为之，略迟缓些，恐无及也。”行者抖擞神威，即起身吩咐八戒沙僧：</p>

<p>同师父坐着，等我施为，你看但有阴风刮动，就是小儿出城了“他三人一齐俱念：“南无救生药师佛！南无救生药师佛！”</p>

<p>这大圣出得门外，打个唿哨，起在半空，捻了诀，念动真言，叫声“唵净法界”，拘得那城隍、土地、社令、真官，并五方揭谛、四值功曹、六丁六甲与护教伽蓝等众，都到空中，对他施礼道：“大圣，夜唤吾等，有何急事？”行者道：“今因路过比丘国，那国王无道，听信妖邪，要取小儿心肝做药引子，指望长生。我师父十分不忍，欲要救生灭怪，故老孙特请列位，各使神通，与我把这城中各街坊人家鹅笼里的小儿，连笼都摄出城外山凹中，或树林深处，收藏一二日，与他些果子食用，不得饿损；再暗的护持，不得使他惊恐啼哭。待我除了邪，治了国，劝正君王，临行时送来还我。”众神听令，即便各使神通，按下云头，满城中阴风滚滚，惨雾漫漫：阴风刮暗一天星，惨雾遮昏千里月。</p>

<p>起初时，还荡荡悠悠；次后来，就轰轰烈烈。悠悠荡荡，各寻门户救孩童；烈烈轰轰，都看鹅笼援骨血。冷气侵人怎出头，寒威透体衣如铁。父母徒张皇，兄嫂皆悲切。满地卷阴风，笼儿被神摄。此夜纵孤恓，天明尽欢悦。有诗为证，诗曰：释门慈悯古来多，正善成功说摩诃。万圣千真皆积德，三皈五戒要从和。比丘一国非君乱，小子千名是命讹。行者因师同救护，这场阴骘胜波罗。当夜有三更时分，众神祇把鹅笼摄去各处安藏。</p>

<p>行者按下祥光，径至驿庭上，只听得他三人还念“南无救生药师佛”哩。他也心中暗喜，近前叫：“师父，我来也。阴风之起何如？”八戒道：“好阴风！”三藏道：“救儿之事，却怎么说？”</p>

<p>行者道：“已一一救他出去，待我们起身时送还。”长老谢了又谢，方才就寝。</p>

<p>至天晓，三藏醒来，遂结束齐备道：“悟空，我趁早朝，倒换关文去也。”行者道：“师父，你自家去恐不济事，待老孙和你同去，看那国丈邪正如何。”三藏道：“你去却不肯行礼，恐国王见怪。”行者道：“我不现身，暗中跟随你，就当保护。”三藏甚喜，吩咐八戒沙僧看守行李马匹，却才举步，这驿丞又来相见。看这长老打扮起来，比昨日又甚不同，但见他：身上穿一领锦襕异宝佛袈裟，头戴金顶毗卢帽。九环锡杖手中拿，胸藏一点神光妙。通关文牒紧随身，包裹袋中缠锦套。行似阿罗降世间，诚如活佛真容貌。那驿丞相见礼毕，附耳低言，只教莫管闲事，三藏点头应声。大圣闪在门旁，念个咒语，摇身一变，变做个蟭蟟虫儿，嘤的一声，飞在三藏帽儿上，出了馆驿，径奔朝中。及到朝门外，见有黄门官，即施礼道：“贫僧乃东土大唐差往西天取经者，今到贵地，理当倒换关文。意欲见驾，伏乞转奏转奏。”</p>

<p>那黄门官果为传奏，国王喜道：“远来之僧，必有道行。”教请进来。黄门官复奉旨，将长老请入。长老阶下朝见毕，复请上殿赐坐。长老又谢恩坐了，只见那国王相貌尪羸，精神倦怠：举手处，揖让差池；开言时，声音断续。长老将文牒献上，那国王眼目昏朦，看了又看，方才取宝印用了花押，递与长老，长老收讫。</p>

<p>那国王正要问取经原因，只听得当驾官奏道：“国丈爷爷来矣。”那国王即扶着近侍小宦，挣下龙床，躬身迎接，慌得那长老急起身，侧立于旁。回头观看，原来是一个老道者，自玉阶前摇摇摆摆而进。但见他：头上戴一顶淡鹅黄九锡云锦纱巾，身上穿一领箸顶梅沉香绵丝鹤氅。腰间系一条纫蓝三股攒绒带，足下踏一对麻经葛纬云头履。手中拄一根九节枯藤盘龙拐杖，胸前挂一个描龙刺凤团花锦囊。玉面多光润，苍髯颔下飘。</p>

<p>金睛飞火焰，长目过眉梢。行动云随步，逍遥香雾饶。阶下众官都拱接，齐呼国丈进王朝。那国丈到宝殿前，更不行礼，昂昂烈烈径到殿上。国王欠身道：“国丈仙踪，今喜早降。”就请左手绣墩上坐。三藏起一步，躬身施礼道：“国丈大人，贫僧问讯了。”那国丈端然高坐，亦不回礼，转面向国王道：“僧家何来？”</p>

<p>国王道：“东土唐朝差上西天取经者，今来倒验关文。”国丈笑道：“西方之路，黑漫漫有甚好处！”三藏道：“自古西方乃极乐之胜境，如何不好？”那国王问道：“朕闻上古有云，僧是佛家弟子，端的不知为僧可能不死，向佛可能长生？”三藏闻言，急合掌应道：“为僧者，万缘都罢；了性者，诸法皆空。大智闲闲，澹泊在不生之内；真机默默，逍遥于寂灭之中。三界空而百端治，六根净而千种穷。若乃坚诚知觉，须当识心：心净则孤明独照，心存则万境皆清。真容无欠亦无余，生前可见；幻相有形终有坏，分外何求？行功打坐，乃为入定之原；布惠施恩，诚是修行之本。大巧若拙，还知事事无为；善计非筹，必须头头放下。但使一心不行，万行自全；若云采阴补阳，诚为谬语，服饵长寿，实乃虚词。只要尘尘缘总弃，物物色皆空。素素纯纯寡爱欲，自然享寿永无穷。”那国丈闻言，付之一笑，用手指定唐僧道：</p>

<p>“呵！呵！呵！你这和尚满口胡柴！寂灭门中，须云认性，你不知那性从何而灭！枯坐参禅，尽是些盲修瞎炼。俗语云，坐，坐，坐，你的屁股破！火熬煎，反成祸。更不知我这修仙者，骨之坚秀；达道者，神之最灵。携箪瓢而入山访友，采百药而临世济人。摘仙花以砌笠，折香蕙以铺裀。歌之鼓掌，舞罢眠云。阐道法，扬太上之正教；施符水，除人世之妖氛。夺天地之秀气，采日月之华精。运阴阳而丹结，按水火而胎凝。二八阴消兮，若恍若惚；三九阳长兮，如杳如冥。应四时而采取药物，养九转而修炼丹成。跨青鸾，升紫府；骑白鹤，上瑶京。参满天之华采，表妙道之殷勤。比你那静禅释教，寂灭阴神，涅槃遗臭壳，又不脱凡尘！三教之中无上品，古来惟道独称尊！”那国王听说，十分欢喜，满朝官都喝采道，“好个惟道独称尊！惟道独称尊”长老见人都赞他，不胜羞愧。国王又叫光禄寺安排素斋，待那远来之僧出城西去。三藏谢恩而退，才下殿，往外正走，行者飞下帽顶儿，来在耳边叫道：“师父，这国丈是个妖邪，国王受了妖气。你先去驿中等斋，待老孙在这里听他消息。”三藏知会了，独出朝门不题。</p>

<p>看那行者，一翅飞在金銮殿翡翠屏中钉下，只见那班部中闪出五城兵马官奏道：“我主，今夜一阵冷风，将各坊各家鹅笼里小儿，连笼都刮去了，更无踪迹。”国王闻奏，又惊又恼，对国丈道：“此事乃天灭朕也！连月病重，御医无效。幸国丈赐仙方，专待今日午时开刀，取此小儿心肝作引，何期被冷风刮去。非天欲灭朕而何？”国丈笑道：“陛下且休烦恼。此儿刮去，正是天送长生与陛下也。”国王道：“见把笼中之儿刮去，何以返说天送长生？”国丈道：“我才入朝来，见了一个绝妙的药引，强似那一千一百一十一个小儿之心。那小儿之心，只延得陛下千年之寿；此引子，吃了我的仙药，就可延万万年也。”国王漠然不知是何药引，请问再三，国丈才说：“那东土差去取经的和尚，我观他器宇清净，容颜齐整，乃是个十世修行的真体。自幼为僧，元阳未泄，比那小儿更强万倍，若得他的心肝煎汤，服我的仙药，足保万年之寿。”那昏君闻言十分听信，对国丈道：“何不早说？若果如此有效，适才留住，不放他去了。”国丈道：“此何难哉！适才吩咐光禄寺办斋待他，他必吃了斋，方才出城。如今急传旨，将各门紧闭，点兵围了金亭馆驿，将那和尚拿来，必以礼求其心。如果相从，即时剖而取出，遂御葬其尸，还与他立庙享祭；如若不从，就与他个武不善作，即时捆住，剖开取之。有何难事！“那昏君如其言，即传旨，把各门闭了。又差羽林卫大小官军，围住馆驿。行者听得这个消息，一翅飞奔馆驿，现了本相，对唐僧道：“师父，祸事了！祸事了！”那三藏才与八戒、沙僧领御斋，忽闻此言，唬得三尸神散，七窍烟生，倒在尘埃，浑身是汗，眼不定睛，口不能言。慌得沙僧上前搀住，只叫：“师父苏醒！师父苏醒！”八戒道：“有甚祸事？有甚祸事？你慢些儿说便也罢，却唬得师父如此！”行者道：“自师父出朝，老孙回视，那国丈是个妖精。少顷，有五城兵马来奏冷风刮去小儿之事。</p>

<p>国王方恼，他却转教喜欢，道这是天送长生与你，要取师父的心肝做药引，可延万年之寿。那昏君听信诬言，所以点精兵来围馆驿，差锦衣官来请师父求心也。”八戒笑道：“行的好慈悯！</p>

<p>救的好小儿！刮的好阴风，今番却撞出祸来了！”三藏战兢兢的爬起来，扯着行者哀告道：“贤徒啊！此事如何是好？”行者道：</p>

<p>“若要好，大做小。”沙僧道：“怎么叫做大做小？”行者道：“若要全命，师作徒，徒作师，方可保全。”三藏道：“你若救得我命，情愿与你做徒子徒孙也。”行者道：“既如此，不必迟疑。”教：“八戒，快和些泥来。”那呆子即使钉钯，筑了些土，又不敢外面去取水，后就掳起衣服撒溺，和了一团臊泥，递与行者。行者没奈何，将泥扑作一片，往自家脸上一安，做下个猴象的脸子，叫唐僧站起休动，再莫言语，贴在唐僧脸上，念动真言，吹口仙气，叫“变！”那长老即变做个行者模样，脱了他的衣服，以行者的衣服穿上。行者却将师父的衣服穿了，捻着诀，念个咒语，摇身变作唐僧的嘴脸，八戒沙僧也难识认。正当合心装扮停当，只听得锣鼓齐鸣，又见那枪刀簇拥。原来是羽林卫官，领三千兵把馆驿围了。又见一个锦衣官走进驿庭问道：“东土唐朝长老在那里？”慌得那驿丞战兢兢的跪下，指道：“在下面客房里。”</p>

<p>锦衣官即至客房里道：“唐长老，我王有请。”八戒沙僧左右护持假行者，只见假唐僧出门施礼道：“锦衣大人，陛下召贫僧，有何话说？”锦衣官上前一把扯住道：“我与你进朝去，想必有取用也。”咦！这正是：妖诬胜慈善，慈善反招凶。毕竟不知此去端的性命何如，且听下回分解。</p>
