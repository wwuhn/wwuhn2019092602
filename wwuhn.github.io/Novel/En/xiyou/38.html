<P>The Royal Ghost Visits the Tang Priest at Night</P>
<P>Wukong's Magic Transformation Lures the Boy</P>
</div>
<P>Sanzang sat in the meditation hall of the Precious Wood Monastery reading the<I> Litany of Emperor Wu of Liang</I> and the<I> Peacock Sutra</I> until the third watch, when he finally put the scriptures back into their bags. Just when he was about to go to bed he heard a rushing noise and the whistling of a fiendish wind. Fearing that it would blow out his lamp, the venerable elder shielded the lamp with his sleeve as quickly as he could. To his consternation the lamp kept going on and off. By now he was so tired that he pillowed his head on the reading desk and took a nap. Although he had closed his eyes and was dozing, his mind stayed wide awake as he listened to the howling of the devil wind outside the window. It was a splendid wind. Indeed, there were</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Soughs and whistles,</P>
<P>Much scudding away.</P>
<P>It soughs and whistles, carrying the fallen leaves,</P>
<P>Blows the clouds scudding away.</P>
<P>All the stars in the sky go dark,</P>
<P>And the earth is covered with flying dust.</P>
<P>Sometimes fierce,</P>
<P>Sometimes gentle.</P>
<P>When it blows gentle, pine and bamboo sound clear;</P>
<P>When it blows fierce, the lakes have turbid waves.</P>
<P>The mountain birds grieve, unable to reach their perches;</P>
<P>The fish jump restlessly in the ocean.</P>
<P>Doors and windows blow off the halls,</P>
<P>Spirits and demons glare in the side-rooms.</P>
<P>All the vases in the Buddha hall crash to the ground;</P>
<P>The glass lamp is shaken loose and the flame blows out.</P>
<P>Incense-ash scatters as the burner tilts,</P>
<P>The candles flare when their stand leans over.</P>
<P>All the banners and hangings are torn,</P>
<P>As bell and drum towers are shaken to their roots.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As the wind died down for a while, the elder in his dozy state heard a muffled call of &#8220;Master&#8221; from outside the meditation hall. He looked up, and in his dream he saw a man standing there soaking wet who was weeping and saying &#8220;Master&#8221; over and over again.</P>
<P>Sanzang bowed towards him from his seat and said, &#8220;You must be a fiend, or a goblin, or an evil spirit or a monster trying to trick me in the middle of the night. But I'm not one given to desire or anger. I'm an upright monk on a pilgrimage to the West at the command of the Tang Emperor of the East to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures. I have three disciples who are all demon-quelling, monster-exterminating heroes. If they see you they will smash your body and bones to bits and pulverize you. But I am full of great compassion and will do what is expedient for you. Make yourself scarce this moment and never come into my meditation hall again.&#8221;</P>
<P>The person stayed there and replied, &#8220;Master, I'm not a demon or a ghost or a fiend or an evil spirit.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you're none of these,&#8221; retorted Sanzang, &#8220;what are you doing here in the middle of the night?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Take a good look at me, Master,&#8221; he said. When Sanzang took a really careful look he saw to his surprise that</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On his head he wore a heaven-touching hat,</P>
<P>And round his waist a belt of blue-green jade.</P>
<P>Dragons and phoenixes danced on his ochre robe;</P>
<P>His no-worry shoes were embroidered with clouds.</P>
<P>The white jade scepter he held was arrayed with constellations.</P>
<P>His face was like the eternal Emperor of Mount Tai,</P>
<P>His form like Wenchang, god of officialdom.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>At the sight of him Sanzang turned pale with shock. He bowed at once and called out at the top of his voice, &#8220;Which monarch are you, Your Majesty? Please be seated.&#8221; He hurried over to support the monarch, only to find he was holding on to thin air. He looked again and saw that the man was still there.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;which king are you? What country do you rule? I suppose that you must have fled here in the middle of the night because your country is in chaos or because you are being put upon by malicious ministers. Tell me your story.&#8221;</P>
<P>Only then did the man tell what had happened, the tears streaming down his cheeks and his forehead creased with frowns. &#8220;Father,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I live only some fifteen miles to the West of here, in the walled city where my dynasty was founded.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What is it called?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm telling you the truth, Father,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;When I established my regime I changed the name of the state to Wuji.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But why is Your Majesty in this terrible distress?&#8221; Sanzang continued.</P>
<P>&#8220;Father,&#8221; the other said, &#8220;there was a drought here five years ago so bad that no vegetation grew and the people were dying of starvation. It was appalling.&#8221;</P>
<P>Hearing this Sanzang nodded and said with a smile, &#8220;Your Majesty, there's an old saying that Heaven favours a well-governed country. I expect that you were not merciful towards your subjects. Even if there is a famine you have no business to flee from your city. Go back, open up your granaries, and give the people relief. Repent of your past sins and be good from now on. Pardon all those who have been wrongly condemned. Heaven's heart will of itself be moved in harmony, and wind and rains will come as they should.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But our granaries were empty,&#8221; the other said. &#8220;We had no money or grain left. The salaries of the officials and the military were in default, and we were eating no meat with our royal meals. We followed the example of Yu the Great when he brought the waters under control, sharing weal and woe with our subjects, taking baths to purify ourself, fasting, burning incense and praying day and night. This went on for three years, but the drought continued to be so bad that the rivers and wells dried up. Just when the crisis was desperate a Quanzhen Taoist wizard came from the Zhongnan Mountains. He could summon wind and rain, and turn stones to gold with a touch. First he went to see our civil and military officials, and then he came to see us. We invited him to come to the altar to pray, and he got results. Wherever he pointed his magic wand there would be a torrential downpour. We thought that three feet of rain would be sufficient, but he said that it would not be enough to restore fertility after so long a time and gave an extra two inches of rain. Seeing how generous he was we kowtowed to him and took him as our sworn brother.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Then Your Majesty<I> is</I> extremely fortunate,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;In what way?&#8221; the other asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;If that Quanzhen wizard has the powers to make it rain whenever you like and you can get him to turn things to gold at will, then what is so terrible that you have to flee here from your city?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We only ate at the same table and slept in the same room for two years. Then one spring day when the red apricot and the peach tree were in blossom all the gentlemen, ladies and princes went out to enjoy the beauty of the season. After the civil and military officials had returned to their offices and the royal spouses and concubines gone back to their quarters we were strolling hand-in-hand with the wizard in the palace garden. When we reached the eight-sided well with a glazed-tile top he threw something into the well&#8212;we don't know what it was&#8212;that made it shine with golden light. Luring us to the edge of the well to look at this treasure he had the murderous notion of pushing us in with a splash and placing a flagstone over the top of the well. He piled earth over this then put in a plantain on top of it. So we have already been dead for three years, alas. We are the ghost of one who was wickedly murdered by being pushed down a well.&#8221;</P>
<P>On learning that he was a ghost the Tang Priest felt weak all over, and his hairs stood on end. But he had to bring himself to continue his questioning. &#8220;Your Majesty, what you say is all wrong. If you have been dead for three years, why didn't the civil and military officials or your queens go looking for you when they attended court for audiences with Your Majesty?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Father,&#8221; the ghost replied, &#8220;his powers are ones rarely seen in the world. As soon as he had killed us he shook himself and turned into an identical likeness of us. Now he is the master of our country, the secret thief of our territory. Our civil and military officials, the four hundred courtiers, the three queens and the consorts and concubines of the six compounds all now belong to him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You are a coward, Your Majesty,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;How are we a coward?&#8221; the ghost asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;even if the monster has the magic powers to turn into your double and steal your kingdom, undetected by your civil and military officials or by your queens and consorts, so that only you know the truth and you are dead, why have you not brought a case against him in the Underworld court of King Yama? There you could lodge a complaint and complain of the wrongs you have suffered.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But his magic powers are so extensive and he is so well in with all the relevant officials,&#8221; replied the ghost. &#8220;He's always drinking with the city god, and he's connected with all the dragon kings. The Heaven-equaling God of Mount Tai is a friend of his, and all the Ten Kings of the Underworld are his sworn brothers. We have nowhere to turn if we want to bring a case against him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;if you are powerless to bring a case against him in the Underworld then why come to the world of the living?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Father,&#8221; the other replied, &#8220;as a ghost of a man unjustly killed I would never have dared call upon you. Outside the monastery gates are the Heavenly Kings who Protect the Law, the Six Dings and the Six Jias, the Protectors of the Four Quarters and the Centre, the Four Duty Gods, and the Eighteen Guardians of the Faith, all with their horses saddled up. It was only a magic wind created by the Patroller of the Night that brought me here. He said that my three years of suffering were due to end and sent me to pay my respects to you, Father. He told me that your senior disciple is the Great Sage Equaling Heaven and that he is a very powerful killer of monsters and subduer of demons. I am here tonight to plead with you and beg you to come to my country, capture the evil monster, and expose his wickedness. We will be deeply grateful and repay you, Master, for your great kindness.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;Have you come to ask that my disciple should go to rid you of this fiend?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, that's right,&#8221; the other replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;That disciple of mine is good for little else,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;but subduing demons and capturing monsters is right up his alley. The only thing is, Your Majesty, that even if he's given the job he may not be able to carry it out.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; the ghost asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;That fiend must have stupendous magical powers if he can make himself so much like you that all the civil and military officials at court are happy with him and every one of the consorts and concubines in your harem is fond of him. Even though my disciple has some magic powers he should most certainly not resort to arms lightly. If he is captured and charged with high treason we will be thrown into jail. Then everything will be ruined.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But I still have someone I can trust at court,&#8221; the ghost said.</P>
<P>&#8220;That's splendid,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;quite splendid. No doubt it's a prince or a high official who was sent off to command a garrison somewhere.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the ghost, &#8220;it's my son the crown prince who lives in my own palace.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But surely the crown prince must have been banished by that fiend.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No, he hasn't been,&#8221; the ghost replied. &#8220;He spends his time in the throne hall and the Tower of Five Phoenixes studying with learned scholars or sitting beside that wizard on the throne. For the last three years the crown prince has been banned from the queen's palace and prevented from seeing Her Majesty.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;It has all been planned by that fiend,&#8221; said the ghost. &#8220;If the prince and his mother were to meet and start talking about things the truth would get out. He can only keep that throne if the two of them don't meet.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your troubles, like mine, must have been sent from Heaven,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;My father was murdered by pirates, one of whom seized my mother. Three months later I was born. I escaped with my life on the river and was rescued by my benefactor, the abbot of the Jinshan Monastery, who brought me up. I remember what it was like to be an orphan child, so I feel very sorry for a crown prince who has lost both his parents. But even though you still have your crown prince in the palace, how ever will I be able to see him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What would stop you?&#8221; the ghost asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;If he is under such close control from the fiends,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;that he can't even see his own mother, how will a mere monk like myself get to see him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He will be going out tomorrow,&#8221; said the ghost.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;After tomorrow's dawn audience,&#8221; said the ghost, &#8220;he will lead three thousand people riding out of the city with falcons and hounds to go hunting. You will certainly be able to see him. When you do, tell him everything that I have told you and he'll trust you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But he is only a mortal,&#8221; replied Sanzang. &#8220;The fiend has him fooled in the palace, and he calls the fiend father several times a day. Why should he believe anything I say?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In case he doesn't I'll give you something that will be visible proof,&#8221; said the ghost.</P>
<P>&#8220;What?&#8221; asked Sanzang.</P>
<P>The ghost set down the gold-bordered white jade scepter he was holding and said, &#8220;This will be proof.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;When the wizard made himself look just like me,&#8221; the ghost replied, &#8220;there was one treasure he failed to copy. After he went back to the palace he said that the wizard has stolen it, and for the last three years it has been missing. If the crown prince sees it he will be reminded of me and I shall be able to take my revenge.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well then,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;I shall keep it and send my disciple to sort things out for you. Will you wait for the crown prince there?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I dare not stay there myself,&#8221; said the ghost. &#8220;I shall have to ask the Patroller of the Night to send another magic wind to blow me into the palace harem to appear in a dream to my first queen to tell her to co-operate with our son, with you, Father, and with your disciples.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang nodded and agreed. &#8220;Off you go then.&#8221;</P>
<P>The ghost of the murdered monarch kowtowed to take his leave. Sanzang was just stepping forward to see the ghost out when he tripped and went sprawling, giving himself such a fright that he woke up. So it had all been a dream. In the dim lamplight he called, &#8220;Disciples!&#8221; with alarm.</P>
<P>&#8220;What's he going on about 'trifles, trifles' for?&#8221; muttered Pig as he woke up. &#8220;How happy I used to be in the old days. I was a real tough guy. I lived on nothing but human flesh and I always ate my fill of it. You would have to be a monk and make us protect you on your journey. You told me I'd be a monk, but now you treat me more like your slave. I have to carry your baggage and lead your horse all day, and empty your chamber-pot and lie at the foot of your bed to warm your feet by night. You never let me get any sleep. Why are you calling for me now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;I had a strange dream when I dozed off with my head on the table just now.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Monkey, springing to his feet, &#8220;dreams come from the imagination. You get frightened of demons before you've even started to climb a mountain. You worry if you will ever reach the Thunder Monastery as it's so far away; and you miss Chang'an and wonder when you'll ever get back there. That's why you're so full of anxieties and dreams. Now I'm sincere and single-minded about going to the West to see the Buddha: no dreams ever come to me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;this dream of mine was no dream of home. No sooner had I closed my eyes than a great wind blew up and a king appeared outside the doors of the meditation hall. He said he was the monarch of the land of Wuji. He was soaking wet and in floods of tears.&#8221; Sanzang was just about to tell Brother Monkey all about the dream and everything he had been told in it.</P>
<P>&#8220;No need to tell me any more,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;He came to see you in a dream and was evidently bringing me some business. No doubt some fiend has usurped his throne. I'll have it out with the fiend. I'm sure I'll succeed the moment my cudgel hits him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But he told me that the fiend has tremendous magic powers,&#8221; warned Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;Tremendous, my eye!&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;As soon as he realizes that I've arrived he'll regret having nowhere to flee to.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I remember that the king also left me a treasure as proof,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't talk such nonsense,&#8221; replied Pig. &#8220;If you had a dream, that was that. Why all this chitchat?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;'Don't trust what seems to be straighter than straight, and beware that kindness is not really unkindness,'&#8220; put in Friar Sand. &#8220;Let's strike a light, open the doors, and see what we can see.&#8221;</P>
<P>So Brother Monkey opened the doors, and when they all looked outside they saw by the light of the moon and the stars that a gold-bordered white jade scepter was indeed lying by the side of the steps.</P>
<P>&#8220;What's this, brother?&#8221; asked Pig as he went over and picked it up.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's a treasure called a jade scepter that a monarch holds in his hands,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;and it makes me believe, Master, that the story's true. I'll take full responsibility for capturing the fiend tomorrow. But there are three favours I'll want you to do me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is great,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;really great. First you have a dream, then you have to tell him about it. He tricks people at every turn. Now he's asking you for three favours.&#8221;</P>
<P>Going back inside, Sanzang asked, &#8220;What three favours?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Tomorrow I want you to suffer on my behalf, be put upon, and catch a fever,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Any one of them would be bad enough,&#8221; smirked Pig. &#8220;I couldn't possibly take on all three.&#8221; Being an intelligent elder, the Tang Priest asked his disciple to explain why he wanted these three things done.</P>
<P>&#8220;There'll be no need for explanations,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Let me first give you a couple of things.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage plucked out a hair, blew a magic breath on it, called &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned it into a box of red and gold lacquer into which he placed the white jade scepter. &#8220;Master,&#8221; he said, &#8220;at dawn tomorrow you must put on your golden cassock and sit in the main hall of the monastery reciting scriptures with the box in your hands while I go and give that city the once-over. If he really is an evil spirit I'll kill him, and that will be one more good deed to my credit. If he isn't, then we won't get ourselves into trouble.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Excellent, excellent,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;If the prince doesn't ride out of the city, that will be that,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;and if he does leave the city as your dream predicted I'll definitely bring him here to see you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If he does come to see me, what shall I say to him?&#8221; asked Sanzang. &#8220;I'll give you a tip-off just before he comes,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I want you to open the lid of that box a little while I turn myself into a tiny monk two inches high, then take me into your hands with the scepter. When the prince comes into the monastery he's bound to worship the Buddhas. No matter how much he prostrates himself you are to pay no attention to him whatsoever. At the sight of you sitting there without moving he'll certainly have you arrested. Let him arrest you. Let him have you beaten, tied up or even killed if he likes.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Goodness!&#8221; exclaimed Sanzang. &#8220;With all his military authority he might really have me killed, and that would be terrible.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No problem,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'll be there. If things get sticky I'll look after you. If he questions you, tell him that you are the imperially commissioned monk sent from the East to go to the Western Heaven to worship the Buddha, fetch the scriptures and offer some treasures. When he asks you what treasures, tell him about the golden cassock and say, 'This is my third-grade treasure. I also have very fine treasures of the first and second grade.' When he asks you about them tell him that in this box you have a treasure that knows everything that has happened or will happen for five hundred years in the past, five hundred years in the present era, and another five hundred years after that&#8212;fifteen hundred years in all. Then let me out of the box and I'll tell the prince everything that you were told in your dream. If he believes me I'll go to capture the fiend. That will avenge his father and do our reputation a lot of good. But if he still doesn't believe you, show him the white jade scepter. My only worry is that he may be too young to remember it.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang was delighted with Brother Monkey's suggestions. &#8220;Disciple,&#8221; he said, &#8220;this is a superb plan. When I talk about my three treasures I can call one of them the golden cassock and another the white jade scepter. But what shall I call the one you turn yourself into?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Call it the King-maker,&#8221; said Monkey. Sanzang committed his instructions to memory. There was no way that the master and his disciples were going to sleep that night as they waited for the dawn. They only wished that by giving a nod they could make the sun rise, and blow away all the stars in the sky with a puff of breath.</P>
<P>Before long the Eastern sky did grow lighter. Monkey gave his parting instructions to Pig and Friar Sand: &#8220;You mustn't disturb the monks or go rushing wildly about the place. As soon as we've succeeded in our mission we'll continue on the journey with you.&#8221; No sooner had he taken his leave of them than he leapt up into mid-air with a whistling somersault. As he gazed due West with his fiery eyes he did indeed see the city. You may wish to ask how this was possible. We were told before that the city was only some fifteen miles away, so he would have been able to see it from that great height.</P>
<P>Brother Monkey went for a close look and saw thick clouds of demoniacal fog hanging over it, as well as an abundance of evil winds and vapors of injustice. Up in the air Monkey sighed and said,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Auspicious light would shine all around</P>
<P>If a true monarch now sat on the throne.</P>
<P>But black vapors hang over the gates of the palace</P>
<P>Now that a fiend has made it his own.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As he was sighing Monkey heard the clear report of a cannon. The Eastern gate of the city opened, and out poured a column of people and horses. It was indeed an impressive hunting party:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Leaving the Forbidden City at dawn,</P>
<P>They fan out into the bush,</P>
<P>Their coloured flags bright in the sun,</P>
<P>White horses galloping into the wind.</P>
<P>Alligator-skin drums pound</P>
<P>As fencing spears clash together.</P>
<P>Ferocious the corps of falconers,</P>
<P>Martial the masters of the bounds.</P>
<P>Cannons shake the heavens,</P>
<P>While sticky-poles gleam red in the sun.</P>
<P>Each man carries a crossbow;</P>
<P>Everyone has a bow at his waist.</P>
<P>The nets are spread at the foot of the hills,</P>
<P>And snares are set along the paths.</P>
<P>With a noise more frightening than thunder</P>
<P>A thousand horsemen surround a bear.</P>
<P>The cunning hare cannot save itself,</P>
<P>And the crafty river-deer is at its wit's end.</P>
<P>The foxes are fated to meet their doom,</P>
<P>And death now faces the roebuck.</P>
<P>The mountain pheasant cannot fly away,</P>
<P>Nor can its cousin on the plain escape.</P>
<P>They have taken over the mountains to catch wild beasts,</P>
<P>And are destroying the forests to shoot the flying birds.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After they all left the city they ambled through the Eastern outskirts and before long they were on high ground some six miles away where there was a military encampment. There was a very short general wearing a helmet, a breast plate, a sash round his waist, and eighteen metal plates. He held a blue-edged sword and sat astride a yellow charger. At his waist hung a ready-strung bow. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He was the image of a monarch,</P>
<P>With an emperor's noble visage.</P>
<P>His manners were not those of a petty man;</P>
<P>He moved like a true dragon.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As Brother Monkey looked down from mid-air he was delighted. &#8220;It goes without saying that he must be the crown prince. I think I'll play a trick on him.&#8221; The splendid Great Sage brought his cloud down to land and charged straight through the soldiers till he was before the crown prince's horse. Then he shook himself and turned himself into a white hare that started to run around frantically in front of the prince's horse, to the delight of the prince when he spotted it. Fastening an arrow to his bow, he drew it and hit the hare with his first shot.</P>
<P>Now the Great Sage had deliberately made the prince hit him, and with the quickness of his hand and eye he caught the arrowhead, dropped its feathers on the ground beside him, and started to run. Seeing his arrow hit the jade rabbit, the crown prince gave his horse its head and galloped ahead of the field in pursuit. He did not notice that when his horse galloped fast Monkey went like the wind, and that when the horse slowed down Monkey slowed down too, keeping only a little distance ahead. Watch as he leads the prince for mile after mile until he has lured him to the entrance of the Precious Wood Monastery. Here Monkey turned back into himself. The hare was no longer to be seen. There was only an arrow stuck into the lintel. Monkey rushed inside and told the Tang Priest, &#8220;He's here, Master, he's here.&#8221; Then with another transformation he turned himself into a tiny monk only two inches tall and squeezed into the red box.</P>
<P>Having chased the jade here as far as the monastery entrance the prince was most surprised when it disappeared and all that could be seen was an arrow fletched with vulture feathers stuck in the lintel.</P>
<P>&#8220;That's odd,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;very odd indeed. I'm quite sure that I hit the jade here. It can't have disappeared, leaving only my arrow here. I suppose that over the years the here must have become a spirit.&#8221; Pulling his arrow out he saw the words ROYALLY FOUNDED PRECIOUS WOOD MONASTERY written large over the entrance.</P>
<P>&#8220;I remember,&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;Some years ago when my father was in the palace's throne hall he sent officials with gifts of money and silk for the monks here to build a Buddha hall with Buddha statues. I didn't expect to come here today; but, as they say,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>To hear the monk's words when you pass a shrine</P>
<P>Is half a day's rest from the vanity of life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The crown prince dismounted and was just on the point of going inside when his personal guards and the three thousand horsemen galloped up in a great crowd, all pushing and shoving to get into the monastery. Deeply alarmed, the monks all came out to kowtow in greeting and lead the prince into the monastery's main hall, where he worshipped the statues of Buddhas. When he raised his head to look around before taking a stroll along the cloisters to see the sights he noticed a monk sitting right in the middle of the hall. &#8220;What effrontery!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I, the crown prince, have come to visit this monastery in person today, and although the monks did not have to travel to meet me as they were not notified by royal decree, this monk should at least have got up when I arrived with all my army. How dare he carry on sitting there?&#8221; He then ordered that the monk be arrested.</P>
<P>At the word &#8220;arrest&#8221; the officers standing to either side of the prince all seized Sanzang at once and got ropes ready to tie him up with. Monkey was now silently praying in his box: &#8220;Heavenly Kings who protect the dharma, Six Dings and Six Jias, I have a plan to subdue a demon, but this prince doesn't know what he's doing, and he's going to have my master tied up. You must protect him at once. If you allow him to be tied up you'll all be in trouble.&#8221; None of them dared disobey the Great Sage's secret instructions, and they did indeed protect Sanzang. The officers could not even touch Sanzang's shaven pate; it was as if he were surrounded by a wall, and they could get nowhere near him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you from, and how dare you insult me with this self-protection magic?&#8221; asked the crown prince. Sanzang went up to him, greeted him respectfully, and said, &#8220;I have no self-protection magic. I am the Tang Priest from the East going to worship the Buddha, fetch scrip-tares and offer treasures in the Thunder Monastery.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Eastern lands may be in the central plains,&#8221; replied the prince, &#8220;but they are extraordinarily poor. What treasures could you possibly have? Tell me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The cassock I am wearing,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;is the third-grade treasure. I also have treasures of the first and second grade that are much better things.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But that cassock only half covers you,&#8221; objected the prince. &#8220;It can't possibly be worth enough to deserve being called a treasure.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The cassock may not cover both shoulders,&#8221; replied Sanzang, &#8220;but there is a poem about it that goes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Of course a monk's habit leaves one shoulder bare,</P>
<P>But it covers a true Buddha free from worldly dust.</P>
<P>This was the True Achievement of thousands of needles;</P>
<P>Nine Pearls and Eight Treasures formed its spirit.</P>
<P>Fairies and holy women sewed it reverently</P>
<P>As a gift to a dhyana monk to purify his body.</P>
<P>Failure to greet Your Highness may be overlooked,</P>
<P>But what use is a man who avenges not his father?&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Hearing this put the crown prince into a fury. &#8220;You're talking nonsense, you impudent monk,&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;You can use your gift of the gab to overpraise your tatty little garment if you like. But you'll have to tell me what wrongs to my father I've failed to avenge.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang took a step forward, joined his hands in front of his chest, and said, &#8220;Your Royal Highness, how many great kindnesses does a man receive on earth?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Four,&#8221; the prince replied. &#8220;What are they?&#8221; Sanzang asked. &#8220;There is the kindness that heaven and earth show by covering and supporting him,&#8221; said the prince. &#8220;There is the kindness of the sun and moon in giving him light. There is the kindness of his monarch in giving him land and water. And there is the kindness of his parents who rear him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Highness is mistaken,&#8221; said Sanzang with a smile. &#8220;People are only covered and supported by heaven and earth, lit by sun and moon, and provided with land and water by their monarchs. They are not brought up by fathers and mothers.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Monk,&#8221; roared the prince in anger, &#8220;you shaven-headed food-scrounging tramp, you rebel, where would people come from if they did not have parents to rear them?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That is something, Your Highness,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;that I do not know. But I have in this box here a treasure called the King-maker who knows everything that has happened or will happen for five hundred years long ago, five hundred years in the present era, and five hundred years in the future after that, making fifteen hundred years in all. He will be able to tell us all about not knowing the kindness of being reared by parents. He has made me wait here for a very long time.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Bring him out and let me see him,&#8221; said the crown prince. As Sanzang opened the lid of the box Brother Monkey jumped out and started rushing around on both sides of it. &#8220;A tiny speck of a man like that couldn't possibly know anything,&#8221; said the prince.</P>
<P>As soon as Monkey heard this objection to his size he used his magic powers to stretch himself till he was three feet four or five inches tall, to the amazement of the soldiers, who said, &#8220;If he went on growing at that rate it would only be a day or two before he smashed through the sky.&#8221;</P>
<P>Once Brother Monkey was back to his original size he stopped growing. Only then did the prince address him: &#8220;King-maker, this old monk says that you know all the good and evil things of the past and the future. Do you use tortoise-shell or milfoil for your divinations? Or do you do it by interpreting sentences from books.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I don't use anything,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;All I need is my three inches of tongue to know everything about everything.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're talking nonsense again,&#8221; said the prince. &#8220;Even since the olden days the<I> Book of Changes</I> has been the best book for predicting the good and bad things that will happen in the world. It tells you what to avoid. That's why predictions can be made with tortoise-shell or yarrow. Why should I believe a word you say? You'll be making unfounded predictions of blessings and disasters to stir up trouble.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Be patient, Your Highness,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;until you've heard what I have to say. You are the eldest son of the monarch of Wuji. Five years ago there was a disastrous drought in your country that caused your people terrible suffering. The king your father and his ministers prayed devoutly for rain, but not a drop fell until a Taoist wizard came from the Zhongnan Mountains who could summon up winds and rain and turn stone into gold. Because the monarch was too fond of the wizard he took the wizard as his sworn brother. Is this all true so far?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said the crown prince, &#8220;go on.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When the wizard disappeared three years later who was then on the throne?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're quite right that there was a wizard,&#8221; said the prince, &#8220;and that His Majesty my father took him as his sworn brother. They slept in the same room and ate from the same table. Three years ago they were enjoying the beauty of the palace gardens when he used a gust of magic wind to seize my father's gold-bordered white jade scepter and carry it back with him to the Zhongnan Mountains. My father still misses him. Without him my father has no interest in any relaxation, and the palace gardens have been completely shut for the last three years. If the king isn't my father I'd like to know who else he could be.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey smiled, and kept on smiling without answering when the prince asked more questions. &#8220;Damn you,&#8221; said the furious prince, &#8220;what do you mean by just grinning at me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have a great deal more to say,&#8221; Brother Monkey finally replied, &#8220;but this is hardly the place to talk with so many people around.&#8221; Realizing that there must be something behind this remark the prince dismissed his soldiers with a wave of his sleeve. The officers in attendance passed the order on at once, sending the three thousand soldiers and their horses to pitch camp outside the monastery gates. Now that there was nobody else in the hall of the monastery the prince took the best seat. The venerable elder stood beside the prince with Monkey standing next to him. All the monks of the monastery withdrew.</P>
<P>Monkey then stopped smiling as he stepped forward and said. &#8220;Your Highness, it was in fact your very own parent that was carried away by the wind, and it is the rain-making wizard who now sits on the throne.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; said the prince, &#8220;nonsense. Ever since the wizard went away my father has kept the weather well regulated, the country strong and the people contented. But you say that he isn't my father. As I'm of such tender years I'll spare you; but if His Majesty my father heard you uttering such treason he'd have you arrested and hacked into ten thousand pieces.&#8221; He then shouted at Monkey to go away.</P>
<P>&#8220;What did I say?&#8221; Monkey asked the Tang Priest. &#8220;I said he won't believe me. Oh, well. The only thing I can do now is to give him that treasure in the hope of obtaining a passport so that we can carry on towards the Western Heaven.&#8221; Sanzang handed the red box to Monkey, who took it, shook himself, made it disappear&#8212;it was, after all, one of his own hairs transformed&#8212;and put it back on his body. He then presented the white jade scepter with both hands to the prince.</P>
<P>&#8220;A splendid monk you are, I must say,&#8221; exclaimed the crown prince on seeing it. &#8220;Five years ago you came here as a Quanzhen wizard to trick my family out of its treasure, and now you've come back as a Buddhist monk to present it to me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Arrest him,&#8221; the prince shouted, and as the order was passed on Sanzang pointed to Monkey in his terror and panic and said, &#8220;You wretched Protector of the Horses. All you can do is cause gratuitous trouble in which you get me involved.&#8221; Monkey rushed forward to stop him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Shut up,&#8221; he said, &#8220;or you'll give the game away. I'm not called King-maker. I have a real name.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Come here,&#8221; shouted the angry crown prince. &#8220;I want your real name so that I can hand you over to the legal authorities for sentence.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am this elder's senior disciple,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;My name is Sun Wukong. As I'm going with my master on his way to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven, we took shelter here last night. My master was reading sutras late last night, and he had a dream in the third watch. In this dream His Majesty your father told my master that the wizard had murdered him by pushing him into the eight-sided well with glazed tiles in the palace gardens. The wizard then turned himself into such a good likeness of your father that none of the officials at court could tell the difference. You were too young to know any better and banned from the harem. The garden was closed. This was because he was afraid that the truth would get out. His Majesty your father came last night specially to ask me to put the fiend down. I was worried in case the present king wasn't really an evil spirit, but when I took a look from up in the air I saw that he definitely is. I was just going to grab him when you rode out of the city to go hunting. The jade hare you hit with your arrow was me. I led you to this monastery to meet my master. Every word I have told you is the truth. You can recognize that white jade scepter; so why don't you bow in gratitude to the father who reared you and avenge him?&#8221;</P>
<P>At these words the crown prince was deeply distressed, and he said to himself in his grief, &#8220;Perhaps I shouldn't believe what he says, but it does seem to be rather convincing. But if I do believe him, however can I face my father in the palace?&#8221; He was indeed</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Caught upon the horns of a dilemma,</P>
<P>Wondering what on earth he ought to do.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Seeing that he was unable to make up his mind, Monkey went up to him and said, &#8220;No need for all these doubts, Your Highness. Why don't you ride back to the capital and ask Her Majesty the queen how the love between her and your father is compared with three years ago. That's the only question that will prove that I'm telling the truth.&#8221;</P>
<P>That changed the prince's mind for him. &#8220;That's it,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I'll ask my mother.&#8221; He sprang to his feet, put the scepter in his sleeve and was just about to go when Monkey tugged at his clothes and said, &#8220;If all your men and horses go back it'll give the game away and make it much harder for me to succeed. You must ride back alone and not draw attention to yourself or make a fuss. Don't go in through the main gate; use one of the back gates instead. And when you enter the women's quarters in the palace to see your mother, don't shout or make a lot of noise. You must keep your voice down and talk very quietly. That fiend probably has tremendous magical powers, and once the cat is out of the bag your mum's life won't be worth tuppence.&#8221;</P>
<P>The crown prince accepted these instructions with great respect, then went outside the monastery gates to give these orders to his officers: &#8220;Stay encamped here and do not move. I have some business to attend to. Wait till I come back and then we shall all return to the capital together.&#8221; Watch him:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Giving his orders to the army to encamp,</P>
<P>He rides back to the city as if on wings.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know what was said when he met the queen, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>鬼王夜谒唐三藏</p>
<p>悟空神化引婴儿</p>
</div>
<p>却说三藏坐于宝林寺禅堂中，灯下念一会《梁皇水忏》，看一会《孔雀真经》，只坐到三更时候，却才把经本包在囊里，正欲起身去睡，只听得门外扑剌剌一声响喨，淅零零刮阵狂风。</p>

<p>那长老恐吹灭了灯，慌忙将褊衫袖子遮住，又见那灯或明或暗，便觉有些心惊胆战。此时又困倦上来，伏在经案上盹睡，虽是合眼朦胧，却还心中明白，耳内嘤嘤听着那窗外阴风飒飒。</p>

<p>好风，真个那淅淅潇潇，飘飘荡荡。淅淅潇潇飞落叶，飘飘荡荡卷浮云。满天星斗皆昏昧，遍地尘沙尽洒纷。一阵家猛，一阵家纯。纯时松竹敲清韵，猛处江湖波浪浑。刮得那山鸟难栖声哽哽，海鱼不定跳喷喷。东西馆阁门窗脱，前后房廊神鬼。佛殿花瓶吹堕地，琉璃摇落慧灯昏。香炉鞍＋倒香灰迸，烛架歪斜烛焰横。幢幡宝盖都摇拆，钟鼓楼台撼动根。</p>

<p>那长老昏梦中听着风声一时过处，又闻得禅堂外，隐隐的叫一声“师父！”忽抬头梦中观看，门外站着一条汉子，浑身上下，水淋淋的，眼中垂泪，口里不住叫：“师父！师父！”三藏欠身道：“你莫是魍魉妖魅，神怪邪魔，至夜深时来此戏我？我却不是那贪欲贪嗔之类。我本是个光明正大之僧，奉东土大唐旨意，上西天拜佛求经者。我手下有三个徒弟，都是降龙伏虎之英豪，扫怪除魔之壮士。他若见了你，碎尸粉骨，化作微尘。此是我大慈悲之意，方便之心。你趁早儿潜身远遁，莫上我的禅门来。”那人倚定禅堂道：“师父，我不是妖魔鬼怪，亦不是魍魉邪神。”三藏道：“你既不是此类，却深夜来此何为？”那人道：“师父，你舍眼看我一看。”长老果仔细定睛看处，呀！只见他头戴一顶冲天冠，腰束一条碧玉带，身穿一领飞龙舞凤赭黄袍，足踏一双云头绣口无忧履，手执一柄列斗罗星白玉圭。面如东岳长生帝，形似文昌开化君。三藏见了，大惊失色，急躬身厉声高叫道：“是那一朝陛下？请坐。”用手忙搀，扑了个空虚，回身坐定。再看处，还是那个人。长老便问：“陛下，你是那里皇王？</p>

<p>何邦帝主？想必是国土不宁，谗臣欺虐，半夜逃生至此。有何话说，说与我听。”这人才泪滴腮边谈旧事，愁攒眉上诉前因，道：“师父啊，我家住在正西，离此只有四十里远近。那厢有座城池，便是兴基之处。”三藏道：“叫做甚么地名？”那人道：“不瞒师父说，便是朕当时创立家邦，改号乌鸡国。”三藏道：“陛下这等惊慌，却因甚事至此？”那人道：“师父啊，我这里五年前，天年干旱，草子不生，民皆饥死，甚是伤情。”三藏闻言，点头叹道：“陛下啊，古人云，国正天心顺。想必是你不慈恤万民，既遭荒歉，怎么就躲离城郭？且去开了仓库，赈济黎民；悔过前非，重兴今善，放赦了那枉法冤人。自然天心和合，雨顺风调。”那人道：“我国中仓禀空虚，钱粮尽绝，文武两班停俸禄，寡人膳食亦无荤。仿效禹王治水，与万民同受甘苦，沐浴斋戒，昼夜焚香祈祷。如此三年，只干得河枯井涸。正都在危急之处，忽然锺南山来了一个全真，能呼风唤雨，点石成金。先见我文武多官，后来见朕，当即请他登坛祈祷，果然有应，只见令牌响处，顷刻间大雨滂沱。寡人只望三尺雨足矣，他说久旱不能润泽，又多下了二寸。朕见他如此尚义，就与他八拜为交，以兄弟称之。”三藏道：“此陛下万千之喜也。”那人道：“喜自何来？”三藏道：“那全真既有这等本事，若要雨时，就教他下雨，若要金时，就教他点金。还有那些不足，却离了城阙来此？”那人道：“朕与他同寝食者，只得二年。又遇着阳春天气，红杏夭桃，开花绽蕊，家家士女，处处王孙，俱去游春赏玩。那时节，文武归衙，嫔妃转院。朕与那全真携手缓步，至御花园里，忽行到八角琉璃井边，不知他抛下些甚么物件，井中有万道金光。哄朕到井边看甚么宝贝，他陡起凶心，扑通的把寡人推下井内，将石板盖住井口，拥上泥土，移一株芭蕉栽在上面。可怜我啊，已死去三年，是一个落井伤生的冤屈之鬼也！”</p>

<p>唐僧见说是鬼，唬得筋力酥软，毛骨耸然，没奈何，只得将言又问他道：“陛下，你说的这话全不在理。既死三年，那文武多官，三宫皇后，遇三朝见驾殿上，怎么就不寻你？”那人道：“师父啊，说起他的本事，果然世间罕有！自从害了朕，他当时在花园内摇身一变，就变做朕的模样，更无差别。现今占了我的江山，暗侵了我的国土。他把我两班文武，四百朝官，三宫皇后，六院嫔妃，尽属了他矣。”三藏道：“陛下，你忒也懦。”那人道：“何懦？”三藏道：“陛下，那怪倒有些神通，变作你的模样，侵占你的乾坤，文武不能识，后妃不能晓，只有你死的明白。你何不在阴司阎王处具告，把你的屈情伸诉伸诉？”那人道：“他的神通广大，官吏情熟，都城隍常与他会酒，海龙王尽与他有亲，东岳天齐是他的好朋友，十代阎罗是他的异兄弟。因此这般，我也无门投告。”三藏道：“陛下，你阴司里既没本事告他，却来我阳世间作甚？”那人道：“师父啊，我这一点冤魂，怎敢上你的门来？山门前有那护法诸天、六丁六甲、五方揭谛、四值功曹、一十八位护教伽蓝，紧随鞍马。却才被夜游神一阵神风，把我送将进来，他说我三年水灾该满，着我来拜谒师父。他说你手下有一个大徒弟，是齐天大圣，极能斩怪降魔。今来志心拜恳，千乞到我国中，拿住妖魔，辨明邪正，朕当结草衔环，报酬师恩也！”三藏道：“陛下，你此来是请我徒弟与你去除却那妖怪么？”那人道：“正是！正是！”三藏道：“我徒弟干别的事不济，但说降妖捉怪，正合他宜。陛下啊，虽是着他拿怪，但恐理上难行。”那人道：“怎么难行？”三藏道：“那怪既神通广大，变得与你相同，满朝文武，一个个言和心顺；三宫妃嫔，一个个意合情投。我徒弟纵有手段，决不敢轻动干戈。倘被多官拿住，说我们欺邦灭国，问一款大逆之罪，困陷城中，却不是画虎刻鹄也？”那人道：“我朝中还有人哩。”三藏道：“却好！却好！想必是一代亲王侍长，发付何处镇守去了？”那人道：“不是。我本宫有个太子，是我亲生的储君。”三藏道：“那太子想必被妖魔贬了？”那人道：“不曾，他只在金銮殿上，五凤楼中，或与学士讲书，或共全真登位。自此三年，禁太子不入皇宫，不能彀与娘娘相见。”三藏道：“此是何故？”那人道：“此是妖怪使下的计策，只恐他母子相见，闲中论出长短，怕走了消息。故此两不会面，他得永住常存也。”三藏道：“你的灾屯，想应天付，却与我相类。当时我父曾被水贼伤生，我母被水贼欺占，经三个月，分娩了我。我在水中逃了性命，幸金山寺恩师救养成人。记得我幼年无父母，此间那太子失双亲，惭惶不已！”又问道：“你纵有太子在朝，我怎的与他相见？”那人道：“如何不得见？”三藏道：“他被妖魔拘辖，连一个生身之母尚不得见，我一个和尚，欲见何由？”那人道：“他明早出朝来也。”三藏问：“出朝作甚？”那人道：“明日早朝，领三千人马，架鹰犬出城采猎，师父断得与他相见。见时肯将我的言语说与他，他便信了。”三藏道：“他本是肉眼凡胎，被妖魔哄在殿上，那一日不叫他几声父王？他怎肯信我的言语？”那人道：“既恐他不信，我留下一件表记与你罢。”三藏问：“是何物件？”那人把手中执的金厢白玉圭放下道：“此物可以为记。”三藏道：“此物何如？”那人道：“全真自从变作我的模样，只是少变了这件宝贝。他到宫中，说那求雨的全真拐了此圭去了，自此三年，还没此物。我太子若看见，他睹物思人，此仇必报。”三藏道：“也罢，等我留下，着徒弟与你处置。却在那里等么？”那人道：“我也不敢等。我这去，还央求夜游神再使一阵神风，把我送进皇宫内院，托一梦与我那正宫皇后，教他母子们合意，你师徒们同心。”三藏点头应承道：“你去罢。”</p>

<p>那冤魂叩头拜别，举步相送，不知怎么踢了脚，跌了一个筋斗，把三藏惊醒，却原来是南柯一梦，慌得对着那盏昏灯，连忙叫：“徒弟！徒弟！”八戒醒来道：“甚么土地土地？当时我做好汉，专一吃人度日，受用腥膻，其实快活，偏你出家，教我们保护你跑路！原说只做和尚，如今拿做奴才，日间挑包袱牵马，夜间提尿瓶务脚！这早晚不睡，又叫徒弟作甚？”三藏道：“徒弟，我刚才伏在案上打盹，做了一个怪梦。”行者跳将起来道：“师父，梦从想中来。你未曾上山，先怕妖怪，又愁雷音路远，不能得到，思念长安，不知何日回程，所以心多梦多。似老孙一点真心，专要西方见佛，更无一个梦儿到我。”三藏道：“徒弟，我这桩梦，不是思乡之梦。才然合眼，见一阵狂风过处，禅房门外有一朝皇帝，自言是乌鸡国王，浑身水湿，满眼泪垂。”这等这等，如此如此，将那梦中话一一的说与行者。行者笑道：“不消说了，他来托梦与你，分明是照顾老孙一场生意。必然是个妖怪在那里篡位谋国，等我与他辨个真假。想那妖魔，棍到处立要成功。”三藏道：“徒弟，他说那怪神通广大哩。”行者道：“怕他甚么广大！早知老孙到，教他即走无方！”三藏道：“我又记得留下一件宝贝做表记。”八戒答道：“师父莫要胡缠，做个梦便罢了，怎么只管当真？”沙僧道：“不信直中直，须防仁不仁。我们打起火，开了门，看看如何便是。”行者果然开门，一齐看处，只见星月光中，阶檐上真个放着一柄金厢白玉圭。八戒近前拿起道：“哥哥，这是甚么东西？”行者道：“这是国王手中执的宝贝，名唤玉圭。师父啊，既有此物，想此事是真。明日拿妖，全都在老孙身上，只是要你三桩儿造化低哩。”八戒道：“好好好！</p>

<p>做个梦罢了，又告诵他。他那些儿不会作弄人哩？就教你三桩儿造化低。”三藏回入里面道：“是那三桩？”行者道：“明日要你顶缸、受气、遭瘟。”八戒笑道：一桩儿也是难的，三桩儿却怎么耽得？”唐僧是个聪明的长老，便问：“徒弟啊，此三事如何讲？”</p>

<p>行者道：“也不消讲，等我先与你二件物。”</p>

<p>好大圣，拔了一根毫毛，吹口仙气，叫声“变！”变做一个红金漆匣儿，把白玉圭放在内盛着，道：“师父，你将此物捧在手中，到天晓时，穿上锦襕袈裟，去正殿坐着念经，等我去看看他那城池。端的是个妖怪，就打杀他，也在此间立个功绩；假若不是，且休撞祸。”三藏道：“正是！正是！”行者道：“那太子不出城便罢，若真个应梦出城来，我定引他来见你。”三藏道：“见了我如何迎答？”行者道：“来到时，我先报知，你把那匣盖儿扯开些，等我变作二寸长的一个小和尚，钻在匣儿里，你连我捧在手中。那太子进了寺来，必然拜佛，你尽他怎的下拜，只是不睬他。他见你不动身，一定教拿你，你凭他拿下去，打也由他，绑也由他，杀也由他。”三藏道：“呀！他的军令大，真个杀了我，怎么好？”行者道：“没事，有我哩，若到那紧关处，我自然护你。他若问时，你说是东土钦差上西天拜佛取经进宝的和尚。他道有甚宝贝？你却把锦襕袈裟对他说一遍，说道：‘此是三等宝贝，还有头一等、第二等的好物哩’。但问处，就说这匣内有一件宝贝，上知五百年，下知五百年，中知五百年，共一千五百年过去未来之事，俱尽晓得，却把老孙放出来。我将那梦中话告诵那太子，他若肯信，就去拿了那妖魔，一则与他父王报仇，二来我们立个名节；他若不信，再将白玉圭拿与他看。只恐他年幼，还不认得哩。”三藏闻言大喜道：“徒弟啊，此计绝妙！但说这宝贝，一个叫做锦襕袈裟，一个叫做白玉圭，你变的宝贝却叫做甚名？”行者道：“就叫做立帝货罢。”三藏依言记在心上。师徒们一夜那曾得睡。盼到天明，恨不得点头唤出扶桑日，喷气吹散满天星。</p>

<p>不多时，东方发白。行者又吩咐了八戒、沙僧，教他两个：“不可搅扰僧人，出来乱走。待我成功之后，共汝等同行。”才别了唐僧，打了唿哨，一筋斗跳在空中，睁火眼平西看处，果见有一座城池。你道怎么就看见了？当时说那城池离寺只有四十里，故此凭高就望见了。行者近前仔细看处，又见那怪雾愁云漠漠，妖风怨气纷纷。行者在空中赞叹道：“若是真王登宝座，自有祥光五色云；只因妖怪侵龙位，腾腾黑气锁金门。”行者正然感叹。忽听得炮声响喨，又只见东门开处，闪出一路人马，真个是采猎之军，果然势勇，但见晓出禁城东，分围浅草中。彩旗开映日，白马骤迎风。鼍鼓冬冬擂，标枪对对冲。架鹰军猛烈，牵犬将骁雄。火炮连天振，粘竿映日红。人人支弩箭，个个挎雕弓。张网山坡下，铺绳小径中。一声惊霹雳，千骑拥貔熊。狡兔身难保，乖獐智亦穷。狐狸该命尽，麋鹿丧当终。山雉难飞脱，野鸡怎避凶？他都要捡占山场擒猛兽，摧残林木射飞虫。那些人出得城来，散步东郊，不多时，有二十里向高田地，又只见中军营里，有小小的一个将军，顶着盔，贯着甲，果肚花，十八札，手执青锋宝剑，坐下黄骠马，腰带满弦弓，真个是隐隐君王象，昂昂帝主容。规模非小辈，行动显真龙。行者在空暗喜道：“不须说，那个就是皇帝的太子了。等我戏他一戏。”好大圣，按落云头，撞入军中太子马前，摇身一变，变作一个白兔儿，只在太子马前乱跑。太子看见，正合欢心，拈起箭，拽满弓，一箭正中了那兔儿。原来是那大圣故意教他中了，却眼乖手疾，一把接住那箭头，把箭翎花落在前边，丢开脚步跑了。那太子见箭中了玉兔，兜开马，独自争先来赶。不知马行的快，行者如风；</p>

<p>马行的迟，行者慢走，只在他面前不远。看他一程一程，将太子哄到宝林寺山门之下，行者现了本身，不见兔儿，只见一枝箭插在门槛上。径撞进去，见唐僧道：“师父，来了！来了！”却又一变，变做二寸长短的小和尚儿，钻在红匣之内。</p>

<p>却说那太子赶到山门前，不见了白兔，只见门槛上插住一枝雕翎箭。太子大惊失色道：“怪哉！怪哉！分明我箭中了玉兔，玉兔怎么不见，只见箭在此间！想是年多日久，成了精魅也。”拔了箭，抬头看处，山门上有五个大字，写着敕建宝林寺。</p>

<p>太子道：“我知之矣。向年间曾记得我父王在金銮殿上差官赍些金帛与这和尚修理佛殿佛象，不期今日到此。正是因过道院逢僧话，又得浮生半日闲，我且进去走走。”</p>

<p>那太子跳下马来，正要进去，只见那保驾的官将与三千人马赶上，簇簇拥拥，都入山门里面。慌得那本寺众僧，都来叩头拜接，接入正殿中间，参拜佛象。却才举目观瞻，又欲游廊玩景，忽见正当中坐着一个和尚，太子大怒道：“这个和尚无礼！</p>

<p>我今半朝銮驾进山，虽无旨意知会，不当远接，此时军马临门，也该起身，怎么还坐着不动？”教：“拿下来！”说声拿字，两边校尉，一齐下手，把唐僧抓将下来，急理绳索便捆。行者在匣里默默的念咒，教道：“护法诸天、六丁六甲，我今设法降妖，这太子不能知识，将绳要捆我师父，汝等即早护持，若真捆了，汝等都该有罪！”那大圣暗中吩咐，谁敢不遵，却将三藏护持定了：有些人摸也摸不着他光头，好似一壁墙挡住，难拢其身。那太子道：“你是那方来的，使这般隐身法欺我！”三藏上前施礼道：“贫僧无隐身法，乃是东土唐僧，上雷音寺拜佛求经进宝的和尚。”太子道：“你那东土虽是中原，其穷无比，有甚宝贝，你说来我听。”三藏道：“我身上穿的这袈裟，是第三样宝贝。还有第一等、第二等更好的物哩！”太子道：“你那衣服，半边苫身，半边露臂，能值多少物，敢称宝贝！”三藏道：“这袈裟虽不全体，有诗几句，诗曰：佛衣偏袒不须论，内隐真如脱世尘。万线千针成正果，九珠八宝合元神。仙娥圣女恭修制，遗赐禅僧静垢身。</p>

<p>见驾不迎犹自可，你的父冤未报枉为人！”太子闻言，心中大怒道：“这泼和尚胡说！你那半片衣，凭着你口能舌便，夸好夸强。</p>

<p>我的父冤从何未报，你说来我听。”三藏进前一步，合掌问道：“殿下，为人生在天地之间，能有几恩？”太子道：“有四恩。”三藏道：“那四恩？”太子道：“感天地盖载之恩，日月照临之恩，国王水土之恩，父母养育之恩。”三藏笑曰：“殿下言之有失，人只有天地盖载，日月照临，国王水土，那得个父母养育来？”太子怒道：“和尚是那游手游食削发逆君之徒！人不得父母养育，身从何来？”三藏道：“殿下，贫僧不知。但只这红匣内有一件宝贝，叫做立帝货，他上知五百年，中知五百年，下知五百年，共知一千五百年过去未来之事，便知无父母养育之恩，令贫僧在此久等多时矣。”</p>

<p>太子闻说，教：“拿来我看。”三藏扯开匣盖儿，那行者跳将出来，呀呀的，两边乱走。太子道：“这星星小人儿，能知甚事？”行者闻言嫌小，却就使个神通，把腰伸一伸，就长了有三尺四五寸。众军士吃惊道：“若是这般快长，不消几日，就撑破天也。”行者长到原身，就不长了。太子才问道：“立帝货，这老和尚说你能知未来过去吉凶，你却有龟作卜？有蓍作筮？凭书句断人祸福？”行者道：“我一毫不用，只是全凭三寸舌，万事尽皆知。”太子道：“这厮又是胡说。自古以来，《周易》之书，极其玄妙，断尽天下吉凶，使人知所趋避，故龟所以卜，蓍所以筮。</p>

<p>听汝之言，凭据何理，妄言祸福，扇惑人心！”行者道：“殿下且莫忙，等我说与你听。你本是乌鸡国王的太子，你那里五年前，年程荒旱，万民遭苦，你家皇帝共臣子，秉心祈祷。正无点雨之时，锺南山来了一个道士，他善呼风唤雨，点石为金。君王忒也爱小，就与他拜为兄弟。这桩事有么？”太子道：“有有有！你再说说。”行者道：“后三年不见全真，称孤的却是谁？”太子道：“果是有个全真，父王与他拜为兄弟，食则同食，寝则同寝。三年前在御花园里玩景，被他一阵神风，把父王手中金厢白玉圭，摄回锺南山去了，至今父王还思慕他。因不见他，遂无心赏玩，把花园紧闭了，已三年矣。做皇帝的非我父王而何？”行者闻言，哂笑不绝。太子再问不答，只是哂笑。太子怒道：“这厮当言不言，如何这等哂笑？”行者又道：“还有许多话哩！奈何左右人众，不是说处。”太子见他言语有因，将袍袖一展，教军士且退。那驾上官将，急传令，将三千人马，都出门外住札。此时殿上无人，太子坐在上面，长老立在前边，左手旁立着行者。本寺诸僧皆退，行者才正色上前道：“殿下，化风去的是你生身之父母，见坐位的，是那祈雨之全真。”太子道：“胡说！胡说！我父自全真去后，风调雨顺，国泰民安。照依你说，就不是我父王了。还是我年孺，容得你；若我父王听见你这番话，拿了去，碎尸万段！”把行者咄的喝下来。行者对唐僧道：“何如？我说他不信，果然！果然！如今却拿那宝贝进与他，倒换关文，往西方去罢。”三藏即将红匣子递与行者。行者接过来，将身一抖，那匣儿卒不见了，原是他毫毛变的，被他收上身去。却将白玉圭双手捧上，献与太子。</p>

<p>太子见了道：“好和尚！好和尚！你五年前本是个全真，来骗了我家的宝贝，如今又妆做和尚来进献！”叫：“拿了！”一声传令，把长老唬得慌忙指着行者道：“你这弼马温！专撞空头祸，带累我哩！”行者近前一齐拦住道：“休嚷！莫走了风！我不叫做立帝货，还有真名哩。”太子怒道：“你上来！我问你个真名字，好送法司定罪！”行者道：“我是那长老的大徒弟，名唤悟空孙行者，因与我师父上西天取经，昨宵到此觅宿。我师父夜读经卷，至三更时分得一梦，梦见你父王道，他被那全真欺害，推在御花园八角琉璃井内，全真变作他的模样。满朝官不能知，你年幼亦无分晓，禁你入宫，关了花园，大端怕漏了消息。你父王今夜特来请我降魔，我恐不是妖邪，自空中看了，果然是个妖精。正要动手拿他，不期你出城打猎。你箭中的玉兔，就是老孙。老孙把你引到寺里，见师父，诉此衷肠，句句是实。你既然认得白玉圭，怎么不念鞠养恩情，替亲报仇？”那太子闻言，心中惨慽，暗自伤愁道：“若不信此言语，他却有三分儿真实；</p>

<p>若信了，怎奈殿上见是我父王？”这才是进退两难心问口，三思忍耐口问心。行者见他疑惑不定，又上前道：“殿下不必心疑，请殿下驾回本国，问你国母娘娘一声，看他夫妻恩爱之情，比三年前如何。只此一问，便知真假矣。”那太子回心道：“正是！</p>

<p>且待我问我母亲去来。”他跳起身，笼了玉圭就走。行者扯住道：“你这些人马都回，却不走漏消息，我难成功？但要你单人独马进城，不可扬名卖弄，莫入正阳门，须从后宰门进去。到宫中见你母亲，切休高声大气，须是悄语低言。恐那怪神通广大，一时走了消息，你娘儿们性命俱难保也。”太子谨遵教命，出山门吩咐将官：“稳在此札营，不得移动。我有一事，待我去了就来一同进城。”看他：指挥号令屯军士，上马如飞即转城。这一去，不知见了娘娘，有何话说，且听下回分解。</p>
