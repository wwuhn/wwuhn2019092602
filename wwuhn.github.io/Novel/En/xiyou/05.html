<P style="font-size:90%;">After Chaos Among the Peaches the Great Sage Steals the Pills</P>
<P>In the Revolt Against Heaven the Gods Capture the Demons</P>
</div>
<P>The story goes on to relate that the Great Sage Equaling Heaven, a mere monkey devil after all, was quite satisfied that his name was on the register of office without caring about the grading of his job and his own rank, or the size of his salary. The immortal clerks in the two offices in his residence were in constant attendance on him, he had three meals a day and a bed to sleep on at night, and he lived a free and easy life without worries. In his spare time he would visit the other palaces, get together with his old friends, and make new ones. When he saw the Three Pure Ones, he would address them as &#8220;venerable,&#8221; and when he met the Four Emperors he called them &#8220;Your Majesty.&#8221; He was on fraternal terms with the Nine Bright Shiners, the Generals of the Five Regions, the Twenty-Eight Constellations, the Four Great Heavenly Kings, the Gods of the Twelve Branches, the Five Ancients of the Five Regions, the star ministers of the whole sky, and the countless gods of the Milky Way. Today he would wander East, and tomorrow he would go West, coming and going by cloud, and never staying anywhere for long.</P>
<P>When the Jade Emperor was holding his morning court one day the Immortal Xu of Jingyang came forward from the body of officials, kowtowed, and suggested, &#8220;The Great Sage Equaling Heaven is spending his time in idle travel, and is making the acquaintance of all the stars in the sky, calling them all his friends irrespective of their rank. It would be as well to give him some responsibility, and prevent his idleness leading to trouble later on.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Jade Emperor's response to this suggestion was to send for the Monkey King at once. He came in a cheerful mood and asked, &#8220;What promotion and reward have you summoned me here to receive, Your Majesty?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Seeing that you are idle and have nothing to do,&#8221; replied the Jade Emperor, &#8220;we are giving you a job. You are to administer the Peach Orchard, and you will give it your attention day and night.&#8221; The Great Sage was overjoyed, and after expressing his thanks and chanting &#8220;na-a-aw&#8221; he withdrew.</P>
<P>In his eagerness to be at work he went straight to the Peach Orchard to have a look round. When he got there he was stopped by a local tutelary god who asked him, &#8220;Where are you going, Great Sage?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've been put in charge of the Peach Orchard by the Jade Emperor, and I've come to inspect it.&#8221; The local god hastened to greet him formally, and he called the men who weeded, brought water, looked after the trees, and swept the grounds to come and kowtow to the Great Sage. When Sun Wukong was taken inside this is what he saw:</P>


<P>Charming,</P>
<P>Every tree.</P>
<P>Charming and luxuriant the full blossom;</P>
<P>Every tree weighed down with fruit.</P>
<P>The fruit-laden branches bend like carding-bows;</P>
<P>The blossoming trees are covered with powder and rouge.</P>
<P>Always blossoming, always in fruit, they are ripe for a thousand years;</P>
<P>They know no summer or winter, but linger for ever.</P>
<P>The early ripeners</P>
<P>Look red-faced and tipsy;</P>
<P>The ones still growing</P>
<P>Are green in stalk and skin.</P>
<P>When the dew forms, their flesh has a touch of blue,</P>
<P>While the sun picks out their vermilion beauty.</P>
<P>Below the trees exotic flowers grow,</P>
<P>Bright and unfading throughout the year.</P>
<P>On either side stand towers and pavilions,</P>
<P>And a rainbow always arches the sky.</P>
<P>These are not the common breeds of the Dark Earth Capital,</P>
<P>But are tended by the Queen Mother of the Jade Pool.</P>


<P>After taking a good look at this the Great Sage asked the local god, &#8220;How many of these trees are there?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Three thousand six hundred all together,&#8221; the local god replied. &#8220;The ones growing at the front have tiny blossoms and small fruits, and they ripen every three thousand years. Anyone who eats them becomes an Immortal and understands the Way, and his body becomes both light and strong. The twelve hundred in the middle have multiple blossoms and sweet fruits, and ripen every six thousand years; whoever eats them can fly and enjoy eternal youth. The back twelve hundred are streaked with purple and have pale yellow stones. They ripen once every nine thousand years, and anyone who eats them becomes as eternal as Heaven and Earth, as long-lived as the Sun and Moon.&#8221; The Great Sage was beside himself with joy on learning this, and that day he checked the number of the trees and looked over the buildings in the orchard before going back to his residence. From then on he went to admire them every three or four days. He dropped his friends, and made no more pleasure jaunts.</P>
<P>One day he noticed that the peaches near the end of the branches of one old tree were all but ripe, and he felt like trying one; but as the local god, the workmen, and the immortal clerks from his residence were close on his heels it was impossible. Suddenly he had an idea, and he said, &#8220;Go and wait for me outside the gates while I take a nap in this summer-house.&#8221;</P>
<P>All the Immortals thereupon withdrew, and the Monkey King took off his official hat and clothes, climbed one of the bigger trees, and chose some large, ripe peaches. When he had picked a good number he sat at his ease in the branches and ate his fill of them, then jumped down from the tree, pinned on his hat, put on his clothes, and shouted for all his attendants to go back to his residence with him. Two or three days later he thought of another trick to steal some more peaches, and he ate his fill of them.</P>
<P>One day the Queen Mother arranged a banquet, opening many precious pavilions for a feast of peaches by the Jade Pool. She sent the Red Fairy, the Blue Fairy, the White Fairy, the Black Fairy, the Purple Fairy, the Yellow Fairy, and the Green Fairy to the Peach Orchard with their baskets to pick peaches for the feast. The seven fairies went straight to the orchard gates, the workmen of the orchard and the immortal superintendents of the two offices of the Equaling Heaven Residence were guarding the gate.</P>
<P>The fairies went up to them and said, &#8220;We have come on the orders of the Queen Mother to pick peaches for a feast.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wait a moment please, Immortal Beauties,&#8221; said the local god. &#8220;Things are different this year. The Jade Emperor has appointed the Great Sage Equaling Heaven to be the guardian of this orchard, and we must ask him before we can open the orchard to you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where is the Great Sage?&#8221; the fairies asked, and the local god replied, &#8220;Inside the orchard. As he was feeling tired he is having a nap by himself in a summerhouse.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case, please find him without delay,&#8221; requested the fairies, and the local god took them into the orchard. But all they could find of him in the summerhouse were his hat and clothes. They had no idea where he could have gone, and looked everywhere without success. The Great Sage had in fact made himself only two inches long after eating some of the peaches for fun, and he was sleeping under a large leaf at the top of one of the big trees.</P>
<P>&#8220;We have come by decree, and we can't go back empty-handed, although the Great Sage is nowhere to be found,&#8221; said the fairies.</P>
<P>One of the immortal superintendents who was standing nearby replied, &#8220;As you Immortal Beauties have come by order of the Queen Mother, we must not delay you. Our Great Sage is always wandering off, so I expect that he has gone away to visit some of his friends. You had better pick the peaches; it will be all right if we inform him.&#8221;</P>
<P>The fairies did as he suggested and went into the orchard to pick peaches. First they filled two baskets from the trees in front, and then they picked three basketfuls from the trees in the middle; but when they came to the trees at the back, they saw that peaches and blossoms were few and far between. Only a few unripe fruits with furry stalks and green skins were left. All the ripe ones had been eaten up by the Monkey King. The seven fairies looked everywhere, but all they could see was a single red and white peach on a Southern branch. The Blue Fairy pulled the branch down, the Red Fairy picked the peach, and then they let the branch go again. This woke up the Great Sage, who had changed himself into this peach to take a nap on this branch.</P>
<P>He resumed his own form, took his gold-banded cudgel from his ear, shook it till it was as thick as a ricebowl, and shouted at them, &#8220;Where are you from, you thieving fiends?&#8221; The seven fairies fell on their knees in confusion.</P>
<P>&#8220;Please don't be angry with us, Great Sage. We're not fiends but seven fairies sent by Her Majesty the Queen Mother of the West to pick peaches of immortality and open the precious halls here for a Feast of Peaches. When we arrived here we saw the local god and other deities of the place, but we could not find you, Great Sage. We could not delay carrying out the Queen Mother's orders, so we went ahead and picked the peaches without waiting for you, Great Sage. We very much hope that you will forgive us.&#8221;</P>
<P>These words turned the Great Sage's bad mood into a good one, and he said, &#8220;Please rise, Fairy Beauties. Who is the Queen Mother inviting to this feast?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There are old rules about who attends: The Buddha of the Western Heaven, Bodhisattvas, holy monks, Arhats, the Guanyin of the South Pole, the Merciful and Sage Emperor of the East, the Venerable Immortals of the Ten Continents and the Three Islands, the Mystic Divinity of the North Pole, and the Great Yellow-horned Immortal of the Yellow Pole at the Centre. These make up the Five Venerable Ones of the Five Regions. There will also be the Star Lords of the Five Constellation; the Three Pure Ones, the Four Emperors and the Heavenly Immortal of the Great Monad from the Eight High Caves; the Jade Emperor, the immortals of the Nine Mounds, and the gods of the Seas and Mountains and the Ruler of the Nether World from the Eight Lower Caves; and the terrestrial deities. All the major and minor gods of all the halls and palaces will come to the Feast of Peaches.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Will I be invited?&#8221; asked the Great Sage with an ingratiating smile.</P>
<P>&#8220;Not as far as we've heard,&#8221; the fairies replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm the Great Sage Equaling Heaven, so why shouldn't I be asked?&#8221; said the Great Sage.</P>
<P>&#8220;That was what happened before: we don't know about this time,&#8221; the fairies replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Just wait here while I go and find out whether I'm invited.&#8221;</P>
<P>Splendid Great Sage. Making a magic with his hands as he spoke the words of the spell, he said to the fairies, &#8220;Stay where you are! Stay where you are!&#8221; As this was an immobilizing spell, the seven fairies were left standing in a daze under the peach tree with their eyes wide open as the Great Sage leapt out of the orchard on a somersault cloud and headed for the Jade Pool. As he traveled he saw that</P>


<P>The sky shimmered with auspicious light</P>
<P>As clouds of many colours streamed across it.</P>
<P>The white stork's cry made the heavens shake;</P>
<P>A thousand leaves grew on the purple asphodel.</P>
<P>Amid it all an Immortal appeared,</P>
<P>Carrying himself with heaven-sent elegance,</P>
<P>As he danced on the rainbow, cloaked by the Milky Way,</P>
<P>With a talisman at his waist to ward off birth and death.</P>
<P>His name was Bare-Foot Immortal,</P>
<P>And he was going to the feast of longevity-giving peaches.</P>


<P>As the Bare-foot Immortal saw him, the Great Sage lowered his head and thought of a plan by which to trick the Immortal and get to the banquet himself.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you going, reverend sir?&#8221; he asked; and the Immortal replied, &#8220;I'm going to the Peach Banquet by the invitation of the Queen Mother.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There is something you do not know, venerable sir,&#8221; said the Great Sage. &#8220;As my somersault cloud is so fast, the Jade Emperor has sent me everywhere to tell all you gentlemen to go to the Hall of Universal Brightness for a ceremony before going on to the banquet.&#8221;</P>
<P>As the Immortal was an open and upright man, he took this lie for the truth, but wondered, &#8220;The thanksgiving ceremony is usually held by the Jade Pool, so why are we having the ceremony in the Hall of Universal Brightness before going to the Jade Pool for the banquet?&#8221; Nevertheless, he turned his propitious cloud around and went to the Hall of Universal Brightness.</P>
<P>As the Great Sage rode his cloud he said a spell, shook himself, took the form of the Bare-foot Immortal, and hurried to the Jade Pool. He reached the pavilion there a moment later, stopped his cloud, and went quietly inside. He saw</P>


<P>Fabulous perfumes coiling,</P>
<P>A confusion of auspicious clouds;</P>
<P>The jade tower set with color,</P>
<P>The precious pavilions scattering mists;</P>
<P>The phoenix soars till almost lost to view,</P>
<P>And jeweled flowers seem to rise and fall.</P>
<P>Above a nine-phoenix screen</P>
<P>A rainbow stool of the eight precious things,</P>
<P>A coloured golden table,</P>
<P>Green jade bowls with a thousand flowers.</P>
<P>On the table were dragon livers and marrow of phoenix bone,</P>
<P>Bears' paws and apes' lips&#8212;</P>
<P>A hundred different dishes, and all of them good;</P>
<P>Rare fruits and fine delicacies, every one unique.</P>


<P>Everything was neatly set out, but no Immortals had yet arrived. The Great Sage had not finished looking when he smelt wine; and as he whirled round he saw under a portico to the right several immortal officials in charge of brewing liquor with some workmen who stirred the lees, a number of novices who carried water and some boys who looked after the fires. They were washing the vats and scrubbing the pots, having made jade liquor and a fragrant fermentation of the lees. The Great Sage could not stop himself from drooling, and he longed to drink some, but unfortunately all those people were there. So he performed a spell by pulling several hairs from his body, chewing them up, spitting them up, saying the magic words, and shouting &#8220;Change&#8221;; whereupon the hairs turned into sleep insects, which flew into the faces of all the liquor-makers. Watch them as their hands go limp, their heads droop, their eyes close, and they drop their symbols of office and all fall asleep. Whereupon the Great Sage grabbed the rare delicacies and exotic foods, then went under the portico and drank from the vats and pots until he was completely drunk.</P>
<P>Only then did he think, &#8220;This won't do at all. When the guests come for the banquet they'll be furious with me, and I'll be for it if I'm caught. I'd better get back to the Residence as soon as I can and sleep it off.&#8221;</P>
<P>Our dear Great Sage staggered and swayed, charging about all over the place under the influence of the liquor, and going the wrong way. He arrived not at the Equaling Heaven Residence but at the Tushita Heavenly Palace. As soon as he saw this he sobered up and said to himself, &#8220;The Tushita Palace is the highest of the thirty-three heavens, where Lord Lao Zi of the Great Monad reigns. However did I get here? Never mind, I've always wanted to see that old chap, and I've never managed to come here before. I might as well go and have a look at him now that I'm passing this way.&#8221;</P>
<P>He straightened his clothes and rushed in, but did not see Lord Lao Zi. There was no sign of anyone. This was because Lao Zi and the Ancient Buddha Dipamkara were expounding the Way from a red dais in a triple-storied pavilion, and all the immortal boys, generals, officials and petty functionaries were standing to right and left listening to the lecture. The Great Sage went straight to the room in which the elixir was kept, and although he could not find Lao Zi there he saw that there was a small fire in the stove beside the range over which pills were made. On either side of the stove were five gourds, full of golden pills of refined elixir.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is the Immortals' greatest treasure,&#8221; he exclaimed in delight. &#8220;I've wanted to refine some of these golden pills to save people with ever since I understood the Way and mastered the principle of the correspondence of the Esoteric and Exoteric, but I've never had time to come here. Today I'm in luck&#8212;I've found them. As Lao Zi isn't here I'll try a few.&#8221; He emptied the gourds of their contents and ate up all the pills as if he were eating fried beans.</P>
<P>Before long he was full of pills and quite sober. &#8220;This is terrible,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;this is a colossal disaster. If the Jade Emperor is shocked by this, I'm done for. I must get out of here. I'd be much better off as a king in the lower world.&#8221;</P>
<P>He rushed out of the Tushita Palace, avoiding his usual route. Using a spell to make himself invisible, he left by the West Gate of Heaven, and went straight down to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit by cloud. When he got there he saw flags, banners, spears and halberds gleaming in the sun: the four Stalwart Generals and the seventy-two kings of the monsters were holding military exercises.</P>
<P>&#8220;Children, I'm back,&#8221; shouted the Great Sage in a loud voice, and all the fiends dropped their weapons and fell to their knees.</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't care, do you, Great Sage?&#8221; they said. &#8220;It's been so long since you left us, and you never came back to see us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I haven't been long, I haven't been long,&#8221; protested the Great Sage, and as they talked they walked into the innermost part of the cave. When the four Stalwart General's had tidied the place up and made him sit down, they kowtowed to him and asked, &#8220;What office did you hold, Great Sage, during your century and more in Heaven?&#8221;</P>
<P>The Great Sage laughed and said, &#8220;As far as I can remember it was only six months, so why do you say it was over a century?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;A day in Heaven is the same as a year on earth,&#8221; the Stalwart Generals replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;I was lucky this time,&#8221; said the Great Sage. &#8220;The Jade Emperor took a liking to me and ennobled me as the Great Sage Equaling Heaven. He had an Equaling Heaven Residence built for me, complete with a Tranquillity Office and a Calm Divinity Office with Immortal functionaries, attendants and guards. Later on, when he saw that I had nothing to do, he put me in charge of the Peach Orchard. Recently the Queen Mother Goddess gave a Peach Banquet, but she didn't invite me. Instead of waiting for an invitation, I went to the Jade Pool and stole all the immortal food and drink. I staggered away from the Jade Pool and blundered into Lord Lao Zi's palace, and there I ate up his five gourds of pills of immortality. Then I got out through the heavenly gates and came here because I was scared that the Jade Emperor was going to punish me.&#8221;</P>
<P>All the fiends were delighted with what they heard, and they laid on liquor and fruit with which to welcome him back.</P>
<P>They filled a stone bowl with coconut toddy and handed it to him, but when he tasted it the Great Sage grimaced and said, &#8220;It's awful, it's awful.&#8221;</P>
<P>Two of his Stalwart Generals, Beng and Ba, explained, &#8220;You don't find coconut toddy very tasty because you have drunk immortal liquor and eaten immortal food in the heavenly palace, Great Sage. But as the saying goes, 'Sweet or not, it's water from home.'&#8221;</P>
<P>To this the Great Sage replied, &#8220;And all of you, whether related to me or not, are from my home. When I was enjoying myself beside the Jade Pool today I saw jars and jars of jade liquor under a portico there. As none of you have ever tasted it I'll go and pinch you a few jars; then you can each have a little drink, and live for ever.&#8221; All the monkeys were beside themselves with glee. The Great Sage then went out of the cave, turned a somersault, made himself invisible, and went straight to the Peach Banquet. As he went through the gates of the Jade Pool he saw that the men who made the wine, stirred the lees, carried the water, and looked after the fire were still snoring away. He tucked two big jars of wine under his arms, took two more in his hands, then turned his cloud round and went back to have a feast of immortal wine with the monkey masses in the cave. They all drank several cups and were very happy, but we will not go into this.</P>
<P>The story returns to the seven fairies, who were only able to free themselves a whole day after Sun Wukong had immobilized them with his magic. They picked up their baskets and went back to report to the Queen Mother that they were late because the Great Sage Equaling Heaven had held them there by magic.</P>
<P>&#8220;How many peaches did you pick?&#8221; the Queen Mother asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Two baskets of little ones and three baskets of medium ones. But when we got to the back we could not find a single big one; we think that they were all eaten by the Great Sage. While we were looking for some the Great Sage suddenly appeared, and he beat and tortured us to make us tell him who had been invited to the banquet. After we had told him he immobilized us there, and we don't know where he went. We only came round and freed ourselves a moment ago.&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing this the Queen Mother went to see the Jade Emperor and gave him a full account of what had happened. Before she had finished, the liquor-makers arrived with their immortal officials to report that an unknown person had thrown the Grand Peach Banquet into confusion and stolen the jade liquor as well as the precious delicacies of a hundred flavors. Then came Four Heavenly Teachers to announce that the Supreme Patriarch of the Way, Lao Zi, had arrived.</P>
<P>The Jade Emperor went out with the Queen Mother to meet him, and after doing obeisance Lao Zi said, &#8220;I had refined some Golden Pills of the Nine Transformations in my palace for a Feast of Elixir Pills with Your Majesty, but a thief has stolen them. This is what I have come to report to Your Majesty.&#8221; This news made the Jade Emperor tremble with fear.</P>
<P>Not long afterwards the immortal administrators from the Equaling Heaven Residence came to kowtow and report: &#8220;The Great Sage Sun Wukong abandoned his post and went wandering off yesterday. He has not come back yet and we do not know where he has gone.&#8221; The Jade Emperor, now more suspicious than ever, then saw the Bare-Foot Immortal bow his head to the ground.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your subject was going to the banquet on a summons from the Queen Mother,&#8221; he reported, &#8220;when I happened to meet the Great Sage Equaling Heaven. He told me, O Lord of Ten Thousand Years, that you had issued a decree ordering him to tell all the rest of us to go to the Hall of Universal Brightness for a ceremony before going to the banquet. Your subject went back to the Hall of Universal Brightness as he had told me to, but as I did not see the Imperial Dragon and Phoenix Chariot outside I hurried here to await orders.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This wretch has the impudence to invent fraudulent decrees and deceive eminent ministers,&#8221; exclaimed the Jade Emperor with anger and astonishment. &#8220;The Miraculous Investigator is to find out at once what he has been up to.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Miraculous Investigator left the palace in obedience to the edict, and by making thorough enquiries he found out all the details of what had happened.</P>
<P>&#8220;The wrecker of the Heavenly Palace was Sun Wukong,&#8221; he reported, and he went on to give a full account. The Jade Emperor was furiously angry, and he ordered the Four Great Heavenly Kings along with Heavenly King Li and Prince Nezha to mobilize the Twenty-eight Constellations, the Nine Bright Shiners, the Twelve Gods of the Twelve Branches, the Revealers of the Truth of the Five Regions, the Four Duty Gods, the Constellations of the East and West, the Gods of the North and South, the Deities of the Five Mountains and the Four Rivers, the star ministers of all Heaven, and a total of a hundred thousand heavenly soldiers. They were to descend to the lower world with eighteen heaven-and-earth nets, surround the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit, and capture that wretch for punishment. The gods called out their troops at once, and left the heavenly palace.</P>


<P>A gusty sandstorm blotted out the heavens,</P>
<P>Purple fog threw the earth into darkness.</P>
<P>Just because the monkey fiend offended the Supreme Emperor</P>
<P>Heavenly hosts were sent down to the mortal dust.</P>
<P>The Four Great Heavenly Kings,</P>
<P>The Revealers of the Truth of the Five Regions.</P>
<P>The Four Great Heavenly Kings held the supreme command,</P>
<P>And the Revealers controlled the soldiers' movements.</P>
<P>Li the Pagoda Carrier commanded the central corps,</P>
<P>Nezha the deadly led the van.</P>
<P>The star Rahu ordered the leading rands,</P>
<P>And the star Ketu towered behind.</P>
<P>The Sun revealed his divinity,</P>
<P>And radiance shone from the Moon.</P>
<P>The stars of the Five Elements were mighty in valour,</P>
<P>And the Nine Bright Shiners were fond of battle.</P>
<P>The stars of the Branches Zi, Wu, Mao and You,</P>
<P>Were all great heavenly warriors.</P>
<P>The Five Plagues and the Five Mountains were drawn up on the East and West,</P>
<P>While the Six Ding and Six Jia marched to right and left.</P>
<P>The Dragon Gods of the Four Rivers stood above and below,</P>
<P>And the Twenty-eight Constellations were drawn up in serried ranks:</P>
<P>Horn, Gullet, Base, and Chamber were the officers commanding,</P>
<P>Strider, Harvester, Stomach, and Mane wheeled and soared;</P>
<P>Dipper, Ox, Woman, Barrens, Roof, House, and Wall, Heart, Tail, and</P>
<P>Winnower&#8212;all able stars&#8212;</P>
<P>Well, Ghost, Willow, Spread, Whig and Axletree</P>
<P>Wielded their swords and spears, showed forth their power,</P>
<P>Halted their clouds and descended in mists to the mortal world,</P>
<P>Pitching camp before the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit.</P>


<P>There is a poem that runs:</P>


<P>Many the transformations of the heaven-born Monkey King</P>
<P>Happy in his lair after stealing the pills and wine.</P>
<P>Just because he wrecked the banquet of peaches,</P>
<P>A hundred thousand heavenly troops now spread their nets.</P>


<P>Heavenly King Li gave the order for the heavenly soldiers to pitch camp and throw a watertight cordon round the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. Above and below they spread eighteen heaven-and-earth nets, and the Nine Bright Shiners were sent out to start the battle. They took their soldiers to the outside of the cave, where they saw the monkeys, big and small, leaping and fooling around.</P>
<P>The star officers shouted in harsh voices, &#8220;Little goblins, where's that Great Sage of yours? We are gods, sent from the upper world to subdue your mutinous Great Sage. Tell him to surrender at once&#8212;-and if there's so much as a hint of a 'no' from him, we will exterminate every last one of you.&#8221;</P>
<P>The little monkeys went rushing in to report, &#8220;Great Sage, a disaster, a disaster. There are nine evil gods outside who say they've been sent from the upper world to subdue you.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Great Sage, who was just then sharing the immortal liquor with the seventy-two kings of the monsters and his four Stalwart Generals, paid no attention to the report, saying:</P>


<P>&#8220;Today we have wine so today we celebrate:</P>
<P>To hell with what's happening outside the gate.&#8221;</P>


<P>But before the words were out of his mouth another group of little devils came in. &#8220;Those nine evil gods are using foul and provocative language to challenge us to fight,&#8221; they announced.</P>
<P>&#8220;Never mind them,&#8221; said the Great Sage with a laugh.</P>


<P>&#8220;With verse and wine we're happy today;</P>
<P>Who cares when fame will come our way?&#8221;</P>


<P>But before these words were out of his mouth yet another group of devils came rushing in. &#8220;Sir, those nine evil gods have smashed the gates and are charging in.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The stinking gods!&#8221; exploded the Great Sage, &#8220;What nerve! I never wanted a fight with them, so why should they come here to push us around?&#8221; He thereupon ordered the One-horned Monster King to lead the seventy-two monster kings into battle while he followed them with the four Stalwart Generals. The monster king hastily assembled the devil soldiers and sallied forth to meet the enemy. They were all stopped by a charge by the Nine Bright Shiners, who held the head of the iron bridge so that no one could enter or leave.</P>
<P>During the tumult the Great Sage came on the scene, and shouting &#8220;Make way!&#8221; he raised his iron cudgel, shook it till it was as thick as a bowl and twelve feet long, and struck and parried as he came charging out. The Nine Bright Shiners, who were no match for him, fell back.</P>
<P>&#8220;You reckless Protector of the Horses,&#8221; they shouted when they were back in the safety of their own position. &#8220;You have committed the most terrible crimes. You stole the peaches and the wine, wrecked the Peach Banquet, and pilfered the immortality pills of Lord Lao Zi. On top of all this you brought some of the immortal liquor you stole back here. Don't you realize that you have piled crime upon crime?&#8221; The Great Sage laughed.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's true, it's true,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but what are you going to do about it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In obedience to a golden edict of the Jade Emperor,&#8221; the Nine Bright Shiners replied, &#8220;we have led out troops here to subdue you. Submit at once, or else all these creatures of yours will have to pay with their lives. If you refuse, we shall trample this mountain flat and turn your cave upside-down.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You hairy gods,&#8221; roared the Great Sage in a fury, &#8220;what magic powers have you got to let you talk so big? Clear off, or I'll give you a taste of my cudgel.&#8221; The Nine Bright Shiners did a war-dance together, which did not frighten the Handsome Monkey King in the least. He whirled his gold-banded cudgel, parrying to right and left, and fought the Nine Bright Shiners till their muscles were weak and their strength was gone; then each of them broke ranks and fled, dragging their weapons behind them. They rushed to the command post of the central corps and reported to the Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li that the Monkey King was so ferocious that they had fled from the battlefield, unable to defeat him. Heavenly King Li then sent the Four Heavenly Kings and the Twenty-eight Constellations into battle. The Great Sage, not at all frightened at this, ordered the One-horned Demon King, the seventy-two kings of the monsters, and the four Stalwart Generals to draw up their line of battle outside the gates of the cave. The ensuing melee was really terrifying.</P>


<P>Howling winds,</P>
<P>Dark, sinister clouds.</P>
<P>On one side flags and standards colorfully flying,</P>
<P>On the other side the gleam of spears and halberds.</P>
<P>Round helmets shine,</P>
<P>Layered armour gleams.</P>
<P>The shining round helmets reflect the sun,</P>
<P>Like silver boulders reaching to the sky;</P>
<P>Gleaming layers of armour are built into a wall</P>
<P>Like a mountain of ice weighing down the earth.</P>
<P>Long-handled swords</P>
<P>Flash through the clouds like lightning;</P>
<P>Paper-white spears</P>
<P>Pierce mists and fogs;</P>
<P>Heaven-shaped halberds,</P>
<P>Tiger-eye chains,</P>
<P>Bristling like a field of hemp;</P>
<P>Bronze swords,</P>
<P>And four-brightness spears</P>
<P>Drawn up like a dense forest.</P>
<P>Bows and crossbows, eagle-feathered arrows,</P>
<P>Short clubs and snaky spears to terrify the soul.</P>
<P>Wielding his single As-You-Will cudgel,</P>
<P>The Great Sage fights against the heavenly gods.</P>
<P>Such is the slaughter that no bird flies over it;</P>
<P>And tigers and wolves flee in terror.</P>
<P>The swirling stones and clouds of sand make everything dark,</P>
<P>The dirt and the dust blot out the heavens.</P>
<P>The clash of arms startles the universe</P>
<P>As the battle strikes awe into gods and demons.</P>


<P>The battle started in the morning and went on till the sun set behind the mountains in the West. By then the One-horned Demon King and the seventy-two kings of the monsters had all been captured by the heavenly hosts. Only the four Stalwart Generals and the monkeys had got away, and they were now hiding in the innermost recesses of the Water Curtain Cave. The Great Sage's solitary cudgel had fought off the Four Heavenly Kings, Li the Pagoda-bearer and Prince Nezha, who were all in the sky. After the battle had gone on for a long time the Great Sage saw that night was drawing on, so he plucked out one of his hairs, munched it up, spat out the pieces and shouted, &#8220;Change!&#8221; They changed into thousands of Great Sages, all with gold-banded cudgels, who forced Prince Nezha and the five Heavenly Kings to withdraw.</P>
<P>After winning this victory the Great Sage put back his hair and hurried back to the cave, where the four Stalwart Generals at once led the monkeys out to kowtow at the head of the iron bridge to welcome him back. They sobbed three times and then laughed three times.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why are you laughing and crying at the sight of me?&#8221; the Great Sage asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;When we led all the commanders into battle against the heavenly kings this morning,&#8221; replied the Stalwart Generals, &#8220;the seventy-two kings of the monsters and the One-horned Demon King were all captured by the gods, and we had to flee for our lives. That is why we cried. We laughed because you, Great Sage, have come back victorious and unharmed.&#8221;</P>
<P>To this the Great Sage replied, &#8220;Victory and defeat are all the soldier's lot. As the ancients said, 'To kill ten thousand of the enemy you must lose three thousand of your own.' Anyhow, the officers of ours who were captured were all tigers, leopards, wolves, badgers, river-deer, foxes, and raccoon-dogs. Not one of our own kind was even wounded, so there's no need for us to be bothered about it. But although I forced the enemy to withdraw by dividing up my body through magic, they're still encamped at the foot of our mountain, so we'll have to remain on our guard. Meanwhile we must eat a good meal and get a good night's sleep to build up our energy. Tomorrow morning I'll use powerful magic to capture those heavenly generals and avenge our people.&#8221; After the four Stalwart Generals and the other monkey commanders had drunk several cups of coconut toddy, they went to bed with their worries calmed.</P>
<P>When the four Heavenly Kings had withdrawn their troops and ended the battle, those who had distinguished themselves reported what they had done. Some had captured tigers and leopards, some lions and elephants, and others wolves and raccoon-dogs, but not one single monkey goblin had been taken. Then they built a mighty stockade around their camp. Commanders who had distinguished themselves wee rewarded, and the soldiers who made up the heaven-and-earth nets were ordered to surround the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit, holding bells and shouting, ready for a great battle the next day. Every man heard the orders, and they were strictly obeyed. Indeed:</P>


<P>A wicked monkey made chaos, shocking heaven and earth,</P>
<P>So they spread their nets and watched by night and day.</P>

<P>乱蟠桃大圣偷丹</P>
<P>反天宫诸神捉怪</P>
</div>
<p>话表齐天大圣到底是个妖猴，更不知官衔品从，也不较俸禄高低，但只注名便了。那齐天府下二司仙吏，早晚伏侍，只知日食三餐，夜眠一榻，无事牵萦，自由自在。闲时节会友游宫，交朋结义。见三清称个“老”字，逢四帝道个“陛下”。与那九曜星、五方将、二十八宿、四大天王、十二元辰、五方五老、普天星相、河汉群神，俱只以弟兄相待，彼此称呼。今日东游，明日西荡，云去云来，行踪不定。</p>

<p>一日，玉帝早朝，班部中闪出许旌阳真人俯囟启奏道：“今有齐天大圣日日无事闲游，结交天上众星宿，不论高低，俱称朋友。恐后闲中生事。不若与他一件事管，庶免别生事端。”玉帝闻言，即时宣诏。那猴王欣欣然而至，道：“陛下，诏老孙有何升赏？”玉帝道：“朕见你身闲无事，与你件执事。你且权管那蟠桃园，早晚好生在意。”大圣欢喜谢恩，朝上唱喏而退。</p>

<p>他等不得穷忙，即入蟠桃园内查勘。本园中有个土地，拦住问道：“大圣何往？”大圣道：“吾奉玉帝点差，代管蟠桃园，今来查勘也。”那土地连忙施礼，即呼那一班锄树力士、运水力士、修桃力士、打扫力士都来见大圣磕头，引他进去。但见那——</p>

<p>夭夭灼灼，颗颗株株。夭夭灼灼花盈树，颗颗株株果压枝。果压枝头垂锦弹，花盈树上簇胭脂。时开时结千年熟，无夏无冬万载迟。先熟的酡颜醉脸，还生的带蒂青皮。凝烟肌带绿，映日显丹姿。树下奇葩并异卉，四时不谢色齐齐。左右楼台并馆舍，盈空常见罩云霓。不是玄都凡俗种，瑶池王母自栽培。</p>

<p>大圣看玩多时，问土地道：“此树有多少株数？”土地道：“有三千六百株。前面一千二百株，花微果小，三千年一熟，人吃了成仙了道，体健身轻。中间一千二百株，层花甘实，六千年一熟，人吃了霞举飞升，长生不老。后面一千二百株，紫纹缃核，九千年一熟，人吃了与天地齐寿，日月同庚。”大圣闻言，欢喜无任，当日查明了株树，点看了亭阁回府。自此后，三五日一次赏玩，也不交友，也不他游。</p>

<p>一日，见那老树枝头，桃熟大半，他心里要吃个尝新。奈何本园土地、力士并齐天府仙吏紧随不便。忽设一计道：“汝等且出门外伺候，让我在这亭上少憩片时。”那众仙果退。只见那猴王脱冠服，爬上大树，拣那熟透的大桃，摘了许多，就在树枝上自在受用，吃了一饱，却才跳下树来，簪冠着服，唤众等仪从回府。迟三二日，又去设法偷桃，尽他享用。</p>

<p>一朝，王母娘娘设宴，大开宝阁，瑶池中做蟠桃胜会，即着那红衣仙女、青衣仙女、素衣仙女、皂衣仙女、紫衣仙女、黄衣仙女、绿衣仙女，各顶花篮，去蟠桃园摘桃建会。七衣仙女直至园门首，只见蟠桃园土地、力士同齐天府二司仙吏，都在那里把门。仙女近前道：“我等奉王母懿旨，到此摘桃设宴。”土地道：“仙娥且住。今岁不比往年了，玉帝点差齐天大圣在此督理，须是报大圣得知，方敢开园。”仙女道：“大圣何在？”土地道：“大圣在园内，因困倦，自家在亭上睡哩。”仙女道：“既如此，寻他去来，不可迟误。”土地即与同进，寻至花亭不见，只有衣冠在亭，不知何往，四下里都没寻处。原来大圣耍了一会，吃了几个桃子，变做二寸长的个人儿，在那大树梢头浓叶之下睡着了。七衣仙女道：“我等奉旨前来，寻不见大圣，怎敢空回？”旁有仙使道：“仙娥既奉旨来，不必迟疑。我大圣闲游惯了，想是出园会友去了。汝等且去摘桃，我们替你回话便是。”那仙女依言，入树林之下摘桃。先在前树摘了二篮，又在中树摘了三篮，到后树上摘取，只见那树上花果稀疏，止有几个毛蒂青皮的。原来熟的都是猴王吃了。七仙女张望东西，只见向南枝上止有一个半红半白的桃子。青衣女用手扯下枝来，红衣女摘了，却将枝子望上一放。原来那大圣变化了，正睡在此枝，被他惊醒。大圣即现本相，耳朵里掣出金箍棒，幌一幌，碗来粗细，咄的一声道：“你是那方怪物，敢大胆偷摘我桃！”慌得那七仙女一齐跪下道：“大圣息怒。我等不是妖怪，乃王母娘娘差来的七衣仙女，摘取仙桃，大开宝阁，做蟠桃胜会。适至此间，先见了本园土地等神，寻大圣不见。我等恐迟了王母懿旨，是以等不得大圣，故先在此摘桃。万望恕罪。”大圣闻言，回嗔作喜道：“仙娥请起。王母开阁设宴，请的是谁？”仙女道：“上会自有旧规，请的是西天佛老、菩萨、圣僧、罗汉，南方南极观音，东方崇恩圣帝、十洲三岛仙翁，北方北极玄灵，中央黄极黄角大仙，这个是五方五老。还有五斗星君，上八洞三清、四帝，太乙天仙等众，中八洞玉皇、九垒，海岳神仙；下八洞幽冥教主、注世地仙。各宫各殿大小尊神，俱一齐赴蟠桃嘉会。”大圣笑道：“可请我么？”仙女道：“不曾听得说。”大圣道：“我乃齐天大圣，就请我老孙做个席尊，有何不可？”仙女道：“此是上会旧规，今会不知如何。”大圣道：“此言也是，难怪汝等。你且立下，待老孙先去打听个消息，看可请老孙不请。”</p>

<p>好大圣，捻着诀，念声咒语，对众仙女道：“住，住，住”这原来是个定身法，把那七衣仙女，一个个曌曌睁睁，白着眼，都站在桃树之下。大圣纵朵祥云，跳出园内，竟奔瑶池路上而去。正行时，只见那壁厢——</p>

<p>一天瑞霭光摇曳，五色祥云飞不绝。白鹤声鸣振九皋，紫芝色秀分千叶。</p>

<p>中间现出一尊仙，相貌昂然丰采别。神舞虹霓幌汉霄，腰悬宝箓无生灭。</p>

<p>名称赤脚大罗仙，特赴蟠桃添寿节。</p>

<p>那赤脚大仙觌面撞见大圣，大圣低头定计，赚哄真仙，他要暗去赴会，却问：“老道何往？”大仙道：“蒙王母见招，去赴蟠桃嘉会。”大圣道：“老道不知。玉帝因老孙筋斗云疾，着老孙五路邀请列位，先至通明殿下演礼，后方去赴宴。”大仙是个光明正大之人，就以他的诳语作真，道：“常年就在瑶池演礼谢恩，如何先去通明殿演礼，方去瑶池赴会？”无奈，只得拨转祥云，径往通明殿去了。</p>

<p>大圣驾着云，念声咒语，摇身一变，就变做赤脚大仙模样，前奔瑶池。不多时，直至宝阁，按住云头，轻轻移步，走入里面，只见那里——</p>

<p>琼香缭绕，瑞霭缤纷。瑶台铺彩结，宝阁散氤氲。凤翥鸾翔形缥缈，金花玉萼影浮沉。上排着九凤丹霞絜，八宝紫霓墩。五彩描金桌，千花碧玉盆。桌上有龙肝和凤髓，熊掌与猩唇。珍馐百味般般美，异果嘉肴色色新。</p>

<p>那里铺设得齐齐整整，却还未有仙来。这大圣点看不尽，忽闻得一阵酒香扑鼻，急转头见右壁厢长廊之下，有几个造酒的仙官，盘糟的力士，领几个运水的道人，烧火的童子，在那里洗缸刷瓮，已造成了玉液琼浆，香醪佳酿。大圣止不住口角流涎，就要去吃，奈何那些人都在这里，他就弄个神通   ，   把毫毛拔下几根，丢入口中嚼碎，喷将出去，念声咒语，叫“变！”即变做几个瞌睡虫，奔在众人脸上。你看那伙人，手软头低，闭眉合眼，丢了执事，都去盹睡。大圣却拿了些百味八珍，佳肴异品，走入长廊里面，就着缸，挨着瓮，放开量，痛饮一番。吃勾了多时，酕菘醉了，自揣自摸道：“不好，不好！再过会，请的客来，却不怪我？一时拿住，怎生是好？不如早回府中睡去也。”</p>

<p>好大圣，摇摇摆摆，仗着酒，任情乱撞，一会把路差了，不是齐天府，却是兜率天宫。一见了，顿然醒悟道：“兜率宫是三十三天之上，乃离恨天太上老君之处，如何错到此间？也罢，也罢！一向要来望此老，不曾得来，今趁此残步，就望他一望也好。”即整衣撞进去。那里不见老君，四无人迹。原来那老君与燃灯古佛在三层高阁朱陵丹台上讲道，众仙童、仙将、仙官、仙吏都侍立左右听讲。这大圣直至丹房里面，寻访不遇，但见丹灶之旁，炉中有火。炉左右安放着五个葫芦，葫芦里都是炼就的金丹。大圣喜道：“此物乃仙家之至宝。老孙自了道以来，识破了内外相同之理，也要炼些金丹济人，不期到家无暇。今日有缘，却又撞着此物，趁老子不在，等我吃他几丸尝新。”他就把那葫芦都倾出来，就都吃了，如吃炒豆相似。</p>

<p>一时间丹满酒醒，又自己揣度道：“不好，不好！这场祸，比天还大，若惊动玉帝，性命难存。走，走，走！不如下界为王去也！”他就跑出兜率宫，不行旧路，从西天门，使个隐身法逃去，即按云头，回至花果山界。但见那旌旗闪灼，戈戟光辉，原来是四健将与七十二洞妖王，在那里演习武艺。大圣高叫道：“小的们！我来也！”众怪丢了器械，跪倒道：“大圣好宽心！丢下我等许久，不来相顾！”大圣道：“没多时，没多时！”且说且行，径入洞天深处。四健将打扫安歇，叩头礼拜毕，俱道：“大圣在天这百十年，实受何职？”大圣笑道：“我记得才半年光景，怎么就说百十年话？”健将道：“在天一日，即在下方一年也。”大圣道：“且喜这番玉帝相爱，果封做齐天大圣，起一座齐天府，又设安静、宁神二司，司设仙吏侍卫。向后见我无事，着我代管蟠桃园。近因王母娘娘设蟠桃大会，未曾请我，是我不待他请，先赴瑶池，把他那仙品仙酒，都是我偷吃了。走出瑶池，踉踉槁槁误入老君宫阙，又把他五个葫芦金丹也偷吃了。但恐玉帝见罪，方才走出天门来也。”</p>

<p>众怪闻言大喜，即安排酒果接风，将椰酒满斟一石碗奉上。大圣喝了一口，即咨牙俫嘴道：“不好吃，不好吃！”崩、芭二将道：“大圣在天宫，吃了仙酒仙肴，是以椰酒不甚美口。常言道，美不美，乡中水。”大圣道：“你们就是亲不亲，故乡人。我今早在瑶池中受用时，见那长廊之下，有许多瓶罐，都是那玉液琼浆，你们都不曾尝着。待我再去偷他几瓶回来，你们各饮半杯，一个个也长生不老。”众猴欢喜不胜。大圣即出洞门，又翻一筋斗，使个隐身法，径至蟠桃会上。进瑶池宫阙，只见那几个造酒、盘糟、运水、烧火的，还鼾睡未醒。他将大的从左右胁下挟了两个，两手提了两个，即拨转云头回来，会众猴在于洞中，就做个仙酒会，各饮了几杯，快乐不题。</p>

<p></p>

<p>却说那七衣仙女自受了大圣的定身法术，一周天方能解脱，各提花篮，回奏王母说道：“齐天大圣使术法困住我等，故此来迟。”王母问道：“汝等摘了多少蟠桃？”仙女道：“只有两篮小桃，三篮中桃。至后面，大桃半个也无，想都是大圣偷吃了。及正寻间，不期大圣走将出来，行凶拷打，又问设宴请谁。我等把上会事说了一遍，他就定住我等，不知去向。直到如今，才得醒解回来。”王母闻言，即去见玉帝，备陈前事。说不了，又见那造酒的一班人，同仙官等来奏：“不知什么人，搅乱了蟠桃大会，偷吃了玉液琼浆，其八珍百味，亦俱偷吃了。”又有四个大天师来奏上：“太上道祖来了。”玉帝即同王母出迎。老君朝礼毕，道：“老道宫中，炼了些九转金丹，伺候陛下做丹元大会，不期被贼偷去，特启陛下知之。”玉帝见奏悚惧。少时，又有齐天府仙吏叩头道：“孙大圣不守执事，自昨日出游，至今未转，更不知去向。”玉帝又添疑思，只见那赤脚大仙又τ囟上奏道：“臣蒙王母诏昨日赴会，偶遇齐天大圣，对臣言万岁有旨，着他邀臣等先赴通明殿演礼，方去赴会。臣依他言语，即返至通明殿外，不见万岁龙车凤辇，又急来此俟候。”玉帝越发大惊道：“这厮假传旨意，赚哄贤卿，快着纠察灵官缉访这厮踪迹！”</p>

<p>灵官领旨，即出殿遍访，尽得其详细，回奏道：“搅乱天宫者，乃齐天大圣也。”又将前事尽诉一番。玉帝大恼，即差四大天王，协同李天王并哪吒太子，点二十八宿、九曜星官、十二元辰、五方揭谛、四值功曹、东西星斗、南北二神、五岳四渎、普天星相，共十万天兵，布一十八架天罗地网，下界去花果山围困，定捉获那厮处治。众神即时兴师，离了天宫。这一去，但见那——</p>

<p>黄风滚滚遮天暗，紫雾腾腾罩地昏。只为妖猴欺上帝，致令众圣降凡尘。四大天王，五方揭谛：四大天王权总制，五方揭谛调多兵。李托塔中军掌号，恶哪吒前部先锋。罗睺星为头检点，计都星随后峥嵘。太阴星精神抖擞，太阳星照耀分明。五行星偏能豪杰，九曜星最喜相争。元辰星子午卯酉，一个个都是大力天丁。五瘟五岳东西摆，六丁六甲左右行。四渎龙神分上下，二十八宿密层层。角亢氐房为总领，奎娄胃昴惯翻腾。斗牛女虚危室壁，心尾箕星个个能。井鬼柳星张翼轸，轮枪舞剑显威灵。停云降雾临凡世，花果山前扎下营。</p>

<p>诗曰：</p>

<p>天产猴王变化多，偷丹偷酒乐山窝。只因搅乱蟠桃会，十万天兵布网罗。</p>

<p>当时李天王传了令，着众天兵扎了营，把那花果山围得水泄不通。上下布了十八架天罗地网，先差九曜恶星出战。九曜即提兵径至洞外，只见那洞外大小群猴跳跃顽耍。星官厉声高叫道：“那小妖！你那大圣在那里？我等乃上界差调的天神，到此降你这造反的大圣。教他快快来归降；若道半个‘不’字，教汝等一概遭诛！”那小妖慌忙传入道：“大圣，祸事了，祸事了！外面有九个凶神，口称上界差来的天神，收降大圣。”</p>

<p>那大圣正与七十二洞妖王，并四健将分饮仙酒，一闻此报，公然不理道：“今朝有酒今朝醉，莫管门前是与非。”说不了，一起小妖又跳来道：“那九个凶神，恶言泼语，在门前骂战哩！”大圣笑道：“莫采他。诗酒且图今日乐，功名休问几时成。”说犹未了，又一起小妖来报：“爷爷！那九个凶神已把门打破，杀进来也！”大圣怒道：“这泼毛神，老大无礼！本待不与他计较，如何上门来欺我？”即命独角鬼王，领帅七十二洞妖王出阵，老孙领四健将随后。那鬼王疾帅妖兵，出门迎敌，却被九曜恶星一齐掩杀，抵住在铁板桥头，莫能得出。</p>

<p>正嚷间，大圣到了。叫一声：“开路！”掣开铁棒，幌一幌，碗来粗细，丈二长短，丢开架子，打将出来。九曜星那个敢抵，一时打退。那九曜星立住阵势道：“你这不知死活的弼马温！你犯了十恶之罪，先偷桃，后偷酒，搅乱了蟠桃大会，又窃了老君仙丹，又将御酒偷来此处享乐，你罪上加罪，岂不知之？”大圣笑道：“这几桩事，实有，实有！但如今你怎么？”九曜星道：“吾奉玉帝金旨，帅众到此收降你，快早皈依，免教这些生灵纳命。不然，就髹平了此山，掀翻了此洞也！”大圣大怒道：“量你这些毛神，有何法力，敢出浪言。不要走，请吃老孙一棒！”这九曜星一齐踊跃。那美猴王不惧分毫，轮起金箍棒，左遮右挡，把那九曜星战得筋疲力软，一个个倒拖器械，败阵而走，急入中军帐下，对托塔天王道：“那猴王果十分骁勇！我等战他不过，败阵来了。”李天王即调四大天王与二十八宿，一路出师来斗。大圣也公然不惧，调出独脚鬼王、七十二洞妖王与四个健将，就于洞门外列成阵势。你看这场混战好惊人也——</p>

<p>寒风飒飒，怪雾阴阴。那壁厢旌旗飞彩，这壁厢戈戟生辉。滚滚盔明，层层甲亮。滚滚盔明映太阳，如撞天的银磬；层层甲亮砌岩崖，似压地的冰山。大捍刀，飞云掣电；楮白枪，度雾穿云。方天戟，虎眼鞭，麻林摆列；青铜剑，四明铲，密树排阵。弯弓硬弩雕翎箭，短棍蛇矛挟了魂。大圣一条如意棒，翻来覆去战天神。杀得那空中无鸟过，山内虎狼奔。扬砂走石乾坤黑，播土飞尘宇宙昏。只听兵兵扑扑惊天地，煞煞威威振鬼神。</p>

<p>这一场自辰时布阵，混杀到日落西山。那独角鬼王与七十二洞妖怪，尽被众天神捉拿去了，止走了四健将与那群猴，深藏在水帘洞底，这大圣一条棒，抵住了四大天神与李托塔、哪吒太子，俱在半空中，杀彀多时。大圣见天色将晚，即拔毫毛一把，丢在口中，嚼碎了喷将出去，叫声：“变！”就变了千百个大圣，都使的是金箍棒，打退了哪吒太子，战败了五个天王。</p>

<p>大圣得胜，收了毫毛，急转身回洞，早又见铁板桥头，四个健将，领众叩迎那大圣，哽哽咽咽大哭三声，又唏唏哈哈大笑三声。大圣道：“汝等见了我，又哭又笑，何也？”四健将道：“今早帅众将与天王交战，把七十二洞妖王与独角鬼王，尽被众神捉了，我等逃生，故此该哭。这见大圣得胜回来，未曾伤损，故此该笑。”大圣道：“胜负乃兵家之常。古人云：杀人一万，自损三千。况捉了去的头目乃是虎豹狼虫、獾獐狐狢之类，我同类者未伤一个，何须烦恼？他虽被我使个分身法杀退，他还要安营在我山脚下。我等且紧紧防守，饱食一顿，安心睡觉，养养精神。天明看我使个大神通，拿这些天将，与众报仇。”四将与众猴将椰酒吃了几碗，安心睡觉不题。</p>

<p>那四大天王收兵罢战，众各报功：有拿住虎豹的，有拿住狮象的，有拿住狼虫狐狢的，更不曾捉着一个猴精。当时果又安辕营，下大寨，赏牜劳了得功之将，吩咐了天罗地网之兵，各各提铃喝号，围困了花果山，专待明早大战。各人得令，一处处谨守。此正是：妖猴作乱惊天地，布网张罗昼夜看。毕竟天晓后如何处治，且听下回分解。
