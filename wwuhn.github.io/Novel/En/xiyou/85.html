<P>The Indestructible Proteges of the Buddha Complete Enlightenment</P>
<P>The Dharma King Comes to the Truth Through His Own Nature</P>
</div>
<P>The story tells how Tang Sanzang kept his masculine essence intact and escaped from the terrible snare of mist and flowers. As he headed Westwards with Brother Monkey he did not notice that it was already summer: warm breezes were beginning to blow, and the early summer rain was falling. It was a beautiful sight:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Dark is the shade under tender green;</P>
<P>In the gentle breeze the swallows lead their young.</P>
<P>New lotus leaves are opening on the ponds;</P>
<P>Elegant bamboo is gradually reviving.</P>
<P>The fragrant plants join their blue to the sky;</P>
<P>Mountain flowers carpet all the ground.</P>
<P>Beside the stream the rushes are like swords;</P>
<P>The fiery pomegranate blossom makes the picture even more magnificent.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As the master and his three disciples traveled along enduring the heat they suddenly noticed two rows of tall willows, from under the shade of which an old woman emerged, leaning on a small boy. &#8220;Don't go any further, monk,&#8221; she called out. &#8220;Stop your horse and go back East as soon as you can. The road West leads nowhere.&#8221;</P>
<P>This gave Sanzang so bad a fright that he sprang off the horse, made a gesture of greeting and said, &#8220;Venerable Bodhisattva, in the words of the ancients,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>'The sea's breadth allows the fish to leap;</P>
<P>The sky's emptiness lets birds fly.'</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>How could there possibly be no way to the West?&#8221; To this the old woman replied, pointing Westwards, &#8220;If you go that way you will come to the capital of Dharmadestructia in a couple of miles. The king formed a hatred of Buddhism in an earlier existence, and in his present life he is punishing it without just cause. Two years ago he made a monstrous vow to kill ten thousand Buddhist monks. In that time he's killed 9,996 unknown monks in succession. He's just waiting for four famous monks to make up his ten thousand so that he will fulfil the vow. If you go into the city you will be throwing away your lives for nothing.&#8221;</P>
<P>At the sound of this Sanzang was so terrified that he shivered and shook as he replied, &#8220;Venerable Bodhisattva, I am deeply moved by your great kindness and infinitely grateful too. But, tell me, is there a suitable way I could take that does not go into the city?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no way round,&#8221; the old woman replied with a laugh, &#8220;no way round. The only way you'll get past it is if you can fly.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this Pig started shooting his mouth off from where he stood beside them: &#8220;Don't try to put us off. We can all fly.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey's fiery eyes with their golden pupils really could distinguish good from evil, and he saw that the old woman and the little boy on whom she was leaning were in fact the Bodhisattva Guanyin and the page Sudhana. He hastily flung himself to the ground and began to kowtow, calling out, &#8220;Bodhisattva, your disciple failed to welcome you. I'm sorry.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Bodhisattva then rose slowly on her multicolored cloud, so startling the venerable elder that his legs gave way under him and he kowtowed as he knelt there for all he was worth. Pig and Friar Sand also fell to their knees in alarm and kowtowed to heaven. A moment later she was heading straight back to the Southern Sea amid auspicious clouds.</P>
<P>Monkey then got up and supported his master as he said, &#8220;Get up please. The Bodhisattva's already gone back to her island.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; Sanzang said, &#8220;if you knew she was the Bodhisattva why did you not say so before?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You ask too many questions,&#8221; Monkey replied with a grin. &#8220;When I started kowtowing wasn't that early enough?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It was lucky the Bodhisattva told us that Dharmadestructia, where they kill monks, is ahead of us,&#8221; Pig and Friar Sand said to Monkey. &#8220;Whatever are we to do?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be afraid, idiot,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;We've come to no harm from any of the vicious demons and evil monsters we've met already or in the tigers' dens and dragons' pools we've been in. This is just a country of ordinary people. What's there to be so scared of? The only thing is that we can't stay here. It's getting late in the day and some of the villagers are coming back from market in the town. It will be no good if they see we're monks and raise a hue and cry. We'd better take the master away from the main road to some quiet and secluded spot where we can discuss things.&#8221; Sanzang accepted Monkey's suggestion and they slipped away from the main road to a hollow in the ground where they sat down.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you two look after the master while I turn myself into something and go into town to take a look around. I'll find a side road that we can get away along tonight.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;don't take this lightly. The royal law is implacable. You must be careful.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile, &#8220;don't worry. I can cope.&#8221;</P>
<P>This said, the Great Sage leapt whistling up into the air. It was very strange:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>No rope to hold on to above,</P>
<P>No pole to support him below.</P>
<P>Others are all like their parents,</P>
<P>But the weight of his bones was low.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As he stood in the clouds looking down he saw that the city was full of the most happy and auspicious atmosphere. &#8220;What a splendid place,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;Why are they trying to destroy the Dharma here?&#8221; He looked around for a while, and in the gathering dusk he saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Bright lights at the crossroads,</P>
<P>Incense and bells in the ninefold hall.</P>
<P>The seven brightest stars shone in the blue heavens,</P>
<P>And the travelers stopped moving in all eight directions.</P>
<P>From the army barracks</P>
<P>The painted bugle could just be heard;</P>
<P>In the drum tower</P>
<P>The copper water-clock began to drip.</P>
<P>All around the evening mists were dense;</P>
<P>Cold fog was thick in the markets.</P>
<P>Two by two the couples went to their beds</P>
<P>As the bright moon's disk was rising in the East.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;If I went down into the streets to look for our way with a face like this,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;anyone I saw would be sure I was a monk. I'd better change.&#8221; He made a spell with his hands, said the magic words, shook himself and turned into a moth, the sort that flies into the lantern:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A tiny body, a pair of delicate wings,</P>
<P>Who puts out the lamp and flies into the candle when seeking the light.</P>
<P>Formed by changing its own original body,</P>
<P>It makes its magic response in grass that's decaying.</P>
<P>Loving the burning light of the candle's flame,</P>
<P>Endlessly flying around it with never a pause,</P>
<P>The purple-clad moth with its scented wings drives off the fireflies;</P>
<P>What it likes best is the windless calm of the night.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Watch him as he flutters and flies straight to the main streets and the markets, keeping close to the eaves and the corners of the buildings he passes. As he was flying along he noticed an angled row of houses on a corner with a lantern hanging above each doorway.</P>
<P>&#8220;They must be celebrating the Lantern Festival here,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;Why else is that line of lighted lanterns there?&#8221; Stiffening his wings and flying up for a closer look, he saw that on a square lantern outside the middle house was written, &#8220;Accommodation for Commercial Travelers,&#8221; with &#8220;Wang the Second's Inn&#8221; beneath it. Only then did Monkey realize that this was an inn. Stretching his head forward for a closer look he saw eight or nine men inside who had all eaten their supper, taken off their clothes and hats, washed their hands and feet and gone to bed.</P>
<P>&#8220;The master will get through,&#8221; Monkey thought with secret delight. How did he know that? Because he was having a wicked idea: he would wait till they were all asleep, then steal their clothes and hats so that he and his companions could go into the city dressed as laymen.</P>
<P>Oh dear! This was one of those things that don't turn out as you want them to. While Monkey was still thinking about his plan Wang the Second went up to the merchants and said, &#8220;Please be vigilant, gentlemen. We have villains here as well as decent people. You must all be careful about your clothes and luggage.&#8221;</P>
<P>As you can imagine, the travelling merchants were all very vigilant, and the innkeeper's advice made them more cautious than ever. So they all got out of bed and said, &#8220;You're quite right, host. We travelers have a hard time. We're always worried that if there's some emergency when we're asleep we may not wake up; and if things go wrong we're in a mess. You'd better take all our clothes, hats and bags and look after them for us inside. Tomorrow morning you can give them back to us when we get up.&#8221;</P>
<P>Wang the Second then took all the clothes he could find into his own room. Monkey anxiously spread his wings, flew in there and landed on the hat stand, from where he saw Wang the Second take the lantern down from the door, lower the blinds, and shut the door and window. Only then did he go into his bedroom, undress and lie down.</P>
<P>Now Wang the Second had a wife and two children who were crying and making a noise, in no hurry to sleep. Wang's wife then started mending a torn piece of clothing, so that she too was still awake. &#8220;If I have to wait till that woman stops working and goes to sleep,&#8221; thought Monkey, &#8220;I'll be keeping the master waiting too.&#8221; He then started worrying that if he left it till much later the city gates would be shut, so he lost patience and flew down into the flame of the lamp. It was indeed a case of</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He was ready to die when he dived at the blaze,</P>
<P>And with brows scarred by fire to live out his days.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Having extinguished the lamp he shook himself and turned into a rat who gave a couple of squeaks, jumped down, grabbed hats and clothes and went outside. &#8220;Old man,&#8221; the woman said with alarm, &#8220;this is terrible. A rat's turned into a spirit.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he used another trick, blocking the doorway and yelling at the top of his voice, &#8220;That woman's talking nonsense, Wang the Second. Ignore her. I'm not a rat turned spirit. As a decent man I don't do underhanded things. I'm the Great Sage Equaling Heaven come down to earth to protect the Tang Priest while he goes to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven. I've come to borrow these clothes as a disguise for my master because your king is so wicked. I'll bring them back soon when we're out of the city.&#8221;</P>
<P>Once Wang the Second heard this he scrambled out of bed and started groping around the floor in the dark. He was in such a rush that when he got hold of his trousers he thought they were his shirt: there was no way he could put them on no matter how he tried.</P>
<P>By now the Great Sage had used lifting magic to escape on his cloud, which he turned round to go straight back to the hollow by the road. Sanzang was looking out for him fixedly by the bright light of the moon and the stars, and as soon as he saw Monkey approaching he called out, &#8220;Can we get through the capital of Dharmadestructia, disciple?&#8221;</P>
<P>Coming up and laying the clothes down in front of him, Monkey replied, &#8220;Master, you won't get through Dharmadestructia as a monk.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;who do you think you're making things hard for? It's easy to stop being a monk. All you have to do is stop shaving your head for six months and let your hair grow.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We can't wait six months,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;We're going to turn into laymen right now.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But that's a completely ridiculous thing to say,&#8221; said a shocked Pig. &#8220;We're all monks now, and if we turned into laymen straight away we wouldn't be able to wear hats. Even if we could pull them tight enough at the edges we've got no hair to tie the string at the top to.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop fooling about,&#8221; Sanzang shouted, &#8220;and be serious. What do you really have in mind?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've had a good look at this city, Master,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and although the king is a wicked one who kills monks he is a true son of heaven. There is an auspicious glow and a happy atmosphere above the city. I know my way round the streets now, and I can understand and talk the local language. I've just borrowed these hats and clothes from an inn for us to dress ourselves up as laymen in. We'll go into the city, put up for the night, get up at the fourth watch and ask the innkeeper to fix us some vegetarian food. At the fifth watch we'll go out through the gate and head West along the main road. If we meet anyone who tries to stop us we can talk our way out of it. I'll tell him we were sent by the ruler of their suzerain state. The king of Dharmadestructia won't dare hold us up. He'll let us go on our way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Our big brother has arranged things very well,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;Let's do as he suggests.&#8221;</P>
<P>The venerable elder did indeed have no option but to take off his monastic tunic and hat and put on a layman's clothing and headwear. Friar Sand changed too, but Pig's head was too big for him to be able to wear a hat. Monkey fetched needle and thread, tore two hats open and sewed them into a single one. Then he put the hat on Pig's head and found a garment big enough for him to wear. Finally he dressed himself and said, &#8220;Gentlemen, we must ban the words 'master' and 'disciples' on this journey.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What else can we call each other?&#8221; Pig asked. &#8220;We must talk like people who address each other as brothers,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;The master can call himself Tang the Eldest. You can be Hogg the Third, and Friar Sand can be Sand the Fourth. I'll be Sun the Second. But when we are in the inn none of you must say anything. Leave all the talking to me. When they ask what line of business we're in I'll say we're horse dealers. I'll pretend that the white horse is a sample and that there are ten of us altogether, of whom we four have come ahead to book rooms at an inn and sell this horse. The innkeeper will be bound to treat us well then. We'll be properly looked after, and before we leave I'll find a piece of broken tile and turn it into silver to pay him with. Then we'll be able to go on our way.&#8221; Although he was not happy about it the Tang Priest had to go along with this.</P>
<P>The four of them hurried to the city, leading the horse and carrying the luggage. As this was a very peaceful place the city gates were still open although it was already night. They went straight into the city, and as they passed the gateway of Wang the Second's inn they could hear shouting inside.</P>
<P>People were yelling, &#8220;My hat's disappeared!&#8221; and &#8220;My clothes have gone!&#8221; Pretending he did not know what this was all about, Monkey took them to an inn further along on the other side of the road. This inn was still showing its lantern, so Monkey went up to the gateway and called, &#8220;Do you have a vacant room for us, innkeeper?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; a woman answered from inside. &#8220;Please come upstairs, gentlemen.&#8221; Before she had finished speaking a man came out to take the horse. Monkey handed him the horse to take inside. He then led the master into the building in the shadow of the lamp. Upstairs there were tables and chairs conveniently arranged, and when the window was opened they all sat down in the clear moonlight.</P>
<P>When someone came with a lighted lamp Monkey blocked the doorway, blew it out and said, &#8220;No need for a lamp on a bright night like this.&#8221;</P>
<P>No sooner had the man with the lamp gone down than a maid came up with four bowls of tea. Monkey took the bowls from her, only for her to be followed by a woman who looked to be about fifty-six or fifty-seven coming up the stairs.</P>
<P>Standing beside Monkey she asked, &#8220;Where are you gentlemen from? What fine goods do you have?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We're from the North,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and we've got a few poor horses to sell.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're very young to be a horse dealer,&#8221; the woman said.</P>
<P>&#8220;This gentleman is Tang the Eldest,&#8221; Monkey explained, &#8220;this is Hogg the Third, and this is Sand the fourth. I'm Sun the Second, an apprentice.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But your surnames are all different,&#8221; said the woman with a smile. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;our surnames are different but we all live together. There are ten of us brothers altogether, and we four have come ahead to fix our board and lodging. The other six have found a place outside the city to stay tonight. It would have been awkward for them to come into the city as they've got a herd of horses. They'll come in tomorrow morning when we've fixed some accommodation. We won't go home till we've sold the horses.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How many horses are there in your herd?&#8221; the woman asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Over a hundred of all ages,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;They're all like that one of ours, except that they come in different colours.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Mr. Sun,&#8221; the woman said with a laugh, &#8220;you really know how to travel. You should have come straight here: no other inn would be able to put you up. We have a big courtyard well supplied with troughs and tethering posts and plenty of fodder too. We could feed several hundred horses here. There's just one thing I should mention. I've been keeping this inn for many years and it's quite well known. My late husband was called Zhao, but I'm afraid he died long ago, so this is now called Widow Zhao's Inn. We have three classes of entertainment for our guests. Let's get sordid money matters out of the way, then we can be more civilized later. The first thing is to discuss the tariffs and agree on one so that we know where we stand when it's time to settle the accounts.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Quite right,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;What are your three classes of entertainment? As the saying goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Your tariffs may be low, your tariffs may be dear,</P>
<P>But treat us all the same, who come from far or near.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>What do your tariffs involve? Could you explain them to me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We have first, second and third-class tariffs,&#8221; the old woman replied. &#8220;The first class is a banquet with five kinds of fruit and five different dishes. The tables are set with confectionery lions and immortals fighting. Two gentlemen share a table, and there are young ladies to sing to them and sleep with them. It costs half an ounce of silver per head, the price of the room included.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'd agree to that,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Where we come from half an ounce wouldn't even pay for a girl.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;For the second-class tariff,&#8221; the woman continued, &#8220;you all eat from the same dishes of food and we provide fruit and warm wine that you help yourselves to in your drinking games. No young ladies are provided and it costs one fifth of an ounce of silver each.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'd agree to that too,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;What about the third class?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I wouldn't like to discuss it with such distinguished gentlemen as yourselves,&#8221; she replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;No harm in telling us about it,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;so that we can choose what suits us best.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Nobody waits on you in the third class,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and we provide a big pot of rice for you to eat from as you will. When you're full there's straw for you to spread out on the ground and sleep on where it suits you. At dawn you give us a few coppers for the rice and I can assure you we won't argue about how much.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We're in luck,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;we're in luck. That's the sort of deal I like. I'll eat my fill from the cauldron then have a bloody good sleep in front of the stove.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What nonsense, brother,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;We've earned an ounce or two of silver on our travels. Give us the first-class treatment.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Make some good tea,&#8221; the woman said with great delight, &#8220;and tell the kitchen to get the food ready quickly.&#8221; She then went downstairs calling out, &#8220;Kill chickens and geese and boil up some pickled meat for them to have with their rice.&#8221;</P>
<P>Then she shouted, &#8220;Kill a pig and a sheep. What can't be eaten today can be served tomorrow. Get some good wine. Use the best white rice, and make some pancakes with white flour.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Sanzang heard all this from upstairs he said, &#8220;Whatever shall we do, Sun the Second? They're going to slaughter chickens, geese, a pig and a sheep. If they bring us all these we won't be able to eat them as we're all vegetarians.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've got an idea,&#8221; said Monkey, and he stamped in the doorway and called out, &#8220;Mrs. Zhao, come up here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What instructions do you have for me, sir,&#8221; she asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't kill any living creatures today. We're eating vegetarian food today,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Are you gentlemen permanent vegetarians, or just vegetarians for this month?&#8221; asked the woman in surprise.</P>
<P>&#8220;Neither,&#8221; replied Monkey. &#8220;We're vegetarians on<I> gengshen</I> days. Today's one, so we have to eat meatless food. But after the third watch tonight it'll be a<I> xinyou</I> day and the restrictions won't apply. Kill them tomorrow. Lay on some vegetarian food today, and make it first-class.&#8221;</P>
<P>This made the woman happier than ever. &#8220;Don't slaughter anything,&#8221; she said, hurrying downstairs, &#8220;don't slaughter anything. Fetch some tree-ear fungus, Fujian bamboo shoots, beancurd and wheat gluten. Pick some green vegetables in the garden, make vermicelli soup, steam some brad rolls, boil more white rice and make some scented tea.&#8221;</P>
<P>Now the cooks were experts because they cooked every day, so that everything was ready in an instant to be set out upstairs. They also had some confectioneries of lions and immortals that were already made for the four travelers to eat their fill of.</P>
<P>When the question was asked, &#8220;Would you like some mild wine?&#8221; Brother Monkey replied, &#8220;Eldest Brother Tang won't have any, but the rest of us will have a few cups.&#8221; The widow then fetched a jug of warm wine.</P>
<P>When drinks had been poured out for the three of them they heard the sound of banging against wooden boards. &#8220;Has some furniture fallen over downstairs, missus?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; the woman replied, &#8220;It's some retainers from my farm who arrived late this evening with rent rice. We let them sleep downstairs. As we were short-staffed when you gentlemen arrived I told them to take the sedan-chairs to the brothel to fetch some young ladies to keep you company. They must have hit the underneath of the floorboards with the chair-poles.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You mentioned that before,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;But don't send for them now. Today's a fast day, and besides, our brothers aren't here yet. They'll be here tomorrow for sure. Then we can all send for some call-girls and have a good time in your excellent establishment before we sell our horses and go.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What good men,&#8221; the woman said, &#8220;what good men. That way you'll all stay friends and you won't waste your energy.&#8221; Then she ordered that the sedan-chairs be brought back in as the whores were not to be fetched. The four of them finished their wine and food, the utensils were cleared away, and the meal was over.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are we going to sleep?&#8221; Sanzang whispered in Monkey's ear.</P>
<P>&#8220;Upstairs,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Too dangerous,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;We have all had so hard a journey that we may well fall fast asleep. If any of the inn people come in to tidy up and our hats have rolled off they will see our bald heads, realize that we are monks, and raise a hue and cry. That would be a disaster.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right,&#8221; said Monkey, going out to stamp his foot again.</P>
<P>&#8220;What instructions do you have this time, Mr. Sun?&#8221; the woman asked, coming upstairs once more.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are we to sleep?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Upstairs is best,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;There are no mosquitoes and there's a South wind. Open the windows wide and you'll sleep beautifully.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We won't be able to,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Our Mr. Hogg the Third has a touch of gout, Mr. Sand the Fourth has some rheumatism in his shoulder, Brother Tang can only sleep in the dark, and I don't like the light myself. So this is no place for us to sleep.&#8221;</P>
<P>As the woman went downstairs, leaning on the banisters and sighing, her daughter, who was carrying a child in her arms, came up to her and said, &#8220;Mother, as the saying goes, 'Be stuck on a sandbank for ten days, then said past nine sandbanks in one.' It's too hot now to be doing much business, but once autumn begins we'll have more than we can handle. What are you sighing like that for?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's not because business is slack, daughter,&#8221; the older woman replied. &#8220;I was just going to close the inn up this evening when four horse dealers came and took a room. They wanted the first-class tariff. I was hoping to make a little silver out of them, and I'm sighing because we won't earn much: they're fasting.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As they've already eaten they can't very well go to another inn,&#8221; the daughter replied. &#8220;And we'll be able to make money out of them when we serve them meat and wine tomorrow.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They're all poorly,&#8221; the older woman replied, &#8220;and want somewhere dark to sleep because they don't like drafts or light. All the rooms in the inn have got missing tiles, so where am I going to find somewhere dark for them? It'd be best to write off the cost of the meal and tell them to stay somewhere else.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But we do have somewhere dark in the house, mother,&#8221; her daughter replied, &#8220;where there's no draft and no light. It'll do splendidly.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where?&#8221; the older woman asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The big trunk that father had made when he was still alive,&#8221; the daughter replied. &#8220;It's four feet wide, seven feet long and three feet high, and big enough for seven people to sleep in. Tell them to sleep in the trunk.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I don't know whether it'll do,&#8221; said the older woman. &#8220;I'll ask them. Mr. Sun, if you won't have our poky little room there's nowhere darker here than our big trunk. It'll keep out light and drafts. So why don't you sleep in the trunk?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Splendid,&#8221; Monkey replied. She then told several of the retainers to carry the trunk out and open the lid, while inviting her guests to come downstairs. Monkey led the master and Friar Sand carried the luggage as they went to the trunk, following in the lantern's shadow. The reckless Pig was the first to climb inside. Friar Sand lifted the luggage in then helped the Tang Priest in before getting in himself.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where's our horse?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Tied up eating hay in the stables at the back,&#8221; replied the servant who was attending them.</P>
<P>&#8220;Bring it here,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;and bring the trough too. Tether the animal next to the trunk.&#8221; Only then did he get inside himself and call out, &#8220;Shut the lid, Mrs. Zhao, fasten the hasp and padlock it. And look it over for us. Glue paper wherever it lets in the light. Open it again early tomorrow morning.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're very particular,&#8221; the widow said. After that the doors were fastened and everyone went to bed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story switches to the four of them in the chest. Poor things! They were wearing hats, the weather was very hot and it was airless and stuffy. They took off their hats and clothes, and fanned themselves with their monastic hats for lack of fans. They were all crowded in next to each other and did not fall asleep till the second watch. Monkey, however, wanted to make trouble, so he stayed awake. He put his hand out and gave Pig a pinch on the leg.</P>
<P>The idiot pulled his leg in and mumbled, &#8220;Go to sleep. We've had a hard day. What do you want to fool around pinching people's hands and feet for?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We started by laying out five thousand ounces of silver,&#8221; said Monkey aloud, deliberately making mischief, &#8220;and we sold those horses the other day for three thousand. We've got four thousand in the two bags, and we'll sell this herd of horses for another three thousand. That means we'll have doubled our capital. That's not bad.&#8221; Pig, who was sleepy, did not bother to reply.</P>
<P>Now the floor staff, the water-carriers and the kitchen porters were in league with bandits. After hearing Brother Monkey talking about all the money they had, several of them slipped off to fetch twenty or more armed bandits to come with torches to rob the four horse traders. As they charger in through the gates they gave Widow Zhao and her daughter such a fright that shivering and shaking they fastened the doors of their room and let the robbers take whatever they wanted outside. Now the bandits were not after the inn's property but were looking for the guests. When they went upstairs and found no sign of them there, they lit their torches and held them out while they looked all around. All they could see was a large trunk in the courtyard, to the bottom of which was tethered a white horse. The lid was tightly locked and could not be prized open.</P>
<P>&#8220;Travelling merchants all know what they're about,&#8221; the bandits said. &#8220;This trunk looks so strong that it's bound to be full of purses, valuables and silk. Let's steal the horse, take the trunk out of town, open it up and share out what's inside. That would be the best thing, wouldn't it?&#8221; The bandits then found some rope with which they lifted the box and carried it off, swinging and swaying.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, woken up by this, &#8220;go to sleep. Why are you rocking us?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Shut up,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Nobody's rocking us.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang and Friar Sand had been abruptly awoken too, and they asked, &#8220;Who's carrying us?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Keep quiet,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;keep quiet. Let them carry us. If they carry us to the Western Heaven we'll be saved the trouble of walking.&#8221;</P>
<P>But the successful bandits were not heading West. Instead they headed towards the East of the city, killing the soldiers on the city gate, opening it and letting themselves out. This caused a sensation in the streets and the markets, where the watchmen of all the shops reported it to the commander-in-chief of the city garrison and the East city commissioner. As this was their responsibility the commander-in-chief and the East city commissioner mustered a force of infantry, cavalry and bowmen that left the city in pursuit of the bandits. Seeing that resistance to so powerful a government force would have been pointless, the bandits abandoned the trunk and the white horse, scattered into the undergrowth and disappeared. The government troops did not catch even half a robber: all they captured was the trunk and the white horse, with which they returned in triumph. The commander-in-chief examined the horse in the light of the lamps and saw that it was a fine one:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Threads of silver grew in his mane;</P>
<P>In his tail hung strands of jade.</P>
<P>Forget about Eight Chargers and dragon steeds;</P>
<P>This was steadier than the great Sushuang;</P>
<P>Its bones alone would have sold for a thousand ounces of silver;</P>
<P>It could gallop after the wind for three thousand miles.</P>
<P>When it climbed a mountain it merged into the clouds;</P>
<P>As it neighed at the moon it was as white as snow.</P>
<P>It was truly a dragon from an ocean island,</P>
<P>A unicorn of Jade in the human world.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The commander-in-chief rode the white horse instead of his own steed as he led his men back into the city. The trunk was carried to his headquarters, where he and the East city commissioner sealed it with strips of paper on which they wrote and set a guard over it till morning, when they would submit a memorial to the king and request a decision on what to do with it. After that the other troops were dismissed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story now tells how the venerable Tang Priest was grumbling at Monkey inside the chest. &#8220;Ape,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you've killed me this time. If I had been arrested outside and taken to the king of Dharmadestructia I might well have been able to put up a good argument in my defense. But now I am here, locked in this trunk. I have been carried off by bandits and recaptured by the army. When we are shown to the king tomorrow we will be all ready for him to put to the sword and make up his ten thousand.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There are people outside!&#8221; exclaimed Monkey. &#8220;If they open the trunk and take you out you'll either be tied up or hung up. If you don't want to be tied or strung up you'd better show a little patience. When we're taken to see this deluded king tomorrow I'll definitely be able to talk my way out of things. I guarantee that not one hair of yours will be harmed. So stop worrying and go back to sleep.&#8221;</P>
<P>In the third watch Monkey used one of his magic powers. Slipping his cudgel out he blew on it with a magic breath, called &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned it into a triple auger with which he drilled two or three holes near the bottom of the chest, forming a single larger hole. He put the auger away, shook himself, turned into an ant and crawled out. Then he turned back into himself and rode his cloud straight to the palace gates. The king was fast asleep at the time, so Monkey used his Great All powerful Body-dividing Magic.</P>
<P>Plucking all the hairs out of his left arm he blew on them with a magic breath, called &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned them into little Monkeys. Then he pulled all the hairs out from his right arm, blew on them with a magic breath, called &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned them into sleep-insects. Next he recited the magic word<I> Om</I> and told the local deity of the place to take the little Monkeys to distribute them throughout the palace to all the officials in every office and department of government. Each holder of official rank was given a sleep-insect to ensure that he or she would sleep soundly and not get up. Monkey then took his gold-banded cudgel in his hands, squeezed it, waved it, called, &#8220;Change, treasure!&#8221; and turned it into over a thousand razors of the sort used for shaving the head. Taking one himself, he told all the little monkeys to take one each and shave the heads of everyone in the inner quarters of the palace and in all the government departments and offices. This was indeed a case of:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the Dharma king would destroy it the Dharma is infinite;</P>
<P>The Dharma runs through heaven and earth, opening the Great Way.</P>
<P>The origins of ten thousand Dharmas all come down to one;</P>
<P>The features of the Three Vehicles are basically the same.</P>
<P>He bored through the trunk to find out the news,</P>
<P>Distributed his golden hairs to smash delusion,</P>
<P>Determined to bring the Dharma king to the true achievement,</P>
<P>To the eternal emptiness of what is not born and dies not.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>That night the head-shaving was completed, so Monkey said another spell to dismiss the local deity, shook himself to bring all the hairs back to his arms, then touched all the razors to turn them back into their true form as the gold-banded cudgel, which he made much smaller and hid in his ear again. Finally he reverted to being an ant, crawled back into the trunk, and went on guarding the Tang Priest in his time of danger.</P>
<P>When the palace ladies in the inner quarters got up to wash and do their hair before dawn the next morning they all found that their hair had gone. The same had happened to all the eunuchs, senior and junior, who moved around the palace. They all crowded to the outside of the royal bedchamber, where they played music to wake the king up, all holding back their tears but not daring to speak. Before long the queen in the palace woke up to find her hair gone too. When she hurried with lanterns to the dragon bed she found a monk sleeping in the brocade quilt, at which she could restrain her tongue no longer, thus awakening the king.</P>
<P>When the king suddenly opened his eyes wide and saw the queen's bald head he got straight out of bed and said, &#8220;Why are you like that, my queen?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're the same, Your Majesty,&#8221; she replied. The king then rubbed his head, which gave him such a fright that the three souls in his body groaned, and his seven spirits flew off into the air.</P>
<P>&#8220;What has happened to me?&#8221; he exclaimed.</P>
<P>Just when he was in this panicky state the royal consorts, the palace ladies and the eunuchs young and old all fell to their knees, their heads shaved bald, and said, &#8220;Lord, we have all been turned into monks.&#8221;</P>
<P>At the sight of them the king wept. &#8220;We think this must be because of all the monks we have killed,&#8221; he said. He then gave these orders: &#8220;None of you are to say anything about the loss of our hair as, if you do, the civil and military officials may slander our country and say that it has been badly governed. Let us now hold court in the throne hall.&#8221;</P>
<P>Now all the officials high and low in all the departments and offices of government went to court to pay their respects before dawn. As it turned out, all these men had lost their hair in the night too, and they all submitted memorials reporting the fact. All that could be heard was:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The whip of silence sounding three times at the royal audience;</P>
<P>As all report that their heads have now been shaved.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you do not know what happened to the booty in the trunk that the commander-in-chief had recaptured and whether the Tang Priest and his three disciples were to live or die, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>难灭伽持圆大觉</p>
<p>法王成正体天然</p>
</div>
<p>话说唐三藏固住元阳，出离了烟花苦套，随行者投西前进。不觉夏时，正值那熏风初动，梅雨丝丝，好光景：冉冉绿阴密，风轻燕引雏。新荷翻沼面，修竹渐扶苏。芳草连天碧，山花遍地铺。溪边蒲插剑，榴火壮行图。师徒四众，耽炎受热，正行处，忽见那路旁有两行高柳，柳阴中走出一个老母，右手下搀着一个小孩儿，对唐僧高叫道：“和尚，不要走了，快早儿拨马东回，进西去都是死路。“唬得个三藏跳下马来，打个问讯道：</p>

<p>“老菩萨，古人云，海阔从鱼跃，天空任鸟飞，怎么西进便没路了？”那老母用手朝西指道：“那里去，有五六里远近，乃是灭法国。那国王前生那世里结下冤仇，今世里无端造罪。二年前许下一个罗天大愿，要杀一万个和尚，这两年陆陆续续，杀彀了九千九百九十六个无名和尚，只要等四个有名的和尚，凑成一万，好做圆满哩。你们去，若到城中，都是送命王菩萨！”三藏闻言，心中害怕，战兢兢的道：“老菩萨，深感盛情，感谢不尽！但请问可有不进城的方便路儿，我贫僧转过去罢。”那老母笑道：</p>

<p>“转不过去，转不过去，只除是会飞的，就过去了也。”八戒在旁边卖嘴道：“妈妈儿莫说黑话，我们都会飞哩。”行者火眼金睛，其实认得好歹，那老母搀着孩儿，原是观音菩萨与善财童子，慌得倒身下拜，叫道：“菩萨，弟子失迎！失迎！”那菩萨一朵祥云，轻轻驾起，吓得个唐长老立身无地，只情跪着磕头。八戒沙僧也慌跪下，朝天礼拜。一时间，祥云缥缈，径回南海而去。行者起来，扶着师父道：“请起来，菩萨已回宝山也。”三藏起来道：“悟空，你既认得是菩萨，何不早说？”行者笑道：“你还问话不了，我即下拜，怎么还是不早哩？”八戒沙僧对行者道：“感蒙菩萨指示，前边必是灭法国，要杀和尚，我等怎生奈何？”行者道：“呆子休怕！我们曾遭着那毒魔狠怪，虎穴龙潭，更不曾伤损？此间乃是一国凡人，有何惧哉？只奈这里不是住处。天色将晚，且有乡村人家，上城买卖回来的，看见我们是和尚，嚷出名去，不当稳便。且引师父找下大路，寻个僻静之处，却好商议。”真个三藏依言，一行都闪下路来，到一个坑坎之下坐定。</p>

<p>行者道：“兄弟，你两个好生保守师父，待老孙变化了，去那城中看看，寻一条僻路，连夜去也。”三藏叮嘱道：“徒弟啊，莫当小可，王法不容，你须仔细！”行者笑道：“放心！放心！老孙自有道理。”</p>

<p>好大圣，话毕将身一纵，唿哨的跳在空中。怪哉：上面无绳扯，下头没棍撑，一般同父母，他便骨头轻。佇立在云端里、往下观看，只见那城中喜气冲融，祥光荡漾。行者道：“好个去处，为何灭法？”看一会，渐渐天昏，又见那：十字街灯光灿烂，九重殿香蔼钟鸣。七点皎星照碧汉，八方客旅卸行踪。六军营，隐隐的画角才吹；五鼓楼，点点的铜壶初滴。四边宿雾昏昏，三市寒烟蔼蔼。两两夫妻归绣幕，一轮明月上东方。他想着：“我要下去，到街坊打看路径，这般个嘴脸撞见人，必定说是和尚，等我变一变了。”捻着诀，念动真言，摇身一变，变做个扑灯蛾儿：</p>

<p>形细翼硗轻巧，灭灯扑烛投明。本来面目化生成，腐草中间灵应。每爱炎光触焰，忙忙飞绕无停。紫衣香翅赶流萤，最喜夜深风静。但见他翩翩翻翻，飞向六街三市。傍房檐，近屋角，正行时，忽见那隅头拐角上一湾子人家，人家门首挂着个灯笼儿。他道：“这人家过元宵哩？怎么挨排儿都点灯笼？”他硬硬翅飞近前来，仔细观看，正当中一家子方灯笼上，写着安歇往来商贾六字，下面又写着王小二店四字，行者才知是开饭店的。又伸头打一看，看见有八九个人，都吃了晚饭，宽了衣服，卸了头巾，洗了脚手，各各上床睡了。行者暗喜道：“师父过得去了。”你道他怎么就知过得去？他要起个不良之心，等那些人睡着，要偷他的衣服头巾，装做俗人进城。</p>

<p>噫，有这般不遂意的事！正思忖处，只见那小二走向前，吩咐：“列位官人仔细些，我这里君子小人不同，各人的衣物行李都要小心着。”你想那在外做买卖的人，那样不仔细？又听得店家吩咐，越发谨慎。他都爬起来道：“主人家说得有理，我们走路的人辛苦，只怕睡着，急忙不醒，一时失所，奈何？你将这衣服，头巾、搭联都收进去，待天将明，交付与我们起身。”那王小二真个把些衣物之类，尽情都搬进他屋里去了。行者性急，展开翅，就飞入里面，丁在一个头巾架上。又见王小二去门首摘了灯笼，放下吊搭，关了门窗，却才进房，脱衣睡下。那王小二有个婆婆，带了两个孩子，哇哇聒噪，急忙不睡。那婆子又拿了一件破衣，补补纳纲，也不见睡。行者暗想道：“若等这婆子睡下下手，却不误了师父？”又恐更深，城门闭了，他就忍不住，飞下去，望灯上一扑，真是舍身投火焰，焦额探残生，那盏灯早已息了。他又摇身一变，变作个老鼠，睳睳哇哇的叫了两声，跳下来，拿着衣服头巾，往外就走。那婆子慌慌张张的道：“老头子！</p>

<p>不好了！夜耗子成精也！”行者闻言，又弄手段，拦着门厉声高叫道：“王小二，莫听你婆子胡说，我不是夜耗子成精。明人不做暗事，吾乃齐天大圣临凡，保唐僧往西天取经。你这国王无道，特来借此衣冠，装扮我师父。一时过了城去，就便送还。”那王小二听言，一毂辘起来，黑天摸地，又是着忙的人，捞着裤子当衫子，左穿也穿不上，右套也套不上。</p>

<p>那大圣使个摄法，早已驾云出去，复翻身，径至路下坑坎边前。三藏见星光月皎，探身凝望，见是行者，来至近前，即开口叫道：“徒弟，可过得灭法国么？”行者上前放下衣物道：“师父，要过灭法国，和尚做不成。”八戒道：“哥，你勒掯那个哩？不做和尚也容易，只消半年不剃头，就长出毛来也。”行者道：“那里等得半年！眼下就都要做俗人哩！”那呆子慌了道：“但你说话，通不察理。我们如今都是和尚，眼下要做俗人，却怎么戴得头巾？就是边儿勒住，也没收顶绳处。”三藏喝道：“不要打花，且干正事！端的何如？”行者道：“师父，他这城池我已看了。虽是国王无道杀僧，却倒是个真天子，城头上有祥光喜气。城中的街道，我也认得，这里的乡谈，我也省得，会说。却才在饭店内借了这几件衣服头巾，我们且扮作俗人，进城去借了宿，至四更天就起来，教店家安排了斋吃；捱到五更时候，挨城门而去，奔大路西行，就有人撞见扯住，也好折辨，只说是上邦钦差的，灭法王不敢阻滞，放我们来的。”沙僧道：“师兄处的最当，且依他行。”真个长老无奈，脱了褊衫，去了僧帽，穿了俗人的衣服，戴了头巾。沙僧也换了，八戒的头大，戴不得巾儿，被行者取了些针线，把头巾扯开，两顶缝做一顶，与他搭在头上，拣件宽大的衣服，与他穿了，然后自家也换上一套道：“列位，这一去，把师父徒弟四个字儿且收起。”八戒道：“除了此四字，怎的称呼？”行者道：“都要做弟兄称呼：师父叫做唐大官儿，你叫做朱三官儿，沙僧叫做沙四官儿，我叫做孙二官儿。但到店中，你们切休言语，只让我一个开口答话。等他问甚么买卖，只说是贩马的客人。把这白马做个样子，说我们是十弟兄，我四个先来赁店房卖马。那店家必然款待我们，我们受用了，临行时，等我拾块瓦查儿，变块银子谢他，却就走路。”长老无奈，只得曲从。</p>

<p>四众忙忙的牵马挑担，跑过那边。此处是个太平境界，入更时分，尚未关门，径直进去，行到王小二店门首，只听得里边叫哩。有的说：“我不见了头巾！”有的说：“我不见了衣服！”行者只推不知，引着他们，往斜对门一家安歇。那家子还未收灯笼，即近门叫道：“店家，可有闲房儿我们安歇？”那里边有个妇人答应道：“有，有，有，请官人们上楼。”说不了，就有一个汉子来牵马。行者把马儿递与牵进去，他引着师父，从灯影儿后面，径上楼门。那楼上有方便的桌椅，推开窗格，映月光齐齐坐下。</p>

<p>只见有人点上灯来，行者拦门，一口吹息道：“这般月亮不用灯。”那人才下去，又一个丫环拿四碗清茶。行者接住，楼下又走上一个妇人来，约有五十七八岁的模样，一直上楼，站着旁边问道：“列位客官，那里来的？有甚宝货？”行者道：“我们是北方来的，有几匹粗马贩卖。”那妇人道：“贩马的客人尚还小。”</p>

<p>行者道：“这一位是唐大官，这一位是朱三官，这一位是沙四官，我学生是孙二官。”妇人笑道：“异姓。”行者道：“正是异姓同居。我们共有十个弟兄，我四个先来赁店房打火；还有六个在城外借歇，领着一群马，因天晚不好进城。待我们赁了房子，明早都进来，只等卖了马才回。”那妇人道：“一群有多少马？”</p>

<p>行者道：“大小有百十匹儿，都象我这个马的身子，却只是毛片不一。”妇人笑道：“孙二官人诚然是个客纲客纪。早是来到舍下，第二个人家也不敢留你。我舍下院落宽阔，槽札齐备，草料又有，凭你几百匹马都养得下。却一件：我舍下在此开店多年，也有个贱名。先夫姓赵，不幸去世久矣，我唤做赵寡妇店。我店里三样儿待客。如今先小人，后君子，先把房钱讲定后好算帐。”行者道：“说得是。你府上是那三样待客？常言道，货有高低三等价，客无远近一般看，你怎么说三样待客？你可试说说我听。”赵寡妇道：“我这里是上、中、下三样。上样者：五果五菜的筵席，狮仙斗糖桌面二位一张，请小娘儿来陪唱陪歇，每位该银五钱，连房钱在内。”行者笑道：“相应啊！我那里五钱银子还不彀请小娘儿哩。”寡妇又道：“中样者：合盘桌儿，只是水果、热酒，筛来凭自家猜枚行令，不用小娘儿，每位只该二钱银子。”行者道：“一发相应！下样儿怎么？”妇人道：“不敢在尊客面前说。”行者道：“也说说无妨，我们好拣相应的干。”妇人道：</p>

<p>“下样者：没人伏侍，锅里有方便的饭，凭他怎么吃：吃饱了，拿个草儿，打个地铺，方便处睡觉，天光时，凭赐几文饭钱，决不争竞。”八戒听说道：“造化，造化！老朱的买卖到了！等我看着锅吃饱了饭，灶门前睡他娘！”行者道：“兄弟，说那里话！你我在江湖上，那里不赚几两银子！把上样的安排将来。”那妇人满心欢喜，即叫：“看好茶来，厨下快整治东西。”遂下楼去，忙叫：</p>

<p>“宰鸡宰鹅，煮腌下饭。”又叫：“杀猪杀羊，今日用不了，明日也可用。看好酒，拿白米做饭，白面捍饼。”三藏在楼上听见道：</p>

<p>“孙二官，怎好？他去宰鸡鹅，杀猪羊，倘送将来，我们都是长斋，那个敢吃？”行者道：“我有主张。”去那楼门边跌跌脚道：</p>

<p>“赵妈妈，你上来。”那妈妈上来道：“二官人有甚吩咐？”行者道：“今日且莫杀生，我们今日斋戒。”寡妇惊讶道：“官人们是长斋，是月斋？”行者道：“俱不是，我们唤做庚申斋。今朝乃是庚申日当斋，只过三更后，就是辛酉，便开斋了，你明日杀生罢。如今且去安排些素的来，定照上样价钱奉上。”那妇人越发欢喜，跑下去教：“莫宰！莫宰！取些木耳、闽笋、豆腐、面筋，园里拔些青菜，做粉汤，发面蒸卷子，再煮白米饭，烧香茶。”咦！</p>

<p>那些当厨的庖丁，都是每日家做惯的手段，霎时间就安排停当，摆在楼上。又有现成的狮仙糖果，四众任情受用。又问：</p>

<p>“可吃素酒？”行者道：“止唐大官不用，我们也吃几杯。”寡妇又取了一壶暖酒，他三个方才斟上，忽听得乒乓板响，行者道：</p>

<p>“妈妈，底下倒了甚么家火了？”寡妇道：“不是，是我小庄上几个客子送租米来晚了，教他在底下睡。因客官到，没人使用，教他们抬轿子去院中请小娘儿陪你们，想是轿杠撞得楼板响。”</p>

<p>行者道：“早是说哩，快不要去请。一则斋戒日期，二则兄弟们未到。索性明日进来，一家请个表子，在府上耍耍时，待卖了马起身。”寡妇道：“好人！好人！又不失了和气，又养了精神。”教：</p>

<p>“抬进轿子来，不要请去。”四众吃了酒饭，收了家火，都散讫。</p>

<p>三藏在行者耳根边悄悄的道：“那里睡？”行者道：“就在楼上睡。”三藏道：“不稳便。我们都辛辛苦苦的，倘或睡着，这家子一时再有人来收拾，见我们或滚了帽子，露出光头，认得是和尚，嚷将起来，却怎么好？”行者道：“是啊！”又去楼前跌跌脚。寡妇又上来道：“孙官人又有甚吩咐？”行者道：“我们在那里睡？”妇人道：“楼上好睡，又没蚊子，又是南风，大开着窗子，忒好睡觉。”行者道：“睡不得，我这朱三官儿有些寒湿气，沙四官儿有些漏肩风，唐大哥只要在黑处睡，我也有些儿羞明。此间不是睡处。”那妈妈走下去，倚着柜栏叹气。他有个女儿，抱着个孩子近前道：“母亲，常言道，十日滩头坐，一日行九滩，如今炎天，虽没甚买卖，到交秋时，还做不了的生意哩，你嗟叹怎么？”妇人道：“儿啊，不是愁没买卖。今日晚间，已是将收铺子，入更时分，有这四个马贩子来赁店房，他要上样管待。实指望赚他几钱银子，他却吃斋，又赚不得他钱，故此嗟叹。”那女儿道：“他既吃了饭，不好往别人家去。明日还好安排荤酒，如何赚不得他钱？”妇人又道：“他都有病，怕风羞亮，都要在黑处睡。你想家中都是些单浪瓦儿的房子，那里去寻黑暗处？不若舍一顿饭与他吃了，教他往别家去罢。”女儿道：“母亲，我家有个黑处，又无风色，甚好，甚好。”妇人道：“是那里？”女儿道：</p>

<p>“父亲在日曾做了一张大柜。那柜有四尺宽，七尺长，三尺高下，里面可睡六七个人。教他们往柜里睡去罢。”妇人道：“不知可好，等我问他一声。孙官人，舍下蜗居，更无黑处，止有一张大柜，不透风，又不透亮，往柜里睡去如何？”行者道：“好！好！</p>

<p>好！”即着几个客子把柜抬出，打开盖儿，请他们下楼。行者引着师父，沙僧拿担，顺灯影后径到柜边。八戒不管好歹就先睮进柜去，沙僧把行李递入，搀着唐僧进去，沙僧也到里边。行者道：“我的马在那里？”旁有伏侍的道：“马在后屋拴着吃草料哩。”行者道：“牵来，把糟抬来，紧挨着柜儿拴住。”方才进去，叫：“赵妈妈，盖上盖儿，插上锁钉，锁上锁子，还替我们看看，那里透亮，使些纸儿糊糊，明日早些儿来开。”寡妇道：“忒小心了！”遂此各各关门去睡不题。</p>

<p>却说他四个到了柜里，可怜啊！一则乍戴个头巾，二来天气炎热，又闷住了气，略不透风，他都摘了头巾，脱了衣服，又没把扇子，只将僧帽扑扑扇扇。你挨着我，我挤着你，直到有二更时分，却都睡着，惟行者有心闯祸，偏他睡不着，伸过手将八戒腿上一捻。那呆子缩了脚，口里哼哼的道：“睡了罢！辛辛苦苦的，有甚么心肠还捻手捻脚的耍子？”行者捣鬼道：“我们原来的本身是五千两，前者马卖了三千两，如今两搭联里现有四千两，这一群马还卖他三千两，也有一本一利，彀了！彀了！”八戒要睡的人，那里答对。岂知他这店里走堂的，挑水的，烧火的，素与强盗一伙，听见行者说有许多银子，他就着几个溜出去，伙了二十多个贼，明火执杖的来打劫马贩子。冲开门进来，唬得那赵寡妇娘女们战战兢兢的关了房门，尽他外边收拾。原来那贼不要店中家火，只寻客人。到楼上不见形迹，打着火把，四下照看，只见天井中一张大柜，柜脚上拴着一匹白马，柜盖紧锁，掀翻不动。众贼道：“走江湖的人都有手眼，看这柜势重，必是行囊财帛锁在里面。我们偷了马，抬柜出城，打开分用，却不是好？”那些贼果找起绳扛，把柜抬着就走，幌阿幌的。八戒醒了道：“哥哥，睡罢，摇甚么？”行者道：“莫言语！没人摇。”三藏与沙僧忽地也醒了，道：“是甚人抬着我们哩？”行者道：“莫嚷，莫嚷！等他抬！抬到西天，也省得走路。”</p>

<p>那贼得了手，不往西去，倒抬向城东，杀了守门的军，打开城门出去。当时就惊动六街三市，各铺上火甲人夫，都报与巡城总兵、东城兵马司。那总兵、兵马，事当干己，即点人马弓兵，出城赶贼。那贼见官军势大，不敢抵敌，放下大柜，丢了白马，各自落草逃走。众官军不曾拿得半个强盗，只是夺下柜，捉住马，得胜而回。总兵在灯光下见那马，好马：鬃分银线，尾軃玉条。说甚么八骏龙驹，赛过了骕骦款段。千金市骨，万里追风。</p>

<p>登山每与青云合，啸月浑如白雪匀。真是蛟龙离海岛，人间喜有玉麒麟。总兵官把自家马儿不骑，就骑上这个白马，帅军兵进城，把柜子抬在总府，同兵马写个封皮封了，令人巡守，待天明启奏，请旨定夺。官军散讫不题。</p>

<p>却说唐长老在柜里埋怨行者道：“你这个猴头，害杀我也！</p>

<p>若在外边，被人拿住，送与灭法国王，还好折辨；如今锁在柜里，被贼劫去，又被官军夺来，明日见了国王，现现成成的开刀请杀，却不凑了他一万之数？”行者道：“外面有人！打开柜，拿出来不是捆着，便是吊着。且忍耐些儿，免了捆吊。明日见那昏君，老孙自有对答，管你一毫儿也不伤，且放心睡睡。”挨到三更时分，行者弄个手段，顺出棒来，吹口仙气，叫“变！”即变做三尖头的钻儿，挨柜脚两三钻，钻了一个眼子。收了钻，摇身一变，变做个蝼蚁儿，睮将出去，现原身，踏起云头，径入皇宫门外。那国王正在睡浓之际，他使个大分身普会神法，将左臂上毫毛都拔下来，吹口仙气，叫“变！”都变做小行者。右臂上毛，也都拔下来，吹口仙气，叫“变！”都变做瞌睡虫；念一声“唵”字真言，教当坊土地，领众布散皇宫内院，五府六部，各衙门大小官员宅内，但有品职者，都与他一个瞌睡虫，人人稳睡，不许翻身。又将金箍棒取在手中，掂一掂，幌一幌，叫声“宝贝，变！”即变做千百口剃头刀儿，他拿一把，吩咐小行者各拿一把，都去皇宫内院、五府六部、各衙门里剃头。咦！这才是：法王灭法法无穷，法贯乾坤大道通。万法原因归一体，三乘妙相本来同。钻开玉柜明消息，布散金毫破蔽蒙。管取法王成正果，不生不灭去来空。这半夜剃削成功，念动咒语，喝退土地神祇，将身一抖，两臂上毫毛归伏，将剃头刀总捻成真，依然认了本性，还是一条金箍棒收来些小之形，藏于耳内。复翻身还做蝼蚁，钻入柜内！现了本相，与唐僧守困不题。</p>

<p>却说那皇宫内院宫娥彩女，天不亮起来梳洗，一个个都没了头发。穿宫的大小太监，也都没了头发，一拥齐来，到于寝宫外，奏乐惊寝，个个噙泪，不敢传言。少时，那三宫皇后醒来，也没了头发，忙移灯到龙床下看处，锦被窝中，睡着一个和尚，皇后忍不住言语出来，惊醒国王。那国王急睁睛，见皇后的头光，他连忙爬起来道：“梓童，你如何这等？”皇后道：“主公亦如此也。”那皇帝摸摸头，唬得三尸呻咋，七魄飞空，道：“朕当怎的来耶！”正慌忙处，只见那六院嫔妃，宫娥彩女，大小太监，皆光着头跪下道：“主公，我们做了和尚耶！”国王见了，眼中流泪道：“想是寡人杀害和尚。”即传旨吩咐：“汝等不得说出落发之事，恐文武群臣，褒贬国家不正，且都上殿设朝。”</p>

<p>却说那五府六部，合衙门大小官员，天不明都要去朝王拜阙。原来这半夜一个个也没了头发，各人都写表启奏此事。只听那：静鞭三响朝皇帝，表奏当今剃发因。毕竟不知那总兵官夺下柜里贼赃如何，与唐僧四众的性命如何，且听下回分解。</p>
