<P>Sanzang, Delivered, Crosses a Border</P>
<P>A Grateful Pig Tours Mountains and Forests</P>
</div>
<P>A poem says</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If wild thoughts are not firmly suppressed</P>
<P>There is no point in seeking for the Truth;</P>
<P>If you wish to cultivate your nature before the Buddha,</P>
<P>Why stay halfway between awakening and confusion?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Once awakened you can achieve the Right in an instant;</P>
<P>The confused will drift for ten thousand aeons.</P>
<P>If you can invoke the Buddha and cultivate the Truth,</P>
<P>Sins countless as the Ganges sands can be wiped out.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Pig and Friar Sand had fought thirty inconclusive rounds with the monster. Do you know why they were inconclusive? As far as skill went not even twenty monks, let alone two, would have been a match for that evil I spirit. Yet because the Tang Priest was not fated to die he was being secretly protected by Dharma-guarding deities. There were also the Six 9&#8221; Dings, the Six Jias, the Revealers of the Truth of the Five Regions, the Four Duty Gods, and the Eighteen Defenders of the Faith helping Pig and Friar Sand in mid-air.</P>
<P>We must leave the three of them locked in struggle and return to Sanzang sobbing his heart out in the cave and speculating about his disciples. &#8220;I wonder if you have met a benefactor in a village somewhere, Pig,&#8221; he thought, tears streaming down his face, &#8220;and have been overcome by your greed for the offerings. Wherever are you looking for him, Friar Sand? Will you find him? Little do you know of my sufferings at the hands of this fiend I have run into. When will I see you again and be delivered from my troubles so that we can hurry to the Vulture Peak?&#8221; As he fretted and wailed he saw a woman come out from the innermost part of the cave. &#8220;Venerable father,&#8221; she said, leaning on the soul-fixing stake, &#8220;where have you come from? Why has he tied you here?&#8221; When Sanzang heard this he sneaked a quick look at her through his tears and observed that she was about thirty. &#8220;Don't ask me that, Bodhisattva,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I was fated to die: I walked into your home. Eat me if you must, but don't ask me why.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I don't eat people,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;My home is over a hundred miles West of here in the city called Elephantia. I'm the third daughter of the king, and my childhood name was Prettier-than-a-flower. Thirteen years ago, on the fifteenth night of the eighth month, that evil monster came and snatched me away in a whirlwind while we were out enjoying the full moon. I have been his wife all these thirteen years and borne him sons and daughters, but I've never been able to send any message home. I miss my parents, and I can never see them. Where did you come from to be caught by him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I was sent to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures,&#8221; replied Sanzang. &#8220;I never realized when I set out for a stroll that I would stumble into this. Now he's going to capture my two disciples and steam us all together, then eat us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry, venerable sir,&#8221; said the princess with a smile. &#8220;As you are going to fetch scriptures I can save you. Elephantia lies on the main route to the West, and if you will take this letter to my parents for me, I'll make him spare your life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you save my wretched life, Bodhisattva,&#8221; said Sanzang with a bow, &#8220;I promise to be your messenger.&#8221;</P>
<P>The princess hurried back inside, wrote a letter to her family, sealed it, released Sanzang from the stake, and handed him the letter. &#8220;Bodhisattva,&#8221; he said, taking the letter now that he was free, &#8220;I am very grateful to you for saving my life. When I reach your country I shall give this to the King. My only worry is that after all these years your parents may not believe that the letter is from you, and what would I do then? I couldn't have them thinking that I was trying to deceive them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's no problem. My father has only us three daughters and no sons. If they see this letter they'll feel that they're seeing me.&#8221; Tucking the letter securely into his sleeve, he took his leave of the princess, and was on the point of going out when she pulled him back and said, &#8220;You won't be able to get out through the front gate. All those big and little monsters are outside the gates waving banners, shouting war-cries, and beating drums and gongs to help the monster king in his battle with your two disciples. You'd better go out the back way. If the monster king catches you he'll interrogate you under torture, and if the junior fiends grab you they'll kill you without a qualm. I'll go to see him and talk him over. If he's prepared to let you go, your disciples can ask his permission for all three of you to go together.&#8221; Sanzang kowtowed and, as she had told him, left her, slipped out through the back door, and hid among the thorns rather than travel alone.</P>
<P>The princess, who had thought out a clever plan, hurried out through the front gates and made her way through the hosts of demons great and small to hear the furious clash of arms. Pig and Friar Sand were still fighting with the monster in mid-air. &#8220;Lord Yellow Robe,&#8221; she shouted at the top of her voice, and as soon as he heard her the demon king left Pig and Friar Sand, landed his cloud, and grasping his steel sword, took his wife by the arm.</P>
<P>&#8220;What is it, wife?&#8221; he asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I was lying in bed asleep just now, husband,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;and I dreamt that I saw a god in golden armor.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What sort of god in golden armor?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Why did he come here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When I was a child in the palace,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I made a secret vow that if I married a good husband I would climb holy mountains, visit Immortals, and give alms to monks. I have now been happily married to you for thirteen years without ever mentioning the vow before, and the god in golden armor came to make me fulfil it. His shouting made me wake up, and then I realized it was a dream. I tidied myself up and came straight to tell you about it. To my surprise I found a monk tied to the stake. I beg you, lord and master, to respect my vow and spare that monk in your mercy. This will count as feeding monks and will fulfil my vow. Will you do this?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a fusser you are, wife,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Nothing to it. If I want to eat people I can easily catch a few more. If that's how things stand, let the monk go.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please may he be released through the back door, husband?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a thing to bother me with. Let him go, and I don't care whether it's by the front way or the back way.&#8221; The monster then grasped his sword once more and shouted, &#8220;Come here, Pig. I'm not afraid of you, but I'm not fighting you any longer. For my wife's sake I've spared your master, so hurry round and find him at the back door and carry on West. If you set foot in my territory again I won't let you off a second time.&#8221;</P>
<P>This news made Pig and Friar Sand feel as if they had been let out through the gates of Hell. They scurried away with the horse and the baggage, and going round to the other end of the Moon Waters Cave they called &#8220;Master&#8221; outside the back entrance. Sanzang recognized their voices and called back from among the thorn bushes. Friar Sand made his way through the undergrowth, helped his master out, and hurriedly helped him mount the horse.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When he was threatened by the terrible blue-faced monster</P>
<P>He was lucky to meet the devout princess.</P>
<P>Escaping from the golden hook, the turtle</P>
<P>Swam off through the waves with a flick of his tail.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>With Pig leading and Friar Sand bringing up the rear, they left the pine forest and traveled along the main track. The two disciples grumbled and complained, while Sanzang tried to conciliate them. Every evening they would find lodgings, and they would be up again at cock-crow. They covered stage after stage of their journey, sometimes longer and sometimes shorter, and before they realized it they had done ninety-nine miles. Suddenly they looked up and there was a fine city in front of them. This was Elephantia, and it was a splendid place:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Distant clouds,</P>
<P>A long road;</P>
<P>Although this was a distant land,</P>
<P>The scenery was as fine as home.</P>
<P>Auspicious mists enshrouded the city;</P>
<P>Fresh breezes were blowing under the clear moon.</P>
<P>Towering mountains, seen from afar,</P>
<P>Were spread out like a picture.</P>
<P>Rivers flowed rippling,</P>
<P>Like streams of crushed jasper.</P>
<P>There were fields upon fields of farmland</P>
<P>Where new crops sprouted close together.</P>
<P>A handful of fishermen worked three stretches of water,</P>
<P>A wood-gatherer carried twigs from a couple of hills.</P>
<P>The outer wall</P>
<P>And the inner wall of the city,</P>
<P>Were rock-solid.</P>
<P>The houses</P>
<P>And homes</P>
<P>Vied in elegance.</P>
<P>Nine-storied pavilions were like palaces,</P>
<P>High towers like imperial columns.</P>
<P>There was a Hall of the Great Ultimate,</P>
<P>A Flowery Canopied Hall,</P>
<P>A Hall of Incense,</P>
<P>A Hall of Literary Perusal,</P>
<P>A Hall of Government Proclaimed,</P>
<P>A Hall of Splendor Extended,</P>
<P>All with steps of jade and gold</P>
<P>Where civil and military officers stood in their ranks.</P>
<P>There was also a Great Brightness Palace,</P>
<P>A Palace of Shining Radiance,</P>
<P>A Palace of Eternal Joy,</P>
<P>A Palace of Illustrious Purity,</P>
<P>A Palace of Established Enlightenment,</P>
<P>A Palace of Inexhaustible Glory.</P>
<P>In every palace were gongs, drums, pipes and flutes,</P>
<P>Lamenting the sorrows of spring and the harem's woes.</P>
<P>Then there were imperial parks</P>
<P>Where dew bathed the flowers' tender petals;</P>
<P>And royal canals</P>
<P>Where willows bent their slender waists in the wind.</P>
<P>On the highways</P>
<P>Were belted gentlemen in official hats,</P>
<P>Attired in all their splendor</P>
<P>As they rode in five-horsed chariots;</P>
<P>In remote corners</P>
<P>Were archers with bows and arrows</P>
<P>Whose shots split the clouds apart</P>
<P>And skewered pairs of hawks.</P>
<P>What with the willow-lined streets,</P>
<P>And the houses full of music,</P>
<P>This spring scene rivaled the Luoyang Bridge.</P>
<P>The pilgrim who was seeking the sutras</P>
<P>Was torn with nostalgia for the Great Tang;</P>
<P>The disciples accompanying their master</P>
<P>In a rest-house found happiness in their dream.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Gazing at the view of Elephantia the master and his two disciples dealt with the luggage and the horse and settled down in a rest-house.</P>
<P>The Tang Priest went on foot to the palace gates, where he said to the High Custodian of the gate, &#8220;I beg you to report that there is a monk from the Tang Court who has come for a personal audience with His Majesty and has a letter of credentials.&#8221;</P>
<P>A eunuch messenger hurried to the white jade steps and announced, &#8220;Your Majesty, a distinguished priest from the Tang Court has come for an audience as he has a letter of credentials to deliver.&#8221; The king was delighted to hear that he was from the mighty land of Tang and was himself a venerable and holy monk, so he gave his approval at once with the words, &#8220;Call him in.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang was summoned to the golden steps, where he danced in obeisance and called out the correct greeting. On either side the many civil and military officers all sighed with admiration and said, &#8220;What impressive music and ritual this gentleman from that distinguished country has.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Venerable sir, why have you come to my country?&#8221; the king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I am a Buddhist from the land of Tang,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;and I am going to the Western Heaven on the Emperor's orders to fetch the scriptures. I am carrying a letter of credentials, and now that I have arrived in Your Majesty's country it seems proper to hand it to you. Not knowing whether to advance or retreat, I must apologize for disturbing the Dragon Countenance.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you have Tang credentials,&#8221; the king replied, &#8220;bring them here for me to see.&#8221; Sanzang handed the letter up respectfully with both hands and unfolded it on the king's table. It read:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>From the Tang Emperor of the Great Tang Kingdom, who reigns by order of Heaven, in the Southern Continent of Jambudvipa.</P>
<P>Despite our feeble virtues we have succeeded to the throne, and in worshipping the gods and ruling the people we are as careful morning and night as if we were on the edge of a precipice or treading on thin ice. Because we failed to save the Dragon King of the Jing River, punishment was visited on our august self; our souls were rushed to the underworld and we became a guest in the land of death. As our lifespan was not yet over, the Lord of Darkness sent us back to the world of the living. We held a Great Assembly of monks and built a holy altar where the souls of the dead could be brought over to the other side. To our great gratitude the Bodhisattva Guanyin, the deliverer from suffering, appeared in person and told us that there is a Buddha in the West who has scriptures that will save the lost and bring lonely souls who have nobody to help them over to the other side. We have therefore especially commissioned the Patriarch Xuanzang to make the long journey across countless mountains to seek for the scriptures and psalms. Should he come to any countries in the West we hope that on seeing this letter they will allow him to go on his way and not impede this predestined good deed. This is addressed to whom it may concern. Given by His Imperial Majesty on an auspicious day in the autumn of the thirteenth year of<I> Then Guan</I> of the Great Tang.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When he had read this letter, which bore nine imperial seals, the king sealed it with his great seal and handed it back to Sanzang, who thanked him as he took it. &#8220;Not only did I have a letter of credentials to present,&#8221; he reported, &#8220;I have also brought a family letter to deliver to Your Majesty.&#8221; The king was delighted and asked what it was. &#8220;I happened to meet Your Majesty's third princess, who was carried off by the Yellow-Robed Monster of the Moon Waters Cave in the Bowl Mountain, and she gave me this letter to deliver to you.&#8221; Tears poured from the king's eyes at the news, and he said, &#8220;It is thirteen years since I saw her last, and I don't know how many military and civil officers I can have dismissed or degraded, and how many of the ladies-in-waiting, serving maids, and eunuchs I have had beaten to death since then. I imagined that she had wandered out of the palace and lost her way, and I looked for her everywhere. Even when all the ordinary citizens were interrogated I could find no news of her whereabouts. I never thought that an evil monster could have carried her off. Hearing this all of a sudden makes me weep for sorrow.&#8221; Sanzang produced the letter from his sleeve and handed it to the king, who on seeing the words, &#8220;All is well&#8221; on the outside felt so weak in his hands that he could not open it. He ordered a Grand Scholar from the Academy of Letters to climb the steps of the throne and read it aloud. As the Grand Scholar climbed the steps of the throne, the civil and military officials in front of the throne room and the empresses, royal consorts, and palace ladies behind it all listened intently. The Grand Scholar opened it and read aloud:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Your unworthy daughter Prettier-than-a-flower kowtows one hundred times to His Most Excellent Majesty the King her father in the Dragon and Phoenix Palace, to her Majesty the Queen her mother outside the Palace of Shining Radiance, and to all the noble ministers and generals of the court; it is my pleasure to send news to you and thank you for the infinite trouble you have taken on my behalf. But I am unable to devote myself to cheering Your Majesty and carry out my filial duties to the full.</P>
<P>Thirteen years ago, on the festive fifteenth night of the eighth month, when banquets were being given in all the palaces in accordance with Your Majesty's benevolent command, we were enjoying the moonlight and the clear stars. In the middle of our rejoicing a sudden gust of fragrant wind blew up, and from it emerged a demon king with golden pupils, a blue face, and green hair, who seized your daughter and carried her away on a magic cloud to a desolate mountain far from human habitation. There was no way I could stop him forcing me to be his wife, and I have had to endure this for thirteen years. I have borne him two fiendish sons, and they are both complete monsters. I would not have written to you and sullied you with the news of my uncivilized and disgraceful experiences, but I was afraid that after my death nobody would know what had happened to me. Just as I was missing my parents and angry about my fate, a Tang monk also happened to be captured by the monster, so with tears in my eyes I am boldly writing this letter and sending it to you as a token of my feelings. I beg you, Majesty, to take pity on me and send a general to the Moon Waters Cave in Bowl Mountain to capture the Yellow-robed Monster, rescue me, and take me back to the palace, this would make me profoundly grateful. Please excuse the hasty and disrespectful tone of this letter.</P>
<P>With more kowtows,</P>
<P>Your disobedient daughter,</P>
<P>Prettier-than-a-flower.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the Grand Scholar had read it through, the king wept aloud, the ladies of the palace were all in tears, and the officials were all saddened. Everyone was miserable.</P>
<P>After weeping for a long time the king asked the civil and military officials which of them would lead troops to capture the monster and rescue Princess Prettier-than-a-flower for him. He asked them all several times, but nobody would accept, the generals looked as though they were carved out of wood, and the officials might have been molded from clay.</P>
<P>The king was highly agitated, and floods of tears were pouring down his face when the civil and military officials all prostrated themselves before him and said, &#8220;Please don't be so disturbed, Your Majesty. The princess has been lost for thirteen years now without anything being heard of her, so we cannot yet know whether she really met this Tang priest and sent a letter by him. Besides, we are all mere mortals, and the military manuals and books of strategy we have studied only cover the deployment of soldiers in battle, making encampments, and what else is necessary to protect the country from the disaster of invasion. That evil spirit travels by cloud and mist, and we would never even be able to catch sight of him, let alone capture him and rescue the Princess. Now that Easterner who is going to fetch scriptures is a holy priest from a great country. This monk must have demon-subduing powers as his 'high qualities overawe the dragons and tigers, and his great virtues give him power over devils and gods.'</P>
<P>&#8220;As the old saying goes, 'The man who comes to argue about rights and wrongs is usually the wrongdoer himself.' Far and away the best plan would be to ask this venerable gentleman to subdue the fiend and rescue the princess.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you have any supernatural skills, venerable sir,&#8221; the king said, turning at once to Sanzang, &#8220;then use your dharma powers to capture this evil monster and bring my daughter back to the palace. If you do that there will be no need to travel to the West and visit the Buddha. You can let your hair grow and I will make you my brother. We shall sit together on the dragon throne and share my wealth and honour. What about it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My only humble skill,&#8221; Sanzang hastened to reply, &#8220;lies in invoking the Buddha's name, and I really cannot subdue fiends.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you can't subdue fiends,&#8221; the king retorted, &#8220;how can you have the courage to go to visit the Buddha in the Western Heaven?&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang now told him about the two disciples as he could not keep them a secret any longer. &#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I could scarcely have come this far by myself. I have two disciples, both skilled at finding ways across mountains and at bridging rivers, who have escorted me here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You have behaved disgracefully, monk,&#8221; said the king angrily. &#8220;As you have disciples, you should have brought them with you to see me. Even if we could have offered them no presents they would have liked, they would at least have been given a meal.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My disciples are so hideous,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;that I dared not bring them to court for fear of offending Your Majesty's dignity.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a monkish thing to say,&#8221; observed the king with a smile. &#8220;You don't really think I would be afraid of them, do you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;The surname of the older one is Pig; his personal names are Wuneng, Awakened to Power, and Bajie, Eight Prohibitions. He has a long snout, vicious fangs, bristles of steel and ears as big as fans. He is so heftily built that he makes a breeze as he walks. The surname of the second disciple is Sand, and his Buddhist name is Monk Awakened to Purity. He is twelve feet tall, and his arms are four feet thick. His face is the color of indigo, and his mouth is like a bowl of blood. His eyes burn and flash, and his teeth are like rows of nails. It was because they both look so terrible that I did not dare bring them with me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Even after you have told me about them,&#8221; said the king, &#8220;I know that I have nothing to fear. Have them summoned here.&#8221; With that a messenger with a golden tablet was sent to the rest-house to invite them to the palace.</P>
<P>On receiving the invitation the idiot said to Friar Sand, &#8220;Brother, do you still think he shouldn't have delivered the letter? Now you can see the advantages of delivering it. I reckon that when the master delivered it, the king must have thought that the person who brought such a message could not be treated rudely and so laid on a banquet for him. As our master has such a weak appetite he must have remembered us and mentioned our names. This is why the messenger was sent here. After a meal we'll be able to make a good start tomorrow.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This must have been in our destiny,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;Let's go.&#8221; Entrusting their baggage and the horse to the manager of the hostel they accompanied the messenger to court; they kept their weapons with them. When they reached the white jade steps they stood below them and chanted a &#8220;na-a-aw&#8221; of respect then stood there without moving. Every one of the civil and military officials was horrified.</P>
<P>&#8220;Apart from being hideous,&#8221; they said to each other, &#8220;they are far too coarse and vulgar. Why are they standing bolt upright after a mere 'na-a-aw' instead of prostrating themselves before His Majesty? Shocking, quite shocking.&#8221;</P>
<P>Overhearing this, pig said, &#8220;Please don't make rude comments on us, gentlemen. This is the way we look, and although we seem ugly at first sight, after a while we become quite bearable.&#8221;</P>
<P>The king, who had been quite frightened at the sight of their brutishness, trembled so violently on hearing the idiot Pig talking that he lost his balance and fell off his dragon throne. Fortunately the gentlemen-in-waiting were on hand to help him up again.</P>
<P>This threw Sanzang into such a panic that he fell to his knees and kowtowed without stopping, saying, &#8220;Your Majesty, I deserve to die ten thousand deaths, ten thousand deaths. I said that my disciples were too hideous for me to dare to bring them to court for fear of harming your dragon dignity, and now I have given Your Majesty this fright.&#8221;</P>
<P>The king walked shakily over to him, raised him to his feet, and said, &#8220;Thank goodness you warned me about them beforehand, venerable sir. Otherwise I would undoubtedly have died of shock at the sight of them.&#8221; When the king had taken some time to calm himself down he asked Pig and Friar Sand which of the two of them was better at subduing fiends.</P>
<P>&#8220;I am,&#8221; said the shameless idiot.</P>
<P>&#8220;How do you do it, pray?&#8221; the king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I am Marshal Tian Peng,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;and I was exiled to this mortal world for offending against part of the Heavenly Code. Happily I have now returned to the truth and become a monk. I am the best fiend-subduer of all of us who have come here from the East.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you are a heavenly general turned mortal,&#8221; said the king, &#8220;you must be good at transformations.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I wouldn't say that much,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;but I can do one or two.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Show me one,&#8221; said the king.</P>
<P>&#8220;Tell me what you want me to turn into,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;Turn into a giant, then,&#8221; said the king.</P>
<P>Pig, who could do thirty-six transformations, now showed off his powers before the steps of the throne. Clenching his fist and reciting the words of the spell he shouted &#8220;Grow!&#8221; bowed forward, and grew eighty or ninety feet tall. He looked like one of the paper gods carried at the head of funeral processions. The civil and military officials trembled with fright; monarch and subjects alike gazed at him in stupefaction.</P>
<P>Then the General Guarding the Palace said, &#8220;You have certainly grown very tall, venerable sir. How much taller could you grow before you had to stop?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It depends on the wind,&#8221; replied the idiot, talking in his idiotic way. &#8220;I can manage quite well in an East or a West wind, and if a South wind blows up I can make a big dent in the sky.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Then give your magic powers a rest,&#8221; said the king, more frightened than ever. &#8220;We are sure you can do that.&#8221; Pig contracted himself to his real size and stood in attendance at the foot of the steps once more.</P>
<P>&#8220;What weapon will you use to fight the monster on this mission?&#8221; the king asked. Pig pulled his rake from his belt and said, &#8220;This rake.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But that would disgrace us,&#8221; said the king with a smile. &#8220;Here we have steel whips, maces, claws on chains, war-hammers, cutlasses, halberds, pole-axes, battle-axes, swords, bills, spears, and battle-scythes. Choose one that suits you&#8212;that rake doesn't count as a real weapon.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What Your Majesty doesn't realize,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;is that although it's crude I've carried it around with me since I was a child. I depended on it completely when I commanded eighty thousand sailors and marines as marshal of the Milky Way, the Heavenly River. Down in this world as my master's escort I've used it to smash the dens of tigers and wolves in the mountains and to turn the nests of dragons and leviathans upside-down in rivers.&#8221;</P>
<P>The king was thoroughly delighted and convinced on hearing this, so he ordered nine of his Royal Consorts to fetch a bottle of his own royal wine with which to send the venerable Pig off; then he filled a goblet and presented it to Pig with the words, &#8220;May this cup of wine, venerable father, express my gratitude for the service you are going to render. When you capture the evil monster and bring back my daughter you will be rewarded with a state banquet and a thousand pieces of gold.&#8221; For all his coarseness the idiot accepted it with style.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; he said to Sanzang after chanting a &#8220;na-a-aw&#8221; of respect, &#8220;you should drink this wine first, but His Majesty gave it to me and I dare not disobey him. Please allow me to drink first as it will brace my spirits for the capture of the monster.&#8221;</P>
<P>He drained the cup in one gulp, refilled it, and handed it to Sanzang, who said, &#8220;As I cannot touch alcohol you two must drink it for me.&#8221; Friar Sand came over and took it. Clouds now sprouted under Pig's feet and he shot up into mid-air.</P>
<P>&#8220;Venerable Pig,&#8221; exclaimed the king, &#8220;you can walk on clouds too!&#8221;</P>
<P>When Pig had gone Friar Sand drained his cup of wine at one draft too and said, &#8220;When the Yellow-robed Monster captured you, master, the pair of us were only just a match for him in combat. I'm afraid that my elder brother won't be able to beat him by himself.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;You'd better go and help him.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Friar Sand too sprang up into the air on a cloud and went off, the anxious king grabbed hold of Sanzang and said, &#8220;Stay here with me, venerable sir. Don't you go flying off on a cloud too.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I, alas, cannot take a single step by cloud.&#8221; We leave the two of them talking to each other in the palace.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm here, brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand as he caught Pig up.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Pig asked. &#8220;The master told me to come and lend you a hand,&#8221; replied Friar Sand.</P>
<P>&#8220;Good, it's as well you've come. We two'll do our damndest and capture this fiend. Even though it won't be anything very big, it'll at least make us famous in this country.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On shimmering clouds they left the country,</P>
<P>Departing from the capital in a blaze of magic light.</P>
<P>On the king's command they came to the mountain cave</P>
<P>To fight hard side by side to capture the evil spirit.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Before long they reached the mouth of the cave and landed their cloud. Pig brought his rake down with all his might on the door of the cave and made a hole the size of a bucket in it. The junior demons guarding it were so frightened that they opened up the gates; at the sight of the pair of them they rushed inside to report, &#8220;Bad news, Your Majesty. The long-snouted monk with big ears and the other one with a horrible face have come back and smashed down our doors.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Pig and Friar Sand again?&#8221; exclaimed the monster in astonishment. &#8220;How dare they come and break down my door after I've spared their master's life?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Perhaps they've come to fetch something they left behind,&#8221; suggested a junior demon.</P>
<P>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; snorted the monster. &#8220;Would they break the gate down if they'd just left something behind?&#8221; He hastily tied on his armor, took his steel sword, went outside and asked, &#8220;Monks, what do you mean by smashing down my door? I spared your master, didn't I?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Will you do a decent thing, wretched ogre?&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;What?&#8221; asked the old monster.</P>
<P>&#8220;You forced the Third Princess of the land of Elephantia to come to your cave,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;and you've made her stay here for thirteen years. You should send her back now. We've come here to capture you on the king's orders, so you'd better hurry in and tie yourself up if you don't want me to hit you.&#8221; The old fiend was now furious. Just watch him as he gnashes his fangs of steel, glares so hard that his eyes become round with fury, raises his sword, and hacks at Pig's head. Pig avoided the blow and struck back at the monster's face with his rake, after which Friar Sand rushed forward to join in the fight with his staff. This battle on the mountain was not the same as the earlier one:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Saying the wrong things can make men angry;</P>
<P>Wicked intentions and hurt feelings give birth to wrath.</P>
<P>The great steel sword of the demon king</P>
<P>Sliced down at the head;</P>
<P>Pig's nine-toothed rake</P>
<P>Went for the face.</P>
<P>As Friar Sand let fly with his staff</P>
<P>The demon king parried with his magic weapon.</P>
<P>One wild ogre,</P>
<P>Two holy monks,</P>
<P>Moving to and fro with the greatest of calm.</P>
<P>One says,</P>
<P>&#8220;You deserve to die for your crime against the country.&#8221;</P>
<P>The other replies,</P>
<P>&#8220;Interfering fellow, trying to put the world to rights.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;By seizing the princess you have insulted the state,&#8221; said the one.</P>
<P>&#8220;Just mind your own business,&#8221; said the other.</P>
<P>It was all because of the letter,</P>
<P>That the monks and the monster were now in combat.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When they had fought eight or nine bouts on the mountain side Pig was beginning to tire; his strength was flagging and he could only raise his rake with difficulty. Do you know why they could not hold out against the monster this time? In the first battle all the guardian gods had been helping Pig and Friar Sand as Sanzang was in the cave, so that they had then been a match for the ogre. This time the guardian gods were all looking after Sanzang in Elephantia, which was why Pig and Friar Sand could not hold out against the fiend.</P>
<P>&#8220;You come forward and fight him, Friar Sand,&#8221; said the idiot, &#8220;while I go off for a shit.&#8221; Then with no further thought for Friar Sand he streaked off into the undergrowth of grass, wild figs, thorns and creepers, diving straight in and not bothering about the scratches on his face. Then he fell into a doze, too frightened to come out again. He kept an ear cocked for the sound of clashing weapons.</P>
<P>Seeing Pig flee, the monster charged at Friar Sand, who could do nothing to stop the ogre from seizing him and carrying him into the cave. The junior fiends tied him up hand and foot. If you don't know what became of him, listen to the explanation in the next chapter.</P>

<p>脱难江流来国土</p>
<p>承恩八戒转山林</p>
</div>
<p>诗曰：妄想不复强灭，真如何必希求？本原自性佛前修，迷悟岂居前后？悟即刹那成正，迷而万劫沉流。若能一念合真修，灭尽恒沙罪垢。却说那八戒、沙僧与怪斗经个三十回合，不分胜负。你道怎么不分胜负？若论赌手段，莫说两个和尚，就是二十个，也敌不过那妖精。只为唐僧命不该死，暗中有那护法神祇保着他，空中又有那六丁六甲、五方揭谛、四值功曹、一十八位护教伽蓝，助着八戒沙僧。</p>

<p>且不言他三人战斗，却说那长老在洞里悲啼，思量他那徒弟，眼中流泪道：“悟能啊，不知你在那个村中逢了善友，贪着斋供！悟净啊，你又不知在那里寻他，可能得会？岂知我遇妖魔，在此受难！几时得会你们，脱了大难，早赴灵山！”正当悲啼烦恼，忽见那洞里走出一个妇人来，扶着定魂桩叫道：“那长老，你从何来？为何被他缚在此处？”长老闻言，泪眼偷看那妇人约有三十年纪，遂道：“女菩萨，不消问了，我已是该死的，走进你家门来也。要吃就吃了罢，又问怎的？”那妇人道：“我不是吃人的。我家离此西下，有三百余里。那里有座城，叫做宝象国。我是那国王的第三个公主，乳名叫做百花羞。只因十三年前八月十五日夜，玩月中间，被这妖魔一阵狂风摄将来，与他做了十三年夫妻。在此生儿育女，杳无音信回朝，思量我那父母，不能相见。你从何来，被他拿住？”唐僧道：“贫僧乃是差往西天取经者，不期闲步，误撞在此。如今要拿住我两个徒弟，一齐蒸吃理。”那公主陪笑道：“长老宽心，你既是取经的，我救得你。那宝象国是你西方去的大路，你与我捎一封书儿去，拜上我那父母，我就教他饶了你罢。”三藏点头道：“女菩萨，若还救得贫僧命，愿做捎书寄信人。”那公主急转后面，即修了一纸家书，封固停当，到桩前解放了唐僧，将书付与。唐僧得解脱，捧书在手道：“女菩萨，多谢你活命之恩。贫僧这一去，过贵处，定送国王处。只恐日久年深，你父母不肯相认，奈何？切莫怪我贫僧打了诳语。”公主道：“不妨，我父王无子，止生我三个姊妹，若见此书，必有相看之意。三藏紧紧袖了家书，谢了公主，就往外走，被公主扯住道：“前门里你出不去！那些大小妖精，都在门外摇旗呐喊，擂鼓筛锣，助着大王，与你徒弟厮杀哩。你往后门里去罢，若是大王拿住，还审问审问；只恐小妖儿捉了，不分好歹，挟生儿伤了你的性命。等我去他面前，说个方便。若是大王放了你啊，待你徒弟讨个示下，寻着你一同好走。”三藏闻言，磕了头，谨依吩咐，辞别公主，躲离后门之外，不敢自行，将身藏在荆棘丛中。</p>

<p>却说公主娘娘，心生巧计，急往前来，出门外，分开了大小群妖，只听得叮叮噹，兵刃乱响，原来是八戒沙僧与那怪在半空里厮杀哩。这公主厉声高叫道：“黄袍郎！”那妖王听得公主叫唤，即丢了八戒沙僧，按落云头，揪了钢刀，搀着公主道：“浑家，有甚话说？”公主道：“郎君啊，我才时睡在罗帏之内，梦魂中，忽见个金甲神人。”妖魔道：“那个金甲神？上我门怎的？”公主道：“是我幼时，在宫里对神暗许下一桩心愿：若得招个贤郎驸马，上名山，拜仙府，斋僧布施。自从配了你，夫妻们欢会，到今不曾题起。那金甲神人来讨誓愿，喝我醒来，却是南柯一梦。</p>

<p>因此，急整容来郎君处诉知，不期那桩上绑着一个僧人，万望郎君慈悯，看我薄意，饶了那个和尚罢，只当与我斋僧还愿，不知郎君肯否？”那怪道：“浑家，你却多心呐！甚么打紧之事。我要吃人，那里不捞几个吃吃？这个把和尚，到得那里，放他去罢。”公主道：“郎君，放他从后门里去罢。”妖魔道：“奈烦哩，放他去便罢，又管他甚么后门前门哩。”他遂绰了钢刀高叫道：</p>

<p>“那猪八戒，你过来。我不是怕你，不与你战，看着我浑家的分上，饶了你师父也。趁早去后门首，寻着他，往西方去罢。若再来犯我境界，断乎不饶！”</p>

<p>那八戒与沙僧闻得此言，就如鬼门关上放回来的一般，即忙牵马挑担，鼠窜而行，转过那波月洞后门之外，叫声“师父！”</p>

<p>那长老认得声音，就在那荆棘中答应。沙僧就剖开草径，搀着师父，慌忙的上马。这里狠毒险遭青面鬼，殷勤幸有百花羞。鳌鱼脱却金钩钓，摆尾摇头逐浪游。</p>

<p>八戒当头领路，沙僧后随，出了那松林，上了大路。你看他两个哜哜嘈嘈，埋埋怨怨，三藏只是解和。遇晚先投宿，鸡鸣早看天，一程一程，长亭短亭，不觉的就走了二百九十九里。猛抬头，只见一座好城，就是宝象国。真好个处所也：云渺渺，路迢迢。地虽千里外，景物一般饶。瑞霭祥烟笼罩，清风明月招摇。</p>

<p>嵂嵂崒崒的远山，大开图画；潺潺湲湲的流水，碎溅琼瑶。可耕的连阡带陌，足食的密蕙新苗。渔钓的几家三涧曲，樵采的一担两峰椒。廓的廓，城的城，金汤巩固；家的家，户的户，只斗逍遥。九重的高阁如殿宇，万丈的层台似锦标。也有那太极殿、华盖殿、烧香殿、观文殿、宣政殿、延英殿，一殿殿的玉陛金阶，摆列着文冠武弁；也有那大明宫、昭阳宫、长乐宫、华清宫、建章宫、未央宫，一宫宫的钟鼓管籥，撒抹了闺怨春愁。也有禁苑的，露花匀嫩脸；也有御沟的，风柳舞纤腰。通衢上，也有个顶冠束带的，盛仪容，乘五马；幽僻中，也有个持弓挟矢的，拨云雾，贯双雕。花柳的巷，管弦的楼，春风不让洛阳桥。取经的长老，回首大唐肝胆裂；伴师的徒弟，息肩小驿梦魂消。看不尽宝象国的景致。师徒三众，收拾行李、马匹，安歇馆驿中。</p>

<p>唐僧步行至朝门外，对阁门大使道：“有唐朝僧人，特来面驾，倒换文牒，乞为转奏转奏。”那黄门奏事官，连忙走至白玉阶前奏道：“万岁，唐朝有个高僧，欲求见驾，倒换文牒。”那国王闻知是唐朝大国，且又说是个方上圣僧，心中甚喜，即时准奏，叫：“宣他进来。”把三藏宣至金阶，舞蹈山呼礼毕。两边文武多官，无不叹道：“上邦人物，礼乐雍容如此！”那国王道：“长老，你到我国中何事？”三藏道：“小僧是唐朝释子，承我天子敕旨，前往西方取经。原领有文牒，到陛下上国，理合倒换。故此不识进退，惊动龙颜。”国王道：“既有唐天子文牒，取上来看。”</p>

<p>三藏双手捧上去，展开放在御案上。牒云：“南赡部洲大唐国奉天承运唐天子牒行：切惟朕以凉德，嗣续丕基，事神治民，临深履薄，朝夕是惴。前者，失救泾河老龙，获谴于我皇皇后帝，三魂七魄，倏忽阴司，已作无常之客。因有阳寿未绝，感冥君放送回生，广陈善会，修建度亡道场。感蒙救苦观世音菩萨，金身出现，指示西方有佛有经，可度幽亡，超脱孤魂。特着法师玄奘，远历千山，询求经偈。倘到西邦诸国，不灭善缘，照牒放行。须至牒者。大唐贞观一十三年，秋吉日，御前文牒。”（上有宝印九颗）国王见了，取本国玉宝，用了花押，递与三藏。</p>

<p>三藏谢了恩，收了文牒，又奏道：“贫僧一来倒换文牒，二来与陛下寄有家书。”国王大喜道：“有甚书？”三藏道：“陛下第三位公主娘娘，被碗子山波月洞黄袍妖摄将去，贫僧偶尔相遇，故寄书来也。”国王闻言，满眼垂泪道：“自十三年前，不见了公主，两班文武官，也不知贬退了多少，宫内宫外，大小婢子太监，也不知打死了多少，只说是走出皇宫，迷失路径，无处找寻，满城中百姓人家，也盘诘了无数，更无下落。怎知道是妖怪摄了去！今日乍听得这句话，故此伤情流泪。”三藏袖中取出书来献上。国王接了，见有平安二字，一发手软，拆不开书，传旨宣翰林院大学士上殿读书。学士随即上殿，殿前有文武多官，殿后有后妃宫女，俱侧耳听书。学士拆开朗诵，上写着：“不孝女百花羞顿首百拜大德父王万岁龙凤殿前，暨三宫母后昭阳宫下，及举朝文武贤卿台次：拙女幸托坤宫，感激劬劳万种，不能竭力怡颜，尽心奉孝。乃于十三年前八月十五日良夜佳辰，蒙父王恩旨着各宫排宴，赏玩月华，共乐清霄盛会。正欢娱之间，不觉一阵香风，闪出个金睛蓝面青发魔王，将女擒住，驾祥光，直带至半野山中无人处，难分难辨，被妖倚强，霸占为妻。</p>

<p>是以无奈捱了一十三年，产下两个妖儿，尽是妖魔之种。论此真是败坏人伦，有伤风化，不当传书玷辱；但恐女死之后，不显分明。正含怨思忆父母，不期唐朝圣僧，亦被魔王擒住。是女滴泪修书，大胆放脱，特托寄此片楮，以表寸心。伏望父王垂悯，遣上将早至碗子山波月洞捉获黄袍怪，救女回朝，深为恩念。草草欠恭，面听不一。逆女百花羞再顿首顿首。’那学士读罢家书，国王大哭，三宫滴泪，文武伤情，前前后后，无不哀念。</p>

<p>国王哭之许久，便问两班文武：“那个敢兴兵领将，与寡人捉获妖魔，救我百花公主？”连问数声，更无一人敢答，真是木雕成的武将，泥塑就的文官。那国王心生烦恼，泪若涌泉。只见那多官齐俯伏奏道：“陛下且休烦恼，公主已失，至今一十三载无音。偶遇唐朝圣僧，寄书来此，未知的否。况臣等俱是凡人凡马，习学兵书武略，止可布阵安营，保国家无侵陵之患。那妖精乃云来雾去之辈，不得与他觌面相见，何以征救？想东土取经者，乃上邦圣僧。这和尚道高龙虎伏，德重鬼神钦，必有降妖之术。自古道，来说是非者，就是是非人。可就请这长老降妖邪，救公主，庶为万全之策。”那国王闻言，急回头便请三藏道：“长老若有手段，放法力，捉了妖魔，救我孩儿回朝，也不须上西方拜佛，长发留头，朕与你结为兄弟，同坐龙床，共享富贵如何？”三藏慌忙启上道：“贫僧粗知念佛，其实不会降妖。”国王道：“你既不会降妖，怎么敢上西天拜佛？”那长老瞒不过，说出两个徒弟来了，奏道：“陛下，贫僧一人，实难到此。贫僧有两个徒弟，善能逢山开路，遇水迭桥，保贫僧到此。”国王怪道：</p>

<p>“你这和尚大没理，既有徒弟，怎么不与他一同进来见朕？若到朝中，虽无中意赏赐，必有随分斋供。”三藏道：“贫僧那徒弟丑陋，不敢擅自入朝，但恐惊伤了陛下的龙体。”国王笑道：“你看你这和尚说话，终不然朕当怕他？”三藏道：“不敢说。我那大徒弟姓猪，法名悟能八戒，他生得长嘴獠牙，刚鬃扇耳，身粗肚大，行路生风。第二个徒弟姓沙，法名悟净和尚，他生得身长丈二，臂阔三停，脸如蓝靛，口似血盆，眼光闪灼，牙齿排钉。他都是这等个模样，所以不敢擅领入朝。”国王道：“你既这等样说了一遍，寡人怕他怎的？宣进来。”随即着金牌至馆驿相请。</p>

<p>那呆子听见来请，对沙僧道：“兄弟，你还不教下书哩，这才见了下书的好处。想是师父下了书，国王道：捎书人不可怠慢，一定整治筵宴待他。他的食肠不济，有你我之心，举出名来，故此着金牌来请。大家吃一顿，明日好行。”沙僧道：“哥啊，知道是甚缘故，我们且去来。”遂将行李马匹俱交付驿丞，各带随身兵器，随金牌入朝。早行到白玉阶前，左右立下，朝上唱个喏，再也不动。那文武多官，无人不怕，都说道：“这两个和尚，貌丑也罢，只是粗俗太甚！怎么见我王更不下拜，喏毕平身，挺然而立，可怪可怪！”八戒听见道：“列位，莫要议论，我们是这般。乍看果有些丑，只是看下些时来，却也耐看。”</p>

<p>那国王见他丑陋，已是心惊，及听得那呆子说出话来，越发胆颤，就坐不稳，跌下龙床，幸有近侍官员扶起。慌得个唐僧跪在殿前，不住的叩头道：“陛下，贫僧该万死万死！我说徒弟丑陋，不敢朝见，恐伤龙体，果然惊了驾也。”那国王战兢兢走近前，搀起道：“长老，还亏你先说过了；若未说，猛然见他，寡人一定唬杀了也！”国王定性多时，便问：“猪长老沙长老，是那一位善于降妖？”那呆子不知好歹，答道：“老猪会降。”国王道：</p>

<p>“怎么家降？”八戒道：“我乃是天蓬元帅，只因罪犯天条，堕落下世，幸今皈正为僧。自从东土来此，第一会降妖的是我。”国王道：“既是天将临凡，必然善能变化。”八戒道：“不敢，不敢，也将就晓得几个变化儿。”国王道：“你试变一个我看看。”八戒道：“请出题目，照依样子好变。”国王道：“变一个大的罢。”那八戒他也有三十六般变化，就在阶前卖弄手段，却便捻诀念咒，喝一声叫“长！”把腰一躬，就长了有八九丈长，却似个开路神一般。吓得那两班文武，战战兢兢；一国君臣，呆呆挣挣。时有镇殿将军问道：“长老，似这等变得身高，必定长到甚么去处，才有止极？”那呆子又说出呆话来道：“看风，东风犹可，西风也将就；若是南风起，把青天也拱个大窟窿！”那国王大惊道：“收了神通罢，晓得是这般变化了。”八戒把身一矬，依然现了本相，侍立阶前。国王又问道：“长老此去，有何兵器与他交战？”八戒腰里掣出钯来道：“老猪使的是钉钯。”国王笑道：“可败坏门面！我这里有的是鞭简瓜锤，刀枪钺斧，剑戟矛镰，随你选称手的拿一件去。那钯算做甚么兵器？”八戒道：“陛下不知，我这钯，虽然粗夯，实是自幼随身之器。曾在天河水府为帅，辖押八万水兵，全仗此钯之力。今临凡世，保护吾师，逢山筑破虎狼窝，遇水掀翻龙蜃穴，皆是此钯。”国王闻得此言，十分欢喜心信。即命九嫔妃子：“将朕亲用的御酒，整瓶取来，权与长老送行。”遂满斟一爵，奉与八戒道：“长老，这杯酒聊引奉劳之意。待捉得妖魔，救回小女，自有大宴相酬，千金重谢。”那呆子接杯在手，人物虽是粗鲁，行事倒有斯文，对三藏唱个大喏道：</p>

<p>“师父，这酒本该从你饮起，但君王赐我，不敢违背，让老猪先吃了，助助兴头，好捉妖怪。”那呆子一饮而干，才斟一爵，递与师父。三藏道：“我不饮酒，你兄弟们吃罢。”沙僧近前接了。八戒就足下生云，直上空里，国王见了道：“猪长老又会腾云！”呆子去了，沙僧将酒亦一饮而干，道：“师父！那黄袍怪拿住你时，我两个与他交战，只战个手平。今二哥独去，恐战不过他。”三藏道：“正是，徒弟啊，你可去与他帮帮功。”沙僧闻言，也纵云跳将起去。那国王慌了，扯住唐僧道：“长老，你且陪寡人坐坐，也莫腾云去了。”唐僧道：“可怜可怜！我半步儿也去不得！”此时二人在殿上叙话不题。</p>

<p>却说那沙僧赶上八戒道：“哥哥，我来了。”八戒道：“兄弟，你来怎的？”沙僧道：“师父叫我来帮帮功的。”八戒大喜道：“说得是，来得好。我两个努力齐心，去捉那怪物，虽不怎的，也在此国扬扬姓名。”你看他：叆叇祥光辞国界，氤氲瑞气出京城。</p>

<p>领王旨意来山洞，努力齐心捉怪灵。他两个不多时，到了洞口，按落云头。八戒掣钯，往那波月洞的门上，尽力气一筑，把他那石门筑了斗来大小的个窟窿。吓得那把门的小妖开门，看见是他两个，急跑进去报道：“大王，不好了！那长嘴大耳的和尚，与那晦气脸的和尚，又来把门都打破了！”那怪惊道：“这个还是猪八戒、沙和尚二人。我饶了他师父，怎么又敢复来打我的门！”小妖道：“想是忘了甚么物件，来取的。”老怪咄的一声道：</p>

<p>“胡缠！忘了物件，就敢打上门来？必有缘故！”急整束了披挂，绰了钢刀，走出来问道：“那和尚，我既饶了你师父，你怎么又敢来打上我门？”八戒道：“你这泼怪干得好事儿！”老魔道：“甚么事？”八戒道：“你把宝象国三公主骗来洞内，倚强霸占为妻，住了一十三载，也该还他了。我奉国王旨意，特来擒你。你快快进去，自家把绳子绑缚出来，还免得老猪动手！”那老怪闻言，十分发怒。你看他屹迸迸，咬响钢牙；滴溜溜，睁圆环眼；雄纠纠，举起刀来；赤淋淋，拦头便砍。八戒侧身躲过，使钉钯劈面迎来，随后又有沙僧举宝杖赶上前齐打。这一场在山头上赌斗，比前不同，真个是：言差语错招人恼，意毒情伤怒气生。这魔王大钢刀，着头便砍；那八戒九齿钯，对面来迎。沙悟净丢开宝杖，那魔王抵架神兵。一猛怪，二神僧，来来往往甚消停。这个说：“你骗国理该死罪！”那个说：“你罗闲事报不平！”这个说：“你强婚公主伤国体！”那个说：“不干你事莫闲争！”算来只为捎书故，致使僧魔两不宁。他们在那山坡前，战经八九个回合，八戒渐渐不济将来，钉钯难举，气力不加。你道如何这等战他不过？当时初相战斗，有那护法诸神，为唐僧在洞，暗助八戒沙僧，故仅得个手平；此时诸神都在宝象国护定唐僧，所以二人难敌。那呆子道：“沙僧，你且上前来与他斗着，让老猪出恭来。”他就顾不得沙僧，一溜往那蒿草薜萝，荆棘葛藤里，不分好歹，一顿钻进，那管刮破头皮，搠伤嘴脸，一毂辘睡倒，再也不敢出来，但留半边耳朵，听着梆声。那怪见八戒走了，就奔沙僧。沙僧措手不及，被怪一把抓住，捉进洞去，小妖将沙僧四马攒蹄捆住。毕竟不知端的性命如何，且听下回分解。</p>
