<P>Sanzang Does Not Forget the Basic</P>
<P>The Four Holy Ones Have Their Piety Tested</P>
	</div>





<P>Long is the road as they travel West;</P>
<P>In the rustling autumn breeze the frost-killed flowers fall.</P>
<P>The cunning ape is firmly chained&#8212;do not untie him;</P>
<P>The wicked horse is tightly reined&#8212;don't whip him on.</P>
<P>The Mother of Wood and Father of Metal were originally combined;</P>
<P>Between the Yellow Mother and the Red Babe there was no difference.</P>
<P>When the iron pill is bitten open, truth is revealed;</P>
<P>The Prajna-paramita has reached that person.</P>


<P>Although this book is about the journey to fetch the scriptures, it never leaves the subject of how the individual strives for the basic. The four of them, having understood the truth, shaken off the chains of the mortal world, and leapt away from the flowing sands of the sea of nature, headed along the main road West free of all impediment. They crossed blue mountains and green rivers, and saw no end of wild flowers. The time flew by, and before long it was autumn. They saw:</P>


<P>Hills covered with red maple leaves,</P>
<P>Yellow chrysanthemums braving the evening breeze,</P>
<P>Aging cicadas singing with less vigor,</P>
<P>Autumn crickets longing for the days of plenty.</P>


<P>The lotus was losing its green silken leaves,</P>
<P>The fragrant orange tree was massed with golden globes.</P>
<P>Lines of wild geese, alas,</P>
<P>Spread out like dots across the distant sky.</P>


<P>As they were travelling along one day, evening drew in, and Sanzang said, &#8220;Where are we going to sleep, disciples, now that it's getting late?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's not the right thing to say, master,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;We monks are supposed to eat the wind and drink the rain, and sleep under the moon and in the frost. Our home is wherever we are. So why ask where we're going to sleep?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You may think that you've had an easy journey,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;but you don't give a damn about other people being tired. Ever since we crossed the Flowing Sands River we've been going over mountain ranges, and this heavy load has fairly worn me out. We've got to find a house where we can beg some tea and food and have a good rest&#8212;it's only fair.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It sounds to me, idiot, as though you're having regrets,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'm afraid you can't have such an easy life now as you did back in Gao Village. If you want to be a monk, you have to suffer&#8212;it's the only way of being a true disciple.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How heavy do you think this load is?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I haven't carried it since you and Friar Sand joined us, so how should I know?&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Just add it up,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;There are</P>


<P>Four bundles wrapped in yellow bamboo mats,</P>
<P>Eight ropes of assorted lengths.</P>
<P>Then, to keep out rain and damp,</P>
<P>Three or four layers of felt around it</P>
<P>The carrying-pole is terrible slippery</P>
<P>With nails at either end.</P>
<P>Then there's a bronze and iron nine-ringed staff</P>
<P>And a cape made of bamboo and creeper.</P>


<P>With all this luggage to carry day after day of course I find the going heavy. While you're allowed to be the master's disciple, I'm treated as a hired hand.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Who do you think you're talking to, idiot?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm talking to you, elder brother,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;You shouldn't be complaining about this to me,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;My job is to look after the master's safety, while you and Friar Sand look after the horse and the luggage. And if there's any slacking from you, you'll feel a heavy stick about you ankles.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't threaten me with a beating, brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;that would be bullying. I know that you're too high and mighty to carry the luggage, but the master's horse is a big, sturdy animal to be carrying only one old monk. I'd be very happy if it could carry a few pieces of luggage.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do you think he's a horse?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;He's no ordinary horse. He was the son of Ao Run, the Dragon King of the Western Sea, and his name is Prince Dragon-horse. Because he burnt the palace pearls his father reported on him as an offender against the Heavenly Code. Luckily for him, his life saved by the Bodhisattva Guanyin, and he waited a long time for the master in the Eagle's Sorrow Gorge. He was honoured by another visit from the Bodhisattva, who took off his scales and horns, removed the pearls from under his neck, and turned him into this horse, which has sworn to carry the master to the Western Heaven to visit the Buddha. This is a matter of him winning merit for himself, so you'd better leave him alone.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Is he really a dragon?&#8221; asked Friar Sand when he heard this.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;I've heard an old saying,&#8221; Pig remarked, &#8220;that dragons can breathe out clouds, make the dust and sand fly, pull mountain ranges up by their roots, and turn oceans upside down. How is it that he's moving so slowly now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you want to see him go fast,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;I'll make him go fast for you.&#8221; The splendid Great Sage gripped his iron cudgel, and countless luminous clouds sprang from it. When the horse saw him grab the cudgel he thought he was going to be hit with it, and in his terror he shot off at the speed of lightning. Sanzang was too weak to rein him in as the equine dashed up the mountainside for all his evil nature was worth before he slackened his pace. When Sanzang began to get his breath back, he looked up and saw some fine houses in the shade of a bamboo grove:</P>


<P>Cypresses were bending over the gates</P>
<P>Of the houses near the blue mountain.</P>
<P>There were several spreading pines</P>
<P>And some molded bamboo.</P>
<P>Wild chrysanthemum outside the fence, beautiful in the frost;</P>
<P>The orchid by the bridge reflected red in the water.</P>
<P>A whitewashed, plastered wall</P>
<P>Surrounded it.</P>
<P>Handsome was the lofty hall,</P>
<P>Peaceful the main building.</P>
<P>There was no sign of oxen or sheep, or chickens, or dogs;</P>
<P>It seemed to be the slack season after harvest.</P>


<P>Sanzang stopped the horse to take a longer look, and then he saw Monkey and the others arrive. &#8220;You didn't fall off the horse, master?&#8221; asked Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;You gave this horse a terrible fright, you filthy ape,&#8221; Sanzang said, &#8220;but I kept my seat.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't tell me off, master,&#8221; said Monkey, putting on a smile. &#8220;It was only because Pig said the horse was going too slowly that I made him speed up a bit.&#8221;</P>
<P>The blockhead Pig, who had been running quite fast after the horse, was puffing and panting as he mumbled, &#8220;Enough of this. When you're bent double you can't relax. Although I'm carrying a load so heavy I can't pick it up, you make me go running after the horse.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;do you see the farm over there? Let's ask if we can spend the night there.&#8221; Monkey immediately looked up, saw that the sky above it was full of clouds of blessing, and knew that the farm had been miraculously produced by the Buddha or some Immortals.</P>
<P>Not daring to give away the secrets of Heaven, however, he only said, &#8220;Splendid, splendid, let's ask if we can lodge there.&#8221; Dismounting from his horse, Sanzang saw a gate-house with pillars like elephants' trunks and beams that had been painted and carved.</P>
<P>Friar Sand put down the carrying-pole and Pig said as he held the horse, &#8220;This is a very wealthy house.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey was on the point of going in when Sanzang said, &#8220;No, we men of religion should avoid incurring suspicion. You mustn't go charging in. We should wait till somebody comes out and then ask politely for lodging.&#8221; Pig tethered the horse at the sloping base of the wall while Sanzang sat on a stone stool, and Friar Sand and Monkey sat beside the steps. When nobody appeared for a long time Monkey jumped up impatiently and went through the gate to have a look. He saw a large hall facing South whose tall windows were shaded with bamboo curtains. Over the doorway dividing the inner and outer parts of the house was a horizontal landscape painting symbolizing long life and blessings, and on the gold-painted columns flanking the door was pasted a pair of scrolls reading:</P>


<P>&#8220;The tender willow leaves sway in the evening by the bridge;</P>
<P>When the plum-blossom looks like snowflakes it is spring in the courtyard.</P>


<P>In the middle of the room was an incense table whose black lacquer had been polished, an ancient animal-shaped bronze incense-burner standing on it, and six chairs. Pictures of the four seasons were hung on the walls at either end of the hall.</P>
<P>As Monkey was peeping inside he heard footsteps from behind the door at the back. A woman, neither old nor young, came out, and asked in a charming voice, &#8220;Who has forced his way into this widow's house of mine?&#8221;</P>
<P>The Great Sage hastened to greet her respectfully and say, &#8220;I<I></I> am a humble monk from the Great Tang in the East, under imperial orders to go to the West to worship the Buddha and ask for the scriptures. There are four of us altogether, and since our journey has brought us this way as evening is drawing in, we have come to your mansion, divine patroness, to beg for a night's lodging.&#8221;</P>
<P>She returned his greeting with a smile and said, &#8220;Where are the other three gentlemen, venerable sir?&#8221; at which Monkey shouted, &#8220;Master, come in.&#8221; Sanzang, Pig and Friar Sand then came in, bringing the horse and the luggage with them. As the woman came out of the hall to welcome them, Pig stole a glance at her with greedy eyes.</P>


<P>She wore a green silk gown,</P>
<P>And over it a pale red jacket;</P>
<P>A skirt of yellow brocade,</P>
<P>Below which showed thick-soled shoes.</P>
<P>Her fashionable coiffure was veiled in black,</P>
<P>Which suited her graying locks, coiled like a dragon;</P>
<P>Palace-style ivory combs shone with red and green,</P>
<P>And two golden pins adorned her hair.</P>
<P>Her half-grey tresses soared like a phoenix in flight,</P>
<P>Two rows of pearls hung from her ear-rings.</P>
<P>Free of powder and paint, her beauty was natural;</P>
<P>She was as attractive as a younger girl.</P>


<P>When she saw the three others she was more pleased than ever, and she invited them into the main room. When all the introductions had been made, she asked them to sit down and have some tea. A servant girl with her hair in plaits came in through the door leading to the back of the house; she was carrying a golden tray on which were set white jade cups of steaming hot tea as well as exotic fruits that smelt delicious. Her sleeves were wide, and with her fingers as slender as bamboo shoots in spring she handed each of them a jade bowl and bowed. When the tea had been drunk, the mistress ordered a meatless meal to be prepared.</P>
<P>&#8220;What is your name, venerable Bodhisattva?&#8221; asked Sanzang, spreading out his hands. &#8220;And what is this place called?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is the Western Continent of Cattle-gift, or Godaniya,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;My maiden name is Jia and my husband's name was Mo. In my childhood I had the misfortune of losing both my parents, and I married to continue the ancestral enterprise. Our family is worth ten thousand strings of cash, and we own fifteen thousand acres of good arable land. We were not fated to be given sons, and we only had three daughters. The year before last I suffered the great misfortune of losing my husband. I have remained a widow, and this year I have come out of mourning. There are no other relations to inherit the family estate besides myself and my daughters. I would like to remarry, but not at the price of abandoning the estate. Now that you have come here, venerable sir, with your three disciples, I think it should be you. I and my three daughters want to marry while staying at home, and you four gentlemen would suit us nicely. I wonder if you would be prepared to consent.&#8221; Sanzang sat there pretending to be deaf and dumb, with his eyes shut and his mind kept calm. He made no reply.</P>
<P>&#8220;We have over four thousand acres each of irrigated land, dry land, and orchards on hillsides,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;as well as over a thousand head of oxen and water buffalo, herds of mules and horses, and more pigs and sheep than you could count. There are sixty or seventy farm buildings and barns. We have more grain in the house than we could eat in eight or nine years, and more than enough silk to clothe us for a decade&#8212;to say nothing of more gold and silver than you could spend in a lifetime. You'll be even better off than those ancients who 'stored spring behind brocade curtains' and kept girls whose 'hair was heavy with golden pins'. If you and your disciples are prepared to change your minds and live in this house as our husbands, you can enjoy wealth and ease. Wouldn't that be better than a difficult journey to the West?&#8221; Sanzang sat there silent, as if he were an imbecile.</P>
<P>&#8220;I was born at the hour<I> you</I> of the third day of the third month of the year<I> dinghai, &#8221;</I>she continued. &#8220;My late husband was three years older than me, and I am now forty-four. My eldest daughter, Zhenzhen, is nineteen; my second, Aiai is seventeen; and Lianlian, the youngest, is fifteen. None of them have been betrothed. Although I am rather ugly myself, the girls are all quite good-looking, and they have all the feminine accomplishments. As my late husband had no sons, he gave them a boy's education, teaching them to read the Confucian classics from an early age and training them to recite poems and make couplets. Although they live in this mountain farmhouse you couldn't consider them boorish, and I think that they would be good partners for all you reverend gentlemen. If you are willing to broaden your outlook and let your hair grow, you could be head of the family and wear silks and brocades. Wouldn't that be far better than your earthenware begging-bowl, rough clothes, straw sandals, and rain-hats?&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang sat in the place of honour as still as a child terrified by thunder or a toad soaked in a rainstorm. He seemed to be in a trance as he leant back with his eyes turned up towards the sky. Pig, however, felt an itch in his mind that was hard to scratch when he heard about all this wealth and beauty. He fidgeted on his chair as if needles were being stuck into his backside, and finally could bear it no longer.</P>
<P>He went up to his master, tugged at his clothes, and said, &#8220;Master, why are you paying no attention to what the lady is saying? You really ought to take some notice.&#8221; Sanzang glared at him angrily, made a furious noise, and shouted at him to go away.</P>
<P>&#8220;Evil beast,&#8221; he said, &#8220;We are men of religion. It's disgraceful to allow yourself to be moved by the thought of wealth, honour or sex.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Poor, poor things,&#8221; said the woman with a smile. &#8220;What good can there be in being men of religion?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What good can there be in being of the world, Bodhisattva?&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Please sit down, reverend sir, while I tell you about the advantages of being in the world,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There is a poem to describe them that goes:</P>


<P>In spring we cut out linked diamond patterns and wear new silk;</P>
<P>In summer we change to light gauze and admire the lotus;</P>
<P>In autumn comes meat and delicious rice-wine,</P>
<P>In winter the house is warm, and our faces are red with drink.</P>


<P>We have all that's needed in the four seasons,</P>
<P>The treasures and delicacies of the whole year.</P>
<P>Brocade clothes, silken sheets and a wedding night</P>
<P>Are better than plodding along and worshipping Maitreya.&#8221;</P>


<P>&#8220;Bodhisattva,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;it is, of course, very good to enjoy wealth and honour with plenty of food and clothes and a family. But what you don't realize is that the religious life has advantages, which are described in this poem:</P>


<P>It is no light matter to decide to enter religion:</P>
<P>You have to demolish the love and gratitude you felt before.</P>
<P>Externals are created no longer, and your mouth is tightly shut.</P>
<P>Negative and positive exist within your body.</P>


<P>When all has been achieved, you face the golden gates;</P>
<P>See your nature, clarify your mind, and return home.</P>
<P>This is better than staying in the world to be greedy for blood and food</P>
<P>While your stinking flesh grows aged and decrepit.&#8221;</P>


<P>&#8220;You insolent monk,&#8221; the woman said in great anger. &#8220;If it weren't for the fact that you've come a long, long way from the East. I'd drive you out of my house. I invite you four with all sincerity to marry us and enjoy our wealth, and you repay my kindness with insults. If you have accepted the prohibitions and made your vows, you could at least let me have one of your underlings as a son-in-law. Why are you being such a stickler for the rules?&#8221;</P>
<P>As she had lost her temper, Sanzang had to soothe her, so he said, &#8220;Monkey, you stay here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've never been able to do that sort of thing,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why not let Pig stay?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop teasing, elder brother,&#8221; Pig said. &#8220;We should all decide what's the best thing to do.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If neither of you will stay, I must ask Friar Sand to stay,&#8221; said Sanzang; but Friar Sand replied, &#8220;What a thing to say, master. I was converted by the Bodhisattva, agreed to obey the prohibitions, and waited till you came, and since taking me as your disciple you've taught me more. I haven't been with you for two months yet, and I've had no time to win any merit at all. How could I possibly want wealth and position? I want to go to the Western Heaven even if it costs me my life, and I'm certainly not going to frustrate my hopes by doing that.&#8221; In the face of their refusals the woman turned round, went out through the door leading to the back of the house, and slammed it behind her, leaving master and disciples outside with neither food nor tea. Nobody else came out to see them.</P>
<P>&#8220;That's not the way to handle things, master,&#8221; grumbled an angry Pig. &#8220;You should have been more flexible and given her some noncommittal answer, then you'd have got some food out of her. That way we'd have eaten well tonight, but would still have been able to refuse to marry them in the morning. We're going to have a lousy night with nothing to eat if that inside door is shut and nobody comes out to us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother Pig, you should stay here and marry one of the girls,&#8221; said Friar Sand.</P>
<P>&#8220;Lay off me,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;We must decide what's the best thing to do.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why bother?&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;If you want to marry one of them, you'll make our master and the woman in-laws, and you can be a husband living with his in-laws. A family as rich as this is bound to give a good dowry, as well as a feast for relations which will do us all a bit of good. So it's in all our interests for you to return to worldly life here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It sounds all right,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;but it would mean going back to the world after leaving it, and marrying again after ending another marriage.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Did you have a wife before, then?&#8221; asked Friar Sand.</P>
<P>&#8220;So you still don't know,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;that he used to be the son-in-law of Squire Gao in Gao Village in the land of Stubet. After I defeated him and the Bodhisattva converted him and made him promise to observe the prohibitions, we managed to force him to become a monk. So he left his wife and joined our master for the journey to the Buddha in the West. I think that now he's been away from her for so long he's remembering all that business again. When he heard this woman's offer, it revived his old ideas. Blockhead,&#8221; he continued, addressing Pig, &#8220;marry into this family as a son-in-law. I won't report on you provided you bow to me a few times.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Nonsense, Nonsense,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;You've all been thinking the same thoughts, but you pick on me to make an exhibition of. It's always said that 'a monk among pretty women is a hungry ghost,' and that goes for all of us. But by acting so high and mighty you've ruined our chances of doing well here. We haven't cast our eyes on so much as a cup of tea, and there isn't even anyone to light the lamps for us. We may be able to stick it out for a night, but that horse will have to carry our master again tomorrow, and if he gets nothing to eat all night he'll collapse. You lot sit here while I take him out for a feed.&#8221; He untied the animal and dragged it out in a great hurry, at which Monkey said, &#8220;Friar Sand, you sit here with the master while I follow him and see where he pastures that horse.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you want to keep an eye on him, you may do so,&#8221; Sanzang said, &#8220;but don't play any tricks on him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; said Monkey, and as he went out of the room he shook himself, turned into a red dragonfly, flew out of the main gate, and caught up with Pig.</P>
<P>Instead of letting the horse eat what grass there was, the blockhead chivied and dragged it round to the back door of the house, where he saw the woman and her three daughters admiring some chrysanthemums. When they saw Pig coming, the three girls rushed inside, while their mother remained standing in front of him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you going, reverend sir?&#8221; she asked. The idiot dropped the horse's bridle, greeted her respectfully, and said, &#8220;I'm pasturing the horse, mother.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That master of yours is too prim and proper,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Wouldn't you rather marry here than go on plodding West as a travelling monk?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They're under orders from the Tang Emperor,&#8221; Pig replied with a grin, &#8220;and are too scared of disobeying him to do a thing like this. When they put the pressure on me in the hall just now I was in a very awkward spot. I hope you don't mind about my long snout and big ears.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I don't mind,&#8221; she said, &#8220;as long as we can have a man about the house, though my girls might not find you very attractive.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Tell your girls not to be so particular about a husband,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;That Tang Priest may be very handsome, but he's completely useless. Although I'm as ugly as they come, I have something to say for myself.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What would that be?&#8221; she asked. His reply was:</P>


<P>&#8220;I may be not much to look at,</P>
<P>But I certainly get things done.</P>
<P>Fifteen thousand acres</P>
<P>I can plough without an ox.</P>
<P>Just by using my rake</P>
<P>I plant crops that come up well.</P>
<P>I can summon rain in a drought,</P>
<P>Call up a wind when there's none.</P>
<P>If you find your house too small,</P>
<P>I can add two more stories, or three.</P>
<P>If the ground needs sweeping, I'll sweep it;</P>
<P>If the ditches are blocked, I'll make them run.</P>
<P>I can do all sorts of household jobs.</P>
<P>And perform miscellaneous duties in the home.&#8221;</P>


<P>&#8220;Very well then,&#8221; she said, &#8220;if you can manage the work about the place you'd better go and talk it over with your master. If there are no problems, then you can marry one of the girls.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no need to talk it over with him,&#8221; Pig said. &#8220;He's not my father or mother, and it's entirely up to me whether I do it or not.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well then,&#8221; she said, &#8220;Wait while I tell the girls.&#8221; With that she went in and shut the door behind her. Pig still did not let the horse graze but dragged it round towards the front of the house.</P>
<P>Unbeknown to him, Monkey, who knew all about what had happened, flew back, changed back into his own form, and said to the Tang Priest, &#8220;Master, Pig is leading the horse back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If he hadn't led it, it might have got excited and run away,&#8221; Sanzang said, at which Monkey burst out laughing and told him all about what had taken place between Pig and the woman. Sanzang did not know whether to believe him or not. A moment later the blockhead led the horse in and tethered it.</P>
<P>&#8220;Have you grazed the horse?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I couldn't find any grass that was good enough,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;so I couldn't graze it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You may not have been able to graze the horse,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;but you managed do some horse-trading.&#8221; This jibe made the idiot realize that the cat was out of the bag, so he hung his head and did not say a word. There was a creak as a side door opened and the woman and her three daughters&#8212;Zhenzhen, Aiai and Lianlian&#8212;came in with a pair of lamps glowing red and two portable incense burners from which sweet-smelling smoke curled up as the jade ornaments at their waists tinkled. The three girls greeted the pilgrims, standing in a row in the middle of the room and bowing. They were undoubtedly beauties:</P>


<P>All had moth-eyebrows glistening blue,</P>
<P>Pale and spring-like faces.</P>
<P>Seductive beauties who could tumble kingdoms,</P>
<P>Disturbing men's hearts with their quiet charm.</P>
<P>Elegant were their ornaments of golden flowers;</P>
<P>Their embroidered sashes floated above the worldly dust.</P>
<P>Their half-smile was a bursting cherry;</P>
<P>Their breath was perfumed as they walked with slow steps.</P>
<P>Their hair was covered with pearls and jade.</P>
<P>Trembling under countless jeweled ornaments;</P>
<P>Their whole bodies were fragrant,</P>
<P>Covered with delicate flowers of gold.</P>
<P>Why mention the beauty of the woman of Chu,</P>
<P>Or the charms of Xi Zi?</P>
<P>They really were like fairies from the Ninth Heaven,</P>
<P>Or the Lady of the Moon coming out of her palace.</P>


<P>While Sanzang put his hands together and bowed his head the Great Sage pretended not to notice and Friar Sand turned away. But Pig gazed at them with a fixed stare, his mind seething with lewd thoughts as his lust overwhelmed him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Thank you, divine angels, for coming to see us,&#8221; he said, fidgeting, &#8220;but could you ask the girls to go, please, mother?&#8221; The three girls went out through the door, leaving a pair of gauze-shielded lanterns behind them.</P>
<P>&#8220;Will you four reverend gentlemen please decide which of you is to marry one of the girls?&#8221; the woman said.</P>
<P>&#8220;We've already made up our minds that Mr. Pig is to be your son-in-law,&#8221; Friar Sand replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't pick on me, brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;we should discuss this together.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No need to,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;You've already fixed everything up at the back door and called her 'mother,' so there's nothing to discuss. Our master can represent the groom's family, this lady is the bride's family, I can be best man, and Friar Sand can be the matchmaker. There's no need to bother with the usual exchange of letters, and today is a most auspicious one full of heavenly grace, so bow to the master and go in to be her son-in-law.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Impossible,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;impossible. I couldn't do a thing like that.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop trying to cover up, blockhead,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;You've already called her 'mother' umpteen times: there's nothing impossible about it at all. Hurry up and fulfil your promise so that we can have some wedding wine, which will be one good thing about it.&#8221; Seizing Pig with one hand and grabbing the woman with the other he said, &#8220;As the bride's mother, you should take your son-in-law inside.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot Pig hesitated, wanting to go in, and the woman said to the servants, &#8220;Bring table and chairs and give these three relatives of ours a meatless supper. I'm taking our son-in-law inside.&#8221; Then she told the cooks to prepare a banquet for their friends and relations the following morning. The servants did as they were told, and the other three pilgrims ate their supper, spread their bedding, and went to sleep in their places.</P>
<P>Pig followed his mother-in-law inside, and as he lost count of the number of rooms he went through, constantly tripping over the thresholds. &#8220;Don't go so fast, mother,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and please guide me as I don't know the way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;These are all granaries, storehouses, and milling rooms,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We haven't reached the kitchens yet.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What an enormous house,&#8221; said Pig, as he went round many a corner, tripping and bumping into things, until he reached the inner apartments of the house.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your brother said that today was a very auspicious day,&#8221; the woman said, &#8220;which is why I've brought you inside. But as we're doing things in such a rush, I haven't had time to call in a fortune-teller or arrange a proper ceremony with the scattering of fruit. You must just bow eight times, and that will have to do.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;A good idea, mother,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;You sit in the seat of honour and I'll bow to you a few times&#8212;that can be the wedding ceremony and thanking the bride's family rolled into one, which will save trouble.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well then,&#8221; said the woman with a laugh. &#8220;You are a most capable and practical son-in-law. I'll sit here while you bow to me.&#8221;</P>
<P>In the room glittering with silver candles the blockhead bowed to her, then asked which of the girls would be married to him. &#8220;That's the problem,&#8221; his mother-in-law said. &#8220;If I give you the eldest, the second one will be upset; and if I give you the second one, I'm afraid the third one will be; and if I give you the third, the eldest will be&#8212;so I haven't decided yet.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If there's any danger of them quarrelling,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;then give me all of them, to save the family from being troubled with arguments and squabbles.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a suggestion,&#8221; his mother-in-law exclaimed. &#8220;You're certainly not having all my daughters to yourself.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be silly, mother. What's unusual about three or four wives? Even if there were several more of them, I'd take them on with a smile. When I was young I learned the art of 'protracted warfare,' and I can guarantee to keep every one of them happy.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; the woman said. &#8220;I have a handkerchief here. Tie it round your head to cover your face, and we can let Heaven decide which one you'll marry. I'll tell the girls to walk in front of you while you stretch your arms out. The one you catch, will be yours.&#8221; The blockhead obediently tied the handkerchief round his head, and there is a verse to prove it:</P>


<P>The fool, not knowing his own fate,</P>
<P>Was wounded by the sword of sex as he harmed himself in secret</P>
<P>There have always been proper wedding rites,</P>
<P>But today the groom blindfolded himself.</P>


<P>When he had tied the handkerchief on firmly, the idiot said, &#8220;Mother, please ask the girls to come out.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Zhenzhen, Aiai, Lianlian,&#8221; she called, &#8220;come out to see which of you Heaven will marry to my new son-in-law.&#8221; He heard the tinkling of jade ornaments and smelt rare perfumes as if fairies were there, so he reached out to grab one. He groped about to his left and his right, but without success. There were so many girls running about, and he had no chance of catching one. When he stretched East he only put his arms round a pillar, and when he stretched West he felt only the wall. As he rushed from one end of the room to the other he felt so dizzy that he lost his balance and kept tripping over. He stumbled into the door when he went forward, and collided with the brick wall when he went back, bumping, crashing and falling over till his snout was swollen and his head blue with bruises. Finally he sat on the floor and said as he gasped for breath, &#8220;Mother, your daughters are so slippery I can't catch a single one of them. Whatever shall I do?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They're not slippery,&#8221; she said, taking off the handkerchief, &#8220;they're all too shy to marry you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If they won't marry me,&#8221; Pig said, &#8220;then you marry me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a son-in-law!&#8221; she said. &#8220;He doesn't care whether they're young or old&#8212;he even wants his own mother-in-law. Now each of these clever girls of mine has made a brocade shirt sewn with pearls. I'll tell whichever girl it is whose shirt you put on to marry you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Great, great, great,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;Bring out all three shirts for me to try on, and if I can get them all on, I'll marry them all.&#8221; The woman went back inside, and brought out only one shirt, which she handed to Pig. The idiot took off his own black cloth tunic and pulled on the shirt, but before he could tie the belt at the waist he fell to the ground with a thump and found himself tightly bound with many ropes. He was in great pain, and the women had all disappeared.</P>
<P>When Sanzang, Monkey, and Friar Sand woke up, the East was already lightening, and as they opened their eyes and looked around them they saw none of the lofty buildings that had been there. There were no carved and painted beams or rafters either: they had all been sleeping in a grove of pine and cypress. Sanzang called for Monkey in terror, and Friar Sand said, &#8220;Elder brother, we're done for, done for&#8212;they were demons.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; asked Monkey, who understood what had happened, with a trace of a smile. &#8220;Look where we've been sleeping,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;We're very comfortable here under the pine trees,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;but I wonder where that idiot is being punished.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Who's being punished?&#8221; asked Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;The woman and the girls last night were some Bodhisattvas or other appearing to us in disguise,&#8221; replied Monkey with a grin, &#8220;and I suppose they went away in the middle of the night. I'm afraid Pig is being punished.&#8221; On hearing this, Sanzang put his hands together and worshipped, and then they saw a piece of paper hanging from a cypress tree and fluttering in the breeze. Friar Sand hurried over to fetch it and show it to their master, who saw that there were eight lines of verse on it:</P>


<P>&#8220;The Old Woman of Mount Li had no yearning for the world,</P>
<P>But the Bodhisattva Guanyin persuaded her to come.</P>
<P>Samantabhadra and Manjusri were both present</P>
<P>Disguised as pretty girls among the trees.</P>
<P>The holy monk were too virtuous to return to lay life,</P>
<P>But the unreligious Pig was worse than worldly.</P>
<P>From now on he must calm his mind and reform&#8212;</P>
<P>If he misbehaves again, the journey will be hard.&#8221;</P>


<P>As Sanzang, Monkey, and Friar Sand read out these lines they heard loud shouts from the depths of the wood: &#8220;Master, they're tied me up and left me to die. I'll never do it again if you save me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Is that Pig shouting, Friar Sand?&#8221; asked Sanzang, and Friar Sand said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Although that blockhead is obstinately stupid in mind and nature,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;he is an honest fellow. Besides, he is very strong and can carry the luggage&#8212;and we should also remember that the Bodhisattva saved him and told him to come with us. I don't think he'll have the nerve to do it again.&#8221; Friar Sand then rolled up the bedding and arranged the luggage, while Monkey untied the horse and led it along as he guided the Tang Priest into the wood to investigate. Indeed:</P>


<P>In the pursuit of righteousness you must be careful,</P>
<P>And sweep away desires in your return to the truth.</P>


<P>If you don't know whether the blockhead survived or not, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>三藏不忘本</p>
<p>四圣试禅心</p>
</div>
<p>诗曰：奉法西来道路赊，秋风渐浙落霜花。乖猿牢锁绳休解，劣马勤兜鞭莫加。木母金公原自合，黄婆赤子本无差。咬开铁弹真消息，般若波罗到彼家。这回书，盖言取经之道，不离乎一身务本之道也。却说他师徒四众，了悟真如，顿开尘锁，自跳出性海流沙，浑无挂碍，径投大路西来。历遍了青山绿水，看不尽野草闲花。真个也光阴迅速，又值九秋，但见了些枫叶满山红，黄花耐晚风。老蝉吟渐懒，愁蟋思无穷。荷破青绔扇，橙香金弹丛。可怜数行雁，点点远排空。</p>

<p>正走处，不觉天晚。三藏道：“徒弟，如今天色又晚，却往那里安歇？”行者道：“师父说话差了，出家人餐风宿水，卧月眠霜，随处是家。又问那里安歇，何也？”猪八戒道：“哥啊，你只知道你走路轻省，那里管别人累坠？自过了流沙河，这一向爬山过岭，身挑着重担，老大难挨也！须是寻个人家，一则化些茶饭，二则养养精神，才是个道理。”行者道：“呆子，你这般言语，似有报怨之心。还象在高老庄，倚懒不求福的自在，恐不能也。</p>

<p>既是秉正沙门，须是要吃辛受苦，才做得徒弟哩。”八戒道：“哥哥，你看这担行李多重？”行者道：“兄弟，自从有了你与沙僧，我又不曾挑着，那知多重？”八戒道：“哥啊，你看看数儿么：四片黄藤蔑，长短八条绳。又要防阴雨，毡包三四层。匾担还愁滑，两头钉上钉。铜镶铁打九环杖，篾丝藤缠大斗篷。似这般许多行李，难为老猪一个逐日家担着走，偏你跟师父做徒弟，拿我做长工！”行者笑道：“呆子，你和谁说哩？”八戒道：“哥哥，与你说哩。”行者道：“错和我说了。老孙只管师父好歹，你与沙僧，专管行李马匹。但若怠慢了些儿，孤拐上先是一顿粗棍！”</p>

<p>八戒道：“哥啊，不要说打，打就是以力欺人。我晓得你的尊性高傲，你是定不肯挑；但师父骑的马，那般高大肥盛，只驮着老和尚一个，教他带几件儿，也是弟兄之情。”行者道：“你说他是马哩！他不是凡马，本是西海龙王敖闰之子，唤名龙马三太子。</p>

<p>只因纵火烧了殿上明珠，被他父亲告了忤逆，身犯天条，多亏观音菩萨救了他的性命，他在那鹰愁陡涧，久等师父，又幸得菩萨亲临，却将他退鳞去角，摘了项下珠，才变做这匹马，愿驮师父往西天拜佛。这个都是各人的功果，你莫攀他。”那沙僧闻言道：“哥哥，真个是龙么？”行者道：“是龙。”八戒道：“哥啊，我闻得古人云，龙能喷云暧雾，播土扬沙。有巴山捎岭的手段，有翻江搅海的神通。怎么他今日这等慢慢而走？”行者道：“你要他快走，我教他快走个儿你看。”好大圣，把金箍棒揝一揝，万道彩云生。那马看见拿棒，恐怕打来，慌得四只蹄疾如飞电，飕的跑将去了。那师父手软勒不住，尽他劣性，奔上山崖，才大达辿步走。师父喘息始定，抬头远见一簇松阴，内有几间房舍，着实轩昂，但见：门垂翠柏，宅近青山。几株松冉冉，数茎竹斑斑。</p>

<p>篱边野菊凝霜艳，桥畔幽兰映水丹。粉泥墙壁，砖砌围圜。高堂多壮丽，大厦甚清安。牛羊不见无鸡犬，想是秋收农事闲。</p>

<p>那师父正按辔徐观，又见悟空兄弟方到。悟净道：“师父不曾跌下马来么？”长老骂道：“悟空这泼猴，他把马儿惊了，早是我还骑得住哩！”行者陪笑道：“师父莫骂我，都是猪八戒说马行迟，故此着他快些。”那呆子因赶马，走急了些儿，喘气嘘嘘，口里唧唧哝哝的闹道：“罢了！罢了！见自肚别腰松，担子沉重，挑不上来，又弄我奔奔波波的赶马！”长老道：“徒弟啊，你且看那壁厢，有一座庄院，我们却好借宿去也。”行者闻言，急抬头举目而看，果见那半空中庆云笼罩，瑞霭遮盈，情知定是佛仙点化，他却不敢泄漏天机，只道：“好！好！好！我们借宿去来。”</p>

<p>长老连忙下马，见一座门楼，乃是垂莲象鼻，画栋雕梁。沙僧歇了担子，八戒牵了马匹道：“这个人家，是过当的富实之家。”行者就要进去，三藏道：“不可，你我出家人，各自避些嫌疑，切莫擅入。且自等他有人出来，以礼求宿，方可。”八戒拴了马，斜倚墙根之下，三藏坐在石鼓上，行者、沙僧坐在台基边。久无人出，行者性急，跳起身入门里看处：原来有向南的三间大厅，帘栊高控。屏门上，挂一轴寿山福海的横披画；两边金漆柱上，贴着一幅大红纸的春联，上写着：丝飘弱柳平桥晚，雪点香梅小院春。正中间，设一张退光黑漆的香几，几上放一个古铜兽炉。</p>

<p>上有六张交椅，两山头挂着四季吊屏。</p>

<p>行者正然偷看处，忽听得后门内有脚步之声，走出一个半老不老的妇人来，娇声问道：“是甚么人，擅入我寡妇之门？”慌得个大圣喏喏连声道：“小僧是东土大唐来的，奉旨向西方拜佛求经。一行四众，路过宝方，天色已晚，特奔老菩萨檀府，告借一宵。”那妇人笑语相迎道：“长老，那三位在那里？请来。”行者高声叫道：“师父，请进来耶。”三藏才与八戒、沙僧牵马挑担而入，只见那妇人出厅迎接。八戒饧眼偷看，你道他怎生打扮：</p>

<p>穿一件织金官绿纻丝袄，上罩着浅红比甲；系一条结彩鹅黄锦绣裙，下映着高底花鞋。时样鬘髻皂纱漫，相衬着二色盘龙发；</p>

<p>宫样牙梳朱翠晃，斜簪着两股赤金钗。云鬓半苍飞凤翅，耳环双坠宝珠排。脂粉不施犹自美，风流还似少年才。</p>

<p>那妇人见了他三众，更加欣喜，以礼邀入厅房，一一相见礼毕，请各叙坐看茶。那屏风后，忽有一个丫髻垂丝的女童，托着黄金盘、白玉盏，香茶喷暖气，异果散幽香。那人绰彩袖，春笋纤长；擎玉盏，传茶上奉。对他们一一拜了。茶毕，又吩咐办斋。三藏启手道：“老菩萨，高姓？贵地是甚地名？”妇人道：“此间乃西牛贺洲之地。小妇人娘家姓贾，夫家姓莫。幼年不幸，公姑早亡，与丈夫守承祖业，有家资万贯，良田千顷。夫妻们命里无子，止生了三个女孩儿，前年大不幸，又丧了丈夫，小妇居孀，今岁服满。空遗下田产家业，再无个眷族亲人，只是我娘女们承领。欲嫁他人，又难舍家业。适承长老下降，想是师徒四众。小妇娘女四人，意欲坐山招夫，四位恰好，不知尊意肯否如何。”三藏闻言，推聋妆哑，瞑目宁心，寂然不答。那妇人道：“舍下有水田三百余顷，旱田三百余顷，山场果木三百余顷；黄水牛有一千余只，况骡马成群，猪羊无数。东南西北，庄堡草场，共有六七十处。家下有八九年用不着的米谷，十来年穿不着的绫罗；一生有使不着的金银，胜强似那锦帐藏春，说甚么金钗两行。你师徒们若肯回心转意，招赘在寒家，自自在在，享用荣华，却不强如往西劳碌？”那三藏也只是如痴如蠢，默默无言。</p>

<p>那妇人道：“我是丁亥年三月初三日酉时生。故夫比我年大三岁，我今年四十五岁。大女儿名真真，今年二十岁；次女名爱爱，今年十八岁；三小女名怜怜，今年十六岁，俱不曾许配人家。虽是小妇人丑陋，却幸小女俱有几分颜色，女工针指，无所不会。因是先夫无子，即把他们当儿子看养，小时也曾教他读些儒书，也都晓得些吟诗作对。虽然居住山庄，也不是那十分粗俗之类，料想也配得过列位长老，若肯放开怀抱，长发留头，与舍下做个家长，穿绫着锦，胜强如那瓦钵缁衣，雪鞋云笠！”</p>

<p>三藏坐在上面，好便似雷惊的孩子，雨淋的虾蟆，只是呆呆挣挣，翻白眼儿打仰。那八戒闻得这般富贵，这般美色，他却心痒难挠，坐在那椅子上，一似针戳屁股，左扭右扭的，忍耐不住，走上前，扯了师父一把道：“师父！这娘子告诵你话，你怎么佯佯不睬？好道也做个理会是。”那师父猛抬头，咄的一声，喝退了八戒道：“你这个孽畜！我们是个出家人，岂以富贵动心，美色留意，成得个甚么道理！”那妇人笑道：“可怜！可怜！出家人有何好处？”三藏道：“女菩萨，你在家人，却有何好处？”那妇人道：“长老请坐，等我把在家人好处说与你听。怎见得？有诗为证，诗曰：春裁方胜着新罗，夏换轻纱赏绿荷；秋有新蒭香糯酒，冬来暖阁醉颜酡。四时受用般般有，八节珍羞件件多；衬锦铺绫花烛夜，强如行脚礼弥陀。”三藏道：“女菩萨，你在家人享荣华，受富贵，有可穿，有可吃，儿女团圆，果然是好。但不知我出家的人，也有一段好处。怎见得？有诗为证，诗曰：出家立志本非常，推倒从前恩爱堂。外物不生闲口舌，身中自有好阴阳。</p>

<p>功完行满朝金阙，见性明心返故乡。胜似在家贪血食，老来坠落臭皮囊。”</p>

<p>那妇人闻言大怒道：“这泼和尚无礼！我若不看你东土远来，就该叱出。我倒是个真心实意，要把家缘招赘汝等，你倒反将言语伤我。你就是受了戒，发了愿，永不还俗，好道你手下人，我家也招得一个。你怎么这般执法？”三藏见他发怒，只得者者谦谦叫道：“悟空，你在这里罢。”行者道：“我从小儿不晓得干那般事，教八戒在这里罢。”八戒道：“哥啊，不要栽人么。</p>

<p>大家从长计较。”三藏道：“你两个不肯，便教悟净在这里罢。”</p>

<p>沙僧道：“你看师父说的话。弟子蒙菩萨劝化，受了戒行，等候师父。自蒙师父收了我，又承教诲，跟着师父还不上两月，更不曾进得半分功果，怎敢图此富贵！宁死也要往西天去，决不干此欺心之事。”那妇人见他们推辞不肯，急抽身转进屏风，扑的把腰门关上。师徒们撇在外面，茶饭全无，再没人出。八戒心中焦燥，埋怨唐僧道：“师父忒不会干事，把话通说杀了。你好道还活着些脚儿，只含糊答应，哄他些斋饭吃了，今晚落得一宵快活，明日肯与不肯，在乎你我了。似这般关门不出，我们这清灰冷灶，一夜怎过！”悟净道：“二哥，你在他家做个女婿罢。”</p>

<p>八戒道：“兄弟，不要栽人。从长计较。”行者道：“计较甚的？你要肯，便就教师父与那妇人做个亲家，你就做个倒踏门的女婿。他家这等有财有宝，一定倒陪妆奁，整治个会亲的筵席，我们也落些受用。你在此间还俗，却不是两全其美？”八戒道：“话便也是这等说，却只是我脱俗又还俗，停妻再娶妻了。”沙僧道：“二哥原来是有嫂子的？”行者道：“你还不知他哩，他本是乌斯藏高老儿庄高太公的女婿。因被老孙降了，他也曾受菩萨戒行，没及奈何，被我捉他来做个和尚，所以弃了前妻，投师父往西拜佛。他想是离别的久了，又想起那个勾当，却才听见这个勾当，断然又有此心。呆子，你与这家子做了女婿罢，只是多拜老孙几拜，我不检举你就罢了。”那呆子道：“胡说！胡说！大家都有此心，独拿老猪出丑。常言道：和尚是色中饿鬼。那个不要如此？都这们扭扭捏捏的拿班儿，把好事都弄得裂了。这如今茶水不得见面，灯火也无人管，虽熬了这一夜，但那匹马明日又要驮人，又要走路，再若饿上这一夜，只好剥皮罢了。你们坐着，等老猪去放放马来。”那呆子虎急急的，解了缰绳，拉出马去。行者道：“沙僧，你且陪师父坐这里，等老孙跟他去，看他往那里放马。”三藏道：“悟空，你看便去看他，但只不可只管嘲他了。”行者道：“我晓得。”这大圣走出厅房，摇身一变，变作个红蜻蜓儿，飞出前门，赶上八戒。</p>

<p>那呆子拉着马，有草处且不教吃草，嗒嗒嗤嗤的赶着马，转到后门首去，只见那妇人，带了三个女子，在后门外闲立着，看菊花儿耍子。他娘女们看见八戒来时，三个女儿闪将进去，那妇人伫立门首道：“小长老那里去？”这呆子丢了缰绳，上前唱个喏，道声：“娘！我来放马的。”那妇人道：“你师父忒弄精细，在我家招了女婿，却不强似做挂搭僧，往西跄路？”八戒笑道：“他们是奉了唐王的旨意，不敢有违君命，不肯干这件事。</p>

<p>刚才都在前厅上栽我，我又有些奈上祝下的，只恐娘嫌我嘴长耳大。”那妇人道：“我也不嫌，只是家下无个家长，招一个倒也罢了，但恐小女儿有些儿嫌丑。”八戒道：“娘，你上复令爱，不要这等拣汉。想我那唐僧人才虽俊，其实不中用。我丑自丑，有几句口号儿。”妇人道：“你怎的说么？”八戒道：“我虽然人物丑，勤紧有些功。若言千顷地，不用使牛耕。只消一顿钯，布种及时生。没雨能求雨，无风会唤风。房舍若嫌矮，起上二三层。</p>

<p>地下不扫扫一扫，阴沟不通通一通。家长里短诸般事，踢天弄井我皆能。”那妇人道：“既然干得家事，你再去与你师父商量商量看，不尴尬，便招你罢。”八戒道：“不用商量！他又不是我的生身父母，干与不干，都在于我。”妇人道：“也罢，也罢，等我与小女说。”看他闪进去，扑的掩上后门。八戒也不放马，将马拉向前来。怎知孙大圣已一一尽知，他转翅飞来，现了本相，先见唐僧道：“师父，悟能牵马来了。”长老道：“马若不牵，恐怕撒欢走了。”行者笑将起来，把那妇人与八戒说的勾当，从头说了一遍，三藏也似信不信的。</p>

<p>少时间，见呆子拉将马来拴下，长老道：“你马放了？”八戒道：“无甚好草，没处放马。”行者道：“没处放马，可有处牵马么？”呆子闻得此言，情知走了消息，也就垂头扭颈，努嘴皱眉，半晌不言。又听得呀的一声，腰门开了，有两对红灯，一副提壶，香云霭霭，环珮叮叮，那妇人带着三个女儿，走将出来，叫真真、爱爱、怜怜，拜见那取经的人物。那女子排立厅中，朝上礼拜。果然也生得标致，但见他：一个个蛾眉横翠，粉面生春。</p>

<p>妖娆倾国色，窈窕动人心。花钿显现多娇态，绣带飘飖迥绝尘。</p>

<p>半含笑处樱桃绽，缓步行时兰麝喷。满头珠翠，颤巍巍无数宝钗簪；遍体幽香，娇滴滴有花金缕细。说甚么楚娃美貌，西子娇容？真个是九天仙女从天降，月里嫦娥出广寒！那三藏合掌低头，孙大圣佯佯不睬，这沙僧转背回身。你看那猪八戒，眼不转睛，淫心紊乱，色胆纵横，扭捏出悄语低声道：“有劳仙子下降。(奇*书*网^.^整*理*提*供)</p>

<p>娘，请姐姐们去耶。”那三个女子，转入屏风，将一对纱灯留下。</p>

<p>妇人道：“四位长老，可肯留心，着那个配我小女么？”悟净道：</p>

<p>“我们已商议了，着那个姓猪的招赘门下。”八戒道：“兄弟，不要栽我，还从众计较。”行者道：“还计较甚么？你已是在后门首说合的停停当当，娘都叫了，又有甚么计较？师父做个男亲家，这婆儿做个女亲家，等老孙做个保亲，沙僧做个媒人。也不必看通书，今朝是个天恩上吉日，你来拜了师父，进去做了女婿罢。”八戒道：“弄不成！弄不成！那里好干这个勾当！”行者道：</p>

<p>“呆子，不要者嚣，你那口里娘也不知叫了多少，又是甚么弄不成？快快的应成，带携我们吃些喜酒，也是好处。”他一只手揪着八戒，一只手扯住妇人道：“亲家母，带你女婿进去。”那呆子脚儿趄趄的要往那里走，那妇人即唤童子：“展抹桌椅，铺排晚斋，管待三位亲家。我领姑夫房里去也。”一壁厢又吩咐庖丁排筵设宴，明晨会亲，那几个童子，又领命讫。他三众吃了斋，急急铺铺，都在客座里安歇不题。</p>

<p>却说那八戒跟着丈母，行入里面，一层层也不知多少房舍，磕磕撞撞，尽都是门槛绊脚。呆子道：“娘，慢些儿走，我这里边路生，你带我带儿。”那妇人道：“这都是仓房、库房、碾房各房，还不曾到那厨房边哩。”八戒道：“好大人家！”磕磕撞撞，转湾抹角，又走了半会，才是内堂房屋。那妇人道：“女婿，你师兄说今朝是天恩上吉日，就教你招进来了。却只是仓卒间，不曾请得个阴阳，拜堂撒帐，你可朝上拜八拜儿罢。”八戒道：</p>

<p>“娘，娘说得是，你请上坐，等我也拜几拜，就当拜堂，就当谢亲，两当一儿，却不省事？”他丈母笑道：“也罢，也罢，果然是个省事干家的女婿。我坐着，你拜么。”咦！满堂中银烛辉煌，这呆子朝上礼拜，拜毕道：“娘，你把那个姐姐配我哩？”他丈母道：“正是这些儿疑难：我要把大女儿配你，恐二女怪；要把二女配你，恐三女怪；欲将三女配你，又恐大女怪；所以终疑未定。”八戒道：“娘，既怕相争，都与我罢，省得闹闹吵吵，乱了家法。”他丈母道：“岂有此理！你一人就占我三个女儿不成！”八戒道：“你看娘说的话。那个没有三房四妾？就再多几个，你女婿也笑纳了。我幼年间，也曾学得个熬战之法，管情一个个伏侍得他欢喜。”那妇人道：“不好！不好！我这里有一方手帕，你顶在头上，遮了脸，撞个天婚，教我女儿从你跟前走过，你伸开手扯倒那个就把那个配了你罢。”呆子依言，接了手帕，顶在头上。有诗为证，诗曰：痴愚不识本原由，色剑伤身暗自休。从来信有周公礼，今日新郎顶盖头。那呆子顶裹停当，道：“娘，请姐姐们出来么。”他丈母叫：“真真、爱爱、怜怜，都来撞天婚，配与你女婿。”只听得环珮响亮，兰麝馨香，似有仙子来往，那呆子真个伸手去捞人。两边乱扑，左也撞不着，右也撞不着。来来往往，不知有多少女子行动，只是莫想捞着一个。东扑抱着柱科，西扑摸着板壁，两头跑晕了，立站不稳，只是打跌。前来蹬着门扇，后去汤着砖墙，磕磕撞撞，跌得嘴肿头青，坐在地下，喘气呼呼的道：“娘啊，你女儿这等乖滑得紧，捞不着一个，奈何！奈何！”那妇人与他揭了盖头道：“女婿，不是我女儿乖滑，他们大家谦让，不肯招你。”八戒道：“娘啊，既是他们不肯招我啊，你招了我罢。”那妇人道：“好女婿呀！这等没大没小的，连丈母也都要了！我这三个女儿，心性最巧，他一人结了一个珍珠篏锦汗衫儿。你若穿得那个的，就教那个招你罢。”八戒道：</p>

<p>“好！好！好！把三件儿都拿来我穿了看。若都穿得，就教都招了罢。”那妇人转进房里，止取出一件来，递与八戒。那呆子脱下青锦布直裰，取过衫儿，就穿在身上，还未曾系上带子，扑的一蹻，跌倒在地，原来是几条绳紧紧绷住。那呆子疼痛难禁，这些人早已不见了。</p>

<p>却说三藏、行者、沙僧一觉睡醒，不觉的东方发白。忽睁睛抬头观看。那里得那大厦高堂，也不是雕梁画栋，一个个都睡在松柏林中。慌得那长老忙呼行者，沙僧道：“哥哥，罢了！罢了！我们遇着鬼了！”孙大圣心中明白，微微的笑道：“怎么说？”</p>

<p>长老道：“你看我们睡在那里耶！”行者道：“这松林下落得快活，但不知那呆子在那里受罪哩。”长老道：“那个受罪？”行者笑道：“昨日这家子娘女们，不知是那里菩萨，在此显化我等，想是半夜里去了，只苦了猪八戒受罪。”三藏闻言，合掌顶礼，又只见那后边古柏树上，飘飘荡荡的，挂着一张简帖儿。沙僧急去取来与师父看时，却是八句颂子云：“黎山老母不思凡，南海菩萨请下山。普贤文殊皆是客，化成美女在林间。圣僧有德还无俗，八戒无禅更有凡。从此静心须改过，若生怠慢路途难！”那长老、行者、沙僧正然唱念此颂，只听得林深处高声叫道：“师父啊，绷杀我了！救我一救！下次再不敢了！”三藏道：</p>

<p>“悟空，那叫唤的可是悟能么？”沙僧道：“正是。”行者道：“兄弟，莫睬他，我们去罢。”三藏道：“那呆子虽是心性愚顽，却只是一味懞直，倒也有些膂力，挑得行李，还看当日菩萨之念，救他随我们去罢，料他以后再不敢了。”那沙和尚却卷起铺盖，收拾了担子；孙大圣解缰牵马，引唐僧入林寻看。咦！这正是：从正修持须谨慎，扫除爱欲自归真。毕竟不知那呆子凶吉如何，且听下回分解。</p>
