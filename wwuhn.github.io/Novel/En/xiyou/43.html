<P>The Great Sage Reverently Visits the Southern Sea</P>
<P>Guanyin in Her Mercy Binds the Red Boy</P>
</div>
<P>The story tells how the six warriors left the cave and headed Southwest. Monkey thought, &#8220;They are going to invite the Old King to eat our master. I'm sure he must be the Bull Demon King. In the old days we got on very well and were the best of friends, but now I've gone straight and he's still an evil monster. Although it's a long time since I last saw him, I remember what he looks like. I think I'll turn myself into a Bull Demon King, try to fool them, and see how it goes.&#8221; Splendid Monkey gave the six little demons the slip, spread his wings, flew about a dozen miles ahead of them, shook himself, and turned into a Bull Demon King. He pulled out some hairs, shouted, &#8220;Change,&#8221; and turned them into little devils with dogs, falcons, bows and crossbows as if they were a hunting party in the mountain valley. He then waited for the six warriors.</P>
<P>As the six warriors were making their way sloppily along they suddenly noticed that the Bull Demon King was sitting in their midst. Heater and Cooker fell to their knees in a panic and said, &#8220;Your Majesty, you're here already.&#8221;</P>
<P>Mist in the Clouds, Clouds in the Mist, Fire-fast and Wind-speedy were also all common mortals with fleshly eyes, unable to tell the true from the false, and they too fell to their knees, kowtowed and said, &#8220;Your Majesty, we've been sent by the Sage Boy King of the Fire-cloud Cave to invite Your Senior Majesty to a meal of Tang Priest meat that will lengthen your life by a thousand ages.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Get up, children,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;and come back to my cave with me while I change.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There will be no need for all that trouble, Your Majesty,&#8221; said the little devils, still kowtowing. &#8220;You needn't go back. It's a long way, and I'm sure that our king would be angry with us if you did. Please come with us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What good children,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Very well then, lead the way. I'm coming with you.&#8221; The six little devils pulled themselves together and shouted to clear the way for the Great Sage, who was following them.</P>
<P>They were soon back at the cave. Wind-fast and Fire-speedy rushed in to report, &#8220;Your Majesty, His Senior Majesty is here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're capable lads to be back so soon,&#8221; said the demon king with delight. He then ordered all his commanders to parade his forces with their banners and drums to greet the Old King. All the demon in the cave obediently went out on parade. Monkey threw out his chest and acted very haughtily, braced himself, took back all the hairs he had turned into falconers and huntsmen, then strode straight in through the gates and took the central seat facing South as a monarch.</P>
<P>The Red Boy knelt and kowtowed to him, saying, &#8220;Your Majesty, your son pays obeisance.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No need for that,&#8221; said Monkey. After making four sets of kowtows the demon king stood below his father.</P>
<P>&#8220;What have you asked me here for, boy?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your stupid son,&#8221; said the demon with a bow, &#8220;caught someone yesterday&#8212;a priest from the Great Tang in the East. I've often heard tell that he is someone who has cultivated his conduct for ten lives, and that if you eat a piece of his flesh you'll live as long as an immortal from Penglai or Yingzhou. I did not dare to eat him by myself, which is why I asked Your Majesty to share the Tang Priest's flesh and extend your life by a thousand ages.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this Monkey looked shocked and asked, &#8220;Which Tang Priest, my boy?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The one going to fetch scriptures in the Western Heaven,&#8221; the demon king replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;But isn't he the master of Sun the Novice?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the demon king.</P>
<P>Monkey waved his hand, shook his head and said, &#8220;Don't start trouble with him. Pick a fight with anyone else you like, but not with him. My dear boy, don't you know what sort of person he is? That ape has vast magic powers and can do all sorts of transformations. When he made havoc in Heaven the Jade Emperor sent a hundred thousand Heavenly soldiers to spread out Heaven-and-earth nets, but they could not catch him. How could you have the nerve to eat his master? Send the priest out his moment, and don't start trouble with that monkey. If he heard that you'd eaten his master he wouldn't even need to fight you. He'd just have to poke a hole in the mountainside with that gold-banded cudgel of his to bring the whole mountain tumbling down. Then where would you be able to live, my boy, and who would there be to support me in my old age?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What things to say, Your Majesty,&#8221; said the demon king. &#8220;You're bolstering him and making me look small. That Monkey and a couple of his fellow disciples were crossing my mountains when I did a transformation and carried his master off. He and Pig traced me to the gates here and talked some nonsense about kinship. I got into such a raging fury that we fought a few rounds. That was all there was to it. He wasn't anything very special. Then Pig came charging in so I breathed out my True Samadhi Fire and routed him. Monkey was so desperate that he went to ask the dragon kings of the four seas for rain, but they couldn't put out my True Samadhi Fire. I burnt him so badly that he passed out, then sent Pig off in a great hurry to ask the Bodhisattva Guanyin of the Southern Seas to come. I turned myself into a Guanyin and tricked Pig into coming here: he's now hanging up in the As-You-Will bag, and I'm going to steam him as a treat for all the underlings. That Monkey was back shouting at our gates again this morning. I ordered his arrest, and it threw him into such a panic that he dropped his bundle and fled. It was only then that I invited Your Majesty over to see what the Tang Priest looked like in life before we have him steamed for you to eat and become immortal.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My dear boy,&#8221; laughed Monkey, &#8220;you're only aware of how you beat him with your True Samadhi Fire. What you forget is that he can do seventy-two transformations.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No matter what he turns himself into I can always spot him,&#8221; said the demon king, &#8220;and I'm sure he won't dare try another attack here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My son,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you may be able to recognize him sometimes, but he won't turn into something big like a wolf, an orangutan or an elephant. If he did he wouldn't be able to get inside the cave. You'd find it hard to recognize him if he turned into something small.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No matter how small he made himself we have four or five little devils on every door. He'll never be able to get in.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't realize that he can turn himself into a fly, or a mosquito, or a flea, or a bee, or a butterfly, or the tiniest of insects. He could even make himself look just like me. You wouldn't possibly be able to tell.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry,&#8221; said the demon king. &#8220;Even if he had guts of iron and a bronze heart he'd never dare come anywhere near here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case, dear son,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;what powers do you have that make you more than a match for him, so that you could invite me here today to eat the flesh of the Tang Priest? All the same, I don't think I'll have any today.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; the demon king said.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm getting old,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;and your mother keeps nagging at me to do some good works. The only good deed I'm interested in is eating vegetarian food.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; said the demon king, &#8220;is this permanent or just for a month?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Neither,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;It's called 'thunder vegetarianism'. You do it for four days each month.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Which four?&#8221; the demon asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The three days each month with Xin in their names, and the sixth day too. Today is the day<I> Xin You,</I> so that means I ought to be on vegetarian food. Besides,<I> You</I> days are not good for having visitors. But tomorrow I could be back to scrub, wash and steam him myself, and enjoy him with you, my boy.&#8221;</P>
<P>This all made the demon king think, &#8220;My father usually lives on human flesh, and he's already lived to be over a thousand. How come he's now thinking about a vegetarian diet? When you consider all the evil things he's done, three or four days of vegetarian food a month could never make up for them. There's something wrong here. It's very suspicious.&#8221; He withdrew and went out through the inner gates, sent for the six warriors, and asked them, &#8220;Where was His Senior Majesty when you gave him that invitation?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Halfway here,&#8221; the little devils replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;I thought you were quick,&#8221; said the demon king. &#8220;Didn't you go to his place?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the little devils, &#8220;we didn't.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is bad,&#8221; said the demon king. &#8220;I've been fooled. It's not His Senior Majesty.&#8221;</P>
<P>The little devils all knelt before him and asked, &#8220;Your Majesty, can't you recognize your own father?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He looks and moves just like my father,&#8221; said the demon king, &#8220;but what he says doesn't fit. I'm afraid I've been taken in and beaten by one of his transformations. I want you all to be very careful. The swordsmen among you must draw your swords, the spearmen sharpen your spears, and those of you who can use staves and ropes get ready to do so. I'm going to question him again and watch what he says. If he really is His Senior Majesty then it doesn't matter whether we have the feast today, tomorrow or in a month's time. But if what he says is wrong, then the moment I give a hum you're all to attack at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the little devils had all been given their orders the demon king turned on his heels, went back inside and bowed to Monkey, who said, &#8220;No need for all that formality within the family, my boy. Don't bow. Just say whatever it is you have to say.&#8221;</P>
<P>The demon king prostrated himself before Monkey and replied, &#8220;Your foolish son actually invited you for two reasons. One was to present you with Tang Priest meat, and the other was to ask you something. When I was out for a spin on my auspicious light the other day I went right up to the ninth level of clouds and bumped into the Taoist Master Zhang Daoling.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do you mean Zhang Daoling the Taoist pope?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the demon king replied. &#8220;What did he say to you?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Seeing that your son is complete in all his organs and that the spacing between my forehead, nose and chin is auspiciously even,&#8221; the demon king replied, &#8220;he asked me the hour, day, month and year of my birth. Your child is too young to remember all that properly. Master Zhang is a brilliant astrologer, and he offered to cast my horoscope. That is what I wanted to inquire about, Your Majesty, so that I can ask him to cast my horoscope next time I meet him.&#8221;</P>
<P>This made Monkey chuckle to himself: &#8220;What a magnificent demon. I've captured quite a few since I became a Buddhist and started escorting the Tang Priest on this journey, but none of them was as sharp as this one. He's asking me all trivial family details, and I'll just have to fake up my answers. How could I possibly know when he was born?&#8221; The splendid Monkey King was extremely crafty.</P>
<P>He continued to sit in majesty in the central position, showing not a trace of fear as he replied with his face wreathed in smiles, &#8220;Please get up, dear boy. I'm getting so old now that nothing goes the way I want it to any more. I can't remember just now exactly when you were born. I'll ask your mother when I go home tomorrow.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But Your Majesty is always reeling off the details of my birth-time,&#8221; the demon king said, &#8220;and telling me I'll live as long as Heaven. You can't have forgotten now. It's outrageous. You're a fake.&#8221; He then hummed the signal and all the demons rushed on Monkey and stabbed at him with their swords and spears.</P>
<P>The Great Sage parried their thrusts with his cudgel, went back to looking like himself again, and said to the evil spirit, &#8220;You're the outrageous one, dear boy. It can't possibly be right for a son to attack his own father.&#8221; The demon king was so overwhelmed with shame that he dared not return Monkey's look. Brother Monkey then turned into a golden glow and left the cave.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty, Sun the Novice has gone,&#8221; the little devils reported.</P>
<P>&#8220;Oh well, that's that,&#8221; said the demon king. &#8220;Good riddance. He beat me this time. Shut the gates and say nothing to him. Let's clean, cook and eat the Tang Priest.&#8221;</P>
<P>Laughing aloud as he brandished his cudgel, Monkey went back across the ravine. Hearing this, Friar Sand hurried out of the woods to say to him, &#8220;Brother, you've been ages. Why are you laughing? I hope it's because you've rescued the master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No, brother,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;But although I haven't rescued him yet, I won this time.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How?&#8221; Friar Sand asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The fiend disguised himself as Guanyin to lure Pig back here and hang him up in a leather bag. I was just trying to work out how to rescue Pig when the demon sent his six so-called warriors to invite the Old King to a meal of the master's flesh. I reckoned that the Old King was bound to be the Bull Demon King, so I turned myself into his double, went inside, and took the place of honour. He called me 'Your Majesty' and 'father,' and I replied; and when he kowtowed I sat up straight. It was lovely. I really did win.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But while you've been scoring easy points the master's life is in terrible danger,&#8221; said Friar Sand.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry about it,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'm off to ask the Bodhisattva here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But your back's still aching,&#8221; said Friar Sand.</P>
<P>&#8220;Now it isn't,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;As the old saying goes, when things go well they raise the spirits. Look after the horse and the luggage. I'm off.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've made such an enemy of him,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;that I'm scared he'll murder the master. Be as quick as you can.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll be quick,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'll be back in the time it takes to eat a meal.&#8221;</P>
<P>Even as he was still speaking, the splendid Great Sage left Friar Sand and set off on the somersault cloud that took him straight towards the Southern Ocean. He had been flying for less than an hour when Potaraka Island came into view. He landed his cloud in an instant and went straight to Raka Crag, where the twenty-four devas asked him as he walked solemnly towards them, &#8220;Great Sage, where are you going?&#8221;</P>
<P>After Monkey had exchanged courtesies with them he replied, &#8220;I would like to see the Bodhisattva.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please wait for a moment while we report to her,&#8221; the devas said. Hariti and the other devas went to the entrance of the Tide Cave to report, &#8220;Bodhisattva, Sun Wukong has come for an audience.&#8221; The Bodhisattva asked for him to be brought in.</P>
<P>The Great Sage tidied his clothes and obediently walked inside at a respectful pace. When he saw the Bodhisattva he prostrated himself before her. &#8220;Wukong,&#8221; she said, &#8220;why are you here instead of taking Master Golden Cicada to the West to fetch the scriptures?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Bodhisattva,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;your disciple humbly reports that while escorting the Tang Priest on his journey he has reached the Fire-cloud Cave in the Withered Pine Ravine on Mount Hao. An evil spirit called the Red Boy whose title is Sage Boy King has snatched my master. I and Pig found our way to his gates and fought him, but he started a True Samadhi Fire. This makes it impossible for us to beat him and rescue the master. I hurried to the Eastern Sea and asked the dragon kings of the four seas to make rain, but it couldn't control the flames, and I was badly hurt by the smoke, which all but killed me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why did you send for the dragon kings and not for me,&#8221; the Bodhisattva asked, &#8220;if he has True Samadhi Fire and such great powers?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I wanted to come,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;but I'd been so badly affected by the smoke that I couldn't ride a cloud. I sent Pig to come and ask you for help instead.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But he has not been here,&#8221; the Bodhisattva replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;That's just it,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Before Pig reached this island the evil spirit turned himself into your double, Bodhisattva, lured him into the cave, and has now hung him up in a leather bag ready to be steamed and eaten.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the Bodhisattva heard this she said in a furious rage, &#8220;How dare that vicious demon turn himself into my double!&#8221; With a roar of anger she flung her precious pure vase into the sea. Monkey was so horrified that his hair stood on end. He rose to his feet, stood below the Bodhisattva's throne, and said, &#8220;If the Bodhisattva does not control her temper I'll be blamed for talking out of turn and ruining her conduct. This is terrible. You've thrown your vase away. Had I known you could have done me a big favour and given it to me.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before the words were all out of his mouth the waves of the sea started to dance and the vase emerged from them. It was being carried on the back of a monster. When Brother Monkey took a good look at the monster he saw what it was like:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Where he comes from he is known as Mud-carrier,</P>
<P>Shining in splendor alone beneath the sea,</P>
<P>Knowing Heaven and earth from his ancient obscurity,</P>
<P>And the ways of ghosts and gods from his peaceful hiding-place.</P>
<P>When concealed he withdraws his head and his tail,</P>
<P>But his legs can make him swim as fast as flying.</P>
<P>On him King Wen drew trigram and Zeng Yuan cast omens;</P>
<P>He always was offered at the court of Fu Xi.</P>
<P>All beauty is revealed by this primal dragon,</P>
<P>Calling up the breakers and making the waves.</P>
<P>Threads of gold sew his carapace together,</P>
<P>And brindling gives the color to the tortoise-shell.</P>
<P>Its back carries the Eight Trigram Ninefold Palace;</P>
<P>Scattered splendor flecks his coat of green.</P>
<P>The dragon king admires him for his courage when alive;</P>
<P>He carries the tablet of Lord Buddha after death.</P>
<P>If you want to know what this creature is called,</P>
<P>He is the wicked tortoise who causes wind and waves.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Carrying the vase on his back, the tortoise crawled ashore, and made twenty-four nods to the Bodhisattva that counted as twenty-four kowtows. Seeing this Monkey laughed to himself as he said, &#8220;He must be the vase-keeper. I suppose they ask him for the vase whenever it's lost.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What is that you are saying, Wukong?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Fetch the vase,&#8221; the Bodhisattva ordered. Monkey went over to pick it up, but he had no more chance of moving it than a dragonfly has of shifting a stone pillar by even a fraction of an inch. Monkey went back to the Bodhisattva, knelt before her, and said, &#8220;Bodhisattva, your disciple cannot move it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;All you can do, you ape, is talk,&#8221; said the Bodhisattva. &#8220;If you can't even move a vase how can you hope to subdue demons?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;To be honest, Bodhisattva, I would normally be able to move it, but today I just can't. I think that being beaten by the evil spirit must have weakened me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It is usually an empty vase,&#8221; said the Bodhisattva, &#8220;but when I threw it into the sea it went round the Three Rivers, the Five Lakes, the Eight Seas, the Four Streams, and all the brooks, springs, pools and caves to borrow a whole seaful of water. You are nowhere near strong enough to lift a sea up. That is why you can't move it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Indeed,&#8221; said Brother Monkey, his hands clasped before him, &#8220;your disciple didn't know that.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Bodhisattva then stepped forward, gently lifted the vase with her right hand, and placed it on the palm of her left hand. The tortoise nodded to the Bodhisattva again and slipped back into the sea. &#8220;So you keep a domestic cretin to look after your vase,&#8221; observed Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said the Bodhisattva, seating herself, &#8220;the sweet dew in this flask of mine, unlike the dragon kings' private rain, can extinguish Samadhi Fire. I was going to let you take it, but you cannot move it. Then I thought of asking the Naga Maiden to go with you, but you have not got a kind heart and you are an inveterate deceiver. My Naga Maiden is very lovely, and the vase is precious; if you were to steal either of them I would be much too busy to go looking for you. So you will have to leave something as security.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How sad,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;that you should be so suspicious, Bodhisattva. I've never done anything like that since I was converted to the faith. What would you like me to leave as security? You yourself presented me with the brocade tunic I'm wearing. My tiger-skin kilt isn't worth tuppence, and I need this iron cudgel for self-defense. All that's left is the band round my head. It's gold, but you used magic to make it grow into my skull so that is can't be taken off. If you want security I'd like you to take that. Say a band-loosening spell and take it off. If that won't do, what else is there?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You are a cool customer,&#8221; said the Bodhisattva. &#8220;I do not want your clothes, your cudgel or your band. Just pluck out one of the life-saving hairs from the back of your head and give me that as your security.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But you gave it to me, Your Reverence,&#8221; protested Monkey. &#8220;Besides, If I pulled one out it would break up the set, and they'd not be able to save my life any more.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Ape,&#8221; said the Bodhisattva angrily, &#8220;you refuse to pull out one little hair. I do not feel at all like parting with my Maiden.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Bodhisattva,&#8221; pleaded Monkey, &#8220;you are being too suspicious. As they say, 'if you won't do it for the monk's sake do it for the Buddha's sake. Whatever you do, please, please save my master.&#8221; The Bodhisattva</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Stepped down with joy from her lotus seat,</P>
<P>Went amid incense to the crag by cloud.</P>
<P>Because the holy monk faced mortal peril</P>
<P>She would deliver him and catch the fiend.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey was absolutely delighted. He invited the Bodhisattva to leave the Tide Cave where the devas were drawn up in line on Pota Cliff. &#8220;Let us cross the sea, Wukong,&#8221; the Bodhisattva said.</P>
<P>&#8220;After you, Bodhisattva,&#8221; said Monkey with a bow. &#8220;No, after you,&#8221; replied the Bodhisattva.</P>
<P>&#8220;I would not dare to show off in front of the Bodhisattva,&#8221; said Monkey, kowtowing. &#8220;Were I to ride my somersault cloud, Bodhisattva, I fear I might be somewhat exposed, and you'd accuse me of disrespect.&#8221; At this the Bodhisattva sent the Naga Maiden to cut a lotus petal from the lotus pool and take it to the water beneath the cliff. &#8220;Stand on that petal,&#8221; the Bodhisattva said to Brother Monkey, &#8220;and I will take you across the sea.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But that petal is much too light and thin to take my weight,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;If I fall into the sea my tigerskin kilt will get soaked, and the saltpeter that keeps it soft will be washed out. Then I won't be able to wear it in cold weather.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Get on and see,&#8221; shouted the Bodhisattva. Not daring to make any more excuses, Monkey obediently jumped on it. Although it looked so flimsy it was considerably bigger than a sea-going boat once he was aboard.</P>
<P>&#8220;It can carry me, Bodhisattva,&#8221; he exclaimed with delight.</P>
<P>&#8220;Then over the sea with you,&#8221; replied the Bodhisattva.</P>
<P>&#8220;But there's no pole, oars, mast or sail,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;so how can I get over?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You will not need them,&#8221; said the Bodhisattva, and with a single breath she blew the boat right across to the opposite shore of the Southern Sea of Suffering.</P>
<P>Once his feet were on dry land Monkey smiled and said, &#8220;That Bodhisattva really showed off her magic powers by blowing me right across the sea with no trouble at all.&#8221;</P>
<P>Instructing all the devas to guard her immortal realm, the Bodhisattva told the Naga Maiden to close the gates of the cave, left the Pota Cliff by auspicious cloud and went over to call, &#8220;Where are you, Huian?&#8221; Huian was Moksa, the second son of Heavenly King Li, the Pagoda-carrier; he was the disciple whom the Bodhisattva personally taught, and he never left her side. His full title was Huian the Novice, Protector of the Dharma.</P>
<P>Huian placed his hands together and stood awaiting the Bodhisattva's orders. &#8220;Go straight up to Heaven,&#8221; she said, &#8220;call on His Majesty your father, and ask him to lend me his Pole Star swords.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How many will you need, Mistress?&#8221; Huian asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The whole set,&#8221; she replied.</P>
<P>Huian then went obediently straight up on his cloud, in through the Southern Gate of Heaven, and into the Cloud-tower Palace, where he kowtowed to his father.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where have you come from?&#8221; Heavenly King Li asked after greeting him.</P>
<P>&#8220;My mistress has been asked by Sun Wukong to subdue a demon,&#8221; Huian&#8212;or Moksa&#8212;replied. &#8220;She has sent me to visit you and ask for the loan of your set of Pole Star swords.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Heavenly King then sent Nezha to fetch the thirty-six swords, which he gave to Moksa. &#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Moksa to Nezha, &#8220;would you please pay my respects to our mother. I'm on a very urgent job, and I'll come to kowtow to her when I bring the swords back.&#8221; Taking his leave in a great hurry he brought his auspicious light straight down to the Southern Sea, where he presented the swords to the Bodhisattva.</P>
<P>The Bodhisattva took the swords, threw them into the air, said a spell, and turned them into a thousand-petal lotus throne, on which she took her seat. Monkey grinned to himself and said, &#8220;That Bodhisattva is a real skinflint. She has a lotus throne of many colours in her lotus pool already, but she's too mean to sit on that. She would have to send him off to borrow someone else's instead.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said the Bodhisattva, &#8220;be quiet and come with me.&#8221; They then both left the coast by cloud. The white parrot flew ahead, while the Great Sage and Huian stood behind her.</P>
<P>Within moments they saw a mountain-top. &#8220;That's Mount Hao,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;It's about a hundred and fifty miles from here to the demon's place.&#8221; The Bodhisattva then ordered him to lower the auspicious cloud. She said the magic word<I> &#8220;Om&#8221;</I> above the summit, whereupon many a god and ghost&#8212;all the local spirits of the mountain&#8212;emerged from all around the mountain and gathered to kowtow to the Bodhisattva's lotus throne.</P>
<P>&#8220;Do not be afraid,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I am here to capture this demon king. I want this whole area swept completely clean, with not a living creature left behind within a hundred miles of here. All the baby animals in their dens and fledglings in holes in the trees must be put on the top of this high crag for safety.&#8221; Obediently the demons withdrew, and soon they were all back. &#8220;Now that the place is clean, you may all return to your shrines,&#8221; said the Bodhisattva. She then turned her vase of purity upside-down, letting the water roar out with a noise like thunder. Indeed, it</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Flowed down from the peak,</P>
<P>Smashed through the rocks.</P>
<P>Flowed down from the peak with the force of the sea,</P>
<P>Smashed through the rocks like a mighty ocean.</P>
<P>Black spray rose to the watery heavens,</P>
<P>Great waves coldly reflected the sun.</P>
<P>Jade waves smashed through crags,</P>
<P>While the sea was covered with golden lotuses.</P>
<P>Guanyin displayed her demon-quelling magic,</P>
<P>Producing a fixing dhyana from her sleeve.</P>
<P>She made the mountain a Potaraka Island,</P>
<P>Just like the one in the Southern Sea</P>
<P>Tall grew the rushes, and the epiphyllum tender,</P>
<P>Flowers were everywhere, and the pattra looked fresh.</P>
<P>Parrots perched in the purple bamboos,</P>
<P>And quails were calling amid the verdant pines.</P>
<P>Endless lines of waves as far as the eye could see,</P>
<P>And all that could be heard was the wind on the waters.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Great Sage Monkey was full of silent admiration: &#8220;What great mercy and compassion. If I had that magic power I'd just have tipped the vase over, and to hell with the birds, beasts, reptiles and insects.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stretch your hand out, Wukong,&#8221; said the Bodhisattva. Monkey at once neatened his clothes and put out his left hand. The Bodhisattva drew out her sprig of willow, moistened it in the sweet dew, and wrote &#8220;Confusion&#8221; on his palm. &#8220;Make a fist,&#8221; she old him, &#8220;and go to challenge the demon to battle. Let him beat you, then draw him back here. I have a Dharma power with which to subdue him.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey obediently took his cloud straight back to the cave entrance. Brandishing his cudgel with one hand and clenching the other into a fist, he shouted, &#8220;Open up, evil spirits.&#8221; The little devils scampered back inside to report, &#8220;Sun the Novice is here again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Shut the doors tight and ignore him,&#8221; said the demon king.</P>
<P>&#8220;What a fine son you are,&#8221; shouted Monkey, &#8220;driving your own father out of doors and refusing to open the doors to him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Sun the Novice is being very abusive,&#8221; the little devils came back in to report.</P>
<P>&#8220;Ignore him,&#8221; said the demon king. When the doors were still shut after he had called twice, Monkey grew very angry. He raised his iron cudgel and smashed a hole in them.</P>
<P>This threw the little devils into such a panic that they ran tumbling and stumbling in to say, &#8220;Sun the Novice has broken the doors down.&#8221;</P>
<P>Hearing that the outer doors had been broken down after all the earlier reports the demon king now leapt up and sprang outside brandishing his spear and flinging insults back at Monkey: &#8220;You ape, you have no sense at all. I let you off lightly, but you don't know when enough is enough. You're trying to bully me again. I'll make you pay for the crime of smashing down my doors.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What about your crime in driving your own father away?&#8221; retorted Monkey.</P>
<P>In his humiliation and anger the demon king thrust his spear at Brother Monkey's chest. Monkey parried this with his cudgel and hit back. Once they started they fought four or five rounds in which Monkey, one hand holding the cudgel and the other clenched in a fist, gave ground. &#8220;I'm going back to get the Tang Priest scrubbed and cleaned,&#8221; said the demon.</P>
<P>&#8220;You be careful, my boy,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Heaven can see what you're doing. You come here.&#8221; This stung the demon king into an even greater fury. Running after Monkey he caught him up and took another thrust at him with his spear. Monkey swung back with his cudgel, and after a few more rounds ran away in defeat again. The demon king started to taunt him once more: &#8220;Last time you were good for twenty or thirty rounds. But now you're running away each time we fight. What's wrong with you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My dear boy,&#8221; grinned Monkey, &#8220;your father's afraid you'll start that fire again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I won't,&#8221; said the demon, &#8220;now, come here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you're not going to start a fire,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;let's move away from here. A tough guy doesn't attack people in front of his own door.&#8221; Not realizing that this was a trick, the evil spirit raised his spear and ran after him. Monkey trailed his cudgel and opened his other hand. The demon king then fell into confusion and chased Monkey for all he was worth. The quarry moved like a shooting star, and the pursuer like a bolt that had just been shot from a crossbow.</P>
<P>Before long Monkey saw the Bodhisattva. &#8220;Evil spirit,&#8221; he said to the demon, &#8220;I'm scared of you. Please spare me. I'm going to where the Bodhisattva Guanyin of the Southern Sea lives. You go home now.&#8221; The demon king was not going to believe this, so he gritted his teeth and continued the pursuit. With a shake of his body Monkey hid himself in the Bodhisattva's divine radiance.</P>
<P>Seeing that Monkey had disappeared, the evil spirit went up to the Bodhisattva, glared at her, and asked, &#8220;Are you reinforcements sent for by Monkey?&#8221; The Bodhisattva did not answer.</P>
<P>The demon king then twirled his spear and roared, &#8220;Hey! Are you reinforcements sent for by Monkey?&#8221; The Bodhisattva again did not answer.</P>
<P>The demon king then thrust his spear straight at the Bodhisattva's heart, at which she turned into a beam of golden light and rose straight up to the highest heavens. Monkey went up with her and complained, &#8220;Bodhisattva, you've tricked me again. Why did you act deaf and dumb and say nothing when that demon kept asking you? One thrust from his spear and you ran away. You've even ditched your lotus throne.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Keep quiet,&#8221; the Bodhisattva said, &#8220;and see what he does next.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey and Moksa stood next to each other up there watching while the demon said with a derisive jeer, &#8220;Insolent ape, you didn't know who you were up against. You didn't realize what sort of person I am. You fought me and lost several times, and then you sent for that putrid Bodhisattva. One thrust from my spear and she's disappeared. She's even left her lotus throne behind. Well, I'm going to sit on it now.&#8221; The evil spirit then sat cross-legged in the middle of the throne, imitating the Bodhisattva.</P>
<P>&#8220;That's just marvellous,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Now you've given your lotus throne away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What are you saying now, Wukong?&#8221; the Bodhisattva asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;What am I saying?&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;I'm saying you've given your lotus throne away. That fiend has just sat himself down on it. Would you care to get it back?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But I want him to sit on it,&#8221; the Bodhisattva said. &#8220;He's so small he'll sit on it much more safely than you did,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop talking,&#8221; said the Bodhisattva, &#8220;and watch the power of the Dharma.&#8221;</P>
<P>She pointed downwards with her sprig of willow and called. &#8220;Turn back.&#8221; The colours and auspicious glow of the lotus sea all disappeared, leaving the demon king sitting on the points of swords. &#8220;Drive the swords in by hitting their handles with the demon-quelling pestle,&#8221; she ordered Moksa.</P>
<P>Moksa then took his cloud straight down and struck over a thousand times with the demon-quelling pestle as if he were ramming down earth to build a wall. The demon was now pouring with blood from his open wounds as the points of two swords both came out through his thighs. Watch the demon as he grits his teeth against the agony. Throwing his spear down he pulled furiously at the swords.</P>
<P>&#8220;Bodhisattva,&#8221; exclaimed Monkey, &#8220;that monster's not afraid of pain. He's trying to pull the swords out.&#8221;</P>
<P>Seeing this she called to Moksa, &#8220;Don't kill him.&#8221; She then pointed her sprig of willow down once more, said the magic word<I> &#8220;Om,&#8221;</I> and turned all Pole Star swords into halberds with inverted barbs like wolf's teeth that could not be pulled out. This finally made the demon desperate.</P>
<P>Trying to bend the sword-points he pleaded in his agony, &#8220;Bodhisattva, your disciple was blind. I failed to recognize your great Dharma powers. I beg you in your mercy to spare my life. I shall never do evil again, and I vow to become a Buddhist and observe the rules of conduct.&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing this the Bodhisattva went down on her golden light with Moksa, Monkey and the white parrot till she was in front of the evil spirit. &#8220;Will you really accept my rules of conduct?&#8221;</P>
<P>The demon king nodded and said amid tears, &#8220;I will accept the rules if you spare my life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Will you join my faith?&#8221; the Bodhisattva asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you spare my life I swear I will,&#8221; said the demon king.</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said the Bodhisattva, &#8220;I shall lay my hands on your head and administer the vows.&#8221; From her sleeve she produced a golden razor, with a few strokes of which she shaved the demon's head into a Mount Tai tonsure, leaving him with a topknot and with three little tufts.</P>
<P>&#8220;Poor evil spirit,&#8221; laughed Monkey. &#8220;Now you can't tell whether he's a boy or a girl. Goodness knows what he's meant to be.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As you have accepted my rules of conduct,&#8221; said the Bodhisattva to the demon, &#8220;I will not mistreat you. I shall call you Page Sudhana. Do you accept?&#8221; The demon bowed in assent, wanting only to have his life spared. The Bodhisattva then pointed at him and called, &#8220;Withdraw!&#8221; With a crashing sound the Pole Star swords all fell into the dust. The boy was now unharmed.</P>
<P>&#8220;Huian,&#8221; said the Bodhisattva, &#8220;will you take the swords back to the Heavenly Palace and return them to His Majesty your father? You need not come back to meet me: wait with all the devas on the Pota Crag.&#8221; As instructed, Moksa took the swords back to Heaven then returned to the Southern Sea.</P>
<P>Now the boy's savage nature had not yet been tamed. When he realized that the pain in his legs had gone, that his backside was no longer wounded, and that he had three little tufts of hair on his head he ran over to grab his spear and said to the Bodhisattva, &#8220;You don't have any real Dharma powers that can put me down. It was all just an illusion. I refuse to accept your rules. Take this!&#8221;</P>
<P>He jabbed at her face with his spear, making Monkey so angry that he struck at the boy with his cudgel. &#8220;Don't hit him,&#8221; the Bodhisattva called out.</P>
<P>&#8220;I have a way of punishing him.&#8221; From her sleeve she produced a gold band and continued, &#8220;This treasure is one of the three bands&#8212;a golden one, tightening one, and a prohibition one&#8212;that the Tathagata Buddha gave me when I went to the East to find the pilgrim who would fetch the scriptures. You are wearing the tightening band. The prohibition band was used to subdue the great god guarding the mountain. I have not been able to bring myself to give the golden one away before, but as this demon is being so outrageous he shall have it.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Bodhisattva then waved the band in the wind, shouted &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned it into five band that she threw at the boy with the command &#8220;Fix!&#8221; One went over his head, two on his hands, and two on his feet. &#8220;Stand clear, Wukong,&#8221; the Bodhisattva ordered, &#8220;while I say the Gold-band Spell.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Bodhisattva,&#8221; pleaded Monkey in panic, &#8220;I asked you here to subdue the demon, so why ever are you putting a curse on me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But this will not be the Band-tightening Spell that affects you,&#8221; the Bodhisattva explained. &#8220;It will be the Gold-band Spell that works on the boy.&#8221; Monkey felt easier in his mind as he stood beside the Bodhisattva and listened to her saying the spell. She made magic with her hands and recited the words silently several times over. The evil spirit twisted and tugged at his ears and cheeks, stamped his feet and rolled around. Indeed,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>One phrase unites all the words without number;</P>
<P>Boundless and deep is the strength of the Dharma.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know how the boy was finally converted, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>大圣殷勤拜南海</p>
<p>观音慈善缚红孩</p>
</div>
<p>话说那六健将出洞门，径往西南上，依路而走。行者心中暗想道：“他要请老大王吃我师父，老大王断是牛魔王。我老孙当年与他相会，真个意合情投，交游甚厚，至如今我归正道，他还是邪魔。虽则久别，还记得他模样，且等老孙变作牛魔王，哄他一哄，看是何如。”好行者，躲离了六个小妖，展开翅，飞向前边，离小妖有十数里远近，摇身一变，变作个牛魔王，拔下几根毫毛，叫“变！”即变作几个小妖。在那山凹里，驾鹰牵犬，搭驽张弓，充作打围的样子，等候那六健将。那一伙厮拖厮扯，正行时，忽然看见牛魔王坐在中间，慌得兴烘掀、掀烘兴扑的跪下道：“老大王爷爷在这里也。”那云里雾、雾里云、急如火、快如风都是肉眼凡胎，那里认得真假，也就一同跪倒，磕头道：“爷爷！小的们是火云洞圣婴大王处差来，请老大王爷爷去吃唐僧肉，寿延千纪哩。”行者借口答道：“孩儿们起来，同我回家去，换了衣服来也。”小妖叩头道：“望爷爷方便，不消回府罢。路程遥远，恐我大王见责，小的们就此请行。”行者笑道：“好乖儿女，也罢也罢，向前开路，我和你去来。”六怪抖擞精神，向前喝路，大圣随后而来。</p>

<p>不多时，早到了本处。快如风、急如火撞进洞里报：“大王，老大王爷爷来了。”妖王欢喜道：“你们却中用，这等来的快。”</p>

<p>即便叫：“各路头目，摆队伍，开旗鼓，迎接老大王爷爷。”满洞群妖，遵依旨令，齐齐整整，摆将出去。这行者昂昂烈烈，挺着胸脯，把身子抖了一抖，却将那架鹰犬的毫毛，都收回身上，拽开大步，径走入门里，坐在南面当中。红孩儿当面跪下，朝上叩头道：“父王，孩儿拜揖。”行者道：“孩儿免礼。”那妖王四大拜拜毕，立于下手。行者道：“我儿，请我来有何事？”妖王躬身道：</p>

<p>“孩儿不才，昨日获得一人，乃东土大唐和尚。常听得人讲，他是一个十世修行之人，有人吃他一块肉，寿似蓬瀛不老仙。愚男不敢自食，特请父王同享唐僧之肉，寿延千纪。”行者闻言，打了个失惊道：“我儿，是那个唐僧？”妖王道：“是往西天取经的人也。”行者道：“我儿，可是孙行者师父么？”妖王道：“正是。”行者摆手摇头道：“莫惹他！莫惹他！别的还好惹，孙行者是那样人哩，我贤郎，你不曾会他？那猴子神通广大，变化多端。他曾大闹天宫，玉皇上帝差十万天兵，布下天罗地网，也不曾捉得他。你怎么敢吃他师父！快早送出去还他，不要惹那猴子。他若打听着你吃了他师父，他也不来和你打，他只把那金箍棒往山腰里搠个窟窿，连山都掬了去。我儿，弄得你何处安身，教我倚靠何人养老！”妖王道：“父王说那里话，长他人志气，灭孩儿的威风。那孙行者共有兄弟三人，领唐僧在我半山之中，被我使个变化，将他师父摄来。他与那猪八戒当时寻到我的门前，讲甚么攀亲托熟之言，被我怒发冲天，与他交战几合，也只如此，不见甚么高作。那猪八戒刺邪里就来助战，是孩儿吐出三昧真火，把他烧败了一阵。慌得他去请四海龙王助雨，又不能灭得我三昧真火，被我烧了一个小发昏，连忙着猪八戒去请南海观音菩萨。是我假变观音，把猪八戒赚来，见吊在如意袋中，也要蒸他与众小的们吃哩。那行者今早又来我的门首吆喝，我传令教拿他，慌得他把包袱都丢下走了。却才去请父王来看看唐僧活像，方可蒸与你吃，延寿长生不老也。”行者笑道：“我贤郎啊，你只知有三昧火赢得他，不知他有七十二般变化哩！”妖王道：“凭他怎么变化，我也认得，谅他决不敢进我门来。”行者道：“我儿，你虽然认得他，他却不变大的，如狼犺大象，恐进不得你门；他若变作小的，你却难认。”妖王道：</p>

<p>“凭他变甚小的，我这里每一层门上，有四五个小妖把守，他怎生得入！”行者道：“你是不知，他会变苍蝇、蚊子、虼蚤，或是蜜蜂、蝴蝶并蟭蟟虫等项，又会变我模样，你却那里认得？”妖王道：“勿虑，他就是铁胆铜心，也不敢近我门来也。”行者道：“既如此说，贤郎甚有手段，实是敌得他过，方来请我吃唐僧的肉，奈何我今日还不吃哩。”妖王道：“如何不吃？”行者道：“我近来年老，你母亲常劝我作些善事。我想无甚作善，且持些斋戒。”</p>

<p>妖王道：“不知父王是长斋，是月斋？”行者道：“也不是长斋，也不是月斋，唤做雷斋，每月只该四日。”妖王问：“是那四日？”行者道：“三辛逢初六。今朝是辛酉日，一则当斋，二来酉不会客。</p>

<p>且等明日，我去亲自刷洗蒸他，与儿等同享罢。”那妖王闻言心中暗想道：“我父王平日吃人为生，今活彀有一千余岁，怎么如今又吃起斋来了？想当初作恶多端，这三四日斋戒，那里就积得过来？此言有假，可疑！可疑！”即抽身走出二门之下，叫六健将来问：“你们老大王是那里请来的？”小妖道：“是半路请来的。”妖王道：“我说你们来的快，不曾到家么？”小妖道：“是，不曾到家。”妖王道：“不好了！着了他假也！这不是老大王！”小妖一齐跪下道：“大王，自家父亲，也认不得？”妖王道：“观其形容动静都象，只是言语不象，只怕着了他假，吃了人亏。你们都要仔细：会使刀的，刀要出鞘，会使枪的，枪要磨明，会使棍的使棍，会使绳的使绳。待我再去问他，看他言语如何。若果是老大王，莫说今日不吃，明日不吃，便迟个月何妨！假若言语不对，只听我哏的一声，就一齐下手。”群魔各各领命讫。</p>

<p>这妖王复转身到于里面，对行者当面又拜。行者道：“孩儿，家无常礼，不须拜，但有甚话，只管说来。”妖王伏于地下道：“愚男一则请来奉献唐僧之肉，二来有句话儿上请。我前日闲行，驾祥光，直至九霄空内，忽逢着祖延道龄张先生。”行者道：“可是做天师的张道龄么？”妖王道：“正是。”行者问曰：“有甚话说？”妖王道：“他见孩儿生得五官周正，三停平等，他问我是几年、那月、那日、那时出世，儿因年幼，记得不真。先生子平精熟，要与我推看五星，今请父王，正欲问此。倘或下次再得会他，好烦他推算。”行者闻言，坐在上面暗笑道：“好妖怪呀！老孙自归佛果，保唐师父，一路上也捉了几个妖精，不似这厮克剥。他问我甚么家长礼短，少米无柴的话说，我也好信口捏脓答他。他如今问我生年月日，我却怎么知道！”好猴王，也十分乖巧，巍巍端坐中间，也无一些儿惧色，面上反喜盈盈的笑道：</p>

<p>“贤郎请起，我因年老，连日有事不遂心怀，把你生时果偶然忘了。且等到明日回家，问你母亲便知。”妖王道：“父王把我八个字时常不离口论说，说我有同天不老之寿，怎么今日一旦忘了！岂有此理！必是假的！”哏的一声，群妖枪刀簇拥，望行者没头没脸的札来。这大圣使金箍棒架住了，现出本象，对妖精道：“贤郎，你却没理。那里儿子好打爷的？”那妖王满面羞惭。</p>

<p>不敢回视。行者化金光，走出他的洞府。小妖道：“大王，孙行者走了。”妖王道：“罢罢罢！让他走了罢！我吃他这一场亏也！</p>

<p>且关了门，莫与他打话，只来刷洗唐僧，蒸吃便罢。”</p>

<p>却说那行者搴着铁棒，呵呵大笑，自涧那边而来。沙僧听见，急出林迎着道：“哥啊，这半日方回，如何这等哂笑，想救出师父来也？”行者道：“兄弟，虽不曾救得师父，老孙却得个上风来了。”沙僧道：“甚么上风？”行者道：“原来猪八戒被那怪假变观音哄将回来，吊于皮袋之内。我欲设法救援，不期他着甚么六健将去请老大王来吃师父肉。是老孙想着他老大王必是牛魔王，就变了他的模样，充将进去，坐在中间。他叫父王，我就应他；他便叩头，我就直受，着实快活！果然得了上风！”沙僧道：“哥啊，你便图这般小便宜，恐师父性命难保。”行者道：“不须虑，等我去请菩萨来。”沙僧道：“你还腰疼哩。”行者道：“我不疼了。古人云，人逢喜事精神爽。你看着行李马匹，等我去。”</p>

<p>沙僧道：“你置下仇了，恐他害我师父。你须快去快来。”行者道：“我来得快，只消顿饭时，就回来矣。”</p>

<p>好大圣，说话间躲离了沙僧，纵筋斗云，径投南海。在那半空里，那消半个时辰，望见普陀山景。须臾按下云头，直至落伽崖上，端肃正行，只见二十四路诸天迎着道：“大圣，那里去？”</p>

<p>行者作礼毕，道：“要见菩萨。”诸天道：“少停，容通报。”时有鬼子母诸天来潮音洞外报道：“菩萨得知，孙悟空特来参见。”菩萨闻报，即命进去。大圣敛衣皈命，捉定步，径入里边，见菩萨倒身下拜。菩萨道：“悟空，你不领金蝉子西方求经去，却来此何干？”行者道：“上告菩萨，弟子保护唐僧前行，至一方，乃号山枯松涧火云洞。有一个红孩儿妖精，唤作圣婴大王，把我师父摄去，是弟子与猪悟能等寻至门前，与他交战。他放出三昧火来，我等不能取胜，救不出师父。急上东洋大海，请到四海龙王，施雨水，又不能胜火，把弟子都熏坏了，几乎丧了残生。”菩萨道：“既他是三昧火，神通广大，怎么去请龙王，不来请我？”</p>

<p>行者道：“本欲来的，只是弟子被烟熏了，不能驾云，却教猪八戒来请菩萨。”菩萨道：“悟能不曾来呀。”行者道：“正是。未曾到得宝山，被那妖精假变做菩萨模样，把猪八戒又赚入洞中，现吊在一个皮袋里，也要蒸吃哩。”菩萨听说，心中大怒道：“那泼妖敢变我的模样！”恨了一声，将手中宝珠净瓶往海心里扑的一掼，唬得那行者毛骨竦然，即起身侍立下面，道：“这菩萨火性不退，好是怪老孙说的话不好，坏了他的德行，就把净瓶掼了。可惜！可惜！早知送了我老孙，却不是一件大人事？”说不了，只见那海当中，翻波跳浪，钻出个瓶来，原来是一个怪物驮着出来。行者仔细看那驮瓶的怪物，怎生模样：根源出处号帮泥，水底增光独显威。世隐能知天地性，安藏偏晓鬼神机。藏身一缩无头尾，展足能行快似飞。文王画卦曾元卜，常纳庭台伴伏羲。云龙透出千般俏，号水推波把浪吹。条条金线穿成甲，点点装成彩玳瑁。九宫八卦袍披定，散碎铺遮绿灿衣。生前好勇龙王幸，死后还驮佛祖碑。要知此物名和姓，兴风作浪恶乌龟。那龟驮着净瓶，爬上崖边，对菩萨点头二十四点，权为二十四拜。行者见了，暗笑道：“原来是看瓶的，想是不见瓶，就问他要。”菩萨道：“悟空，你在下面说甚么？”行者道：“没说甚么。”</p>

<p>菩萨教：“拿上瓶来。”这行者即去拿瓶，唉！莫想拿得他动。好便似蜻蜓撼石柱，怎生摇得半分毫？行者上前跪下道：“菩萨，弟子拿不动。”菩萨道：“你这猴头，只会说嘴，瓶儿你也拿不动，怎么去降妖缚怪？”行者道：“不瞒菩萨说，平日拿得动，今日拿不动。想是吃了妖精亏，筋力弱了。”菩萨道：“常时是个空瓶，如今是净瓶抛下海去，这一时间，转过了三江五湖，八海四渎，溪源潭洞之间，共借了一海水在里面。你那里有架海的斤量？此所以拿不动也。”行者合掌道：“是弟子不知。”那菩萨走上前，将右手轻轻的提起净瓶，托在左手掌上。只见那龟点点头，钻下水去了。行者道：“原来是个养家看瓶的夯货！”菩萨坐定道：“悟空，我这瓶中甘露水浆，比那龙王的私雨不同，能灭那妖精的三昧火。待要与你拿了去，你却拿不动；待要着善财龙女与你同去，你却又不是好心，专一只会骗人。你见我这龙女貌美，净瓶又是个宝物，你假若骗了去，却那有工夫又来寻你？你须是留些甚么东西作当。”行者道：“可怜！菩萨这等多心，我弟子自秉沙门，一向不干那样事了。你教我留些当头，却将何物？我身上这件绵布直裰，还是你老人家赐的。这条虎皮裙子，能值几个铜钱？这根铁棒，早晚却要护身。但只是头上这个箍儿，是个金的，却又被你弄了个方法儿长在我头上，取不下来。你今要当头，情愿将此为当，你念个松箍儿咒，将此除去罢，不然，将何物为当？”菩萨道：“你好自在啊！我也不要你的衣服、铁棒、金箍，只将你那脑后救命的毫毛拔一根与我作当罢。”行者道：“这毫毛，也是你老人家与我的。但恐拔下一根，就拆破群了，又不能救我性命。”菩萨骂道：“你这猴子！你便一毛也不拔，教我这善财也难舍。”行者笑道：“菩萨，你却也多疑。正是不看僧面看佛面，千万救我师父一难罢！”那菩萨逍遥欣喜下莲台，云步香飘上石崖。只为圣僧遭障害，要降妖怪救回来。孙大圣十分欢喜，请观音出了潮音仙洞。诸天大神都列在普陀岩上。菩萨道：“悟空过海。”行者躬身道：“请菩萨先行。”菩萨道：“你先过去。”行者磕头道：“弟子不敢在菩萨面前施展。若驾筋斗云啊，掀露身体，恐菩萨怪我不敬。”菩萨闻言，即着善财龙女去莲花池里，劈一瓣莲花，放在石岩下边水上，教行者：“你上那莲花瓣儿，我渡你过海。”行者见了道：“菩萨，这花瓣儿，又轻又薄，如何载得我起！这一躧翻跌下水去，却不湿了虎皮裙？走了硝，天冷怎穿！”菩萨喝道：“你且上去看！”行者不敢推辞，舍命往上跳。果然先见轻小，到上面比海船还大三分，行者欢喜道：“菩萨，载得我了。”菩萨道：“既载得，如何不过去？”行者道：“又没了篙桨篷桅，怎生得过？”菩萨道：“不用。”只把他一口气吹开吸拢，又着实一口气，吹过南洋苦海，得登彼岸。行者却脚躧实地，笑道：“这菩萨卖弄神通，把老孙这等呼来喝去，全不费力也！”</p>

<p>那菩萨吩咐概众诸天各守仙境，着善财龙女闭了洞门，他却纵祥云，躲离普陀岩，到那边叫：“惠岸何在？”惠岸乃托塔李天王第二个太子，俗名木叉是也，乃菩萨亲传授的徒弟，不离左左，称为护法惠岸行者，即对菩萨合掌伺候。菩萨道：“你快上界去，见你父王，问他借王罡刀来一用。”惠岸道：“师父用着几何？”菩萨道：“全副都要。”惠岸领命，即驾云头，径入南天门里，到云楼宫殿，见父王下拜。天王见了，问：“儿从何来？”木叉道：“师父是孙悟空请来降妖，着儿拜上父王，将天罡刀借了一用。”天王即唤哪吒将刀取三十六把，递与木叉。木叉对哪吒说：“兄弟，你回去多拜上母亲：我事紧急，等送刀来再磕头罢。”忙忙相别，按落祥光，径至南海，将刀捧与菩萨。菩萨接在手中，抛将去，念个咒语，只见那刀化作一座千叶莲台。菩萨纵身上去，端坐在中间。行者在旁暗笑道：“这菩萨省使俭用，那莲花池里有五色宝莲台，舍不得坐将来，却又问别人去借。”菩萨道：“悟空休言语，跟我来也。”却才都驾着云头，离了海上。</p>

<p>白鹦哥展翅前飞，孙大圣与惠岸随后。</p>

<p>顷刻间，早见一座山头，行者道：“这山就是号山了。从此处到那妖精门首，约摸有四百余里。”菩萨闻言，即命住下祥云，在那山头上念一声“唵”字咒语，只见那山左山右，走出许多神鬼，却乃是本山土地众神，都到菩萨宝莲座下磕头。菩萨道：“汝等俱莫惊张，我今来擒此魔王。你与我把这团围打扫干净，要三百里远近地方，不许一个生灵在地。将那窝中小兽，窟内雏虫，都送在巅峰之上安生。”众神遵依而退。须臾间，又来回复，菩萨道：“既然干净，俱各回祠。”遂把净瓶扳倒，唿喇喇倾出水来，就如雷响。真个是：漫过山头，冲开石壁。漫过山头如海势，冲开石壁似汪洋。黑雾涨天全水气，沧波影日幌寒光。</p>

<p>遍崖冲玉浪，满海长金莲。菩萨大展降魔法，袖中取出定身禅。</p>

<p>化做落伽仙景界，真如南海一般般。秀蒲挺出昙花嫩，香草舒开贝叶鲜。紫竹几竿鹦鹉歇，青松数簇鹧鸪喧。万迭波涛连四野，只闻风吼水漫天。孙大圣见了，暗中赞叹道：“果然是一个大慈大悲的菩萨！若老孙有此法力，将瓶儿望山一倒，管甚么禽兽蛇虫哩！”菩萨叫：“悟空，伸手过来。”行者即忙敛袖，将左手伸出。菩萨拔杨柳枝，蘸甘露，把他手心里写一个迷字，教他：“捏着拳头，快去与那妖精索战，许败不许胜。败将来我这跟前，我自有法力收他。”行者领命，返云光，径来至洞口，一只手使拳，一只手使棒，高叫道：“妖怪开门！”那些小妖，又进去报道：“孙行者又来了！”妖王道：“紧关了门！莫睬他！”行者叫道：“好儿子！把老子赶在门外，还不开门！”小妖又报道：“孙行者骂出那话儿来了！”妖王只教：“莫睬他！”行者叫两次，见不开门，心中大怒，举铁棒，将门一下打了一个窟窿。慌得那小妖跌将进去道：“孙行者打破门了！”妖王见报几次，又听说打破前门，急纵身跳将出去，挺长枪，对行者骂道：“这猴子，老大不识起倒！我让你得些便宜，你还不知尽足，又来欺我！打破我门，你该个甚么罪名？”行者道：“我儿，你赶老子出门，你该个甚么罪名？”那妖王羞怒，绰长枪劈胸便刺；这行者举铁棒，架隔相还。一番搭上手，斗经四五个回合，行者捏着拳头，拖着棒，败将下来。那妖王立在山前道：“我要刷洗唐僧去哩！”行者道：“好儿子，天看着你哩！你来！”那妖精闻言，愈加嗔怒，喝一声，赶到面前，挺枪又刺。这行者轮棒又战几合，败阵又走。那妖王骂道：“猴子，你在前有二三十合的本事，你怎么如今正斗时就要走了，何也？”行者笑道：“贤郎，老子怕你放火。”妖精道：“我不放火了，你上来。”行者道：“既不放火，走开些，好汉子莫在家门前打人。”那妖精不知是诈，真个举枪又赶。行者拖了棒，放了拳头，那妖王着了迷乱，只情追赶。前走的如流星过度，后走的如弩箭离弦。</p>

<p>不一时，望见那菩萨了。行者道：“妖精，我怕你了，你饶我罢。你如今赶至南海观音菩萨处，怎么还不回去？”那妖王不信，咬着牙，只管赶来。行者将身一幌，藏在那菩萨的神光影里。这妖精见没了行者，走近前，睁圆眼，对菩萨道：“你是孙行者请来的救兵么？”菩萨不答应。妖王拈转长枪喝道：“咄！你是孙行者请来的救兵么？”菩萨也不答应。妖精望菩萨劈心刺一枪来，那菩萨化道金光，径走上九霄空内。行者跟定道：“菩萨，你好欺伏我罢了！那妖精再三问你，你怎么推聋装哑，不敢做声，被他一枪搠走了，却把那个莲台都丢下耶！”菩萨只教：</p>

<p>“莫言语，看他再要怎的。”此时行者与木叉俱在空中，并肩同看。只见那妖呵呵冷笑道：“泼猴头，错认了我也！他不知把我圣婴当作个甚人。几番家战我不过，又去请个甚么脓包菩萨来，却被我一枪，搠得无形无影去了，又把个宝莲台儿丢了，且等我上去坐坐。”好妖精，他也学菩萨，盘手盘脚的，坐在当中。</p>

<p>行者看见道：“好！好！好！莲花台儿好送人了！”菩萨道：“悟空，你又说甚么？”行者道：“说甚？说甚？莲台送了人了！”那妖精坐放臀下，终不得你还要哩？”菩萨道：“正要他坐哩。”行者道：“他的身躯小巧，比你还坐得稳当。”菩萨叫：“莫言语，且看法力。”他将杨柳枝往下指定，叫一声“退！”只见那莲台花彩俱无，祥光尽散，原来那妖王坐在刀尖之上。即命木叉：“使降妖杵，把刀柄儿打打去来。”那木叉按下云头，将降魔杵，如筑墙一般，筑了有千百余下。那妖精，穿通两腿刀尖出，血流成汪皮肉开。好怪物，你看他咬着牙，忍着痛，且丢了长枪，用手将刀乱拔。行者却道：“菩萨啊，那怪物不怕痛，还拔刀哩。”菩萨见了，唤上木叉，“且莫伤他生命。”却又把杨柳枝垂下，念声“唵”字咒语，那天罡刀都变做倒须钩儿，狼牙一般，莫能褪得。那妖精却才慌了，扳着刀尖，痛声苦告道：“菩萨，我弟子有眼无珠，不识你广大法力。千乞垂慈，饶我性命！再不敢恃恶，愿入法门戒行也。”菩萨闻言，却与二行者、白鹦哥低下金光，到了妖精面前，问道：“你可受吾戒行么？”妖王点头滴泪道：“若饶性命，愿受戒行。”菩萨道：“你可入我门么？”妖王道：“果饶性命，愿入法门。”菩萨道：“既如此，我与你摩顶受戒。”就袖中取出一把金剃头刀儿，近前去，把那怪分顶剃了几刀，剃作一个太山压顶，与他留下三个顶搭，挽起三个窝角揪儿。行者在旁笑道：“这妖精大晦气！弄得不男不女，不知象个甚么东西！”菩萨道：“你今既受我戒，我却也不慢你，称你做善财童子，如何？”</p>

<p>那妖点头受持，只望饶命。菩萨却用手一指，叫声“退！”撞的一声，天罡刀都脱落尘埃，那童子身躯不损。菩萨叫：“惠岸，你将刀送上天宫，还你父王，莫来接我，先到普陀岩会众诸天等候。”那木叉领命，送刀上界，回海不题。</p>

<p>却说那童子野性不定，见那腿疼处不疼，臀破处不破，头挽了三个揪儿，他走去绰起长枪，望菩萨道：“那里有甚真法力降我！原来是个掩样术法儿！不受甚戒，看枪！”望菩萨劈脸刺来。恨得个行者轮铁棒要打，菩萨只叫：“莫打，我自有惩治。”</p>

<p>却又袖中取出一个金箍儿来道：“这宝贝原是我佛如来赐我往东土寻取经人的金紧禁三个箍儿。紧箍儿，先与你戴了，禁箍儿，收了守山大神，这个金箍儿，未曾舍得与人，今观此怪无礼，与他罢。”好菩萨，将箍儿迎风一幌，叫声“变！”即变作五个箍儿，望童子身上抛了去，喝声“着！”一个套在他头顶上，两个套在他左右手上，两个套在他左右脚上。菩萨道：“悟空，走开些，等我念念《金箍儿咒》。”行者慌了道：“菩萨呀，请你来此降妖，如何却要咒我？”菩萨道：“这篇咒，不是《紧箍儿咒》咒你的，是《金箍儿咒》咒那童子的。”行者却才放心，紧随左右，听得他念咒。菩萨捻着诀，默默的念了几遍，那妖精搓耳揉腮，攒蹄打滚。正是：一句能通遍沙界，广大无边法力深。毕竟不知那童子怎的皈依，且听下回分解。</p>
