<P>In the arithmetic of the universe, 129,600 years make one cycle. Each cycle can be divided into twelve phases: I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI and XII, the twelve branches. Each phase lasts 10,800 years.</p>
<P>Now within a single day, the positive begins at the time I; at II the cock crows; at III it is not quite light; at IV the sun rises; V is after breakfast; and at VI one does business. VII is when the sun reaches noon; at VIII it is slipping towards the West; IX is late afternoon; the sun sets at X; XI is dusk; and at XII people settle down for the night.</p>
<P>If you compare this with the big numbers, then at the end of Phase XI Heaven and Earth were still one, and no beings had appeared. 5,400 years later came the beginning of Phase XII, when all was darkness and there were still no people or other creatures; for this reason it was called Chaos. Another 5,400 years later Phase XII was drawing to a close and a new cycle was about to begin. As Phase I of the new era approached, gradually there was light. As Shao Yong said,</p>
<div class="poet">
<P>&#8220;When winter reaches the mid-point of Phase I</P>
<P>The heart of Heaven does not move.</P>
<P>Where the Positive first appears</P>
<P>Nothing has yet come to life.&#8221;</p>
	</div>
<P>At this time, Heaven first had a foundation. 5,400 years later, in the middle of Phase I, the light and pure rose upwards, and sun, moon, stars, and <a href="#" title="美 [.kɑnstə'leɪʃ(ə)n] 英 [.kɒnstə'leɪʃ(ə)n] n.星座；一系列（相关的想法、事物）；一群（相关的人）">constellations</a> were created. These were called the Four Images. Hence the saying that heaven began in I.</p>
<P>Another 5,400 years later, when Phase I was nearing its end and Phase II was imminent, things gradually solidified. As the<I> Book of Changes</I> says, &#8220;Great is the Positive; far-reaching is the Negative! All things are endowed and born in accordance with Heaven.&#8221; This was when the earth began to congeal. After 5,400 more years came the height of Phase II, when the heavy and impure solidified, and water, fire, mountains, stone, and Earth came into being. These five were called the Five Movers. Therefore it is said that the Earth was created in Phase II.</p>
<P>After a further 5,400 years, at the end of Phase II and the beginning of the Phase III, living beings were created. In the words of the<I> Book of the Calendar, &#8221;</I>The essence of the sky came down and the essence of earth went up. Heaven and Earth intermingled, and all creatures were born.&#8221; Then Heaven was bright and Earth was fresh, and the Positive intermingled with the Negative. 5,400 years later, when Phase III was at its height, men, birds and beasts were created. Thus the Three Powers&#8212;Heaven, Earth and Man&#8212;now had their set places. Therefore it is said that man was created in Phase III.</p>

<p>再五千四百岁，正当丑会，重浊下凝，有水有火有山有石有土。水火山石土，谓之五形。故曰地辟于丑。又经五千四百岁，丑会终而寅会之初，发生万物。历曰：“天气下降，地气上升；天地交合，群物皆生。”至此，天清地爽，阴阳交合。</p>

<P>Moved by Pan Gu's creation, the Three Emperors put the world in order and the Five Rulers laid down the moral code. The world was then divided into four great continents: The Eastern Continent of Superior Body, the Western Continent of Cattle-gift, the Southern Continent of <a href="#" title="Jambu

">Jambu</a> and the Northern Continent of Kuru. This book deals only with the Eastern Continent of Superior Body. Beyond the seas there is a country called Aolai. This country is next to an ocean, and in the middle of the ocean is a famous island called the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. This mountain is the ancestral artery of the Ten Continents, the origin of the Three Islands; it was formed when the clear and impure were separated and the Enormous Vagueness was divided. It is a really splendid mountain and there are some verses to prove it:</p>

<P>There was once a magic stone on the top of this mountain which was thirty-six feet five inches high and twenty-four feet round. It was thirty-six feet five inches high to correspond with the 365 degrees of the heavens, and twenty-four feet round to match the twenty-four divisions of the solar calendar. On top of it were nine <a href="#" title="美 ['æpərtʃər] 英 ['æpə(r)tʃə(r)] n.缝隙；小孔；（尤指摄影机等的光圈）孔径
网络口径；开口；隙缝

网络经卦；卦象；转八卦
>Trigrams</a>. There were no trees around it to give shade, but magic fungus and orchids clung to its sides. Ever since Creation began it had been receiving the truth of Heaven, the beauty of Earth, the essence of the Sun and the splendour of the Moon; and as it had been influenced by them for so long it had miraculous powers. It developed a magic womb, which burst open one day to produce a stone egg about the size of a ball.</p>

<P>When the wind blew on this egg it turned into a stone monkey, complete with the five senses and four limbs. When the stone monkey had learned to crawl and walk, he bowed to each of the four quarters. As his eyes moved, two beams of golden light shot towards the Pole Star palace and startled the Supreme Heavenly Sage, the Greatly Compassionate Jade Emperor of the Azure Vault of Heaven, who was sitting surrounded by his immortal ministers on his throne in the Hall of Miraculous Mist in the Golden-gated Cloud Palace. When he saw the dazzling golden light he ordered Thousand-mile Eye and Wind-accompanying Ear to open the Southern Gate of Heaven and take a look. The two officers went out through the gate in obedience to the imperial command, and while one observed what was going on the other listened carefully. Soon afterwards they reported back:</p>

<P>&#8220;In obedience to the Imperial Mandate your subjects observed and listened to the source of the golden light. We found that at the edge of the country of Aolai, which is East of the ocean belonging to the Eastern Continent of Superior Body, there is an island called the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. A magic stone on the top of this mountain produced a magic egg, and when the wind blew on this egg it turned into a stone monkey which bowed to each of the four quarters. When he moved his eyes, golden light shot towards the Pole Star Palace; but now that he is eating and drinking, the golden light is gradually dying.&#8221;</p>

<P>In his benevolence and mercy the Jade Emperor said, &#8220;Creatures down below are born of the essence of heaven and earth: there is nothing remarkable about him.&#8221;</P>

<p>那座山正当顶上，有一块仙石。其石有三丈六尺五寸高，有二丈四尺围圆。三丈六尺五寸高，按周天三百六十五度；二丈四尺围圆，按政历二十四气。上有九窍八孔，按九宫八卦。四面更无树木遮阴，左右倒有芝兰相衬。盖自开辟以来，每受天真地秀，日精月华，感之既久，遂有灵通之意。内育仙胞。一日迸裂，产一石卵，似圆球样大。因见风，化作一个石猴。五官俱备，四肢皆全。便就学爬学走，拜了四方。目运两道金光，射冲斗府。惊动高天上圣大慈仁者玉皇大天尊玄穹高上帝，驾座金阙云宫灵霄宝殿，聚集仙卿，见有金光焰焰，即命千里眼、顺风耳开南天门观看。二将果奉旨出门外，看的真，听的明。</p>

<P>On his mountain the monkey was soon able to run and jump, feed from plants and trees, drink from brooks and springs, pick mountain flowers and look for fruit. He made friends with the wolves, went around with the tigers and leopards, was on good terms with the deer, and had the other monkeys and apes for relations. At night he slept under the rockfaces, and he roamed around the peaks and caves by day. As the saying so rightly goes, &#8220;There is no calendar in the mountains, and when winter's over you don't know the time of year.&#8221; On hot mornings he and all the other monkeys would play under the shade of some pines to avoid the heat.

On the tablet had been carved in big square letters: HAPPY LAND OF THE MOUNTAIN OF FLOWERS AND FRUIT, CAVE HEAVEN OF THE WATER CURTAIN. The stone monkey was beside himself with glee. He rushed away, shut his eyes, crouched, and leapt back through the waterfall.</P>
<P>&#8220;We're in luck, we're in luck,&#8221; he said with a chuckle. All the other monkeys crowded round him asking, &#8220;What's it like in there? How deep is the water?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no water, none at all,&#8221; replied the stone monkey. &#8220;There's an iron bridge, and on the other side of the bridge there's a house that must have been made by Heaven and Earth.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How ever could you see a house there?&#8221; the other monkeys asked. The stone monkey chuckled again.</P>
<P>&#8220;The water here comes under the bridge and through the rocks, and it hides the gateway to the bridge from view. There are flowers and trees by the bridge, and a stone house too. Inside the house are stone rooms, a stone stove, stone bowls, stone plates, stone beds, and even stone benches. In the middle of it all is a tablet which says 'Happy Land of the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit, Cave Heaven of the Water Curtain'.

<P>The other monkeys were all so delighted to hear this that they said, &#8220;You go first and take us with you.&#8221;</P>
<P>The stone monkey shut his eyes, crouched, and leapt in again, shouting, &#8220;Follow me in, follow me in.&#8221; The braver monkeys all jumped through. The more timid ones peered forward, shrank back, rubbed their ears, scratched their cheeks, shouted, and yelled at the top of their voices, before going in, all clinging to each other. After rushing across the bridge they all grabbed plates and snatched bowls, bagged stoves and fought over beds, and moved everything around. Monkeys are born naughty and they could not keep quiet for a single moment until they had worn themselves out moving things around.</P>
<P>The stone monkey sat himself in the main seat and said, &#8220;Gentlemen, A man who breaks his word is worthless. Just now you said that if anyone was clever enough to come in here and get out again in one piece, you'd make him king. Well, then. I've come in and gone out, and gone out and come in. I've found you gentlemen a cave heaven where you can sleep in peace and all settle down to live in bliss.

<P>The Handsome Monkey King's innocent high spirits could not, of course, last three or four hundred years. One day he suddenly felt depressed during a banquet with his monkey host, and he started to weep. The startled monkeys crowded round, bowed to him and asked, &#8220;What's the matter, Your Majesty?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Although I'm happy now,&#8221; the Monkey King replied, &#8220;I'm worried about the future. That's what's getting me down.&#8221;</p>
<P>The other monkeys laughed and said, &#8220;Your Majesty is being greedy. We have parties every day; we live in a mountain paradise, in an ancient cave in a divine continent. We are spared the rule of unicorns, the domination of phoenixes, and the restraints of human kings. We are free to do just as we like&#8212;we are infinitely lucky. Why make yourself miserable worrying about the future?&#8221;</P>
<P>To this the Monkey King replied, &#8220;Yes, we don't have to submit to the laws and regulations of human kings, and we don't live in terror of the power of birds and beasts. But the time will come when we are old and weak, and the underworld is controlled by the King of Hell. When the time comes for us to die, we won't be able to go on living among the Blessed, and our lives will have been in vain.&#8221; All the monkeys covered their faces and wept as everyone of them thought about death.</P>
<P>Suddenly a gibbon jumped out from their ranks and shrieked in a piercing voice, &#8220;If Your Majesty is thinking so far ahead, this is the beginning of enlightenment. Now of the Five Creatures, there are only three that do not come under the jurisdiction of the King of Hell.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do you know which they are?&#8221; asked the Monkey King.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the ape replied. &#8220;They are the Buddhas, the Immortals and the Sages. They are free from the Wheel of Reincarnation. They are not born and they do not die. They are as eternal as Heaven and Earth, as the mountains and the rivers.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where do they live?&#8221; the Monkey King asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Only in the human world,&#8221; the ape replied, &#8220;in ancient caves on magic mountains.&#8221; The Monkey King was delighted to hear this.</P>
<P>&#8220;I shall leave you all tomorrow,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and go down the mountain. If I have to, I'll roam the corners of the oceans and go to the edge of the sky to find these three kinds of beings and discover the secret of eternal youth that will keep us out of the clutches of the King of Hell for ever.&#8221; Goodness! Because of these words he was to learn how to be free from the Wheel of Reincarnation and become the Great Sage Equaling Heaven.</P>
<P>All the monkeys clapped with approval and said, &#8220;Great! Great! Tomorrow we'll climb all over the mountain and get lots of fruit to give Your Majesty a really big banquet to send you off.&#8221;</P>

<P>He had chosen just the right time for his journey. After he boarded his raft the Southeasterly wind blew hard for days on end and bore him to the Northwestern shore of the Southern Continent. Testing the depth of the water with his pole he found that it was shallow, so he abandoned the raft and jumped ashore. He saw humans by the coast, fishing, hunting geese, gathering clams, and extracting salt. He went up to them, leaping around and making faces, which so scared them that they dropped their baskets and nets and fled in all directions as fast as they could. The Monkey King grabbed one of them who was a poor runner, stripped him of his clothes, and dressed himself in them like a human. He swaggered through the provinces and prefectures, learning human behavior and human speech in the market places. Whether he was eating his breakfast or going to bed at nigh he was always asking about Buddhas, Immortals and Sages, and seeking the secret of eternal youth.

<P>The Monkey King went closer and called to him. &#8220;Old Immortal, your disciple greets you.&#8221;</P>
<P>The woodcutter dropped his axe in astonishment and turned round to say, &#8220;No, no. I don't even have enough to eat or drink, so how can I possibly let you call me an Immortal?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you're not an Immortal,&#8221; the Monkey King said, &#8220;why do you talk like one?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I don't talk like an Immortal,&#8221; the woodcutter said.</P>
<P>&#8220;At the edge of the wood just now,&#8221; the Monkey King replied, &#8220;I heard you say, 'The people I meet are Taoists and Immortals, sitting quietly and expounding the<I> Mantingfang.'</I> The<I> Mantingfang</I> contains the truth about the Way, so if you're not an Immortal, what are you?&#8221; The woodcutter laughed.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's quite true that the song is called 'The Fragrance of the<I> Mantingfang,'</I> and an Immortal who lives near my hut taught me it. He said he saw how hard I had to work and how I was always worried, so he made me sing this song when things were getting me down. It lightens my cares and makes me forget my weariness. I was singing it just now because I had some problems on my mind, and I never imagined that you would be listening.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you've got an Immortal for a neighbour, you ought to learn from him how to cultivate your conduct and get him to teach you a recipe for eternal youth.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've had a hard life,&#8221; the woodcutter replied. &#8220;My mother and father brought me up till I was about eight, and just when I was beginning to know about life my father died. My mother remained a widow, and I had no brothers or sisters. As I was the only child I had to look after my mother morning and night. Now she is old that I can't possibly leave her. Our land is so overgrown that I can't grow enough to feed and clothe both of us, so I have to cut a couple of bundles of firewood to sell in the market for a handful of coppers to buy the few pints of rice that I cook for myself and for my mother. That's why I can't cultivate my conduct.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;From what you say,&#8221; the Monkey King replied, &#8220;you're a filial son and a gentleman&#8212;you're bound to be rewarded for it one day. But I'd be grateful if you could show me where that Immortal lives, so that I can go and pay him my respects.&#8221;</P>
<P>The woodcutter said, &#8220;It's not far from here. This mountain is the Spirit Tower Heart Mountain, and in it there is the Cave of the Setting Moon and the Three Stars. In that cave lives an Immortal called the <a href="#" title="Patriarch英 [ ˈpeɪtriɑ:k ] 美 [ ˈpeɪtriɑrk ] 
n. 家长，族长，元老，（特指）犹太民族的祖先; 创始人，鼻祖 
">Patriarch</a> Subhuti. I don't know how many disciples he has trained&#8212;there are thirty or forty of them cultivating their conduct with him at the moment. If you take that path South for two or three miles you'll reach his home.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Monkey King tugged at the woodcutter and said, &#8220;Take me there, Elder Brother. If I get anything out of this, I won't forget your kindness.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You idiot,&#8221; the woodcutter replied, &#8220;didn't you understand what I told you just now? If I went with you I wouldn't be able to earn my living, and who would look after my poor old mother then? I've got to get on with my woodcutting. Go by yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>猴王近前叫道：“老神仙，弟子起手！”那樵汉慌忙丢了斧，转身答礼道：“不当人，不当人！我拙汉衣食不全，怎敢当‘神仙’二字？”猴王道：“你不是神仙，如何说出神仙的话来？”樵夫道：“我说什么神仙话？”猴王道：“我才来至林边，只听的你说：‘相逢处，非仙即道，静坐讲《黄庭》。’《黄庭》乃道德真言，非神仙而何？”樵夫笑道：“实不瞒你说，这个词名做《满庭芳》，乃一神仙教我的。那神仙与我舍下相邻。他见我家事劳苦，日常烦恼，教我遇烦恼时，即把这词儿念念，一则散心，二则解困，我才有些不足处思虑，故此念念。不期被你听了。”猴王道：“你家既与神仙相邻，何不从他修行？学得个不老之方，却不是好？”樵夫道：“我一生命苦，自幼蒙父母养育至八九岁，才知人事，不幸父丧，母亲居孀。再无兄弟姊妹，只我一人，没奈何，早晚侍奉。如今母老，一发不敢抛离。却又田园荒芜，衣食不足，只得斫两束柴薪，挑向市廛之间，货几文钱，籴几升米，自炊自造，安排些茶饭，供养老母，所以不能修行。”猴王道：“据你说起来，乃是一个行孝的君子，向后必有好处。但望你指与我那神仙住处，却好拜访去也。”樵夫道：“不远，不远。此山叫做灵台方寸山，山中有座斜月三星洞，那洞中有一个神仙，称名须菩提祖师。那祖师出去的徒弟，也不计其数，见今还有三四十人从他修行。你顺那条小路儿，向南行七八里远近，即是他家了。”猴王用手扯住樵夫道：“老兄，你便同我去去，若还得了好处，决不忘你指引之恩。”樵夫道：“你这汉子，甚不通变。我方才这般与你说了，你还不省？假若我与你去了，却不误了我的生意？老母何人奉养？我要斫柴，你自去，自去。”</p>

<P>After hearing this the Monkey King had to take his leave. He came out of the forest and found the path, which led up a mountain slope for two or three miles, when he saw the cave. He pulled himself up to his full height to take a look, and it was a really magnificent place:</p>

<P>He saw that the doors of the cave were shut fast, and that everything was still, with no signs of any people. He turned round and noticed that there was a stone tablet about thirty feet high and eight feet wide at the top of the cliff. On it was carved in enormous letters: SPIRIT-TOWER HEART MOUNTAIN, CAVE OF THE SETTING MOON AND THE THREE STARS. The Monkey King exclaimed with delight, &#8220;The people here really are honest. The mountain and the cave do exist.&#8221; He took a good long look, but did not dare to knock on the door. He climbed to the and of a pine branch and ate some pine seeds to amuse himself.</p>

<P>When this boy had come out he shouted, &#8220;Who's making that row out here?&#8221;</P>
<P>The Monkey King scampered down the tree, went up to him, and said with a bow, &#8220;Immortal child, I am a disciple who has come to ask about the Way and study under the Immortal. The last thing I'd do would be to make a row here?&#8221; The boy laughed.</P>
<P>&#8220;So you've come to ask about the Way, have you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the Monkey King replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Our master has just got up,&#8221; the boy said, &#8220;and has now mounted the dais to expound the Way. Before he had started to explain about origins he told me to open the door. He said, 'There is someone outside who wants to cultivate his conduct. Go and welcome him.' I suppose he must have meant you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, he meant me,&#8221; the Monkey King said with a smile.</P>

<P>As soon as the Handsome Monkey King saw him he bowed low and knocked his head on the ground before him many times, saying, &#8220;Master, master, your disciple pays his deepest respects.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you from?&#8221; the Patriarch asked. &#8220;You must tell me your name and address before you can become my pupil.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I come from the Water Curtain Cave in the Flowers and Fruit Mountain in the land of Aolai in the Eastern Continent of Superior Body,&#8221; replied the Monkey King.</P>
<P>&#8220;Throw him out,&#8221; the Patriarch roared. &#8220;He's a liar and a cheat, and even if he tried cultivating his conduct he would get nowhere.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Monkey King desperately kept hitting his head on the ground and said, &#8220;Your disciple spoke the truth. I promise I wasn't lying.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Patriarch asked, &#8220;If you were speaking the truth, why did you say that you came from the Eastern Continent of Superior Body? Between here and the Eastern Continent there are two seas and the Southern Jambu Continent, so how could you possibly have come here from there?&#8221;</P>
<P>The Monkey King, still kowtowing, replied, &#8220;I sailed across seas and oceans, crossed frontiers and wandered through many countries for over ten years before I arrived here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So you came here by stages,&#8221; the Patriarch remarked. &#8220;What is your surname?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm not surly,&#8221; the Monkey King replied. &#8220;If people call me names it doesn't bother me, and if they hit me I don't get angry. I'm just polite to them and that's that. I've never been surly.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I didn't ask if you were surly. I wanted to know the surname you inherited from your parents.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I didn't have any parents,&#8221; the Monkey King replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you had no parents, did you grow on a tree?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I grew not on a tree but in a stone,&#8221; the Monkey King replied. &#8220;All I remember is that there was a magic stone on the top of the Flower and Fruit Mountain, and that one year the stone split open and I was born.&#8221;</P>
<P>Concealing his delight at searing this, the Patriarch remarked, &#8220;In other words, you were born of Heaven and Earth. Walk around for a moment and let me have a look at you.&#8221; The Monkey King leapt to his feet and shambled round a couple of times.</p>

<P>The Patriarch smiled and said, &#8220;Though you have rather a base sort of body, you look like one of the rhesus monkeys that eat pine seeds, and I ought to give you a surname that fits your appearance and call you Hu ('Macaque'). The elements that make up the character Hu are 'animal,' 'old' and 'moon'. What is old is ancient, and the moon embodies the Negative principle, and what is ancient and Negative cannot be transformed. But I think I would do much better to call you Sun ('Monkey'). Apart from the 'animal' element, the character Sun has one part implying male and one part suggesting a baby, which fits in with my basic theories about children. Your surname will be Sun.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the Monkey King heard this he kowtowed with delight and said, &#8220;Great! Great! Now I have a surname. I am eternally grateful to you for your mercy and compassion, master. I beg you to give me a personal name to go with my new surname, then it will be much easier to address me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There are twelve words within my sect,&#8221; said the Patriarch, &#8220;which I give as names. You belong to the tenth generation of my disciples.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What are these twelve words?&#8221; asked the Monkey King.</P>
<P>&#8220;Broad, great, wisdom, intelligence, true, likeness, nature, sea, bright, awakened, complete and enlightenment. If we work out the generations of disciples, then you should have a name with Wu ('Awakened') in it. So we can give you the Dharma-name Sun Wukong, which means 'Monkey Awakened to Emptiness'. Will that do?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Marvellous, marvellous,&#8221; said the smiling Monkey King. &#8220;From now on my name will be Sun Wukong.&#8221; Indeed:</P>
