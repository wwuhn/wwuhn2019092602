<P>The Mind-Ape Recognizes a Monster in the Monastery</P>
<P>The Three Search for Their Master in Black Pine Forest</P>
</div>
<P>The story tells how Sanzang and his disciples came to the Meditation Monastery where they met the lamas and were given a vegetarian meal. When the four of them had eaten the girl was also fed. By now night was gradually falling and the lamp was lit in the abbot's lodgings. The lamas, who wanted to ask the Tang Priest about why he was going to fetch the scriptures and were also eager for a look at the girl, stood packed together in rows under the lamp. &#8220;Abbot,&#8221; said Sanzang to the lama he had first met, &#8220;when we leave your monastery tomorrow what will the road West be like?&#8221; Before answering, the lama fell to his knees. Sanzang quickly helped him up and said, &#8220;Stand up, please. Why do you greet me in this way when I ask about the road?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When you travel West tomorrow, reverend sir, you will find that the road is level,&#8221; the lama replied. &#8220;There is no need to worry. There is just one thing at present that is rather awkward. I wanted to tell you about it as soon as you came in, but I was afraid that it would offend your distinguished self. I only venture to tell you now that the meal is over that you will be most welcome to spend the night in the young lamas' room after your long, hard journey from the East. But it would not be right for the lady Bodhisattva to do so. I don't know where I should invite her to sleep.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your suspicions are not called for, abbot,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;and you should not suppose that my disciples and I have wicked ideas. When we were coming through Black Pine Forest this morning we found this girl tied to a tree. My disciple Sun Wukong refused to save her, but out of my enlightened heart I rescued her and have brought her here for you to put up, abbot.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As you have been so generous, reverend Father,&#8221; the abbot replied, &#8220;we can set out a straw mattress behind the devarajas in the Devaraja Hall for her to sleep on.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's splendid,&#8221; Sanzang said, &#8220;splendid.&#8221; After this the young lamas took the girl to sleep in the back of the hall while in the abbot's lodgings Sanzang urged the officials of the monastery to put themselves at their ease, whereupon they all dispersed.</P>
<P>&#8220;We have had a hard day,&#8221; Sanzang said to Brother Monkey. &#8220;We must go to bed early and be up early in the morning.&#8221; They all slept in the same room, guarding the master and not daring to leave him. Later that night</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The moon rose high and all was peaceful;</P>
<P>The Street of Heaven was quiet and nobody moved.</P>
<P>Bright was the Silver River; the stars shone clearly;</P>
<P>The drum in the tower hastened the changing watch.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We will say nothing more of the night. When Monkey rose at first light he told Pig and Friar Sand to get the luggage and the horse ready then urged the master to start out. But Sanzang wanted to sleep longer and would not wake up, so Monkey went up to him to call, &#8220;Master.&#8221;</P>
<P>The master raised his head but still could make no reply. &#8220;What will you say, Master?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why is my head spinning,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;why are my eyes swollen, and why an I aching all over from my skin to my bones?&#8221;</P>
<P>When Pig heard this he stretched out his hand to feel the master's body. It was feverish. &#8220;Now I understand,&#8221; said the idiot with a grin. &#8220;He had several bowls too many of last night's free rice and went to sleep head-down. It's indigestion.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; shouted Monkey, &#8220;Let me ask the master what's really the matter.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When I got up in the middle of the night to relieve myself,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;I did not put my hat on. I think I must have caught a chill in the wind.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm sure you're right,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;Can you travel now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I cannot even sit up,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;let alone mount the horse. The journey will have to wait.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a thing to say, Master,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;As the saying goes, 'A teacher for a day is one's father for life.' As your disciples we are like your sons. There's another saying that</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A son does not have to shit silver or gold;</P>
<P>As long as be can do what's needed he'll be fine.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you're not feeling well you shouldn't be worrying about the journey being delayed. There'll be no problem about waiting for a few days.&#8221; The three brother-disciples all looked after their master. The morning was followed by midday and dusk, and after a good night dawn returned. Time fled, and three days had soon passed.</P>
<P>The morning after that Sanzang tried to sit up, calling, &#8220;Wukong, as I have been very ill these last couple of days I have not asked you before: have people been giving food to the lady Bodhisattva we rescued?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What are you bothering about her for?&#8221; laughed Monkey, &#8220;What you should be concerned with is your own illness.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;Help me up and fetch me paper, brush and ink. Borrow an inkstone here in the monastery.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you want them for?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I want to write a letter,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;I shall seal it up with our passport and ask you to deliver it for me to His Majesty Emperor Taizong in Chang'an.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Easy,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;I may not be much good at anything else, but when it comes to delivering letters I'm the champion of the whole world. So wrap the letter up and give it to me. I'll take it to Chang'an in a single somersault, give it to the Tang Emperor, and come back with another somersault before your brush and inkstone have dried up. But why do you want to write a letter? Tell me what you want to say in the letter&#8212;you can write it down later.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is what I will write,&#8221; said Sanzang, weeping:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your subject beats his head three times upon the ground,</P>
<P>With a triple shout of 'Long live Your Majesty' as I bow to my lord.</P>
<P>The civil and military officials ate all present,</P>
<P>And four hundred courtiers all listen to what is said.</P>
<P>Years ago I left the East on your command,</P>
<P>Hoping to see the Buddha on the Vulture Peak.</P>
<P>But on my journey I have met with obstructions;</P>
<P>And been delayed by unexpected disaster along the way.</P>
<P>My illness is grave; I cannot move one step;</P>
<P>The gate to Buddha is as distant as the gate to heaven.</P>
<P>I will not live to bring back the scriptures;</P>
<P>I submit with respect that a new envoy should be sent.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he could not help bursting out into uproarious laughter. &#8220;You're hopeless, Master,&#8221; he said, &#8220;thinking that sort of thing after just a touch of illness. If you were seriously ill you'd only have to ask me to find out whether you were going to live or die. I have my own special way of dealing with it. I'd ask, 'Which king of the Underworld dared think of this? Which of the judges issued the warrant? Which demon messenger is coming to fetch him?' If they make me angry I'll lose my temper the way I did when I made havoc in Heaven, smash my way into the Underworld with my cudgel, capture the ten kings and rip the sinews out of every one of them. I'll show them no mercy.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop that boasting, disciple,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;I am very ill.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, going up to him, &#8220;it's very awkward to have the master saying he's in a bad way and you insisting he isn't. Let's settle things as quickly as we can, sell the horse, pawn the luggage, buy a coffin to bury the master in and split up.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're talking out of turn again, you idiot,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;What you don't realize is that the master used to be our Tathagata Buddha's second disciple. His original name was the Venerable Golden Cicada. This is great hardship he has to endure because he once slighted the Buddha's Dharma.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But, brother,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;even if the master did slight the Buddha's Dharma he was exiled to the East and born into another body amid the sea of right and wrong and the battlefield of tongues. He swore an oath to go to the Western Heaven, worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures. Every time he's met an evil spirit he's been tied up; and every time he's come across a monster he's been hung up. He's had to put up with every kind of agony. That should be enough. Why has he had to be ill as well?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is something you wouldn't know about,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;The master once dropped off to sleep instead of listening to the Buddha teaching the Dharma, and as he drowsed he trod on a grain of rice with his left foot. That is why he has to be ill for three days in the lower world.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So goodness only knows how many years someone who eats as messily as I do will have to be ill,&#8221; replied a shocked Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;the Buddha will spare ordinary creatures such as you. There's something else you don't know. As the poet said,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Hoeing millet in the noonday sun;</P>
<P>Sweat drops on the ground beneath the millet.</P>
<P>Who understands that of the food that's in the bowl,</P>
<P>Every single grain was won through bitter toil?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The master will only be ill today. Tomorrow he'll be better.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am feeling different today from how I did yesterday,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;My throat is absolutely parched. Go and find some cold water somewhere for me to drink.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Fine,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;If water's what you want, Master, that means you're better. I'll go and fetch some.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey at once took the begging bowl and went to the kitchen at the back of the monastery, where he came across all the monks red-eyed and sobbing with grief. The only thing was that they dared not cry aloud.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be so petty, little monks,&#8221; said Brother Monkey. &#8220;Before we leave we'll thank you for the days we've spent here, and we'll pay for our cooking fuel and lighting by the day. You really shouldn't be such pustules.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We wouldn't dare accept it,&#8221; the lamas said at once, falling to their knees, &#8220;we wouldn't dare.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean, you wouldn't dare?&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;It must be that long-snouted monk of ours who has an enormous appetite. He'd eat you out of house and home.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; the lamas replied, &#8220;there are over a hundred senior and junior lamas in this monastery. If each of us kept you for a single day we could afford to support you for over a hundred days. We're not the sort of skinflints who'd calculate what you will cost us in food.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you're not working out the cost then why are you sobbing?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Lord,&#8221; the lamas replied, &#8220;there's an evil monster in the monastery. We don't know which mountain it's from. Last night we sent two junior lamas to strike the bell and beat the drum. We heard the sound of the bell and the drum but the lamas never came back. When we looked for them the next day all we found were their monk's hats and shoes lying in the courtyard at the back and their skeletons. They had been eaten. In the three days you have been here six lamas have disappeared from the monastery. That's why we can't help being frightened and grieved. When we realized that your venerable master was ill we couldn't stop these tears stealing out even though we kept the news to ourselves.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Say no more,&#8221; said Brother Monkey, who was both shocked and delighted by what he heard. &#8220;It must be an evil monster who's killing people here. I'll wipe it out for you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; the lamas replied, &#8220;any evil spirit worthy of the name has magical powers. It's bound to be able to ride clouds, come out of the underworld and disappear again. As the ancients put it so well, 'Trust not the straightest of the straight; beware of the inhuman human.' Please don't take offence, my lord, when we say that if you can rid our monastery of this scourge that would be a great happiness for us. But if you can't catch it things will be pretty difficult.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean by things being pretty difficult?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;We will be honest with you, my lord,&#8221; the lamas replied. &#8220;Although there are only a hundred or so of us lamas in this monastery we all became monks as children:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When our hair grows we have it shaved off;</P>
<P>Our clothes are patched with rags.</P>
<P>We rise in the morning to wash our faces,</P>
<P>Then bow with hands together</P>
<P>In submission to the Great Way.</P>
<P>At night we tidy up, burn incense,</P>
<P>And piously pray,</P>
<P>Chanting the name of Amitabha.</P>
<P>When we look up we see the Buddha</P>
<P>On his ninefold lotus throne</P>
<P>Well-versed in the Three Vehicles,</P>
<P>Riding in his mercy on clouds of dharma,</P>
<P>And we long to see the Sakyamuni in the Jeta park.</P>
<P>Looking down we see into our hearts,</P>
<P>Accept the Five Prohibitions,</P>
<P>Pass through a thousand aeons,</P>
<P>And live each life amid the countless dharmas,</P>
<P>Hoping to understand emptiness and the impermanence of matter.</P>
<P>When the benefactors come,</P>
<P>Old, young, tall, short, fat, thin,</P>
<P>We each beat wooden fish,</P>
<P>Strike bronze chimes,</P>
<P>Slowly and deliberately,</P>
<P>With the two rolls of the Lotus Sutra</P>
<P>And the short<I> Litany of the Emperor of Liang.</I></P>
<P>When the benefactors do not come,</P>
<P>New, old, strange, familiar, rustic, smart,</P>
<P>We put our hands together,</P>
<P>Eyes shut,</P>
<P>Silent,</P>
<P>Entering meditation on the rush mats,</P>
<P>Firmly closing the gates under the moon.</P>
<P>Let the orioles sing and other birds chirp in idle strife:</P>
<P>They cannot mount our expeditions and compassionate chariot of dharma.</P>
<P>This is why we cannot subdue tigers and dragons,</P>
<P>Or recognize monsters and spirits.</P>
<P>If, my lord, you provoked the evil monster,</P>
<P>To which we hundred and more lamas would be but a single meal,</P>
<P>All of us living creatures would fall to the wheel of rebirth,</P>
<P>This ancient monastery of meditation would be destroyed,</P>
<P>And finally there would be no light at the Tathagata's assembly.</P>
<P>This would cause great troubles.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Brother Monkey heard the lamas say this anger surged up from his heart and hatred from his gall. &#8220;What a stupid lot you lamas are!&#8221; he shouted at the top of his voice. &#8220;Are you only aware of those evil spirits? Do you know nothing of what I've done?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Really we don't,&#8221; the lamas replied in very quiet voices.</P>
<P>&#8220;Then I'll tell you briefly about it,&#8221; Monkey said.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;I used to subdue tigers and dragons on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit;</P>
<P>I once went up to Heaven and made great havoc in its palace.</P>
<P>When I was hungry I nibbled just two or three</P>
<P>Of Lord Lao Zi's elixir tablets;</P>
<P>When I was thirsty I sipped six or seven cups</P>
<P>Of the Jade Emperor's own wine.</P>
<P>When I glare with my golden eyes that are neither black nor white,</P>
<P>The sky turns deathly pale</P>
<P>While the moon is hidden in cloud.</P>
<P>When I wield my gold-banded cudgel that's the right length,</P>
<P>It strikes unseen</P>
<P>And leaves no trace behind.</P>
<P>What do I care about big or little monsters,</P>
<P>However rough or vicious they may be?</P>
<P>Once I go for them</P>
<P>They may run away, nimble about, hide or panic.</P>
<P>Whenever I grab one</P>
<P>They'll be filed down, cooked, ground to bits or pulverized in a mortar.</P>
<P>I'm like one of the eight immortals crossing the sea,</P>
<P>Each of whom gives a unique display of his magical powers.</P>
<P>Lamas, I'll catch that evil spirit and show it to you:</P>
<P>Then you'll know what sort of person this Monkey is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the lamas heard this they nodded and said quietly, &#8220;From the way this damned baldy is shooting his mouth off and talking big there must be something behind it all.&#8221;</P>
<P>They all made polite noises of respectful assent except for the older lama who said, &#8220;Wait. Your master is ill, and catching the evil spirit is not as important as that. As the saying goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When a young gentleman goes to a feast</P>
<P>He either gets drunk or eats till he's filled.</P>
<P>When a strong warrior goes into battle</P>
<P>He either is wounded or gets himself killed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you two fight it out here you may well get your master into trouble too. It's not a sound idea.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you're right. I'll take my master a drink of cold water and be right back.&#8221; Picking up the begging bowl he filled it with cold water, went out of the monastery kitchen and back to the abbot's lodgings and called, &#8220;Master, cold water for you.&#8221; Sanzang, who was just then suffering torments of thirst, raised his head, held the bowl with both hands, and took only one sip of the water. It really was a case of</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A drop when you're thirsty is just like sweet dew;</P>
<P>Get the right medicine and you'll feel good as new.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Seeing the venerable elder gradually recovering his spirits and looking less worried Monkey asked, &#8220;Could you manage some soup and other food, Master?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That cold water was a magical cure,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;I have already half recovered from my illness. I would like some food if there is any.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The master's better,&#8221; Monkey shouted repeatedly at the top of his voice. &#8220;He wants some soup and other food.&#8221; He told the lamas to arrange some at once. They washed and boiled rice, made noodles, cooked pancakes, steamed breadrolls, and prepared vermicelli soup. Four or five tables of food were carried in, but the Tang Priest ate only half a bowl of rice gruel, while Monkey and Friar Sand managed only a tableful between them. Pig gobbled up the rest. The dishes were then taken out, the lamp was lit, and the lamas dispersed.</P>
<P>&#8220;How long have we been here now?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Three whole days,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;By tomorrow evening it will be four days.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We could have covered a lot of distance in three days,&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Never mind about the distance, Master,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;We'll be on our way tomorrow.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;even if I am still a little poorly there is nothing that can be done.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If we're setting out tomorrow let me catch the evil spirit tonight,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;What evil spirit?&#8221; Sanzang asked in astonishment. &#8220;There's an evil spirit in this monastery that I'm going to catch for them,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;But how can you be having ideas like that before I have even recovered from my illness?&#8221; Sanzang asked. &#8220;If that monster has magical powers and you fail to catch it, then it will kill me, won't it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're always running people down,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Wherever we go I subdue evil creatures. Have you ever seen me come off second best? That could only happen if I did nothing. If I act I'm bound to win.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang, clutching him, &#8220;the saying is quite right that goes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Do people a good turn whenever you can;</P>
<P>If it is possible treat them with mercy.</P>
<P>Worrying cannot compare with true kindness;</P>
<P>Better be patient than strive for supremacy.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In the face of his master's impassioned pleas and refusal to allow him to subdue the monster, Monkey could only speak frankly.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll be honest with you, Master,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The evil spirit has been eating people here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Who has it eaten?&#8221; Sanzang asked with shock.</P>
<P>&#8220;In the three days we've been here it's eaten six of this monastery's young lamas,&#8221; Monkey said, to which Sanzang replied:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Foxes will grieve at the death of the hare;</P>
<P>Creatures will all for their own kind show care.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As it has eaten monks from this monastery and I am a monk too I will let you go, but do be careful.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No need to tell me,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;I'll wipe it out the moment I get my hands on it.&#8221;</P>
<P>Watch him as he tells Pig and Friar Sand in the lamplight to guard the master. When he leapt happily out of the abbot's lodgings and went back to the Buddha Hall he looked and saw that though there were stars in the sky the moon had not yet risen and it was dark inside the hall. He breathed out some of his magic fire to light the glazed lamp then beat the drum that stood to the East and struck the bell to the West. That done, he shook himself and turned himself into a young lama of only eleven or twelve who was wearing a yellow silk shirt and a white cotton tunic, striking a wooden fish with his hand as he recited a sutra. He waited till the first watch without seeing anything happen. The waning moon rose only in the second watch. Then a roaring wind could be heard. It was a splendid wind:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Black mists cast the sky into darkness;</P>
<P>Gloomy clouds cover the earth with murk.</P>
<P>Inky black in every quarter,</P>
<P>All enveloped in indigo.</P>
<P>At first the wind raises dust and dirt;</P>
<P>Then it blows down trees and ravages woods.</P>
<P>Amid the dust and dirt the stars still shine;</P>
<P>When trees go down and woods are ravaged the moonlight is obscured.</P>
<P>It blows so hard the Moon Goddess holds tight to the sala tree</P>
<P>And the Jade Hare hunts all around for the medicine dish.</P>
<P>The Nine Bright Shiner star lords shut their gates;</P>
<P>The dragon kings of the four seas close their doors.</P>
<P>The city god in his temple looks for the little devils;</P>
<P>Immortals in the sky cannot ride their clouds.</P>
<P>The kings of the Underworld search for their horse-faced demons</P>
<P>While the panicking judges get their turbans in a tangle.</P>
<P>The wind blows so hard it moves Mount Kunlun's rocks,</P>
<P>And churns up the waves on rivers and lakes.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As soon as the wind had passed by there was a fragrance of musk and incense and the tinkling of pendants. When Monkey looked up he saw that a woman of great beauty was going towards the Buddha Hall. Monkey mumbled the words of a sutra for all he was worth. The woman went up to him, put her arms around him and asked, &#8220;What's that sutra you're reciting?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;One I vowed to,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;But why are you still reciting it when the others are all asleep?&#8221; she insisted.</P>
<P>&#8220;I vowed to, so why shouldn't I?&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>Keeping a tight hold on him, the woman kissed his lips and said, &#8220;Let's go round the back for a bit of fun.&#8221; Monkey deliberately turned his head aside as he replied, &#8220;Stop being so naughty.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do you know how to tell people's fortunes from their faces?&#8221; the woman asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I know a bit about it,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;What can you tell about me?&#8221; she continued. &#8220;You look to me rather like someone who's been driven out by her parents-in-law for carrying on with strangers.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're wrong,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;you're wrong.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I have not been driven out by my parents-in-law,</P>
<P>Nor have I carried on with strangers.</P>
<P>Because of my ill fate in an earlier life</P>
<P>I was married to a husband who is much too young</P>
<P>And can't do his staff in the candlelit bedroom:</P>
<P>That is the reason why I have left my husband.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As the stars and moon are so bright tonight and we are fated to come hundreds of miles to meet each other, let's go round to the garden at the back to make love.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Brother Monkey heard this he nodded to himself and thought, &#8220;So those stupid lamas all died because they were led astray by lust. Now she's trying to lure me. Lady,&#8221; he said in reply, &#8220;I'm a monk and still very young. I don't know anything about love-making.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Come with me and I'll teach you,&#8221; the woman replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;All right then,&#8221; Monkey thought with an inward smile, &#8220;I'll go with her and see how she fixes things.&#8221;</P>
<P>Shoulder nestling against shoulder and hand in hand the two of them left the Buddha Hall and went straight to the garden at the back. Here the monster tripped Monkey over and sent him to the ground. With wild calls of &#8220;My darling!&#8221; she made a grab for his crotch.</P>
<P>&#8220;So you really want to eat me up, my girl,&#8221; he said, seizing her hand and throwing her off balance so that she somersaulted to the ground.</P>
<P>&#8220;So you can throw your sweetie to the ground, can you, my darling?&#8221; she said.</P>
<P>&#8220;If I don't take this chance to finish her off what am I waiting for?&#8221; he thought. &#8220;As they say, hit first and win, strike second and lose.&#8221; He leaned forward with his hands on his hips, sprang to his feet and reverted to his own form. With a swing of his gold-banded iron cudgel he struck at the monster's head.</P>
<P>In her astonishment she thought, &#8220;What a terror this young monk is.&#8221; When she opened her eyes wide for a better look she realized that he was the Tang Priest's disciple Monkey, but she was not afraid of him. What sort of evil spirit was she, you may wonder.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A golden nose,</P>
<P>Snowy white fur.</P>
<P>She makes her home in a tunnel,</P>
<P>Where she is thoroughly safe.</P>
<P>Three hundred years ago, after training her vital forces,</P>
<P>She paid several visits to the Vulture Peak,</P>
<P>Carrying a full load of flowers and wax candles.</P>
<P>Tathagata sent her down from Heaven.</P>
<P>She was a beloved daughter to the Pagoda-carrying Heavenly King;</P>
<P>Prince Nezha treated her as his own sister.</P>
<P>She was no bird that fills up the sea,</P>
<P>Nor was she a tortoise carrying mountains on its back.</P>
<P>She did not fear Lei Huan's swords</P>
<P>Nor was she afraid of Lu Qian's blade.</P>
<P>She came and went</P>
<P>Flowing like the mighty Han and Yangtse;</P>
<P>Moved up and down,</P>
<P>Even up a peak as high as Mounts Taishan and Heng.</P>
<P>Seeing the charming beauty of her face</P>
<P>You would never know she was a mouse-spirit with great powers.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In the pride in her enormous magic powers she held up a pair of swords that rang out as she parried to left and right, moving East and West. Although Monkey was rather stronger he could not overpower her. Then magic winds arose on all sides, dimming the waning moon. It was fine battle they fought in the garden at the back:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Evil winds blew from the ground;</P>
<P>Dim was the light of the waning moon.</P>
<P>Deserted was the hall of the Brahma Kings,</P>
<P>And the devils' cloister could not be clearly seen.</P>
<P>The back garden saw a battle Between the warrior Sun,</P>
<P>A sage in Heaven, And the furry girl,</P>
<P>A queen among women,</P>
<P>Both competing in magical powers and refusing to submit.</P>
<P>One turned her heart in anger from the dark-skinned baldy;</P>
<P>The other glared with his all-seeing eyes at the finely dressed woman.</P>
<P>With swords in her hands,</P>
<P>She is no female Bodhisattva.</P>
<P>The blows of the cudgel</P>
<P>Were as fierce as a living vajrapani's.</P>
<P>The resounding golden band flashed like lightning;</P>
<P>For an instant the iron shone white as a star.</P>
<P>In fine buildings they grabbed at the precious jade;</P>
<P>In golden halls the mandarin duck figurines were smashed.</P>
<P>As the apes howled the moon seemed small;</P>
<P>Vast was the sky as wild geese called.</P>
<P>The eighteen arhats</P>
<P>Applauded in secret;</P>
<P>Each of the thirty-two devas</P>
<P>Was struck with panic.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Great Sage Monkey was in such high spirits that his cudgel never missed. Realizing that she was no match for him, the evil spirit frowned suddenly and thought of a plan as she extricated herself and made off.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where do you think you're going, you baggage?&#8221; Monkey shouted. &#8220;Surrender at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>The evil spirit paid no attention and fled. When she was hard-pressed by Monkey's pursuit she took the embroidered shoe off her left foot, blew on it with a magic breath, said the words of a spell, called out, &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned it into a likeness of herself that came back at him waving a pair of swords. Meanwhile she turned her real body with a shake into a pure breeze and went.</P>
<P>This was Sanzang's star of disaster. She headed straight for the abbot's quarters, lifted Sanzang up into a cloud, and, on the instant, before anyone could see anything, she was back at Mount Pitfall and inside the Bottomless Cave, where she told her underlings to prepare a vegetarian marriage feast.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story switches back to Brother Monkey, who fought with desperate anxiety until he was able to seize an opening and smash the evil spirit to the ground with a single blow, only to find that she was in fact an embroidered shoe. Realizing that he had fallen for a trick he went straight back to see the master. But was the master there? There were only the idiot and Friar Sand muttering together. His chest bursting with fury, Monkey put all thought of what he ought to do out of his head and raised his cudgel to lay about him.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll kill the pair of you,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;I'll kill the pair of you.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot was desperate, but there was no way for him to escape. Friar Sand, however, as a general from the magic mountain who had seen a great deal, adopted a very mild and conciliatory approach when he stepped forward, knelt down and said, &#8220;Elder brother, I understand. I'm sure that after you've killed us two you intend to go straight back home instead of rescuing the master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When I've killed you two I'm going to rescue him myself,&#8221; Monkey retorted.</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you say that?&#8221; replied Friar Sand with a smile. &#8220;Without us two it would be a case of</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>You can't spin a thread from only one strand</P>
<P>Or clap with the palm of a single hand.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Who'd look after the luggage or the horse for you? We'd do much better to forget our differences and fight side by side like Guan Zhong and Bao Shuya than to have a battle of wits like Sun Bin and Pang Juan. As the old saying goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>To kill a tiger you need your brothers' help;</P>
<P>Have fathers and sons fight together in battle.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I hope you will spare us, brother, so that tomorrow morning we can all work together with a single mind in our search for the master.&#8221; Although his magical powers were tremendous Monkey knew what was right and needed at the time, so that Friar Sand's entreaties made him change his mind.</P>
<P>&#8220;Get up, Pig and Friar Sand,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But when we hunt for the master tomorrow you'll have to make a real effort.&#8221; The idiot was so grateful at being let off that he would gladly have promised Monkey half the sky.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; Friar Sand said, &#8220;leave it all to me.&#8221; The three brother disciples were so anxious that none of them could sleep. They wished they could make the sun rise in the East with a nod of the head and blow all the stars out of the sky with a single breath.</P>
<P>After sitting there till dawn the three of them packed up and were about to get out, only to find the gateway barred by one of the lamas, who asked, &#8220;Where are you going, gentlemen?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is most embarrassing,&#8221; Monkey replied with a smile. &#8220;Yesterday I boasted to all the monks that I'd capture the evil spirit for them. So far from me capturing her she's made my master disappear. We're off to look for him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; said the lamas with horror, &#8220;our trivial problem has got your master involved. Where will you look for him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I know where I'll look,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Even though you're going please don't be in such a hurry,&#8221; said the lamas. &#8220;Have some breakfast first.&#8221; Two or three bowls of hot gruel were brought in that Pig cleaned up with great gusto.</P>
<P>&#8220;What fine monks,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When we've found the master we'll come back here to see you again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What you mean is come back to eat their food,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Go and see if the girl is still in the devarajas' hall.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;She's gone, my lord,&#8221; the lamas said, &#8220;she's gone. She has spent only one night there and is gone the next morning.&#8221; Monkey cheerfully took his leave of the lamas and made Pig and Friar Sand lead the horse and carry the luggage as they headed back East.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;you're wrong. Why are we going East?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You wouldn't know,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;That girl who was tied up in the Black Pine Forest the other day&#8212;I saw through her with my fiery eyes and golden pupils, but you all thought she was a good person. And now it's her who's eaten the monks and her who's carried the master off. You all did a fine thing rescuing that 'lady Bodhisattva'. As she's carried the master off we're going back the way we came to look for her.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Good, good,&#8221; sighed the other two with admiration. &#8220;You're much cleverer than you look. Let's go.&#8221;</P>
<P>The three of them hurried back into the forest, where this was what could be seen:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Piles of cloud,</P>
<P>Heavy mists,</P>
<P>Many a layer of rock,</P>
<P>A twisting path.</P>
<P>The tracks of foxes and hares cross each other;</P>
<P>Tiger, leopard, jackal and wolf move in and out of the undergrowth.</P>
<P>With no sign of a monster to be seen in the wood</P>
<P>They do not know where Sanzang might be found.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In his anxiety Monkey pulled out his cudgel, shook himself and made himself look as he had when he made great havoc in Heaven, with three heads, six arms and six hands wielding three cudgels. With these he lashed out furiously and noisily among the trees.</P>
<P>&#8220;Friar Sand,&#8221; said Pig when he saw this, &#8220;not finding the master has made him go off his head.&#8221; In fact Monkey had beat a way through the trees and flushed out two old men&#8212;the mountain god and the local deity&#8212;who went up to him, knelt down and said, &#8220;Great Sage, the god of this mountain and the local deity pay their respects.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That rod certainly gets results,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;He clears a path with it and flushes out the mountain god and the local deity. If he cleared another path he'd even flush out an evil star.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Mountain god, local deity,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you're a disgrace. You're hand in glove with the bandits here. When they make a good haul they buy pigs and sheep to sacrifice to you. On top of that you're accomplices of the evil spirit. You helped her kidnap my master and bring him here. Where's he being hidden? If you want to be spared a beating tell me the truth right now.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; the two gods said with alarm, &#8220;you are misjudging us. The evil spirit doesn't live on our mountain or come within our jurisdiction. But when the wind blows at night we have heard a thing or two about her.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Tell me everything you know,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;The evil spirit carried your master off to a place over three hundred miles due South of here,&#8221; the local deity replied. &#8220;There's a mountain there called Mount Pitfall with a cave in it called the Bottomless Cave. He was taken there by a disguised evil spirit from that cave.&#8221; This news gave Monkey a shock that he did not reveal.</P>
<P>Shouting at the mountain god and the local deity to dismiss them he put his magical appearance away, turned back into himself and said to Pig and Friar Sand, &#8220;The master's a long way from here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If it's a long way let's go there by cloud,&#8221; Pig replied.</P>
<P>The splendid idiot went ahead on a wild wind followed by Friar Sand on a cloud. As the white horse had originally been a dragon's son he too came by wind and mist as he carried the luggage on his back. The Great Sage set off by somersault as he headed due South, and before long a high mountain came into view that was blocking the way for the clouds.</P>
<P>The three of them took hold of the horse and stopped their clouds. This is what the mountain looked like:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The summit touched the azure sky,</P>
<P>Its peaks joined with the blue of the heavens.</P>
<P>Trees by the million grew on every side,</P>
<P>While flying birds sung noisily all around.</P>
<P>Tigers and leopards moved in packs,</P>
<P>Water deer and roebuck walked through the bushes.</P>
<P>On the Southern slopes rare flowers bloomed fragrant;</P>
<P>On the Northern side the snow never melted.</P>
<P>Steep and craggy were its ridges,</P>
<P>Sheer were its overhangs and rockfaces.</P>
<P>Pinnacles shot straight up</P>
<P>And deep ravines curved all around.</P>
<P>It was dark green among the pines,</P>
<P>And the rocks were jagged.</P>
<P>It struck fear into the traveler's heart.</P>
<P>No sign could be seen of woodcutters,</P>
<P>And the immortal boys picking herbs had vanished.</P>
<P>The tigers and leopards here could make mists,</P>
<P>And all the foxes set winds roaring.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;this mountain's so high and sheer there must be evil on it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Goes without saying,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;High mountains all have monsters; there's never a steep ridge without spirits. Friar Sand,&#8221; he called, &#8220;you and I are going to stay here while we send Pig into the mountain hollows to look around and find out the best way for us to take. If there really is a cave palace he must discover where the entrance is. Find everything out so that we can go in together to find the master and rescue him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Just my lousy luck,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;having to go first and take the brunt.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Last night you said we could leave it all to you,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;so why are you trying to get out of it now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop shouting at me,&#8221; Pig said. &#8220;I'm going.&#8221; The idiot put down his rake, tugged at his clothes and leapt empty-handed down from the mountain to find the path.</P>
<P>If you don't know whether this departure was to be for good or ill listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>镇海寺心猿知怪</p>
<p>黑松林三众寻师</p>
</div>
<p>话表三藏师徒到镇海禅林寺，众僧相见，安排斋供。四众食毕，那女子也得些食力。渐渐天昏，方丈里点起灯来，众僧一则是问唐僧取经来历，二则是贪看那女子，都攒攒簇簇，排列灯下。三藏对那初见的喇嘛僧道：“院主，明日离了宝山，西去的路途如何？”那僧双膝跪下，慌得长老一把扯住道：“院主请起，我问你个路程，你为何行礼？”那僧道：“老师父明日西行，路途平正，不须费心。只是眼下有件事儿不尴魀，一进门就要说，恐怕冒犯洪威，却才斋罢，方敢大胆奉告：老师东来，路遥辛苦，都在小和尚房中安歇甚好；只是这位女菩萨，不方便，不知请他那里睡好。”三藏道：“院主，你不要生疑，说我师徒们有甚邪意。早间打黑松林过，撞见这个女子绑在树上。小徒孙悟空不肯救他，是我发菩提心，将他救了，到此随院主送他那里睡去。”那僧谢道：“既老师宽厚，请他到天王殿里，就在天王爷爷身后，安排个草铺，教他睡罢。”三藏道：“甚好，甚好。”遂此时，众小和尚引那女子往殿后睡去。长老就在方丈中，请众院主自在，遂各散去。三藏吩咐悟空：“辛苦了，早睡早起！”遂一处都睡了，不敢离侧，护着师父。渐入夜深，正是那：玉兔高升万籁宁，天街寂静断人行。银河耿耿星光灿，鼓发谯楼趱换更。</p>

<p>一宵晚话不题。及天明了，行者起来，教八戒沙僧收拾行囊马匹，却请师父走路。此时长老还贪睡未醒，行者近前叫声“师父。”那师父把头抬了一抬，又不曾答应得出。行者问：“师父怎么说？”长老呻吟道：“我怎么这般头悬眼胀，浑身皮骨皆疼？”八戒听说，伸手去摸摸，身上有些发热。呆子笑道：“我晓得了，这是昨晚见没钱的饭，多吃了几碗，倒沁着头睡，伤食了。”行者喝道：“胡说！等我问师父，端的何如。”三藏道：“我半夜之间，起来解手，不曾戴得帽子，想是风吹了。”行者道：“这还说得是，如今可走得路么？”三藏道：“我如今起坐不得，怎么上马？但只误了路啊！”行者道：“师父说那里话！常言道，一日为师，终身为父。我等与你做徒弟，就是儿子一般。又说道，养儿不用阿金溺银，只是见景生情便好。你既身子不快，说甚么误了行程，便宁耐几日何妨！”兄弟们都伏侍着师父，不觉的早尽午来昏又至，良宵才过又侵晨。</p>

<p>光阴迅速，早过了三日。那一日，师父欠身起来叫道：“悟空，这两日病体沉疴，不曾问得你，那个脱命的女菩萨，可曾有人送些饭与他吃？”行者笑道：“你管他怎的，且顾了自家的病着。”三藏道：“正是，正是。你且扶我起来，取出我的纸、笔、墨，寺里借个砚台来使使。”行者道：“要怎的？”长老道：“我要修一封书，并关文封在一处，你替我送上长安驾下，见太宗皇帝一面。”行者道：“这个容易，我老孙别事无能，若说送书：人间第一。你把书收拾停当与我，我一筋斗送到长安，递与唐王，再一筋斗转将回来，你的笔砚还不干哩。但只是你寄书怎的？且把书意念念我听，念了再写不迟。”长老滴泪道：“我写着：臣僧稽首三顿首，万岁山呼拜圣君；文武两班同入目，公卿四百共知闻：当年奉旨离东土，指望灵山见世尊。不料途中遭厄难，何期半路有灾迍。僧病沉疴难进步，佛门深远接天门。有经无命空劳碌，启奏当今别遣人。”行者听得此言，忍不住呵呵大笑道：</p>

<p>“师父，你忒不济，略有些病儿，就起这个意念。你若是病重，要死要活，只消问我。我老孙自有个本事，问道‘那个阎王敢起心？那个判官敢出票？那个鬼使来勾取？’若恼了我，我拿出那大闹天宫之性子，又一路棍，打入幽冥，捉住十代阎王，一个个抽了他的筋，还不饶他哩！”三藏道：“徒弟呀，我病重了，切莫说这大话。”八戒上前道：“师兄，师父说不好，你只管说好，十分不尴魀。我们趁早商量，先卖了马，典了行囊，买棺木送终散火。”行者道：“呆子又胡说了！你不知道师父是我佛如来第二个徒弟，原叫做金蝉长老，只因他轻慢佛法，该有这场大难。”</p>

<p>八戒道：“哥啊，师父既是轻慢佛法，贬回东土，在是非海内，口舌场中，托化做人身，发愿往西天拜佛求经，遇妖精就捆，逢魔头就吊，受诸苦恼也彀了，怎么又叫他害病？”行者道：“你那里晓得，老师父不曾听佛讲法，打了一个盹，往下一失，左脚下躧了一粒米下界来，该有这三日病。”八戒惊道：“象老猪吃东西泼泼撒撒的，也不知害多少年代病是！”行者道：“兄弟，佛不与你众生为念。你又不知，人云锄禾日当午，汗滴禾下土。谁知盘中餐，粒粒皆辛苦！师父只今日一日，明日就好了。”三藏道：</p>

<p>“我今日比昨不同，咽喉里十分作渴。你去那里，有凉水寻些来我吃。”行者道：“好了！师父要水吃，便是好了。等我取水去。”</p>

<p>即时取了钵盂，往寺后面香积厨取水。忽见那些和尚一个个眼儿通红，悲啼哽咽，只是不敢放声大哭。行者道：“你们这些和尚，忒小家子样！我们住几日，临行谢你，柴火钱照日算还。怎么这等脓包！”众僧慌跪下道：“不敢！不敢！”行者道：</p>

<p>“怎么不敢？想是我那长嘴和尚，食肠大，吃伤了你的本儿也？”</p>

<p>众僧道：“老爷，我这荒山，大大小小，也有百十众和尚，每一人养老爷一日，也养得起百十日。怎么敢欺心，计较甚么食用！”</p>

<p>行者道：“既不计较，你却为甚么啼哭？”众僧道：“老爷，不知是那山里来的妖邪在这寺里。我们晚夜间着两个小和尚去撞钟打鼓，只听得钟鼓响罢，再不见人回。至次日找寻，只见僧帽僧鞋，丢在后边园里，骸骨尚存，将人吃了。你们住了三日，我寺里不见了六个和尚。故此，我兄弟们不由的不怕，不由的不伤。</p>

<p>因见你老师父贵慈，不敢传说，忍不住泪珠偷垂也。”行者闻言，又惊又喜道：“不消说了，必定是妖魔在此伤人也，等我与你剿除他。”众僧道：“老爷，妖精不精者不灵，一定会腾云驾雾，一定会出幽入冥。古人道得好，莫信直中直，须防仁不仁。</p>

<p>老爷，你莫怪我们说：你若拿得他住哩，便与我荒山除了这条祸根，正是三生有幸了；若还拿他不住啊，却有好些儿不便处。”行者道：“怎叫做好些不便处？”那众僧道：“直不相瞒老爷说。我这荒山，虽有百十众和尚，却都只是自小儿出家的，发长寻刀削，衣单破衲缝。早晨起来洗着脸，叉手躬身，皈依大道；</p>

<p>夜来收拾烧着香，虔心叩齿，念的弥陀。举头看见佛，莲九品，秇三乘，慈航共法云，愿见叆园释世尊；低头看见心，受五戒，度大千，生生万法中，愿悟顽空与色空。诸檀越来啊，老的、小的、长的、矮的、胖的、瘦的，一个个敲木鱼，击金磬，挨挨拶拶，两卷《法华经》，一策《梁王忏》；诸檀越不来啊，新的、旧的、生的、熟的、村的、俏的，一个个合着掌，瞑着目，悄悄冥冥，入定蒲团上，牢关月下门。一任他莺啼鸟语闲争斗，不上我方便慈悲大法乘。因此上，也不会伏虎，也不会降龙；也不识的怪，也不识的精。你老爷若还惹起那妖魔啊，我百十个和尚只彀他斋一饱，一则堕落我众生轮回，二则灭抹了这禅林古迹，三则如来会上，全没半点儿光辉。这却是好些儿不便处。”行者闻得众和尚说出这一端的话语，他便怒从心上起，恶向胆边生，高叫一声：“你这众和尚好呆哩！只晓得那妖精，就不晓得我老孙的行止么？”众僧轻轻的答道：“实不晓得。”行者道：“我今日略节说说，你们听着：我也曾花果山伏虎降龙，我也曾上天堂大闹天宫。饥时把老君的丹，略略咬了两三颗；渴时把玉帝的酒，轻轻呼了六七钟。睁着一双不白不黑的金睛眼，天惨淡，月朦胧；</p>

<p>拿着一条不短不长的金箍棒，来无影，去无踪。说甚么大精小怪，那怕他惫懒膭脓！一赶赶上去，跑的跑，颤的颤，躲的躲，慌的慌；一捉捉将来，锉的锉，烧的烧，磨的磨，舂的舂。正是八仙同过海，独自显神通！众和尚，我拿这妖精与你看看，你才认得我老孙！”众僧听着，暗点头道：“这贼秃开大口，话大话，想是有些来历。”都一个个诺诺连声，只有那喇嘛僧道：“且住！你老师父贵恙，你拿这妖精不至紧。俗语道，公子登筵，不醉便饱；</p>

<p>壮士临阵，不死即伤。你两下里角斗之时，倘贻累你师父，不当稳便。”行者道：“有理！有理！我且送凉水与师父吃了再来。”</p>

<p>掇起钵盂，着上凉水，转出香积厨，就到方丈，叫声：“师父，吃凉水哩。”三藏正当烦渴之时，便抬起头来，捧着水，只是一吸，真个渴时一滴如甘露，药到真方病即除。行者见长老精神渐爽，眉目舒开，就问道：“师父，可吃些汤饭么？”三藏道：“这凉水就是灵丹一般，这病儿减了一半，有汤饭也吃得些。”行者连声高高叫道：“我师父好了，要汤饭吃哩。”教那些和尚忙忙的安排。淘米，煮饭，捍面，烙饼，蒸馍馍，做粉汤，抬了四五桌。唐僧只吃得半碗儿米汤，行者沙僧止用了一席，其余的都是八戒一肚餐之。家火收去，点起灯来，众僧各散。”</p>

<p>三藏道：“我们今住几日了？”行者道：“三整日矣。明朝向晚，便就是四个日头。”三藏道：“三日误了许多路程。”行者道：</p>

<p>“师父，也算不得路程，明日去罢。”三藏道：“正是，就带几分病儿，也没奈何。”行者道：“既是明日要去，且让我今晚捉了妖精者。”三藏惊道：“又捉甚么妖精？”行者道：“有个妖精在这寺里，等老孙替他捉捉。”唐僧道：“徒弟呀，我的病身未可，你怎么又兴此念！倘那怪有神通，你拿他不住啊，却又不是害我？”</p>

<p>行者道：“你好灭人威风！老孙到处降妖，你见我弱与谁的？只是不动手，动手就要赢。”三藏扯住道：“徒弟，常言说得好，遇方便时行方便，得饶人处且饶人。操心怎似存心好，争气何如忍气高！”孙大圣见师父苦苦劝他，不许降妖，他说出老实话来道：“师父，实不瞒你说，那妖在此吃了人了。”唐僧大惊道：“吃了甚么人？”行者说道：“我们住了三日，已是吃了这寺里六个小和尚了。”长老道：“兔死狐悲，物伤其类。他既吃了寺内之僧，我亦僧也，我放你去，只但用心仔细些。”行者道：“不消说，老孙的手到就消除了。”</p>

<p>你看他灯光前吩咐八戒沙僧看守师父，他喜孜孜跳出方丈，径来佛殿看时，天上有星，月还未上，那殿里黑暗暗的。他就吹出真火，点起琉璃，东边打鼓，西边撞钟。响罢，摇身一变，变做个小和尚儿，年纪只有十二三岁，披着黄绢褊衫，白布直裰，手敲着木鱼，口里念经。等到一更时分，不见动静。二更时分，残月才升，只听见呼呼的一阵风响。好风：黑雾遮天暗，愁云照地昏。四方如泼墨，一派靛妆浑。先刮时扬尘播土，次后来倒树摧林。扬尘播土星光现，倒树摧林月色昏。只刮得嫦娥紧抱梭罗树，玉兔团团找药盆。九曜星官皆闭户，四海龙王尽掩门。庙里城隍觅小鬼，空中仙子怎腾云？地府阎罗寻马面，判官乱跑赶头巾。刮动昆仑顶上石，卷得江湖波浪混。那风才然过处，猛闻得兰麝香熏，环珮声响，即欠身抬头观看，呀！却是一个美貌佳人，径上佛殿。行者口里呜哩呜喇，只情念经。那女子走近前，一把搂住道：“小长老，念的甚么经？”行者道：“许下的。”女子道：“别人都自在睡觉，你还念经怎么？”行者道：</p>

<p>“许下的，如何不念？”女子搂住，与他亲个嘴道：“我与你到后面耍耍去。”行者故意的扭过头去道：“你有些不晓事！”女子道：“你会相面？”行者道：“也晓得些儿。”女子道：“你相我怎的样子？”行者道：“我相你有些儿偷生搲熟，被公婆赶出来的。”</p>

<p>女子道：“相不着！相不着！我不是公婆赶逐，不因搲熟偷生。|奇+_+书*_*网|</p>

<p>奈我前生命薄，投配男子年轻。不会洞房花烛，避夫逃走之情。</p>

<p>趁如今星光月皎，也是有缘千里来相会，我和你到后园中交欢配鸾俦去也。”行者闻言，暗点头道：“那几个愚僧。都被色欲引诱，所以伤了性命，他如今也来哄我。”就随口答应道：“娘子，我出家人年纪尚幼，却不知甚么交欢之事。”女子道：“你跟我去，我教你。”行者暗笑道：“也罢，我跟他去，看他怎生摆布。”</p>

<p>他两个搂着肩，携着手，出了佛殿，径至后边园里。那怪把行者使个绊子腿，跌倒在地，口里“心肝哥哥”的乱叫，将手就去掐他的臊根。行者道：“我的儿，真个要吃老孙哩！”却被行者接住他手，使个小坐跌法，把那怪一辘轳掀翻在地上。那怪口里还叫道：“心肝哥哥，你倒会跌你的娘哩！”行者暗算道：“不趁此时下手他，还到几时！正是先下手为强，后下手遭殃。”就把手一叉，腰一躬，一跳跳起来，现出原身法象，轮起金箍铁棒，劈头就打。那怪倒也吃了一惊，他心想道：“这个小和尚，这等利害！”打开眼一看，原来是那唐长老的徒弟姓孙的，他也不惧他。你说这精怪是甚么精怪：金作鼻，雪铺毛。地道为门屋，安身处处牢。养成三百年前气，曾向灵山走几遭。一饱香花和蜡烛，如来吩咐下天曹。托塔天王恩爱女，哪吒太子认同胞。也不是个填海鸟，也不是个戴山鳌。也不怕的雷焕剑，也不怕的吕虔刀。往往来来，一任他水流江汉阔；上上下下，那论他山耸泰恒高？你看他月貌花容娇滴滴，谁识得是个鼠老成精逞黠豪！他自恃的神通广大，便随手架起双股剑，玎玎珰珰的响，左遮右格，随东倒西。行者虽强些，却也捞他不倒。阴风四起，残月无光，你看他两人，后园中一场好杀：阴风从地起，残月荡微光。阒静梵王宇，阑珊小鬼廊。后园里一片战争场，孙大士，天上圣，毛姹女，女中王，赌赛神通未肯降。一个儿扭转芳心嗔黑秃，一个儿圆睁慧眼恨新妆。两手剑飞，那认得女菩萨；一根棍打，狠似个活金刚。响处金箍如电掣，霎时铁白耀星芒。玉楼抓翡翠，金殿碎鸳鸯。猿啼巴月小，雁叫楚天长。十八尊罗汉，暗暗喝采；三十二诸天，个个慌张。</p>

<p>那孙大圣精神抖擞，棍儿没半点差池。妖精自料敌他不住，猛可的眉头一蹙，计上心来，抽身便走。行者喝道：“泼货！</p>

<p>那走！快快来降！”那妖精只是不理，直往后退。等行者赶到紧急之时，即将左脚上花鞋脱下来，吹口仙气，念个咒语，叫一声“变！”就变做本身模样，使两口剑舞将来，真身一幌，化阵清风而去。这却不是三藏的灾星？他便径撞到方丈里，把唐三藏摄将去云头上，杳杳冥冥，霎霎眼就到了陷空山，进了无底洞，叫小的们安排素筵席成亲不题。</p>

<p>却说行者斗得心焦性燥，闪一个空，一棍把那妖精打落下来，乃是一只花鞋。行者晓得中了他计，连忙转身来看师父。那有个师父？只见那呆子和沙僧口里呜哩呜哪说甚么。行者怒气填胸，也不管好歹，捞起棍来一片打，连声叫道：“打死你们！</p>

<p>打死你们！”那呆子慌得走也没路，沙僧却是个灵山大将，见得事多，就软款温柔，近前跪下道：“兄长，我知道了，想你要打杀我两个，也不去救师父，径自回家去哩。”行者道：“我打杀你两个，我自去救他！”沙僧笑道：“兄长说那里话！无我两个，真是单丝不线，孤掌难鸣。兄啊，这行囊马匹，谁与看顾？宁学管鲍分金，休仿孙庞斗智。自古道，打虎还得亲兄弟，上阵须教父子兵，望兄长且饶打，待天明和你同心戮力，寻师去也。”行者虽是神通广大，却也明理识时，见沙僧苦苦哀告，便就回心道：</p>

<p>“八戒，沙僧，你都起来。明日找寻师父，却要用力。”那呆子听见饶了，恨不得天也许下半边，道：“哥啊，这个都在老猪身上。”兄弟们思思想想，那曾得睡，恨不得点头唤出扶桑日，一口吹散满天星。</p>

<p>三众只坐到天晓，收拾要行，早有寺僧拦门来问：“老爷那里去？”行者笑道：“不好说，昨日对众夸口，说与他们拿妖精，妖精未曾拿得，倒把我个师父不见了。我们寻师父去哩。”众僧害怕道：“老爷，小可的事，倒带累老师，却往那里去寻？”行者道：“有处寻他。”众僧又道：“既去莫忙，且吃些早斋。”连忙的端了两三盆汤饭。八戒尽力吃个干净，道：“好和尚！我们寻着师父，再到你这里来耍子。”行者道：“还到这里吃他饭哩！你去天王殿里看看那女子在否。”众僧道：“老爷，不在了，不在了。</p>

<p>自是当晚宿了一夜，第二日就不见了。”</p>

<p>行者喜喜欢欢的辞了众僧，着八戒、沙僧牵马挑担，径回东走。八戒道：“哥哥差了，怎么又往东行？”行者道：“你岂知道！前日在那黑松林绑的那个女子，老孙火眼金睛，把他认透了，你们都认做好人。今日吃和尚的也是他，摄师父的也是他！</p>

<p>你们救得好女菩萨！今既摄了师父，还从旧路上找寻去也。”二人叹服道：“好好好！真是粗中有细！去来去来！”三人急急到于林内，只见那：云蔼蔼，雾漫漫；石层层，路盘盘。狐踪兔迹交加走，虎豹豺狼往复钻。林内更无妖怪影，不知三藏在何端。行者心焦，掣出棒来。摇身一变，变作大闹天宫的本相，三头六臂，六只手，理着三根棒，在林里辟哩拨喇的乱打。八戒见了道：“沙僧，师兄着了恼，寻不着师父，弄做个气心风了。”原来行者打了一路，打出两个老头儿来，一个是山神，一个是土地，上前跪下道：“大圣，山神土地来见。”八戒道：“好灵根啊！打了一路，打出两个山神土地，若再打一路，连太岁都打出来也。”</p>

<p>行者问道：“山神土地，汝等这般无礼！在此处专一结伙强盗，强盗得了手，买些猪羊祭赛你，又与妖精结掳，打伙儿把我师父摄来！如今藏在何处？快快的从实供来，免打！”二神慌了道：</p>

<p>“大圣错怪了我耶。妖精不在小神山上，不伏小神管辖，但只夜间风响处，小神略知一二。”行者道：“既知，一一说来！”土地道：“那妖精摄你师父去，在那正南下，离此有千里之遥。那厢有座山，唤做陷空山，山中有个洞，叫做无底洞。是那山里妖精，到此变化摄去也。”行者听言，暗自惊心，喝退了山神土地，收了法身，现出本相，与八戒沙僧道：“师父去得远了。”八戒道：“远便腾云赶去！”好呆子，一纵狂风先起，随后是沙僧驾云，那白马原是龙子出身，驮了行李，也踏了风雾。大圣即起筋斗，一直南来。不多时，早见一座大山，阻住云脚。三人采住马，都按定云头，见那山：顶摩碧汉，峰接青霄。周围杂树万万千，来往飞禽喳喳噪。虎豹成阵走，獐鹿打丛行。向阳处，琪花瑶草馨香；背阴方，腊雪顽冰不化。崎岖峻岭，削壁悬崖。直立高峰，湾环深涧。松郁郁，石磷磷，行人见了悚其心。打柴樵子全无影，采药仙童不见踪。眼前虎豹能兴雾，遍地狐狸乱弄风。八戒道：“哥啊，这山如此险峻，必有妖邪。”行者道：“不消说了，山高原有怪，岭峻岂无精！”叫：“沙僧，我和你且在此，着八戒先下山凹里打听打听，看那条路好走，端的可有洞府，再看是那里开门，俱细细打探，我们好一齐去寻师父救他。”八戒道：</p>

<p>“老猪晦气！先拿我顶缸！”行者道：“你夜来说都在你身上，如何打仰？”八戒道：“不要嚷，等我去。”呆子放下钯，抖抖衣裳，空着手，跳下高山，找寻路径。这一去，毕竟不知好歹如何，且听下回分解。</p>
