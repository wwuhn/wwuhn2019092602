<P>The Holy Monk Is Stopped by the River of Heaven at Night</P>
<P>Metal and Wood in Their Mercy Rescue a Child</P>
</div>
<P>The king collapsed on his throne in tears and cried till nightfall. Then Monkey stepped forward and called out, &#8220;Don't be so silly. Look at those Taoists' bodies. One was a tiger and the other was a deer. Antelope Power was an antelope. If you don't believe me, have his bones fished out and take a look at them. Is that a human skeleton? They were all mountain beasts who became spirits and came here to destroy you. The only reason they had not struck yet was because your life force is still strong; but in another couple of years when your life force was weaker they would have murdered you and your whole kingdom would have been theirs. You are very lucky that we came here in time to destroy their evil and save your life. What are you crying for? Give us our passport at once and let us go.&#8221;</P>
<P>This finally brought the king to his senses, and then the civil and military officials reported together, &#8220;The first two who died were indeed a white deer and a yellow tiger; and the cauldron contains the bones of an antelope. The holy monk must be believed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If that is the case I must thank the holy monk,&#8221; said the king, who then said to his tutor, &#8220;it is late now, so please take the holy monks to the Deep Wisdom Monastery. Tomorrow morning the Eastern hall of the palace shall be opened up and the royal kitchens shall lay on a vegetarian banquet as a mark of our thanks.&#8221; They were then taken to the monastery, where they slept that night.</P>
<P>Shortly before dawn the next morning the king held an audience at which he ordered the officials to issue a notice to be posted at the four gates of the city and on every road recalling Buddhist monks. While the banquet was being set out the king went in his carriage to the gates of the Deep Wisdom Monastery to invite the Tang Priest and his disciples to the banquet in the Eastern hall of the palace.</P>
<P>When the Buddhist monks who had escaped learned of the notice they all returned in delight to the city to find the Great Sage Monkey, return his hairs, and thank him. When the banquet was over the king returned Sanzang the passport and escorted him out through the gates of the palace with his queen, consorts and concubines and the civil and military officials, The Buddhist monks could be seen kneeling beside the road and calling out, &#8220;Great Sage Equaling Heaven, we are the monks your lordship saved on the sandbank. Now that we have heard that you lordship has destroyed those evil beings and saved us, and His Majesty has issued a notice recalling us monks, we have come to return your hairs and kowtow in gratitude.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How many of you are there here?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;All five hundred: we are not one short.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey then shook himself and took the hairs back before saying to king, subjects, monks and lay people alike, &#8220;It was I who released these monks, it was I who took the cart through the two gates and along the ridge before smashing it, and it was I who killed those evil Taoists. Now that the evil has been destroyed you will realize that there is a Way in the Buddha's faith. From now on you must have no more foolish beliefs. I hope that you will combine the three teachings by honoring both the Buddhist clergy and the Way of Taoism, and by also educating men of talent in the Confucian tradition. I can guarantee that this will make you kingdom secure for ever.&#8221; The king accepted this advice and expressed his gratitude at great length as he accompanied the Tang Priest out of the city.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Because they were seriously seeking the scriptures,</P>
<P>They strove to maintain their brightness of spirit.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Setting out at dawn and not stopping till nightfall, they drank when thirsty and ate when hungry. Before they realized it spring and summer were over and it was autumn again. Late one day the Tang Priest reined in his horse and asked, &#8220;Where shall we spend the night, disciples?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;a man of religion shouldn't talk like a layman.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What is the difference in the way they talk?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;At a time like this,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;a layman would be fast asleep in a warm bed wrapped up in a quilt with his child in his arms and a wife to keep his feet warm. We monks can't expect anything like that. We have only the moon and the stars to cover us with. We dine on the wind and sleep in the dew. We travel when we can find a way and only stop when there's no way forward.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;you only know half of the story. The trail is very steep now and I can barely manage my heavy load. We've got to find somewhere where I can get a good night's sleep and build myself up to carry my load tomorrow. Otherwise I'm going to collapse from exhaustion.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Let's go a little further in the moonlight,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;When we reach a house we can stay there.&#8221; Master and disciples had no choice but to carry on with Monkey.</P>
<P>They had not been going for long when they heard the sound of waves. &#8220;That's done it,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;We've come to the end of the road.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's a river in our way,&#8221; said Friar Sand.</P>
<P>&#8220;How are we going to get across?&#8221; asked the Tang Priest.</P>
<P>&#8220;Let me test it for depth,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't talk nonsense, Wuneng,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;How could you test the water for depth?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Find a pebble the size of a goose egg and throw it in,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;If it makes a big splash the water's shallow; and if it goes down with bubbles the water's deep.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Test it then,&#8221; said Monkey. The idiot then picked up a stone and threw it into the water; they heard the bubbles rising as the stone sunk.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's deep, too deep,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we'll never get across.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You have tested for depth,&#8221; said the Tang Priest, &#8220;but we don't know how wide it is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I can't tell that,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;Let me have a look,&#8221; said Monkey. The splendid Great Sage sprang up into mid-air on his cloud and took a good look. What he saw was:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The light of the moon immersed in the vastness,</P>
<P>The floating reflection of the limitless sky.</P>
<P>The magical stream has swallowed Mount Hua;</P>
<P>Hundreds of rivers flow into its waters.</P>
<P>Waves in their thousands rise and then fall,</P>
<P>Towering breakers crash without number.</P>
<P>No fisherman burns his fire by the shore;</P>
<P>The herons are all now asleep on the sand.</P>
<P>It is as turbid and huge as the ocean,</P>
<P>And there is no end to its water in sight.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey brought his cloud quickly down, put it away, and reported, &#8220;It's wide, Master, very wide. We'll never get across it. My fiery eyes with their golden pupils can see there hundred miles by day and distinguish good from evil too. By night they can see a hundred to a hundred and fifty miles. If even I can't see the other bank goodness only knows how wide it is.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang was speechless with shock, then he sobbed, &#8220;What are we to do, disciples?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't cry, Master,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;There's someone standing by the river over there.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I expect it's a fisherman working his nets,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'll go and ask him.&#8221; Monkey took his iron cudgel in his hand and was before the man in two or three bounds, only to discover that it was in fact a stone tablet on which was inscribed in an ancient script three words in large letters and nine words in two rows of little ones underneath. The three words written large were RIVER OF HEAVEN, and the words in small writing were &#8220;250 miles across; few travelers have ever been here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; called Monkey, &#8220;come and take a look.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Sanzang read this he said through his tears, &#8220;Disciple, when I left Chang'an all those years ago I thought that the Western Heaven would be easy to get to. I never knew that so many evil monsters would block my way, or that there would be such enormous mountains and rivers to cross.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Listen, Master,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;Where is that sound of drums and cymbals coming from? It must be people holding a religious feast. Let's go and get some of the food to eat and find out where there is a boat that will ferry us across tomorrow.&#8221; When Sanzang listened as he sat on the horse he could hear that it really was the sound of drums and cymbals.</P>
<P>&#8220;Those aren't Taoist instruments,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It must be some Buddhist monks performing a ceremony. Let's go there.&#8221; Monkey led the horse as they headed towards the music. There was no track to follow as they climbed and then lost height again and crossed sand banks until a village of some four or five hundred households came into sight. It was a fine settlement:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Protected by hills, beside the main road,</P>
<P>On the bank of the river, and watered by a stream.</P>
<P>All the wicket gates were shut;</P>
<P>Every household's bamboo fence was closed.</P>
<P>Clear were the dreams of the egrets on the strand,</P>
<P>Silent the song of the birds by the willows.</P>
<P>No sound came from the flute,</P>
<P>Nothing was heard of the chopping-board's rhythm.</P>
<P>The moon was rocked in stalks of knotweed;</P>
<P>The leaves of the rushes trembled in the wind.</P>
<P>Beside the fields the dogs barked through the fence;</P>
<P>The fisherman slept in his boat moored by the ford.</P>
<P>Few were the lights amid the stillness,</P>
<P>And the moon hung like a mirror in the sky,</P>
<P>A smell of duckweed wafted over</P>
<P>Carried by the wind from the Western bank.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Sanzang dismounted he saw a house at the end of the road outside of which hung a silken banner. Inside it was bright with candles and lanterns, and there were clouds of incense.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;this is much better than a mountain hollow or the bank of a stream. Under the eaves we will be able to relax and sleep soundly, protected from the chilly dew. You all keep out of the way while I go to the gates of the believer's house that is giving the religious feast to ask for shelter. If they invite me in I shall call you over. But don't start playing it up if they don't invite me in. If you show your ugly faces you might give them a terrible fright and cause trouble, and then we would have nowhere to stay.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;You go ahead, Master, while we wait here.&#8221;</P>
<P>The venerable elder then took off his rain hat, straightened his habit, took his monastic staff in his hand and went bareheaded to the gates, which were ajar. Not venturing to walk in uninvited, Sanzang stood there for a while until a very old man with prayer-beads round his neck who was repeating the name of Amitabha Buddha came out to shut the gate.</P>
<P>Sanzang at once put his hands together before his chest and said, &#8220;I salute you, benefactor.&#8221; The old man returned his greeting then said, &#8220;You're too late, monk.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;You're too late to get anything,&#8221; the old man said. &#8220;If you had been here earlier we were giving each monk a good meal, three pints of polished rice, a piece of white cloth, and ten copper cash. Why have you only come now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Benefactor,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;I am not here to collect offerings.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you're not here for offerings, what are you here for then?&#8221; the old man asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I have been sent by the Emperor of the Great Tang in the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;It was already late when I reached this village, and I have come here to beg for a night's shelter because I heard the drums and cymbals. I will be on my way at dawn.&#8221;</P>
<P>The old man shook his hand at him as he replied, &#8220;Monk, men of religion should not tell lies. Great Tang in the East is 18,000 miles from here. How could you have come from there by yourself?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You are quite right, benefactor,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;I have only been able to reach here because I have three disciples who protect me. They clear paths across mountains and build bridges across rivers.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you have these disciples,&#8221; the old man said, &#8220;why aren't they with you? But do come in. We have room for you to stay here.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang then looked back and called, &#8220;Come here, disciples.&#8221;</P>
<P>As Monkey was impatient by nature, Pig coarse, and Friar Sand impetuous, the moment they heard their master calling they grabbed the horse's bridle and the luggage and ran in, hell-bent for leather. The sight of them gave the old man such a shock that he collapsed, muttering, &#8220;Demons, demons.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please don't be afraid, benefactor,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;They're not demons, they are my disciples.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But how could so handsome a master have such hideous disciples?&#8221; asked the old man, still shivering and shaking.</P>
<P>&#8220;They may not be much to look at,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;but they certainly know how to subdue dragons and tigers and capture monsters and demons.&#8221; The old man was not entirely convinced as he helped the Tang Priest inside.</P>
<P>The three ferocious disciples rushed to the main hall, tied the horse up outside and put the baggage down. Several monks were reciting sutras inside. Covering his long snout with his hands, Pig shouted, &#8220;What's that sutra you're reciting, monks?&#8221; The monks looked up when they heard his question.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>They looked at the stranger and saw a long snout,</P>
<P>As well as a pair of big ears that stuck out.</P>
<P>His body was rough and his shoulders were broad;</P>
<P>When he opened his muzzle, like thunder he roared.</P>
<P>But as for our Monkey and good Friar Sand,</P>
<P>Their faces were more than a person could stand.</P>
<P>The monks saying their sutras within the main hall</P>
<P>Were terribly frightened and scared one and all.</P>
<P>The teacher continued the text to recite,</P>
<P>Until the head monk said they should stop for the night.</P>
<P>They paid no more heed to the chimes and the bell,</P>
<P>And the Buddha's own images from their hands fell.</P>
<P>They all blew at once to put out every light,</P>
<P>And tried in their terror to scatter in flight.</P>
<P>They crawl on the ground as they stumble and fall,</P>
<P>And all of them trip getting out of that hall.</P>
<P>One old monk's head with another one clashes</P>
<P>Just like the collapse of piled-up calabashes.</P>
<P>What once was a pure and a most holy rite</P>
<P>Was all now reduced to a comical sight.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The sight of the monks stumbling and crawling about made the three disciples clap their hands and laugh aloud, at which the monks were more terrified than ever. Colliding with each other's heads they all fled for their lives and disappeared. By the time Sanzang helped the old man into the hall the lights had all been put out and the three of them were still chuckling away.</P>
<P>&#8220;Damned creatures,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;you are all thoroughly evil, despite my daily teaching and advice. As the ancients said,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Only the saintly can become good without instruction;</P>
<P>Only the worthy can become good after instruction;</P>
<P>Only idiots will not become good even with instruction.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The disgraceful scene you've just made is one of the lowest and most stupid things I could possibly imagine. You charge in through the gates without any respect, make our elderly benefactor collapse in fright, send all the monks fleeing for their lives, and completely ruin their service. I shall have to take the blame for all of this.&#8221; None of them could find a word to say in their defense.</P>
<P>Only then did the old man believe that they really were Sanzang's disciples, turn back, and say, &#8220;It's nothing, sir, nothing. The lamps have just been put out and the flowers scattered as the service is ending anyhow.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If it's over,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;bring out the food and wine for the completion feast. We need a meal before we go to bed.&#8221; The old man called for oil lamps to be lit. The servants could not understand why.</P>
<P>&#8220;There are lots of incense sticks and candles where they're saying surras in the main hall, so why does he want oil lamps lit?&#8221;</P>
<P>When some servants came out to look they found everything in darkness, so they lit torches and lanterns and rushed in together. When they looked inside and suddenly saw Pig and Friar Sand they dropped their torches in terror and fled, shutting the doors behind them, and fleeing to the inner part of the house with shout of &#8220;Demons, demons!&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey picked up a torch, lit some lamps and candles, and pulled up an armchair for the Tang Priest to sit in while the disciples sat on either side of him. As they were sitting there talking they heard a door leading from the inner part of the house being opened. Another old man came in leaning on a stick and asking, &#8220;What evil spirits are you, coming to this pious household in the middle of the night?&#8221;</P>
<P>The first old man, who was sitting in front of them, rose and went to meet him behind the screen saying, &#8220;Stop shouting, elder brother. These aren't demons. This is an arhat sent from Great Tang in the East to fetch the scriptures. His disciples may look evil but really they are very good.&#8221; Only then did the old man put his stick down and bow in greeting to the four of them, after which he too sat down in front of them and called for tea and vegetarian food. He shouted several times, but the servants were still quaking with terror and too frightened to come in.</P>
<P>This was more than Pig could put up with. &#8220;Old man,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you have an awful lot of servants. What have they all gone off to do?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have sent them to fetch food to offer to you gentlemen,&#8221; the old man replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;How many of them will be serving the food?&#8221; asked Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;Eight,&#8221; said the old man.</P>
<P>&#8220;Who will they be waiting on?&#8221; asked Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;You four gentlemen,&#8221; the old man replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Our master, the one with the white face, only needs one person to wait on him,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;The one with hair cheeks whose mouth looks like a thunder god only needs two. That vicious-looking creature needs eight, and I must have twenty.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;From what you say must be rather a big eater,&#8221; the old man remarked.</P>
<P>&#8220;You're about right,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;We have enough servants,&#8221; the old man said, and by bringing together servants of all ages he produced thirty or forty of them.</P>
<P>As the monks talked to the old man the servants lost their fear and set a table in front of the Tang Priest, inviting him to take the place of honour. They then put three more tables on both sides of him, at which they asked the three disciples to sit, and another in front of these for the two old men. On the tables were neatly arranged some fruit, vegetables, pasta, rice, refreshments and pea-noodle soup. Sanzang raised his chopsticks and started to say a grace over the food, but the idiot, who was impatient and hungry to boot, did not wait for him to finish before grabbing a red lacquered wooden bowl of white rice that he scooped up and gulped down in a single mouthful.</P>
<P>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; said the servant standing beside him, &#8220;you didn't think very carefully. If you are going to keep food in your sleeves shouldn't you take steamed bread instead of rice that will get your clothes duty?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I didn't put it in my sleeve,&#8221; chuckled Pig, &#8220;I ate it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But you didn't even open your mouth,&#8221; they said, &#8220;so how could you have eaten it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Who is lying then?&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;I definitely ate it. If you don't believe me I'll eat another to show you.&#8221; The servants carried the rice over, filled a bowlful, and passed it to Pig, who had it down his throat in a flash.</P>
<P>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; said the astonished servants, &#8220;you must have a throat built of whetstones, it's so smooth and slippery.&#8221; Pig had downed five or six bowls before the master could finish the short grace; only then did he pick up his chopsticks and start eating with them. The idiot grabbed whatever he could and bolted it, not caring whether it was rice or pasta, fruit or refreshments.</P>
<P>&#8220;More food, more food,&#8221; he shouted, until it gradually began to run out, &#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;don't eat so much. Make do with being half full. Anyhow, it's better than starving in a mountain hollow.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a horrible face you're making,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;As the saying goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The monk at a banquet who can't eat his fill</P>
<P>Would rather be buried alive on the hill.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Clear the things away and pay no more attention to him,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;We will be frank with you, reverend sirs,&#8221; said the two old men with bows. &#8220;We would have no problem in feeding a hundred or more reverend gentlemen with big bellies like him in the daytime, but it is late now and the remains of the maigre-feast have been put away. We only cooked a bushel of noodles, five bushels of rice and a few tables of vegetarian food to feed our neighbors and the clergy at the end of the service. We never imagined that you reverend gentlemen would turn up and put the monks to flight. We have not even been able to offer any food to our relations and neighbors as we have given it all to you. If you are still hungry we can have some more cooked.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;cook some more.&#8221;</P>
<P>After this exchange the tables and other things used for the banquet were tidied away. Sanzang bowed to his hosts to thank them for the meal, then asked them their surname. &#8220;We are called Chen,&#8221; they replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Then you are kinsmen of mine,&#8221; said Sanzang, putting his hands together in front of his chest.</P>
<P>&#8220;Is your surname Chen as Well?&#8221; the old men asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;Chen was my surname before I became a monk. May I ask why you were holding that religious feast just now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why brother to ask, Master?&#8221; said Pig with a laugh. &#8220;Anyone could tell you that it's bound to have been a feast for the new crops, or for safety, or for the end of funeral ceremonies.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No, it was not,&#8221; the old men said.</P>
<P>&#8220;Then what was it for?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;It was a feast to prepare for death,&#8221; the old men replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't know who you're talking to,&#8221; said Pig, falling about with laughter. &#8220;We could build a bridge out of lies. We're kings of deception. Don't try to fool us. As monks we know all about maigre-feasts. There are only preparatory maigre-feasts for transferring money to the underworld and for fulfilling vows. Nobody's died here, so why have a funeral feast?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This idiot's learning a bit of sense,&#8221; chuckled Monkey to himself.</P>
<P>&#8220;Old man,&#8221; he said aloud, &#8220;what you said must be wrong. How can you have a feast to prepare for death?&#8221;</P>
<P>At this the two old men bowed and replied, &#8220;And if you were going to fetch the scriptures why did you come here instead of taking the main route?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We were on the main route,&#8221; replied Monkey, &#8220;but a river was in our way and we weren't able to cross it. We came to your distinguished residence to ask for a night's shelter because we heard the drums and cymbals.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What did you see by the side of the river?&#8221; one of the old men asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Nothing but a stone tablet on which was written 'River of Heaven' above and '250 miles across; few travelers have ever been here' underneath,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Less than half a mile along the bank from the stone tablet is the Temple of the Great King of Miraculous Response,&#8221; the old man said. &#8220;Did you not see it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Would you old gentlemen tell me why he's called 'Miraculous Response?'&#8221;</P>
<P>The two old men burst into tears as they replied, &#8220;My lord, as for the Great King,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Because he responded a temple we built;</P>
<P>His miracles greatly the common folk helped.</P>
<P>He sends timely rain to the farms all about;</P>
<P>His clouds give their moisture to keep us from drought.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;But if he sends timely rain and clouds he's being kind to you,&#8221; said Brother Monkey, &#8220;so why are you so upset and miserable?&#8221; At this the old man stamped on the ground, beat his chest and wailed, &#8220;Master,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Great is our gratitude, greater our anger:</P>
<P>Although he is kind he is also a danger.</P>
<P>He is not one of the gods true and right&#8212;</P>
<P>To eat boys and girls is his evil delight.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;He likes eating boys and girls?&#8221; Brother Monkey exclaimed.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the old man.</P>
<P>&#8220;I suppose it's your family's turn now,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, this year it is our turn,&#8221; the old man said. &#8220;There are a hundred households living here. This place is called Chen Village, and it is in Yuanhui County of the Kingdom of Tarrycart. There is a sacrifice to the Great King every year at which a boy, a girl, pigs, sheep, oxen and wine have to be offered. If he gets his meal he gives us wind and rain at the right time; but if there is no sacrifice he sends disaster.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How many sons are there in your household?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>The old man beat his breast and said, &#8220;Alas, alas, we die of shame when you speak of sons. This is my brother, Chen Qing, who is fifty-seven. I am Chen Cheng and am sixty-two. We have both found great difficulty in having children. As I had no son my friends and relations persuaded me to take a concubine when I was nearly fifty. I had no option but to find one and we had a daughter. She is just seven this year, and we call her Pan of Gold.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's a very grand name,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;But why Pan of Gold?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Because we were childless we built bridges, repaired roads, contributed to putting up monasteries and pagodas, gave donations and fed monks. We kept an account of all this, and what with three ounces spent here and five spent there it added up to thirty pounds of gold by the time the girl was born. Thirty pounds is a pan of gold, and hence the name.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What about sons?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;My brother has a son who was also by a concubine. He is six this year, and we call him Chen Guan-given.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why did you call him that?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;In our family we worship Lord Guan Yu, and we called him Guan-given as it was from the statue of Lord Guan that we begged and obtained this son. My brother and I are 120 between us if you add our ages together, and these are our only two offspring. We never imagined that it would fall to us to provide the sacrificial offerings this year, and this is a duty we cannot escape. It is because as fathers we cannot bear to part from our children that we held this service to bring about rebirth, this maigre-feast to prepare for death.&#8221;</P>
<P>This brought the tears pouring down Sanzang's cheeks as he replied, &#8220;This is what the ancients mean when they said,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Long before the ripe ones the green plums always fall;</P>
<P>The harshness of heaven hits the childless worst of all.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey smiled at this and said, &#8220;Let me ask some more questions. Tell me, sir, how much property does your family have?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Quite a lot,&#8221; the younger old man replied. &#8220;About seven hundred acres of paddy fields, a thousand acres of dry fields, eighty or ninety fields of hay, two or three hundred water-buffalo and oxen, twenty or thirty donkeys and horses, and goodness only knows how many pigs, sheep, chickens and geese. We have more old grain piled up at home than we can eat, and more clothes than we can wear. That is the extent of our family's property.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's a pity you're so stingy with all your wealth,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you accuse us of being stingy?&#8221; the old man asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you're so rich,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;why give your own children to be sacrificed? You could buy a boy for fifty ounces and a girl for a hundred. With all the other expenses together it shouldn't cost you more than two hundred ounces of silver to keep your own children. Wouldn't that be better?&#8221;</P>
<P>To this the younger old man replied through his tears, &#8220;My lord, you don't realize that the Great King is miraculously responsive, and that he often calls on this household.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If he comes here have you seen what he looks like and how tall he is?&#8221; asked Brother Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;We don't see him,&#8221; the younger old man replied, &#8220;we just know that the Great King is coming when we smell a fragrant wind. Then we burn huge amounts of incense and all of us, young and old alike, prostrate ourselves in the direction of the wind. He knows every trifling detail about our household&#8212;even about our spoons and the bowls we use&#8212;and remembers all our dates of birth. He will only accept our own son and daughter. Never mind two or three hundred ounces of silver: we could not buy identical-looking children of exactly the same age for tens of thousands of ounces.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So it's like that,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Very well then, bring your son out for me to take a look at him.&#8221; Chen Qing hurried to the inner part of the house, brought Guan-given back with him into the hall, and set the boy down in front of the lamp. Not realizing the mortal danger he was in the little boy leapt about, filled his sleeves with fruit, ate and played around. Monkey looked at him, said a spell silently, shook himself, and made himself look just like Guan-given. Then the two boys started to jump and dance in front of the lamp, giving the two old men such a shock that they fell to their knees.</P>
<P>&#8220;That was a terrible thing for him to do, venerable sirs,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;But the gentleman was talking to us a moment ago,&#8221; said the old man. &#8220;How can he have turned into the exact likeness of my son? When you call them they respond and move together. This shock has shortened our lives. Please return to your normal appearance!&#8221; Monkey rubbed his face and was himself once more. &#8220;What powers you have, my lord,&#8221; said the old man, still on his knees.</P>
<P>&#8220;Was I like your son?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, just like him,&#8221; the old man replied. &#8220;Same face, same voice, same clothes, same height.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You didn't look carefully enough,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Get some scales and weigh me to see if I'm the same weight as him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes, the same weight,&#8221; the old man said.</P>
<P>&#8220;Would I do for the sacrifice like that?&#8221; asked Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Perfect,&#8221; said the old man, &#8220;just perfect. You would be accepted.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I shall take the child's place and keep him alive for your family to have descendants to burn incense to you,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I shall be offered to the Great King instead.&#8221; At this Chen Qing kowtowed as he knelt there, saying, &#8220;My lord, if in your mercy you were to take his place I will give His Reverence the Tang Priest a thousand ounces of silver towards the cost of his journey to the Western Heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Aren't you going to reward me?&#8221; asked Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;But if you are sacrificed in the boy's place it will be the end of you,&#8221; said the old man.</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The Great King will eat you,&#8221; the old man replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;He'd dare to eat me?&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;The only reason he might not eat you would be if he thought you would taste too high,&#8221; the old man said.</P>
<P>&#8220;Let Heaven do as it will,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;If I'm eaten up it'll be because I'm fated to have a short life; and if I'm not eaten it'll be because I'm lucky. Take me to the sacrifice.&#8221;</P>
<P>While Chen Qing kowtowed, expressed his thanks, and presented them with five hundred ounces of silver Chen Cheng neither kowtowed nor thanked Monkey, but leant against the doorway sobbing. As soon as Brother Monkey noticed this he went up to him, took hold of his clothes, and said, &#8220;Old man, is it because you can't bear to lose your daughter that you're not giving me anything or thanking me?&#8221;</P>
<P>Only then did Chen Cheng fall to his knees and reply, &#8220;Yes, I cannot bear to lose her. It is enough that in your great kindness you are saving my nephew by taking his place. But I have no son. She is my only child and she would weep for me bitterly after my death. I cannot bear to lose her.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Then you'd better go along at once and cook five bushels of rice and some good vegetarian dishes for that long-snouted venerable gentleman to eat. Then I'll make him turn into the likeness of your daughter and the two of us will be able to take part in the sacrifice. We'll see if we can do a meritorious deed and save your children's lives.&#8221;</P>
<P>These words came as a great shock to Pig, who said, &#8220;Brother, if you turn yourself into a spirit and leave me to die you'll be dragging me into disaster.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;as the saying goes, a chicken doesn't eat what it doesn't earn. We came in here and were given an ample meal, but you had to complain that you were still hungry. Why aren't you willing to help them in their crisis?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But, brother,&#8221; protested Pig, &#8220;I can't do transformations.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You can do thirty-six transformations,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;How can you possibly deny that?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wuneng,&#8221; Sanzang said to Pig, &#8220;what your brother says is absolutely correct, and he has made the right decision. As the saying goes, to save a human life is better than building a seven-storied pagoda. If you do this you will be thanking our hosts for their generous hospitality and accumulating good karma for yourself. Besides, it will be fun for you and your brother on this cool night when you have nothing else to do.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What are you saying, Master?&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;I can only change into a hill, a tree, a rock, a scabby elephant, a water-buffalo or a big, fat man. It'd be pretty hard for me to turn into a little girl.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Pay no attention to him,&#8221; said Monkey to Chen Cheng, &#8220;but bring your daughter out for me to see.&#8221;</P>
<P>Chen Cheng then hurried inside and came back into the hall with Pan of Gold in his arms; and everyone in the household, young and old, wives and concubines, members of the family and other relations, all came in to kowtow and beg Monkey to save the child's life. Round her hair the little girl was wearing a patterned turquoise headband from which hung ornaments representing the eight precious things. Her jacket was of red and yellow shot ramie, and over is she wore a cape in green imperial satin with a checked collar. Her skirt was of scarlet flowered silk, her shoes were of pink ramie and shaped like frogs' heads, and her trousers were of raw silk with gold thread. She was holding a piece of fruit in her hand and eating it.</P>
<P>&#8220;There's the girl,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Make yourself like her at once. We're off to the sacrifice.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But she's much too small and delicate for me to turn into, brother,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;Hurry up if you don't want me to hit you,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't hit me,&#8221; pleaded Pig in desperation. &#8220;I'll see if I can make the change.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot then said the words of a spell, shook his head several times, called &#8220;Change!&#8221; and really did make his head look like the little girl's. The only troubles was that his belly was still much too fat and disproportionately big.</P>
<P>&#8220;Change some more,&#8221; said Monkey with a laugh.</P>
<P>&#8220;Hit me then,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;I can't change any more, and that's that.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But you can't have a little girl's head on a monk's body,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;You won't do at all like that&#8212;you're neither a man nor a girl. Do the Dipper star-steps.&#8221; Monkey then blew on him with magic breath and in fact did change his body to make it look like the little girl's.</P>
<P>&#8220;Will you two old gentlemen please take the young master and the young lady inside and make no mistake about who they are,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;My brother and I will be trying to dodge the monster and fooling around, and we may come in here, so that it will be hard to tell us from the real children. Have some fruit ready for them to eat and don't let them cry, in case the Great King notices and our secret gets out. Now we're off to see if we can fool him.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage then told Friar Sand to look after the Tang Priest while Pig and he changed into Chen Guan-given and Pan of Gold. When the two of them were ready Monkey asked, &#8220;How are the victims presented? Tied up in a bundle, or with their hands roped together? Are they steamed or chopped up into little bits?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; pleaded Pig, &#8220;don't do me down. I haven't got those magic powers.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We would never dare to,&#8221; said the old men. &#8220;We would just like you two gentlemen each to sit in a red lacquer dish that would be put on a table. You would then be carried into the temple on the tables by a pair of youngsters.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Fine, fine,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Bring the dishes in here for us to try out.&#8221; The old men sent for the two red dishes, in which Monkey and Pig sat while four young men carried them for a few steps in the courtyard before setting them down again in the hall. &#8220;Pig,&#8221; said Monkey with delight, &#8220;being carried around on dishes like this makes us like abbots sitting in the seats of honour.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I wouldn't be at all scared of being carried in and out of here till dawn,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;but being carried into the temple to be eaten is no joke.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Just watch me,&#8221; said Brother Monkey, &#8220;and run away when he eats me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How do you know who he'll eat first?&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;If he eats the boy first I'll be able to get away; but what shall I do if he eats the girl first?&#8221;</P>
<P>At this one of the old men said, &#8220;During the sacrifices in other years some of the bolder of us have slipped into the back of the temple or hidden under the tables on which the offerings were made. They have seen that he eats the boy first and the girl afterwards.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Thank goodness,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;thank goodness.&#8221;</P>
<P>While the two brother-disciples were talking they heard a mighty noise of gongs and drums and a blaze of lights outside as the villagers opened the front gates and poured in, shouting, &#8220;Bring out the boy and the girl.&#8221; The four young men then carried Monkey and Pig out to the sobs and wails of the old men.</P>
<P>If you do not know whether they lost their lives or not, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>圣僧夜阻通天水</p>
<p>金木垂慈救小童</p>
</div>
<p>却说那国王倚着龙床，泪如泉涌，只哭到天晚不住。行者上前高呼道：“你怎么这等昏乱！见放着那道士的尸骸，一个是虎，一个是鹿，那羊力是一个羚羊。不信时，捞上骨头来看，那里人有那样骷髅？他本是成精的山兽，同心到此害你，因见气数还旺，不敢下手。若再过二年，你气数衰败，他就害了你性命，把你江山一股儿尽属他了。幸我等早来，除妖邪救了你命，你还哭甚？哭甚！急打发关文，送我出去。”国王闻此，方才省悟。那文武多官俱奏道：“死者果然是白鹿黄虎，油锅里果是羊骨。圣僧之言，不可不听。”国王道：“既是这等，感谢圣僧。今日天晚，教太师且请圣僧至智渊寺。明日早朝，大开东阁，教光禄寺安排素净筵宴酬谢。”果送至寺里安歇。次日五更时候，国王设朝，聚集多官，传旨：“快出招僧榜文，四门各路张挂。”一壁厢大排筵宴，摆驾出朝，至智渊寺门外，请了三藏等，共入东阁赴宴，不在话下。却说那脱命的和尚闻有招僧榜，个个欣然，都入城来寻孙大圣，交纳毫毛谢恩。这长老散了宴，那国王换了关文，同皇后嫔妃，两班文武，送出朝门。只见那些和尚跪拜道旁，口称：“齐天大圣爷爷！我等是沙滩上脱命僧人。闻知爷爷扫除妖孽，救拔我等，又蒙我王出榜招僧，特来交纳毫毛，叩谢天恩。”行者笑道：“汝等来了几何？”僧人道：“五百名，半个不少。”行者将身一抖，收了毫毛，对君臣僧俗人说道：“这些和尚实是老孙放了，车辆是老孙运转双关穿夹脊，捽碎了，那两个妖道也是老孙打死了。今日灭了妖邪，方知是禅门有道，向后来再不可胡为乱信。望你把三教归一，也敬僧，也敬道，也养育人才，我保你江山永固。”国王依言，感谢不尽，遂送唐僧出城去讫。</p>

<p>这一去，只为殷勤经三藏，努力修持光一元。晓行夜住，渴饮饥餐，不觉的春尽夏残，又是秋光天气。一日，天色已晚，唐僧勒马道：“徒弟，今宵何处安身也？”行者道：“师父，出家人莫说那在家人的话。”三藏道：“在家人怎么？出家人怎么？”行者道：“在家人，这时候温床暖被，怀中抱子，脚后蹬妻，自自在在睡觉；我等出家人，那里能够！便是要带月披星，餐风宿水，有路且行，无路方住。”八戒道：“哥哥，你只知其一，不知其二。如今路多险峻，我挑着重担，着实难走，须要寻个去处，好眠一觉，养养精神，明日方好捱担，不然，却不累倒我也？”行者道：</p>

<p>“趁月光再走一程，到有人家之所再住。”师徒们没奈何，只得相随行者往前。</p>

<p>又行不多时，只听得滔滔浪响。八戒道：“罢了！来到尽头路了！”沙僧道：“是一股水挡住也。”唐僧道：“却怎生得渡？”八戒道：“等我试之，看深浅何如。”三藏道：“悟能，你休乱谈，水之浅深，如何试得？”八戒道：“寻一个鹅卵石，抛在当中。若是溅起水泡来是浅，若是骨都都沉下有声是深。”行者道：“你去试试看。”那呆子在路旁摸了一块顽石，望水中抛去，只听得骨都都泛起鱼津，沉下水底。他道：“深深深！去不得！”唐僧道：</p>

<p>“你虽试得深浅，却不知有多少宽阔。”八戒道：“这个却不知，不知。”行者道：“等我看看。”好大圣，纵筋斗云，跳在空中，定睛观看，但见那：洋洋光浸月，浩浩影浮天。灵派吞华岳，长流贯百川。千层汹浪滚，万迭峻波颠。岸口无渔火，沙头有鹭眠。</p>

<p>茫然浑似海，一望更无边。急收云头，按落河边道：“师父，宽哩宽哩！去不得！老孙火眼金睛，白日里常看千里，凶吉晓得是，夜里也还看三五百里。如今通看不见边岸，怎定得宽阔之数？”</p>

<p>三藏大惊，口不能言，声音哽咽道：“徒弟啊，似这等怎了？”沙僧道：“师父莫哭，你看那水边立的，可不是个人么。”行者道：</p>

<p>“想是扳罾的渔人，等我问他去来。”拿了铁棒，两三步跑到面前看处，呀！不是人，是一面石碑。碑上有三个篆文大字，下边两行，有十个小字。三个大字乃“通天河”，十个小字乃“径过八百里，亘古少人行”。行者叫：“师父，你来看看。”三藏看见，滴泪道：“徒弟呀，我当年别了长安，只说西天易走，那知道妖魔阻隔，山水迢遥！”八戒道：“师父，你且听，是那里鼓钹声音？想是做斋的人家。我们且去赶些斋饭吃，问个渡口寻船，明日过去罢。”三藏马上听得，果然有鼓钹之声，“却不是道家乐器，足是我僧家举事。我等去来。”行者在前引马，一行闻响而来。那里有甚正路，没高没低，漫过沙滩，望见一簇人家住处，约摸有四五百家，却也都住得好，但见倚山通路，傍岸临溪。处处柴扉掩，家家竹院关。沙头宿鹭梦魂清，柳外啼鹃喉舌冷。短笛无声，寒砧不韵。红蓼枝摇月，黄芦叶斗风。陌头村犬吠疏篱，渡口老渔眠钓艇。灯火稀，人烟静，半空皎月如悬镜。忽闻一阵白蘋香，却是西风隔岸送。</p>

<p>三藏下马，只见那路头上有一家儿，门外竖一首幢幡，内里有灯烛荧煌，香烟馥郁。三藏道：“悟空，此处比那山凹河边，却是不同。在人间屋檐下，可以遮得冷露，放心稳睡。你都莫来，让我先到那斋公门首告求。若肯留我，我就招呼汝等；假若不留，你却休要撒泼。汝等脸嘴丑陋，只恐唬了人，闯出祸来，却倒无住处矣。”行者道：“说得有理。请师父先去，我们在此守待。”那长老才摘了斗笠，光着头，抖抖褊衫，拖着锡杖，径来到人家门外，见那门半开半掩，三藏不敢擅入。聊站片时，只见里面走出一个老者，项下挂着数珠，口念阿弥陀佛，径自来关门，慌得这长老合掌高叫：“老施主，贫僧问讯了。”那老者还礼道：</p>

<p>“你这和尚，却来迟了。”三藏道：“怎么说？”老者道：“来迟无物了。早来啊，我舍下斋僧，尽饱吃饭，熟米三升，白布一段，铜钱十文。你怎么这时才来？”三藏躬身道：“老施主，贫僧不是赶斋的。”老者道：“既不赶斋，来此何干？”三藏道：“我是东土大唐钦差往西天取经者，今到贵处，天色已晚，听得府上鼓钹之声，特来告借一宿，天明就行也。”那老者摇手道：“和尚，出家人休打诳语。东土大唐到我这里，有五万四千里路，你这等单身，如何来得？”三藏道：“老施主见得最是，但我还有三个小徒，逢山开路，遇水迭桥，保护贫僧，方得到此。”老者道：“既有徒弟，何不同来？”教：“请，请，我舍下有处安歇。”三藏回头叫声：“徒弟，这里来。”那行者本来性急，八戒生来粗鲁，沙僧却也莽撞，三个人听得师父招呼，牵着马，挑着担，不问好歹，一阵风闯将进去。那老者看见，唬得跌倒在地，口里只说是“妖怪来了！妖怪来了！”三藏搀起道：“施主莫怕，不是妖怪，是我徒弟。”老者战兢兢道：“这般好俊师父，怎么寻这样丑徒弟！”三藏道：“虽然相貌不中，却倒会降龙伏虎，捉怪擒妖。”老者似信不信的，扶着唐僧慢走。</p>

<p>却说那三个凶顽闯入厅房上，拴了马，丢下行李。那厅中原有几个和尚念经，八戒掬着长嘴喝道：“那和尚，念的是甚么经？”那些和尚听见问了一声，忽然抬头观看外来人，嘴长耳朵大。身粗背膊宽，声响如雷咋。行者与沙僧，容貌更丑陋。厅堂几众僧，无人不害怕。阇黎还念经，班首教行罢。难顾磬和铃，佛象且丢下。一齐吹息灯，惊散光乍乍。跌跌与爬爬，门槛何曾跨！你头撞我头，似倒葫芦架。清清好道场，翻成大笑话。</p>

<p>这兄弟三人，见那些人跌跌爬爬，鼓着掌哈哈大笑。那些僧越加悚惧，磕头撞脑，各顾性命，通跑净了，三藏搀那老者，走上厅堂，灯火全无，三人嘻嘻哈哈的还笑。唐僧骂道：“这泼物，十分不善！我朝朝教诲，日日叮咛。古人云，不教而善，非圣而何！</p>

<p>教而后善，非贤而何！教亦不善，非愚而何！汝等这般撒泼，诚为至下至愚之类！走进门不知高低，唬倒了老施主，惊散了念经僧，把人家好事都搅坏了，却不是堕罪与我？”说得他们不敢回言。那老者方信是他徒弟，急回头作礼道：“老爷，没大事，没大事，才然关了灯，散了花，佛事将收也。”八戒道：“既是了帐，摆出满散的斋来，我们吃了睡觉。”老者叫：“掌灯来！掌灯来！”</p>

<p>家里人听得，大惊小怪道：“厅上念经，有许多香烛，如何又教掌灯？”几个僮仆出来看时，这个黑洞洞的，即便点火把灯笼，一拥而至，忽抬头见八戒沙僧，慌得丢了火把，忽抽身关了中门，往里嚷道：“妖怪来了！妖怪来了！”</p>

<p>行者拿起火把，点上灯烛，扯过一张交椅，请唐僧坐在上面，他兄弟们坐在两旁，那老者坐在前面。正叙坐间，只听得里面门开处，又走出一个老者，拄着拐杖道：“是甚么邪魔，黑夜里来我善门之家？”前面坐的老者，急起身迎到屏门后道：“哥哥莫嚷，不是邪魔，乃东土大唐取经的罗汉。徒弟们相貌虽凶，果然是相恶人善。”那老者方才放下拄杖，与他四位行礼。礼毕，也坐了面前叫：“看茶来，排斋。”连叫数声，几个僮仆，战战兢兢，不敢拢帐。八戒忍不住问道：“老者，你这盛价，两边走怎的？”老者道：“教他们捧斋来侍奉老爷。”八戒道：“几个人伏侍？”老者道：“八个人。”八戒道：“这八个人伏侍那个？”老者道：“伏侍你四位。”八戒道：“那白面师父，只消一个人；毛脸雷公嘴的，只消两个人；那晦气脸的，要八个人；我得二十个人伏侍方彀。”老者道：“这等说，想是你的食肠大些。”八戒道：“也将就看得过。”老者道：“有人，有人。”七大八小，就叫出有三四十人出来。</p>

<p>那和尚与老者，一问一答的讲话，众人方才不怕。却将上面排了一张桌，请唐僧上坐；两边摆了三张桌，请他三位坐；前面一张桌，坐了二位老者。先排上素果品菜蔬，然后是面饭、米饭、闲食、粉汤，排得齐齐整整。唐长老举起箸来，先念一卷《启斋经》。那呆子一则有些急吞，二来有些饿了，那里等唐僧经完，拿过红漆木碗来，把一碗白米饭，扑的丢下口去，就了了。</p>

<p>旁边小的道：“这位老爷忒没算计，不笼馒头，怎的把饭笼了，却不污了衣服？”八戒笑道：“不曾笼，吃了。”小的道：“你不曾举口，怎么就吃了？”八戒道：“儿子们便说谎！分明吃了；不信，再吃与你看。”那小的们，又端了碗，盛一碗递与八戒。呆子幌一幌，又丢下口去就了了。众僮仆见了道：“爷爷呀！你是磨砖砌的喉咙，着实又光又溜！”那唐僧一卷经还未完，他已五六碗过手了，然后却才同举箸，一齐吃斋。呆子不论米饭面饭，果品闲食，只情一捞乱噇，口里还嚷：“添饭！添饭！”渐渐不见来了！</p>

<p>行者叫道：“贤弟，少吃些罢，也强似在山凹里忍饿，将就彀得半饱也好了。”八戒道：“嘴脸！常言道，斋僧不饱，不如活埋哩。”行者教：“收了家火，莫睬他！”二老者躬身道：“不瞒老爷说，白日里倒也不怕，似这大肚子长老，也斋得起百十众；只是晚了，收了残斋，只蒸得一石面饭、五斗米饭与几桌素食，要请几个亲邻与众僧们散福。不期你列位来，唬得众僧跑了，连亲邻也不曾敢请，尽数都供奉了列位。如不饱，再教蒸去。”八戒道：“再蒸去！再蒸去！”话毕收了家火桌席，三藏拱身，谢了斋供，才问：“老施主，高姓？”老者道：“姓陈。”三藏合掌道：“这是我贫僧华宗了。”老者道：“老爷也姓陈？”三藏道：“是，俗家也姓陈，请问适才做的甚么斋事？”八戒笑道：“师父问他怎的！岂不知道？必然是青苗斋、平安斋、了场斋罢了。”老者道：“不是，不是。”三藏又问：“端的为何？”老者道：“是一场预修亡斋。”八戒笑得打跌道：“公公忒没眼力！我们是扯谎架桥哄人的大王，你怎么把这谎话哄我！和尚家岂不知斋事？只有个预修寄库斋、预修填还斋，那里有个预修亡斋的？你家人又不曾有死的，做甚亡斋？”</p>

<p>行者闻言，暗喜道：“这呆子乖了些也。老公公，你是错说了，怎么叫做预修亡斋？”那二位欠身道：“你等取经，怎么不走正路，却蹡到我这里来？”行者道：“走的是正路，只见一股水挡住，不能得渡，因闻鼓钹之声，特来造府借宿。”老者道：“你们到水边，可曾见些甚么？”行者道：“止见一面石碑，上书通天河三字，下书‘径过八百里亘古少人行’十字，再无别物。”老者道：“再往上岸走走，好的离那碑记只有里许，有一座灵感大王庙，你不曾见？”行者道：“未见，请公公说说，何为灵感？”那两个老者一齐垂泪道：“老爷啊！那大王：感应一方兴庙宇，威灵千里祐黎民。年年庄上施甘露，岁岁村中落庆云。”行者道：“施甘雨，落庆云，也是好意思，你却这等伤情烦恼，何也？”那老者跌脚捶胸，哏了一声道：“老爷啊！虽则恩多还有怨，纵然慈惠却伤人。只因要吃童男女，不是昭彰正直神。”行者道：“要吃童男女么？”老者道：“正是。”行者道：“想必轮到你家了？”老者道：“今年正到舍下。我们这里，有百家人家居住。此处属车迟国元会县所管，唤做陈家庄。这大王一年一次祭赛，要一个童男，一个童女，猪羊牲醴供献他。他一顿吃了，保我们风调雨顺；若不祭赛，就来降祸生灾。”行者道：“你府上几位令郎？”老者捶胸道：“可怜！可怜！说甚么令郎，羞杀我等！这个是我舍弟，名唤陈清，老拙叫做陈澄。我今年六十三岁，他今年五十八岁，儿女上都艰难。我五十岁上还没儿子，亲友们劝我纳了一妾，没奈何寻下一房，生得一女，今年才交八岁，取名唤做一秤金。”八戒道：“好贵名！怎么叫做一秤金？”老者道：“我因儿女艰难，修桥补路，建寺立塔，布施斋僧，有一本帐目，那里使三两，那里使五两，到生女之年，却好用过有三十斤黄金。三十斤为一秤，所以唤做一秤金。”行者道：“那个的儿子么？”老者道：</p>

<p>“舍弟有个儿子，也是偏出，今年七岁了，取各唤做陈关保。”行者问：“何取此名？”老者道：“家下供养关圣爷爷，因在关爷之位下求得这个儿子，故名关保，我兄弟二人，年岁百二，止得这两个人种，不期轮次到我家祭赛，所以不敢不献。故此父子之情，难割难舍，先与孩儿做个超生道场，故曰预修亡斋者，此也。”三藏闻言，止不住腮边泪下道：“这正是古人云，黄梅不落青梅落，老天偏害没儿人。”行者笑道：“等我再问他。老公公，你府上有多大家当？”二老道：“颇有些儿，水田有四五十顷，旱田有六七十顷，草场有八九十处，水黄牛有二三百头，驴马有三二十匹，猪羊鸡鹅无数。舍下也有吃不着的陈粮，穿不了的衣服。家财产业，也尽得数。”行者道：“你这等家业，也亏你省将起来的。”老者道：“怎见我省？”行者道：“既有这家私，怎么舍得亲生儿女祭赛？拚了五十两银子，可买一个童男；拚了一百两银子，可买一个童女，连绞缠不过二百两之数，可就留下自己儿女后代，却不是好？”二老滴泪道：“老爷！你不知道，那大王甚是灵感，常来我们人家行走。”行者道：“他来行走，你们看见他是甚么嘴脸？有几多长短？”二老道：“不见其形，只闻得一阵香风，就知是大王爷爷来了，即忙满斗焚香，老少望风下拜。他把我们这人家，匙大碗小之事，他都知道，老幼生时年月，他都记得。只要亲生儿女，他方受用。不要说二三百两没处买，就是几千万两，也没处买这般一模一样同年同月的儿女。”行者道：“原来这等，也罢也罢，你且抱你令郎出来，我看看。”那陈清急入里面，将关保儿抱出厅上，放在灯前。小孩儿那知死活，笼着两袖果子，跳跳舞舞的，吃着耍子。行者见了，默默念声咒语，摇身一变，变作那关保儿一般模样。两个孩儿，搀着手，在灯前跳舞，唬得那老者谎忙跪着唐僧道：“老爷，不当人子！不当人子！这位老爷才然说话，怎么就变作我儿一般模样，叫他一声，齐应齐走！却折了我们年寿！请现本相！请现本相！行者把脸抹了一把，现了本相。那老者跪在面前道：</p>

<p>“老爷原来有这样本事。”行者笑道：“可象你儿子么？”老者道：</p>

<p>“象象象！果然一般嘴脸，一般声音，一般衣服，一般长短。”行者道：“你还没细看哩，取秤来称称，可与他一般轻重。”老者道：是是是，是一般重。”行者道：“似这等可祭赛得过么？”老者道：“忒好忒好！祭得过了！”行者道：“我今替这个孩儿性命，留下你家香烟后代，我去祭赛那大王去也。”那陈清跪地磕头道：</p>

<p>“老爷果若慈悲替得，我送白银一千两，与唐老爷做盘缠往西天去。”行者道：“就不谢谢老孙？”老者道：“你已替祭，没了你也。”行者道：“怎的得没了？”老者道：“那大王吃了。”行者道：</p>

<p>“他敢吃我？”老者道：“不吃你，好道嫌腥。”行者笑道：“任从天命，吃了我，是我的命短；不吃，是我的造化。我与你祭赛去。”</p>

<p>那陈清只管磕头相谢，又允送银五百两，惟陈澄也不磕头，也不说谢，只是倚着那屏门痛哭。行者知之，上前扯住道：</p>

<p>“老大，你这不允我，不谢我，想是舍不得你女儿么？”陈澄才跪下道：“是舍不得，敢蒙老爷盛情，救替了我侄子也彀了。但只是老拙无儿，止此一女，就是我死之后，他也哭得痛切，怎么舍得！”行者道：“你快去蒸上五斗米的饭，整治些好素菜，与我那长嘴师父吃，教他变作你的女儿，我兄弟同去祭赛，索性行个阴骘，救你两个儿女性命，如何？”那八戒听得此言，心中大惊道：“哥哥，你要弄精神，不管我死活，就要攀扯我。”行者道：</p>

<p>“贤弟，常言道，鸡儿不吃无工之食。你我进门，感承盛斋，你还嚷吃不饱哩，怎么就不与人家救些患难？”八戒道：“哥啊，你便会变化，我却不会哩。”行者道：“你也有三十六般变化，怎么不会？”唐僧叫：“悟能，你师兄说得最是，处得甚当。常言救人一命，胜造七级浮屠。一则感谢厚情，二来当积阴德，况凉夜无事，你兄弟耍耍去来。”八戒道：“你看师父说的话！我只会变山变树，变石头变癞象，变水牛变大胖汉还可，若变小女儿，有几分难哩。”行者道：“老大莫信他，抱出你令爱来看。”那陈澄急入里边，抱将一秤金孩儿，到了厅上。一家子，妻妾大小，不分老幼内外，都出来磕头礼拜，只请救孩儿性命。那女儿头上戴一个八宝垂珠的花翠箍，身上穿一件红闪黄的纻丝袄，上套着一件官绿缎子棋盘领的披风；腰间系一条大红花绢裙，脚下踏一双虾蟆头浅红纻丝鞋，腿上系两只绡金膝裤儿，也袖着果子吃哩。行者道：“八戒，这就是女孩儿，你快变的象他，我们祭赛去。”八戒道：“哥呀，似这般小巧俊秀，怎变？”行者叫：“快些！</p>

<p>莫讨打！”八戒谎了道：“哥哥不要打，等我变了看。”这呆子念动咒语，把头摇了几摇，叫“变！”真个变过头来，就也象女孩儿面目，只是肚子胖大，郎伉不象。行者笑道：“再变变！”八戒道：</p>

<p>“凭你打了罢！变不过来，奈何？”行者道：“莫成是丫头的头，和尚的身子？弄的这等不男不女，却怎生是好？你可布起罡来。”</p>

<p>他就吹他一口仙气，果然即时把身子变过，与那孩儿一般。便教：“二位老者，带你宝眷与令郎令爱进去，不要错了。一会家，我兄弟躲懒讨乖，走进去，转难识认。你将好果子与他吃，不可教他哭叫，恐大王一时知觉，走了风讯，等我两人耍子去也！”</p>

<p>好大圣，吩咐沙僧保护唐僧，他变作陈关保，八戒变作一秤金。二人俱停当了，却问：“怎么供献？还是捆了去，是绑了去？蒸熟了去，是剁碎了去？”八戒道：“哥哥，莫要弄我，我没这个手段。”老者道：“不敢不敢！只是用两个红漆丹盘，请二位坐在盘内，放在桌上，着两个后生抬一张桌子，把你们抬上庙去。”行者道：“好好好！拿盘子出来，我们试试。”那老者即取出两个丹盘，行者与八戒坐上，四个后生，抬起两张桌子，往天井里走走儿，又抬回放在堂上。行者欢喜道：“八戒，象这般子走走耍耍，我们也是上台盘的和尚了。”八戒道：“若是抬了去，还抬回来，两头抬到天明，我也不怕；只是抬到庙里，就要吃哩，这个却不是耍子！”行者道：“你只看着我，划着吃我时，你就走了罢。”八戒道：“知他怎么吃哩？如先吃童男，我便好跑；如先吃童女，我却如何？”老者道：“常年祭赛时，我这里有胆大的，钻在庙后，或在供桌底下，看见他先吃童男，后吃童女。”八戒道：“造化！造化！兄弟正然谈论，只听得外面锣鼓喧天，灯火照耀，同庄众人打开前门叫：“抬出童男童女来！”这老者哭哭啼啼，那四个后生将他二人抬将出去。端的不知性命何如，且听下回分解。</p>
