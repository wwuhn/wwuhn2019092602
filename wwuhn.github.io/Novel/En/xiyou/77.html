<P>When the Heart Spirit Stays in the Home the Demons Submit</P>
<P>The Mother of Wood Helps Bring Monsters to the Truth</P>
</div>
<P>The story tells how after the Great Sage had struggled in his stomach for a while the senior demon collapsed in the dust. He made no sound and was not breathing either. As he said nothing Monkey thought the demon was dead, so he stopped hitting him. When the demon chief recovered his breath he called out, &#8220;Most merciful and most compassionate Bodhisattva, Great Sage Equaling Heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My boy,&#8221; said Monkey when he heard this, &#8220;don't waste your effort. You could save yourself a few words by simply calling me Grandpa Sun.&#8221;</P>
<P>Desperate to save his skin, the evil monster really did call out, &#8220;Grandpa! Grandpa! I was wrong. I shouldn't have eaten you, and now you're destroying me. I beg you, Great Sage, in your mercy and compassion take pity on my antlike greed for life and spare me. If you do I'll escort your master across the mountain.&#8221;</P>
<P>Although the Great Sage was a tough hero he was most eager to help the Tang Priest in his journey, so on hearing the evil monster's pathetic pleas and flattery he decided once more to be kind.</P>
<P>&#8220;Evil monster,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;I'll spare your life. How are you going to escort my master?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We don't have any gold, silver, pearls, jade, agate, coral, crystal, amber, tortoiseshell or other such treasures here to give him, but my two brothers and I will carry him in a rattan chair across the mountain.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you could carry him in a chair that would be better than treasure,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile. &#8220;Open your mouth: I'm coming out.&#8221;</P>
<P>The demon then opened his mouth, whereupon the third chief went over to him and whispered in his ear, &#8220;Bite him as he comes out, brother. Chew the monkey to bits and swallow him. Then he won't be able to hurt you.&#8221;</P>
<P>Now Monkey could hear all this from inside, so instead of coming straight out he thrust his gold-banded cudgel out first as a test. The demon did indeed take a bite at it, noisily smashing one of his front teeth in the process.</P>
<P>&#8220;You're a nice monster, aren't you!&#8221; exclaimed Monkey, pulling his cudgel back. &#8220;I spare your life and agree to come out, but you try to murder me by biting me. I'm not coming out now. I'm going to kill you. I won't come out! I won't!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; the senior demon chief complained to the third one, &#8220;what you've done is destroy one of your own kind. I'd persuaded him to come out but you would have to tell me to bite him. Now I'm in agony from my broken tooth. What are we to do?&#8221;</P>
<P>In the face of the senior demon chief's complaints the third demon chief tried the method of making the enemy lose his temper.</P>
<P>&#8220;Sun the Novice,&#8221; he yelled at the top of his voice, &#8220;you have a thundering reputation. They tell of how mighty you were outside the Southern Gate of Heaven and at the Hall of Miraculous Mist. I'd heard that you've been capturing demons along your way to the Western Heaven. But now I see that you're only a very small-time ape.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What makes me small-time?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;A hero who only roams three hundred miles around will go three thousand miles to make his fame resound,&#8221; the third chief replied. &#8220;Come out and fight me if you're a real tough guy. What do you mean by messing about in someone else's stomach? If you're not small-time what are you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes, yes,&#8221; thought Monkey when he heard this. &#8220;It wouldn't be at all difficult for me to tear this demon's bowels to bits, rip up his liver, and kill him,&#8221; the Great Sage shouted. &#8220;But I'd destroy my own reputation in the process. I'll have to forget about it. Open your mouth and I'll come out and fight you. The only problem is that this cave of yours is much too cramped for me to use my weapons. We'll have to go somewhere where there's more room.&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing this the third demon chief mustered all the demons young and old from all around. There were over thirty thousand of them armed with the finest and sharpest weapons who came out of the cave to form a line of battle symbolizing heaven, earth and mankind. They were all waiting for Monkey to come out of the senior demon's mouth before rushing him. The second demon chief then helped the senior demon out through the entrance of the cave, where he shouted, &#8220;Sun the Novice! If you're such a tough guy, come out. There's good battlefield here for us to fight on.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Great Sage could tell that this was an open area from the calls of crows, magpies and cranes that he could hear in the monster's belly. &#8220;If I don't come out I'll be breaking faith with them,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;But if I do these demons are beasts at heart behind their human faces. They tried to lure me out and bite me when they promised to carry the master across the ridge. Now they've got their army here. Oh well! I'll let them have it both ways. I'll go out but I'll leave a root in his stomach too.&#8221;</P>
<P>With that he put his hand behind him to pluck a tiny hair from his tail, blew on it with magic breath, called &#8220;Change!&#8221; and made it into a string as fine as a hair but some four hundred feet long. As the string came outside it grew thicker in the wind. One end Monkey fastened round the evil monster's heart in a slip-knot that he did not tighten&#8212;if he had it would have caused great pain. The other end he held in his hand as he said to himself, &#8220;If they agree to escort my master across the ridge when I come out this time I'll leave it at that. But if they refuse and go for me with their weapons so hard that I can't cope with them I'll just need to pull this rope. I'll get the same results as if I were still inside.&#8221;</P>
<P>He then made himself tiny and crawled up as far as the throat, from where he could see that the evil spirit had opened his mouth wide. Rows of steel teeth were set above and below like sharp knives. &#8220;This is no good,&#8221; he thought at once, &#8220;no good at all. If I take this rope out through his mouth and he can't stand the pain he'll be able to cut through it with a single bite. I'll have to go out where there aren't any teeth.&#8221; The splendid Great Sage paid out the string as he crawled up the demon's upper palate and into his nostril, which made his nose itch. The demon sneezed with a loud &#8220;atchoo,&#8221; blowing Monkey out.</P>
<P>As he felt the wind blowing him Monkey bowed and grew over thirty feet long, keeping the string in one hand and holding the iron cudgel in the other. The wicked monster raised his steel sword as soon as he saw Monkey appear and hacked at his face. The Great Sage met the blow one-handed with his cudgel. Then the second demon chief with his spear and the third chief with his halberd went for him furiously. The Great Sage relaxed his pull on the rope, put his iron cudgel away and made off at speed by cloud, afraid that he would be unable to fight properly when surrounded by so many young devils. Once he had leapt out of the demons' camp he brought his cloud down on a spacious and empty mountain top and pulled with both hands on the rope as hard as he could. This gave the senior demon a pain in the heart. The demon struggled upwards in agony, whereupon the Great Sage pulled him down again.</P>
<P>As they all watched from afar the junior demons all shouted: &#8220;Don't provoke him, Your Majesty! Let him go. That ape has no sense of when things ought to be done. He's flying a kite before the beginning of April.&#8221; When the Great Sage heard this he gave a mighty stamp, at which the senior demon came whistling down out of the sky like a spinning-wheel to crash into the dust, making a crater some two feet deep in the hard earth at the foot of the mountain.</P>
<P>This gave the second and third demon chiefs such a fright that they landed their clouds together and rushed forward to grab hold of the rope and kneel at the foot of the mountain. &#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; they pleaded, &#8220;we thought you were an immortal of vast and boundless generosity. We'd never dreamed that you would be as small-minded as a rat or a snail. It's true that we lured you out to give battle, but we never expected that you would tie a rope round our eldest brother's heart&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're a thorough disgrace, you damned gang of demons,&#8221; said Monkey with a laugh. &#8220;Last time you tried to trick me into coming out so you could bite me and this time you've lured me out to face an army ready for battle. It's obvious that you've got tens of thousands of soldiers here to tackle me when I'm alone. Most unreasonable. I'll pull him away. I'm going to drag him off to see my master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If in your mercy and compassion you spare our lives, Great Sage,&#8221; the demons said, all kowtowing together, &#8220;we vow to escort your master across this mountain.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you want to live all you have to do is cut the rope with your sword,&#8221; said Monkey with a laugh.</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; the senior monster said, &#8220;I can cut the rope outside, but it's no good having the length inside that's tied round my heart. It sticks in my throat so uncomfortably that it makes me feel sick.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;open your mouth and I'll go back inside to undo the rope.&#8221; This alarmed the senior demon, who said, &#8220;If you don't come out when you go in this time I'll be in a mess, a real mess.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I know how to undo the end of the rope that's in you from the outside,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;But when I've undone it will you really escort my master across?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We will as soon as you've undone it,&#8221; the senior demon chief replied. &#8220;I wouldn't dare lie about this.&#8221; Now that he had satisfied himself the demon was telling the truth Monkey shook himself and put the hair back on his body, whereupon the monster's heart pains stopped. It was the Great Sage Sun's transforming magic that had tied the hair round his heart in the first place, which was why the pain ended as soon as the hair was put back on Monkey.</P>
<P>The three demon chiefs then rose up into the air to thank him with the words, &#8220;Please go back now, Great Sage, and pack your luggage. We will carry a chair down to fetch him.&#8221; The demon horde then all put their weapons down and went back into the cave.</P>
<P>Having put his rope away the Great Sage went straight back to the Eastern side of the ridge, and when he was still a long way away he saw the Tang Priest lying on the ground, rolling around and howling. Pig and Friar Sand had opened the bundles of luggage and were dividing it up.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't tell me,&#8221; thought Monkey with a quiet sigh. &#8220;No doubt Pig has told the master that I've been eaten up by evil spirits. The master's sobbing his heart out because he can't bear to be without me and the idiot's dividing the things ready for us all to split up. Oh dear! I can't be sure, so I'd better go down and give the master a shout.&#8221;</P>
<P>Bringing his cloud down, Monkey shouted, &#8220;Master!&#8221; As soon as Friar Sand heard this he started complaining to Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;All you want is to see people dead, just like a coffin stand,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our elder brother wasn't killed but you said he was and started this business here. Of course he's bound to kick up a row.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But I saw him with my own eyes being eaten up by the evil spirit in one mouthful,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;I'm sure we're just seeing that ape's spirit because it's an unlucky day.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey then went up to Pig and hit him in the face with a slap that sent him staggering. &#8220;Cretin!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Is this my spirit you can see?&#8221;</P>
<P>Rubbing his face, the idiot replied, &#8220;But the monster really did eat you up, brother. How can you&#8212;how can you have come back to life?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Useless gumboil!&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;After he ate me I grabbed his bowels, twisted his lungs, tied a rope round his heart and tore at him till he was in horrible agony. Then they all kowtowed and pleaded with me, so I spared his life. Now they're bringing a carrying-chair here to take the master over the mountain.&#8221;</P>
<P>As soon as Sanzang heard this he scrambled to his feet, bowed to Monkey and said, &#8220;Disciple, I've put you to enormous trouble. If I had believed what Wuneng said we would have been finished.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Chaff-guzzling idiot,&#8221; Monkey said abusively, taking a swing at Pig with his fist, &#8220;you're thoroughly lazy and barely human. But don't get upset, Master. The monsters are coming to take you across the mountain.&#8221; Friar Sand too felt deeply ashamed, and quickly trying to cover it up he packed up the luggage and loaded the horse to wait on the road.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story returns to the three demon chiefs, who led their devilish hosts back into the cave. &#8220;Elder brother,&#8221; said the second demon, &#8220;I'd imagined that Sun the Novice had nine heads and eight tails, but he turns out to be nothing but that pipsqueak of a monkey. You shouldn't have swallowed him. You should have fought him. He'd have been no match for us. With our tens of thousands of goblins we could have drowned him in our spit. But by swallowing him you let him use his magic and cause you agony, so that you didn't dare have it out with him. When I said we'd take the Tang Priest across the mountains just now I didn't mean it. It was only a way of luring him out because your life was in danger. I most certainly won't escort the Tang Priest.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why not, good brother?&#8221; the senior demon chief asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you and I draw up three thousand junior devils ready for battle I can capture that ape,&#8221; the second demon replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Never mind about three thousand,&#8221; the senior demon chief said. &#8220;You can have our whole force. If we capture him it'll be a credit to us all.&#8221;</P>
<P>The second demon chief then mustered three thousand junior demons whom he led to a place beside the main road, where they were put into battle formation. He sent a herald with a blue flag to carry a message.</P>
<P>&#8220;Sun the Novice,&#8221; the herald said, &#8220;come out at once and fight His Second Majesty.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Pig heard this he said with a laugh, &#8220;As the saying goes, brother, liars don't fool the people at home. You lied to us when you came back, you trickster. You said you'd beaten the evil spirits and that they'd be bringing a carrying-chair to take the master across. But here they are challenging you to battle. Why?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The senior demon did surrender to me,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and he wouldn't dare show his face. The sound of my name alone is enough to give him a headache. The second demon chief must be challenging me to battle because he can't bring himself to escort us across. I tell you, brother, those three evil spirits are brothers and they have a sense of honour. We're three brothers but we don't. I've beaten the senior demon, so the second demon's come out. There's no reason why you shouldn't fight him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm not scared of him,&#8221; Pig said. &#8220;I'll go and give him a fight.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you want to, go ahead,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig with a laugh, &#8220;I'll go, but lend me that rope.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you want it for?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;You don't know how to get into his belly or tie it to his heart, so what use would it be to you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I want it tied round my waist as a lifeline,&#8221; replied Pig. &#8220;You and Friar Sand are to hold on to it and let it out for me to fight him. If you think I'm beating him pay more rope out and I'll capture him, but if he's beating me, pull me back. Don't let him drag me off.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this Monkey smiled to himself and thought, &#8220;Another chance to make a fool of the idiot.&#8221; Monkey then tied the rope round Pig's waist and sent him off into battle.</P>
<P>The idiot lifted his rake and rushed up the steep slope shouting. &#8220;Come out, evil spirit! Come and fight your ancestor Pig!&#8221; The herald with the blue flag rushed back to report, &#8220;Your Majesty, there's a monk with a long snout and big ears here.&#8221; The second demon chief came out of the encampment, saw Pig, and without a word thrust his spear straight at Pig's face. The idiot raised his rake and went forward to parry the blow. The two of them joined battle in front of the mountainside, and before they had fought seven or eight rounds the idiot began to weaken. He was no longer able to hold the evil spirit off.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; he shouted, turning back in a hurry, &#8220;pull in the lifeline, pull in the lifeline!&#8221; When the Great Sage heard this from where he stood he loosened his hold on the rope and dropped it. The idiot started to run back now that he was defeated. At first he had not noticed the rope trailing behind him, but after he turned back, relaxing the tension on it, it started to get tangled round his legs. He tripped himself over, climbed to his feet and tripped over again. At first he only staggered, but then he fell facedown into the dust. The evil spirit caught up with him, unwound his trunk that was like a python, wrapped it round Pig and carried him back in triumph to the cave. The devilish host chorused a paean of victory as they swarmed back.</P>
<P>When Sanzang saw all this from the foot of the slope he became angry with Monkey. &#8220;Wukong,&#8221; he said, &#8220;no wonder Wuneng wishes you were dead. You brother-disciples don't love each other at all. All you feel is jealousy. He told you to pull in his lifeline, so why didn't you? Why did you drop the rope instead? What are we to do now you have got him killed?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're covering up for him again, Master,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;and showing favoritism too. I'm fed up. When I was captured it didn't bother you at all. I was dispensable. But when that idiot gets himself caught you blame me for it. Let him suffer. It'll teach him how hard it is to fetch the scriptures.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;was I not worried when you went? I remembered that you could change into other things, so I was sure you would come to no harm. But the idiot was born clumsy and can't transform himself, which makes this a very dangerous business. You must go and rescue him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop complaining, Master,&#8221; said Brother Monkey. &#8220;I'll go and save him.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey rushed up the mountain thinking resentfully, &#8220;I'm not going to make life easy for that idiot if he wishes me dead. I'll go and see what the evil spirits are doing with him. Before I rescue him I'll let him suffer a bit.&#8221; He then made magic with his hands, said the words of a spell, shook himself, turned into the tiniest of insects and flew into the cave, where he landed at the bottom of one of Pig's ears to be taken inside with the evil spirit. The second demon chief had led his three thousand junior devils trumpeting and drumming loudly to the cave, where they stopped.</P>
<P>He now took Pig inside and said, &#8220;I've got one, elder brother.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Show me,&#8221; the senior demon replied.</P>
<P>Unwinding his trunk the second demon chief flung Pig to the ground and said, &#8220;There he is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That one's useless,&#8221; said the senior demon.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; put in Pig when he heard this, &#8220;if I'm no use let me go and find a more useful one to capture.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He may not be any use,&#8221; said the third demon chief, &#8220;but he is the Tang Priest's disciple Zhu Bajie. Tie him up and put him to soak in the pool at the back. When his bristles have been soaked off we can open his belly up, salt him and dry him in the sun. He'll go down well with some wine on a rainy day.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's that then,&#8221; exclaimed Pig in horror. &#8220;I've fallen into the clutches of a demon who's a salt-pork peddler.&#8221; The demon hordes fell on him, tied his hands and feet together, carried him to the pool at the back, pushed him in and went back.</P>
<P>When the Great Sage flew there to have a look he saw the idiot with his four limbs pointing upwards and his snout downwards as he half floated and was half sinking, grunting through his snout. He really was a ridiculous sight, like a big blackened frost-bitten lotus pod that has shed its seeds in September or October. Seeing his face the Great Sage felt both loathing and pity for him.</P>
<P>&#8220;What shall I do?&#8221; he wondered. &#8220;After all, he is another member of the Dragon Flower Assembly. I just wish he wouldn't keep trying to divide up the luggage, split our band, and incite the master to say the Band-tightening Spell. The other day I heard Friar Sand say that he'd stashed some money away for himself. I wonder if it's true. I'll give him a scare and find out.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage flew down to his ear and called in a disguised voice, &#8220;Zhu Wuneng, Zhu Wuneng.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is terrible,&#8221; thought Pig in alarm, &#8220;Wuneng is the name the Bodhisattva Guanyin gave me. I've been called Zhu Bajie all the time I've been with the Tang Priest. How can there be anyone here who knows my name is Wuneng?&#8221; So he could not restrain himself from asking, &#8220;Who's that calling my Buddhist name?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Me,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; the idiot asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm a catcher,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where from, sir?&#8221; asked Pig in terror.</P>
<P>&#8220;From the Fifth King of the Underworld, and he's sent me to fetch you,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Then please go back and ask the Fifth King as he's such a good friend of my senior fellow-disciple Sun Wukong to give me a day's grace. You can come for me tomorrow.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're talking nonsense,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;If King Yama of Hell decides you're to die in the third watch nobody will keep you till the fourth. Come with me at once if you don't want me to put a rope round your neck and drag you off.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do me a favour,&#8221; said the idiot. &#8220;Even with a face like mine still want to go on living. I'll certainly die if I have to, but give me a day till these evil spirits have captured my master and the rest of us, so I can see them again before we're all done for.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well then,&#8221; said Monkey, grinning to himself. &#8220;I've got about thirty people to capture around here in this batch. When I've caught them I'll come back for you. That'll give you a day's grace. Give me some money. I'm sure you've got some.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Oh dear,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;we monks don't have money.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you haven't then I'm dragging you off,&#8221; said Brother Monkey. &#8220;Come with me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be so impatient, sir,&#8221; said the idiot, panicking. &#8220;I know that rope of yours is what they call the life-taking rope. Once It's round you you're dead. Yes, I have got some money. I've got a bit, but not much.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where is it?&#8221; Monkey demanded. &#8220;Give it me at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Oh dear, what a pity!&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;From when I became a monk right up till now the kind people who feed monks have given me a bit more alms than the others because my belly's so big. I saved all the little bits of silver till I had about half an ounce. They were awkward to keep, so when we were in a city some time ago I asked a silversmith to melt them all together. The wicked man stole a few grains of it, so the ingot he made only weighed forty-six hundredths of an ounce. Take it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The idiot hasn't even got his trousers on,&#8221; grinned Monkey to himself, &#8220;so where can he have hidden it? Hey, where's your silver?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's stuffed inside my left ear,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;I can't get it myself because I'm tied up, so take it out yourself.&#8221; When Monkey heard this he put his hand out and took the silver from inside Pig's ear. It was indeed an ingot shaped like a saddle that weighed only forty-five or forty-six hundredths of an ounce. As he held it in his hands Monkey could not help roaring with laughter.</P>
<P>Recognizing Monkey's voice the idiot started cursing him wildly from the water: &#8220;Damn and blast you, Protector of the Horses, for coming to extort money from me when I'm in such misery.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've got you now, you dreg-guzzler!&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Goodness only knows what I've had to suffer for the sake of protecting the master, while you've been making your fortune.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; Pig retorted. &#8220;Call this a fortune? It's just what I've scraped off my teeth. I resisted spending it on my stomach, so I saved it to buy myself some cloth to get a tunic made. You've got it out of me by intimidation. You ought to share it with me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You won't get a cent of it,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;I've paid you to spare my life,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;so now you damn well ought to rescue me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be so impatient,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'll rescue you all in good time.&#8221; Putting the silver away he turned back into himself and used his cudgel to bring Pig close enough to grab him by his feet, drag him ashore and untie him. Pig then sprang up, took off his clothes, wrung them out, shook them, and draped them still dripping wet over his shoulders.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; he said, &#8220;open the back gates. Let's go.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no glory in sneaking out the back way,&#8221; replied Monkey. &#8220;We'll leave by the front gates.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My feet are still numb after being tied up,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;I can't run.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Buck up and come with me,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage charged out, clearing his way by swinging his cudgel. The idiot had no choice but to endure the pain and keep close to him. When he saw the rake propped up by the second pair of gates he went over to it, pushed the junior devils aside, retrieved it and rushed forward, lashing out wildly. He and Brother Monkey charged through three or four pairs of gates, and goodness only knows how many junior devils they killed.</P>
<P>When the senior demon chief heard all this he said to the second chief, &#8220;You captured a fine one! A fine one indeed! Look! Sun the Novice has rescued Pig and they've wounded or killed the juniors on the gates.&#8221; The second demon at once sprang to his feet and rushed out through the gates brandishing his spear.</P>
<P>&#8220;Damned macaque,&#8221; he shouted at the top of his voice. &#8220;What a nerve! How dare you treat us with such contempt!&#8221; As soon as the Great Sage heard this he stopped still. The monster thrust his spear straight at him without allowing any argument. With the unhurried skill of the expert Monkey raised his iron cudgel to hit back at the demon's face. The two of them fought a splendid battle outside the entrance to the cave:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The yellow-tusked elephant in human form</P>
<P>Had sworn brotherhood with the Lion King.</P>
<P>Persuaded by the senior monster</P>
<P>They plotted together to eat the Tang Priest.</P>
<P>Huge were the powers of the Great Sage, Heaven's equal,</P>
<P>Who helped the good against the bad and killed off demons,</P>
<P>The incompetent Pig had met with disaster,</P>
<P>So Monkey saved him and led him outside.</P>
<P>When the demon king pursued them with great ferocity</P>
<P>The spear and the cudgel each showed off its powers.</P>
<P>The spear moved like a snake in the woods;</P>
<P>The cudgel arose like a dragon from the sea.</P>
<P>Where the dragon emerged the clouds were thick;</P>
<P>Dense hung the mist where the snake went through the woods.</P>
<P>It was all for the sake of the Tang Priest</P>
<P>That they fought each other with ferocity and hatred.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When he saw the Great Sage start fighting the evil spirit, Pig stood on the spur, his rake upright. Instead of joining in to help, he watched with stupefied amazement. Monkey's cudgel was so powerful and his martial skills so faultless the evil spirit used his spear to parry Monkey's blows while unrolling his trunk to wrap round him. As Monkey knew about this trick he held his gold-banded cudgel out horizontally in both hands and raised them. The evil spirit's trunk caught Monkey round the waist but missed his hands. Just watch how Monkey belabors the evil spirit's trunk with his cudgel.</P>
<P>When Pig saw this he beat his chest and said, &#8220;Oh dear! That monster's got lousy luck. When he caught me he got my arms too because I'm so clumsy, but he didn't when he caught that slippery character. He's got his cudgel in both hands, and all he needs to do is shove it up the monster's trunk to give him such a pain in the nostrils that it'll make the snot run. The monster'll never be able to hold him.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey had not thought of this before Pig gave him the idea, but now he waved his cudgel to make it as thick as a hen's egg and over ten feet long and actually did shove it hard up the monster's trunk. This gave the evil spirit such a shock that he unraveled his trunk with a swishing noise. Monkey brought his hand round to grab the trunk and drag it forcefully towards him. To spare himself any more agony the monster stepped out and moved with Monkey's hand. Only then did Pig dare approach, raising his rake to hit wildly at the monster's flanks.</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Brother Monkey, &#8220;that's no good. The prongs of your rake are so sharp they might break his skin. If he starts bleeding heavily and the master sees it he'll say we've been killing again. You'd better turn it round and hit him with the handle.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot then raised the handle of his rake and struck the monster at every step while Monkey dragged him by the trunk. They looked like a pair of elephant boys as they led him down to the foot of the mountain, where Sanzang could be seen gazing with concentration at the two of them coming noisily towards him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wujing,&#8221; he said to Friar Sand, &#8220;what is it Wukong is leading?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; replied Friar Sand when he saw them, &#8220;big brother is dragging an evil spirit here by the nose. He really enjoys slaughter.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Splendid, splendid,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;What a big evil spirit, and what a long nose! Go and ask him if he's happy and willing to escort us over the-mountain. If he is he must be spared and not be killed.&#8221;</P>
<P>Friar Sand at once rushed straight towards them shouting, &#8220;The master says you mustn't kill the monster if he's really willing to escort him across the mountain.&#8221; As soon as he heard this the demon fell to his knees and promised to do so in a very nasal voice. His voice was like this because Monkey was pinching his nostrils shut, making it sound as though he had a heavy cold.</P>
<P>&#8220;Lord Tang,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I'll carry you across by chair if you spare my life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My master and we disciples are good people.&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;As you've said this we'll spare your life. Fetch the chair at once. If you break your word again we most certainly won't spare your life when we catch you next time.&#8221; The freed monster kowtowed and left. Monkey and Pig went to report to the Tang Priest on everything that had happened to them. Pig was overcome with shame as he spread his clothes out to dry in the sun while they waited.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The second demon chief returned trembling and shaking to the cave. Even before his return some junior devils had reported to the senior and the third demon chiefs that Monkey had dragged him off by the trunk. In his anxiety the senior demon had led his hosts out with the third demon when they saw the second chief coming back alone. As they brought him inside and asked him why he had been released the second chief told them all about Sanzang's words of mercy and goodness. They looked at each other, at a loss for words.</P>
<P>&#8220;Elder brother,&#8221; said the second demon chief, &#8220;shall we take Sanzang across?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a thing to say, brother,&#8221; replied the senior chief. &#8220;Sun the Novice is a monkey who shows the greatest benevolence and sense of justice. If he had wanted to kill me when he was in my stomach he could most certainly have done so. He only grabbed your trunk. He might have dragged you off and not let you go. All he did was to pinch your trunk and break its skin, and that's given you a scare. Get ready at once to take them across.&#8221;</P>
<P>The third demon chief smiled and said, &#8220;Yes, yes, yes!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;From the way you're talking, my good brother,&#8221; said the senior demon, &#8220;it sounds as though you're reluctant to let the Tang Priest go. If you don't, we'll take him across.&#8221;</P>
<P>The third demon chief smiled again and said, &#8220;Elder brothers, it would have been luckier for those monks if they hadn't asked us to escort them but had slipped quietly across instead. By asking us to escort them they've fallen in with our plan to lure the tiger down from the mountain.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean by 'luring the tiger from the mountain?'&#8220; the senior demon asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Summon all the demons in our cave,&#8221; the third demon chief continued. &#8220;Choose one thousand from the ten thousand of them, then a hundred from the thousand, then sixteen and thirty from the hundred.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why do you want sixteen and thirty?&#8221; the senior demon asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The thirty must be good cooks,&#8221; the third demon chief replied. &#8220;Give them the best rice and flour, bamboo shoots, tea, gill fungus, button mushrooms, beancurd and wheat gluten. Send them to put up a shelter seven to ten miles along the way and lay on a meal for the Tang Priest.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;And what do you want the sixteen for?&#8221; the senior demon asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Eight to carry the chair and eight to shout and clear the way,&#8221; the third demon replied. &#8220;We brothers will accompany them for a stage of their journey. About 150 miles West of here is my city, and I've plenty of troops there to greet them. When they get to the city we'll do such and such and so on... The Tang Priest and his disciples won't be able to see what's happening to them. Whether we catch the Tang Priest or not depends completely on those sixteen demons.&#8221;</P>
<P>The senior demon was beside himself with delight on hearing this. It was as if he had recovered from a drunken stupor or woken up from a dream. &#8220;Excellent, excellent,&#8221; he said, whereupon he mustered the demons, chose thirty to whom he gave the food and another sixteen to carry a rattan chair. As they set out the senior demon gave the following instructions to the rest of the demons: &#8220;None of you are to go out on the mountain. Sun the Novice is a very cautious ape, and if he sees any of you around he'll be suspicious and see through our plan.&#8221;</P>
<P>The senior demon then led his underlings to a place beside the main road, where he called aloud, &#8220;Lord Tang, today's not an unlucky one, so please come across the mountain straight away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Who is that calling me, Wukong?&#8221; Sanzang asked when he heard this.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's the demons I beat,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;They're bringing a chair to carry you.&#8221;</P>
<P>Putting his hands together in front of his chest Sanzang looked up to the sky and said, &#8220;Splendid, splendid! But for my worthy disciple's great abilities I could not proceed on my journey.&#8221; He then walked forward to greet the demons with the words, &#8220;I am most grateful for the consideration you gentlemen are showing. When my disciples and I return to Chang'an we will praise your admirable achievements.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please get into the carrying-chair, my lord,&#8221; the demons said, kowtowing. Having mortal eyes and body Sanzang did not realize that this was a trick. The Great Sage Sun, a golden immortal of the Supreme Monad with a loyal nature, thought that because he had captured and released the demons they were now won over. He never imagined that they had other plots in mind, so he did not investigate closely but went along with his master's ideas. He told Pig to tie the luggage on the horse and keep close to the master with Friar Sand while he cleared the way with his iron cudgel, watching out to see if all was well. While eight devils carried the chair and eight shouted in turn to clear the way the three demon chiefs steadied the poles of the chair. The master was delighted to sit upright in it and go up the high mountain by the main track, little realizing that</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Great grief would return in the midst of rejoicing;</P>
<P>&#8220;Extremes,&#8221; says the classic, &#8220;create their negation.&#8221;</P>
<P>Fated they were to meet with disaster,</P>
<P>A star of ill-omen to mark desolation.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The band of demons worked with one mind to escort them and serve them diligently at all times. After ten miles there was a vegetarian meal and after fifteen more miles another one. They were invited to rest before it grew late, and everything along their way was neat and tidy. Each day they had three most satisfactory and delightful meals and spent a comfortable night where they were able to sleep well.</P>
<P>When they had traveled about 150 miles West they found themselves near a walled city. Raising his iron cudgel the Great Sage, who was only a third of a mile ahead of the carrying-chair, was so alarmed by the sight of the city that he fell over and was unable to rise to his feet. Do you know why someone of his great courage was so frightened by what he saw? It was because he saw a very evil atmosphere hanging over the town.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Crowds of evil demons and monsters,</P>
<P>Wolf spirits at all four gates.</P>
<P>Striped tigers are the commanders;</P>
<P>White-faced tiger-cats are senior officers.</P>
<P>Antlered stags carry documents around;</P>
<P>Cunning foxes walk along the streets.</P>
<P>Thousand-foot pythons slither round the walls;</P>
<P>Twenty-mile serpents occupy the roads.</P>
<P>At the base of high towers gray wolves shout commands;</P>
<P>Leopards speak in human voices by pavilions.</P>
<P>Standard-bearers and drummers&#8212;all are monsters;</P>
<P>Mountain spirits patrol and stand sentry;</P>
<P>Crafty hares open shops to trade;</P>
<P>Wild boars carry their loads to do business.</P>
<P>What used to be the capital of a heavenly dynasty</P>
<P>Has now become a city of wolves and tigers.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Just as he was being overcome by terror the Great Sage heard a wind from behind him and turned quickly to see the third demon chief raising a heaven-square halberd with a patterned handle to strike at his head. Springing to his feet, the Great Sage struck back at the monster's face with his gold-banded cudgel. Both of them were snorting with rage and fury as they ground their teeth and fought a wordless struggle. Monkey then saw the senior demon chief giving out orders as he lifted his steel saber to hack at Pig. Pig was in such a rush that he had to let the horse go as he swung his rake around to hit wildly back. Meanwhile the second demon chief was thrusting with his spear at Friar Sand, who parried with his demon-quelling staff.</P>
<P>The three demon chiefs and the three monks were now all fighting in single combat, ready to throw away their lives. The sixteen junior devils obeyed their orders, each giving play to his talents as they grabbed hold of the white horse and the luggage and crowded round Sanzang, lifting up his chair and carrying him straight to the city.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Senior Majesty, please decide what to do now we've captured the Tang Priest,&#8221; they shouted. All the demons of every rank on the city walls came rushing down to throw the city gates wide open. Every battalion was ordered to furl its flag, silence its drums, and on no account shout war-cries or strike gongs.</P>
<P>&#8220;His Senior Majesty has given orders that the Tang Priest is not to be frightened. He can't endure being scared. If he is, his flesh will turn sour and be inedible.&#8221; The demons were all delighted to welcome Sanzang, bowing and carrying him into the throne hall of the palace, where he was invited to sit in the place of honour. They offered him tea and food as they bustled around him in attendance. The venerable elder felt dizzy and confused as he looked about and saw no familiar faces.</P>
<P>If you don't know whether he was to escape with his life listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>心神居舍魔归性</p>
<p>木母同降怪体真</p>
</div>
<p>话表孙大圣在老魔肚里支吾一会，那魔头倒在尘埃，无声无气，若不言语，想是死了，却又把手放放。魔头回过气来，叫一声：“大慈大悲齐天大圣菩萨！”行者听见道：“儿子，莫废工夫，省几个字儿，只叫孙外公罢。”那妖魔惜命，真个叫：“外公！</p>

<p>外公！是我的不是了！一差二误吞了你，你如今却反害我。万望大圣慈悲，可怜蝼蚁贪生之意，饶了我命，愿送你师父过山也。”大圣虽英雄，甚为唐僧进步，他见妖魔哀告，好奉承的人，也就回了善念，叫道：“妖怪，我饶你，你怎么送我师父？”老魔道：“我这里也没甚么金银、珠翠、玛瑙、珊瑚、琉璃、琥珀、玳瑁珍奇之宝相送，我兄弟三个，抬一乘香藤轿儿，把你师父送过此山。”行者笑道：“既是抬轿相送，强如要宝。你张开口，我出来。”那魔头真个就张开口。那三魔走近前，悄悄的对老魔道：</p>

<p>“大哥，等他出来时，把口往下一咬，将猴儿嚼碎，咽下肚，却不得磨害你了。”原来行者在里面听得，便不先出去，却把金箍棒伸出，试他一试。那怪果往下一口，扢喳的一声，把个门牙都迸碎了。行者抽回棒道：“好妖怪！我倒饶你性命出来，你反咬我，要害我命！我不出来，活活的只弄杀你！不出来！不出来！”老魔报怨三魔道：“兄弟，你是自家人弄自家人了。且是请他出来好了，你却教我咬他。他倒不曾咬着，却迸得我牙龈疼痛，这是怎么起的！“三魔见老魔怪他，他又作个激将法，厉声高叫道：</p>

<p>“孙行者，闻你名如轰雷贯耳，说你在南天门外施威，灵霄殿下逞势。如今在西天路上降妖缚怪，原来是个小辈的猴头！”行者道：“我何为小辈？”三怪道：“好汉千里客，万里去传名。你出来，我与你赌斗，才是好汉；怎么在人肚里做勾当！非小辈而何？”行者闻言，心中暗想道：“是是是！我若如今扯断他肠，揌破他肝，弄杀这怪，有何难哉？但真是坏了我的名头。也罢！也罢！你张口，我出来与你比并。但只是你这洞口窄逼，不好使家火，须往宽处去。”三魔闻说，即点大小怪，前前后后，有三万多精，都执着精锐器械，出洞摆开一个三才阵势，专等行者出口，一齐上阵。那二怪搀着老魔，径至门外叫道：“孙行者！好汉出来！此间有战场，好斗！”</p>

<p>大圣在他肚里，闻得外面鸦鸣鹊噪，鹤唳风声，知道是宽阔之处，却想着：“我不出去，是失信与他；若出去，这妖精人面兽心。先时说送我师父，哄我出来咬我，今又调兵在此。也罢也罢，与他个两全其美：出去便出去，还与他肚里生下一个根儿。”即转手，将尾上毫毛拔了一根，吹口仙气，叫“变！”即变一条绳儿，只有头发粗细，倒有四十丈长短。那绳儿理出去，见风就长粗了。把一头拴着妖怪的心肝系上，打做个活扣儿，那扣儿不扯不紧，扯紧就痛。却拿着一头笑道：“这一出去，他送我师父便罢；如若不送，乱动刀兵，我也没工夫与他打，只消扯此绳儿，就如我在肚里一般！”又将身子变得小小的，往外爬，爬到咽喉之下，见妖精大张着方口，上下钢牙，排如利刃，忽思量道：“不好！不好！若从口里出去扯这绳儿，他怕疼，往下一嚼，却不咬断了？我打他没牙齿的所在出去。”好大圣，理着绳儿，从他那上腭子往前爬，爬到他鼻孔里。那老魔鼻子发痒，“阿口妻”的一声，打了个喷嚏，却迸出行者。行者见了风，把腰躬一躬，就长了有三丈长短，一只手扯着绳儿，一只手拿着铁棒。那魔头不知好歹，见他出来了，就举钢刀，劈脸来砍，这大圣一只手使铁棒相迎。又见那二怪使枪，三怪使戟，没头没脸的乱上。大圣放松了绳，收了铁棒，急纵身驾云走了，原来怕那伙小妖围绕，不好干事。他却跳出营外，去那空阔山头上，落下云，双手把绳尽力一扯，老魔心里才疼。他害疼往上一挣，大圣复往下一扯。众小妖远远看见，齐声高叫道：“大王，莫惹他！让他去罢！这猴儿不按时景，清明还未到，他却那里放风筝也！”</p>

<p>大圣闻言，着力气蹬了一蹬，那老魔从空中，拍刺刺似纺车儿一般跌落尘埃，就把那山坡下死硬的黄土跌做个二尺浅深之坑。慌得那二怪三怪一齐按下云头，上前拿住绳儿，跪在坡下哀告道：“大圣啊，只说你是个宽洪海量之仙，谁知是个鼠腹蜗肠之辈。实实的哄你出来，与你见阵，不期你在我家兄心上拴了一根绳子！”行者笑道：“你这伙泼魔，十分无礼！前番哄我出去便就咬我，这番哄我出来，却又摆阵敌我。似这几万妖兵，战我一个，理上也不通，扯了去！扯了去见我师父！”那怪一齐叩头道，“大圣慈悲，饶我性命，愿送老师父过山！”行者笑道：“你要性命，只消拿刀把绳子割断罢了。”老魔道：“爷爷呀，割断外边的，这里边的拴在心上，喉咙里又菾菾的恶心，怎生是好？”</p>

<p>行者道：“既如此，张开口，等我再进去解出绳来。”老魔慌了道：“这一进去，又不肯出来，却难也！却难也！”行者道：“我有本事外边就可以解得里面绳头也，解了可实实的送我师父么？”老魔道：“但解就送，决不敢打诳语。”大圣审得是实，即便将身一抖，收了毫毛，那怪的心就不疼了。这是孙大圣掩样的法儿，使毫毛拴着他的心，收了毫毛，所以就不害疼也。三个妖纵身而起，谢道：“大圣请回，上复唐僧，收拾下行李，我们就抬轿来送。”众怪偃干戈，尽皆归洞。</p>

<p>大圣收绳子，径转山东，远远的看见唐僧睡在地下打滚痛哭，猪八戒与沙僧解了包袱，将行李搭分儿，在那里分哩。行者暗暗嗟叹道：“不消讲了，这定是八戒对师父说我被妖精吃了，师父舍不得我痛哭，那呆子却分东西散火哩。咦！不知可是此意，且等我叫他一声看。”落下云头叫道：“师父！”沙僧听见，报怨八戒道：“你是个棺材座子，专一害人！师兄不曾死，你却说他死了，在这里干这个勾当！那里不叫将来了？”八戒道：“我分明看见他被妖精一口吞了。想是日辰不好，那猴子来显魂哩。”</p>

<p>行者到跟前，一把挝住八戒脸，一个巴掌打了个踉跄，道：“夯货！我显甚么魂？”呆子侮着脸道：“哥哥，你实是那怪吃了，你、你怎么又活了？”行者道：“象你这个不济事的脓包！他吃了我，我就抓他肠，捏他肺，又把这条绳儿穿住地的心，扯他疼痛难禁，一个个叩头哀告，我才饶了他性命。如今抬轿来送我师父过山也。”那三藏闻言，一骨鲁爬起来，对行者躬身道：“徒弟啊，累杀你了！若信悟能之言，我已绝矣！”行者轮拳打着八戒骂道：“这个馕糠的呆子，十分懈怠，甚不成人！师父，你切莫恼，那怪就来送你也。”沙僧也甚生惭愧，连忙遮掩，收拾行李，扣背马匹，都在途中等候不题。</p>

<p>却说三个魔头帅群精回洞，二怪道：“哥哥，我只道是个九头八尾的孙行者，原来是恁的个小小猴儿！你不该吞他，只与他斗时，他那里斗得过你我！洞里这几万妖精，吐唾沫也可湅{杀他。你却将他吞在肚里，他便弄起法来，教你受苦，怎么敢与他比较？才自说送唐僧，都是假意，实为兄长性命要紧，所以哄他出来。决不送他！”老魔道：“贤弟不送之故，何也？”二怪道：</p>

<p>“你与我三千小妖，摆开阵势，我有本事拿住这个猴头！”老魔道：“莫说三千，凭你起老营去，只是拿住他便大家有功。”那二魔即点三千小妖，径到大路旁摆开，着一个蓝旗手往来传报，教：“孙行者！赶早出来，与我二大王爷爷交战！”八戒听见笑道：“哥啊，常言道，说谎不瞒当乡人，就来弄虚头捣鬼！怎么说降了妖精，就抬轿来送师父，却又来叫战，何也？”行者道：“老怪已被我降了，不敢出头，闻着个孙字儿，也害头疼。这定是二妖魔不伏气送我们，故此叫战。我道兄弟，这妖精有弟兄三个，这般义气；我弟兄也是三个，就没些义气？我已降了大魔，二魔出来，你就与他战战，未为不可。”八戒道：“怕他怎的！等我去打他一仗来！”行者道：“要去便去罢。”八戒笑道：“哥啊，去便去，你把那绳儿借与我使使。”行者道：“你要怎的？你又没本事钻在肚里，你又没本事拴在他心上，要他何用？”八戒道：“我要扣在这腰间，做个救命索。你与沙僧扯住后手，放我出去，与他交战。估着赢了他，你便放松，我把他拿住；若是输与他，你把我扯回来，莫教他拉了去。”真个行者暗笑道：“也是捉弄呆子一番！”就把绳儿扣在他腰里，撮弄他出战。</p>

<p>那呆子举钉钯跑上山崖，叫道：“妖精出来！与你猪祖宗打来！”那蓝旗手急报道：“大王，有一个长嘴大耳朵的和尚来了。”二怪即出营，见了八戒，更不打话，挺枪劈面刺来。这呆子举钯上前迎住。他两个在山坡前搭上手，斗不上七八回合，呆子手软，架不得妖魔，急回头叫：“师兄，不好了！扯扯救命索，扯扯救命索！”这壁厢大圣闻言，转把绳子放松了抛将去。那呆子败了阵，住后就跪。原来那绳子拖着走还不觉，转回来，因松了，倒有些绊脚，自家绊倒了一跌，爬起来又一跌。始初还跌个躘踵，后面就跌了个嘴抢地。被妖精赶上，捽开鼻子，就如蛟龙一般，把八戒一鼻子卷住，得胜回洞。众妖凯歌齐唱，一拥而归。</p>

<p>这坡下三藏看见，又恼行者道：“悟空，怪不得悟能咒你死哩！原来你兄弟全无相亲相爱之意，专怀相嫉相妒之心！他那般说，教你扯扯救命索，你怎么不扯，还将索子丢去？如今教他被害，却如之何？”行者笑道：“师父也忒护短，忒偏心！罢了，象老孙拿去时，你略不挂念，左右是舍命之材；这呆子才自遭擒，你就怪我。也教他受些苦恼，方见取经之难。”三藏道：“徒弟啊，你去，我岂不挂念？想着你会变化，断然不至伤身。那呆子生得狼犺，又不会腾那，这一去，少吉多凶，你还去救他一救。”</p>

<p>行者道：“师父不得报怨，等我去救他一救。”急纵身赶上山，暗中恨道：“这呆子咒我死，且莫与他个快活！且跟去看那妖精怎么摆布他，等他受些罪，再去救他。”即捻诀念起真言，摇身一变，即变做个蟭蟟虫，飞将去，钉在八戒耳朵根上，同那妖精到了洞里。二魔帅三千小怪，大吹大打的，至洞口屯下，自将八戒拿入里边道：“哥哥，我拿了一个来也。”老怪道：“拿来我看。”</p>

<p>他把鼻子放松，捽下八戒道：“这不是？”老怪道：“这厮没用。”</p>

<p>八戒闻言道：“大王，没用的放出去，寻那有用的捉来罢。”三怪道：“虽是没用，也是唐僧的徒弟猪八戒。且捆了，送在后边池塘里浸着，待浸退了毛，破开肚子，使盐腌了晒干，等天阴下酒。”八戒大惊道：“罢了罢了！撞见那贩腌的妖怪也！”众怪一齐下手，把呆子四马攒蹄捆住，扛扛抬抬，送至池塘边，往中间一推，尽皆转去。</p>

<p>大圣却飞起来看处，那呆子四肢朝上，掘着嘴，半浮半沉，嘴里呼呼的，着然好笑，倒象八九月经霜落了子儿的一个大黑莲蓬。大圣见他那嘴脸，又恨他，又怜他，说道：“怎的好么？他也是龙华会上的一个人，但只恨他动不动分行李散火，又要撺掇师父念《紧箍咒》咒我。我前日曾闻得沙僧说，也攒了些私房，不知可有否，等我且吓他一吓看。”好大圣，飞近他耳边，假捏声音叫声：“猪悟能！猪悟能！”八戒慌了道：“晦气呀！我这悟能是观世音菩萨起的，自跟了唐僧，又呼做八戒，此间怎么有人知道我叫做悟能？”呆子忍不住问道：“是那个叫我的法名？”行者道：“是我。”呆子道：“你是那个？”行者道：“我是勾司人。”那呆子慌了道：“长官，你是那里来的？”行者道：“我是五阎王差来勾你的。”那呆子道：“长官，你且回去，上复五阎王，他与我师兄孙悟空交得甚好，教他让我一日儿，明日来勾罢。”</p>

<p>行者道：“胡说！阎王注定三更死，谁敢留人到四更！趁早跟我去，免得套上绳子扯拉！”呆子道：”长官，那里不是方便，看我这般嘴脸，还想活哩。死是一定死，只等一日，这妖精连我师父们都拿来，会一会，就都了帐也。”行者暗笑道：“也罢，我这批上有三十个人，都在这中前后，等我拘将来就你，便有一日耽阁。你可有盘缠，把些儿我去。”八戒道：“可怜啊！出家人那里有甚么盘缠？”行者道：“若无盘缠索了去！跟着我走！”呆子慌了道：“长官不要索，我晓得你这绳儿叫做追命绳，索上就要断气。有有有！有便有些儿，只是不多。”行者道：“在那里？快拿出来！”八戒道：“可怜，可怜！我自做了和尚，到如今，有些善信的人家斋僧，见我食肠大，衬钱比他们略多些儿，我拿了攒在这里，零零碎碎有五钱银子，因不好收拾，前者到城中，央了个银匠煎在一处，他又没天理，偷了我几分，只得四钱六分一块儿，你拿了去罢。”行者暗笑道：“这呆子裤子也没得穿，却藏在何处？咄！你银子在那里？”八戒道：“在我左耳朵眼儿里揌着哩。我捆了拿不得，你自家拿了去罢。”行者闻言，即伸手在耳朵窍中摸出，真个是块马鞍儿银子，足有四钱五六分重，拿在手里，忍不住哈哈的大笑一声。那呆子认是行者声音，在水里乱骂道：“天杀的弼马温！到这们苦处还来打诈财物哩！”行者又笑道：“我把你这馕糟的！老孙保师父，不知受了多少苦难，你到攒下私房！”八戒道：“嘴脸！这是甚么私房！都是牙齿上刮下来的，我不舍得买了嘴吃，留了买匹布儿做件衣服，你却吓了我的。还分些儿与我。”行者道：“半分也没得与你！”八戒骂道：“买命钱让与你罢，好道也救我出去是。”行者道：“莫发急，等我救你。”将银子藏了，即现原身，掣铁棒把呆子划拢，用手提着脚，扯上来，解了绳。八戒跳起来，脱下衣裳，整干了水，抖一抖，潮漉漉的披在身上，道：“哥哥，开后门走了罢。”行者道：“后门里走，可是个长进的？还打前门上去。”八戒道：“我的脚捆麻了，跑不动。”行者道：“快跟我来。”</p>

<p>好大圣，把铁棒一路丢开解数，打将出去。那呆子忍着麻，只得跟定他，只看见二门下靠着的是他的钉钯，走上前，推开小妖，捞过来往前乱筑，与行者打出三四层门，不知打杀了多少小妖。那老魔听见，对二魔道：“拿得好人！拿得好人！你看孙行者劫了猪八戒，门上打伤小妖也！”那二魔急纵身，绰枪在手，赶出门来，应声骂道：“泼猢狲！这般无礼！怎敢渺视我等！”</p>

<p>大圣听得，即应声站下。那怪物不容讲，使枪便刺。行者正是会家不忙，掣铁棒，劈面相迎。他两个在洞门外，这一场好杀：</p>

<p>黄牙老象变人形，义结狮王为弟兄。因为大魔来说合，同心计算吃唐僧。齐天大圣神通广，辅正除邪要灭精。八戒无能遭毒手，悟空拯救出门行。妖王赶上施英猛，枪棒交加各显能。那一个枪来好似穿林蟒，这一个棒起犹如出海龙。龙出海门云霭霭，蟒穿林树雾腾腾。算来都为唐和尚，恨苦相持太没情。那八戒见大圣与妖精交战，他在山嘴上竖着钉钯，不来帮打，只管呆呆的看着。那妖精见行者棒重，满身解数，全无破绽，就把枪架住，捽开鼻子，要来卷他。行者知道他的勾当，双手把金箍棒横起来，往上一举，被妖精一鼻子卷住腰胯，不曾卷手。你看他两只手在妖精鼻头上丢花棒儿耍子。八戒见了，捶胸道：</p>

<p>“咦！那妖怪晦气呀！卷我这夯的，连手都卷住了，不能得动，卷那们滑的，倒不卷手。他那两只手拿着棒，只消往鼻里一搠，那孔子里害疼流涕，怎能卷得他住？”行者原无此意，倒是八戒教了他。他就把棒幌一幌，小如鸡子，长有丈余，真个往他鼻孔里一搠。那妖精害怕，沙的一声，把鼻子捽放，被行者转手过来，一把挝住，用气力往前一拉，那妖精护疼，随着手举步跟来。八戒方才敢近，拿钉钯望妖精胯子上乱筑。行者道：“不好！</p>

<p>不好！那钯齿儿尖，恐筑破皮，淌出血来，师父看见又说我们伤生，只调柄子来打罢。”真个呆子举钯柄，走一步，打一下，行者牵着鼻子，就似两个象奴，牵至坡下，只见三藏凝睛盼望，见他两个嚷嚷闹闹而来，即唤：“悟净，你看悟空牵的是甚么？”沙僧见了笑道：“师父，大师兄把妖精揪着鼻子拉来，真爱杀人也！”</p>

<p>三藏道：“善哉！善哉！那般大个妖精！那般长个鼻子！你且问他：他若喜喜欢欢送我等过山呵，饶了他，莫伤他性命。”沙僧急纵前迎着，高声叫道：“师父说：那怪果送师父过山，教不要伤他命哩。”那怪闻说，连忙跪下，口里呜呜的答应，原来被行者揪着鼻子，捏儾了，就如重伤风一般，叫道：“唐老爷，若肯饶命，即便抬轿相送。”行者道：“我师徒俱是善胜之人，依你言，且饶你命，快抬轿来。如再变卦，拿住决不再饶！”那怪得脱手，磕头而去。行者同八戒见唐僧，备言前事。八戒惭愧不胜，在坡前晾晒衣服，等候不题。</p>

<p>那二魔战战兢兢回洞，未到时，已有小妖报知老魔三魔，说二魔被行者揪着鼻子拉去。老魔悚惧，与三魔帅众方出，见二魔独回，又皆接入，问及放回之故。二魔把三藏慈悯善胜之言，对众说了一遍，一个个面面相觑，更不敢言。二魔道：“哥哥可送唐僧么？”老魔道：“兄弟，你说那里话，孙行者是个广施仁义的猴头，他先在我肚里，若肯害我性命，一千个也被他弄杀了。却才揪住你鼻子，若是扯了去不放回，只捏破你的鼻子头儿，却也惶恐。快早安排送他去罢。”三魔笑道：“送！送！送！”</p>

<p>老魔道：“贤弟这话，却又象尚气的了。你不送，我两个送去罢。”三魔又笑道：“二位兄长在上，那和尚倘不要我们送，只这等瞒过去，还是他的造化；若要送，不知正中了我的调虎离山之计哩。”老怪道：“何为调虎离山？”三怪道：“如今把满洞群妖点将起来，万中选千，千中选百，百中选十六个，又选三十个。”</p>

<p>老怪道：“怎么既要十六，又要三十？”三怪道：“要三十个会烹煮的，与他些精米、细面、竹笋、茶芽、香蕈、蘑菇、豆腐、面筋，着他二十里，或三十里，搭下窝铺，安排茶饭，管待唐僧。”老怪道：“又要十六个何用？”三怪道：“着八个抬，八个喝路。我弟兄相随左右，送他一程。此去向西四百余里，就是我的城池，我那里自有接应的人马，若至城边，如此如此，着他师徒首尾不能相顾。要捉唐僧，全在此十六个鬼成功。”老怪闻言，欢欣不已，真是如醉方醒，似梦方觉，道：“好！好！好！”即点众妖，先选三十，与他物件；又选十六，抬一顶香藤轿子，同出门来，又吩咐众妖：“俱不许上山闲走！孙行者是个多心的猴子，若见汝等往来，他必生疑，识破此计。”</p>

<p>老怪遂帅众至大路旁高叫道：“唐老爷，今日不犯红沙，请老爷早早过山。”三藏闻言道：“悟空，是甚人叫我？”行者指定道：“那厢是老孙降伏的妖精抬轿来送你哩。”三藏合掌朝天道：“善哉！善哉！若不是贤徒如此之能，我怎生得去？”径直向前，对众妖作礼道：“多承列位之爱，我弟子取经东回，向长安当传扬善果也。”众妖叩首道：“请老爷上轿。”那三藏肉眼凡胎，不知是计；孙大圣又是太乙金仙，忠正之性，只以为擒纵之功，降了妖怪，亦岂期他都有异谋？却也不曾详察，尽着师父之意，即命八戒将行囊捎在马上，与沙僧紧随，他使铁棒向前开路，顾盼吉凶。八个抬起轿子，八个一递一声喝道。三个妖扶着轿扛，师父喜喜欢欢的端坐轿上，上了高山，依大路而行。</p>

<p>此一去，岂知欢喜之间愁又至，经云泰极否还生，时运相逢真太岁，又值丧门吊客星。那伙妖魔，同心合意的，侍卫左右，早晚殷勤。行经三十里献斋，五十里又斋，未晚请歇，沿路齐齐整整。一日三餐，遂心满意；良宵一宿，好处安身。西进有四百里余程，忽见城池相近。大圣举铁棒，离轿仅有一里之遥，见城池把他吓了一跌，挣挫不起。你道他只这般大胆，如何见此着唬，原来望见那城中有许多恶气，乃是：攒攒簇簇妖魔怪，四门都是狼精灵。斑斓老虎为都管，白面雄彪作总兵。丫叉角鹿传文引，伶俐狐狸当道行。千尺大蟒围城走，万丈长蛇占路程。楼下苍狼呼令使，台前花豹作人声。摇旗擂鼓皆妖怪，巡更坐铺尽山精。狡兔开门弄买卖，野猪挑担干营生。先年原是天朝国，如今翻作虎狼城。那大圣正当悚惧，只听得耳后风响，急回头观看，原来是三魔双手举一柄画杆方天戟，往大圣头上打来。大圣急翻身爬起，使金箍棒劈面相迎。他两个各怀恼怒，气呼呼，更不打话；咬着牙，各要相争。又见那老魔头，传声号令，举钢刀便砍八戒。八戒慌得丢了马，轮着钯向前乱筑。那二魔缠长枪望沙僧刺来，沙僧使降妖杖支开架子敌住。三个魔头与三个和尚，一个敌一个，在那山头舍死忘生苦战。那十六个小妖却遵号令，各各效能：抢了白马行囊，把三藏一拥，抬着轿子径至城边，高叫道：“大王爷爷定计，已拿得唐僧来了！”那城上大小妖精，一个个跑下，将城门大开，吩咐各营卷旗息鼓，不许呐喊筛锣，说：“大王原有令在前，不许吓了唐僧。唐僧禁不得恐吓，一吓就肉酸不中吃了。”众精都欢天喜地邀三藏，控背躬身接主僧。把唐僧一轿子抬上金銮殿，请他坐在当中，一壁厢献茶献饭，左右旋绕。那长老昏昏沉沉，举眼无亲。毕竟不知性命何如，且听下回分解。</p>
