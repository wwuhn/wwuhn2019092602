<P>The Mind-Ape Is Defeated by Fire</P>
<P>The Mother of Wood Is Captured by a Demon</P>
</div>
<P>Good and evil are quickly forgotten,</P>
<P>Flowering and fading are of no concern.</P>
<P>When perception is half-revealed it may sink or swim;</P>
<P>Follow fate and take your food and drink when they come.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Divine peace is still and solitary;</P>
<P>Stupidity is open to devilish attack.</P>
<P>The Five Elements smash the woods of contemplation;</P>
<P>When the wind blows it is bound to be cold.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story tells how the Great Sage Monkey took his leave of Friar Sand and led Pig with him as he sprang across the Withered Pine Creek and headed straight for the demon's crag. There was indeed a cave in it, and it was no ordinary sight.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When returning along one's old route in mysterious silence,</P>
<P>The call of the crane is heard in the wind and moonlight.</P>
<P>White clouds bathe the river in brightness;</P>
<P>The waters under the bridge make one think of immortals.</P>
<P>Apes and birds cry out amid exotic plants;</P>
<P>Creepers cover the steps; magic mushrooms flourish.</P>
<P>Dark green floats among crags as mists disperse;</P>
<P>Turquoise touches the pines when a phoenix alights.</P>
<P>The distant line of peaks looks just like a screen;</P>
<P>In the folds of the mountain an immortal's cave is formed.</P>
<P>In this branch of the Kunlun Range are dragons born;</P>
<P>Only those fated to do so can enjoy this beauty.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As they approached the gate they saw a stone tablet on which was carved in big letters, FIRE-WIND CAVE, WITHERED PINE RAVINE, MOUNT HAO. To the other side a crowd of little demons were sparring with sword and spear, leaping through the air, and generally enjoying themselves. &#8220;Little ones,&#8221; shouted Monkey at the top of his voice, &#8220;tell your ruler at once that if he brings my master the Tang Priest out I'll spare all your lives, but that if so much as a hint of a 'no' comes out between his teeth I'll turn your mountain upside-down and trample your cave flat.&#8221; Hearing this, the little demons all scurried back into the cave, shut the doors, and went in to report, &#8220;Trouble, Your Majesty.&#8221;</P>
<P>The monster had carried Sanzang into the cave, stripped him, tied his hands and feet together, and sent little devils to fetch clean water to wash him with. He was going to put Sanzang into a steaming tray to cook, but when the alarm was raised he forgot about washing Sanzang, rushed into the main hall, and asked, &#8220;What trouble?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's a monk with a hairy face as ugly as a thunder-god. He's got another monk with a long snout and big ears. He's demanding their master, who's called the Tang Priest or something, and he says that if there's so much as a hint of a 'no' he'll turn the mountain upside-down and trample the cave flat.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They must be Sun the Novice and Pig,&#8221; said the demon king with a cruel laugh. &#8220;They were bound to come looking for their master. But I carried their master fifty miles from the middle of the mountains to here. How did they find their way here?&#8221; The monster then told his carters to push the carts out, and the little devils responsible did so, opening up the front gates.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig when he saw them, &#8220;I think they're so scared of us that they've brought their carts out and are going to move away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Look&#8212;they're leaving them there.&#8221; The little devils set the carts out in the order of the Five Elements&#8212;metal, wood, water, fire and earth&#8212;checked them over, and went back inside to report.</P>
<P>&#8220;Ready?&#8221; the demon king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Ready,&#8221; they replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Fetch my spear,&#8221; said the demon king, and two of the little devils from the armory carried in an eighteen-foot long fire-tipped spear that they handed to their king. The king tried out a few swings and thrusts with the spear. He wore no helmet or armor, just a battle-kilt of embroidered brocade around his waist, as he went out barefoot through the gates. When Monkey and Pig looked up at him they saw that the monster had:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A face as pale as if powdered,</P>
<P>Lips as red as from lipstick.</P>
<P>Hair in two tufts looking darker than indigo,</P>
<P>A clear-cut brow like a crescent moon.</P>
<P>His kilt was embroidered with phoenix and dragon,</P>
<P>He looked like Nezha, but a little plumper.</P>
<P>In his hands he wielded an awe-inspiring spear,</P>
<P>As he came out through the gates, protected by his aura.</P>
<P>When he roared it echoed like thunder,</P>
<P>And the glare of his eyes flashed like lightning.</P>
<P>If you would know this demon's true name,</P>
<P>He was the Red Boy of undying renown.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Red Boy came out shouting, &#8220;Who's making that row?&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey went closer, smiled and said, &#8220;Don't put on such an act, dear nephew. At the top of that pine tree this morning you were a skinny, jaundiced little baby, and you fooled my master. I carried you in all kindness, but you made a whirlwind and took my master off. Now you're putting on this big show, but I know who you are. Bring my master out at once if you don't want me to forget our kinship and turn nasty. I wouldn't like your respected father to think of me as a disgraceful bully.&#8221; These words threw the demon into, a fury.</P>
<P>&#8220;Vicious ape,&#8221; he roared, &#8220;you're no relation of mine. You're talking a load of nonsense. You've got no reason to claim that I'm your nephew.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You wouldn't know about it, lad,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;When your respected father and I were sworn brothers you hadn't even been thought of.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Rubbish, you baboon,&#8221; said the demon. &#8220;Think where you come from and where I come from. How could you ever have been my father's sworn brother?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You'd know nothing about it,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'm Sun Wukong, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven who made havoc in Heaven five hundred years ago. Before that I roamed all over the seas and the sky and visited all of the four continents. In those days I was a great admirer of true heroes. Your respected father, the Bull Demon King, had the tide of Great Sage Matching Heaven. He took me as his seventh brother, and I let him be the eldest brother. There were also the Salamander Demon King, the Great Sage Overturning the Sea, who was our second brother. The Roc Demon King was the Great Sage Throwing Heaven into Confusion and third brother. Fourth brother was the Camel King, the Great Sage Who Moves Mountains. The Macaque King, our fifth brother, was the Great Sage Who Travels with the Wind; and the sixth brother was the Lion King&#8212;his title was Great Sage Who Drives the Gods Away. As I was the smallest I was the seventh brother, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven. When we brothers were having a fine old time back in those days you hadn't even been born.&#8221;</P>
<P>The demon, refusing to believe a word of this, raised his fire-tipped spear to thrust at Monkey. With the unhurried ease of a true expert Monkey avoided the spear-thrust, swung his iron cudgel, and insulted him: &#8220;You don't know when you're out-classed, you little demon. Take this!&#8221;</P>
<P>The evil spirit also moved out of the way and said, &#8220;Times have changed and you've been left behind, vicious ape. Take this!&#8221; There was no more talk of their kinship as the pair of them showed their magic powers in great anger. They leapt into mid-air, and it was a fine duel:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey was very famous,</P>
<P>The demon king was powerful.</P>
<P>One held a gold-banded cudgel before him,</P>
<P>The other thrust with a fire-tipped spear.</P>
<P>The fogs they breathed out darkened the three worlds;</P>
<P>They snorted out clouds that covered the four quarters.</P>
<P>It was a day of terror and of murderous shouts,</P>
<P>When sun, moon and stars could not be seen.</P>
<P>In speech neither yielded an inch;</P>
<P>Both were unreasonable by nature.</P>
<P>One was a discourteous bully,</P>
<P>The other forgot the obligations of kinship.</P>
<P>The parrying cudgel made one mightier;</P>
<P>The thrusting spear showed the other's savagery.</P>
<P>One was a true Great Sage from Primal Chaos,</P>
<P>The other was the page Sudhana.</P>
<P>The pair of them strove for supremacy,</P>
<P>All because the Tang Priest would worship the Buddha.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>While the evil spirit fought twenty rounds with Monkey without result Pig could see clearly from the sidelines that although the demon had not been defeated he was only holding Monkey at bay and had no hope of making an attack on him. And although Monkey had not yet beaten the demon, he was wielding his cudgel with such consummate skill that he kept striking at the demon's head without ever missing his aim.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is no good,&#8221; thought Pig. &#8220;Monkey's a slippery customer, and if he shows the monster an opening and gets the demon to charge, Monkey'll finish him off with one blow of his cudgel and there'll be no glory for me.&#8221; Watch Pig as he summons up his spirit, raises the nine-pronged rake, and brings it down from mid-air towards the demon's head. This gave the demon so bad a fright that he fled in defeat.</P>
<P>&#8220;After him,&#8221; shouted Monkey, &#8220;after him.&#8221;</P>
<P>The pair of them chased him to the mouth of the cave, where the demon stood on the middle one of the five little carts, brandishing his fire-tipped spear with one hand, and clenching the other into a fist with which he punched himself twice on the nose. &#8220;Shameless thing,&#8221; laughed Pig, &#8220;punching yourself on the nose to make it bleed, then wiping the blood all over your face. Are you going to bring a lawsuit against us?&#8221;</P>
<P>But when the demon hit his nose twice he also said a spell and breathed out fire, while he snorted thick clouds of smoke from his nose. In the wink of an eye flames were everywhere. Fire poured from the five carts. After the demon had blown a few more times a great fire was leaping up to the sky, blotting out the Fire-cloud Cave. Heaven and earth were both engulfed in the blaze. &#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig in horror, &#8220;this is terrible. Once in that fire that would be the end of you. I'd be baked, and he'd only need to add a few spices to make a meal of me. Let's get out of here.&#8221; At that he fled back across the ravine, ignoring Monkey.</P>
<P>Monkey's magical powers really were very great. Making a fire avoidance spell with his fingers he plunged into the flames in pursuit of the demon. Seeing Monkey coming after him the demon breathed out yet more fire, which was even worse than ever. That fire</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Fiercely blazing filled the sky,</P>
<P>Covered the earth with a terrible red,</P>
<P>Flew up and down like a fire-wheel,</P>
<P>Danced East and West like sparks.</P>
<P>This was not the fire of the Firemaker rubbing wood,</P>
<P>Or of Lao Zi heating his elixir furnace,</P>
<P>Not a heavenly fire,</P>
<P>Or a prairie fire,</P>
<P>But the True Samadhi Fire the demon had refined.</P>
<P>The five carts combined the Five Elements,</P>
<P>And the fire was formed from their transformations.</P>
<P>The wood of the liver can make the heart fire blaze;</P>
<P>The fire of the heart can settle the spleen's earth.</P>
<P>Spleen's earth gives rise to metal, which turns to water,</P>
<P>And water gives birth to wood, completing the magic cycle.</P>
<P>To fire are due all births and transformations;</P>
<P>It makes all things to flourish throughout space.</P>
<P>The evil spirit had long learned to breathe Samadhi Fire;</P>
<P>He was for ever the first lord of the West.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey could not find the monster amid the raging flames, or even see the way to the mouth of the cave, so he sprang back out of the fire. The demon, who could see all this clearly from the entrance to the cave, put his fire-making equipment away when he knew Monkey had gone, led his devilish horde back inside the cave, and shut the stone doors. He felt he had won a victory, so he told his underlings to lay on a banquet. There was music and much rejoicing, of which we will not speak.</P>
<P>Instead we return to Monkey, who had leapt back across the Withered Pine Ravine and brought his cloud down to land where he could hear Pig and Friar Sand talking loudly and clearly among the pines.</P>
<P>He went up to them and shouted at Pig, &#8220;You're no man, you cretin. You were so scared of the demon's fire that you ditched me and fled for your life. But I've long had a trick or two up my sleeve.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; laughed Pig, &#8220;that monster was quite right when he said that you're not up to it any more. As the old saying goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Only the man who can meet today's need</P>
<P>May be acclaimed as a hero Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>That demon was no relation of yours, but you tried to force him to take you for one; and when it came to a fight he set off all that terrible fire. Instead of running away are you going to get stuck into another fight with him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How do the monster's fighting powers compare with mine?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;He's no match for you,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;What's he like with his spear?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No good either,&#8221; replied Pig. &#8220;When I saw that he was barely holding out I took a swipe at him to help you. He wouldn't play and ran away. Then he cheated and set that fire going.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You shouldn't have come,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;It would be best if I had a few more rounds with him and caught him a crafty one with my cudgel!&#8221; The two of them then fell to discussing the demon's skill and his terrible fire while Friar Sand leaned against a pine trunk, grinning broadly.</P>
<P>&#8220;What are you grinning at, brother,&#8221; asked Monkey when he noticed. &#8220;Don't tell me you've got some power with which to capture the demon and defeat his magic fire. If you had, you'd be helping all of us. As the saying goes, 'many hands make light work.' If you can capture the demon and rescue the master you'll have something very fine to your credit.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've got no magic powers,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;and I can't subdue demons. I was just smiling at the way you two were getting so desperate.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The demon's no match for either you in magic or at fighting,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;The only reason you can't beat him is because of his fire. If you took my advice you could catch him easily by using the principle of the elements overcoming each other.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this Monkey chuckled aloud and said, &#8220;You're right. We were so desperate we forgot about that. On the principle of the elements overcoming each other we'll have to beat fire with water. The question is, where do we get the water to put that fire out and rescue the master?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;and we mustn't waste any time.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You two stay here,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;but don't get into a fight with him. I'll go and borrow some dragon soldiers from the Eastern Ocean to bring water to douse the devil fire.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Off you go, brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;and don't worry. We know what to do.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage took his cloud far away. In a moment he was at the Eastern Ocean, but he had no interest in admiring the seascape as he parted the waves with water-repelling magic. As he was going through the water he met a patrolling yaksha, who hurried back into the water-crystal palace to report to the Senior Dragon King Ao Guang. Ao Guang came out to welcome Monkey at the head of his dragon sons and grandsons and his shrimp and crab soldiers. The dragon king invited Monkey to come in and sit down. When the courtesies were over the king offered Monkey some tea.</P>
<P>&#8220;Please don't bother,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;But there is something else I've come to trouble you with. My master the Tang Priest has been captured on his way to the Western Heaven to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures. He's been caught by an evil spirit called the Red Boy, the Boy Sage King, from the Fire-cloud Cave by Withered Pine Ravine on Mount Hao. I went into the cave to look for my master and fight the demon, but the demon started a great fire. It was too much for me. I thought that as water overcomes fire I'd come here to ask you for some water. Could you make a torrential downpour for me that would put the fire out and save the Tang Priest?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've come to the wrong place,&#8221; said the dragon king. &#8220;I'm not the person to ask for rain.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But you're the dragon king of the four oceans,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;the lord of rain. If I don't ask you who else should I ask?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am in charge of rain,&#8221; replied the dragon king, &#8220;but I can't do anything without authorization. I must have permission from the Jade Emperor as to where and when and how many inches of rain I should pour down, and I've to get a lot of official signatures before I can ask the help of Grandpa Thunder, Mother Lightning, Uncle Wind and the Cloud Boys. As the saying goes, dragons can't travel without cloud.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But I don't need wind, clouds, thunder or lightning,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;All I want is some rain to put the fire out.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You may not need wind, clouds, thunder or lightning, Great Sage,&#8221; said the dragon king, &#8220;but I can't help you alone. What would you say if I asked my younger brothers too?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are they?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;Ao Qin is Dragon King of the Southern Sea, Ao Run is Dragon King of the Northern Sea, and Ao Shun is Dragon King of the Western Sea.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It'd be easier to go up to Heaven and ask the Jade Emperor for an edict than to trek round all three seas,&#8221; replied Monkey with a laugh. &#8220;No need for you to go, Great Sage,&#8221; said the dragon king. &#8220;If I beat my iron drum and bronze bell they'll be here this instant.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please sound them at once, Senior Dragon King,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>A moment later the three other dragon kings came crowding in. &#8220;Elder brother,&#8221; they asked, &#8220;what orders do you have for us?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The Great Sage Monkey is here to borrow some rain to help him subdue a demon,&#8221; said the Senior Dragon King. After the greetings were over Monkey explained why he needed water. The dragons were all delighted to comply. They mustered the following:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The brave Shark as the vanguard,</P>
<P>With big-mouthed Hemibagrus to the fore;</P>
<P>Marshal Carp who plunges through the waves,</P>
<P>Commander Bream who spews out mists.</P>
<P>Colonel Mackerel to patrol the East,</P>
<P>Major Culler to advance to the West.</P>
<P>The Cavalryman Red Eye gallops to the South,</P>
<P>While General Black-shell breaks through in the North.</P>
<P>Brigadier Croaker commands the central force;</P>
<P>Every unit is a crack force of heroes.</P>
<P>A master of strategy is Chief of Staff Turtle;</P>
<P>Lord Tortoise excels in subtle predictions.</P>
<P>Prime Minister Alligator is full of wisdom,</P>
<P>Garrison Commander Terrapin has great ability.</P>
<P>Advancing sideways, crab soldiers wield their swords,</P>
<P>While leaping shrimp amazons draw their bows.</P>
<P>Secretary Catfish looks after the paperwork,</P>
<P>And calls the rolls of the dragon army.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>There is a poem about this that goes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The four ocean dragons were glad to give their help</P>
<P>When Monkey the Sage to seek assistance came.</P>
<P>As the priest Sanzang was in trouble on his journey</P>
<P>They all carried water to put out the flame.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey was soon back at the Withered Pine Ravine on Mount Hao with his dragon army. &#8220;Worthy brothers of the Ao clan,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I have brought you a long way. This is where the demon lives. Will you please stay up here in mid-air and not show your faces while I have it out with him. If I can beat him, I won't need to trouble you gentlemen to capture him for me. If he beats me, there'll be no need for you gentlemen to join in the fray. The only thing I'd like you to do is all to spurt out rain together when I call if he starts his fire.&#8221; The dragon kings did as they had been told.</P>
<P>Monkey then brought his cloud down to land in the pine wood, saw Pig and Friar Sand, and called to them. &#8220;You were quick,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;Did you get the dragon king to come?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They're all here,&#8221; Brother Monkey replied. &#8220;You'd both better be very careful not to let the baggage get wet if it rains hard. I'm off to fight the demon.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Off you go, and don't worry,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;We can cope.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey leapt across the ravine to the cave entrance and shouted, &#8220;Open up!&#8221; The little devils ran back in to report, &#8220;Sun the Novice is here again.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Red Boy looked up with a smile and said, &#8220;The monkey thinks no fire can burn him, because none ever has. That's why he's here again. But this time we won't let him off: we'll burn him to cinders.&#8221; He sprang up, grasped his spear, and ordered the little demons to wheel the fire carts out. Then he went out in front of the gates and asked Monkey, &#8220;Why are you here again?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Give me back my master,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Keep up with the times, ape,&#8221; said the demon. &#8220;He may be a master to you, but to me he's something to eat with my drinks. You might as well forget about him.&#8221; These words threw Monkey into a fury. He raised his gold-banded cudgel and struck at the monster's head. The demon quickly parried the blow with his fire-tipped spear. This fight was not like the one before:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A furious evil demon,</P>
<P>An enraged Monkey King.</P>
<P>One set on saving the pilgrim priest,</P>
<P>Whom the other intended to devour.</P>
<P>When the heart changes kinship disappears;</P>
<P>No concessions are made in the absence of feeling.</P>
<P>One would gladly have skinned his foe alive;</P>
<P>The other wanted his enemy pickled in sauce.</P>
<P>Such heroism,</P>
<P>What ferocity!</P>
<P>Spear parried cudgel in the struggle for mastery;</P>
<P>Cudgel blocked spear in the battle to win.</P>
<P>After twenty rounds of combat</P>
<P>Both sides were on equal terms.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the demon king had fought twenty rounds with Monkey and could see that neither of them was going to win he feinted, pulled back, clenched his fist, punched himself twice on the nose, and started breathing out fire again. Flames roared from the carts in front of the entrance, and his mouth and eyes were full of the blaze. Monkey looked back to shout, &#8220;Where are you, dragon kings?&#8221; The dragon king brothers then led their watery hosts in spurting rain on the demon's fire. It was a splendid rainstorm,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Mighty,</P>
<P>Heavy.</P>
<P>Mighty as stars falling from the heavens,</P>
<P>Heavy like waves crashing on the shore.</P>
<P>At first the drops are the size of fists,</P>
<P>Then each is a bowl of water upturned.</P>
<P>Flowing across the land, making duck's necks green;</P>
<P>Washing the mountainside to show it deep blue.</P>
<P>The waters in the ravine are a thousand fathoms of jade,</P>
<P>The spring stream swells to a myriad strands of silver.</P>
<P>Soon the crossroads is flooded,</P>
<P>And the meandering river flows straight.</P>
<P>The dragons help the Tang Priest in his trouble,</P>
<P>Making the Heavenly River overflow.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>But heavy though it was, the downpour could not stop the demon's fire. Dragon king's private rain can only put out ordinary fires, not this demon's Samadhi Fire. The rain was like oil poured on the flames: the more there was, the fiercer the blaze. &#8220;I'll make a hand-spell and plunge into the fire,&#8221; said Monkey, who went after the demon, swinging his cudgel. Seeing Monkey coming, the demon blew a cloud of smoke straight into his face. Turn away though he did, Monkey's eyes smarted terribly, and he could not stop the tears from pouring down. Although not bothered by fire, the Great Sage was vulnerable to smoke. Back at the time when he had made havoc in Heaven and been refined by Lord Lao Zi in the Eight Trigram Furnace he had saved himself from being burnt up by staying in the part of the furnace controlled by the Wind Trigram Xun. But the wind had blown smoke at him, and he had been so thoroughly cooked that his eyes turned fiery and his pupils golden. That was why he was still vulnerable to smoke. When the demon blew another cloud of smoke at him it was more than he could bear, and so he made off on his cloud. The demon king then had the fire-raising equipment put away and went back into the cave.</P>
<P>The flames and the smoke had made the Great Sage unbearably hot, so he plunged straight into the stream to put out the flames, not realizing that the shock of the cold water would make the fire attack his heart, driving his three souls out of him. Alas,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When breathing stopped, cold went his mouth and tongue;</P>
<P>All his souls scattered and his life was done.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In their horror the dragon kings of the four seas who were watching from mid-air stopped making rain and shouted, &#8220;Marshal Tian Peng, Curtain-raising General, stop hiding in the woods. Go and find your brother.&#8221;</P>
<P>Hearing their divine shouts Pig and Friar Sand immediately untied the horse, put the luggage-pole on their shoulders, and rushed out of the wood. They searched for Monkey along the stream, not caring about getting wet and muddy. Upstream they could see someone being carried by the rushing torrent and tossed around in the waves. The moment Friar Sand spotted this he leapt fully clothed into the water and hauled him to the bank. It was the body of the Great Sage. Alas! He was curled up, unable to stretch any of his limbs and as cold as ice all over. &#8220;Poor brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;You who were once going to be immortal are now had your life cut short as a traveler.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop crying, brother,&#8221; laughed Pig. &#8220;The ape's just shamming dead to give us a fright. Feel his chest and see if it's still warm.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He's cold all over,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;with only a touch of warmth. How are we going to revive him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He knows how to do seventy-two transformations,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;and that means seventy-two lives. You grab his feet and I'll manipulate him. So Friar Sand pulled at Monkey's feet while Pig supported his head. They straightened him out, stood him up, then made him sit cross-legged. Pig warmed Monkey up by rubbing vigorously with the palms of his hands, covered his seven orifices, and gave him a dhyana massage. The shock of the cold water had blocked the breath in Monkey's abdomen, leaving him unable to speak. Thanks to Pig's massage and rubbing, the breath in Monkey's body soon flowed through the Three Passes again, circulated in his Bright Hall,<SUP></SUP> and came out through his orifices with a shout of &#8220;Master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;you live for the master, and his name is on your lips even when you're dying. Wake up. We're here.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey opened his eyes and asked, &#8220;Brothers, are you here? I've lost.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You passed out just now,&#8221; said Pig with a laugh, &#8220;and if I hadn't saved you you'd have been done for. You owe me some thanks.&#8221;</P>
<P>Only then did Monkey get to his feet, look up and say, &#8220;Where are you, Ao brothers?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We humble dragons are in attendance up here,&#8221; the dragon kings of the four oceans replied from mid-air.</P>
<P>&#8220;I've given you the trouble of this long journey for nothing,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Would you like to go back now? I'll come to thank you another day.&#8221; We will say no more about the dragon kings as they led their watery tribes home in majesty.</P>
<P>Friar Sand helped Monkey back into the woods, where they both sat down. Before long Monkey had recovered and was breathing normally as the tears poured down his cheeks. &#8220;Master,&#8221; he cried,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;I remember when you left Great Tang,</P>
<P>And saved me from my torture in the cliff.</P>
<P>Demons have plagued you at each mount and stream;</P>
<P>Your heart was torn by countless pains and woes.</P>
<P>Sometimes you have eaten well and sometimes not;</P>
<P>You've spent your nights in forests or in farms.</P>
<P>Your heart was always set on the Achievement;</P>
<P>Who knows what agonies you suffer now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't upset yourself so, brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;We'll work out a plan to get reinforcements and rescue the master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where from?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Long ago, when the Bodhisattva ordered us to protect the Tang Priest, she promised us that if we called on Heaven or earth for help there would always be a response,&#8221; replied Friar Sand. &#8220;Where shall we turn now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I remember that when I made havoc in Heaven,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;the Heavenly soldiers were no match for me. That evil spirit has tremendous magic. Only someone with more powers than I have will be able to subdue him. As the gods of Heaven and earth are useless the only way to catch the monster will be by going to ask the Bodhisattva Guanyin for her help. But I can't ride my somersault cloud: my skin is much too sore and my body is aching. How are we going to get her help?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Tell me what to say,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;and I'll go to ask her.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Monkey with a laugh, &#8220;you go. If the Bodhisattva receives you, you mustn't look her in the face. Keep your head down and bow to her respectfully. When she asks you, tell her what this place and the demon are called, then ask her to save the master. If she agrees to come she'll certainly capture the demon.&#8221; Pig set off South on his cloud.</P>
<P>Back in the cave the demon was saying with delight, &#8220;Sun the Novice is beaten, my little ones. I may not have killed him this time, but at any rate he passed out for a long time.&#8221; He sighed, then added, &#8220;The only thing is that he might send for reinforcements. Open up, and I'll go out to see who he's sending for.&#8221;</P>
<P>The demons opened the gates for the evil spirit to spring out and look around from mid-air. Seeing Pig heading South the spirit reckoned that he must definitely be going to ask the Bodhisattva Guanyin to come as there was nowhere else to the South where he might be going. The demon brought his cloud down quickly and said to his followers, &#8220;Little ones, fetch my leather bag. The string at the mouth may not be any good now as I haven't used it for ages, so please put a new string in it and leave it outside the inner gates. I'll lure Pig back here and pop him in the bag. Then we can steam him nice and tender as a reward for all of you.&#8221; The little demons fetched their king's As-You-Will leather bag, replaced the string in it, and put it inside the main gates.</P>
<P>As the demon king had lived there so long he was very familiar with the district, and knew which ways to the Southern Sea were quicker and which were longer. Riding his cloud by the quick route he overtook Pig and turned himself into an imitation Guanyin to sit on a crag and wait for him.</P>
<P>When the idiot suddenly saw Guanyin as he was hurtling along on his cloud he had no way of telling that this was a false one: it was a case of seeing the image and taking it for a Buddha. The idiot stopped his cloud, bowed down, and said, &#8220;Bodhisattva, your disciple Zhu Wuneng kowtows to you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why have you come to see me instead of escorting the Tang Priest to fetch the scriptures?&#8221; the Bodhisattva asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I was travelling with master,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;when an evil spirit called the Red Boy carried my master off to the Fire-cloud Cave by Withered Pine Ravine on Mount Hao. Monkey and us two went to find the demon and fight him. Because he can make fire we couldn't beat him the first time. The second time we asked the dragon kings to help out with rain, but even that couldn't put it out. The flames have hurt Monkey so badly that he can't move, which is why he's sent me to ask for your help, Bodhisattva. I beg you in your mercy to save the master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The lord of the Fire-cloud Cave is no killer,&#8221; said the evil spirit. &#8220;You must have offended him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I never offended him,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;It was my brother Monkey who did. The demon turned himself into a little boy hanging at the top of a tree to tempt my master. My master is so kind-hearted that he told me to untie the boy and made Monkey carry him. It was Monkey who smashed him to bits and made him carry the master off in a wind.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Get up,&#8221; said the evil spirit, &#8220;and come with me to the cave to see its lord. I shall ask him to be kind to you. You will just have to kowtow as an apology and ask for your master back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Bodhisattva,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;I'll kowtow to him if I can get the master back that way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Come with me,&#8221; said the demon king. Knowing no better, the idiot followed the demon back to the Fire-cloud Cave by the way he had come instead of going on to the Southern Sea. They were back at the entrance in an instant.</P>
<P>&#8220;Do not worry,&#8221; said the evil spirit as he went in, &#8220;he is an old acquaintance of mine. Come in.&#8221; As soon as the idiot raised his foot to go inside the demons all captured him with a great shout, knocked him over, and pushed him into the bag. Then the cord at the mouth was drawn tight and Pig was hung up from a rafter.</P>
<P>The evil spirit resumed his true form, took his seat in the midst of the demons, and said, &#8220;Pig, what powers do you think you have? How do you have the nerve to promise to protect the Tang Priest on his way to fetch the scriptures, or to ask the Bodhisattva here to subdue me? Take a good look. Can't you see I'm the Sage Boy King? Now I've got you I'm going to hang you up for four or five days, steam you, and give you as a treat to the little devils to nibble with their drinks.&#8221;</P>
<P>Hearing this, Pig started cursing inside the bag: &#8220;Damn you, monster. It's disgraceful behavior. You may have used all your tricks and devices to be able to eat me, but I guarantee I'll give every one of you the head-swelling plague.&#8221; The idiot kept on cursing and yelling, but we will say no more of him.</P>
<P>Monkey meanwhile had felt a stinking wind rush past him as he sat with Friar Sand. &#8220;That's bad,&#8221; he said with a sneeze. &#8220;That's a thoroughly ill wind. I'm afraid Pig's got lost.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But wouldn't he ask the way if he got lost?&#8221; asked Friar Sand.</P>
<P>&#8220;He must have run into the demon,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;But wouldn't he have come rushing back here if he'd met a demon?&#8221; said Friar Sand.</P>
<P>&#8220;Can't be sure,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;You sit here and look after the things while I go over the ravine and see what's going on.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Let me go,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;Your back is still aching and he might fight you again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You'd be useless,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;It'll have to be me.&#8221;</P>
<P>Splendid Monkey gritted his teeth against the pain, took his cudgel in his hand, crossed the ravine, and shouted &#8220;Vicious monster!&#8221; at the mouth of the cave. The little devil at the gate rushed inside to report that Sun the Novice was yelling at the gates again. The demon king ordered Monkey's capture. With a great battle-cry a crowd of demons armed with swords and spears opened the gates and shouted, &#8220;Get him.&#8221; Monkey was indeed too exhausted to fight them. He squeezed himself against the side of the path, shouted, &#8220;Change,&#8221; and turned himself into a bundle wrapped in a gold-embroidered cloth. As soon as they saw it the little devils picked it up and took it inside. &#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; they reported, &#8220;Monkey's a coward. As soon as we shouted 'Get him' he was so scared he dropped his bundle and ran.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There won't be anything in there that's worth anything,&#8221; smirked the demon king. &#8220;Probably just some worn-out monks' habits and old hats. Get them in, and wash and tear them up to use as rags.&#8221; One of the little demons took the bundle right inside the cave, not realizing it was really Monkey. &#8220;Splendid,&#8221; thought Monkey, &#8220;they're carrying the bundle in.&#8221; The evil spirit dropped it inside the doors without paying any attention to it.</P>
<P>Splendid Monkey could work transformations within transformations and deceits within deceits. Pulling out one of his hairs he blew on it with magic breath and made it look just like the first bundle. He then turned himself into a fly that perched on the pivot of the door. He could hear Pig grumbling away rather indistinctly, like a hog with swine-fever. When Monkey buzzed over to look for him he found Pig hanging up in the leather sack. Monkey landed on the sack, where he could hear Pig cursing and swearing at the demon.</P>
<P>&#8220;How dare you pretend to be the Bodhisattva Guanyin and trick me into coming here! Then you hang me up and say you're going to eat me. One day soon my elder brother</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Will use his superlative Great Sage powers</P>
<P>And have all you demons caught in a shake.</P>
<P>He'll open this bag and let me get out</P>
<P>To give you all thousands of thumps with my rake.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey was delighted to hear this. &#8220;The idiot may be a bit stuffy in there, but he's not running down his colours. I'll get that demon and have my revenge on him.&#8221;</P>
<P>Just as Monkey was working out how to rescue Pig he heard the demon king shouting, &#8220;Where are the six warriors?&#8221; Six of the little devils who were his friends had been given the title of Warrior. Each one had his own name. They were Mist in the Clouds, Clouds in the Mist, Fire-fast, Windspeedy, Heater and Cooker. The six warriors stepped forward and knelt down. &#8220;Do you know where the Old King lives?&#8221; the demon asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the warriors replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Go tonight to invite His Majesty the Old King here. Tell him that I've caught a Tang Priest who I'm going to cook for him, and that this will make him live for another thousand ages.&#8221; The six monsters slouched around as they went out with their orders. Monkey flew down from the bag with a buzz and followed the six demons as they left the cave.</P>
<P>If you don't know how the Old King was invited there, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>心猿遭火败</p>
<p>木母被魔擒</p>
</div>
<p>善恶一时忘念，荣枯都不关心。晦明隐现任浮沉，随分饥餐渴饮。神静湛然常寂，昏冥便有魔侵。五行蹭蹬破禅林，风动必然寒凛。却说那孙大圣引八戒别了沙僧，跳过枯松涧，径来到那怪石崖前，果见有一座洞府，真个也景致非凡。但见回銮古道幽还静，风月也听玄鹤弄。白云透出满川光，流水过桥仙意兴。猿啸鸟啼花木奇，藤萝石蹬芝兰胜。苍摇崖壑散烟霞，翠染松篁招彩凤。远列巅峰似插屏，山朝涧绕真仙洞。昆仑地脉发来龙，有分有缘方受用。将近行到门前，见有一座石碣，上镌八个大字，乃是“号山枯松涧火云洞”。那壁厢一群小妖，在那里轮枪舞剑的跳风顽耍。孙大圣厉声高叫道：“那小的们，趁早去报与洞主知道，教他送出我唐僧师父来，免你这一洞精灵的性命！牙迸半个不字，我就掀翻了你的山场，躧平了你的洞府！”那些小妖闻有此言，慌忙急转身，各归洞里，关了两扇石门，到里边来报：“大王，祸事了！”</p>

<p>却说那怪自把三藏拿到洞中，选剥了衣服，四马攒蹄，捆在后院里，着小妖打干净水刷洗，要上笼蒸吃哩，急听得报声祸事，且不刷洗，便来前庭上问：“有何祸事？”小妖道：“有个毛脸雷公嘴的和尚，带一个长嘴大耳的和尚，在门前要甚么唐僧师父哩。但若牙迸半个不字，就要掀翻山场，躧平洞府。”魔王微微冷笑道：“这是孙行者与猪八戒，他却也会寻哩。他拿他师父，自半山中到此，有百五十里，却怎么就寻上门来？”教：“小的们，把管车的，推出车去！”那一班几个小妖，推出五辆小车儿来，开了前门。八戒望见道：“哥哥，这妖精想是怕我们，推出车子，往那厢搬哩。”行者道：“不是，且看他放在那里。”只见那小妖将车子按金、木、水、火、土安下，着五个看着，五个进去通报。那魔王问：“停当了？”答应：“停当了。”教：“取过枪来。”有那一伙管兵器的小妖，着两个抬出一杆丈八长的火尖枪，递与妖王。妖王轮枪拽步，也无甚么盔甲，只是腰间束一条锦绣战裙，赤着脚，走出门前。行者与八戒，抬头观看，但见那怪物：面如傅粉三分白，唇若涂朱一表才。鬓挽青云欺靛染，眉分新月似刀裁。战裙巧绣盘龙凤，形比哪吒更富胎。双手绰枪威凛冽，祥光护体出门来。哏声响若春雷吼，暴眼明如掣电乖。要识此魔真姓氏，名扬千古唤红孩。那红孩儿怪，出得门来，高叫道：</p>

<p>“是甚么人，在我这里吆喝！”行者近前笑道：“我贤侄莫弄虚头，你今早在山路旁，高吊在松树梢头，是那般一个瘦怯怯的黄病孩儿，哄了我师父。我倒好意驮着你，你就弄风儿把我师父摄将来。你如今又弄这个样子，我岂不认得你？趁早送出我师父，不要白了面皮，失了亲情，恐你令尊知道，怪我老孙以长欺幼，不象模样。”那怪闻言，心中大怒，咄的一声喝道：“那泼猴头！我与你有甚亲情？你在这里满口胡柴，绰甚声经儿！那个是你贤侄？”行者道：“哥哥，是你也不晓得。当年我与你令尊做弟兄时，你还不知在那里哩。”那怪道：“这猴子一发胡说！你是那里人，我是那里人，怎么得与我父亲做兄弟？”行者道：“你是不知，我乃五百年前大闹天宫的齐天大圣孙悟空是也。我当初未闹天宫时，遍游海角天涯，四大部洲，无方不到。那时节，专慕豪杰，你令尊叫做牛魔王，称为平天大圣，与我老孙结为七弟兄，让他做了大哥；还有个蛟魔王，称为复海大圣，做了二哥；又有个大鹏魔王，称为混天大圣，做了三哥；又有个狮狔王，称为移山大圣，做了四哥；又有个猕猴王，称为通风大圣，做了五哥；又有个獝狨王，称为驱神大圣，做了六哥；惟有老孙身小，称为齐天大圣，排行第七。我老弟兄们那时节耍子时，还不曾生你哩！”</p>

<p>那怪物闻言，那里肯信，举起火尖枪就刺。行者正是那会家不忙，又使了一个身法，闪过枪头，轮起铁棒，骂道：“你这小畜生，不识高低！看棍！”那妖精也使身法，让过铁棒道：“泼猢狲，不达时务！看枪！”他两个也不论亲情，一齐变脸，各使神通，跳在云端里，好杀：行者名声大，魔王手段强。一个横举金箍棒，一个直挺火尖枪。吐雾遮三界，喷云照四方。一天杀气凶声吼，日月星辰不见光。语言无逊让，情意两乖张。那一个欺心失礼仪，这一个变脸没纲常。棒架威风长，枪来野性狂。一个是混元真大圣，一个是正果善财郎。二人努力争强胜，只为唐僧拜法王。那妖魔与孙大圣战经二十合，不分胜败。猪八戒在旁边，看得明白：妖精虽不败降，却只是遮拦隔架，全无攻杀之能；行者纵不赢他，棒法精强，来往只在那妖精头上，不离了左右。八戒暗想道：“不好啊，行者溜撒，一时间丢个破绽，哄那妖魔钻进来，一铁棒打倒，就没了我的功劳。”你看他抖擞精神，举着九齿钯，在空里，望妖精劈头就筑。那怪见了心惊，急拖枪败下阵来。行者喝教八戒：“赶上！赶上！”</p>

<p>二人赶到他洞门前，只见妖精一只手举着火尖枪，站在那中间一辆小车儿上，一只手捏着拳头，往自家鼻子上捶了两拳。八戒笑道：“这厮放赖不羞！你好道捶破鼻子，淌出些血来，搽红了脸，往那里告我们去耶？”那妖魔捶了两拳，念个咒语，口里喷出火来，鼻子里浓烟迸出，闸闸眼火焰齐生。那五辆车子上，火光涌出。连喷了几口，只见那红焰焰、大火烧空，把一座火云洞，被那烟火迷漫，真个是熯天炽地。八戒慌了道：“哥哥，不停当！这一钻在火里，莫想得活，把老猪弄做个烧熟的，加上香料，尽他受用哩！快走！快走！”说声走，他也不顾行者，跑过涧去了。这行者神通广大，捏着避火诀，撞入火中，寻那妖怪。那妖怪见行者来，又吐上几口，那火比前更胜。好火：炎炎烈烈盈空燎，赫赫威威遍地红。却似火轮飞上下，犹如炭屑舞西东。这火不是燧人钻木，又不是老子炮丹，非天火，非野火，乃是妖魔修炼成真三昧火。五辆车儿合五行，五行生化火煎成。肝木能生心火旺，心火致令脾土平。脾土生金金化水，水能生木彻通灵。生生化化皆因火，火遍长空万物荣。妖邪久悟呼三昧，永镇西方第一名。行者被他烟火飞腾，不能寻怪，看不见他洞门前路径，抽身跳出火中。那妖精在门首，看得明白，他见行者走了，却才收了火具，帅群妖，转于洞内，闭了石门，以为得胜，着小的排宴奏乐、欢笑不题。</p>

<p>却说行者跳过枯松涧，按下云头，只听得八戒与沙僧朗朗的在松间讲话。行者上前喝八戒道：“你这呆子，全无人气！你就惧怕妖火，败走逃生，却把老孙丢下，早是我有些南北哩！”</p>

<p>八戒笑道：“哥啊，你被那妖精说着了，果然不达时务。古人云：</p>

<p>识得时务者，呼为俊杰。那妖精不与你亲，你强要认亲；既与你赌斗，放出那般无情的火来，又不走，还要与他恋战哩！”行者道：“那怪物的手段比我何如？”八戒道：“不济。”“枪法比我何如？”八戒道：“也不济。老猪见他撑持不住，却来助你一钯，不期他不识耍，就败下阵来，没天理，就放火了。”行者道：“正是你不该来。我再与他斗几合，我取巧儿捞他一棒，却不是好？”</p>

<p>他两个只管论那妖精的手段，讲那妖精的火毒，沙和尚倚着松根笑得呆了。行者看见道：“兄弟，你笑怎么？你好道有甚手段，擒得那妖魔，破得那火阵？这桩事，也是大家有益的事。常言道，众毛攒毬。你若拿得妖魔，救了师父，也是你的一件大功绩。”沙僧道：“我也没甚手段，也不能降妖。我笑你两个都着了忙也。”行者道：“我怎么着忙？”沙僧道：“那妖精手段不如你，枪法不如你，只是多了些火势，故不能取胜。若依小弟说，以相生相克拿他，有甚难处？”行者闻言，呵呵笑道：“兄弟说得有理。果然我们着忙了，忘了这事。若以相生相克之理论之，须是以水克火，却往那里寻些水来，泼灭这妖火，可不救了师父？”沙僧道：“正是这般，不必迟疑。”行者道：“你两个只在此间，莫与他索战，待老孙去东洋大海求借龙兵，将些水来，泼息妖火，捉这泼怪。”八戒道：“哥哥放心前去，我等理会得。”</p>

<p>好大圣，纵云离此地，顷刻到东洋，却也无心看玩海景，使个逼水法，分开波浪。正行时，见一个巡海夜叉相撞，看见是孙大圣，急回到水晶宫里，报知那老龙王。敖广即率龙子、龙孙、虾兵、蟹卒一齐出门迎接，请里面坐。坐定，礼毕告茶，行者道：</p>

<p>“不劳茶，有一事相烦。我因师父唐僧往西天拜佛取经，经过号山枯松涧火云洞，有个红孩儿妖精，号圣婴大王，把我师父拿了去。是老孙寻到洞边，与他交战，他却放出火来。我们禁不得他，想着水能克火，特来问你求些水去，与我下场大雨，泼灭了妖火，救唐僧一难。”那龙王道：“大圣差了，若要求取雨水，不该来问我。”行者道：“你是四海龙王，主司雨泽，不来问你，却去问谁？”龙王道：“我虽司雨，不敢擅专，须得玉帝旨意，吩咐在那地方，要几尺几寸，甚么时辰起住，还要三官举笔，太乙移文，会令了雷公电母，风伯云童俗语云，龙无云而不行哩。”</p>

<p>行者道：“我也不用着风云雷电，只是要些雨水灭火。”龙王道：</p>

<p>“大圣不用风云雷电，但我一人也不能助力，着舍弟们同助大圣一功如何？”行者道：“令弟何在？”龙王道：“南海龙王敖钦、北海龙王敖闰、西海龙王敖顺。”行者笑道：“我若再游过三海，不如上界去求玉帝旨意了。”龙王道：“不消大圣去，只我这里撞动铁鼓金钟，他自顷刻而至。”行者闻其言道：“老龙王，快撞钟鼓。”</p>

<p>须臾间，三海龙王拥至，问：“大哥，有何事命弟等？”敖广道：“孙大圣在这里借雨助力降妖。”三弟即引进见毕，行者备言借水之事，众神个个欢从，即点起鲨鱼骁勇为前部，鳠痴口大作先锋。鲤元帅翻波跳浪，鯾提督吐雾喷风。鲭太尉东方打哨，鲌都司西路催征。红眼马郎南面舞，黑甲将军北下冲。鱑把总中军掌号，五方兵处处英雄。纵横机巧鼋枢密，妙算玄微龟相分。有谋有智鼍丞相，多变多能鳖总戎。横行蟹士轮长剑，直跳虾婆扯硬弓。鲇外郎查明文簿，点龙兵出离波中。</p>

<p>诗曰：四海龙王喜助功，齐天大圣请相从。只因三藏途中难，借水前来灭火红。</p>

<p>那行者领着龙兵，不多时早到号山枯松涧上。行者道：“敖氏昆玉，有烦远涉。此间乃妖魔之处，汝等且停于空中，不要出头露面。让老孙与他赌斗，若赢了他，不须列位捉拿；若输与他，也不用列位助阵。只是他但放火时，可听我呼唤，一齐喷雨。”龙王俱如号令。</p>

<p>行者却按云头，入松林里见了八戒、沙僧，叫声：“兄弟。”</p>

<p>八戒道：“哥哥来得快哑！可曾请得龙王来？”行者道：“俱来了。</p>

<p>你两个切须仔细，只怕雨大，莫湿了行李，待老孙与他打去。”</p>

<p>沙僧道：“师兄放心前去，我等俱理会得了。”行者跳过涧，到了门首，叫声“开门！”那些小妖又去报道：“孙行者又来了。”红孩仰面笑道：“那猴子想是火中不曾烧了他，故此又来。这一来切莫饶他，断然烧个皮焦肉烂才罢！”急纵身，挺着长枪，教：“小的们，推出火车子来！”他出门前对行者道：“你又来怎的？”行者道：“还我师父来。”那怪道：“你这猴头，忒不通变。那唐僧与你做得师父，也与我做得按酒，你还思量要他哩，莫想莫想！”</p>

<p>行者闻言，十分恼怒，掣金箍棒劈头就打。那妖精，使火尖枪，急架相迎。这一场赌斗，比前不同，好杀：怒发泼妖魔，恼急猴王将。这一个专救取经僧，那一个要吃唐三藏。心变没亲情，情疏无义让。这个恨不得捉住活剥皮，那个恨不得拿来生蘸酱，真个忒英雄，果然多猛壮。棒来枪架赌输赢，枪去棒迎争下上。举手相轮二十回，两家本事一般样。那妖王与行者战经二十回合，见得不能取胜，虚幌一枪，怎抽身，捏着拳头，又将鼻子捶了两下，却就喷出火来。那门前车子上，烟火迸起；口眼中，赤焰飞腾。孙大圣回头叫道：“龙王何在？”那龙王兄弟，帅众水族，望妖精火光里喷下雨来。好雨！真个是：潇潇洒洒，密密沉沉。潇潇洒洒，如天边坠落星辰；密密沉沉，似海口倒悬浪滚。起初时如拳大小，次后来瓮泼盆倾。满地浇流鸭顶绿，高山洗出佛头青。沟壑水飞千丈玉，涧泉波涨万条银。三叉路口看看满，九曲溪中渐渐平。这个是唐僧有难神龙助，扳倒天河往下倾。那雨淙综大小，莫能止息那妖精的火势。原来龙王私雨，只好泼得凡火，妖精的三昧真火，如何泼得？好一似火上浇油，越泼越灼。大圣道：“等我捻着诀。钻入火中！”轮铁棒，寻妖要打。那妖见他来到，将一口烟，劈脸喷来。行者急回头，煼得眼花雀乱，忍不住泪落如雨。原来这大圣不怕火，只怕烟。当年因大闹天宫时，被老君放在八封炉中，锻过一番，他幸在那巽位安身，不曾烧坏，只是风搅得烟来，把他煼做火眼金睛，故至今只是怕烟。那妖又喷一口，行者当不得，纵云头走了。那妖王却又收了火具，回归洞府。</p>

<p>这大圣一身烟火，炮燥难禁，径投于涧水内救火。怎知被冷水一逼，弄得火气攻心，三魂出舍，可怜气塞胸堂喉舌冷，魂飞魄散丧残生！慌得那四海龙王在半空里，收了雨泽，高声大叫：“天蓬元帅！卷帘将军！休在林中藏隐，且寻你师兄出来！”</p>

<p>八戒与沙僧听得呼他圣号，急忙解了马、挑着担奔出林来，也不顾泥泞，顺涧边找寻，只见那上溜头，翻波滚浪，急流中淌下一个人来。沙僧见了，连衣跳下水中，抱上岸来，却是孙大圣身躯。噫！你看他踡跼四肢伸不得，浑身上下冷如冰。沙和尚满眼垂泪道：“师兄！可惜了你，亿万年不老长生客，如今化作个中途短命人！”八戒笑道：“兄弟莫哭，这猴子佯推死，吓我们哩。你摸他摸，胸前还有一点热气没有？”沙僧道：“浑身都冷了，就有一点儿热气，怎的就是回生？”八戒道：“他有七十二般变化，就有七十二条性命。你扯着脚，等我摆布他。”真个那沙僧扯着脚，八戒扶着头，把他拽个直，推上脚来，盘膝坐定。八戒将两手搓热，仵住他的七窍，使一个按摩禅法。原来那行者被冷水逼了，气阻丹田，不能出声，却幸得八戒按摸揉擦，须臾间，气透三关，转明堂，冲开孔窍，叫了一声：“师父啊！”沙僧道：“哥啊，你生为师父，死也还在口里，且苏醒，我们在这里哩。”行者睁开眼道：“兄弟们在这里？老孙吃了亏也！”八戒笑道：“你才子发昏的，若不是老猪救你啊，已此了帐了，还不谢我哩！”行者却才起身，仰面道：“敖氏弟兄何在？”那四海龙王在半空中答应道：“小龙在此伺候。”行者道：“累你远劳，不曾成得功果，且请回去，改日再谢。”龙王帅水族，泱泱而回，不在话下。</p>

<p>沙僧搀着行者，一同到松林之下坐定。少时间，却定神顺气，止不住泪滴腮边，又叫：“师父啊！忆昔当年出大唐，岩前救我脱灾殃。三山六水遭魔障，万苦千辛割寸肠。托钵朝餐随厚薄，参禅暮宿或林庄。一心指望成功果，今日安知痛受伤！”沙僧道：“哥哥，且休烦恼，我们早安计策，去那里请兵助力，搭救师父耶？”行者道：“那里请救么？”沙僧道：“当初菩萨吩咐，着我等保护唐僧，他曾许我们，叫天天应，叫地地应。那里请救去？”行者道：“想老孙大闹天宫时，那些神兵，都禁不得我。这妖精神通不小，须是比老孙手段大些的，才降得他哩。天神不济，地煞不能，若要拿此妖魔，须是去请观音菩萨才好。奈何我皮肉酸麻，腰膝疼痛，驾不起筋斗云，怎生请得？”八戒道：“有甚话吩咐，等我去请。”行者笑道：“也罢，你是去得。若见了菩萨，切休仰视，只可低头礼拜。等他问时，你却将地名、妖名说与他，再请教师父之事。他若肯来，定取擒了怪物。”八戒闻言，即便驾了云雾，向南而去。</p>

<p>却说那个妖王在洞里欢喜道：“小的们，孙行者吃了亏去了。这一阵虽不得他死，好道也发个大昏。咦，只怕他又请救兵来也，快开门，等我去看他请谁。”众妖开了门，妖精就跳在空里观看，只见八戒往南去了。妖精想着南边再无他处，断然是请观音菩萨，急按下云，叫：“小的们，把我那皮袋寻出来。多时不用，只恐口绳不牢，与我换上一条，放在二门之下，等我去把八戒赚将回来，装于袋内，蒸得稀烂，犒劳你们。”原来那妖精有一个如意的皮袋。众小妖拿出来、换了口绳，安于洞门内不题。</p>

<p>却说那妖王久居于此，俱是熟游之地，他晓得那条路上南海去近，那条去远。他从那近路上，一驾云头，赶过了八戒，端坐在壁岩之上，变作一个“假观世音”模样，等候着八戒。那呆子正纵云行处，忽然望见菩萨，他那里识得真假？这才是见象作佛。呆子停云下拜道：“菩萨，弟子猪悟能叩头。”妖精道：“你不保唐僧去取经，却见我有何事干？”八戒道：“弟子因与师父行至中途，遇着号山枯松涧火云洞，有个红孩儿妖精，他把我师父摄了去。是弟子与师兄等，寻上他门，与他交战。他原来会放火，头一阵，不曾得赢；第二阵，请龙王助雨，也不能灭火。</p>

<p>师兄被他烧坏了，不能行动，着弟子来请菩萨，万望垂慈，救我师父一难！”妖精道：“那火云洞洞主，不是个伤生的，一定是你们冲撞了他也。”八戒道：“我不曾冲撞他，是师兄悟空冲撞他的。他变作一个小孩子，吊在树上，试我师父。师父甚有善心，教我解下来，着师兄驮他一程。是师兄掼了他一掼，他就弄风儿，把师父摄去了。”妖精道：“你起来，跟我进那洞里见洞主，与你说个人情，你陪一个礼，把你师父讨出来罢。”八戒道：“菩萨呀，若肯还我师父，就磕他一个头也罢。”妖王道：“你跟来。”</p>

<p>那呆子不知好歹，就跟着他，径回旧路，却不向南洋海，随赴火云门，顷刻间，到了门首。妖精进去道：“你休疑忌，他是我的故人，你进来。”呆子只得举步入门。众妖一齐呐喊，将八戒捉倒，装于袋内，束紧了口绳，高吊在驮梁之上。妖精现了本象，坐在当中道：“猪八戒，你有甚么手段，就敢保唐僧取经，就敢请菩萨降我？你大睁着两个眼，还不认得我是圣婴大王哩！如今拿你，吊得三五日，蒸熟了赏赐小妖，权为案酒！”八戒听言，在里面骂道：“泼怪物！十分无礼！若论你百计千方，骗了我吃，管教你一个个遭肿头天瘟！”呆子骂了又骂，嚷了又嚷，不题。</p>

<p>却说孙大圣与沙僧正坐，只见一阵腥风，刮面而过，他就打了一个喷嚏道：“不好！不好！这阵风，凶多吉少。想是猪八戒走错路也。”沙僧道：“他错了路，不会问人？”行者道：“想必撞见妖精了。”沙僧道：“撞见妖精，他不会跑回？”行者道：“不停当。你坐在这里看守，等我跑过涧去打听打听。”沙僧道：“师兄腰疼，只恐又着他手，等小弟去罢。”行者道：“你不济事，还让我去。”好行者，咬着牙，忍着疼，捻着铁棒，走过涧，到那火云洞前，叫声“泼怪！”那把门的小妖，又急入里报：“孙行者又在门首叫哩！”那妖王传令叫拿，那伙小妖，枪刀簇拥，齐声呐喊，即开门，都道：“拿住！拿住！”行者果然疲倦，不敢相迎，将身钻在路旁，念个咒语叫“变！”即变做一个销金包袱。小妖看见，报道：“大王，孙行者怕了，只见说一声拿字，慌得把包袱丢下，走了。”妖王笑道：“那包袱也无甚么值钱之物，左右是和尚的破褊衫，旧帽子，背进来拆洗做补衬。”一个小妖，果将包袱背进，不知是行者变的。行者道：“好了！这个销金包袱，背着了！”那妖精不以为事，丢在门内。</p>

<p>好行者，假中又假，虚里还虚：即拔一根毫毛，吹口仙气，变作个包袱一样；他的真身，却又变作一个苍蝇儿，钉在门枢上。只听得八戒在那里哼哩哼的，声音不清，却似一个瘟猪。行者嘤的飞了去寻时，原来他吊在皮袋里也。行者钉在皮袋，又听得他恶言恶语骂道妖怪长，妖怪短，“你怎么假变作个观音菩萨，哄我回来，吊我在此，还说要吃我！有一日，我师兄大展齐天无量法，满山泼怪登时擒！解开皮袋放我出，筑你千钯方趁心！”行者闻言暗笑道：“这呆子虽然在这里面受闷气，却还不倒了旗枪。老孙一定要拿了此怪，若不如此，怎生雪恨！”正欲设法拯救八戒出来，只听那妖王叫道：“六健将何在？”时有六个小妖，是他知己的精灵，封为健将，都有名字：一个叫做云里雾，一个叫做雾里云，一个叫做急如火，一个叫做快如风，一个叫做兴烘掀，一个叫做掀烘兴。六健将上前跪下，妖王道：</p>

<p>“你们认得老大王家么？”六健将道：“认得。”妖王道：“你与我星夜去请老大王来，说我这里捉唐僧蒸与他吃，寿延千纪。”六怪领命，一个个厮拖厮扯，径出门去了。行者嘤的一声，飞下袋来，跟定那六怪，躲离洞中。毕竟不知怎的请来，且听下回分解。</p>
