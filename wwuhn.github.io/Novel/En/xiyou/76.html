<P>The Mind-Ape Bores a Hole in the Male and Female Jar</P>
<P>The Demon King Returns and the Way Is Preserved</P>
</div>
<P>The story tells how the Great Sage Sun went in through the entrance of the cave and looked to either side. This is what he saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Hills of skeletons,</P>
<P>Forests of bones,</P>
<P>Human heads and hair trampled into felt,</P>
<P>Human skin and flesh rotted into mud,</P>
<P>Sinews twisted round trees,</P>
<P>Dried and shining like silver.</P>
<P>Truly there was a mountain of corpses, a sea of blood,</P>
<P>An unbearable stench of corruption.</P>
<P>The little devils to the East</P>
<P>Sliced the living flesh off human victims;</P>
<P>The evil demons to the West</P>
<P>Boiled and fried fresh human meat.</P>
<P>Apart from the heroic Handsome Monkey King</P>
<P>No common mortal would have dared go in.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He was soon inside the second gates, and when he looked around here he saw that things were different from outside. Here was purity, quiet elegance, beauty and calm. To left and right were rare and wonderful plants; all around were tall pines and jade-green bamboo. After another two or three miles he reached the third gates, slipped inside for a peep, and saw the three old demons sitting on high. They looked thoroughly evil. The one in the middle</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Had teeth like chisels and saws,</P>
<P>A round head and a square face.</P>
<P>His voice roared like thunder;</P>
<P>His eyes flashed like lightning.</P>
<P>Upturned nostrils faced the sky;</P>
<P>Red eyebrows blazed with fire.</P>
<P>Wherever he walked</P>
<P>The animals were terrified;</P>
<P>If he sat down</P>
<P>The demons all trembled.</P>
<P>He was the king among the beasts,</P>
<P>The Blue-haired Lion Monster.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The one sitting on his left was like this:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Phoenix eyes with golden pupils,</P>
<P>Yellow tusks and powerful thighs.</P>
<P>Silver hair sprouting from a long nose,</P>
<P>Making his head look like a tail.</P>
<P>His brow was rounded and wrinkled,</P>
<P>His body massively heavy.</P>
<P>His voice as delicate as a beautiful woman's,</P>
<P>But his face was as fiendish as an ox-headed demon's.</P>
<P>He treasured his tusks and cultivated his person for many years,</P>
<P>The Ancient Yellow-tusked Elephant.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The one on the right had</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Golden wings and a leviathan's head,</P>
<P>Leopard eyes with starry pupils.</P>
<P>He shook the North when he headed South,</P>
<P>Fierce, strong and brave.</P>
<P>When he turned to soaring</P>
<P>Quails laughed but dragons were terrified.</P>
<P>When he beat his phoenix wings the birds all hid their heads,</P>
<P>And the beasts all lost their nerve when he spread his talons.</P>
<P>He could fly thirty thousand miles through the clouds,</P>
<P>The Mighty Roc.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Beneath these two were ranged a hundred and ten commanders high and low, all in full armor and looking most imposing and murderous. The sight delighted Brother Monkey, who strode inside, quite unafraid, put down his clappers and bell, and called, &#8220;Your Majesties.&#8221;</P>
<P>The three old demons chuckled and replied, &#8220;So you're back, young Wind-piercer.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;When you were patrolling what did you find out about where Sun the Novice is?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesties,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;I don't dare tell you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; the senior demon chief asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I was walking along sounding my clappers and ringing my bell following Your Majesties' orders,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;when all of a sudden I looked up and saw someone squatting and polishing a pole there. He looked like one of the gods that clear the way. If he'd stood up he'd have been well over a hundred feet tall. He'd scooped up some water in his hand and was polishing his iron bar on the rocky scar. He was saying to himself that his cudgel still hadn't the chance to show its magical powers here and that when he'd shined it up he was coming to attack Your Majesties. That's how I realized he was Sun the Novice and came here to report.&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing this the senior demon chief broke into a sweat all over and shivered so that his teeth chattered as he said, &#8220;Brothers, I don't think we should start any trouble with the Tang Priest. His disciple has tremendous magical powers and he's polishing his cudgel to attack us. Whatever are we to do?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Little ones,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;call everybody, high and low, who's outside the cave to come inside and shut the gates. Let them pass.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; said one of the subordinate officers who knew what had happened, &#8220;the little devils outside have all scattered.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why?&#8221; the senior demon asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;They must have heard about his terrible reputation. Shut the gates at once! At once!&#8221; The hosts of demons noisily bolted all the front and back gates firmly.</P>
<P>&#8220;Now they've shut the gates they might ask me all sorts of questions about things in here,&#8221; Monkey thought with alarm &#8220;If I don't know the right answers I'll give the game away and they'll catch me. I'd better give them another scare and get them to open the gates to let me out.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; he said, stepping forward, &#8220;there were some other wicked things he said.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What else?&#8221; the senior demon chief asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;He said he was going to skin Your Senior Majesty,&#8221; replied Brother Monkey, &#8220;slice up the bones of His Second Majesty, and rip out His Third Majesty's sinews. If you shut the gates and refuse to go out he can do transformations. He might turn himself into a fly, get in through a crack between the gates and catch us all. Then we'll be done for.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Be very careful, brothers,&#8221; said the senior demon. &#8220;We haven't had a fly here for years, so any fly that gets in will be Sun the Novice.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So I'll change into a fly and frighten them into opening the gates,&#8221; thought Monkey, smiling to himself. The splendid Great Sage then slipped aside, reached up to pull a hair from the back of his head, blew on it with a magic breath, called &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned it into a golden fly that flew straight into the old demon's face.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brothers,&#8221; said the old demon in a panic, &#8220;this is terrible! He's inside!&#8221; All the demons great and small were so alarmed that they rushed forward to swat the fly with their rakes and brooms.</P>
<P>The Great Sage could not help giggling aloud, which was just what he should not have done as it revealed his true face. The third demon chief leapt forward, grabbed him and said, &#8220;Brothers, he almost had us fooled.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Who had who fooled?&#8221; the senior demon asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The young devil who reported just now was no junior Wind-piercer,&#8221; the third chief replied, &#8220;but Sun the Novice himself. He must have run into a junior Wind-piercer and somehow or other murdered him and done this transformation to trick us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He's rumbled me,&#8221; thought Monkey with alarm, rubbing his face.</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean, I'm Sun the Novice?&#8221; Monkey said to the senior demon chief. &#8220;I'm a junior Wind-piercer. His Majesty's mistaken.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said the senior demon, &#8220;he really is a junior Wind-piercer. He's in the roll-call out front three times a day. I know him. Do you have a pass?&#8221; he went on to ask Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Monkey replied, pulling his clothes apart to produce it. Seeing that it looked genuine the senior demon said, &#8220;Brother, don't mistreat him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Elder brother,&#8221; the third demon chief replied, &#8220;didn't you see him slip aside just now and giggle? I saw him show his face: it's like a thunder god's. When I grabbed hold of him he turned back into what he looks like now. Little ones,&#8221; he called, &#8220;fetch ropes!&#8221; The officers then fetched ropes.</P>
<P>The third demon chief knocked Monkey over and tied his hands and feet together. When his clothes were stripped off he was most evidently the Protector of the Horses. Now of the seventy-two transformations that Monkey could perform, when he turned himself into a bird, a beast, a plant, a tree, a vessel or an insect he changed his whole body. When he turned into another person, however, he could only change his head and face but not his body, and indeed he was still covered with brown hair and had red thighs and a tail.</P>
<P>&#8220;That's Sun the Novice's body,&#8221; the senior demon chief said when he saw this, &#8220;and a junior Wind-piercer's face. It's him! Little ones,&#8221; he ordered, &#8220;bring wine and give His Third Majesty a cup of it to congratulate him. Now that we've captured Sun the Novice the Tang Priest is as good as a meal in our mouths.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We mustn't drink now,&#8221; said the third demon chief. &#8220;Sun the Novice is a slippery customer and is good at escaping by magic. I'm worried he might get away. Tell the juniors to bring the jar out and put him inside. Then we can drink.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said the senior demon chief with a smile, who then chose thirty-six little demons to go inside, open the storerooms, and carry the jar out. Do you know how big the jar was? It was only two feet four inches high. So why were thirty-six people needed to carry it? It was because the jar was a treasure of the two vital forces, male and female, and contained the seven precious things, the eight trigrams and the twenty-four periods of the year that thirty-six carriers were required to match the number of the stars of the Dipper. Before long the precious jar had been carried out, set down outside the third pair of gates, cleaned up and opened. Monkey was untied, stripped bare and sucked inside the jar with a hiss by magical vapor that came out of it.</P>
<P>The lid was then put back on and sealed on with a label, after which the demons went off to drink, saying, &#8220;Now that he's in our jar that monkey can forget all about his journey West. The only way he'll be able to pay his respects to the Buddha and fetch the scriptures now will be by pushing the wheel of destiny backwards and being reborn.&#8221; Watch how all the demons great and small go laughing off to celebrate. But of that no more.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Once inside the jar the Great Sage, who was very cramped, decided to transform himself and squat down in the middle, where he found it very cool. &#8220;Those evil spirits don't live up to their reputation,&#8221; he said to himself, laughing aloud. &#8220;Why ever do they tell people that anyone put in this jar will be turned to pus and blood in a few moments. It's so cool that spending seven or eight years here would be no problem.&#8221;</P>
<P>Alas! The Great Sage did not know about this treasure. Anyone put inside it who said nothing for a year would stay cool for a year; but the moment a voice was heard fires began to turn. Before Monkey had finished speaking the whole jar was full of flame. Luckily he could use the knack of making fire-averting magic with his hands as he sat in the middle of the jar completely unafraid. When he had endured the flames for an hour forty snakes emerged from all around to bite him. Swinging his arms about him Monkey grabbed hold of all of them, twisted with all his strength, and broke them into eighty pieces. A little later three fire dragons appeared to circle above and below Monkey, which was really unbearable.</P>
<P>It drove Monkey into a helpless desperation of which he was only too conscious, &#8220;The other things were no trouble,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but these three fire dragons are a real problem. If I don't get out soon the fire will attack my heart, and what then? I'll make myself grow,&#8221; he went on to think, &#8220;and push my way out.&#8221; The splendid Great Sage made a spell with his hands, said the words of a spell and called out, &#8220;Grow!&#8221; He made himself over a dozen feet tall, but as he grew the jar grew with him, enclosing him tightly. When he made himself smaller, the jar shrank too.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is terrible,&#8221; Brother Monkey thought with alarm, &#8220;terrible. It grows when I grow and shrinks when I get smaller. Why? What am I to do?&#8221; Before he had finished speaking his ankle began to hurt. Putting his hand down at once to feel it he found that it had been burnt so badly it had gone soft. &#8220;I don't know what to do,&#8221; he said with anxiety, &#8220;My ankle's been cooked tender. I'm a cripple now.&#8221; He could not stop the tears from flowing. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When suffering at the demons' hands he thought of his master;</P>
<P>In facing deadly peril he worried about the Tang Priest.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;since I was converted by the Bodhisattva Guanyin and delivered from my heavenly punishment you and I have toiled over many a mountain. I've beaten and wiped out a lot of monsters, subdued Pig and Friar Sand, and gone through no end of suffering. All this was done in the hope of reaching the West and completing the true achievement together. Never did I expect to meet these vicious demons today. Now I've been stupid enough to get myself killed in here I've left you stuck in the middle of the mountains. What a mess to be in for someone who used to be as famous as I was!&#8221;</P>
<P>Just when he was feeling thoroughly miserable he suddenly remembered, &#8220;Years ago the Bodhisattva gave me three life-saving hairs on the Coiled Snake Mountain. I wonder if I've still got them. I'd better look for them.&#8221; He felt all over his body and found three very rigid hairs on the back of his head.</P>
<P>&#8220;All the other hair on my body is soft except for these three that are as hard as spears,&#8221; he said with delight. &#8220;They must be my lifesavers.&#8221; Gritting his teeth against the pain, he pulled the three hairs out, blew on them with magic breath and called, &#8220;Change!&#8221; One of them turned into a steel drill, one into a strip of bamboo, and one into a silken cord. He made the bamboo strip into a bow to which he fixed the drill. After a noisy spell of drilling at the bottom of the jar he made a hole through which the light came in. &#8220;I'm in luck,&#8221; he said with glee, &#8220;I'm in luck. Now I can get out.&#8221; No sooner had he transformed himself ready to escape than the jar became cool again. Why was that? It cooled because the hole he had bored in it let the male and female vital forces escape.</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage put his hairs back, made himself small by turning into the tiniest of insects, a very delicate creature as thin as a whisker and as long as an eyebrow hair, and slipped out through the hole. Instead of making his escape Monkey flew straight to the senior demon chief's head and landed on it. The senior demon, who was drinking, slammed his goblet down and asked, &#8220;Third brother, has Sun the Novice been liquefied yet?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Is the time up?&#8221; the third demon chief asked. The senior demon told his messengers to carry the jar in. When the thirty-six young devils picked the jar up they found that it was far lighter.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; they reported with alarm, &#8220;the jar's lighter.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; the senior demon shouted. &#8220;It has the full powers of the male and female vital forces. It couldn't possibly get lighter.&#8221;</P>
<P>One of the junior demons who liked showing off picked the jar up and said, &#8220;Look. It is lighter, isn't it?&#8221; When the senior demon took the lid off to look in he saw that it was bright inside.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's empty,&#8221; he could not help shouting aloud, &#8220;it's leaked.&#8221; And Monkey, sitting on his head, could not help shouting, &#8220;Search, my lads! He's escaped.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He's escaped,&#8221; all the monsters shouted, &#8220;he's escaped!&#8221; The order was then given to shut the gates.</P>
<P>With that Monkey shook himself, took back the clothes that had been taken off him, turned back into himself and leapt out of the cave. &#8220;Behave yourselves, evil spirits,&#8221; he flung back insultingly. &#8220;I've bored through the jar and you can't keep anyone in it any more. You'll have to take it outside and shit in it.&#8221;</P>
<P>Shouting and yelling with glee he went straight back on his cloud to where the Tang Priest was. Here he found the venerable gentleman making symbolic incense with a pinch of earth and praying to the sky. Monkey stopped his cloud to listen to what he was saying. Sanzang had his hands together in front of his chest and was saying to Heaven,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;All you immortals up there in the clouds,</P>
<P>The Dings and the Jias and each god and goddess,</P>
<P>Protect my disciple, whose powers are enormous,</P>
<P>And magic is boundless, the good Sun the Novice.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the Great Sage heard this he decided to redouble his efforts. Putting his cloud away he went up to Sanzang and called, &#8220;Master, I'm back.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang held him as he said, &#8220;Wukong, you have been to great trouble. I was very concerned because you had gone so far into these high mountains and not come back for so long a time. How dangerous is the mountain in fact?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; Monkey replied with a smile, &#8220;that trip just now depended in the first place on the good destiny of all the living beings in the East, secondly on your boundless achievement and great virtue, and thirdly on your disciple's magical powers.&#8221; Then he told the whole story of how he had pretended to be a Wind-piercer, been drawn into the jar and escaped.</P>
<P>&#8220;Now I've seen your face again, Master, It's like having a second life.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang expressed endless thanks then asked, &#8220;Did you not fight the evil spirits this time?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No, I didn't,&#8221; replied Brother Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Then you won't be able to escort me safely across this mountain,&#8221; Sanzang said, at which Monkey, who hated to admit he was beaten, shouted, &#8220;What do you mean, I won't be able to escort you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you and they have not yet had it out and you can only give me evasive answers I will never dare press ahead,&#8221; the venerable elder replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; laughed the Great Sage, &#8220;you really don't understand. As the saying goes, you can't spin a thread from a single strand of silk, and you can't clap one-handed. There are three demon chiefs and thousands of the little devils. How could I fight them all single-handed?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you are that outnumbered you would indeed find it hard by yourself,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;Pig and Friar Sand also have their talents. I shall tell them to go with you to help you clean up the path across the mountain and escort me over it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What you say is completely right, Master,&#8221; replied Monkey with a smile. &#8220;Tell Friar Sand to protect you while Pig comes with me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig in alarm, &#8220;you're a poor judge. I'm rough and I can't do anything much. I'd just get in the way as I walked along. What use would I be to you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You may not be up to much, brother,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;but you're someone. As the saying goes, even a fart can swell the wind. You'd make me feel a bit braver.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;All right,&#8221; Pig said, &#8220;all right. You can take me with you. But don't play any of your tricks on me when the going gets tough.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't forget that Friar Sand and I will be waiting here,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The idiot braced himself and set off a gale with Monkey that carried them by cloud up to the top of the mountain where the entrance to the cave was. They saw at once that the gates were shut tight. There was nobody in sight anywhere around. Monkey went forward, his iron cudgel in his hands, to shout at the top of his voice, &#8220;Open up, evil monsters! Come out right now and fight Monkey!&#8221; When the young devils in the cave went inside to report the senior demon shook with terror as he commented,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've heard tell for years of that monkey's ferocity;</P>
<P>Now I can vouch for the story's veracity.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean, elder brother?&#8221; the second demon chief asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;When that Sun the Novice first turned himself into a fly to sneak in here none of us realized who he was except our Third Brother, who put him in the jar. He used his skills to drill a hole in the jar, pick up his clothes and get out. Now he's outside challenging us to battle. Who's brave enough to be the first to take him on?&#8221; Nobody replied. The senior demon asked again; again there was no response. Everyone was pretending to be deaf and dumb.</P>
<P>&#8220;We've got ourselves a lousy reputation in the West already,&#8221; the senior demon chief said in fury. &#8220;Now that Sun the Novice has treated us with such contempt today our reputation will stand even lower if we don't fight him. I'm going out there to chance my old life on three rounds with him. If I can hold out for those three rounds the Tang Priest will still be a meal in our mouths. If I can't then shut the gates and let them pass.&#8221; He then kitted himself out in his armor, had the gates opened and went out. As Monkey and Pig watched from beside the gates they saw that he was a fine monster:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On iron brow and brazen head a precious helmet</P>
<P>With tassels dancing brightly in the wind.</P>
<P>His eyes both flashed as if with lightning,</P>
<P>And ruddy glowed the hair at his temples.</P>
<P>Pointed and sharp were his silvery claws,</P>
<P>And his saw-like teeth were set close and neat.</P>
<P>His armor was golden, without any seam,</P>
<P>Bound with a dragon sash that could foresee the future.</P>
<P>In his hand flashed a cutlass of steel.</P>
<P>Such martial might is rare in the world.</P>
<P>With a voice that roared like thunder he asked,</P>
<P>&#8220;Who is that knocking at my gates?&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your grandfather, Lord Sun, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven,&#8221; said Monkey, turning to face the gate.</P>
<P>&#8220;Are you Sun the Novice?&#8221; asked the demon with a laugh. &#8220;You've got a cheek, ape. I never gave you any trouble, so why are you here challenging me to battle?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;'No waves come without a wind; without the tide the waters are still,'&#8220; Monkey replied. &#8220;Would I have come looking for you if you hadn't given me trouble? The reason why I'm here to fight is because your gang of foxes and dogs is plotting to eat my master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;From the way you're acting so fierce and shouting at our gates you must want a fight,&#8221; the old demon replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;Stop all that ranting and raving then,&#8221; said the demon. &#8220;It would be most unfair if I brought out my devil soldiers and drew them up in battle order with flags flying and drums beating to fight you as I'm on my own territory. I'll fight you single-handed with no helpers for either side.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he shouted, &#8220;Keep out of the way, Pig, and let's see how he copes with me.&#8221; The idiot did indeed get out of the way.</P>
<P>&#8220;Come over here,&#8221; the senior demon shouted, &#8220;and be a chopping block for me. Let me hack you three times as hard as I can with sword on your bare head. After that I'll let your Tang Priest pass. If you can't take it then hand your Tang Priest over at once. He'll be a tasty morsel to help our rice down.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Bring out a brush and some paper if you have them in your cave and I'll give you a bond. You can hack at me from today till next year, but it'll be nothing to me.&#8221;</P>
<P>The old demon then summoned up all his might, took up a stance with his feet apart, lifted his sword with both hands and hacked at the top of the Great Sage's head. The Great Sage raised his head, and though there was a mighty crash his scalp did not even go red.</P>
<P>&#8220;That monkey really does have a hard head,&#8221; exclaimed the old demon with shock.</P>
<P>&#8220;You wouldn't know about it,&#8221; said Monkey with a laugh. &#8220;I was</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Born with a skull of bronze and iron,</P>
<P>Like nobody else's in all the world.</P>
<P>Hammer and axe will never smash me;</P>
<P>I went in Lord Lao Zi's furnace when I was a boy.</P>
<P>The Star Lords of the Four Dippers helped mould me,</P>
<P>The twenty-eight constellations all used their skill.</P>
<P>I've often been soaked in water but never come to harm,</P>
<P>And all over my body the sinews are knotty.</P>
<P>The Tang Priest, fearing I would not stand firm,</P>
<P>Placed a golden band around my head.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Cut out that insolence, ape,&#8221; the senior demon said, &#8220;and take these two blows from my sword. I'm most certainly not going to spare your life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's nothing,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Have another cut like that if you like.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You monkey,&#8221; the old demon said, &#8220;you don't know about this sword,&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Created in furnaces of metal and fire,</P>
<P>A hundred times tempered by divine craftsmanship.</P>
<P>Its sharp blade follows the Three Strategies,</P>
<P>And it is as strong as described in the Six Plans.</P>
<P>The point is as fine as a housefly's tail,</P>
<P>And supple as the body of a white dragon.</P>
<P>When it goes to the mountains dense clouds arise;</P>
<P>If it plunges into the sea the great waves roll.</P>
<P>It has been burnished times beyond number,</P>
<P>Heated and tempered many hundred times over.</P>
<P>Deep in the mountains it is kept in the caves;</P>
<P>Great is the glory it has won when in battle.</P>
<P>If I use it to strike at your monkish pate</P>
<P>I'll cut it into a pair of gourd ladles.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're blind, evil spirit,&#8221; laughed the Great Sage, &#8220;if you think my head is just gourd ladles. I'll let you hack at me if you're silly enough to want to. Have another go and see what happens.&#8221;</P>
<P>The senior demon raised his sword for another hack, which the Great Sage moved his head forward to meet. With a loud band his head was split into two, whereupon the Great Sage rolled on the ground and gave himself a second body. The sight so alarmed the demon that he lowered his sword.</P>
<P>Watching all this from a distance Pig said with a laugh, &#8220;Give him a couple more hacks, old devil, then there'll be four of him.&#8221;</P>
<P>Pointing at Brother Monkey the senior demon said, &#8220;I'd heard that you can use self-dividing magic. Why are you showing it off to me now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What self-dividing magic?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why was it that the first time I hacked you it made no impact, but this time I cut you in two?&#8221; the senior demon asked. &#8220;Don't worry, evil spirit,&#8221; said the Great Sage with a smile. &#8220;If you cut me ten thousand times there'll be twenty thousand of me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You ape,&#8221; the demon said, &#8220;you may be able to divide yourself but you can't put yourself together again. If you can, hit me with your cudgel.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't talk nonsense,&#8221; said the Great Sage. &#8220;You asked to take three cuts at me but only took two. Now you've invited me to hit you once. I'm not Monkey if I hit you one and a half times.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the senior demon.</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage hugged his two bodies together, rolled, became one body again and struck with his cudgel at the demon's head. The old demon raised his sword to parry the blow. &#8220;Damned ape,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you've got a cheek! How dare you come here attacking me with a mourner's staff like that?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you ask about this cudgel of mine,&#8221; shouted the Great Sage, &#8220;everybody in heaven and earth has heard of it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What's it famous for?&#8221; the senior demon asked. To this Monkey replied:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;The cudgel is made of nine-cycled wrought iron</P>
<P>Tempered by Lord Lao Zi himself in his furnace.</P>
<P>King Yu called it a divine treasure when he obtained it</P>
<P>To hold the eight rivers and four oceans in place.</P>
<P>In its middle the constellations are secretly set out,</P>
<P>And each end is banded with yellow gold.</P>
<P>Ghosts and gods are amazed at its intricate decorations,</P>
<P>Dragon patterns and phoenix signs.</P>
<P>Known as the Divine Male Cudgel,</P>
<P>It was inaccessibly deep in the bed of the sea.</P>
<P>Its shape can change and it knows how to fly,</P>
<P>Sending clouds of many colours drifting through the air.</P>
<P>Once it was mine I took it back to my mountain,</P>
<P>Where I discovered how its infinite changes.</P>
<P>When I want size it's as thick as a vat,</P>
<P>Or it can be as thin as an iron wire,</P>
<P>Huge as a mountain or small as a needle,</P>
<P>Adapting its length to the wishes of my heart.</P>
<P>Lightly I lift it and coloured clouds spring up,</P>
<P>Or it flies through the sky and flashes like lightning.</P>
<P>The cold air it gives off chills all who feel it,</P>
<P>And ominous mists appear in the sky.</P>
<P>I have carried it with me to beat dragons and tigers,</P>
<P>Travelling to all of the ends of the earth.</P>
<P>Once with this cudgel I made havoc in heaven,</P>
<P>And used its great might to wreck the peach banquet.</P>
<P>The heavenly kings were unable to beat me,</P>
<P>And Nezha was hard pressed to match me in combat.</P>
<P>With this cudgel against them the gods had no safe refuge;</P>
<P>A hundred thousand heavenly troops all scattered and fled.</P>
<P>The gods of thunder guarded the Hall of Miraculous Mist</P>
<P>When the cudgel attacked the Palace of Universal Brightness</P>
<P>All of the angels at court were flustered</P>
<P>And the Jade Emperor's ministers were thrown into panic.</P>
<P>I raised my cudgel to overturn the Palace of the Dipper,</P>
<P>Then turned back to shake up the South Pole Compound.</P>
<P>Seeing my dread cudgel at his golden gates</P>
<P>The Jade Emperor invited the Buddha to see me.</P>
<P>The soldier takes defeat and victory in his stride;</P>
<P>There is nothing to choose between suffering and disaster.</P>
<P>I stuck it out for full five hundred years</P>
<P>Until I was converted by the Bodhisattva Guanyin.</P>
<P>Then a holy monk appeared in Tang</P>
<P>Who swore a mighty oath to heaven,</P>
<P>To save the souls in the City of the Unjustly Slain</P>
<P>And fetch the sutras at an assembly on Vulture Mountain.</P>
<P>On the journey to the West are many evil monsters</P>
<P>Whose actions would be a great obstacle to him.</P>
<P>So, knowing that my cudgel is matchless in the world,</P>
<P>He begged me to be his companion on the journey.</P>
<P>When it struck down evil spirits they were sent to the Underworld,</P>
<P>Their flesh turned to red dust and their bones all to powder.</P>
<P>Evil spirits everywhere were killed by the cudgel,</P>
<P>In thousands upon thousands too numerous to count.</P>
<P>Up above it wrecked the Dipper and Bull Palace,</P>
<P>And below it ruined the Senluo Court in Hell.</P>
<P>Of the heavenly generals it routed the Nine Bright Shiners,</P>
<P>And it wounded all of the Underworld's judges.</P>
<P>Dropped from mid-air it shakes mountains and rivers;</P>
<P>It is stronger than the sword of an evil star.</P>
<P>With this cudgel alone I protect the Tang Priest</P>
<P>And kill all the evil monsters in the world.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the monster heard this he trembled, lifted his sword and struck with all his strength. Chuckling, Monkey blocked the blow with his iron cudgel. At first the two of them struggled in front of the cave, but then they both sprang up and fought in mid-air. It was a splendid battle.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The divine rod had once secured the bed of Heaven's River:</P>
<P>The As-You-Will cudgel is the finest in the world,</P>
<P>Praise of its powers enraged the demon chief,</P>
<P>Whose mighty cutlass was full of great magic.</P>
<P>When they fought outside the gates they were still open to reason,</P>
<P>But no mercy was shown in their battle in the sky.</P>
<P>One could change his appearance at will;</P>
<P>The other could make himself grow on the spot.</P>
<P>The fight was so intense that the sky filled with clouds,</P>
<P>And all of the plains were enveloped in mist.</P>
<P>One had often determined to devour the monk Sanzang;</P>
<P>The other used his magic to protect the Tang Priest.</P>
<P>All because the Lord Buddha transmitted the scriptures</P>
<P>Evil and good were opposed in harsh conflict.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The senior demon and the Great Sage fought over twenty rounds without either emerging the victor while Pig admired their magnificent battle from down below until, unable to restrain himself, he grabbed his rake and leapt up into the air, riding on the wind to strike at the evil monster's face. The demon panicked, not realizing that Pig had no staying power, but could only rush recklessly in and give people a fright. All the demon could see was that Pig had a long snout, big ears and a vicious way with his rake, so he abandoned the struggle, threw his sword away, turned and fled.</P>
<P>&#8220;After him,&#8221; the Great Sage shouted, &#8220;after him!&#8221; The idiot raised his rake and went down in all his ferocious might straight after the monster. Seeing how close Pig was to him the old demon stood still in front of the mountainside, faced the wind, shook himself, resumed his real appearance and opened his mouth to devour Pig. This so terrified Pig that he fled as fast as he could into the undergrowth, not caring that brambles and thorns were tearing his head. He sat there trembling and listening out for the sound of the cudgel. When Monkey caught up with him the monster opened his jaws to eat Monkey up too. This was just what Monkey intended. Putting his cudgel away he went straight towards the demon, who swallowed him in a single gulp.</P>
<P>This gave the idiot such a fright as he was hiding in the undergrowth that he grumbled to himself, &#8220;You've got no common sense, Protector of the Horses. Why did you go towards the monster when he wanted to eat you up instead of running away? Now he's swallowed you. Today you're still a monk, but tomorrow you'll be a turd.&#8221; Only when the monster had departed in triumph did Pig emerge from the undergrowth and slip back by the way he had come.</P>
<P>Sanzang and Friar Sand were still waiting for Pig at the foot of the mountain when they saw him come running breathless towards them. &#8220;Pig,&#8221; said Sanzang with horror, &#8220;why are you in this terrible state? Why is Wukong not here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My brother was swallowed up by the evil spirit in a single gulp,&#8221; Pig replied amid sobs, at which Sanzang collapsed in terror. A little later he stamped and beat his chest, saying, &#8220;Disciple, I thought you were good at subduing demons and were going to take me to see the Buddha in the Western Heaven. Who would have thought that you would die at this demon's hand today? Alas! Alas! All the efforts of my disciples have now turned to dust.&#8221; The master was thoroughly miserable.</P>
<P>Just look at the idiot. Instead of coming over to comfort his master he calls, &#8220;Friar Sand, fetch the luggage. Let's split it between us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why, brother?&#8221; Friar Sand asked. &#8220;Divide it up,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;and all of us can go our separate ways. You can go back to the River of Flowing Sand and carry on eating people. I'll go back to Gao Village and see my wife. We can sell the white horse to buy the master a coffin to be buried in.&#8221; The master was so upset when he heard this that he wept aloud to Heaven.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We shall leave them and return to the senior demon chief.</P>
<P>When he had swallowed Monkey he thought he had won, so he went straight back to his cave, where all the other demons came out to ask him how the fight had gone.</P>
<P>&#8220;I've got one of them,&#8221; the senior demon said.</P>
<P>&#8220;Which one is that?&#8221; asked the second demon with delight.</P>
<P>&#8220;Sun the Novice,&#8221; the senior demon replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where have you got him?&#8221; the second demon chief said.</P>
<P>&#8220;In my stomach,&#8221; said the senior demon, &#8220;I swallowed him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Elder brother,&#8221; said the third demon chief with horror, &#8220;I forgot to tell you that Sun the Novice wasn't worth eating.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm delicious,&#8221; said the Great Sage from inside the demon's stomach, &#8220;and I'll stop you from ever feeling hungry again.&#8221;</P>
<P>This caused the junior devils such a shock that they reported, &#8220;This is terrible, Your Senior Majesty. Sun the Novice is talking inside your stomach.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That doesn't frighten me,&#8221; said the senior demon. &#8220;If I'm clever enough to catch him do you think I'm not clever enough to deal with him? Make me some hot salty water at once. I'll pour it into my stomach, vomit him out, and have him fried at my leisure to eat as a snack with some drinks.&#8221;</P>
<P>The junior devils soon had ready half a bowl of hot salty water that the old demon drained in one, filling his mouth. He then really did vomit, but the Great Sage, who had taken root in his stomach, did not even move. The monster then pressed his throat and vomited again till his head was spinning, his eyes in a daze and his gallbladder split, but still Monkey would not be shifted. By now the senior demon was gasping for breath.</P>
<P>&#8220;Sun the Novice,&#8221; he called, &#8220;won't you come out?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;I don't want to come out now.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; the old demon asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;You really don't understand, evil spirit,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Ever since I've been a monk I've had scant food and clothing. Although it's autumn now and getting cool I'm still only wearing a thin tunic. But it's warm in your stomach and there are no drafts down here. I think I'll spend the winter here before coming out.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the evil spirits heard this they all said, &#8220;Your Majesty, Sun the Novice wants to spend the winter in your stomach.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If he wants to spend the winter there I'll take to meditation and use magic to shift him,&#8221; the senior demon said. &#8220;I won't eat anything all winter. The Protector of the Horses will starve to death.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You just don't understand, my boy,&#8221; the Great Sage said. &#8220;I came via Guangzhou when I started escorting the Tang Priest and I've got a folding cooking pan with me that I brought in here to cook myself a mixed grill. I'll take my time enjoying your liver, bowels, stomach and lungs. They'll be enough to keep me going till spring.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said the second demon chief with shock, &#8220;that ape would do it too.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said the third demon, &#8220;perhaps he can eat up some bits and pieces, but I don't know where is he going to set up his pan.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The collar bone is an ideal stand,&#8221; replied Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is terrible,&#8221; said the third demon. &#8220;If he sets up his pan and lights a fire won't the smoke get into your nose and make you sneeze?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That'll be no problem,&#8221; said Monkey with a laugh. &#8220;I'll use my gold-banded cudgel to push a hole through his skull. That'll be a skylight for me and serve as a chimney too.&#8221;</P>
<P>The old demon heard this and was most alarmed despite saying that he was not afraid. All he could do was to summon up his courage and call, &#8220;Don't be scared, brothers. Bring me some of that drugged wine. When I down a few goblets of that the drugs will kill the monkey.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this Monkey smiled to himself and thought, &#8220;When I made havoc in Heaven five hundred years ago I drank the Jade Emperor's wine and ate Lord Lao Zi's elixir, the Queen Mother's peaches, the marrow of phoenix bones and dragon livers. I've eaten everything. What kind of drugged wine could do me any harm?&#8221;</P>
<P>By then the junior devils had strained two jugfuls of drugged wine, a goblet of which they handed to the senior demon chief, who took it in his hands.</P>
<P>Monkey, who could smell it from inside the demon's belly, called out, &#8220;Don't give it to him!&#8221; The splendid Great Sage then tipped his head back and turned it into the bell of a trumpet that he placed wide open below the demon's throat. The demon gulped the wine down noisily and Monkey noisily received it. The demon swallowed the second cupful and Monkey noisily drank that too. This went on till Monkey had drunk all of the seven or eight cupfuls that the demon downed.</P>
<P>&#8220;That's enough,&#8221; the demon said, putting the goblet down. &#8220;Normally my stomach feels as if it's on fire after a couple of cups of this wine,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but this time my face hasn't even gone red after seven or eight.&#8221;</P>
<P>Now the Great Sage was not a heavy drinker, so after taking these seven or eight cupfuls he started to act drunk in the demon's stomach, propping himself up, falling flat on his face, kicking about him, swinging on the demon's liver, doing headstands and somersaults, and dancing wildly. This caused the monster such unbearable pain that he collapsed.</P>
<P>If you don't know whether he lived or died listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>心猿钻透阴阳窍</p>
<p>魔王还归大道真</p>
</div>
<p>却说孙大圣进于洞口，两边观看，只见：骷髅若岭，骸骨如林。人头发躧成毡片，人皮肉烂作泥尘。人筋缠在树上，干焦晃亮如银。真个是尸山血海，果然腥臭难闻。东边小妖，将活人拿了剐肉；西下泼魔，把人肉鲜煮鲜烹。若非美猴王如此英雄胆，第二个凡夫也进不得他门。不多时，行入二层门里看时，呀！这里却比外面不同：清奇幽雅，秀丽宽平；左右有瑶草仙花，前后有乔松翠竹。又行七八里远近，才到三层门。闪着身偷着眼看处，那上面高坐三个老妖，十分狞恶。中间的那个生得：凿牙锯齿，圆头方面。声吼若雷，眼光如电。仰鼻朝天，赤眉飘焰。但行处，百兽心慌；若坐下，群魔胆战。这一个是兽中王，青毛狮子怪。左手下那个生得：凤目金睛，黄牙粗腿。长鼻银毛，看头似尾。圆额皱眉，身躯磊磊。细声如窃窕佳人，玉面似牛头恶鬼。这一个是藏齿修身多年的黄牙老象。右手下那一个生得：金翅鲲头，星睛豹眼。振北图南，刚强勇敢。变生翱翔，鷃笑龙惨。抟风翮百鸟藏头，舒利爪诸禽丧胆。这个是云程九万的大鹏雕。那两下列着有百十大小头目，一个个全装披挂，介胄整齐，威风凛凛，杀气腾腾。行者见了，心中欢喜，一些儿不怕，大踏步径直进门，把梆铃卸下，朝上叫声“大王。”三个老魔，笑呵呵问道：“小钻风，你来了？”行者应声道：“来了。”你去巡山，打听孙行者的下落何如？”行者道：“大王在上，我也不敢说起。”老魔道：“怎么不敢说？”行者道：“我奉大王命，敲着梆铃，正然走处，猛抬头只看见一个人，蹲在那里磨扛子，还象个开路神，若站将起来，足有十数丈长短。他就着那涧崖石上，抄一把水，磨一磨，口里又念一声，说他那扛子到此还不曾显个神通，他要磨明，就来打大王。我因此知他是孙行者，特来报知。”那老魔闻此言，浑身是汗，唬得战呵呵的道：“兄弟，我说莫惹唐僧。他徒弟神通广大，预先作了准备，磨棍打我们，却怎生是好？”教：“小的们，把洞外大小俱叫进来，关了门，让他过去罢。”那头目中有知道的报：“大王，门外小妖，已都散了。”老魔道：“怎么都散了？想是闻得风声不好也，快早关门！快早关门！”众妖乒乓把前后门尽皆牢拴紧闭。行者自心惊道：“这一关了门，他再问我家长里短的事，我对不来，却不弄走了风，被他拿住？且再唬他一唬，教他开着门，好跑。”又上前道：“大王，他还说得不好。”老魔道：“他又说甚么？”行者道：“他说拿大大王剥皮，二大王剐骨，三大王抽筋。你们若关了门不出去啊，他会变化，一时变了个苍蝇儿，自门缝里飞进，把我们都拿出去，却怎生是好？”老魔道：“兄弟们仔细，我这洞里，递年家没个苍蝇，但是有苍蝇进来，就是孙行者。”行者暗笑道：“就变个苍蝇唬他一唬，好开门。”大圣闪在旁边，伸手去脑后拔了一根毫毛，吹一口仙气，叫“变！”即变做一个金苍蝇，飞去望老魔劈脸撞了一头。那老怪慌了道：“兄弟！不停当！那话儿进门来了！”</p>

<p>惊得那大小群妖，一个个丫钯扫帚，都上前乱扑苍蝇。这大圣忍不住，赥赥的笑出声来。干净他不宜笑，这一笑笑出原嘴脸来了，却被那第三个老妖魔跳上前，一把扯住道：“哥哥，险些儿被他瞒了！”老魔道：“贤弟，谁瞒谁？”三怪道：“刚才这个回话的小妖，不是小钻风，他就是孙行者。必定撞见小钻风，不知是他怎么打杀了，却变化来哄我们哩。”行者慌了道：“他认得我了！”即把手摸摸，对老怪道：“我怎么是孙行者？我是小钻风，大王错认了。”老魔笑道：“兄弟，他是小钻风。他一日三次在面前点卯，我认得他。”又问：“你有牌儿么？”行者道：“有。”</p>

<p>掳着衣服，就拿出牌子。老怪一发认实道：“兄弟，莫屈了他。”</p>

<p>三怪道：“哥哥，你不曾看见他，他才子闪着身，笑了一声，我见他就露出个雷公嘴来。见我扯住时，他又变作个这等模样。”</p>

<p>叫：“小的们，拿绳来！”众头目即取绳索。三怪把行者扳翻倒，四马攒蹄捆住，揭起衣裳看时，足足是个弼马温。原来行者有七十二般变化，若是变飞禽、走兽、花木、器皿、昆虫之类，却就连身子滚去了；但变人物，却只是头脸变了，身子变不过来，果然一身黄毛，两块红股，一条尾巴。老妖看着道：“是孙行者的身子，小钻风的脸皮，是他了！”教：“小的们，先安排酒来，与你三大王递个得功之杯。既拿倒了孙行者，唐僧坐定是我们口里食也。”三怪道：“且不要吃酒。孙行者溜撒，他会逃遁之法，只怕走了。教小的们抬出瓶来，把孙行者装在瓶里，我们才好吃酒。”老魔大笑道：“正是！正是！”即点三十六个小妖，入里面开了库房门，抬出瓶来。你说那瓶有多大？只得二尺四寸高。怎么用得三十六个人抬？那瓶乃阴阳二气之宝，内有七宝八卦、二十四气，要三十六人，按天罡之数，才抬得动。不一时，将宝瓶抬出，放在三层门外，展得干净，揭开盖，把行者解了绳索，剥了衣服，就着那瓶中仙气，飕的一声，吸入里面，将盖子盖上，贴了封皮，却去吃酒道：“猴儿今番入我宝瓶之中，再莫想那西方之路！若还能彀拜佛求经，除是转背摇车，再去投胎夺舍是。”你看那大小群妖，一个个笑呵呵都去贺功不题。</p>

<p>却说大圣到了瓶中，被那宝贝将身束得小了，索性变化，蹲在当中。半晌，倒还荫凉，忽失声笑道：“这妖精外有虚名，内无实事。怎么告诵人说这瓶装了人，一时三刻，化为脓血？若似这般凉快，就住上七八年也无事！”咦！大圣原来不知那宝贝根由：假若装了人，一年不语，一年荫凉，但闻得人言，就有火来烧了。大圣未曾说完，只见满瓶都是火焰。幸得他有本事，坐在中间，捻着避火诀，全然不惧。耐到半个时辰，四周围钻出四十条蛇来咬。行者轮开手，抓将过来，尽力气一揝，揝做八十段。少时间，又有三条火龙出来，把行者上下盘绕，着实难禁，自觉慌张无措道：“别事好处，这三条火龙难为。再过一会不出，弄得火气攻心，怎了？”他想道：“我把身子长一长，券破罢。”好大圣，捻着诀，念声咒，叫“长！”即长了丈数高下，那瓶紧靠着身，也就长起去，他把身子往下一小，那瓶儿也就小下来了。行者心惊道：“难！难！难！怎么我长他也长，我小他也小？如之奈何！”说不了，孤拐上有些疼痛，急伸手摸摸，却被火烧软了，自己心焦道：“怎么好？孤拐烧软了！弄做个残疾之人了！”忍不住吊下泪来，这正是：遭魔遇苦怀三藏，着难临危虑圣僧，道：“师父啊！当年皈正，蒙观音菩萨劝善，脱离天灾，我与你苦历诸山，收殄多怪，降八戒，得沙僧，千辛万苦，指望同证西方，共成正果。何期今日遭此毒魔，老孙误入于此，倾了性命，撇你在半山之中，不能前进！想是我昔日名高，故有今朝之难！”正此凄怆，忽想起菩萨当年在蛇盘山曾赐我三根救命毫毛，不知有无，且等我寻一寻看。即伸手浑身摸了一把，只见脑后有三根毫毛，十分挺硬，忽喜道：“身上毛都如彼软熟，只此三根如此硬枪，必然是救我命的。”即便咬着牙，忍着疼，拔下毛，吹口仙气，叫“变！”一根即变作金钢钻，一根变作竹片，一根变作绵绳。扳张篾片弓儿，牵着那钻，照瓶底下飕飕的一顿钻，钻成一个眼孔，诱进光亮，喜道：“造化！造化！却好出去也！”才变化出身，那瓶复荫凉了。怎么就凉？原来被他钻了，把阴阳之气泄了，故此遂凉。</p>

<p>好大圣，收了毫毛，将身一小，就变做个蟭蟟虫儿，十分轻巧，细如须发，长似眉毛，自孔中钻出，且还不走，径飞在老魔头上钉着。那老魔正饮酒，猛然放下杯儿道：“三弟，孙行者这回化了么？”三魔笑道：“还到此时哩？”老魔教传令抬上瓶来。</p>

<p>那下面三十六个小妖即便抬瓶，瓶就轻了许多，慌得众小妖报道：“大王，瓶轻了！”老魔喝道：“胡说！宝贝乃阴阳二气之全功，如何轻了！”内中有一个勉强的小妖，把瓶提上来道：“你看这不轻了？”老魔揭盖看时，只见里面透亮，忍不住失声叫道：</p>

<p>“这瓶里空者，控也！”大圣在他头上，也忍不住道一声“我的儿啊，搜者，走也！”众怪听见道：“走了走了！”即传令：“关门关门！”</p>

<p>那行者将身一抖，收了剥去的衣服，现本相，跳出洞外。回头骂道：“妖精不要无礼！瓶子钻破，装不得人了，只好拿了出恭！”喜喜欢欢，嚷嚷闹闹，踏着云头，径转唐僧处。那长老正在那里撮土为香，望空祷祝，行者且停云头，听他祷祝甚的。那长老合掌朝天道：“祈请云霞众位仙，六丁六甲与诸天。愿保贤徒孙行者，神通广大法无边。”大圣听得这般言语，更加努力，收敛云光，近前叫道：“师父，我来了！”长老搀住道：“悟空劳碌，你远探高山，许久不回，我甚忧虑。端的这山中有何吉凶？”行者笑道：“师父，才这一去，一则是东土众僧有缘有分，二来是师父功德无量无边，三也亏弟子法力！”将前项妆钻风、陷瓶里及脱身之事，细陈了一遍，“今得见尊师之面，实为两世之人也！”长老感谢不尽道：“你这番不曾与妖精赌斗么？”行者道：</p>

<p>“不曾。”长老道：“这等保不得我过山了？”行者是个好胜的人，叫喊道：“我怎么保你过山不得？”长老道：“不曾与他见个胜负，只这般含糊，我怎敢前进！”大圣笑道：“师父，你也忒不通变。常言道，单丝不线，孤掌难鸣。那魔三个，小妖千万，教老孙一人，怎生与他赌斗？”长老道：“寡不敌众，是你一人也难处。八戒、沙僧他也都有本事，教他们都去，与你协力同心，扫净山路，保我过去罢。”行者沉吟道：“师言最当，着沙僧保护你，着八戒跟我去罢。“那呆子慌了道：“哥哥没眼色！我又粗夯，无甚本事，走路扛风，跟你何益？”行者道：“兄弟，你虽无甚本事，好道也是个人。俗云放屁添风，你也可壮我些胆气。”八戒道：“也罢也罢，望你带挈带挈。但只急溜处，莫捉弄我。”长老道：“八戒在意，我与沙僧在此。”</p>

<p>那呆子抖擞神威，与行者纵着狂风，驾着云雾，跳上高山，即至洞口，早见那洞门紧闭，四顾无人。行者上前，执铁棒，厉声高叫道：“妖怪开门！快出来与老孙打耶！”那洞里小妖报入，老魔心惊胆战道：“几年都说猴儿狠，话不虚传果是真！”二老怪在旁问道：“哥哥怎么说？”老魔道：“那行者早间变小钻风混进来，我等不能相识。幸三贤弟认得，把他装在瓶里。他弄本事，钻破瓶儿，却又摄去衣服走了。如今在外叫战，谁敢与他打个头仗？”更无一人答应，又问又无人答，都是那装聋推哑。老魔发怒道：“我等在西方大路上，忝着个丑名，今日孙行者这般藐视，若不出去与他见阵，也低了名头。等我舍了这老性命去与他战上三合！三合战得过，唐僧还是我们口里食；战不过，那时关了门，让他过去罢。”遂取披挂结束了，开门前走。</p>

<p>行者与八戒在门旁观看，真是好一个怪物：铁额铜头戴宝盔，盔缨飘舞甚光辉。辉辉掣电双睛亮，亮亮铺霞两鬓飞。勾爪如银尖且利，锯牙似凿密还齐。身披金甲无丝缝，腰束龙绦有见机。手执钢刀明晃晃，英雄威武世间稀。一声吆喝如雷震，问道“敲门者是谁？”大圣转身道：是你孙老爷齐天大圣也。”老魔笑道：“你是孙行者？大胆泼猴！我不惹你，你却为何在此叫战？”行者道：“有风方起浪，无潮水自平。你不惹我，我好寻你？</p>

<p>只因你狐群狗党，结为一伙，算计吃我师父，所以来此施为。”</p>

<p>老魔道：“你这等雄纠纠的，嚷上我门，莫不是要打么？”行者道：“正是。”老魔道：“你休猖獗！我若调出妖兵，摆开阵势，摇旗擂鼓，与你交战，显得我是坐家虎，欺负你了。我只与你一个对一个，不许帮丁！”行者闻言叫：“猪八戒走过，看他把老孙怎的！”那呆子真个闪在一边。老魔道：“你过来，先与我做个桩儿，让我尽力气着光头砍上三刀，就让你唐僧过去；假若禁不得，快送你唐僧来，与我做一顿下饭！”行者闻言笑道：“妖怪，你洞里若有纸笔，取出来，与你立个合同。自今日起，就砍到明年，我也不与你当真！”那老魔抖擞威风，丁字步站定，双手举刀，望大圣劈顶就砍。这大圣把头往上一迎，只闻扢扠一声响，头皮儿红也不红。那老魔大惊道：“这猴子好个硬头儿！”大圣笑道：“你不知，老孙是：生就铜头铁脑盖，天地乾坤世上无。斧砍锤敲不得碎，幼年曾入老君炉。四斗星官监临适，二十八宿用工夫。水浸几番不得坏，周围扢搭板筋铺。唐僧还恐不坚固，预先又上紫金箍。”老魔道：“猴儿不要说嘴！看我这二刀来，决不容你性命！”行者道：“不见怎的，左右也只这般砍罢了。”老魔道：“猴儿，你不知这刀：金火炉中造，神功百炼熬。锋刃依三略，刚强按六韬。却似苍蝇尾，犹如白蟒腰。入山云荡荡，下海浪滔滔。琢磨无遍数，煎熬几百遭。深山古洞放，上阵有功劳。</p>

<p>搀着你这和尚天灵盖，一削就是两个瓢！”大圣笑道：“这妖精没眼色！把老孙认做个瓢头哩！也罢，误砍误让，教你再砍一刀看怎么。”那老魔举刀又砍，大圣把头迎一迎，乒乓的劈做两半个；大圣就地打个滚，变做两个身子。那妖一见慌了，手按下钢刀。猪八戒远远望见，笑道：“老魔好砍两刀的！却不是四个人了？”老魔指定行者道：“闻你能使分身法，怎么把这法儿拿出在我面前使！”大圣道：“何为分身法？”老魔道：“为甚么先砍你一刀不动，如今砍你一刀，就是两个人？”大圣笑道：“妖怪，你切莫害怕。砍上一万刀，还你二万个人！”老魔道：“你这猴儿，你只会分身，不会收身。你若有本事收做一个，打我一棍去罢。”大圣道：“不许说谎，你要砍三刀，只砍了我两刀；教我打一棍，若打了棍半，就不姓孙！”老魔道：“正是，正是。”</p>

<p>好大圣，就把身搂上来，打个滚，依然一个身子，掣棒劈头就打，那老魔举刀架住道：“泼猴无礼！甚么样个哭丧棒，敢上门打人？”大圣喝道：“你若问我这条棍，天上地下，都有名声。”</p>

<p>老魔道：“怎见名声？”他道：“棒是九转镔铁炼，老君亲手炉中煅。禹王求得号神珍，四海八河为定验。中间星斗暗铺陈，两头箝裹黄金片。花纹密布鬼神惊，上造龙纹与凤篆。名号灵阳棒一条，深藏海藏人难见。成形变化要飞腾，飘飖五色霞光现。</p>

<p>老孙得道取归山，无穷变化多经验。时间要大瓮来粗，或小些微如铁线。粗如南岳细如针，长短随吾心意变。轻轻举动彩云生，亮亮飞腾如闪电。攸攸冷气逼人寒，条条杀雾空中现。降龙伏虎谨随身，天涯海角都游遍。曾将此棍闹天宫，威风打散蟠桃宴。天王赌斗未曾赢，哪吒对敌难交战。棍打诸神没躲藏，天兵十万都逃窜。雷霆众将护灵霄，飞身打上通明殿。掌朝天使尽皆惊，护驾仙卿俱搅乱。举棒掀翻北斗宫，回首振开南极院。金阙天皇见棍凶，特请如来与我见。兵家胜负自如然，困苦灾危无可辨。整整挨排五百年，亏了南海菩萨劝。大唐有个出家僧，对天发下洪誓愿。枉死城中度鬼魂，灵山会上求经卷。</p>

<p>西方一路有妖魔，行动甚是不方便。已知铁棒世无双，央我途中为侣伴。邪魔汤着赴幽冥，肉化红尘骨化面。处处妖精棒下亡，论万成千无打算。上方击坏斗牛宫，下方压损森罗殿。天将曾将九曜追，地府打伤催命判。半空丢下振山川，胜如太岁新华剑。全凭此棍保唐僧，天下妖魔都打遍！”</p>

<p>那魔闻言，战兢兢舍着性命，举刀就砍。猴王笑吟吟使铁棒前迎。他两个先时在洞前撑持，然后跳起去，都在半空里厮杀。这一场好杀：天河定底神珍棒，棒名如意世间高。夸称手段魔头恼，大捍刀擎法力豪。门外争持还可近，空中赌斗怎相饶！一个随心更面目，一个立地长身腰。杀得满天云气重，遍野雾飘飘。那一个几番立意吃三藏，这一个广施法力保唐朝。</p>

<p>都因佛祖传经典，邪正分明恨苦交。那老魔与大圣斗经二十余合，不分输赢。原来八戒在底下见他两个战到好处，忍不住掣钯架风，跳将起去，望妖魔劈脸就筑。那魔慌了，不知八戒是个呼头性子，冒冒失失的唬人，他只道嘴长耳大，手硬钯凶，败了阵，丢了刀，回头就走。大圣喝道：“赶上！赶上！”这呆子仗着威风，举着钉钯，即忙赶下怪去。老魔见他赶的相近，在坡前立定，迎着风头，幌一幌现了原身，张开大口，就要来吞八戒。八戒害怕，急抽身往草里一钻，也管不得荆针棘刺，也顾不得刮破头疼，战兢兢的，在草里听着梆声。随后行者赶到，那怪也张口来吞，却中了他的机关，收了铁棒，迎将上去，被老魔一口吞之。唬得个呆子在草里囊囊咄咄的埋怨道：“这个弼马温，不识进退！那怪来吃你，你如何不走，反去迎他！这一口吞在肚中，今日还是个和尚，明日就是个大恭也！”那魔得胜而去。这呆子才钻出草来，溜回旧路。</p>

<p>却说三藏在那山坡下，正与沙僧盼望，只见八戒喘呵呵的跑来。三藏大惊道：“八戒，你怎么这等狼狈？悟空如何不见？”</p>

<p>呆子哭哭啼啼道：“师兄被妖精一口吞下肚去了！”三藏听言，唬倒在地，半晌间跌脚拳胸道：“徒弟呀！只说你善会降妖，领我西天见佛，怎知今日死于此怪之手！苦哉，苦哉！我弟子同众的功劳，如今都化作尘土矣！’那师父十分苦痛。你看那呆子，他也不来劝解师父，却叫：“沙和尚，你拿将行李来，我两个分了罢。”沙僧道：“二哥，分怎的？”八戒道：”分开了，各人散火：你往流沙河，还去吃人；我往高老庄，看看我浑家。将白马卖了，与师父买个寿器送终。”长老气呼呼的，闻得此言，叫皇天，放声大哭。且不题。</p>

<p>却说那老魔吞了行者，以为得计，径回本洞。众妖迎问出战之功，老魔道：“拿了一个来了。”二魔喜道：“哥哥拿的是谁？”老魔道：“是孙行者。”二魔道：“拿在何处？”老魔道：“被我一口吞在腹中哩。”第三个魔头大惊道：“大哥啊，我就不曾吩咐你，孙行者不中吃！”那大圣肚里道：“忒中吃！又禁饥，再不得饿”慌得那小妖道：“大王，不好了！孙行者在你肚里说话哩！”老魔道：“怕他说话！有本事吃了他，没本事摆布他不成？</p>

<p>你们快去烧些盐白汤，等我灌下肚去，把他哕出来，慢慢的煎了吃酒。”小妖真个冲了半盆盐汤。老怪一饮而干，洼着口，着实一呕，那大圣在肚里生了根，动也不动，却又拦着喉咙，往外又吐，吐得头晕眼花，黄胆都破了，行者越发不动。老魔喘息了，叫声：“孙行者，你不出来？”行者道：“早哩！正好不出来哩！”老魔道：“你怎么不出？”行者道：“你这妖精，甚不通变。我自做和尚，十分淡薄：如今秋凉，我还穿个单直裰。这肚里倒暖，又不透风，等我住过冬才好出来。”众妖听说，都道：“大王，孙行者要在你肚里过冬哩！”老魔道：“他要过冬，我就打起禅来，使个搬运法，一冬不吃饭，就饿杀那弼马温！”大圣道：“我儿子，你不知事！老孙保唐僧取经，从广里过，带了个折迭锅儿，进来煮杂碎吃。将你这里边的肝肠肚肺细细儿受用，还彀盘缠到清明哩！”那二魔大惊道：“哥啊，这猴子他干得出来！”</p>

<p>三魔道：“哥啊，吃了杂碎也罢，不知在那里支锅。”行者道：“三叉骨上好支锅。”三魔道：“不好了！假若支起锅，烧动火烟，煼到鼻孔里，打嚏喷么？”行者笑道：“没事！等老孙把金箍棒往顶门里一搠，搠个窟窿：一则当天窗，二来当烟洞。”老魔听说，虽说不怕，却也心惊，只得硬着胆叫：“兄弟们，莫怕，把我那药酒拿来，等我吃几锺下去，把猴儿药杀了罢！”行者暗笑道：“老孙五百年前大闹天宫时，吃老君丹，玉皇酒，王母桃，及凤髓龙肝，那样东西我不曾吃过？是甚么药酒，敢来药我？”那小妖真个将药酒筛了两壶，满满斟了一锺，递与老魔。老魔接在手中，大圣在肚里就闻得酒香，道：“不要与他吃！”好大圣，把头一扭，变做个喇叭口子，张在他喉咙之下。那怪啯的咽下，被行者啯的接吃了。第二锺咽下，被行者啯的又接吃了。一连咽了七八锺，都是他接吃了。老魔放下锺道：“不吃了，这酒常时吃两锺，腹中如火，却才吃了七八锺，脸上红也不红！”原来这大圣吃不多酒，接了他七八锺吃了，在肚里撒起酒风来，不住的支架子，跌四平，踢飞脚，抓住肝花打秋千，竖蜻艇，翻根头乱舞。</p>

<p>那怪物疼痛难禁，倒在地下。毕竟不知死活如何，且听下回分解。</p>
