<P>Two Monks Wipe out the Demons in the Dragon Palace</P>
<P>The Sages Destroy Evil and Recover the Treasure</P>
</div>
<P>The story tells how the king of Jisai and his officials high and low watched as the Great Sage Monkey and Pig disappeared by wind and cloud, carrying the two demons with them. Then all of them bowed in homage to heaven, saying, &#8220;Their fame is well founded. Only today can we really believe that such immortals and living Buddhas exist.&#8221; As Monkey and Pig vanished into the distance the king bowed again to thank Sanzang and Friar Sand.</P>
<P>&#8220;Our mortal eyes were only able to see that your illustrious disciples had the power to capture thieving devils. We never realized that you were superior immortals with the power to ride on winds and clouds.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I do not have any dharma powers,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;On my journey I have depended very much on my three disciples.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I tell you the truth, Your Majesty,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;My senior fellow-disciple is the Great Sage Equaling Heaven who has been converted. He once made havoc in Heaven, and none of the hundred thousand heavenly troops was a match for his gold-banded cudgel. He had the Supreme Lord Lao Zi and the Jade Emperor both scared. My next senior fellow-disciple is Marshal Tian Peng, now a faithful Buddhist. He once commanded 80,000 sailors on the River of Heaven. I'm the only one of us with no magic powers: I was the Curtain-lifting General before I took my vows. We're useless at everything except capturing demons and monsters, arresting thieves and runaways, subduing tigers and dragons, and kicking the sky into a well. And we know a thing or two about stirring up the sea and turning rivers upside-down. Oh yes, and then there's riding clouds and mists, summoning wind and rain, moving the stars around in the sky, carrying mountains, and chasing the moon: but those are just extras.&#8221; All this made the king treat them with very great respect Indeed:</P>
<P>Inviting Sanzang to take the place of honour, he kept addressing him as &#8220;Buddha&#8221; and referring to Friar Sand and the others as bodhisattvas. All the civil and military officials were delighted, and the citizens of the country kowtowed to them.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story switches to the Great Sage Monkey and Pig riding their storm wind to the Green Wave Pool on the Ragged Rock Mountain, where they stopped their clouds.</P>
<P>Blowing a magic breath on his gold-banded cudgel Wukong told it to change and turned it into a monk's knife with which he cut an ear off the snakehead and the lower lip of the catfish, then threw the two demons into the water with a shout of, &#8220;Tell the Infinitely Sage Dragon King that Lord Sun, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven, is here. If he wants me to spare the lives of him and his family he'd better hand over the treasure from the pagoda of the Golden Light Monastery in Jisai at once. If there's even the hint of a 'no' from him I'll give this pool such a stirring that there'll be no water left in it and then exterminate his whole family.&#8221;</P>
<P>Having been given this order the two little devils fled for their lives in great pain, jumping into the water, chains, ropes and all, to the alarm of the various turtle, alligator, shrimp, crab and fish spirits, who crowded round them to ask, &#8220;Why are you roped and chained?&#8221;</P>
<P>Once of them shook his head and waved his tail with his hand over his ear; the other stamped and beat his chest as he covered his mouth. There was much shouting and commotion as they both went to the dragon king's palace to report, &#8220;Disaster, Your Majesty.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Infinitely Sage Dragon King was drinking with his son-in-law Prince Ninehead when the two of them arrived. &#8220;What disaster?&#8221; the dragon king asked, putting down his cup.</P>
<P>&#8220;We were on sentry duty last night,&#8221; they reported, &#8220;when the Tang Priest and Sun the Novice captured us as they were sweeping the pagoda. We were chained up and taken to see the king this morning. Then Sun the Novice and Pig dragged us here. One of us had an ear cut off and the other a lip. Then they threw us into the water to come to ask for the treasure from the top of the pagoda.&#8221; They then told the whole story in great detail. The news about Sun the Novice, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven, gave the ancient dragon such a fright that his souls left his body and were scattered beyond the sky.</P>
<P>&#8220;Son-in-law,&#8221; he said to the prince, shivering and shaking, &#8220;anyone else would have been easy enough to deal with; but if it's him it's terrible.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Relax, father-in-law,&#8221; the prince replied. &#8220;I've been studying the martial arts since childhood and made friends with quite a few of the world's heroes. He's nothing to be scared of. After three rounds with me I guarantee the wretch will surrender with his head hanging so low he won't even dare look you in the face.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid demon jumped to his feet, put on his armor, took the weapon he used, a crescent-bladed halberd, walked out of the palace, parted the waters, and when he reached the surface called out, &#8220;What's all this about a 'Great Sage Equaling Heaven'? Come and give yourself up at once.&#8221; Standing on the bank, Pig and Monkey saw how the evil spirit was dressed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A silver helmet on his head,</P>
<P>Outshone the whitest snow;</P>
<P>The suit of armor that he wore</P>
<P>Was higher than autumn frost.</P>
<P>Over it was a battle-robe of brocade,</P>
<P>With dragons, cloud-patterns and pearls;</P>
<P>The rhinoceros-patterned belt at his waist</P>
<P>Was like a python wrapped in gold.</P>
<P>He held a crescent halberd</P>
<P>That flew and flashed like lightning;</P>
<P>The pigskin boots on his feet</P>
<P>Moved as smoothly as water or waves.</P>
<P>From a distance he seemed to have only one face and head,</P>
<P>But seen from close to there were faces all around him:</P>
<P>Eyes in front and eyes behind</P>
<P>That could see in all directions;</P>
<P>Mouths to the left and mouths to the right,</P>
<P>Nine of them, all talking.</P>
<P>One shout from him would make the sky shake</P>
<P>Like the call of the crane resounding through the stars.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As nobody answered he shouted again, &#8220;Which of you is the Great Sage Equaling Heaven?&#8221;</P>
<P>Touching the golden band round his head and fingering his iron cudgel, Monkey replied, &#8220;I am.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where do you live?&#8221; the demon asked. &#8220;Where are you from? What brought you to Jisai to look after the king's pagoda? Why did you have the effrontery to capture and mutilate two of our officers? And why are you here demanding battle now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Thieving devil,&#8221; replied Monkey abusively, &#8220;it's obvious you don't know who I am. Come a little closer and I'll tell you:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>My people come from the Mount of Flowers and Fruit,</P>
<P>From the Water Curtain Cave in the middle of the sea.</P>
<P>Since childhood I have made my body indestructible;</P>
<P>The Jade Emperor created me Heaven-equaling Sage.</P>
<P>When I made havoc in the Dipper and Bull Palace</P>
<P>All the gods of Heaven were not enough to beat me.</P>
<P>The Buddha then was asked to use his great and subtle powers;</P>
<P>His infinite wisdom went beyond the mortal world.</P>
<P>When I matched my powers with his and made my somersaults</P>
<P>His hand turned to a mountain and crushed me underneath.</P>
<P>There I was kept for full five hundred years,</P>
<P>And only was released when converted by Guanyin</P>
<P>Because Sanzang was going to the Western Heaven</P>
<P>To seek the Buddha's words at distant Vulture Peak.</P>
<P>She freed me then to escort the holy monk,</P>
<P>To clear up all the monsters and purify my conduct.</P>
<P>Our journey led to Jisai in the regions of the West</P>
<P>Where there monkish generations have been cruelly mistreated.</P>
<P>When in our mercy we asked them what had happened</P>
<P>We learned that the pagoda no longer shone with light.</P>
<P>My master swept it clean to find out the reason.</P>
<P>In the deep silence of the night's third watch,</P>
<P>We captured the demons and extracted their confessions:</P>
<P>They said you were the thief who had stolen the great treasure,</P>
<P>Conspiring to be a robber with the ancient dragon king</P>
<P>And the princess who is also known as Infinitely Sage.</P>
<P>Your rain of blood washed out the pagoda's magic light</P>
<P>And you brought the treasure back to use it here yourselves.</P>
<P>The confession that they made was true in every detail,</P>
<P>And we have come here now on His Majesty's own orders.</P>
<P>That is why we looked for you and challenge you to battle:</P>
<P>Never will you need to ask my name again.</P>
<P>Give the king back his treasure this instant</P>
<P>If you want to save the lives of all members of your family.</P>
<P>Should you in your folly try to make resistance</P>
<P>Your pool will be dried out and your palace smashed to ruins.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the prince heard all this he replied with a touch of a mocking smile, &#8220;If you're monks going to fetch the scriptures you shouldn't be trumping up charges where it's none of your business. So what if I stole their treasure? You're going to fetch your Buddhist scriptures and it's nothing to do with you. Why are you here looking for a fight?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Thieving devil,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you've got no idea of right and wrong. The king's done us no favours. We don't drink his kingdom's waters or eat its grain. We were under no obligation to do thing for him. But you have stolen his treasure, contaminated his pagoda, and brought years of misery to the monks in the Golden Light Monastery. They are our fellow believers, so of course we'll make an effort for them and right their wrong.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So it looks as though you want a fight,&#8221; said the prince. &#8220;As the saying goes, the warrior avoids unnecessary combat; but once I start there'll be no mercy, you'll be dead in next to no time, and that will be the end of going to fetch the scriptures.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Bloody thieving devil,&#8221; Monkey cursed back, &#8220;you must think you're quite a fighter, talking big like that. Come here and take this!&#8221; The prince was not flustered in the least as he blocked the cudgel with his crescent-bladed halberd. A fine battle ensued on the Ragged Rock Mountain.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Because the monster stole the treasure the pagoda was dark;</P>
<P>Monkey went to catch the demons for the sake of the king;</P>
<P>The little devils fled for their lives back into the water;</P>
<P>The ancient dragon took counsel in his terror.</P>
<P>Prince Ninehead showed his might</P>
<P>As he went out in armor to exercise his powers.</P>
<P>The angry Great Sage Equaling Heaven</P>
<P>Raised his gold-banded cudgel that was very hard Indeed:</P>
<P>In the monster's mine heads were eighteen eyes</P>
<P>Shining bright as they looked in all directions.</P>
<P>Monkey's iron arms were immensely strong</P>
<P>And auspicious lights glowed all around.</P>
<P>The halberd was like a new moon's crescent,</P>
<P>The cudgel like flying frost.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why don't you give up trying to right wrongs?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You were wrong to steal the pagoda's treasure.</P>
<P>Behave yourself, damned devil,</P>
<P>And give me back the treasure if you want to live.&#8221;</P>
<P>Cudgel and halberd fought for mastery:</P>
<P>Neither emerged as victor in the fight.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The two of them fought hard for over thirty rounds without either of them emerging as winner. Pig, who was standing on the mountain admiring the sweetness and beauty of their fight, raised his rake and brought down on the evil spirit from behind, Now the monster's nine heads all had eyes in them, and he could see Pig coming behind him very clearly, so he now used the butt-end of his halberd to block the rake while holding off the cudgel with the blade. He resisted for another six or seven rounds until he could hold out no longer against the weapons that were swinging at him from before and behind, when he rolled away and leapt up into the sky in his true form as a nine-headed bird. He looked thoroughly repulsive: the sight of him was enough to kill one with horror:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>His body all covered in feathers and down,</P>
<P>His girth was some twelve feet measured around,</P>
<P>And he was as long as an old crocodile.</P>
<P>His two feet were as sharp as book-shaped blades,</P>
<P>And his nine heads were all set in a circle.</P>
<P>When he opened his wings he could fly superbly:</P>
<P>Not even the roc could match his great strength.</P>
<P>His voice could resound to the edge of the sky,</P>
<P>With an echo even louder than the call of the crane.</P>
<P>Bright flashed golden light from his many pairs of eyes;</P>
<P>His pride far outstripped that of ordinary birds.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The sight alarmed Pig, who said, &#8220;Brother, I've never seen anything as ugly in all my days. What sort of blood could that monstrous bird have been born of?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's nothing like him,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;nothing. I'm going up to kill him.&#8221; The splendid Great Sage then leapt up on his cloud into mid-air, where he struck at the monster's head with his cudgel. The monster now displayed the power of his body as he swooped down, his wings outspread, then turned with a roaring noise to come low over the mountain and shoot out from his waist another head with a mouth open wide like a bowl of blood. His beak gripped Pig's bristles at the first attempt, then he dragged Pig to the pool and pulled him in.</P>
<P>Once back outside the dragon palace he turned himself back into what he had been before, threw Pig to the ground, and said, &#8220;Where are you, little ones?&#8221;</P>
<P>Thereupon the mackerel, trout, carp, mandarin fish, hard and soft-shelled tortoises, and alligators, who were all armored demons, rushed forward with a shout of, &#8220;Here!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Take this monk and tie him up for me,&#8221; said the prince. &#8220;This will be revenge for our patrolling sentries.&#8221; Shouting and pushing, the spirits carried Pig inside, to the delight of the ancient dragon king, who came out to meet the prince with the words, &#8220;Congratulations, son-in-law. How did you catch him?&#8221; The prince then told him the whole story, after which the ancient dragon ordered a celebratory banquet, which we need not describe.</P>
<P>Instead the story tells how Monkey thought in terror after the evil spirit had captured Pig, &#8220;This monster is terrible. But if I go back to the court to see the master the king will probably laugh at me. But if I challenge him to battle again how will I deal with him single-handed? Besides, I'm not used to coping in water. I'll just have to turn myself into something to get inside and see what the evil spirit has done with Pig. If it's possible I'll sneak him out of there to help me.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage then made magic with his fingers, shook himself, turned into a crab again, and plunged into the water till he was outside the archway again. He knew the way from when he had come here the previous time and stolen the Bull King's water-averting golden-eyed beast. When he reached the gateway to the palace he walked in sideways to see the ancient dragon king, the nine-headed monster and their whole family drinking together to celebrate. Not daring to go too close. Monkey crawled under the eaves of the Eastern verandah, where several shrimp and crab spirits were fooling around and amusing themselves. He listened to them for a while then said, imitating their way of talking, &#8220;Is the long-snouted monk the prince brought here dead or alive?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He's alive,&#8221; the spirits all replied, &#8220;and tied up. Can't you see him groaning under the Western verandah over there?&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey then crawled quietly over to the Western verandah, where he did indeed find Pig tied to a column and groaning. &#8220;Can you recognize me, Pig?&#8221; he asked. Pig knew who it was from Monkey's voice.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is terrible, brother,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The monster got me.&#8221; Looking all around to make sure there was nobody there Monkey cut through the ropes with his claws and told Pig to go. &#8220;What am I to do, brother?&#8221; Pig said. &#8220;He's got my rake.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do you know where he put it?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I think he must have taken it into the main hall of the palace,&#8221; Pig replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wait for me under the arch,&#8221; said Monkey, and Pig slipped quietly out to save his skin. Monkey climbed up on the roof of the main hall, from where he saw the intense glow of Pig's rake down on the left, made himself invisible, and sneaked it out of the palace. Once under the archway he called, &#8220;Pig, take your weapon.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You go on ahead, brother,&#8221; said Pig, now reunited with his rake. &#8220;I'm going to attack that palace. If I win I'll capture the whole family of them, and if I lose you'll be waiting by the bank to rescue me.&#8221; Monkey, who was delighted at the suggestion, urged him to be careful. &#8220;I'm not scared of him,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;I know a thing or two when it comes to water.&#8221; Monkey then left him and came up through the water.</P>
<P>Pig meanwhile tightened the belt round his black tunic, grasped his rake with both hands, and charged in with a great war-cry that sent all the members of the watery tribe rushing into the palace and shouting, &#8220;Disaster! The long-snouted monk has broken free from his bonds and is charging back in.&#8221; The ancient dragon king, the nine-headed monster and the rest of the family were caught off their guard, and all they could do was jump to their feet and flee for cover. The idiot, not fearing for his life, charged into the hall, laying about him with his rake as he went. He smashed everything: doors, tables, chairs, wine-cups and all else too. There is a poem to prove it that goes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the mother of wood was taken by the water monster</P>
<P>The mind-ape did not flinch from a difficult rescue.</P>
<P>One used his secret skills to open the locks;</P>
<P>The other one showed his might in hatred and wrath.</P>
<P>The prince fled, taking his princess to safety;</P>
<P>Not a sound was heard from the shivering dragon.</P>
<P>The palace's crimson windows and doors were all smashed;</P>
<P>The dragon's descendants were all scared out of their wits.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Pig smashed the tortoise-shell screens to powder and the coral trees to fragments.</P>
<P>When the nine-headed monster had hidden his princess safely inside he grabbed his crescent-bladed halberd and went for Pig in the front of the living quarters of the palace, shouting, &#8220;Bloody idiot! Swine! How dare you terrorize my family?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Thieving devil,&#8221; retorted Pig. &#8220;How dared you capture me? This was none of my fight till you brought me into it. Give the treasure back at once for me to take back to the king and that'll be that. Otherwise every last member of your family will be killed.&#8221; The demon was in no mood for kindness: he ground his teeth and started fighting Pig. Only then did the ancient dragon calm down enough to lead his dragon sons and grandsons to surround and attack Pig with their spears and swords. Seeing that things were going badly for him Pig feinted and fled, followed by the ancient dragon and his host. A moment later he shot up through the water and they all surfaced at the top of the pool.</P>
<P>Monkey, who had been waiting on the bank, suddenly saw them coming out of the water after Pig, so he put one foot on a cloud and brought out his iron cudgel with a shout of, &#8220;Stay where you are.&#8221; His first blow smashed the ancient dragon king to pulp. It was a terrible sight: his corpse and the scales that had come off it floated on the surface of the pool, which turned red with his gore. His sons and grandsons all fled for their lives in terror, while Prince Ninehead took the body back to the underwater palace.</P>
<P>Brother Monkey and Pig did not pursue them but went back to the bank to discuss what had happened. &#8220;I've knocked a bit of the stuffing out of him,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;I went charging in with my rake and smashed everything to smithereens. They were all scared witless. I was just fighting the prince when the ancient dragon king went for me. Thanks for killing him. Now those bastards have gone back they'll be too busy with mourning and the funeral to come out again. Besides it's getting late now. What are we going to do?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Never mind about it being late,&#8221; replied Monkey. &#8220;This is our chance. Get back down there and attack again. You must get the treasure so that we can go back to court.&#8221; The idiot was feeling lazy so he made all sorts of excuses to get out of going down again, but Monkey insisted: &#8220;Don't worry so, brother. Just draw him out again as you did just now and I'll kill him.&#8221;</P>
<P>As the two of them were talking they heard the roar of a mighty wind as dark and gloomy clouds came from the East, heading South. When Monkey took a closer look he saw that it was the Illustrious Sage Erlang with the Six Brothers of Plum Hill. They had falcons and hounds and were carrying foxes, hares, water-deer and deer that they had killed. All of them had bows and crossbows at their waists and were carrying sharp swords as they arrived on their wind and clouds.</P>
<P>&#8220;Pig,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;here come my seven-sage-sworn brothers. Let's stop them and ask them to help us in this fight. This will really stack the odds in our favour.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If they're your sworn brothers they owe you that,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;The only trouble is that the eldest of them, the Illustrious Sage, once made me surrender, so I feel too embarrassed to face him,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'd like you to go up, stop the clouds and say, 'Wait a moment please, True Lord. The Great Sage Equaling Heaven would like to pay his respects.' I'm sure he'll stop then. I can only face him after he's landed.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot then shot up on his cloud to the top of the mountain to stop Erlang. &#8220;True Lord,&#8221; he shouted at the top of his voice, &#8220;could you slow down for a moment? The Great Sage Equaling Heaven would like to see you.&#8221; On hearing this Lord Erlang ordered the six brothers to stop and exchanged polite salutations with Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where is the Great Sage Equaling Heaven?&#8221; he asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Awaiting your summons at the foot of the mountain,&#8221; Pig replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brothers,&#8221; said Erlang, &#8220;go and ask him up at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>The six brothers Kang, Zhang, Yao, Li, Guo and Zhi all came out of their camps and said, &#8220;Great Sage, our eldest brother has sent us with an invitation for you.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey went forward, paid his respects to them, then accompanied them to the top of the mountain, where Lord Erlang received him, took him by the hand and returned his courtesies.</P>
<P>&#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; he said, &#8220;allow me to congratulate you on being rescued from your terrible sufferings and being converted to the Buddhist faith. Soon you will have succeeded and will be sitting on your lotus throne.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I don't deserve your congratulations,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;I am under enormous obligations that I've hardly begun to repay. I've been rescued and am heading West, but it's too soon to say whether we'll succeed. As we agreed to rescue some monks from disaster in the kingdom of Jisai we are here to capture a demon and demand the return of a treasure. Seeing that you are passing this way, eldest brother, I wonder if I could persuade you to stay and help us. May I ask where you have come from and whether you'd be willing to help?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm just on my way home from a hunting trip with my brothers because I had nothing to do,&#8221; Erlang replied. &#8220;I'm grateful to you, Great Sage, for asking me to stay out of consideration for our old friendship. Of course I'll help subdue a demon if that is what you wish. What kind of demons are there here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Have you forgotten?&#8221; the six brothers asked. &#8220;This is the Ragged Rock Mountain, and below it is the Green Wave Pool, the Infinitely Sage Dragon's palace.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The Infinitely Sage Ancient Dragon is no trouble-maker,&#8221; said Erlang with astonishment. &#8220;How could he have robbed the pagoda?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Recently he's had a son-in-law living with him,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;a nine-headed monster turned spirit. He plotted it all with his father-in-law. They made it rain blood on Jisai then stole the sacred Buddha relic from the top of the pagoda in the Golden Light Monastery. The king in his ignorance had the monks arrested and tortured. I captured two of their underlings in the pagoda who'd been sent out on patrol when my master in his mercy swept it out one night, and they confessed everything in the palace this morning. When the king asked our master to capture these monsters we two were sent here. In the first fight the nine-headed monster grew another head that shot out from his waist and carried Pig off. I had to transform myself to go into the water and rescue him. Then there was another big fight in which I killed the ancient dragon king. The swine have recovered the body and are now in mourning. We two were just discussing how to draw them into battle again when we saw you arriving. That's why I have had the effrontery to ask to see you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As you've killed the ancient dragon king you'll have to hit them so hard that the monster won't know what to do,&#8221; Erlang replied. &#8220;Then you can clean up the whole den of them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;but it's late now.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's a soldier's saying that you should never put off an attack,&#8221; Erlang replied. &#8220;It doesn't matter that it's late.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be so impatient brother,&#8221; said Kang, Yao, Quo and Zhi. &#8220;The demon's family is here, so we don't think he'll run away. Brother Monkey is a distinguished guest, and Iron-haired Pig has been converted too. We have wine and good food in our camp. Why don't we tell the little ones to light the stove and set out a banquet here? It would be a way of congratulating them and a chance to talk at the same time. After a good night's feasting there'll be plenty of time for the battle tomorrow.&#8221;</P>
<P>Erlang was very pleased with the suggestion: &#8220;An excellent idea, brothers.&#8221; The underlings were then ordered to set out the banquet.</P>
<P>&#8220;We couldn't possibly refuse you gentlemen's generous invitation,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;But now we're monks we may only eat vegetarian food. We can't eat meat.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We have vegetarian food in plenty,&#8221; Erlang replied, &#8220;and monastic wine too.&#8221; All the brothers then drank and talked of the old days under the light of the moon and the stars; when the sky was their canopy and the earth their mats.</P>
<P>How true it is that the night is long in loneliness and short in pleasure. Soon the East started to become light and Pig, feeling very cheerful and energetic after a few drinks, said, &#8220;It's getting light. I'm going down to challenge them to battle.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Be careful, Marshal,&#8221; said Erlang. &#8220;Just lure him out for my brothers and me to deal with.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; grinned Pig, &#8220;I understand.&#8221; Watch as he tucks up his clothes, grabs his rake, makes water-dividing magic, jumps in, goes straight to the archway, and charges into the palace with a great war-cry.</P>
<P>The dragon sons were wearing the hempen clothes of mourning as they watched and wept over the dragon's body while the dragon grandsons and the prince were preparing the coffin at the back. Then in came Pig, roaring abuse at them. He landed a terrible blow from his rake that made nine holes in a dragon son's head. The dragon's widow fled inside in terror with the rest of them.</P>
<P>&#8220;The long-snouted monk's killed my son now,&#8221; she howled, and on hearing this the prince led the dragon grandsons out to fight, wielding his crescent-bladed halberd. Pig raised his rake to parry the halberd and fought a fighting retreat till he jumped out of the water. The Great Sage Equaling Heaven and the seven sworn brothers all leapt into the fray, thrusting furiously with sword and spear. One of the dragon grandsons was chopped up into mincemeat.</P>
<P>Seeing that things were going badly the prince rolled in front of the mountain, turned back into himself, spread his wings, and started circling around. Erlang then took his golden bow, fixed a silver pellet to it pulled it to its full extent, and fired it in the air. The monster pulled in its wings and swooped down to bite Erlang with the head that shot out from its waist. Erlang's slim dog leapt up, barked, and bit off the head, which dripped blood. The monster fled for his life in great pain, heading straight back for the Northern Sea. Pig wanted to go after him but Monkey stopped him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't chase him,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Never corner a defeated enemy. Now the dog's bitten that head off I'm sure he'll be more dead than alive. I'm going to turn myself into his double. I want you to part the waters and chase me in there to find the princess and trick the treasure out of her.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't have to chase him if you don't want to,&#8221; said Erlang and his six sages, &#8220;but by letting a creature like that stay alive you are only creating trouble for the future.&#8221; The nine-headed gory monsters that are still found today are its descendants.</P>
<P>Pig did as he was told and parted a way through the waters for Monkey, looking just like the monster, to flee with himself in noisy pursuit. They soon reached the dragon palace, where Princess Infinitely Sage asked, &#8220;Why are you in such a state, prince?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Pig beat me,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and chased me in here. I'm no match for him. Hide the treasures somewhere safe.&#8221;</P>
<P>Not realizing in her alarm that he was an impostor, she fetched a golden casket from the rear palace that she gave to Monkey with the words: &#8220;This is the Buddha relic.&#8221; Then she fetched a white jade box that she gave to Monkey saying, &#8220;This is the nine-lobed magic fungus. Hide the treasures away where they'll be safe while I fight two or three rounds with him to cover you. When the treasures are safe come and join in the fight.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey then tucked the treasures into his clothes, rubbed his face, and turned back into himself. &#8220;Have a good look, princess,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Am I really your husband?&#8221; As the princess made a desperate grab for the boxes Pig ran up and knocked her to the floor with a blow on the shoulder from his rake.</P>
<P>The ancient dragon's widow was fleeing as Pig grabbed her and raised his rake to smash her. &#8220;Stop!&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Don't kill her! Keep her alive for when we go back to announce our victory at court.&#8221; Pig then lifted her up out of the water while Monkey followed him to the bank with the two boxes.</P>
<P>&#8220;Thanks to your power and prestige, elder brother, we have recovered the treasures and wiped out the thieving devils,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;That was no credit of ours,&#8221; said Erlang. &#8220;In the first place the king's good fortune equaled heaven, and in the second you worthy brothers showed your boundless powers.&#8221;</P>
<P>The brothers then all said, &#8220;As you have now succeeded, Brother Monkey, we shall take our leave of you.&#8221; Monkey expressed his thanks profusely and tried to persuade them to go to see the king. None of them agreed, and they led their forces back to Guankou.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey carried the boxes and Pig dragged the dragon wife back to the city in next to no time, travelling by cloud and mist. The liberated monks of the Golden Light Monastery were waiting for them outside the city, and when they saw the two of them suddenly alight from the clouds, they went up and kowtowed, ushering them into the city. The king was then sitting in the main hall of the palace talking with the Tang Priest.</P>
<P>A monk came ahead and took his courage in his hands to go in through the palace gates and report, &#8220;Your Majesty, Lords Monkey and Pig are back with one of the thieves and the treasures.&#8221; The moment he heard this news the king hurried down from the throne hall to welcome them with the Tang Priest and Friar Sand. He was full of expressions of gratitude for their amazing achievement and he ordered a thanksgiving banquet.</P>
<P>&#8220;We don't need any drinks now,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;We can only feast when my disciples have returned the treasure to the pagoda.&#8221; He then asked Monkey why it was that they were only back then as they had left the day before, Monkey then told him all about the battle with the prince, the death of the dragon king, meeting the True Lord Erlang, the defeat of the evil monsters and how he had got the treasures through trickery and transformation. Sanzang, the king and all the civil and military officials were delighted.</P>
<P>&#8220;Can the dragon wife talk in human speech?&#8221; the king then asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Of course she knows human speech,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;She was married to a dragon and had a lot of dragon sons and grandsons.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said the king, &#8220;she'd better tell us the whole story of their crimes.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I don't know anything about the theft of the Buddha relic,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That was all done by that husband of mine, the dragon who's a ghost now, and our son-in-law the nine-headed monster. They knew that the light from your pagoda came from the Buddha relic that they stole under cover of the blood rain.&#8221;</P>
<P>When asked how the magic fungus was stolen she answered, &#8220;My daughter the Infinitely Sage Princess sneaked into the Daluo Heaven and stole the Queen Mother's nine-lobed magic fungus from in front of the Hall of Miraculous Mist. The magic vapors of the fungus have nourished the relic, which will now be indestructible and shine for tens of thousands of years. Even if it's buried or put in a field it will give out thousands of beams of coloured light and auspicious vapors the moment it's brushed. You have now taken it back and killed my husband, all my sons, my son-in-law and my daughter. Please spare my life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There'll be no mercy for you,&#8221; Pig replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no such thing as a family that's all criminal,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'll spare your life on one condition: you look after the pagoda for me for ever.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;A poor life is better than a good death,&#8221; the dragon wife replied. &#8220;Spare my life and I'll do whatever you want.&#8221; Monkey sent for an iron chain that was fetched by one of the aides.</P>
<P>He put it through the dragon wife's collarbone and said to Friar Sand, &#8220;Please ask the king to come and watch the treasures being put back in the pagoda.&#8221;</P>
<P>The king then had his carriage prepared and left the court hand-in-hand with Sanzang, accompanied by the civil and military officials. He went to the Golden Light Monastery and climbed the pagoda, where the relic was placed in a precious vase on the thirteenth floor just under the roof. The dragon wife was chained to the central column of the pagoda. Spells were then said to summon the local deities and city gods of the capital and the Guardians of the monastery, who were ordered to bring the dragon wife food and drink once every three days to keep her alive. If she tried any tricks they were to execute her on the spot. The gods all secretly accepted their orders. Brother Monkey used the magic fungus to sweep out the thirteen stories of the pagoda one by one, then put it in the vase to look after the relic. Then and only then did the pagoda shine anew with coloured light and an auspicious glow that could be seen from all directions and admired by the countries all around.</P>
<P>When they came down out of the pagoda the king thanked them with the words, &#8220;If you, venerable Buddha, and your three Bodhisattvas had not come here this matter would never have been cleared up.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;Golden Light is not a good name as it's not something permanent. Gold can melt and light is only shining vapor. As we monks have gone to some trouble on your behalf we would like to change the name to Subdued Dragon Monastery. This will ensure that you live for ever.&#8221; The king ordered that the name be changed and a new board hung up that read.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>NATION-PROTECTING</P>
<P>SUBDUED DRAGON MONASTERY</P>
<P>FOUNDED BY ROYAL COMMAND</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He then commanded that a banquet be laid on and sent for painters to paint portraits of the four of them. Their names were recorded in the Tower of Five Phoenixes. The king then had his carriage brought out to see the Tang Priest and his disciples on their way. He tried to give them gold and jewels, but they firmly refused to accept anything. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Evil had been wiped out;</P>
<P>Now calmness once more reigned.</P>
<P>Sunshine had been brought back,</P>
<P>The pagoda's light regained.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know what happened on the journey ahead listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>二僧荡怪闹龙宫</p>
<p>群圣除邪获宝贝</p>
</div>
<p>却说祭赛国王与大小公卿，见孙大圣与八戒腾云驾雾，提着两个小妖，飘然而去，一个个朝天礼拜道：“话不虚传！今日方知有此辈神仙活佛！”又见他远去无踪，却拜谢三藏、沙僧道：“寡人肉眼凡胎，只知高徒有力量，拿住妖贼便了，岂知乃腾云驾雾之上仙也。”三藏道：“贫僧无些法力，一路上多亏这三个小徒。”沙僧道：“不瞒陛下说，我大师兄乃齐天大圣皈依。</p>

<p>他曾大闹天宫，使一条金箍棒，十万天兵，无一个对手，只闹得太上老君害怕，玉皇大帝心惊。我二师兄乃天蓬元帅果正，他也曾掌管天河八万水兵大众。惟我弟子无法力，乃卷帘大将受戒。愚弟兄若干别事无能，若说擒妖缚怪，拿贼捕亡，伏虎降龙，踢天弄井，以至搅海翻江之类，略通一二。这腾云驾雾，唤雨呼风，与那换斗移星，担山赶月，特余事耳，何足道哉！”国王闻说，愈十分加敬，请唐僧上坐，口口称为老佛，将沙僧等皆称为菩萨。满朝文武欣然，一国黎民顶礼不题。</p>

<p>却说孙大圣与八戒驾着狂风，把两个小妖摄到乱石山碧波潭，住定云头，将金箍棒吹了一口仙气，叫“变！”变作一把戒刀，将一个黑鱼怪割了耳朵，鲇鱼精割了下唇，撇在水里，喝道：“快早去对那万圣龙王报知，说我齐天大圣孙爷爷在此，着他即送祭赛国金光寺塔上的宝贝出来，免他一家性命！若迸半个不字，我将这潭水搅净，教他一门儿老幼遭诛！”那两个小妖，得了命，负痛逃生，拖着锁索，淬入水内，唬得那些鼋鼍龟鳖，虾蟹鱼精，都来围住问道：“你两个为何拖绳带索？”一个掩着耳，摇头摆尾，一个侮着嘴，跌脚捶胸；都嚷嚷闹闹，径上龙王宫殿报：“大王，祸事了！”那万圣龙王正与九头驸马饮酒，忽见他两个来，即停杯问何祸事。那两个即告道：“昨夜巡拦，被唐僧、孙行者扫塔捉获，用铁索拴锁。今早见国王，又被那行者与猪八戒抓着我两个，一个割了耳朵，一个割了嘴唇，抛在水中，着我来报，要索那塔顶宝贝。”遂将前后事，细说了一遍。那老龙听说是孙行者齐天大圣，唬得魂不附体，魄散九霄，战兢兢对驸马道：“贤婿啊，别个来还好计较，若果是他，却不善也！”驸马笑道：“太岳放心，愚婿自幼学了些武艺，四海之内，也曾会过几个豪杰，怕他做甚！等我出去与他交战三合，管取那厮缩首归降，不敢仰视。”</p>

<p>好妖怪，急纵身披挂了，使一般兵器，叫做月牙铲，步出宫，分开水道，在水面上叫道：“是甚么齐天大圣！快上来纳命！”行者与八戒立在岸边，观看那妖精怎生打扮：戴一顶烂银盔，光欺白雪；贯一副兜鍪甲，亮敌秋霜。上罩着锦征袍，真个是彩云笼玉；腰束着犀纹带，果然象花蟒缠金。手执着月牙铲，霞飞电掣；脚穿着猪皮靴，水利波分。远看时一头一面，近睹处四面皆人。前有眼，后有眼，八方通见；左也口，右也口，九口言论。一声吆喝长空振，似鹤飞鸣贯九宸。他见无人对答，又叫一声：“那个是齐天大圣？”行者按一按金箍，理一理铁棒道：</p>

<p>“老孙便是。”那怪道：“你家居何处？身出何方！怎生得到祭赛国，与那国王守塔，却大胆获我头目，又敢行凶，上吾宝山索战？”行者骂道：“你这贼怪，原来不识你孙爷爷哩！你上前，听我道：老孙祖住花果山，大海之间水帘洞。自幼修成不坏身，玉皇封我齐天圣。只因大闹斗牛宫，天上诸神难取胜。当请如来展妙高，无边智慧非凡用。为翻筋斗赌神通，手化为山压我重。</p>

<p>整到如今五百年，观者劝解方逃命。大唐三藏上西天，远拜灵山求佛颂。解脱吾身保护他，炼魔净怪从修行。路逢西域祭赛城。屈害僧人三代命。我等慈悲问旧情，乃因塔上无光映。吾师扫塔探分明，夜至三更天籁静。捉住鱼精取实供，他言汝等偷宝珍。合盘为盗有龙王，公主连名称万圣。血雨浇淋塔上光，将他宝贝偷来用。殿前供状更无虚，我奉君言驰此境。所以相寻索战争，不须再问孙爷姓。快将宝贝献还他，免汝老少全家命。敢若无知骋胜强，教你水涸山颓都蹭蹬！”那驸马闻言，微微冷笑道：“你原来是取经的和尚，没要紧罗织管事！我偷他的宝贝，你取佛的经文，与你何干，却来厮斗！”行者道：“这贼怪甚不达理！我虽不受国王的恩惠，不食他的水米，不该与他出力。但是你偷他的宝贝，污他的宝塔，屡年屈苦金光寺僧人，他是我一门同气，我怎么不与他出力，辨明冤枉？”驸马道：“你既如此，想是要行赌赛。常言道，武不善作，但只怕起手处，不得留情，一时间伤了你的性命，误了你去取经！”行者大怒，骂道：</p>

<p>“这泼贼怪，有甚强能，敢开大口！走上来，吃老爷一棒！”那驸马更不心慌，把月牙铲架住铁棒，就在那乱石山头，这一场真个好杀，妖魔盗宝塔无光，行者擒妖报国王。小怪逃生回水内，老龙破胆各商量。九头驸马施威武，披挂前来展素强。怒发齐天孙大圣，金箍棒起十分刚。那怪物，九个头颅十八眼，前前后后放毫光；这行者，一双铁臂千斤力，蔼蔼纷纷并瑞祥。铲似一阳初现月，棒如万里遍飞霜。他说“你无干休把不平报！”我道“你有意偷宝真不良！”那泼贼，少轻狂，还他宝贝得安康！棒迎铲架争高下，不见输赢练战场。</p>

<p>他两个往往来来，斗经三十余合，不分胜负。猪八戒立在山前，见他们战到酣美之处，举着钉钯，从妖精背后一筑。原来那怪九个头，转转都是眼睛，看得明白，见八戒在背后来时，即使铲鐏架着钉钯，铲头抵着铁棒。又耐战五七合，挡不得前后齐轮，他却打个滚，腾空跳起，现了本象，乃是一个九头虫，观其形象十分恶，见此身模怕杀人！他生得：毛羽铺锦，团身结絮。方圆有丈二规模，长短似鼋鼍样致。两只脚尖利如钩，九个头攒环一处。展开翅极善飞扬，纵大鹏无他力气；发起声远振天涯，比仙鹤还能高唳。眼多闪灼幌金光，气傲不同凡鸟类。</p>

<p>猪八戒看见心惊道：“哥啊！我自为人，也不曾见这等个恶物！</p>

<p>是甚血气生此禽兽也？”行者道：“真个罕有！真个罕有！等我赶上打去！”好大圣，急纵祥云，跳在空中，使铁棒照头便打。那怪物大显身，展翅斜飞，飕的打个转身，掠到山前，半腰里又伸出一个头来，张开口如血盆相似，把八戒一口咬着鬃，半拖半扯，捉下碧波潭水内而去。及至龙宫外，还变作前番模样，将八戒掷之于地，叫：“小的们何在？”那里面鲭鲌鲤鳜之鱼精，龟鳖鼋鼍之介怪，一拥齐来，道声“有！”驸马道：“把这个和尚，绑在那里，与我巡拦的小卒报仇！”众精推推嚷嚷，抬进八戒去时，那老龙王欢喜迎出道：“贤婿有功，怎生捉他来也？”那驸马把上项原故，说了一遍，老龙即命排酒贺功不题。</p>

<p>却说孙行者见妖精擒了八戒，心中惧道：“这厮恁般利害！</p>

<p>我待回朝见师，恐那国王笑我。待要开言骂战，曾奈我又单身，况水面之事不惯。且等我变化了进去，看那怪把呆子怎生摆布，若得便，且偷他出来干事。”好大圣，捻着诀，摇身一变，还变做一个螃蟹，淬于水内，径至牌楼之前。原来这条路是他前番袭牛魔王盗金睛兽走熟了的，直至那宫阙之下，横爬过去，又见那老龙王与九头虫合家儿欢喜饮酒。行者不敢相近，爬过东廊之下，见几个虾精蟹精，纷纷纭纭耍子。行者听了一会言谈，却就学语学话，问道：“驸马爷爷拿来的那长嘴和尚，这会死了不曾？”众精道：“不曾死，缚在那西廊下哼的不是？”行者听说，又轻轻的爬过西廊，真个那呆子绑在柱上哼哩。行者近前道：“八戒，认得我么？”八戒听得声音，知是行者，道：“哥哥，怎么了！反被这厮捉住我也！”行者四顾无人，将钳咬断索子叫走，那呆子脱了手道：“哥哥，我的兵器，被他收了，又奈何？”行者道：“你可知道收在那里？”八戒道：“当被那怪拿上宫殿去了。”行者道：“你先去牌楼下等我。”八戒逃生，悄悄的溜出。行者复身爬上宫殿，观看左首下有光彩森森，乃是八戒的钉钯放光，使个隐身法，将钯偷出，到牌楼下，叫声：“八戒！接兵器！”</p>

<p>呆子得了钯，便道：“哥哥，你先走，等老猪打进宫殿。若得胜，就捉住他一家子；若不胜，败出来，你在这潭岸上救应。”行者大喜，只教仔细，八戒道：“不怕他！水里本事，我略有些儿。”行者丢了他，负出水面不题。</p>

<p>这八戒束了皂直裰，双手缠钯，一声喊，打将进去。慌得那大小水族，奔奔波波，跑上宫殿，吆喝道：“不好了！长嘴和尚挣断绳返打进来了！”那老龙与九头虫并一家子俱措手不及，跳起来，藏藏躲躲。这呆子不顾死活，闯上宫殿，一路钯，筑破门扇，打破桌椅，把些吃酒的家火之类，尽皆打碎。有诗为证，诗曰：木母遭逢水怪擒，心猿不舍苦相寻。暗施巧计偷开锁，大显神威怒恨深。驸马忙携公主躲，龙王战栗绝声音。水宫绛阙门窗损，龙子龙孙尽没魂。这一场，被八戒把玳瑁屏打得粉碎，珊瑚树掼得凋零。那九头虫将公主安藏在内，急取月牙铲，赶至前宫喝道：“泼夯豕彘！怎敢欺心惊吾眷族！”八戒骂道：“这贼怪，你焉敢将我捉来！这场不干我事，是你请我来家打的！快拿宝贝还我，回见国王了事；不然，决不饶你一家命也！”那怪那肯容情，咬定牙齿，与八戒交锋。那老龙才定了神思，领龙子龙孙，各执枪刀，齐来攻取。八戒见事体不谐，虚幌一钯，撤身便走，那老龙帅众追来。须臾，撺出水中，都到潭面上翻腾。却说孙行者立于潭岸等候，忽见他们追赶八戒，出离水中，就半踏云雾，掣铁棒，喝声“休走！”只一下，把个老龙头打得稀烂。</p>

<p>可怜血溅潭中红水泛，尸飘浪上败鳞浮！唬得那龙子龙孙各各逃命，九头驸马收龙尸，转宫而去。</p>

<p>行者与八戒且不追袭，回上岸，备言前事。八戒道：“这厮锐气挫了！被我那一路钯，打进去时，打得落花流水，魂散魄飞！正与那驸马厮斗，却被老龙王赶着，却亏了你打死。那厮们回去，一定停丧挂孝，决不肯出来。今又天色晚了，却怎奈何？”行者道：“管甚么天晚！乘此机会，你还下去攻战，务必取出宝贝，方可回朝。”那呆子意懒情疏，徉徉推托，行者催逼道：</p>

<p>“兄弟不必多疑，还象刚才引出来，等我打他。”两人正自商量，只听得狂风滚滚，惨雾阴阴，忽从东方径往南去。行者仔细观看，乃二郎显圣，领梅山六兄弟，架着鹰犬，挑着狐兔，抬着獐鹿，一个个腰挎弯弓，手持利刃，纵风雾踊跃而来。行者道：“八戒，那是我七圣兄弟，倒好留请他们，与我助战。若得成功，倒是一场大机会也。”八戒道：“既是兄弟，极该留请。”行者道：</p>

<p>“但内有显圣大哥，我曾受他降伏，不好见他。你去拦住云头，叫道：‘真君，且略住住。齐天大圣在此进拜。’他若听见是我，断然住了。待他安下，我却好见。”那呆子急纵云头，上山拦住，厉声高叫道：“真君，且慢车驾，有齐天大圣请见哩。”那爷爷见说，即传令就停住六兄弟，与八戒相见毕，问：“齐天大圣何在？”八戒道：“现在山下听呼唤。”二郎道：“兄弟们，快去请来。”六兄弟乃是康、张、姚、李、郭、直，各各出营叫道：“孙悟空哥哥，大哥有请。”行者上前，对众作礼，遂同上山。二郎爷爷迎见，携手相搀，一同相见道：“大圣，你去脱大难，受戒沙门，刻日功完，高登莲座，可贺！可贺！”行者道：“不敢，向蒙莫大之恩，未展斯须之报。虽然脱难西行，未知功行何如。今因路遇祭赛国，搭救僧灾，在此擒妖索宝。偶见兄长车驾，大胆请留一助，未审兄长自何而来，肯见爱否。”二郎笑道：“我因闲暇无事，同众兄弟采猎而回，幸蒙大圣不弃留会，足感故旧之情。若命挟力降妖，敢不如命！却不知此地是何怪贼？”六圣道：“大哥忘了？此间是乱石山，山下乃碧波潭，万圣之龙宫也。”二郎惊呀道：“万圣老龙却不生事，怎么敢偷塔宝？”行者道：“他近日招了一个驸马，乃是九头虫成精。他郎丈两个做贼，将祭赛国下了一场血雨，把金光寺塔顶舍利佛宝偷来。那国王不解其意，苦拿着僧人拷打。是我师父慈悲，夜来扫搭，当被我在塔上拿住两个小妖，是他差来巡探的。今早押赴朝中，实实供招了。</p>

<p>那国王就请我师收降，师命我等到此。先一场战，被九头虫腰里伸出一个头来，把八戒衔了去，我却又变化下水，解了八戒。</p>

<p>才然大战一场，是我把老龙打死，那厮们收尸挂孝去了。我两个正议索战，却见兄长仪仗降临，故此轻渎也。”二郎道：“既伤了老龙，正好与他攻击，使那厮不能措手，却不连窝巢都灭绝了？”八戒道：“虽是如此，奈天晚何？”二郎道：“兵家云，征不待时，何怕天晚！”康姚郭直道：“大哥莫忙，那厮家眷在此，料无处去。孙二哥也是贵客，猪刚鬣又归了正果，我们营内，有随带的酒肴，教小的们取火，就此铺设：一则与二位贺喜，二来也当叙情。且欢会这一夜，待天明索战何迟？”二郎大喜道：“贤弟说得极当。”却命小校安排，行者道：“列位盛情，不敢固却。但自做和尚，都是斋戒，恐荤素不便。”二郎道：“有素果品，酒也是素的。”众兄弟在星月光前，幕天席地，举杯叙旧。</p>

<p>正是寂寞更长，欢娱夜短，早不觉东方发白。那八戒几锺酒吃得兴抖抖的道：“天将明了，等老猪下水去索战也。”二郎道：“元帅仔细，只要引他出来，我兄弟们好下手。”八戒笑道：</p>

<p>“我晓得！我晓得！你看他敛衣缠钯，使分水法，跳将下去，径至那牌楼下，发声喊，打入殿内。此时那龙子披了麻，看着龙尸哭，龙孙与那驸马，在后面收拾棺材哩。这八戒骂上前，手起处，钯头着重，把个龙子夹脑连头，一钯筑了九个窟窿，唬得那龙婆与众往里乱跑，哭道：“长嘴和尚又把我儿打死了！”那驸马闻言，即使月牙铲，带龙孙往外杀来。这八戒举钯迎敌，且战且退，跳出水中。这岸上齐天大圣与七兄弟一拥上前，枪刀乱扎，把个龙孙剁成几断肉饼。那驸马见不停当，在山前打个滚，又现了本象，展开翅，旋绕飞腾。二郎即取金弓，安上银弹，扯满弓，往上就打。那怪急铩翅，掠到边前，要咬二郎；半腰里才伸出一个头来，被那头细犬，撺上去，汪的一口，把头血淋淋的咬将下来。那怪物负痛逃生，径投北海而去。八戒便要赶去，行者止住道：“且莫赶他，正是穷寇勿追，他被细犬咬了头，必定是多死少生。等我变做他的模样，你分开水路，赶我进去，寻那宫主，诈他宝贝来也。”二郎与六圣道：“不赶他，倒也罢了，只是遗这种类在世，必为后人之害。”至今有个九头虫滴血，是遗种也。</p>

<p>那八戒依言，分开水路，行者变作怪象前走，八戒吆吆喝喝后追。渐渐追至龙宫，只见那万圣宫主道：“驸马，怎么这等慌张？”行者道：“那八戒得胜，把我赶将进来，觉道不能敌他。|Qī|shu|ωang|</p>

<p>你快把宝贝好生藏了！”那宫主急忙难识真假，即于后殿里取出一个浑金匣子来，递与行者道：“这是佛宝。”又取出一个白玉匣子，也递与行者道：“这是九叶灵芝。你拿这宝贝藏去，等我与猪八戒斗上两三合，挡住他，你将宝贝收好了，再出来与他合战。”行者将两个匣儿收在身边，把脸一抹，现了本象道：</p>

<p>“宫主，你看我可是驸马么？”宫主慌了，便要抢夺匣子，被八戒跑上去，着背一钯，筑倒在地。还有一个老龙婆撤身就走，被八戒扯住，举钯才筑，行者道：“且住！莫打死他，留个活的，好去国内见功。”遂将龙婆提出水面。行者随后捧着两个匣子上岸，对二郎道：“感兄长威力，得了宝贝，扫净妖贼也。”二郎道：“一则是那国王洪福齐天，二则是贤昆玉神通无量，我何功之有！”</p>

<p>兄弟们俱道：“孙二哥既已功成，我们就此告别。”行者感谢不尽，欲留同见国王。诸公不肯，遂帅众回灌口去讫。</p>

<p>行者捧着匣子，八戒拖着龙婆，半云半雾，顷刻间到了国内。原来那金光寺解脱的和尚，都在城外迎接，忽见他两个云雾定时，近前磕头礼拜，接入城中。那国王与唐僧正在殿上讲论，这里有先走的和尚礼仗着胆入朝门奏道：“万岁，孙猪二老爷擒贼获宝而来也。”那国王听说，连忙下殿，共唐僧，沙僧，迎着称谢神功不尽，随命排筵谢恩。三藏道：“且不须赐饮，着小徒归了塔中之宝，方可饮宴。”三藏又问行者道：“汝等昨日离国，怎么今日才来？”行者把那战驸马，打龙王，逢真君，败妖怪，及变化诈宝贝之事，细说了一遍。三藏与国王，大小文武，俱喜之不胜。国王又问：“龙婆能人言语否？”八戒道：“乃是龙王之妻，生了许多龙子龙孙，岂不知人言？”国王道：“既知人言，快早说前后做贼之事。”龙婆道：“偷佛宝，我全不知，都是我那夫君龙鬼与那驸马九头虫，知你塔上之光乃是佛家舍利子，三年前下了血雨，乘机盗去。”又问：“灵芝草是怎么偷的？”</p>

<p>龙婆道：“只是我小女万圣宫主私入大罗天上灵霄殿前，偷的王母娘娘九叶灵芝草。那舍利子得这草的仙气温养着，千年不坏，万载生光，去地下，或田中，扫一扫即有万道霞光，千条瑞气。如今被你夺来，弄得我夫死子绝，婿丧女亡，千万饶了我的命罢！”八戒道：“正不饶你哩！”行者道：“家无全犯，我便饶你，只便要你长远替我看塔。”龙婆道：“好死不如恶活。但留我命，凭你教做甚么。”行者叫取铁索来，当驾官即取铁索一条，把龙婆琵琶骨穿了，教沙僧：“请国王来看我们安塔去。”那国王即忙排驾，遂同三藏携手出朝，并文武多官，随至金光寺上塔。将舍利子安在第十三层塔顶宝瓶中间，把龙婆锁在塔心柱上，念动真言，唤出本国土地、城隍与本寺伽蓝，每三日送饮食一餐，与这龙婆度口，少有差讹，即行处斩，众神暗中领诺。行者却将芝草把十三层塔层层扫过，安在瓶内，温养舍利子。这才是整旧如新，霞光万道，瑞气千条，依然八方共睹，四国同瞻。下了塔门，国王就谢道：“不是老佛与三位菩萨到此，怎生得明此事也！”行者道：“陛下，金光二字不好，不是久住之物：金乃流动之物，光乃熌灼之气。贫僧为你劳碌这场，将此寺改作伏龙寺，教你永远常存。”那国王即命换了字号，悬上新匾，乃是“敕建护国伏龙寺”。一壁厢安排御宴，一壁厢召丹青写下四众生形，五凤楼注了名号。国王摆銮驾，送唐僧师徒，赐金玉酬答，师徒们坚辞，一毫不受。这真个是：邪怪剪除万境静，宝塔回光大地明。毕竟不知此去前路如何，且听下回分解。</p>
