<P>Taizong and his civil and military officials all burned incense, bowed to the golden body of the Lord Buddha, and paid their respects to the Arhats. The Hierarch Chen Xuanzang then led all the monks to bow to the Emperor, and when this was over they divided into their groups and went to their meditation places while the Hierarch showed the Emperor the notice about the delivery of the lonely ghosts. It read:</p>

<p>太宗文武俱各拈香，拜了佛祖金身，参了罗汉。又见那大阐都纲陈玄奘法师引众僧罗拜唐王。礼毕，分班各安禅位，法师献上济孤榜文与太宗看。榜曰：</p>

<P>&#8220;Mysterious is the ultimate virtue, and the Sect of Meditation leads to Nirvana. The purity of the truth is all-knowing; it pervades the Three Regions of the universe. Through its countless changes it controls the Negative and Positive; unbounded are the embodiments of the eternal reality. In considering those forlorn ghosts one should be deeply distressed. At the sacred command of Taizong we have assembled some chosen monks for meditation and preaching. He has opened wide the gates of enlightenment and rowed far the boat of mercy, saving all the beings in the sea of suffering, and delivering those who had long been afflicted by the six ways of existence. They will be led back to the right road and revel in the great chaos; in action and in passivity they will be at one with primal simplicity. For this wonderful cause they are invited to see the purple gates of the pure capital, and through our assembly they will escape from the confines of Hell to climb to the World of Bliss and be free, wandering as they please in the Paradise of the West. As the poem goes:</P>

</div>

<div class="right">
<p>至德渺茫，禅宗寂灭。清净灵通，周流三界。千变万化，统摄阴阳。体用真常，无穷极矣。观彼孤魂，深宜哀愍。此奉太宗圣命：选集诸僧，参禅讲法。大开方便门庭，广运慈悲舟楫，普济苦海群生，脱免沉疴六趣。引归真路，普玩鸿蒙；动止无为，混成纯素。仗此良因，邀赏清都绛阙；乘吾胜会，脱离地狱凡笼。早登极乐任逍遥，来往西方随自在。</p>

<P>When he had read this the Tang Emperor's heart was filled with happiness and he said to the monks, &#8220;Hold firm to your sincerity and never allow yourselves a moment's slackness in the service of the Buddha. Later on, when the Assembly is over, you will be blessed and we shall richly reward you. You shall certainly not have labored in vain.&#8221; The twelve hundred monks all kowtowed to thank him. When the three vegetarian meals for the day were over the Tang Emperor went back to the palace. He was invited to come back to the Grand Assembly to burn incense once more on the seventh day. As evening was now drawing in all the officials went away. It was a fine evening:</P>

<P>The Bodhisattva Guanyin from Potaraka Island in the Southern Sea had been long in Chang'an, looking on the Buddha's orders for the man to fetch the scriptures, but she had not yet found anyone really virtuous. Then she heard that Taizong was propagating the True Achievement and selecting venerable monks for a Grand Assembly, and when she saw that the Master of Ceremonies was the monk Jiangliu who was really a Buddha's son came down from the realms of supreme bliss, an elder whom she herself had led into his earthly mother's womb, she was very pleased. She took her disciple Moksa and the treasures that the Buddha had given her out on the street to offer them for sale.</P>
<P>Do you know what these treasures were? There was a precious brocade cassock and-a monastic staff with nine rings. She also had those three golden bands, but she put them away safely for future use; she was only selling the cassock and the staff.</P>
<P>There was a monk in Chang'an city too stupid to be chosen for the service but who nonetheless had some ill-gotten banknotes. When he saw the bald, scabby, barefoot figure wearing a tattered robe&#8212;the form the Bodhisattva had taken&#8212;offering the cassock of dazzling beauty for sale he went up and asked, &#8220;How much d'you want for that cassock, Scabby?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The price of the cassock is five thousand ounces of silver and the staff two thousand,&#8221; replied the Bodhisattva. The stupid monk roared with laughter.</P>
<P>&#8220;You must be a nutcase, Scabby, or else a dope. Those two lousy things wouldn't be worth that much unless they gave you immortality and turned you into a Buddha. No deal. Take'em away.&#8221;</P>
<P>Not bothering to argue, the Bodhisattva walked on with Moksa. After they had been going for quite a long time they found themselves in front of the Donghua Gate of the palace, where the minister Xiao Yu happened to be returning home from morning court. Ignoring the crowd of lictors who were shouting to everyone to get out of the way, the Bodhisattva calmly went into the middle of the road with the cassock in her hands and headed straight for the minister. When the minister reined in his horse to look he saw the cassock gleaming richly and sent an attendant to ask its price.</P>
<P>&#8220;I want five thousand ounces of silver for the cassock and two thousand for the staff,&#8221; said the Bodhisattva.</P>
<P>&#8220;What's so good about the cassock to make it worth that much?&#8221; asked Xiao Yu.</P>
<P>&#8220;On the one hand it is good and on the other it isn't,&#8221; replied the Bodhisattva. &#8220;On the one hand it has a price and on the other it hasn't.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What's good about it and what isn't?&#8221; asked the minister.</P>
<P>&#8220;Whoever wears this cassock of mine will not sink into the mire, will not fall into Hell, will not be ensnared by evil and will not meet disaster from tiger or wolf: these are its good points. But as for a stupid monk who is greedy and debauched, who takes delight in the sufferings of others, does not eat vegetarian food, and breaks the monastic bans; or a common layman who harms the scriptures and slanders the Buddha&#8212;such people have great difficulty even in seeing this cassock of mine: that is its disadvantage.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What did you mean by saying that it both has a price and hasn't got one?&#8221; asked the minister, continuing his questions.</P>
<P>&#8220;Anyone who doesn't obey the Buddha's Law or honour the Three Treasures but still insists on buying the cassock and the staff will have to pay seven thousand ounces for them: in that case they have a price. But if anyone who honors the Three Treasures, takes pleasure in goodness, and believes in our Buddha, wants to have them, then I'll give him the cassock and staff as a gift. In that case they have no price.&#8221; Xiao Yu's cheeks coloured, showing that he was a good man, and he dismounted to greet the Bodhisattva.</P>
<P>&#8220;Elder of the Great Law,&#8221; he said, &#8220;forgive me. Our Great Tang Emperor is a true lover of goodness, and every one of the civil and military officials in his court acts piously. This cassock would be just right for the Hierarch, Master Chen Xuanzang, to wear in the Great Land and Water Mass that is now being conducted. You and I shall go into the palace to see His Majesty.&#8221;</p>

<p>却说南海普陀山观世音菩萨，自领了如来佛旨，在长安城访察取经的善人，日久未逢真实有德行者。忽闻得太宗宣扬善果，选举高僧，开建大会，又见得法师坛主，乃是江流儿和尚，正是极乐中降来的佛子，又是他原引送投胎的长老，菩萨十分欢喜。就将佛赐的宝贝，捧上长街，与木叉货卖。你道他是何宝贝？有一件锦蝠异宝袈裟、九环锡杖，还有那金紧禁三个箍儿，密密藏收，以俟后用。只将袈裟、锡杖出卖。长安城里，有那选不中的愚僧，倒有几贯村钞。见菩萨变化个疥癞形容，身穿破衲，赤脚光头，将袈裟捧定，艳艳生光，他上前问道：“那癞和尚，你的袈裟要卖多少价钱？”菩萨道：“袈裟价值五千两，锡杖价值二千两。”那愚僧笑道：“这两个癞和尚是疯子，是傻子！这两件粗物，就卖得七千两银子？只是除非穿上身长生不老，就得成佛作祖，也值不得这许多！拿了去，卖不成！”那菩萨更不争吵，与木叉往前又走。行勾多时，来到东华门前，正撞着宰相萧星散朝而回，众头踏喝开街道。那菩萨公然不避，当街上拿着袈裟，径迎着宰相。宰相勒马观看，见袈裟艳艳生光，着手下人问那卖袈裟的要价几何。菩萨道：“袈裟要五千两，锡杖要二千两。”萧星道：“有何好处，值这般高价？”菩萨道：“袈裟有好处，有不好处；有要钱处，有不要钱处。”萧星道：“何为好？何为不好？”菩萨道：“着了我袈裟，不入沉沦，不堕地狱，不遭恶毒之难，不遇虎狼之穴，便是好处；若贪淫乐祸的愚僧，不斋不戒的和尚，毁经谤佛的凡夫，难见我袈裟之面，这便是不好处。”又问道：“何为要钱，不要钱？”菩萨道：“不遵佛法，不敬三宝，强买袈裟、锡杖，定要卖他七千两，这便是要钱；若敬重三宝，见善随喜，皈依我佛，承受得起，我将袈裟、锡杖，情愿送他，与我结个善缘，这便是不要钱。”萧星闻言，倍添春色，知他是个好人，即便下马，与菩萨以礼相见，口称：“大法长老，恕我萧星之罪。我大唐皇帝十分好善，满朝的文武，无不奉行。即今起建水陆大会，这袈裟正好与大都阐陈玄奘法师穿用。我和你入朝见驾去来。”</p>

<P>The Bodhisattva gladly followed him as he turned around and went straight in through the Donghua Gate. The eunuchs reported their arrival, and they were summoned to the throne hall. Xiao Yu led the two scabby monks in, and they stood beneath the steps of the throne.</P>
<P>&#8220;What have you come to report, Xiao Yu?&#8221; the Emperor asked. Xiao Yu prostrated himself in front of the steps and replied, &#8220;When your subject went out through the Donghua Gate I met two monks who were selling a cassock and a staff. It occurred to me that this cassock would be suitable for Master Xuanzang to wear. So I have brought the monks for an audience with Your Majesty.&#8221; The delighted Taizong asked how much the cassock cost. Still standing beneath the steps, and not making any gestures of courtesy, the Bodhisattva and Moksa replied, &#8220;The cassock costs five thousand ounces of silver, and the staff two thousand.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What advantages does the cassock have to make it worth so much?&#8221; the Emperor asked. To this the Bodhisattva replied:</P>

<P>When the Tang Emperor heard these words spoken in his throne hall he was filled with joy, and he asked another question: &#8220;Monk, what is so wonderful about your nine-ringed staff?&#8221;</P>


<P>&#8220;This staff of mine,&#8221; the Bodhisattva replied, &#8220;is:</P>

<P>The Tang Emperor then ordered that the cassock be unfolded. On examining it from top to bottom he saw that it was indeed a fine article.</P>


<P>&#8220;Elder of the Great Law,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I tell you truthfully that I am now propagating the good word and widely sowing seeds of blessing. At this moment many monks are assembled at the Huasheng Monastery for recitation of the surras. Among them is one monk of outstanding virtue whose Buddha-name is Xuanzang, and we wish to buy those two treasures of yours to give him. So what is your price?&#8221;</P>
<P>The Bodhisattva and Moksa put their hands together, intoned the name of the Buddha, and bowed down. &#8220;If he really is a virtuous monk,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I shall give them to him, and I refuse to accept any money for them.&#8221; With that she turned and left.</P>
<P>The Emperor immediately told Xiao Yu to stop her as he rose to his feet and called out, &#8220;You told us that you wanted five thousand ounces for the cassock and two thousand for the staff, but now that we have said we shall buy them, you refuse to take any money. Are you going to say that I abused my power to seize your things? We would never dream of it. We shall pay the price you asked, and will take no refusal.&#8221;</P>
<P>Raising her hand the Bodhisattva said, &#8220;I made a vow that I would give them free to anyone who honoured the Three Treasures, delighted in goodness, and believed in our Buddha. Now I have seen that Your Majesty is a good and virtuous respecter of our Buddhist faith, and have heard that there is a monk of virtuous conduct who preaches the Great Law, it is only right that I should offer them to him; I don't want any money for them. I am leaving the things here. Good-bye.&#8221; The Tang Emperor was very pleased with the monk's sincerity, and ordered that a large vegetarian banquet be given to thank him in the Imperial Kitchen. This the Bodhisattva refused to accept and went airily off. There is no need to describe how she returned to her hide-out in the local god's temple.</p>

<div class="right">
<p>唐王闻言，即命展开袈裟，从头细看，果然是件好物，道：“大法长老，实不瞒你，朕今大开善教，广种福田，见在那化生寺聚集多僧，敷演经法。内中有一个大有德行者，法名玄奘。朕买你这两件宝物，赐他受用。你端的要价几何？”菩萨闻言，与木叉合掌皈依，道声佛号，躬身上启道：“既有德行，贫僧情愿送他，决不要钱。”说罢，抽身便走。唐王急着萧禹扯住，欠身立于殿上，问曰：“你原说袈裟五千两，锡杖二千两，你见朕要买，就不要钱，敢是说朕心倚恃君位，强要你的物件？更无此理。朕照你原价奉偿，却不可推避。”菩萨起手道：“贫僧有愿在前，原说果有敬重三宝，见善随喜，皈依我佛，不要钱，愿送与他。今见陛下明德止善，敬我佛门，况又高僧有德有行，宣扬大法，理当奉上，决不要钱。贫僧愿留下此物告回。”唐王见他这等勤恳甚喜，随命光禄寺大排素宴酬谢。菩萨又坚辞不受，畅然而去，依旧望都土地庙中隐避不题。</p>

<P>Taizong arranged for a court to be held at midday and sent Wei Zheng with a decree summoning Xuanzang to attend. He found the monastic official assembling the monks as he climbed the rostrum for the chanting of surras and gathas. The moment he heard the decree he came down from the rostrum, tidied his clothes, and went with Wei Zheng to the imperial presence.</P>
<P>&#8220;Up till now we have had nothing suitable with which to thank you, Your Grace, for your efforts in acquiring merit. This morning Xiao Yu met two monks who have vowed to give you a precious brocade cassock and a nine-ringed monk's staff. We have therefore sent for you, Master, to come and receive them,&#8221; said the Emperor. Xuanzang kowtowed in thanks.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you do not reject it, Your Grace, let us see what it looks like on you.&#8221; Xuanzang shook it open, draped it across his shoulders, took the staff in his hand, and stood respectfully before the steps of the throne. The monarch and all his ministers were overjoyed. He truly was a son of the Tathagata. Look at him:</P>

<p>却说太宗设午朝，着魏征赍旨，宣玄奘入朝。那法师正聚众登坛，讽经诵偈，一闻有旨，随下坛整衣，与魏征同往见驾。太宗道：“求证善事，有劳法师，无物酬谢。早间萧星迎着二僧，愿送锦蝠异宝袈裟一件，九环锡杖一条。今特召法师领去受用。”玄奘叩头谢恩。太宗道：“法师如不弃，可穿上与朕看看。”长老遂将袈裟抖开，披在身上，手持锡杖，侍立阶前。君臣个个欣然。诚为如来佛子，你看他——</p>

<P>All the civil and military officials cried out with admiration, and the Emperor was delighted. Telling the Master of the Law to put the cassock on properly and take the staff, he granted him two bands of ceremonial attendants and had a host of officials see him out of the palace and walk with him to his monastery. It was just like the procession for a top graduate in the palace examination. Xuanzang bowed once more to thank the Emperor and then set out, striding majestically along the highway. All the travelling merchants, the shop-keepers, the fashionable young men, the professional scribes, the men and women, young and old, in the city of Chang'an fought to get a look at him and praise him.</P>
<P>&#8220;What a splendid Master of the Law,&#8221; they said. &#8220;He's an Arhat come down to earth, a living Bodhisattva come to see us mortals.&#8221; Xuanzang went straight to his monastery, where all the monks left their places of meditation to welcome him. When they saw the cassock he was wearing and the staff in his hand they all said that King Ksitigarbha had come, did homage to him, and stood in attendance to right and left. Ascending the main hall, Xuanzang burned incense and worshipped Buddha, and when he had given an account of the Emperor's grade they all returned to their seats for meditation. Nobody noticed that the red wheel of the sun was now sinking in the West.</P>

<P>Time passed in the snap of a finger, and it was time for the special assembly on the seventh day, so Xuanzang wrote a memorial inviting the Tang Emperor to come and burn incense. His reputation for piety had now spread throughout the empire. Taizong therefore led a large number of civil and military officials and his empresses, consorts and their families to the monastery in a procession of carriages to the temple early that morning. Everyone in the city, whether young or old, humble or mighty, went to the temple to hear the preaching.</P>
<P>The Bodhisattva said to Moksa, &#8220;Today is a special day of the Great Mass of Land and Water, which will go on from this first seventh day to the seventh seventh day, as is proper. You and I are going to mingle with the crowds for three reasons: to see the service, to see the Golden Cicada enjoying the blessing of wearing our treasure, and to hear what branch of the scriptures he preaches on.&#8221; The pair of them went to the temple. They were fated to meet their old acquaintance, just as the Wisdom returned to its own preaching place. When they went inside the monastery they saw that this great and heavenly dynasty surpassed any other in the world; while the Jetavana Monastery and Sravana were no match for this temple. Sacred music sounded clear above the shouting of Buddha names. When the Bodhisattva approached the preaching dais she saw in Xuanzang the likeness of the wise Golden Cicada. As the poem goes:</P>

<P>On his dais the Master of the Law read through the<I> Sutra to Give Life and Deliver the Dead,</I> discussed the<I> Heavenly Charm to Protect the Country</I> and preached on the<I> Exhortation to Cultivate Merit.</I> The Bodhisattva went up to the dais, hit it, and shouted out at the top of her voice, &#8220;Why are you only talking about the doctrine of the Little Vehicle, monk? Can you preach about the Great Vehicle?&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing these questions a delighted Xuanzang leapt down from the preaching dais, bowed to the Bodhisattva, and said, &#8220;Venerable teacher, your disciple has sinned grievously in failing to recognize you. We monks who stand before you only preach the law of the Little Vehicle, and we know nothing of the doctrine of the Great Vehicle.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That doctrine of the Little Vehicle of yours will never bring the dead to rebirth; it's only good enough for a vulgar sort of enlightenment. Now I have the Three Stores of the Buddha's Law of the Great Vehicle that will raise the dead up to Heaven, deliver sufferers from their torments, and free souls from the eternal coming and going.&#8221;</p>

<P>As the Bodhisattva was talking, the Master of Incense, an official who patrolled the temple, made an urgent report to the Tang Emperor that just when the Master of the Law was in the middle of preaching the wonderful Law a pair of scabby itinerant monks had dragged him down and were engaging him in wild argument. The Emperor ordered them to be arrested and brought before him, and a crowd of men hustled the two of them into the rear hall of the monastery.</P>
<P>When they saw Taizong they neither raised their hands in greeting nor bowed, but looked him in the eye and said, &#8220;What does Your Majesty want to ask us about.&#8221;</P>
<P>Recognizing them, the Emperor asked, &#8220;Are you not the monk who gave us the cassock?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's right,&#8221; replied the Bodhisattva.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you came here to listen to the preaching you should be satisfied with getting something to eat,&#8221; said Taizong. &#8220;Why did you start ranting at the Master of the Law, disturbing the scripture hall and interfering with our service to the Buddha?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That master of yours was only teaching the doctrine of the Little Vehicle, which will never send the dead up to Heaven,&#8221; replied the Bodhisattva. &#8220;I have the Three Stores of the Buddha's Law of the Great Vehicle, which can save the dead, deliver from suffering, and ensure that the body will live for ever without coming to harm.&#8221; Showing no signs of anger, Taizong earnestly asked where the Buddha's Law of the Great Vehicle was.</P>
<P>&#8220;It is in the Thunder Monastery in the land of India in the West, where our Buddha lives,&#8221; the Bodhisattva replied, &#8220;and it can untie the knots of all injustice and save the innocent from disaster.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Can you remember it?&#8221; the Emperor asked, and the Bodhisattva answered &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Taizong then gave orders that this Master of the Law was to be taken to the dais and invited to preach.</p>

He was the man who later did the pictures of distinguished ministers in the Cloud-piercing Pavilion. Wielding his miraculous brush, he painted a true likeness on the spot.

<P>Before he had finished his question, the Master of the Law came forward, bowed low in greeting, and said, &#8220;Although I am lacking in ability, I would like to offer my humble efforts to fetch the true scriptures for Your Majesty and thus ensure the eternal security of your empire.&#8221; The Tang Emperor, who was overjoyed to hear this, went forward to raise him to his feet.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if you are prepared to exert your loyalty and wisdom to the full, not fearing the length of the journey or the rivers and mountains you will have to cross, I shall make you my own sworn brother.&#8221; Xuanzang kowtowed to thank him. As the Tang Emperor was indeed a man of wisdom and virtue he went to a place before the Buddha in the monastery where he bowed to Xuanzang four times, calling him &#8220;younger brother&#8221; and &#8220;holy monk.&#8221; Xuanzang thanked him effusively.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I have no virtue or talent that fits me for the sacred honour of being treated as your kinsman. On this journey I shall give my all and go straight to the Western Heaven. If I fail to reach there or to obtain the true scriptures, then I shall not return to this country even in death, and shall fall for eternity into Hell.&#8221; He burned incense in front of the Buddha to mark this vow. The happy Emperor ordered his chariot to take him back to the palace; later on an auspicious day would be chosen on which Xuanzang would be given a passport and set out. With that he returned and everyone dispersed.</p>

<p>太宗见了颂子，即命众僧：“且收胜会，待我差人取得大乘经来，再秉丹诚，重修善果。”众官无不遵依。当时在寺中问曰：“谁肯领朕旨意，上西天拜佛求经？”问不了，旁边闪过法师，帝前施礼道：“贫僧不才，愿效犬马之劳，与陛下求取真经，祈保我王江山永固。”唐王大喜，上前将御手扶起道：“法师果能尽此忠贤，不怕程途遥远，跋涉山川，朕情愿与你拜为兄弟。”玄奘顿首谢恩。唐王果是十分贤德，就去那寺里佛前，与玄奘拜了四拜，口称“御弟圣僧”。玄奘感谢不尽道：“陛下，贫僧有何德何能，敢蒙天恩眷顾如此？我这一去，定要捐躯努力，直至西天。如不到西天，不得真经，即死也不敢回国，永堕沉沦地狱。”随在佛前拈香，以此为誓。唐王甚喜，即命回銮，待选良利日辰，发牒出行，遂此驾回各散。</p>

<P>Xuanzang went back to the Hongfu Monastery, where the many monks and his few personal disciples had already heard that he was going to fetch the scriptures. They came to ask if it was true that he had vowed to go to the Western Heaven. On being told by Xuanzang that it was indeed true, his pupils said, &#8220;Teacher, we have heard that the journey to the Western Heaven is a long one, and that there are many tigers, leopards, fiends, and demons on the way. We are afraid that you may lose you life and never come back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have sworn a great vow that I shall fall into Hell for eternity if I do not get the true scriptures,&#8221; replied Xuanzang. &#8220;Besides, as I have been so favored by His Majesty, I shall have to show my loyalty to the utmost if I am to repay the country for his honour. But it will be a journey into the unknown, and there is no saying what my fate will be. My pupils,&#8221; he went on to say, &#8220;two or three years after I set out, or it may be as much as six or seven, that pine tree inside the monastery gate will turn to the East, which will mean that I am coming back. If it does not, you can be sure that I will not return.&#8221; All his disciples committed his words most carefully to memory.</p>

	<p>玄奘亦回洪福寺里。那本寺多僧与几个徒弟，早闻取经之事，都来相见，因问：“发誓愿上西天，实否？”玄奘道：“是实。”他徒弟道：“师父呵，尝闻人言，西天路远，更多虎豹妖魔。只怕有去无回，难保身命。”玄奘道：“我已发了弘誓大愿，不取真经，永堕沉沦地狱。大抵是受王恩宠，不得不尽忠以报国耳。我此去真是渺渺茫茫，吉凶难定。”又道：“徒弟们，我去之后，或三二年，或五七年，但看那山门里松枝头向东，我即回来。不然，断不回矣。”众徒将此言切切而记。</p>

<P>At court the next morning Taizong assembled his civil and military officials and wrote out the document Xuanzang would need to fetch the scriptures, stamping it with the imperial seal that gave the right to travel freely. When an imperial astrologer reported that this day was under an auspicious star for setting out on a long journey, the Tang Emperor was delighted. A eunuch official came in to report, &#8220;The Imperial Younger Brother, the Master of the Law, awaits a summons outside the palace doors.&#8221; Calling him into the throne hall, Taizang said, &#8220;Brother, today is a lucky one for starting on a journey, and here is the pass that will let you through the checkpoints. I am also giving you a golden bowl with which you may beg for food on your journey, in addition to choosing two experienced travelers to accompany you and presenting you with a horse to carry you on your long journey. You may now set out.&#8221; Xuanzang, who was very happy to hear this, thanked the Emperor and took the presents. He was now more eager than ever to be off. Taizong and a host of officials went by carriage to accompany him to the checkpoint. When they got there they found that the monks of the Hongfu Monastery and Xuanzang's own disciples were waiting outside with his summer and winter clothing. As soon as he saw this the Tang Emperor ordered that it be packed and horses be provided, then told an official to pour out some wine. Raising his cup he asked, &#8220;Brother, what is your courtesy name?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As I am not of the world, I do not have one,&#8221; replied Xuanzang. &#8220;The Bodhisattva said yesterday that there are Three Stores<I> (son zang)</I> of scriptures in the Western Heaven. You, brother, should take a courtesy name from this. What about Sanzang?&#8221;</P>
<P>Thanking the Emperor for his kindness, he accepted the cup of wine with the words, &#8220;Your Majesty, liquor is the first of the things from which a monk must abstain, and so I have never drunk it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Today's journey is exceptional,&#8221; Taizong replied, &#8220;and besides, this is a nonalcoholic wine, so you should drink this cup and let us feel that we have seen you off properly.&#8221; Unable to refuse any longer, Sanzang took the wine, and was on the point of drinking it when he saw Taizong bend down, take a pinch of dust in his fingers, and flick it into his cup. Seeing Sanzang's incomprehension, Taizong laughed and said,</P>
<P>&#8220;Dear brother, when will you return from this journey to the Western Heaven?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I shall be back in this country within three years,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;The days and years will be long, the mountains will be high, and the road will lead you far away,&#8221; said Taizong, &#8220;so you should drink this wine to show that you have more love for a pinch of dust from home than fir thousands of ounces of foreign gold.&#8221; Only then did Sanzang understand the significance of the pinch of dust, and thanking the Emperor once more he drained the cup, took his leave of him, and went out through the checkpoint. The Emperor went back to the palace.</P>

<p>次早，太宗设朝，聚集文武，写了取经文牒，用了通行宝印。有钦天监奏曰：“今日是人专吉星，堪宜出行远路。”唐王大喜。又见黄门官奏道：“御弟法师朝门外候旨。”随即宣上宝殿道：“御弟，今日是出行吉日。这是通关文牒。朕又有一个紫金钵盂，送你途中化斋而用。再选两个长行的从者，又银絺的马一匹，送为远行脚力。你可就此行程。”玄奘大喜，即便谢了恩，领了物事，更无留滞之意。唐王排驾，与多官同送至关外，只见那洪福寺僧与诸徒将玄奘的冬夏衣服，俱送在关外相等。唐王见了，先教收拾行囊马匹，然后着官人执壶酌酒。太宗举爵，又问曰：“御弟雅号甚称？”玄奘道：“贫僧出家人，未敢称号。”太宗道：“当时菩萨说，西天有经三藏。御弟可指经取号，号作三藏何如？”玄奘又谢恩，接了御酒道：“陛下，酒乃僧家头一戒，贫僧自为人，不会饮酒。”太宗道：“今日之行，比他事不同。此乃素酒，只饮此一杯，以尽朕奉饯之意。”三藏不敢不受。接了酒，方待要饮，只见太宗低头，将御指拾一撮尘土，弹入酒中。三藏不解其意，太宗笑道：“御弟呵，这一去，到西天，几时可回？”三藏道：“只在三年，径回上国。”太宗道：“日久年深，山遥路远，御弟可进此酒：宁恋本乡一捻土，莫爱他乡万两金。”三藏方悟捻土之意，复谢恩饮尽，辞谢出关而去。唐王驾回。毕竟不知此去何如，且听下回分解。
