<P>It has been told already how Sanzang was seen off at the checkpoint outside Chang'an by the Tang Emperor and a host of officials on the twelfth day of the ninth month in the thirteenth year of<I> Zhen Guan.</I> For two days his horse's hoofs were never still, and he soon reached the Fa Men Monastery, where the abbot came out to meet him at the head of five hundred and more monks drawn up in two lines. Taking Sanzang inside, he greeted him, offered him tea, and then gave him a monastic meal. By the time the meal was over night had fallen.</P>

<P>In the lamplight the monks were discussing the true teachings of the Buddhist faith and the reasons for going to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures. Some said that there would be wide rivers and high mountains to cross, some that there would be many a tiger and leopard along the way, some that the lofty ranges and cliffs would be hard to cross, and some that there would be evil demons and foul fiends difficult to subdue. Sanzang kept his lips sealed; he said nothing, only pointing to his heart and nodding occasionally.</P>
<P>The monks, unable to understand what he meant, put their hands together and asked, &#8220;Why do you point to your heart and nod your head, Master?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When the heart and mind live,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;every kind of evil lives; but when they are extinguished, evil is extinguished too. I made a great vow to the Buddha in the Huasheng Monastery that if I failed to achieve this mission it would not be for lack of trying. I am determined to reach the Western Heaven, where I may see the Buddha and ask for the scriptures, so that the Wheel of the Law may revolve, and our sage Emperor enjoy eternal security.&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing his words the monks all expressed their admiration, saying as if with one voice, &#8220;What a loyal and brave Hierarch.&#8221; With praises still on their lips they invited the Master to go to bed and wished him a peaceful night's sleep.</p>

<p>众僧们灯下议论佛门定旨，上西天取经的原由。有的说水远山高，有的说路多虎豹，有的说峻岭陡崖难度，有的说毒魔恶怪难降。三藏钳口不言，但以手指自心，点头几度。众僧们莫解其意，合掌请问道：“法师指心点头者，何也？”三藏答曰：“心生，种种魔生；心灭，种种魔灭。我弟子曾在化生寺对佛设下洪誓大愿，不由我不尽此心。这一去，定要到西天，见佛求经，使我们法轮回转，愿圣主皇图永固。”众僧闻得此言，人人称羡，个个宣扬，都叫一声“忠心赤胆大阐法师”，夸赞不尽，请师入榻安寐。</p>

<P>Before long the bamboo clappers were sounding for the setting moon, while the cocks greeted the dawn with their crowing. The monks all got up and prepared tea and breakfast. Sanzang put on his cassock and went to worship the Buddha in the main hall.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your disciple Chen Sanzang,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is going to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures, but my fleshly eye is too dim to see the true image of the living Buddha. I now vow that whenever I come across a temple on my journey I shall burn incense; whenever I see a Buddha's image I shall worship it; and whenever I pass a stupa I shall sweep it. My only wish is that Buddha in his mercy will soon appear to me in his golden body and give me the true scriptures to take back and propagate in the land of the East.&#8221; When he had prayed he went back to the abbot's room for breakfast. After breakfast his two attendants saddled the horse and set off at a good pace. At the gate of the monastery Sanzang took his leave of the monks, who were so unwilling to be parted from him that they accompanied him for some three miles before turning back with tears in their eyes, while Sanzang carried on Westwards. It was autumn weather:</P>

<P>When the master and his attendants had been travelling for several days they reached the city of Gongzhou, where all the local officials were waiting to greet them and take them into the city. After a night's rest they set out again the next morning. They ate when they were hungry and drank when they were thirsty, travelling by day and stopping at night. Two or three days later they reached the garrison city of Hezhou, which was on the frontier of the Great Tang Empire. The garrison commander and the local Buddhist monks and priests had all heard that the Master of the Law, the Imperial Younger Brother, was going to the West on His Majesty's orders to see the Buddha, so they were all very respectful. The Director of Monks took him into the city, provided him with all he needed, and invited him spend the night in the Fuyuan Monastery. All the monks of the monastery came to pay their respects to him, and when he had finished the meal they prepared for him he told his attendants to give the horse a good feed as they would be setting out before dawn. As soon as the cocks started to crow he called for his attendants, thus disturbing the monks, who brought him tea and food. When he had eaten he crossed the frontier.</p>

<P>In his impatience Sanzang had got up too soon. As it was late autumn the cocks had crowed very early, and it was still only about two in the morning. The three of them&#8212;four, including the horse&#8212;covered about a dozen miles through the frost, finding their way by the light of the moon, until they saw a large mountain in front of them. They had to push the undergrowth aside as they looked for their way, and the going was indescribably rough and difficult. Just when they were wondering whether they were lost, all three of them and the horse stumbled and fell into a pit.</P>
<P>Sanzang was thrown into a panic, and his attendants were trembling with fear, when to add their terror they heard roars coming from further inside and loud shouts of, &#8220;Get'em! Get'em!&#8221; With a ferocious blast of wind a crowd of fifty or sixty fiends fell upon them and dragged them out. When the shivering and shaking Master of the Law took a stealthy look he saw a thoroughly evil demon king sitting above them. Truly he was</P>

<P>The sight of him frightened Sanzang out of his wits and made his two attendants feel their bones turn to jelly and their muscles go numb. When the demon king roared out an order to tie them up the fiends bound them with rope. He was just on the point of devouring them when a great noise was heard outside and the arrival of Mountain Lord Bear and Hermit Ox was announced. Sanzang looked up and saw that one of them was a dark fellow. Can you imagine what he looked like?</P>

<P>&#8220;Will you be serving them to your friends?&#8221; asked the Hermit with a smile.</P>
<P>&#8220;I should be honoured to,&#8221; answered the demon king.</P>
<P>&#8220;We won't need them all,&#8221; remarked the Mountain Lord. &#8220;We could eat two and keep the third.&#8221; With a &#8220;na-a-aw&#8221; of obedience the demon king told his servants to cut open the two attendants, scoop their hearts out, and chop their bodies into mince. He presented the heads, hearts, and livers to his two guests, eating the limbs himself and dividing the rest of the flesh and bones among the fiends. All that could be heard was a crunching and a munching that sounded just like tigers devouring lambs, and in a few moments it had all been eaten up. Sanzang was almost dead with fright, yet this was only his first tribulation, coming so soon after leaving Chang'an.</p>

<P>In his despair he noticed that the East was beginning to grow light, and when dawn broke the two monsters left, saying, &#8220;We have been handsomely entertained today, and we shall repay your hospitality in full another day.&#8221; With that they both rushed out. A moment later the red sun rose high in the sky, but Sanzang was too befuddled to know where he was. Just when all seemed lost, an old man appeared, walking towards him with the help of a stick. He came up to Sanzang, broke all his bonds with a wave of his hand, and revived him by blowing into his face. Sanzang fell to his knees and bowed low to him, saying, &#8220;Thank you, venerable ancient, for saving my humble life.&#8221;</P>
<P>The old man returned his bow and said, &#8220;Get up. Have you lost anything?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My attendants have been eaten by monsters, and I don't know where my baggage or my horse is,&#8221; replied Sanzang.</P>
<P>The old man pointed with his stick and asked, &#8220;Isn't that a horse with two baggage-rolls over there?&#8221; When Sanzang turned round he saw that his things had not been lost after all, which somewhat relieved his anxiety.</P>
<P>&#8220;Venerable sir,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;What is this place, and how did you get here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is the Double Forked Mountain, where tigers and leopards make their dens. How did you fall in here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I crossed the frontier at the garrison city of Hezhou at cockcrow, not realizing that I had got up too early,&#8221; replied Sanzang. &#8220;Just as we were making our way through frost and dew we suddenly fell into this pit. A dreadfully ferocious demon king appeared and had me and my attendants tied up. Then a dark fellow called Mountain Lord Bear and a fat one called Hermit Ox came in, and they addressed the demon king as General Yin. The three of them ate up my two attendants, and their party only ended at dawn. I cannot imagine why I should have been fated with the good fortune of you coming to rescue me, venerable sir.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The Hermit is a wild bull spirit, the Mountain Lord is a bear spirit, and General Yin is a tiger spirit,&#8221; the old man replied. &#8220;The fiends who serve him are mountain spirits, tree devils, monsters, and wolves. The reason they did not eat you was because your fundamental nature is enlightened. Come with me and I'll show you the way.&#8221; Overcome with gratitude, Sanzang put the packs on his horse and led it by the bridle as he followed the old man out of the pit and on to the main road. Tying the horse to a bush beside the road, he turned round to bow low to the old man and thank him, but the old man changed into a puff of wind and rose into the sky on the back of a red-crested white crane. All that could be seen was a piece of paper drifting down in the wind with four lines of verse written on it:</P>

<P>Sanzang did not spare himself as he pressed ahead amid the mountain peaks. He had been going for many hours without seeing any sign of a human house; he was hungry and finding the going heavy. Just at this critical moment he saw in front of him a pair of ferocious tigers roaring, while two long snakes were coiled up behind him. To his left were venomous reptiles, and to his right were terrible monsters. Being by himself and unable to think of a way out, Sanzang prepared to abandon his mind and body and let Heaven do as it would. Besides, the horse's back was now so tired and its legs so bent that it fell to its knees on the ground and collapsed. Sanzang could not move it, either by blows or by dragging at its bridle.</P>
<P>The poor Master of the Law, who had nowhere to shelter, was feeling thoroughly wretched, convinced that nothing could save him from death. But when his troubles were at their worst someone came to his rescue. Just when all seemed lost he saw the venomous reptiles and the evil monsters flee, while the tigers and the snakes hid themselves. Sanzang looked up and saw a man coming across the hillside with a steel trident in his hand and bow and arrows at his waist. Just look and see what a fine chap he was:</P>

<p>三藏舍身拚命，上了那峻岭之间。行经半日，更不见个人烟村舍。一则腹中饥了，二则路又不平，正在危急之际，只见前面有两只猛虎咆哮，后边有几条长蛇盘绕。左有毒虫，右有怪兽，三藏孤身无策，只得放下身心，听天所命。又无奈那马腰软蹄弯，即便跪下，伏倒在地，打又打不起，牵又牵不动。苦得个法师衬身无地，真个有万分凄楚，已自分必死，莫可奈何。</p>
<p>却说他虽有灾哈，却有救应。正在那不得命处，忽然见毒虫奔走，妖兽飞逃；猛虎潜踪，长蛇隐迹。三藏抬头看时，只见一人，手执钢叉，腰悬弓箭，自那山坡前转出，果然是一条好汉。你看他——</p>

<P>Seeing him approach, Sanzang knelt down beside the path, put his hands together, and shouted at the top of his voice, &#8220;Spare me, bandit king, spare me.&#8221; The man went over to him, put down his trident, and raised him to his feet.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be frightened, venerable monk,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I'm not a bad man; I'm a hunter who lives in these mountains. My name is Liu Boqin and I am known as the warden of the mountain. I came along here because I wanted a couple of animals for the pot. I never expected to meet you here&#8212;I must have offended you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am a monk sent by the Emperor of the Great Tang to visit the Buddha in the Western Heaven and ask for the scriptures,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;I had just got here when I found myself completely surrounded by wolves, tigers, snakes and other creatures, which meant that I could go no further. Then suddenly you appeared, High Warden, and saved my life. Thank you very much indeed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Those of us who live here,&#8221; replied Liu Boqin, &#8220;can only support ourselves by killing tigers and wolves, and catching snakes and other reptiles, which is why all those animals fled in terror from me. As you are from the Tang Empire, we are compatriots. This is still the territory of the Great Tang, and I am a Tang citizen. Both of us depend on the Emperor's lands and rivers for our food and drink, and we are fellow-countrymen, so there is nothing to fear. You must come with me to my hut, and your horse can rest. I'll take you on your way tomorrow.&#8221; Sanzang, who was delighted to hear this, thanked him and went along behind him, leading the horse.</p>

<p>三藏见他来得渐近，跪在路旁，合掌高叫道：“大王救命，大王救命！”那条汉到跟前，放下钢叉，用手搀起道：“长老休怕。我不是歹人，我是这山中的猎户，姓刘名伯钦，绰号镇山太保。我才自来，要寻两只山虫食用，不期遇著你，多有冲撞。”三藏道：“贫僧是大唐驾下钦差往西天拜佛求经的和尚。适间来到此处，遇著些狼虎蛇虫，四边围绕，不能前进。忽见太保来，众兽皆走，救了贫僧性命，多谢，多谢！”伯钦道：“我在这里住人，专倚打些狼虎为生，捉些蛇虫过活，故此众兽怕我走了。你既是唐朝来的，与我都是乡里。此间还是大唐的地界，我也是唐朝的百姓，我和你同食皇王的水土，诚然是一国之人。你休怕，跟我来，到我舍下歇马，明朝我送你上路。”三藏闻言，满心欢喜，谢了伯钦，牵马随行。</p>

<P>When they had crossed the mountainside they heard a sound like the howling of a wind. &#8220;Sit down here and don't move, venerable monk,&#8221; said Boqin. &#8220;That noise like a wind means that a mountain cat is coming. Just wait a moment while I catch it, then I can take it home to feed you with.&#8221; This news so terrified Sanzang that he dared not move. The high warden was striding forward, brandishing his trident, to meet the animal, when a striped tiger appeared in front of him. At the sight of Liu Boqin the animal turned to flee, but the high warden let out a thunderclap of a shout: &#8220;Where d'you think you're going, wretch?&#8221; When the tiger realized that Liu Boqin was in hot pursuit, it turned and charged him, baring its claws. The high warden raised his trident to meet his opponent. At the sight of all this Sanzang collapsed on the grass, paralyzed with fear; never had he seen anything so terrifying in all his born days. The tiger and the high warden fought a magnificent battle under the mountain:</P>

<div class="right">
<p>过了山坡，又听得呼呼风响。伯钦道：“长老休走，坐在此间。风响处，是个山猫来了。等我拿他家去管待你。”三藏见说，又胆战心惊，不敢举步。那太保执了钢叉，拽开步，迎将上去。只见一只斑斓虎，对面撞见。他看见伯钦，急回头就走。这太保霹雳一声，咄道：“那业畜，那里走！”那虎见赶得急，转身轮爪扑来。这太保三股叉举手迎敌，唬得个三藏软瘫在草地。这和尚自出娘肚皮，那曾见这样凶险的勾当？太保与那虎在那山坡下，人虎相持，果是一场好斗。但见——</p>

<P>After the pair of them had been fighting for about two hours the tiger's claws began to slacken as it grew tired, and just then the high warden smote him full in the chest with his trident. Its points pierced the animal's liver and heart, a pitiful sight. Within an instant the ground was covered with its blood as the hunter dragged it along the path by its ears. What a man! Without panting, and with his expression unchanged, he said to Sanzang, &#8220;What a piece of luck. This mountain cat will be enough! to feed you for a whole day.&#8221; Sanzang was full of praise for him.</P>
<P>&#8220;High Warden, you really are a mountain god.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It was nothing,&#8221; said Liu Boqin, &#8220;so please don't exaggerate. This is all the result of your blessings. Come on, let's skin it and boil up some of its meat as soon as we can so as to get you fed.&#8221; Holding his trident in one hand and dragging the tiger with the other he led the way, while Sanzang followed, leading his horse.

<P>When he reached the gate, the high warden Liu Boqin threw down the tiger and shouted, &#8220;Where are you, lads?&#8221; Three or four servants of strange and repulsive appearance came out, and with much pulling and tugging they carried the tiger in. Boqin told them to skin it at once and prepare it to offer to their guest, then turned round to welcome Sanzang in. When they had formally greeted each other Sanzang bowed to Boqin to thank him for taking pity on him and saving his life.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why bother to thank me? We're fellow countrymen.&#8221; When Sanzang had been offered a seat and served with tea, an old woman came out to greet him followed by a young one. Liu Boqin explained that they were his mother and his wife.</P>
<P>&#8220;Madam, please take the highest seat while I bow to you,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;You are a guest from afar, venerable monk, so let us each preserve our dignity and neither bow to the other,&#8221; the old woman replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; said Liu Boqin, &#8220;he has been sent by His Majesty the Tang Emperor to go to the Western Heaven to see the Buddha and fetch the scriptures. I met him on the mountain, and I thought that as we were fellow-countrymen I should invite him home to rest before I take him on his way tomorrow.&#8221; The old woman was delighted.</P>
<P>&#8220;Good, good,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But it would be even better to ask him to stay longer. Tomorrow is the anniversary of your father's passing away, and I would like to trouble the venerable monk to say some prayers and read a sutra for him; you could take him on his way the day after.&#8221; Although this Boqin was a tiger-killer and the high warden of the mountain, he was a dutiful son, and when he heard this suggestion he made ready paper and incense and asked Sanzang to stay.</p>

<P>While they talked they had not noticed the evening drawing in. The servants set out a table and stools, then brought in several dishes of tender tiger-meat, which they placed steaming hot on the table. Liu Boqin asked Sanzang to help himself while he served the rice. Putting his hands together in front of his chest, Sanzang replied, &#8220;This is wonderful, but I must tell you frankly that I have been a monk ever since I left my mother's womb, so I am quite unable to eat meat.&#8221; Boqin thought for a while before replying, &#8220;Venerable monk, our family has not eaten vegetarian food for generations. When we cut bamboo shoots, pick fungus, gather wild vegetables for drying, or make bean-curd we always cook them in the fat of roebuck, deer, tiger or leopard, so even they aren't really vegetarian; and our two cooking pots are steeped in fat, so what are we to do? I'm afraid it was wrong of me to ask you here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no need to worry,&#8221; Sanzang answered. &#8220;Please go ahead and eat. I'd go without food for four or five days, or even starve, rather than break the monastic rule about vegetarian food.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But we can't have you starving to death,&#8221; protested Liu Boqin.</P>
<P>&#8220;Thanks to your great kindness, High Warden, I was saved from the packs of tigers and wolves. Even if I were to starve to death, it would be better than providing a meal for tigers.&#8221;</P>
<P>Liu Boqin's mother, who had been listening to their conversation, said, &#8220;Don't talk nonsense, son. I've got some vegetarian things that we can offer to him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where did you get them from?&#8221; Liu Boqin asked, to which mother replied, &#8220;Never you mind how, but I've got them.&#8221; She told her daughter-in-law to take down the little cooking-pot, burn the fat out of it, scrub it and wash it several times over, then put it back on the stove. Then they half filled it with boiling water that they threw away. Next she poured boiling water on mountain-elm leaves to make tea, boiled up some millet, and cooked some dried vegetables. This was then all put into two bowls and set on the table. Then the old woman said to Sanzang, &#8220;Please eat, venerable monk. This is completely pure tea and food that I and my daughter-in-law have prepared.&#8221; Sanzang thanked them and sat down in the seat of honour. Another place was laid for Liu Boqin, where were set out bowls and dishes full of the meat of tiger, roebuck, snake, fox, and hare, as well as dried venison, all cooked without salt or sauce, which he was going to eat while Sanzang had his vegetarian meal. He had just sat down and was on the point of picking up his chopsticks when he noticed Sanzang put his hands together to recite some scripture, which so alarmed him that instead of picking up his chopsticks he stood beside him. When Sanzang had recited a few lines he urged Boqin to eat.</P>
<P>&#8220;Are you a short-sutra monk then?&#8221; Boqin asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;That wasn't a sutra, it was a grace before eating.&#8221;</p>

<p>说话间，不觉的天色将晚。小的们排开桌凳，拿几盘烂熟虎肉，热腾腾的放在上面。伯钦请三藏权用，再另办饭。三藏合掌当胸道：“善哉！贫僧不瞒太保说，自出娘胎，就做和尚，更不晓得吃荤。”伯钦闻得此说，沉吟了半晌道：“长老，寒家历代以来，不晓得吃素。就是有些竹笋，采些木耳，寻些干菜，做些豆腐，也都是獐鹿虎豹的油煎，却无甚素处。有两眼锅灶，也都是油腻透了，这等奈何？反是我请长老的不是。”三藏道：“太保不必多心，请自受用。我贫僧就是三五日不吃饭，也可忍饿，只是不敢破了斋戒。”伯钦道：“倘或饿死，却如之何？”三藏道：“感得太保天恩，搭救出虎狼丛里，就是饿死，也强如喂虎。”伯钦的母亲闻说，叫道：“孩儿不要与长老闲讲，我自有素物，可以管待。”伯钦道：“素物何来？”母亲道：“你莫管我，我自有素的。”叫媳妇将小锅取下，着火烧了油腻，刷了又刷，洗了又洗，却仍安在灶上。先烧半锅滚水别用，却又将些山地榆叶子，着水煎作茶汤，然后将些黄粱粟米，煮起饭来。又把些干菜煮熟，盛了两碗，拿出来铺在桌上。老母对着三藏道：“长老请斋，这是老身与儿妇，亲自动手整理的些极洁极净的茶饭。”三藏下来谢了，方才上坐。那伯钦另设一处，铺排些没盐没酱的老虎肉、香獐肉、蟒蛇肉、狐狸肉、兔肉，点剁鹿肉干巴，满盘满碗的，陪着三藏吃斋。方坐下，心欲举箸，只见三藏合掌诵经，唬得个伯钦不敢动箸，急起身立在旁边。三藏念不数句，却教“请斋”。伯钦道：“你是个念短头经的和尚？”三藏道：“此非是经，乃是一卷揭斋之咒。”伯钦道：“你们出家人，偏有许多计较，吃饭便也念诵念诵。”</p>
<P>&#8220;You get up to all sorts of tricks. Fancy reciting sutras at mealtimes,&#8221; was Boqin's comment.</P>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<P>When the meal was over and the dishes had been cleared away, Liu Boqin invited Sanzang out into the gathering darkness for a stroll at the back. They went along an alley and came to a thatched hut. On pushing the door open and going in Sanzang saw bows and crossbows hanging on the walls and quivers filled with arrows. From the beams were slung two gory and stinking tiger-skins, and at the foot of the wall were stood many spears, swords, tridents and clubs. In the middle were two seats. Liu Boqin urged Sanzang to sit down, but Sanzang could not bear to stay there long among the horrifying filth, and so he went outside. Going further to the back they came to a large garden full of clumps of yellow chrysanthemums and red maple-trees. Then with a whinnying noise about a dozen plump deer and a large herd of roebuck ran out; they were docile and unfrightened on seeing humans.</P>
<P>&#8220;Were those roebuck and deer raised by you?&#8221; asked Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Boqin. &#8220;When you Chang'an people have some money you buy valuables, and when you have land you accumulate grain; but we hunters can only keep a few wild animals for a rainy day.&#8221; Dusk had fallen unnoticed as the two of them talked, and now they went back to the house to sleep.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>吃了斋饭，收了盘碗，渐渐天晚，伯钦引着三藏出中宅，到后边走走。穿过夹道，有一座草亭，推开门，入到里面。只见那四壁上挂几张强弓硬弩，插几壶箭，过梁上搭两块血腥的虎皮，墙根头插着许多枪刀叉棒，正中间设两张坐器。伯钦请三藏坐坐。三藏见这般凶险腌脏，不敢久坐，遂出了草亭。又往后再行，是一座大园子，却看不尽那丛丛菊蕊堆黄，树树枫杨挂赤；又见呼的一声，跑出十来只肥鹿，一大阵黄獐，见了人，呢呢痴痴，更不恐惧。三藏道：“这獐鹿想是太保养家了的？”伯钦道：“似你那长安城中人家，有钱的集财宝，有庄的集聚稻粮。我们这打猎的，只得聚养些野兽，备天阴耳。”他两个说话闲行，不觉黄昏，复转前宅安歇。</p>
</div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<P>Early the next morning the whole family, young and old, got up and prepared vegetarian food for the monk, and then they asked him to start reciting sutras. Sanzang washed his hands, went to the family shrine of the high warden, burned incense there, and worshipped, then beat his &#8220;wooden fish&#8221; as he recited first a prayer to purify his mouth, then a holy spell to purify his body and mind, and finally the<I> Sutra to Deliver the Dead.</I> When he had finished, Boqin asked him to write out a letter of introduction for the dead man and also recite the<I> Diamond Sutra</I> and the<I> Guanyin Sutra.</I> Sanzang recited them in a loud, clear voice and then ate lunch, after which he read out the several chapters of the<I> Lotus Sutra,</I> the<I> Amitabha Sutra,</I> as well as one chapter of the<I> Peacock Sutra</I> and told the story of the cleansing of the bhikshu. By now it was dark, and when they had burned all kinds of incense, paper money, and paper horses for all the gods, and the letter of introduction for the dead man, the service was over and everyone went to bed and slept soundly.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>次早，那合家老小都起来，就整素斋，管待长老，请开启念经。这长老净了手，同太保家堂前拈了香，拜了家堂。三藏方敲响木鱼，先念了净口业的真言，又念了净身心的神咒，然后开《度亡经》一卷。诵毕，伯钦又请写荐亡疏一道，再开念《金刚经》、《观音经》，一一朗音高诵。诵毕，吃了午斋，又念《法华经》、《弥陀经》。各诵几卷，又念一卷《孔雀经》，及谈较洗业的故事，早又天晚。献过了种种香火，化了众神纸马，烧了荐亡文疏。佛事已毕，又各安寝。</p>

He said that he had suffered long in the underworld, and couldn't find deliverance. Now that the saintly monk has wiped out his sins by reading some scriptures, King Yama has had him sent back to the rich land of China to be reborn in an important family.

<P>&#8220;I had a dream just like yours,&#8221; replied Liu Boqin. &#8220;Let's go and tell mother about it.&#8221; As they were on the point of doing this they heard his mother shout, &#8220;Come here, Boqin my son. There's something I want to tell you.&#8221; The two of them went in to her to find the old woman sitting on the bed.</P>
<P>&#8220;My child, I had a happy dream last night. Your father came home and said that thanks to his salvation by the venerable monk, his sins have been wiped out and he has gone to be reborn in an important family in the rich land of China.&#8221; Husband and wife laughed for joy and her son said, &#8220;I and my wife both had this dream, and we were just coming to tell you when you called to us. So now it turns out that you it too.&#8221; They told everyone in the house to get up to thank Sanzang and get his horse loaded and ready. They all bowed to him and he said, &#8220;Many thanks, venerable monk, for recommending my father for delivery from his sufferings and for rebirth. We can never repay this debt of gratitude.&#8221;</p>

<p>那合家儿梦醒，又早太阳东上，伯钦的娘子道：“太保，我今夜梦见公公来家，说他在阴司苦难难脱，日久不得超生。今幸得圣僧念了经卷，消了他的罪业，阎王差人送他上中华富地长者人家托生去，教我们好生谢那长老，不得怠慢。他说罢，径出门，徉徜去了。我们叫他不应，留他不住，醒来却是一梦。”伯钦道：“我也是那等一梦，与你一般。我们起去对母亲说去。”他两口子正欲去说，只见老母叫道：“伯钦孩儿，你来，我与你说话。”二人至前，老母坐在床上道：“儿呵，我今夜得了个喜梦，梦见你父亲来家，说多亏了长老超度，已消了罪业，上中华富地长者家去托生。”夫妻们俱呵呵大笑道：“我与媳妇皆有此梦，正来告禀，不期母亲呼唤，也是此梦。”遂叫一家大小起来，安排谢意，替他收拾马匹，都至前拜谢道：“多谢长老超荐我亡父脱难超生，报答不尽！”</p>

<P>&#8220;What powers have I that you should thank me?&#8221; replied Sanzang.</P>
<P>Boqin told him about what the three of them had been told in their dreams, and Sanzang was happy too. Then they gave him his breakfast and an ounce of silver as an expression of their thanks, but he would not take a single penny of it, although the whole family begged and beseeched him to do so.</P>
<P>&#8220;If in your mercy you could escort me for the next stage of my journey I would be deeply touched,&#8221; he said. All that Boqin, his mother, and his wife could do then was to prepare some scones of coarse wheaten flour as his provisions, and make sure that Boqin escorted him a long way. Sanzang gladly accepted the food. On his mother's orders the high warden told two or three servants to bring hunting gear as they set off together along the road. They saw no end of wild mountain scenery.</p>

<div class="right">
<p>三藏道：“贫僧有何能处，敢劳致谢！”伯钦把三口儿的梦话，对三藏陈诉一遍，三藏也喜。早供给了素斋，又具白银一两为谢。三藏分文不受。一家儿又恳恳拜央，三藏毕竟分文未受，但道：“是你肯发慈悲送我一程，足感至爱。”伯钦与母妻无奈，急做了些粗面烧饼干粮，叫伯钦远送，三藏欢喜收纳。太保领了母命，又唤两三个家僮，各带捕猎的器械，同上大路，看不尽那山中野景，岭上风光。</p>

<P>When they had been travelling for some time they saw a mountain in front of them, a high and precipitous one that towered right up to the azure sky. Before long they had reached its base. The high warden climbed it as if he were walking on level ground, and when they were half-way over it he turned round, stood beside the path and said, &#8220;Venerable monk, I must ask you to take yourself on from here. I have to go back.&#8221; On hearing this Sanzang tumbled out of his saddle to say, &#8220;Please, please, take me another stage, High Warden.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't seem to know that this is called Double Boundary Mountain,&#8221; said the high warden. The Eastern part belongs to our Great Tang, but the Western parts is Tatar territory. The tigers and wolves on that side are not subject to my control, which is why I can't cross the boundary. You mast go on by yourself. The monk was so alarmed to hear this that he waved his arms around and grabbed hold of the hunter's clothes and sleeves, weeping and refusing to let him go. When at last Sanzang was bowing repeatedly to the hunter to take his leave, a shout like thunder came from under the mountain: &#8220;My master's come, my master's come.&#8221; Sanzang stood frozen with fear at the sound of it, and Boqin had to hold him up. If you don't know who it was who shouted, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>行经半日，只见对面处，有一座大山，真个是高接青霄，崔巍险峻。三藏不一时，到了边前。那太保登此山如行平地。正走到半山之中，伯钦回身，立于路下道：“长老，你自前进，我却告回。”三藏闻言，滚鞍下马道：“千万敢劳太保再送一程！”伯钦道：“长老不知，此山唤做两界山，东半边属我大唐所管，西半边乃是鞑靼的地界。那厢狼虎，不伏我降，我却也不能过界，你自去罢。”三藏心惊，轮开手，牵衣执袂，滴泪难分。正在那叮咛拜别之际，只听得山脚下叫喊如雷道：“我师父来也，我师父来也！”唬得个三藏痴呆，伯钦打挣。毕竟不知是甚人叫喊，且听下回分解。
