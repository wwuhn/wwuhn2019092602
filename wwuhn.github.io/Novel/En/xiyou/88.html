<P>When Heaven Is Offended in Fengxian It Stops the Rain</P>
<P>The Great Sage Urges Goodness and Brings a Downpour</P>
</div>
<P>Deep and mysterious is the Great Way;</P>
<P>What news is there of it?</P>
<P>When revealed it will alarm ghosts and divine beings.</P>
<P>It controls the universe,</P>
<P>Divides darkness and light;</P>
<P>In the world of true happiness there is no competition.</P>
<P>Before the Vulture Peak</P>
<P>Pearls and jewels emerge,</P>
<P>Shining with every color.</P>
<P>It illuminates all beings that live between heaven and earth;</P>
<P>Those who understand it live as long as mountains and seas.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story tells how Sanzang and his three disciples took their leave of the woodcutter on the Hidden Clouds Mountain and hurried along the main road. After they had been going for several days they suddenly saw a walled and moated city not far before them.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;is that city ahead of us India, do you think?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; said Monkey shaking his head. &#8220;Although the Tathagata lives in a paradise there are no cities there. It's a great mountain, Vulture Peak, on which are the high buildings and halls of Thunder Monastery. Even if we've now reached the land of India this isn't where the Buddha lives. I don't know how far India is from Vulture Peak. Presumably this city is one of the frontier prefectures of India. We'll know when we get there.&#8221;</P>
<P>Soon they were outside the city, where Sanzang dismounted to go in through the triple gates. Here they found the people destitute and the streets deserted. When they reached the market there were many black-clad government servants lined up on either side of a number of officials wearing their hats and sashes of office and standing under the eaves of a building. As the four travelers came along the road these men did not give way at all, so Pig in his rough way raised his snout and shouted, &#8220;Out of the way! Out of the way!&#8221;</P>
<P>When the men looked up with a start and saw what he looked like their bones went soft, their sinews turned numb and they fell over, shouting, &#8220;Evil spirits! Evil spirits!&#8221;</P>
<P>This gave the officials standing under the eaves such a fright that they were shivering as they bowed and asked, &#8220;Where are you from?&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang, who was worried that his disciples would cause trouble, pushed himself forward and said to the men, &#8220;I am a monk sent by His Majesty the Great Tang emperor to worship the Lord Buddha and fetch the scriptures in the Great Thunder Monastery in the land of India. Our journey brings us to this distinguished place, but as we do not know its name and have not yet found a place to stay we hope that you gentlemen will forgive us if we have caused any offence to your customs on entering your city.&#8221;</P>
<P>Only then did the officials return his courtesy and say, &#8220;This is the prefecture of Fengxian, one of the frontier prefectures of India. Because we have been suffering from drought for years on end the marquis has sent us to put up a notice here calling for masters of the Dharma to pray for rain and save the people.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where's the notice?&#8221; asked Monkey when he heard this.</P>
<P>&#8220;Here,&#8221; the officials said. &#8220;The arcade has only just been swept clean: we haven't posted it yet.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Bring it here and show me,&#8221; said Brother Monkey. The officials then opened the notice out and hung it up under the eaves. Monkey and the others went up to read it, and this was what was written on it:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Shangguan, Marquis of Fengxian Prefecture in Great India, issues this notice to invite enlightened teachers and great masters of the Dharma. This country with its prosperous soldiers and people has been afflicted with drought for years. Military and civil land alike has been devastated; the rivers have dried up and the ditches are empty. There is no water in the wells, and the springs have stopped flowing. While the rich are barely managing to stay alive, the poor cannot survive. A bushel of wheat costs a hundred pieces of silver; a bundle of firewood costs five ounces. Girls of ten are being sold for three pints of rice; boys of five are being given to whoever will take them. Because the city dwellers fear the law they pawn their clothes to buy the necessities for survival; but in the countryside thugs rob and eat people in order to live. I have therefore issued this notice in the hope that wise and worthy men from all around will pray for rain to save the people. The will be richly rewarded for their kindness with a thousand pieces of silver. This is no empty promise. Let those who would take it up come to this notice.</P>
<P>When he had read it Monkey asked the officials, &#8220;What's Shangguan?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Shangguan is our marquis' surname,&#8221; they replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's a very rare surname,&#8221; said Monkey with a laugh.</P>
<P>&#8220;You've never been to school, brother,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;There's a bit at the end of the book<I> The Hundred Surnames</I> that goes 'Ouyang and Shangguan.'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop this idle chatter, disciples,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;If any of you know how to pray for rain, bring them a fall of timely rain and save the people from this affliction: that would be a very good thing indeed to do. If you cannot, we must be on our way and waste no more time.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What's so difficult about praying for rain?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;I can turn rivers upside down, stir up the sea, move the stars and constellations about, kick the sky, churn up water in wells, breathe out mist and clouds, carry mountains, drive the moon along and summon wind and rain. They're all child's play. Nothing to them!&#8221;</P>
<P>When the officials heard this they sent two of their number straight to the prefectural offices to report, &#8220;Your Excellency, something very splendid indeed has happened.&#8221;</P>
<P>The marquis, who was burning incense and praying silently at the time, asked what it was when he heard that something splendid had happened. &#8220;We were taking the notice to post at the entrance to the market,&#8221; the officials replied, &#8220;when four monks came along who said that they have been sent by the Great Tang in the East to the Great Thunder Monastery in India to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures. As soon as they read the notice they said they could bring timely rain, which is why we have come here to report.&#8221;</P>
<P>Refusing to take a sedan-chair, horse or large retinue, the marquis went on foot in his robes of office straight to the entrance to the market in order to invite the strangers with the utmost courtesy to pray for rain.</P>
<P>&#8220;His Excellency the marquis is here,&#8221; it was suddenly announced, and everybody moved out of the way.</P>
<P>As soon as he saw the Tang Priest the marquis, who showed no fear of his hideous disciples, prostrated himself in the middle of the street and said, &#8220;I am Marquis Shangguan of Fengxian Prefecture, and I have bathed and perfumed myself in order to beg you teachers to pray for the rain that will save the people. I implore you in your great mercy to give play to your divine powers and bring us deliverance.&#8221;</P>
<P>Returning his courtesies, Sanzang said, &#8220;This is no place to talk. We will be able to act when we have gone to a monastery.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please come with me to my humble palace,&#8221; the marquis replied. &#8220;We have a pure place there.&#8221;</P>
<P>Master and disciples then led the horse and carried the luggage straight to the palace, where they all exchanged greetings and the marquis ordered tea and a vegetarian meal. When the food arrived a little later Pig ate for all he was worth like a hungry tiger, terrifying the waiters, who trembled as they kept coming and going with more and more soup and rice. They looked like the figures on one of those revolving lanterns, and they could just keep him supplied until he had eaten his fill. Only then did he stop.</P>
<P>When the meal was over the Tang Priest expressed his thanks then asked, &#8220;How long has the drought lasted here, Your Excellency?&#8221; To this the marquis replied,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is a part of the great land of India,</P>
<P>Fengxian Prefecture of which I am governor.</P>
<P>For three years on end we have suffered from drought:</P>
<P>Grass does not grow, and the grain has all died.</P>
<P>Business is hard for rich and for poor;</P>
<P>Nearly all of the families are weeping with grief.</P>
<P>Two thirds of the people have now died of starvation;</P>
<P>The rest barely survive, like a candle flame in the wind.</P>
<P>I have issued a notice for worthies</P>
<P>And am lucky you monks have come to our land.</P>
<P>If you bring the people a whole inch of rain</P>
<P>A thousand in silver will be your reward.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this his face showed his pleasure as he chuckled, &#8220;Don't say that, don't say that. If you promise us a reward of a thousand pieces of silver you won't get a single drop of rain. But if you put it in terms of accumulating merit I'll provide you with plenty of rain.&#8221;</P>
<P>The marquis, a thoroughly upright and good man who cared deeply for his people, invited Monkey to take the seat of honour, then bowed to him and said, &#8220;Teacher, if you really can show us this great compassion this humble official will do nothing to offend against morality.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please get up,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;only look after my master well while I do the job.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How are you going to do it, brother?&#8221; asked Friar Sand. &#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You and Pig are to must come here and be my assistants outside while I summon a dragon to make rain,&#8221; Monkey replied. Pig and Friar Sand did as he bade them, and while the three of them went outside the marquis burned incense and prayed. Sanzang sat there reciting sutras.</P>
<P>While Monkey recited the spell and said the magic words a dark cloud appeared to the East and slowly moved till it was in front of the hall: it was Ao Guang, the ancient dragon of the Eastern Sea. Ao Guang then put away his cloud feet and turned himself into human form to go up to Monkey, bow low to him with full courtesy and ask, &#8220;What have you sent for this humble dragon to do, Great Sage?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please rise,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;The only reason why I have troubled you to make this long journey is because there has been a drought in this prefecture of Fengxian for years on end. I'd like to ask you if you couldn't send some rain.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I must inform you, Great Sage,&#8221; the dragon replied, &#8220;that although I can make rain I can only act on the orders of Heaven. I would never dare come here to make rain on my own authority without Heaven's instructions.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As our journey brought us this way I asked you specially to come here to make rain and save the people,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;so why are you trying to get out of it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'd never dare,&#8221; the dragon king replied. &#8220;I came because you summoned me with the magic words, Great Sage, and I'd never dare try to get out of it. In the first place I haven't had an edict from Heaven, and secondly I haven't brought the magic rain-making generals with me. How could I, Great Sage? If you wish to be a savior, you must let me go back to the sea to muster my forces while you go to the heavenly palace to obtain an imperial edict for a fall of rain and ask the officials in charge of water to release us dragons, so that I can make rain in the quantities ordered.&#8221;</P>
<P>Accepting the force of his argument, Brother Monkey had to let the old dragon go back to the sea. He then told the Tang Priest what the dragon king had said.</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case you had better go and do that,&#8221; the Tang Priest said. &#8220;But don't be telling lies.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey then told Pig and Friar Sand to look after the master while he went up to the heavenly palace. No sooner had the splendid Great Sage said he was going than he was out of sight.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where has Lord Sun gone?&#8221; the marquis asked, trembling with shock.</P>
<P>&#8220;He's gone up to Heaven on a cloud,&#8221; replied Pig with a grin. With great reverence the marquis then issued an urgent order that all the people in the big and little streets of the city, whether nobility, high officials, gentry, commoners, soldiers or civilians, were to worship dragon-king tablets and set out water urns with sprigs of willow in them in front of their gates. They were also to burn incense and pray to Heaven.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Once on his somersault cloud Monkey went straight to the Western Gate of Heaven, where the Heavenly King Lokapala soon appeared at the head of his heavenly soldiers and warriors to greet him and say, &#8220;Great Sage, have you fetched the scriptures yet?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Quite soon now,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;We've reached a frontier prefecture called Fengxian on the borders of India now. It hasn't rained for three whole years there, and the people are suffering terribly. I want to pray for rain to save them. I sent for the dragon king, but he told me that he couldn't do it on his own authority without a heavenly order, which is why I've come to see the Jade Emperor to request an edict.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I don't think it's supposed to rain there,&#8221; the heavenly king said. &#8220;I heard just now that the marquis of Fengxian had behaved disgracefully and offended both Heaven and Earth. His Majesty took it badly and immediately had a rice mountain, a flour mountain and a huge gold lock set up. It won't rain till all three have been knocked over or snapped.&#8221; Not understanding what all this was about, Monkey demanded to see the Jade Emperor, and, not daring to stop him, the heavenly king let him in.</P>
<P>Going straight to the Hall of Universal Brightness, Brother Monkey was met by the four heavenly teachers, who asked, &#8220;What are you here for, Great Sage?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;On my journey escorting the Tang Priest I've reached Fengxian Prefecture on the frontiers of India, where there is a drought,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;The marquis there has been asking for magicians to pray for rain. I sent for the dragon king to order him to make rain, but he said that he could not do so on his own authority without an edict from the Jade Emperor. I have now come to request an edict in order to relieve the people's suffering.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But it's not supposed to rain there,&#8221; said the four heavenly teachers.</P>
<P>&#8220;As to whether it's supposed to rain or not,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile, &#8220;could I trouble you to take me in to submit a memorial so that I can find out whether I can still get a favour done?&#8221;</P>
<P>To this the heavenly teacher Ge Xianweng replied, &#8220;As the saying goes, 'a fly that needs a net for a veil&#8212;what a nerve!'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't talk nonsense,&#8221; said Xu of Jingyang. &#8220;Just take him in.&#8221;</P>
<P>Qiu Hongji, Zhang Daoling, Ge and Xu took Monkey to the outside of the Hall of Miraculous Mist, where they reported, &#8220;Your Majesty, Sun Wukong has reached Fengxian Prefecture in India and wants to obtain rain. He has come to ask for an edict.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Three years ago,&#8221; the Jade Emperor replied, &#8220;on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, when we were inspecting the myriad heavens and travelling through the three worlds, we arrived at his city. We saw that Shangguan was most wicked; he knocked over the vegetarian offerings to heaven to feed to dogs, spoke foully, and was guilty of lese-majeste. That is why we set up those three things in the Hall of Fragrance. Take Sun Wukong to see them. When those three things have been accomplished we will issue our edict; but if they are not, then do not meddle in what does not concern you.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the four heavenly teachers led Brother Monkey to the Hall of Fragrance he saw a mountain of rice about a hundred feet high and a mountain of flour about two hundred feet high. Beside the rice mountain was a chicken the size of a fist eating the rice, sometimes with quick pecks, sometimes with slow ones. Beside the flour mountain was a golden-haired Pekinese licking the flour, sometimes with long licks and sometimes with short ones. To the left of it a golden padlock about one foot three or four inches long hung from an iron frame. The crossbar of the lock was about the thickness of a finger, and under it was a lamp, the flame of which was heating the bar.</P>
<P>Not understanding what all this was about, Monkey turned back to ask the heavenly teachers, &#8220;What does it mean?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When that wretch offended Heaven the Jade Emperor had these three things set up,&#8221; the heavenly teachers replied. &#8220;That place will only be due for rain when the chicken has eaten all the rice, the dog has licked up all the flour, and the lamp has melted the bar of the lock.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he went pale with shock, and he dared make no more memorials to the throne. He left the palace hall overcome with embarrassment. &#8220;Don't take it so badly, Great Sage,&#8221; said the four heavenly teachers with smiles. &#8220;This is something that can be resolved through goodness. Once a single kind thought moves Heaven the rice and flour mountains will collapse and the bar of the padlock will be broken. If you can persuade the marquis to return to goodness then blessings will come of themselves.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey accepted their advice, and instead of going back to the Hall of Miraculous Mist to take his leave of the Jade Emperor he headed straight down to the lower world and its ordinary mortals. Within an instant he was at the Western Gate of Heaven, where he saw Heavenly King Lokapala again, who asked, &#8220;Did you get the decree you wanted?&#8221; Monkey told him about the rice and flour mountains and the metal lock.</P>
<P>&#8220;What you said to me was quire right,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;The Jade Emperor refuses to issue a decree. Just now the heavenly teachers told me as they saw me off that the secret of blessings lay in persuading that so-and-so to return to goodness.&#8221; With that Monkey took his leave and went down to the lower world on his cloud.</P>
<P>When the marquis, Sanzang, Pig, Friar Sand and the officials high and low all welcomed him back they crowded round him asking questions. Monkey then shouted at the marquis, &#8220;It's all because on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month three years ago you offended Heaven and Earth that the people are suffering, you wretch. That's why rain won't be sent now.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this the marquis was so alarmed that he fell to his knees, prostrated himself on the ground and asked, &#8220;How do you know about what happened three years ago, teacher?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why did you knock the vegetarian offerings to Heaven over to feed to dogs?&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;You'd better tell me the truth.&#8221;</P>
<P>Not daring to conceal anything, the marquis said, &#8220;On the twenty-fifth of the twelfth month three years ago I was making offerings to Heaven within the palace. As my wife was wicked we quarreled and said bad things to each other. In an unthinking outburst of fury I knocked over the table with the offerings and scattered the vegetarian food. It's true that I called the dogs to eat it up. I never realized that Heaven would take offence at this and harm the common people. For the last couple of years it has been preying on my mind. My thoughts have been disturbed, and I haven't been able to understand why. I never realized that it was because Heaven had taken offence that it was inflicting this disaster on the common people. Now that you have come down to visit us, teacher, I beg you to enlighten me on what the upper world intends to do.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That happened to be a day on which the Jade Emperor was visiting the lower world,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;When he saw you feed the vegetarian food to the dogs and heard your foul language the Jade Emperor set three things up to remember you by.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What three things, brother?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;In the Hall of Fragrance he had set up a rice mountain about a hundred feet high and a flour mountain about two hundred feet high. Beside the rice mountain is a chicken the size of a fist who's eating it with quick pecks and slow pecks. Beside the flour mountain is a golden-haired Pekinese licking the flour up with long licks and short licks. And to the left is an iron frame from which hangs a golden padlock with a crossbar the thickness of a finger under which a lamp is burning and warming the bar. You will only be due for rain here when-the chicken's eaten all the rice, the dog's licked up all the flour and the lamp has melted the bar of the lock.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No problem,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;no problem. If you take me with you, brother, I can do a transformation, eat all the rice and flour up in one sitting and snap the bar of the lock. I can guarantee rain.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't talk nonsense, you idiot,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;This is a plan that's been made by Heaven. You'll never be able to get there.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;From what you say I don't know what to do,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's easy,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;easy. As I was leaving the four heavenly teachers said to me that this could only be solved through goodness.&#8221;</P>
<P>The marquis then prostrated himself on the ground again and said imploringly, &#8220;I will do just as you tell me, teacher.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If your heart can turn back to goodness,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;I hope that you'll at once start invoking the Buddha and reciting scriptures. Then I'll be able to help you. If you persist in refusing to reform there'll be nothing I can do to get you off. It won't be long before Heaven executes you, and your life will be beyond saving.&#8221;</P>
<P>The marquis kowtowed in worship, swearing to return to the faith. At once he summoned all the Buddhist and Taoist clergy in the city and ordered that a site be prepared for religious ceremonies. They were all to write out documents and memorials for three days. The marquis led his followers in burning incense and worshipping, thanking Heaven and Earth and repenting of his sins. Sanzang recited surras on his behalf. At the same time urgent notices were sent out ordering all the men and women, young and old, in all the households inside and outside the city to burn incense sticks and invoke the Buddha. From that moment on all ears were filled with virtuous sounds. Only then did Brother Monkey feel happy.</P>
<P>&#8220;You two look after the master,&#8221; he said to Pig and Friar Sand, &#8220;while I go off for him again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you going this time, brother?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The marquis really believed what I told him and is being reverent, good and kind,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and he's sincerely invoking the Buddha's name. So I'm going back to submit another request for rain to the Jade Emperor.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you're going, don't lose any time, brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;This is holding us up on our journey. But do get a fall of rain: it'll be another true achievement for us.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage set his cloud off once more and went straight to the gate of Heaven, where he met Heavenly King Lokapala again.</P>
<P>&#8220;What have you come for now?&#8221; Lokapala asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The marquis has mended his ways,&#8221; Monkey replied, which pleased the Heavenly King. As they were talking the Straight Spell Messenger arrived at the gate of Heaven to deliver letters and documents written by Taoist and Buddhist clergy.</P>
<P>When he saw Monkey the messenger bowed and said, &#8220;This is all the result of your successful conversion, Great Sage.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you taking those letters?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Straight to the Hall of Universal Brightness,&#8221; the messenger replied, &#8220;to give to the heavenly teachers to pass on to the Great Heavenly Honoured One, the Jade Emperor.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case you'd better go first and I'll follow,&#8221; Monkey said. The messenger then went in through the heavenly gate. &#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; said Heavenly King Lokapala, &#8220;there's no need for you to go to see the Jade Emperor. You should go to borrow some thunder gods from the Office of Response to the Primary in the Ninth Heaven, then set off thunder and lightning. After that there'll certainly be rain.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey accepted this suggestion and went in through the gate of Heaven. Instead of going to the Hall of Miraculous Mist to ask for an edict he at once turned his cloud-treading steps towards the Office of Response to the Primary in the Ninth Heaven, where the Envoy of the Thunder Gate, the Corrector of Records and the Inspector of Probity appeared to bow and say, &#8220;Why are you here, Great Sage?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's something I'd like to see the Heavenly Honoured One about,&#8221; Monkey replied, and the three envoys passed this on in a memorial to the Heavenly Honoured One, who then came down from behind his screen of red clouds and nine phoenixes in full court dress.</P>
<P>When they had exchanged greetings Monkey said, &#8220;There is something I would like to request of you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What might that be?&#8221; the Heavenly Honoured One asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;While escorting the Tang Monk I have reached the prefecture of Fengxian,&#8221; said Brother Monkey, &#8220;and as they have long been suffering from drought there I promised to make it rain for them. The reason I have come here is to ask for the loan of some of your subordinate officials and generals in order to ask for rain.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am aware that three things have been set up because the marquis there offended Heaven,&#8221; the Heavenly Honoured One replied, &#8220;but I have not yet heard that rain is due to fall there.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When I went to ask the Jade Emperor for an edict yesterday,&#8221; Monkey replied with a smile, &#8220;he told the heavenly teachers to take me to see the three things in the Hall of Fragrance: the mountain of rice, the mountain of flour and the golden lock. Rain isn't due to fall till these three things have been knocked down or broken. When I was feeling very upset because it was so difficult the heavenly teachers advised me to persuade the marquis and his people to do good deeds because Heaven is bound to help anyone who has a good thought. So there's a good chance of persuading Heaven to change its mind and delivering them from this disaster. Now good thoughts are happening everywhere, and all ears are filled with good sounds. Not long ago the Straight Spell Messenger took letters showing that they had mended their ways and turned towards goodness to the Jade Emperor, which is why I've come to your illustrious palace to ask for the help of your thunder officials and thunder generals.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; the Heavenly Honoured One replied, &#8220;I'll send Deng, Xin, Zhang and Tao to take Mother Lightning and go with you to Fengxian Prefecture to make thunder, Great Sage.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before long the four generals and the Great Sage had reached the boundaries of Fengxian and started performing their magic in mid air. A great ramble of thunder could be heard, and there were sizzling flashes of lightning. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The lightning was like snakes of purple gold;</P>
<P>The thunder was like the noise of sleeping insects awakened.</P>
<P>Flashes of light like flying fire,</P>
<P>Thunderclaps like landslides in the mountains.</P>
<P>The jagged lines lit up the whole of the sky;</P>
<P>The great noise caused the earth itself to move.</P>
<P>When the red silk flashed like sprouts of plants</P>
<P>Rivers and mountains shook for three thousand miles.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Inside and outside the city of Fengxian nobody, whether an official high or how, a soldier or a civilian had heard thunder or seen lightning for three whole years; and now that the thunder was booming and the lightning flashing they all fell to their knees, put incense burners on their heads, held sprigs of willow in their hands and said, &#8220;We submit to Amitabha Buddha. We submit to Amitabha Buddha.&#8221; These good thoughts had indeed moved Heaven, as is proved by an old-style poem:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When thoughts have been born in human minds</P>
<P>Heaven and earth will both be aware.</P>
<P>If evil and good do not get their due</P>
<P>Sides have been taken by powers up there.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We will for the moment leave the Great Sage Monkey directing the thunder generals as they unleashed thunder and lightning over Fengxian Prefecture, where everyone had turned back to goodness, and tell how the Straight Spell Messenger took the Taoist and Buddhist documents straight to the Hall of Universal Brightness, where the four heavenly teachers submitted them to the Jade Emperor in the Hall of Miraculous Mist.</P>
<P>When the Jade Emperor had seen them he said, &#8220;As that wretch has had some virtuous thoughts, see what has happened to the three things.&#8221; Just as he was speaking the official in charge of the Hall of Fragrance came in to report, &#8220;The rice and flour mountains have collapsed: the rice and flour all disappeared in an instant. The bar of the lock has also been broken.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before he could finish submitting this memorial the heavenly official in attendance led in the local deity, the city god and the gods of the altars from Fengxian, who all bowed and reported, &#8220;The lord of our prefecture and every member of every household, high and low, of the people have been converted to the true achievement and are worshipping the Buddha and Heaven. We now beg you in your compassion to send a widespread fall of timely rain to deliver the common people.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the Jade Emperor heard this he was very pleased, so he issued an edict: &#8220;Let the departments of wind, cloud and rain go to the lower world in accordance with orders. At this hour on this day the clouds are to be spread, the thunder shall roar, and three feet and forty-two drops of rain shall fall.&#8221; At once the four heavenly teachers transmitted the edict to the weather departments, who were all to go to the lower world, show their powers and act together.</P>
<P>Monkey was enjoying himself up in the sky with Deng, Xin, Zhang and Tao, who were ordering Mother Lightning about, when the arrival of all other gods filled the sky with their assembly. As the wind and the clouds met, the timely rain began to pour down.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Thick, heavy clouds,</P>
<P>Lowering black mists,</P>
<P>The rumbling of the thunder cart,</P>
<P>The searing flash of lightning,</P>
<P>A roaring gale,</P>
<P>A torrential downpour.</P>
<P>Indeed, when one thought goes up to Heaven</P>
<P>Ten thousand hopes are all fulfilled.</P>
<P>Because the Great Sage has used his powers</P>
<P>The landscape is darkened for thousands of miles.</P>
<P>The wonderful rain falls like rivers and seas,</P>
<P>Hiding the country and heavens from sight.</P>
<P>Water comes pouring down the eaves,</P>
<P>Noisily pounding outside the windows.</P>
<P>While every household invokes the Buddha</P>
<P>All of the streets and markets are flooded.</P>
<P>To East and West every channel is filled;</P>
<P>Winding streams meander to North and to South.</P>
<P>Dried-up shoots receive moisture,</P>
<P>Withered trees revive.</P>
<P>The hemp and wheat now flourish in the fields;</P>
<P>Beans and other grains grow in the countryside.</P>
<P>Traders happily travel to sell their wares;</P>
<P>Cheerful peasants get ready to work.</P>
<P>After this the millet will do well,</P>
<P>And the crops are bound to yield a bumper harvest.</P>
<P>When wind and rain are timely the people know content;</P>
<P>When rivers and seas are calm the world is at peace.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>That day three feet and forty-two drops of rain fell, after which all the gods began to tidy up and go away. &#8220;Gods of the four departments,&#8221; yelled the Great Sage at the top of his voice, &#8220;stay there for a moment with your cloud followers while I tell the marquis to bow to you all and express his thanks. You may part the clouds and appear in your true forms to let this mortal see you with his own eyes. That's the only way he'll believe and make offerings.&#8221; When the gods heard this they all stayed where they were up in the clouds.</P>
<P>Monkey then brought his cloud down to land and went straight into the prefectural palace, where Sanzang, Pig and Friar Sand all greeted him. The marquis kowtowed to him in thanks at every pace he took.</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop thanking me,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I've asked the gods of the four departments to stay. Could you tell everyone to come here to kowtow and thank them so that they'll make it rain properly in future?&#8221; The marquis issued urgent orders summoning everyone to give thanks, and they all kowtowed with incense-sticks in their hands. The gods of the four departments&#8212;rain, thunder, cloud and wind&#8212;then parted the clouds and revealed themselves in their true form.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The dragon king appeared,</P>
<P>The thunder generals were revealed,</P>
<P>The clouds boys were seen,</P>
<P>The lords of the wind came down.</P>
<P>The dragon king appeared:</P>
<P>With silver whiskers and an azure face he was really peerless.</P>
<P>The thunder generals were revealed</P>
<P>With their countenances of matchless might and crooked mouths.</P>
<P>The cloud boys were seen</P>
<P>Wearing gold crowns over faces like jade.</P>
<P>The lords of the wind came down</P>
<P>With flustered brows and bulging eyes.</P>
<P>All were displayed on the azure clouds</P>
<P>Drawn up in ranks with their holy countenances.</P>
<P>Only then were the people of Fengxian convinced</P>
<P>As they kowtowed, burned incense and rejected evil.</P>
<P>Today they gazed up at the heavenly generals,</P>
<P>Washing their hearts as they all turned to goodness.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The gods stood there for two hours as the people kowtowed to them endlessly. Monkey rose up into the clouds again to bow to all the gods and say, &#8220;I've put you to great trouble. All you gentlemen may now return. I'll make everyone in this prefecture give pure and lofty offerings to thank you at the due season. From now on you gentlemen must send wind every five days and rain every ten days to help them out.&#8221; The gods all consented as he told them and returned to their own departments.</P>
<P>Bringing his cloud down to land, Monkey said to Sanzang, &#8220;Now that the job's been done and the people given peace we can pack our things and be on our way again.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the marquis heard this he hastened to bow and say, &#8220;How can you say such a thing, Lord Sun? What has happened today has been an infinitely great act of kindness. I have sent people to prepare a humble banquet to thank you for your great kindness. Then I will buy some land from the people to build a monastery for you, my lords, with a shrine to you with inscribed tablets where offerings can be made in all four seasons. Even if I were to carve my own bones and heart it would be hard to repay a ten thousandth part of what I owe you. You can't possibly leave.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What Your Excellency says is very fine,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;but we are pilgrim monks who can only put up for the night on our journey West. We cannot stay here long. We definitely must leave in a day or two.&#8221; The marquis refused to let them go, and he ordered many people to prepare a banquet and start building a monastery that very night.</P>
<P>The next day there was a magnificent banquet at which the Tang Priest took the place of honour while the Great Sage Monkey sat beside him with Pig and Friar Sand. The marquis and his officials high and low passed them cups of wine and dishes of food while fine music was played, and so they were entertained all day. It was a most happy occasion, and there is a poem to prove it:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After long drought the fields received sweet rain;</P>
<P>Merchants were travelling along all watercourses.</P>
<P>They were deeply moved by the monks who had come to the city,</P>
<P>And by the Great Sage who had gone up to Heaven.</P>
<P>The three things had now been accomplished;</P>
<P>One thought had brought all back to the good.</P>
<P>From now on all longed for a new golden age</P>
<P>With ideal weather and good harvests for ever.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The banquets went on for days, as did the giving of thanks, until they had been kept there for almost half a month. All that remained to do was complete the monastery and the shrine. One day the marquis invited the four monks to go to inspect them.</P>
<P>&#8220;How did you complete so enormous a project so quickly?&#8221; asked the Tang Priest in astonishment.</P>
<P>&#8220;I pressed the laborers to work night and day without stopping and insisted most urgently that they finish quickly,&#8221; the marquis replied. &#8220;Now I would like you gentlemen to come and inspect it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You certainly are a most good and able marquis,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile. By now they had all reached the new monastery, where they were full of admiration for the towering halls and the majestic entrance. Monkey asked Sanzang to name the monastery.</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; Sanzang said, &#8220;I name it the Monastery of Salvation by Timely Rain.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Splendid,&#8221; said the marquis, &#8220;splendid.&#8221; He then issued a golden invitation to monks from far and wide to come to burn incense there. To the left of the Buddha hall was a shrine to the four pilgrims at which offerings were to be made in each of the four seasons every year. Temples had also been built for the thunder gods and dragon gods to thank them for their divine efforts. When the visit was over Sanzang ordered an early departure.</P>
<P>When the local people realized that the monks could be persuaded to stay no longer they all prepared parting gifts, none of which the travelers would accept. Then all the officials in the prefecture escorted them on their way for ten miles with a band playing and a great display of flags and canopies. Still loath to let the travelers go, the officials watched with tears in their eyes till they had disappeared from sight. Only then did the officials return to the city. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The virtuous and holy monk left behind the Salvation Monastery;</P>
<P>The Great Sage Equaling Heaven dispensed great kindness.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know how many more days after this departure it was that they finally saw the Tathagata Buddha, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>凤仙郡冒天止雨</p>
<p>孙大圣劝善施霖</p>
</div>
<p>大道幽深，如何消息，说破鬼神惊骇。挟藏宇宙，剖判玄光，真乐世间无赛。灵鹫峰前，宝珠拈出，明映五般光彩。照乾坤上下群生，知者寿同山海。却说三藏师徒四众，别樵子下了隐雾山，奔上大路。行经数日，忽见一座城池相近，三藏道：“悟空，你看那前面城池，可是天竺国么？”行者摇手道：“不是！不是！如来处虽称极乐，却没有城池，乃是一座大山，山中有楼台殿阁，唤做灵山大雷音寺。就到了天竺国，也不是如来住处，天竺国还不知离灵山有多少路哩。那城想是天竺之外郡，到前边方知明白。”</p>

<p>不一时至城外，三藏下马，入到三层门里，见那民事荒凉，街衢冷落。又到市口之间，见许多穿青衣者左右摆列，有几个冠带者立于房檐之下。他四众顺街行走，那些人更不逊避。猪八戒村愚，把长嘴掬一掬，叫道：“让路！让路！”那些人猛抬头，看见模样，一个个骨软筋麻，跌跌蹡蹡，都道：“妖精来了！妖精来了！”唬得那檐下冠带者战兢兢躬身问道：“那方来者？”三藏恐他们闯祸，一力当先对众道：“贫僧乃东土大唐驾下拜天竺国大雷音寺佛祖求经者。路过宝方，一则不知地名，二则未落人家，才进城，甚失回避，望列公恕罪。那官人却才施礼道：“此处乃天竺外郡，地名凤仙郡。连年干旱，郡侯差我等在此出榜，招求法师祈雨救民也。”行者闻言道：“你的榜文何在？”众官道：“榜文在此，适间才打扫廊檐，还未张挂。”行者道：“拿来我看看。”众官即将榜文展开，挂在檐下。行者四众上前同看。榜上写着：“大天竺国凤仙郡郡侯上官。为榜聘明师，招求大法事。慈因郡土宽弘，军民殷实，连年亢旱，累岁干荒，民田菑而军地薄，河道浅而沟浍空。井中无水，泉底无津。富室聊以全生，穷民难以活命。斗粟百金之价，束薪五两之资。十岁女易米三升，五岁男随人带去。城中惧法，典衣当物以存身；乡下欺公，打劫吃人而顾命。为此出给榜文，仰望十方贤哲，祷雨救民，恩当重报。愿以千金奉谢，决不虚言。须至榜者。”行者看罢，对众官道：“郡侯上官何也？”众官道：“上官乃是姓，此我郡侯之姓也。”行者笑道：“此姓却少。”八戒道：“哥哥不曾读书，百家姓后有一句上官欧阳。”三藏道：“徒弟们，且休闲讲。那个会求雨，与他求一场甘雨，以济民瘼，此乃万善之事；如不会就行，莫误了走路。”行者道：“祈雨有甚难事！我老孙翻江搅海，换斗移星，踢天弄井，吐雾喷云，担山赶月，唤雨呼风，那一件儿不是幼年耍子的勾当！何为稀罕！”</p>

<p>众官听说，着两个急去郡中报道：“老爷，万千之喜至也！”</p>

<p>那郡侯正焚香默祝，听得报声喜至，即问：“何喜？”那官道：“今日领榜，方至市口张挂，即有四个和尚，称是东土大唐差往天竺国大雷音拜佛求经者，见榜即道能祈甘雨，特来报知。”那郡侯即整衣步行，不用轿马多人，径至市口，以礼敦请。忽有人报道：“郡侯老爷来了。”众人闪过，那郡侯一见唐僧，不怕他徒弟丑恶，当街心倒身下拜道：“下官乃凤仙郡郡侯上官氏，熏沐拜请老师祈雨救民。望师大舍慈悲，运神功，拔济拔济！”三藏答礼道：“此间不是讲话处，待贫僧到那寺观，却好行事。”郡侯道：“老师同到小衙，自有洁净之处，”师徒们遂牵马挑担，径至府中，一一相见。郡侯即命看茶摆斋。少顷斋至，那八戒放量吞餐，如同饿虎，唬得那些捧盘的心惊胆战，一往一来添汤添饭，就如走马灯儿一般刚刚供上，直吃得饱满方休。斋毕，唐僧谢了斋，却问：“郡侯大人，贵处干旱几时了？”郡侯道：“敝地大邦天竺国，凤仙外郡吾司牧。一连三载遇干荒，草子不生绝五谷。大小人家买卖难，十门九户俱啼哭。三停饿死二停人，一停还似风中烛。下官出榜遍求贤，幸遇真僧来我国。若施寸雨济黎民，愿奉千金酬厚德！”行者听说，满面喜生，呵呵的笑道：</p>

<p>“莫说！莫说！若说千金为谢，半点甘雨全无。但论积功累德，老孙送你一场大雨。”那郡侯原来十分清正贤良，爱民心重，即请行者上坐，低头下拜道：“老师果舍慈悲，下官必不敢悖德。”</p>

<p>行者道：“且莫讲话，请起。但烦你好生看着我师父，等老孙行事。”沙僧道：“哥哥，怎么行事？”行者道：“你和八戒过来，就在他这堂下随着我做个羽翼，等老孙唤龙来行雨。”八戒、沙僧谨依使令，三个人都在堂下，郡侯焚香礼拜，三藏坐着念经。</p>

<p>行者念动真言，诵动咒语，即时见正东上，一朵乌云，渐渐落至堂前，乃是东海老龙王敖广。那敖广收了云脚，化作人形，走向前，对行者躬身施礼道：“大圣唤小龙来，那方使用？”行者道：“请起，累你远来，别无甚事。此间乃凤仙郡，连年干旱，问你如何不来下雨？”老龙道：“启上大圣得知，我虽能行雨，乃上天遣用之辈。上天不差，岂敢擅自来此行雨？”行者道：“我因路过此方，见久旱民苦，特着你来此施雨救济，如何推托？”龙王道：“岂敢推托？但大圣念真言呼唤，不敢不来。一则未奉上天御旨，二则未曾带得行雨神将，怎么动得雨部？大圣既有拔济之心，容小龙回海点兵，烦大圣到天宫奏准，请一道降雨的圣旨，请水官放出龙来，我却好照旨意数目下雨。”行者见他说出理来，只得发放老龙回海。他即跳出罡斗，对唐僧备言龙王之事，唐僧道：“既然如此，你去为之，切莫打诳语。”行者即吩咐八戒沙僧：“保着师父，我上天宫去也。”好大圣，说声去，寂然不见。那郡侯胆战心惊道：“孙老爷那里去了？”八戒笑道：“驾云上天去了。”郡侯十分恭敬，传出飞报，教满城大街小巷，不拘公卿士庶，军民人等，家家供养龙王牌位，门设清水缸，缸插杨柳枝，侍奉香火，拜天不题。</p>

<p>却说行者一路筋斗云，径到西天门外，早见护国天王引天丁力士上前迎接道：“大圣，取经之事完乎？”行者道：“也差不远矣。今行至天竺国界，有一外郡，名凤仙郡。彼处三年不雨，民甚艰苦，老孙欲祈雨拯救，呼得龙王到彼，他言无旨，不敢私自为之，特来朝见玉帝请旨。”天王道：“那壁厢敢是不该下雨哩。我向时闻得说，那郡侯撒泼，冒犯天地，上帝见罪，立有米山、面山、黄金大锁，直等此三事倒断，才该下雨。”行者不知此意是何，要见玉帝。天王不敢拦阻，让他进去，径至通明殿外，又见四大天师迎道：“大圣到此何干？”行者道：“因保唐僧，路至天竺国界，凤仙郡无雨，郡侯召师祈雨。老孙呼得龙王，意命降雨，他说未奉玉帝旨意，不敢擅行，特来求旨，以苏民困。”四大天师道：“那方不该下雨。”行者笑道：“该与不该，烦为引奏引奏，看老孙的人情何如。”葛仙翁道：“俗语云苍蝇包网儿，好大面皮！”许旌阳道：“不要乱谈，且只带他进去。”邱洪济、张道陵与葛、许四真人引至灵霄殿下，启奏道：“万岁，有孙悟空路至天竺国凤仙郡，欲与求雨，特来请旨。”玉帝道：“那厮三年前十二月二十五日，朕出行监观万天，浮游三界，驾至他方，见那上官正不仁，将斋天素供，推倒喂狗，口出秽言，造有冒犯之罪，朕即立以三事，在于披香殿内。汝等引孙悟空去看，若三事倒断，即降旨与他；如不倒断，且休管闲事。”四天师即引行者至披香殿里看时，见有一座米山，约有十丈高下；一座面山，约有二十丈高下。米山边有一只拳大之鸡，在那里紧一嘴，慢一嘴，嗛那米吃。面山边有一只金毛哈巴狗儿，在那里长一舌，短一舌，餂那面吃。左边悬一座铁架子，架上挂一把金锁，约有一尺三四寸长短，锁梃有指头粗细，下面有一盏明灯，灯焰儿燎着那锁梃。行者不知其意，回头问天师曰：“此何意也？”天师道：“那厮触犯了上天，玉帝立此三事，直等鸡嗛了米尽，狗餂得面尽，灯焰燎断锁梃，那方才该下雨哩。”行者闻言，大惊失色，再不敢启奏，走出殿，满面含羞。四大天师笑道：“大圣不必烦恼，这事只宜作善可解。若有一念善慈，惊动上天，那米、面山即时就倒，锁梃即时就断。你去劝他归善，福自来矣。”行者依言，不上灵霄辞玉帝，径来下界复凡夫。须臾到西天门，又见护国天王，天王道：“请旨如何？”行者将米山、面山、金锁之事说了一遍，道：“果依你言，不肯传旨。适间天师送我，教劝那厮归善，即福原也。”遂相别，降云下界。</p>

<p>那郡侯同三藏、八戒、沙僧、大小官员人等接着，都簇簇攒攒来问。行者将郡侯喝了一声道：“只因你这斯三年前十二月二十五日冒犯了天地，致令黎民有难，如今不肯降雨！”郡侯慌得跪伏在地道：“老师如何得知三年前事？”行者道：“你把那斋天的素供，怎么推倒喂狗？可实实说来！”那郡侯不敢隐瞒，道：</p>

<p>“三年前十二月二十五日，献供斋天，在于本衙之内，因妻不贤，恶言相斗，一时怒发无知，推倒供桌，泼了素馔，果是唤狗来吃了。这两年忆念在心，神思恍惚，无处可以解释，不知上天见罪，遗害黎民。今遇老师降临，万望明示，上界怎么样计较。”</p>

<p>行者道：“那一日正是玉皇下界之日，见你将斋供喂狗，又口出秽言，玉帝即立三事记汝。”八戒问道：“哥，是那三事？”行者道：“披香殿立一座米山，约有十丈高下；一座面山，约有二十丈高下。米山边有拳大的一只小鸡，在那里紧一嘴，慢一嘴的嗛那米吃；面山边有一个金毛哈巴狗儿，在那里长一舌，短一舌的餂那面吃。左边又一座铁架子，架上挂一把黄金大锁，锁梃儿有指头粗细，下面有一盏明灯，灯焰儿燎着那锁梃。直等那鸡嗛米尽，狗餂面尽，灯燎断锁梃，他这里方才该下雨哩。”</p>

<p>八戒笑道：“不打紧！不打紧！哥肯带我去，变出法身来，一顿把他的米面都吃了，锁梃弄断了，管取下雨。”行者道：“呆子莫胡说！此乃上天所设之计，你怎么得见？”三藏道：“似这等说，怎生是好？”行者道：“不难！不难！我临行时，四天师曾对我言，但只作善可解。”那郡侯拜伏在地，哀告道：“但凭老师指教，下官一一皈依也。”行者道：“你若回心向善，趁早儿念佛看经，我还替你作为；汝若仍前不改，我亦不能解释，不久天即诛之，性命不能保矣。”那郡侯磕头礼拜，誓愿皈依。当时召请本处僧道，启建道场，各各写发文书，申奏三天。郡侯领众拈香瞻拜，答天谢地，引罪自责，三藏也与他念经。一壁厢又出飞报，教城里城外大家小户，不论男女人等，都要烧香念佛。自此时，一片善声盈耳。行者却才欢喜，对八戒沙僧道：“你两个好生护持师父，等老孙再与他去去来。”八戒道：“哥哥，又往那里去？”行者道：“这郡侯听信老孙之言，果然受教，恭敬善慈，诚心念佛，我这去再奏玉帝，求些雨来。”沙僧道：“哥哥既要去，不必迟疑，且耽搁我们行路，必求雨一坛，庶成我们之正果也。”</p>

<p>好大圣，又纵云头，直至天门外，还遇着护国天王。天王道：“你今又来做甚？”行者道：“那郡侯已归善矣。”天王亦喜。</p>

<p>正说处，早见直符使者，捧定了道家文书，僧家关牒，到天门外传递。那符使见了行者，施礼道：“此意乃大圣劝善之功。”行者道：“你将此文牒送去何处？”符使道：“直送至通明殿上，与天师传递到玉皇大天尊前。”行者道：“如此，你先行，我当随后而去。”那符使入天门去了。”护国天王道：“大圣，不消见玉帝了。</p>

<p>你只往九天应元府下，借点雷神，径自声雷掣电，还他就有雨下也。”真个行者依言，入天门里，不上灵霄殿求请旨意，转云步，径往九天应元府，见那雷门使者、纠录典者、廉访典者都来迎着，施礼道：“大圣何来？”行者道：“有事要见天尊。”三使者即为传奏，天尊随下九凤丹霞之扆，整衣出迎。相见礼毕，行者道：“有一事特来奉求。”天尊道：“何事？”行者道：“我因保唐僧，至凤仙郡，见那干旱之甚，已许他求雨，特来告借贵部官将到彼声雷。”天尊道：“我知那郡侯冒犯上天，立有三事，不知可该下雨哩。”行者笑道：“我昨日已见玉帝请旨。玉帝着天师引我去披香殿看那三事，乃是米山、面山、金锁，只要三事倒断，方该下雨。我愁难得倒断，天师教我劝化郡侯等众作善，以为人有善念，天必从之，庶几可以回天心，解灾难也。今已善念顿生，善声盈耳。适间直符使者已将改行从善的文牒奏上玉帝去了，老孙因特造尊府，告借雷部官将相助相助。”天尊道：“既如此，差邓辛张陶帅领闪电娘子，即随大圣下降凤仙郡声雷。”</p>

<p>那四将同大圣，不多时至于凤仙境界，即于半空中作起法来。只听得唿鲁鲁的雷声，又见那淅沥沥的闪电，真个是：电掣紫金蛇，雷轰群蛰哄。荧煌飞火光，霹雳崩山洞。列缺满天明，震惊连地纵。红销一闪发萌芽，万里江山都撼动。那凤仙郡，城里城外，大小官员，军民人等，整三年不曾听见雷电，今日见有雷声霍闪，一齐跪下，头顶着香炉，有的手拈着柳枝，都念：</p>

<p>“南无阿弥陀佛！南无阿弥陀佛！”这一声善念，果然惊动上天，正是那古诗云：“人心生一念，天地悉皆知，善恶若无报，乾坤必有私。”</p>

<p>且不说孙大圣指挥雷将，掣电轰雷于凤仙郡，人人归善。</p>

<p>却说那上界直符使者，将僧道两家的文牒，送至通明殿，四天师传奏灵霄殿。玉帝见了道：“那厮们既有善念，看三事如何。”</p>

<p>正说处，忽有披香殿看管的将官报道：“所立米、面山俱倒了，霎时间米面皆无，锁梃亦断。”奏未毕，又有当驾天官引凤仙郡土地、城隍、社令等神齐来拜奏道：“本郡郡主并满城大小黎庶之家，无一家一人不皈依善果，礼佛敬天。今启垂慈，普降甘雨，救济黎民。”玉帝闻言大喜，即传旨：“着风部、云部、雨部，各遵号令，去下方，按凤仙郡界，即于今日今时，声雷布云，降雨三尺零四十二点。”时有四大天师奉旨，传与各部随时下界，各逞神威，一齐振作。</p>

<p>行者正与邓辛张陶令闪电娘子在空中调弄，只见众神都到，合会一天。那其间风云际会，甘雨滂沱，好雨：漠漠浓云，蒙蒙黑雾。雷车轰轰，闪电灼灼。滚滚狂风，淙淙骤雨。所谓一念回天，万民满望。全亏大圣施元运，万里江山处处阴。好雨倾河倒海，蔽野迷空。檐前垂瀑布，窗外响玲珑。万户千门人念佛，六街三市水流洪。东西河道条条满，南北溪湾处处通。槁苗得润，枯木回生。田畴麻麦盛，村堡豆粮升。客旅喜通贩卖，农夫爱尔耘耕。从今黍稷多条畅，自然稼穑得丰登。风调雨顺民安乐，海晏河清享太平。一日雨下足了三尺零四十二点，众神祇渐渐收回。孙大圣厉声高叫道：“那四部众神，且暂停云从，待老孙去叫郡侯拜谢列位。列位可拨开云雾，各现真身，与这凡夫亲眼看看，他才信心供奉也。”众神听说，只得都停在空中。这行者按落云头，径至郡里，早见三藏、八戒、沙僧，都来迎接，那郡侯一步一拜来谢。行者道：“且慢谢我，我已留住四部神祇，你可传召多人同此拜谢。教他向后好来降雨。”郡侯随传飞报，召众同酬，都一个个拈香朝拜，只见那四部神祇，开明云雾，各现真身。四部者，乃雨部、雷部、云部、风部，只见那龙王显象，雷将舒身。云童出现，风伯垂真。龙王显象，银须苍貌世无双。雷将舒身，钩嘴威颜诚莫比。云童出现，谁如玉面金冠；</p>

<p>风伯垂真，曾似燥眉环眼。齐齐显露青霄上，各各挨排观圣仪。</p>

<p>凤仙郡界人才信，顶礼拈香恶性回。今日仰朝天上将，洗心向善尽皈依。众神祇宁待了一个时辰，人民拜之不已。孙行者又起在云端，对众作礼道：“有劳！有劳！请列位各归本部。老孙还教郡界中人家，供养高真，遇时节醮谢。列位从此后，五日一风，十日一雨，还来拯救拯救。”众神依言，各各转部不题。</p>

<p>却说大圣坠落云头与三藏道：“事毕民安，可收拾走路矣。”那郡侯闻言，急忙行礼道：“孙老爷说那里话！今此一场，乃无量无边之恩德。下官这里差人办备小宴，奉答厚恩。仍买治民间田地，与老爷起建寺院，立老爷生祠，勒碑刻名，四时享祀。虽刻骨镂心，难报万一，怎么就说走路的话！”三藏道：“大人之言虽当，但我等乃西方挂搭行脚之僧，不敢久住。一二日间，定走无疑。”那郡侯那里肯放，连夜差多人治办酒席，起盖祠宇。</p>

<p>次日，大开佳宴，请唐僧高坐，孙大圣与八戒沙僧列坐，郡侯同本郡大小官员部臣把杯献馔，细吹细打，款待了一日。这场果是欣然，有诗为证：田畴久旱逢甘雨，河道经商处处通。深感神僧来郡界，多蒙大圣上天宫。解除三事从前恶，一念皈依善果弘。此后愿如尧舜世，五风十雨万年丰。</p>

<p>一日筵，二日宴，今日酬，明日谢，扳留将有半月，只等寺院生祠完备。一日，郡侯请四众往观，唐僧惊讶道：“工程浩大，何成之如此速耶？”郡侯道：“下官催趱人工，昼夜不息，急急命完，特请列位老爷看看。”行者笑道：“果是贤才能干的好贤侯也！”即时都到新寺，见那殿阁巍峨，山门壮丽，俱称赞不已。行者请师父留一寺名，三藏道：“有，留名当唤做甘霖普济寺。”郡侯称道：“甚好！甚好！”用金贴广招僧众，侍奉香火。殿左边立起四众生祠，每年四时祭祀；又起盖雷神、龙神等庙，以答神功。看毕，即命趱行。那一郡人民，知久留不住，各备赆仪，分文不受。因此，合郡官员人等，盛张鼓乐，大展旌幢，送有三十里远近，犹不忍别，遂掩泪目送，直至望不见方回。这正是：硕德神僧留普济，齐天大圣广施恩。毕竟不知此去还有几日方见如来，且听下回分解。</p>
