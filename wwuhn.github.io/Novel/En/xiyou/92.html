<P>Admiring the Moon Festival Lanterns in Jinping</P>
<P>The Tang Priest Confesses in Dark Essence Cave</P>
</div>
<P>Where should one strive to practice dhyana?</P>
<P>Swiftly to extirpate the misdeeds of the thought-horse and the mind-ape.</P>
<P>When they are firmly tethered they give off radiance,</P>
<P>But whoever halts falls to the three paths of suffering.</P>
<P>If one allows the divine elixir to leak away,</P>
<P>The jade-pure nature will wither as one slackens.</P>
<P>Anger, joy and worry must all be swept away:</P>
<P>When the wonderful mystery is gained it seems like nothing.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story tells how the Tang Priest and his three disciples left the city of Yuhua and had a very easy journey in what really was a land of paradise. When they had been travelling for five or six days another city appeared.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where is this?&#8221; the Tang Priest asked Brother Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's a city,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;but there are no flags on the poles above the city wall and I don't know this area, so I'll ask when we get closer.&#8221; When they reached the Eastern suburb they found it noisy with bars and tea-houses and bustling with a rice market and oil shops. Some idlers who were wandering in the streets with nothing better to do crowded round for a better look when they saw Pig's long snout, Friar Sand's black face and Monkey's red eyes, but they dared not come any closer to question the travelers. The Tang Priest was sweating with the worry that they would provoke trouble as they crossed several more streets and had still not yet reached the city wall. Then they saw a monastery gate over which were the words CLOUDS OF COMPASSION MONASTERY.</P>
<P>&#8220;What about going in here to give the horse a rest and take a meal?&#8221; the Tang Priest suggested, to which Monkey replied, &#8220;Splendid, splendid.&#8221; The four of them then went inside, and this is what they saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Splendid, towering buildings,</P>
<P>Gleaming bases for statues..</P>
<P>The Buddha hall rise above the clouds;</P>
<P>The monks' cells lie in the moonlit silence.</P>
<P>Red mists circle the stupas;</P>
<P>In the shade of jade-green trees the scripture-wheel is cool.</P>
<P>This is a true Pure Land,</P>
<P>Another Naga Palace,</P>
<P>Where purple mists surround the Mahavira Hall.</P>
<P>The cloisters are never empty of people enjoying the sights,</P>
<P>And visitors climb the pagoda that is always open.</P>
<P>Incense burns in the stand at every moment,</P>
<P>And lamps shine on the altar through the night.</P>
<P>A golden bell rings rhythmically in the abbot's lodgings</P>
<P>As monks worship the Buddha by reciting sutras.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As the four of them looked around a monk came along the cloister and said to the Tang Priest with polite gestures of greeting, &#8220;Where have you come from, Teacher?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;From the Tang Court in China,&#8221; the Tang Priest replied, at which the monk went down on his knees to kowtow, only to be quickly helped up by the Tang Priest, who asked, &#8220;Why do you perform this great courtesy, reverend abbot?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;All the lovers of goodness here who read the sutras and recite the name of the Buddha hope to achieve rebirth in your land of China, so that when I saw you coming in your magnificent mitre and robes I was certain that your present splendor must be the result of your successful cultivation in earlier lives. That's why it is right to kowtow to you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It alarmed me,&#8221; said the Tang Priest with a smile, &#8220;it alarmed me. I am only an itinerant monk, and know no splendor at all. To be able to live at your leisure and ease as you do, abbot, is real bliss.&#8221; The monk then led the Tang Priest to worship the Buddha statues in the main hall. It was only now that Sanzang called for his disciples. After seeing their master start talking to the monk, Monkey and the other two had been standing in a group with their faces averted, holding the horse's bridle and looking after the luggage, so that the monk had not noticed them.</P>
<P>But when they turned round on hearing the Tang Priest's call the sight of them so frightened the monk that he called out, &#8220;My lord, why are your distinguished disciples so hideously ugly?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Ugly they may be,&#8221; the Tang Priest replied, &#8220;but they do have some magical powers. I have been very grateful for their protection all the way along the journey.&#8221;</P>
<P>As they were speaking more monks came out to greet them. The monk who had been the first to welcome the visitors explained to the others, &#8220;This teacher has come from Great Tang in China, and these three gentlemen are his distinguished disciples.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Teacher,&#8221; said the others with mixed pleasure and apprehension, &#8220;why have you come here from Great China?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have been commanded by the Tang emperor to worship the Buddha and seek the scriptures in the Western Heaven,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;As I was passing this way I have come to your monastery to ask where we are and take a vegetarian meal before setting out again.&#8221; The monks were all delighted, and they invited the visitors into the abbot's lodgings, where there were some more monks who were performing ceremonies on behalf of benefactors.</P>
<P>The monk who had met them first went on to explain to the others, &#8220;Come and have a look at what people from China are like: some are handsome and some are ugly. The beauty of the handsome ones could never be caught in a painting or drawing, and the ugly ones look really weird.&#8221; Both the monks and the benefactors all came to greet them, after which everyone sat down.</P>
<P>When tea had been drunk the Tang Priest inquired, &#8220;What is this fine country called?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is Jinping, one of the outer prefectures of India,&#8221; the monks replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;How far is it from this prefecture to Vulture Peak?&#8221; the Tang Priest asked. &#8220;It is about seven hundred miles from here to the capital,&#8221; the monks replied, &#8220;and we have walked that distance. As we haven't gone further West to Vulture Peak we don't know how far that is and would not like to make a wild guess.&#8221; The Tang Priest thanked them.</P>
<P>A little later a vegetarian meal was provided, after which the Tang Priest wanted to be on his way, only to be pressed to stay by the monks and the benefactors who said, &#8220;Teacher, you must stay for a couple of days or so. Enjoy the Full Moon Festival before you go on your way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;On my journey I have only been aware of mountains and rivers and the danger of running into ogres or monsters,&#8221; the Tang Priest replied, &#8220;and I have lost my sense of time. I don't know when Full Moon is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's because your heart is so set on worshipping the Buddha and on enlightenment that you have not thought about it, Teacher,&#8221; the monks replied. &#8220;Today is the thirteenth of the first month and the lanterns will be tried out tonight. The day after tomorrow is the fifteenth, when the festival begins, and it goes on till the lanterns are put away on the eighteenth or nineteenth. We enjoy celebrations here and our prefect, who cares for the people, has lanterns set out everywhere and music played all night. We also have a Bridge of Golden Lamps&#8212;it's an ancient tradition that still flourishes. If you will stay for a few days, my lords, our monastery can certainly afford to entertain you.&#8221; The Tang Priest had no choice but to stay. As the bell and drum in the Buddha hall resounded to the skies the faithful came in from the streets bringing lanterns to present to the Buddha. The Tang Priest and the rest of them came out of the abbot's lodgings to look at the lanterns, after which everyone turned in.</P>
<P>The next day, when they had eaten the vegetarian breakfast the monks of the monastery brought them, they strolled in the garden at the back. It really was a lovely place:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>It is the first month of the year,</P>
<P>The beginning of the spring.</P>
<P>The wooded garden is quiet and elegant;</P>
<P>The beauty of the scene subdued.</P>
<P>Throughout the four seasons flowers and trees contend;</P>
<P>Turquoise peaks rise behind each other.</P>
<P>Fragrant flowers are growing before the steps,</P>
<P>And scent comes from the plum-tree's branches.</P>
<P>Where there is red it joins the tender peach blossom;</P>
<P>Where there is green it mingles with the willows' fresh green.</P>
<P>Forget about the splendor of the Gold Valley Garden;</P>
<P>Say nothing of the Wang River landscapes painted by Wang Wei.</P>
<P>In the flowing stream</P>
<P>The wild ducks bob and rise;</P>
<P>Among bamboos by the thousand</P>
<P>Poets ponder their choice of words.</P>
<P>Tree and herbaceous peonies, myrtle, fleeting-smile flowers,</P>
<P>That waken when their time is due;</P>
<P>Camellias, red plum blossom, winter jasmine and daphne,</P>
<P>All early to open out their beauty.</P>
<P>The snow piled by the hidden cliff seems frozen solid still;</P>
<P>The clouds that drift by the distant trees already bring early traces of spring.</P>
<P>The deer sees its reflection beside the pool;</P>
<P>Cranes come to hear the lute beneath the pines.</P>
<P>A few halls and pavilions to East and West,</P>
<P>Where travelers may stay;</P>
<P>Buildings and pagodas to North and South</P>
<P>Where monks may meditate in peace.</P>
<P>Among the flowers</P>
<P>Are one or two houses to nourish one's nature,</P>
<P>Where double eaves rise above each other.</P>
<P>Amid the hills and streams</P>
<P>Are three or four cells in which to reline magic, Peaceful and light.</P>
<P>This is indeed a natural spot for a recluse:</P>
<P>Why look elsewhere for the earthly paradise?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After a day enjoying the garden they inspected the lanterns in the Buddha hall before going to look at the lantern festival. This is what they saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A splendid city of agate,</P>
<P>A fairyland of glass;</P>
<P>Palaces of crystal and mica,</P>
<P>Like layer upon layer of brocade,</P>
<P>Openwork carving behind openwork carving.</P>
<P>The dazzling bridge of stars moved heaven and earth</P>
<P>While trees of fire made waves of red</P>
<P>Flutes and drums played in the streets.</P>
<P>A moon like a ring of jade hung over a thousand gates;</P>
<P>Fragrant breezes blew through ten thousand homes.</P>
<P>There were giant turtle peaks soaring on high,</P>
<P>Fishes and dragons emerging from the sea,</P>
<P>Phoenixes sporting in the sky.</P>
<P>As all admired the moon and the lanterns</P>
<P>The atmosphere was full of harmony.</P>
<P>Among the crowds dressed in fine silks</P>
<P>All enjoyed the songs and panpipes.</P>
<P>Carriages rumbled along.</P>
<P>There was no end of beautiful faces,</P>
<P>Dashing gallants, And marvellous sights.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Sanzang and the others had looked at the lanterns in the monastery they wandered around the streets of the Eastern suburb, not going back to bed till the second watch in the middle of the night.</P>
<P>The next day Sanzang said to the monks, &#8220;I made a vow to sweep pagodas, and on the occasion of tonight's Moon Festival I would like to ask the reverend abbot to open the doors of the pagoda to allow me to fulfil this vow.&#8221; The monks opened the doors, and when Friar Sand fetched his cassock and brought it to him on the ground floor he put it over his shoulders and prayed to the Buddha. Then he swept the ground floor with a broom, took the cassock off and gave it back to Friar Sand. He swept the second story next, and so on story by story till he reached the top. In every story there was a Buddha, and in each one he opened all the windows, swept the floor, and enjoyed the splendid views. By the time he had finished sweeping and come down again it was late and all the lamps had been lit.</P>
<P>It was now the night of the full moon. &#8220;Venerable teacher,&#8221; the monks said, &#8220;last night you only saw the lamps in our humble monastery and the outskirts of the city. As tonight is the main festival why don't we go into the city to see the golden lamps there?&#8221; The Tang Priest was glad to follow this suggestion, and he went with his three disciples and the monks of the monastery into the city to see the lanterns. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On the festive fifteenth night</P>
<P>The harmony of spring begins with the first full moon.</P>
<P>Decorated lanterns hang in the busy markets</P>
<P>As all sing the songs of a world at peace.</P>
<P>Over the lantern light in streets and markets</P>
<P>The moon's round mirror rises in the sky</P>
<P>Like a silver dish, driven by the charioteer Ping Yi.</P>
<P>The lanterns were like a brocade carpet woven by fairies;</P>
<P>The lanterns were reflected by the moon,</P>
<P>Doubling its brilliance;</P>
<P>The moon shone on the lanterns,</P>
<P>Making them resplendent.</P>
<P>There was no end of iron-chain star bridges,</P>
<P>Lantern flowers and trees of fire.</P>
<P>Snowflake lanterns,</P>
<P>Plum-blossom lanterns,</P>
<P>Like fragments of ice in spring;</P>
<P>Embroidered screen lanterns,</P>
<P>Painted screen lanterns,</P>
<P>Made up from every color.</P>
<P>Walnut lanterns,</P>
<P>Lotus lanterns,</P>
<P>Hung high on lantern towers;</P>
<P>Blue lion lanterns,</P>
<P>White elephant lanterns,</P>
<P>Fixed on lofty frames.</P>
<P>Shrimp lanterns,</P>
<P>Terrapin lanterns,</P>
<P>Placed in front of awnings;</P>
<P>Goat lanterns,</P>
<P>Hare lanterns,</P>
<P>Bringing the eaves to life.</P>
<P>Eagle lanterns,</P>
<P>Phoenix lanterns,</P>
<P>Lined up next to each other;</P>
<P>Tiger lanterns,</P>
<P>Horse lanterns,</P>
<P>Being carried along together.</P>
<P>Red-crowned crane lanterns,</P>
<P>White deer lanterns,</P>
<P>Carrying the Star of Longevity;</P>
<P>Goldfish lanterns,</P>
<P>Whale lanterns,</P>
<P>On which rode the poet Li Bai.</P>
<P>Giant turtle mountain lanterns,</P>
<P>Where gods and immortals gathered;</P>
<P>Revolving horse lanterns</P>
<P>On which warriors joined combat.</P>
<P>The towers of lanterns on thousands of houses</P>
<P>Made a world of clouds and smoke for several miles.</P>
<P>On one side, shining reins and flying jade saddles;</P>
<P>On the other, rumbling carriages leave fragrance behind.</P>
<P>On the red balcony,</P>
<P>Leaning against the railings,</P>
<P>Behind the curtains,</P>
<P>Shoulder to shoulder,</P>
<P>Hand in hand,</P>
<P>Pairs of beauties were eager for the fun.</P>
<P>By the bridge over green waters,</P>
<P>Noisy,</P>
<P>Many-coloured,</P>
<P>Drunken,</P>
<P>Laughing</P>
<P>Couples enjoyed the brilliant sights.</P>
<P>All of the city's flutes and drums were playing;</P>
<P>Panpipes and songs went on all night.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>There is also this poem as evidence:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Amid the fine brocades, of lotus were the songs;</P>
<P>This blessed land at peace was full of many throngs.</P>
<P>The lanterns and the moon upon this festive night</P>
<P>Foretold rich harvests after rain and wind just right.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This was a night when the curfew was relaxed, so that there were huge crowds and a great commotion. People were dancing, walking on stilts, wearing masks and riding elephants, pushing and crowding to East and to West as they looked all around. When they reached the bridge of golden lamps the Tang Priest and the monks pushed forward for a look and saw that it consisted of three golden lamps each the size of a water vat and shaped like a two-storied pavilion with a light shining out through intricate gold and silver filigree openwork. Glazed ceramic tiles inside the lamps reflected their light. They were so bright they outshone the moon, and their oil was very fragrant.</P>
<P>&#8220;What sort of oil do those lamps burn?&#8221; the Tang Priest asked the monks, &#8220;and why does it smell so remarkably good?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You wouldn't know that, Teacher,&#8221; the monks replied. &#8220;There is a county near this prefecture called Mintian. In the whole county there are 240 wards, and when we have our annual assignment of jobs to be done for the state, 240 households have to provide oil. All the other jobs assigned by the prefecture or county are reasonable enough, but these oil households have a very hard time. Every household has to take it on for a year, and it costs them over two hundred ounces of silver. The oil isn't ordinary oil but perfumed refined butter oil. One ounce costs two ounces of silver and a pound costs thirty-two ounces. Each of the lamps holds five hundred pounds of oil, making 1,500 pounds for the three of them, costing 48,000 ounces of silver. With other miscellaneous expenses it comes to over 50,000 ounces. And that only lasts three nights.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How can so much oil be used up in only three nights?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;In each lamp there are forty-nine big wicks about the size of an egg made of rushes wrapped in silk floss,&#8221; the monks explained. &#8220;When they have burned for one night the Lord Buddhas appear, the oil all vanishes and the lamp goes out.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I suppose the Lord Buddhas take all the oil,&#8221; said Pig with a grin as he stood at one side.</P>
<P>&#8220;That's right,&#8221; the monks replied, &#8220;that's what everyone in the city has always said ever since ancient times. If the oil runs dry they say that the Buddhas have taken the oil and the crops will certainly be bountiful; but if it doesn't dry up on one occasion there will be famine, drought and the wrong weather at the wrong time in that year. That's why everyone makes this offering.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As they were talking there was the howling of a wind up in the air, sending everyone who was admiring the lanterns fleeing in terror. The monks could not hold their ground either. &#8220;Let's go back, venerable teacher,&#8221; they said, &#8220;the wind's here. It's the Lord Buddhas bringing blessings. They're here to see the lanterns.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you tell that?&#8221; the Tang Priest asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's the same every year,&#8221; the monks replied. &#8220;The wind blows up before the third watch. Everybody gets out of the way as they know that it is the Lord Buddhas bringing down blessings.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am one who thinks of, invokes and worships Buddhas,&#8221; the Tang Priest said. &#8220;If the Buddhas are honoring us with their presence on this festive occasion it would be wonderful to be able to worship them.&#8221; He rejected the monks' repeated urgings to go back, and a little later the forms of three Buddhas appeared in the wind and approached the lamps. The Tang Priest was so excited that he ran to the top of the lamp bridge and threw himself down worship.</P>
<P>Brother Monkey rushed forward in alarm to drag him to his feet and say, &#8220;They're no good, Master. I'm sure they're evil.&#8221; Before the words were even out of his mouth the lamps all went out as with a great whoosh the Tang Priest was swept up by the wind. It was terrible! Who knew what evil monsters from what cave in what mountain had been posing as Buddhas to watch the golden lamps?</P>
<P>Pig and Friar Sand were thrown into such panic that they rushed all about, searching and calling for their master. &#8220;Brothers,&#8221; called Monkey, &#8220;no use shouting here. The master's bliss has turned to disaster. He's been carried off by evil spirits.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you tell that, my lord,&#8221; the appalled monks asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;You're just a bunch of mortals,&#8221; Monkey replied with a grin, &#8220;so you haven't realized what's been happening all these years. The evil spirits have fooled you into thinking they're true Buddhas coming down to accept the offerings of lamps. The Buddhas that appeared when the wind blew just now were three evil spirits. My master didn't realize who they were, so he went up on the top of the bridge to worship them. They covered up all the lights and carried him off together with the oil in the lamps. As I was a bit too late the three of them got away by wind.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;Whatever are we to do?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Not a moment to lose,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;You two go back the monastery with the monks and look after the horse and the luggage. I'm going after them while this wind's still blowing.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage then shot up by his somersault cloud into mid air, picked up the stench of the wind and headed Northeast in pursuit, carrying on till all of a sudden the wind dropped at dawn. A great mountain could be seen, a most steep, towering and splendid mountain:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Many a foothill and ravine,</P>
<P>Twisting and bending streams.</P>
<P>Creepers hang from the beetling precipice,</P>
<P>Pine and cypress rise from the lonely rock.</P>
<P>Cranes cry in the morning mists,</P>
<P>Wild geese call among the clouds at dawn.</P>
<P>Jutting peaks like a row of halberds,</P>
<P>Jagged crags of interlocking rocks.</P>
<P>The summits rise to eighty thousand feet,</P>
<P>And sheer-walled ridges make a thousand angles.</P>
<P>Wild flowers and noble trees all flourish with the spring;</P>
<P>Cuckoo and oriole respond to the scenery with song.</P>
<P>Majestic beauty,</P>
<P>Towering grandeur,</P>
<P>Steep, grotesque crags hard to climb.</P>
<P>One will stay there long in silence:</P>
<P>All that can be heard are tigers and leopards breathing.</P>
<P>River deer and white deer wander around;</P>
<P>Jade-coloured hares and gray wolves come and go.</P>
<P>The stream in the deep ravine will flow for a million miles;</P>
<P>Twisting torrents splash loud against the rocks.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>While the Great Sage was on the top of a scar looking for his way he saw four people coming from the Western slopes driving three goats and all shouting, &#8220;New Year.&#8221; Monkey's fiery eyes with their golden pupils flashed as he took a closer look to see that they were the four Duty Gods of the year, the month, the day and the hour in disguise.</P>
<P>The Great Sage then pulled out his iron cudgel, shook it till it was as thick as a ricebowl and about twelve feet long and sprang down from the cliff with a shout of, &#8220;Where are you skulking off to like that, trying to hide your faces?&#8221;</P>
<P>When the four Duty Gods realized that he had rumbled them they at once turned back into their normal selves, kowtowed beside the path and said, &#8220;Forgive us, Great Sage, forgive us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Just because I haven't had any jobs for you recently you thought I was getting lax and so you've all become very casual,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;You didn't even greet me. It's outrageous! Why aren't you giving my master your secret protection? Where are you going?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Because your master somewhat forgot his dhyana nature and was so eager to enjoy himself in the Clouds of Compassion Monastery in Jinping Prefecture,&#8221; the Duty Gods said, &#8220;he met with evil at the height of splendor, his joy turned to disaster, and he was captured by the evil spirits. The Defenders of the Faith are looking after him at the moment. We realized that you would be coming after him this very night, Great Sage, and we came here to report to you in case you did not know the mountains and forests here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you were here to report,&#8221; said Brother Monkey, &#8220;why did you disguise your identities, why were you driving three goats, and what were you shouting and yelling for?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The three goats were for luck at the beginning of the year.</P>
<P>They are to drive away the evil that's obstructing your master.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey had been absolutely determined to beat them, but on hearing this explanation he let them off and put his cudgel away as his fury turned to delight. &#8220;Are there evil spirits on this mountain?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; they replied, &#8220;yes. This mountain is called Green Dragon Mountain and there's a cave in it called the Dark Essence Cave where three evil spirits live. The oldest is called King Cold-avoider, the second is called King Heat-avoider and the third is called King Dust-avoider. They've lived here for a thousand years and have been fond of refined butter oil since they were children. Ever since they became spirits some years ago they've been pretending to be Buddhas to trick the officials and people of Jinping into setting out those golden lamps full of the refined butter oil that they take in their Buddha guises in the middle of every first month. When they saw your master this time they realized that he was a holy monk and carried him off to the cave too. Any day now they'll slice off his flesh to fry in the refined butter. You must use your skills to save him as soon as possible.&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing this Monkey dismissed the four Duty Gods with a shout and went round the mountain looking for the cave. Within a mile or two he saw a rock face by a gill, at the foot of which was a stone building with a pair of stone doors that stood ajar. Beside the doors was a stone tablet on which was inscribed</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>GREEN DRAGON MOUNTAIN</P>
<P>DARK ESSENCE CAVE</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Not daring to go in uninvited, Monkey stopped and called, &#8220;Give me my master back at once, monster.&#8221; With a great noise the doors burst wide open, and out rushed a crowd of bull-headed demons who glared as they asked, &#8220;Who are you, yelling here like that?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm the senior disciple of the holy monk Tang Sanzang who's come from Great Tang in the East to fetch scriptures,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;He was looking at the lanterns in Jinping along our way when your chief demons carried him off here. Give him back at once if you want me to spare your lives. If you don't I'll turn our den upside-down and turn all you demons into just pus and blood.&#8221;</P>
<P>As soon as the junior demons heard this they rushed inside to report, &#8220;Disaster, Your Majesties, disaster!&#8221; The three old evil spirits had taken Sanzang into the depths of the cave and with no further ado were telling their underlings to strip him and wash him with water from the torrent. They were just about to have him sliced and diced into tiny pieces to fry in the refined butter when they heard the report of disaster from outside. The oldest demon king asked with some alarm what had happened.</P>
<P>&#8220;There's a hairy-faced monk who looks like a thunder god outside,&#8221; the junior devils replied. &#8220;He's shouting that Your Majesties carried his master here and wants him given back straight away if our lives are to be spared. Otherwise he'll turn our den upside-down and turn us all into pus and blood.&#8221;</P>
<P>This news shocked the demon kings, who all said, &#8220;We've only just caught the wretch, and haven't even asked him his name and his background. Little ones, dress him again and bring him here to be questioned. We must find out who he is and where he's from.&#8221;</P>
<P>A crowd of devils untied the Tang Priest, put his clothes back on and pushed him to before the thrones, where he fell to his knees, trembling with fear, and pleaded, &#8220;Spare my life, Your Majesties, spare my life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you from, monk?&#8221; the three evil spirits said, all talking at once, &#8220;and why did you rush into the way of our clouds instead of avoiding the Buddha images?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have been sent by the Great Tang Emperor in the East to worship the Lord Buddha and fetch the scriptures from the Great Thunder Monastery in India,&#8221; Sanzang replied with kowtows. &#8220;When I went into the Clouds of Compassion Monastery for a vegetarian meal the monks there pressed me to stay to see the lanterns at the Moon Festival. Seeing Your Majesties appearing as Buddhas from the bridge of golden lamps I kowtowed to you because my mortal eyes took you for real Buddhas. That's why I got in the way of your clouds, Your Majesties.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How long was the journey from your country in the East to here?&#8221; the evil spirits asked. &#8220;How many people have you got with you? What are they called? Tell us the truth straight away and we'll spare your life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My secular name was Chen Xuanzang,&#8221; the Tang Priest replied, &#8220;and I was a monk in the Jinshan Monastery from boyhood. Later I was given official rank as a monk in the Hongfu Monastery in Chang'an. When the minister Wei Zheng beheaded the Dragon King of the River Jing in his dream and the Tang emperor came back to life after his travels in the underworld, a Great Land and Water Mass was held for the rebirth of souls. The Tang emperor chose me to officiate at this ceremony and expound the great principles. The Bodhisattva Guanyin appeared during the mass and informed me that in the Thunder Monastery in the Western Heaven there are three stores of true scriptures that can carry the dead up to Heaven. I was sent to fetch them and given the title Sanzang, or &#8220;Three Stores.&#8221; As I use Tang as my surname people call me Tang Sanzang. I have three disciples. The first one is called Sun Wukong the Novice, and he is the Great Sage Equaling Heaven who has been converted to the truth.&#8221;</P>
<P>This news came as a shock to the evil spirits, who asked, &#8220;Did this Great Sage Equaling Heaven make great havoc in Heaven five hundred years ago?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; the Tang Priest said. &#8220;The second one is called Zhu Wuneng or Zhu Bajie. He is Marshal Tian Peng come down to earth. The third is Sha Wujing, or Friar Sand, the Curtain-lifting General in mortal reincarnation.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's as well we haven't eaten him yet,&#8221; the evil spirits all exclaimed in horror. &#8220;Little ones, lock the Tang Priest in iron chains at the back. When we've caught his three disciples we'll eat them together.&#8221; They then mustered a force of armed yak, water-buffalo and ox spirits to go outside carrying bugles, waving banners and beating drums.</P>
<P>Once the three evil spirits were fully clad in their armor they went out and shouted, &#8220;Who's that who dares come here shouting like that?&#8221; Monkey slipped round behind the scar to have a good look, and this is what the evil spirits were like:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Multi-coloured faces, round eyes,</P>
<P>Towering horns.</P>
<P>Four sharp-pointed ears,</P>
<P>Neat and shining bright.</P>
<P>Bodies patterned like a painting,</P>
<P>Covered with brocades that shine like fireflies.</P>
<P>The first one wore a hat of foxes' fur</P>
<P>And hot steam rose from the long hairs of his face.</P>
<P>The second wore a flaming cloak of lightest gauze</P>
<P>And had four gleaming, jade-like hooves.</P>
<P>The third had a mighty roar like thunder;</P>
<P>His sharp and pointed fangs were just like silver needles.</P>
<P>Each was brave and fierce</P>
<P>As they carried their three weapons;</P>
<P>One used a battle-axe,</P>
<P>One was an expert in the cutlass,</P>
<P>And the third had a knotted flail resting on his shoulders.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The other evil spirits, tall and short, fat and thin, senior and junior, were all cattle-headed monsters carrying spears or clubs. There were three big banners clearly inscribed with the words &#8220;King Cold-avoider,&#8221; &#8220;King Heat-avoider&#8221; and &#8220;King Dust-avoider.&#8221; After looking at all this for a while Monkey lost his patience and went up to them with a shout of, &#8220;Can you recognize Monkey, thieving damned ogres?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Are you the Sun Wukong who made havoc in Heaven?&#8221; the evil spirits shouted back. &#8220;It really is a case of</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I heard your name before I saw your face:</P>
<P>The sight of that would bring the gods disgrace.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>So all you are is a macaque.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll get you, you lamp-oil thieves,&#8221; Monkey retorted in high dudgeon. &#8220;Don't talk such rubbish, you smooth-tongued monsters. Give my master back at once.&#8221; With that he advanced and swung his iron cudgel, to be parried by the old demons who raised their weapons to meet the blow. A splendid fight ensued in the mountain hollow:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Battle-axe, cutlass and flail</P>
<P>Met by the Monkey King's lone cudgel.</P>
<P>Cold-avoider, Heat-avoider and Dust-avoider</P>
<P>Had heard of the Great Sage Equaling Heaven.</P>
<P>When the cudgel rose it scared demons and gods;</P>
<P>Axe and cutlass hacked and flew.</P>
<P>A primal dharma image of true emptiness</P>
<P>Holding off three demons masquerading as Buddhas.</P>
<P>Their noses all greasy with this year's stolen oil,</P>
<P>They tried to snatch the monk sent by the emperor.</P>
<P>One for his master's sake feared not the lengthy road;</P>
<P>The others in their greed had lamps offered every year.</P>
<P>All that could be beard was clash of axe and cutlass</P>
<P>And the noisy clatter of the cudgel.</P>
<P>With clashes and lunges three fought against one</P>
<P>As each showed his skill with blocks and parries.</P>
<P>They fought from dawn till almost nightfall</P>
<P>And a victor had yet to emerge in the struggle.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>By the time Monkey's cudgel had gone 150 rounds with the three demons it was nearly evening and the outcome was still in doubt. Then Dust-avoider sprang forward from the ranks with a swing of his flail and waved a flag, whereupon the crowd of cattle-headed demons swarmed round Monkey, encircling him and swinging wildly at him with their weapons. Seeing that things were going badly, Monkey set off his somersault cloud and fled in a whoosh. The demons did not go after him but called their devils back so that everyone could have an evening meal. They told the junior devils to take a bowl of food to Sanzang as well: he was not to be dealt with until Monkey had been caught. As the master was a lifelong vegetarian and was besides feeling miserable he sobbed and let none of the food touch his lips.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story tells how Monkey rode his cloud back to the Clouds of Compassion Monastery and called, &#8220;Brothers.&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing this Pig and Friar Sand, who were waiting for him and discussing what to do, came out together to greet him with the words, &#8220;Brother, why are you only back now after being away all day? What's happened to the master?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I followed the smell of the wind right through the night till we got to a mountain and it disappeared,&#8221; Monkey replied with a smile. &#8220;Luckily the four Duty Gods told me that the mountain's called Green Dragon Mountain and that there's a Dark Essence Cave on it where three evil spirits live: King Cold-avoider, King Heat-avoider and King Dust-avoider. They've been stealing the oil here for years on end by disguising themselves as Buddhas to trick the officials of Jinping Prefecture. When they came across us this year they wickedly carried our master off with them. I told the Duty Gods and the rest of them to give the master some secret protection while I shouted insults at them from outside their doors. When the three demons came out they all looked like bullheaded demons. The first of them fought with a battle-axe, the second with a cutlass and the third with a flail. They had a whole gang of cattle-headed monsters with them, waving banners and beating drums. The fight went on all day and was still in the balance when one of the demon kings waved a flag to bring all the junior devils forward. As it was late and I was worried that I couldn't beat them I came back by somersault cloud.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I reckon it must be the Demon King of Fengdu who's making trouble for you,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;What makes you guess that?&#8221; Friar Sand asked. &#8220;I can tell because our big brother said they were all cattle-headed monsters,&#8221; replied Pig with a laugh.</P>
<P>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I saw them and they were all rhinoceros spirits.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If they're rhinos we've just got to catch them and saw their horns off,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;They'll be worth quite a bit of silver.&#8221;</P>
<P>As they were talking the monks all asked Monkey if he had eaten any supper. &#8220;I'll have something if it's no trouble,&#8221; Brother Monkey replied, &#8220;but I can do without just as well.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Surely you're hungry after fighting all day, my lord,&#8221; the monks said.</P>
<P>&#8220;You can't get hungry in a mere day,&#8221; Monkey laughed. &#8220;I once went without food for five hundred years.&#8221; The monks did not know whether he was telling the truth or joking, and a little later food was brought in that Monkey ate, after which he said, &#8220;Tidy up and go to sleep. We'll go and fight them again tomorrow and capture the demon kings so as to rescue the master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What nonsense, brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand, who was standing to one side. &#8220;As the saying goes, 'Delay brings wisdom.' It'll be terrible if that monster stays awake tonight and murders the master. We'd better go there right now and make such a row that he can't do anything. It may go badly wrong if we lose a single moment.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Pig heard this he braced himself and said, &#8220;Friar Sand's right. Let's go and put down those demons. The moon's bright enough.&#8221; Accepting their advice, Monkey left his instructions with the monks of the monastery.</P>
<P>&#8220;Look after the luggage and the horse. When we've captured the evil spirits we'll bring them back here to prove to the prefect that they're imposters. Then he can end the oil levy and relieve the common people of this hardship. That'll be a good thing, won't it?&#8221; The monks all accepted their orders while the three of them left the city by auspicious cloud. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Idleness and unrestraint</P>
<P>Threw the dhyana into confusion;</P>
<P>Danger and catastrophe</P>
<P>Led the Way-heart into delusion.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know who was to win this encounter listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>金平府元夜观灯</p>
<p>玄英洞唐僧供状</p>
</div>
<p>修禅何处用工夫？马劣猿颠速剪除。牢捉牢拴生五彩，暂停暂住堕三途。若教自在神丹漏，才放从容玉性枯。喜怒忧思须扫净，得玄得妙恰如无。话表唐僧师徒四众离了玉华城，一路平稳，诚所谓极乐之乡。去有五六日程途，又见一座城池，唐僧问行者道：“此又是甚么处所？”行者道：“是座城池，但城上有杆无旗，不知地方，俟近前再问。”及至关东厢，见那两边茶坊酒肆喧哗，米市油房热闹。街衢中有几个无事闲游的浪子，见猪八戒嘴长，沙和尚脸黑，孙行者眼红，都拥拥簇簇的争看，只是不敢近前而问。唐僧捏着一把汗，惟恐他们惹祸。又走过几条巷口，还不到城，忽见有一座山门，门上有慈云寺三字，唐僧道：“此处略进去歇歇马，打一个斋如何？”行者道：“好！好！”</p>

<p>四众遂一齐而入。但见那里边：珍楼壮丽，宝座峥嵘。佛阁高云外，僧房静月中。丹霞缥缈浮屠挺，碧树阴森轮藏清。真净土，假龙宫，大雄殿上紫云笼。两廊不绝闲人戏，一塔常开有客登。炉中香火时时爇，台上灯花夜夜荧。忽闻方丈金钟韵，应佛僧人朗诵经。四众正看时，又见廊下走出一个和尚，对唐僧作礼道：“老师何来？”唐僧道：“弟子中华唐朝来者。”那和尚倒身下拜，慌得唐僧搀起道：“院主何为行此大礼？”那和尚合掌道：“我这里向善的人，看经念佛，都指望修到你中华地托生。</p>

<p>才见老师丰采衣冠，果然是前生修到的，方得此受用，故当下拜。”唐僧笑道：“惶恐！惶恐！我弟子乃行脚僧，有何受用！若院主在此闲养自在，才是享福哩。”那和尚领唐僧入正殿，拜了佛像。唐僧方才招呼：“徒弟来耶。”原来行者三人，自见那和尚与师父讲话，他都背着脸，牵着马，守着担，立在一处，和尚不曾在心。忽的闻唐僧叫徒弟，他三人方才转面，那和尚见了，慌得叫：“爷爷呀！你高徒如何恁般丑样？”唐僧道：“丑则虽丑，倒颇有些法力，我一路甚亏他们保护。”正说处，里面又走出几个和尚作礼。先见的那和尚对后的说道：“这老师是中华大唐来的人物，那三位是他高徒。”众僧且喜且惧道：“老师中华大国，到此何为？”唐僧言：“我奉唐王圣旨，向灵山拜佛求经。适过宝方，特奔上刹，一则求问地方，二则打顿斋食就行。”那僧人个个欢喜，又邀入方丈，方丈里又有几个与人家做斋的和尚。这先进去的又叫道：“你们都来看看中华人物。原来中华有俊的，有丑的，俊的真个难描难画，丑的却十分古怪。”那许多僧同斋主都来相见。见毕，各坐下。茶罢，唐僧问道：“贵处是何地名？”</p>

<p>众僧道：“我这里乃天竺国外郡，金平府是也。”唐僧道：“贵府至灵山还有许多远近？”众僧道：“此间到都下有二千里，这是我等走过的。西去到灵山，我们未走，不知还有多少路，不敢妄对。”唐僧谢了。</p>

<p>少时，摆上斋来。斋罢，唐僧要行，却被众僧并斋主款留道：“老师宽住一二日，过了元宵，耍耍去不妨。”唐僧惊问道：</p>

<p>“弟子在路，只知有山，有水，怕的是逢怪，逢魔，把光阴都错过了，不知几时是元宵佳节。”众僧笑道：“老师拜佛与悟禅心重，故不以此为念。今日乃正月十三，到晚就试灯，后日十五上元，直至十八九，方才谢灯。我这里人家好事，本府太守老爷爱民，各地方俱高张灯火，彻夜笙箫。还有个金灯桥，乃上古传留，至今丰盛。老爷们宽住数日，我荒山颇管待得起。”唐僧无奈，遂俱住下。当晚只听得佛殿上钟鼓喧天，乃是街坊众信人等，送灯来献佛，唐僧等都出方丈来看了灯，各自归寝。</p>

<p>次日，寺僧又献斋。吃罢，同步后园闲要。果然好个去处，正是：时维正月，岁届新春。园林幽雅，景物妍森。四时花木争奇，一派峰峦迭翠。芳草阶前萌动，老梅枝上生馨。红入桃花嫩，青归柳色新。金谷园富丽休夸，《辋川图》流风慢说。水流一道，野凫出没无常；竹种千竿，墨客推敲未定。芍药花、牡丹花、紫薇花、含笑花，天机方醒；山茶花、红梅花、迎春花、瑞香花，艳质先开。阴崖积雪犹含冻，远树浮烟已带春。又见那鹿向池边照影，鹤来松下听琴。东几厦，西几亭，客来留宿；南几堂，北几塔，僧静安禅。花卉中，有一两座养性楼，重檐高拱；山水内，有三四处炼魔室，静几明窗。真个是天然堪隐逸，又何须他处觅蓬瀛。师徒们玩赏一日，殿上看了灯，又都去看灯游戏。</p>

<p>但见那：玛瑙花城，琉璃仙洞，水晶云母诸宫：似重重锦绣，迭迭玲珑。星桥影幌乾坤动，看数株火树摇红。六街箫鼓，千门璧月，万户香风。几处鳌峰高耸，有鱼龙出海，鸾凤腾空。羡灯光月色，和气融融。绮罗队里，人人喜听笙歌，车马轰轰。看不尽花容玉貌，风流豪侠，佳景无穷。众等既在本寺里看了灯，又到东门厢各街上游戏。到二更时，方才回转安置。</p>

<p>次日，唐僧对众僧道：“弟子原有扫塔之愿，趁今日上元佳节，请院主开了塔门，让弟子了此愿心。”众僧随开了门。沙僧取了袈裟，随从唐僧，到了一层，就披了袈裟，拜佛祷祝毕，即将笤帚扫了一层，卸了袈裟，付与沙僧，又扫二层，一层层直扫上绝顶。那塔上，层层有佛，处处开窗，扫一层，赏玩赞美一层。</p>

<p>扫毕下来，已此天晚，又都点上灯火。此夜正是十五元宵，众僧道：“老师父，我们前晚只在荒山与关厢看灯。今晚正节，进城里看看金灯如何？”唐僧欣然从之，同行者三人及本寺多僧进城看灯。正是：三五良宵节，上元春色和。花灯悬闹市，齐唱太平歌。又见那六街三市灯亮，半空一鉴初升。那月如冯夷推上烂银盘，这灯似仙女织成铺地锦。灯映月，增一倍光辉；月照灯，添十分灿烂。观不尽铁锁星桥，看不了灯花火树。雪花灯、梅花灯，春冰剪碎；绣屏灯、画屏灯，五彩攒成。核桃灯、荷花灯，灯楼高挂；青狮灯、白象灯，灯架高檠。虾儿灯、鳖儿灯，棚前高弄；羊儿灯、兔儿灯，檐下精神。鹰儿灯、凤儿灯，相连相并；虎儿灯、马儿灯，同走同行。仙鹤灯、白鹿灯，寿星骑坐；金鱼灯、长鲸灯，李白高乘。鳌山灯，神仙聚会；走马灯，武将交锋。万千家灯火楼台，十数里云烟世界。那壁厢，索琅琅玉韂飞来；这壁厢，毂辘辘香车辇过。看那红妆楼上，倚着栏，隔着帘，并着肩，携着手，双双美女贪欢；绿水桥边，闹吵吵，锦簇簇，醉醺醺，笑呵呵，对对游人戏彩。满城中箫鼓喧哗，彻夜里笙歌不断。有诗为证，诗曰：锦绣场中唱彩莲，太平境内簇人烟。灯明月皎元宵夜，雨顺风调大有年。</p>

<p>此时正是金吾不禁，乱烘烘的无数人烟，有那跳舞的，躧跷的，装鬼的，骑象的，东一攒，西一簇，看之不尽。却才到金灯桥上，唐僧与众僧近前看处，原来是三盏金灯。那灯有缸来大，上照着玲珑剔透的两层楼阁，都是细金丝儿编成；内托着琉璃薄片，其光幌月，其油喷香。唐僧回问众僧道：“此灯是甚油？怎么这等异香扑鼻？”众僧道：“老师不知，我这府后有一县，名唤旻天县，县有二百四十里。每年审造差徭，共有二百四十家灯油大户。府县的各项差徭犹可，惟有此大户甚是吃累，每家当一年，要使二百多两银子。此油不是寻常之油，乃是酥合香油。</p>

<p>这油每一两值价银二两，每一斤值三十二两银子。三盏灯，每缸有五百斤，三缸共一千五百斤，共该银四万八千两。还有杂项缴缠使用，将有五万余两，只点得三夜。”行者道：“这许多油，三夜何以就点得尽？”众僧道：“这缸内每缸有四十九个大灯马，都是灯草扎的把，裹了丝绵，有鸡子粗细，只点过今夜，见佛爷现了身，明夜油也没了，灯就昏了。”八戒在旁笑道：“想是佛爷连油都收去了。”众僧道：“正是此说，满城里人家，自古及今，皆是这等传说。但油干了，人俱说是佛祖收了灯，自然五谷丰登；若有一年不干，却就年成荒旱，风雨不调。所以人家都要这供献。”</p>

<p>正说处，只听得半空中呼呼风响，唬得些看灯的人尽皆四散。那些和尚也立不住脚道：“老师父，回去罢，风来了。是佛爷降祥，到此看灯也。”唐僧道：“怎见得是佛来看灯？”众僧道：</p>

<p>“年年如此，不上三更就有风来，知道是诸佛降祥，所以人皆回避。”唐僧道：“我弟子原是思佛念佛拜佛的人，今逢佳景，果有诸佛降临，就此拜拜，多少是好。”众僧连请不回。少时，风中果现出三位佛身，近灯来了。慌得那唐僧跑上桥顶，倒身下拜。行者急忙扯起道：“师父，不是好人，必定是妖邪也。”说不了，见灯光昏暗，呼的一声，把唐僧抱起，驾风而去。噫！不知是那山那洞真妖怪，积年假佛看金灯。唬得那八戒两边寻找，沙僧左右招呼。行者叫道：“兄弟！不须在此叫唤，师父乐极生悲，已被妖精摄去了！”那几个和尚害怕道：“爷爷，怎见得是妖精摄去？”行者笑道：“原来你这伙凡人，累年不识，故被妖邪惑了，只说是真佛降祥，受此灯供。刚才风到处现佛身者，就是三个妖精。我师父亦不能识，上桥顶就拜，却被他侮暗灯光，将器皿盛了油，连我师父都摄去。我略走迟了些儿，所以他三个化风而遁。”沙僧道：“师兄，这般却如之何？”行者道：“不必迟疑。你两个同众回寺，看守马匹行李，等老孙趁此风追赶去也。”</p>

<p>好大圣，急纵筋斗云，起在半空，闻着那腥风之气，往东北上径赶。赶至天晓，倐尔风息，见有一座大山，十分险峻，着实嵯峨。好山：重重丘壑，曲曲源泉。藤萝悬削壁，松柏挺虚岩。</p>

<p>鹤鸣晨雾里，雁唳晓云间。峨峨矗矗峰排戟，突突磷磷石砌磐。</p>

<p>顶巅高万仞，峻岭迭千湾。野花佳木知春发，杜宇黄莺应景妍。</p>

<p>能巍奕，实巉岩，古怪崎岖险又艰。停玩多时人不语，只听虎豹有声鼾。香獐白鹿随来往，玉兔青狼去复还。深涧水流千万里，回湍激石响潺潺。大圣在山崖上，正自找寻路径，只见四个人，赶着三只羊，从西坡下，齐吆喝“开泰”。大圣闪火眼金睛，仔细观看，认得是年、月、日、时四值功曹使者，隐像化形而来。大圣即掣出铁棒，幌一幌，碗来粗细，有丈二长短，跳下崖来，喝道：</p>

<p>“你都藏头缩颈的那里走！”四值功曹见他说出风息，慌得喝散三羊，现了本相，闪下路旁施礼道：“大圣，恕罪！恕罪！”行者道：“这一向也不曾用着你们，你们见老孙宽慢，都一个个弄懈怠了，见也不来见我一见！是怎么说！你们不在暗中保祐吾师，都往那里去？”功曹道：“你师父宽了禅性，在于金平府慈云寺贪欢，所以泰极生否，乐盛成悲，今被妖邪捕获。他身边有护法伽蓝保着哩，吾等知大圣连夜追寻，恐大圣不识山林，特来传报。”行者道：“你既传报，怎么隐姓埋名，赶着三个羊儿，吆吆喝喝作甚？”功曹道：“设此三羊，以应开泰之言，唤做三阳开泰，破解你师之否塞也。”行者恨恨的要打，见有此意，却就免之，收了棒，回嗔作喜道：“这座山，可是妖精之处？”功曹道：</p>

<p>“正是，正是。此山名青龙山，内有洞名玄英洞，洞中有三个妖精：大的个名辟寒大王，第二个号辟暑大王，第三个号辟尘大王，这妖精在此有千年了。他自幼儿爱食酥合香油。当年成精，到此假装佛像，哄了金平府官员人等，设立金灯，灯油用酥合香油。他年年到正月半，变佛像收油；今年见你师父，他认得是圣僧之身，连你师父都摄在洞内，不日要割剐你师之肉，使酥合香油煎吃哩。你快用工夫，救援去也。”行者闻言，喝退四功曹，转过山崖，找寻洞府。行未数里，只见那涧边有一石崖，崖下是座石屋，屋有两扇石门，半开半掩。门旁立有石碣，上有六字，却是青龙山玄英洞。行者不敢擅入，立定步，叫声：“妖怪！</p>

<p>快送我师父出来！”那里唿喇一声，大开了门，跑出一阵牛头精，邓邓呆呆的问道：“你是谁，敢在这里呼唤！”行者道：“我本是东土大唐取经的圣僧唐三藏之大徒弟，路过金平府观灯，我师被你家魔头摄来，快早送还，免汝等性命！如或不然，掀翻你窝巢，教你群精都化为脓血！”</p>

<p>那些小妖听言，急入里边报道：“大王！祸事了！祸事了！”</p>

<p>三个老妖正把唐僧拿在那洞中深远处，那里问甚么青红皂白，教小的选剥了衣裳，汲湍中清水洗净，算计要细切细锉，着酥合香油煎吃，忽闻得报声“祸事”，老大着惊，问是何故。小妖道：“大门前有一个毛脸雷公嘴的和尚嚷道：大王摄了他师父来，教快送出去，免吾等性命；不然，就要掀翻窝巢，教我们都化为脓血哩！”那老妖听说，个个心惊道：“才拿了这厮，还不曾问他个姓名来历。小的们，且把衣服与他穿了，带过来审他一审，端是何人，何自而来也。”众妖一拥上前，把唐僧解了索，穿了衣服，推至座前，唬得唐僧战兢兢的跪在下面，只叫：“大王饶命，饶命！”三个妖精异口同声道：“你是那方来的和尚？怎么见佛像不躲，却冲撞我的云路？”唐僧磕头道：“贫僧是东土大唐驾下差来的，前往天竺国大雷音寺拜佛祖取经的。因到金平府慈云寺打斋，蒙那寺僧留过元宵看灯。正在金灯桥上，见大王显现佛像，贫僧乃肉眼凡胎，见佛就拜，故此冲撞大王云路。”那妖精道：“你那东土到此，路程甚远，一行共有几众，都叫甚名字，快实实供来，我饶你性命。”唐僧道：“贫僧俗名陈玄奘，自幼在金山寺为僧。后蒙唐皇敕赐在长安洪福寺为僧官。</p>

<p>又因魏徵丞相梦斩泾河老龙，唐王游地府，回生阳世，开设水陆大会，超度阴魂，蒙唐王又选赐贫僧为坛主，大阐都纲。幸观世音菩萨出现，指化贫僧，说西天大雷音寺有三藏真经，可以超度亡者升天，差贫僧来取，因赐号三藏，即倚唐为姓，所以人都呼我为唐三藏。我有三个徒弟，大的个姓孙，名悟空行者，乃齐天大圣归正。”群妖闻得此名，着了一惊道：“这个齐天大圣，可是五百年前大闹天宫的？”唐僧道：“正是，正是。第二个姓猪，名悟能八戒，乃天蓬大元帅转世。第三个姓沙，名悟净和尚，乃卷帘大将临凡。”三个妖王听说，个个心惊道：“早是不曾吃他。小的们，且把唐僧将铁链锁在后面，待拿他三个徒弟来凑吃。”遂点了一群山牛精、水牛精、黄牛精，各持兵器，走出门，掌了号头，摇旗擂鼓。</p>

<p>三个妖披挂整齐，都到门外喝道：“是谁人敢在我这里吆喝！”行者闪在石崖上，仔细观看，那妖精生得：彩面环睛，二角峥嵘。尖尖四只耳，灵窍闪光明。一体花纹如彩画，满身锦绣若蜚英。第一个，头顶狐裘花帽暖，一脸昂毛热气腾；第二个，身挂轻纱飞烈焰，四蹄花莹玉玲玲；第三个，威雄声吼如雷振，獠牙尖利赛银针。个个勇而猛，手持三样兵：一个使钺斧，一个大刀能；但看第三个，肩上横担扢挞藤。又见那七长八短、七肥八瘦的大大小小妖精，都是些牛头鬼怪，各执枪棒。有三面大旗，旗上明明书着“辟寒大王”、“辟暑大王”、“辟尘大王”。孙行者看了一会，忍耐不得，上前高叫道：“泼贼怪！认得老孙么？”</p>

<p>那妖喝道：“你是那闹天宫的孙悟空？真个是闻名不曾见面，见面羞杀天神！你原来是这等个猢狲儿，敢说大话！”行者大怒，骂道：“我把你这个偷灯油的贼！油嘴妖怪，不要胡谈！快还我师父来！”赶近前，轮铁棒就打。那三个老妖，举三般兵器，急架相迎。这一场在山凹中好杀：钺斧钢刀扢挞藤，猴王一棒敢来迎。辟寒辟暑辟尘怪，认得齐天大圣名。棒起致令神鬼怕，斧来刀砍乱飞腾。好一个混元有法真空像！抵住三妖假佛形。那三个偷油润鼻今年犯，务捉钦差驾下僧。这个因师不惧山程远，那个为嘴常年设献灯。乒乓只听刀斧响，劈朴惟闻棒有声。</p>

<p>冲冲撞撞三攒一，架架遮遮各显能。一朝斗至天将晚，不知那个亏输那个赢。孙行者一条棒与那三个妖魔斗经百五十合，天色将晚，胜负未分。只见那辟尘大王把扢挞藤闪一闪，跳过阵前，将旗摇了一摇，那伙牛头怪簇拥上前，把行者围在垓心，各轮兵器，乱打将来。行者见事不谐，唿喇的纵起筋斗云，败阵而走。那妖更不来赶，招回群妖，安排些晚食，众各吃了。也叫小妖送一碗与唐僧，只待拿住孙行者等才要整治。那师父一则长斋，二则愁苦，哭啼啼的未敢沾唇不题。</p>

<p>却说行者驾云回至慈云寺内，叫声“师弟！”那八戒沙僧正自盼望商量，听得叫时，一齐出接道：“哥哥，如何去这一日方回？端的师父下落何如？”行者笑道：“昨夜闻风而赶，至天晓到一山，不见。幸四值功曹传信道：那山叫做青龙山，山中有一玄英洞。洞中有三个妖精，唤做辟寒大王、辟暑大王、辟尘大王。</p>

<p>原来积年在此偷油，假变佛像，哄了金平府官员人等。今年遇见我们，他不知好歹，反连师父都摄去。老孙审得此情，吩咐功曹等众暗中保护师父，我寻近门前叫骂。那三怪齐出，都象牛头鬼形。大的个使钺斧，第二个使大刀，第三个使藤棍，后引一窝子牛头鬼怪，摇旗擂鼓，与老孙斗了一日，杀个手平。那妖王摇动旗，小妖都来，我见天晚，恐不能取胜，所以驾筋斗回来也。”八戒道：“那里想是酆都城鬼王弄喧。”沙僧道：“你怎么就猜道是酆都城鬼王弄喧？”八戒笑道：“哥哥说是牛头鬼怪，故知之耳。”行者道：“不是！不是！若论老孙看那怪，是三只犀牛成的精。”八戒道：“若是犀牛，且拿住他，锯下角来，倒值好几两银子哩！”正说处，众僧道：“孙老爷可吃晚斋？”行者道：“方便吃些儿，不吃也罢。”众僧道：“老爷征战这一日，岂不饥了？”</p>

<p>行者笑道：“这日把儿那里便得饥！老孙曾五百年不吃饮食哩！”众僧不知是实，只以为说笑。须臾拿来，行者也吃了，道：</p>

<p>“且收拾睡觉，待明日我等都去相持，拿住妖王，庶可救师父也。”沙僧在旁道：“哥哥说那里话！常言道，停留长智。那妖精倘或今晚不睡，把师父害了，却如之何？不若如今就去，嚷得他措手不及，方才好救师父。少迟，恐有失也。”八戒闻言，抖擞神威道：“沙兄弟说得是！我们都趁此月光去降魔耶！”行者依言，即吩咐寺僧：“看守行李马匹，待我等把妖精捉来，对本府刺史证其假佛，免却灯油，以苏概县小民之困，却不是好？”众僧领诺，称谢不已。他三个遂纵起祥云，出城而去。正是那：懒散无拘禅性乱，灾危有分道心蒙。毕竟不知此去胜败何如，且听下回分解。</p>
