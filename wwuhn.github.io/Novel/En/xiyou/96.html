<P>False and True Form Combine When the Jade Hare is Captured</P>
<P>The True Female Is Converted and Meets With Spiritual Origin</P>
</div>
<P>The story tells how the Tang Priest was feeling thoroughly miserable as he accompanied the king into the inner quarters, from where a great sound of drums and music arose and fine perfumes could be smelt. He kept his head bowed, not daring to look up. Monkey, secretly very pleased, had fixed himself to the Vairocana mitre, from where he used his magic light to look around with his fiery eyes and golden pupils. There were two ranks of court ladies, making it seem like a palace of flowers or immortals, and finer than a spring breeze blowing past a brocade screen. Indeed, they were</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Graceful and charming,</P>
<P>Jadelike, and with ice-smooth skin.</P>
<P>Bewitching pairs more lovely than the girl of Chu,</P>
<P>Beauties two by two, rivaling the lady Xi Shi.</P>
<P>Their hair was coiled high like flying phoenixes;</P>
<P>Their eyebrows were just visible, low lines of distant hills.</P>
<P>Elegantly played the pipe and shawm;</P>
<P>Fast sounded flute and drum.</P>
<P>All the notes of the scale rang out,</P>
<P>Rising then falling again together.</P>
<P>Delightful were they as they danced and sang,</P>
<P>A carpet of flowers, every one of them lovely.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Seeing that his master was not in the least moved by this Monkey silently smacked his lips in admiration and said, &#8220;What a fine monk! What a fine monk!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Dwelling amid splendor, his heart forms no attachment;</P>
<P>Walking through magnificence, his mind is not confused.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A little later the princess came out of the Jay Palace surrounded by the queens and consorts so greet the king with cheers of &#8220;Long live the king! Long live the king!&#8221; This so alarmed the venerable elder that he trembled, not knowing what to do.</P>
<P>By now Monkey had already noticed a touch of the demonic&#8212;though nothing very vicious&#8212;that could just be made out in the aura above the princess's head. Monkey crawled quickly to Sanzang's ear and said, &#8220;The princess is a fake, Master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If she is a fake,&#8221; the venerable elder replied, &#8220;then how are we to make her turn back into her real form?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll give myself a magic body and catch her right here,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;That would terrify His Majesty,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;Wait till he and his queens have withdrawn before using your magic.&#8221;</P>
<P>Now Monkey had been impatient by nature all his life, so he could not restrain himself. With a great and angry roar he resumed his true from, rushed up and grabbed the princess. &#8220;You're a fine, evil beast,&#8221; he said abusively. &#8220;You've had no end of luxury here, you impostor, but it wasn't enough for you. You're so sex-crazed you had to try to trick my master and destroy his primal masculinity.&#8221; This struck the king speechless with fright, and made the queens and consorts fall about. The palace beauties all ran off to hide, fleeing for their lives. It was just like</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A roaring wind in spring,</P>
<P>The howling autumn gale.</P>
<P>When the roaring wind in spring blows through the wood</P>
<P>A thousand blossoms are shaken;</P>
<P>When the howling autumn gale hits the park</P>
<P>Ten thousand leaves all swirl and fly.</P>
<P>The tree peony beneath the balustrade is snapped;</P>
<P>Herbaceous peonies beside the balcony fall over.</P>
<P>Hibiscus on the pond's banks are shaken all about.</P>
<P>While chrysanthemums are flung in heaps at the foot of the terrace.</P>
<P>The delicate begonia collapses in the dust;</P>
<P>The fragrant rose is now sleeping in the wilds.</P>
<P>The spring wind smashes caltrop, lotus and pear;</P>
<P>Winter snows weigh down the plum tree's tender blossoms.</P>
<P>The petals of the pomegranate</P>
<P>Are scattered all around the inner courtyard;</P>
<P>The branches of the willow</P>
<P>Are blown sideways within the royal palace.</P>
<P>Fine blooms, and a night of raging wind and rain:</P>
<P>Countless red petals carpet the ground with brocade.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sanzang hastily put his trembling arms round the king and said, &#8220;Don't be afraid, Your Majesty. It is only my wicked disciple using his magical powers to find out whether she is an impostor or not.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Seeing that things were going badly for her, the evil spirit broke free, tore off her clothes, flung down her jewelry and hair ornaments and ran to the shrine of the local deity in the palace garden. From here she brought out a short club shaped like the head of a trip-hammer, with which she started hitting wildly at Monkey as she turned quickly towards him. Monkey, who had caught up with her at once, struck back at her face with his iron cudgel, Shouting and roaring at each other, the two of them started fighting in the palace gardens. Then each began a great display of magic powers, riding clouds as they battled in mid air. In this fight</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Great was the fame of the gold-banded cudgel;</P>
<P>No one had heard of the hammerhead club.</P>
<P>One of them was there to fetch the true scriptures;</P>
<P>The other was lingering for love of rare flowers.</P>
<P>Long had the demon known of the holy Tang Priest,</P>
<P>And she longed to mate with his primal seed-juices.</P>
<P>In a past year she had carried off the real princess,</P>
<P>And taken the form of the king's true daughter.</P>
<P>When she met the Great Sage, who saw her evil aura,</P>
<P>He could tell true from false as he came to save a life.</P>
<P>The murderous club was flung at the head;</P>
<P>The mighty iron cudgel struck back at the face.</P>
<P>Ranting and roaring, they were locked in struggle,</P>
<P>Filling the skies and blotting out the sun.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As the two of them battled in mid air they terrified the common people of the city, and struck fear into all the officials at court. The venerable elder kept saying as he supported the king, &#8220;Don't be alarmed, and please tell Her Majesty and all the others not to be afraid. Your princess is an impostor pretending to be her. When my disciple has captured her you will be able to see whether she is good or evil.&#8221; Some of the bolder consorts brought clothes and jewelry to show the queen.</P>
<P>&#8220;These are what the princess wore. She tore them off and is fighting that monk up in the sky stark naked. She must be an evil spirit.&#8221; Only then did the king, queens and consorts come to their senses and look up into the sky.</P>
<P>When the evil spirit and the Great Sage had been fighting for half a day without either emerging as victor Monkey threw his cudgel up and called &#8220;Change!&#8221; One turned into ten, ten into a hundred, and a hundred into a thousand. Half the sky was filled with writhing serpents and pythons striking wildly at the evil spirit. With a flurry of her hands and feet she turned into a pure wind and fled into the azure sky. Monkey said a spell, took all the iron cudgels back into a single cudgel, and went straight after her magic light.</P>
<P>As he approached the Western Gate of Heaven and saw the dazzling flags and banners Monkey shouted at the top of his voice, &#8220;Heavenly gatekeepers, stop that evil spirit and don't let her get away.&#8221; The gate was being held by the Heavenly King Lokapala with the four great marshals Pang, Liu, Gou and Bi, who did indeed use their weapons to block the way. As she could not get further she turned straight back and started fighting Monkey with her short club.</P>
<P>As he wheeled his iron cudgel the Great Sage looked carefully at her and saw that one end of her club was thick and one end thin, just like the lead of a trip-hammer used for hulling with a mortar, so he gave a furious roar and shouted, &#8220;Beast! What's that implement you're holding? How dare you fight me with it? Surrender at once or I'll smash your skull with a single blow from my cudgel.&#8221;</P>
<P>Grinding her teeth, the evil spirit replied, &#8220;You don't know about this weapon of mine, so listen while I tell you:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Its immortal root was a piece of mutton-fat jade,</P>
<P>Which took countless years to be worked into shape.</P>
<P>It was already mine when chaos was separated;</P>
<P>When the primal disorder was sorted out I came first.</P>
<P>Its origins cannot be compared with mere mortal things;</P>
<P>Its nature has always belonged to the highest heaven.</P>
<P>Embodying the golden light and the four images</P>
<P>With the auspicious vapors of the Five Elements and the Three Primaries.</P>
<P>Long did it live with me in the Moon Palace,</P>
<P>Staying beside me in the Cassia Hall.</P>
<P>For love of flowers I descended to the mortal world,</P>
<P>Coming to India as a beautiful impostor.</P>
<P>The only reason why I shared the King's pleasures</P>
<P>Was because I wanted my destined marriage with the Tang Priest.</P>
<P>How could you be so cruel as to ruin this fine mating,</P>
<P>Pursuing me and giving rein to your vicious nature?</P>
<P>Great is the fame of this implement of mine,</P>
<P>Which is older than your cudgel with gold bands.</P>
<P>It was a drug-pounding pestle in the Moon Palace:</P>
<P>One blow from this and a life is ended.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he replied with a mocking laugh, &#8220;Evil beast! If you used to live in the Toad Palace you must have heard of my powers. How dare you argue with me! Turn back into your real self and surrender at once if I'm to spare your life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I know you,&#8221; the monster replied. &#8220;You're the Protector of the Horses who made great havoc in the palaces of Heaven five hundred years ago. By rights I ought to give way to you, but because you've wrecked my marriage I hate you as much as if you'd killed my mother and father. It's more than I can stand for. I'm going to kill you, you Protector of the Horses, for breaking the laws of Heaven.&#8221; The words Protector of the Horses always infuriated the Great Sage, so the moment he heard them he flew into a great rage, lifted his iron cudgel and struck at her face. The evil spirit swung her pestle in reply. A ferocious battle then ensued in front of the Western Gate of Heaven. In this combat there were</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A gold-banded cudgel,</P>
<P>A drug-pounding pestle,</P>
<P>Two immortals' weapons, a worthy match.</P>
<P>One had come down to earth for the sake of a marriage;</P>
<P>The other was there to protect the Tang Priest.</P>
<P>It was because the king was not a righteous one</P>
<P>And loved flowers that he attracted the evil spirit,</P>
<P>Causing today's bitter strife</P>
<P>As two of them gave Ml play to their stubbornness of heart.</P>
<P>Charging and rushing each other they strove for triumph;</P>
<P>In cutting words they fought on with their tongues.</P>
<P>Rare was the martial prowess of the medicine pestle,</P>
<P>But finer still was the iron cudgel's might.</P>
<P>A powerful golden light flashed at the heavenly gates;</P>
<P>Brilliantly coloured mists went right down to the earth.</P>
<P>After a dozen rounds of fighting to and fro</P>
<P>The evil spirit became too weak to resist.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the evil spirit had fought another dozen or so rounds with Brother Monkey she could see how thick and fast his blows were coming, and realized that she could not win. Feinting with her pestle, she shook herself and fled due South in ten thousand beams of golden light with the Great Sage in pursuit. Suddenly they reached a great mountain, where the evil spirit landed her golden light and disappeared into a cave. Monkey, who was worried that she might escape, return to India and do some underhand harm to the Tang Priest, made sure he could recognize the mountain then turned his cloud round and went straight back to the capital.</P>
<P>It was now about four in the afternoon. The king was clinging to Sanzang, shivering and shaking as he kept saying, &#8220;Save me, holy monk!&#8221;</P>
<P>The consorts and queens were all in a panic as the Great Sage came down from the clouds with a cry of, &#8220;Here I am, Master!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stand still, Wukong,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;You must not alarm His Majesty. Now, I am asking you what in fact happened about the imitation princess.&#8221; Standing outside the Jay Palace, Monkey put his hands together in front of his chest and said, &#8220;The imitation princess was an evil spirit. First of all I fought her for half a day, and she couldn't beat me, so she turned into a pure wind and fled straight to the gates of heaven. I shouted to the gods to block her way. She turned back into her real self and fought another dozen or so rounds with me. Then she turned herself into golden light and fled due South to a mountain, beaten. I chased her as fast as I could till I got to the mountain, but I couldn't find her anywhere. Then I came back because I was worried she might come here to harm you.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the king heard this he grabbed hold of the Tang Priest and asked, &#8220;If the false princess was an evil spirit, where is my real princess?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When I've caught the false princess your real princess will turn up by herself,&#8221; Monkey replied straight away. When the queens and consorts heard this their fears vanished, and each of them came forward to bow and say, &#8220;We beg you to rescue our real princess, holy monk, and sort out the light from the dark. You will be richly rewarded.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is no place for us to talk,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I beg Your Majesty to go from the inner quarters to the throne hall with my master. Her Majesty and the rest of them should all go back to the inner palace, and my fellow-disciples Pig and Friar Sand should be sent for to protect my master so that I can go and subdue the demon. That will keep a proper distinction between the inner and outer quarters of the palace, and spare me from worrying. I am going to sort this out to show my sincerity.&#8221;</P>
<P>The king accepted the suggestion and was boundlessly grateful. He led the Tang Priest out of the inner quarters and straight to the throne hall. All the queens and consorts returned to the inner palace. A vegetarian meal was ordered while Pig and Friar Sand were sent for. The two of them soon arrived. Monkey explained to them both about what had happened and told them to guard the master carefully. The Great Sage set off by his cloud somersault and flew up into mid air. All the officials in front of the throne hall looked up into the sky and bowed low.</P>
<P>The Great Sage Monkey went straight to the mountain that lay due South. When the evil spirit had fled in defeat to the mountain and gone into her den she blocked the entrance with boulders and lay hidden there, terrified. Having looked around for a while and seen no sign of life Monkey felt very impatient, so he made a spell with his hands and said the magic words, calling out the local deity and mountain god to be questioned. A moment later the two gods arrived, kowtowed and said, &#8220;We didn't realize, we didn't realize. If we had known we'd have gone a long way to meet you. We beg you to forgive us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I won't hit you just now,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;Tell me what this mountain's called. How many evil spirits are there here? Tell me the truth and I'll forgive you your crimes.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; the two gods replied, &#8220;this mountain is called Mount Hairtrip. There are three have warrens in the mountain, but from remote antiquity there have never been any evil spirits here. This is a blessed land of five felicities. Great Sage, if you want to find an evil spirit, take the road to the Western Heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've reached the kingdom of India in the Western Heaven, where the king has a princess who was carried off by an evil spirit and abandoned in the wilds. The evil spirit turned herself into the princess's double to deceive the king into building a decorated tower from which she could throw an embroidered ball to find herself a husband. When I got to the foot of the tower while escorting the Tang Priest she deliberately hit the Tang Priest because she wanted to mate with him and lure his primal masculinity out of him. When I saw through her I turned back into myself in the palace to catch her. She threw off her human clothes and jewels and fought with me for half a day with a short club that she called a medicine-pounding pestle. Then she turned herself into a pure wind and disappeared. When I chased her as far as the Western Gate of Heaven and fought another dozen or more with her she realized she couldn't beat me, turned herself into golden right and fled here. Why didn't you see her!&#8221;</P>
<P>When the two gods heard this they led Brother Monkey to search the three warrens. When they first looked by the warren at the foot of the mountain a few frightened hares were startled and ran away. When their search reached the cave at the top of the mountain they saw that the entrance was blocked with two great boulders.</P>
<P>&#8220;The evil spirit must have gone inside,&#8221; the local god said, &#8220;when you were chasing her so hard.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey then pried the boulders apart with his iron cudgel. The evil spirit, who was indeed hiding in there, sprang out with a whoosh, raising her medicine pestle to strike him with. As Monkey swung his cudgel to parry her blow the mountain deity fell back in terror and the local god fled.</P>
<P>From the demon's mouth came abusive grumbles: &#8220;Who told you to bring him here to find me?&#8221; She continued to fend off the iron cudgel as she fled up into mid air in a fighting retreat.</P>
<P>Just at the moment of crisis, when it was getting late in the day, Monkey became more vicious than ever and his blows were even harder. He wished he could finish her off with a single stroke. Just then a call came from the ninefold azure sky of, &#8220;Don't strike, Great Sage! Don't strike! Be kind with your cudgel.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey turned round he saw that it was the Star Lord of the Moon leading his beauties and immortals down on multicolored clouds to stand in front of him. A flustered Monkey at once put his iron cudgel away, bowed and said, &#8220;Where are you going, Old Man? I'm sorry I didn't keep out of your way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The evil spirit fighting you is the Jade Hare who pounds the immortal elixir of mysterious dew in my palace,&#8221; the Moon replied. &#8220;A year ago she secretly opened the golden locks on the jade gates and absconded from the palace. As I reckoned that she would be in mortal peril I have come here to save her life. I do beg you, Great Sage, to spare her life out of consideration for me.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey assented, saying only, &#8220;I wouldn't dare harm her, I wouldn't dare. No wonder she's so good with a medicine-pounding pestle. She's the Jade Hare. What you don't know, Old Moon, is that she has kidnapped the king of India's daughter, made herself into the princess's double, and wants to ruin my master's primal masculinity although he's a holy monk. This is the truth. We can't stand for crimes like that. How can you possibly let her off so lightly?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There are things you don't know,&#8221; the Moon replied. &#8220;That king's daughter is no ordinary mortal. She was the White Beauty from the Moon Palace. Eighteen years ago she slapped the Jade Hare, after which she longed for the human world and came down to it in a beam of magic light to the womb of the king's senior queen. She was born then. The Jade Hare was getting her own back for that slap when she ran away from the palace last year and threw White Beauty into the wilds. But she was wrong to want to marry the Tang Priest. That's an offence she mustn't get away with. It was a good thing you were careful enough to see through her before she ruined your master. But I plead with you to forgive her for my sake and let me take her back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If that's why it happened,&#8221; Brother Monkey replied with a smile, &#8220;I wouldn't dare to make any objections. But if you take the Jade Hare back I'm worried that the king might not believe it, so I'd like to trouble you and the immortal sisters to take the Jade Hare over there to prove it to the king. Then I'll be able to show off my powers and explain how White Beauty came down to earth. I'll make the king fetch Princess White Beauty to prove the truth of retribution.</P>
<P>The Moon was persuaded, so he pointed at the evil spirit and shouted, &#8220;Repent and submit, evil beast!&#8221; The Jade Hare rolled on the ground and turned back into her real form. Indeed she was</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Gap-lipped and sharp-toothed,</P>
<P>Long-eared and with few whiskers.</P>
<P>Her body was covered with jade-coloured fur;</P>
<P>When she stretched out her legs she flew over mountains.</P>
<P>Her straight nose was like yogurt,</P>
<P>Glossier than face-cream with powder.</P>
<P>Two eyes glowed red,</P>
<P>Brighter than dots of rouge on the snow.</P>
<P>Crouching on the ground</P>
<P>She was a heap of pure white silk;</P>
<P>When she stretched herself out</P>
<P>She was a structure of dazzling silver wire.</P>
<P>Often did she</P>
<P>Drink in the purest dew of the heavenly dawn,</P>
<P>Pounding the elixir with her pestle of jade.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the Great Sage saw this he was delighted, and treading clouds and light he led the way as the Moon Lord brought all the beauties and immortals, taking the Jade Hare with them as they headed straight for India. It was now dusk, and the moon was slowly rising. When they reached the walls of the capital they heard the drums being beaten on the watch-towers. The king and the Tang Priest were still inside the throne hall, while Pig, Friar Sand and the officials were standing in front of the steps. They were just discussing whether the king should withdraw when a sheet of coloured cloud as bright as day was seen due South.</P>
<P>When they all raised their heads to look they heard the Great Sage Monkey shouting at the top of his voice, &#8220;Your Majesty, King of India, ask your queens and consorts to come out and look. Under this canopy is the Star Lord of the Moon Palace, and the immortal sisters to either side of him are the beauties of the moon. This Jade Hare was the bogus princess of yours who has now turned back into her real form.&#8221; The king then quickly called his queen, consorts, palace beauties and maids out, and they all kowtowed towards the sky. The king, the Tang Priest and the officials also bowed to the sky in thanks. There was nobody in any house throughout the whole city who did not set out an altar on which to burn incense, kowtow and recite the name of the Buddha.</P>
<P>Just when everyone was looking up Pig felt a surge of uncontrollable desire, leapt up into the air and flung his arms round an immortal girl dressed in a rainbow. &#8220;We're old Mends, darling,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Let's go and have a bit of fun.&#8221; Monkey went up to Pig, grabbed hold of him, gave him a couple of slaps and swore at him: &#8220;You village idiot. What sort of place is this for getting randy?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I was just going to chat her up for a bit of fun,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>The Moon Lord had his celestial canopy turned about as he took the Jade Hare straight back to the Moon Palace with all his beauties. Brother Monkey threw Pig down into the dust, then was thanked by the king in the throne hall.</P>
<P>When the king was told what had happened he said, &#8220;We are very grateful to you, holy monk, for using your great magical powers to capture the imitation princess. But where is our real daughter?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;She is no ordinary human either,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;but the immortal girl White Beauty from the Moon Palace. Because she slapped the Jade Hare in the face eighteen years ago she yearned for the lower world, came down to the womb of Your Majesty's senior queen and was born here. It was because the Jade Hare nursed her old grudge that she surreptitiously opened the golden lock on the jade gate's, came down here, abandoned White Beauty in the wilds and made herself look like White Beauty to deceive you. The Moon Lord himself told me about this chain of events. Today we've got rid of the imposter, and tomorrow I'll invite Your Majesty to go in your royal carriage to fetch the real one.&#8221;</P>
<P>This came as rather a shock to the king, who said with the tears streaming down his cheeks, &#8220;Daughter! In all the time since we came to the throne as a child we have never even gone outside the city gates. Where are we to go to look for you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No need to upset yourself,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile. &#8220;Your daughter is now in the Almsgiver's Spread Gold Monastery, pretending to be mad. Everyone can go home now. Tomorrow morning I'll bring your real princess back to you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please stop worrying, Your Majesty,&#8221; the officials all said, kowtowing. &#8220;These holy monks are all Buddhas who can ride clouds and mists: they are sure to know all about causes and effects in the future and the past. If we trouble the holy monks to come with us tomorrow to look for her we will learn the truth.&#8221;</P>
<P>Accepting their suggestion, the king invited the monks to the Lingering Spring Pavilion, where a vegetarian meal was provided and they were to spend the night. By now it was almost the second watch. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The copper water-clock drips in the moon's bright glow;</P>
<P>The chimes of the golden bell are carried by the wind.</P>
<P>When the cuckoo sings the spring is half-way gone;</P>
<P>The blossoms fall aimlessly as the third watch draws near.</P>
<P>The swing casts a shadow in deserted royal gardens;</P>
<P>The silver river spans the sky's blue vault.</P>
<P>No travelers are to be seen in markets and streets;</P>
<P>The constellations make the night sky shine.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>That night they all went to bed, and of that no more need be said.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>During the night the king lost his demonic aura, and his spirit grew with great speed, so that at three marks after the fifth watch he came out of the inner quarters to give audience once more. When the audience was over he ordered that the Tang Priest and his three disciples be fetched to discuss the search for the princess. Sanzang then came and did obeisance to the king, while the Great Sage and the other two also paid their respects. The king bowed to them and said, &#8220;Yesterday you spoke of our daughter the princess. May we trouble you divine monks to find and rescue her?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The day before yesterday we had been walking from the East till evening,&#8221; the venerable elder replied, &#8220;when we saw the Almsgiver's Spread Gold Monastery. We went inside to ask for accommodation and had the good fortune to be entertained by the monks there. After supper I took a moonlight stroll in the former Spread Gold Garden, and as I was looking at the remains I heard wailing. When I asked what it was all about, an ancient monk, over a hundred years old, sent everyone else away before telling me, 'Now, about that wailing, in the late spring of last year I was enjoying the moon when suddenly heard a gust of wind and the sound of someone grieving. I got out of bed, went into the Jetavana and saw a girl there. When I questioned her the girl said, &#8220;I am a princess, the daughter of the king of India. The wind blew me here when I was looking at the flowers by moonlight.&#8221;' The ancient monk knows a lot about correct behavior, so he locked the princess up in a quiet, out-of-the-way cell. As he was worried that the monks of the monastery might sully her he put it about that he had locked up an evil spirit. The princess, who understood what he was doing, ranted and raved during the day and demanded food and tea. Only late at night, when there was nobody about, did she think of her mother and father and cry for them. The ancient monk did come to the capital to make enquiries several times, but when he found that the princess was well and in the palace he didn't dare say anything or submit a memorial. When the ancient monk saw that my disciple had some magic powers he repeatedly insisted that we were to come here to investigate. I never expected that she would turn out to be the Jade Hare from the Moon Palace who had put on an imitation of the real body and made herself look like the princess. She was also set on ruining my primal masculinity. Fortunately my disciple showed his mighty magic and detected the fraud. The Jade Hare has now been recaptured by the Moon Lord. Your worthy princess is now pretending to be crazy in the Spread Gold Monastery.&#8221;</P>
<P>After hearing the story in all this detail the king started to weep aloud. This soon alarmed the queens and consorts of the three palaces and six compounds, who all came out to ask why. Everybody began to weep bitterly, and it was a long time before the king asked, &#8220;How far is the Spread Gold Monastery from the city?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Only twenty miles,&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>The king then issued these commands: &#8220;Let the Queens of the Eastern and Western Palaces look after the court while the High Minister takes charge of the nation's business. We are going to the monastery with our Senior Queen, our officials and the four holy monks to fetch the princess.&#8221;</P>
<P>Carriages were at once prepared and a line of them left the palace. Watch as Brother Monkey sprang up into the air and with a bend of his back was the first to reach the monastery. The monks all hastily knelt to greet him.</P>
<P>&#8220;When you left, sir,&#8221; they said, &#8220;you walked with the others, so why did you come down from the sky today?&#8221;</P>
<P>To this Monkey replied with a smile, &#8220;Where is your ancient teacher? Ask him to come out straight away, and set out incense tables to welcome His Majesty. The king and queen of India, the officials and my master are all coming.&#8221; The monks could not understand what he meant, so they asked the ancient monk to come out.</P>
<P>When the ancient monk saw Monkey he prostrated himself before him with the words, &#8220;What has happened about the princess, sir?&#8221; Monkey told him all about how the imitation princess had thrown the embroidered ball, wanted to mate with the Tang Priest, been chased, fought, and been recaptured by the Moon Lord as the Jade Hare. The ancient monk kowtowed to him again in thanks.</P>
<P>&#8220;Please stop kowtowing,&#8221; said Monkey, helping him up, &#8220;please stop. Hurry up and get ready to receive His Majesty.&#8221; Only then did the monks realize that it was a girl locked up in the garden at the back. Surprised and delighted, they all set out a row of incense tables outside the monastery gates, put on their cassocks and started striking the bell and the drum. Soon after this the king's carriage arrived. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The sky is filled with clouds of holy incense;</P>
<P>Sudden blessing comes to the monastery.</P>
<P>The rainbow flows for a thousand years; rivers and seas are pure.</P>
<P>The eternal spring round which lightning flickers is finer than those of Yu and Tang.</P>
<P>Thanks to the royal grace the plants' colours are finer than ever;</P>
<P>The wild flowers have extra fragrance because of this generosity.</P>
<P>Men of distinction have always left their mark behind them;</P>
<P>Today all rejoice at an enlightened king's arrival.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the king arrived outside the monastery gates the monks were all lined up on their knees in orderly ranks, bowing low in greeting. Monkey stood in the middle. &#8220;How did you arrive first, holy monk?&#8221; the king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;It just took a little bend of my waist for me to get here,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why were you such a long time coming?&#8221; After this the Tang Priest and the others all arrived. He led the royal carriage to the building at the back where the princess was still raving and pretending to be crazy.</P>
<P>The ancient monk knelt down, pointed towards her and said, &#8220;This is Her Royal Highness the princess who was blown here by a wind the other year.&#8221; The king ordered the cell opened. When the iron locks were undone and the door opened the king and queen saw and recognized the princess.</P>
<P>Not caring about the filth, they went up to her and threw their arms round her. &#8220;Our poor child,&#8221; they said, &#8220;how did you come to suffer these torments and have so terrible a time here?&#8221; How true it is that the meeting of parents and child is not like that of other people. The three of them sobbed aloud, their arms round each other's heads. When they had cried for a while and told each other what had happened since they were parted, scented hot water was sent for. The princess bathed and changed her clothes before they all climbed into carriages to go back to the capital.</P>
<P>Monkey then put his hands together in greeting to the king and said, &#8220;I have something else to put to you, Your Majesty.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Say it, whatever it is, holy monk,&#8221; the king said, returning his greeting, &#8220;and we will do as you ask.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This mountain of theirs,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;is called Mount Hundredfoot. They tell me that centipedes have been turning into spirits here recently and injuring people by night. This is very awkward for travelling merchants. As I see it, only chickens can deal with centipedes, so a thousand extra-large cockerels should be chosen and then scattered across the mountainside to get rid of these venomous insects. The mountain could be renamed and you could make a land grant to these monks to thank them for looking after the princess.&#8221;</P>
<P>This suggestion pleased the king greatly, and he accepted it. Officials were then sent back to the city to fetch cocks, while the mountain was renamed Mount Splendor. The Department of Works was instructed to provide the materials for the monastery to be rebuilt, a deed of enfeoffment was written describing the mountain as &#8220;Mount Splendor, granted to the Almsgiver's Spread Gold Monastery,&#8221; and the ancient monk was given the title National Benefactor Hierarch, a title that was to be handed on to his successors in perpetuity, together with a stipend of thirty-six bushels of grain. The monks all thanked the king for his kindness and saw him off on his way back to the capital. Here the princess returned to the inner palace and was greeted by all the ladies in turn. A banquet was then laid on to cheer the princess up and congratulate her on her deliverance. The queen and her daughter were reunited; king and ministers were together. We will not describe the night's feasting.</P>
<P>Early the next morning the king ordered that painters make portraits of the countenances of the four holy monks to be kept in the Sino-Barbarian Hall. The princess was also invited to come out from the throne hall in her new finery to thank the Tang Priest and the other three for saving her from her suffering. When she had thanked them the Tang Priest took his leave of the king to continue his journey West. The king refused to let them go, but ordered great banquets at which they feasted for five or six days. The idiot really was given a good time, and he enjoyed putting as much food in his stomach as he possibly could. When the king saw how determined they were to visit the Buddha he realized that no matter how hard he tried he would not be able to keep them. He had two hundred ingots of gold and silver brought out, as well as a tray of jewels for each of them as an expression of thanks. Master and disciples refused to accept anything. The king then ordered the royal carriage prepared, invited the master to enter it, and instructed officials to escort them a long way. The queens, consorts, officials and common people all kowtowed endlessly in thanks. As they went along the way their monks all came out to kowtow to them in farewell; none of them could bear to be parted from the travelers. Seeing that the people seeing them off were unwilling to turn back. Monkey had no option but to make a spell with his hands and blow a magic breath in the direction of the trigram of the wind, Xun, so that a dark wind stopped all the escorts from seeing them. Only then did the travelers get away. This was indeed a case of</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Washing away the waves of gratitude their natures returned to the end;</P>
<P>Leaving the sea of gold they were aware of true emptiness.</P>

<p>假合真形擒玉兔</p>
<p>真阴归正会灵元</p>
</div>
<p>却说那唐僧忧忧愁愁，随着国王至后宫，只听得鼓乐喧天，随闻得异香扑鼻，低着头，不敢仰视。行者暗里欣然，丁在那毗卢帽顶上，运神光，睁火眼金睛观看，又只见那两班彩女，摆列的似蕊宫仙府，胜强似锦帐春风。真个是：娉婷嬝娜，玉质冰肌。一双双娇欺楚女，一对对美赛西施。云髻高盘飞彩凤，娥眉微显远山低。笙簧杂奏，箫鼓频吹。宫商角徵羽，抑扬高下齐。清歌妙舞常堪爱，锦砌花团色色怡。行者见师父全不动念，暗自里咂嘴夸称道：“好和尚！好和尚！身居锦绣心无爱，足步琼瑶意不迷。”</p>

<p>少时，皇后嫔妃簇拥着公主出鳷鹊宫，一齐迎接，都道声：</p>

<p>“我王万岁，万万岁！”慌的个长老战战兢兢，莫知所措。行者早已知识，见那公主头顶上微露出一点妖氛，却也不十分凶恶，即忙爬近耳朵叫道：“师父，公主是个假的。”长老道：“是假的，却如何教他现相。”行者道：“使出法身，就此拿他也。”长老道：</p>

<p>“不可！不可！恐惊了主驾，且待君后退散，再使法力。”那行者一生性急，那里容得，大咤一声，现了本相，赶上前揪住公主骂道：“好孽畜！你在这里弄假成真，只在此这等受用也尽彀了，心尚不足，还要骗我师父，破他的真阳，遂你的淫性哩！”唬得那国王呆呆挣挣，后妃跌跌爬爬，宫娥彩女，无一个不东躲西藏，各顾性命。好便似：春风荡荡，秋气潇潇。春风荡荡过园林，千花摆动；秋气潇潇来径苑，万叶飘摇。刮折牡丹敧槛下，吹歪芍药卧栏边。沼岸芙蓉乱撼，台基菊蕊铺堆。海棠无力倒尘埃，玫瑰有香眠野径。春风吹折芰荷楟，冬雪压歪梅嫩蕊。石榴花瓣，乱落在内院东西；岸柳枝条，斜垂在皇宫南北。好花风雨一宵狂，无数残红铺地锦。三藏一发慌了手脚，战兢兢抱住国王，只叫：“陛下，莫怕！莫怕！此是我顽徒使法力，辨真假也。”</p>

<p>却说那妖精见事不谐，挣脱了手，解剥了衣裳，捽捽头摇落了钗环首饰，即跑到御花园土地庙里，取出一条碓嘴样的短棍，急转身来乱打行者。行者随即跟来，使铁棒劈面相迎。他两个吆吆喝喝，就在花园斗起，后却大显神通，各驾云雾，杀在空中。这一场：金箍铁棒有名声，碓嘴短棍无人识。一个因取真经到此方，一个为爱奇花来住迹。那怪久知唐圣僧，要求配合元精液。旧年摄去真公主，变作人身钦爱惜。今逢大圣认妖氛，救援活命分虚实。短棍行凶着顶丢，铁棒施威迎面击。喧喧嚷嚷两相持，云雾满天遮白日。他两个杀在半空赌斗，吓得那满城中百姓心慌，尽朝里多官胆怕。长老扶着国王，只叫：</p>

<p>“休惊！请劝娘娘与众等莫怕。你公主是个假作真形的，等我徒弟拿住他，方知好歹也。”那些妃子有胆大的，把那衣服钗环拿与皇后看了，道：“这是公主穿的，戴的，今都丢下，精着身子，与那和尚在天上争打，必定是个妖邪。”此时国王后妃人等才正了性，望空仰视不题。</p>

<p>却说那妖精与大圣斗经半日，不分胜败。行者把棒丢起，叫一声“变！”就以一变十，以十变百，以百变千，半天里，好似蛇游蟒搅，乱打妖邪。妖邪慌了手脚，将身一闪，化道清风，即奔碧空之上逃走。行者念声咒语，将铁棒收做一根，纵祥光一直赶来。将近西天门，望见那旌旗熌灼，行者厉声高叫道：“把天门的，挡住妖精，不要放他走了！”真个那天门上有护国天王帅领着庞刘苟毕四大元帅，各展兵器拦阻。妖邪不能前进，急回头，舍死忘生，使短棍又与行者相持。这大圣用心力轮铁棒，仔细迎着看时，见那短棍儿一头壮，一头细，却似春碓臼的杵头模样，叱咤一声喝道：“孽畜！你拿的是甚么器械，敢与老孙抵敌！快早降伏，免得这一棒打碎你的天灵！”那妖邪咬着牙道：“你也不知我这兵器！听我道：仙根是段羊脂玉，磨琢成形不计年。混沌开时吾已得，洪蒙判处我当先。源流非比凡间物，本性生来在上天。一体金光和四相，五行瑞气合三元。随吾久住蟾宫内，伴我常居桂殿边。因为爱花垂世境，故来天竺假婵娟。与君共乐无他意，欲配唐僧了宿缘。你怎欺心破佳偶，死寻赶战逞凶顽！这般器械名头大，在你金箍棒子前。广寒宫里捣药杵，打人一下命归泉！”行者闻说，呵呵冷笑道：“好孽畜啊！你既住在蟾宫之内，就不知老孙的手段？你还敢在此支吾？</p>

<p>快早现相降伏，饶你性命！”那怪道：“我认得你是五百年前大闹天宫的弼马温，理当让你。但只是破人亲事，如杀父母之仇，故此情理不甘，要打你欺天罔上的弼马温！”那大圣恼得是弼马温三字，他听得此言，心中大怒，举铁棒劈面就打。那妖邪轮杵来迎，就于西天门前，发狠相持。这一场：金箍棒，捣药杵，两般仙器真堪比。那个为结婚姻降世间，这个因保唐僧到这里。</p>

<p>原来是国王没正经，爱花引得妖邪喜。致使如今恨苦争，两家都把顽心起。一冲一撞赌输赢，劖语劖言齐斗嘴。药杵英雄世罕稀，铁棒神威还更美。金光湛湛幌天门，彩雾辉辉连地里。来往战经十数回，妖邪力弱难搪抵。那妖精与行者又斗了十数回，见行者的棒势紧密，料难取胜，虚丢一杵，将身幌一幌，金光万道，径奔正南上败走，大圣随后追袭，忽至一座大山，妖精按金光，钻入山洞，寂然不见。又恐他遁身回国，暗害唐僧，他认了这山的规模，返云头径转国内。</p>

<p>此时有申时矣。那国王正扯着三藏，战战兢兢只叫：“圣僧救我！”那些嫔妃皇后也正怆惶，只见大圣自云端里落将下来，叫道：“师父，我来也！”三藏道：“悟空立住，不可惊了圣躬。我问你：假公主之事，端的如何？”行者立于鳷鹊宫外，叉手当胸道：“假公主是个妖邪。初时与他打了半日，他战不过我，化道清风，径往天门上跑，是我吆喝天神挡住。他现了相，又与我斗到十数合，又将身化作金光，败回正南上一座山上。我急追至山，无处寻觅，恐怕他来此害你，特地回顾也。”国王听说，扯着唐僧问道：“既然假公主是个妖邪，我真公主在于何处？”行者应声道：“待我拿住假公主，你那真公主自然来也。”那后妃等闻得此言，都解了恐惧，一个个上前拜告道：“望圣僧救得我真公主来，分了明暗，必当重谢，”行者道：“此间不是我们说话处，请陛下与我师出宫上殿，娘娘等各转各宫，召我师弟八戒沙僧来保护师父，我却好去降妖。一则分了内外，二则免我悬心，谨当辨明，以表我一场心力。”国王依言，感谢不已，遂与唐僧携手出宫，径至殿上，众后妃各各回宫。一壁厢教备素膳，一壁厢请八戒沙僧。须臾间，二人早至。行者备言前事，教他两个用心护持。这大圣纵筋斗云，飞空而去，那殿前多官，一个个望空礼拜不题。</p>

<p>孙大圣径至正南方那座山上寻找。原来那妖邪败了阵，到此山，钻入窝中，将门儿使石块挡塞，虚怯怯藏隐不出。行者寻一会不见动静，心甚焦恼，捻着诀，念动真言，唤出那山中土地山神审问。少时，二神至了，叫头道：“不知不知，知当远接。万望恕罪！”行者道：“我且不打你，我问你：这山叫做甚么名字？</p>

<p>此处有多少妖精？从实说来，饶你罪过。”二神告道：“大圣，此山唤做毛颖山，山中只有三处兔穴。亘古至今没甚妖精，乃五环之福地也。大圣要寻妖精，还是西天路上去有。”行者道：“老孙到了西天天竺国，那国王有个公主被个妖精摄去，抛在荒野，他就变做公主模样，戏哄国王，结彩楼，抛绣球，欲招驸马。</p>

<p>我保唐僧至其楼下，被他有心打着唐僧，欲为配偶，诱取元阳。</p>

<p>是我识破，就于宫中现身捉获。他就脱了人衣、首饰，使一条短棍，唤名捣药杵，与我斗了半日，他就化清风而去。被老孙赶至西天门，又斗有十数合，他料不能胜，复化金光，逃至此处，如何不见？”二神听说，即引行者去那三窟中寻找，始于山脚下窟边看处，亦有几个草兔儿，也惊得走了。寻至绝顶上窟中看时，只见两块大石头，将窟门挡住。土地道：“此间必是妖邪赶急钻进去也。行者即使铁棒捎开石块，那妖邪果藏在里面，呼的一声，就跳将出来，举药杵来打。行者轮起铁棒架住，唬得那山神倒退，土地忙奔。那妖邪口里囔囔突突的，骂着山神土地道：</p>

<p>“谁教你引着他往这里来找寻！”他支支撑撑的，抵着铁棒，且战且退，奔至空中。正在危急之际，却又天色晚了。这行者愈发狠性，下毒手，恨不得一棒打杀，忽听得九霄碧汉之间，有人叫道：“大圣，莫动手！莫动手！棍下留情！”行者回头看时，原来是太阴星君，后带着姮娥仙子，降彩云到于当面。慌得行者收了铁棒，躬身施礼道：“老太阴，那里来的？老孙失回避了。太阴道：“与你对敌的这个妖邪，是我广寒宫捣玄霜仙药之玉兔也。他私自偷开玉关金锁走出宫来，经今一载。我算他目下有伤命之灾，特来救他性命，望大圣看老身饶他罢。”行者喏喏连声，只道：“不敢！不敢！怪道他会使捣药杵！原来是个玉兔儿！</p>

<p>老太阴不知，他摄藏了天竺国王之公主，却又假合真形，欲破我圣僧师父之元阳。其情其罪，其实何甘！怎么便可轻恕饶他？”太阴道：“你亦不知。那国王之公主，也不是凡人，原是蟾宫中之素娥。十八年前，他曾把玉兔儿打了一掌，却就思凡下界。一灵之光，遂投胎于国王正宫皇后之腹，当时得以降生。这玉兔儿怀那一掌之仇，故于旧年走出广寒，抛素娥于荒野。但只是不该欲配唐僧，此罪真不可逭。幸汝留心，识破真假，却也未曾伤损你师。万望看我面上，恕他之罪，我收他去也。”行者笑道：“既有这些因果，老孙也不敢抗违。但只是你收了玉兔儿，恐那国王不信，敢烦太阴君同众仙妹将玉兔儿拿到那厢，对国王明证明证，一则显老孙之手段，二来说那素娥下降之因由，然后着那国王取素娥公主之身，以见显报之意也。”太阴君信其言，用手指定妖邪，喝道：“那孽畜还不归正同来！”玉兔儿打个滚，现了原身。真个是：缺唇尖齿，长耳稀须。团身一块毛如玉，展足千山蹄若飞。直鼻垂酥，果赛霜华填粉腻；双睛红映，犹欺雪上点胭脂。伏在地，白穰穰一堆素练；伸开腰，白铎铎一架银丝。几番家吸残清露瑶天晓，捣药长生玉杵奇。</p>

<p>那大圣见了不胜欣喜，踏云光向前引导，那太阴君领着众姮娥仙子，带着玉兔儿，径转天竺国界。此时正黄昏，看看月上，到城边，闻得谯楼上擂鼓。那国王与唐僧尚在殿内，八戒沙僧与多官都在阶前，方议退朝，只见正南上一片彩霞，光明如昼。众抬头看处，又闻得孙大圣厉声高叫道：“天竺陛下，请出你那皇后嫔妃看者。这宝幢下乃月宫太阴星君，两边的仙妹是月里嫦娥。这个玉兔儿却是你家的假公主，今现真相也。”那国王急召皇后嫔妃与宫娥彩女等众，朝天礼拜，他和唐僧及多官亦俱望空拜谢。满城中各家各户，也无一人不设香案，叩头念佛。正此观看处，猪八戒动了欲心，忍不住跳在空中，把霓裳仙子抱住道：“姐姐，我与你是旧相识，我和你耍子儿去也。”行者上前揪着八戒，打了两掌骂道：“你这个村泼呆子！此是甚么去处，敢动淫心！”八戒道：“拉闲散闷耍子而已！”那太阴君令转仙幢，与众嫦娥收回玉兔，径上月宫而去。行者把八戒揪落尘埃。这国王在殿上谢了行者，又问前因道：“多感神僧大法力捉了假公主，朕之真公主，却在何处所也？”行者道：“你那真公主也不是凡胎，就是月宫里素娥仙子。因十八年前，他将玉兔儿打了一掌，就思凡下界，投胎在你正宫腹内，生下身来。那玉兔儿怀恨前仇，所以于旧年间偷开玉关金锁走下来，把素娥摄抛荒野，他却变形哄你。这段因果，是太阴君亲口才与我说的。今日既去其假者，明日请御驾去寻其真者。”国王闻说，又心意惭惶，止不住腮边流泪道：“孩儿！我自幼登基，虽城门也不曾出去，却教我那里去寻你也！”行者笑道：“不须烦恼，你公主现在给孤布金寺里装风。今且各散，到天明我还你个真公主便是。”</p>

<p>众官又拜伏奏道：“我王且心宽，这几位神僧，乃腾云驾雾之神佛，必知未来过去之因由。明日即烦神僧四众同去一寻，便知端的。”国王依言，即请至留春亭摆斋安歇。此时已近二更，正是那：铜壶滴漏月华明，金铎叮当风送声。杜宇正啼春去半，落花无路近三更。御园寂寞秋千影，碧落空浮银汉横。三市六街无客走，一天星斗夜光晴。当夜各寝不题。</p>

<p>这一夜，国王退了妖气，陡长精神，至五更三点复出临朝。</p>

<p>朝毕，命请唐僧四众议寻公主。长老随至，朝上行礼。大圣三人，一同打个问讯。国王欠身道：“昨所云公主孩儿，敢烦神僧为一寻救。”长老道：“贫僧前日自东来，行至天晚，见一座给孤布金寺，特进求宿，幸那寺僧相待。当晚斋罢，步月闲行，行至布金旧园，观看基址，忽闻悲声入耳。询问其由，本寺一老僧，年已百岁之外，他屏退左右，细细的对我说了一遍，道：‘悲声者，乃旧年春深时，我正明性月，忽然一阵风生，就有悲怨之声。下榻到捽园基上看处，乃是一个女子。询问其故，那女子道，我是天竺国国王公主。因为夜间玩月观花，被风刮至于此。’那老僧多知人礼，即将公主锁在一间僻静房中，惟恐本寺顽僧污染，只说是妖精被我锁住。公主识得此意，日间胡言乱语，讨些茶饭吃了；夜深无人处，思量父母悲啼。那老僧也曾来国打听几番，见公主在宫无恙，所以不敢声言举奏。因见我徒弟有些神通，那老僧千叮万嘱，教贫僧到此查访。不期他原是蟾宫玉兔为妖，假合真形，变作公主模样，他却又有心要破我元阳。幸亏我徒弟施威显法，认出真假，今已被太阴星收去。贤公主见在布金寺装风也。”国王见说此详细，放声大哭。早惊动三宫六院，都来问及前因。无一人不痛哭者。良久，国王又问：</p>

<p>“布金寺离城多远？”三藏道：“只有六十里路。”国王遂传旨：</p>

<p>“着东西二宫守殿，掌朝太师卫国，朕同正宫皇后帅多官、四神僧，去寺取公主也。”</p>

<p>当时摆驾，一行出朝。你看那行者就跳在空中，把腰一扭，先到了寺里。众僧慌忙跪接道：“老爷去时，与众步行，今日何从天上下来？”行者笑道：“你那老师在于何处？快叫他出来，排设香案接驾。天竺国王、皇后、多官与我师父都来了。”众僧不解其意，即请出那老僧，老僧见了行者，倒身下拜道：“老爷，公主之事如何？”行者把那假公主抛绣球，欲配唐僧，并赶捉赌斗，与太阴星收去玉兔之言，备陈了一遍。那老僧又磕头拜谢，行者搀起道：“且莫拜，且莫拜，快安排接驾。”众僧才知后房里锁得是个女子。一个个惊惊喜喜，便都设了香案，摆列山门之外，穿了袈裟，撞起钟鼓等候。不多时，圣驾早到，果然是：缤纷瑞霭满天香，一座荒山倏被祥。虹流千载清河海，电绕长春赛禹汤。草木沾恩添秀色，野花得润有余芳。古来长者留遗迹，今喜明君降宝堂。国王到于山门之外，只见那众僧齐齐整整，俯伏接拜，又见孙行者立在中间，国王道：“神僧何先到此？”行者笑道：“老孙把腰略扭一扭儿，就到了，你们怎么就走这半日？”随后唐僧等俱到。长老引驾，到于后面房边，那公主还装风胡说。老僧跪指道：“此房内就是旧年风吹来的公主娘娘。”</p>

<p>国王即令开门。随即打开铁锁，开了门。国王与皇后见了公主，认得形容，不顾秽污，近前一把搂抱道：“我的受苦的儿啊！你怎么遭这等折磨，在此受罪！”真是父母子女相逢，比他人不同，三人抱头大哭。哭了一会，叙毕离情，即令取香汤，教公主沐浴更衣，上辇回国。</p>

<p>行者又对国王拱手道：“老孙还有一事奉上。”国王答礼道：“神僧有事吩咐，朕即从之。”行者道：“他这山，名为百脚山。近来说有蜈蚣成精，黑夜伤人，往来行旅，甚为不便。我思蜈蚣惟鸡可以降伏，可选绝大雄鸡千只，撒放山中，除此毒虫。</p>

<p>就将此山名改换改换。赐文一道敕封，就当谢此僧存养公主之恩也。”国王甚喜领诺，随差官进城取鸡；又改山名为宝华山，仍着工部办料重修，赐与封号，唤做“敕建宝华山给孤布金寺。”把那老僧封为“报国僧官”，永远世袭，赐俸三十六石。僧众谢了恩，送驾回朝。公主入宫，各各相见，安排筵宴，与公主释闷贺喜。后妃母子，复聚首团圞，国王君臣，亦共喜饮宴一宵不题。</p>

<p>次早，国王传旨，召丹青图下圣僧四众喜容，供养在华夷楼上，又请公主新妆重整，出殿谢唐僧四众救苦之恩。谢毕，唐僧辞王西去。那国王那里肯放，大设佳宴，一连吃了五六日，着实好了呆子，尽力放开肚量受用。国王见他们拜佛心重，苦留不住，遂取金银二百锭，宝贝各一盘奉谢，师徒们一毫不受。教摆銮驾，请老师父登辇，差官远送，那后妃并臣民人等俱各叩谢不尽。及至前途，又见众僧叩送，俱不忍相别。行者见送者不肯回去，无已，捻诀往巽地上吹口仙气，一阵暗风，把送的人都迷了眼目，方才得脱身而去。这正是：沐净恩波归了性，出离金海悟真空。毕竟不知前路如何，且听下回分解。</p>
