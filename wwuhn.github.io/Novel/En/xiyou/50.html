<P>Sanzang's Great Misfortune Is to Fall into the River</P>
<P>Guanyin's Fish Basket Saves the Tang Priest</P>
</div>
<P>The story tells how the Great Sage Monkey took his leave of the old Chen brothers, went with Pig and Friar Sand to the bank of the river, and told the two of them to decide which of them would go into the water first. &#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;you should go first; neither of us two has very special powers.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;To be frank with you, brother,&#8221; replied Monkey. &#8220;I wouldn't need any help from either of you in dealing with mountain spirits, but I can't cope in the water. If I go into rivers or seas I have to make hand spells to keep the water away, or else change into something like a fish or a crab. But if I'm making a hand spell I can't get a good swing with my cudgel, use my powers, or kill evil spirits. I asked you two to go in because I've long known that you're both good swimmers.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;I'll go, but I don't know what we'll find at the bottom of the river. I think we should all go. You should turn yourself into something or else let me carry you through the water to find the monster's den. You go first and discover what's been happening. If the master hasn't been hurt and is still there we can do our best to attack the monster. But if the monster has used magic on the master and he's has been drowned or eaten there will be no point in searching too hard; we'd better find something else to do instead.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right, brother,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Which of you will carry me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Pig was secretly delighted at this question. &#8220;Goodness only knows how many times that ape has put one over on me,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;As he can't swim I'll carry him and put one over on him this time.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; he said, chuckling, &#8220;I'll carry you.&#8221; Realizing that Pig was up to something Monkey decided to beat him at his own game and replied, &#8220;Very well, you're stronger than Friar Sand.&#8221; Pig then took Monkey on his back.</P>
<P>Friar Sand parted a way through the waters of the River of Heaven for the brother-disciples. When they had covered thirty or forty miles on the riverbed the idiot made a grab for Monkey, who pulled out one of his hairs and turned it into a double of himself that he put on Pig's back, while changing his real self into a pig louse that clung firmly to the idiot's ear. Pig suddenly stumbled as he walked along, threw Monkey forward and made him fall. Now as the double was only a hair transformed it floated up and disappeared.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand to Pig, &#8220;what are you doing? Why have you fallen over in the mud instead of walking along properly? And even if you have to do that, where have you dropped Monkey?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He couldn't stop himself falling,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;and he's vanished. Never mind whether he's alive or dead. We two will go and find the master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;we need him. He's no swimmer but he's cleverer than us. If he not coming I won't go with you.&#8221; Monkey could restrain himself no longer.</P>
<P>&#8220;Pig!&#8221; he shouted at the top of his voice from inside the ear. &#8220;I'm here.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Friar Sand heard this he said with a laugh, &#8220;That's done it. You're the one that's had it, you idiot. You had a nerve, trying to put one over on him. What are we going to do now? We can hear him but he's disappeared.&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig knelt in the mud and started to kowtow desperately, saying, &#8220;I did wrong, brother, I did wrong. When we've rescued the master I'll apologize to you properly on shore. Where did you talk to us from? You scared me to death. Please, please turn back into yourself. I'll carry you, and I promise not to knock you about any more.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've been carrying me all the time,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I won't play any tricks on you. Now, get going, and fast.&#8221; The idiot staggered to his feet still mumbling apologies and pressed on with Friar Sand.</P>
<P>After another thirty or forty miles they looked up to see a tall building on which was written in large letters RESIDENCE OF THE RIVER TURTLE. &#8220;This must be where the monster lives,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;We two can't go up to the doors and challenge him to battle without finding out how things stand.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wujing,&#8221; said Brother Monkey to Friar Sand, &#8220;is there water inside and outside the door?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;In that case you two hide near here while I take a look round,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage climbed out of Pig's ear, shook himself, turned into a female shrimp with long legs, and reached the doors with two or three jumps. When he took a good look around he saw the monster sitting up above the door with all his watery tribe drawn up around him and the female mandarin fish sitting at his side. They were all discussing how to eat the Tang Priest. Monkey looked carefully around but could see the master nowhere. Then he noticed another female shrimp coming over and standing in the portico to the West. Monkey leapt forward and called, &#8220;Sister-in-law, where is this Tang Priest that His Majesty and everyone else are talking about eating?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;His Majesty caught him yesterday when he made all that snow and ice,&#8221; the female shrimp replied. &#8220;He's now in a stone chest behind the palace. If his disciples don't come here to make trouble we'll have music and feast on him tomorrow.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he kept up his act for a little longer then went straight round to the back of the palace where he found a stone chest just like a stone pig-trough in a sty or a stone coffin. He measured it, found that it was six feet long, lay on it and listened. He could hear Sanzang sobbing inside. Monkey said nothing but put his ear against the lid, listened more carefully, and could make out Sanzang gnashing his teeth and saying amid moans,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;If only my fate had not always been so bad:</P>
<P>Disasters in rivers all my life have I had.</P>
<P>Soon after I was born I was floated on the water,</P>
<P>And now that have I drowned never I will not see Lord Buddha.</P>
<P>Not so long ago the Black River made me weep,</P>
<P>And now the breaking ice has consigned me to the deep.</P>
<P>I wonder if at any time my followers will come</P>
<P>To let me fetch the scriptures and complete my journey home.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey could not restrain himself from calling to him, &#8220;Master, don't be so upset about troubles by water. As the Classic of Water Disaster has it, 'Earth is the mother of the Five Elements, and water is their origin. Without earth there can be no life, and without water there can be no growth.' I'm here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Save me, disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang, hearing Monkey's voice.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;I promise we'll save you when we've captured the monster.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Act fast,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;If I'm here for another day I'll die of suffocation.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No problem,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;no problem. I'm off.&#8221; He turned, sprang out through the main doors, turned back into himself, and called for Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;What's happening?&#8221; asked the idiot and Friar Sand as they came up to him.</P>
<P>&#8220;The monster caught the master with that trick,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;He's unhurt, but the monster has put him inside a stone chest. You two challenge the monster to battle at once while I get out of the water. Capture him if you can, and if you can't then pretend to be beaten and lure him out of the water for me to kill.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Out you go, brother, and don't worry,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;We'll find out what the monster's really like.&#8221; Monkey then made a water-averting spell with his hands, shot up through the waves, and stood on the bank to wait.</P>
<P>Watch while Pig charges at the doors in a murderous mood yelling, &#8220;Damned monster, give us our master back.&#8221;</P>
<P>The little devils inside the doors rushed back in panic to report, &#8220;Your Majesty, there are people outside asking for their master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It must be those bloody monks here,&#8221; said the monster. &#8220;Fetch my armor and weapons at once.&#8221; The little devils ran to fetch them, and when the monster was in his armor and holding his weapons in his hand he ordered that the doors be opened. As he came out Pig and Friar Sand, who were standing one to each side, could see how he was dressed and equipped. He was a fine monster. Just look:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On his head a gleaming helmet of gold,</P>
<P>On his body golden armor that made a rainbow.</P>
<P>His belt was studded thick with pearls and jade;</P>
<P>The strange boots on his feet were of smoky yellow leather.</P>
<P>His nose was as high as a mountain ridge,</P>
<P>His brow as majestically broad as a dragon's.</P>
<P>Fierce and round were his eyes that flashed,</P>
<P>Spikes of steel were his sharp, neat teeth.</P>
<P>His short, matted hair seemed to be ablaze,</P>
<P>And his long whiskers bristled like golden spikes.</P>
<P>In his mouth he was chewing a tender reed</P>
<P>While he wielded a nine-knobbed mace of copper.</P>
<P>The noise when the doors were opened wide</P>
<P>Rivaled the crashing of thunder in spring.</P>
<P>Few such could be seen in the world of mortals:</P>
<P>The Great King truly deserves his title.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The evil spirit came outside accompanied by a hundred or more of his little devils, who brandished their swords and spears as they formed themselves up into two companies. &#8220;Where are you from, monks,&#8221; he asked Pig, &#8220;and why are you making this horrible noise here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You got away before, but I'll get you now, damned monster,&#8221; Pig shouted back. &#8220;Stop pretending you don't know who I am&#8212;we've had words already. I'm a disciple of the holy priest from the Great Tang who's going to worship the Buddha and collect the scriptures in the Western Heaven. You and your little tricks, calling yourself the Great King of Miraculous Response, and eating boys and girls in Chen Village. Can't you recognize me? I was the Chen family's little girl, Pan of Gold.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Monk,&#8221; said the monster, &#8220;you're a disgrace. You deserve to be punished for fraudulent impersonation if you turned yourself into that girl. You wounded the back of my hand although I never ate you. I let you off that time, so why have you come to my front door looking for me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean, let me off?&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;You made that cold wind and the snow, froze the river, and are going to kill the master. As soon as you give him back there'll be no more trouble, but if you so much as start to say no you'll get it from this rake of mine, and it'll show you no mercy.&#8221;</P>
<P>The evil spirit's response to this was a mocking laugh. &#8220;That's fancy talk, monk,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but it's a load of nonsense, except that I did make the cold, the snow and the ice and I have captured your master. You may think you can get him back by coming here and shouting, but this time things are different. Last time I was unarmed as I was going to a banquet, which was why you took me by surprise and wounded me. This time I'll fight three rounds with you if you don't make yourself scarce. If you're a match for me I'll give you back your master, but if you're not, you'll be eaten too.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a good little boy,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;Just what I expected to hear from you. Watch out for my rake!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So you only became a monk in middle life,&#8221; said the monster.</P>
<P>&#8220;You really do have some miraculous responsiveness, my boy,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;How did you know that?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you fight with a rake that must mean you used to be a hired hand in a vegetable garden and stole it,&#8221; said the monster.</P>
<P>&#8220;My boy,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;this isn't a farming rake. Just look at it:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Its mighty prongs are like dragon claws</P>
<P>Set with gold in the from of serpents.</P>
<P>In battle with a foe it makes cold winds</P>
<P>Till it gives off flames in a longer fight.</P>
<P>It kills off demons for the holy priest</P>
<P>Subduing evil spirits on the journey West.</P>
<P>When it stirs up clouds it bolts out sun and moon,</P>
<P>Making the colours of sunset brightly shine.</P>
<P>It could knock down Mount Tai, to the terror of the tigers,</P>
<P>Turn the oceans upside down, alarming all the dragons.</P>
<P>I could spare you for the sake of your mighty powers,</P>
<P>But if I struck you with the rake it would make nine holes.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Refusing to believe this the monster raised his copper mace and struck at Pig's head. Pig parried the blow with his rake and said, &#8220;Damn you, you're just an evil creature turned spirit in middle life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you tell that?&#8221; the monster asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;As you fight with a mace I think you must have worked as a furnace-man for a silversmith, got your hands on that hammer, and stolen it,&#8221; Pig replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's no silversmith's hammer,&#8221; the monster said. &#8220;Look at it:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Its nine knobs all are like the buds of flowers</P>
<P>Growing on a sprig of an evergreen plant.</P>
<P>This never was a product of the earthly world,</P>
<P>For it came from the gardens of immortal beings.</P>
<P>Its green and purple fruit matured by the Jade Pool;</P>
<P>Its pure fragrance was formed beside the Nephrite Pond.</P>
<P>Because I worked and tempered it with diligence and skill</P>
<P>It now is hard as steel and miraculously sharp.</P>
<P>Spears, swords and halberds are not its worthy rivals;</P>
<P>Battleaxe and partisan do not dare approach.</P>
<P>No matter how sharp are the prongs of your rake,</P>
<P>If they touch my hammer they'll bend and they'll break.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This conversation between the two of them was too much for Friar Sand, who came forward and said, &#8220;Monster, stop all that empty talk. As the saying goes, actions speak louder than words. Wait there and see how you like my staff.&#8221;</P>
<P>The monster parried it with his mace and replied, &#8220;You're another one who became a monk in middle life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you tell?&#8221; Friar Sand asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;From the look of you you must have been a miller before,&#8221; the monster replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;What makes you think that?&#8221; Friar Sand asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why would you fight with a noodle-making pole if you weren't a miller?&#8221; the monster asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;You evil thing,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;What you can't see is that</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Few are the weapons like this one in the world</P>
<P>Which is why you do not know what this staff of mine is called.</P>
<P>It grew in a shadeless part of the moon,</P>
<P>Was shaped from the trunk of a Sala-tree.</P>
<P>The jewels set around it shine with many colours,</P>
<P>And solid is the blessing that is packed inside.</P>
<P>Once it was present at the Jade Emperor's banquets</P>
<P>Now it protects the priest from the Tang.</P>
<P>On this road to the West it is utterly unknown,</P>
<P>But great is its fame in the palaces of Heaven.</P>
<P>It is known as the precious demon-quelling staff,</P>
<P>And with a single blow it could pulverize your brow.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The evil spirit allowed no more arguments and the three of them now became deadly foes. They fought a fine battle under the water:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Mace, staff and rake,</P>
<P>Wuneng and Wujing against the monster.</P>
<P>One was Marshal Tian Peng come to earth,</P>
<P>One a great general down from Heaven.</P>
<P>Both showed their prowess in attacking the water monster,</P>
<P>Who put up a good fight against the heavenly monks.</P>
<P>They had the good fortune to complete the great Way,</P>
<P>Overcoming each other in an endless sequence.</P>
<P>Earth defeated water;</P>
<P>When water was dried out the river-bed showed.</P>
<P>Water gave birth to wood,</P>
<P>Which blossomed when it was growing well.</P>
<P>Dhyana and meditation were all the same;</P>
<P>Refining cinnabar and alchemy submitted to the Three Schools,</P>
<P>Earth was the mother,</P>
<P>Yielding sprouts of metal,</P>
<P>And metal yielded the liquid that gave birth to the babe.</P>
<P>Water was the root</P>
<P>That nurtured wood's flourishing,</P>
<P>Which rivaled in its glory the glow of sunset.</P>
<P>Because the elements were crowded together</P>
<P>They all turned hostile and started to fight.<SUP>:</SUP></P>
<P>See how bright are the nine knobs on the mace</P>
<P>While the staff is decorated with many-coloured silks.</P>
<P>The rake crushed positive and negative,</P>
<P>Divided the Nine Bright Shiners,</P>
<P>And swung in a tangle without any order.</P>
<P>They were ready to die to save the Tang Priest,</P>
<P>Prepared to give their lives for Sakyamuni Buddha.</P>
<P>They kept the mace of copper busy without respite</P>
<P>Parrying the blows of the staff and the rake.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the three of them had been fighting under the water for four full hours without either side emerging as victor Pig realized that they were not going to beat the monster and gave Friar Sand a nod. Pretending that they were beaten, the two of them turned and fled, trailing their weapons behind them.</P>
<P>&#8220;Hold your ground here, little ones,&#8221; said the monster to his underlings, &#8220;while I go after those wretches. When I catch those damned monks I'll bring them back for you all to eat.&#8221; Watch him as he emerges above the water in pursuit of the two of them like the wind driving fallen leaves or a rainstorm beating down withered blossoms.</P>
<P>Monkey meanwhile had been standing on the bank watching the water with unwavering eyes. Suddenly he saw the waves thrown into turmoil as with a great roar Pig leapt ashore.</P>
<P>&#8220;He's coming,&#8221; he said, &#8220;he's coming.&#8221;</P>
<P>Next Friar Sand reached the bank saying, &#8220;He's coming, he's coming.&#8221;</P>
<P>Then came the monster after them shouting, &#8220;Where've you gone?&#8221;</P>
<P>No sooner had his head come into view than Monkey struck with his cudgel, shouting, &#8220;Take that!&#8221; The evil spirit swerved to avoid it then parried with his copped mace. While the one stirred up the waves in the river the other showed his prowess on the shore. Before three rounds of the fight had been fought the monster, unable to keep up his resistance, did a feint and plunged back into the water, whereupon the wind fell and the waves subsided.</P>
<P>&#8220;Thank you, brothers,&#8221; said Monkey, going back up the high bank.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;you may not think that monster is up to much on the shore, but he's a real terror underwater. Pig and I attacking together were only as good as him alone. How are we going to deal with him and rescue the master?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We've no time to lose,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;He may kill the master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll trick him into coming out,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;You wait up in the air and say nothing at all. When you reckon his head is above the water, hit him a good hard one on the forehead from upside-down. Even if that doesn't kill him his head will ache and he'll feel faint. When I catch him one with my rake that'll settle his score.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Good idea,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;good idea. That's what they call a coordinated attack, and it will do the trick.&#8221; The two of them went back into the water.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The evil monster fled to his palace in defeat, where the other demons greeted him and the mandarin fish asked, &#8220;Where did Your Majesty chase those two monks to?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They have an accomplice,&#8221; the monster replied. &#8220;When they jumped ashore he swung an iron cudgel at me. I dodged it and fought back. Goodness only know how heavy that cudgel is: I couldn't keep it off me with my mace. He sent me back here beaten in less than three rounds.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Can you remember what their accomplice looks like, Your Majesty?&#8221; the mandarin fish asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;He's a monk with a hairy face that looks like a thunder god's,&#8221; the monster replied, &#8220;pointed ears, a broken nose, and fiery eyes with golden pupils.&#8221; At this the mandarin fish shuddered.</P>
<P>&#8220;Thank goodness Your Majesty could see how good a fighter he was and ran away,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You would never have survived another three rounds. I know who that monk is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Who is he then?&#8221; the monster asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;When I was in the Eastern Ocean many years ago I once heard the old dragon king talk of his fame. He's the Handsome Monkey King, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven who made himself into a golden Immortal of the Supreme Monad and made havoc in Heaven five hundred years ago. Now he has submitted to the Buddha's teachings, changed his name to Sun Wukong the Novice, and is protecting the Tang Priest on his journey to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures. He has enormous divine powers and can do all sorts of transformations. Your Majesty, you must not provoke him or have any more fights with him.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before these remarks were out of her mouth the little devils from by the door came back to report, &#8220;Your Majesty, those two monks are back here challenging you to battle again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Good sister,&#8221; said the monster, &#8220;you are very wise. I won't go out, but I'll see what happens.&#8221; He sent this urgent order: &#8220;Little ones, shut the doors firmly. As they say,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>You can stand outside and roar,</P>
<P>But we won't unlock the door.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>They can hang around for a couple of days, and when they can't take any more and go away we'll feast on the Tang Priest at our ease.&#8221;</P>
<P>The little demons piled up rocks and made a clay cement to seal the doors firmly shut. When the repeated shouts of Pig and Friar Sand failed to bring the monster out the idiot lost his patience and started to smash the doors with his rake, but they were so firmly barricaded that even though he broke up the doors themselves with seven or eight blows there were still so many layers of clay and rocks behind them that he had no hope of getting through.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand when he saw this, &#8220;that demon is so scared that he's barricaded his doors and won't come out. We'd better go back to the shore and discuss it with Monkey.&#8221; Pig agreed and they returned to the Eastern bank.</P>
<P>When Monkey, who was waiting up in the mist and clouds with his cudgel in his hand, saw the two of them emerge with no demon after them he landed his cloud on the bank to meet them. &#8220;Brothers,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;why haven't you brought him up with you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The monster has barricaded his doors and won't show himself,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;When Brother Pig smashed his doors down he saw that the doorway was strongly blocked up with clay and rocks, and as we can't fight him we've come back to discuss with you some other way of saving the master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It sounds hopeless,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;You two patrol the bank and don't let the monster escape while I'm away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you going, brother?&#8221; asked Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm going to Potaraka to call on the Bodhisattva,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and find out about the monster's name and background. When I've found his ancestral home and captured his relations and neighbors I'll come back to get him and rescue the master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But doing all that will be too much trouble and take far too long,&#8221; laughed Pig. &#8220;I assure you it won't take any time or trouble,&#8221; replied Brother Monkey. &#8220;I'll soon be back.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage set off from the river bank at high speed on his auspicious cloud and headed for the Southern Sea. Within an hour Potaraka Island was in view, and he landed the cloud on Pota Cliff, where the twenty-four devas, the guardian god of the island, Moksa the Novice, the boy Sudhana, and the Naga Maiden Pengzhu all came forward to bow in greeting and ask, &#8220;Why have you come, Great Sage?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There is something about which I would like to see the Bodhisattva,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;The Bodhisattva left her cave this morning to go to her bamboo grove,&#8221; the devas replied. &#8220;She allowed nobody to accompany her, but as she knew that you would be coming today she told us to wait here to greet you. Since you will not be able to see her at once would you please sit under the Turquoise Cliff until the Bodhisattva comes out and decides what to do.&#8221;</P>
<P>Brother Monkey did as they suggested, but before he had sat down the page Sudhana came up to him and said with a bow, &#8220;Great Sage Sun, thanks to you earlier kindness the Bodhisattva deigned to keep me. I never leave her side, and am always at the foot of her lotus throne. She has been very good to me.&#8221; Monkey, who knew that he had previously been the Red Boy, laughed as he said, &#8220;You were so confused by evil then that you only realize I'm a good person now you've been converted.&#8221;</P>
<P>When he had been waiting for a long time but the Bodhisattva had still not appeared Monkey said anxiously. &#8220;Will you please report that I'm here? Time's being lost, and I'm worried that my master may be killed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We would not dare,&#8221; the devas replied. &#8220;The Bodhisattva told us to wait till she came herself.&#8221; Monkey, who was much too impatient to wait a moment longer, rushed inside.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Handsome Monkey King</P>
<P>Was impatient and very snide.</P>
<P>The devas could not hold him back,</P>
<P>When he wanted to go inside.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He strode deep into the grove,</P>
<P>Eyes wide as he peered around.</P>
<P>He saw the Saviour sitting on</P>
<P>Bamboo leaves on the ground.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>She was not washed or combed,</P>
<P>And her face was free of care.</P>
<P>There were no tassels to hold in place</P>
<P>The silken strands of her hair.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>She did not wear her plain blue robe,</P>
<P>But only a clinging vest,</P>
<P>A skirt of brocade round her waist,</P>
<P>And both arms left undressed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>There was no shawl for her shoulders;</P>
<P>On her foot she wore no shoe.</P>
<P>Her jade hand held a knife of steel</P>
<P>With which she peeled bamboo.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Monkey saw her he could not restrain himself from shouting, &#8220;Bodhisattva, your disciple Sun Wukong offers his pious respects.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wait outside,&#8221; said the Bodhisattva.</P>
<P>&#8220;Bodhisattva,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;my master is in trouble and I have come to inquire respectfully about the background of the evil monster in the River of Heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Get out,&#8221; said the Bodhisattva, &#8220;and wait till I come out.&#8221;</P>
<P>Not daring to push his demands any harder, Monkey had to leave the bamboo grove and say to all the devas, &#8220;The Bodhisattva seems to be spring cleaning. Why is she cutting strips of bamboo in the grove, and not properly dressed, instead of sitting on her lotus throne?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We don't know,&#8221; said the devas. &#8220;She left the cave and went into the grove this morning before dressing, telling us to receive you here. It must be something to do with you, Great Sage.&#8221; Monkey could do nothing but wait.</P>
<P>Before long the Bodhisattva emerged from the grove carrying a basket made from purple bamboo. &#8220;Wukong,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you and I are going to rescue the Tang Priest.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey fell to his knees and replied, &#8220;Your disciple has the temerity to suggest that you should dress and take your seat on your lotus throne.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There will be no need to dress; I shall go as I am,&#8221; the Bodhisattva replied, after which she dismissed the devas and set off on an auspicious cloud. Monkey could only follow.</P>
<P>In a moment they were on the banks of the River of Heaven. When Pig and Friar Sand saw them they said to each other, &#8220;That brother of ours is too impatient. Goodness only knows what sort of row he must have made in the Southern Sea to make the Bodhisattva come rushing here before she was even properly dressed.&#8221; Before these words were out of their mouths Guanyin reached the bank, and the two of them bowed low to her saying, &#8220;Bodhisattva, we shouldn't have done it, we were wrong, forgive us.&#8221; The Bodhisattva undid the silken sash around her waistcoat, tied one end to the basket, and rose on a coloured cloud.</P>
<P>Holding the other end of the sash she threw the basket into the river then pulled it up through the current, reciting, &#8220;Die if you go, live if you stay, die if you go, live if you stay.&#8221; When she had said this seven times she raised the basket again, and this time it contained a glistening goldfish, blinking its eyes and moving its scales. &#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said the Bodhisattva, &#8220;go down into the water and rescue your master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How can I?&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;The monster hasn't been caught yet.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Isn't that him in the basket?&#8221; the Bodhisattva asked.</P>
<P>Pig and Friar Sand then bowed low and asked, &#8220;How could that fish have had such great powers?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It originally was a goldfish that I raised in my lotus pool,&#8221; the Bodhisattva replied. &#8220;Every day it would swim up to listen to sutras, and it trained itself to have magic powers. The nine-knobbed copper mace was an unopened lotus bud that it tempered and made into a weapon. One day, I do not know when, a high tide reached the pool and carried it here. When I was leaning on the balustrade looking at the lotuses this morning I noticed that the wretch had not come to pay his respects, so I examined my fingers and the palms of my hands and worked out that it must have become a spirit and be planning to kill your master. That was why I did not wait to dress before using my divine powers to weave a bamboo basket in which to catch him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;could you stay here a moment longer? We would like to let the faithful in Chen Village gaze upon your golden countenance, Bodhisattva. This would be a great kindness, and it would also teach common folk to believe and make offerings by showing them how that demon was subdued.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the Bodhisattva. &#8220;Call them here.&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig and Friar Sand then ran to the village shouting, &#8220;Come and see the living Bodhisattva Guanyin, come and see the living Bodhisattva Guanyin.&#8221; All the villagers, young and old, men and women, rushed to the edge of the river and fell to their knees and kowtowed in worship despite the mud and the water. Among them was a good painter who left to posterity the painting of the Bodhisattva Guanyin appearing with a fish-basket. The Bodhisattva then returned to the Southern Sea.</P>
<P>Pig and Friar Sand cleared a way through the water straight to the River Turtle's Residence, where they searched for their master. All the water monsters and fish spirits there were now dead and rotten. They went round to the back of the palace, opened the stone chest, carried the Tang Priest up out of the water, and showed him to the crowds.</P>
<P>The Chen brothers kowtowed and expressed their thanks, saying, &#8220;My lord, if only you had accepted our advice and stayed longer you would have been spared all this trouble.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Say no more about it,&#8221; replied Monkey. &#8220;From next year onwards you people here won't need to make any more sacrifices. The Great King has been removed, and will never do you any harm again. Old Mr. Chen, I'd now like to trouble you to find a boat as soon as you can to take us across the river.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, I can, I can,&#8221; said Chen Qing, ordering people to saw wood into planks to build a boat.</P>
<P>When his retainers heard this they were all delighted to make offerings, and there were many cries of &#8220;I'll pay for the mast and the sail,&#8221; &#8220;I'll fix the oars,&#8221; &#8220;I'll provide the rigging,&#8221; and &#8220;I'll hire the boatmen.&#8221;</P>
<P>Amid all the noisy yelling on the bank a great shout came from the river, &#8220;Great Sage Sun, don't waste other people's money building a boat. I shall carry you all, master and disciples, across the river.&#8221; When the crowd heard this they were all terrified. The more timid among them slipped home, while the bolder stayed to watch, shivering and shaking. A moment later a monster emerged from the water. This is what it was like:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A divine square-headed and extraordinary beast,</P>
<P>The miraculous creature, the immortal of the waters.</P>
<P>Wagging his tail he can live for many an age,</P>
<P>Hiding still and silent in the depths of the rivers.</P>
<P>Leaping through the waves he rushes to the bank,</P>
<P>Or lies beside the sea facing sun and wind.</P>
<P>He has mastered the true Way of nourishing his essence,</P>
<P>The Ancient Soft-shelled Turtle with his carapace of white.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; called the Ancient Soft-shelled Turtle, &#8220;don't have a boat built. I'll take you four across.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll get you, you evil beast,&#8221; said Monkey, swinging his iron cudgel. &#8220;Come to the bank and I'll kill you with this.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am grateful to you, Great Sage, and have offered in good faith to carry you master and you disciples across the river, so why do you want to kill me?&#8221; the monster asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;What good turn have I ever done you?&#8221; Brother Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; said the Soft-shelled Turtle, &#8220;you may not realize that the River Turtle's Residence at the bottom of the river is my home, which was handed down to me by many generations of ancestors. Because I acquired awareness of the fundamental and developed a divine spirit by cultivating my conduct I had my ancestral home rebuilt as the River Turtle's Residence. Nine years ago, on a day when the sea was roaring and the waves were crashing, that evil monster came here on the tide and used his power to make a vicious attack on me. He killed many of my children and captured many of my clan. As I was no match for him I had to let him take my home for nothing. Now that you have come to rescue the Tang Priest, Great Sage, and have asked the Bodhisattva Guanyin here to sweep away evil and capture the monster my house has been returned to me and my family reunited. We can now live in our old home instead of having to make mud shelters. That is why my gratitude to you is as great as a mountain and as deep as the sea. And it is not only my family that is grateful. The whole village will now be spared from the annual sacrifice, and the sons and daughters of many a family will be spared. You have indeed brought double benefits with a single action, and that kindness is one that I have to repay.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey's heart was warmed to hear this, so he put his cudgel away and asked, &#8220;Is all that really true?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How could I possibly lie to the Great Sage who has done me so very great a kindness?&#8221; the Ancient Soft-shelled Turtle asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;If it's the truth you must swear an oath to Heaven,&#8221; Monkey said, whereupon the Ancient Soft-shelled Turtle opened his red mouth and swore to Heaven, &#8220;If I do not faithfully carry the Tang Priest across the River of Heaven may my whole body be turned to blood.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Come ashore, come ashore,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile. Only then did the Ancient soft-shelled Turtle approach the shore, give a jump, and climb up the bank. When they all went close they saw that he had a huge white shell about forty feet around.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;let's climb on his back and cross over.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But, disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;we could not get across that ice even though it was frozen so thick. I'm afraid that we would be even less safe on a turtle's back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do not be afraid, Master,&#8221; said the Ancient Soft-shelled Turtle. &#8220;I'm much safer than those thick layers of ice. I'll only fail in my spiritual endeavors if I roll to the side.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;no creature that can speak human language will tell a lie.&#8221; He then told Pig and Friar Sand to lead the horse forward.</P>
<P>When they reached the banks everyone in the village came to see them off with deep bows. Monkey led the animal on to the turtle's white shell and asked the Tang Priest to stand to the horse's right, Pig to its left, and Friar Sand behind it while he stood in front. Just in case the Soft-shelled Turtle tried to misbehave, Monkey undid his belt of tiger sinew, threaded it through the turtle's nose, and held it like a halter. Then with one foot on the turtle's shell and one on its head, and with his iron cudgel in one hand and the halter in the other, he shouted, &#8220;Take it easy, Ancient Soft-shelled Turtle. One roll from you and I'll hit you on the head.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'd never dare, I'd never dare,&#8221; the turtle said, and he started to walk across the water on his four feet as if going across dry land. All the people on the bank burnt incense, kowtowed, and recited, &#8220;Namo Amitabha Buddha.&#8221; This had indeed been a case of a true arhat coming down to the mortal world, and the appearance of a living Bodhisattva. Everyone bowed, watched them until they could be seen no more, and then went home.</P>
<P>In less than a day the master rode the White Soft-shelled Turtle across the 250 miles of the River of Heaven and landed on the other side with hands and feet still dry. When he had climbed ashore Sanzang put his hands together in thanks, and said, &#8220;Ancient Soft-shelled Turtle, I have put you to a great effort but I have nothing I can give you. I shall have to express my gratitude when I come back with the scriptures.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There is on need for any presents, venerable sir,&#8221; said the turtle. &#8220;I hear that the Lord Buddha in the Western Heaven has gone beyond death and life and knows everything in the past and the future. I have been cultivating my conduct here for over 1,300 years, and although I have prolonged my life and learned human speech I cannot escape from my shell. I beg you, venerable sir, to ask the Lord Buddha on my behalf when I will be rid of this shell and able to take human form.</P>
<P>&#8220;I shall ask, I shall ask,&#8221; Sanzang promised, at which the Ancient Soft-shelled Turtle plunged back into the water and Monkey helped Sanzang to mount the horse. With Pig shouldering the luggage and Friar Sand walking alongside, master and disciples took the main trail West. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The emperor sent the priest on his journey to visit the Buddha;</P>
<P>Great were the hardships and long was the road over river and hill.</P>
<P>Firm was his will and sincere was his heart: for him death held no terror.</P>
<P>The River of Heaven he crossed standing high on the old turtle's shell,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know how much further they had to go, or what other terrible trials faced them, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>三藏有灾沉水宅</p>
<p>观音救难现鱼篮</p>
</div>
<p>却说孙大圣与八戒、沙僧辞陈老来至河边，道：“兄弟，你两个议定，那一个先下水。”八戒道：“哥啊，我两个手段不见怎的，还得你先下水。”行者道：“不瞒贤弟说，若是山里妖精，全不用你们费力，水中之事，我去不得。就是下海行江，我须要捻着避水诀，或者变化甚么鱼蟹之形才去得。若是那般捻诀，却轮不得铁棒，使不得神通，打不得妖怪。我久知你两个乃惯水之人，所以要你两个下去。”沙僧道：“哥啊，小弟虽是去得，但不知水底如何。我等大家都去，哥哥变作甚么模样，或是我驮着你，分开水道，寻着妖圣的巢穴，你先进去打听打听。若是师父不曾伤损，还在那里，我们好努力征讨。假若不是这怪弄法，或者渰杀师父，或者被妖吃了，我等不须苦求，早早的别寻道路何如？”行者道：“贤弟说得有理，你们那个驮我？”八戒暗喜道：“这猴子不知捉弄了我多少，今番原来不会水，等老猪驮他，也捉弄他捉弄！”呆子笑嘻嘻的叫道：“哥哥，我驮你。”行者就知有意，却便将计就计道：“是，也好，你比悟净还有些膂力。”八戒就背着他。沙僧剖开水路，弟兄们同入通天河内。向水底下行有百十里远近，那呆子要捉弄行者，行者随即拔下一根毫毛，变做假身，伏在八戒背上，真身变作一个猪虱子，紧紧的贴在他耳朵里。八戒正行，忽然打个躘踵，得故子把行者往前一掼，扑的跌了一跤。原来那个假身本是毫毛变的，却就飘起去，无影无形。沙僧道：“二哥，你是怎么说？不好生走路，就跌在泥里，便也罢了，却把大哥不知跌在那里去了！”八戒道：</p>

<p>“那猴子不禁跌，一跌就跌化了。兄弟，莫管他死活，我和你且去寻师父去。”沙僧道：“不好，还得他来，他虽水性不知，他比我们乖巧。若无他来，我不与你去。”行者在八戒耳朵里，忍不住高叫道：“悟净！老孙在这里也。”沙僧听得，笑道：“罢了！这呆子是死了！你怎么就敢捉弄他！如今弄得闻声不见面，却怎是好？”八戒慌得跪在泥里磕头道：“哥哥，是我不是了，待救了师父上岸陪礼。你在那里做声？就影杀我也！你请现原身出来，我驮着你，再不敢冲撞你了。”行者道：“是你还驮着我哩。</p>

<p>我不弄你，你快走！快走！”那呆子絮絮叨叨，只管念诵着陪礼，爬起来与沙僧又进。</p>

<p>行了又有百十里远近，忽抬头望见一座楼台，上有“水鼋之第”四个大字。沙僧道：“这厢想是妖精住处，我两个不知虚实，怎么上门索战？”行者道：“悟净，那门里外可有水么？”沙僧道：“无水。”行者道：“既无水，你再藏隐在左右，待老孙去打听打听。”好大圣，爬离了八戒耳朵里，却又摇身一变，变作个长脚虾婆，两三跳跳到门里。睁眼看时，只见那怪坐在上面，众水族摆列两边，有个斑衣鳜婆坐于侧手，都商议要吃唐僧。行者留心，两边寻找不见，忽看见一个大肚虾婆走将来，径往西廊下立定。行者跳到面前称呼道：“姆姆，大王与众商议要吃唐僧，唐僧却在那里？”虾婆道：“唐僧被大王降雪结冰，昨日拿在宫后石匣中间，只等明日他徒弟们不来吵闹，就奏乐享用也。”</p>

<p>行者闻言，演了一会，径直寻到宫后，看果有一个石匣，却象人家槽房里的猪槽，又似人间一口石棺材之样，量量足有六尺长短；却伏在上面，听了一会，只听得三藏在里面嘤嘤的哭哩。行者不言语，侧耳再听，那师父挫得牙响，哏了一声道：“自恨江流命有愆，生时多少水灾缠。出娘胎腹淘波浪，拜佛西天堕渺渊。前遇黑河身有难，今逢冰解命归泉。不知徒弟能来否，可得真经返故园？”行者忍不住叫道：“师父莫恨水灾，经云，土乃五行之母，水乃五行之源。无土不生，无水不长。老孙来了！”</p>

<p>三藏闻得道：“徒弟啊，救我耶！”行者道：“你且放心，待我们擒住妖精，管教你脱难。”三藏道：“快些儿下手！再停一日，足足闷杀我也！”行者道：“没事没事！我去也！”急回头，跳将出去，到门外现了原身叫：“八戒！”那呆子与沙僧近道：“哥哥，如何？”行者道：“正是此怪骗了师父。师父未曾伤损，被怪物盖在石匣之下。你两个快早挑战，让老孙先出水面。你若擒得他就擒；擒不得，做个佯输，引他出水，等我打他。”沙僧道：“哥哥放心先去，待小弟们鉴貌辨色。”这行者捻着避水法，钻出波中，停立岸边等候不题。</p>

<p>你看那猪八戒行凶，闯至门前，厉声高叫：“泼怪物！送我师父出来！”慌得那门里小妖急报：“大王，门外有人要师父哩！”妖邪道：“这定是那泼和尚来了。”教：“快取披挂兵器来！”</p>

<p>众小妖连忙取出。妖邪结束了，执兵器在手，即命开门，走将出来。八戒与沙僧对列左右，见妖邪怎生披挂。好怪物！你看他：</p>

<p>头戴金盔晃且辉，身披金甲掣虹霓。腰围宝带团珠翠，足踏烟黄靴样奇。鼻准高隆如峤耸，天庭广阔若龙仪。眼光闪灼圆还暴，牙齿钢锋尖又齐。短发蓬松飘火焰，长须潇洒挺金锥。口咬一枝青嫩藻，手拿九瓣赤铜锤。一声咿哑门开处，响似三春惊蛰雷。这等形容人世少，敢称灵显大王威。(奇*书*网^.^整*理*提*供)</p>

<p>妖邪出得门来，随后有百十个小妖，一个个轮枪舞剑，摆开两哨，对八戒道：“你是那寺里和尚，为甚到此喧嚷？”八戒喝道：“我把你这打不死的泼物！你前夜与我顶嘴，今日如何推不知来问我？我本是东土大唐圣僧之徒弟，往西天拜佛求经者。</p>

<p>你弄玄虚，假做甚么灵感大王，专在陈家庄要吃童男童女，我本是陈清家一秤金，你不认得我么？”那妖邪道：“你这和尚，甚没道理！你变做一秤金，该一个冒名顶替之罪。我倒不曾吃你，反被你伤了我手背，已此让了你，你怎么又寻上我的门来？”八戒道：“你既让我，却怎么又弄冷风，下大雪，冻结坚冰，害我师父？快早送我师父出来，万事皆休！牙迸半个不字，你只看看手中钯，决不饶你！”妖邪闻言，微微冷笑道：“这和尚卖此长舌，胡夸大口。果然是我作冷下雪冻河，摄你师父。你今嚷上门来，思量取讨，只怕这一番不比那一番了。那时节，我因赴会，不曾带得兵器，误中你伤。你如今且休要走，我与你交敌三合，三合敌得我过，还你师父；敌不过，连你一发吃了。”八戒道：“好乖儿子！正是这等说！仔细看钯！”妖邪道：“你原来是半路上出家的和尚。”八戒道：“我的儿，你真个有些灵感，怎么就晓得我是半路出家的？”妖邪道：“你会使钯，想是雇在那里种园，把他钉钯拐将来也。”八戒道：“儿子，我这钯不是那筑地之钯，你看巨齿铸就如龙爪，逊金妆来似蟒形。若逢对敌寒风洒，但遇相持火焰生。能与圣僧除怪物，西方路上捉妖精。轮动烟云遮日月，使开霞彩照分明。筑倒太山千虎怕，掀翻大海万龙惊。饶你威灵有手段，一筑须教九窟窿！”</p>

<p>那个妖邪那里肯信，举铜锤劈头就打，八戒使钉钯架住道：“你这泼物，原来也是半路上成精的邪魔！”那怪道：“你怎么认得我是半路上成精的？”八戒道：“你会使铜锤，想是雇在那个银匠家扯炉，被你得了手，偷将出来的。”妖邪道：“这不是打银之锤，你看，九瓣攒成花骨朵，一竿虚孔万年青。原来不比凡间物，出处还从仙苑名。绿房紫菂瑶池老，素质清香碧沼生。</p>

<p>因我用功抟炼过，坚如钢锐彻通灵。枪刀剑戟浑难赛，钺斧戈矛莫敢经。纵让你钯能利刃，汤着吾锤迸折钉！”</p>

<p>沙和尚见他两个攀话，忍不住近前高叫道：“那怪物休得浪言！古人云，口说无凭，做出便见。不要走！且吃我一杖！”</p>

<p>妖邪使锤杆架住道：“你也是半路里出家的和尚。”沙僧道：“你怎么认得？”妖邪道：“你这个模样，象一个磨博士出身。”沙僧道：“如何认得我象个磨博士？”妖邪道：“你不是磨博士，怎么会使赶面杖？”沙僧骂道：“你这孽障，是也不曾见！这般兵器人间少，故此难知宝杖名。出自月宫无影处，梭罗仙木琢磨成。外边嵌宝霞光耀，内里钻金瑞气凝。先日也曾陪御宴，今朝秉正保唐僧。西方路上无知识，上界宫中有大名。唤做降妖真宝杖，管教一下碎天灵！”那妖邪不容分说，三家变脸，这一场，在水底下好杀：铜锤宝杖与钉钯，悟能悟净战妖邪。一个是天蓬临世界，一个是上将降天涯。他两个夹攻水怪施威武，这一个独抵神僧势可夸。有分有缘成大道，相生相克秉恒沙。土克水，水干见底；水生木，木旺开花。禅法参修归一体，还丹炮炼伏三家。土是母，发金芽，金生神水产婴娃；水为本，润木华，木有辉煌烈火霞。攒簇五行皆别异，故然变脸各争差。看他那铜锤九瓣光明好，宝杖千丝彩绣佳。钯按阴阳分九曜，不明解数乱如麻。捐躯弃命因僧难，舍死忘生为释迦。致使铜锤忙不坠，左遮宝杖右遮钯。三人在水底下斗经两个时辰，不分胜败。猪八戒料道不得赢他，对沙僧丢了个眼色，二人诈败佯输，各拖兵器，回头就走。那怪物教：“小的们，扎住在此，等我赶上这厮，捉将来与汝等凑吃哑！”你看他如风吹败叶，似雨打残花，将他两个赶出水面。</p>

<p>那孙大圣在东岸上，眼不转睛，只望着河边水势，忽然见波浪翻腾，喊声号吼，八戒先跳上岸道：“来了！来了！”沙僧也到岸边道：“来了！来了！”那妖邪随后叫：“那里走！”才出头，被行者喝道：“看棍！”那妖邪闪身躲过，使铜锤急架相还。一个在河边涌浪，一个在岸上施威。搭上手未经三合，那妖遮架不住，打个花，又淬于水里，遂此风平浪息。行者回转高崖道：“兄弟们，辛苦啊。”沙僧道：“哥啊，这妖精，他在岸上觉到不济，在水底也尽利害哩！我与二哥左右齐攻，只战得个两平，却怎么处置救师父也？”行者道：“不必疑迟，恐被他伤了师父。”八戒道：</p>

<p>“哥哥，我这一去哄他出来，你莫做声，但只在半空中等候，估着他钻出头来，却使个捣蒜打，照他顶门上着着实实一下！纵然打不死他，好道也护疼发晕，却等老猪赶上一钯，管教他了帐！”行者道：“正是！正是！这叫做‘里迎外合’，方可济事。”他两个复入水中不题。</p>

<p>却说那妖邪败阵逃生，回归本宅，众妖接到宫中，鳜婆上前问道：“大王赶那两个和尚到那方来？”妖邪道：“那和尚原来还有一个帮手。他两个跳上岸去，那帮手轮一条铁棒打我，我闪过与他相持。也不知他那棍子有多少斤重，我的铜锤莫想架得他住，战未三合，我却败回来也。”鳜婆道：“大王，可记得那帮手是甚相貌？”妖邪道：“是一个毛脸雷公嘴，查耳朵，折鼻梁，火眼金睛和尚。”鳜婆闻说，打了一个寒噤道：“大王啊！亏了你识俊，逃了性命！若再三合，决然不得全生！那和尚我认得他。”妖邪道：“你认得他是谁？”鳜婆道：“我当年在东洋海内，曾闻得老龙王说他的名誉，乃是五百年前大闹天宫、混元一气上方太乙金仙美猴王齐天大圣，如今归依佛教，保唐僧往西天取经，改名唤做孙悟空行者。他的神通广大，变化多端，大王，你怎么惹他！今后再莫与他战了。”</p>

<p>说不了，只见门里小妖来报：“大王，那两个和尚又来门前索战哩！”妖精道：“贤妹所见甚长，再不出去，看他怎么。”急传令，教：“小的们，把门关紧了，正是任君门外叫，只是不开门。</p>

<p>让他缠两日，性摊了回去时，我们却不自在受用唐僧也？”那小妖一齐都搬石头，塞泥块，把门闭杀。八戒与沙僧连叫不出，呆子心焦，就使钉钯筑门。那门已此紧闭牢关，莫想能彀；被他七八钯，筑破门扇，里面却都是泥土石块，高迭千层。沙僧见了道：“二哥，这怪物惧怕之甚，闭门不出，我和你且回上河崖，再与大哥计较去来。”八戒依言，径转东岸。</p>

<p>那行者半云半雾，提着铁棒等哩。看见他两个上来，不见妖怪，即按云头迎至岸边，问道：“兄弟，那话儿怎么不上来？”</p>

<p>沙僧道：“那怪物紧闭宅门，再不出来见面，被二哥打破门扇看时，那里面都使些泥土石块实实的迭住了。故此不能得战，却来与哥哥计议，再怎么设法去救师父。”行者道：“似这般却也无法可治。你两个只在河岸上巡视着，不可放他往别处走了，待我去来。”八戒道：“哥哥，你往那里去？”行者道：“我上普陀岩拜问菩萨，看这妖怪是那里出身，姓甚名谁。寻着他的祖居，拿了他的家属，捉了他的四邻，却来此擒怪救师。”八戒笑道：</p>

<p>“哥啊，这等干，只是忒费事，担搁了时辰了。”行者道：“管你不费事，不担搁！我去就来！”</p>

<p>好大圣，急纵祥光，躲离河口，径赴南海。那里消半个时辰，早望见落伽山不远，低下云头，径至普陀崖上。只见那二十四路诸天与守山大神、木叉行者、善财童子、捧珠龙女，一齐上前，迎着施礼道：“大圣何来？”行者道：“有事要见菩萨。”众神道：“菩萨今早出洞，不许人随，自入竹林里观玩。知大圣今日必来，吩咐我等在此候接大圣，不可就见。请在翠岩前聊坐片时，待菩萨出来，自有道理。”行者依言，还未坐下，又见那善财童子上前施礼道：“孙大圣，前蒙盛意，幸菩萨不弃收留，早晚不离左右，专侍莲台之下，甚得善慈。行者知是红孩儿，笑道：</p>

<p>“你那时节魔业迷心，今朝得成正果，才知老孙是好人也。”</p>

<p>行者久等不见，心焦道：“列位与我传报传报，但迟了，恐伤吾师之命。”诸天道：“不敢报，菩萨吩咐，只等他自出来哩。”</p>

<p>行者性急，那里等得，急纵身往里便走。噫！这个美猴王，性急能鹊薄。诸天留不住，要往里边皐。拽步入深林，睁眼偷觑着。</p>

<p>远观救苦尊，盘坐衬残箬。懒散怕梳妆，容颜多绰约。散挽一窝丝，未曾戴缨络。不挂素蓝袍，贴身小袄缚。漫腰束锦裙，赤了一双脚。披肩绣带无，精光两臂膊。玉手执钢刀，正把竹皮削。行者见了，忍不住厉声高叫道：“菩萨，弟子孙悟空志心朝礼。”菩萨教：“外面俟候。”行者叩头道：“菩萨，我师父有难，特来拜问通天河妖怪根源。”菩萨道：“你且出去，待我出来。”行者不敢强，只得走出竹林，对众诸天道：“菩萨今日又重置家事哩，怎么不坐莲台，不妆饰，不喜欢，在林里削篾做甚？”诸天道：“我等却不知。今早出洞，未曾妆束，就入林中去了，又教我等在此接候大圣，必然为大圣有事。”行者没奈何，只得等候。</p>

<p>不多时，只见菩萨手提一个紫竹篮儿出林道：“悟空，我与你救唐僧去来。”行者慌忙跪下道：“弟子不敢催促，且请菩萨着衣登座。”菩萨道：“不消着衣，就此去也。”那菩萨撇下诸天，纵祥云腾空而去，孙大圣只得相随。顷刻间，到了通天河界，八戒与沙僧看见道：“师兄性急，不知在南海怎么乱嚷乱叫，把一个未梳妆的菩萨逼将来也。”说不了，到于河岸。二人下拜道：</p>

<p>“菩萨，我等擅干，有罪！有罪！”菩萨即解下一根束袄的丝绦，将篮儿拴定，提着丝绦，半踏云彩，抛在河中，往上溜头扯着，口念颂子道：“死的去，活的住，死的去，活的住！”念了七遍，提起篮儿，但见那篮里亮灼灼一尾金鱼，还斩眼动鳞。菩萨叫：</p>

<p>“悟空，快下水救你师父耶。”行者道：“未曾拿住妖邪，如何救得师父？”菩萨道：“这篮儿里不是？”八戒与沙僧拜问道：“这鱼儿怎生有那等手段。菩萨道：“他本是我莲花池里养大的金鱼，每日浮头听经，修成手段。那一柄九瓣铜锤，乃是一枝未开的菡萏，被他运炼成兵。不知是那一日，海潮泛涨，走到此间。我今早扶栏看花，却不见这厮出拜，掐指巡纹，算着他在此成精，害你师父，故此未及梳妆，运神功，织个竹篮儿擒他。”行者道：</p>

<p>“菩萨，既然如此，且待片时，我等叫陈家庄众信人等，看看菩萨的金面：一则留恩，二来说此收怪之事，好教凡人信心供养。”菩萨道：“也罢，你快去叫来。”那八戒与沙僧，一齐飞跑至庄前，高呼道：“都来看活观音菩萨！都来看活观音菩萨！”一庄老幼男女，都向河边，也不顾泥水，都跪在里面，磕头礼拜。内中有善图画者，传下影神，这才是鱼篮观音现身。当时菩萨就归南海。</p>

<p>八戒与沙僧，分开水道，径往那水鼋之第找寻师父。原来那里边水怪鱼精，尽皆死烂。却入后宫，揭开石匣，驮着唐僧，出离波津，与众相见。那陈清兄弟叩头称谢道：“老爷不依小人劝留，致令如此受苦。”行者道：“不消说了。你们这里人家，下年再不用祭赛，那大王已此除根，永无伤害。陈老儿，如今才好累你，快寻一只船儿，送我们过河去也。”那陈清道：“有！有！</p>

<p>有！”就教解板打船，众庄客闻得此言，无不喜舍。那个道我买桅篷，这个道我办篙桨，有的说我出绳索，有的说我雇水手。正都在河边上吵闹，忽听得河中间高叫：“孙大圣不要打船，花费人家财物，我送你师徒们过去。”众人听说，个个心惊，胆小的走了回家，胆大的战兢兢贪看。须臾那水里钻出一个怪来，你道怎生模样：方头神物非凡品，九助灵机号水仙。曳尾能延千纪寿，潜身静隐百川渊。翻波跳浪冲江岸，向日朝风卧海边。养气含灵真有道，多年粉盖癞头鼋。那老鼋又叫：“大圣，不要打船，我送你师徒过去。”行者轮着铁棒道：“我把你这个孽畜！若到边前，这一棒就打死你！”老鼋道：“我感大圣之恩，情愿办好心送你师徒，你怎么反要打我？”行者道：“与你有甚恩惠？”老鼋道：“大圣，你不知这底下水鼋之第，乃是我的住宅，自历代以来，祖上传留到我。我因省悟本根，养成灵气，在此处修行，被我将祖居翻盖了一遍，立做一个水鼋之第。那妖邪乃九年前海啸波翻，他赶潮头，来于此处，仗逞凶顽，与我争斗，被他伤了我许多儿女，夺了我许多眷族。我斗他不过，将巢穴白白的被他占了。今蒙大圣至此搭救唐师父，请了观音菩萨扫净妖氛，收去怪物，将第宅还归于我，我如今团圞老小，再不须挨土帮泥，得居旧舍。此恩重若丘山，深如大海。且不但我等蒙惠，只这一庄上人，免得年年祭赛，全了多少人家儿女，此诚所谓一举而两得之恩也！敢不报答？”行者闻言，心中暗喜，收了铁棒道：“你端的是真实之情么？”老鼋道：“因大圣恩德洪深，怎敢虚谬？”行者道：“既是真情，你朝天赌咒。”那老鼋张着红口，朝天发誓道：“我若真情不送唐僧过此通天河，将身化为血水！”行者笑道：“你上来，你上来。”老鼋却才负近岸边，将身一纵，爬上河崖。众人近前观看，有四丈围圆的一个大白盖。行者道：“师父，我们上他身，渡过去也。”三藏道：“徒弟呀，那层冰厚冻，尚且迍邅，况此鼋背，恐不稳便。”老鼋道：“师父放心，我比那层冰厚冻，稳得紧哩，但歪一歪，不成功果！”行者道：</p>

<p>“师父啊，凡诸众生，会说人话，决不打诳语。”教：“兄弟们，快牵马来。”</p>

<p>到了河边，陈家庄老幼男女，一齐来拜送。行者教把马牵在白鼋盖上，请唐僧站在马的颈项左边，沙僧站在右边，八戒站在马后，行者站在马前，又恐那鼋无礼，解下虎筋绦子，穿在老鼋的鼻之内，扯起来象一条缰绳，却使一只脚踏在盖上，一只脚登在头上，一只手执着铁棒，一只手扯着缰绳，叫道：“老鼋，慢慢走啊，歪一歪儿，就照头一下！”老鼋道：“不敢！不敢！”</p>

<p>他却蹬开四足，踏水面如行平地。众人都在岸上，焚香叩头，都念南无阿弥陀佛，这正是真罗汉临凡，活菩萨出现。众人只拜的望不见形影方回，不题。ｗωｗ奇Qisuu書com网</p>

<p>却说那师父驾着白鼋，那消一日，行过了八百里通天河界，干手干脚的登岸。三藏上崖，合手称谢道：“老鼋累你，无物可赠，待我取经回谢你罢。”老鼋道：“不劳师父赐谢。我闻得西天佛祖无灭无生，能知过去未来之事。我在此间，整修行了一千三百余年，虽然延寿身轻，会说人语，只是难脱本壳。万望老师父到西天与我问佛祖一声，看我几时得脱本壳，可得一个人身。”三藏响允道：“我问，我问。”那老鼋才淬水中去了。行者遂伏侍唐僧上马，八戒挑着行囊，沙僧跟随左右，师徒们找大路，一直奔西。这的是：圣僧奉旨拜弥陀，水远山遥灾难多。意志心诚不惧死，白鼋驮渡过天河。毕竟不知此后还有多少路程，还有甚么凶吉，且听下回分解。</p>
