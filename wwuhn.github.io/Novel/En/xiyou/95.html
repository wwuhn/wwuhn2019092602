<P>The Four Monks Dine to Music in the Palace Gardens</P>
<P>One Demon Loves in Vain and Longs for Bliss</P>
</div>
<P>The story tells how Brother Monkey and the other two disciples went with the official who had brought the invitation to outside the Meridional Gate of the palace, where the eunuch gate officer immediately reported their arrival and brought back a summons for them to enter. The three of them stood in a row, not bowing. &#8220;Are you three gentlemen the illustrious disciples of the holy monk? What are your names? Where do you live? Why did you become monks? What scriptures are you going to fetch?&#8221; Monkey then came closer, intending to enter the throne hall.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't move,&#8221; one of the king's bodyguards shouted. &#8220;If you have anything to say, say it standing down there.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We monks like to step forward whenever we're given an opening,&#8221; Monkey said with a smile, at which Pig and Friar Sand too approached the king. Worried that their rough manners would alarm the king, Sanzang stepped forward and called out, &#8220;Disciples, His Majesty has asked you why you have come here. You must submit your reply.&#8221;</P>
<P>Seeing his master standing in attendance beside the king, Monkey could not restrain himself from calling aloud, &#8220;Your Majesty is treating yourself with respect but others with contempt. If you are taking my master as your son-in-law, why do you make him stand in attendance on you? The normal custom is for a king to call his son-in-law Your Excellency, and an Excellency really ought to be sitting down.&#8221;</P>
<P>This gave the king so bad a fright that he turned pale and wished he could leave the throne hall. But as this would have looked very bad he had to summon up his courage and tell his attendants of fetch an embroidered stool on which he invited the Tang Priest to sit. Only then did Brother Monkey submit the following spoken memorial: &#8220;My ancestral home is the Water Curtain Cave in the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit in the land of Aolai in the Eastern Continent of Superior Body.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>My father was heaven, my mother earth,</P>
<P>And I was born when a rock split open.</P>
<P>1 took as my master a Taoist adept,</P>
<P>And mastered the Great Way.</P>
<P>Then I returned to my land of immortals,</P>
<P>Where I gathered all of us to live in our cave heaven.</P>
<P>In the ocean's depths I subdued the dragons,</P>
<P>Then climbed the mountains to capture wild beasts.</P>
<P>I removed us from the registers of death,</P>
<P>Put us on the rolls of the living,</P>
<P>And was appointed Great Sage Equaling Heaven.</P>
<P>I enjoyed the heavenly palaces,</P>
<P>And roamed around the splendid buildings.</P>
<P>I met the immortals of Heaven</P>
<P>In daily carousals;</P>
<P>Lived in the holy regions,</P>
<P>Happy every day.</P>
<P>But because I disrupted the Peach Banquet,</P>
<P>And raised a rebellion in the palaces of Heaven,</P>
<P>I was captured by the Lord Buddha</P>
<P>And imprisoned under the Five Elements Mountain.</P>
<P>When hungry I was fed on pellets of iron,</P>
<P>When thirsty I drank molten copper:</P>
<P>For five hundred years I tasted no food or tea.</P>
<P>Fortunately my master came from the East</P>
<P>To worship in the West.</P>
<P>Guanyin told him to deliver me from heavenly disaster.</P>
<P>I was rescued from my torment</P>
<P>To be converted to the Yogacarin sect.</P>
<P>My old name was Wukong;</P>
<P>Now I am known as the Novice.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the king realized how important Monkey was he quickly came down from his dragon throne and walked over to steady the venerable elder with his hand and say, &#8220;Son-in-law, it was divine providence that brought us one such as yourself to be our kinsman through marriage.&#8221; Sanzang thanked the king profoundly for his graciousness and urged him to return to his throne. &#8220;Which gentleman has the distinction of being the second disciple?&#8221; the king asked. Pig thrust his snout out to make himself look more impressive as he replied:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;In previous lives old Pig used to be</P>
<P>Given to pleasure and indolence.</P>
<P>I lived in confusion,</P>
<P>My nature disordered and my heart deluded.</P>
<P>1 did not know how high the sky was or how deep the earth;</P>
<P>I could not tell the ocean's width or the mountains' distance.</P>
<P>Then in the middle of my idleness</P>
<P>I suddenly met a true immortal.</P>
<P>In half a sentence</P>
<P>He undid the net of evil;</P>
<P>With two or three remarks</P>
<P>He smashed the gate to disaster.</P>
<P>Then I became aware,</P>
<P>Took him as my master on the spot,</P>
<P>Diligently studied the arts of the Double Eight,</P>
<P>Respectfully refined the Triple Three's sequence.</P>
<P>When training was complete I was able to fly,</P>
<P>And ascend to the heavenly palace.</P>
<P>The Jade Emperor in his benevolence</P>
<P>Appointed me as Marshal Tian Peng,</P>
<P>To command the marines of the River of Heaven,</P>
<P>And wander at ease within the palace gates.</P>
<P>Then when I was drunk at the Peach Banquet</P>
<P>I misbehaved with the goddess of the moon,</P>
<P>Was stripped of my commission,</P>
<P>And exiled to the mortal world.</P>
<P>Because I came into the wrong womb</P>
<P>1 was born with the likeness of a pig.</P>
<P>Living at the Mount of Blessing</P>
<P>I committed unbounded evil.</P>
<P>When I met the Bodhisattva Guanyin</P>
<P>She showed me the way of goodness.</P>
<P>I came over to the Buddhist faith</P>
<P>To escort the Tang Priest</P>
<P>On his journey to the Western Heaven,</P>
<P>Seeking the marvellous scriptures.</P>
<P>My Dharma name is Wuneng,</P>
<P>And people call me Bajie.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the king heard this he trembled with fear, not daring to look at him. This made the idiot more spirited than ever, shaking his head, pursing his lips, thrusting his ears up and roaring with laughter.</P>
<P>Sanzang, worried that Pig was giving the king a fright, shouted, &#8220;Control yourself, Bajie.&#8221; Only then did Pig put his hands together and pretend to behave himself.</P>
<P>&#8220;And why was the third distinguished disciple converted?&#8221; the king then asked. Putting his hands together, Friar Sand said:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;I was originally a mortal man,</P>
<P>Who turned to the Way out of fear of the Wheel of Reincarnation.</P>
<P>1 wandered like a cloud to the corners of the seas.</P>
<P>Roamed to the very ends of the sky.</P>
<P>I always wore the robe and held the begging-bowl,</P>
<P>And ever concentrated my mind within the body.</P>
<P>Because of my sincerity</P>
<P>I fell in with immortals,</P>
<P>Raised the Baby Boy,</P>
<P>To mate him with the Lovely Girl.</P>
<P>When the Three Thousand Tasks were achieved</P>
<P>All was combined in the Four Images.</P>
<P>I rose above the boundary of the sky,</P>
<P>Bowed to the dark vault of heaven,</P>
<P>And was appointed Curtain-lifting General.</P>
<P>1 was in attendance on the Phoenix and Dragon Carriage,</P>
<P>And General was my rank.</P>
<P>Because at the Peach Banquet</P>
<P>1 accidentally smashed a crystal bowl</P>
<P>1 was exiled to the Flowing Sands River,</P>
<P>My face was altered,</P>
<P>And I became an evil killer.</P>
<P>Fortunately the Bodhisattva traveled to the East</P>
<P>To persuade me to turn to the faith</P>
<P>And await the Buddha's son from Tang.</P>
<P>Who would go to seek scriptures in the Western Heaven.</P>
<P>I became his follower and made a fresh start,</P>
<P>Refining once more my great awareness.</P>
<P>I took my surname Sand from the river;</P>
<P>My Buddhist name is Wujing,</P>
<P>And my title Friar.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The king was both most alarmed and most delighted to hear this. Delighted because his daughter had found herself a living Buddha, and alarmed by three veritable evil gods. Just as the king was being torn between alarm and delight the chief astrologer submitted this memorial: &#8220;The wedding has been set for the twelfth day of this month, the day of water-rat, a lucky time at which all will be auspicious for nuptials.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What day is it today?&#8221; the king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Today is the eighth, the day of earth-monkey,&#8221; the astrologer replied, &#8220;the day on which gibbons offer fruit, and the right day on which to advance worthies and accept their suggestions.&#8221; This greatly pleased the king, who sent his officials in attendance to have the halls and pavilions in the royal garden swept clear. Here he invited his future son-in-law with his three distinguished disciples to stay while they waited for the nuptial feast at which the princess would marry him. The underlings all carried out their instructions, the king ended the audience and the officials withdrew.</P>
<P>The story now tells how when Sanzang and his disciples reached the imperial garden night was falling. A vegetarian meal was laid on. &#8220;We really deserve a meal today,&#8221; said Pig with delight. The people in charge brought in plain rice and pasta by the carrying-pole load. Pig kept eating a bowlful then taking a refill over and over again. He only stopped eating when his stomach was completely full. A little later the lamps were lit and the bedding laid out, after which everyone went to bed. As soon as the venerable elder saw that there was nobody around he started to shout angrily at Monkey, berating him.</P>
<P>&#8220;You macaque, Wukong! You keep ruining me. I said we were just going to present the passport and told you not to go near the decorated tower. Why did you keep demanding to take me there to have a look? Well, did you have a good enough look? Whatever are we to do about this trouble you have got us into?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; replied Monkey, putting on a smile, &#8220;it was you who said, 'My late mother married after throwing an embroidered ball to make the match she was destined for.' I only took you there because you seemed to want to enjoy something of the past. Besides, because I remembered what the ancient monk in the Almsgiver's Spread Gold Monastery said I came here to find out whether she's an impostor or not. When I saw the king just now there was something a bit sinister about the way he looked, but I haven't yet seen what the princess is like.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What will happen when you see the princess?&#8221; the venerable elder asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;My fiery eyes with their golden pupils can tell whether someone's true or false, good or evil, rich or poor,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;I'll know what to do and be able to sort out right and wrong.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So you've learned physiognomy in the last few days, elder brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand and Pig with a smile.</P>
<P>&#8220;Physiognomists are just my grandson,&#8221; Brother Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop joking,&#8221; shouted Sanzang. &#8220;He definitely wants me now. What are we to do about it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;At that happy occasion on the twelfth the princess is bound to come out to pay her respects to her parents,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'll take a look at her from where I'll stand by the side. If she really is a woman you can be her consort and enjoy the kingdom's glory and splendor.&#8221; This made Sanzang angrier than ever.</P>
<P>&#8220;You're a fine ape,&#8221; he said abusively, &#8220;still trying to ruin me. As Wuneng said, we have already done ninety-seven or ninety-eight hundredths of the journey. You're trying to destroy me with your crafty tongue again. Shut up! Don't open that stinking mouth of yours any more. Next time there's any misbehavior from you I shall start reciting that spell again, and that will be more than you can take.&#8221;</P>
<P>The mention of the spell being recited had Monkey falling straight to his knees before Sanzang and pleading, &#8220;Don't say it, don't say it! If she's really a woman we'll all raise a rumpus in the palace during the wedding ceremony and get you out.&#8221; While master and disciples were talking they had not noticed that it was now night. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Slow dripped the clepsydras;</P>
<P>Heavy hung the fragrance of the flowers.</P>
<P>Pearl curtains hung over splendid doorways;</P>
<P>No fire or light was seen in the still courtyard.</P>
<P>Empty was the shadow of the deserted swing;</P>
<P>All was silence when the flute's notes died away.</P>
<P>The room was surrounded by flowers and bright in the moonbeams,</P>
<P>Lit by those spiky stars not blocked by any trees.</P>
<P>The cuckoo rested from her song;</P>
<P>Long was the butterfly's dream.</P>
<P>The River Way spanned the celestial vault</P>
<P>While white clouds made their way home.</P>
<P>Just when they were closest in feeling</P>
<P>The willows swaying in the wind were more dispiriting than ever.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's late, Master,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;Let's carry on arguing tomorrow morning. Go to sleep now, go to sleep!&#8221; Master and disciples did then get a night's sleep.</P>
<P>The golden cockerel was soon greeting the dawn, and the king entered the throne hall for his audience. This is what could be seen:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A purple aura rising high above the opened palace</P>
<P>As the winds carried royal music to the azure sky.</P>
<P>While clouds drifted, the leopard-tail banners moved;</P>
<P>The sun shone upon the demon figures on the roof, and the jade pendants tinkled.</P>
<P>A scented mist delicately touched the palace's green willows,</P>
<P>While dewdrops lightly moistened the garden flowers.</P>
<P>A thousand officials in ranks shouted and danced in homage:</P>
<P>Seas and rivers were at peace and the state was unified.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When all the civil and military officials had paid their homage to him, the king proclaimed, &#8220;The Department of Foreign Relations will arrange a nuptial banquet for the twelfth. Today the spring wine shall be prepared, and our future son-in-law shall be entertained in the royal gardens.&#8221; The Protocol Office were told to lead the three worthy future royal in-laws to sit in the state hostel while the Department of Foreign Relations laid on a vegetarian banquet for the three of them. The two departments arranged for the musicians of the court orchestra to play and look after them while they passed the days enjoying the beauty of spring.</P>
<P>As soon as Pig heard this he said, &#8220;Your Majesty, we always stay with our master: we never leave him for a moment. As he's going to be drinking and feasting in the palace gardens we'd better go along for a couple of days' fun too if our master's to be your son-in-law. Otherwise the deal's off.&#8221; Seeing how ugly and coarse-spoken Pig was, twisting his head and neck, thrusting his snout out and waving his ears&#8212;which all made him seem rather intimidating&#8212;the king was so worried that Pig might ruin the wedding that he had to accede to the request.</P>
<P>&#8220;Prepare a banquet for two in the Sino-Barbarian Hall of Eternal Pacification for our son-in-law and ourself. Prepare a meal for the other three gentlemen in the Pavilion of Lingering Spring. We are afraid that it might be inconvenient for master and disciples to sit together.&#8221; Only then did the idiot chant his respects to the king and thank him. Everyone then withdrew, after which the king ordered the officials of the inner palace to prepare a banquet, and told the queens and consorts of the three palaces and six compounds to give the princess hair ornaments, cakes and other things for the wedding on the twelfth.</P>
<P>It was now about ten in the morning, and the king had a carriage ready in which to take the Tang Priest and the others to go to see the palace gardens. The gardens were a fine place:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The paths, inlaid with coloured stones,</P>
<P>Have carved and chiseled balustrades.</P>
<P>Beside the paths inlaid with coloured stones</P>
<P>Strange flowers spread over the rocks;</P>
<P>Outside the carved and chiseled balustrades,</P>
<P>And within them too, flower blossoms rare.</P>
<P>Early peach trees are a bewitching turquoise,</P>
<P>And golden orioles dart among the willows.</P>
<P>The walker finds the fragrance fill his sleeve,</P>
<P>And many pure scents imbue his clothing.</P>
<P>Phoenix terrace and dragon pool,</P>
<P>Bamboo lodge and pine pavilion.</P>
<P>On the phoenix terrace</P>
<P>Pipes are played to lure the phoenix to appear;</P>
<P>In the dragon pools</P>
<P>Fish are reared to become dragons and leave.</P>
<P>In the bamboo lodge are poems</P>
<P>Whose well-chosen words match the &#8220;White Snow Melody&#8221;</P>
<P>The books in the pine pavilion</P>
<P>Are pearls and jade in blue-covered volumes.</P>
<P>Rocks and jade twist around the artificial hills;</P>
<P>Deep are the blue-green waters of the winding stream.</P>
<P>Peony pavilions,</P>
<P>Rose bowers,</P>
<P>Make a natural brocade.</P>
<P>Trellises of jasmine,</P>
<P>Beds of begonia,</P>
<P>Are like sunset clouds or jeweled mosaics.</P>
<P>Herbaceous peonies are marvelously fragrant;</P>
<P>Rare is the beauty of the mallows from Sichuan.</P>
<P>White pear and red apricot blossom vie in scent;</P>
<P>Purple orchid and golden daylily compete in splendor.</P>
<P>Corn poppy,</P>
<P>Lily magnolia buds,</P>
<P>Azalea flowers,</P>
<P>Are brilliantly coloured.</P>
<P>Magnolia flowers,</P>
<P>Garden balsam,</P>
<P>Plantain lilies,</P>
<P>Tremble.</P>
<P>Everywhere red shines through the richness of cosmetics</P>
<P>While heavy scents drift from a brocade surrounding screen.</P>
<P>The warmth returning with the East wind is greeted with joy;</P>
<P>All the garden's beauties display their brilliance.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The king and his companions walked around enjoying the flowers for a long time. Soon the officials of the Protocol Office came to invite Monkey and the other two to the Pavilion of Lingering Spring while the king led the Tang Priest by the hand to the Sino-Barbarian Hall so that they could all drink and feast. These were splendid occasions with singing, dancing and instrumental music. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The sun shone from the majestic palace gates;</P>
<P>Good auras filled the royal buildings.</P>
<P>The spring spread out an embroidery of flowers,</P>
<P>And heaven's light shone from afar on the court robes.</P>
<P>Pipes and singers wafted their music as if in a banquet of immortals;</P>
<P>The goblets flew, carrying jade liquor.</P>
<P>Master and subjects enjoyed the same pleasure</P>
<P>As Sino-barbarian peace brought prosperity.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Seeing with what great respect he was being treated by the king, the venerable elder had nothing for it but to force himself to join in the celebrations. In fact he gave only a show of happiness: inside he was miserable. As he sat there he saw four golden screens hanging on the wall, screens painted with scenes of the four seasons. Each picture had a poem on it by a famous academician. The poem on the spring scene read:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The vital forces of heaven turn creation around;</P>
<P>The world is happy and everything is renewed.</P>
<P>The peach and the plum blossoms vie in splendor;</P>
<P>Swallows fly to the painted rafters, shaking the incense dust.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The poem on the summer scene read:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In warm and sultry air all thoughts are slow</P>
<P>The palace mallow and pomegranate reflect the sun's brilliance.</P>
<P>The jade flute's music disturbs the noonday dream;</P>
<P>The scent of caltrops is wafted through the curtains.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The poem on the autumn scene read:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>One leaf on the parasol tree by the well is yellow;</P>
<P>The pearl curtain is not rolled up on the night of frost.</P>
<P>After the autumn sacrifice the swallows abandon their nest;</P>
<P>When the rush flowers snap, the wild geese leave for another land.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The poem on the winter scene read:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The clouds fly over the rainy sky, all dark and cold;</P>
<P>The North wind blows the snow into thousands of bills.</P>
<P>Deep in the palace the stove glows warm;</P>
<P>They say the plum has blossomed by the jade balustrade.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the king noticed the absorption with which the Tang Priest was gazing at the poems he said, &#8220;As you enjoy savoring the poems so much you must be a fine poet yourself, son-in-law. If you do not begrudge your pearls we would like to invite you to make up a matching poem for each of them, ending three of the lines with the same word. Will you agree?&#8221;</P>
<P>The venerable elder was the sort of person who could be so carried away by a scene that he forgot the circumstances, someone who had an enlightened mind and thoroughly comprehended his own nature, so when the king pressed him so earnestly to match the verses he found himself saying the line, &#8220;The sun's warmth melts the ice the world around.&#8221;</P>
<P>This greatly pleased the king, who told the officials in attendance on him, &#8220;Fetch the four treasures of the study, so that our son-in-law can write down the matching verses he composes for us to savor at our leisure.&#8221; The venerable elder was glad to comply. Picking up a brush, he produced matching lines. The matching poem on the spring scene read:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The sun's warmth melts the ice the world around;</P>
<P>Within the palace garden, flowers are renewed.</P>
<P>Gentle winds and rain enrich the people;</P>
<P>Rivers and seas are calm; gone is all worldly dust.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The matching poem on the summer scene read:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Dipper now points South; the day goes slow;</P>
<P>Locust and pomegranate trees contend in brilliance.</P>
<P>Golden oriole and purple swallow sing in the willows,</P>
<P>Their melodious voices drifting through red curtains.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The matching poem on the autumn read:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Fragrant the green mandarin; the orange turns to yellow.</P>
<P>Blue pine and cypress welcome frost's coming.</P>
<P>Half-open chrysanthemums make a tapestry on the trellis;</P>
<P>Pipes and songs waft through the watery, cloud-covered land.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The matching poem on the winter scene read:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As skies clear after welcome snow the air is cold;</P>
<P>Grotesque-shaped crags and boulders mark jade hills.</P>
<P>As charcoal burns in the stove to warm the yogurt</P>
<P>Singing with hands in their sleeves they lean on jade balustrades.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The king was utterly delighted by the matching verses. &#8220;'Singing with hands in their sleeves they lean on jade balustrades' is really good,&#8221; he said with admiration, and ordered the royal orchestra to set the new poems to music. The banquet did not break up until the day was over.</P>
<P>Brother Monkey and the other two were also having a splendid meal in the Pavilion of Lingering Spring. Each of them was feeling rather merry after downing a few cups, and they decided to go to see their master, who was in another building with the king. This made Pig start acting like the idiot he was.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is great,&#8221; he yelled at once. &#8220;We're doing very nicely here. Today we've had a right good time. But now we're full we ought to go to sleep it off.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You really are ill-bred, brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand with a grin. &#8220;How could you possibly go to sleep when you're as full as that?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You wouldn't know,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;There's a saying that goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Unless you stretch out for a nap when you've dined</P>
<P>How can your belly with fat be well lined?&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the Tang Priest had taken his leave of the king he went back to the pavilion and scolded pig: &#8220;Cretin! You acted coarser than ever. What sort of place do you think this is, to shout and yell like that? If you had made the king angry he would have had you killed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;don't worry. We're being treated as his in-laws, so it would be very awkward for him to get angry with us. As the proverb goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you're related a beating can't rend it;</P>
<P>If you are neighbors a cursing won't end it.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We were only joking. He's nothing to be frightened of.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this the venerable elder shouted, &#8220;Bring the idiot here. Give him twenty strokes of the dhyana staff.&#8221; Monkey then grabbed Pig and knocked him over, while Sanzang raised the cudgel to beat him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master, Royal Son-in-law,&#8221; the idiot shouted, &#8220;Spare me! Spare me!&#8221;</P>
<P>One of the officials who was present at the banquet persuaded Sanzang not to hit Pig, who clambered back on his feet, grumbling, &#8220;You're a fine excellency; you're a fine royal son-in-law. Applying the royal law before you're even married!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop that nonsense,&#8221; said Monkey, making a face at him, &#8220;stop that nonsense! Go to bed at once.&#8221; They then spent another night in the Lingering Spring Pavilion. The next morning they feasted as before.</P>
<P>Before long they had been enjoying themselves for three or four days, by when it was that splendid day, the twelfth. The officials of the three sections of the Department of Foreign Relations all submitted a memorial that said, &#8220;Since we received the edicts on the eighth the palace for the Royal Son-in-law has been built, and all that we are waiting for is for the trousseau to be installed. The nuptial banquet has been prepared, with meat and vegetarian food for over five hundred guests.&#8221;</P>
<P>This greatly pleased the king, who was just going to invite his future son-in-law to come to the banquet when a eunuch from the inner quarters of the palace reported to him, &#8220;Your Majesty, Her Majesty the Queen asks you to come.&#8221; The king then withdrew to the inner quarters of the palace, where the queens of the three palaces and the consorts of the six compounds brought the princess to the Sunlight Palace to talk and joke together. The place was truly a mass of flowers or brocade. The magnificence and beauty was more than a match for the halls of heaven or the moon's pavilions; nor was it inferior to the jade palaces of immortals.</P>
<P>There are four new lyrics on the &#8220;Happy Gathering and Splendid Wedding&#8221; about it. The lyric &#8220;Happy&#8221; goes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Happy! Happy!</P>
<P>Delight and bliss!</P>
<P>The wedding is celebrated</P>
<P>With its love and beauty.</P>
<P>Elegant court dresses</P>
<P>That the Lady of the Moon could never rival;</P>
<P>Dragon and phoenix hairpins,</P>
<P>Sumptuous threads of flying gold.</P>
<P>Cherry lips, white teeth and rouge-red cheeks</P>
<P>Sylphs with forms as delicate as flowers.</P>
<P>Brocades upon brocades,</P>
<P>An extravagance of color,</P>
<P>Full of fragrance,</P>
<P>A host of princesses.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The lyric &#8220;Gathering&#8221; goes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Gathering! Gathering!</P>
<P>Bewitching charms,</P>
<P>Rivaling the great beauties of the past,</P>
<P>Enough to topple a city or a state,</P>
<P>Like flowers or jade.</P>
<P>Dressed to make them lovelier still,</P>
<P>Even more dazzling in their finery,</P>
<P>And the splendor of their jewels.</P>
<P>Their orchid hearts and natures were pure and lofty;</P>
<P>Noble were their powder-white faces and ice-smooth skin.</P>
<P>The lines of their painted eyebrows were like distant hills;</P>
<P>They formed a throng of willowy elegance.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The lyric &#8220;Splendid&#8221; goes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Splendid! Splendid!</P>
<P>Jade girls, fairy maidens,</P>
<P>Utterly adorable,</P>
<P>Truly to be admired,</P>
<P>Perfumed with fine fragrances,</P>
<P>Adorned with cosmetics.</P>
<P>Although far from the Tiantai paradise,</P>
<P>This was no mere palace of a king.</P>
<P>Sweet were their smiling words</P>
<P>As the sound of pipes and songs was wafted around.</P>
<P>A thousand beauties, massed flowers, a splendid brocade:</P>
<P>How could its match be found in the world?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The lyric &#8220;Wedding&#8221; goes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Wedding! Wedding!</P>
<P>Orchid Fragrance,</P>
<P>Ranks of fairy girls,</P>
<P>Crowds of beauties.</P>
<P>The royal concubines have put on new splendor;</P>
<P>The princesses are in fresh garments.</P>
<P>Piled clouds of raven hair,</P>
<P>Rainbow gowns over phoenix skirts.</P>
<P>Soft music of immortals,</P>
<P>Two rows of purple and red.</P>
<P>In the past they pledged to ride in one phoenix chariot;</P>
<P>This morning is the happy occasion and the splendid wedding.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the king arrived his queens and consorts led the princess and the other palace ladies out to meet him. The delighted king took them into the Sunlight Palace to sit down. When the queens, consorts and others had made their obeisances the king said, &#8220;Princess, my good daughter, we think that your heart's desire was fulfilled when you had the good fortune to find the holy monk by throwing your ball from the decorated tower on the eighth. The officials of all the departments have been most understanding of our wishes, so that everything is now ready. As today is a lucky one let us hurry to the nuptial banquet and not be late.&#8221;</P>
<P>The princess stepped forward, went down in a kowtow, and submitted this petition: &#8220;Your Majesty my father, I beg you to forgive your daughter for her effrontery, but I have a request to make. In the last few days it has been reported in the inner quarters of the palace that the Tang Priest has three extremely hideous disciples. I couldn't bring myself to see them: I'm afraid the sight would terrify me. So I beg you, Father, to send them out of the city. Otherwise the shock might be too much for my trail health and lead to disaster.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you had not mentioned them, child,&#8221; the king replied, &#8220;we would have very nearly forgotten about them. They are indeed rather ugly, and for the last few days we have had them entertained in the Lingering Spring Pavilion. When we go into the throne hall this morning we will return their passport and tell them to leave the city so that we can hold our banquet.&#8221; The princess then kowtowed again in thanks, after which the king left in his carriage to enter the throne hall and issue a decree inviting his son-in-law and the other three gentlemen to attend.</P>
<P>Now the Tang Priest had been following the dates by counting on his fingers, so when he reached the twelfth he had a discussion with his three disciples before dawn. &#8220;It is the twelfth today,&#8221; he said. &#8220;How are we to cope?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've already noticed something of an ill-omened air about the king,&#8221; Brother Monkey replied, &#8220;but the evil hasn't actually infected him or done any great harm. The only thing is that I've not yet had a look at the princess. If she comes out and lets me take a peep at her I'll know whether she's an impostor or not, then I'll do something. Don't worry. He's bound to summon us now and send us three away from the city. Accept the invitation and don't be afraid. I'll slip back and stay close to you to protect you.&#8221; As master and disciples were talking a royal equerry did indeed come with officials from the protocol office to bring an invitation.</P>
<P>&#8220;Let's go,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;let's go. I'm sure they're going to see us three on our way and keep you here, Master, for the wedding.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If they're seeing us off they're bound to give us hundreds and thousands of ounces of gold and silver,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;We'll be able to buy some presents to take home with us. When I get back to my in-laws' place I'll be able to have a bit of fun again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Shut up, second brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;and stop talking such nonsense. We'll do what big brother says.&#8221;</P>
<P>They then followed the officials to the foot of the throne hall steps, taking baggage and horse with them. When the king had greeted them he commanded Monkey and the other two to come forward. &#8220;Hand your passport up,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and we shall seal it, sign it and return it to you. You three gentlemen will be generously provided with funds for your journey and escorted on your way to see the Buddha on Vulture Peak. If you come back with the scriptures you will also receive generous rewards. We shall keep our son-in-law here: there will be no need for you to worry about him.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey thanked the king, then told Friar Sand to take the passport out and hand it over. The king read it, sealed and signed it, then brought out ten ingots of gold and twenty of silver that he wanted to present to them as gifts for his in-laws. Pig, who always had been very keen on money and sex, stepped forward to accept them.</P>
<P>Monkey then gave a respectful chant and said, &#8220;We've disturbed you.&#8221;</P>
<P>As Monkey turned to go Sanzang hastily scrambled to his feet, grabbed hold of him, and said through clenched teeth, &#8220;You are all abandoning me.&#8221;</P>
<P>Brother Monkey pinched the palm of Sanzang's hand, gave him a meaningful look and said, &#8220;Unwind and take your pleasure here while we go to fetch the scriptures. We'll call on you on our way back.&#8221; Not knowing whether to believe this or not, the venerable elder refused to let him go. When all the officials saw this they took it for a real parting. Soon the king invited his son-in-law back into the throne hall, ordering the officials to escort the three gentlemen out of the city, whereupon Sanzang had to let go of Monkey and enter the hall.</P>
<P>As Brother Monkey and the other two went out through the palace gates they each took their leave.</P>
<P>&#8220;Are we really going?&#8221; asked Pig. Monkey said nothing, and just walked back to the hostel, where the superintendent received them and provided tea and a meal.</P>
<P>&#8220;You two stay here,&#8221; Monkey said to Pig and Friar Sand, &#8220;and whatever you do, don't show your faces. If the hostel superintendent asks what's happening, give him vague answers. Don't say anything. I'm going off to look after the master.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage pulled out one of his hairs, blew on it with magic breath, called &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned it into his own double to stay in the hostel with Pig and Friar Sand, while he himself leapt up into mid air in a flash, turning himself into a bee.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Yellow wings, sweet mouth and a sharp tail,</P>
<P>He dances wildly in the wind,</P>
<P>The brilliant thief of fragrance from the blossom</P>
<P>Who sways his way through willows and flowers.</P>
<P>With many a drenching for his troubles</P>
<P>He flies to and fro, but all in vain.</P>
<P>The thick delight be makes he never tastes;</P>
<P>All he can do is leave his fame behind.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Watch him as he flies lightly into the palace, where he saw the Tang Priest sitting on an embroidered stool at the king's left, frowning and worried at heart. Flying up to his master's Vairocana mitre, Monkey crept stealthily to his ear and said, &#8220;I'm here, Master, so don't fret.&#8221; These words were heard by the Tang Priest alone,&#8212;none of the ordinary mortals had any hope of hearing them&#8212;so he felt relief at last.</P>
<P>Before long a eunuch came with an invitation: &#8220;Your Majesty, the nuptial banquet is set out in the Jay Palace. Her Majesty and the princess are awaiting you in the inner quarters. They invite Your Majesty and His Excellency to go in for the wedding.&#8221; Overwhelmed with happiness, the king went into the inner quarters with his son-in-law. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The wicked king's love of flowers led to disaster;</P>
<P>When the dhyana mind starts thinking, each thought brings sorrow.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know how the Tang Priest escaped once in the inner quarters of the palace, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>四僧宴乐御花园</p>
<p>一怪空怀情欲喜</p>
</div>
<p>话表孙行者三人，随着宣召官至午门外，黄门官即时传奏宣进。他三个齐齐站定，更不下拜，国王问道：“那三位是圣僧驸马之高徒？姓甚名谁？何方居住？因甚事出家？取何经卷？”</p>

<p>行者即近前，意欲上殿，旁有护驾的喝道：“不要走！有甚话，立下奏来。”行者笑道：“我们出家人，得一步就进一步。”随后八戒沙僧亦俱近前。长老恐他村鲁惊驾，便起身叫道：“徒弟啊，陛下问你来因，你即奏上。”行者见他那师父在旁侍立，忍不住大叫一声道：“陛下轻人重己！既招我师为驸马，如何教他侍立？世间称女夫谓之贵人，岂有贵人不坐之理！”国王听说，大惊失色，欲退殿，恐失了观瞻，只得硬着胆，教近侍的取绣墩来，请唐僧坐了。行者才奏道：“老孙祖居东胜神洲傲来国花果山水帘洞。父天母地，石裂吾生。曾拜至人，学成大道。复转仙乡，啸聚在洞天福地。下海降龙，登山擒兽。消死名，上生籍，官拜齐天大圣。玩赏琼楼，喜游宝阁。会天仙，日日歌欢；居圣境，朝朝快乐。只因乱却蟠桃宴，大反天宫，被佛擒伏。困压在五行山下，饥餐铁弹，渴饮铜汁，五百年未尝茶饭。幸我师出东土，拜西方，观音教令脱天灾，离大难，皈正在瑜伽门下。旧讳悟空，称名行者。”国王闻得这般名重，慌得下了龙床，走将来，以御手挽定长老道：“驸马，也是朕之天缘，得遇你这仙姻仙眷。”三藏满口谢恩，请国王登位。复问：“那位是第二高徒？”八戒掬嘴扬威道：“老猪先世为人，贪欢爱懒。一生混沌，乱性迷心。未识天高地厚，难明海阔山遥。正在幽闲之际，忽然遇一真人。半句话，解开业网；两三言，劈破灾门。当时省悟，立地投师，谨修二八之工夫，敬炼三三之前后。行满飞升，得超天府。荷蒙玉帝厚恩，官赐天蓬元帅，管押河兵，逍遥汉阙。只因蟠桃酒醉，戏弄嫦娥，谪官衔，遭贬临凡；错投胎，托生猪象。住福陵山，造恶无边。遇观音，指明善道。皈依佛教，保护唐僧。</p>

<p>径往西天，拜求妙典。法讳悟能，称为八戒。”国王听言，胆战心惊，不敢观觑。这呆子越弄精神，摇着头，掬着嘴，撑起耳朵呵呵大笑。三藏又怕惊驾，即叱道：“八戒收敛！”方才叉手拱立，假扭斯文。又问：“第三位高徒，因甚皈依？”沙和尚合掌道：“老沙原系凡夫，因怕轮回访道。云游海角，浪荡天涯。常得衣钵随身，每炼心神在舍。因此虔诚，得逢仙侣。养就孩儿，配缘姹女。工满三千，合和四相。超天界，拜玄穹，官授卷帘大将，侍御凤辇龙车，封号将军。也为蟠桃会上，失手打破玻璃盏，贬在流沙河，改头换面，造孽伤生。幸喜菩萨远游东土，劝我皈依，等候唐朝佛子，往西天求经果正。从立自新，复修大觉，指河为姓。法讳悟净，称名沙僧。”国王见说，多惊多喜，喜的是女儿招了活佛，惊的是三个实乃妖神。正在惊喜之间，忽有正台阴阳官奏道：“婚期已定本年本月十二日。壬子辰良，周堂通利，宜配婚姻。”国王道：“今日是何日辰？”阴阳官奏：“今日初八，乃戊申之日，猿猴献果，正宜进贤纳事。”国王大喜，即着当驾官打扫御花园馆阁楼亭，且请驸马同三位高徒安歇，待后安排合卺佳筵，着公主匹配。众等钦遵，国王退朝，多官皆散不题。</p>

<p>却说三藏师徒们都到御花园，天色渐晚，摆了素膳。八戒喜道：“这一日也该吃饭了。”管办人即将素米饭、面饭等物，整担挑来。那八戒吃了又添，添了又吃，直吃得撑肠拄腹，方才住手。少顷，又点上灯，设铺盖，各自归寝。长老见左右无人，却恨责行者，怒声叫道：“悟空！你这猢狲，番番害我！我说只去倒换关文，莫向彩楼前去，你怎么直要引我去看看？如今看得好么！却惹出这般事来，怎生是好？”行者陪笑道：“师父说，先母也是抛打绣球，遇旧缘，成其夫妇。似有慕古之意，老孙才引你去，又想着那个给孤布金寺长老之言，就此检视真假。适见那国王之面，略有些晦暗之色，但只未见公主何如耳。”长老道：“你见公主便怎的？”行者道：“老孙的火眼金睛，但见面，就认得真假善恶，富贵贫穷，却好施为，辨明邪正。”沙僧与八戒笑道：“哥哥近日又学得会相面了。”行者道：“相面之士，当我孙子罢了。”三藏喝道：“且休调嘴！只是他如今定要招我，果何以处之？”行者道：“且到十二日会喜之时，必定那公主出来参拜父母，等老孙在旁观看。若还是个真女人，你就做了驸马，享用国内之荣华也罢。”三藏闻言，越生嗔怒，骂道：“好猢狲！你还害我哩！却是悟能说的，我们十节儿已上了九节七八分了，你还把热舌头铎我？快早夹着，你休开那臭口！再若无礼，我就念起咒来，教你了当不得！”行者听说念咒，慌得跪在面前道：“莫念莫念！若是真女人，待拜堂时，我们一齐大闹皇宫，领你去也。”师徒说话，不觉早已入更。正是：沉沉宫漏，荫荫花香。绣户垂珠箔，闲庭绝火光。秋千索冷空留影，羌笛声残静四方。绕屋有花笼月灿，隔空无树显星芒。杜鹃啼歇，蝴蝶梦长。银汉横天宇，白云归故乡。正是离人情切处，风摇嫩柳更凄凉。八戒道：“师父，夜深了，有事明早再议，且睡！且睡！”师徒们果然安歇。</p>

<p>一宵夜景已题，早又金鸡唱晓。五更三点，国王即登殿设朝，但见：宫殿开轩紫气高，风吹御乐透青霄。云移豹尾旌旗动，日射螭头玉佩摇。香雾细添宫柳绿，露珠微润苑花娇。山呼舞蹈千官列，海晏河清一统朝。众文武百官朝罢，又宣光禄寺安排十二日会喜佳筵，今日且整春罍，请驸马在御花园中款玩。吩咐仪制司领三位贤亲去会同馆少坐，着光禄寺安排三席素宴去彼奉陪。两处俱着教坊司奏乐，伏侍赏春景消迟日也。</p>

<p>八戒闻得，应声道：“陛下，我师徒自相会，更无一刻相离。今日既在御花园饮宴，带我们去耍两日，好教师父替你家做驸马；</p>

<p>不然，这个买卖生意弄不成。”那国王见他丑陋，说话粗俗，又见他扭头捏颈，掬嘴巴，摇耳朵，即象有些风气，犹恐搅破亲事，只得依从，便教：“在永镇华夷阁里安排二席，我与驸马同坐。留春亭上安排三席，请三位别坐，恐他师徒们坐次不便。”</p>

<p>那呆子才朝上唱个喏，叫声多谢，各各而退。又传旨教内宫官排宴，着三宫六院后妃与公主上头，就为添妆餪子，以待十二日佳配。</p>

<p>将有巳时前后，那国王排驾，请唐僧都到御花园内观看。</p>

<p>好去处：径铺彩石，槛凿雕栏。径铺彩石，径边石畔长奇葩；槛凿雕栏，槛外栏中生异卉。夭桃迷翡翠，嫩柳闪黄鹂。步觉幽香来袖满，行沾清味上衣多。凤台龙沼，竹阁松轩。凤台之上，吹箫引凤来仪；龙沼之间，养鱼化龙而去。竹阁有诗，费尽推敲裁白雪；松轩文集，考成珠玉注青编。假山拳石翠，曲水碧波深。牡丹亭，蔷薇架，迭锦铺绒；茉藜槛，海棠畦，堆霞砌玉。芍药异香，蜀葵奇艳。白梨红杏斗芳菲，紫蕙金萱争烂熳。丽春花、木笔花、杜鹃花，夭夭灼灼；含笑花、凤仙花、玉簪花，战战巍巍。一处处红透胭脂润，一丛丛芳浓锦绣围。更喜东风回暖日，满园娇媚逞光辉。</p>

<p>一行君王几位，观之良久。早有仪制司官邀请行者三人入留春亭，国王携唐僧上华夷阁，各自饮宴。那歌舞吹弹，铺张陈设，真是：峥嵘阊阖曙光生，凤阁龙楼瑞霭横。春色细铺花草绣，天光遥射锦袍明。笙歌缭绕如仙宴，杯斝飞传玉液清。君悦臣欢同玩赏，华夷永镇世康宁。此时长老见那国王敬重，无计可奈，只得勉强随喜，诚是外喜而内忧也。坐间见壁上挂着四面金屏，屏上画着春夏秋冬四景，皆有题咏，皆是翰林名士之诗：《春景诗》曰：“周天一气转洪钧，大地熙熙万象新。桃李争妍花烂熳，燕来画栋迭香尘。”《夏景诗》曰：“熏风拂拂思迟迟，宫院榴葵映日辉。玉笛音调惊午梦，芰荷香散到庭帏。”《秋景诗》曰：“金井梧桐一叶黄，珠帘不卷夜来霜。燕知社日辞巢去，雁折芦花过别乡。”《冬景诗》曰：“天雨飞云暗淡寒，朔风吹雪积千山。深宫自有红炉暖，报道梅开玉满栏。”</p>

<p>那国王见唐僧恣意看诗，便道：“驸马喜玩诗中之味，心定善于吟哦，如不吝珠玉，请依韵各和一首如何？”长老是个对景忘情、明心见性之意，见国王钦重，命和前韵，他不觉忽谈一句道：“日暖冰消大地钧。”国王大喜，即召侍卫官：“取文房四宝，请驸马和完录下，俟朕缓缓味之。”长老欣然不辞，举笔而和。</p>

<p>和《春景诗》曰：“日暖冰消大地钧，御园花卉又更新。和风膏雨民沾泽，海晏河清绝俗尘。”和《夏景诗》曰：“斗指南方白昼迟，槐云榴火斗光辉。黄鹂紫燕啼宫柳，巧转双声入绛帏。”和《秋景诗》曰：“香飘橘绿与橙黄，松柏青青喜降霜。篱菊半开攒锦绣，笙歌韵彻水云乡。”和《冬景诗》曰：“瑞雪初晴气味寒，奇峰巧石玉团山。炉烧兽炭煨酥酪，袖手高歌倚翠栏。”国王见和大喜，称唱道：“好个袖手高歌倚翠栏！”遂命教坊司以新诗奏乐，尽日而散。</p>

<p>行者三人在留春亭亦尽受用，各饮了几杯，也都有些酣意，正欲去寻长老，只见长老已同国王在一阁。八戒呆性发作，应声叫道：“好快活！好自在！今日也受用这一下了！却该趁饱儿睡觉去也！”沙僧笑道：“二哥忒没修养，这气饱饫，如何睡觉？”八戒道：“你那里知，俗语云吃了饭儿不挺尸，肚里没板脂哩！”唐僧与国王相别，只谨言，只谨言，既至亭内，嗔责他三人道：“这夯货，越发村了！这是甚么去处，只管大呼小叫！倘或恼着国王，却不被他伤害性命？”八戒道：“没事没事！我们与他亲家礼道的，他便不好生怪。常言道，打不断的亲，骂不断的邻。大家耍子，怕他怎的？”长老叱道，教：“拿过呆子来，打他二十禅杖！”行者果一把揪翻，长老举杖就打，呆子喊叫道：“驸马爷爷！饶罪饶罪！”旁有陪宴官劝住，呆子爬将起来，突突囔囔的道：“好贵人！好驸马！亲还未成，就行起王法来了！”行者侮着他嘴道：“莫胡说！莫胡说！快早睡去。”他们又在留春亭住了一宿。到明早，依旧宴乐。</p>

<p>不觉乐了三四日，正值十二日佳辰，有光禄寺三部各官回奏道：“臣等自八日奉旨，驸马府已修完，专等妆奁铺设。合卺宴亦已完备，荤素共五百余席。”国王心喜，正欲请驸马赴席，忽有内宫官对御前启奏道：“万岁，正宫娘娘有请。”国王遂退入内宫，只见那三宫皇后，六院嫔妃，引领着公主，都在昭阳宫谈笑。真个是花团锦簇！那一片富丽妖娆，真胜似天堂月殿，不亚于仙府瑶宫。有《喜会佳姻》新词四首为证。《喜词》云：喜！</p>

<p>喜！喜！欣然乐矣！结婚姻，恩爱美。巧样宫妆，嫦娥怎比。龙钗与凤镵，艳艳飞金缕。樱唇皓齿朱颜，嬝娜如花轻体。锦重重，五彩丛中；香拂佛，千金队里。《会词》云：会！会！会！妖娆娇媚。赛毛嫱，欺楚妹。倾国倾城，比花比玉。妆饰更鲜妍，钗环多艳丽。兰心蕙性清高，粉脸冰肌荣贵。黛眉一线远山微，窈窕嫣姌攒锦队。《佳词》云：佳！佳！佳！玉女仙娃。深可爱，实堪夸。异香馥郁，脂粉交加。天台福地远，怎似国王家。笑语纷然娇态，笙歌缭绕喧哗。花堆锦砌千般美，看遍人间怎若他。《姻词云》：姻！姻！姻！兰麝香喷。仙子阵，美人群。嫔妃换彩，公主妆新。云鬓堆鸦髻，霓裳压凤裙。一派仙音嘹喨，两行朱紫缤纷。当年曾结乘鸾信，今朝幸喜会佳姻。</p>

<p>却说国王驾到，那后妃引着公主，并彩女宫娥都来迎接。</p>

<p>国王喜孜孜，进了昭阳宫坐下。后妃等朝拜毕，国王道：“公主贤女，自初八日结彩抛球，幸遇圣僧，想是心愿已足。各衙门官，又能体朕心，各项事俱已完备。今日正是佳期，可早赴合卺之宴，不要错过时辰。”那公主走近前倒身下拜，奏道：“父王，乞赦小女万千之罪。有一言启奏：这几日闻得宫官传说，唐圣僧有三个徒弟，他生得十分丑恶，小女不敢见他，恐见时必生恐惧。万望父王将他发放出城方好，不然惊伤弱体，反为祸害也。”国王道：“孩儿不说，朕几乎忘了，果然生得有些丑恶，连日教他在御花园里留春亭管待。趁今日就上殿，打发他关文，教他出城，却好会宴。”公主叩头谢了恩，国王即出驾上殿，传旨：“请驸马共他三位。”原来那唐僧捏指头儿算日子，熬至十二日，天未明，就与他三人计较道：“今日却是十二了，这事如何区处？”行者道：“那国王我已识得他有些晦气，还未沾身，不为大害，但只不得公主见面，若得出来，老孙一觑，就知真假，方才动作，你只管放心。他如今一定来请，打发我等出城，你自应承莫怕。我闪闪身儿就来，紧紧随护你也。”师徒们正讲，果见当驾官同仪制司来请。行者笑道：“去来！去来”，必定是与我们送行，好留师父会合。”八戒道：“送行必定有千百两黄金白银，我们也好买些人事回去，到我那丈人家，也再会亲耍子儿去耶。”沙僧道：“二哥箝着口，休乱说，只凭大哥主张，”遂此将行李马匹，俱随那些官到于丹墀下。国王见了，教请行者三位近前道：“汝等将关文拿上来，朕当用宝花押交付汝等，外多备盘缠，送你三位早去灵山见佛，若取经回来，还有重谢。留驸马在此，勿得悬念。”行者称谢，遂教沙僧取出关文递上。国王看了，即用了印，押了花字，又取黄金十锭，白金二十锭，聊达亲礼。八戒原来财色心重，即去接了。行者朝上唱个喏道：“聒噪聒噪！”便转身要走，慌着个三藏一毂辘爬起，扯住行者，咬响牙根道：“你们都不顾我就去了！”行者把手捏着三藏手掌，丢个眼色道：“你在这里宽怀欢会，我等取了经，回来看你。”那长老似信不信的，不肯放手。多官都看见，以为实是相别而去。</p>

<p>早见国王又请驸马上殿，着多官送三位出城，长老只得放了手上殿。</p>

<p>行者三人，同众出了朝门，各自相别。八戒道：“我们当真的走哩？”行者不言语，只管走至驿中。驿丞接入，看茶摆饭。行者对八戒沙僧道：“你两个只在此，切莫出头。但驿丞问甚么事情，且含糊答应，莫与我说话，我保师父去也。”好大圣，拔一根毫毛，吹口仙气，叫“变！”即变作本身模样，与八戒沙僧同在驿内，真身却幌的跳在半空，变作一个蜜蜂儿，其实小巧。但见：</p>

<p>翅黄口甜尾利，随风飘舞颠狂。最能摘蕊与偷香，度柳穿花摇荡。辛苦几番淘染，飞来飞去空忙。酿成浓美自何尝，只好留存名状。你看他轻轻的飞入朝中。远见那唐僧在国王左边绣墩上坐着，愁眉不展，心存焦燥。径飞至他毗卢帽上，悄悄的爬及耳边，叫道：“师父，我来了，切莫忧虑。”这句话，只有唐僧听见，那伙凡人，莫想知觉。唐僧听见，始觉心宽。不一时，宫官来请道：“万岁，合卺嘉筵已排设在鳷鹊宫中，娘娘与公主，俱在宫伺候，专请万岁同贵人会亲也。”国王喜之不尽，即同驸马进宫而去。正是那：邪主爱花花作祸，禅心动念念生愁。毕竟不知唐僧在内宫怎生解脱，且听下回分解。</p>
