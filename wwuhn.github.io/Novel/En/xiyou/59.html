<P>Two Minds Throw Heaven and Earth into Uproar</P>
<P>One Body Cannot Achieve True Nirvana</P>
</div>
<P>When Monkey and Friar Sand took their leave of the Bodhisattva they departed from the Southern Ocean by two beams of auspicious light. Now Monkey's somersault cloud was much faster than Friar Sand's immortal's cloud, so Monkey was drawing ahead when Friar Sand pulled him back and said, &#8220;There's no need for you to show me your heels like that, brother, rushing ahead to sort things out at home. Wait for me to come with you.&#8221;</P>
<P>Although Brother Monkey's intentions were good Friar Sand could not help being suspicious. The two of them then flew their clouds together and were soon in sight of the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. They brought their clouds down and had a good look at the outside of the cave, where there was indeed a Monkey sitting on a high stone terrace, drinking and making merry with his monkey hosts. He looked exactly the same as the Great Sage: yellow hair held in a golden band, fiery eyes with golden pupils, a brocade tunic, a tigerskin kilt, a gold-banded iron cudgel in his hands, and deerskin boots. He had the same</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Hairy face like a thunder god,</P>
<P>Cheeks like the planet Saturn;</P>
<P>Pointed ears and a forehead broad,</P>
<P>And long, protruding fangs.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In an explosion of fury the Great Sage left Friar Sand behind as he went up to the other, brandishing his cudgel and shouting abusively, &#8220;What sort of demon do you think you are? How dare you! You make yourself look like me, you steal my children and grandchildren, you occupy my immortal's cave, and on top of that you live it up like this.&#8221; When the other Monkey heard all this he did not deign to reply but went for him with his own iron cudgel. When the two Monkeys were together there was no way of telling the true from the false. It was a splendid fight:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Two cudgels and a pair of monkey spirits,</P>
<P>A couple of truly formidable foes.</P>
<P>Both want to escort the Tang emperor's brother;</P>
<P>Each longs to achieve what will make him famous.</P>
<P>The true Monkey now accepts Sakyamuni's teachings;</P>
<P>The false demon only pretends to be a Buddhist.</P>
<P>In magic powers and transformations</P>
<P>The false and true are evenly balanced.</P>
<P>One is the Sage Equaling Heaven of primal energy,</P>
<P>The other an earth spirit who has long refined his powers.</P>
<P>One wields an As-You-Will gold-banded cudgel,</P>
<P>The other an iron bar that follows the heart's desire.</P>
<P>As they block and parry neither comes out on top.</P>
<P>First they fight each other outside the cave,</P>
<P>But soon they carry on the struggle in mid air.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Each of them rose on his clouds and light till they were fighting up in the clouds of the ninth heaven. As Friar Sand stood beside them he dared not intervene in their fight as he really could not tell the true Monkey from the false one. He longed to draw his sword and join in, but he was frightened of wounding the real Monkey. When he had endured this dilemma for a long time he shot back down to the mountain scar, where he used his demon-quelling staff to fight his way to the outside of the Water Curtain Cave. Here he sent all the demons fleeing in terror, turned the stone benches over, and smashed the tableware from which they had been eating and drinking to their hearts' content. But although he looked everywhere for the blue felt bundles he failed to find them. Now the Water Curtain Cave was so called because the waterfall screening its entrance looked from a distance like a white cloth curtain and only appeared as the waterfall it was from close to. As Friar Sand did not know that the entrance to the cave was behind it he was unable to find the way in, so he took his cloud back up to the Ninth Heaven and started swinging his staff again, still unable to strike.</P>
<P>&#8220;Friar Sand,&#8221; said the Great Sage, &#8220;you can't help much here. Go back and tell the master what's been happening to us while I drive this demon to Potaraka Island in the Southern Ocean for the Bodhisattva to identify me as the real Monkey.&#8221; The other Monkey then repeated what he had said. As they looked and sounded exactly the same Friar Sand really could not tell them apart. He could only do as he was told and ride his cloud back to rejoin the Tang Priest.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The two Monkeys meanwhile fought and shouted their way to the Southern Ocean, where they went straight to Potaraka Island still throwing blows and abuse at each other. Their unending shouts disturbed all the devas who protected the Law, so that they went to the Tide Cave and reported, &#8220;Bodhisattva, two Sun Wukongs really have fought their way here.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Bodhisattva came down from her lotus throne and went with Moksa, the page Sudhana and the Naga Maiden to the entrance, where she shouted, &#8220;Stay where you are, evil beast.&#8221;</P>
<P>Each Monkey grabbed hold of the other one while the real one said, &#8220;Bodhisattva, this damned fiend really does look just like me. Our fight started at the Water Curtain Cave and has been going on for a very long time without getting anywhere. Friar Sand's mortal eyes are too weak to tell us apart, so he can't help at all. I sent him back West to report to the master while I fought this bloody impostor here for you to distinguish the true from the false. Your eyes are perceptive, Bodhisattva.&#8221;</P>
<P>The other Monkey then said exactly the same. Look long and hard though they did, the devas and the Bodhisattva could not tell which was which. &#8220;Let go of each other and stand one on each side while I take another look,&#8221; the Bodhisattva said.</P>
<P>Doing as she told them, the one on her left said, &#8220;I'm the real Monkey,&#8221; and the one on her right said, &#8220;He's an impostor.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Bodhisattva then called Moksa and Sudhana to her and whispered these instructions: &#8220;I want one of you to stand very close to each of them while I recite the Band-tightening Spell quietly. The one in agony will be the real one, and the one who isn't will be the impostor.&#8221;</P>
<P>One of them went up to each of the Monkeys, but as the Bodhisattva secretly said the words of the spell they both yelled out in pain, clutched their heads, and rolled on the ground shouting, &#8220;Stop! Stop!&#8221; The moment she did they grabbed each other again and went on fighting and shouting. At her wit's end, the Bodhisattva ordered the devas and Moksa to help, but none of them dared strike a blow for fear of wounding the real Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Sun Wukong,&#8221; called the Bodhisattva, and both the Monkeys answered her. &#8220;As you were once appointed the Protector of the Horses,&#8221; said the Bodhisattva, &#8220;When you made havoc in the Heavenly Palace, all the heavenly generals recognize you. Go to the upper world: let it distinguish between you two. Come back and tell me the result.&#8221; The Great Sage thanked the Bodhisattva for her kindness and the other Monkey also thanked her.</P>
<P>Pulling and tugging at each other and keeping up their ceaseless clamour they went straight to the Southern Gate of Heaven, where the Heavenly King Virupaksa led the four heavenly generals Ma, Zhao, Wen and Guan and all the other gate gods great and small to block the entrance with their weapons.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;This is no place for a brawl.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Sanzang sent me away for killing some bandits while I was escorting him to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures,&#8221; the Great Sage replied. &#8220;I went to Potaraka to complain. To my horror this evil spirit turned himself into my double, knocked the Tang Priest over and stole the luggage. Friar Sand went to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit looking for me and found that this evil spirit had seized my cave. Then he went to Potaraka to tell the Bodhisattva and ask for her help. When he saw me there he made the outrageous accusation that I'd got there first by somersault cloud and told the Bodhisattva a pack of lies to cover up. Luckily she could vouch for me and didn't believe Friar Sand, so she sent us both back to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit to find out what had happened. As you can see, this evil spirit looks just like me. We fought our way from the Water Curtain Cave to Potaraka Island to see the Bodhisattva, but she couldn't tell us apart, so I've now fought him all the way here in the hope that all the eyes of all the heavens will be able to see that I'm the real Monkey.&#8221; Then the other Monkey told the same story. No matter how long they looked all the gods of the heavens could not tell them apart.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you can't tell which is which,&#8221; the two Monkey shouted, &#8220;get out of the way and let us go to see the Jade Emperor.&#8221;</P>
<P>As the gods could not stop them they opened the gates wide to let them go straight to the Hall of Miraculous Mist. Marshal Ma and the four Heavenly Teachers Zhang, Ge, Xu and Qiu all reported to the Jade Emperor, &#8220;Two identical Sun Wukongs from the mortal world have charged in through the gates of Heaven and say that they want to see Your Majesty.&#8221; Before they had finished the two Monkeys came roaring straight in, so alarming the Jade Emperor that he came down from his throne and stood in the palace hall. &#8220;Why are you two making such a row in the heavenly palace and shouting in our presence?&#8221; the Jade Emperor asked. &#8220;Do you want to die?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Long live Your Majesty,&#8221; said the Great Sage. &#8220;Now that I'm a devout Buddhist I'd never dare try to bully my betters. It's just that this evil spirit has turned himself into my double.&#8221; He then told the whole story, concluding, &#8220;and I beg that Your Majesty will unmask the impostor.&#8221; Then the other Monkey said the same thing all over again.</P>
<P>The Jade Emperor ordered Heavenly King Li the Pagoda-carrier to look at them both in his demon-revealing mirror, kill the false one and preserve the true one. The Heavenly King caught them both in his mirror and invited the Jade Emperor and the other deities all to look. Both Monkeys could be seen in it, wearing the same golden band and the same clothes. There was not the slightest difference between them. Unable to tell them apart, the Jade Emperor had both of them driven out of the palace.</P>
<P>The Great Sage gave a mocking laugh and so did the other Monkey. Then they grabbed each other by the hair and by the throat, fought their way out of the heavenly gates, and landed on the road to the West. &#8220;Let's go and see the master,&#8221; said one of them; and the other replied, &#8220;Let's go and see the master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After Friar Sand had taken his leave of the two Monkeys it took him three days and nights' travelling to return to the farm, where he told the Tang Priest everything that had happened. The Tang Priest was full of regrets: &#8220;I said that Sun Wukong had hit me and stolen the bundles, never realizing that an evil spirit had turned itself into an imitation Monkey.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The evil spirit made doubles of yourself, the white horse, Pig carrying our luggage, and me,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;I was so furious that I killed the fake Friar Sand: he was really a monkey spirit. That made them all run away, then I went to tell the Bodhisattva my troubles. She sent Monkey and me back to identify the demon, but he was so much like the real Monkey that I couldn't help in the fight, which is why I've come back to report to you, Master.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang paled with horror at this news, while Pig roared with laughter. &#8220;Great, great,&#8221; he guffawed. &#8220;Just as this kind old lady said, there are several lots of pilgrims going to fetch the scriptures. They're one lot, aren't they?&#8221;</P>
<P>Everyone in the house, young and old alike, came to ask Friar Sand, &#8220;Where have you been looking for money for your travelling expenses these last few days?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I went to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit in the Eastern Continent of Superior Body to look for my eldest brother and fetch the baggage,&#8221; Friar Sand replied with a smile. &#8220;Then I went to Potaraka Island in the Southern Ocean to see the Bodhisattva Guanyin and to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit again before coming back here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How long was your return journey?&#8221; the old man of the family asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;About 70,000 miles,&#8221; Friar Sand replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;That would be a very long way to walk in only a few days,&#8221; the old man said, &#8220;You must have gone by cloud to get there.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How else do you think he got across the sea?&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;What you and I do is like walking compared with Monkey: he'd have been there and back in a day or two,&#8221; said Friar Sand. When the family heard this they realized that they must all be gods or immortals.</P>
<P>&#8220;No, we're not,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;We're senior to them.&#8221;</P>
<P>As they were talking they were interrupted by a noisy quarrel in mid air, and when they rushed out to look they saw two Monkeys fighting. The sight made Pig's hands itch. &#8220;I'm going up to tell them apart,&#8221; he said, and with that the splendid idiot leapt up into the air and shouted, &#8220;Stop yelling, brother, Pig's here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Hit the evil spirit,&#8221; both Monkeys shouted, &#8220;hit the evil spirit.&#8221;</P>
<P>All this both horrified and delighted the family, who exclaimed, &#8220;We've got a whole lot of arhats who can ride on clouds staying with us. Even if we'd made a vow to feed monks we would never have been able to feed such holy men as these.&#8221; They were now more generous with their food and tea than ever. Then they began to worry that if the fight between the two Sun the Novices turned nasty, heaven and earth might be turned upside down: it could be disastrous.</P>
<P>Seeing that behind the old man's delight lay these deep misgivings Sanzang said to him, &#8220;There's no need to worry or alarm yourself, benefactor. When I made him submit and become my disciple he gave up evil and turned to good. Of course we will show you our gratitude.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That would be too great an honour,&#8221; the old man replied, &#8220;too great an honour.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop talking now, benefactor,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;and you sit here, Master. Pig and I'll each bring one of them back here to stand in front of you. When you say the spell the one who suffers will be the real Monkey and the one who doesn't will be the impostor.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a very good idea,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>Friar Sand then rose up into mid-air and said, &#8220;Stop it, both of you. I'm taking you for the master to choose between you.&#8221; The Great Sage then let go of his opponent, and so did the other Monkey. Friar Sand held one and told Pig to hold the other, and they took them both down by their clouds till they stood in front of the thatched cottage.</P>
<P>As soon as he saw them Sanzang began to say the Band-tightening Spell, at which both Monkeys cried out together, &#8220;Why do you have to say that spell when we're fighting so hard? Stop! Stop!&#8221; Being a kind and merciful man the venerable elder stopped reciting the spell before he had been able to tell them apart. The two Monkeys then broke free from Pig and Friar Sand and started fighting again.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brothers,&#8221; the Great Sage said, &#8220;look after the master while I fight this impostor down to get the Kings of the Underworld to tell which of us is which.&#8221; The other Monkey said likewise, and the two of them soon disappeared, grabbing and tugging at each other.</P>
<P>&#8220;Friar Sand,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;why didn't you grab the luggage off the fake Pig when you saw him carrying it at the Water Curtain Cave?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The evil spirits surrounded me when I killed my double with the demon-quelling staff,&#8221; Friar Sand replied. &#8220;They were going to get me, so I had to flee for my life. After I'd been to see the Bodhisattva and gone back to the cave entrance again with Monkey I overturned all their stone benches and scattered the little demons, but I couldn't see any entrance to the cave, only a waterfall. I came back empty-handed as I couldn't find the luggage.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Let me tell you something,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;When I went there a few years ago to ask him to come back we met outside the cave. After I'd persuaded him to come he jumped down and went into the cave to change. I saw him go straight through the water: the waterfall is the entrance. I bet that's where that devil has put our luggage.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As you know the way into the cave I think you'd better go and fetch our baggage from there while the demon's away,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;Even if Wukong does come back I still won't have him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm off then,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;There are thousands and thousands of little monkeys in front of the cave,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;It'd be terrible if they were too much for you by yourself.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm not worried,&#8221; said Pig, who rushed outside and headed off to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit to fetch the luggage.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The two Monkeys fought their way round to the back of the Dark Mountain of the Underworld, where all the demons shivered and shook with terror as they hid themselves. The ones who managed to run away first rushed straight to the Underworld government offices and reported to the Senluo Palace, &#8220;Your Majesties, two Great Sages Equaling Heaven have come to the Dark Mountain and are fighting their way here.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Ring of Qinguang in the First Palace reported this with alarm to the King of Chujiang in the Second Palace. The news was passed on in turn to King Songdi in the Third Palace, the King of Biancheng in the Fourth Palace, King Yama in the Fifth Palace, King Impartial in the Sixth Palace, the King of Taishan in the Seventh Palace, the Metropolitan King in the Eighth Palace, King Wuguan in the Ninth Palace, and King Everturning Wheel in the Tenth Palace. In an instant the Ten Kings all gathered together and sent an urgent message to King Ksitigarbha. Meanwhile the Underworld forces were mustered in the Senluo Palace ready to capture the true and the false Monkey. Just then there was the roar of a mighty wind as dreary mists filled the air and the two Monkeys came tumbling and rolling to the Senluo Palace.</P>
<P>The Lords of the Underworld stepped forward to block their way and say, &#8220;Great Sages, why are you making such disorder in our Underworld?&#8221;</P>
<P>To this the real Great Sage replied, &#8220;I was escorting the Tang Priest on his journey to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven when bandits tried to rob him on a mountain in the land of Western Liang. He got angry with me when I killed a few of them and sent me away. I went to tell my troubles to the Bodhisattva in the Southern Ocean. I never imagined that this demon would have the effrontery to turn himself into my double, attack my master on the road, and steal our baggage. When my fellow-disciple Friar Sand went back to my mountain to fetch the baggage he found that the demon had created an imitation of the master to take to the Western Heaven and fetch the scriptures, so he rushed to the Southern Ocean to see the Bodhisattva Guanyin and found me there at her side. After he'd told his story the Bodhisattva sent me back to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit with him to see what was going on. I found that this bastard had stolen my cave. We argued all the way to the Bodhisattva Guanyin's place, but she couldn't tell which of us was the real me. Then I fought with him up to Heaven, where none of the gods knew which of us was which, and after that went to see the master. When the master recited the Band-tightening Spell my double was in just as much pain as I was. That's why I've brought this chaos to the Underworld in the hope that Your Majesties will look up the Registers of Life and Death for me to find out about the False Sun the Novice's background so that I can catch his soul and end this confusion of there being two minds.&#8221; The demon then said the same thing.</P>
<P>The Lords of the Underworld called on the judges in charge of the records to go through them carefully from beginning to end. There was nobody under the name of False Sun the Novice. They checked through the registers of hairy beasts again, and found that under item 130 in the monkey section there was a record of how the Great Sage Sun had achieved the Way in his youth, made havoc in the Underworld and removed his name from the registers of death, so that from then on none of the monkeys were listed. When the judges had made their inspection they reported back to the palace.</P>
<P>Holding their tablets of office, the Lords of the Underworld said to Monkey, &#8220;Great Sage, there are no names in the records that can be checked. You will have to go back to the world of the living to be told apart.&#8221;</P>
<P>As they were saying this they heard the Bodhisattva King Ksitigarbha shout, &#8220;Wait, wait! I'll send Examiner to tell you apart.&#8221; Now Examiner was the name of an animal who lay under the Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha's sutra table. Just by lying there he could tell good from evil and wise from stupid among any of the snails, fish, hairy creatures, feathered creatures, insects, heavenly immortals, earthly immortals, divine immortals, human immortals and devil immortals in all the mountains, rivers and countries of the four great continents, in all cave heavens and in all blessed places. The animal lay on the ground in the courtyard of the Senluo Palace as Ksitigarbha instructed it.</P>
<P>A little later it raised its head and said to Ksitigarbha, &#8220;I've found the name of the demon, but I cannot say it to his face, nor can I help catch him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What would happen if you identified him to his face?&#8221; Ksitigarbha asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;If I did,&#8221; Examiner replied, &#8220;I am afraid that the evil spirit would turn nasty, make disorder in the palace and destroy the peace of the Underworld.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why won't you help capture him?&#8221; Ksitigarbha went on to ask, and Examiner replied, &#8220;The evil spirit's magic powers are no less than those of Sun Wukong. No matter how much dharma power the gods of the Underworld have, they would never be able to catch him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case, how is the evil spirit to be got rid of?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Boundless is the Buddha's Dharma,&#8221; Examiner replied. Ksitigarbha was now enlightened. &#8220;As you two look the same and have the same magic powers,&#8221; he said to both Monkeys, &#8220;if you want to be told apart you will have to go to Sakyamuni Buddha in Thunder Monastery.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right,&#8221; they both replied together, &#8220;you've right. You and I'll go to the Western Heaven to be told apart by the Lord Buddha.&#8221; They then took their leave of Ksitigarbha and were seen out by the Ten Kings of the Underworld as they went up to the Turquoise Cloud Palace, after which devils were sent to close the entrance to the Underworld.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Watch the two Monkeys as they fly by cloud and mist to the Western Heaven. There is a poem about it that goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Troubles arise if one has two minds;</P>
<P>Doubts cloud everything from sea to sky.</P>
<P>One desires fine horses and the highest rank,</P>
<P>Craving for eminence at the royal court.</P>
<P>Fighting North and South without respite,</P>
<P>They parry to East and West with never a pause.</P>
<P>In dhyana the secret of mindlessness must be learned;</P>
<P>Nourish the babe in silence and form the holy foetus.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The two of them fought as they flew through the air, grabbing, tugging, pulling and snatching at each other, all the way to the outside of the Thunder Monastery on Vulture Peak in the Western Heaven. Even before they arrived the four Bodhisattvas, the eight vajrapanis, the five hundred arhats, the three thousand protectors, the nuns, monks, lay people and all the holy hosts were standing beneath the seven-precious lotus throne listening to the Tathagata expounding the Dharma. This is what he was explaining:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>There is existence in non-existence, non-existence in non-non-existence. There is matter in non-matter, emptiness in non-emptiness. What exists is non-existent, and what does not exist is not non-existent. Non-matter is matter; non-emptiness is emptiness. Emptiness is emptiness and matter is matter. Matter is not permanent matter, matter is empty. Emptiness is not permanent emptiness, emptiness is matter. Know that emptiness is not empty and that matter is not matter. This is what is meant by insight and understanding the Wonderful Voice.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>All the host kowtowed in submission. Amid the sound of chanting the Tathagata released a shower of heavenly petals, left his throne and said to them. &#8220;You are all of one mind. Watch the struggle of two minds coming here.&#8221;</P>
<P>They all raised their eyes to look and saw the two Monkeys come shouting and yelling to the holy Thunder Peak. The eight vajrapanis were so alarmed that they stepped forward to block their way and say, &#8220;Where do you two think you are going?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This evil spirit has turned himself into my double,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;so I wish to go to the lotus throne to ask the Tathagata to tell that I am the real Sun Wukong and he is an impostor.&#8221;</P>
<P>As the vajrapanis could not stop them they yelled at each other right to the foot of the lotus throne, where they kowtowed and each of them said, &#8220;Your disciple has been escorting the Tang Priest here to fetch the true scriptures. Goodness only knows how much effort I've spent dealing with demons and capturing monsters along the way. Recently we were robbed by bandits, and I admit that I did twice kill some of them. The master was so angry with me that he sent me back and wouldn't let me come with him to worship your golden self. The only thing I could do was to go back to the Southern Ocean to tell my troubles to Guanyin. I never imagined that this evil spirit would make himself look and sound just like me, knock the master over, and steal our luggage. My brother Friar Sand went to my mountain looking for me and this monster talked a whole lot of fancy nonsense about having his own holy monk to go and fetch the scriptures. When Friar Sand got away and fled to the Southern Ocean to tell the whole story to Guanyin she sent us both back to my mountain. After that the two of us, the real me and the impostor side by side, fought our way to the Southern Ocean, Heaven, the Tang Priest and the Underworld, but nobody could tell which of us was which. That is why I've had the effrontery to come here to beg you in your infinite charity and mercy to identify me as the true Sun Wukong. Then I'll be able to escort the Tang Priest here to worship you in person and fetch the scriptures to take back to the East, so that the great teachings will be made known for ever.&#8221; Hearing the two of them saying the same things in the same voice, none of the host could tell them apart: only the Tathagata himself knew. He was just about to expose the impostor when a coloured cloud brought Guanyin from the South to see our Buddha.</P>
<P>&#8220;Noble Guanyin,&#8221; said our Buddha, putting his hands together in front of his chest, &#8220;can you tell the true Sun the Novice from the false one?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I could not tell them apart when they visited my island,&#8221; the Bodhisattva replied. &#8220;Since then they have been to Heaven and the Underworld, and still nobody could say which was which. That is why I have come to beg you, Tathagata, to identify the true Sun Wukong.&#8221;</P>
<P>To this the Buddha replied with a smile, &#8220;You all have very great dharma powers, but you can only scan everything that happens under the sky. You cannot know all the creatures and categories under the sky.&#8221; When the Bodhisattva asked what these categories were, the Buddha replied, &#8220;There are five kinds of immortal: heavenly, earthly, divine, human and demonic. There are five kinds of beast: snail, scaly, furry, feathered and insect. This wretch is not heavenly, earthly, divine, human or demonic. He is not a snail, or scaly, or furry, or feathered or an insect. Now there are also four kinds of ape that cause confusion and don't come under any of the ten categories.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;May I ask what these four kinds of ape are?&#8221; the Bodhisattva asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The first kind is the intelligent stone monkey,&#8221; the Buddha replied. &#8220;He can do all kinds of transformation, knows all about the seasons of Heaven and earthly advantages, and can move the stars and their constellations about. The second kind is the red-rumped mandril that knows all about the Yin and the Yang and human affairs, can go into or out of anywhere, and knows how to prolong its life and avoid death. The third kind is the magic-armed gibbon that can catch the sun or moon, shrink mountains, see what is auspicious and what is not, and fool around with heaven and earth. The fourth kind is the six-eared macaque which has wonderful hearing and perception. It knows about the past and the future and understands all creatures. These four kinds of ape do not come within any of the ten categories and are not listed among the creatures that live between heaven and earth. I can see that the false Sun Wukong is just such a six-eared macaque. Wherever he stands he can know what is happening hundreds of miles away and hear everything that is said. That is why he has such wonderful hearing, brilliant perception, and knowledge of the past, the future, and all beings; that is why he looks and sounds just like Wukong. He is a six-eared macaque.&#8221;</P>
<P>As soon as the macaque heard the Tathagata Buddha say who he really was, he started shaking with fear and took a great leap to get away. The Tathagata at once ordered his hosts to strike, and the macaque was immediately surrounded by the four Bodhisattvas, eight vajrapanis, five hundred arhats, three thousand protectors, and all the monks, nuns and lay people, as well as Guanyin and Moksa. The Great Sage Monkey rushed forward too.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't hit him, Wukong,&#8221; said the Tathagata. &#8220;I shall capture him for you.&#8221; The macaque's fur stood on end as he realized that there would be no escape, so he shook himself and turned straight into a bee who started to fly straight up, only to fall down again as the Tathagata's golden begging bowl was clapped over him. The host all thought he had got away. &#8220;Stop talking,&#8221; said the Buddha with a smile. &#8220;The evil spirit has not escaped. He is under my bowl.&#8221; They all surged forward to see him in his true form of a six-eared macaque as the bowl was lifted.</P>
<P>The Great Sage could not restrain himself. Swinging his iron cudgel he killed the demon with a single blow to the head, and that is why this species is now extinct. It was more than the Tathagata could bear.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is terrible,&#8221; he said, &#8220;this is terrible.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You shouldn't be sorry for him,&#8221; said the Great Sage. &#8220;He wounded my master and stole our bundles. According to the law he should get his head cut off for wounding in the course of theft and daylight robbery.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Go back at once to escort the Tang Priest here to fetch the scriptures,&#8221; said the Tathagata.</P>
<P>The Great Sage kowtowed to him in thanks and said, &#8220;I wish to report to the Tathagata that my master definitely refuses to have me. The journey would be a lot of trouble for nothing. I beg you in your kindness, Tathagata, to say the Band-loosening Spell. Then I can take this gold band off and give it back to you, and you can let me return to lay life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop those silly ideas and behave yourself,&#8221; said the Tathagata. &#8220;I shall send Guanyin to take you back to him. Of course he'll accept you. Protect him well, and when you succeed and reach ultimate bliss there will be a place on a lotus throne for you too.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the Bodhisattva Guanyin heard this she put her hands together to thank him for his mercy then took Wukong off by cloud followed by Moksa and the white parrot. They were soon back at the thatched cottage by the road. As soon as Friar Sand saw them he hurried out to ask the master to greet the Bodhisattva at the door.</P>
<P>&#8220;Tang Priest,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it was a six-eared macaque pretending to be Wukong who hit you the other day. Fortunately the Tathagata could tell who he was, and Wukong has now killed him. You must now take Wukong back. There are many demon obstacles on the way ahead and you must have his protection if you are to reach Vulture Peak, see the Buddha and fetch the scriptures, so stop being angry with him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I shall respectfully obey,&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>Just as he was kowtowing in thanks there was the roar of a whirlwind from the East carrying Pig with the two bundles on his back. Seeing the Bodhisattva the idiot kowtowed to her and said, &#8220;Your disciple left the master the other day and went back to the Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit to look for this luggage. I found the imitation Tang Priest and imitation Pig and killed the pair of them. They were both monkeys. Then I went inside and found the bundles. Nothing's missing&#8212;I've checked them over. So I came straight back by wind. What happened to the two Monkeys?&#8221;</P>
<P>The Bodhisattva then told him how the Tathagata had told the two of them apart. The idiot was delighted and gave thanks at great length. Master and disciples then said farewell to the Bodhisattva, who went back to the sea. The four of them were now once more of a single will and a single mind; all grievances had been washed away and anger removed. They thanked their hosts in the thatched cottage, retied the luggage, saddled up the horse, and headed West. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A separation on the journey muddled the Five Elements;</P>
<P>At the demon-subduing gathering enlightenment returned.</P>
<P>The spirit returned to the house of the mind and dhyana was calmed;</P>
<P>When the six perceptions were controlled the elixir was completed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know how long it was till Sanzang saw the Buddha and asked for the scriptures after setting out again listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>二心搅乱大乾坤</p>
<p>一体难修真寂灭</p>
</div>
<p>这行者与沙僧拜辞了菩萨，纵起两道祥光，离了南海。原来行者筋斗云快，沙和尚仙云觉迟，行者就要先行。沙僧扯住道：“大哥不必这等藏头露尾，先去安根，待小弟与你一同走。”</p>

<p>大圣本是良心，沙僧却有疑意，真个二人同驾云而去。不多时，果见花果山，按下云头，二人洞外细看，果见一个行者，高坐石台之上，与群猴饮酒作乐。模样与大圣无异：也是黄发金箍，金睛火眼；身穿也是锦布直裰，腰系虎皮裙；手中也拿一条儿金箍铁棒，足下也踏一双麂皮靴；也是这等毛脸雷公嘴，朔腮别土星，查耳额颅阔，獠牙向外生。这大圣怒发，一撒手，撇了沙和尚，掣铁棒上前骂道：“你是何等妖邪，敢变我的相貌，敢占我的儿孙，擅居吾仙洞，擅作这威福！”那行者见了，公然不答，也使铁棒来迎。二行者在一处，果是不分真假，好打呀：两条棒，二猴精，这场相敌实非轻。都要护持唐御弟，各施功绩立英名。真猴实受沙门教，假怪虚称佛子情。盖为神通多变化，无真无假两相平。一个是混元一气齐天圣，一个是久炼千灵缩地精。这个是如意金箍棒，那个是随心铁杆兵。隔架遮拦无胜败，撑持抵敌没输赢。先前交手在洞外，少顷争持起半空。他两个各踏云光，跳斗上九霄云内。沙僧在旁，不敢下手，见他们战此一场，诚然难认真假，欲待拔刀相助，又恐伤了真的。忍耐良久，且纵身跳下山崖，使降妖宝杖，打近水帘洞外，惊散群妖，掀翻石凳，把饮酒食肉的器皿，尽情打碎，寻他的青毡包袱，四下里全然不见。原来他水帘洞本是一股瀑布飞泉，遮挂洞门，远看似一条白布帘儿，近看乃是一股水脉，故曰水帘洞。沙僧不知进步来历，故此难寻。即便纵云，赶到九霄云里，轮着宝杖，又不好下手。大圣道：“沙僧，你既助不得力，且回复师父，说我等这般这般，等老孙与此妖打上南海落伽山菩萨前辨个真假。”道罢，那行者也如此说。沙僧见两个相貌、声音，更无一毫差别，皂白难分，只得依言，拨转云头，回复唐僧不题。</p>

<p>你看那两个行者，且行且斗，直嚷到南海，径至落伽山，打打骂骂，喊声不绝。早惊动护法诸天，即报入潮音洞里道：“菩萨，果然两个孙悟空打将来也。”那菩萨与木叉行者、善财童子、龙女降莲台出门喝道：“那孽畜那里走！”这两个递相揪住道：“菩萨，这厮果然象弟子模样。才自水帘洞打起，战斗多时，不分胜负。沙悟净肉眼愚蒙，不能分识，有力难助，是弟子教他回西路去回复师父，我与这厮打到宝山，借菩萨慧眼，与弟子认个真假，辨明邪正。”道罢，那行者也如此说一遍。众诸天与菩萨都看良久，莫想能认。菩萨道：“且放了手，两边站下，等我再看。”果然撒手，两边站定。这边说：“我是真的！”那边说：“他是假的！”</p>

<p>菩萨唤木叉与善财上前，悄悄吩咐：“你一个帮住一个，等我暗念《紧箍儿咒》，看那个害疼的便是真，不疼的便是假。”他二人果各帮一个。菩萨暗念真言，两个一齐喊疼，都抱着头，地下打滚，只叫：“莫念！莫念！”菩萨不念，他两个又一齐揪住，照旧嚷斗。菩萨无计奈何，即令诸天木叉，上前助力。众神恐伤真的，亦不敢下手。菩萨叫声“孙悟空”，两个一齐答应。菩萨道：“你当年官拜弼马温，大闹天宫时，神将皆认得你，你且上界去分辨回话。”这大圣谢恩，那行者也谢恩。</p>

<p>二人扯扯拉拉，口里不住的嚷斗，径至南天门外，慌得那广目天王帅马赵温关四大天将，及把门大小众神，各使兵器挡住道：“那里走！此间可是争斗之处？”大圣道：“我因保护唐僧往西天取经，在路上打杀贼徒，那三藏赶我回去，我径到普陀崖见观音菩萨诉苦，不想这妖精，几时就变作我的模样，打倒唐僧，抢去包袱。有沙僧至花果山寻讨，只见这妖精占了我的巢穴，后到普陀崖告请菩萨，又见我侍立台下，沙僧诳说是我驾筋斗云，又先在菩萨处遮饰。菩萨却是个正明，不听沙僧之言，命我同他到花果山看验。原来这妖精果象老孙模样，才自水帘洞打到普陀山见菩萨，菩萨也难识认，故打至此间，烦诸天眼力，与我认个真假。”说罢，那行者也似这般这般说了一遍。众天神看彀多时，也不能辨，他两个吆喝道：“你们既不能认，让开路，等我们去见玉帝！”众神搪抵不住，放开天门，直至灵霄宝殿，马元帅同张葛许邱四天师奏道：“下界有一般两个孙悟空，打进天门，口称见王。”说不了，两个直嚷将进来，唬得那玉帝即降立宝殿，问曰：“你两个因甚事擅闹天宫，嚷至朕前寻死！”大圣口称：“万岁！万岁！臣今皈命，秉教沙门，再不敢欺心诳上，只因这个妖精变作臣的模样。”如此如彼，把前情备陈了一遍，“指望与臣辨个真假！”那行者也如此陈了一遍。玉帝即传旨宣托塔李天王，教：“把照妖镜来照这厮谁真谁假，教他假灭真存。”天王即取镜照住，请玉帝同众神观看。镜中乃是两个孙悟空的影子，金箍衣服，毫发不差。玉帝亦辨不出，赶出殿外。这大圣呵呵冷笑，那行者也哈哈欢喜，揪头抹颈，复打出天门，坠落西方路上道：“我和你见师父去！我和你见师父去！”</p>

<p>却说那沙僧自花果山辞他两个，又行了三昼夜，回至本庄，把前事对唐僧说了一遍。唐僧自家悔恨道：“当时只说是孙悟空打我一棍，抢去包袱，岂知却是妖精假变的行者！”沙僧又告道：“这妖又假变一个长老，一匹白马，又有一个八戒挑着我们包袱，又有一个变作是我。我忍不住恼怒，一杖打死，原是一个猴精。因此惊散，又到菩萨处诉苦。菩萨着我与师兄又同去识认，那妖果与师兄一般模样。我难助力，故先来回复师父。”</p>

<p>三藏闻言，大惊失色。八戒哈哈大笑道：“好好好！应了这施主家婆婆之言了！他说有几起取经的，这却不又是一起？”那家子老老小小的，都来问沙僧：“你这几日往何处讨盘缠去的？”沙僧笑道：“我往东胜神洲花果山寻大师兄取讨行李，又到南海普陀山拜见观音菩萨，却又到花果山，方才转回至此。”那老者又问：“往返有多少路程？”沙僧道：“约有二十余万里。”老者道：“爷爷呀，似这几日，就走了这许多路，只除是驾云，方能彀得到！”八戒道：“不是驾云，如何过海？”沙僧道：“我们那算得走路，若是我大师兄，只消一二日，可往回也。”那家子听言，都说是神仙，八戒道：“我们虽不是神仙，神仙还是我们的晚辈哩！”</p>

<p>正说间，只听半空中喧哗人嚷，慌得都出来看，却是两个行者打将来。八戒见了，忍不住手痒道：“等我去认认看。”好呆子，急纵身跳起，望空高叫道：“师兄莫嚷，我老猪来也！”那两个一齐应道：“兄弟，来打妖精！来打妖精！”那家子又惊又喜道：“是几位腾云驾雾的罗汉歇在我家！就是发愿斋僧的，也斋不着这等好人！”更不计较茶饭，愈加供养，又说：“这两个行者只怕斗出不好来，地覆天翻，作祸在那里！”三藏见那老者当面是喜，背后是忧，即开言道：“老施主放心，莫生忧叹。贫僧收伏了徒弟，去恶归善，自然谢你。”那老者满口回答道：“不敢！不敢！”沙僧道：“施主休讲，师父可坐在这里，等我和二哥去，一家扯一个来到你面前，你就念念那话儿，看那个害疼的就是真的，不疼的就是假的。”三藏道：“言之极当。”沙僧果起在半空道：“二位住了手，我同你到师父面前辨个真假去。”这大圣放了手，那行者也放了手。沙僧搀住一个，叫道：“二哥，你也搀住一个。”果然搀住，落下云头，径至草舍门外。三藏见了，就念《紧箍儿咒》，二人一齐叫苦道：“我们这等苦斗，你还咒我怎的？莫念！莫念！”那长老本心慈善，遂住了口不念，却也不认得真假。他两个挣脱手，依然又打。这大圣道：“兄弟们，保着师父，等我与他打到阎王前折辨去也！”那行者也如此说，二人抓抓挜挜，须臾又不见了。八戒道：“沙僧，你既到水帘洞，看见假八戒挑着行李，怎么不抢将来？”沙僧道：“那妖精见我使宝杖打他假沙僧，他就乱围上来要拿，是我顾性命走了。及告菩萨，与行者复至洞口，他两个打在空中，是我去掀翻他的石凳，打散他的小妖，只见一股瀑布泉水流，竟不知洞门开在何处，寻不着行李，所以空手回复师命也。”八戒道：“你原来不晓得。</p>

<p>我前年请他去时，先在洞门外相见，后被我说泛了他，他就跳下，去洞里换衣来时，我看见他将身往水里一钻，那一股瀑布水流，就是洞门。想必那怪将我们包袱收在那里面也。”三藏道：“你既知此门，你可趁他都不在家，可先到他洞里取出包袱，我们往西天去罢。他就来，我也不用他了。”八戒道：“我去。”沙僧说：“二哥，他那洞前有千数小猴，你一人恐弄他不过，反为不美。”八戒笑道：“不怕！不怕！”急出门，纵着云雾，径上花果山寻取行李不题。</p>

<p>却说那两个行者又打嚷到阴山背后，唬得那满山鬼战战兢兢，藏藏躲躲。有先跑的，撞入阴司门里，报上森罗宝殿道：</p>

<p>“大王，背阴山上，有两个齐天大圣打得来也！”慌得那第一殿秦广王传报与二殿楚江王、三殿宋帝王、四殿卞城王，五殿阎罗王、六殿平等王、七殿泰山王、八殿都市王、九殿忤官王、十殿转轮王。一殿转一殿，霎时间，十王会齐，又着人飞报与地藏王。尽在森罗殿上，点聚阴兵，等擒真假。只听得那强风滚滚，惨雾漫漫，二行者一翻一滚的，打至森罗殿下。阴君近前挡住道：“大圣有何事，闹我幽冥？”这大圣道：“我因保唐僧西天取经，路过西梁国，至一山，有强贼截劫我师，是老孙打死几个，师父怪我，把我逐回。我随到南海菩萨处诉告，不知那妖精怎么就绰着口气，假变作我的模样，在半路上打倒师父，抢夺了行李。师弟沙僧，向我本山取讨包袱，这妖假立师名，要往西天取经。沙僧跑遁至南海见菩萨，我正在侧，他备说原因，菩萨又命我同他至花果山观看，果被这厮占了我巢穴。我与他争辨到菩萨处，其实相貌、言语等俱一般，菩萨也难辨真假。又与这厮打上天堂，众神亦果难辨，因见我师，我师念《紧箍咒》试验，与我一般疼痛。故此闹至幽冥，望阴君与我查看生死簿，见假行者是何出身，快早追他魂魄，免教二心沌乱。”那怪亦如此说一遍。阴君闻言，即唤管簿判官一一从头查勘，更无个假行者之名。再看毛虫文簿，那猴子一百三十条已是孙大圣幼年得道之时，大闹阴司，消死名一笔勾之，自后来凡是猴属，尽无名号。</p>

<p>查勘毕当殿回报，阴君各执笏对行者说：“大圣，幽冥处既无名号可查，你还到阳间去折辨。”正说处，只听得地藏王菩萨道：</p>

<p>“且住！且住！等我着谛听与你听个真假。”原来那谛听是地藏菩萨经案下伏的一个兽名。他若伏在地下，一霎时，将四大部洲山川社稷、洞天福地之间，蠃虫鳞虫毛虫羽虫昆虫，天仙地仙神仙人仙鬼仙可以顾鉴善恶，察听贤愚。那兽奉地藏钧旨，就于森罗庭院之中，俯伏在地，须臾抬起头来，对地藏道：“怪名虽有，但不可当面说破，又不能助力擒他。”地藏道：“当面说出便怎么？”谛听道：“当面说出，恐妖精恶发，搔扰宝殿，致令阴府不安。”又问：“何为不能助力擒拿？”谛听道：“妖精神通，与孙大圣无二。幽冥之神，能有多少法力？故此不能擒拿。”地藏道：“似这般怎生祛除？”谛听言：“佛法无边。”地藏早已省悟，即对行者道：“你两个形容如一，神通无二，若要辨明，须到雷音寺释迦如来那里，方得明白。”两个一齐嚷道：“说的是！说的是！我和你西天佛祖之前折辨去！”那十殿阴君送出，谢了地藏，回上翠云宫，着鬼使闭了幽冥关隘不题。</p>

<p>看那两个行者，飞云奔雾，打上西天。有诗为证，诗曰：人有二心生祸灾，天涯海角致疑猜。欲思宝马三公位，又忆金銮一品台，南征北讨无休歇，东挡西除未定哉。禅门须学无心诀，静养婴儿结圣胎。他两个在那半空里，扯扯拉拉，抓抓挜挜，且行且斗，直嚷至大西天灵鹫仙山雷音宝刹之外。早见那四大菩萨、八大金刚、五百阿罗、三千揭谛、比丘尼、比丘僧、优婆塞、优婆夷诸大圣众，都到七宝莲台之下，各听如来说法。那如来正讲到这：不有中有，不无中无。不色中色，不空中空。非有为有，非无为无。非色为色，非空为空。空即是空，色即是色。色无定色，色即是空。空无定空，空即是色。知空不空，知色不色。</p>

<p>名为照了，始达妙音。概众稽首皈依，流通诵读之际，如来降天花普散缤纷，即离宝座，对大众道：“汝等俱是一心，且看二心竞斗而来也。”大众举目看之，果是两个行者，吆天喝地，打至雷音胜境。慌得那八大金刚上前挡住道：“汝等欲往那里去？”</p>

<p>这大圣道：“妖精变作我的模样，欲至宝莲台下，烦如来为我辨个虚实也。”众金刚抵挡不住，直嚷至台下，跪于佛祖之前拜告道：“弟子保护唐僧，来造宝山，求取真经，一路上炼魔缚怪，不知费了多少精神。前至中途，偶遇强徒劫掳，委是弟子二次打伤几人，师父怪我赶回，不容同拜如来金身。弟子无奈，只得投奔南海，见观音诉苦。不期这个妖精，假变弟子声音相貌，将师父打倒，把行李抢去。师弟悟净寻至我山，被这妖假捏巧言，说有真僧取经之故。悟净脱身至南海，备说详细。观音知之，遂令弟子同悟净再至我山。因此，两人比并真假，打至南海，又打到天宫，又曾打见唐僧，打见冥府，俱莫能辨认。故此大胆轻造，千乞大开方便之门，广垂慈悯之念，与弟子辨明邪正，庶好保护唐僧亲拜金身，取经回东土，永扬大教。”大众听他两张口一样声俱说一遍，众亦莫辨，惟如来则通知之。正欲道破，忽见南下彩云之间，来了观音，参拜我佛。</p>

<p>我佛合掌道：“观音尊者，你看那两个行者，谁是真假？”菩萨道：“前日在弟子荒境，委不能辨。他又至天宫地府，亦俱难认，特来拜告如来，千万与他辨明辨明。”如来笑道：“汝等法力广大，只能普阅周天之事，不能遍识周天之物，亦不能广会周天之种类也。”菩萨又请示周天种类，如来才道：“周天之内有五仙，乃天地神人鬼；有五虫，乃蠃鳞毛羽昆。这厮非天非地非神非人非鬼，亦非蠃非鳞非毛非羽非昆。又有四猴混世，不入十类之种。”菩萨道：“敢问是那四猴？”如来道：“第一是灵明石猴，通变化，识天时，知地利，移星换斗。第二是赤尻马猴，晓阴阳，会人事，善出入，避死延生。第三是通臂猿猴，拿日月，缩千山，辨休咎，乾坤摩弄。第四是六耳猕猴，善聆音，能察理，知前后，万物皆明。此四猴者，不入十类之种，不达两间之名。我观假悟空乃六耳猕猴也。此猴若立一处，能知千里外之事，凡人说话，亦能知之，故此善聆音，能察理，知前后，万物皆明。与真悟空同象同音者，六耳猕猴也。”那猕猴闻得如来说出他的本象，胆战心惊，急纵身，跳起来就走。如来见他走时，即令大众下手，早有四菩萨、八金刚、五百阿罗、三千揭谛、比丘僧、比丘尼、优婆塞、优婆夷、观音、木叉，一齐围绕。孙大圣也要上前，如来道：“悟空休动手，待我与你擒他。”那猕猴毛骨悚然，料着难脱，即忙摇身一变，变作个蜜蜂儿，往上便飞。如来将金钵盂撇起去，正盖着那蜂儿，落下来。大众不知，以为走了，如来笑云：“大众休言，妖精未走，见在我这钵盂之下。”大众一发上前，把钵盂揭起，果然见了本象，是一个六耳猕猴。孙大圣忍不住，轮起铁棒，劈头一下打死，至今绝此一种。如来不忍，道声：</p>

<p>“善哉！善哉！”大圣道：“如来不该慈悯他，他打伤我师父，抢夺我包袱，依律问他个得财伤人，白昼抢夺，也该个斩罪哩！”如来道：“你自快去保护唐僧来此求经罢。”大圣叩头谢道：“上告如来得知，那师父定是不要我，我此去，若不收留，却不又劳一番神思！望如来方便，把松箍儿咒念一念，褪下这个金箍，交还如来，放我还俗去罢。”如来道：“你休乱想，切莫放刁。我教观音送你去，不怕他不收。好生保护他去，那时功成归极乐，汝亦坐莲台。”</p>

<p>那观音在旁听说，即合掌谢了圣恩，领悟空，辄驾云而去，随后木叉行者、白鹦哥，一同赶上。不多时，到了中途草舍人家，沙和尚看见，急请师父拜门迎接。菩萨道：“唐僧，前日打你的，乃假行者六耳猕猴也，幸如来知识，已被悟空打死。你今须是收留悟空，一路上魔障未消，须得他保护你，才得到灵山，见佛取经，再休嗔怪。”三藏叩头道：“谨遵教旨。”正拜谢时，只听得正东上狂风滚滚，众目视之，乃猪八戒背着两个包袱，驾风而至。呆子见了菩萨，倒身下拜道：“弟子前日别了师父至花果山水帘洞寻得包袱，果见一个假唐僧假八戒，都被弟子打死，原是两个猴身。却入里，方寻着包袱，当时查点，一物不少。却驾风转此，更不知两行者下落如何。”菩萨把如来识怪之事，说了一遍。那呆子十分欢喜，称谢不尽。师徒们拜谢了，菩萨回海，却都照旧合意同心，洗冤解怒。又谢了那村舍人家，整束行囊马匹，找大路而西。正是：中道分离乱五行，降妖聚会合元明。神归心舍禅方定，六识祛降丹自成。毕竟这去，不知三藏几时得面佛求经，且听下回分解。</p>
