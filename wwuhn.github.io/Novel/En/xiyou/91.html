<P>By Giving and Receiving the Master and the Lion Turn into One</P>
<P>After Stealing the Way and Obstructing Dhyana Ninefold Numinosity Is Pacified</P>
</div>
<P>The story tells how the Great Sage Sun left the city with Pig and Friar Sand and looked the monsters in the face to see that they were all lions of various kinds. The Tawny Lion Spirit was leading, with Leo and Elephant-fighter Lion on his left, Gryphon and Raccoon-dog Lion on his right and Monkey Lion with Snowy Lion behind him. In the middle of them all was a nine-headed lion. The ogre Greenface was holding a canopy of brocade embroidered with flowers just behind the nine-headed lion; while Wily Freak and Freaky Wile carried a pair of red flags. They were all drawn up at a hollow place.</P>
<P>In his rough way Pig went up to them to shout abusively, &#8220;Ogres! Thieves! Treasure-stealers! What did you go there and gang up with that hairy lot for?&#8221;</P>
<P>To this the Tawny Lion Spirit retorted, gnashing his teeth in fury, &#8220;Vicious baldies! When I was alone yesterday the three of you beat me and I had to run away. You should have done right, instead of burning my cave palace, destroying my mountain home and murdering my family. My hatred for you is as great as the ocean. Stay where you are and take this from my halberd!&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Pig raised his rake to parry the blow. When the two of them had just started fighting and neither was yet coming out on top Monkey Lion joined in, swinging his spiked iron club, as did Snowy Lion with his three-edged mace.</P>
<P>&#8220;Welcome,&#8221; shouted Pig. Watch him as he charges straight forward to meet their onslaught and fight with them all. Friar Sand quickly pulled his demon-quelling staff out from where he was at the side and hurried forward to help Pig, at which Leo Spirit, Gryphon Spirit, Elephant-fighter Spirit and Raccoon-dog Spirit all piled in. The Great Sage Monkey held the evil spirits at bay with his gold-banded cudgel. Leo fought with a club, Snowy with a bronze hammer, Elephant-fighter with a steel spear and Raccoon-dog with a battleaxe.</P>
<P>The fight between the seven lion spirits and the three ferocious monks was a splendid one:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Club, hammer, spear, axe and three-edged mace,</P>
<P>Spiked club, ball-staff and four-bright halberd:</P>
<P>Seven lions with seven deadly weapons,</P>
<P>Shouting their war cries as they surround three monks.</P>
<P>Powerful was the Great Sage's gold-banded cudgel;</P>
<P>Friar Sand's staff was almost matchless in the world.</P>
<P>Pig moved around with the power of a whirlwind</P>
<P>As his flashing rake gave off baleful light.</P>
<P>All, displaying their might, blocked before and behind,</P>
<P>Held off the onslaughts with daring and courage.</P>
<P>From the walls of the city the prince lent support,</P>
<P>Where his soldiers felt braver as they beat drums and gongs.</P>
<P>Throwing and thrusting, all showed off their magic,</P>
<P>Turning heaven and earth both dark and upside-down.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After the evil spirits had been fighting the Great Sage and the two others for half a day, night fell. Pig by now was dribbling and his legs were going weak, so he feinted with his rake and fled in defeat.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where do you think you're going?&#8221; Snowy Lion and Monkey Lion shouted. &#8220;Take this!&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot could not dodge them, and he took a heavy blow from the mace on his spine that laid him flat on the ground crying out, &#8220;I'm done for, I'm done for!&#8221;</P>
<P>The two lion spirits grabbed Pig by the bristles on his neck and by his tail and carried him over to see the nine-headed lion, &#8220;Grandfather,&#8221; they reported, &#8220;we've caught one of them.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before the words were out of their mouths Friar Sand and Monkey also had to fall back, beaten. When the evil spirits all came after them Monkey pulled out a handful of hairs, chewed them to pieces, spat them out, shouted, &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned them into more than one hundred little Monkeys who went round and round, surrounding Snowy, Leo, Elephant-fighter, Raccoon-dog and Tawny Lion. Friar Sand and Monkey then came forward to join in the fight again. Later that night they caught Leo and Gryphon and put Raccoon-dog and Elephant-fighter to flight.</P>
<P>When Tawny Lion reported to the old demon that two of the lions had been lost the demon ordered, &#8220;Tie Pig up but don't kill him. When they give our lions back we'll return Pig to them. If they're stupid enough to kill them we'll make Pig pay with his life.&#8221; That evening all the fiends slept outside the city.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story now turns to the Great Sage Sun, who carried the two lion spirits to beside the city wall, from where the senior prince saw him and ordered that the gates be opened. Twenty or thirty officers were sent out with rope to tie the lion spirits up and carry them into the city. The Great Sage then put his magic hairs away and went straight with Friar Sand to the wall tower, where he saw the Tang Priest.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is a terrible business,&#8221; the Tang Priest said. &#8220;Is Wuneng still alive?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No problem,&#8221; Brother Monkey replied. &#8220;As we've captured a couple of the evil spirits they won't possibly dare harm him. Have them tied up tight. I'll swap them for Pig tomorrow morning.&#8221;</P>
<P>The three young princes then kowtowed to Monkey and said, &#8220;When you were fighting them at first you were by yourself, Teacher. Then when you pretended to run away and came back again there were over a hundred of you. How was that done? When you came back to the city wall after capturing the evil spirits there was only one of you again. What magical powers did you use to do that?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have 84,000 hairs on my body,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Each of them can become ten, and the ten become a hundred, so I can do millions and millions of transformations. It's extra body magic.&#8221; The princes all kowtowed as a vegetarian feast was brought to the tower for them. All along the battlements lanterns and banners were displayed. There was the sound of clappers, bells, gongs and drums as the watches were changed, arrows passed on, cannons fired and warcries shouted.</P>
<P>Soon it was dawn, and the old demon sent for Tawny Lion Spirit to make a plan of action: &#8220;You must all use your wits to capture Sun the Novice and Friar Sand while I make a secret flight up onto the wall to capture their master, the old prince and his sons. I'll take them back to the Nine-bend Twisty Cave and wait for you to come back in triumph.&#8221;</P>
<P>Accepting this plan, Tawny Lion took Monkey Lion, Snowy Lion, Elephant-fighter and Raccoon-dog back to beside the city wall, all carrying their weapons and demanding battle amid winds and fog.</P>
<P>On the other side Monkey and Friar Sand jumped on the wall, where Monkey yelled abusively at the top of his voice, &#8220;Thieving damned ogres! Give me my brother Pig back this moment and I'll spare your lives. If you don't I'll smash your bones to powder and chop you all into little pieces.&#8221; With no further argument the evil spirits all charged into the attack. The Great Sage and Friar Sand had to use skill and cunning to hold the five lions at bay. This fight was very different from the one on the previous day.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As an evil wind howled across the land</P>
<P>Black fog blotted out the sky.</P>
<P>Moving stones and flying sands alarmed both gods and demons;</P>
<P>As the trees in the forest fell the tigers and wolves were afraid.</P>
<P>Fierce was the spear of steel and bright the axe,</P>
<P>Merciless the rod, the halberd and the brazen hammer.</P>
<P>They wished they could swallow Monkey up whole,</P>
<P>And capture Friar Sand live and kicking.</P>
<P>The Great Sage's As-You-Will cudgel</P>
<P>Could attack and defend with miraculous effect.</P>
<P>Friar Sand's demon-quelling staff</P>
<P>Had won its fame outside the Hall of Miraculous Mist.</P>
<P>Now that it moved with its magical powers,</P>
<P>It would achieve glory in the West by wiping out demons.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>While the five lion spirits with coats of different colours were fighting really well with Monkey and Friar Sand the old demon flew on a black cloud straight to the wall tower, where he shook his heads, which gave the military and civil officials, Sanzang, the senior prince and the soldiers guarding the wall such a fright that they all fell off. The demon then charged into the tower, opened his mouths, took Sanzang, the senior prince and his sons in them one by one, and went back to the hollow ground, where he took Pig in another mouth, one of the nine he had in his nine heads. One mouth held the Tang Priest, one Pig, one the senior prince, one his eldest son, one the second son and one the third son.</P>
<P>With six mouths full of six people he still had three mouths empty and wide open as he roared, &#8220;I'm going back ahead.&#8221; The five junior lion spirits all fought more bravely than ever now that they had seen their grandfather's triumph.</P>
<P>As soon as Monkey heard the yells from the wall and realized he had fallen for a trick, he gave Friar Sand a quick shout to be careful then pulled all the hairs off his arms, put them in his mouth, chewed them up and spat them out as well over a thousand little Monkeys who swarmed into the attack. They knocked Monkey Lion over, took Snowy alive, captured Elephant-fighter, laid Raccoon-dog Lion low and killed Tawny Lion; but as they returned to the city wall with a great hubbub they let Greenface, Wily Freak and Freaky Wile escape. When the officers on the wall saw what had happened they opened the gates, tied up the five lion spirits with ropes and carried them into the city.</P>
<P>But before they could deal with them the princess appeared, sobbing and weeping, to say, &#8220;Holy teachers, His Royal Highness the prince, our sons and your master are all dead. How ever is this isolated city to survive?&#8221;</P>
<P>Putting his magic hairs away, Monkey bowed to her and said, &#8220;Don't upset yourself, Princess. It was only because I'd captured seven of his lion spirits that the old demon carried off my master, His Royal Highness and your sons with catching magic. I'm certain they'll come to no harm. My brother-disciple and I will go to his mountain first thing tomorrow morning, and I can guarantee that we'll catch the old demon and bring your four princes back to you.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the princess and her womenfolk heard this they all bowed to Monkey and said, &#8220;We pray that His Royal Highness and his sons will all be safe and that our dynasty will be secure.&#8221; When their bowing was done the womenfolk all returned to the palace in tears.</P>
<P>&#8220;Skin the Tawny Lion spirit we killed,&#8221; Brother Monkey instructed the officials, &#8220;and have the five who are still alive securely tied up and put under lock and key. Bring us some vegetarian food to eat before we go to sleep. Stop worrying: I promise nothing will go wrong.&#8221;</P>
<P>The next morning the Great Sage took Friar Sand up on an auspicious cloud. Before long they were at the top of Bamboo Mountain, and as they brought their cloud down to look they saw that it was magnificent:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Rows of jutting peaks,</P>
<P>Sheer and craggy ridges.</P>
<P>In the deep gill waters gently flow;</P>
<P>Flowers weave a fragrant brocade before the beetling cliff,</P>
<P>Where the ridges twist and double back,</P>
<P>Encircled by the ancient winding paths.</P>
<P>When the crane comes the pine has a companion,</P>
<P>And the rock is left alone as the cloud drifts away.</P>
<P>The black ape heads for brightness when looking for fruit;</P>
<P>The deer rejoice in the warming sun as they search for flowers.</P>
<P>The green phoenix sings sweetly</P>
<P>And the golden bird's melodies never stop.</P>
<P>In spring the peach blossom contends with the plum;</P>
<P>In summer the willow and locust trees are rivals.</P>
<P>In autumn are carpets of chrysanthemums,</P>
<P>And in winter the snow flies all around.</P>
<P>Here there is beauty throughout the year,</P>
<P>Where the scenery can compare with Yingzhou's magic land.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As the two of them were standing on the mountain admiring the view Greenface suddenly appeared in a ravine between cliffs. He was holding a short cudgel. &#8220;Where do you think you're going?&#8221; Monkey shouted. &#8220;I'm here.&#8221;</P>
<P>This gave the young devil such a fright that he went running and tumbling down the ravine. Monkey and Friar Sand went straight after him but could find no sign of where he had gone. When they went further and searched around they found a cave palace with double gates of mottled stone that were firmly closed. Above the gates a stone tablet was set on which was written in large block letters:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>NINE-BEND TWISTY CAVE,</P>
<P>MIGHTY BAMBOO MOUNTAIN</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Now when the junior devil ran inside the cave he had shut the gates firmly behind him. Once inside he reported to the old demon, &#8220;My lord, those two monks are outside.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Have your lord, Monkey Lion, Snowy Lion, Elephant-fighter and Raccoon-dog come back yet?&#8221; the old demon asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I haven't seen them,&#8221; the junior demon replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;There were just the two monks looking around from high up on the peak. As soon as I saw them I turned and ran. As they came after me I shut the gates.&#8221;</P>
<P>The old demon bowed his head in silence at this news. After a while his tears began to flow as he called out, &#8220;This is terrible. My grandson Tawny Lion is dead. My grandsons Monkey Lion and the rest of them have all been captured by those monks and taken into the city. How am I to get my revenge?&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig was tied up nearby, crammed in together with the Tang Priest and the princes, terrified and miserable until he heard the old demon saying that his grandsons had been captured and taken into the city. At this he said with quiet delight, &#8220;Don't be afraid, Master. Cheer up, Your Royal Highness. My elder brother has won. He's captured the whole lot of the devils and he's found his way here to rescue us.&#8221;</P>
<P>When he had said this the old demon could be heard shouting, &#8220;Little ones, guard the place well while I go out to catch those other two monks. Then we can punish them all together.&#8221;</P>
<P>Watch him as he strides off without armor or weapons. When he heard Monkey shouting he threw the gates of the cave wide open and went straight for him, not deigning to answer. Monkey raised his iron cudgel to stop him with a blow to the head while Friar Sand swung his staff at him. As the demon shook his principal head the eight other heads to left and right of it all opened their mouths, with which they gently picked Monkey and Friar Sand up and carried them into the cave.</P>
<P>&#8220;Fetch rope,&#8221; he ordered; and Wily Freak, Freaky Wile and Greenface, who had come back after their escape the previous night, brought two ropes with which they tied the two of them up very securely. &#8220;Impudent ape,&#8221; said the old demon, &#8220;you captured my seven grandsons. But now I've caught you four monks and the four princes I've got enough to ransom them with. Little ones, get some thorns and willow rods and beat this ape for me to avenge my grandson Tawny Lion.&#8221;</P>
<P>The three junior devils then beat Monkey with willow rods, but Monkey's body had been so toughened that all the rods could do was to scratch his itches. He made no sound and was not in the least bothered, no matter how hard they hit him. The sight of it, however, made Pig, the Tang Priest and the princes all feel their hair standing on end. Before long the rods started to break up, but the demons kept on till evening, keeping no count of the number of strokes.</P>
<P>Friar Sand was most upset to see Monkey being given so long a flogging, so he said, &#8220;Let me take a hundred or so for him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be so impatient,&#8221; the old demon replied, &#8220;you'll get your beating tomorrow. You'll all be done in turn.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That means it'll be me the day after tomorrow,&#8221; said Pig with alarm. The beating continued for a while as night slowly fell.</P>
<P>&#8220;Little ones,&#8221; the old demon called, &#8220;stop for now. Light the lamp and go for something to eat and drink. I'm off to my Brocade Cloud Den for a little shut-eye. You three have all had a hard time, so keep a close watch on them. We'll carry on with the beatings tomorrow.&#8221; The three junior devils moved a lamp over and hit Monkey some more on the top of his head with their willow rods, tic-tic-toc, toc-toc-tic, like the rhythm of a wooden clapper, sometimes fast and sometimes slow. By then it was very late and they all fell asleep.</P>
<P>Monkey now used escaping magic to shrink himself, wriggled out of his bonds, shook his fur, straightened up his clothes, took the cudgel out of his ear and shook it till it was as thick as a well-bucket and about twenty feet long.</P>
<P>Then he said to the three junior devils, &#8220;You animals, you hit me an awful lot of times, and now I'm going to return the compliment. I'll just shove this at you and see how you like it.&#8221; One gentle push from the cudgels turned the three devils into three lumps of minced pork. Monkey then turned up the lamp and released Friar Sand.</P>
<P>Pig, who was feeling desperate about being tied up, could not stop himself from yelling at the top of his voice, &#8220;My hands and feet are tied up so tight they're swollen. Why don't you come and free me?&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot's shout at once woke up the old demon, who rolled straight out of bed and called out, &#8220;Who's setting them free?&#8221; The moment Monkey heard this he blew out the lamp, smashed his way through several sets of doors with his cudgel and fled, not bothering about Friar Sand and the rest of them, while the old demon went into the main hall shouting, &#8220;Little ones, why's there no light? Don't let them get away!&#8221; He shouted once without getting an answer, then again, and still no answer.</P>
<P>When he fetched a lantern and looked all he could see were three gory lumps of minced meat on the floor. The prince, his sons, the Tang Priest and Pig were still there, but Monkey and Friar Sand had disappeared. He lit a torch, searched the front and the back and could find only Friar Sand, who was still standing pressed against the wall of a corridor. The demon knocked him down, tied him up as before, and carried on looking for Monkey. Seeing that pair after pair of his doors had been smashed down, he realized that Monkey had destroyed them in his flight. Instead of giving chase he patched up and blockaded the doors and guarded his home.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story now tells how Monkey left the Nine-bend Twisty Cave and rode by auspicious cloud straight back to the city of Yuhua, where all the local deities and spirits as well as the god of the city could be seen bowing in mid-air to greet him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why have you only come to see me today?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;When we knew that the worthy prince was entertaining you in Yuhua, Great Sage,&#8221; they replied, &#8220;we did not venture to greet you. But now that the princes have been captured by ogres and you have subdued those monsters we have come to welcome you with kowtows.&#8221; While Monkey was abusing them the Gold-headed Protector and the Six Ding and Six Jia generals escorted a local deity in and made him kneel on the ground.</P>
<P>&#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; they said, &#8220;we've arrested this ground devil.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What are you making a noise here for instead of guarding my master on Bamboo Mountain?&#8221; Monkey yelled.</P>
<P>&#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; the Ding and Jia gods replied, &#8220;the evil spirit caught the Curtain-raising General and tied him up again after you escaped. As we could see how great his magic powers are we've brought the local deity of Bamboo Mountain here. He knows all about that evil spirit's background, so we beg you to question him, Great Sage, and find out how best to deal with him and deliver the holy monks and worthy princes from their suffering.&#8221; When Monkey heard this he was delighted.</P>
<P>&#8220;The old demon came down to Bamboo Mountain the year before last,&#8221; the local deity said, shivering and shaking as he kowtowed. &#8220;The Nine-bend Twisty Cave used to be the den of six lions. Once the old demon came the six lions all took him as their grandfather. He is a nine-headed lion called the Primal Sage of Ninefold Numinosity. If you want to deal with him you must go to the Wonderful Crag Palace in the uttermost East and fetch his master here to subdue him. Nobody else can possibly do it.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he thought for a long time before saying, &#8220;The Wonderful Crag Palace in the uttermost East is where the Heavenly Honoured Saviour of the Great Monad lives. Yes, he does have just such a nine-headed lion under his throne. Protector, Jias,&#8221; he ordered, &#8220;go back with the local deity and keep a secret watch on the master, my brother disciple, the prince of the city and his sons. The city god must guard the wall and moat. Off you go.&#8221; The gods all took up guard as instructed.</P>
<P>The Great Sage set off his somersault cloud and traveled through the night till it was about the last watch, when he reached the Eastern Gate of Heaven, where he ran into the Heavenly King Virupaksa with his retinue of heavenly soldiers and warriors, who stopped, put their hands together in greeting and asked, &#8220;Where are you going, Great Sage?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm off to the Wonderful Crag Palace,&#8221; Monkey replied when he had returned their greetings. &#8220;Why have you come to the Eastern Heaven instead of following your road to the Western Heaven?&#8221; Virupaksa asked. &#8220;When we reached the city of Yuhua,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;the prince of the city entertained us and told his three sons to take us as their teachers of martial arts. We had a most unpleasant surprise: coming up against a gang of lion monsters. Now I'm going to ask the Heavenly Honoured Saviour of the Great Monad, the chief monster's owner, to subdue him and save my master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It was because you wanted to be a teacher that you provoked that trouble with the lions,&#8221; said the heavenly king. &#8220;How true,&#8221; replied Monkey with a smile, &#8220;how true.&#8221; The heavenly soldiers and warriors all raised joined hands in greeting then stood aside to let him pass. Monkey went in through the Eastern Gate of Heaven and was soon at the Wonderful Crag Palace. This is what could be seen:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Coloured clouds behind coloured clouds,</P>
<P>Purple mists and rich, green vegetation.</P>
<P>The roof-tiles are a surge of golden flame,</P>
<P>And at the gates are imposing beasts of jade.</P>
<P>Flowers grow between gate towers, round which red mists drift;</P>
<P>The sun shines on turquoise vapors rising from the woods.</P>
<P>All the immortals pay their respects,</P>
<P>And a thousand sages make everything flourish.</P>
<P>The halls of the palace are like layers of brocade;</P>
<P>Windows and pavilions open on all sides.</P>
<P>Azure dragons glow with sacred clouds;</P>
<P>Golden beams of brilliant light come from the magic mists.</P>
<P>This is a land of splendor and eternal joy,</P>
<P>The Wonderful Crag Palace in the uttermost East.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>There was an immortal boy wearing a rainbow mantle standing at the palace gates, and as soon as he noticed the Great Sage he went in to report, &#8220;My lord, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven who made havoc in Heaven is here.&#8221; When the Heavenly Honoured Saviour of the Great Monad heard this he ordered all the immortals in attendance on him to go out to welcome Monkey and bring him into the palace. Here the Heavenly Honoured One was sitting on a nine-coloured lotus throne amid countless rays of auspicious light, and when he saw Monkey he came down from his throne to greet him while Monkey bowed to him from below.</P>
<P>&#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; the Heavenly Honoured One said, returning his bow, &#8220;I haven't seen you for years, but I did hear that you have abandoned the Way for Buddhism and are escorting the Tang Priest to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven. I presume that you have now succeeded.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;but near enough. I have escorted the Tang Priest as far as Yuhua, where the prince told his three sons to take me and the other two as their teachers of martial arts and had copies of our three magic weapons made. The weapons were, to our surprise, stolen one night. When I searched for them the next day I found that they had been stolen by a spirit turned by a golden-haired lion from Tigermouth Cave on Mount Leopard Head. I tricked them back from him by cunning, whereupon the spirit ganged up with some other lion spirits to give me a tremendous fight. One of them is a nine-headed lion with enormous magic powers who carried my master, Pig, the prince and his three sons to the Ninebend Twisty Cave on Mount Bamboo. When Friar Sand and I went to look for them the next day we were carried off too. He had me tied up and hit so often I lost count. Luckily I was able to make my get-away by magic, but they're still suffering there. When I questioned the local deity I found out that you were his master, Heavenly Honoured One, which is why I'm here to ask you to subdue the lion and rescue them.&#8221;</P>
<P>As soon as the Heavenly Honoured One heard this he sent his immortal officers to the lion house to call out his lionkeeper slave and question him. The lionkeeper slave was sleeping so deeply that the officers had to push and shake him before they could wake him up and drag him into the main hall. Here the Heavenly Honoured One asked him, &#8220;Where is the lion?&#8221;</P>
<P>All the slave could do was to kowtow with tears streaming down his face, pleading, &#8220;Spare me, spare me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The Great Sage Sun is here,&#8221; the Heavenly Honoured One replied, &#8220;so I won't have you beaten just yet. You must explain this instant your carelessness in letting the nine-headed lion escape.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; the lionkeeper replied, &#8220;I stole and drank a jug of wine I saw in the Sweet Dew Palace of the Great Chiliocosm. Before I realized what had happened I was dead drunk. It must have slipped its chains and got away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That wine was given me by Lord Lao Zi of the Supreme Ultimate,&#8221; the Heavenly Honoured One replied. &#8220;It's called Cyclical Nectar, and after drinking that you would have slept for three days. How many days has the lion been gone?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What the local deity said was that he went down there the year before last, which would mean two years or more,&#8221; the Great Sage said.</P>
<P>&#8220;That's right,&#8221; the Heavenly Honoured One said with a smile, &#8220;A day in the palaces of Heaven is a year in the mortal world. Get up,&#8221; he said to the lion-tamer. &#8220;I'll spare your life. Come down to the lower world with the Great Sage and me to recapture him. You immortals can all go back. None of you need come with us.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Heavenly Honoured One, the lion-keeper slave and the Great Sage all went by cloud straight to Bamboo Mountain, where the Protectors of the Four Quarters and the Centre, the Six Dings, the Six Jias and the local deity of the mountain all knelt to greet them.</P>
<P>&#8220;Has my master been harmed while you people have been protecting him?&#8221; Brother Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The evil spirit was so angry that he went to sleep,&#8221; the gods replied. &#8220;He didn't torture them any more.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That Primal Sage of mine is a true soul who has long cultivated the Way,&#8221; the Heavenly Honoured One remarked. &#8220;A single call from him will go up to the Three Sages and down to the Underworld. He wouldn't kill anyone lightly. Great Sage Sun, go to his gates, challenge him to battle and draw him outside for us to catch.&#8221;</P>
<P>As soon as Monkey heard this he sprang towards the mouth of the cave, brandishing his cudgel and shouting loudly and abusively, &#8220;Damned evil spirit, give me my people back! Damned evil spirit, give me my people back!&#8221; He shouted several times, but the old demon was fast asleep and nobody answered. Monkey lost his patience, swung his cudgel and smashed his way inside, still cursing.</P>
<P>Only then did the old demon wake up, rise to his feet and yell with great fury, &#8220;I'm coming for you!&#8221; He shook his heads and opened his jaws to pick Monkey up.</P>
<P>As Monkey turned and fled the evil spirit chased after him till they were outside the cave, shouting, &#8220;Where do you think you're going, you thieving ape?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How dare you go on behaving so dreadfully!&#8221; said Monkey with a grin from where he was standing on the top of a high cliff. &#8220;You haven't even got the sense to realize that your life's at stake. Don't you see your master's here?&#8221;</P>
<P>By the time the evil spirit reached the cliff in pursuit of Monkey the Heavenly Honoured One had said a spell and shouted, &#8220;I'm here, my little Primal Sage.&#8221; Recognizing his master, the monster gave up the struggle and lay down with all four feet on the ground, kowtowing.</P>
<P>The lionkeeper then ran over to him, took hold of his mane, and punched him hundreds of times on the neck, saying abusively, &#8220;Why did you run away, animal? You got me into terrible trouble.&#8221; The lion kept his mouths shut and said nothing, not daring to move, and the lionkeeper only stopped hitting him when his fist was tired out. When a brocade saddlecloth had been put on the animal's back the Heavenly Honoured One mounted and shouted to it to go. They then rose up on coloured clouds and went straight back to the Wonderful Crag Palace.</P>
<P>After addressing his thanks skywards the Great Sage went into the cave and freed first the prince of Yuhua, then Sanzang, then Pig, Friar Sand and the three young princes. After this they made a leisurely search of the cave and led everyone outside. Pig then fetched some dry brushwood, piled it at the front and the back, and started a fire that left the Nine-bend Twisty Cave looking like a ruined, burnt-out kiln. Monkey released all the gods, ordered the local deity to keep guard on it, and told Pig and Friar Sand to use their magic to carry the four princes back to the city while he helped the Tang Priest along. They were soon back at the city, where the princess and the officials all came out to greet them. It was now getting dark, and a vegetarian feast was provided for everyone to enjoy. The venerable elder and his disciples slept in the Gauze Pavilion once more, and the princes in the living quarters of the palace. Of that night no more need be said.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The next day the prince issued an order for another great vegetarian banquet to be laid on. Each of the officials high and low in the palace expressed his gratitude, and Monkey asked for butchers to slaughter the six lions who were still alive, skin them like the tawny lion, and prepare their meat to be eaten. The prince, who was delighted with this proposal, gave the order for them to be killed. One animal was kept for the inside and outside palace staff, one was given to the chief administrator and the other officials in the palace, and the flesh of the other five was cut into lumps weighing one or two ounces that officers distributed among the soldiers and civilians inside and outside the city wall so that they could all eat a little. Thus the people could both try the taste and overcome their fear. Every single household was most impressed.</P>
<P>By now the smiths had made the three weapons and were kowtowing to Monkey, saying, &#8220;My lord, we have finished our work.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How heavy are they?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The gold-banded cudgel weighs a thousand pounds,&#8221; the smiths replied, &#8220;and the nine-toothed rake and the demon-quelling staff each eight hundred pounds.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That'll do,&#8221; said Monkey, who then had the three princes asked to come out. As each took his weapon they said to the senior prince, &#8220;Your Royal Highness, our weapons have now been finished.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They almost cost both your father and yourselves their lives,&#8221; the senior prince replied. &#8220;Thanks to our divine teachers' powers,&#8221; the young princes said, &#8220;we were all saved and the evil spirits have been wiped out. We'll have no trouble from them in future. Now this really is a world at peace with calm seas and rivers running clear.&#8221; The four princes then rewarded the smiths and went to the Gauze Pavilion to thank the teachers.</P>
<P>Sanzang told the Great Sage and the other two to pass on some more martial skills quickly so as not to delay their journey. The three of them all swung their weapons in the palace yard as they taught the secrets one by one. Within a few days the three young princes were all skilled performers. They also mastered all the seventy-two routines of attack, retreat and fast and slow fighting. This was firstly because the princes were all thoroughly determined, and secondly because the Great Sage Sun had given them the divine strength beforehand that enabled them to lift and move the thousand-pound cudgel and the eight-hundred-pound rake and staff. There was all the difference in the world between their present skills and those they had had before, and there is a poem that goes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When they celebrated their fortune in finding divine teachers</P>
<P>They never expected their studies to alert a lion spirit.</P>
<P>With evil destroyed the country was at peace;</P>
<P>The frontier was settled as all were devoted to the one</P>
<P>Entity. Ninefold Numinosity's powers lasted through their many clashes</P>
<P>Till the Way was achieved with all-round expertise.</P>
<P>The brilliant teaching would be passed on for ever,</P>
<P>And Yuhua know eternal peace and joy.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The prince then gave another great banquet to thank the three teachers, and a huge dish of gold and silver was brought out as a reward. &#8220;Take it straight back inside,&#8221; Monkey said with a smile, &#8220;take it straight back. We're monks, and that's no use to us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We really can't take gold or silver,&#8221; put in Pig who was standing beside him, &#8220;but the lion spirits tore our clothes to ribbons. If you could give us a change of clothing that would be very kind of you.&#8221; The prince ordered his tailors to fetch some bolts of blue, red and brown brocade and make each of them a garment after the style and colours of their old ones. The three of them were delighted to accept and put on their new brocade tunics, after which they packed up the luggage and set off on their way again. Everyone inside and outside the city, whether young or old, exclaimed that they were arhats and living Buddhas come down to earth. Crowds packed the streets to the sound of drums and music, and banners flew overhead. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>From the gate of every family the incense smoke arose;</P>
<P>At every household's door coloured lanterns hung in rows.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The people only went back after seeing them for a long way along their journey. Only then did the four travelers manage to leave the city and head West. By leaving they shook off all thought and immersed their hearts in the True Achievement. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Free from thought and worry, the Buddha's land they seek,</P>
<P>Going faithfully, sincerely, towards the Vulture Peak.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you do not know how much further the journey was to be or when it was to end, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>师狮授受同归一</p>
<p>盗道缠禅静九灵</p>
</div>
<p>却说孙大圣同八戒、沙僧出城头，觌面相迎，见那伙妖精都是些杂毛狮子：黄狮精在前引领，狻猊狮、抟象狮在左，白泽狮、伏狸狮在右，猱狮、雪狮在后，中间却是一个九头狮子。那青脸儿怪执一面锦锈团花宝幢，紧挨着九头狮子，刁钻古怪儿、古怪刁钻儿打两面红旗，齐齐的都布在坎宫之地。八戒莽撞，走近前骂道：“偷宝贝的贼怪！你去那里伙这几个毛团来此怎的？”黄狮精切齿骂道：“泼狠秃厮！昨日三个敌我一个，我败回去，让你为人罢了；你怎么这般狠恶，烧了我的洞府，损了我的山场，伤了我的眷族！我和你冤仇深如大海！不要走！吃你老爷一铲！”好八戒，举钯就迎。两个才交手，还未见高低，那猱狮精轮一根铁蒺藜，雪狮精使一条三楞简，径来奔打。八戒发一声喊道：“来得好！”你看他横冲直抵，斗在一处。这壁厢，沙和尚急掣降妖杖，近前相助，又见那狻猊精、白泽精与抟象、伏狸二精，一拥齐上。这里孙大圣使金箍棒架住群精，狻猊使闷棍，白泽使铜锤，抟象使钢枪，伏狸使钺斧。那七个狮子精，这三个狠和尚，好杀：棍锤枪斧三楞简，蒺藜骨朵四明铲。七狮七器甚锋芒，围战三僧齐呐喊。大圣金箍铁棒凶，沙僧宝杖人间罕。八戒颠风骋势雄，钉钯幌亮光华惨。前遮后挡各施功，左架右迎都勇敢。城头王子助威风，擂鼓筛锣齐壮胆。投来抢去弄神通，杀得昏濛天地反”那一伙妖精，齐与大圣三人，战经半日，不觉天晚。八戒口吐粘涎，看看脚软，虚幌一钯，败下阵去，被那雪狮、猱狮二精喝道：“那里走”看打！”呆子躲闪不及，被他照脊梁上打了一简，睡在地下，只叫：“罢了！罢了！”两个精把八戒采鬃拖尾，扛将去见那九头狮子，报道：“祖爷，我等拿了一个来也。”说不了，沙僧行者也都战败。众妖精一齐赶来，被行者拔一把毫毛，嚼碎喷将去，叫声“变！”即变做百十个小行者，围围绕绕，将那白泽、狻猊、抟象、伏狸并金毛狮怪围裹在中。沙僧行者却又上前攒打。到晚，拿住狻猊、白泽，走了伏狸、抟象。金毛报知老妖，老怪见失了二狮，吩咐：“把猪八戒捆了，不可伤他性命。待他还我二狮，却将八戒与他。他若无知，坏了我二狮，即将八戒杀了对命！”当晚群妖安歇城外不题。</p>

<p>却说孙大圣把两个狮子精抬近城边，老王见了，即传令开门，差二三十个校尉，拿绳扛出门，绑了狮精，扛入城里。孙大圣收了法毛，同沙僧径至城楼上，见了唐僧。唐僧道：“这场事甚是利害呀！悟能性命，不知有无？”行者道：“没事！我们把这两个妖精拿了，他那里断不敢伤。且将二精牢拴紧缚，待明早抵换八戒也。”三个小王子对行者叩头道：“师父先前赌斗，只见一身，及后佯输而回，却怎么就有百十位师身？及至拿住妖精，近城来还是一身，此是甚么法力？”行者笑道：“我身上有八万四千毫毛，以一化十，以十化百，百千万亿之变化，皆身外身之法也。”那王子一个个顶礼，即时摆上斋来，就在城楼上吃了。各垛口上都要灯笼旗帜，梆铃锣鼓，支更传箭，放炮呐喊。</p>

<p>早又天明。老怪即唤黄狮精定计道：“汝等今日用心拿那行者、沙僧，等我暗自飞空上城，拿他那师父并那老王父子，先转九曲盘桓洞，待你得胜回报。”黄狮领计，便引猱狮、雪狮、抟象、伏狸各执兵器到城处，滚风酿雾的索战。这里行者与沙僧跳出城头，厉声骂道：“贼泼怪！快将我师弟八戒送还我，饶你性命！不然，都教你粉骨碎尸！”那妖精那容分说，一拥齐来。这大圣弟兄两个，各运机谋，挡住五个狮子。这杀比昨日又甚不同：呼呼刮地狂风恶，暗暗遮天黑雾浓。走石飞沙神鬼怕，推林倒树虎狼惊。钢枪狠狠钺斧明，棍铲铜锤太毒情。恨不得囫囵吞行者，活活泼泼擒住小沙僧。这大圣一条如意棒，卷舒收放甚精灵。沙僧那柄降妖杖，灵霄殿外有名声。今番干运神通广，西域施功扫荡精。这五个杂毛狮子精与行者、沙僧正自杀到好处，那老怪驾着黑云，径直腾至城楼上，摇一摇头，唬得那城上文武大小官员并守城人夫等，都滚下城去，被他奔入楼中，张开口把三藏与老王父子一顿噙出，复至坎宫地下，将八戒也着口噙之。原来他九个头就有九张口，一口噙着唐僧，一口噙着八戒，一口噙着老王，一口噙着大王子，一口噙着二王子，一口噙着三王子，六口噙着六人，还空了三张口，发声喊叫道：“我先去也！”这五个小狮精见他祖得胜，一个个愈展雄才。行者闻得城上人喊嚷，情知中了他计，急唤沙僧仔细；他却把臂膊上毫毛，尽皆拔下，入口嚼烂喷出，变作千百个小行者，一拥攻上，当时拖倒猱狮，活捉了雪狮，拿住了抟象狮，扛翻了伏狸狮，将黄狮打死，烘烘的嚷到州城之下，倒转走脱了青脸儿与刁钻古怪、古怪刁钻儿二怪。那城上官看见，却又开门，将绳把五个狮精又捆了，抬进城去。还未发落，只见那王妃哭哭啼啼，对行者礼拜道：“神师啊，我殿下父子并你师父，性命休矣！这孤城怎生是好？”大圣收了法毛，对王妃作礼道：“贤后莫愁，只因我拿他七个狮精，那老妖弄摄法，定将我师父与殿下父子摄去，料必无伤。待明日绝早，我兄弟二人去那山中，管情捉住老妖，还你四个王子。”那王妃一簇女眷闻得此言，都对行者下拜道：“愿求殿下父子全生，皇图坚固！”拜毕，一个个含泪还宫。</p>

<p>行者吩咐各官：“将打死那黄狮精剥了皮，六个活狮精，牢牢拴锁。取些斋饭来，我们吃了睡觉，你们都放心，保你无事。”</p>

<p>至次日，大圣领沙僧驾起祥云，不多时，到子竹节山头。按云头观看，好座高山！但见：峰排突兀，岭峻崎岖。深涧下潺湅水漱，陡崖前锦锈花香。回峦重迭，古道湾环。真是鹤来松有伴，果然云去石无依。玄猿觅果向晴晖，麋鹿寻花欢日暖。青鸾声晰呖，黄鸟语绵蛮。春来桃李争妍，夏至柳槐竞茂。秋到黄花布锦，冬交白雪飞绵。四时八节好风光，不亚瀛洲仙景象。</p>

<p>他两个正在山头上看景，忽见那青脸儿，手拿一条短棍，径跑出崖谷之间。行者喝道：“那里走！老孙来也！”唬得那小妖一翻一滚的跑下崖谷。他两个一直追来，又不见踪迹，向前又转几步，却是一座洞府，两扇花斑石门，紧紧关闭。门楟上横嵌着一块石版，楷镌了十个大字，乃是万灵竹节山九曲盘桓洞。那小妖原来跑进洞去，即把洞门闭了，到中间对老妖道：“爷爷，外面又有两个和尚来了。”老妖道：“你大王并猱狮、雪狮、抟象、伏狸可曾来？”小妖道：“不见！不见！只是两个和尚，在山峰高处眺望。我看见回头就跑，他赶将来，我却闭门来也。”老妖听说，低头不语，半晌，忽的吊下泪来，叫声：“苦啊！我黄狮孙死了！猱狮孙等又尽被和尚捉进城去矣！此恨怎生报得！”</p>

<p>八戒捆在旁边，与王父子唐僧俱攒在一处，恓恓惶惶受苦，听见老妖说声“众孙被和尚捉进城去”，暗暗喜道：“师父莫怕，殿下休愁，我师兄已得胜，捉了众妖，寻到此间救拔吾等也。”说罢，又听得老妖叫：“小的们，好生在此看守，等我出去拿那两个和尚进来，一发惩治。”你看他身无披挂，手不拈兵，大踏步走到前边，只闻得孙行者吆喝哩。他就大开了洞门，不答话，径奔行者。行者使铁棒当头支住，沙僧轮宝杖就打。那老妖把头摇一摇，左右八个头，一齐张开口，把行者、沙僧轻轻的又衔于洞内，教：“取绳索来！”那刁钻古怪、古怪刁钻与青脸儿是昨夜逃生而回者，即拿两条绳，把他二人着实捆了。老妖问道：“你这泼猴，把我那七个儿孙捉了，我今拿住你和尚四个，王子四个，也足以抵得我儿孙之命！小的们，选荆条柳棍来，且打这猴头一顿，与我黄狮孙报报冤仇！”那三个小妖，各执柳棍，专打行者。行者本是熬炼过的身体，那些些柳棍儿，只好与他拂痒，他那里做声？凭他怎么捶打，略不介意。八戒、唐僧与王子见了，一个个毛骨悚然。少时，打折了柳棍，直打到天晚，也不计其数。沙僧见打得多了，甚不过意道：“我替他打百十下罢。”老妖道：你且莫忙，明日就打到你了，一个个挨次儿打将来。”八戒着忙道：“后日就打到我老猪也！”打一会，渐渐的天昏了，老妖叫：“小的们且住，点起灯火来，你们吃些饮食，让我到锦云窝略睡睡去。汝三人都是遭过害的，却用心看守，待明早再打。”三个小妖移过灯来，拿柳棍又打行者脑盖，就象敲梆子一般，剔剔托，托托剔，紧几下，慢几下。夜将深了，却都盹睡。</p>

<p>行者就使个遁法，将身一小，脱出绳来，抖一抖毫毛，整束了衣服，耳朵内取出棒来，幌一幌，有吊桶粗细，二丈长短，朝着三个小妖道：“你这孽畜，把你老爷就打了许多棍子！老爷还只照旧，老爷也把这棍子略桠你桠，看道如何！”把三个小妖轻轻一桠，就桠做三个肉饼，却又剔亮了灯，解放沙僧。八戒捆急了，忍不住大声叫道：“哥哥！我的手脚都捆肿了，倒不来先解放我！”这呆子喊了一声，却早惊动老妖。老妖一毂辘爬起来道：“是谁人解放？”那行者听见，一口吹息灯，也顾不得沙僧等众，使铁棒，打破几重门走了。那老妖到中堂里叫：“小的们，怎么没了灯光？只莫走了人也？”叫一声，没人答应；又叫一声，又没人答应。及取灯火来看时，只见地下血淋淋的三块肉饼，老王父子及唐僧、八戒俱在，只不见了行者、沙僧。点着火，前后赶看，忽见沙僧还背贴在廊下站哩，被他一把拿住捽倒，照旧捆了。又找寻行者，但见几层门尽皆破损，情知是行者打破走了，也不去追赶，将破门补的补，遮的遮，固守家业不题。</p>

<p>却说孙大圣出了那九曲盘桓洞，跨祥云径转玉华州，但见那城头上各厢的土地神祇与城隍之神迎空拜接。行者道：“汝等怎么今夜才见？”城隍道：“小神等知大圣下降玉华州，因有贤王款留，故不敢见。今知王等遇怪，大圣降魔，特来叩接。”行者正在嗔怪处，又见金头揭谛、六甲六丁神将，押着一尊土地，跪在面前道：“大圣，吾等捉得这个地里鬼来也。”行者喝道：</p>

<p>“汝等不在竹节出护我师父，却怎么嚷到这里？”丁甲神道：“大圣，那妖精自你逃时，复捉住卷帘大将，依然捆了。我等见他法力甚大，却将竹节山土地押解至此。他知那妖精的根由，乞大圣问他一问，便好处治，以救圣僧贤王之苦。”行者听言甚喜，那土地战兢兢叩头道：“那老妖前年下降竹节山。那九曲盘桓洞原是六狮之窝，那六个狮子，自得老妖至此，就都拜为祖翁。</p>

<p>祖翁乃是个九头狮子，号为九灵元圣。若得他灭，须去到东极妙岩宫，请他主人公来，方可收伏。他人莫想擒也。”行者闻言，思忆半晌道：“东极妙岩宫，是太乙救苦天尊啊。他坐下正是个九头狮子。这等说——”便教：“揭谛、金甲，还同土地回去，暗中护祐师父、师弟并州王父子。本处城隍守护城池，走出去来。”众神各各遵守去讫。</p>

<p>这大圣纵筋斗云，连夜前行。约有寅时分，到了东天门外，正撞着广目天王与天丁、力士一行仪从。众皆停住，拱手迎道：</p>

<p>“大圣何往？”行者对众礼毕，道：“前去妙岩宫走走。”天王道：</p>

<p>“西天路不走，却又东天来做甚？”行者道：“因到玉华州，蒙州王相款，遣三子拜我等弟兄为师，习学武艺，不期遇着一伙狮怪。今访得妙岩宫太乙救苦天尊乃怪之主人公也，欲请他为我降怪救师。”天王道：“那厢因你欲为人师，所以惹出这一窝狮子来也。”行者笑道：“正为此！正为此！”众天丁、力士一个个拱手，让道而行。大圣进了东天门，不多时，到妙岩宫前，但见：彩云重迭，紫气茏葱。瓦漾金波焰，门排玉兽崇。花盈双阙红霞绕，日映骞林翠雾笼。果然是万真环拱，千圣兴隆。殿阁层层锦，窗轩处处通。苍龙盘护神光蔼，黄道光辉瑞气浓。这的是青华长乐界，东极妙岩宫。那宫门里立着一个穿霓帔的仙童，忽见孙大圣，即入宫报道：“爷爷，外面是闹天宫的齐天大圣来了。”太乙救苦天尊听得，即唤侍卫众仙迎接。迎至宫中，只见天尊高坐九色莲花座上，百亿瑞光之中，见了行者，下座来相见。行者朝上施礼，天尊答礼道：“大圣，这几年不见，前闻得你弃道归佛，保唐僧西天取经，想是功行完了？”行者道：“功行未完，却也将近。但如今因保唐僧到玉华州，蒙王子遣三子拜老孙等为师，习学武艺，把我们三件神兵照样打造，不期夜间被贼偷去。及天明寻找，原是城北豹头山虎口洞一个金毛狮子成精盗去。老孙用计取出，那精就伙了若干狮精与老孙大闹。内有一个九头狮子，神通广大，将我师父与八戒并王父子四人都衔去，到一竹节山九曲盘桓洞。次日，老孙与沙僧跟寻，亦被衔去。老孙被他捆打无数，幸而弄法走了，他们正在彼处受罪。问及当坊土地，始知天尊是他主人，特来奉请收降解救。”天尊闻言，即令仙将到狮子房唤出狮奴来问？”那狮奴熟睡，被众将推摇方醒，揪至中厅来见。天尊问道：“狮兽何在？”那奴儿垂泪叩头，只教：“饶命！饶命！”天尊道：“孙大圣在此，且不打你。你快说为何不谨，走了九头狮子。”狮奴道：“爷爷，我前日在大千甘露殿中见一瓶酒，不知偷去吃了，不觉沉醉睡着，失于拴锁，是以走了。”天尊道：“那酒是太上老君送的，唤做轮回琼液，你吃了该醉三日不醒。那狮兽今走几日了？”大圣道：“据土地说，他前年下降，到今二三年矣。”天尊笑道：“是了！是了！天宫里一日，在凡世就是一年。”叫狮奴道：“你且起来，饶你死罪，跟我与大圣下方去收他来。汝众仙都回去，不用跟随。”</p>

<p>天尊遂与大圣、狮奴，踏云径至竹节山，只见那五方揭谛、六丁六甲、本山土地都来跪接。行者道：“汝等护祐，可曾伤着我师？”众神道：“妖精着了恼睡了，更不曾动甚刑罚。”天尊道：</p>

<p>“我那元圣儿也是一个久修得道的真灵：他喊一声，上通三圣，下彻九泉，等闲也便不伤生。孙大圣，你去他门首索战，引他出来，我好收之。”行者听言，果掣棒跳近洞口，高骂道：“泼妖精，还我人来也！泼妖精，还我人来也！”连叫了数声，那老妖睡着了，无人答应。行者性急起来，轮铁棒，往里打进，口中不住的喊骂。那老妖方才惊醒，心中大怒，爬起来，喝一声“赶战！”摇摇头，便张口来衔。行者回头跳出。妖精赶到外边，骂道：“贼猴！那里走！”行者立在高崖上笑道：“你还敢这等大胆无礼！你死活也不知哩！这不是你老爷主公在此？”那妖精赶到崖前，早被天尊念声咒语，喝道：“元圣儿！我来了！”那妖认得是主人，不敢展挣，四只脚伏之于地，只是磕头。旁边跑过狮奴儿，一把挝住项毛，用拳着项上打彀百十，口里骂道：“你这畜生，如何偷走，教我受罪！”那狮兽合口无言，不敢摇动。狮奴儿打得手困，方才住了，即将锦韂安在他身上，天尊骑了，喝声教走。他就纵声驾起彩云，径转妙岩宫去。</p>

<p>大圣望空称谢了，却入洞中，先解玉华王，次解唐三藏，次又解了八戒、沙僧并三王子，共搜他洞里物件，逍逍停停，将众领出门外。八戒就取了若干枯柴，前后堆上，放起火来，把一个九曲盘桓洞，烧做了乌焦破瓦窑！大圣又发放了众神，还教土地在此镇守，却令八戒、沙僧，各各使法，把王父子背驮回州，他搀着唐僧。不多时，到了州城，天色渐晚，当有妃后官员，都来接见了。摆上斋筵，共坐享之。长老师徒还在暴纱亭安歇，王子们入宫各寝。一宵无话。</p>

<p>次日，王又传旨，大开素宴，合府大小官员，一一谢恩。行者又叫屠子来，把那六个活狮子杀了，共那黄狮子都剥了皮，将肉安排将来受用。殿下十分欢喜，即命杀了，把一个留在本府内外人用，一个与王府长史等官分用，把五个都剁做一二两重的块子，差校尉散给州城内外军民人等，各吃些须：一则尝尝滋味，二则押押惊恐。那些家家户户，无不瞻仰。又见那铁匠人等造成了三般兵器，对行者磕头道：“爷爷，小的们工都完了。”问道：“各重多少斤两？”铁匠道：“金箍棒有千斤，九齿钯与降妖杖各有八百斤。”行者道：“也罢了。”叫请三位王子出来，各人执兵器。三子对老王道：“父王，今日兵器完矣。”老王道：“为此兵器，几乎伤了我父子之命。”小王子道：“幸蒙神师施法，救出我等，却又扫荡妖邪，除了后患，诚所谓海晏河清，太平之世界也！”当时老王父子赏劳了匠作，又至暴纱亭拜谢了师恩。</p>

<p>三藏又教大圣等快传武艺，莫误行程。他三人就各轮兵器，在王府院中，一一传授。不数日，那三个王子尽皆操演精熟，其余攻退之方，紧慢之法，各有七十二到解数，无不知之。</p>

<p>一则那诸王子心坚，二则亏孙大圣先授了神力，此所以那千斤之棒，八百斤之钯杖，俱能举能运，较之初时自家弄的武艺，真天渊也！有诗为证，诗曰：缘因善庆遇神师，习武何期动怪狮。</p>

<p>扫荡群邪安社稷，皈依一体定边夷。九灵数合元阳理，四面精通道果之。授受心明遗万古，玉华永乐太平时。那王子又大开筵宴，谢了师教，又取出一大盘金银，用答微情。行者笑道：“快拿进去！快拿进去！我们出家人，要他何用？”八戒在旁道：“金银实不敢受，奈何我这件衣服被那些狮子精扯拉破了，但与我们换件衣服，足为爱也。”那王子随命针工，照依色样，取青锦、红锦、茶褐锦各数匹，与三位各做了一件。三人欣然领受，各穿了锦布直裰，收拾了行装起程，只见那城里城外，若大若小，无一人不称是罗汉临凡，活佛下界，鼓乐之声，旌旗之色，盈街塞道。正是家家户外焚香火，处处门前献彩灯，来至许远才回，他四众方得离城西去。这一去顿脱群思，潜心正果。才是：无虑无忧来佛界，诚心诚意上雷音。毕竟不知到灵山还有几多路程，何时行满，且听下回分解。
