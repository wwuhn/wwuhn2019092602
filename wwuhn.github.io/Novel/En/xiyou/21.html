<P>The Tang Priest Meets Trouble on the Yellow Wind Ridge</P>
<P>Pig Wins Mastery Halfway up the Mountain</P>	
	</div>




<P>The Dharma is born in the mind,</P>
<P>And in turn is destroyed by the mind.</P>
<P>Who do life and death come from?</P>
<P>Decide for yourself.</P>
<P>If it is all from your own mind,</P>
<P>Why do you need others to tell you?</P>
<P>All you need to do is work hard,</P>
<P>Squeezing blood out of iron.</P>
<P>Thread a silken rope through your nose.</P>
<P>And fasten yourself to emptiness.</P>
<P>Tie it to the tree of non-action,</P>
<P>To prevent it from collapsing.</P>
<P>Don't acknowledge bandits as your sons,</P>
<P>Or you will forget the Dharma and the mind.</P>
<P>Do not allow yourself to be deceived by others&#8212;</P>
<P>Smash them first with a punch.</P>
<P>When the mind appears it is non-existent,</P>
<P>When the Dharma appears, it ceases.</P>
<P>When the boy and the ox both disappear,</P>
<P>The blue sky is absolutely clear.</P>
<P>All is as round as an autumn moon,</P>
<P>And this and that can no longer be distinguished.</P>


<P>This<I> gatha</I> refers to how the Patriarch Xuanzang came to awareness and understanding of the<I> Heart Sutra</I> and thus opened the gate. As that venerable elder recited it constantly, a ray of miraculous light penetrated through to him.</P>
<P>Eating and sleeping in the open, the three of them traveled on, and before long the heat of summer was upon them.</P>


<P>The blossoms were over, the butterflies' passion spent.</P>
<P>High in the trees the cicadas screeched.</P>
<P>Wild silkworms spun cocoons amid the pomegranate blossom,</P>
<P>As lotus flowers opened in the pool.</P>


<P>As they were travelling along one evening they saw a cottage beside the road. &#8220;Look,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;the sun is setting behind the Western hills, hiding its mirror of fire, and the moon is rising from the Eastern sea to show its wheel of ice. How lucky that there is a family living by our path. Let's spend the night here and set off again tomorrow morning.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Well said,&#8221; put in Pig. &#8220;I'm a bit hungry, and if we begged some food from that house I'd have more strength for carrying the luggage.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Homesick ghost,&#8221; remarked Brother Monkey, &#8220;you've only been away from home for a few days, but you're already regretting that you came.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Elder brother,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;I can't live on wind and mist like you. You couldn't realize how the hunger's been gnawing at my stomach all these days I've been following our master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Pig,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;if your heart is still at home, you are not intended for a religious life, and you'd better go back.&#8221;</P>
<P>The oafish Pig fell to his knees and pleaded, &#8220;Master, please don't pay any attention to what my elder brother says: it's an insult. He says I wish I hadn't come, but in fact I've had no regrets at all. I may be stupid, but I'm straight. I just said that I was hungry and want to beg for some food, and he starts calling me a homesick ghost. But the Bodhisattva told me about the prohibitions, and you have been so kind to me; so I really do want to serve you on your journey to the West. I'll never have any regrets, I swear I won't. This is what they call 'cultivating conduct the hard way'. What right have you to say I shouldn't be a monk?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well then,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;up you get.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot leapt up, and picked up the carrying-pole, chattering incessantly. Then he pressed grimly on. Before long they reached the roadside house, where Sanzang dismounted as Monkey took the bridle and Pig put down his burden. They all stood in a green shade. Sanzang took his nine-ringed monastic staff, straightened his rattan hat, and hurried to the gates, where he saw an old man lying back on a bamboo bed mumbling Buddhist scriptures to himself.</P>
<P>Not wanting to shout loudly, Sanzang said in a quiet voice, &#8220;Greetings, benefactor.&#8221;</P>
<P>The old man sprang to his feet, straightened his clothes, and came out through the gate to return his greeting. &#8220;Excuse my discourtesy, venerable sir,&#8221; he said, going on to ask, &#8220;Where are you from, and why have you come to my humble abode?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am a monk from the Great Tang in the East,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;and I bear an imperial command to worship the Buddha in the Thunder Monastery and ask for the scriptures. As we find ourselves in this district at nightfall, I would be enormously obliged if you could allow us to spend the night in your mansion.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You'll never get there,&#8221; said the old man with a wave of his hand and a shake of his head. &#8220;It's impossible to get scriptures from the Western Heaven. If you want scriptures you'd better go to the Eastern Heaven.&#8221; Sanzang said nothing as he asked himself why the old man was telling them to go East when the Bodhisattva had instructed them to go West. How could the scriptures be obtained in the East, he asked himself. In his embarrassment he was at loss for words, so he made no reply.</P>
<P>Monkey, who was rough by his very nature, could not stand for this, so he went up to the old man and shouted, &#8220;Old fellow, you may be very ancient but you're a complete fool. We holy men from far away come to ask for lodging, but all you can do is to try to put us off. If your house is too poky and there isn't room for us to sleep in it, we'll sit under the trees all night and won't trouble you any further.&#8221; The old man grabbed hold of Sanzang and said, &#8220;Master, you didn't warn me that you had a disciple with such a twisted face and no chin to speak of, looking like a thunder god with his red eyes. You shouldn't let a demon of sickness like him alarm and offend a person of my age.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're completely lacking in judgement, old man,&#8221; Monkey said with a laugh. &#8220;Those pretty boys may look good but, as they say, they don't taste good. I may be little but I'm tough, and it's all muscle under my skin.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I suppose you must have some powers,&#8221; the old man remarked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Without wishing to boast,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;I can get by.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where is your home,&#8221; the old man asked, &#8220;and why did you shave your head and become a monk?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My ancestral home is the Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit in the land of Aolai which lies across the sea to the East of the Eastern Continent of Superior Body. I learned how to be an evil monster from childhood, and my name was Wukong, or Awakened to Emptiness. I used my abilities to make myself the Great Sage Equaling Heaven, but as I declined heavenly office and raised a great rebellion against the Heavenly Palace, I brought a disaster down on my own head. My sufferings are now over. I've turned to the Buddhist faith and am seeking a good reward for the future by escorting His Tang Excellency, my master, on his journey to the Western Heaven to visit the Buddha. I'm not afraid of high mountains with precipitous paths, or of broad rivers with huge waves. I can catch monsters and subdue demons, capture tigers or dragons, walk in the sky, or burrow into the earth. As long as your mansion has a few broken bricks and tiles, a singing pot and an open door, I'll be able to rest here contented.&#8221;</P>
<P>After hearing this speech, the old man said with a chuckle, &#8220;So you're a monk with the gift of the gab who suddenly switched destinies.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're the gabber, my child,&#8221; retorted Monkey. &#8220;I'm too tired after the strain of the journey with my master to be able to talk.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's as well you are,&#8221; the old man replied, &#8220;or you'd be talking me to death. If you have all these powers you'll be able to reach the West. How many of you are there? Please come into my cottage for the night.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Thank you very much for not losing your temper with him,&#8221; Sanzang said. &#8220;There are three of us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where is the third?&#8221; the old man asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your eyes are very dim, old man,&#8221; said Monkey, pointing as he continued, &#8220;Can't you see him standing in the shade there?&#8221;</P>
<P>When the old man, whose eyes were indeed dim, looked carefully and saw Pig's face he was so terrified that he ran into the house shouting, &#8220;Shut the gates, shut the gates, there's a monster here.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey ran after him and grabbed him. &#8220;Don't be afraid, old fellow,&#8221; he said, &#8220;he's not an evil monster, he's a fellow-disciple of mine.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well then,&#8221; replied the old man, who was trembling all over, &#8220;but what a hideous creature to be a monk.&#8221;</P>
<P>As the old man was talking to the three monks in front of the gates, two young men appeared at the Southern end of the farm bringing an old woman and three or four children back from transplanting rice-seedlings, for which reason their clothes were tucked up and their feet were bare.</P>
<P>When they saw the white horse and the carrying pole with luggage and heard the shouting at the gates of their home, they did not know what was up, so they rushed forward and asked, &#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; Pig turned round, flapped his ears, and thrust his snout at them, at which they all collapsed in terror or fled.</P>
<P>In the confusion Sanzang kept calling out, &#8220;Don't be afraid, don't be afraid, we are good men, we are monks going to fetch the scriptures.&#8221; The old man then came out again, and helped the old woman to her feet.</P>
<P>&#8220;Up you get, wife,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there's no call for panic. This holy father is from the Tang court, and although his disciples are a bit ugly, their hearts are in the right place. Please take the youngsters inside.&#8221; The old woman clung to the old man while the two young men took the children inside.</P>
<P>As he sat on a bamboo chair in the gatehouse, Sanzang said indignantly, &#8220;Disciples, the pair of you are ugly to look at, and your language is too coarse. You gave that whole family a terrible fright, and got me into trouble.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I tell you truthfully, master,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;that I've grown better-looking since I've been following you. When I lived in Gao Village I looked so awful that I often used to scare twenty or thirty people to death by making a face and waggling my ears.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't exaggerate, stupid,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile, &#8220;and tidy that ugly mug of yours up a bit.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What nonsense you're talking, Monkey,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;He was born that way, so how can you expect him to tidy his face up?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He could stick his rake of a snout into his chest, and not bring it out; and he could lay those fan-shaped ears down behind his head and not waggle them. That would tidy his appearance up.&#8221; Pig then tucked his snout away and laid his ears back, and stood beside Sanzang with his head bowed. Brother Monkey took the luggage inside and tethered the white horse to a post.</P>
<P>The old man came out again with a young man who was carrying a tray with three cups of tea on it, and when it had been drunk he gave instructions for a vegetarian meal to be prepared. The young man then brought out an old, dented, and unlacquered table, as well as a pair of benches with chipped tops and broken legs, which he put in a cool spot before asking the three of them to sit down. Sanzang then asked the old man his surname, and was told, &#8220;Your humble servant's surname is Wang.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How many descendants have you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Two sons and three grandchildren.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Congratulations, congratulations,&#8221; said Sanzang; then he asked the old man how old he was.</P>
<P>&#8220;I have lived in my stupidity to sixty-one.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Splendid, splendid, you have begun a new cycle,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;Benefactor,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;why did you say at first that it would be impossible to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There is no problem about actually getting the scriptures,&#8221; the old man replied, &#8220;it's just that the journey will be very difficult. Only some twelve miles to the West of here is a mountain called the three-hundred mile Yellow Wind Ridge, and it's full of evil monsters. That's why I said it would be impossible to get the scriptures. But as this younger gentleman says he has so many magic powers, you will be able to get there.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Certainly, certainly,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;With me, my master and my fellow-disciple, no devils, however fierce, will dare to provoke us.&#8221;</P>
<P>As he spoke the youth came in with food, which he put on the table with the words, &#8220;Please eat.&#8221; Sanzang put his hands together and started to recite the grace. By then Pig had already swallowed a bowlful, and the moron finished three more before the short prayer was over.</P>
<P>&#8220;What a chaff-guzzler,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;We do seem to have run into a hungry ghost.&#8221;</P>
<P>Old Wang, however, found the speed at which Pig ate very amusing, and said, &#8220;This reverend gentleman must be very hungry. Give him more rice at once.&#8221; The stupid creature indeed had a large stomach. Look at him, keeping his head down as he devours at least a dozen bowls. Sanzang and Monkey had not been able to finish two bowls, but the idiot would not stop and was still eating. &#8220;As this is far from being haute cuisine, I cannot press you too hard, but please take another mouthful.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We have eaten enough,&#8221; said Sanzang and Monkey; but Pig said, &#8220;What are you going on about, old fellow? Who's been telling your fortune? Is that why you're going on about quizzing? Anyhow, as long as there's rice, give me some more.&#8221; In a single meal the idiot ate all the rice in the house, and still said that he was only half-full. Then the table was cleared away, bamboo beds were set out for them in the gatehouse, and they went to sleep.</P>
<P>At dawn the next morning Monkey went to saddle the horse while Pig packed the luggage. Old Wang told his wife to prepare some pastries and hot water for then, after which the three of them thanked him and said good-bye. &#8220;If anything goes wrong on your journey,&#8221; the old man said, &#8220;you must come to our place.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be so discouraging, old fellow,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;We're dedicated, and there's no turning back for us.&#8221;</P>
<P>With that they whipped the horse, picked up the carrying-pole, and headed West.</P>
<P>Alas! On their journey there was no good path to the West, and there were undoubtedly demons and great disasters in store for them. Before they had been going for half a day, they reached the mountain. It was most precipitous. Sanzang rode as far as the edge of a cliff, then dismounted to have a look.</P>


<P>High was the mountain,</P>
<P>Craggy the ridge;</P>
<P>Steep the cliffs,</P>
<P>Deep the valleys.</P>
<P>Springs could be heard,</P>
<P>And sweet smelt the flowers.</P>
<P>Was that mountain high?</P>
<P>Its summit touched the azure heavens.</P>
<P>Were the gorges deep?</P>
<P>At their bottom you could see the Underworld.</P>
<P>In front of the mountain</P>
<P>Were rolling white clouds,</P>
<P>And towering crags.</P>
<P>There were no end of myriad-fathom, soul-snatching cliffs,</P>
<P>In which were twisting caves for dragons,</P>
<P>Caves full of stalactites dripping with water.</P>
<P>He saw deer with branching antlers,</P>
<P>And river-deer gazing with fixed stare,</P>
<P>Coiled, red-scaled pythons,</P>
<P>And mischievous, white-faced apes.</P>
<P>At evening tigers climbed the hills to find their dens;</P>
<P>Dragons emerged from the waves at dawn,</P>
<P>To enter their caves with thunderous roars.</P>
<P>Birds flying in the grass</P>
<P>Rose in a flurry;</P>
<P>Beasts walking in the woods</P>
<P>Hurried helter-skelter.</P>
<P>Suddenly a pack of wolves ran past,</P>
<P>Making the heart pound hard with fear.</P>
<P>This is a place where caves are linked with caves,</P>
<P>And mountains stand with mountains.</P>
<P>The green of the peak made it like ten thousand feet of jade,</P>
<P>As a myriad clouds were piled above it like a cover of bluish gauze.</P>


<P>While Sanzang urged his silvery steed slowly forward, Monkey strolled ahead on his cloud and Pig ambled along with the carrying-pole. As they looked at the mountain they heard a whirlwind blowing up, and Sanzang was alarmed.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there's a whirlwind coming.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What's there to be afraid of about a wind?&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;It's only weather, after all, and nothing to be scared of.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But this is a very evil wind, not like a natural wind at all,&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you tell?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Just look at it,&#8221; said Sanzang:</P>


<P>&#8220;Mighty and majestic it howls and roars,</P>
<P>Coming out of the distant heavens.</P>
<P>As it crosses the ridge the trees moan,</P>
<P>The trunks bend when it enters the wood.</P>


<P>&#8220;The willow on the bank is shaken to its roots,</P>
<P>And flowers and leaves go swirling round the garden.</P>
<P>On the fishing boats gathering in nets, they pull hard on the cables;</P>
<P>Ships lower their sails, and all cast anchor.</P>


<P>&#8220;The traveler loses his way in mid-journey,</P>
<P>The woodcutter in the hills cannot carry his load.</P>
<P>The monkeys scatter in the orchards of fairy fruit,</P>
<P>The deer flee from the clumps of rare flowers.</P>


<P>&#8220;Locust trees and cedars collapse before the cliff,</P>
<P>While pine and bamboo in the valley are stripped of leaves.</P>
<P>There are stinging blasts of dirt and sand,</P>
<P>And waves boil on rivers and seas.&#8221;</P>


<P>Pig went up to Monkey and grabbed hold of him. &#8220;Brother,&#8221; he said, &#8220;this is a terrific storm. Let's take shelter.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're useless, brother,&#8221; replied Monkey with a mocking laugh. &#8220;If a big wind makes you want to hide, what are you going to do when you meet an evil spirit?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Elder brother, have you never heard the saying, 'Avoid a pretty girl as you would an enemy, avoid a wind as you would an arrow?'&#8220; Pig replied. &#8220;There's no reason why we shouldn't take shelter.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop talking, will you, while I get a hold on that wind and take a sniff at it,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;You're talking through your hat again,&#8221; said Pig with a grin. &#8220;As if you could get a hold on a wind. Besides, even if you did, your hand would go through it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What you don't know, brother, is that I have a magic way of catching winds,&#8221; Monkey replied. Letting the head of the wind pass, the splendid Monkey grabbed the tail and sniffed at it. It had rather a foul stench. &#8220;It certainly isn't a good wind,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;It smells like either a tiger wind or a monster wind. There's definitely something suspicious about it.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before the words were out of his mouth, a ferocious striped tiger leapt out at the foot of the slope, slashing with its tail and rushing towards them. Sanzang was so scared that he could no longer keep his seat in his carved saddle, but fell headfirst off his white horse and lay sprawled in a witless heap beside the path.</P>
<P>Pig threw down the luggage, grabbed his rake and, not letting Monkey move forward, roared, &#8220;Animal, where d'you think you're going?&#8221; He went straight after it and smote it on the head. The tiger stood up on its hind legs, and with a swing of its front left claws ripped at its own chest. There was a tearing noise as its skin all came off, and then the creature stood beside the path. Just see how hideous was:</P>


<P>A gory, skinned body,</P>
<P>Round, red legs and feet.</P>
<P>Fiery, matted hair,</P>
<P>And straight, bristling eyebrows.</P>


<P>Four sinister steely white fangs,</P>
<P>A pair of glittering golden eyes.</P>
<P>With soaring spirits it gave a mighty roar,</P>
<P>A mighty and majestic shout.</P>


<P>&#8220;Not so fast,&#8221; it yelled, &#8220;not so fast. I am none other than the Commander of the Vanguard for the Great Yellow Wind King. I bear His Majesty's strictest command to patrol the mountain and catch a few common mortals as tidbits for him to nibble with his wine. Where are you from, monk, and how dare you wound me with that weapon of yours?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll get you, you beast,&#8221; replied Pig abusively. &#8220;You don't seem to realize that I'm not just any old passing traveler: I'm a disciple of Sanzang, the younger brother of the Tang Emperor of the East, who has been sent by the Emperor to visit the Buddha in the Western Heaven and ask for the scriptures. If you clear off, stop blocking our path, and don't frighten my master any more, I'll spare your life. But if you go on raging about like that, there'll be no mercy for you.&#8221;</P>
<P>Not bothering to argue, the evil spirit rushed at Pig, feinted, and clawed at his face. Pig dodged nimbly and swung his rake at the monster, who turned and fled as he was unarmed. With Pig at his heels he made for the bottom of the slope and produced two bronze swords from the tangled undergrowth there; then, brandishing them, he turned to face Pig. The two of them battled away at the foot of the hill, lunging and hitting at each other. Monkey, who was helping the Tang Priest to sit up, said, &#8220;Don't be afraid, master. You sit here while I help Pig to defeat that monster, then we can be on our way.&#8221; Sanzang, who had managed to sit up, was shaking all over and intoning the<I> Heart Sutra.</I></P>
<P>Monkey grabbed his cudgel and shouted, &#8220;Get it.&#8221; Pig made a tremendous effort, and the monster fled from the scene of battle. &#8220;Don't let him get away,&#8221; yelled Monkey, &#8220;you must catch it.&#8221; The pair of them chased the monster down the mountain, waving the rake and the cudgel. The monster was so hard-pressed that it did a &#8220;golden cicada shedding its skin&#8221; trick. It reverted to its real form&#8212;a ferocious tiger&#8212;with a somersault, but Monkey and Pig would still not let it get away, and were hot on its heels, determined to destroy it. When the monster saw how close they were, it ripped at its chest and tore off its skin again, then laid it over a rock that was shaped like a crouching tiger. Then it abandoned its real body, turned into a hurricane, and went straight back to the path, where it noticed Sanzang reciting the<I> Heart Sutra.</I> Sanzang was grabbed by the monster and carried away on the wind. Poor Sanzang:</P>


<P>The Monk of the River was fated to suffer much;</P>
<P>In the faith of Nirvana it is hard to win merit.</P>


<P>Carrying the Tang Priest to the mouth of the cave, the monster stilled the hurricane and said to the gatekeepers, &#8220;Report to His Majesty at once that the Tiger of the Vanguard has caught a monk and is awaiting further instructions outside the gates.&#8221; He was then admitted on the orders of the chieftain. With his two bronze swords stuck in his belt and holding the Tang Priest in both hands, he went forward and genuflected before the chieftain. &#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; he said, &#8220;your humble underling was patrolling the mountain as ordered when suddenly I met a monk. He is the Patriarch Sanzang, the younger brother of His Majesty the Great Tang Emperor, and he was going to the West to visit the Buddha and ask for the scriptures. I have captured him and now offer him as a dish for your table.&#8221;</P>
<P>The chieftain was astonished at the news. &#8220;I've heard tell of the Patriarch Sanzang, the holy priest sent by the Great Tang Emperor to fetch the scriptures. He has a disciple called Brother Monkey whose magical powers are tremendous and whose cunning is considerable. However did you manage to catch him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He has two disciples. The first one to come at me was a fellow with a long nose and big ears who wields a nine-pronged rake, and the second one has a gold-banded iron cudgel and fiery eyes with golden pupils. When the pair of them were after me and about to attack, I used a 'golden cicada shedding its skin' trick to make my getaway, then I caught this monk to offer to Your Majesty as a snack.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He's not to be eaten yet,&#8221; the chieftain said.</P>
<P>&#8220;You must be off your food, Your Majesty, if you won't eat what's put before you,&#8221; said the Tiger of the Vanguard.</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't get my point,&#8221; the chieftain replied. &#8220;It's not eating him that worries me, but the thought that those two disciples of his may come here to make trouble, which would be dangerous. Tie him to the wind-settling stake in the garden at the back, and leave him there for a few days till we're sure his disciples won't be coming to make trouble for us. This way he'll be nice and clean, and we can do what we like with him without any arguments. Whether we have him boiled, steamed, fried or scrambled, we can eat him at our leisure.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty's plans are most far-sighted, and you are quite right,&#8221; said the Tiger of the Vanguard, who then ordered his underlings to take Sanzang away.</P>
<P>Seven or eight of them crowded forward to tie up Sanzang and take him away; they were like hawks seizing bramblings as they bound him tightly. Then did the unfortunate Monk of the River long for Brother Monkey; the holy priest in his troubles wished Pig would come.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciples,&#8221; he called out, &#8220;I don't know on what mountain you are catching monsters, or where you're subduing evil spirits, but I've met with disaster and been captured by a demon. Alas, when will I ever see you again? If you come soon, you can save my life, but if you are too long about it I will be finished.&#8221; His tears poured down like rain as he moaned and sighed.</P>
<P>As Monkey and Pig chased the tiger down the mountain side they saw that it had reached the bottom and was crouching at the foot of the cliff. Monkey raised his cudgel and brought it down as hard as he could, thus hurting his own hands. Pig took another swipe at the beast with his rake, which made its prongs splay apart. The Tiger turned out to be only a tiger skin spread over a rock shaped like crouching tiger.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is terrible,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;he's tricked us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The trick is called 'the golden cicada shedding its skin'. He put his tiger-skin over this rock and got away. We'd better go back and see that our master comes to no harm.&#8221; The two of them rushed back to find that Sanzang had disappeared. &#8220;Whatever shall we do?&#8221; cried Monkey in a voice as loud as thunder. &#8220;It's caught our master.&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig led the horse over and said through his tears, &#8220;Heaven help us. Wherever shall we look for him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't cry,&#8221; said Monkey, raising his head, &#8220;don't cry. If you cry you'll dampen our spirits. I'm convinced he must be somewhere on this mountain. We must start searching for him.&#8221;</P>
<P>The two of them hurried deep into the mountain, going through passes and crossing ridges, and after they had been going for a long time they saw a cave palace at the foot of a rock-face. They stopped to gaze at it, and saw an awe-inspiring sight:</P>


<P>Screened by many a jagged peak,</P>
<P>With ancient paths winding around;</P>
<P>Green pines merged with bluish bamboo;</P>
<P>The softness of willows and<I> wutong</I> trees.</P>
<P>Odd boulders stood in pairs before the cliff,</P>
<P>While birds made couples hidden in the woods.</P>
<P>The water in the gully splashed against the rock-wall,</P>
<P>As the spring waters trickled over the sandbank.</P>
<P>Under the billowing clouds,</P>
<P>Rare herbs grew lush.</P>
<P>Fox spirits and crafty hares darted around;</P>
<P>Horned deer and river-deer fought for mastery.</P>
<P>Ancient creepers hung across the rocks,</P>
<P>And a thousand-year cypress was suspended in a chasm.</P>
<P>In pinnacled majesty it vied with Mount Hua;</P>
<P>The flowers and birdsong rivaled Tiantai Peak.</P>


<P>&#8220;Worthy brother,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;put our baggage in the wind-storing cave, let the horse out to pasture, and lie low while I go to the gates of that place and fight it out with them. I must catch that evil spirit before I can rescue our master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no need to give me instructions,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;Go at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey straightened his tunic, tightened his tiger-skin kilt, and went straight to the gate with his cudgel in his hands. Above the gate he saw YELLOW WIND CAVE OF THE YELLOW WIND RIDGE written in large letters. Taking a firm stance and brandishing the club he shouted, &#8220;Evil monsters, send my master out if you don't want this den of yours turned upside-down and your home trampled flat.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the junior fiends heard this they were terrified, and they ran trembling inside to announce, &#8220;Your Majesty, a disaster.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked the Yellow Wind Monster who was sitting inside.</P>
<P>&#8220;There's a thunder-voiced, hairy-faced monk outside with a great thick iron cudgel in his hands, and he wants his master back,&#8221; they said.</P>
<P>The alarmed chieftain sent for the Tiger of the Vanguard and said to him, &#8220;When I sent you to patrol the mountain you were only supposed to catch mountain oxen, wild boar, deer, and goats. Why on earth did you bring that Tang Priest here? It's provoked his disciple into coming to make trouble. What are we to do?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There is no need for Your Majesty to worry,&#8221; the Tiger replied. &#8220;Your incompetent underling will take fifty junior officers out with me and bring back that Brother Monkey as a second course for the meal.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Apart from the higher and lower ranking commanders, we have about six hundred junior officers here,&#8221; said the chieftain. &#8220;Take as many of them as you like with you. If you catch that Monkey, we can dine off the priest at our leisure, and I promise to make you my sworn brother. But I'm afraid that you won't be able to get him, and that he'll kill you. If that happens, don't blame me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Rest assured,&#8221; the tiger monster said, &#8220;rest assured. I'll soon be back with him.&#8221; Mustering fifty strong and spirited young fiends, he charged out of the gates with drums rolling and banners waving; his two bronze swords were tied to his body. &#8220;Where are you from, ape monk?&#8221; he shrieked at the top of his voice. &#8220;What do you mean by all this yelling and shouting?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You skinned beast,&#8221; Monkey retorted, &#8220;you played that trick of skinning yourself to capture my master, and you have the nerve to ask me what I'm doing! Bring my master out at once and I'll spare your life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, I captured your master,&#8221; the monster replied, &#8220;and he's going to be served up at His Majesty's dinner table. If you have any sense, go away. Otherwise I'll catch you too, and you'll be served up with him. As I've got one of you, I'll let the other off.&#8221; Monkey was now furious, and he gnashed his steely teeth as his fiery eyes opened wide in a terrible glare.</P>
<P>&#8220;What powers have you,&#8221; he roared, brandishing his iron cudgel, &#8220;to give you the nerve to talk so big? Hold it a moment, and take this.&#8221; The tiger put his hands on his swords, and a terrible fight ensued as each of them showed off his powers.</P>


<P>The monster was like a goose egg,</P>
<P>Monkey was an egg-shaped stone.</P>
<P>Trying to ward off Monkey with bronze swords</P>
<P>Was like throwing eggs at a stone.</P>
<P>How can a crow or jackdaw fight a phoenix?</P>
<P>What chance has a pigeon against a hawk?</P>
<P>The monster snorted out winds that covered the mountain with dust,</P>
<P>But Monkey breathed a fog that blotted out the sun.</P>
<P>After fighting it out for many a round,</P>
<P>The Vanguard was exhausted, his strength all gone.</P>
<P>He turned away, defeated, to flee for his life,</P>
<P>Only to have Monkey harry him to death.</P>


<P>When he could defend himself no longer, the monster turned to flee. As he had talked so boastfully in front of his chieftain he dared not return to the cave, so he tried to escape up the mountain side. Monkey, who had no intention of letting him go, chased him as fast as he could, waving his cudgel, roaring, and howling. He chased him as far as the hollow where the wind was stored, where Pig could be seen pasturing the horse. As soon as Pig heard the shouting he turned to look, and when he saw Monkey pursuing the defeated tiger monster he let go of the horse, raised his rake, and struck the tiger diagonally across the head. The poor monster, who thought he had made his way out of the silken net, never realized that he had been caught by a fish-trapper. Pig's rake made nine holes from which the blood gushed, and the brains all spurted out. There is a pome to prove it that goes:</P>


<P>Converted to the true faith several years before,</P>
<P>He avoided meat and was awakened to emptiness.</P>
<P>Determined with all his heart to defend Sanzang</P>
<P>He won this merit early in his religious life.</P>


<P>Planting his foot in the middle of the monster's back, Pig swung the rake with both hands and smote him again. When Monkey saw this he was delighted, and he said, &#8220;That's the way, brother. He led a few dozen petty fiends out to do battle with me, but I beat him. Instead of running back to the cave he came this way, as if he wanted to die. If you hadn't been here to meet him, he'd have got away again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Was he the one who made a gale and carried off our master?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The very one,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Did you ask him where our master is?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;He took our master into the cave and wanted to give him to his chieftain to eat with his rice. This made me so angry that I fought him all the way to here, where you finished him off. The credit for this must go to you, brother. You'd better go on looking after the horse and our things while I drag that monster's body over to the cave and challenge them to another fight. We must capture the chief monster if we're to rescue our master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;so off you go. If you beat that chief monster, mind you chase him this way for me to corner and kill.&#8221; Splendid Monkey went straight to the mouth of the cave with his cudgel in one hand and the dead tiger in the other. Indeed:</P>


<P>When the patriarch was in danger from evil monsters,</P>
<P>Emotion and Nature combined to subdue the demons.</P>


<P>If you don't know whether he defeated the evil monsters and saved Sanzang, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>黄风岭唐僧有难</p>
<p>半山中八戒争先</p>
</div>
<p>偈曰：“法本从心生，还是从心灭。生灭尽由谁，请君自辨别。既然皆己心，何用别人说？只须下苦功，扭出铁中血。绒绳着鼻穿，挽定虚空结。拴在无为树，不使他颠劣。莫认贼为子，心法都忘绝。休教他瞒我，一拳先打彻。现心亦无心，现法法也辍。人牛不见时，碧天光皎洁。秋月一般圆，彼此难分别。”</p>

<p>这一篇偈子，乃是玄奘法师悟彻了《多心经》，打开了门户，那长老常念常存，一点灵光自透。</p>

<p>且说他三众，在路餐风宿水，带月披星，早又至夏景炎天。</p>

<p>但见那：花尽蝶无情叙，树高蝉有声喧。野蚕成茧火榴妍，沼内新荷出现。那日正行时，忽然天晚，又见山路旁边，有一村舍。</p>

<p>三藏道：“悟空，你看那日落西山藏火镜，月升东海现冰轮。幸而道旁有一人家，我们且借宿一宵，明日再走。”八戒道：“说得是，我老猪也有些饿了，且到人家化些斋吃，有力气，好挑行李。”行者道：“这个恋家鬼！你离了家几日，就生报怨！”八戒道：“哥啊，似不得你这喝风呵烟的人。我从跟了师父这几日，长忍半肚饥，你可晓得？”三藏闻之道：“悟能，你若是在家心重呵，不是个出家的了，你还回去罢。那呆子慌得跪下道：“师父，你莫听师兄之言。他有些赃埋人。我不曾报怨甚的，他就说我报怨。我是个直肠的痴汉，我说道肚内饥了，好寻个人家化斋，他就骂我是恋家鬼。师父啊，我受了菩萨的戒行，又承师父怜悯，情愿要伏侍师父往西天去，誓无退悔，这叫做恨苦修行，怎的说不是出家的话！”三藏道：“既是如此，你且起来。”</p>

<p>那呆子纵身跳起，口里絮絮叨叨的，挑着担子，只得死心塌地，跟着前来。早到了路旁人家门首，三藏下马，行者接了缰绳，八戒歇了行李，都伫立绿荫之下。三藏拄着九环锡杖，按按藤缠篾织斗篷，先奔门前，只见一老者，斜倚竹床之上，口里嘤嘤的念佛。三藏不敢高言，慢慢的叫一声：“施主，问讯了。”那老者一骨鲁跳将起来，忙敛衣襟，出门还礼道：“长老，失迎。你自那方来的？到我寒门何故？”三藏道：“贫僧是东土大唐和尚，奉圣旨上雷音寺拜佛求经。适至宝方天晚，意投檀府告借一宵，万祈方便方便。”那老儿摆手摇头道：“去不得，西天难取经。要取经，往东天去罢。”三藏口中不语，意下沉吟：“菩萨指道西去，怎么此老说往东行？东边那得有经？”腼腆难言，半晌不答。却说行者索性凶顽，忍不住，上前高叫道：“那老儿，你这们大年纪，全不晓事。我出家人远来借宿，就把这厌钝的话虎唬我。十分你家窄狭，没处睡时，我们在树底下，好道也坐一夜，不打搅你。”那老者扯住三藏道：“师父，你倒不言语，你那个徒弟，那般拐子脸、别颏腮、雷公嘴、红眼睛的一个痨病魔鬼，怎么反冲撞我这年老之人！”行者笑道：“你这个老儿，忒也没眼色！似那俊刮些儿的，叫做中看不中吃。想我老孙虽小，颇结实，皮裹一团筋哩。”那老者道：“你想必有些手段。”行者道：“不敢夸言，也将就看得过。”老者道：“你家居何处？因甚事削发为僧？”行者道：“老孙祖贯东胜神洲海东傲来国花果山水帘洞居住。自小儿学做妖怪，称名悟空，凭本事，挣了一个齐天大圣。只因不受天禄，大反天宫，惹了一场灾愆。如今脱难消灾，转拜沙门，前求正果，保我这唐朝驾下的师父，上西天拜佛走遭，怕甚么山高路险，水阔波狂！我老孙也捉得怪，降得魔。</p>

<p>伏虎擒龙，踢天弄井，都晓得些儿。倘若府上有甚么丢砖打瓦，锅叫门开，老孙便能安镇。”那老儿听得这篇言语，哈哈笑道：</p>

<p>“原来是个撞头化缘的熟嘴儿和尚。”行者道：“你儿子便是熟嘴！我这些时，只因跟我师父走路辛苦，还懒说话哩。”那老儿道：“若是你不辛苦，不懒说话，好道活活的聒杀我！你既有这样手段，西方也还去得，去得。你一行几众？请至茅舍里安宿。”</p>

<p>三藏道：“多蒙老施主不叱之恩，我一行三众。”老者道：“那一众在那里？”行者指着道：“这老儿眼花，那绿荫下站的不是？”</p>

<p>老儿果然眼花，忽抬头细看，一见八戒这般嘴脸，就唬得一步一跌，往屋里乱跑，只叫：“关门！关门！妖怪来了！”行者赶上扯住道：“老儿莫怕，他不是妖怪，是我师弟。”老者战兢兢的道：“好！好！好！一个丑似一个的和尚！”八戒上前道：“老官儿，你若以相貌取人，干净差了。我们丑自丑，却都有用。”</p>

<p>那老者正在门前与三个和尚相讲，只见那庄南边有两个少年人，带着一个老妈妈，三四个小男女，敛衣赤脚，插秧而回。他看见一匹白马，一担行李，都在他家门首喧哗，不知是甚来历，都一拥上前问道：“做甚么的？”八戒调过头来，把耳朵摆了几摆，长嘴伸了一伸，吓得那些人东倒西歪，乱跄乱跌。慌得那三藏满口招呼道：“莫怕！莫怕！我们不是歹人，我们是取经的和尚。”那老儿才出了门，搀着妈妈道：“婆婆起来，少要惊恐。这师父，是唐朝来的，只是他徒弟脸嘴丑些，却也面恶人善。带男女们家去。”那妈妈才扯着老儿，二少年领着儿女进去。三藏却坐在他们楼里竹床之上，埋怨道：“徒弟呀，你两个相貌既丑，言语又粗，把这一家儿吓得七损八伤，都替我身造罪哩！”八戒道：“不瞒师父说，老猪自从跟了你，这些时俊了许多哩。若象往常在高老庄走时，把嘴朝前一掬，把耳两头一摆，常吓杀二三十人哩。”行者笑道：“呆子不要乱说，把那丑也收拾起些。”三藏道：“你看悟空说的话！相貌是生成的，你教他怎么收拾？”行者道：“把那个耙子嘴，揣在怀里，莫拿出来；把那蒲扇耳，贴在后面，不要摇动，这就是收拾了。”那八戒真个把嘴揣了，把耳贴了，拱着头，立于左右。行者将行李拿入门里，将白马拴在桩上。</p>

<p>只见那老儿才引个少年，拿一个板盘儿，托三杯清茶来献。茶罢，又吩咐办斋。那少年又拿一张有窟窿无漆水的旧桌，端两条破头折脚的凳子，放在天井中，请三众凉处坐下。三藏方问道：“老施主，高姓？”老者道：“在下姓王。”“有几位令嗣？”</p>

<p>道：“有两个小儿，三个小孙。”三藏道：“恭喜，恭喜。”又问：“年寿几何？”道：“痴长六十一岁。”行者道：“好！好！好！花甲重逢矣。”三藏复问道：“老施主，始初说西天经难取者，何也？”老者道：“经非难取，只是道中艰涩难行。我们这向西去，只有三十里远近，有一座山，叫做八百里黄风岭，那山中多有妖怪。故言难取者，此也。若论此位小长老，说有许多手段，却也去得。”</p>

<p>行者道：“不妨！不妨！有了老孙与我这师弟，任他是甚么妖怪，不敢惹我。”正说处，又见儿子拿将饭来，摆在桌上，道声“请斋。”三藏就合掌讽起斋经，八戒早已吞了一碗。长老的几句经还未了，那呆子又吃彀三碗。行者道：“这个馕糠！好道撞着饿鬼了！”那老王倒也知趣，见他吃得快，道：“这个长老，想着实饿了，快添饭来。”那呆子真个食肠大，看他不抬头，一连就吃有十数碗。三藏、行者俱各吃不上两碗，呆子不住，便还吃哩。</p>

<p>老王道：“仓卒无肴，不敢苦劝，请再进一筋。”三藏、行者俱道：</p>

<p>“彀了。”八戒道：“老儿滴答甚么，谁和你发课，说甚么五爻六爻！有饭只管添将来就是。”呆子一顿，把他一家子饭都吃得罄尽，还只说才得半饱。却才收了家火，在那门楼下，安排了竹床板铺睡下。</p>

<p>次日天晓，行者去背马，八戒去整担，老王又教妈妈整治些点心汤水管待，三众方致谢告行。老者道：“此去倘路间有甚不虞，是必还来茅舍。”行者道：“老儿，莫说哈话。我们出家人，不走回头路。”遂此策马挑担西行。噫！这一去，果无好路朝西域，定有邪魔降大灾。三众前来，不上半日，果逢一座高山，说起来，十分险峻。三藏马到临崖，斜挑宝镫观看，果然那：高的是山，峻的是岭；陡的是崖，深的是壑；响的是泉，鲜的是花。那山高不高，顶上接青霄；这涧深不深，底中见地府。山前面，有骨都都白云，屹嶝嶝怪石，说不尽千丈万丈挟魂崖。崖后有弯弯曲曲藏龙洞，洞中有叮叮当当滴水岩。又见些丫丫叉叉带角鹿，泥泥痴痴看人獐；盘盘曲曲红鳞蟒，耍耍顽顽白面猿。至晚巴山寻穴虎，带晓翻波出水龙，登的洞门唿喇喇响。草里飞禽，扑轳轳起；林中走兽，掬律律行。猛然一阵狼虫过，吓得人心趷蹬蹬惊。正是那当倒洞当当倒洞，洞当当倒洞当山。青岱染成千丈玉，碧纱笼罩万堆烟。那师父缓促银骢，孙大圣停云慢步，猪悟能磨担徐行。正看那山，忽闻得一阵旋风大作，三藏在马上心惊道：“悟空，风起了！”行者道：“风却怕他怎的！此乃天家四时之气，有何惧哉！”三藏道：“此风其恶，比那天风不同。”行者道：“怎见得不比天风？”三藏道：“你看这风：巍巍荡荡飒飘飘，渺渺茫茫出碧霄。过岭只闻千树吼，入林但见万竿摇。岸边摆柳连根动，园内吹花带叶飘。收网渔舟皆紧缆，落篷客艇尽抛锚。途半征夫迷失路，山中樵子担难挑。仙果林间猴子散，奇花丛内鹿儿逃。崖前桧柏颗颗倒，涧下松篁叶叶凋。播土扬尘沙迸迸，翻江搅海浪涛涛。”八戒上前，一把扯住行者道：“师兄，十分风大！我们且躲一躲儿干净。”行者笑道：“兄弟不济！</p>

<p>风大时就躲，倘或亲面撞见妖精，怎的是好？”八戒道：“哥啊，你不曾闻得避色如避仇，避风如避箭哩！我们躲一躲，也不亏人。”行者道：“且莫言语，等我把这风抓一把来闻一闻看。”八戒笑道：“师兄又扯空头谎了，风又好抓得过来闻？就是抓得来，使也钻了去了。”行者道：“兄弟，你不知道老孙有个抓风之法。”好大圣，让过风头，把那风尾抓过来闻了一闻，有些腥气，道：“果然不是好风！这风的味道不是虎风，定是怪风，断乎有些蹊跷。”</p>

<p>说不了，只见那山坡下，剪尾跑蹄，跳出一只斑斓猛虎，慌得那三藏坐不稳雕鞍，翻根头跌下白马，斜倚在路旁，真个是魂飞魄散。八戒丢了行李，掣钉钯，不让行者走上前，大喝一声道：“孽畜！那里走！”赶将去，劈头就筑。那只虎直挺挺站将起来，把那前左爪轮起，抠住自家的胸膛，往下一抓，唿剌的一声，把个皮剥将下来，站立道旁。你看他怎生恶相！咦，那模样：</p>

<p>血津津的赤剥身躯，红姢姢的弯环腿足。火焰焰的两鬓蓬松，硬搠搠的双眉直竖。白森森的四个钢牙，光耀耀的一双金眼。</p>

<p>气昂昂的努力大哮，雄纠纠的厉声高喊。喊道：“慢来！慢来！</p>

<p>吾党不是别人，乃是黄风大王部下的前路先锋。今奉大王严命，在山巡逻，要拿几个凡夫去做案酒。你是那里来的和尚，敢擅动兵器伤我？”八戒骂道：“我把你这个孽畜！你是认不得我！</p>

<p>我等不是那过路的凡夫，乃东土大唐御弟三藏之弟子，奉旨上西方拜佛求经者。你早早的远避他方，让开大路，休惊了我师父，饶你性命。若似前猖獗，钯举处，却不留情！”那妖精那容分说，急近步，丢一个架子，望八戒劈脸来抓。这八戒忙闪过，轮钯就筑。那怪手无兵器，下头就走，八戒随后赶来。那怪到了山坡下乱石丛中，取出两口赤铜刀，急轮起转身来迎。两个在这坡前，一往一来，一冲一撞的赌斗。那里孙行者搀起唐僧道：</p>

<p>“师父，你莫害怕，且坐住，等老孙去助助八戒，打倒那怪好走。”三藏才坐将起来，战兢兢的，口里念着《多心经》不题。那行者掣了铁棒，喝声叫“拿了！”此时八戒抖擞精神，那怪败下阵去。行者道：“莫饶他！务要赶上！”他两个轮钉钯，举铁棒，赶下山来。那怪慌了手脚，使个金蝉脱壳计，打个滚，现了原身，依然是一只猛虎。行者与八戒那里肯舍，赶着那虎，定要除根。那怪见他赶得至近，却又抠着胸膛，剥下皮来，苫盖在那卧虎石上，脱真身，化一阵狂风，径回路口。路口上那师父正念《多心经》，被他一把拿住，驾长风摄将去了。可怜那三藏啊：江流注定多磨折，寂灭门中功行难。</p>

<p>那怪把唐僧擒来洞口，按住狂风，对把门的道：“你去报大王说，前路虎先锋拿了一个和尚，在门外听令。”那洞主传令，教：“拿进来。”那虎先锋，腰撇着两口赤铜刀，双手捧着唐僧，上前跪下道：“大王，小将不才，蒙钧令差往山上巡逻，忽遇一个和尚，他是东土大唐驾下御弟三藏法师，上西方拜佛求经，被我擒来奉上，聊具一馔。”那洞主闻得此言，吃了一惊道：“我闻得前后有人传说：三藏法师乃大唐奉旨意取经的神僧，他手下有一个徒弟，名唤孙行者，神通广大，智力高强。你怎么能彀捉得他来？”先锋道：“他有两个徒弟：先来的，使一柄九齿钉钯，他生得嘴长耳大；又一个，使一根金箍铁棒，他生得火眼金睛。正赶着小将争持，被小将使一个金蝉脱壳之计，撤身得空，把这和尚拿来，奉献大王，聊表一餐之敬。”洞主道：“且莫吃他着。”先锋道：“大王，见食不食，呼为劣蹶。”洞主道：“你不晓得，吃了他不打紧，只恐怕他那两个徒弟上门吵闹，未为稳便，且把他绑在后园定风桩上，待三五日，他两个不来搅扰，那时节，一则图他身子干净，二来不动口舌，却不任我们心意？或煮或蒸，或煎或炒，慢慢的自在受用不迟。”先锋大喜道：“大王深谋远虑，说得有理。”教：“小的们，拿了去。”旁边拥上七八个绑缚手，将唐僧拿去，好便似鹰拿燕雀，索绑绳缠。这的是苦命江流思行者，遇难神僧想悟能，道声：“徒弟啊！不知你在那山擒怪，何处降妖，我却被魔头拿来，遭此毒害，几时再得相见？好苦啊！你们若早些儿来，还救得我命；若十分迟了，断然不能保矣！”一边嗟叹，一边泪落如雨。</p>

<p>却说那行者、八戒，赶那虎下山坡，只见那虎跑倒了，塌伏在崖前，行者举棒，尽力一打，转震得自己手疼。八戒复筑了一钯，亦将钯齿迸起，原来是一张虎皮，盖着一块卧虎石。行者大惊道：“不好了！不好了！中了他计也！”八戒道：“中他甚计？”</p>

<p>行者道：“这个叫做金蝉脱壳计，他将虎皮苫在此，他却走了。</p>

<p>我们且回去看看师父，莫遭毒手。”两个急急转来，早已不见了三藏。行者大叫如雷道：“怎的好！师父已被他擒去了。”八戒即便牵着马，眼中滴泪道：“天哪！天哪！却往那里找寻！”行者抬着头跳道：“莫哭！莫哭！一哭就挫了锐气。横竖想只在此山，我们寻寻去来。”</p>

<p>他两个果奔入山中，穿岗越岭，行彀多时，只见那石崖之下，耸出一座洞府。两人定步观瞻，果然凶险，但见那：迭障尖峰，回峦古道。青松翠竹依依，绿柳碧梧冉冉。崖前有怪石双双，林内有幽禽对对。涧水远流冲石壁，山泉细滴漫沙堤。野云片片，瑶草芊芊。妖狐狡兔乱撺梭，角鹿香獐齐斗勇。劈崖斜挂万年藤，深壑半悬千岁柏。奕奕巍巍欺华岳，落花啼鸟赛天台。行者道：“贤弟，你可将行李歇在藏风山凹之间，撒放马匹，不要出头。等老孙去他门首，与他赌斗，必须拿住妖精，方才救得师父。”八戒道：“不消吩咐，请快去。”行者整一整直裰，束一束虎裙，掣了棒，撞至那门前，只见那门上有六个大字，乃“黄风岭黄风洞”，却便丁字脚站定，执着棒，高叫道：“妖怪！趁早儿送我师父出来，省得掀翻了你窝巢，躧平了你住处！”那小怪闻言，一个个害怕，战兢兢的，跑入里面报道：“大王！祸事了！”那黄风怪正坐间，问：“有何事？”小妖道：“洞门外来了一个雷公嘴毛脸的和尚，手持着一根许大粗的铁棒，要他师父哩！”那洞主惊张，即唤虎先锋道：“我教你去巡山，只该拿些山牛、野彘、肥鹿、胡羊，怎么拿那唐僧来，却惹他那徒弟来此闹吵，怎生区处？”先锋道：“大王放心稳便，高枕勿忧。小将不才，愿带领五十个小妖校出去，把那甚么孙行者拿来凑吃。”洞主道：“我这里除了大小头目，还有五七百名小校，凭你选择，领多少去。只要拿住那行者，我们才自自在在吃那和尚一块肉，情愿与你拜为兄弟；但恐拿他不得，反伤了你，那时休得埋怨我也。”虎怪道：“放心！放心！等我去来。”果然点起五十名精壮小妖，擂鼓摇旗，缠两口赤铜刀，腾出门来，厉声高叫道：“你是那里来的个猴和尚，敢在此间大呼小叫的做甚？”行者骂道：</p>

<p>“你这个剥皮的畜生！你弄甚么脱壳法儿，把我师父摄了，倒转问我做甚！趁早好好送我师父出来，还饶你这个性命！”虎怪道：“你师父是我拿了，要与我大王做顿下饭。你识起倒回去罢！不然，拿住你一齐凑吃，却不是买一个又饶一个？”行者闻言，心中大怒，扢迸迸，钢牙错啮；滴流流，火眼睁圆。掣铁棒喝道：“你多大欺心，敢说这等大话！休走！看棍！”那先锋急持刀按住。这一场果然不善，他两个各显威能。好杀：那怪是个真鹅卵，悟空是个鹅卵石。赤铜刀架美猴王，浑如垒卵来击石。鸟鹊怎与凤凰争？鹁鸽敢和鹰鹞敌？那怪喷风灰满山，悟空吐雾云迷日。来往不禁三五回，先锋腰软全无力。转身败了要逃生，却被悟空抵死逼。</p>

<p>那虎怪撑持不住，回头就走。他原来在那洞主面前说了嘴，不敢回洞，径往山坡上逃生。行者那里肯放，执着棒，只情赶来，呼呼吼吼，喊声不绝，却赶到那藏风山凹之间。正抬头，见八戒在那里放马。八戒忽听见呼呼声喊，回头观看，乃是行者赶败的虎怪，就丢了马，举起钯，刺斜着头一筑。可怜那先锋，脱身要跳黄丝网，岂知又遇罩鱼人，却被八戒一钯，筑得九个窟窿鲜血冒，一头脑髓尽流干。有诗为证，诗曰：三五年前归正宗，持斋把素悟真空。诚心要保唐三藏，初秉沙门立此功。那呆子一脚躧住他的脊背，两手轮钯又筑。行者见了，大喜道：</p>

<p>“兄弟，正是这等！他领了几十个小妖，敢与老孙赌斗，被我打败了，他转不往洞跑，却跑来这里寻死。亏你接着；不然，又走了。”八戒道：“弄风摄师父去的可是他？”行者道：“正是，正是。”八戒道：“你可曾问他师父的下落么？”行者道：“这怪把师父拿在洞里，要与他甚么鸟大王做下饭。是老孙恼了，就与他斗将这里来，却着你送了性命。兄弟啊，这个功劳算你的，你可还守着马与行李，等我把这死怪拖了去，再到那洞口索战。须是拿得那老妖，方才救得师父。”八戒道：“哥哥说得有理。你去，你去，若是打败了这老妖，还赶将这里来，等老猪截住杀他。”好行者，一只手提着铁棒，一只手拖着死虎，径至他洞口。</p>

<p>正是：法师有难逢妖怪，情性相和伏乱魔。毕竟不知此去可降得妖怪，救得唐僧，且听下回分解。</p>
