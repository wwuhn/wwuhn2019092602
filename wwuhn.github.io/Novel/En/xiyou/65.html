<P>Wuneng Works Hard on Thorn Ridge</P>
<P>Sanzang Talks of Poetry in the Wood Immortals' Hermitage</P>
</div>
<P>The story has been told how the king of Jisai thanked Tang Sanzang and his three disciples for capturing the demons and pressed on them gold and jade, none of which they would accept. The king therefore told his aides to have made for each of them two suits of clothing like those they were wearing, two pairs of socks, two pairs of shoes and two belts. They were also provided with dry rations, and their passport was duly examined and returned. They were seen out of the city by a procession of carriages, the civil and military officials, the common people of the city and the monks of the Subdued Dragon Monastery. There was also loud music. After six or seven miles they took their leave of the king, to be accompanied for a further six or seven miles by everyone else. Then all the others turned back except the monks of the Subdued Dragon Monastery, who were still with them after twenty miles. Some of the monks wanted to accompany them to the Western Heaven and the others wanted to cultivate their conduct and wait on them.</P>
<P>Seeing that none of them was willing to turn back Monkey decided to use his powers. He pulled out thirty or forty of his hairs, blew on them with magic breath, shouted, &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned them into ferocious striped tigers that leapt roaring about on the path ahead. Only then were the monks scared into going back. The Great Sage then led the master as he whipped his horse forward and they were soon far away.</P>
<P>At this the monks began to weep aloud, shouting, &#8220;Kind and honorable sirs, fate must be against us since you won't take us with you.&#8221;</P>
<P>Let us tell not of the wailing monks but of how the master and his three disciples headed along the main path West for a while before Monkey took his hairs back. Once again the seasons were changing, and it was now the end of winter and the beginning of spring, neither hot nor cold. As they were making their way along without a care they saw a long ridge in front of them over which the road led. Sanzang reined in his horse to look. He saw that the ridge was overgrown with brambles and creepers. Although the line of the path could be made out there were brambles and thorns all over it. &#8220;How are we going to manage that path, disciples?&#8221; he asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;No problem,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;But, disciple, the path is covered with thorns. We could only manage it by crawling on our bellies like snakes or insects. Your backs will be bent with walking, and I'll never be able to ride the horse.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's nothing to worry about, Master,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;I'll clear the thorns away with my rake. It'll be just like gathering up kindling for the fire. Never mind about riding your horse&#8212;I promise we could even get up there in a carrying-chair.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You are very strong,&#8221; the Tang Priest replied, &#8220;but it is a long way and it will be hard. I don't know where you'll find the energy to do that distance: goodness only knows how far it is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no need to guess,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'll go and have a look.&#8221; When he jumped up into the air he saw it stretching away endlessly. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Vast was its size;</P>
<P>It was covered in mist and rain.</P>
<P>Soft was the carpet of grass on the path;</P>
<P>The mountain was covered in brilliant green.</P>
<P>New leaves were sprouting in dense abundance,</P>
<P>Fragrant creepers climbed all around.</P>
<P>When seen from afar no end was in sight;</P>
<P>From close to it seemed a mass of verdant cloud,</P>
<P>Luxuriant, mysterious and green.</P>
<P>The winds soughed everywhere</P>
<P>As the ridge shone bright in the sunshine.</P>
<P>There was pine and cypress and bamboo,</P>
<P>Many a plum and willow, and mulberry too.</P>
<P>Climbing figs coiled round ancient trees,</P>
<P>While creepers entwined the weeping poplars,</P>
<P>All twisted together like a frame,</P>
<P>Woven together in a bed.</P>
<P>Here the flowers made living brocade;</P>
<P>Far spread the scent of boundless blossom.</P>
<P>Everyone's life has brambles and thorns.</P>
<P>But none are as tall as those in the West.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Having looked for a long time, Monkey brought his cloud down and said, &#8220;Master, it's a very long way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How far?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I can't see any end to it,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;There must be at least three hundred miles of it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's terrible,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be miserable, Master,&#8221; said Friar Sand with a laugh. &#8220;We know how to burn undergrowth. Set fire to it with a torch and all the thorns will be burned away. Then we'll be able to cross.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't talk nonsense,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;You can only clear the ground that way in November or later when the grass has withered and there are dead trees. The fire won't take otherwise. It'd never burn now, when everything's growing.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Even if it did burn it would be terrifying,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Then how are we to get across?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;You'll just have to depend on me,&#8221; said Pig with a grin.</P>
<P>The splendid idiot made a spell with his hands and said the words of it, leaned forward, and said, &#8220;Grow!&#8221; He grew two hundred feet tall, then waved the rake and shouted. &#8220;Change!&#8221; It became three hundred feet long. Then he strode forward and wielded the rake two-handed to clear the undergrowth from both sides of the path. &#8220;Come with me, Master,&#8221; he said. Sanzang was delighted to whip the horse along and follow close behind while Friar Sand carried the luggage and Monkey used his cudgel to help clear the way. They did not let their hands rest for a moment all day long, and they had covered over thirty miles when near nightfall they came to an empty stretch of ground where a stone tablet stood in the middle of the path.</P>
<P>On the tablet the words THORN RIDGE were written large, and under them two lines of smaller writing read, &#8220;Two hundred and fifty miles of rampant thorns; few travelers have ever taken this road.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Pig saw this he said with a laugh, &#8220;Let me add a couple more lines to that: 'Pig has always been good at removing thorns; he's cleared the roads right to the West.'&#8220; Sanzang then dismounted in a very good mood.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciples,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I've put you to a lot of trouble. Let's stop here for the night and carry on at first light tomorrow.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't stop now, Master,&#8221; said Pig with a smile. &#8220;It's a clear sky and we're in the mood. It's all right if we carry on all bloody night.&#8221; The venerable elder had to accept his suggestion.</P>
<P>While Pig was working so hard in the lead all four of them pressed ahead without stopping for the night and another day until it was evening once more. In front-of them the trees and undergrowth were densely tangled and the wind could be heard rustling in the bamboos and soughing in the pines. Luckily they came to another patch of empty land where there stood an old temple outside whose gates pine and cypress formed a solid green shade, while peach and plum trees rivaled each other in beauty. Sanzang then dismounted and went with his three disciples to examine it. This is what they saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Before the cliff an ancient shrine stood by a cold stream;</P>
<P>Desolation hung all around the hill.</P>
<P>White cranes in the thickets made the moon seem brighter;</P>
<P>The green moss on the steps had been there for years.</P>
<P>The rustle of green bamboo seemed like human speech;</P>
<P>The remaining calls of the birds seemed expressions of grief.</P>
<P>Dogs and hens never came, and few human souls;</P>
<P>Wild flowers and plants grew all over the wall.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;This place strikes me as very sinister,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Let's not stay here long.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're being overcautious, brother,&#8221; remarked Friar Sand. &#8220;As this is deserted and I don't think there are any monsters, wild beasts or fiends, there's nothing to be afraid of.&#8221; No sooner were the words out of his mouth than there was a gust of sinister wind and an old man emerged from the temple gateway. He wore a turban, a pale-coloured gown and grass sandals, and he held a crooked stick. He was accompanied by a devil servant with a blue face, terrible fangs, red whiskers and a red body who was carrying on his head a tray of cakes.</P>
<P>&#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; said the old man as they both knelt down, &#8220;I am the local god of Thorn Ridge. As I knew you were coming but had nothing better to offer you I have prepared this tray of steamed cakes for your master. Do all have some. As there are no other houses for hundreds of miles I hope you will accept a few to stave off the pangs of hunger.&#8221;</P>
<P>This was just what Pig wanted to hear: he went up and was just stretching out his hands to take a cake when Monkey, who had been taking a long, hard look at all this, shouted, &#8220;Stop! He's evil! Behave yourself!&#8221; He was now addressing the local god.</P>
<P>&#8220;You're no local god, trying to fool me like that. Take this!&#8221;</P>
<P>Seeing the ferocity of his attack, the local god turned round and transformed himself into a howling gust of negative wind that carried the venerable elder flying off through the air. Nobody knew where he had been taken. The Great Sage was desperate because he did not know where to look for the master, while Pig and Friar Sand stared at each other, pale with shock. Even the white horse was whinnying with fright. The three brother disciples and the horse were in utter confusion. They looked all around as far as they could see but without finding him.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We will not describe their search but tell how the old man and his devil servant carried Sanzang to a stone house that was wreathed in mist and gently set him down. Holding him by the hand and supporting him the old man said, &#8220;Don't be afraid, holy monk. We aren't bad people. I am the Eighteenth Lord of Thorn Ridge. I have asked you here on this cool, clear moonlit night to talk about poetry and pass the time in friendship.&#8221; Only then did Sanzang calm down. When he took a careful look around this is what he saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>From where the banks of cloud set out</P>
<P>Stood a pure house for immortals, a place</P>
<P>To purify the self and refine elixir,</P>
<P>To plant groves of bamboo and grow one's flowers.</P>
<P>Cranes often came to the emerald cliff,</P>
<P>And frogs called in the pool's blue waters.</P>
<P>This was a match for the cinnabar furnace on Mount Tiantai,</P>
<P>And made one think of the sunsets at Mount Huashan.</P>
<P>Forget the vain effort of ploughing the clouds and fishing for the moon;</P>
<P>Here there is admirable privacy and ease.</P>
<P>Sit here for long enough and your mind becomes sea-vast;</P>
<P>The rising moon can be half seen through the gauzy curtains.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As Sanzang was looking around and noticing how brightly the moon and the stars were shining he heard the sound of voices saying, &#8220;The Eighteenth Lord has brought the holy monk here.&#8221; Sanzang looked up and saw three old men. The nearest one was white-haired and distinguished; the second one's temples had a green gloss and he was full of vigor; and the third had a pure heart and blue-black hair.</P>
<P>Their faces and clothes were all different, and they all came to bow to Sanzang, who returned their courtesy, saying, &#8220;I have done nothing to deserve this great affection you are showing for me.&#8221;</P>
<P>To this the Eighteenth Lord replied with a smile, &#8220;We have long heard, holy monk, of how you have found the Way and we've long been waiting for the good fortune of meeting you that we have enjoyed today. I hope that you will not be grudge the pearls of your wisdom, but will make yourself comfortable, sit and talk. Then we may learn about the true Dhyana teachings.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;May I ask the titles of the immortals?&#8221; Sanzang asked with a bow.</P>
<P>&#8220;The one with white hair,&#8221; the Eighteenth Lord replied, &#8220;is known as the Lone Upright Lord; the one with green temples is Master Emptiness; and the one with a pure heart is the Ancient Cloud-toucher. My title is Energy.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How old are you four venerable gentlemen?&#8221; Sanzang asked. To this the Lone Upright Lord replied,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am already a thousand years old;</P>
<P>I touch the sky and my leaves are always spring.</P>
<P>Elegant are my fragrant branches</P>
<P>Shaped like dragons and snakes;</P>
<P>My shadow is broken into many parts;</P>
<P>My body is covered in snow.</P>
<P>Since childhood I have stood firm and endured;</P>
<P>Now I am happy to cultivate the True.</P>
<P>The birds and phoenixes that perch are not mere mortal ones;</P>
<P>I am free and far from the dust of the normal world.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Master Emptiness spoke next with a smile:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've borne wind and frost for a thousand years,</P>
<P>Strong in my tall body and the vigor of my limbs.</P>
<P>In the still of the night comes the sound of raindrops,</P>
<P>And the shade spreads like a cloud in autumn sunlight.</P>
<P>My gnarled roots have the secret of eternal life;</P>
<P>I have been given the art of never aging.</P>
<P>Storks stay here and dragons, not common creatures:</P>
<P>I am green and full of life, as in immortals' land.&#8221;</P>
<P>Then the Ancient Cloud-toucher said with a smile,</P>
<P>&#8220;Over a thousand autumns have I passed in emptiness;</P>
<P>Lofty is the view that grows ever purer.</P>
<P>Here there is no commotion, but eternal cool and calm;</P>
<P>I am full of spirit and have seen much frost and snow.</P>
<P>The seven worthies come to talk about the Way;</P>
<P>I sing and drink with my friends, the six men of leisure.</P>
<P>Lightly beating the jade and the gold</P>
<P>My nature is one with heaven; I roam with immortals.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Then Energy, the Eighteenth Lord, smiled as he said,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;My age is also over a thousand,</P>
<P>I am hoary, pure and natural.</P>
<P>Rain and dew give admirable vigor;</P>
<P>I borrow the creative power of heaven and earth.</P>
<P>Alone I flourish in ravines of wind and mist,</P>
<P>Relaxed and at my ease through all four seasons.</P>
<P>Under my green shade immortals stay</P>
<P>For chess and music and books on the Way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;All four of you immortals have lived to most advanced ages.&#8221; Sanzang said, &#8220;and the old gentleman Energy is over a thousand. You are ancient, you have found the Way, you are elegant and you are pure. Are you not the Four Brilliant Ones of Han times?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You flatter us too much,&#8221; said the four old men. &#8220;We're not the Four Brilliant Ones: we're the four from deep in the mountains. May we ask, worthy monk, what your illustrious age is?&#8221; Sanzang put his hands together and replied,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Forty years ago I left my mother's womb,</P>
<P>Fated to disaster since before my birth.</P>
<P>Escaping with my life I floated in the waves</P>
<P>Until I reached Jinshan where I renewed my body.</P>
<P>I nourished my nature and studied the sutras,</P>
<P>Sincere in worship of the Buddha, not wasting time.</P>
<P>Now that His Majesty has sent me to the West,</P>
<P>I am deeply honoured by you ancient immortals.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The four ancients then praised him, saying, &#8220;Holy monk, you have followed the Buddha's teaching since you left your mother's womb. By cultivating your conduct from childhood you have become a lofty monk who has found the Way. We are very happy to see you and would like to ask you to teach us. Could you possibly tell us the rudiments of the Dhyana dharma? It would be a great comfort to us.&#8221; When the venerable elder heard this he was not at all alarmed, and this is what he said to them:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Dhyana is silence; the dharma is that which saves. Silent salvation can only come through enlightenment. Enlightenment is washing the mind and cleansing it of care, casting off the vulgar and leaving worldly dust. Human life is hard to obtain; it is hard to be born in the central lands; and the true dharma is hard to find. There is no greater good fortune than to have all three. The wonderful Way of perfect virtue is subtle and imperceptible. Only with it can the six sense-organs and the six forms of consciousness be swept away. Wisdom is this: there is no death and no life, no excess and no deficiency, emptiness and matter are all included, holy and secular both dismissed. It has mastered the tools of the Taoist faith and is aware of the methods of Sakyamuni. It casts the net of phenomena and smashes nirvana. Perception within perception is needed, enlightenment within enlightenment, then a dot of sacred light will protect everything. Light the raging fire to illuminate the Saha realm; it alone is revealed throughout the dharma world. Being utterly subtle it is firmer than ever: who crosses the pass of mystery through verbal persuasion? From the beginning I cultivated the Dhyana of great awareness: I was fated and determined to attain enlightenment.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The four elders listened with cocked ears and were filled with boundless joy. Each of them kowtowed and was converted to the truth, saying with bows of gratitude, &#8220;Holy monk, you are the very root of the enlightenment to be found through Dhyana meditation.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Ancient Cloud-toucher said, &#8220;Dhyana may be silence, and the dharma may well save, but it is necessary for the nature to be settled and the mind sincere. If one is a true immortal of great awareness one has to sit in the Way of no-life. Our mysteries are very different.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The Way is not fixed; its form and function are one. How is yours different?&#8221; Sanzang asked. To this the Ancient Cloud-toucher replied with a smile:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;We have been firm from birth: our forms and functions are different from yours. We were born in response to heaven and earth and grew through the rain and the dew. Proudly we laugh at wind and frost; we wear out the days and nights. Not one leaf withers, and all our branches are full of firm resolve. What I say has no emptiness about it, but you cling to your Sanskrit. The Way was China's in the first place and only later looked for more evidence in the West. You are wearing out your straw sandals for nothing: you don't know what you are looking for. You are like a stone lion cutting out its own heart, or a fox salivating so hard it digests the marrow of its own bones. If in your meditation you forget your roots you will pursue the Buddha's reward in vain. Your words are as tangled as the brambles on our Thorn Ridge and as confused as the creepers. How can we accept a gentleman such as you? How can one like you be approved and taught? You must reexamine your present state and find a life of freedom in stillness. Only then can you learn to raise water in a bottomless basket, and make the rootless iron-tree flower. On the peak of the Miraculous Treasure my feet stand firm; I return to the assembly at Longhua.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Sanzang heard this he kowtowed in thanks, and the Eighteenth Lord and the Lone Upright Lord helped him back to his feet, Master Emptiness said with a chuckle, &#8220;Cloud-toucher's remarks revealed things a little too clearly. Please get up, holy monk: you don't have to believe every word of it. We didn't intend to use the light of the moon for serious discussions. We should chant poems, feel free, and let ourselves relax.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If we're going to recite poems,&#8221; said Cloud-toucher with a smile, pointing towards the stone house, &#8220;why don't we go into the hermitage and drink some tea?&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang answered with a bow and went over to look at the hermitage, above which was written in large letters TREE IMMORTALS' HERMITAGE. They all then went inside and decided where to sit, whereupon the red devil servant appeared with a tray of China-root cakes and five bowls of fragrant tea. The four old men urged Sanzang to eat some cakes, but he was too suspicious to do so, and would not take any till the four old men had all eaten some: only then did he eat a couple. After they had drunk some tea it was cleared away. Sanzang then stole a careful look around and saw that everything was of a delicate and intricate beauty in the moonlight:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Where waters flowed beside the rocks,</P>
<P>And fragrant scents from the flowers curled,</P>
<P>The scene was one of cultured peace,</P>
<P>Free from the dust of a lower world.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sanzang took great pleasure in gazing on this sight: he felt happy, relaxed and exhilarated. He found himself saying a line of poetry: &#8220;The dhyana heart revolves in moonlike purity.&#8221;</P>
<P>The couplet was completed by Energy, who said with a smile: &#8220;Poetic inspiration is fresher than the sky.&#8221;</P>
<P>To this Lone Upright added: &#8220;By grafting on each line embroidery grows.&#8221;</P>
<P>Then Emptiness said: &#8220;Pearls come when naturally the writing flows.&#8221;</P>
<P>Cloud-toucher continued: &#8220;The glory is now over: Six Dynasties disappear. The<I> Songs</I> are redivided to make distinctions clear.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I shouldn't have let those silly words slip out just now,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;I was only rambling. Really, I am a beginner trying to show off in front of experts. Having heard you immortals talk in that fresh and free-ranging way I now know that you old gentlemen are true poets.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't waste time in idle chat,&#8221; said Energy. &#8220;A monk should take things through to the end. You started the verse, so why don't you finish it? Please do so at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I can't,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;It would be much better if you completed it for me, Eighteenth Lord.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's very nice of you, I must say!&#8221; commented Energy. &#8220;You started the verse so you can't refuse to finish it. It's wrong to be so stingy with your pearls.&#8221; Sanzang then had no choice but to add a final couplet:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Waiting for the tea lying pillowed in the breeze,</P>
<P>Spring is in the voice now that the heart's at ease.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;I like 'Spring is in the voice now that the heart's at ease,'&#8220; said the Eighteenth Lord.</P>
<P>To this Lone Upright replied, &#8220;Energy, you have a deep understanding of poetry, and spend all your time savoring its delights. Why don't you compose another poem for us?&#8221;</P>
<P>The Eighteenth Lord generously did not refuse. &#8220;Very well then,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;let's make up chain couplets. Each person has to start his couplet with the last word of the couplet before. I'll lead off:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Without spring's glory there would be no winter's death;</P>
<P>Clouds come and mists depart as if existing not.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Let me tack another couple more lines on,&#8221; Master Emptiness said.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Not any breath of wind to rock the spreading shade;</P>
<P>Visitors enjoy the Wealth and Long Life picture.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Cloud-toucher now joined in with his couplet:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Picture it like the strong old man of the Western hills,</P>
<P>Pure as the hermit of the South, the heartless man.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Lone Upright added his two lines:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;The man is a roof-beam as he has side-leaves</P>
<P>To build the office of the censorate.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Sanzang heard all this he could only sigh and say, &#8220;Indeed, your superb poems have a noble spirit that rises up to the heavens. Despite my lack of talent I would like to add a couplet to that.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Holy monk,&#8221; said Lone Upright, &#8220;you are one who has found the Way and a man of great cultivation. You need not add another couplet. Instead you can give us a whole verse so that we can try as best we can to match the rhyme pattern.&#8221; Sanzang had no choice but to recite the following regulated verse with a smile:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Travelling West with my staff to visit the Dharma King</P>
<P>I seek the wonderful scriptures to spread them far and wide.</P>
<P>The golden magic fungus blesses the poetry circle;</P>
<P>Under the trees is the scent of a thousand flowers.</P>
<P>One must go higher from the top of a hundred-foot pole,</P>
<P>Leaving one's traces in ten regions' worlds.</P>
<P>Cultivate the jade image and majestic body:</P>
<P>Before the gate of bliss is the monastery.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the four old men had heard this they were full of high praise for it. &#8220;Although I'm stupid and untalented,&#8221; the Eighteenth Lord said, &#8220;I'll take my courage in both hands and try to match your rhymes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Vigorous and proud, I smile as king of the trees:</P>
<P>Not ever the tree of heaven can match my fame.</P>
<P>A dragon and snake shadow for a thousand feet in the mountains;</P>
<P>The spring has flowed for a thousand years with its amber fragrance.</P>
<P>My spirit is at one with heaven and earth:</P>
<P>I gladly cover my traces in the wind and rain.</P>
<P>Now I am old I regret having no immortal bones</P>
<P>And rely on China-root alone to maintain my years.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;That poem started off heroically, and the next couplet had some strength,&#8221; said the Lone Upright Lord. &#8220;But the last line was too modest. Admirable! Most admirable! Let me try rhyming one too:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;I happily give a perch in the frost to the king of the birds;</P>
<P>My talent is displayed before the Hall of Four Perfections.</P>
<P>The pearly tassels of heavy dew obscure the green carpet;</P>
<P>In the light breeze stone teeth crush chilly fragrance.</P>
<P>A delicate voice intones in the corridor at night;</P>
<P>Pale autumn shadows are put away in the ancient hall.</P>
<P>I used to be offered for long life at the New Year;</P>
<P>In old age I stand proudly on the mountain.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a fine poem, what a fine poem,&#8221; said Master Emptiness. &#8220;Truly, the moon was working together with heaven to write it. How could such a clumsy fool as I am hope to match its rhymes? But I must try to patch a few lines together: I don't want to waste this chance:&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;The timber of roofbeams is close to kings;</P>
<P>Its fame is spread in the Palace of Great Purity.</P>
<P>The sunlit hall seems filled with azure blue;</P>
<P>Green fragrance always pervades the dark wall.</P>
<P>Strong, cold and ancient in my beauty,</P>
<P>My roots go down to the Underworld's nine springs.</P>
<P>My spreading shade gives cover like cold clouds.</P>
<P>I don't compete in prettiness with flowers.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;You three gentlemen's poems,&#8221; said Cloud-toucher, &#8220;are elegant and pure, like a whole sackful of embroidery and brocades being opened out. Although I have neither strength nor talent you three gentlemen have removed the block for me. If you insist I'll put a few lines of doggerel together. I hope they won't make you laugh:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In the bamboo grove I delight wise kings;</P>
<P>A hundred acres of me by the Wei brings fame.</P>
<P>My green skin is naturally marked by the tears of the Xiang Goddess;</P>
<P>My scaly shoots pass on the scent of history.</P>
<P>My leaves will never change their color in frost;</P>
<P>The beauty of my misty twigs can never be concealed.</P>
<P>Few have understood me since the death of Wang Huizhi;</P>
<P>Since ancient times I have been known through brush and ink.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;You venerable immortals have all composed poems like phoenixes breathing out pearls,&#8221; Sanzang said. &#8220;There is nothing I can add. I am deeply moved by the great favour you have shown me. But it is late now and I do not know where my three disciples are waiting for me. I cannot stay any longer, and I must start finding my way back. I am profoundly grateful for your boundless love. Could you show me my way back?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be so worried, holy monk,&#8221; replied the four ancients, laughing. &#8220;An encounter like this is rare in a thousand years. The sky is fresh and clear, and the moon makes the night as bright as day. Relax and sit here for a little longer. At dawn we shall see you across the ridge. You will certainly meet your distinguished disciples.&#8221;</P>
<P>As they were talking in came two serving maids in blue, each carrying a lantern of crimson silk. Behind them followed a fairy who was holding a sprig of apricot blossom as she greeted them with a smile. What did the fairy look like?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Her hair had the green of jade,</P>
<P>Her face was pinker than rouge.</P>
<P>Her starry eyes were full of light and color;</P>
<P>Her elegant eyebrows were like moth antennae.</P>
<P>She wore a red skirt with plum-blossom designs;</P>
<P>And a light jacket of gray shot with red.</P>
<P>Her curved shoes were shaped like phoenix beaks,</P>
<P>And her silk stockings were marked with mud.</P>
<P>This witch was as lovely as the woman on Tiantai,</P>
<P>No less a beauty than the Zhou king's concubine.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;To what do we owe the pleasure of your visit, Apricot Fairy?&#8221; the old man asked as they bowed to her.</P>
<P>Returning their bows she replied, &#8220;I hear that you have a distinguished guest here and are exchanging poems with him. May I meet him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Here he is,&#8221; said the Eighteenth Lord, pointing him out. &#8220;You don't need to ask.&#8221; Sanzang bowed to her but dared say nothing.</P>
<P>&#8220;Bring in the tea at once,&#8221; she said. Two more serving girls in yellow, carried in a red lacquer tray on which were six fine porcelain tea-bowls with rare fruits in them and spoons lying across the top, as well as a copper-inlaid iron teapot in which was hot and fragrant tea. When the tea had been poured the woman showed glimpses of finger as delicate as spring onion shoots as she presented the porcelain bowls of it first to Sanzang and then to the four ancients. The last cup she kept for herself.</P>
<P>Only when Master Emptiness invited the Apricot Fairy to sit down did she do so. After they had drunk the tea she leant forward and said, &#8220;As you ancient immortals have been having so delightful an evening could you tell me some of the choicest lines you've composed?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Our stuff was just vulgar rubbish,&#8221; Cloud-toucher replied. &#8220;But this holy monk's verses were truly superb examples of high Tang poetry.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please let me hear them if you will,&#8221; the fairy said, whereupon the four ancients recited Sanzang's two poems and his exposition of the Dhyana dharma. The woman, whose face was all smiles, then said, &#8220;I'm completely untalented and shouldn't really be making a fool of myself like this, but hearing this wonderful lines is an opportunity too good to waste. Could I cobble together a verse in the second rhyme pattern?&#8221; She then recited these lines:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Han Emperor Wu first made my name;</P>
<P>In Zhou times Confucius taught under my shade.</P>
<P>Dong Feng loved me so much he planted a wood of me;</P>
<P>Sun Chu once offered my jelly in sacrifice.</P>
<P>Soft is my pink and rain-fed beauty;</P>
<P>The misty green is shown and yet concealed.</P>
<P>When over-ripe I have a touch of sourness;</P>
<P>Each year I fall beside the fields of wheat.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the four ancients heard the poem they were all full of admiration for it. &#8220;How elegant it is,&#8221; they said, &#8220;and how free of worldly dust. At the same time the lines have something of the awakening of spring in them. 'Soft is my pink and rain-fed beauty.' That's good. 'Soft is my pink and rain-fed beauty.'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're too kind&#8212;it quite alarms me,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;The holy monk's lines that I heard just now were like brocade from the heart or embroidery in words. Could you be generous with your pearls and teach me one of those verses?&#8221; The Tang Priest dared not reply.</P>
<P>The woman was evidently falling for him and moving closer and closer, pressing herself against him and whispering to him, &#8220;Noble guest, let's make the most of this wonderful night for love. What are we waiting for? Life is short.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The Apricot Fairy admires you completely, holy monk,&#8221; said the Eighteenth Lord. &#8220;You must feel something for her. If you don't find her adorable you have very poor taste.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The holy monk is a famous gentleman who has found the Way,&#8221; said the Lone Upright Lord, &#8220;and he wouldn't possibly act in a way that was at all improper. It would be quite wrong of us to do things like that. To ruin his reputation and honour would be a very mean thing to do. If the Apricot Fairy is willing Cloud-toucher and the Eighteenth Lord can act as matchmakers while Master Emptiness and I act as the guarantors of the wedding. It would be excellent if they married.&#8221;</P>
<P>Hearing this Sanzang turned pale with horror, jumped to his feet and shouted at the top of his voice, &#8220;You're all monsters, trying to lead me astray like that. There was nothing wrong with talking about the mysteries of the Way with well-honed arguments, but it's disgraceful of you to try to ruin a monk like me by using a woman as a bait.&#8221; Seeing how angry Sanzang was they all bit their fingers in fear and said nothing more.</P>
<P>But the red devil servant exploded with thunderous fury, &#8220;You don't know how honoured you're being, monk. What's wrong with my sister? She's beautiful and charming. Her needlework aside, her gift for poetry alone would make her more than a match for you. What do you mean, trying to turn her down? You're making a terrible mistake. The Lone Upright Lord's idea was quite right. If you're not prepared to sleep with her on the quiet I'll marry the two of you properly.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang went paler still with shock. None of their arguments, however outrageous, had the slightest impact on him. &#8220;We've been talking to you very nicely, monk,&#8221; the devil servant said, &#8220;but you don't pay the slightest attention. If we lose our tempers and start our rough, country way of doing things we'll drag you off and see to it that you can never be a monk any longer or ever marry a wife. After that your life will be pointless.&#8221;</P>
<P>The venerable elder's heart remained as hard as metal or stone and he obdurately refused to do as they asked, wondering all the time where his disciples were looking for him. At the thought his tears flowed unquenchably. Smiling and sitting down next to him the woman produced a silk handkerchief from her emerald sleeve with which she wiped away his tears.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be so upset, noble guest,&#8221; She said. &#8220;You and I are going to taste the pleasures of love.&#8221; Sanzang jumped up and shouted at her to go away and would have left at once if they had not held him there by force. The row went on till daybreak.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Suddenly Sanzang heard a call of, &#8220;Master! Master! We can hear you. Where are you?&#8221; Monkey, Pig and Friar Sand had been searching everywhere all night, leading the white horse and carrying the baggage. They had gone through all the thorns and brambles without a moment's rest and by now had reached the Western side of the 250-mile-wide cloud-capped Thorn Ridge, This was the shout they gave when they heard Sanzang's angry yells. Sanzang broke free, rushed outside, and called, &#8220;Wukong, I'm here. Help! Help!&#8221; The four ancients, the devil servant, the woman and her maids all disappeared in a flash.</P>
<P>A moment later Pig and Friar Sand were there too. &#8220;How ever did you get here, Master?&#8221; they asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciples,&#8221; said Sanzang, clinging to Monkey, &#8220;I have put you to a lot of trouble. I was carried here by the old man who appeared last night and said he was a local deity bringing us vegetarian food&#8212;the one you shouted at and were going to hit. He held my hand and helped me inside that door there, where I saw three old men who had come to meet me. They kept calling me 'holy monk' and talked in a very pure and elegant way. They were marvellous poets, and I matched some verses with them. Then at about midnight a beautiful woman came with lanterns to see me and made up a poem herself. She kept calling me 'noble guest'. She liked the look of me so much she wanted to sleep with me. That brought me to my senses. When I refused they offered to be matchmakers and guarantors, and to marry us. I swore not to agree and was just shouting at them and trying to get away when to my surprise you turned up. Although they were still dragging at my clothes they suddenly disappeared. It must have been because it was dawn and because they were frightened of you too.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Did you ask them their names when you were talking about poetry?&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey asked. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;I asked them their titles. The oldest was Energy, the Eighteenth Lord; the next oldest was the Lone Upright Lord; the third was Master Emptiness; and the fourth the Ancient Cloud-toucher. They called the woman Apricot Fairy.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are they?&#8221; Pig asked, &#8220;where've they gone?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where they have gone I don't know,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;but where we talked about poetry was near here.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the three disciples searched with their master they found a rock-face on which were carved the words &#8220;Tree Immortals' Hermitage.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is it,&#8221; said Sanzang, and on looking carefully Brother Monkey saw a big juniper, an old cypress, an old pine and an old bamboo. Behind the bamboo was a red maple. When he took another look by the rock-face he saw an old apricot tree, two winter-flowering plums, and two osman-thuses.</P>
<P>&#8220;Did you see the evil spirits?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's just because you don't realize that those trees have become spirits,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you tell that the spirits were trees?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The Eighteenth lord is the pine,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;the Lone Upright Lord the cypress, Master Emptiness the juniper and the Ancient Cloud-toucher the bamboo. The maple there was the red devil and the Apricot Fairy that apricot tree.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Pig heard this he ruthlessly hit with his rake and rooted with his snout to knock the plum, osmanthus, apricot and maple trees over, and as he did blood flowed from their roots. &#8220;Wuneng,&#8221; said Sanzang, going up to him to check him, &#8220;don't harm any more of them. Although they have become spirits they did me no harm. Let's be on our way again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be sorry for them, Master,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;They'll do people a great deal of harm if we let them develop into big monsters.&#8221; With that the idiot let fly with his rake and knocked pine, cypress, juniper ad bamboo all to the ground. Only then did he invite his master to remount and carry along the main route to the West.</P>
<P>If you don't know what happened as they pressed ahead, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>荆棘岭悟能努力</p>
<p>木仙庵三藏谈诗</p>
</div>
<p>话表祭赛国王谢了唐三藏师徒获宝擒怪之恩，所赠金玉，分毫不受，却命当驾官照依四位常穿的衣服，各做两套，鞋袜各做两双，绦环各做两条，外备干粮烘炒，倒换了通关文牒，大排銮驾，并文武多官，满城百姓，伏龙寺僧人，大吹大打，送四众出城。约有二十里，先辞了国王。众人又送二十里辞回。伏龙寺僧人送有五六十里不回，有的要同上西天，有的要修行伏侍。行者见都不肯回去，遂弄个手段，把毫毛拔了三四十根，吹口仙气，叫“变！”都变作斑斓猛虎，拦住前路，哮吼踊跃。众僧方惧，不敢前进，大圣才引师父策马而去。少时间，去得远了，众僧人放声大哭，都喊：“有恩有义的老爷！我等无缘，不肯度我们也！”</p>

<p>且不说众僧啼哭，却说师徒四众，走上大路，却才收回毫毛，一直西去。正是时序易迁，又早冬残春至，不暖不寒，正好逍遥行路。忽见一条长岭，岭顶上是路。三藏勒马观看，那岭上荆棘丫叉，薜萝牵绕，虽是有道路的痕迹，左右却都是荆刺棘针。唐僧叫：“徒弟，这路怎生走得？”行者道：“怎么走不得？”</p>

<p>又道：“徒弟啊，路痕在下，荆棘在上，只除是蛇虫伏地而游，方可去了。若你们走，腰也难伸，教我如何乘马？”八戒道：“不打紧，等我使出钯柴手来，把钉钯分开荆棘，莫说乘马，就抬轿也包你过去。”三藏道：“你虽有力，长远难熬，却不知有多少远近，怎生费得这许多精神！”行者道：“不须商量，等我去看看。”</p>

<p>将身一纵，跳在半空看时，一望无际。真个是：匝地远天，凝烟带雨。夹道柔茵乱，漫山翠盖张。密密搓搓初发叶，攀攀扯扯正芬芳。遥望不知何所尽，近观一似绿云茫。蒙蒙茸茸，郁郁苍苍。风声飘索索，日影映煌煌。那中间有松有柏还有竹，多梅多柳更多桑。薜萝缠古树，藤葛绕垂杨。盘团似架，联络如床。有处花开真布锦，无端卉发远生香。为人谁不遭荆棘，那见西方荆棘长！行者看罢多时，将云头按下道：“师父，这去处远哩！”三藏问：“有多少远？”行者道：“一望无际，似有千里之遥。”三藏大惊道：“怎生是好？”沙僧笑道：“师父莫愁，我们也学烧荒的，放上一把火，烧绝了荆棘过去。”八戒道：“莫乱谈！</p>

<p>烧荒的须在十来月，草衰木枯，方好引火。如今正是蕃盛之时，怎么烧得！”行者道：“就是烧得，也怕人子。”三藏道：“这般怎生得度？”八戒笑道：“要得度，还依我。”好呆子，捻个诀，念个咒语，把腰躬一躬，叫“长！”就长了有二十丈高下的身躯，把钉钯幌一幌，教“变！”就变了有三十丈长短的钯柄，拽开步，双手使钯，将荆棘左右搂开：“请师父跟我来也！”三藏见了甚喜，即策马紧随。后面沙僧挑着行李，行者也使铁棒拨开。这一日未曾住手，行有百十里，将次天晚，见有一块空阔之处，当路上有一通石碣，上有三个大字，乃“荆棘岭”；下有两行十四个小字，乃“荆棘蓬攀八百里，古来有路少人行”。八戒见了笑道：“等我老猪与他添上两句：自今八戒能开破，直透西方路尽平！”三藏欣然下马道：“徒弟啊，累了你也！我们就在此住过了今宵，待明日天光再走。”八戒道：“师父莫住，趁此天色晴明，我等有兴，连夜搂开路走他娘！”那长老只得相从。</p>

<p>八戒上前努力，师徒们人不住手，马不停蹄，又行了一日一夜，却又天色晚矣。那前面蓬蓬结结，又闻得风敲竹韵，飒飒松声。却好又有一段空地，中间乃是一座古庙，庙门之外，有松柏凝青，桃梅斗丽。三藏下马，与三个徒弟同看，只见岩前古庙枕寒流，落目荒烟锁废丘。白鹤丛中深岁月，绿芜台下自春秋。</p>

<p>竹摇青珮疑闻语，鸟弄余音似诉愁。鸡犬不通人迹少，闲花野蔓绕墙头。行者看了道：“此地少吉多凶，不宜久坐。”沙僧道：</p>

<p>“师兄差疑了，似这杳无人烟之处，又无个怪兽妖禽，怕他怎的？”说不了，忽见一阵阴风，庙门后，转出一个老者，头戴角巾，身穿淡服，手持拐杖，足踏芒鞋，后跟着一个青脸獠牙、红须赤身鬼使，头顶着一盘面饼，跪下道：“大圣，小神乃荆棘岭土地，知大圣到此，无以接待，特备蒸饼一盘，奉上老师父，各请一餐。此地八百里，更无人家，聊吃些儿充饥。”八戒欢喜，上前舒手，就欲取饼。不知行者端详已久，喝一声：“且住！这厮不是好人！休得无礼！你是甚么土地，来诳老孙！看棍！”那老者见他打来，将身一转，化作一阵阴风，呼的一声，把个长老摄将起去，飘飘荡荡，不知摄去何所。慌得那大圣没跟寻处，八戒沙僧俱相顾失色，白马亦只自惊吟。三兄弟连马四口，恍恍忽忽，远望高张，并无一毫下落，前后找寻不题。</p>

<p>却说那老者同鬼使，把长老抬到一座烟霞石屋之前，轻轻放下，与他携手相搀道：“圣僧休怕，我等不是歹人，乃荆棘岭十八公是也。因风清月霁之宵，特请你来会友谈诗，消遣情怀故耳。”那长老却才定性，睁眼仔细观看，真个是：漠漠烟云去所，清清仙境人家。正好洁身修炼，堪宜种竹栽花。每见翠岩来鹤，时闻青沼鸣蛙。更赛天台丹灶，仍期华岳明霞。说甚耕云钓月，此间隐逸堪夸。坐久幽怀如海，朦胧月上窗纱。三藏正自点看，渐觉月明星朗，只听得人语相谈，都道：“十八公请得圣僧来也。”长老抬头观看，乃是三个老者：前一个霜姿丰采，第二个绿鬓婆娑，第三个虚心黛色。各各面貌、衣服俱不相同，都来与三藏作礼。长老还了礼道：“弟子有何德行，敢劳列位仙翁下爱？”十八公笑道：“一向闻知圣僧有道，等待多时，今幸一遇。如果不吝珠玉，宽坐叙怀，足见禅机真派。”三藏躬身道：“敢问仙翁尊号？”十八公道：“霜姿者号孤直公，绿鬓者号凌空子，虚心者号拂云叟，老拙号曰劲节。”三藏道：“四翁尊寿几何？”孤直公道：“我岁今经千岁古，撑天叶茂四时春。香枝郁郁龙蛇状，碎影重重霜雪身。自幼坚刚能耐老，从今正直喜修真。乌栖凤宿非凡辈，落落森森远俗尘。”凌空子笑道：“吾年千载傲风霜，高干灵枝力自刚。夜静有声如雨滴，秋晴荫影似云张。盘根已得长生诀，受命尤宜不老方，留鹤化龙非俗辈，苍苍爽爽近仙乡。”拂云叟笑道：“岁寒虚度有千秋，老景潇然清更幽。不杂嚣尘终冷淡，饱经霜雪自风流。七贤作侣同谈道，六逸为朋共唱酬。戛玉敲金非琐琐，天然情性与仙游。”劲节十八公笑道：“我亦千年约有余，苍然贞秀自如如。堪怜雨露生成力，借得乾坤造化机。万壑风烟惟我盛，四时洒落让吾疏。盖张翠影留仙客，博弈调琴讲道书。”三藏称谢道：“四位仙翁，俱享高寿，但劲节翁又千岁余矣。高年得道，丰采清奇，得非汉时之四皓乎？”四老道：“承过奖！承过奖！吾等非四皓，乃深山之四操也。敢问圣僧，妙龄几何？”三藏合掌躬身答曰：“四十年前出母胎，未产之时命已灾。逃生落水随波滚，幸遇金山脱本骸。</p>

<p>养性看经无懈怠，诚心拜佛敢俄捱？今蒙皇上差西去，路遇仙翁下爱来。”四老俱称道：“圣僧自出娘胎，即从佛教，果然是从小修行，真中正有道之上僧也。我等幸接台颜，敢求大教，望以禅法指教一二，足慰生平。”长老闻言，慨然不惧，即对众言曰：</p>

<p>“禅者静也，法者度也。静中之度，非悟不成。悟者，洗心涤虑，脱俗离尘是也。夫人身难得，中土难生，正法难遇：全此三者，幸莫大焉。至德妙道，渺漠希夷，六根六识，遂可扫除。菩提者，不死不生，无余无欠，空色包罗，圣凡俱遣。访真了元始钳锤，悟实了牟尼手段。发挥象罔，踏碎涅槃。必须觉中觉了悟中悟，一点灵光全保护。放开烈焰照婆娑，法界纵横独显露。至幽微，更守固，玄关口说谁人度？我本元修大觉禅，有缘有志方记悟。”</p>

<p>四老侧耳受了，无边喜悦，一个个稽首皈依，躬身拜谢道：</p>

<p>“圣僧乃禅机之悟本也！”拂云叟道：“禅虽静，法虽度，须要性定心诚，纵为大觉真仙，终坐无生之道。我等之玄，又大不同也。”三藏云：“道乃非常，体用合一，如何不同？”拂云叟笑云：</p>

<p>“我等生来坚实，体用比尔不同。感天地以生身，蒙雨露而滋色。笑傲风霜，消磨日月。一叶不凋，千枝节操。似这话不叩冲虚，你执持梵语。道也者，本安中国，反来求证西方。空费了草鞋，不知寻个甚么？石狮子剜了心肝，野狐涎灌彻骨髓。忘本参禅，妄求佛果，都似我荆棘岭葛藤谜语，萝蓏浑言。此般君子，怎生接引？这等规模，如何印授？必须要检点见前面目，静中自有生涯。没底竹篮汲水，无根铁树生花。灵宝峰头牢着脚，归来雅会上龙华。”三藏闻言叩头拜谢，十八公用手搀扶，孤直公将身扯起，凌空子打个哈哈道：“拂云之言，分明漏泄。圣僧请起，不可尽信。我等趁此月明，原不为讲论修持，且自吟哦逍遥，放荡襟怀也。”拂云叟笑指石屋道：“若要吟哦，且入小庵一茶，何如？”</p>

<p>长老真个欠身，向石屋前观看，门上有三个大字，乃“木仙庵”。遂此同入，又叙了坐次，忽见那赤身鬼使，捧一盘茯苓膏，将五盏香汤奉上。四老请唐僧先吃，三藏惊疑，不敢便吃。那四老一齐享用，三藏却才吃了两块，各饮香汤收去。三藏留心偷看，只见那里玲珑光彩，如月下一般：“水自石边流出，香从花里飘来。满座清虚雅致，全无半点尘埃。那长老见此仙境。</p>

<p>以为得意，情乐怀开，十分欢喜，忍不住念了一句道：“禅心似月迥无尘。”劲节老笑而即联道：“诗兴如天青更新。”孤直公道：“好句漫裁抟锦绣。”凌空子道：“佳文不点唾奇珍。”拂云叟道：“六朝一洗繁华尽，四始重删雅颂分。”三藏道：“弟子一时失口，胡谈几字，诚所谓班门弄斧。适闻列仙之言，清新飘逸，真诗翁也。”劲节老道：“圣僧不必闲叙，出家人全始全终。既有起句，何无结句？望卒成之。”三藏道：“弟子不能，烦十八公结而成篇为妙。”劲节道：“你好心肠！你起的句，如何不肯结果？</p>

<p>悭吝珠玑，非道理也。”三藏只得续后二句云：“半枕松风茶未熟，吟怀潇洒满腔春。”</p>

<p>十八公道：“好个吟怀潇洒满腔春！”孤直公道：“劲节，你深知诗味，所以只管咀嚼，何不再起一篇？”十八公亦慨然不辞道：“我却是顶针字起：春不荣华冬不枯，云来雾往只如无。”凌空子道：“我亦体前顶针二句：无风摇拽婆娑影，有客欣怜福寿图。”拂云叟亦顶针道：“图似西山坚节老，清如南国没心夫。”</p>

<p>孤直公亦顶针道：“夫因侧叶称梁栋，台为横柯作宪乌。”</p>

<p>长老听了，赞叹不已道：“真是阳春白雪，浩气冲霄！弟子不才，敢再起两句。”孤直公道：“圣僧乃有道之士，大养之人也。不必再相联句，请赐教全篇，庶我等亦好勉强而和。”三藏无已，只得笑吟一律曰：“杖锡西来拜法王，愿求妙典远传扬。</p>

<p>金芝三秀诗坛瑞，宝树千花莲蕊香。百尺竿头须进步，十方世界立行藏。修成玉象庄严体，极乐门前是道场。”四老听毕，俱极赞扬。十八公道：“老拙无能，大胆搀越，也勉和一首。”云：</p>

<p>“劲节孤高笑木王，灵椿不似我名扬。山空百丈龙蛇影。泉泌千年琥珀香。解与乾坤生气概，喜因风雨化行藏。衰残自愧无仙骨，惟有苓膏结寿场。”孤直公道：“此诗起句豪雄，联句有力，但结句自谦太过矣，堪羡！堪羡！老拙也和一首。”云：“霜姿常喜宿禽王，四绝堂前大器扬。露重珠缨蒙翠盖，风轻石齿碎寒香。长廊夜静吟声细，古殿秋阴淡影藏。元日迎春曾献寿，老来寄傲在山场。”凌空子笑而言曰：“好诗！好诗！真个是月胁天心，老拙何能为和？但不可空过，也须扯谈几句。”曰：“梁栋之材近帝王，太清宫外有声扬。晴轩恍若来青气，暗壁寻常度翠香。壮节凛然千古秀，深根结矣九泉藏。凌云势盖婆娑影，不在群芳艳丽场。”拂云叟道：“三公之诗，高雅清淡，正是放开锦绣之囊也。我身无力，我腹无才，得三公之教，茅塞顿开，无已，也打油几句，幸勿哂焉。”诗曰：“淇澳园中乐圣王，渭川千亩任分扬。翠筠不染湘娥泪，班箨堪传汉史香。霜叶自来颜不改，烟梢从此色何藏？子猷去世知音少，亘古留名翰墨场。”</p>

<p>三藏道：“众仙老之诗，真个是吐凤喷珠，游夏莫赞。厚爱高情，感之极矣。但夜已深沉，三个小徒，不知在何处等我。意者弟子不能久留，敢此告回寻访，尤天穷之至爱也，望老仙指示归路。”四老笑道：“圣僧勿虑，我等也是千载奇逢，况天光晴爽，虽夜深却月明如昼，再宽坐坐，待天晓自当远送过岭，高徒一定可相会也。”</p>

<p>正话间，只见石屋之外，有两个青衣女童，挑一对绛纱灯笼，后引着一个仙女。那仙女拈着一枝杏花，笑吟吟进门相见。</p>

<p>那仙女怎生模样？他生得：青姿妆翡翠，丹脸赛胭脂。星眼光还彩，蛾眉秀又齐。下衬一条五色梅浅红裙子，上穿一件烟里火比甲轻衣。弓鞋弯凤嘴，绫袜锦绣泥。妖娆娇似天台女，不亚当年俏妲姬。四老欠身问道：“杏仙何来？”那女子对众道了万福道：“知有佳客在此赓酬，特来相访，敢求一见。”十八公指着唐僧道：“佳客在此，何劳求见！”三藏躬身，不敢言语。那女子叫：“快献茶来。”又有两个黄衣女童，捧一个红漆丹盘，盘内有六个细磁茶盂，盂内设几品异果，横担着匙儿，提一把白铁嵌黄铜的茶壶，壶内香茶喷鼻。斟了茶，那女子微露春葱，捧磁盂先奉三藏，次奉四老，然后一盏，自取而陪。</p>

<p>凌空子道：“杏仙为何不坐？”那女子方才去坐。茶毕欠身问道：“仙翁今宵盛乐，佳句请教一二如何？”拂云叟道：“我等皆鄙俚之言，惟圣僧真盛唐之作，甚可嘉羡。”那女子道：“如不吝教，乞赐一观。”四老即以长老前诗后诗并禅法论，宣了一遍。那女子满面春风对众道：“妾身不才，不当献丑。但聆此佳句，似不可虚也，勉强将后诗奉和一律如何？”遂朗吟道：“上盖留名汉武王，周时孔子立坛场。董仙爱我成林积，孙楚曾怜寒食香。雨润红姿娇且嫩，烟蒸翠色显还藏。自知过熟微酸意，落处年年伴麦场。”四老闻诗，人人称贺，都道：“清雅脱尘，句内包含春意。好个雨润红姿娇且嫩，雨润红姿娇且嫩！”那女子笑而悄答道：“惶恐！惶恐！适闻圣僧之章，诚然锦心绣口，如不吝珠玉，赐教一阕如何？”唐僧不敢答应。那女子渐有见爱之情，挨挨轧轧，渐近坐边，低声悄语呼道：“佳客莫者，趁此良宵，不耍子待要怎的？人生光景，能有几何？”十八公道：“杏仙尽有仰高之情，圣僧岂可无俯就之意？如不见怜，是不知趣了也。”孤直公道：“圣僧乃有道有名之士，决不苟且行事。如此样举措，是我等取罪过了。污人名，坏人德，非远达也。果是杏仙有意，可教拂云叟与十八公做媒，我与凌空子保亲，成此姻眷，何不美哉！”</p>

<p>三藏听言，遂变了颜色，跳起来高叫道：“汝等皆是一类邪物，这般诱我！当时只以砥砺之言，谈玄谈道可也，如今怎么以美人局来骗害贫僧！是何道理！”四老见三藏发怒，一个个咬指担惊，再不复言。那赤身鬼使暴躁如雷道：“这和尚好不识抬举！我这姐姐，那些儿不好？他人材俊雅，玉质娇姿，不必说那女工针指，只这一段诗才，也配得过你。你怎么这等推辞！休错过了！孤直公之言甚当，如果不可苟合，待我再与你主婚。”</p>

<p>三藏大惊失色，凭他们怎么胡谈乱讲，只是不从。鬼使又道：</p>

<p>“你这和尚，我们好言好语，你不听从，若是我们发起村野之性，还把你摄了去，教你和尚不得做，老婆不得娶，却不枉为人一世也？”那长老心如金石，坚执不从。暗想道：“我徒弟们不知在那里寻我哩！”说一声，止不住眼中堕泪。那女子陪着笑，挨至身边，翠袖中取出一个蜜合绫汗巾儿与他揩泪，道：“佳客勿得烦恼，我与你倚玉偎香，耍子去来。”长老咄的一声吆喝，跳起身来就走，被那些人扯扯拽拽，嚷到天明。</p>

<p>忽听得那里叫声：“师父！师父！你在那方言语也？”原来那孙大圣与八戒沙僧，牵着马，挑着担，一夜不曾住脚，穿荆度棘，东寻西找，却好半云半雾的，过了八百里荆棘岭西下，听得唐僧吆喝，却就喊了一声。那长老挣出门来，叫声：“悟空，我在这里哩，快来救我！快来救我！”那四老与鬼使，那女子与女童，幌一幌都不见了。须臾间，八戒、沙僧俱到边前道：“师父，你怎么得到此也？”三藏扯住行者道：“徒弟啊，多累了你们了！昨日晚间见的那个老者，言说土地送斋一事，是你喝声要打，他就把我抬到此方。他与我携手相搀，走入门，又见三个老者，来此会我，俱道我做圣僧，一个个言谈清雅，极善吟诗。我与他赓和相攀，觉有夜半时候，又见一个美貌女子执灯火，也来这里会我，吟了一首诗，称我做佳客。因见我相貌，欲求配偶，我方省悟，正不从时，又被他做媒的做媒，保亲的保亲，主婚的主婚，我立誓不肯，正欲挣着要走，与他嚷闹，不期你们到了。一则天明，二来还是怕你，只才还扯扯拽拽，忽然就不见了。”行者道：</p>

<p>“你既与他叙话谈诗，就不曾问他个名字？”三藏道：“我曾问他之号，那老者唤做十八公，号劲节；第二个号孤直公；第三个号凌空子；第四个号拂云叟；那女子，人称他做杏仙。”八戒道：</p>

<p>“此物在于何处？才往那方去了？”三藏道：“去向之方，不知何所，但只谈诗之处，去此不远。”</p>

<p>他三人同师父看处，只见一座石崖，崖上有木仙庵三字。</p>

<p>三藏道：“此间正是。”行者仔细观之，却原来是一株大桧树，一株老柏，一株老松，一株老竹，竹后有一株丹枫。再看崖那边，还有一株老杏，二株腊梅，二株丹桂。行者笑道：“你可曾看见妖怪？”八戒道：“不曾。”行者道：“你不知，就是这几株树木在此成精也。”八戒道：“哥哥怎得知成精者是树？”行者道：“十八公乃松树，孤直公乃柏树，凌空子乃桧树，拂云叟乃竹竿，赤身鬼乃枫树，杏仙即杏树，女童即丹桂、腊梅也。”八戒闻言，不论好歹，一顿钉钯，三五长嘴，连拱带筑，把两颗腊梅、丹桂、老杏、枫杨俱挥倒在地，果然那根下俱鲜血淋漓。三藏近前扯住道：“悟能，不可伤了他！他虽成了气候，却不曾伤我，我等找路去罢。”行者道：“师父不可惜他，恐日后成了大怪，害人不浅也。”那呆子索性一顿钯，将松柏桧竹一齐皆筑倒，却才请师父上马，顺大路一齐西行。毕竟不知前去如何，且听下回分解。</p>
