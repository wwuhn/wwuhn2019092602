<P>Under a False Name Monkey Beats the Demon Hound</P>
<P>Guanyin Appears to Subdue the Demon King</P>
</div>
<P>Matter has always been empty;</P>
<P>Emptiness said to be matter is only natural.</P>
<P>When one penetrates the dhyana of matter's emptiness</P>
<P>There is no need for cinnabar to be refined into elixir.</P>
<P>Rest not when pursuing perfection of virtue and conduct;</P>
<P>Endure suffering to achieve hard-won skills.</P>
<P>Sometimes one only turns to heaven when one's actions are complete,</P>
<P>To win an unchanging and immortal face.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story tells how the Evil Star Matcher had the front and back gates tightly closed while Monkey was hunted for. The din went on till dusk, but no sign of him did they find. The demon king sat in the Flaying Pavilion, where he called his demons together and issued orders to the guards on all the gates to carry bells, shout passwords, beat drums and strike clappers. Everyone was to have an arrow on his bowstring or a sword unsheathed as he took his turn to keep watch during the night. Sun Wukong, who had turned into a fly, was sitting by the gates. Seeing how strict the security was at the front gates he spread his wings and flew to the gateway of the living quarters to take a look. He saw the Golden Queen slumped across a low table, the tears flowing down as she wept quietly in her sorrow, so he flew inside and landed lightly on the loose black clouds of her hair to listen to what she was crying about. A moment later she said tearfully, &#8220;My lord, you and I,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Burnt in an earlier life the incense of separation,</P>
<P>And now I have encountered an evil demon king.</P>
<P>For three years I have been gone: when will we two be reunited?</P>
<P>Great is the grief of mandarin ducks that are parted.</P>
<P>Just when the priest had brought me your message</P>
<P>Our union has been severed once more and the monkey is dead.</P>
<P>Because he was too curious about the golden bells</P>
<P>I long for you now more desperately than ever.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When he heard this Monkey went behind her ear, where he whispered, &#8220;Don't be afraid, Your Majesty. I'm the holy monk, the venerable Sun Wukong, who was sent from your country. I'm still alive. It was all because I was too impatient. I went to your dressing table and stole the golden bells. While you were drinking with the demon king I sneaked out to the pavilion in the front, but I couldn't restrain myself from opening them up to take a look at them. I didn't mean to, but I tore the cotton wool muffling the bells, and the moment they rang flame, smoke and sand came gushing out. I panicked, threw the bells down, turned back into myself, and tried hard to fight my way out with my iron cudgel. When I failed and was scared they'd kill me I turned into a fly, and hid on the door pivot till just now. The demon king has made the security precautions even stricter and he won't open the doors. Will you act like a wife to him and lure him in here to sleep so that I can escape and find some other way of rescuing you?&#8221;</P>
<P>When the queen heard this she shivered and shook, and her hair stood on end as if a spirit were pulling it; she was terrified, as if her heart was being pounded by a pestle. &#8220;Are you a man or a ghost?&#8221; she asked, the tears streaming down.</P>
<P>&#8220;Neither man nor ghost,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;At the moment I've turned into a fly and I'm here. Don't be afraid. Hurry up and ask the demon king here.&#8221; The queen still refused to believe him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop appearing in this nightmare,&#8221; she said in a low voice through her tears.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm not in a nightmare,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;If you don't believe me put your hand out and open it. I'll jump down into it for you to see.&#8221; The queen then put out her open hand. Monkey flew down and landed lightly on her jade palm. He was just like</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A black bean on a lotus flower,</P>
<P>A bee resting on a peony blossom,</P>
<P>A raisin fallen into a hydrangea,</P>
<P>A black spot on a wild lily stalk.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The queen raised her hand and said, &#8220;Holy monk.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm the holy monk transformed,&#8221; Monkey replied. Only then did the queen believe him.</P>
<P>&#8220;When I invite the demon king here what are you going to do?&#8221; she asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;There's an old saying that there's nothing like liquor for ending a life,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and another that there's nothing like liquor for solving any problem. Liquor's very useful stuff. The best thing is to give him plenty to drink. Call one of your personal slave-girls in and let me have a look at her so I can make myself look like her and wait on you. Then I'll be able to make my move.&#8221;</P>
<P>The queen did as he told her. &#8220;Spring Beauty, where are you?&#8221; she called, and a fox with a beautiful face came in round the screen, knelt down and said, &#8220;What orders did Your Majesty call me in to receive?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Tell them to come in and light the silk lanterns, burn some musk, and help me into the front room,&#8221; the queen said. &#8220;Then I shall ask His Majesty to bed.&#8221; Spring Beauty went to the front and called seven or eight deer and fox spirits who lined up on either side of her. They carried two pairs of lanterns and one pair of portable incense-burners. By the time the queen bowed to them with her hands together the Great Sage had already flown off.</P>
<P>Spreading his wings, the splendid Monkey flew straight to the top of Spring Beauty's head, where he pulled out one of his hairs, blew a magic breath on it, and called, &#8220;Change!&#8221; It turned into a sleep insect that landed lightly on Spring Beauty's face. Now when sleep insects reach a human face they crawl into the nostrils, and once they are inside the person goes to sleep. Spring Beauty did indeed start feeling sleepy. She could not keep on her feet, but swayed about and felt dozy as she hurried to where she had been resting before, collapsed head first and fell into a deep sleep. Brother Monkey then jumped down, shook himself, turned into Spring Beauty's exact likeness and went back round the screen to line up with the others.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As the Golden Queen walked into the front part of the palace a little devil saw her and reported to the Evil Star Matcher, &#8220;The queen's here, Your Majesty.&#8221; The demon king hurried out of the Flaying Pavilion to greet her.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; the queen said, &#8220;the smoke and fire have been put out and there's no sign of the thief. As it's late now I've come to urge you to come to bed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How considerate you are, my queen,&#8221; the monster replied utterly delighted to see her. &#8220;The thief was Sun Wukong who defeated my vanguard warrior, then killed my lieutenant and came here disguised as him to fool us. We've searched but can't find a trace of him. It makes me feel uneasy.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The wretch must have got away,&#8221; the queen replied. &#8220;Relax, Your Majesty, stop worrying, and come to bed.&#8221;</P>
<P>Seeing the queen standing there and inviting him so earnestly the demon king could not refuse too insistently, so he told the other demons to be careful with the fires and lamps and be on their guard against robbers before he went to the living quarters at the back with the queen. Monkey, disguised as Spring Beauty, led their way with the other slave girls.</P>
<P>&#8220;Bring wine for His Majesty,&#8221; the queen said. &#8220;He's exhausted.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Indeed I am,&#8221; said the demon king with a smile, &#8220;indeed I am. Fetch some at once. It'll calm our nerves.&#8221; The imitation Spring Beauty and the other servants then laid out fruit and high meat and set a table and chairs. The queen raised a cup and the demon king did likewise; each gave the other a drink from their own.</P>
<P>The imitation Spring Beauty, who was standing beside them, said as she held the jug, &#8220;As tonight is the first time Your Majesties have given each other a drink from your own cups I hope that you will each drain them dry for double happiness.&#8221; They did indeed both refill their cups and drain them again. &#8220;As this is so happy an occasion for Your Majesties why don't we slave girls sing and dance for you?&#8221; the imitation Spring Beauty suggested.</P>
<P>Before the words were all out of her mouth melodious voices could be heard as the singing and dancing began. The two of them drank a lot more before the queen called for the singing and dancing to end. The slave girls divided themselves into their groups and went to line up outside the screen, leaving only the imitation Spring Beauty to hold the jug and serve them wine. The queen and the demon king spoke to each other like husband and wife, and the queen was so full of sensuality that the demon king's bones turned soft and his sinews went numb. The only trouble was that the poor demon was not lucky enough to enjoy her favours. Indeed, it was a case of &#8220;happiness over nothing, like a cat biting a piss bubble.&#8221;</P>
<P>After talking and laughing for a while the queen asked, &#8220;Were the treasures damaged, Your Majesty?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Those are treasures that were cast long, long ago,&#8221; the demon king said, &#8220;so they couldn't possibly be damaged. All that happened was that the thief tore the cotton wool that was muffling the bells and the leopard skin wrapper was burnt.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where have they been put away?&#8221; the queen asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;No need for that,&#8221; the demon king replied. &#8220;I carry them at my waist.&#8221; Hearing this, the imitation Spring Beauty pulled out a handful of his hairs, chewed them up into little bits, crept closer to the demon king, put the pieces of hair on the demon's body, blew three magic breaths, said &#8220;Change!&#8221; very quietly, and turned the pieces of hair into three revolting pests: lice, fleas and bedbugs. They all made for the demon king's body and started biting his skin wildly. Itching unbearably, the demon king put his hands inside his clothing to rub the irritation. He caught a few of the lice between his fingers and took them to a lamp for a closer look.</P>
<P>When the queen saw them she said mockingly, &#8220;Your Majesty, your shirt must be filthy. It can't have been washed for ages. I expect that's why they're there.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've never had insects like these before,&#8221; he said in embarrassment. &#8220;I would have to make a fool of myself tonight.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean, making a fool of yourself, Your Majesty?&#8221; the queen said with a smile. &#8220;As the saying goes, even the emperor has three imperial lice. Undress and I'll catch them for you.&#8221; The demon king really did undo his belt and take his clothes off.</P>
<P>The imitation Spring Beauty was standing beside the demon king looking closely at the fleas leaping around between each layer of clothing, on which were rows of enormous bedbugs. Lice and nits were crowded as closely together as ants coming out of their nest. When the demon king took off the third layer of clothing and revealed his flesh the golden bells were also swarming with countless insects.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; said the imitation Spring Beauty, &#8220;hand me the bells so that I can catch the lice on them for you.&#8221; The demon king was so overcome with shame and alarm that he handed the three bells to Spring Beauty, not noticing that she was an impostor.</P>
<P>The imitation Spring Beauty took the bells and made a long show of catching lice. When she saw the demon king looking down to shake his clothes she hid the golden bells, pulled out a hair and turned it into three more bells just like the originals that she carried to the lamp to examine.</P>
<P>She then wriggled, braced herself, put the lice, bedbugs and fleas back on her body and returned the imitation bells to the monster. He took them but was still too befuddled to see that they were copies. Passing them with both his hands to the queen he said, &#8220;Put them away now, but be very careful with them, not like before.&#8221; The queen took the bells, quietly opened the chest, put them inside, and locked them in with a golden lock. Then she drank several more cups of wine with the demon king.</P>
<P>&#8220;Dust and clean the ivory bed,&#8221; she ordered the serving women, &#8220;and spread the brocade quilt. His Majesty and I are going to bed.&#8221;</P>
<P>The demon king expressed his thanks but said, &#8220;I have no such luck. I don't dare go with you. I'll take one of the palace women with me and go to bed in the Western part of the palace. I wish you a good night by yourself, ma'am.&#8221; With that each of them went to bed, and we will say no more of that.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Meanwhile the successful imitation Spring Beauty tucked the treasures into her belt and turned back into Monkey. He shook himself, took back the sleep insect, and headed for the front of the palace, where nightsticks and bells sounded together to mark the third watch. Splendid Monkey made himself invisible by making a spell with his hands and saying the words of it. Going straight to the gates he saw that they were very firmly locked and bolted, so he brought out his gold-banded cudgel, pointed it at the door and made unlocking magic. The gates swung easily open.</P>
<P>Hurrying outside he stood by the gates and shouted two or three times at the top of his voice, &#8220;Evil Star Matcher, give us back our Golden Queen.&#8221;</P>
<P>This startled all the devils, who hurried to look and saw that the gates were open. Quickly they fetched lamps to find the locks and fasten the gates once more. Several of them were sent running back inside to report, &#8220;Your Majesty, there's someone outside the main gates shouting your title and demanding the Golden Queen.&#8221;</P>
<P>The slave girls hurried out to say very quietly, &#8220;Stop yelling. His Majesty's only just gone to sleep.&#8221; Monkey gave another loud shout at the front gates, but the little devils still dared not disturb their master. This happened three or four times over, but they never went in to report. The Great Sage kept up his din till daybreak, by when his patience was exhausted and he swung his iron cudgel to hit the gates. This so alarmed the demons big and small that while some of them barricaded the gates the others went in to report.</P>
<P>As soon as the demon king woke up and heard the cacophonous din he got up, dressed and emerged from his bed-curtains to ask, &#8220;What's all the shouting about?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; said the kneeling slave girls, &#8220;someone's been shouting and cursing outside the cave half the night. We don't know who it is. Now he's attacking the gates.&#8221;</P>
<P>As the demon king went out through the gates of the palace several panic-stricken little devils appeared to kowtow to him and say, &#8220;There's someone shouting and cursing outside. He's demanding the Golden Queen, and if we say so much as half a 'no' he goes on and on at us, swearing in a thoroughly horrible way. When Your Majesty still hadn't come out at daybreak he got so desperate he started attacking the gates.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't open them,&#8221; the demon king said. &#8220;Go and ask him where he's from and what he's called. Report back as quickly as you can.&#8221;</P>
<P>The little devils hurried off to ask through the gates, &#8220;Who are you, knocking at our gates?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm your grandpa sent by Purpuria to take the Golden Queen back to her own country,&#8221; Monkey replied. When the little devils heard this they reported it to the demon king, who went back to the living quarters at the back to question the queen about why the attacker had come.</P>
<P>The queen had only just arisen and had not yet done her hair or washed when slave girls came in to report, &#8220;His Majesty's here.&#8221; The queen hastily tidied up her clothes and let her black tresses hang loose as she went outside to greet him.</P>
<P>He had just sat down and had not yet asked her any questions when little demons were heard again asking, &#8220;The Grand Par from over there has smashed the gates down.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How many officers are there in your country, ma'am?&#8221; The demon king asked with a smile.</P>
<P>&#8220;Inside the palace there are forty-eight brigades of horse and foot, and a thousand good officers; and there are ever so many marshals and commanders on the frontiers,&#8221; the queen replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Are any called Grand Par?&#8221; the demon king asked. &#8220;When I was in the palace all I knew about was helping His Majesty in the inner quarters and instructing the consorts and concubines every morning and evening,&#8221; the queen said. &#8220;There were no end of things happening outside. How could I possibly remember the names?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This one calls himself Grand Par,&#8221; the demon king replied. &#8220;There's no such name I can think of in the book<I> The Hundred Surnames.</I> You're a very intelligent and well-born lady, ma'am, and you've lived in a royal palace. You must have read a lot of books. Can you remember coming across that name in any of them?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's a passage in the<I> Thousand Word Classic</I> that goes, 'received grand instruction,'&#8220; the queen replied. &#8220;I think that must refer to him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm sure you're right,&#8221; the demon king said with pleasure, &#8220;I'm sure you're right.&#8221; He then got up, took his leave of the queen, went to the Flaying Pavilion, fastened his armor on neatly, mustered his devil soldiers, had the gates opened, and went straight outside with his flower-scattering battle-axe in his hand.</P>
<P>&#8220;Who's the Grand Par from Purpuria?&#8221; he yelled stridently at the top of his voice.</P>
<P>Grasping his gold-banded cudgel in his right hand and pointing with his left Monkey replied, &#8220;What are you shouting at me for, nephew?&#8221; The sight of him drove the demon king into a fury.</P>
<P>&#8220;Damn you,&#8221; he shouted:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've a face just like a monkey's;</P>
<P>You resemble a macaque.</P>
<P>A ghost is what you look like;</P>
<P>Don't try to knock me back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Impudent devil,&#8221; laughed Monkey, &#8220;trying to bully your superiors and push your master around. You're blind. I remember how when I made havoc in Heaven five hundred years ago all the nine heavenly generals only dared speak to me with the greatest respect. If I make you call me Grandpa I'm letting you off lightly.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Tell me your name immediately,&#8221; the demon king shouted. &#8220;What fighting skills have you got that give you the nerve to come rampaging here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You'd have done better not to ask me what I'm called,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;But as you insist on me telling you I'm afraid you'll be in a hopeless mess. Come here and stand still while I tell you:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Heaven and earth were the parents that bore me;</P>
<P>My foetus was formed from the sun and moon's essence.</P>
<P>The magic rock was pregnant for years beyond number;</P>
<P>Strange indeed was the miraculous root's gestation.</P>
<P>When I was born the Three Positives were at their height;</P>
<P>Now I have been converted all is in harmony.</P>
<P>Once I was declared the chief of all the demons,</P>
<P>Who bowed to me by the red cliff as subduer of monsters.</P>
<P>The Jade Emperor issued a decree of summons,</P>
<P>And the Great White Planet came with the edict,</P>
<P>Inviting me to Heaven to take up my office,</P>
<P>But as Protector of the Horses I had no joy.</P>
<P>When I first planned rebellion in my mountain cave</P>
<P>Boldly I led my armies against the Jade Emperor,</P>
<P>The Pagoda-carrying Heavenly King and Prince Nezha</P>
<P>Were utterly helpless when they fought against me.</P>
<P>Then the White Planes made a new suggestion,</P>
<P>And brought another edict urging me to make peace</P>
<P>I was made Great Sage Equaling Heaven,</P>
<P>And proclaimed as one of the pillars of the state.</P>
<P>Because I disrupted the banquet of peaches</P>
<P>And stole elixir when drunk I met with disaster.</P>
<P>Lord Lao Zi submitted a memorial in person,</P>
<P>And the Queen Mother of the West did homage to the throne.</P>
<P>Knowing that I was running riot with the law,</P>
<P>They mustered heavenly forces and issued movement orders.</P>
<P>A hundred thousand vicious stars and evil planets</P>
<P>Were packed in close array with their swords and their halberds.</P>
<P>Heaven-and-earth nets were spread across the mountain</P>
<P>As all of the soldiers raised their weapons together.</P>
<P>A bout of bitter fighting left neither side the victor,</P>
<P>So Guanyin recommended the warrior Erlang.</P>
<P>The two of us fought together for mastery;</P>
<P>He was helped by the Seven Brothers who come from Plum Hill.</P>
<P>Each of us played the hero and did our transformations:</P>
<P>The three sages at the gates of Heaven opened the clouds.</P>
<P>Then Lord Lao Zi dropped his diamond noose,</P>
<P>And the gods led me as a prisoner to the steps of the throne-hall.</P>
<P>They did not bother with a detailed indictment:</P>
<P>The sentence was death by a thousand cuts.</P>
<P>Axe and hammer could not till me,</P>
<P>And I was unharmed by sword or saber.</P>
<P>Fire and thunderbolts were neither here nor there;</P>
<P>They had no way to destroy my immortal body.</P>
<P>I was taken under escort to the Tushita Heaven,</P>
<P>And all was arranged to refine me in the furnace.</P>
<P>Only when full time was up did they open up the vessel,</P>
<P>And I came bounding out from the middle of the crucible.</P>
<P>In my hands I was wielding this As-You-Will cudgel</P>
<P>As I somersaulted up to the Jade Emperor's throne.</P>
<P>All the stars and constellations went into hiding,</P>
<P>And I could play the vandal in the palaces of Heaven.</P>
<P>The Miraculous Investigator rushed to invite the Buddha,</P>
<P>Then Sakyamuni and I both displayed our powers.</P>
<P>Turning my somersaults in the palm of his hand</P>
<P>I roamed all over the heavens before my return.</P>
<P>The Buddha then, using both foresight and deception,</P>
<P>Crushed and held me at the ends of the heavens.</P>
<P>After a period of over five hundred years</P>
<P>My body was delivered and I could once more play up.</P>
<P>Guarding the Tang Priest on his journey to the West,</P>
<P>Brother Sun Wukong is very intelligent.</P>
<P>I subdue the demons on the Westward road:</P>
<P>Every evil spirit is struck with terror.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the demon king heard him tell that he was Sun Wukong he said, &#8220;So you're the so-and-so who made havoc in Heaven. If you were released to guard the Tang Priest on his journey West then you should be an your way there. Why are you being such a busybody and making trouble for me? You're acting as if you were the slave of Purpuria. By coming here you've thrown your life away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Thieving damned monster,&#8221; Monkey shouted back. &#8220;You don't know what you're talking about. I was politely invited to help by the king of Purpuria. He addressed me very respectfully and treated me well. I'm a thousand times higher than that king. He treated me as if I were his father and mother or a god. How can you say I'm acting like a slave? I'll get you, you monster, for bullying your superiors and trying to push your master around. Stay there and take this from your grandpa.&#8221; The monster then moved his hands and feet as fast as he could, dodged the blow from the cudgel and struck back at Brother Monkey's face with his flower-scattering axe. It was a fine battle. Just watch!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The gold-banded As-You-Will cudgel,</P>
<P>The flower-scattering axe and its wind-keen blade.</P>
<P>One ground his teeth with terrible ferocity;</P>
<P>The other gnashed his molars and displayed his might.</P>
<P>One was the Great Sage Equaling Heaven descended to earth,</P>
<P>The other an evil demon king come down to the lower world.</P>
<P>Both snorted out clouds and shining mists that lit up the heavenly palace.</P>
<P>Sent stones and sand flying that blotted out the Dipper.</P>
<P>They came and went through many a movement,</P>
<P>Twisting and turning and giving off golden light.</P>
<P>Each used all of his talents to the full;</P>
<P>Both staked the whole of their magical powers.</P>
<P>One wanted to take the queen back to the capital;</P>
<P>The other would happily have stayed with her in the cave.</P>
<P>There was no deep reason for the struggle:</P>
<P>He was ready to give his life for the sake of the king.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the two of them had fought fifty rounds without result the demon king realized that Monkey was too strong a fighter for him to be able to beat. Blocking the iron cudgel with his axe the demon said, &#8220;Stop, Sun the Novice. I haven't had my breakfast yet today. Let me eat, then I'll have it out with you.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey was well aware that he wanted to fetch the bells, so he put his cudgel away and said, &#8220;A hero doesn't chase an exhausted hare. Off you go. Have a good meal, and get ready to come back and die.&#8221;</P>
<P>The demon quickly turned and rushed inside, where he said to the queen, &#8220;Get me my treasures at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What for?&#8221; she asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The man challenging me to battle this morning was a disciple of the monk who's going to fetch the scriptures,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He's called Sun Wukong, or Sun the Novice, and Grand Par was just a nickname. I've been battling it out with him all this time, but still there's no outcome. Just wait while I take my treasures out and set off smoke and flames to burn that ape.&#8221; These words made the queen feel very uneasy. If she didn't fetch the bells, she was worried that he might be suspicious, but if she did she feared that Sun the Novice would be killed. As she was hesitating the demon king pressed her again: &#8220;Hurry up and fetch them.&#8221; She had no choice but to undo the lock, bring out the three bells and hand them to the demon king, who took them and went outside the cave again. The queen sat in the inner quarters, her tears pouring down like rain, as she thought that Monkey would not possibly be able to escape with his life. Neither of them realized that the bells were only copies.</P>
<P>Once outside the cave the demon stood upwind and shouted, &#8220;Stay where you are, Sun the Novice. Watch while I ring these bells.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You have your bells, but why shouldn't I have mine?&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;You can ring yours, so why shouldn't I ring mine?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What bells have you got?&#8221; the demon king asked. &#8220;Show me.&#8221; Monkey pinched his iron cudgel to make it into an embroidery needle that he tucked into his ear then brought out the three real treasures from at his waist.</P>
<P>&#8220;Here are my purple gold bells,&#8221; he said to the demon king. The sight of them came as a shock to the demon.</P>
<P>&#8220;That's funny,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;very funny. Why are his bells exactly the same as mine? Even if they'd been cast from the same mould they'd not have been properly smoothed: you'd expect some extra marks or missing knobs. How can they be identical with this?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where did you get your bells from?&#8221; he went on to ask again.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are yours from, dear nephew?&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>Being honest, the demon king replied, &#8220;These bells of mine,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Come from deep in the Way of the Immortal of Great Purity,</P>
<P>Are made of gold long refined in the Eight Trigrams Furnace</P>
<P>Formed into bells renowned as ultimate treasures</P>
<P>Left by Lord Lao Zi till the present day.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's where my bells come from too,&#8221; Monkey replied with a smile.</P>
<P>&#8220;How were they made?&#8221; the demon king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;These bells of mine,&#8221; said Monkey,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Were made of gold refined in the furnace</P>
<P>When Lord Lao Zi made elixir in the Tushita Palace.</P>
<P>They are cyclical treasures.</P>
<P>The two threes make six:</P>
<P>Mine are the female and yours are the male.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;The bells are golden elixir treasures,&#8221; the demon king said, &#8220;not birds or beasts. They can't be male or female. As long as they yield what's precious when they're rung they're good ones.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Words prove nothing,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Show it by actions. Shake yours first.&#8221; The demon king then rang his first bell three times. No fire came out. He rang his second three times. No smoke came out. He rang his third three times, and no sand came out either.</P>
<P>&#8220;Very odd,&#8221; he said, making wild gestures, &#8220;very odd. The world's changed. These bells must be hen-pecked. When the males see the females they don't dare to do their stuff.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop, nephew,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Now I'm going to shake mine to show you what happens.&#8221; The splendid ape then grasped all three bells in one hand and rang them together. Watch as clouds of red flames, black smoke and yellow sand all come gushing out, setting the trees and the mountain ablaze. Monkey then said the words of another spell and shouted &#8220;Wind!&#8221; towards the Southeast; and a wind did indeed spring up that fanned the flames. With the power of the wind behind them the flames and smoke filled the heavens, blazing red and deepest black, and the earth was covered by the yellow sandstorm. The Evil Star Matcher's souls fled from his body in his terror, but he had nowhere to turn: amid that fire there was no way of escaping with his life.</P>
<P>Then a penetrating shout was heard from mid-air: &#8220;Sun Wukong, I am here.&#8221; Monkey quickly looked up and saw that it was the Bodhisattva Guanyin holding her vase of pure water in her left hand and a sprig of willow in her right with which to sprinkle sweet dew and put out the flames. In his alarm Monkey hid the bells at his waist, put the palms of his hands together and prostrated himself in a kowtow. The Bodhisattva flicked a few drops of sweet dew from her willow sprig and in an instant both flames and smoke disappeared, while no sign of the yellow sand remained to be seen.</P>
<P>&#8220;I did not realize, Most Merciful One, that you were coming down to the mortal world,&#8221; said Brother Monkey as he kowtowed, &#8220;and it was wrong of me to fail to keep out of your way. May I venture to ask where you are going, Bodhisattva?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am here especially to find and take this evil monster,&#8221; the Bodhisattva replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;What is the monster's background, and how can he put you to the trouble of capturing him in your illustrious person?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;He is a golden-haired giant hound on which I used to ride,&#8221; the Bodhisattva replied. &#8220;The boy in charge of it fell asleep and failed to keep proper guard over it, so that the wicked beast bit through its iron chains and escaped to save the king of Purpuria from disaster.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he hastily bowed and said, &#8220;You have it the wrong way round, Bodhisattva. He's been mistreating the king and his queen, and thus damaging public morality. So how can you say that he has saved the king from disaster when in fact he has brought him disaster?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You would not know,&#8221; the Bodhisattva replied, &#8220;that when the previous king of Purpuria was reigning and the present king was the crown prince and had not yet taken the throne he was a superb archer and huntsman. Once he led his men and horses hunting with falcon and hound. They came to the Fallen Phoenix Slope, where a young peacock and peahen, two children of the Buddha's mother in the West, the Bodhisattva Maurya Vidya Rani were resting. When the king shot with his bow he wounded the cock, while the hen died with an arrow still in her. After the Buddha's mother realized to her regret what had happened she ordered that the prince should be separated from his wife for three years and suffer himself the way birds do when they are parted from their mates. At the time I was riding that hound and we both heard her say that. I never imagined that the beast would remember it and come back to mistreat the queen and thus save the king from disaster. That was three years ago, and now that the misdeed has been paid for it was fortunate that you came along to cure the king. I am here to recover the wicked and evil creature.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Bodhisattva,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;this may well be so, but he did sully the queen, damage public morality, offend ethics and break the law. You can't let him off a non-capital punishment. Let me give him twenty blows before handing him over for you to take back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said the Bodhisattva, &#8220;as you know I am here you really ought to show me the respect I deserve and spare him completely. This still counts as one of your successes in subduing a demon. If you hit him with your cudgel it'll kill him.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey dared not disobey, but bowed and said, &#8220;If you're taking him back to the ocean with you, Bodhisattva, you mustn't let him escape and come down to the human world again. That would be quite a catastrophe.&#8221;</P>
<P>Only then did the Bodhisattva shout, &#8220;Wicked beast! Turn back into your own form! What are you waiting for?&#8221; The monster could be seen doing a roll and turning back into himself. Then he shook his fur for the Bodhisattva to mount on his back. The Bodhisattva looked down at his neck to see that the three golden bells were missing. &#8220;Wukong,&#8221; she said, &#8220;give me my bells back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I don't know where they are,&#8221; Monkey said.</P>
<P>&#8220;Thieving ape,&#8221; the Bodhisattva shouted. &#8220;If you hadn't stolen those bells then ten Sun Wukongs, never mind one, would have dared go nowhere near him. Hand them over at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I really haven't seen them,&#8221; Monkey replied with a smile.</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case I'll have to recite the Band-tightening Spell,&#8221; said the Bodhisattva.</P>
<P>This scared Monkey, who could only plead, &#8220;Don't say it, don't say it. The bells are here.&#8221; This was indeed a case of</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Who could untie the bells from neck of the giant hound?</P>
<P>To find that out ask the one who first fastened them on.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Bodhisattva then placed the bells round the giant hound's neck, and flew up to her high throne. Watch as the</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Four-stalked lotus flowers blazed with fire;</P>
<P>Her whole body was thickly clad in cloth of gold.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We will say no more of how the Great Merciful One returned to the Southern Ocean.</P>
<P>The Great Sage Sun Wukong then tidied up his clothing and charged into the Horndog Gave swinging his iron cudgel and killing to his heart's content. He wiped all the demons out till he reached the inner quarters of the palace and asked the Golden Queen to go back to her country. She prostrated herself to him for a long time. Monkey told her all about how the Bodhisattva had subdued the demon and why she had been separated from her husband. Then he gathered some soft grasses that he twisted together into a long straw dragon.</P>
<P>&#8220;Sit on this, ma'am,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and shut your eyes. Don't be afraid. I'm taking you back to court to see your master.&#8221; The queen followed his instructions carefully while he used his magic power. There was a sound of the wind whistling in her ears.</P>
<P>An hour later he brought her into the city. Bringing his cloud down he said, &#8220;Open your eyes, ma'am.&#8221; When the queen opened her eyes and looked she recognized the phoenix buildings and dragon towers. She was very happy, and getting off the straw dragon she climbed the steps of the throne hall. When the king saw her he came straight down from his dragon throne to take the queen by her jade hand.</P>
<P>He was just going to tell her how much he had missed her when he suddenly collapsed, shouting: &#8220;My hand hurts, my hand hurts.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Look at that mug,&#8221; Pig said, roaring with laughter, &#8220;he's out of luck. No joy for him. The moment he meets her again he gets stung.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Idiot,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;would you dare grab her?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What if I did?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The queen's covered with poisonous spikes,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and she has poison on her hands. In the three years she was with the Evil Star Matcher in Mount Unicorn the monster never had her. If he had, his whole body would have been in agony. Even touching her with his hand made his hand ache.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Then what is to be done about it?&#8221; the officials asked. While all the officials were wondering what to do in the outer palace and the consorts and concubines in the inner palace were full of terror, the Jade and the Silver Queen helped their king to his feet.</P>
<P>Amid-the general alarm a voice was heard in the sky shouting, &#8220;Great Sage, I'm here.&#8221; Brother Monkey looked up, and this is what was to be seen:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The cry of a crane soaring through the heavens,</P>
<P>Then flying straight down to the palace of the king.</P>
<P>Beams of auspicious light shone about;</P>
<P>Clouds of holy vapors drifted all around.</P>
<P>Mists came from the cloak of coconut that covered his body:</P>
<P>Rare were the straw sandals on which he trod.</P>
<P>The fly-whisk in his hand was made of dragon whiskers,</P>
<P>And silken tassels hung around his waist.</P>
<P>He joined human destinies together throughout heaven and earth</P>
<P>As he roamed free and easy all over the world.</P>
<P>He was the Purple Clouds Immortal of the Daluo Heaven,</P>
<P>Come down to earth today to lift an enchantment.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey went over to him to greet him with, &#8220;Where are you going, Zhang Boduan of the Ziyang sect?&#8221;</P>
<P>The True Man of Ziyang came to the front of the hall, bowed and replied, &#8220;Great Sage, the humble immortal Zhang Boduan greets you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where have you come from?&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Three years ago I passed this way when going to a Buddha assembly,&#8221; the True Man said. &#8220;When I saw that the King of Purpuria was suffering the agony of being parted from his wife I was worried that the demon would defile the queen. That would have been an affront to morality and made it hard for the queen to be reunited with the king later on. So I turned an old coconut cloak into a new dress of many colours and gave it to the demon king. He made the queen wear it as her wedding dress. As soon as she put it on poisonous barbs grew all over her body. They were the coconut cloak. Now that you have been successful, Great Sage, I've come to lift the spell.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;thank you for coming so far. Please remove the barbs at once.&#8221; The True Man stepped forward, pointed at the queen, and removed the coconut cloak. The queen's body was once more as it had originally been.</P>
<P>The True Man shook the cloak, put it over his shoulders, and said to Monkey, &#8220;Please forgive me if I leave now, Great Sage.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't go yet,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Wait till the king has thanked you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I won't trouble him,&#8221; said the True Man with a smile, then raised his hands together in salute, rose up into the sky and went. The king, queen and the officials high and low were so astonished that they all bowed to the sky.</P>
<P>When the bowing was over the king ordered that the Eastern hall of the palace be thrown open so that they could give thanks to the four monks. The king led all his officials to go down on their knees and kowtow to them, and husband and wife were reunited. In the middle of the celebratory banquet Monkey said, &#8220;Master, bring out that declaration of war.&#8221;</P>
<P>The venerable elder produced it from his sleeve and handed it to Monkey, who passed it in turn to the king. &#8220;This was a letter that the demons sent his lieutenant to deliver,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;He was the officer I killed and brought here as a trophy. Then I turned myself into the officer and went back to the cave to report. That was how I saw Her Majesty and stole the golden bells. He almost caught me, but I did another change, stole them again, got them out and fought him. It was lucky for him that the Bodhisattva Guanyin came to collect him and tell me why you and Her Majesty were parted.&#8221;</P>
<P>He told the whole story from beginning to end in great detail. Everyone in the country&#8212;whether ruler or ministers, whether within the palace or outside&#8212;expressed admiration and gratitude.</P>
<P>&#8220;In the first place,&#8221; said the Tang Priest, &#8220;it was because of Your Majesty's own good fortune, and in the second place it was thanks to my disciple's efforts. We are deeply obliged to you for this sumptuous banquet today, and now we must take our leave of you. Please do not delay us poor monks on our pilgrimage to the West.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the king realized that his efforts to keep them there would be of no avail he inspected and returned the passport and arranged a great procession of royal coaches. The Tang Priest was invited to sit in his own dragon carriage, while the king, his queens and his consorts themselves all pushed it along as they saw them on their way then bade them farewell. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He was fated to have his melancholy washed clean away:</P>
<P>The mind finds peace of itself when thought and worrying cease.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you do not know what of good or ill lay in store for them on the way ahead listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<div class="title">
<p>行者假名降怪犼</p>
<p>观音现象伏妖王</p>
</div>
<p>色即空兮自古，空言是色如然。人能悟彻色空禅，何用丹砂炮炼。德行全修休懈，工夫苦用熬煎。有时行满始朝天，永驻仙颜不变。话说那赛太岁紧关了前后门户，搜寻行者，直嚷到黄昏时分，不见踪迹。坐在那剥皮亭上，点聚群妖，发号施令，都教各门上提铃喝号，击鼓敲梆，一个个弓上弦，刀出鞘，支更坐夜。原来孙大圣变做个痴苍蝇，钉在门旁，见前面防备甚紧，他即抖开翅，飞入后宫门首看处，见金圣娘娘伏在御案上，清清滴泪，隐隐声悲。行者飞进门去，轻轻的落在他那乌云散髻之上，听他哭的甚么。少顷间，那娘娘忽失声道：“主公啊！</p>

<p>我和你：前生烧了断头香，今世遭逢泼怪王。拆凤三年何日会？</p>

<p>分鸳两处致悲伤。差来长老才通信，惊散佳姻一命亡。只为金铃难解识，相思又比旧时狂。”行者闻言，即移身到他耳根后，悄悄的叫道：“圣宫娘娘，你休恐惧，我还是你国差来的神僧孙长老，未曾伤命。只因自家性急，近妆台偷了金铃，你与妖王吃酒之时，我却脱身私出了前亭，忍不住打开看看。不期扯动那塞口的绵花，那铃响一声，迸出烟火黄沙。我就慌了手脚，把金铃丢了，现出原身，使铁棒，苦战不出，恐遭毒手，故变作一个苍蝇儿，钉在门枢上，躲到如今。那妖王愈加严紧，不肯开门。</p>

<p>你可去再以夫妻之礼，哄他进来安寝，我好脱身行事，别作区处救你也。”娘娘一闻此言，战兢兢发似神揪，虚怯怯心如杵筑，泪汪汪的道：“你如今是人是鬼？”行者道：“我也不是人，我也不是鬼，如今变作个苍蝇儿在此。你休怕，快去请那妖王也。”娘娘不信，泪滴滴悄语低声道：“你莫魇寐我。”行者道：</p>

<p>“我岂敢魇寐你？你若不信，展开手，等我跳下来你看。”那娘娘真个把左手张开，行者轻轻飞下，落在他玉掌之间，好便似：菡萏蕊头钉黑豆，牡丹花上歇游蜂；绣球心里葡萄落，百合枝边黑点浓。金圣宫高擎玉掌，叫声神僧，行者嘤嘤的应道：“我是神僧变的。”那娘娘方才信了，悄悄的道：“我去请那妖王来时，你却怎生行事？”行者道：“古人云，断送一生惟有酒。又云，破除万事无过酒。酒之为用多端，你只以饮酒为上，你将那贴身的侍婢，唤一个进来，指与我看，我就变作他的模样，在旁边伏侍，却好下手。”那娘娘真个依言，即叫：“春娇何在？”那屏风后转出一个玉面狐狸来，跪下道：“娘娘唤春娇有何使令？”娘娘道：“你去叫他们来点纱灯，焚脑麝，扶我上前庭，请大王安寝也。”那春娇即转前面，叫了七八个怪鹿妖狐，打着两对灯龙，一对提炉，摆列左右。娘娘欠身叉手，那大圣早已飞去。好行者，展开翅，径飞到那玉面狐狸头上，拔下一根毫毛，吹口仙气，叫“变！”变作一个瞌睡虫，轻轻的放在他脸上。原来瞌睡虫到了人脸上，往鼻孔里爬，爬进孔中，即瞌睡了。那春娇果然渐觉困倦，立不住脚，摇桩打盹，即忙寻着原睡处，丢倒头只情呼呼的睡起。行者跳下来，摇身一变，变做那春娇一般模样，转屏风与众排立不题。</p>

<p>却说那金圣宫娘娘往前正走，有小妖看见，即报赛太岁道：“大王，娘娘来了。”那妖王急出剥皮亭外迎迓，娘娘道：“大王啊，烟火既息，贼已无踪，深夜之际，特请大王安置。”那妖满心欢喜道：“娘娘珍重，却才那贼乃是孙悟空。他败了我先锋，打杀我小校，变化进来，哄了我们，我们这般搜检，他却渺无踪迹，故此心上不安。”娘娘道：“那厮想是走脱了。大王放心勿虑，且自安寝去也。”妖精见娘娘侍立敬请，不敢坚辞，只得吩咐群妖，各要小心火烛，谨防盗贼，遂与娘娘径往后宫。行者假变春娇，从两班侍婢引入。娘娘叫：“安排酒来与大王解劳。”妖王笑道：“正是正是，快将酒来，我与娘娘压惊。”假春娇即同众怪铺排了果品，整顿些腥肉，调开桌椅。那娘娘擎杯，这妖王也以一杯奉上，二人穿换了酒杯。假春娇在旁执着酒壶道：“大王与娘娘今夜才递交杯盏，请各饮干，穿个双喜杯儿。”真个又各斟上，又饮干了。假春娇又道：“大王娘娘喜会，众侍婢会唱的供唱，善舞的起舞来耶。”说未毕，只听得一派歌声，齐调音律，唱的唱，舞的舞。他两个又饮了许多。娘娘叫住了歌舞。众侍婢分班，出屏风外摆列，惟有假春娇执壶，上下奉酒。娘娘与那妖王专说得是夫妻之话。你看那娘娘一片云情雨意，哄得那妖王骨软筋麻，只是没福，不得沾身。可怜！真是猫咬尿胞空欢喜！</p>

<p>叙了一会，笑了一会，娘娘问道：“大王，宝贝不曾伤损么？”妖王道：“这宝贝乃先天抟铸之物，如何得损！只是被那贼扯开塞口之绵，烧了豹皮包袱也。”娘娘说：“怎生收拾？”妖王道：“不用收拾，我带在腰间哩。”假春娇闻得此言，即拔下毫毛一把，嚼得粉碎，轻轻挨近妖王，将那毫毛放在他身上，吹了三口仙气，暗暗的叫“变！”那些毫毛即变做三样恶物，乃虱子、虼蚤、臭虫，攻入妖王身内，挨着皮肤乱咬。那妖王燥痒难禁，伸手入怀揣摸揉痒，用指头捏出几个虱子来，拿近灯前观看。娘娘见了，含忖道：“大王，想是衬衣禳了，久不曾浆洗，故生此物耳。”妖王惭愧道：“我从来不生此物，可可的今宵出丑。”娘娘笑道：“大王何为出丑？常言道，皇帝身上也有三个御虱哩。且脱下衣服来，等我替你捉捉。”妖王真个解带脱衣。假春娇在旁，着意看着那妖王身上，衣服层层皆有虼蚤跳，件件皆排大臭虫；子母虱，密密浓浓，就如蝼蚁出窝中。不觉的揭到第三层见肉之处，那金铃上纷纷垓垓的，也不胜其数。假春娇道：“大王，拿铃子来，等我也与你捉捉虱子。”那妖王一则羞，二则慌，却也不认得真假，将三个铃儿递与假春娇。假春娇接在手中，卖弄多时，见那妖王低着头抖这衣服，他即将金铃藏了，拔下一根毫毛，变作三个铃儿，一般无二，拿向灯前翻检；却又把身子扭扭捏捏的，抖了一抖，将那虱子、臭虫、虼蚤，收了归在身上，把假金铃儿递与那怪。那怪接在手中，一发朦胧无措，那里认得甚么真假，双手托着那铃儿，递与娘娘道：“今番你却收好了，却要仔细仔细，不要象前一番。”那娘娘接过来，轻轻的揭开衣箱，把那假铃收了，用黄金锁锁了，却又与妖王叙饮了几杯酒，教侍婢：“净拂牙床，展开锦被，我与大王同寝。”那妖王诺诺连声道：“没福！没福！不敢奉陪，我还带个宫女往西宫里睡去，娘娘请自安置。”遂此各归寝处不题。</p>

<p>却说假春娇得了手，将他宝贝带在腰间，现了本象，把身子抖一抖，收去那个瞌睡虫儿，径往前走，只听得梆铃齐响，紧打三更。好行者，捏着诀，念动真言，使个隐身法，直至门边。又见那门上拴锁甚密，却就取出金箍棒，望门一指，使出那解锁之法，那门就轻轻开了，急拽步出门站下，厉声高叫道：“赛太岁！还我金圣娘娘来！”连叫两三遍，惊动大小群妖，急急看处，前门开了，即忙掌灯寻锁，把门儿依然锁上，着几个跑入里边去报道：“大王！有人在大门外呼唤大王尊号，要金圣娘娘哩！”</p>

<p>那里边侍婢即出宫门，悄悄的传言道：“莫吆喝，大王才睡着了。”行者又在门前高叫，那小妖又不敢去惊动。如此者三四遍，俱不敢去通报。那大圣在外嚷嚷闹闹的，直弄到天晓，忍不住手轮着铁棒上前打门。慌得那大小群妖，顶门的顶门，报信的报信。那妖王一觉方醒，只闻得乱撺撺的喧哗，起身穿了衣服，即出罗帐之外问道：“嚷甚么？”众侍婢才跪下道：“爷爷，不知是甚人在洞外叫骂了半夜，如今却又打门。”妖王走出宫门，只见那几个传报的小妖，慌张张的磕头道：“外面有人叫骂，要金圣宫娘娘哩！若说半个不字，他就说出无数的歪话，甚不中听。见天晓大王不出，逼得打门也。”那妖道：“且休开门，你去问他是那里来的，姓甚名谁，快来回报。”小妖急出去，隔门问道：“打门的是谁？”行者道：“我是朱紫国拜请来的外公，来取圣宫娘娘回国哩！”那小妖听得，即以此言回报。那妖随往后宫，查问来历。原来那娘娘才起来，还未梳洗，早见侍婢来报：</p>

<p>“爷爷来了。”那娘娘急整衣，散挽黑云，出宫迎迓。才坐下，还未及问，又听得小妖来报：“那来的外公已将门打破矣。”那妖笑道：“娘娘，你朝中有多少将帅？”娘娘道：“在朝有四十八卫人马，良将千员，各边上元帅总兵，不计其数。”妖王道：“可有个姓外的么？”娘娘道：“我在宫，只知内里辅助君王，早晚教诲妃嫔，外事无边，我怎记得名姓！”妖王道：“这来者称为外公，我想着百家姓上，更无个姓外的。娘娘赋性聪明，出身高贵，居皇宫之中，必多览书籍。记得那本书上有此姓也？”娘娘道：“止千字文上有句外受傅训，想必就是此矣。”</p>

<p>妖王喜道：“定是！定是！”即起身辞了娘娘，到剥皮亭上，结束整齐，点出妖兵，开了门，直至外面，手持一柄宣花钺斧，厉声高叫道：“那个是朱紫国来的外公？”行者把金箍棒攥在右手，将左手指定道：“贤甥，叫我怎的？”那妖王见了，心中大怒道：“你这厮：相貌若猴子，嘴脸似猢狲。七分真是鬼，大胆敢欺人！”行者笑道：“你这个诳上欺君的泼怪，原来没眼！想我五百年前大闹天宫时，九天神将见了我，无一个老字，不敢称呼，你叫我声外公，那里亏了你！”妖王喝道：“快早说出姓甚名谁，有些甚么武艺，敢到我这里猖獗！”行者道：“你若不问姓名犹可，若要我说出姓名，只怕你立身无地！你上来，站稳着，听我道：</p>

<p>生身父母是天地，日月精华结圣胎。仙石怀抱无岁数，灵根孕育甚奇哉。当年产我三阳泰，今日归真万会谐。曾聚众妖称帅首，能降众怪拜丹崖。玉皇大帝传宣旨，太白金星捧诏来。请我上天承职裔，官封弼马不开怀。初心造反谋山洞，大胆兴兵闹御阶。托塔天王并太子，交锋一阵尽猥衰。金星复奏玄穹帝，再降招安敕旨来。封做齐天真大圣，那时方称栋梁材。又因搅乱蟠桃会，仗酒偷丹惹下灾。太上老君亲奏驾，西池王母拜瑶台。情知是我欺王法，即点天兵发火牌。十万凶星并恶曜，干戈剑戟密排排。天罗地网漫山布，齐举刀兵大会垓。恶斗一场无胜败，观音推荐二郎来，两家对敌分高下，他有梅山兄弟侪。</p>

<p>各逞英雄施变化，天门三圣拨云开。老君丢了金钢套，众神擒我到金阶。不须详允书供状，罪犯凌迟杀斩灾。斧剁锤敲难损命，刀轮剑砍怎伤怀！火烧雷打只如此，无计摧残长寿胎。押赴太清兜率院，炉中煅炼尽安排。日期满足才开鼎，我向当中跳出来。手挺这条如意棒，翻身打上玉龙台。各星各象皆潜躲，大闹天宫任我歪。巡视灵官忙请佛，释伽与我逞英才。手心之内翻筋斗，游遍周天去复来。佛使先知赚哄法，被他压住在天崖。到今五百余年矣，解脱微躯又弄乖。特保唐僧西域去，悟空行者甚明白。西方路上降妖怪，那个妖邪不惧哉！”那妖王听他说出悟空行者，遂道：“你原来是大闹天宫的那厮，你既脱身保唐僧西去，你走你的路去便罢了。怎么罗织管事，替那朱紫国为奴，却到我这里寻死！”行者喝道：“贼泼怪！说话无知！我受朱紫国拜请之礼，又蒙他称呼管待之恩，我老孙比那王位还高千倍，他敬之如父母，事之如神明，你怎么说出为奴二字！我把你这诳上欺君之怪，不要走！吃外公一棒！”那妖慌了手脚，即闪身躲过，使宣花斧劈面相迎。这一场好杀！你看：金箍如意棒，风刃宣花斧。一个咬牙发狠凶，一个切齿施威武。这个是齐天大圣降临凡，那个是作怪妖王来下土。两个喷云嗳雾照天宫，真是走石扬沙遮斗府。往往来来解数多，翻翻复复金光吐。齐将本事施，各把神通赌。这个要取娘娘转帝都，那个喜同皇后居山坞。这场都是没来由，舍死忘生因国主。他两个战经五十回合，不分胜负。那妖王见行者手段高强，料不能取胜，将斧架住他的铁棒道：“孙行者，你且住了。我今日还未早膳，待我进了膳，再来与你定雌雄。”行者情知是要取铃铛，收了铁棒道：“好汉子不赶乏兔儿，你去你去！吃饱些，好来领死！”</p>

<p>那妖急转身闯入里边，对娘娘道：“快将宝贝拿来！”娘娘道：“要宝贝何干？”妖王道：“今早叫战者，乃是取经的和尚之徒，叫做孙悟空行者，假称外公。我与他战到此时，不分胜负。</p>

<p>等我拿宝贝出去，放些烟火，烧这猴头。”娘娘见说，心中怛突：</p>

<p>欲不取出铃儿，恐他见疑；欲取出铃儿，又恐伤了孙行者性命。</p>

<p>正自踌躇未定，那妖王又催逼道：“快拿出来！”这娘娘无奈，只得将锁钥开了，把三个铃儿递与妖王。妖王拿了，就走出洞。娘娘坐在宫中，泪如雨下，思量行者不知可能逃得性命。两人却俱不知是假铃也。那妖出了门，就占起上风，叫道：“孙行者休走！看我摇摇铃儿！”行者笑道：“你有铃，我就没铃？你会摇，我就不会摇？”妖王道：“你有甚么铃儿，拿出来我看。”行者将铁棒捏做个绣花针儿，藏在耳内，却去腰间解下三个真宝贝来，对妖王说：“这不是我的紫金铃儿？”妖王见了，心惊道：“跷蹊！跷蹊！他的铃儿怎么与我的铃儿就一般无二！纵然是一个模子铸的，好道打磨不到，也有多个瘢儿，少个蒂儿，却怎么这等一毫不差？”又问：“你那铃儿是那里来的？”行者道：“贤甥，你那铃儿却是那里来的。”妖王老实，便就说道：“我这铃儿是：太清仙君道源深，八卦炉中久炼金。结就铃儿称至宝，老君留下到如今。”行者笑道：“老孙的铃儿，也是那时来的。”妖王道：“怎生出处？”行者道：“我这铃儿是：道祖烧丹兜率宫，金铃抟炼在炉中。二三如六循环宝，我的雌来你的雄。”妖王道：“铃儿乃金丹之宝，又不是飞禽走兽，如何辨得雌雄？但只是摇出宝来，就是好的！”行者道：“口说无凭，做出便见，且让你先摇。”那妖王真个将头一个铃儿幌了三幌，不见火出；第二个幌了三幌，不见烟出；第三个幌了三幌，也不见沙出。妖王慌了手脚道：“怪哉！怪哉！世情变了！这铃儿想是惧内，雄见了雌，所以不出来了。”行者道：“贤甥，住了手，等我也摇摇你看。”好猴子，一把攥了三个铃儿，一齐摇起。你看那红火、青烟、黄沙，一齐滚出，骨都都燎树烧山！大圣口里又念个咒语，望巽地上叫：“风来！”真个是风催火势，火挟风威，红焰焰，黑沉沉，满天烟火，遍地黄沙！把那赛太岁唬得魄散魂飞，走头无路，在那火当中，怎逃性命！</p>

<p>只闻得半空中厉声高叫：“孙悟空！我来了也！”行者急回头上望，原来是观音菩萨，左手托着净瓶，右手拿着杨柳，洒下甘露救火哩，慌得行者把铃儿藏在腰间，即合掌倒身下拜。那菩萨将柳枝连拂几点甘露，霎时间，烟火俱无，黄沙绝迹。行者叩头道：“不知大慈临凡，有失回避。敢问菩萨何往？”菩萨道：</p>

<p>“我特来收寻这个妖怪。”行者道：“这怪是何来历，敢劳金身下降收之？”菩萨道：“他是我跨的个金毛犼。因牧童盹睡，失于防守，这孽畜咬断铁索走来，却与朱紫国王消灾也。”行者闻言急欠身道：“菩萨反说了，他在这里欺君骗后，败俗伤风，与那国王生灾，却说是消灾，何也？”菩萨道：“你不知之，当时朱紫国先王在位之时，这个王还做东宫太子，未曾登基，他年幼间，极好射猎。他率领人马，纵放鹰犬，正来到落凤坡前，有西方佛母孔雀大明王菩萨所生二子，乃雌雄两个雀雏，停翅在山坡之下，被此王弓开处，射伤了雄孔雀，那雌孔雀也带箭归西。佛母忏悔以后，吩咐教他拆凤三年，身耽啾疾。那时节，我跨着这犼，同听此言，不期这孽畜留心，故来骗了皇后，与王消灾。至今三年，冤愆满足，幸你来救治王患，我特来收妖邪也。”行者道：“菩萨，虽是这般故事，奈何他玷污了皇后，败俗伤风，坏伦乱法，却是该他死罪。今蒙菩萨亲临，饶得他死罪，却饶不得他活罪。让我打他二十棒，与你带去罢。”菩萨道：“悟空，你既知我临凡，就当看我分上，一发都饶了罢，也算你一番降妖之功。</p>

<p>若是动了棍子，他也就是死了。”行者不敢违言，只得拜道：“菩萨既收他回海，再不可令他私降人间，贻害不浅！”那菩萨才喝了一声：“孽畜！还不还原，待何时也！”只见那怪打个滚，现了原身，将毛衣抖抖，菩萨骑上。菩萨又望项下一看，不见那三个金铃。菩萨道：“悟空，还我铃来。”行者道：“老孙不知。”菩萨喝道：“你这贼猴！若不是你偷了这铃，莫说一个悟空，就是十个，也不敢近身！快拿出来！”行者笑道：“实不曾见。”菩萨道：“既不曾见，等我念念《紧箍儿咒》。”那行者慌了，只教：“莫念莫念！铃儿在这里哩！”这正是：犼项金铃何人解？解铃人还问系铃人。菩萨将铃儿套在犼项下，飞身高坐。你看他四足莲花生焰焰，满身金缕迸森森，大慈悲回南海不题。</p>

<p>却说孙大圣整束了衣裙，轮铁棒打进獬豸洞去，把群妖众怪，尽情打死。剿除干净。直至宫中，请圣宫娘娘回国，那娘娘顶礼不尽。行者将菩萨降妖并拆凤原由备说了一遍，寻些软草，扎了一条草龙，教：“娘娘跨上，合着眼莫怕，我带你回朝见主也。”那娘娘谨遵吩咐，行者使起神通，只听得耳内风响。半个时辰，带进城，按落云头叫：“娘娘开眼。”那皇后睁开眼看，认得是凤阁龙楼，心中欢喜，撇了草龙，与行者同登宝殿。那国王见了，急下龙床，就来扯娘娘玉手，欲诉离情，猛然跌倒在地，只叫：“手疼！手疼！”八戒哈哈大笑道：“嘴脸！没福消受！</p>

<p>一见面就蛰杀了也！”行者道：“呆子，你敢扯他扯儿么？”八戒道：“就扯他扯儿便怎的？”行者道：“娘娘身上生了毒刺，手上有蜇阳之毒。自到麒麟山，与那赛太岁三年，那妖更不曾沾身，但沾身就害身疼，但沾手就害手疼。”众官听说，道：“似此怎生奈何？”此时外面众官忧疑，内里妃嫔悚惧，旁有玉圣、银圣二宫，将君王扶起。俱正在仓皇之际，忽听得那半空中，有人叫道：“大圣，我来也。”行者抬头观看，只见那：肃肃冲天鹤唳，飘飘径至朝前。缭绕祥光道道，氤氲瑞气翩翩。棕衣苫体放云烟，足踏芒鞋罕见。手执龙须蝇帚，丝绦腰下围缠。乾坤处处结人缘，大地逍遥游遍。此乃是大罗天上紫云仙，今日临凡解魇。行者上前迎住道：“张紫阳何往？”紫阳真人直至殿前，躬身施礼道：“大圣，小仙张伯端起手。”行者答礼道：“你从何来？”真人道：“小仙三年前曾赴佛会，因打这里经过，见朱紫国王有拆凤之忧，我恐那妖将皇后玷辱，有坏人伦，后日难与国王复合。是我将一件旧棕衣变作一领新霞裳，光生五彩，进与妖王，教皇后穿了妆新。那皇后穿上身，即生一身毒刺，毒刺者，乃棕毛也。今知大圣成功，特来解魇。”行者道：“既如此，累你远来，且快解脱。”真人走向前，对娘娘用手一指，即脱下那件棕衣，那娘娘遍体如旧。真人将衣抖一抖，披在身上，对行者道：“大圣勿罪，小仙告辞。”行者道：“且住，待君王谢谢。”真人笑道：“不劳，不劳。”遂长揖一声，腾空而去，慌得那皇帝、皇后及大小众臣，一个个望空礼拜。</p>

<p>拜毕，即命大开东阁，酬谢四僧。那君王领众跪拜，夫妻才得重谐。正当欢宴时，行者叫：“师父，拿那战书来。”长老袖中取出递与行者，行者递与国王道：“此书乃那怪差小校送来者。</p>

<p>那小校已先被我打死，送来报功。后复至山中，变作小校，进洞回复，因得见娘娘，盗出金铃，几乎被他拿住；又变化，复偷出，与他对敌。幸遇观音菩萨将他收去，又与我说拆凤之故。”从头至尾，细说了一遍。那举国君臣内外，无一人不感谢称赞。唐僧道：“一则是贤王之福，二来是小徒之功。今蒙盛宴，至矣！至矣！就此拜别，不要误贫僧向西去也。”那国王恳留不得，遂换了关文，大排銮驾，请唐僧稳坐龙车，那君王妃后俱捧毂推轮，相送而别。正是：有缘洗尽忧疑病，绝念无思心自宁。毕竟这去后面再有甚么吉凶之事，且听下回分解。</p>
