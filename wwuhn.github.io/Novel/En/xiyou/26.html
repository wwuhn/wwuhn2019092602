<P>The Immortal Zhen Yuan Captures the Pilgrim Priest</P>
<P>Monkey Makes Havoc in the Wuzhuang Temple</P>
	</div>



<P>&#8220;The meal is cooked,&#8221; the three disciples said as they entered the hall, &#8220;what did you call us for?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm not asking about the meal, disciples,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;This temple has things called manfruit or something that look like babies. Which of you stole and ate some?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I don't know anything about it, honest I don't&#8212;I never saw any,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;That grinning one did it,&#8221; said Pure Wind, &#8220;that grinning one.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've had a smile on my face all my life,&#8221; shouted Monkey. &#8220;Are you going to stop me smiling just because you can't find some fruit or other?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't lose your temper, disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;As men of religion we should control our tongues and not eat food that befuddles our minds. If you ate their fruit you should apologize to them, instead of trying to brazen it out like this.&#8221;</P>
<P>Seeing that his master was talking sense, Brother Monkey began to tell the truth. &#8220;I didn't start it, master,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Pig heard the Taoist boys eating something called manfruit next door to him and wanted to try one himself. He made me go and get three so that we three disciples could have one each. But now they've been eaten, there's no point in waiting around here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How can these priests deny that they are criminals when they've stolen four of our manfruits?&#8221; said Bright Moon.</P>
<P>&#8220;Amitabha Buddha,&#8221; exclaimed Pig, &#8220;if he pinched four of them why did he only share out three? He must have done the dirty on us.&#8221; He continued to shout wildly in this vein.</P>
<P>Now that they knew that the fruit really had been stolen, the two boys started to abuse them even more foully. The Great Sage ground his teeth of steel in his fury, glaring with his fiery eyes and tightening his grip on his iron cudgel. &#8220;Damn those Taoist boys,&#8221; he thought when he could restrain himself no longer. &#8220;If they'd hit us we could have taken it, but now they're insulting us to our faces like this, I'll finish their tree off, then none of them can have any more fruit.&#8221;</P>
<P>Splendid Monkey. He pulled a hair out from the back of his head, breathed a magic breath on it, said &#8220;Change,&#8221; and turned it into an imitation Monkey who stayed with the Tang Priest, Pig and Friar Sand to endure the cursing and swearing of the Taoist boys, while the real Monkey used his divine powers to leap out of the hall by cloud. He went straight to the garden and struck the manfruit tree with his gold-banded cudgel. Then he used his supernatural strength that could move mountains to push the tree over with a single shove. The leaves fell, the branches splayed out, and the roots came out of the ground. The Taoists would have no more of their &#8220;Grass-returning Cinnabar.&#8221; After pushing the tree over Monkey searched through the branches for manfruit, but he could not find a single one. These treasures dropped at the touch of metal, and as Monkey's cudgel was ringed with gold, while being made of iron, another of the five metals, one tap from it brought them all tumbling down, and when they hit the ground they went straight in, leaving none on the tree. &#8220;Great, great, great,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that'll make them all cool down.&#8221; He put the iron cudgel away, went back to the front of the temple, shook the magic hair, and put it back on his head. The others did not see what was happening as they had eyes of mortal flesh.</P>
<P>A long time later, when the two Taoist boys felt that they had railed at them for long enough, Pure Wind said to Bright Moon, &#8220;These monks will take anything we say. We've sworn at them as if we were swearing at chickens, but they haven't admitted anything. I don't think they can have stolen any, after all. The tree is so tall and the foliage is so dense that we may well have miscounted, and if we have, we shouldn't be cursing them so wildly. Let's go and check the number again.&#8221; Bright Moon agreed, and the pair of them went back to the garden. When they saw that the tree was down with its branches bent out, the leaves fallen, and the fruit gone, they were horror-struck. Pure Wind's knees turned soft and he collapsed, while Bright Moon trembled and shook. Both of them passed out, and there is a verse to describe them:</P>


<P>When Sanzang came to the Mountain of Infinite Longevity,</P>
<P>Monkey finished the Grass-returning Cinnabar.</P>
<P>The branches were splayed out, the leaves fallen, and the tree down.</P>
<P>Bright Moon and Pure Wind's hearts both turned to ice.</P>


<P>The two of them lay in the dirt mumbling deliriously and saying, &#8220;What are we to do, what are we to do? The elixir of our Wuzhuang Temple has been destroyed and our community of Immortals is finished. Whatever are we going to say to the master when he comes back?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop moaning, brother,&#8221; said Bright Moon. &#8220;We must tidy ourselves up and not let those monks know anything's wrong. That hairy-faced sod who looks like a thunder god must have done it. He must have used magic to destroy our treasure. But it's useless to argue with him as he'll deny everything, and if we start a quarrel with him and fighting breaks out, we two haven't a chance against the four of them. We'll have to fool them and say that no fruit is missing. We'll pretend we counted wrong before, and apologize to them. Their rice is cooked, and we can give them a few side dishes to eat with it. The moment they've each got a bowl of food you and I will stand on either side of the door, slam it shut, and lock it. After that we can lock all the gates, then they won't be able to get away. When our master comes back he can decide what to do with them. That old monk is a friend of his, so our master may want to forgive him as a favour. And if he doesn't feel forgiving, we've got the criminals under arrest and may possibly not get into trouble ourselves.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Absolutely right,&#8221; said Pure Wind.</P>
<P>The two of them pulled themselves together, forced themselves to look happy, and went back to the front hall. &#8220;Master,&#8221; they said, bowing low to Sanzang, &#8220;we were extremely rude to you just now. Please forgive us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; asked Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;The fruit is all there,&#8221; they replied. &#8220;We couldn't see it all before as the tree is so tall and the foliage so thick but when we checked just now the number was right.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're too young to know what you're doing,&#8221; said Pig, taking the chance to put the boot in. &#8220;Why did you swear and curse at us, and try to frame us up? You bastards.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey, who understood what the boys were up to, said nothing and thought, &#8220;Lies, lies. The fruit is all finished. Why ever are they saying this? Can it be that they know how to bring the tree back to life?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well then,&#8221; Sanzang was saying meanwhile, &#8220;bring our rice in and we'll be off after eating it.&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig went off to fill their bowls and Friar Sand arranged a table and chairs. The two boys hurried out and fetched some side dishes&#8212;salted squash, salted eggplant, turnips in wine-lees, pickle bean, salted lettuce, and mustard plant, some seven or eight plates in all. These they gave to the pilgrims to eat with their rice, and then they waited on them with a pot of good tea and two cups. As soon as the four pilgrims had their ricebowls in their hands, the boys, who were on either side of the doorway, slammed the doors to and locked them with a double-sprung bronze lock.</P>
<P>&#8220;You shouldn't do that, boys,&#8221; said Pig with a smile. &#8220;Even if the people round here are a bit rough there's no need to shut the doors while we eat.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said Bright Moon, &#8220;we'll open them after lunch.&#8221; Pure Wind, however, was abusive.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll get you, you greedy, bald-headed food-thief,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You ate our immortal fruit and deserve to be punished for the crime of stealing food from fields and gardens. On top of that you've pushed our tree over and ruined our temple's source of immortality. How dare you argue with us? Your only chance of reaching the Western Heaven and seeing the Buddha is to be reborn and be rocked in the cradle again.&#8221; When Sanzang heard this he dropped his ricebowl, feeling as if a boulder was weighing down his heart. The two boys went and locked the main and the inner gates of the temple, then came back to the main hall to abuse them with filthy language and call them criminals and bandits till evening, when they went off to eat. The two of them returned to their rooms after supper.</P>
<P>&#8220;You're always causing trouble, you ape,&#8221; grumbled Sanzang at Monkey. &#8220;You stole their fruit, so you should have let them lose their temper and swear at you, then that would have been the end of it. Why on earth did you push their tree over? If they took this to court you wouldn't be able to get off even if your own father were on the bench.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't make such a row, master,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Those boys have gone to bed, and when they're asleep we can do a midnight flit.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But all the gates have been locked,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;and they've been shut very firmly, so how can we possibly get away?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't let it bother you,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;I have a way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We weren't worried that you wouldn't have a way,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;You can turn yourself into an insect and fly out through the holes in the window lattice. But you'll be leaving poor old us, who can't turn ourselves into something else, to stay here and carry the can for you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If he does a trick like that and doesn't take us with him I'll recite that old sutra&#8212;he won't get away scot-free then.&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig was both pleased and worried to hear this. &#8220;What do you mean, master?&#8221; he said. &#8220;I know that the Buddha's teachings include a<I> Lankavatara Sutra,</I> a<I> lotus Sutra,</I> a<I> Peacock Sutra,</I> an<I> Avalokit esvara Sutra,</I> and a<I> Diamond Sutra,</I> but I never heard of any<I> Old Sutra.&#8221;</I></P>
<P>&#8220;What you don't know, brother,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;is that the Bodhisattva Guanyin gave this band I have round my head to our master. He tricked me into wearing it, and now it's virtually rooted there and I can't take it off. The spell or sutra for tightening this band is what he meant by the 'old surra'. If he says it, my head aches. It's a way he has of making me suffer. Please don't recite it, master. I won't abandon you. I guarantee that we'll all get out.</P>
<P>It was now dark, and the moon had risen in the East. &#8220;It's quiet now,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;and the moon is bright. This is the time to go.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop fooling about, brother,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;The gates are all locked, so where can we possibly go?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Watch this trick,&#8221; said Monkey, and gripping his cudgel in his hand he pointed at the doors and applied unlocking magic to them. There was a clanking sound, and the locks fell from all the doors and gates, which he pushed them open.</P>
<P>&#8220;Not half clever,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;A locksmith with his skeleton keys couldn't have done it anything like as fast.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Nothing difficult about opening these doors,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I can open the Southern Gates of Heaven just by pointing at them.&#8221; Then he asked his master to go out and mount the horse. Pig shouldered the luggage, Friar Sand led the horse, and they headed West. &#8220;You carry on,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;while I go back to make sure that those two boys will stay asleep for a month.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Mind you don't kill them, disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;or you'll be on a charge of murder in the pursuit of theft as well.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm aware of that,&#8221; replied Monkey and went back into the temple. Standing outside the door of the room where the boys were sleeping, he took a couple of sleep insects from his belt. These were what he had used when he fooled the Heavenly King Virudhaka at the Eastern Gate of Heaven, and now he threw them in through a gap in the window lattice. They landed straight on the boys' faces, and made them fall into a deeper sleep from which they would not wake up for a long time. Then he streaked back by cloud and caught up with Sanzang. They headed West along the main road.</P>
<P>That night the horse never stopped, and they kept on till dawn. &#8220;You'll be the death of me, you ape,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;Because of your greed I've had to stay awake all night.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop grumbling,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Now that it's light you can rest in the forest beside the road and build your strength up before we move on.&#8221; Sanzang obediently dismounted and sat down on the roots of a pine tree, using it as a makeshift meditation platform. Friar Sand put down the luggage and took a nap, while Pig pillowed his head on a rock and went to sleep. Monkey, the Great Sage, had his own ideas and amused himself leaping from tree to tree.</P>
<P>After the lecture in the palace of the Original Celestial Jade Pure One the Great Immortal Zhen Yuan led his junior Immortals down from the Tushita Heaven through the jade sky on auspicious clouds, and in a moment they were back at the gates of the Wuzhuang Temple. The gates, he saw, were wide open, and the ground was clean.</P>
<P>&#8220;So Pure Wind and Bright Moon aren't so useless after all,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Usually they're still in bed when the sun is high in the sky. But now, with us away, they got up early, opened the gates, and swept the grounds.&#8221; All the junior Immortals were delighted. Yet when they went into the hall of worship there was no incense burning and nobody to be seen.</P>
<P>Where were Bright Moon and Pure Wind, they wondered. &#8220;They probably thought that with us not here they could steal some stuff and clear out.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What an outrageous idea,&#8221; said the Great Immortal. &#8220;As if men cultivating immortality could do anything so evil! I think they must have forgotten to shut the gates before they went to sleep last night and not have woken up yet.&#8221; When the Immortals went to look in their room they found the doors closed and heard the boys snoring. They hammered on the doors and shouted for all they were worth, but the boys did not wake up. They forced the doors open and pulled the boys from their beds: the boys still did not wake up. &#8220;Fine Immortal boys you are,&#8221; said the Great Immortal with a smile. &#8220;When you become an Immortal your divine spirit should be so full that you do not want to sleep. Why are they so tired? They must have been bewitched. Fetch some water at once.&#8221; A boy hastily handed him half a bowl of water. He intoned a spell, took a mouthful of the water, and spurted it on their faces. This broke the enchantment. The two of them woke up, opened their eyes, rubbed their faces, looked around them, and saw the Great Immortal as well as all their Immortal brothers. Pure Wind bowed and Bright Moon kowtowed in their confusion, saying, &#8220;Master, that old friend of yours, the priest from the East...a gang of bandits... murderous, murderous....&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be afraid,&#8221; said the Great Immortal with a smile. &#8220;Calm down and tell us all about it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Pure Wind, &#8220;the Tang Priest from the East did come. It was quite soon after you had left. There were four monks and a horse&#8212;five of them altogether. We did as you had ordered us and picked two manfruits to offer him, but the venerable gentleman was too vulgar and stupid to know what our treasures were. He said that they were newborn babies and refused to eat any, so we ate one each. Little did we imagine that one of his three disciples called Brother Sun Wukong, or Monkey, would steal four manfruits for them to eat. We spoke to him very reasonably, but he denied it and secretly used his magic. It's terrible....&#8221; At this point the two boys could no longer hold back the tears that now streamed down their cheeks. &#8220;Did the monk strike you?&#8221; asked the immortals. &#8220;No,&#8221; said Bright Moon, &#8220;he only felled our manfruit tree.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Great Immortal did not lose his temper when he heard their story, &#8220;Don't cry,&#8221; he said, &#8220;don't cry. What you don't realize is that Monkey is an Immortal of the Supreme Monad, and that he played tremendous havoc in the Heavenly Palace. He has vast magic powers. But he has knocked our tree over. Could you recognize those monks?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I could recognize all of them,&#8221; replied Pure Wind.</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case come with me,&#8221; said the Great Immortal. &#8220;The rest of you are to prepare the instruments of torture and be ready to flog them when we come back.&#8221;</P>
<P>The other Immortals did as they were told while the Great Immortal, Bright Moon and Pure Wind pursued Sanzang on a beam of auspicious light. It took them but an instant to cover three hundred miles. The Great Immortal stood on the edge of the clouds and gazed to the West, but he did not see Sanzang; then he turned round to look East and saw that he had left Sanzang over two hundred and fifty miles behind. Even riding all night that venerable gentleman had covered only forty miles, which was why the Great Immortal's cloud had overshot him by a great distance.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said one of the Immortal boys, &#8220;there's the Tang Priest, sitting under a tree by the side of the road.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, I'd seen him myself,&#8221; the Great Immortal replied. &#8220;You two go back and get some ropes ready, and I'll catch him myself.&#8221; Pure Wind and Bright Moon went back.</P>
<P>The Great Immortal landed his cloud, shook himself, and turned into and itinerant Taoist. Do you know what he looked like?</P>


<P>He wore a patchwork gown,</P>
<P>Tied with Lu Dongbin sash,</P>
<P>Waving a fly-whisk in his hand</P>
<P>He tapped a musical drum.</P>
<P>The grass sandals on his feet had three ears,</P>
<P>His head was wrapped in a sun turban.</P>
<P>As the wind filled his sleeves</P>
<P>He sang<I> The Moon Is High.</I></P>


<P>&#8220;Greetings, venerable sir,&#8221; he called, raising his hands. &#8220;Oh, I'm sorry I didn't notice you before,&#8221; replied Sanzang hastily.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you from?&#8221; the Great Immortal asked. &#8220;And why are you in meditation during your journey?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have been sent by the Great Tang in the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven,&#8221; Sanzang said, &#8220;and I'm taking a rest along the way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You must have crossed my desolate mountain if you have come from the East.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;May I ask, Immortal sir, which mountain is yours?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My humble abode is the Wuzhuang Temple on the Mountain of Infinite Longevity.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We didn't come that way,&#8221; said Monkey, who realized what was happening. &#8220;We've only just started out.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Great Immortal pointed at him and laughed. &#8220;I'll show you, you damned ape. Who do you think you're fooling? I know that you knocked our manfruit tree down and came here during the night. You had better confess: you won't get away with concealing anything. Stay where you are, and give me back that tree at once.&#8221; Monkey flared up at this, and with no further discussion he struck at the Great Immortal's head with his cudgel. The Great Immortal twisted away from the blow and went straight up into the sky on a beam of light, closely pursued by Monkey on a cloud. In mid-air the Great Immortal reverted to his true appearance, and this is what he looked like:</P>


<P>A golden crown on his head,</P>
<P>A No-worries cloak of crane's down on his body.</P>
<P>A pair of turned-up sandals on his feet,</P>
<P>And round his waist a belt of silk.</P>
<P>His body was like a child's,</P>
<P>His face was that of a beautiful woman.</P>
<P>A wispy beard floated down from his chin,</P>
<P>And the hair on his temples was crow-black.</P>
<P>He met Monkey unarmed</P>
<P>With only a jade-handled whisk in his hands.</P>


<P>Monkey struck wildly at him with his club, only to be parried to left and right by the Great Immortal's whisk. After two or three rounds the Great Immortal did a &#8220;Wrapping Heaven and Earth in His Sleeve&#8221; trick, waving his sleeve gently in the breeze as he stood amid the clouds, then sweeping it across the ground and gathering up the four pilgrims and their horse in it.</P>
<P>&#8220;Hell,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;We're all caught in a bag.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It isn't a bag, you idiot,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;he's caught us all in his sleeve.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It doesn't matter, anyhow,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;I can make a hole in it with a single blow of my rake that we can all get through. Then we'll be able to drop out when he relaxes his grip on us.&#8221; But however desperately he struck at the fabric he could make no impression on it: although it was soft when held in the hand it was harder than iron when hit.</P>
<P>The Great Immortal turned his cloud round, went straight back to the Wuzhuang Temple, landed, sat down, and told his disciples to fetch rope. Then, with all the junior Immortals in attendance, he took the Tang Priest out of his sleeve as if he were a puppet and had him tied to one of the pillars of the main hall. After that he took the other three out and tied each of them to a pillar. The horse was taken out, tethered, and fed in the courtyard, and their luggage he threw under the covered walk.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciples,&#8221; he said, &#8220;these priests are men of religion, so we cannot use swords, spears or axes on them. You'd better fetch a leather whip and give them a flogging for me&#8212;that will make me feel better about the manfruit.&#8221; The disciples immediately produced a whip&#8212;not an oxhide, sheepskin, deerskin or calfskin whip, but a seven-starred dragon-skin one&#8212;and were told to soak it in water. A brawny young Immortal was told to take a firm grip on it. &#8220;Master,&#8221; he said, &#8220;which of them stall I flog first?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Sanzang is guilty of gross disrespect,&#8221; the Great Immortal replied, &#8220;flog him first.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That old priest of ours couldn't stand a flogging,&#8221; thought Monkey when he heard this, &#8220;and if he died under the lash the fault would be mine.&#8221; Finding the thought of this unbearable, he spoke up and said, &#8220;You're wrong, sir. I stole the fruit, I ate the fruit, and I pushed the tree over. Why flog him first when you ought to be flogging me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That damn monkey has a point,&#8221; said the Great Immortal with a smile, &#8220;so you'd better flog him first.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How many strokes?&#8221; the junior Immortal asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Give him thirty,&#8221; the Great Immortal replied, &#8220;to match the number of fruits.&#8221; The junior Immortal whirled the lash and started to bring it down. Monkey, frightened that the Immortal would have great magical powers, opened his eyes wide and looked carefully to see where he was going to be hit, and it turned out to be on his legs. He twisted at the waist, shouted &#8220;Change!&#8221; turned them into a pair of wrought-iron legs, and watched the blows fall. The junior Immortal gave him thirty lashes, one after the other, until it was almost noon.</P>
<P>&#8220;Sanzang must be flogged too,&#8221; the Great Immortal commanded, &#8220;for training his wicked disciple so slackly and letting him run wild.&#8221;</P>
<P>The junior Immortal whirled the lash again and was going to strike Sanzang when Monkey said, &#8220;Sir, you're making another mistake. When I stole the fruit, my master knew nothing about it&#8212;he was talking to those two boys of yours in the main hall of the temple. This plot was hatched by us three disciples. Anyhow, even if he were guilty of slackness in training me, I'm his disciple and should take the flogging for him. Flog me again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That damn monkey may be cunning and vicious, but he does have some sense of his obligations to his master. Very well then, flog him again.&#8221; The junior Immortal gave him another thirty strokes. Monkey looked down and watched his legs being flogged till they shone like mirrors but still he felt no pain.</P>
<P>It was now drawing towards evening, and the Great Immortal said, &#8220;Put the lash to soak. We can continue that flogging tomorrow.&#8221; The junior Immortal took the lash away to be soaked while everyone retired to their quarters, and after supper they all went to bed.</P>
<P>&#8220;It was because you three got me into this trouble that I was brought here to be punished,&#8221; moaned the venerable Sanzang to his three disciples as tears streamed down from his eyes. &#8220;Is that how you ought to treat me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't grumble,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;I was the one to be flogged first, and you haven't felt the lash, so what have you got to groan about?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I may not have been flogged,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;but it's agony being tied up like this.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We're tied up too to keep you company,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;Will you all stop shouting?&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;then we can be on our way again when we've taken a rest.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're showing off again, elder brother,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;They've tied us up with hempen ropes and spurted water on them, so we're tightly bound. This isn't like the time we were shut in the hall of the temple and you unlocked the doors to let us out.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm not boasting,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I don't give a damn about their three hempen ropes sprayed with water. Even if they were coconut cables as thick as a ricebowl they would only be an autumn breeze.&#8221; Apart from him speaking, all was now silence. Splendid Monkey made himself smaller, slipped out of his bonds, and said, &#8220;Let's go, master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Save us too, elder brother,&#8221; pleaded a worried Friar Sand. &#8220;Shut up, shut up,&#8221; Monkey replied, then freed Sanzang, Pig and Friar Sand, straightened his tunic, tightened his belt, saddled the horse, collected their luggage from under the eaves, and went out through the temple gates with the others. &#8220;Go and cut down four of the willow-trees by that cliff,&#8221; he told Pig, who asked, &#8220;Whatever do you want them for?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've got a use for them,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Bring them here immediately.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot Pig, who certainly had brute strength, went and felled each of them with a single bite, and came back holding them all in his arms. Monkey stripped off their tops and branches and told his two fellow-disciples to take the trunks back in and tie them up with the ropes as they themselves had been tied up. Then Monkey recited a spell, bit the tip of his tongue open, and spat blood over the trees. At his shout of &#8220;Change!&#8221; one of the trees turned into Sanzang, one turned into Monkey, and the other two became Friar Sand and Pig. They were all perfect likenesses; when questioned they would reply, and when called by their names they responded. The three disciples then hurried back to their master, and once more they traveled all night without stopping as they fled from the Wuzhuang Temple.</P>
<P>By the time it was dawn the venerable Sanzang was swaying to and fro as he dozed in the saddle. &#8220;Master,&#8221; called Monkey when he noticed, &#8220;you're hopeless. You're a man of religion&#8212;how can you be finding it so exhausting? I can do without sleep for a thousand nights not feeling a bit tired. You'd better dismount and spare yourself the humiliation of being laughed at by a passer-by. Take a rest in one of the places under this hill where the wind is stored and the vapours gather before we go any further.&#8221;</P>
<P>We shall leave them resting beside the path to tell how the Great Immortal got up at dawn, ate his meatless breakfast, and went to the hall. &#8220;Today Tang Sanzang is to be whipped,&#8221; he announced as he sent for the lash. The junior whirled it around and said to the Tang Priest, &#8220;I'm going to flog you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Flog away,&#8221; the willow tree replied.</P>
<P>When he had given it thirty resounding lashes he whirled the whip around once more and said to Pig, &#8220;Now I'm going to flog you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Flog away,&#8221; the willow tree replied.</P>
<P>When he came to flog Friar Sand, he too told him to go ahead. But when he came to flog Monkey, the real Monkey on the road shuddered and said, &#8220;Oh, no!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;When I turned the four willow trees into the four of us I thought that as he had me flogged twice yesterday he wouldn't flog me again today, but now he's lashing the magic body, my real body is feeling the pain. I'm putting an end to this magic.&#8221; With that he hastily recited an incantation to break the spell.</P>
<P>Look at the terror of the Taoist boys as they throw down their leather whips and report, &#8220;Master, at first we were flogging the Priest from the Great Tang, but all we are flogging now are willow trunks. The Great Immortal laughed bitterly on hearing this and was full of admiration.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother Monkey really is a splendid Monkey King. I had heard that when he turned the Heavenly Palace upside-down, he could not even be caught with a Heaven and Earth Net, and now I see it must be true. I wouldn't mind your escaping, but why did you leave four willows tied up here to impersonate you? He shall be shown no mercy. After him!&#8221; As the words &#8220;After him&#8221; left his mouth, the Great Immortal sprang up on a cloud and looked West to see the monks carrying their bundles and spurring their horse as they went on their way. Bringing his cloud down he shouted, &#8220;Where are you going, Monkey? Give me back my manfruit tree.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We're done for,&#8221; exclaimed Pig, &#8220;our enemy's come back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Put all your piety away for now, master,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;while we finish him off once and for all with a bit of evil; then we'll be able to escape.&#8221; The Tang Priest shivered and shook on hearing this, and before he could answer, the three disciples rushed forward, Friar Sand wielding his staff, Pig with his rake held high, and the Great Sage Monkey brandishing his iron cudgel. They surrounded the Great Immortal in mid-air and struck wildly at him. There are some verses about this terrible fight:</P>


<P>Monkey did not know that the Immortal Zhen Yuan,</P>
<P>The Conjoint Lord of the Age, had even deeper powers.</P>
<P>While the three magic weapons fiercely whirled,</P>
<P>His deer-tail fly-whisk gently waved.</P>
<P>Parrying to left and right, he moved to and fro,</P>
<P>Blocking blows from front and back he let them rush around.</P>
<P>When night gave way to dawn they still were locked in combat.</P>
<P>If they tarried here they would never reach the Western Heaven.</P>


<P>The three of them went for him with their magic weapons, but the Great Immortal kept them at bay with his fly-whisk. After about an hour he opened wide his sleeve and caught up master, disciples, horse, and baggage in it once more. Then he turned his cloud around and went back to his temple, where all the Immortals greeted him. After taking his seat in the hall he took them out of his sleeve one by one. He had the Tang Priest tied to a stunted locust tree at the foot of the steps, with Pig and Friar Sand tied to trees next to him. Monkey was tied up upside-down, which made him think that he was going to be tortured and interrogated. When Monkey was tightly bound, the Great Immortal sent for ten long turban-cloths.</P>
<P>&#8220;What a kind gentleman, Pig,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;he's sent for some cloth to make sleeves for us&#8212;with a bit less he could have made us cassocks.&#8221; The junior Immortals fetched home-woven cloth, and on being told by the Great Immortal to wrap up Pig and Friar Sand with it, they came forward to do so.</P>
<P>&#8220;Excellent,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;excellent&#8212;you're being encoffined alive.&#8221; Within a few moments the three of them were wrapped up, and lacquer was then sent for. The Immortals quickly fetched some lacquer that they had tapped and dried themselves, with which they painted the three bandaged bodies all over except for the heads.</P>
<P>&#8220;Never mind about our heads, sir,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;but please leave us a hole at the bottom to shit through.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Great Immortal then sent for a huge cauldron, at which Monkey said with a laugh, &#8220;You're in luck, Pig. I think they must have brought the cauldron out to cook us some rice in.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Fine,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;I hope they give us some rice first&#8212;we'll make much better-looking ghosts if we die with our bellies full.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Immortals carried out the large cauldron and put it under the steps, and the Great Immortal called for dry wood to be stacked up round it and set ablaze. &#8220;Ladle it full of pure oil,&#8221; he commanded, &#8220;and when it is hot enough to bubble, deep-fry Monkey in it to pay me back for my manfruit.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey was secretly delighted to hear this. &#8220;This is just what I want,&#8221; He thought. &#8220;I haven't had a bath for ages, and my skin's getting rather itchy. I'd thoroughly appreciate a hot bath.&#8221; Very soon the oil was bubbling and Monkey was having reservations: he was afraid that the Immortal's magic might be hard for him to fathom, and that at first he might be unable to use his limbs in the cauldron. Hastily looking around him, he saw that there was a sundial to the East of the dais and a stone lion to the West. Monkey rolled towards it with a spring, bit off the end of his tongue, spurted blood all over the stone lion, and shouted &#8220;Change,&#8221; at which it turned into his own image, tied up in a bundle like himself. Then he extracted his spirit and went up into the clouds, from where he looked down at the Taoists.</P>
<P>It was just at this moment that the junior Immortals reported, &#8220;The oil's boiling hard.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Carry Monkey down to it,&#8221; the Great Immortal ordered, but when four of them tried to pick him up they could not. Eight then tried and failed, and four more made no difference. &#8220;This earth-infatuated ape is immovable,&#8221; they said. &#8220;He may be small, but he's very solid.&#8221; Twelve junior Immortals were then told to pick him up with the aid of carrying-poles, and when they threw him in there was a loud crash as drops of oil splashed about, raising blisters all over the junior Immortals' faces. &#8220;There's a hole in the cauldron&#8212;it's started leaking,&#8221; the scalded Immortals cried, but before the words were out of their mouths the oil had all run out through the broken bottom of the cauldron. They realized that they had thrown a stone lion into it.</P>
<P>&#8220;Damn that ape for his insolence,&#8221; said the Great Immortal in a terrible rage. &#8220;How dare he play his tricks in my presence! I don't mind so much about your getting away, but how dare you wreck my cauldron? It's useless trying to catch him, and even if you could it would be like grinding mercury out of sand, or trying to hold a shadow or the wind. Forget about him, let him go. Untie Tang Sanzang instead and fetch another pot. We can fry him to avenge the destruction of the tree.&#8221; The junior Immortals set to and began to tear off Sanzang's lacquered bandages.</P>
<P>Monkey could hear all this clearly from mid-air. &#8220;The master will be done for,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;If he goes into that cauldron it'll kill him. Then he'll be cooked, and after four or five fryings he'll be eaten as a really tender piece of monk. I must go back down and save him.&#8221; The splendid Great Sage brought his cloud down to land, clasped his hands in front of him, and said, &#8220;Don't spoil the lacquered bands, and don't fry my master. Put me in the cauldron of oil instead.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll get you, you baboon,&#8221; raged the Great Immortal in astonishment. &#8220;Why did you use one of your tricks to smash my cooking pot?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You must expect to be smashed up if you meet me&#8212;and what business is it of mine anyhow? I was going to accept your kind offer of some hot oil, but I was desperate for a shit and a piss, and if I'd done them in your cauldron, I'd have spoilt your oil and your food wouldn't have tasted right. Now I've done my stuff I'm ready for the cauldron. Please fry me instead of my master.&#8221; The Great Immortal laughed coldly, came out of the hall, and seized him.</P>
<P>If you don't know how the story goes or how he escaped, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<div class="title">
<p>镇元仙赶捉取经僧</p>
<p>孙行者大闹五庄观</p></div>
<p>却说他兄弟三众，到了殿上，对师父道："饭将熟了，叫我们怎的？"三藏道："徒弟，不是问饭。他这观里，有甚么人参果，似孩子一般的东西，你们是那一个偷他的吃了？"八戒道："我老实，不晓得，不曾见。"清风道："笑的就是他！笑的就是他！"</p>

<p>行者喝道：“我老孙生的是这个笑容儿，莫成为你不见了甚么果子，就不容我笑？”三藏道：“徒弟息怒，我们是出家人，休打诳语，莫吃昧心食，果然吃了他的，陪他个礼罢，何苦这般抵赖？”行者见师父说得有理，他就实说道：“师父，不干我事，是八戒隔壁听见那两个道童吃甚么人参果，他想一个儿尝新，着老孙去打了三个，我兄弟各人吃了一个。如今吃也吃了，待要怎么？”明月道：“偷了我四个，这和尚还说不是贼哩！”八戒道：“阿弥陀佛！既是偷了四个，怎么只拿出三个来分，预先就打起一个偏手？”那呆子倒转胡嚷。二仙童问得是实，越加毁骂。就恨得个大圣钢牙咬响，火眼睁圆，把条金箍棒揝了又揝，忍了又忍道：“这童子这样可恶，只说当面打人也罢，受他些气儿，等我送他一个绝后计，教他大家都吃不成！”好行者，把脑后的毫毛拔了一根，吹口仙气，叫“变！”变做个假行者，跟定唐僧，陪着悟能、悟净，忍受着道童嚷骂；他的真身出一个神，纵云头跳将起去，径到人参园里，掣金箍棒往树上乒乓一下，又使个推山移岭的神力，把树一推推倒。可怜叶落枒开根出土，道人断绝草还丹！那大圣推倒树，却在枝儿上寻果子，那里得有半个？原来这宝贝遇金而落，他的棒刃头却是金裹之物，况铁又是五金之类，所以敲着就振下来，既下来，又遇土而入，因此上边再没一个果子。他道：“好！好！好！大家散火！”他收了铁棒，径往前来，把毫毛一抖，收上身来。那些人肉眼凡胎，看不明白。</p>

<p>却说那仙童骂彀多时，清风道：“明月，这些和尚也受得气哩，我们就象骂鸡一般，骂了这半会，通没个招声，想必他不曾偷吃。倘或树高叶密，数得不明，不要诳骂了他！我和你再去查查。”明月道：“也说得是。”他两个果又到园中，只见那树倒枒开，果无叶落，唬得清风脚软跌根头，明月腰酥打骸垢。那两个魂飞魄散，有诗为证，诗曰：三藏西临万寿山，悟空断送草还丹。枒开叶落仙根露，明月清风心胆寒。他两个倒在尘埃，语言颠倒，只叫：“怎的好！怎的好！害了我五庄观里的丹头，断绝我仙家的苗裔！师父来家，我两个怎的回话？”明月道：“师兄莫嚷，我们且整了衣冠，莫要惊张了这几个和尚。这个没有别人，定是那个毛脸雷公嘴的那厮，他来出神弄法，坏了我们的宝贝。若是与他分说，那厮毕竟抵赖，定要与他相争，争起来，就要交手相打，你想我们两个，怎么敌得过他四个？且不如去哄他一哄，只说果子不少，我们错数了，转与他陪个不是。他们的饭已熟了，等他吃饭时，再贴他些儿小菜。他一家拿着一个碗，你却站在门左，我却站在门右，扑的把门关倒，把锁锁住，将这几层门都锁了，不要放他，待师父来家，凭他怎的处置。他又是师父的故人，饶了他，也是师父的人情；不饶他，我们也拿住个贼在，庶几可以免我等之罪。”清风闻言道：“有理！有理！”</p>

<p>他两个强打精神，勉生欢喜，从后园中径来殿上，对唐僧控背躬身道：“师父，适间言语粗俗，多有冲撞，莫怪，莫怪。”三藏问道：“怎么说？”清风道：“果子不少，只因树高叶密，不曾看得明白。才然又去查查，还是原数。”那八戒就趁脚儿跷道：“你这个童儿，年幼不知事体，就来乱骂，白口咀咒，枉赖了我们也！不当人子！”行者心上明白，口里不言，心中暗想道：“是谎，是谎！果子已是了帐，怎的说这般话？想必有起死回生之法。”</p>

<p>三藏道：“既如此，盛将饭来，我们吃了去罢。”那八戒便去盛饭，沙僧安放桌椅。二童忙取小菜，却是些酱瓜、酱茄、糟萝卜、醋豆角、腌窝蕖、绰芥菜，共排了七八碟儿，与师徒们吃饭；又提一壶好茶，两个茶钟，伺候左右。那师徒四众，却才拿起碗来，这童儿一边一个，扑的把门关上，插上一把两鐄铜锁。八戒笑道：“这童子差了。你这里风俗不好，却怎的关了门里吃饭？”</p>

<p>明月道：“正是，正是，好歹吃了饭儿开门。”清风骂道：“我把你这个害馋劳、偷嘴的秃贼！你偷吃了我的仙果，已该一个擅食田园瓜果之罪，却又把我的仙树推倒，坏了我五庄观里仙根，你还要说嘴哩！若能彀到得西方参佛面，只除是转背摇车再托生！”三藏闻言，丢下饭碗，把个石头放在心上。那童子将那前山门、二山门，通都上了锁，却又来正殿门首，恶语恶言，贼前贼后，只骂到天色将晚，才去吃饭。饭毕，归房去了。</p>

<p>唐僧埋怨行者道：“你这个猴头，番番撞祸！你偷吃了他的果子，就受他些气儿，让他骂几句便也罢了。怎么又推倒他的树！若论这般情由，告起状来，就是你老子做官，也说不通。”行者道：“师父莫闹，那童儿都睡去了，只等他睡着了，我们连夜起身。”沙僧道：“哥啊，几层门都上了锁，闭得甚紧，如何走么？”行者笑道：“莫管！莫管！老孙自有法儿。”八戒道：“愁你没有法儿哩！你一变，变甚么虫蛭儿，瞒格子眼里就飞将出去，只苦了我们不会变的，便在此顶缸受罪哩！”唐僧道：“他若干出这个勾当，不同你我出去啊，我就念起旧话经儿，他却怎生消受！”八戒闻言，又愁又笑道：“师父，你说的那里话？我只听得佛教中有卷《楞严经》、《法华经》、《孔雀经》、《观音经》、《金刚经》，不曾听见个甚那旧话儿经啊。”行者道：“兄弟，你不知道，我顶上戴的这个箍儿，是观音菩萨赐与我师父的。师父哄我戴了，就如生根的一般，莫想拿得下来，叫做《紧箍儿咒》，又叫做《紧箍儿经》。他旧话儿经，即此是也。但若念动，我就头疼，故有这个法儿难我。师父你莫念，我决不负你，管情大家一齐出去。”说话之间，都已天昏，不觉东方月上。行者道：“此时万籁无声，冰轮明显，正好走了去罢。”八戒道：“哥啊，不要捣鬼，门俱锁闭，往那里走？”行者道：“你看手段！”好行者，把金箍棒捻在手中，使一个解锁法，往门上一指，只听得突蹡的一声响，几层门双鐄俱落，唿喇的开了门扇。八戒笑道：“好本事！</p>

<p>就是叫小炉儿匠使掭子，便也不象这等爽利！”行者道：“这个门儿，有甚稀罕！就是南天门，指一指也开了。”却请师父出了门，上了马，八戒挑着担，沙僧拢着马，径投西路而去。行者道：“你们且慢行，等老孙去照顾那两个童儿睡一个月。”三藏道：“徒弟，不可伤他性命；不然，又一个得财伤人的罪了。”行者道：“我晓得。”行者复进去，来到那童儿睡的房门外。他腰里有带的瞌睡虫儿，原来在东天门与增长天王猜枚耍子赢的。他摸出两个来，瞒窗眼儿弹将进去，径奔到那童子脸上，鼾鼾沉睡，再莫想得醒。他才拽开云步，赶上唐僧，顺大路一直西奔，这一夜马不停蹄，只行到天晓，三藏道：“这个猴头弄杀我也！你因为嘴，带累我一夜无眠！”行者道：“不要只管埋怨。天色明了，你且在这路旁边树林中将就歇歇，养养精神再走。”那长老只得下马，倚松根权作禅床坐下，沙僧歇了担子打盹，八戒枕着石睡觉。孙大圣偏有心肠，你看他跳树扳枝顽耍。四众歇息不题。</p>

<p>却说那大仙自元始宫散会，领众小仙出离兜率，径下瑶天，坠祥云，早来到万寿山五庄观门首。看时，只见观门大开，地上干净，大仙道：“清风、明月，却也中用。常时节，日高三丈，腰也不伸，今日我们不在，他倒肯起早，开门扫地。”众小仙俱悦。行至殿上，香火全无，人踪俱寂，那里有明月、清风！众仙道：“他两个想是因我们不在，拐了东西走了。”大仙道：“岂有此理！修仙的人，敢有这般坏心的事！想是昨晚忘却关门，就去睡了，今早还未醒哩。”众仙到他房门首看处，真个关着房门，鼾鼾沉睡。这外边打门乱叫，那里叫得醒来？众仙撬开门板，着手扯下床来，也只是不醒。大仙笑道：“好仙童啊！成仙的人，神满再不思睡，却怎么这般困倦？莫不是有人做弄了他也？快取水来。”一童急取水半盏递与大仙。大仙念动咒语，噀一口水，喷在脸上，随即解了睡魔。</p>

<p>二人方醒，忽睁睛抹抹脸，抬头观看，认得是仙师与世同君和仙兄等众，慌得那清风顿首，明月叩头道：“师父啊！你的故人，原是东来的和尚，一伙强盗，十分凶狠！”大仙笑道：“莫惊恐，慢慢的说来。”清风道：“师父啊，当日别后不久，果有个东土唐僧，一行有四个和尚，连马五口。弟子不敢违了师命，问及来因，将人参果取了两个奉上。那长老俗眼愚心，不识我们仙家的宝贝。他说是三朝未满的孩童，再三不吃，是弟子各吃了一个。不期他那手下有三个徒弟，有一个姓孙的，名悟空行者，先偷四个果子吃了。是弟子们向伊理说，实实的言语了几句，他却不容，暗自里弄了个出神的手段，苦啊！”二童子说到此处，止不住腮边泪落。众仙道：“那和尚打你来？”明月道：“不曾打，只是把我们人参树打倒了。”大仙闻言，更不恼怒，道：“莫哭！莫哭！你不知那姓孙的，也是个太乙散仙，也曾大闹天宫，神通广大。既然打倒了宝树，你可认得那些和尚？”清风道：“都认得。”大仙道：“既认得，都跟我来。众徒弟们，都收拾下刑具，等我回来打他。”</p>

<p>众仙领命。大仙与明月、清风纵起祥光，来赶三藏，顷刻间就有千里之遥。大仙在云端里向西观看，不见唐僧；及转头向东看时，倒多赶了九百余里。原来那长老一夜马不停蹄，只行了一百二十里路，大仙的云头一纵，赶过了九百余里。仙童道：“师父，那路旁树下坐的是唐僧。”大仙道：“我已见了。你两个回去安排下绳索，等我自家拿他。”清风先回不题。</p>

<p>那大仙按落云头，摇身一变，变作个行脚全真。你道他怎生模样：穿一领百衲袍，系一条吕公绦。手摇塵尾，渔鼓轻敲。</p>

<p>三耳草鞋登脚下，九阳巾子把头包。飘飘风满袖，口唱《月儿高》。径直来到树下，对唐僧高叫道：“长老，贫道起手了。”那长老忙忙答礼道：“失瞻！失瞻！”大仙问：“长老是那方来的？为何在途中打坐？”三藏道：“贫僧乃东土大唐差往西天取经者。</p>

<p>路过此间，权为一歇。”大仙佯讶道：“长老东来，可曾在荒山经过？”长老道：“不知仙宫是何宝山？”大仙道：“万寿山五庄观，便是贫道栖止处。”行者闻言，他心中有物的人，忙答道：“不曾！不曾！我们是打上路来的。”那大仙指定笑道：“我把你这个泼猴！你瞒谁哩？你倒在我观里，把我人参果树打倒，你连夜走在此间，还不招认，遮饰甚么？不要走！趁早去还我树来！”</p>

<p>那行者闻言，心中恼怒，掣铁棒不容分说，望大仙劈头就打。大仙侧身躲过，踏祥光，径到空中。行者也腾云，急赶上去。大仙在半空现了本相，你看他怎生打扮：头戴紫金冠，无忧鹤氅穿。</p>

<p>履鞋登足下，丝带束腰间。体如童子貌，面似美人颜。三须飘颔下，鸦瓴叠鬓边。相迎行者无兵器，止将玉塵手中拈。那行者没高没低的，棍子乱打。大仙把玉塵左遮右挡，奈了他两三回合，使一个袖里乾坤的手段，在云端里把袍袖迎风轻轻的一展，刷地前来，把四僧连马一袖子笼住。八戒道：“不好了！我们都装在拉縺里了！”行者道：“呆子，不是拉縺，我们被他笼在衣袖中哩。”八戒道：“这个不打紧，等我一顿钉钯，筑他个窟窿，脱将下去，只说他不小心，笼不牢，吊的了罢。”那呆子使钯乱筑，那里筑得动？手捻着虽然是个软的，筑起来就比铁还硬。</p>

<p>那大仙转祥云，径落五庄观坐下，叫徒弟拿绳来。众小仙一一伺候。你看他从袖子里，却象撮傀儡一般，把唐僧拿出，缚在正殿檐柱上；又拿出他三个，每一根柱上，绑了一个；将马也拿出拴在庭下，与他些草料，行李抛在廊下。又道：“徒弟，这和尚是出家人，不可用刀枪，不可加铁钺，且与我取出皮鞭来，打他一顿，与我人参果出气！”众仙即忙取出一条鞭，不是甚么牛皮、羊皮、麂皮、犊皮的，原来是龙皮做的七星鞭，着水浸在那里。令一个有力量的小仙，把鞭执定道：“师父，先打那个？”大仙道：“唐三藏做大不尊，先打他。”行者闻言，心中暗道：“我那老和尚不禁打，假若一顿鞭打坏了啊，却不是我造的业？”他忍不住开言道：“先生差了。偷果子是我，吃果子是我，推倒树也是我，怎么不先打我，打他做甚？”大仙笑道：“这泼猴倒言语膂烈。这等便先打他。”小仙问：“打多少？”大仙道：“照依果数，打三十鞭。”那小仙轮鞭就打。行者恐仙家法大，睁圆眼瞅定，看他打那里。原来打腿，行者就把腰扭一扭，叫声“变！”变作两条熟铁腿，看他怎么打。那小仙一下一下的，打了三十，天早向午了。大仙又吩咐道：“还该打三藏训教不严，纵放顽徒撒泼。”那仙又轮鞭来打，行者道：“先生又差了。偷果子时，我师父不知，他在殿上与你二童讲话，是我兄弟们做的勾当。纵是有教训不严之罪，我为弟子的，也当替打，再打我罢。”大仙笑道：“这泼猴，虽是狡猾奸顽，却倒也有些孝意。既这等，还打他罢。”小仙又打了三十。行者低头看看，两只腿似明镜一般，通打亮了，更不知些疼痒。此时天色将晚，大仙道：“且把鞭子浸在水里，待明朝再拷打他。”小仙且收鞭去浸，各各归房。晚斋已毕，尽皆安寝不题。</p>

<p>那长老泪眼双垂，怨他三个徒弟道：“你等闯出祸来，却带累我在此受罪，这是怎的起？”行者道：“且休报怨，打便先打我，你又不曾吃打，倒转嗟呀怎的？”唐僧道：“虽然不曾打，却也绑得身上疼哩。”沙僧道：“师父，还有陪绑的在这里哩。”行者道：“都莫要嚷，再停会儿走路。”八戒道：“哥哥又弄虚头了。</p>

<p>这里麻绳喷水，紧紧的绑着，还比关在殿上被你使解锁法搠开门走哩！”行者道：“不是夸口说，那怕他三股的麻绳喷上了水，就是碗粗的棕缆，也只好当秋风！”正话处，早已万籁无声，正是天街人静。好行者，把身子小一小，脱下索来道：“师父去哑！”沙僧慌了道：“哥哥，也救我们一救！”行者道：“悄言！悄言！”他却解了三藏，放下八戒、沙僧，整束了褊衫，扣背了马匹，廊下拿了行李，一齐出了观门。又教八戒：“你去把那崖边柳树伐四颗来。”八戒道：“要他怎的？”行者道：“有用处，快快取来！”那呆子有些夯力，走了去，一嘴一颗，就拱了四颗，一抱抱来。行者将枝梢折了，将兄弟二人复进去，将原绳照旧绑在柱上。那大圣念动咒语，咬破舌尖，将血喷在树上，叫“变！”一根变作长老，一根变作自身，那两根变作沙僧、八戒，都变得容貌一般，相貌皆同，问他也就说话，叫名也就答应。他两个却才放开步，赶上师父。这一夜依旧马不停蹄，躲离了五庄观。只走到天明，那长老在马上摇桩打盹，行者见了，叫道：“师父不济！出家人怎的这般辛苦？我老孙千夜不眠，也不晓得困倦。</p>

<p>且下马来，莫教走路的人，看见笑你，权在山坡下藏风聚气处，歇歇再走。”</p>

<p>不说他师徒在路暂住。且说那大仙，天明起来，吃了早斋，出在殿上，教拿鞭来：“今日却该打唐三藏了。”那小仙轮着鞭，望唐僧道：“打你哩。”那柳树也应道：“打么。”乒乓打了三十。</p>

<p>轮过鞭来，对八戒道：“打你哩。”那柳树也应道：“打么。”及打沙僧，也应道“打么。”及打到行者，那行者在路，偶然打个寒噤道：“不好了！”三藏问道：“怎么说？”行者道：“我将四颗柳树变作我师徒四众，我只说他昨日打了我两顿，今日想不打了。却又打我的化身，所以我真身打噤，收了法罢。”那行者慌忙念咒收法。</p>

<p>你看那些道童害怕，丢了皮鞭，报道：“师父啊，为头打的是大唐和尚，这一会打的都是柳树之根！”大仙闻言，呵呵冷笑，夸不尽道：“孙行者，真是一个好猴王！曾闻他大闹天宫，布地网天罗，拿他不住，果有此理。你走了便也罢，却怎么绑些柳树在此，冒名顶替？决莫饶他，赶去来！”那大仙说声赶，纵起云头，往西一望，只见那和尚挑包策马，正然走路。大仙低下云头，叫声：“孙行者！往那里走！还我人参树来！”八戒听见道：“罢了！对头又来了！”行者道：“师父，且把善字儿包起，让我们使些凶恶，一发结果了他，脱身去罢。”唐僧闻言，战战兢兢，未曾答应，沙僧掣宝杖，八戒举钉钯，大圣使铁棒，一齐上前，把大仙围住在空中，乱打乱筑。这场恶斗，有诗为证，诗曰：悟空不识镇元仙，与世同君妙更玄。三件神兵施猛烈，一根塵尾自飘然。左遮右挡随来往，后架前迎任转旋。夜去朝来难脱体，淹留何日到西天！</p>

<p>他兄弟三众，各举神兵，一齐攻打，那大仙只把蝇帚儿演架。那里有半个时辰，他将袍袖一展，依然将四僧一马并行李，一袖笼去，返云头，又到观里。众仙接着，仙师坐于殿上，却又在袖儿里一个个搬出，将唐僧绑在阶下矮槐树上，八戒、沙僧各绑在两边树上。将行者捆倒，行者道：“想是调问哩。”不一时，捆绑停当，教把长头布取十匹来。行者笑道：“八戒！这先生好意思，拿出布来与我们做中袖哩！减省些儿，做个一口中罢了。”那小仙将家机布搬将出来。大仙道：“把唐三藏、猪八戒、沙和尚都使布裹了！”众仙一齐上前裹了。行者笑道：“好！好！好！夹活儿就大殓了！”须臾，缠裹已毕，又教拿出漆来。众仙即忙取了些自收自晒的生熟漆，把他三个布裹的漆了，浑身俱裹漆，上留着头脸在外。八戒道：“先生，上头倒不打紧，只是下面还留孔儿，我们好出恭。”那大仙又教把大锅抬出来。行者笑道：“八戒，造化！抬出锅来，想是煮饭我们吃哩。”八戒道：“也罢了，让我们吃些饭儿，做个饱死的鬼也好看。”众仙果抬出一口大锅支在阶下。大仙叫架起干柴，发起烈火，教：“把清油熬上一锅，烧得滚了，将孙行者下油锅扎他一扎，与我人参树报仇！”行者闻言暗喜道：“正可老孙之意。这一向不曾洗澡，有些儿皮肤燥痒，好歹荡荡，足感盛情。”顷刻间，那油锅将滚。</p>

<p>大圣却又留心，恐他仙法难参，油锅里难做手脚，急回头四顾，只见那台下东边是一座日规台，西边是一个石狮子。行者将身一纵，滚到西边，咬破舌尖，把石狮子喷了一口，叫声“变！”变作他本身模样，也这般捆作一团，他却出了元神，起在云端里，低头看着道士。</p>

<p>只见那小仙报道：“师父，油锅滚透了。”大仙教“把孙行者抬下去！”四个仙童抬不动，八个来，也抬不动，又加四个，也抬不动。众仙道：“这猴子恋土难移，小自小，倒也结实。”却教二十个小仙，扛将起来，往锅里一掼，烹的响了一声，溅起些滚油点子，把那小道士们脸上烫了几个燎浆大泡！只听得烧火的小童喊道：“锅漏了！锅漏了！”说不了，油漏得罄尽，锅底打破，原来是一个石狮子放在里面。大仙大怒道：“这个泼猴，着然无礼！教他当面做了手脚！你走了便罢，怎么又捣了我的灶？这泼猴枉自也拿他不住，就拿住他，也似抟砂弄汞，捉影捕风。</p>

<p>罢！罢！罢！饶他去罢。且将唐三藏解下，另换新锅，把他扎一扎，与人参树报报仇罢。”那小仙真个动手，拆解布漆。行者在半空里听得明白，他想着：“师父不济，他若到了油锅里，一滚就死，二滚就焦，到三五滚，他就弄做个稀烂的和尚了！我还去救他一救。”好大圣，按落云头，上前叉手道“莫要拆坏了布漆，我来下油锅了。”那大仙惊骂道：“你这猢猴！怎么弄手段捣了我的灶？”行者笑道：“你遇着我就该倒灶，干我甚事？我才自也要领你些油汤油水之爱，但只是大小便急了，若在锅里开风，恐怕污了你的熟油，不好调菜吃，如今大小便通干净了，才好下锅。不要扎我师父，还来扎我。”那大仙闻言，呵呵冷笑，走出殿来，一把扯住。毕竟不知有何话说，端的怎么脱身，且听下回分解。</p>
