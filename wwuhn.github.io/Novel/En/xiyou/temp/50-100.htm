<P>Feelings Run Wild and Nature Gets Loose Because of Desire</P>
<P>In Confusion of Spirit the Heart Is Disturbed and the Demon
 Encountered</P>
</B>
<P>The poem goes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The heart must be frequently swept,</P>
<P>The dust of emotions removed,</P>
<P>Lest the Buddha be trapped in the pit.</P>
<P>Only when the essence is pure</P>
<P>Can the origin then be discussed.</P>
<P>Trim the candle of nature,</P>
<P>Breathe in the way that Master Caoxi taught,</P>
<P>Control the ape and horse of the mind.</P>
<P>Only when breath is calm by day and night</P>
<P>Can one achieve the true adept's skill.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This poem is set to the tune<I> Nan Ke Zi</I> and it tells how the
 Tang Priest escaped disaster under the ice of the River of Heaven and
 crossed to the other bank on the shell of the white turtle. As the four
 pilgrims headed West it was now the depths of winter, but the mists in
 the forests were still light, and the bony shapes of the mountains
 could be seen rising in their purity above the waters. As master and
 disciples carried on along their way, they were obstructed by a big
 mountain. The road was rocky, and they and the horse found the going
 rough. Sanzang reined the horse in and called for his disciples.</P>
<P>Monkey led Pig and Friar Sand forward to stand in attendance and
 asked, &#8220;Master, what are your instructions?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You can see how high the mountain in front of us is,&#8221; said Sanzang.
 &#8220;I am worried that there may be tigers, wolves, monsters and demon
 beasts who will kill us. You must be very careful.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry, Master,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;We three brothers have got on
 very well together since we were converted to the pursuit of the truth.
 With our magic powers to put down demons and monsters we've got nothing
 to fear from tigers, wolves or demons.&#8221; This greatly reassured Sanzang,
 who pressed ahead. When he reached the mouth of a gully and urged the
 horse up the slope he raised his head and saw that it was a splendid
 mountain:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Towering crags,</P>
<P>A steep and lofty range.</P>
<P>Towering crags pierced the heavens,</P>
<P>The steep and lofty range blocked out the azure shy.</P>
<P>Grotesque rocks were piled like sitting tigers,</P>
<P>Twisted, slanting pines seemed to fly like dragons,</P>
<P>Beautifully sang the birds on the ridge,</P>
<P>Heavy hung the scent of plum blossom by the scar.</P>
<P>Cold was the sluggish flow of the stream,</P>
<P>And menacing hung the dark clouds over the peak.</P>
<P>They saw whirling snow,</P>
<P>And an icy wind</P>
<P>Howling with the roar of hungry mountain tigers.</P>
<P>Cold rooks could find no perches in the trees</P>
<P>And wild deer did not know the way back home.</P>
<P>Hard it was indeed for the traveler to make progress</P>
<P>As he frowned with worry and covered up his head.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The four of them were trembling in the cold and the snow as they
 crossed that high ridge and saw in a distant hollow high towers and
 elegant houses. &#8220;Disciples,&#8221; said a relieved Sanzang from the back of
 his horse, &#8220;we have gone cold and hungry today, but there are many
 buildings in that hollow that I an sure must be a farm or a Buddhist or
 Taoist monastery. Let us go there and beg some food before we continue
 on our way.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey's immediate response was to take a good look. He saw that
 evil-looking clouds and vapors hung over the place, so he turned back
 to the Tang Priest and said, &#8220;Master, that's a bad place.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How could it possibly be a bad place with all those towers,
 pavilions and fine buildings?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;You wouldn't know, Master,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;There are any number of
 evil spirits and monsters along this road to the West who are good at
 making buildings by magic. They can make anything from towers and
 houses to halls and pavilions, and all just as bait. As you know, one
 of the nine kinds of dragon is called the clam-dragon. Its breath comes
 out looking like fine buildings and pools. Clam-dragon buildings appear
 when there is a heavy mist over a great river. Birds flying by will
 perch on them for a rest. The clam-dragon eats everyone up, even if
 there are thousands of them. It's a really lethal trick. The atmosphere
 over there looks thoroughly vicious: whatever you do don't go there.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Even if I may not I am still very hungry indeed,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, Master, you really must be,&#8221; replied Monkey. &#8220;Would you like to
 dismount and sit on this level ground here while I go somewhere else to
 beg food for you?&#8221; Sanzang followed this suggestion.</P>
<P>While Pig held the halter Friar Sand put the luggage down, opened up
 one of the bundles, and took out a begging bowl that he handed to
 Monkey, who gave him these parting instructions as he took it: &#8220;Don't
 go any further. Guard the master and make sure he stays sitting here
 until I come back with some food. Then we can carry on West.&#8221;</P>
<P>Friar Sand promised to do so. Monkey then spoke to Sanzang again:
 &#8220;Master, this is a very dangerous place. Whatever you do you mustn't
 move away from here. I'm off now to beg for food.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No need to say any more,&#8221; replied Sanzang. &#8220;Be back as soon as you
 can. I shall wait for you here.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey turned and was about to go when he turned back to add,
 &#8220;Master, I know that you haven't the patience to sit still, but I'll
 make a spell to keep you safe here.&#8221; With that he took out his
 gold-banded cudgel and in a flash he drew a circle on the ground with
 it. He asked the Tang priest to sit in the circle with Pig and Friar
 Sand standing on either side and the horse and luggage nearby.</P>
<P>Then he put his palms together and said to the Tang Priest, &#8220;The
 circle I've drawn is stronger than a wall of bronze or iron. No tiger,
 leopard, wolf, demon, fiend or monster will dare come anywhere near it.
 But you must not step outside it. I guarantee that you'll come to no
 harm as long as you sit inside the circle; but once you leave it very
 nasty things will happen to you. Please, please, please stay inside it
 whatever happens.&#8221; Sanzang did as he was told and they all sat down.
 Only then did Monkey set off due South on his cloud to beg for some
 food. When he saw the ancient trees of another farmhouse reaching up to
 the sky he brought his cloud down for a closer look. This is what he
 saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Willows bent down by cruel snow,</P>
<P>A square pool frozen hard.</P>
<P>A few sparse bamboos waving green,</P>
<P>The turquoise of a lofty and elegant pine.</P>
<P>Thatched cottages that looked covered with silver,</P>
<P>A slanting bridge that seemed paved with flour.</P>
<P>Daffodils by the fence were beginning to open,</P>
<P>While icicles hung low beneath the eaves.</P>
<P>The icy wind carried many a strange fragrance;</P>
<P>The plum blossom was lost amid the driving snow.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As Monkey walked towards the farm to take a look at it he heard the
 creak of a wicker gate opening as an old man came out. He was leaning
 on a wooden stick and wearing a sheepskin hat, a tattered tunic, and
 rush sandals. He looked up to the sky and said. &#8220;The Northwest wind in
 blowing, so the sky will be clear tomorrow.&#8221; Before the words were out
 of his mouth a Pekinese dog came bounding out from behind him and
 started barking wildly at Monkey. Only then did the man turn to see
 Monkey carrying his begging bowl.</P>
<P>&#8220;Venerable benefactor,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;I'm with the monk sent to the
 Western Heaven by the emperor of Great Tang in the East to worship the
 Buddha and fetch the scriptures. As we were passing this way and my
 master is very hungry I have come to your honorable residence to beg
 for a vegetarian meal.&#8221;</P>
<P>The old man nodded, hit the ground with his stick and said, &#8220;Reverend
 sir, don't beg here. You've lost your way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No, I haven't,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;The main trail West is over three hundred miles North of here,&#8221; said
 the old man, &#8220;so why aren't you on that?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's where I've come from,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;My master is now
 sitting by the main trail waiting for me to bring him some food.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're talking nonsense, monk,&#8221; the old man replied. &#8220;How could your
 master be waiting by the main trail for you to bring him some food?
 Even if you could walk this far it would take you six or seven days to
 cover over three hundred miles and as long again to get back. By then
 he would have starved to death.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Honestly, benefactor,&#8221; replied Brother Monkey with a smile. &#8220;I have
 only just left my master, and it took me less time to get here than it
 would to drink a cup of tea. When I've been given the food I'll take it
 back for his lunch.&#8221;</P>
<P>This alarmed the old man, who drew back at once, saying, &#8220;That monk's
 a demon, a demon.&#8221;</P>
<P>He was just about to go back inside when Monkey took hold of him and
 asked, &#8220;Where are you going, benefactor? Give me some food at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's very difficult,&#8221; the old man said, &#8220;very difficult. Try
 somewhere else.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You really don't understand, benefactor,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Just
 think, I've had to come over three hundred miles to get here, so it
 would probably be another three hundred miles to another house. You're
 trying to make my master starve to death.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I tell you frankly,&#8221; the old man said, &#8220;that we can only put three
 pints of rice in the pot for the six or seven members of the family,
 and it's still cooking. Try somewhere else first.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There is an old saying,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;that it's better to stay
 in one house than to call on three. I'm staying put.&#8221; The old man lost
 his temper with Monkey for being so persistent and raised his stick to
 hit him. This did not worry Monkey at all, who allowed the old man to
 hit him on his shaven pate seven or eight times: it felt like having
 the itches on his head scratched.</P>
<P>&#8220;You're a monk who likes being hit on the head,&#8221; said the old man.</P>
<P>&#8220;Hit me as much as you like, oldy,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'm keeping the
 score and you'll have to give me a pint of rice for every blow.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the old man heard this he dropped his stick, rushed inside, shut
 the gate and shouted: &#8220;A demon, a demon.&#8221; This made the whole household
 shake with fear as they shut the front and back gates in a great hurry.
 Watching the gates being shut Monkey thought, &#8220;I wonder if the old
 villain was telling the truth about the amount of rice they cook. As
 the saying goes, the good are converted by Taoism and the stupid by
 Buddhism. I'm going in to take a look round.&#8221; With that the splendid
 Great Sage made a spell with his hands to make himself invisible and
 went straight to the kitchen to look. He saw that the pot was steaming
 and half filled with grain, so he thrust his begging bowl into it,
 filled it to the brim, and went back on his cloud.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Tang priest meanwhile, who had been sitting in the circle for a
 long time waiting for Monkey to come back, stretched, looked around and
 said, &#8220;Where has that ape gone to beg for food?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Goodness only knows where he is&#8212;probably fooling around,&#8221; said Pig
 with a laugh beside him. &#8220;Begging for food, indeed! He's left us here
 in a pen.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean, in a pen?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;That's something else you wouldn't know, Master,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;In
 the old days people used to draw circles on the ground to make pens. He
 draws a circle with his cudgel and says it's stronger than a wall of
 bronze or iron. But how could it possibly keep out any tigers, wolves
 or evil monsters that came here? We'd be a meal served up to them on a
 plate.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What should we do about it, Wuneng?&#8221; Sanzang asked him.</P>
<P>&#8220;We're not sheltered from the wind or the cold here,&#8221; Pig said. &#8220;If
 you ask me we should carry on West along the trail. Monkey went off
 begging on his cloud, so he's bound to be back soon. He'll catch up
 with us. If he's got any food we can eat it before going on. All we've
 got from sitting here so long is cold feet.&#8221;</P>
<P>These words were to be Sanzang's undoing: he followed the idiot's
 advice and they all left the circle. The Tang Priest walked along the
 trail with Pig leading the horse and Friar Sand carrying the luggage.
 They soon reached the house with high towers, which was a South-facing
 compound. Outside the gates was a whitewashed wall, above which rose a
 multicolored gatetower shaped like lotuses leaning together. The gates
 stood half open. While Pig tethered the horse to a stone drum by the
 threshold Friar Sand put the luggage down and Sanzang sat on the
 doorsill out of the wind.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said pig, &#8220;this looks like a nobleman or a minister's
 house. There's nobody at the gates, so I suppose they're all inside
 warming themselves up by the fire. Sit down and let me take a look.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do be careful,&#8221; said the Tang Priest. &#8220;Don't go charging into their
 house.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said the idiot. &#8220;I'm a lot better mannered now I'm a
 Buddhist. I'm not a village yokel any more.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot tucked his rake in his belt, straightened his black brocade
 tunic, and went in through the gate in a very affected way. He saw a
 large hall with high, curtained windows that was completely quiet and
 deserted. There were no tables, chairs or other furniture. When he went
 round the screen and further into the house he found himself in a
 passageway at the end of which stood a multi-storied building with
 upstairs windows half open through which yellow damask bed-curtains
 could be glimpsed. &#8220;I suppose they're still in bed because it's so
 cold,&#8221; thought Pig, whereupon he marched up the stairs without worrying
 about the propriety of invading the private quarters of the house. When
 the idiot lifted the curtain and looked inside he almost collapsed with
 shock: on the ivory bed inside the curtains was a pile of gleaming
 white bones, with a skull the size of a bushel measure and thighbones
 some four or five feet long.</P>
<P>When the idiot calmed himself the tears poured down his cheeks as he
 nodded to the skeletons and said with a sigh, &#8220;I wonder:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>For what great dynasty you once were a marshal</P>
<P>In what country's service did you hold high command?</P>
<P>Then you were a hero fighting for mastery,</P>
<P>But now you are only a pile of old bones.</P>
<P>Where are the widow and child making offerings?</P>
<P>Do no soldiers burn incense to honour your memory?</P>
<P>The sight is enough to make one sigh deeply:</P>
<P>Alas for the man who once was a conqueror.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As pig was sighing with grief there was a flicker of fire behind the
 curtain, &#8220;I suppose there must be attendants at the back to offer him
 incense,&#8221; the idiot thought. When he rushed round the bed-curtain to
 look he saw that it was the daylight shining through the windows,
 beside which stood a coloured lacquer table. On it were thrown some
 padded clothes in brocade and embroidery. When the idiot picked them up
 to look at them he saw that they were three quilted brocade waistcoats.
 Not worrying about whether it was right to do so the idiot took them
 downstairs and went out through the main hall and the gates.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;there's no sign of life here&#8212;it's a house of
 the dead. I went inside and went upstairs, where I found a pile of
 bones behind a yellow bed-curtain. On one side of the upper floor were
 three quilted brocade waistcoats, look&#8212;I've brought them back with me.
 We're really in luck as they're just what we need now that the weather
 has turned cold. Take your habit off, Master, and put one of these on
 underneath. You'll be a lot more comfortable: it'll keep the cold out.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;it's forbidden. The law says, 'Taking, whether
 openly or in secret, is always theft.' If anyone found out, came after
 us and handed us over to the authorities we would definitely be found
 guilty of theft. You had better take them back in and put them where
 you found them. We shall just sit here for a while to shelter from the
 wind and carry on along our way as soon as Wukong is back. Monks should
 not be looking out for easy pickings like that.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But there's nobody around who could know,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;not even a
 chicken or a dog. The only people who know are ourselves. Who's going
 to sue us? There's no evidence. It's just the same as if we'd picked it
 up. Taking or stealing just doesn't come into it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; said the Tang Priest. &#8220;Even if nobody else knew about it
 Heaven cannot be fooled. As the Lord of Origin teaches us, 'Do no evil
 in a dark house: the eyes of the gods are like lightning.' Take it back
 at once and stop hankering after what you have no right to.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot was having none of this. &#8220;Master,&#8221; he said to the Tang
 Priest with a grin, &#8220;I've worn several waistcoats in my life, but never
 have I seen quilted brocade ones like this before. Even if you don't
 want to wear one, please let me just try one on to warm my back up.
 When Monkey comes back I'll take it off and we can be on our way
 again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that cast,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;I'd like to try one too.&#8221; The two
 of them took off their outer tunics and put the waistcoats on instead.
 As soon as they had tightened the belts they collapsed, unable to stay
 on their feet. The waistcoats were even worse than bonds. In an instant
 both of them had their hands tied together behind their backs. Sanzang
 stamped his foot in despair and indignation and rushed forward to untie
 them, but to no avail. The three of them set up endless yells that soon
 disturbed a demon king.</P>
<P>Now these buildings had indeed been created by the magic of an evil
 spirit who spent all his life lying in wait there to catch people.
 Hearing the howls of anger as he sat in his cave he rushed out to find
 that he had several victims tied up. The monster called for his little
 demons to go there with him as he made all the enchanted buildings
 vanish. They returned to the cave holding the Tang Priest, leading the
 horse, and dragging Pig and Friar Sand. The old demon took his seat on
 his throne while the little devils pushed Sanzang to the foot of the
 steps and forced him to kneel on the floor.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you from, monk,&#8221; the demon asked, &#8220;and how can you have
 the effrontery to steal my clothes in broad daylight?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have been sent to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven by
 the emperor of Great Tang in the East,&#8221; replied Sanzang. &#8220;As I was
 hungry I sent my senior disciple to beg for food. He has not come back
 yet, and it was because I ignored his good advice that I blundered into
 your immortal hall to shelter from the wind, never imagining that my
 disciples would be so grasping as to steal your clothes. As I have no
 such wicked thoughts I told them to take the clothes straight back, but
 they paid no attention and insisted on putting them on to warm their
 backs. Never did I imagine that we would fall into Your Majesty's trap
 and be captured. I beg you in your mercy to spare our lives so that we
 can fetch the scriptures. We will be eternally indebted to Your Majesty
 and your praises will be sung for ever after we return to the East.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But I'm always hearing people say that if you eat the flesh of the
 Tang Priest, white hair can be turned black, and teeth that have fallen
 out will grow again,&#8221; said the demon with a grin. &#8220;You've come along
 today without even having been asked, and now you expect me to spare
 you! What's your senior disciple called, and where has he gone
 begging?&#8221;</P>
<P>This question started Pig bragging: &#8220;My elder brother is Sun Wukong,
 the Great Sage Equaling Heaven who made havoc in Heaven five hundred
 years ago.&#8221;</P>
<P>This news shocked the demon speechless. &#8220;I've long heard of that
 damned ape's enormous powers,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;and now I'm meeting him
 when I least expected to. Little ones,&#8221; he ordered, &#8220;tie the Tang
 Priest up, take my precious coats off the other two, and fetch a couple
 of ropes to bind them. Take them to the back, and when I've caught the
 senior disciple we can scrub them all clean, put them in the steamer
 and cook them.&#8221; The little demons acknowledged his orders then bound
 the three of them together and carried them to the back. They tethered
 the white horse by the trough, took the luggage indoors, and sharpened
 their weapons ready to capture Monkey.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey, meanwhile, who had filled his begging bowl with rice in the
 farmhouse to the South, rode his cloud back and landed it on a stretch
 of level ground on the mountainside to find the Tang Priest gone he
 knew not where. The circle he had drawn with his cudgel was still
 there, but travelers and horse had disappeared. When he looked towards
 where the buildings had been they had vanished too: all that could be
 seen were mountains and grotesquely shaped rocks.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't tell me!&#8221; he thought with horror. &#8220;They've been caught.&#8221; He
 rushed after them, following the horse's prints Westwards.</P>
<P>About two miles later, when he was feeling thoroughly gloomy, he
 heard voices on the other side of the slope to the North of him. When
 he looked he saw an old man in felt clothes, a warm hat and a pair of
 worn oiled cloth boots holding a dragon-headed stick and followed by a
 slave boy. The old man had broken off a sprig of plum blossom and was
 singing a song as he came down the slope. Monkey put down his begging
 bowl and looked the old man in the face as he put his hands together
 and said, &#8220;Greetings, grandfather.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you from, reverend sir?&#8221; replied the old man, returning
 his bow.</P>
<P>&#8220;We are monks from the East going to the Western Heaven to worship
 the Buddha and fetch the scriptures,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;There are four of
 us altogether, a master and three disciples. I went off to beg for some
 food as my master was hungry, so I told the other three to wait for me
 at a stretch of level ground on that mountainside. When I came back
 they had gone, and I don't know which way they went. May I ask you if
 you have seen them, grandfather?&#8221;</P>
<P>The question made the old man chortle. &#8220;Did one of the three have a
 long snout and big ears?&#8221; he asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes, yes,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;And was there another with an evil-looking mug leading a white
 horse, and a fat monk with a white face?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's right, that's right,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Then you've all lost your way,&#8221; said the old man. &#8220;Don't bother
 looking for them: It's every man for himself.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The white-faced one is my master and the funny-looking ones are my
 brother disciples,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;We're all set on going to the
 Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures. Of course I've got to look for
 them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When I came this way just now I saw that they had lost their way and
 were heading straight into the demon's mouth,&#8221; the old man said.</P>
<P>&#8220;I would be very grateful, grandfather,&#8221; replied Monkey, &#8220;if you
 could tell me which demon it is and where he lives. I want to call on
 him and ask for them back so that we can go on with our journey to the
 Western Heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This mountain is called Mount Jindou and there is a Jindou Cave in
 front of it,&#8221; the old man replied. &#8220;In the cave lives the Great King
 Rhinoceros. His magic abilities are enormous and he is very powerful.
 All three of your people must be dead by now. If you go looking for
 them you might not even be able to keep yourself alive. The best thing
 would be not to go there. I won't try to stop you or to keep you
 here&#8212;I simply leave you to think it over.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey bowed again to thank the old man and said, &#8220;Thank you,
 venerable sir, for your advice. But I have to search for them.&#8221; Tipping
 the rice out and giving it to the old man he put his begging bowl away,
 at which the old man put down his stick to accept the bowl, which he
 handed to his slave.</P>
<P>Then they both resumed their normal form, fell to their knees, and
 kowtowed saying, &#8220;Great Sage, we dare not try to deceive you. We two
 are the mountain deity and local god of this place, and we've been
 waiting here to receive you, Great Sage. We'll look after the rice and
 your begging bowl to make it easier for you to use your magic powers.
 When you've rescued the Tang Priest you can do your duty to him by
 giving him the food.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Hairy devils,&#8221; shouted Monkey, &#8220;you deserve a flogging. If you knew
 I was here why didn't you meet me earlier, instead of skulking around
 in disguise? It's a disgrace!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Because you have such a quick temper, Great Sage, we did not want to
 rush in and offend you,&#8221; the local god replied. &#8220;That was why we
 disguised ourselves to tell you all that.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;we'll postpone that beating. Look after my
 bowl while I capture that evil spirit.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Great Sage then tightened his belt of tiger sinew, hitched up his
 tigerskin kilt, took his gold-banded cudgel in his hands, and headed
 straight for the mountain in search of the cave. As he rounded a sheer
 wall he saw a pair of stone doors set among rocks beside the blue-green
 rock-face. Outside the doors a crowd of little devils were practicing
 with sword and spear. Indeed, there were,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Auspicious clouds,</P>
<P>Green lichens,</P>
<P>Rows of strange and craggy rocks,</P>
<P>Steep paths winding around.</P>
<P>Apes howled and birds sang in the beauty of nature;</P>
<P>Phoenixes flew and danced in this land of immortals.</P>
<P>The first blooms were open on plum trees facing South;</P>
<P>A thousand bamboos were green in the sun's warmth.</P>
<P>Under the cliff,</P>
<P>Deep in the gorge:</P>
<P>Under the cliff the snow was piled up white;</P>
<P>Deep in the gorge the stream had turned to ice.</P>
<P>Stands of cypress and pine preserved ancient beauty;</P>
<P>Camellia bushes all bloomed with the same red.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Without waiting to have a thorough look the Great Sage made straight
 for the doors and shouted at the top of his voice, &#8220;Little devils, go
 straight in and tell your master that I'm Sun Wukong, the Great Sage
 Equaling Heaven and the disciple of the holy Tang Priest, Tell him to
 send my master out at once if you lot don't all want to be killed.&#8221;</P>
<P>The little devils all hurried in to report, &#8220;Your Majesty, there's a
 monk at the gate with a hairy face and a crooked mouth. He's called the
 Great Sage Equaling Heaven Sun Wukong and he's asking for his master
 back.&#8221;</P>
<P>The demon was delighted to hear this. &#8220;Just the person I wanted to
 come,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Ever since leaving my palace and coming down to the
 mortal world I've had no chance to try out my martial skills. Now that
 he's here I'll have a worthy foe. Bring me my weapons, little ones,&#8221; he
 ordered. All the big and little devils in the cave braced themselves
 and carried out as quickly as they could a twelve-foot-long steel spear
 that they handed to the old demon, who gave them their instructions:
 &#8220;Little ones, you must keep in neat formation. Those who advance will
 be rewarded, and anyone who retreats will be executed.&#8221;</P>
<P>Having been given their orders the little devils charged out through
 the doors behind the old demon, who shouted, &#8220;Who is Sun Wukong?&#8221;
 Monkey stepped across from beside the entrance to see how ugly and
 murderous the demon king looked:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A single jagged horn,</P>
<P>A pair of bright eyes.</P>
<P>The thick skin protruded above his head,</P>
<P>Black flesh shone by his ears.</P>
<P>When he stretched his tongue he could lick his snout;</P>
<P>His mouth when opened wide showed yellow teeth.</P>
<P>His hair was indigo-blue,</P>
<P>His muscles hard as steel.</P>
<P>He was like a rhinoceros, but could not see through water,</P>
<P>Resembled a buffalo but could not plough.</P>
<P>Not useful like the ox who lows at the moon,</P>
<P>He could easily scare the sky and shake the earth.</P>
<P>His purple hands were knotted with muscle,</P>
<P>As he stood erect with his spear of steel.</P>
<P>One only had to consider his hideous looks</P>
<P>To see why he deserved to be called Rhinoceros King.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your grandpa Monkey is here,&#8221; said the Great Sage Monkey, stepping
 forward. &#8220;Give me back my master and neither of us will be hurt. But if
 there's so much as half a 'no' from you I'll kill you, and there'll be
 nowhere to bury your remains.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll get you, you impudent devil of an ape,&#8221; the demon roared back.
 &#8220;What powers do you have that give you the nerve to talk like that?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Evidently you've not seen them yet,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your master stole my clothes,&#8221; said the demon, &#8220;and now I've caught
 him and am going to cook and eat him. What sort of tough guy do you
 think you are, daring to come here to ask for him back?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My master is a loyal, upright and good monk: he couldn't possibly
 have stolen any of your devilish goods,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;I made a magic villa by the mountain path,&#8221; the demon said, &#8220;and
 your master crept inside. He was so carried away by his greed that he
 stole three quilted brocade waistcoats. I caught him red-handed. If you
 really have any powers I'll give you a fight. Hold out against me for
 three rounds and I'll spare your master's life; fail and you go to the
 underworld with him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Shut up, damned beast,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;A fight would suit me fine.
 Come here and try a taste of my cudgel.&#8221; The monster was not at all
 afraid to fight, and he thrust his spear at Monkey's head, It was a
 superb battle. Just watch:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The gold-banded cudgel was raised,</P>
<P>The long-handled spear parried.</P>
<P>The gold-banded cudgel was raised,</P>
<P>Flashing like a golden snake of lightning.</P>
<P>The long-handled spear parried,</P>
<P>Glistening like a dragon emerging from the sea.</P>
<P>Outside the doors the little devils beat their drums,</P>
<P>Drawn up in battle order to add to his might,</P>
<P>While the Great Sage showed his skill,</P>
<P>Displaying his abilities freely all around.</P>
<P>On one side a spear and spirits braced,</P>
<P>Against it a cudgel and martial prowess.</P>
<P>Indeed it was hero set against hero,</P>
<P>A pair of well-matched foes.</P>
<P>The demon king breathed out coiling purple mists</P>
<P>While the gleam of the Great Sage's eyes formed coloured clouds</P>
<P>Only because the Tang Priest was in trouble</P>
<P>Did both of them fight so bitterly without quarter.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After thirty inconclusive rounds the demon king could see that Sun
 Wukong was a complete master of the cudgel who could advance or retreat
 without leaving any openings. &#8220;What a splendid ape,&#8221; he kept saying
 with admiration, &#8220;what a splendid ape. This was the skill that made
 havoc in Heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey too was impressed by the demon king's neat spearwork as he
 parried to left and right with great skill. &#8220;What a splendid spirit,&#8221;
 he said, &#8220;what a splendid spirit. He really is a demon who would know
 how to steal elixir pills.&#8221; The two of them then fought another ten or
 twenty rounds.</P>
<P>The demon king touched the ground with the tip of his spear and
 ordered his little devils forward. All those wretched fiends surrounded
 the Great Sage with their cutlasses, staves, swords and spears. Monkey
 was completely unafraid.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm glad you've come along,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;glad you've come along.
 Just what I wanted.&#8221; With his gold-banded cudgel he blocked and parried
 them in front and behind and to both sides, but the devils would not
 give ground. Losing his patience, Monkey threw his cudgel into the air,
 shouted, &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned it into over a thousand cudgels that came
 raining down from the sky like flying snakes, terrifying the devils out
 of their wits and sending them scurrying back to their cave for their
 lives with their hands over their heads.</P>
<P>&#8220;Behave yourself, ape,&#8221; said the demon with a mocking laugh, &#8220;and
 watch this trick.&#8221; He immediately pulled out from his sleeve a gleaming
 white ring that he threw up into the air with a shout of &#8220;Get them!&#8221; It
 came whirling down, catching all the gold-banded cudgels inside it, and
 forcing Monkey to somersault away for his life as he was now disarmed.
 While the demon king returned to his cave in triumph Brother Monkey was
 at his wit's end. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Way grew by one foot but the demon grew by ten.</P>
<P>Blind and confused, they failed to see that the house was fake.</P>
<P>Alas there was no place to be found for the dharma body:</P>
<P>In action and in thoughts they had made a great mistake.</P>
<I>
<P>&nbsp;
</I>
<P>If you don't know how all this ended, listen to the explanation in
 the next installment.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P></P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="1_0_52">Chapter 51</A></H3>
</I>
<P>In Vain Does the Mind-Ape Use a Thousand Tricks</P>
<P>Fire and Water Fail to Harm the Demon</P>
</B>
<P>The story tells how the Great Sage Equaling Heaven went empty-handed
 and beaten to sit down behind Mount Jindou, tears streaming from both
 eyes.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; he called out, &#8220;I had hoped</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As Lord Buddha graciously brought us together</P>
<P>To go on to live with you, Master, for ever,</P>
<P>With you to train and to learn to be free.</P>
<P>Of the favours received ever mindful I'd be.</P>
<P>Our hearts were both joined and our fates were entwined;</P>
<P>As we studied the Way we shared the same mind.</P>
<P>I never expected to be at my wit's end</P>
<P>Unable to win with no stick in my hand.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Just when he was in the depths of misery Monkey thought, &#8220;That fiend
 knew who I was. I remember him saying something about the sort of skill
 that made havoc in Heaven when he was praising me during the fight.
 That means he can't be a common mortal monster: he must be an evil star
 from Heaven come down to earth for love of worldly things. I don't know
 where he come down from, so I'd better go up to Heaven to make some
 inquiries.&#8221;</P>
<P>Only then did Monkey start using his mind and taking the initiative
 again. At once he somersaulted up on an auspicious cloud, going
 straight to the Southern Gate of Heaven, where he looked up to see the
 Broad-visioned Heavenly King Virupaksa bowing to him in greeting and
 saying, &#8220;Where are you going, Great Sage?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's something I must see the Jade Emperor about,&#8221; said Monkey.
 &#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It is my turn today to supervise the Southern Gate of Heaven,&#8221;
 Virupaksa replied, and before he could finish the four marshals Ma,
 Zhao, Wen and Guan bowed and said, &#8220;Great Sage, we failed to greet you.
 Will you have some tea?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm busy,&#8221; Monkey replied, and taking his leave of Virupaksa and the
 four marshals he went in through the gate and headed straight for the
 Hall of Miraculous Mist, where the four Heavenly Teachers Zhang
 Daoling, Ge Xianweng, Xu Jingyang and Qiu Hongji, the Six Officers of
 the Southern Dipper and the Seven Originals of the Northern Dipper all
 raised their hands in greeting to him in front of the palace hall.</P>
<P>&#8220;For what purpose are you here, Great Sage?&#8221; they asked, adding.
 &#8220;Have you yet finished escorting the Tang Priest?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's too early to be talking like that yet,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;It is
 a very long journey with many a demon along the way and we've only
 completed half of it. At present we are in trouble at the Jindou Gave
 in Mount Jindou, where a rhinoceros spirit has grabbed my master and
 taken him into the cave. When I went there and fought him he had such
 tremendous magic powers that he seized my gold-banded cudgel. It's
 impossible for me to capture him. That's why I've come to accuse the
 Jade Emperor of lax supervision.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're as wild and wicked as ever, you ape,&#8221; said Xu Jingyang with a
 smile.</P>
<P>&#8220;No I'm not,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;I've spoken bluntly all my life as
 it's the only way to get anywhere.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's enough of this talking,&#8221; said Heavenly Teacher Zhang Daoling.
 &#8220;We will report your arrival.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Thank you very much,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>The four Heavenly Teachers reported all this to the Hall of
 Miraculous Mist and then took Monkey to the jade steps to the throne.
 Monkey make a loud &#8220;re-e-er&#8221; of respect then said, &#8220;Well, old man, I'm
 here to bother you. I won't bore you with all the dangers of escorting
 the Tang Priest to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven, but
 we've now reached the Jindou Cave on Mount Jindou where a rhinoceros
 demon has captured the Tang Priest and taken him to his cave. I don't
 know whether the demon's planning to steam, boil or dry him. When I
 went to the cave and fought him he knew who I was, and he really does
 have miraculous powers. He's taken my gold-banded cudgel, so I can't
 capture him. I think he must be an evil star from Heaven gone down to
 earth for the love of worldly things, which is why I've come here to
 submit a request. I beg Your Celestial Majesty in your mercy and
 perception to order an inspection of the evil stars and to send troops
 to capture the demon. I'm shaking with fear of Your Majesty.&#8221; He then
 made a deep bow and added, &#8220;I beg to submit this report.&#8221;</P>
<P>Ge Xianweng, who was standing at the side of the hall, smiled as he
 said, &#8220;Why is it that you were recalcitrant before but are respectful
 now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's not that,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;not that at all. I haven't become
 respectful. It's just that I don't have my cudgel today.&#8221;</P>
<P>Having heard Monkey's memorial the Jade Emperor sent an order
 straight to the star officer Kehan: &#8220;Please inspect all the stars in
 all the heavens and find out if any of the divine kings of any of the
 constellations have gone down to earth out of love for worldly things.
 Report back afterwards.&#8221; Having been given this command the True Lord
 Kehan went off with the Great Sage to make his inspection. First they
 went to see the divine kings and the officials at the four gates of
 Heaven. Then they inspected all the True Ones within the Three Little
 Enclosures; the Thunder Officers Tao, Zhang, Xin, Deng, Gou, Bi, Pang
 and Liu; and the Thirty-three Heavens, every one of which was in place.
 Next they checked the twenty-eight zodiacal constellations: Horn,
 Gullet, Base, Chamber, Orion, Tail, and Winnower in the East; Dipper,
 Ox, Woman, Barrens, Roof, House and Wall to the West; and the
 constellations of the North and South as well; but every constellation
 was peacefully in its place. They inspected the Seven Powers of Sun,
 Moon, Water, Fire, Wood, Metal, and Earth; and the Four Others&#8212;Rahu,
 Ketu, the Gases and the Comets. None of the stars in the sky had gone
 down to earth for love of worldly things.</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;my journey to the Hall of Miraculous
 Mist was for nothing. I've disturbed His Jade Majesty&#8212;it was most
 inconvenient of me. You had better go and report back. I'll be waiting
 here for your reply.&#8221; The True Lord Kehan did as he had been told, and
 Monkey began a long wait. He made up a poem to record his feelings that
 went,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Pure winds, a cloudless sky, and blissful peace;</P>
<P>Calm gods, bright shining stars, and blessings clear.</P>
<P>Still is the Milky Way; Heaven's troubles cease;</P>
<P>Throughout the world no sounds of war we hear.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The True Lord Kehan reported back to the Jade Emperor on his thorough
 inspection: &#8220;No star or constellation in the sky is missing. All the
 regional gods ad officers are present, and nobody has gone down to
 earth for love of worldly things.&#8221; Having heard this report the Jade
 Emperor ordered that Sun Wukong was to select some heavenly generals to
 take down to earth to catch the demon.</P>
<P>When the four Heavenly Teachers had been given this order they left
 the Hall of Miraculous Mist and said to Monkey, &#8220;Great Sage, the Jade
 Emperor in his generosity orders you to select some heavenly generals
 to take down to earth to catch the demon as none of the stars has gone
 down there for love of worldly things.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey bowed down and thought, &#8220;Most of the heavenly generals are not
 as good as I am: few are any better. When I made havoc in Heaven the
 Jade Emperor sent a hundred thousand of his heavenly soldiers who
 spread out heaven-and-earth nets, but not one of those commanders dared
 to fight it out with me. The only one who was a match for me was the
 Little Sage Erlang he sent later. That demon's powers are as good as
 mine, so how will I ever be able to beat him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Times have changed,&#8221; said the Heavenly Teacher Xu Jingyang. &#8220;As the
 saying goes, everything can always be beaten by something. Would you
 dare to disobey an imperial edict? Choose some heavenly generals
 according to your illustrious judgement and don't waste time: it could
 be disastrous.</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;I am very grateful to His Majesty for
 his kindness, and I would not dare disobey his commands. Besides, I
 don't want to have made this journey for nothing. So please ask the
 Jade Emperor to send Heavenly King Li the Pagoda-carrier and Prince
 Nezha. They have demon-subduing weapons, so let's see what happens if
 they go down to earth and fight that fiend. If they can catch him I'll
 be in luck, and if they can't we'll have to think again.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Heavenly Teacher reported this to the Jade Emperor, who ordered
 Heavenly King Li and his son Prince Nezha to take their heavenly troops
 to Help Monkey. The Heavenly King obediently went to see Monkey, who
 said to the Heavenly Teacher, &#8220;I am extremely grateful to the Jade
 Emperor for sending the Heavenly King. There is another request I would
 like you to pass on. I would like two thunder gods to stand in the
 clouds while the Heavenly King is fighting the demon and kill him by
 throwing thunder splinters at his head. This would be a very good
 method.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Splendid, splendid,&#8221; said the Heavenly Teacher, and he reported this
 request to the Jade Emperor, who then ordered the Office of the Nine
 Heavens to send the thunder gods Deng Hua and Zhang Fan to help
 Heavenly King Li capture the demon. They then went out through the
 Southern Gate of Heaven with the Heavenly King and the Great Sage.</P>
<P>They were soon there. &#8220;This is Mount Jindou,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;and the
 Jindou Cave is in it. I would like you gentlemen to decide which of you
 is going to be the first to challenge the demon to battle.&#8221; The
 Heavenly King brought his cloud to a stop and encamped his troops under
 the Southern slopes of the mountain.</P>
<P>&#8220;As you know, Great Sage,&#8221; he said, &#8220;my boy Nezha has put down the
 demons in ninety-six different caves, is very good at transformation,
 and always carries his demon-subduing weapons around with him. He
 should go into battle first.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's right,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'll take him with me.&#8221;</P>
<P>The prince summoned up his martial prowess, leapt to the mountaintop
 with the Great Sage, and went straight to the entrance to the cave,
 where they found the doors tightly closed and not an evil spirit to be
 seen by the rock-face. &#8220;Vicious fiend,&#8221; shouted Monkey, going up to the
 doors, &#8220;open up at once and give me back my master.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the little devils guarding the doors saw this they hurried back
 to report, &#8220;Your Majesty, Sun the Novice has a little boy with him and
 he's challenging you to battle outside the doors.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've got his gold-banded cudgel,&#8221; the demon king said, &#8220;and he'd
 find it hard to fight me empty-handed, so I suppose he must have found
 some reinforcements. Fetch my weapons!&#8221; He then went outside to look,
 brandishing his spear. The little boy was a pure and remarkable sight,
 and full of strength and vigor. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>His face was like the moon when it is full,</P>
<P>Red lips, a square-cut mouth, and silver teeth.</P>
<P>His eye shot lightning from their fearsome pupils;</P>
<P>Over his broad and fine-hued brow were tufts of hair.</P>
<P>His sash danced in the wind like tongues of flame;</P>
<P>A silken gown gleamed golden in the sun.</P>
<P>Bright rings held a bronze mirror at his chest,</P>
<P>And precious armor set off well his warrior's boots.</P>
<P>Tiny in body, but mighty in his voice,</P>
<I>
<P>Terrible Nezha, protector of the faith.
</I>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're Heavenly King Li's third son, Prince Nezha,&#8221; said the demon
 with a smile. &#8220;Why have you come shouting at my door?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Because you have made trouble, vicious fiend, by harming the holy
 monk from the East. I'm here to arrest you at the command of the Jade
 Emperor.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm sure Sun Wukong must have asked you here,&#8221; said the demon king
 in a great fury. &#8220;Yes, I'm the demon who's got the holy monk. I wonder
 what fighting skills you've got, little boy, if you dare to talk such
 nonsense. Stay where you are and see how you like my spear.&#8221;</P>
<P>The prince met the thrust at once with his demon-beheading sword.
 Once the two of them had come to blows the battle began. Monkey rushed
 round the mountain shouting, &#8220;Where are the thunder gods? Hurry up and
 strike the fiend with your thunder splinters to help the prince subdue
 him.&#8221;</P>
<P>The thunder gods Deng and Zhang stepped at once on their clouds and
 were just about to strike when Prince Nezha used magic to give himself
 three heads and six arms that wielded six weapons with which he hacked
 at the monster. The demon king then gave himself three heads and six
 arms too, holding three long spears with which he parried them. The
 prince next used his demon-subduing dharma power and threw his six
 weapons up into the air. What were the six weapons? The demon-beheading
 sword, the demon-hacking cutlass, the demon-binding rope, the
 demon-quelling pestle, the embroidered ball and the fire-wheel.</P>
<P>Nezha shouted &#8220;Change!&#8221; and each one of them became ten, each ten a
 hundred, each hundred a thousand, and each thousand ten thousand of the
 same weapons that flew at the demon like a hailstorm. The demon king
 was not afraid in the least. Bringing out his gleaming white ring he
 threw it into the air with a shout of &#8220;Catch them!&#8221; and as it came
 whistling down it trapped all the six different kinds of weapons, so
 terrifying Nezha that he fled for his life empty-handed. The demon king
 returned to his cave in triumph.</P>
<P>When the two thunder gods saw this from up in the sky they smiled to
 themselves and said, &#8220;It's a good thing we realized how things were
 going and didn't throw our thunder splinters. If he'd caught them too
 we'd never have dared report back to the Heavenly Honoured Ones.&#8221; The
 pair of them landed their clouds and went with the prince to the
 Southern slope of the mountain.</P>
<P>&#8220;The demon king really has got enormous powers,&#8221; they told Heavenly
 King Li.</P>
<P>&#8220;The wretched demon's magic powers are nothing much,&#8221; said Monkey
 with a laugh, &#8220;apart from that terrible ring. I wonder what sort of
 treasure it is and why it can catch everything when it's thrown into
 the air.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't have a shred of humanity in you, Great Sage,&#8221; said Nezha
 angrily. &#8220;We're thoroughly upset after being beaten, and all for your
 sake too. What have you got to laugh about?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You may be upset, but what makes you imagine I'm not?&#8221; Monkey
 replied. &#8220;I'm at my wit's end, and as I can't cry about it, laughing's
 the only thing I can do.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How are we going to bring all this to an end?&#8221; the Heavenly King
 asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;You lot can make whatever plans you like,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;but we can
 only capture him with what his ring can't catch.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The best things his ring can't catch are water and fire,&#8221; said
 Heavenly King Li. &#8220;As the saying goes, water and fire show no mercy.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Sit still here while I go up to
 Heaven again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What for?&#8221; the two thunder gods asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;This time I won't bother with a memorial to the Jade Emperor,&#8221; said
 Brother Monkey. &#8220;I'll go straight in through the Southern Gate of
 Heaven to the Palace of Crimson Splendor to ask Yinghuo, the Star Lord
 of Fire, to come here and start a fire that will burn the demon and
 perhaps even reduce his ring to ashes so that we can capture him. Then
 you can have your weapons back and return to Heaven and my master can
 be saved.&#8221;</P>
<P>The prince was greatly cheered up to hear this. &#8220;Please don't lose
 any time, Great Sage,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and get back as soon as you can. We'll
 wait here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey set his auspicious light going again and went straight back to
 the Southern Gate of Heaven, where Virupaksa and the four generals met
 him and asked, &#8220;Why are you back again, Great Sage?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Heavenly King Li sent Prince Nezha into battle,&#8221; Monkey replied,
 &#8220;but in their first fight the demon king took all his six weapons. I
 now want to go to the Palace of Crimson Splendor to ask the Star Lord
 of Fire to help us in the fight.&#8221; The four generals let him in, not
 daring to delay him any longer.</P>
<P>When he reached the Palace of Crimson Splendor the gods of fire all
 went in to report, &#8220;Sun Wukong is here to see you, my lord.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Star Lord of Fire of the South straightened up his clothes and
 came out to greet him with the words, &#8220;Kehan was here to inspect us
 yesterday, and nobody here is longing for earthly things.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I know,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Heavenly King Li and Prince Nezha have
 been defeated in battle and lost their weapons, which is why I have
 come here to ask for your help.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Nezha is the God of the Third Altar, the Seas, who first made his
 name by subduing ninety-six caves of demons,&#8221; the Star Lord of Fire
 replied. &#8220;His magical powers are tremendous, so if he can't subdue the
 fiend what hope would I have of doing so?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've discussed it with Heavenly King Li,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Water and
 fire are the most powerful things in heaven and earth. That fiend has a
 ring that can catch things. I don't know what treasure it is. As they
 say that fire can destroy everything I've come here to ask you, Star
 Lord, to lead your fire forces down to the mortal world to burn up that
 evil monster and rescue my master.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the Star Lord of Fire heard this he mustered his divine troops
 and went with Monkey to the Southern slopes of Mount Jindou, where he
 exchanged greetings with the Heavenly King and the thunder gods. &#8220;Great
 Sage Sun,&#8221; said Heavenly King Li, &#8220;call that demon out again and I'll
 start fighting him. When he throws his ring I'll get out of the way and
 the Star Lord can lead his forces to burn him up.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'll go with you.&#8221; The Fire Star Lord stood with
 Prince Nezha and two thunder gods on a high peak to challenge the demon
 to battle.</P>
<P>When the Great Sage reached the mouth of the Jindou Cave he shouted,
 &#8220;Open up! Give me my master back at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Sun Wukong's back,&#8221; the little devils reported with urgency, and the
 demon led his horde out of the cave to say to Monkey, &#8220;Impudent ape,
 what soldiers have you brought here?&#8221;</P>
<P>Heavenly King Li, the Pagoda-carrier, came forward to shout back,
 &#8220;Vicious monster, do you know who I am&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Heavenly King Li,&#8221; replied the demon with a laugh, &#8220;no doubt you
 want to avenge your distinguished son and get his weapons back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I want my revenge and his weapons,&#8221; replied the Heavenly King, &#8220;and
 I'm also going to catch you and rescue the Tang Priest. Stay where you
 are while I get you with my sword.&#8221; The demon dodged the cut and thrust
 back with his spear. The two of them fought a magnificent fight in
 front of the cave. Just watch:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Heavenly King hacked with his sword,</P>
<P>The demon's spear parried.</P>
<P>The sword gleamed cold and breathed out fire,</P>
<P>The sharp spear belched out baleful clouds.</P>
<P>One was the monster who had grown up in Jindou Cave;</P>
<P>The other had been sent from the Hall of Miraculous Mist.</P>
<P>One wished to use his might to oppress the dharma nature;</P>
<P>One was employing his greatness to rescue the priest.</P>
<P>The Heavenly King's powers made sand and gravel fly,</P>
<P>The demon fighting back stirred up the dust.</P>
<P>The dust cast heaven and earth in darkness,</P>
<P>The sand and gravel made seas and livers turbid.</P>
<P>The two of them struggled hard for victory</P>
<P>Because the Tang Priest wanted to see the Buddha.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Monkey saw the two of them starting to fight he jumped up to the
 highest peak and said to the Star Lord of Fire, &#8220;Pay attention.&#8221; Watch
 as the demon produces his ring again when the fight is at its fiercest.
 When Heavenly King Li saw this he set his auspicious light moving and
 fled in defeat. At once the Star Lord of Fire issued the order to his
 troops from his peak to release all their fire together. It was a
 terrifying sight:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Classic says that in the South is the essence of fire.</P>
<P>Even a single spark</P>
<P>Can burn a hundred thousand acres.</P>
<P>The might of the Star Lord</P>
<P>Could create a hundred different kinds of fire.</P>
<P>He had fire spears, fire swords,</P>
<P>Fire bows and crossbows,</P>
<P>And all his gods used different weapons.</P>
<P>The sky was filled with cawing crows of fire.</P>
<P>Fire horses galloped on the mountaintops.</P>
<P>Fire rats came in twos,</P>
<P>Fire dragons in pairs.</P>
<P>The fire rats coming in twos breathed flame,</P>
<P>Making a thousand miles glow red;</P>
<P>The pairs of fire dragons belched thick smoke,</P>
<P>Casting a pall of darkness all around.</P>
<P>The fire carts were brought out,</P>
<P>The fire gourds opened up.</P>
<P>When fire banners waved the skies glowed sunset-red;</P>
<P>Fire cudgels made the whole earth blaze.</P>
<P>Compared with this the charge of burning oxen was nothing;</P>
<P>This beat Zhou Yu's fire ships attacking Red Crag.</P>
<P>It was a terrible heavenly conflagration,</P>
<P>A blazing burning storm of fire.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>But the onslaught by the fire did not frighten the demon in the
 least. He threw his ring up into the air, and as it came whistling down
 it caught the fire dragons, fire horses, fire crows, fire rats, fire
 swords, fire spears, fire bows and fire arrows. The demon then led his
 troops back to his cave in victory.</P>
<P>The Fire Star Lord, holding a useless banner, called back his
 officers and went to sit with Heavenly King Li and the others on the
 Southern slope of the mountain. &#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; he said to Monkey, &#8220;I've
 never seen so ferocious a demon before. Now I've lost all my
 fire-raising equipment what am I to do?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop complaining,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile. &#8220;Will you gentlemen
 please sit here for a while while I go off again?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you going this time?&#8221; Heavenly King Li asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;If that fiend isn't bothered by fire I'm sure he must be vulnerable
 to water. As the saying goes, water defeats fire. I'm going to the
 Northern Gate of Heaven to ask the Star Lord of Water, the planet
 Mercury, to use the power of water to flood the cave and drown the
 demon king. Then I'll be able to return you all your things.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's a very good idea,&#8221; said the Heavenly King, &#8220;except that I'm
 afraid your master might be drowned too.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No problem,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Even if he is drowned I have a way that
 will bring him back to life. But I'm wasting your time, gentlemen, and
 that is quite wrong.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said the Star Lord of Fire, &#8220;please be on your way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage went straight to the Northern Gate of Heaven
 by his somersault cloud. He looked up to see the Heavenly King
 Vaisravana bowing to him and asking, &#8220;Where are you going, Great Sage
 Sun?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There is something about which I must see the Star Lord of Water in
 his Palace of Dark Vastness,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It is my turn to patrol today.&#8221; Vaisravana replied. As he was
 speaking the four heavenly generals Pang, Liu, Gou and Bi greeted him
 courteously and offered him tea.</P>
<P>&#8220;As I'm in such a hurry I won't trouble you,&#8221; said Monkey, and taking
 his leave of them he went straight to the Palace of Dark Vastness,
 where he sent all the gods of Water in to announce him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Sun Wukong, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven, is here,&#8221; they reported.
 As soon as he learned this the Star Lord of Water dismissed the gods of
 the Four Seas, the Five Lakes, the Eight Rivers, the Four Streams, the
 Three Great Watercourses and the Nine Tributaries, as well as all the
 dragon kings, then straightened his hat, tightened his belt, and went
 out through the gates of the palace to greet him and lead him inside.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yesterday Kehan came here on his inspection,&#8221; the Star Lord said.
 &#8220;He wondered if any of my Water gods had become demons because they
 longed for worldly things. We are checking all the gods of rivers, seas
 and streams but have not yet finished.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That demon king's no river god,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;He's a much more
 powerful spirit. The Jade Emperor sent Heavenly King Li, Prince Nezha
 and two thunder gods down to the lower world to capture him, but he
 caught Nezha's six magic weapons with a ring. So I had to go up to the
 Palace of Crimson Splendor to ask the Star Lord of Fire to take all his
 fire gods to start fires, but the fiend caught the fire dragons, fire
 horses and everything else with his ring. I reckon that as he isn't
 bothered by fire he must be vulnerable to water, which is why I've come
 here to ask you to deploy your water, capture the fiend for me, return
 the heavenly generals' weapons, and rescue my master too.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the Star Lord of Water heard this he ordered the Earl of the
 Yellow River to go with the Great Sage to help him. &#8220;I can carry water
 in this,&#8221; said the river earl, taking a white jade bowl from his
 sleeve.</P>
<P>&#8220;But that can't hold very much,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;How could it possibly
 drown the fiend?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm not lying when I tell you that this bowl can hold the waters of
 the Yellow River,&#8221; the earl replied. &#8220;Half a bowlful is half the river,
 and the whole bowlful is the whole river.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Half a bowlful will be all we need,&#8221; replied a delighted Monkey, who
 then took his leave of the Star God of Water and hurried out through
 the gates of Heaven with the Earl of the Yellow River.</P>
<P>The earl half filled his bowl in the Yellow River then went with the
 Great Sage to Mount Jindou, where he greeted the Heavenly King, the
 prince, the two thunder gods and the Star Lord of Fire, who started
 telling him what had happened until Monkey said, &#8220;Cut out the details.
 River earl, come with me. When I shout at the doors telling them to
 open up don't wait till the doors are open. Tip the water straight in
 and drown the whole den of demons. Then I'll fish out the master's body
 and bring him back to life.&#8221;</P>
<P>The earl did as he was told, following Monkey round the mountain to
 the mouth of the cave.</P>
<P>&#8220;Open up, devils,&#8221; Monkey shouted, and when they recognized his voice
 the little devils hurried in to report that he was back, At this the
 demon king went out again, brandishing his spear and taking his
 treasure as the doors opened with a loud noise. The river god threw all
 the water in his white jade bowl into the cave. Seeing it coming, the
 demon threw down his spear and quickly took out his ring to seal the
 inner doors tightly. The water then all surged noisily out again,
 giving Sun Wukong such a fright that he had to give an immediate
 somersault and leap straight back up to the mountaintop with the river
 god. The Heavenly King and the rest of them then stood on their clouds
 in front of the peak looking at the great waves of the mighty flood. It
 was splendid water. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A mere scoopful</P>
<P>Produces fathomless depths;</P>
<P>A divine achievement</P>
<P>Fills a hundred rivers for the general good.</P>
<P>Hear the great roaring shake the valley,</P>
<P>See the mighty waters flood the sky.</P>
<P>A sound like thunder fills the world with awe;</P>
<P>Fierce are the waves with curling crests like snow.</P>
<P>The towering waves now inundate the roads,</P>
<P>While countless billows wash against the mountains.</P>
<P>Cold they are as nephrite,</P>
<P>Rolling with the sound of strings.</P>
<P>As they crash against the rocks they scatter chips of jade;</P>
<P>The waters swirl in eddies as they ebb.</P>
<P>The current sweeps across all dips and hollows,</P>
<P>Filling ravines and joining all the streams.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The sight filled Brother Monkey with alarm. &#8220;This is terrible,&#8221; he
 said. &#8220;The water's flooding the peasants' fields, and going everywhere
 except into the demon's cave. What are we to do?&#8221; He asked the river
 god to put his water away at once.</P>
<P>&#8220;I can only let it out,&#8221; the earl replied. &#8220;I can't put it away
 again. As the saying goes, spilt water can't be picked up.&#8221; Oh dear!
 But as the mountain was both high and steep the water flowed down it
 fast and in a few moments had all gone away along gullies and ravines.</P>
<P>Some little devils leapt out from the cave and played around with
 great pleasure as before, shouting, yelling, shaking their fists,
 waving their sleeves, and brandishing their cudgels and spears. &#8220;So the
 water never got inside the cave at all,&#8221; said the Heavenly King. &#8220;All
 that effort was for nothing.&#8221; Unable to control the great anger that
 surged up him, Monkey charged the demon king's doors, lashing out with
 both fists, shouting, &#8220;Where do you think you're going? I'll get you.&#8221;</P>
<P>The terrified little devils dropped their spears and cudgels and fled
 back into the cave to report in fear and trembling, &#8220;Your Majesty, he's
 attacking again.&#8221;</P>
<P>The demon king went out through the doors, his spear at the ready,
 and said, &#8220;Impudent ape, you're such a hooligan. You've tried and
 failed to beat me several times. Even fire and water have got nowhere
 near me. So why are you here again? To throw your life away?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've got it the wrong way round, my boy,&#8221; said Brother Monkey.
 &#8220;It's not me throwing my life away, but you throwing yours away. Come
 here and I'll punch you one.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're just trying to be awkward, ape,&#8221; the demon king replied with
 a laugh. &#8220;You can use your fists, but I'll use my spear. Your skinny
 little fist is no bigger than a walnut. It's not even the weight of a
 small hammer. Very well then. I'll put my spear down and we'll try some
 boxing.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Well spoken,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile. &#8220;Come on then.&#8221;</P>
<P>The demon then hitched up his clothes and took up a stance with both
 of his fists raised. They were the size of the mallets used in
 oil-presses. The Great Sage spread his feet apart, summoned up his
 energy, and started to show his skill as he traded blows with the demon
 king in front of the doors of the cave, it was a splendid fight.
 Goodness!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>They started with a foursquare stance,</P>
<P>Kicked with pairs of flying feet.</P>
<P>Each threw with menace at the other's chest</P>
<P>Hard blows that could cut out the heart.</P>
<P>The Immortal pointing the way</P>
<P>&#8220;Lao Zi riding his crane.&#8221;</P>
<P>Terrible as the tiger when he falls on his prey,</P>
<P>Vicious as the dragons sporting in the water.</P>
<P>The demon king did a dragon roll;</P>
<P>The Great Sage fought like a roebuck with his antlers.</P>
<P>They kicked up their heels like spitting dragons,</P>
<P>Twisting their wrists like sky-supporting camels.</P>
<P>The blue lion opened its jaws,</P>
<P>The carp leapt so high he risked breaking his back.</P>
<P>Flowers were scattered around their foreheads,</P>
<P>And ropes pulled tight around their waists.</P>
<P>The wind stayed close to the fan,</P>
<P>The driving rain made blossoms fall.</P>
<P>When the demon used a &#8220;Guanyin hand&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey countered with an &#8220;arhat's foot.&#8221;</P>
<P>The longer punches were open and relaxed,</P>
<P>Not as intense as the short jabs to the body.</P>
<P>When they had fought for several dozen rounds</P>
<P>Their skills were equal; no winner had emerged.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>While the two of them fought in front of the cave Heavenly King Li
 and the Star Lord of Fire were shouting and clapping in encouragement
 and admiration. The two thunder gods and Prince Nezha led the armies of
 the gods to leap down by where they were fighting to help Monkey, while
 on the other side the devilish horde all came forward to guard their
 master with banners, drums, swords and cutlasses. Seeing that things
 were going badly Monkey pulled out a handful of hairs, scattered them
 in the air, and with a shout of &#8220;Change!&#8221; turned them into three or
 four dozen little monkeys who rushed forward and held the demon still.</P>
<P>They put their arms round his legs, grabbed him by the waist, jabbed
 at his eyes, and pulled his hair. The demon in his alarm pulled out his
 ring. When Monkey arid the Heavenly King saw him doing this they turned
 their clouds away and fled back to the top of the mountain to keep out
 of the way of the fight. As soon as the demon threw the ring into the
 air it came whistling down, caught the three or four dozen little
 monkeys who were hairs transformed and turned them back into their
 original form. The demon took them into the cave when he led his troops
 back in triumph, shut the doors and celebrated.</P>
<P>&#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; said Prince Nezha, &#8220;you really are a tough guy. That
 was a superb display of boxing, as skilful as putting embroidery on
 brocade. And by magically dividing yourself up you showed him how good
 you are.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You gentlemen were all watching from here,&#8221; said Monkey with a
 smile. &#8220;How did the demon's technique compare with mine?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;His boxing was slack and his footwork slow,&#8221; said Heavenly King Li,
 &#8220;where you were neat and quick. When he saw us going he was worried,
 and when you used your self-dividing magic he was panicked, which was
 why he had to use his ring magic.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The demon king would be easy enough to deal with,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;if
 it weren't for his ring. That's hard one to beat.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If we're to beat him,&#8221; said the Star Lord of Fire to the Earl of the
 Yellow River, &#8220;we have to get that treasure. We'll be able to capture
 him then.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But how else are we to get it apart from by stealing it?&#8221; Monkey
 asked.</P>
<P>The two thunder gods laughed at this and said, &#8220;If we're going to do
 him the honour of stealing it there's nobody to compare with the Great
 Sage. When he made havoc in Heaven he stole imperial wine, magic
 peaches, dragon liver, phoenix bone-marrow and even Lord Lao Zi's
 elixir. That was some skill! Now he ought to be using it to get that
 ring.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You are flattering me,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you are flattering me. You'd
 better sit here while I go and spy things out.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage sprang down from the peak and made his way
 stealthily to the mouth of the cave where he shook himself and turned
 into a most elegant fly. Look at him:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He had wings just as fine as membranes of bamboo,</P>
<P>A body as small as a plum blossom's heart,</P>
<P>His hands and his feet barely thicker than hairs,</P>
<P>And eyes full of lights that both sparkle and dart:</P>
<P>He follows his nose when he smells something good,</P>
<P>And rides on the wind as he flies at great speed.</P>
<P>The scales would not move if he come to be weighed,</P>
<I>
<P>And yet he's a lovable true friend in need.
</I>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He flew quietly to the doors and crawled in through the narrow gap
 between them to see all the devils young and old dancing or singing in
 ranks on either side while the demon king sat on a high dais. Before
 him were set snakemeat, deer jerky, bears' paws, camels' humps, wild
 vegetables from the mountain and fruit. He had a celadon jug of wine as
 well as some delicious-smelling koumiss and coconut toddy, all of which
 he was drinking freely by the large bowlful. Monkey landed among the
 little devils and turned himself into a badger spirit. He inched his
 way nearer to the throne, but even after taking a long look he could
 not make out at all where the treasure was hidden. He quickly withdrew
 and went round behind the throne, where he saw hanging high from the
 ceiling in the rear hall the fire dragons groaning and the fire horses
 whinnying. He looked up to spy his gold-banded cudgel leaning against
 the Eastern wall. This made him so happy that his heart had an itch he
 could not scratch, and forgetting his disguise he went over, picked the
 cudgel up, resumed his own appearance, tried out some movements with
 it, and started to fight his way straight out of the cave. All the
 devils shook with terror, and there was nothing the demon king could do
 about it as Monkey opened up a trail of blood, pushing three over here
 and pulling a couple down there as he went straight out through the
 front doors. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The demon was unready in his pride;</P>
<P>The cudgel went back to its owner's side.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know whether all turned out for good or for ill, listen
 to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

</I>
<P>Monkey Makes Havoc in the Jindou Cave</P>
<P>The Buddha Gives a Hint About the Owner</P>
</B>
<P>The story tells how after recovering his gold-banded cudgel Monkey
 fought his way out of the cave and jumped up to the peak to see all the
 gods. He was very pleased with himself. &#8220;How did it go this time?&#8221;
 asked Heavenly King Li. &#8220;I did a transformation and went into the
 cave,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;where I saw the devils dancing, singing and
 drinking to celebrate their victory. But I heard nothing about where
 the demon keeps his treasure. When I went round to the back I heard the
 horses and dragons whimpering and realized they must be the fire
 beasts. My gold-banded cudgel was leaning against the Eastern wall, so
 I took it and fought my way out of the cave.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You have your treasure now,&#8221; said the gods, &#8220;but how are we going to
 get ours back?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Easy,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;easy. With this iron cudgel I can beat him
 whatever he does. I'll recover your treasures.&#8221; As they were talking
 there rose from the mountainside a concerted sound of gongs and drums
 as well as earth-shaking shouts: the Great Rhinoceros King was leading
 his host of spirits out in pursuit of Monkey, who called out at the
 sight of them, &#8220;Great, great, Just what I want. Please sit down,
 gentlemen, while I go to capture him.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage raised his iron cudgel and struck at the
 demon's face with a shout, &#8220;Where do you think you're going, damned
 demon? Take this!&#8221; Warding the blow off with his spear, the demon
 insulted him back: &#8220;Thieving ape! You're a disgrace. How dare you steal
 my property in broad daylight?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll get you, evil beast. Have the decency to die! All you can do is
 use your ring to steal our property in broad daylight. None of those
 things are really yours. Stay where you are, and take this!&#8221; Once again
 the monster parried with his spear. It was a splendid fight.</P>
<P>The Great Sage was ferocious,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The demon was not gentle.</P>
<P>Both sides fought with courage;</P>
<P>Neither would give in.</P>
<P>The iron cudgel was a dragon's tail,</P>
<P>The long spear was a serpent's head.</P>
<P>Blows from the cudgel whistled like the wind,</P>
<P>The spear's moves flowed as smoothly as a stream.</P>
<P>The mountain darkened, wreathed in coloured mists;</P>
<P>Auspicious clouds hung heavy on the woods.</P>
<P>The birds in the air all stopped their flying;</P>
<P>The wild beasts of the field all hid away.</P>
<P>The demons on one side raised battle cries</P>
<P>While Monkey on the other was Ml of vigor.</P>
<P>An iron club that no one could withstand</P>
<P>Had fought its way along the long road West;</P>
<P>A long spear that was a worthy match,</P>
<P>And always held its power supreme on Mount Jindou.</P>
<P>Once they joined battle there could be no respite:</P>
<P>They swore to carry on until one conquered.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The demon king and the Great Sage had been fighting for six hours
 without either gaining the upper hand. As night was falling the evil
 spirit held out his spear and said, &#8220;Stop, Wukong. It's too dark for
 fighting now. Let's have a night's sleep and I'll go on having it out
 with you tomorrow.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Shut up, damned demon,&#8221; replied Monkey abusively. &#8220;I've only just
 warmed up. I don't care how late it is: I'm going to carry on till one
 of us has won.&#8221; The demon gave a shout, made a feint with his spear,
 and fled for his life, leading his host of devils in retreat back to
 the cave, where they shut the doors tight.</P>
<P>When Monkey returned to the mountain top with his cudgel the gods
 from Heaven all congratulated him. &#8220;You really are strong and capable,
 Great Sage Equaling Heaven,&#8221; they said, &#8220;and your powers are
 boundless.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're overdoing your praises,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Heavenly King Li, coming up to him, &#8220;this is not empty
 praise. You really are a tough guy. The force you were up against today
 was as strong as the Heaven and Earth nets all those years age.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Let's not go into all that ancient history,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;That
 demon must be exhausted after his fight with me. I haven't been put to
 any trouble worth speaking of, so if you'll all sit here and relax I'll
 go back into the cave, find out where he keeps the ring, and steal it
 if I possibly can. Then I'll capture the monster, find your weapons,
 and return them to you to take back to Heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's late now,&#8221; said Prince Nezha. &#8220;You'd better have a good night's
 sleep and go tomorrow morning.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't understand life, my lad,&#8221; replied Monkey. &#8220;Who ever heard
 of a burglar liking to steal in broad daylight? This sort of groping
 about has to be done in secret under cover of darkness. That's the way
 the job's done.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop arguing, Your Highness,&#8221; said the Star Lord of Fire and the two
 thunder gods, &#8220;We don't know anything about that sort of thing, and the
 Great Sage is an old hand. Let him make the most of the nighttime, when
 the demon is exhausted and nobody is expecting anything to happen.
 Please go at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>With a chuckle the splendid Great Sage tucked his iron cudgel away,
 jumped down from the peak and went to the mouth of the cave, where he
 shook himself and turned into a cricket. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Hard mouth, black skin, and long antennae,</P>
<P>Bright eyes and legs that bend like branches.</P>
<P>In the clear wind and in moonlight he sings by the wall;</P>
<P>When the night is still he talks like a human.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As he weeps in the dew the scenery seems cold;</P>
<P>His marvellous voice now comes in fits and starts.</P>
<P>Just when the homesick traveler least wishes to hear him</P>
<P>He finds him lurking underneath the bed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>With a few bounds of his mighty legs Monkey was at the doors.
 Squeezing through the narrow gap between them he squatted at the foot
 of the wall, looking carefully at where the light was coming from. He
 saw all the big and little devils devouring their food like wolves or
 tigers. Monkey chirped for a while, and a little later the banquet was
 cleared away and the devils all went to bed. About two hours later,
 when Monkey had just reached the room at the back, he heard the demon
 king ordering, &#8220;Little ones on the doors, stay awake! Sun Wukong may
 change himself into something and sneak in here to steal.&#8221;</P>
<P>Those who were on watch duty that night were neatly turned out and
 sounding their clappers and bells. This made it even easier for the
 Great Sage, to go about his business. Creeping into the monster's
 bedroom he saw a stone bed on either side of which stood powdered and
 painted mountain and tree spirits. They were spreading out the bedding
 and waiting on the old demon, taking off his boots and clothes. When
 the old demon was undressed Monkey could see the ring gleaming white on
 his left arm. It looked like a bracelet made from a string of pearls.
 Instead of taking it off the demon pushed it up his arm a couple of
 times to jam it more firmly into place before going to sleep. Seeing
 this, Monkey changed himself again, this time into a brown-skinned flea
 that jumped up on the bed, burrowed into the bedding, climbed on the
 monster's arm, and bit him so hard that he sat up with a yell of,
 &#8220;Bloody slaves, you need some more flogging. You didn't shake out the
 quilt or dust the bed, and I've just been bitten.&#8221; He rubbed the ring
 twice more and went back to sleep. Monkey climbed on the ring and bit
 him again, so that the monster sat up again, unable to sleep. &#8220;I'm
 itching to death,&#8221; he complained.</P>
<P>Seeing that the security was so strict and that the demon kept the
 treasure on himself and was not going to take it off Monkey realized
 that he would be unable to steal it. So he jumped down from the bed,
 turned himself back into a cricket, left the bedroom, and went straight
 to the back, where he heard the groans and whimpers of the dragons and
 horses again, but now from behind tightly shut doors. Monkey turned
 back to his own form and went up to the doors to open the lock by
 magic. He said a spell and rubbed the lock, making its tongues both
 click open. He then pushed the doors open and rushed inside, where it
 was as bright as day in the light from all the fire instruments and
 creatures. He noticed some weapons leaning against the walls on either
 side: Prince Nezha's demon-hacking cutlass and other arms as well as
 the fire bows, arrows and the rest of the Star Lord of Fire's gear.
 Looking all around by the light of the fires he noticed to his delight
 a handful of hairs lying in a bamboo basket on a stone table behind the
 doors. Monkey picked them up, blew on them twice with warm breath,
 shouted &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned them into three or four dozen little
 monkeys. He told them to take the cutlass, sword, pestle, rope, ball,
 wheel, bow, arrows, spear, carts, gourd, fire crows, fire rats, fire
 horses and everything else that had been caught in the ring; then he
 mounted the fire dragon and started a blaze burning from the inside
 outwards. There was a great roaring and loud cracks that sounded like
 thunder and cannons. All the big and little demons were thrown into
 such panic and confusion that they wrapped themselves in their quilts,
 covered their heads, shouted and wept. As they had nowhere to flee most
 of them were burnt to death. When the Handsome Monkey King returned in
 victory it was about midnight.</P>
<P>When Heavenly King Li and the other gods spotted the dazzling fire
 from the mountaintop they rushed forward to see Brother Monkey riding
 the dragon and driving the little monkeys straight up to the peak.
 &#8220;Come and get your weapons,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;come and get your weapons.&#8221;
 The Star Lord of Fire and Nezha shouted greetings, whereupon Monkey
 shook himself and put all the hairs back on his body. Nezha recovered
 his six weapons, and the Star Lord told his subordinates to collect the
 fire dragon and the rest<I></I> of the fire creatures and implements.
 They were all laughing with pleasure as they congratulated Monkey.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The blaze in the Jindou Cave gave the Great Rhinoceros King such a
 fright that his souls left his body. He sat up at once, threw open the
 doors of his bedroom, and held the ring out in both hands to the East
 and the West to put out the fire. Then he ran all around holding out
 his treasure, which extinguished all the flames and smoke that filled
 the air, and tried to rescue his demons, most of whom were dead. He
 could only muster a hundred or so, male and female; and when he looked
 at where the weapons were kept he found them all gone. Going round to
 the back he saw Pig, Friar Sand and the Tang Priest still tied up
 there, the white horse still tethered to the trough and the luggage
 still in the room.</P>
<P>&#8220;I wonder which careless little devil started that fire,&#8221; he said
 angrily. &#8220;Look what it has done!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; said his attendants, &#8220;the fire was nothing to do with
 anyone in our household. It was probably a burglar who let all the fire
 creatures go and stole the magic weapons.&#8221;</P>
<P>Only then did the demon realize what had happened. &#8220;I'm certain it
 was Sun Wukong,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It can't have been anyone else. No wonder I
 couldn't get to sleep. The thieving monkey must have turned himself
 into something to get in here and bite my arm twice. He must have been
 trying to steal my treasure but failed because I was wearing it too
 tightly. So he stole the weapons and released the fire dragon. What a
 vicious idea: he was trying to burn me to death. Evil monkey! Your
 cleverness will get you nowhere: you don't know my powers yet. As long
 as I have this treasure I can go into the ocean without drowning and
 into fire without being burnt. If I catch that bandit I'll chop him up
 into little bits and burn him as a torch. That's the only way I'll feel
 better about it.&#8221;</P>
<P>After he had been talking to himself in his misery for a long time he
 did not notice the cocks crowing for the dawn. Up on the mountaintop
 Prince Nezha, who now had his six weapons back, said to Monkey, &#8220;Great
 Sage, it's light now and we must lose no time. We should fight the
 demon while his morale is still low. We'll support you with all the
 fire forces while you take him on, and this time I think you'll be able
 to capture him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;We'll all pull together. Let's have
 some fun.&#8221; Every one of them braced himself and displayed his martial
 prowess as they headed for the mouth of the cave. &#8220;Come out, damned
 demon,&#8221; shouted Monkey, &#8220;and fight with me.&#8221; The two stone doors had
 been reduced to ashes by the blaze, and the little devils inside were
 sweeping up and picking over the cinders. The approach of all the gods
 made them drop their brooms and their ash forks in panic as they rushed
 back inside to report, &#8220;Sun Wukong is here with a host of gods from
 Heaven demanding battle again.&#8221; The news caused the rhinoceros monster
 great alarm. He noisily ground his teeth of steel, his eyes bulged with
 fury, and he went out holding his spear and his treasure, pouring out
 insults: &#8220;I'll get you, you thieving arsonist of an ape. What sort of
 powers do you have that give you the right to treat me with such
 contempt?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Damned devil,&#8221; retorted Monkey with a smile on his face, &#8220;if you
 want to know my powers I'll tell you:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Since I was little my powers have been great;</P>
<P>My fame has spread in heaven and in earth.</P>
<P>As a bright young thing I learned to be immortal,</P>
<P>Acquiring the traditions of eternal youth.</P>
<P>I determined to visit the land of the heart</P>
<P>And reverently went to the country of the sages.</P>
<P>I learned the magic of infinite changes</P>
<P>And roamed at will through cosmic space.</P>
<P>My hobby was subduing the tigers on the hills;</P>
<P>When bored I forced the ocean dragons to submit.</P>
<P>I was monarch of the Mountain of Flowers and of Fruit,</P>
<P>And showed off my power in the Water Curtain Cave.</P>
<P>Often I decided to go up to Heaven</P>
<P>And in my folly I occupied the place above.</P>
<P>I was called the Great Sage Equaling Heaven</P>
<P>And given the title of Handsome Monkey King.</P>
<P>When they held a banquet of their magic peaches</P>
<P>I was most angry at not being invited.</P>
<P>Secretly I went to steal jade liquor,</P>
<P>Drinking this rare wine in their elegant pavilions.</P>
<P>Liver of dragons, the marrow of the phoenix,</P>
<P>And many other delicacies did I steal that day.</P>
<P>I ate my fill of those immortal peaches,</P>
<P>And packed my stomach with pills of eternal life.</P>
<P>I then purloined all kinds of Heavenly marvel</P>
<P>And tucked away the treasures of that palace.</P>
<P>Because the Jade Emperor had learned of my powers</P>
<P>Heavenly soldiers were sent into battle</P>
<P>The Nine Bright Shiners I sent on their way;</P>
<P>I wounded all five of the evil constellations.</P>
<P>The generals of Heaven were no match for me:</P>
<P>A hundred thousand soldiers all lost their nerve.</P>
<P>The Jade Emperor then was forced to summon</P>
<P>The Little Sage Erlang to join in the fight.</P>
<P>We both went through our seventy-two changes,</P>
<P>Each of us showing his spirit and strength.</P>
<P>The Bodhisattva Guanyin came to their aid</P>
<P>With her vase of pure water and her sprig of willow,</P>
<P>And Lao Zi used his Diamond Jade</P>
<P>To take me a prisoner back up to Heaven.</P>
<P>They led me in chains to the Jade Monarch's palace</P>
<P>Where legal officials determined my fate.</P>
<P>Strong soldiers were ordered to cut off my head,</P>
<P>But the hacks at my scalp only made sparks fly</P>
<P>When they tried all their tricks but nothing killed me.</P>
<P>I then was escorted to the palace of Lao Zi.</P>
<P>The Six Dings refined me with the fire of their furnace</P>
<P>And made my whole body as hard as steel.</P>
<P>After seven times seven days the furnace was opened,</P>
<P>And out I jumped, more terrible than ever.</P>
<P>The gods all shut their gates, unable to resist,</P>
<P>And the sages decided to ask the Buddha's help.</P>
<P>Great was the power of the Buddha's dharma,</P>
<P>Indeed his wisdom is infinitely mighty.</P>
<P>I wagered with a somersault to jump out of his hand,</P>
<P>But he crushed me with a mountain that rendered me powerless.</P>
<P>Then the Jade Emperor celebrated peace</P>
<P>And the West was proclaimed to be a land of bliss.</P>
<P>I was crushed by the mountain for five hundred years</P>
<P>Never tasting a mouthful of tea or of food.</P>
<P>When the Golden Cicada came down to earth</P>
<P>He was sent from the East to visit the Buddha.</P>
<P>He wants to bring the scriptures back to China,</P>
<P>So the Tang ruler could save his ancestors' souls.</P>
<P>Guanyin converted me to the side of goodness,</P>
<P>To hold to the teachings and keep myself in check.</P>
<P>Since I was released from the agonizing mountain</P>
<P>I have been heading West to fetch the true scriptures.</P>
<P>Do not try to use your evil cunning, devil:</P>
<P>Return to me my master to worship the Buddha.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When he had heard all this the demon pointed at Monkey and replied,
 &#8220;So you're the thief who robbed Heaven. Stay where you are and take
 this!&#8221; The Great Sage parried the spear whit his cudgel, and just as
 the two of them were starting to fight again Nezha and the Star Lord of
 Fire lost their tempers and flung all their magic weapons and
 fire-raising equipment at the demon king. Monkey was more ferocious
 than ever, while the thunder gods with their thunder splinters and the
 Heavenly King with his sword rushed into the fray together, not
 worrying about rank and seniority.</P>
<P>The demon king gave a mocking and majestic laugh, discreetly brought
 the ring out of his sleeve and threw it into the air with a shout of
 &#8220;Catch them!&#8221; It came whistling down, catching the six magic weapons,
 all the fire-raising equipment and creatures, the thunder gods'
 thunderbolt, the Heavenly King's sword and Monkey's cudgel. Once again
 the gods were all empty-handed and the Great Sage Sun disarmed. The
 triumphant demon turned round to say, &#8220;Little ones, fetch rocks to make
 new doors, and start digging and building to refurbish all the rooms
 inside. When that's done I'll slaughter the Tang Priest and his
 disciples as a thanksgiving to the local god, and you'll all have a
 share.&#8221; The little demons all set to as they had been instructed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Heavenly King Li led his troops back up the mountain the Star
 Lord of Fire was grumbling about Nezha's impatience and the thunder
 gods were angry with the Heavenly King for behaving badly. The only
 person keeping quiet was the Earl of the Yellow River. Seeing how they
 were all unwilling to look each other in the face and were worried,
 desperate, resentful and trying to make himself look cheerful, Brother
 Monkey said to them with a smile, &#8220;Don't be upset. Victory and defeat
 are all part of the soldier's routine. The demon's only so-so in
 fighting skill. The only thing that makes him so dangerous is that ring
 which has caught all our weapons again. Don't worry. I'll go and make
 some more inquiries about who and what he is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But last time you asked the Jade Emperor to have an inspection of
 the whole of Heaven you found no trace of him,&#8221; said Prince Nezha.
 &#8220;Where are you going to look for him now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As I recall,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;the Buddha's dharma is boundless. I'll
 go to the Western Heaven to ask the Tathagata Buddha to look at all
 four continents with his all-seeing eyes and find out where the demon
 was born, where his home is officially registered, and what his ring
 really is. Whatever happens we must capture him to avenge you gentlemen
 and allow you to return to Heaven happy.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said the gods, &#8220;don't stay here a moment longer. Go
 at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>Splendid Monkey said, &#8220;Go!&#8221; and with one bound of his somersault
 cloud he was soon at Vulture Peak. Bringing down his auspicious right
 he looked all around. It was a wonderful place:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Nobly tower the sacred peaks,</P>
<P>Pure is the beauty of the many crags,</P>
<P>Magical summits rise to touch the jade-blue sky,</P>
<P>This is what holds the Western Heaven in place,</P>
<P>Dominating China with its great might.</P>
<P>Its primal energy permeates earth and sky,</P>
<P>Covering all with splendor as its majesty spreads.</P>
<P>The sounds of bells and chimes reverberate for long</P>
<P>While voices can be heard reciting holy sutras.</P>
<P>Under blue pines the faithful preach</P>
<P>While arhats stroll among the cypresses.</P>
<P>White cranes come with purpose to the Vulture peak;</P>
<P>Phoenixes choose to perch on its empty pavilions.</P>
<P>Monkeys in twos pick immortal fruit;</P>
<P>Pairs of deer present milk vetch.</P>
<P>The songs of hidden birds seem to pour out their woes;</P>
<P>One cannot put names to the strange and brilliant flowers.</P>
<P>Ridge upon ridge enfold here many times over;</P>
<P>Smooth are the ancient paths that wind around.</P>
<P>This is a place of purity and magic,</P>
<P>The noble home of the enlightened Buddha.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As Monkey was admiring the mountain scenery someone called to him,
 &#8220;Where have you come from, Sun Wukong, and where are you going?&#8221; He
 turned round at once to see it was an honorable bhiksuni, or nun.</P>
<P>&#8220;There is a matter on which I would like to see the Tathagata,&#8221; said
 Monkey with a bow.</P>
<P>&#8220;You're so naughty,&#8221; said the bhiksuni. &#8220;If you're here to see the
 Tathagata why don't you go straight up to his monastery instead of
 admiring the scenery?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I only had the effrontery to look because this is my first visit,&#8221;
 Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Come with me at once,&#8221; said the bhiksuni, and Monkey went with her
 to the gates of the Thunder Monastery, where their way was blocked by
 the eight vajrapanis, the ferocious guardian gods. &#8220;Wait here for a
 while, Wukong, while I make a report on your behalf,&#8221; said the
 bhiksuni. Monkey stood outside the gates while the bhiksuni went into
 the Buddha's presence, put her hands together, and said, &#8220;Sun Wukong is
 here on a matter over which he wishes to see you, Tathagata.&#8221; The
 Buddha sent for Monkey, and the vajrapanis then allowed him in.</P>
<P>When Monkey had made his kowtows the Buddha asked, &#8220;Why are you here
 by yourself? I was told that you were converted to the faith after the
 honorable Guanyin released you, and that you were escorting the Tang
 Priest here to fetch the scriptures. What has happened?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I report to my Buddha,&#8221; said Monkey, his head touching the ground,
 &#8220;that your disciple has been escorting the Tang Priest Westwards ever
 since my conversion. At the Jindou Cave in Mount Jindou we're up
 against an evil demon called the Great Rhinoceros King who has
 tremendous magic powers. He is holding my master and fellow disciples
 as prisoners in his cave. I have asked the demon to return them, but
 his intentions are evil. When we fought he grabbed my iron cudgel with
 a gleaming white ring. I thought he might be some officer from Heaven
 with a yearning for earthly things so I went straight up there, but on
 inspection could not find any missing. The Jade Emperor kindly sent
 Heavenly King Li and his son Nezha to help me, but the demon took the
 prince's six weapons. Then I asked the Star Lord of Fire to burn him
 out, but he took all the fire-raising equipment and creatures. Next I
 asked the Star Lord of Water to drown him, but not a drop touched him.
 I went to a lot of effort to steal back the cudgel and all the rest of
 it, challenged him to another fight, and lost it all to him again. I
 have no way of subduing him. That is why I have come to ask my Buddha
 to show his disciple mercy and look to see where the monster is from.
 Then I'll be able to arrest his relations and neighbors, capture him
 and rescue the master. Then we'll all be able to seek the true
 achievement together reverently.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the Buddha heard this his all-seeing eyes looked far away, and
 all was revealed to him at once. &#8220;I know who that monster is,&#8221; he said,
 &#8220;but I must not tell you. You cannot keep your mouth shut, little
 monkey, and once you put it about that I told you he would stop
 fighting you and come to make a row here on Vulture Peak. I would only
 be asking for trouble for myself. Instead I will give you some dharma
 power to help you capture him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What dharma power will the Tathagata give me?&#8221; asked Monkey,
 kowtowing in thanks. The Tathagata Buddha then told his eighteen arhats
 to open their treasury and take eighteen grains of golden cinnabar sand
 with them.</P>
<P>&#8220;What does golden cinnabar sand do?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Go and have another contest with the demon outside the cave,&#8221; the
 Buddha replied. &#8220;Lure him out so that the arhats can drop their sand on
 him and fix him to the spot. He will not be able to move his body or
 lift a leg, and you will be able to beat him up as you see fit.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Splendid,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile, &#8220;splendid. Let's go straight
 away.&#8221; Not daring to delay, the arhats fetched the golden cinnabar sand
 and set out, while Brother Monkey thanked the Buddha once more. When
 they were on their way Monkey found on counting that there were only
 sixteen arhats.</P>
<P>&#8220;What sort of place is this if you let people bribe their way out of
 their duties?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean, bribing their way out of their duties?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Eighteen of you were sent,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;so why are there only
 sixteen of you now?&#8221;</P>
<P>Before the words were out of his mouth the arhats Dragon-subduer and
 Tiger-queller came up to him and asked, &#8220;Wukong, how can you be so
 wicked? We stayed behind to receive the Buddha's instructions.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've too tricky,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;too tricky. If I'd called out any
 later I dare say you wouldn't have come at all.&#8221; All the arhats were
 laughing as they mounted their auspicious clouds.</P>
<P>They were soon at Mount Jindou. When Heavenly King Li saw them he led
 his hosts out in greeting and started to tell them all that had
 happened. &#8220;Spare us the details,&#8221; the arhats said, &#8220;Call him out as
 soon as you can.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Great Sage made a spell with his hands, went to the mouth of the
 cave, and started shouting insults: &#8220;Come out, you bloated fiend, come
 out and see if you can beat your grandfather Monkey.&#8221;</P>
<P>The little devils flew in to report, and the demon king said in fury,
 &#8220;Who's the thieving ape asked along to help him in his wickedness?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There are no soldiers with him,&#8221; the little devils replied. &#8220;He's
 there by himself.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How could he possibly dare to come back here alone?&#8221; the demon king
 wondered. &#8220;I've got his cudgel. Does he want another boxing match?&#8221;
 Taking his ring and brandishing his spear the demon told the little
 devils to clear away the rocks blocking the entrance and leapt outside.
 &#8220;Damned ape,&#8221; he shouted insultingly, &#8220;make yourself scarce. You've
 been beaten often enough. What are you here shouting for again?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Damned demon,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you don't know what's good for you. The
 only way to stop me coming back is to surrender, apologize and give my
 master and my fellow disciples back. Do that and I'll spare you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've already had those three monks of yours cleaned up,&#8221; the monster
 replied, &#8220;and soon I'm going to slaughter them. Don't you realize that
 yet? Get lost!&#8221;</P>
<P>At the word &#8220;slaughter&#8221; Monkey stamped his feet, and his cheeks
 reddened as he could not hold back his anger for a moment longer.
 Dropping his guard he took a sidestep and swung his fist at the
 monster's face. The monster struck back with his spear, and not
 realizing that Monkey was deliberately springing from side to side he
 allowed himself to be lured South further and further from the cave.
 Monkey then called on the arhats to throw their golden cinnabar sand at
 the demon all together. It was a marvellous display of divine power.
 Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>At first it spread like mist or smoke</P>
<P>Drifting gently down from the sky.</P>
<P>A vast expanse of whiteness</P>
<P>In which nothing can be seen;</P>
<P>A blanket of obscurity</P>
<P>That hides one's way in an instant.</P>
<P>The woodcutter loses his mate when gathering firewood;</P>
<P>The young Taoist gathering herbs cannot see his home.</P>
<P>The fine grains blow in the wind like flour,</P>
<P>The coarse ones roll like sesame seeds.</P>
<P>The world is lost to sight, the mountain peaks are dark,</P>
<P>And sunshine from the sky is blotted out.</P>
<P>This is not the dust kicked up by horses</P>
<P>Nor like the softness of a fragrant carriage.</P>
<P>This cinnabar sand is a merciless thing</P>
<P>Covering heaven and earth and capturing all demons.</P>
<P>Only because the monster attacked the true Way</P>
<P>Were the arhats commanded to show off its splendor.</P>
<P>In their hands they were holding pearls of brilliance</P>
<P>To shine with dazzling brightness at the right time.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the demon was being blinded by the flying sand he bent down to
 see that it was already three feet deep on the ground. In his alarm he
 sprang up at once to the level above it, but before he had steadied
 himself it was already over two feet deeper. Now desperate, he pulled
 his feet free, took out his ring, and threw it up in the air with a
 shout of &#8220;Catch them!&#8221; As it came whistling down it caught all eighteen
 grains of golden cinnabar sand. The monster went back into his cave.</P>
<P>The empty-handed arhats stopped their clouds. &#8220;Why have you stopped
 dropping your sand, arhats?&#8221; asked Monkey as he came towards them.</P>
<P>&#8220;There was a noise just now and all our golden cinnabar sand
 disappeared,&#8221; they replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;That thing must have caught it too,&#8221; said Monkey with a laugh.</P>
<P>&#8220;If he's as invincible as this however are we going to capture him?&#8221;
 the Heavenly King and the rest of them said. &#8220;When will we ever go back
 to Heaven, and how will we be able to face the Jade Emperor?&#8221;</P>
<P>Then the two arhats Dragon-subduer and Tiger-queller said to Monkey,
 &#8220;Wukong, do you know why we two were late setting out?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I was cross because I thought you were skulking somewhere and not
 coming,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I didn't know you were having a conversation.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The Tathagata Buddha gave us these instructions,&#8221; the arhats
 replied. &#8220;He said, 'That fiend has very great magic powers. If you lose
 your golden cinnabar sand tell Sun Wukong to go to Lord Lao Zi's
 Tushita Palace in the Lihen Heaven to find out about the fiend's
 background. If he does that he may be able to capture the monster
 easily.'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a horrible thing to do,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;The Buddha's tricked me
 again. He should have told me before and spared you this long journey.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As those are the Buddha's clear instructions you should be on your
 way as soon as possible,&#8221; said Heavenly King Li.</P>
<P>Splendid Monkey. Saying, &#8220;I'm off!&#8221; he sent his somersault cloud
 straight in through the Southern Gate of Heaven, where the four
 marshals raised their hands in greeting and asked how the capture of
 the demon was going. &#8220;I haven't got him yet,&#8221; said Monkey without
 stopping, &#8220;but I now know where to find out about his background.&#8221; Not
 daring to delay him, the four marshals let him pass through. He did not
 go to the Hall of Miraculous Mist or the Palace of the Dipper and the
 Bull, but went straight to the gates of the Tushita Palace in the Lihen
 Heaven that lies beyond the thirty-three heavens, where he saw two
 immortal boys standing in attendance. Monkey did not report his name
 but rushed straight in, to the consternation of the boys who grabbed
 him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; they asked, &#8220;and where are you going?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am the Great Sage Equaling Heaven,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and I'm here
 to see Lord Lao Zi.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How could you be so ill-mannered?&#8221; the boys said. &#8220;Just wait there
 while we make a report.&#8221; Allowing no further discussion Monkey shouted
 at them and went straight in, colliding with Lord Lao Zi who was coming
 out to meet him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Haven't seen you for ages, old fellow,&#8221; said Monkey after bowing and
 uttering a respectful &#8220;re-e-er.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why are you here, you little monkey, instead of going to fetch
 scriptures?&#8221; asked Lord Lao Zi with a smile. To this Monkey replied,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;To fetch the holy scriptures</P>
<P>I toil day and night,</P>
<P>And now that I'm in trouble</P>
<P>To see you would be right.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;What have your troubles on the road to the Western Heaven to do with
 me?&#8221; Lord Lao Zi asked. Monkey's answer was:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Of the Buddha's West Heaven</P>
<P>Please don't talk today.</P>
<P>It's to follow a trail</P>
<P>That I've come up this way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;But this is a Supreme Immortals' palace,&#8221; Lord Lao Zi replied, &#8220;so
 how can you be following anyone's trail up here?&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey went into the palace and looked about him with great
 concentration. When he had gone along a number of covered walkways he
 noticed a boy sleeping by the buffalo pen, from which the water-buffalo
 was missing. &#8220;Old man,&#8221; shouted Monkey, &#8220;your buffalo's escaped, your
 buffalo's escaped.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When did that wicked beast get away?&#8221; asked Lord Lao Zi with horror.
 The noise woke up the boy, who knelt before Lord Lao Zi and said, &#8220;My
 lord, I was asleep. I don't know when it went.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When did you go to sleep, you little wretch?&#8221; asked Lord Lao Zi
 angrily.</P>
<P>&#8220;I picked up an elixir pill in the elixir laboratory and ate it,&#8221;
 replied the boy with kowtows, &#8220;then went to sleep here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I suppose you ate one of the seven-fired elixir tablets that must
 have been dropped when I refined them the other day, damn you,&#8221; said
 Lord Lao Zi. &#8220;One of those tablets would make you sleep for seven days.
 The evil beast took the chance to escape and go down to the mortal
 world when you went to sleep and left it unguarded. That must have been
 seven days ago.&#8221; He then ordered an inspection to find out if it had
 stolen any treasures.</P>
<P>&#8220;It doesn't have any treasures, only a terrible ring,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>When Lord Lao Zi made an urgent check he found that nothing was
 missing except a diamond jade bangle. &#8220;The evil beast must have stolen
 my Diamond Jade Bangle,&#8221; said Lord Lao Zi.</P>
<P>&#8220;So that's what his treasure is,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;that's what he fought
 me with. Goodness only knows how many of our weapons he's caught with
 that now he's rampaging around in the mortal would.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where is that wicked beast now?&#8221; Lord Lao Zi asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;In the Jindou Cave on Mount Jindou, where he's holding the Tang
 Priest and has captured my gold-banded cudgel. I asked for the help of
 heavenly soldiers, and he took Prince Nezha's magic weapons. When I
 invited the Star Lord of Fire to come his fire-raising equipment and
 creatures were taken. Although the Earl of the Yellow River couldn't
 drown him, at least his gear wasn't taken. Then when I asked the Buddha
 to send his arhats to scatter their golden cinnabar sand the demon took
 all that too. It looks as though you are guilty of a very serious crime
 in allowing a thieving and murderous monster to get away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That Diamond Jade Bangle is a treasure I refined and created after I
 went out through the Han Pass to convert the foreigners. Nothing can
 get anywhere near it, not weapons, fire or water. But if my Plantain
 Fan had been stolen not even I would have been able to do anything
 about it&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey was feeling very pleased as he accompanied Lord Lao Zi, who
 was carrying his Plantain Fan, out of the palace by auspicious cloud.
 Once they were through the Southern Gate of Heaven they brought the
 cloud straight down to Mount Jindou, where Lord Lao Zi greeted the
 eighteen arhats, the thunder gods, the Earl of the Yellow River, the
 Star Lord of Fire, Heavenly King Li and Prince Nezha, who told him all
 about what had happened. &#8220;For me to catch him Sun Wukong will have to
 go down to lure him out once more,&#8221; Lord Lao Zi said.</P>
<P>Monkey jumped down from the peak and started yelling abuse once more.
 &#8220;Bloated, evil beast, come out and be killed.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the little devils reported once again the demon king said, &#8220;I
 wonder who the evil monkey has fetched this time.&#8221; He went out with his
 spear and his treasure to have Monkey cursing him once again.</P>
<P>&#8220;Vicious demon, you're definitely going to die this time. Stay there,
 and take this!&#8221; Monkey leapt straight at him, punched the demon on the
 ear with a swing of his fist, turned and fled. The demon was going
 after him, wielding his spear, when a shout came from the top of the
 mountain: &#8220;Go home, buffalo. What are you waiting for?&#8221;</P>
<P>When the demon looked up and saw Lord Lao Zi he trembled with fear.
 &#8220;That thieving ape really is a devil. How did he ever persuade my
 master to come?&#8221;</P>
<P>When Lord Lao Zi recited a spell and fanned his fan once, the monster
 surrendered the ring which the lord caught in his hand. When he fanned
 it again all the strength went out of the monster, who reverted to his
 true form as a water-buffalo. Lord Lao Zi then blew on the Diamond
 Bangle with magic breath, put it thorough the buffalo's nose, undid the
 sash at his own waist, threaded it through the ring and held it.</P>
<P>To this day water-buffaloes still have devices called pegs put
 through their noses through which a rope can be run: this does the same
 job.</P>
<P>Lord Lao Zi then took his leave of the gods, mounted the buffalo, and
 rode on his multicolored cloud up to the Tushita Heaven, taking the
 demon with him on its lead.</P>
<P>Only then could the Great Sage Sun, Heavenly King Li and all of the
 host charge into the cave, killing all the hundred and more big and
 little devils and recovering their weapons and equipment. Monkey
 thanked Heavenly King Li and Nezha, who went back to Heaven; the
 thunder gods, who returned to their residence; the Star Lord of Fire,
 who went to his palace; the Earl of the Yellow River who went to his
 river; and the arhats, who returned to the Western Heaven. Finally he
 released the Tang Priest, Pig and Friar Sand and took back his iron
 cudgel. When the three of them had thanked Monkey the horse and the
 luggage were got ready and master and disciples left the cave to find
 the main route to the West.</P>
<P>As they were walking along they heard a call of &#8220;Holy Tang Priest,
 have a vegetarian meal,&#8221; which startled the master. If you do not know
 who was calling, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

</I>
<P>The Dhyana Master Conceives after Eating a Meal</P>
<P>The Yellow-Wife Brings Waster to Remove a Devil Foetus</P>
</B>
<P>Eight hundred kinds of virtue must be cultivated,</P>
<P>Three thousand good deeds must be secretly performed.</P>
<P>Do not distinguish objects from self, or friend from foe:</P>
<P>That conforms with the teaching of the Western Heaven.</P>
<P>The rhinoceros demon feared no weapons;</P>
<P>No blame attached to the failure of water and fire.</P>
<P>Lord Lao Zi subdued him and took him to Heaven,</P>
<P>Turning the buffalo round with a smile.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story goes on to tell who was calling by the wayside. The
 mountain god and local deity of Mount Jindou came out carrying a bowl
 of purple gold. &#8220;Holy monk,&#8221; they said, &#8220;this bowl of rice was begged
 by the Great Sage Monkey from a pious household. You fell into the
 clutches of an evil demon because you would not heed good advice,
 putting the Great Sage to endless trouble before he was finally able to
 free you today. Please eat this food before continuing on your way, and
 do not be ungrateful for the Great Sage's respect and sense of duty.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am very grateful to you, disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;and I cannot
 find words to express all my thanks. If I had realized before that I
 should not step out of the circle I would never have been in such
 danger of being killed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I tell you frankly, Master,&#8221; said Brother Monkey, &#8220;that because you
 did not trust the ring I drew you ended up the victim of someone else's
 ring. It caused so much trouble and suffering. Oh dear, oh dear, oh
 dear!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean about another ring?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;It was all your fault, you evil-tongued cretin, for getting the
 master into that terrible danger,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I had to turn heaven
 and earth upside down to fetch heavenly soldiers, water, fire, and even
 the Buddha's cinnabar sand, all of which was caught by his gleaming
 white ring. It was only because the Buddha gave a hint to the arhats
 who told me where the demon had come from that I could fetch Lord Lao
 Zi to subdue him. He was a water-buffalo turned demon.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Good disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang with infinite gratitude when he heard
 this, &#8220;after this experience I shall definitely take your advice in
 future.&#8221; The four of them then ate the steaming food. &#8220;Why is this rice
 still hot after such a long time?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;I heated it up myself
 when I knew that the Great Sage had succeeded,&#8221; replied the local deity
 on his knees. The food was soon eaten, after which they put the bowl
 away and took their leave of the local deity and the mountain god. The
 master remounted and they crossed the high mountain. Their minds freed
 from worries, they returned to true perception; dining on the wind and
 sleeping in the dew they continued to the West. When they had been
 travelling for a long time it was once again early spring. They heard</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The soft call of swallows,</P>
<P>The beauty of orioles.</P>
<P>The soft call of swallows tiring their fragrant voices;</P>
<P>The beauty of orioles and their frequent song.</P>
<P>The land is covered with flowers like brocade,</P>
<P>The emerald-green hills seem piled with cushions.</P>
<P>Fruit forms on the greengage trees on the ridge,</P>
<P>While an ancient cypress holds a cloud before the scar.</P>
<P>Pale is the misty light on the fertile plain;</P>
<P>Warm sands are bathed in the glow of sunset.</P>
<P>Orchards and trees now break into blossom;</P>
<P>Willows grow new shoots as the spring returns.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As they were walking along they came to a little river in which the
 water flowed cool, pure and deep. When he reined in his horse for a
 better look the Tang Priest could make out some of the roof of a
 thatched cottage under the green shade of willows. &#8220;That must be a
 ferryman's house,&#8221; said Monkey, pointing at the cottage. &#8220;It looks
 likely enough,&#8221; replied Sanzang, &#8220;but I would not like to be too sure
 as I cannot see any boat.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Ferryman!&#8221; yelled Pig at the top of his voice, putting the luggage
 down. &#8220;Bring the boat over.&#8221; After a number of these shouts a rowing
 boat came creaking out from under the willows and was soon near their
 bank. When they looked carefully this is what they saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Short oars dividing the waves,</P>
<P>Lightly skimming on the water.</P>
<P>The hull is painted in many colours,</P>
<P>Enclosing a full hold.</P>
<P>Iron chains are neatly coiled in the bows,</P>
<P>And bright is the tiller in the stern.</P>
<P>Although the skiff is only as light as a reed</P>
<P>It is the equal of an ocean-going vessel.</P>
<P>It may have no ivory mast or silken rigging,</P>
<P>But it does have cassia oars and a sternpost of pine.</P>
<P>Indeed this is no ship for mighty voyages,</P>
<P>Just a ferry fit to cross a single stream,</P>
<P>Coming and going between the river's banks,</P>
<P>Never leaving the ancient crossing place.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The boat was soon at the bank, &#8220;This way to cross the river,&#8221; called
 the boatman. Urging the horse forward for a closer look, Sanzang saw
 that the boatman looked like this:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A head wrapped in a toweling cloth,</P>
<P>Feet in black shoes of silk.</P>
<P>Many a patch on cotton-padded tunic and trousers,</P>
<P>And around the waist was a much-stitched cotton apron.</P>
<P>Horny skin on the hands, and muscles hard,</P>
<P>Eyes dim, a wrinkled brow, and an aged face.</P>
<P>But the voice was a melodious as an oriole's song;</P>
<P>At a closer look she was clearly an old woman.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do you do the ferrying?&#8221; asked Monkey, approaching the boat.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the woman replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why isn't the ferryman here?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;Why has he left it to
 his wife to pole the boat?&#8221;</P>
<P>The woman smiled and said nothing as she put the gangplank into
 position. Friar Sand carried the luggage aboard while Monkey helped the
 master on then followed himself. Pig led the horse on, after which the
 plank was stowed. The woman pushed off and quickly rowed them across
 the river.</P>
<P>When they were on the Western bank Sanzang told Friar Sang to open
 one of the bundles and take out some coins to give her. The ferry woman
 did not argue about the amount, but moored the boat by its painter to a
 stake beside the water and went back into her cottage chuckling.</P>
<P>As he was thirsty and the water was so clear Sanzang said to Pig,
 &#8220;Get the bowl and fetch me some water to drink.&#8221; Pig did as he was told
 and handed the water to his master, who drank only about a third of it,
 leaving two-thirds for the idiot to snatch and down in a single draft
 before helping the master back on his horse.</P>
<P>Master and disciples had been going less than an hour on the road
 West when Sanzang started to groan, &#8220;My stomach's hurting.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've got the bellyache too,&#8221; said Pig, who was behind him.</P>
<P>&#8220;It must be because you drank cold water,&#8221; said Friar Sand, only to
 be interrupted by groans of &#8220;It's agony!&#8221; from his master and Pig. The
 two of them were in unbearable pain and their abdomens were gradually
 swelling. When they felt with their hands there was something like a
 lump of flesh and blood moving and jerking around incessantly. Sanzang
 was feeling very unsteady when he noticed two bundles of straw hanging
 from the top of a tree in a village by the road.</P>
<P>&#8220;That's good, Master,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;There's a wineshop there. I'll
 go and beg you some hot water and find out if anyone sells medicine
 there and will let you have some medicine to ease your pain.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang was very pleased with the suggestion, so he whipped the white
 horse forward and was soon at the gates of the village, where he
 dismounted. An old woman was sitting on a bundle of straw outside the
 gates twisting hempen thread. Monkey went up to her, put his hands
 together in front of his chest in greeting, and said, &#8220;We monks have
 come from the Great Tang in the East. My master is the Tang Emperor's
 younger brother, and he has a stomachache because he drank some water
 from a river.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Which river did you drink from?&#8221; asked the old woman, laughing
 aloud.</P>
<P>&#8220;From the clear river to the East of here,&#8221; replied Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;What a laugh,&#8221; chuckled the old woman, &#8220;what a laugh! Come inside
 and I'll explain.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey supported Sanzang while Friar Sand helped pig into the
 thatched cottage where they sat down. The two of them were groaning in
 agony from their protruding bellies, their faces sallow and their
 foreheads creased with frowns. &#8220;Please boil some water for my master,
 missus,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;He must have it, and I'll be very grateful.&#8221;</P>
<P>Instead of doing this she went into the back of the house, still
 chuckling, and called, &#8220;Come and see, come and see!&#8221; There was a slap
 of sandals inside as two or three middle-aged women came out to stare
 at Sanzang with grins across their faces. This made Monkey so angry
 that he shouted and bared his teeth at them, sending them all scurrying
 and stumbling inside in terror.</P>
<P>Monkey went after them, grabbed the old woman, and said, &#8220;Boil some
 water this minute and I'll spare your life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; said the old woman, &#8220;hot water won't be any use. I can't
 do anything to help those two with their bellyaches. If you let me go
 I'll tell you all about it.&#8221; When Monkey released her she continued,
 &#8220;This is the Womanland of Western Liang. All of us in this country are
 female, and there isn't a man among us, which is why we were so pleased
 to see you. It's terrible that the reverend father has drank from that
 river, which is called the Motherhood River. There is a Male-welcoming
 Post Station outside our capital with a Pregnancy-revealing Spring. In
 this country we only dare drink of the river's water when we reach the
 age of twenty. After drinking it we feel the stomach pains of
 pregnancy. Three days later we go to the Pregnancy-revealing Spring at
 the Male-welcoming Post Station. If we see a double reflection in the
 waters we give birth to a child. Because your master has drunk from the
 Motherhood River he's pregnant. He's going to have a baby soon. What
 will a hot drink do to help that?&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang went pale with shock at the news.</P>
<P>&#8220;What am I to do, disciple?&#8221; he asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm going to have a child, but I'm a man,&#8221; said Pig, writhing around
 in his agony. &#8220;Where will the child come out? How am I to give birth to
 it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As the old saying goes, a melon falls when it's ripe,&#8221; replied
 Monkey with a laugh. &#8220;When the time comes a hole will open under your
 ribs for it to be born through.&#8221;</P>
<P>This conversation made Pig shake with fear, and the pain was more
 than he could bear. &#8220;I can't take any more,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I can't take any
 more. I'm dying, I'm dying.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop fidgeting, brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand with a grin, &#8220;stop
 fidgeting or else you'll get the umbilical cord in a twist and be ill
 before the birth.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot's panic was now worse than ever as with tears in his eyes
 he held on to Monkey and said, &#8220;Brother, ask the old lady where there
 are midwives with a gentle touch and send for some. The pains are
 coming very close to each other now. They must be labor pains. It'll be
 very soon now.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If they're labor pains, brother, you'd better stop writhing about if
 you don't want your waters to break,&#8221; said Friar Sand, still grinning.</P>
<P>&#8220;My good lady,&#8221; groaned Sanzang, &#8220;are there any doctors round here?
 Send one of my disciples to buy some medicine that will make me abort.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Medicine won't be any use,&#8221; said the old woman. &#8220;There's a
 Miscarriage Spring in Childfree Cave in Mount Offspring Dissolved on
 the road due South from here. To end your pregnancy you must drink the
 water of that spring. But the spring water cannot be had now as a
 Taoist called the As-you-will Immortal came here the other year and
 changed the Childfree Cave to the Hermitage of Immortals. He's hoarding
 the waters of Miscarriage Spring, which he won't give away. Anyone who
 wants water must take him rich gifts. You have to offer mutton, wine
 and fruit, and be very reverent indeed before you can get a bowl of the
 water from him. You travelling monks couldn't possibly afford to do all
 that, so you'll just have to let fate take its course and have the
 babies when your time comes.&#8221; Monkey, who was very pleased to learn all
 this, then asked how far it was to Mount Offspring Dissolved. &#8220;Ten
 miles,&#8221; the old woman replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Fine,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;You can stop worrying, Master. I'll go and get
 you some of the water.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Look after the master properly,&#8221; said the splendid Great Sage in his
 parting instructions to Friar Sand, &#8220;and if the people here try to
 bully him use your old trick of pulling a face to scare them till I get
 back with the water.&#8221;</P>
<P>Friar Sand was preparing to do as he was told when the old woman came
 out with a big earthenware bowl that she gave to Monkey. &#8220;Take this and
 fetch as much as you can,&#8221; she said, &#8220;so that we can keep some for
 emergencies.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey left the thatched cottage with the bowl in his hands and was
 off on his cloud, at which the old woman bowed to the sky and said,
 &#8220;That monk can ride on clouds, my lord.&#8221; Then she went inside and
 called the other women out to kowtow to the Tang Priest. They started
 calling him &#8220;arhat&#8221; and &#8220;Bodhisattva,&#8221; boiled water and prepared a meal
 to offer him.</P>
<P>Monkey's somersault cloud soon brought him within sight of a mountain
 that blocked his cloud, so he brought it down to gaze at the superb
 mountain. He saw</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A brocade of subtle blossoms,</P>
<P>Wild flowers spreading a green carpet,</P>
<P>Streams running into each other,</P>
<P>Brooks and clouds both at their ease.</P>
<P>Dense grow the creepers in many a valley,</P>
<P>And trees are packed close on a distant ridge.</P>
<P>While songbirds call wild geese fly over,</P>
<P>Deer drink, and gibbons climb.</P>
<P>The green line of peaks stands like a screen;</P>
<P>The blue rock face is shaped like a topknot.</P>
<P>It is hard to reach it across the drifting sands;</P>
<P>None could tire of watching the waterfall.</P>
<P>Taoist boys roam in search of herbs;</P>
<P>Foresters return with loads of firewood.</P>
<P>It is a worthy rival to Mount Tiantai,</P>
<P>And better than the threefold Huashan summit.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As the Great Sage was looking at the mountain he saw a farmhouse on
 its Northern slope from where the barking of dogs could be heard. The
 Great Sage went straight down the mountainside to the farm, which was
 indeed a splendid place:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A bridge across a lively stream,</P>
<P>A cottage sheltered by the hill,</P>
<P>Dogs barking by the broken fence,</P>
<P>A recluse who comes and goes at will.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey was soon at the gate, where he saw an old Taoist sitting on a
 green cushion. Putting down the earthenware bowl, Monkey went forward
 to greet him. The Taoist returned his greeting with a bow from where he
 sat and asked, &#8220;Where have you come from? What business brings you here
 to this hermitage?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have been sent by the emperor of the Great Tang in the East to
 fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven,&#8221; Brother Monkey replied.
 &#8220;My master's belly is unbearably painful and swollen because he drank
 some of the water of the Motherhood River. When we asked the local
 people they said it was because he is pregnant, and that there is no
 cure for this apart from the Miscarriage Spring in Childfree Cave in
 Mount Offspring Dissolved. So I have come especially to pay my respects
 to the As-you-will Immortal and beg him for some of the spring water
 with which to save my master. Could you be so kind as to show me the
 way?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This was Childfree Cave,&#8221; said the Taoist with a smile, &#8220;but now
 it's called the Hermitage of Immortals. I am none other than the senior
 disciple of my master the As-you-will Immortal. Tell me your name and I
 will announce you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am the senior disciple of the Patriarch Tang Sanzang,&#8221; said Monkey
 politely, &#8220;and my name is Sun Wukong.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are your presents, your wine and your offerings?&#8221; the Taoist
 asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm only a passing itinerant monk,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;so I haven't been
 able to arrange them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Fool!&#8221; said the Taoist with a laugh. &#8220;My master controls the spring
 and never gives any thing away for nothing. You'd better go and fetch
 your offerings if you want me to announce you, or else go away and
 forget about it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;People will do more as a favour than on the emperor's command,&#8221;
 Monkey replied. &#8220;Go and tell him my name and he's bound to do me this
 favour. He might even give me the whole spring.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Taoist went in to report all this to the immortal, who was
 playing his<I> qin</I> zither, and waited till he had finished before
 saying, &#8220;Master, there's a Buddhist monk outside who says he's Sun
 Wukong, the senior disciple of Tang Sanzang. He is asking for some of
 the water of the Miscarriage Spring to save his master with.&#8221; Had the
 immortal not been told this the matter would have ended there, but at
 the name of Sun Wukong anger surged up from his heart and evil grew
 from his gall. He sprang to his feet, stepped down from the low table
 on which he was playing the<I> qin,</I> changed from his informal
 clothes into his Taoist robes, and rushed out through the gates of his
 hermitage with his As-You-Will hook in his hands. &#8220;Where is Sun
 Wukong?&#8221; he shouted, and Monkey turned to see that he looked like this:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On his head was a star-crown of many colours,</P>
<P>And his magic robe was red with threads of gold.</P>
<P>The cloud-shoes on his feet were thickly embroidered;</P>
<P>The jade belt at his waist was delicately worked.</P>
<P>His wave-treading hosiery was of brocade,</P>
<P>And glimpses showed of a silk velvet underskirt.</P>
<P>He held a golden As-You-Will hook,</P>
<P>Long-handled with a base shaped like a dragon.</P>
<P>Bright were his phoenix eyes, and lotus-like his brows;</P>
<P>Steel-sharp were his teeth, and his lips bright crimson.</P>
<P>He looked more evil still than Marshal Wen</P>
<P>Although he wore a different kind of dress.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Monkey saw him he put his hands together and said, &#8220;My name,
 sir, is Sun Wukong.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Are you really Sun Wukong,&#8221; said the Taoist master with a smile, &#8220;or
 are you just pretending to be?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a thing to ask, sir! As the saying goes, a gentleman never
 changes his name whether he's travelling or staying at home.<I> I</I>
 am indeed Sun Wukong. Why should<I> I</I> want to pretend?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do you know who<I> I</I> am?&#8221; the Taoist master asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I've been converted to the Buddhist faith and follow Buddhist
 teachings,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;I've grown distant from the friends of my
 child hood on this long journey and I haven't visited any. I'm afraid I
 don't quite recognize you. I only know your name because the people in
 the village West of Motherhood River told me that you are the
 As-you-will Immortal.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're busy on your journey, and I am busy cultivating my true
 arts,&#8221; the Taoist replied, &#8220;so why have you come to see me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Because my master is pregnant and has a belly ache after mistakenly
 drinking water from the Motherhood River,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I've come to
 your immortal abode to beg you for a bowl of water from the Miscarriage
 Spring with which to deliver him from his agony.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Is your master Tang Sanzang?&#8221; asked the Taoist with an angry glare.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said Brother Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Did you ever meet the Boy Sage King?&#8221; asked the Taoist, gnashing his
 teeth with hatred.</P>
<P>&#8220;That was the title of the demon Red Boy in the Fire-cloud Cave by
 Withered Pine Ravine on Mount Hao,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Why are you asking
 about him, immortal?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He is my nephew,&#8221; the immortal replied. &#8220;I am the brother of the
 Bull Demon King. He wrote me a letter telling me how Sun Wukong, the
 vicious senior disciple of Tang Sanzang, destroyed the boy. It was my
 great regret that I had no way of taking revenge on you here, but now
 you've come to my door begging for water.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You are mistaken, sir,&#8221; said Monkey, putting on a smile. &#8220;Your
 respected elder brother used to be a friend of mine, and we were two of
 seven sworn brothers in my youth. The only reason I did not come to pay
 my respects earlier was because I did not know your address. Your good
 nephew has done very well. He's now serving the Bodhisattva Guanyin as
 the page Sudhana. He's much better off than the rest of us, so why be
 so angry with me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Damned ape!&#8221; shouted the Taoist master. &#8220;How dare you argue like
 that? Is my nephew better off as a slave than he was when he enjoyed
 the delights of being a king? Learn to behave yourself, and try a taste
 of my hook.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey parried with his iron cudgel and said, &#8220;Don't talk about
 fighting. Give me some of the spring water instead.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Vicious ape,&#8221; the Taoist master said again, &#8220;you don't know whether
 you want to live or die. If you can hold out against me for three
 rounds I'll give you your water, but if you can't I shall avenge my
 nephew by cutting you up and stewing you in soy sauce.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll get you, you impudent and evil creature,&#8221; replied the Great
 Sage. &#8220;If you want a fight try my cudgel.&#8221; The Taoist master blocked it
 with his hook, and the two of them fought a fine battle by the
 Hermitage of Immortals.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The holy monk conceived after drinking from a river,</P>
<P>So Monkey went to call on the As-you-will Immortal,</P>
<P>Not knowing that the Taoist was in fact a monster,</P>
<P>Who had used his powers to seize the Miscarriage Spring.</P>
<P>When he met Monkey old hatreds were revived:</P>
<P>They were locked in struggle and neither would yield.</P>
<P>As they talked on he became ever angrier,</P>
<P>Evilly determined to have his revenge.</P>
<P>One came for water to save his master's life,</P>
<P>Which the other would not give for his nephew's sake.</P>
<P>More lethal than a scorpion was the as-out-will hook,</P>
<P>While the gold-banded cudgel struck like a dragon,</P>
<P>The cudgel kept thrusting savagely at the chest,</P>
<P>While the hook made subtle cuts to the legs.</P>
<P>Grievous were the wounds where the cudgel fell,</P>
<P>And the hook rose from the shoulders to strike at the head.</P>
<P>The cudgel swung round the waist</P>
<P>Like a hawk after a sparrow;</P>
<P>The hook struck thrice at the head</P>
<P>Like a mantis catching a cicada.</P>
<P>They came and went as they struggled for mastery,</P>
<P>The ebb and flow of battle taking them forward and back.</P>
<P>There was nothing to choose between cudgel and hook;</P>
<P>Neither contender emerged as the victor.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After the Taoist master had fought over ten rounds with the Great
 Sage but was no match for him Monkey struck at the head with more
 ferocity than ever, his cudgel's blows falling like a stream of
 shooting stars. Completely exhausted, the Taoist master fled down the
 mountainside trailing his As-You-Will hook behind him.</P>
<P>Instead of pursuing him Monkey went to the hermitage in search of
 water, only to find that the other Taoist had already fastened the
 gates. Holding the earthenware bowl in his hands he went straight up to
 the gates, kicked through them with all his strength, and rushed in.
 The Taoist disciple was crouching behind the well's railings. The Great
 Sage shouted at him, raised his cudgel, and was about to kill him when
 the Taoist fled into the back. Monkey had just fetched a bucket and was
 on the point of filling it with spring water from the well when the
 master came up behind him, caught his feet with the hook, and sent him
 sprawling on the ground. The Great Sage pulled himself to his feet and
 started hitting back with his cudgel. The Taoist master swerved aside
 and said, wielding the hook, &#8220;We'll see if you can steal the water from
 my well.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Come here,&#8221; shouted Monkey, &#8220;come here. I'll get you, you evil
 creature, and I'll beat you to death.&#8221; The Taoist master did not go for
 Monkey but just stood guard over the well, preventing him from drawing
 any water, Seeing that he was not moving, Monkey whirled his cudgel
 round and round with his left hand and in his right took the bucket,
 which he sent noisily down the well on the rope. The Taoist master came
 back to the attack with his hook. Monkey, unable to hold him off
 one-handed, was tripped round his legs again and sent sprawling,
 dropping the bucket and rope down the well.</P>
<P>&#8220;What a way to behave,&#8221; remarked the Great Sage, getting back on his
 feet and taking his cudgel in both hands to lash wildly back. Once
 again the Taoist master fled, unable to face him. The Great Sage still
 wanted to draw some water but now he had no bucket and was also worried
 that he might be tripped by the hook again. &#8220;I'd better get someone to
 help me,&#8221; he thought.</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage turned his cloud round, went straight back to
 the cottage door, and shouted, &#8220;Friar Sand.&#8221; When Sanzang and Pig, who
 were groaning and moaning in agony, heard his shout they said with
 relief, &#8220;Friar Sand, Wukong's back.&#8221;</P>
<P>Friar Sand opened the door as quickly as he could, asking, &#8220;Have you
 got the water, brother?&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey came in and told them what had happened Sanzang said with
 tears in his eyes, &#8220;What are we to do, disciple?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've come to take Brother Sand back to the hermitage with me,&#8221;
 Monkey replied. &#8220;He'll fetch the water to save you while I fight that
 damned Taoist.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If both you healthy ones go and abandon us invalids who will look
 after us?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry, venerable arhat,&#8221; said the old woman who was standing
 beside them. &#8220;You won't need your disciples. We can look after you. We
 were very kind to you when you first came, and now that we have seen
 how that Bodhisattva can travel by cloud we know that you are arhats
 and Bodhisattvas. We could never possibly harm you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You women,&#8221; snorted Monkey, &#8220;you wouldn't dare hurt anyone.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't know your luck, my lord,&#8221; the old woman replied with a
 smile. &#8220;If you'd gone to any other house you'd never have come out in
 one piece.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; Pig groaned.</P>
<P>&#8220;All of us in this family are getting on,&#8221; the old woman replied,
 &#8220;and desire doesn't bother us any more, which is why we didn't harm
 you. If you'd gone to another household with women of different ages
 the younger ones would never have let you go. They'd have forced you to
 sleep with them, and if you'd refused they'd have murdered you and cut
 all the flesh off your bodies to put in perfume bags.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case I'd have been safe,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;The others smell
 lovely, just right for a perfume bag, but I'm a stinking boar and any
 flesh cut off me would stink too. I'd come to no harm.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop boasting,&#8221; said Brother Monkey with a smile, &#8220;and save your
 strength for the delivery.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Fetch the water as soon as you can. Don't waste any time,&#8221; the old
 woman said.</P>
<P>&#8220;Do you have a well-bucket on a rope I could borrow?&#8221; Monkey asked.
 The old woman went out to the back and brought in a bucket on a rope as
 well as a spare coil of rope that she handed to Friar Sand. &#8220;Take both
 ropes in case the well is so deep you need them,&#8221; she said.</P>
<P>Friar Sand took the bucket and the ropes, left the cottage with
 Monkey, and flew off on the same cloud. It took them less than an hour
 to reach Mount Offspring Dissolved, where they landed directly outside
 the gates of the hermitage. &#8220;Take the bucket and the ropes,&#8221; Monkey
 told Friar Sand, &#8220;and hide over there. Let me challenge him to battle.
 When the fight's going good and strong sneak in, fetch the water, and
 take it back.&#8221; Friar Sand accepted his orders.</P>
<P>Brandishing his iron cudgel the Great Sage Sun went up to the gates
 and shouted, &#8220;Open up! Open up!&#8221;</P>
<P>When the gate-keeper saw him he hurried inside to report, &#8220;Master,
 Sun Wukong's here again. The Taoist master was furiously angry.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That evil ape is utterly impossible. I've long heard of his powers
 and now I know what they really are. That cudgel of his is unbeatable.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said the other Taoist, &#8220;his powers may be great, but you're
 as good as he is. You are a match for him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He beat me the last two times,&#8221; said the master.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the other, &#8220;but that was just because he went for you
 with such fury. You tripped him up with your hook twice when he was
 trying to draw water, so that leveled the score, didn't it? He had to
 run away. If he's back now it must be because he's had to. I expect
 Sanzang's been complaining too much as his pregnancy's so far advanced.
 I'm sure that he's feeling resentful of his master. You're absolutely
 bound to win this time, master.&#8221;</P>
<P>This pleased the Taoist immortal and made him feel very cheerful as
 he went out through the doors. His face was wreathed in smiles, his
 manner imposing, and his hook in his hands. &#8220;Wicked ape, what are you
 back here for?&#8221; he shouted.</P>
<P>&#8220;Just to fetch some water,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's my well,&#8221; said the immortal, &#8220;and even if you were a king or a
 minister you'd still have to made me presents and offer mutton and wine
 before I gave you any. On top of that you're my enemy. How dare you
 come here empty-handed expecting water?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do you refuse to give me any?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the immortal, &#8220;I won't.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Vicious and evil beast,&#8221; Monkey yelled, &#8220;if you won't give me the
 water, take this!&#8221; He dropped his guard to strike hard with his cudgel
 at the immortal's head. The immortal dodged the blow and struck back
 with his hook. It was an even finer combat than the previous one.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The gold-banded cudgel,</P>
<P>The As-You-Will hook,</P>
<P>And two fighters filled with hatred and anger.</P>
<P>The flying sand and stones darkened earth and sky;</P>
<P>The clouds of dust and dirt made sun and moon seem sad.</P>
<P>The Great Sage was fetching water to save his master;</P>
<P>That the evil immortal refused for his nephew's sake.</P>
<P>Both sides fought with equal vigor</P>
<P>In their battle that allowed no rest.</P>
<P>They struggled for victory with tight-clenched jaws,</P>
<P>Gritting their teeth as they strove to win.</P>
<P>With growing skill</P>
<P>And ever-greater vigor</P>
<P>They breathed out clouds to frighten gods and ghosts.</P>
<P>Noisily rang the clash of their weapons</P>
<P>As their battle cries shook the mountains and hills.</P>
<P>They were a whirlwind wrecking a forest,</P>
<P>A pair of murderous fighting bulls.</P>
<P>As the battle went on the Great Sage felt happier</P>
<P>And the Taoist immortal had ever more energy.</P>
<P>Each was determined to carry on the fight;</P>
<P>Neither would give up till the issue was resolved.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The two of them leapt around in their fight from the gates of the
 hermitage to the mountain slope. It was a long and bitter struggle.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Friar Sand rushed in through the gates with the bucket in his
 hand the Taoist disciple blocked his way and asked, &#8220;Who do you think
 you are, coming to steal our water?&#8221; Friar Sand put down his bucket and
 ropes, brought out his demon-quelling staff, and struck at the Taoist's
 head by way of an answer. Because the Taoist could not move out of the
 way fast enough the blow broke his arm and he fell to the ground,
 straggling to escape.</P>
<P>&#8220;I was going to kill you, you evil beast,&#8221; roared Friar Sand, &#8220;but
 seeing as you're human I feel sorry for you and I'll let you go. Now
 let me get my water.&#8221; The Taoist crawled to the back of the hermitage
 thanking heaven and earth for his escape. Friar Sand then filled his
 bucket with water from the well, went out through the gates, rose up on
 his cloud, and called to Monkey, &#8220;I've got the water, brother. Spare
 him now, spare him.&#8221;</P>
<P>Hearing this, Monkey held the hook at bay with his cudgel and said,
 &#8220;Listen to what I have to say. I was going to wipe all of you out, but
 you've broken no laws and your brother the Bull Demon King is a friend
 of mine. The first time I came you tripped me up with your hook a
 couple of times and I couldn't get the water. I lured you out to fight
 me so that my fellow disciple could get some water. If I'd used my full
 powers I'd have killed several of you, never mind just one As-you-will
 Immortal. But it's better to spare life than to take it, so I'll let
 you live a few more years. Never ever try extortion on anyone who comes
 here for the water again.&#8221;</P>
<P>The evil and foolish immortal moved and tried to hook Monkey once
 more, but Monkey avoided the hook, rushed at him, and shouted, &#8220;Don't
 move!&#8221; The helpless immortal fell head first to the ground and was
 unable to get up. The Great Sage picked up his As-You-Will hook,
 snapped it in two, then broke the two pieces into four, and threw them
 to the ground. &#8220;Damned beast,&#8221; he said, &#8220;are you going to try any more
 nonsense?&#8221; The trembling immortal had to bear his humiliation in
 silence, and the laughing Great Sage rose up on his cloud. There is a
 poem that testifies to this. It goes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When true lead is melted it yields a true liquid;</P>
<P>If the true liquid is mixed right, true mercury hardens.</P>
<P>True mercury and true lead have no feminine quality;</P>
<P>Magic cinnabar and herbs are the elixir of immortality.</P>
<P>When a child is recklessly formed and a pregnancy results</P>
<P>The mother of earth succeeds without any effort.</P>
<P>Heresy is pushed over and orthodoxy honoured;</P>
<P>The heart's lord succeeds and returns in smiles.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Great Sage set off his cloud and caught up with Friar Sand. They
 were very pleased to be returning with the magical water as they
 brought their cloud down at the cottage to find Pig leaning against the
 door and groaning with his big belly sticking out. &#8220;Idiot,&#8221; said
 Monkey, stealing up on him, &#8220;when did you get yourself pregnant?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop teasing me,&#8221; said the idiot in desperation.</P>
<P>&#8220;Did you fetch the water?&#8221; Monkey was going to keep the joke up but
 Friar Sand then arrived to report with a smile, &#8220;Here's the water.&#8221;</P>
<P>Despite his agony Sanzang managed to lean forward in a kind of bow as
 he said, &#8220;Disciples, I'm very grateful to you.&#8221; The old woman was
 pleased too, and the whole household came in to bow and say,
 &#8220;Bodhisattvas, this is wonderful, wonderful.&#8221; She fetched a drinking
 bowl of decorated porcelain, half filled it with the water, and handed
 it to Sanzang with the words, &#8220;Venerable sir, please drink it very
 slowly. One mouthful will be enough to end the pregnancy.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I won't need a bowl,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;I'll drink the lot, bucket, rope
 and all.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Venerable sir,&#8221; the woman said, &#8220;don't give me such a terrible
 fright. If you drank the whole bucketful it would dissolve all your
 insides.&#8221; This gave the idiot such a fright that he behaved himself and
 drank only half a bowlful too.</P>
<P>Within less time than it takes to eat a meal the two of them were in
 agony: their intestines felt as if they were being wrung out and gave
 several loud rumbles. After that the idiot could contain himself no
 longer; he emptied his bowels and his bladder. The Tang Priest, also
 unable to contain himself, wanted to go to the lavatory.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Brother Monkey, &#8220;you mustn't go anywhere you might be
 in a draft, If you catch a cold you may get milk fever.&#8221; The woman then
 brought in two latrine buckets for the pair of them. When they had both
 used them several times the pain stopped and their stomachs gradually
 started to resume their normal size as the extra flesh and blood in
 them was dissolved.</P>
<P>The woman then cooked them some plain rice porridge to settle their
 stomachs. &#8220;Lady,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;my stomach's very strong, and it doesn't
 need settling. Boil me some water for a bath before I eat my porridge.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You mustn't have a bath, brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;Washing in he
 first month after childbirth can make you ill.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That wasn't childbirth,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;just a miscarriage: nothing to
 worry about. I want a bath to clean up.&#8221; The woman then boiled some
 water for them to wash their hands and feet. The Tang Priest could only
 manage two bowls of porridge while Pig downed a dozen or so and still
 wanted more.</P>
<P>&#8220;Idiot,&#8221; said Monkey with a laugh, &#8220;don't eat so much. It wouldn't
 look pretty at all if you got a big belly like a sandbag.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No problem,&#8221; said pig, &#8220;no problem. I'm not a sow, so I don't need
 to worry about that.&#8221; The women then went out to cook him some more
 rice.</P>
<P>&#8220;Will you give me the rest of the water?&#8221; the old woman asked the
 Tang Priest.</P>
<P>&#8220;Have you had enough of the water?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;My stomach's stopped hurting,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;and I'm sure the
 pregnancy's completely finished. As I'm fine now I don't need any
 more.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As they're both better now we'll give you the water,&#8221; said Monkey.
 The woman thanked him and buried the water in a glazed jar behind the
 house.</P>
<P>&#8220;That jar of water will be enough to pay for my coffin,&#8221; she told the
 rest of her family, who were all delighted. A vegetarian meal was
 prepared, tables and chairs were set out, and the monks dined. They
 took their time over the meal then retired for the night.</P>
<P>The next morning they thanked the old woman and her family and left
 the cottage. Sanzang mounted the horse, Friar Sand shouldered the
 luggage, the Great Sage Monkey led the way, and Pig held the bridle.
 This had been a case of</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Rinsing away the evil and leaving the body pure,</P>
<P>Dissolving the mortal foetus to restore the natural self.</P>

<P>The Buddha-Nature Traveling West Enters Womankind</P>
<P>The Mind-Ape Makes a Plan to Escape from the Beauties</P>
</B>
<P>When Sanzang and his disciples left the cottage they headed West, and
 about a dozen miles later they entered the country of Western Liang.
 &#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said the Tang Priest on his horse, &#8220;there is a city not far
 ahead, and I can hear a great hubbub of voices from the marketplace.
 You must all be very, very careful and on your best behavior. Do not
 make nonsense of the teachings of our Buddhist faith by running wild or
 becoming infatuated.&#8221; The three disciples were determined to obey his
 instructions.</P>
<P>Before the Tang Priest had finished speaking they reached the street
 leading in from the Eastern gate. Everyone they saw was wearing a skirt
 and a woman's jacket, a powdered face and oiled hair. All the people,
 young and old, were women. When those buying and selling in the street
 saw the four of them coming they started to applaud, laugh and say with
 smiles all over their faces, &#8220;Men, men!&#8221; Sanzang was so alarmed that he
 reined in his horse, unable to go any further forward. In a moment the
 streets were packed and the air was ringing with happy voices.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm a gelded pig, a gelded pig!&#8221; yelled Pig in a panic.</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop that nonsense, idiot,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Just show them your face
 the way it used to be.&#8221; Pig then shook his head a couple of times,
 stuck up his ears shaped like reed fans, twisted his bristly, dropping
 snout and give a roar that made all the women collapse with fright.
 There is a poem to prove it that goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The monk came to Western Liang on his way to the Buddha;</P>
<P>The streets were a feminine world where males were not seen.</P>
<P>Peasants, scholars and artisans, merchants and fisherfolk,</P>
<P>Woodcutters, tillers and stock-raisers&#8212;all were women.</P>
<P>The beauties poured into the streets to welcome the men;</P>
<P>Young women come in crowds to hail the handsome groom.</P>
<P>If Wuneng had not made full use of his hideous face,</P>
<P>The pilgrims could not have withstood a siege by the ladies.</P>
<P>The women were then all so frightened that they dared not approach.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Clutching their hands, stooping, shaking their heads, chewing at
 their fingers, trembling and shaking they blocked the streets to look
 at the Tang Priest. The Great Sage Monkey also pulled a hideous face to
 clear a way for them, helped by grimaces from Friar Sand. Leading the
 horse, pig stuck out his snout and was flapping his ears. As they moved
 forward they saw that the buildings along the city streets were
 well-built and the shop fronts imposing. There were grocers and
 corn-chandlers, bars and teahouses, multi-storied shops where
 everything was sold, towers and fine mansions with well-draped windows.</P>
<P>Master and disciples turned one corner to come up against a female
 official standing in the street and shouting. &#8220;Envoys from afar, you
 may not enter the city gates without permission. Please go to the
 government post station and register your names so that I can report
 them to Her Majesty. When they have been examined you will be allowed
 to proceed.&#8221; Hearing this, Sanzang dismounted and saw that the words
 MALE-WELCOMING POST STATION were written on a board across the door of
 the official building.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said the venerable elder, &#8220;what the village people told us
 was true. There really is a Male-welcoming Post Station.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother Pig,&#8221; chuckled Friar Sand, &#8220;you'd better look in the
 Pregnancy-revealing Spring to see if you have a double reflection.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop trying to make a fool of me,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;I aborted after
 drinking the water from Miscarriage Spring. What would I need to look
 for?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Watch your words, Wuneng, watch your words,&#8221; said Sanzang, turning
 back to give Pig his instructions before going forward and greeting the
 official.</P>
<P>She led them into the main hall of the post station, where they sat
 down and tea was sent for. Here too the staff all had their hair in
 bunches and wore skirts. There were many smiles as the tea was brought.
 A little later, when it had been drunk, the official gave a slight bow
 as she sat there and asked, &#8220;On what business have you emissaries
 come?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We are envoys sent to the Western Heaven by the Great Tang emperor
 in the East to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures,&#8221; Monkey
 replied. &#8220;My master Tang Sanzang is the Tang emperor's younger brother.
 I am Sun Wukong, his senior disciple, and these two are my fellows, Zhu
 Wuneng, Pig, and Sha Wujing, Friar Sand. If you count the horse there
 are five of us altogether. We are carrying a passport with us that we
 beg to have inspected so that we may be allowed to continue on our
 way.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the woman official had finished writing all this down she
 dropped to her knees to kowtow to them and said, &#8220;Forgive me, my lords.
 I am only the superintendent of the Male-welcoming Post Station and I
 did not realize that you were gentlemen from a superior country who
 deserved to be met at a great distance from here.&#8221; She rose to her feet
 and ordered the staff to provide them with food and drink. &#8220;Please make
 yourselves comfortable, my lords, while I go into the city to report to
 our queen. Then your document will be dealt with and you will be seen
 on your way West with rich presents.&#8221; Sanzang was happy to sit there.</P>
<P>The superintendent neatened her clothes and went straight into the
 city to the Tower of Five Phoenixes at the palace entrance, where she
 said to the gate officer, &#8220;I am the superintendent of the
 Male-welcoming Post Station and I would like an audience with Her
 Majesty on a certain matter.&#8221; The gate officer reported this to the
 queen at once, at which the superintendent was summoned straight to the
 throne hall to be asked what it was she had come to say.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your humble subject,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;has received in her post station
 Tang Sanzang the younger brother of the Tang emperor in the East. He
 has three disciples called Sun Wukong, Zhu Wuneng and Sha Wujing and a
 horse, making five of them altogether. They wish to go to the Western
 Heaven to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures. I have come
 especially to submit a memorial to Your Majesty asking whether they may
 be allowed to submit their passport for approval and proceed on their
 way.&#8221;</P>
<P>The queen was delighted at his report, and she said to her civil
 officials, &#8220;We dreamed last night of a gold screen shining with colours
 and a jade mirror full of light. They must have been good omens of what
 has happened today.&#8221;</P>
<P>The women officials crowded round the steps of the throne and said
 with kowtows, &#8220;Your Majesty, how can you tell that they were good omens
 for today?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This man from the East,&#8221; the queen replied, &#8220;is the younger brother
 of the Tang emperor. Since primal chaos was first cleared we have never
 seen a man in our country under all the queens who have reigned here.
 The fortunate arrival of the Tang emperor's younger brother must be a
 gift from Heaven. I have decided to use our country's wealth to
 persuade the emperor's brother to become king with me as his queen.
 Then we can unite the male and the female and produce sons and
 grandsons to pass the throne on to. So weren't they good omens?&#8221; The
 joyful women officials all performed dances of obeisance.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty's idea of passing the throne on to future generations
 in an excellent one,&#8221; the superintendent of the post station further
 submitted, &#8220;but the three hideous disciples of the emperor's younger
 brother are not at all attractive.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What does the emperor's brother look like,&#8221; the queen asked, &#8220;and
 how are the disciples so unattractive?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The emperor's brother has a handsome face and an impressive
 bearing,&#8221; the superintendent replied. &#8220;He really does look like a man
 from a great country ruled by a heaven-sent dynasty, a son of China in
 the Southern Jambu continent. But the three disciples look thoroughly
 vicious with faces like demons.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said the queen, &#8220;give presents to his disciples,
 return their passport, and send them on their way to the Western
 Heaven. Keep only the emperor's brother here. Is there any reason why
 we should not?&#8221;</P>
<P>To this the officials bowed low and replied, &#8220;Your Majesty's ideas
 are completely right and your subjects will respectfully implement
 them. The only difficulty is that we have no matchmaker to arrange the
 marriage. As the old saying goes</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Marriage and mating depend on red leaves;</P>
<P>A matchmaker ties the threads between husband and wife.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;From what you suggest,&#8221; the queen replied, &#8220;the royal tutor should
 be invited to be matchmaker, and the superintendent of the
 Male-welcoming Post Station will be the mistress of ceremonies. Go to
 the post station and ask for the consent of the emperor's younger
 brother. When he has agreed we shall go out of the city in our carriage
 to greet him.&#8221; The tutor and the superintendent left the palace to
 carry out their instructions.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sanzang and his disciples were just enjoying a vegetarian meal in the
 hall of the post station when someone was heard outside announcing the
 arrival of the queen's tutor and the superintendent.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why is the queen's tutor here?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Perhaps it's an invitation from the queen,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;It's either
 that or a proposal of marriage,&#8221; said Brother Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;But if she tries to force me to marry her and refuses to let us go
 what am I to do, Wukong?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Just agree, Master,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'll find a way to cope.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before, they had finished their conversation the two women officials
 entered and bowed low to the venerable elder, who returned their
 courtesies and said, &#8220;I am a humble monk. What wonderful powers do I
 have that you should bow to me thus?&#8221;</P>
<P>The queen's tutor was discreetly delighted with his noble bearing,
 thinking, &#8220;Our country will indeed be very fortunate if this man is to
 become our queen's husband.&#8221; When the two officials had finished bowing
 they stood on either side of Sanzang and said, &#8220;Imperial brother, many,
 many congratulations.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am a monk,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;so what good fortune is there to
 congratulate me on?&#8221;</P>
<P>Bowing again, the queen's tutor said, &#8220;This is Womanland of Western
 Liang, and no man has ever come here before. As Your Excellency the
 emperor's brother has graced us with your presence I am here on the
 orders of Her Majesty the queen to propose marriage.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Good gracious!&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;I have come to your distinguished
 country with no children apart from my three boorish disciples. Which
 of them is it that Her Majesty wishes to marry?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have just been to the palace to report,&#8221; the superintendent of the
 post station said, &#8220;and our queen was very, very happy. She said that
 last night she had an auspicious dream in which a golden screen shone
 with many colours, and a jade mirror was full of light. When she
 learned that Your Excellency the emperor's brother was a man from the
 great land of Tang she decided to offer you all the wealth of our
 country to persuade you to stay here as her husband and sit on the
 throne. Her Majesty would become queen consort. The royal tutor was
 commissioned to act as matchmaker and I was made mistress of
 ceremonies. We are here to ask for your hand.&#8221; At this Sanzang bowed
 his head in silence.</P>
<P>&#8220;A true man does not throw away his chance,&#8221; the queen's tutor said.
 &#8220;There is nothing unusual about a man being asked to marry a woman and
 live in her house, but rarely does it happen that one is offered the
 wealth of a state to do so. I beg the emperor's brother to assent
 quickly so that I may report back to Her Majesty.&#8221; The venerable elder
 seemed to have been struck dumb.</P>
<P>Pig, who was standing beside them, put his hands to his snout and
 called, &#8220;Tutor, please report back to Her Majesty that my master is an
 arhat who has long cultivated the Way. He's not interested in your
 country's wealth or in Her Majesty's great beauty. Hurry up and return
 our passport and send him on his way to the West. You can keep me here
 to be her husband. What about it?&#8221; The suggestion made the tutor
 tremble. She was speechless with shock.</P>
<P>&#8220;You may be a man,&#8221; the superintendent said, &#8220;but you are much too
 ugly for Her Majesty.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't understand,&#8221; said pig. &#8220;Thick willow twigs make dustpans
 and fine ones make funnels. There's a use for everything. There's not a
 man in all the world who's really ugly.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Idiot,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;stop that nonsense. Let our master decide. If
 he agrees the wedding is on, and if he doesn't it's off. Don't waste
 the matchmaker's time.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;you decide.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you ask me,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;you'd be very well off here. As the
 old saying goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A thousand miles can't keep apart</P>
<P>A couple that's fated to wed:</P>
<P>Their lives and destinies are tied</P>
<P>By a long and invisible thread.</P>
<P>Where else will you find a place that offers you this much?&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;if we stay here out of a love for wealth
 and status who will go to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures?
 Would that not be a terrible thing to do to our Great Tang emperor?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Excellency,&#8221; the royal tutor replied, &#8220;I must tell you the
 truth. Our queen only intends to marry you, the emperor's brother. Your
 three disciples will be invited to the wedding banquet, given presents,
 have their passport returned, and be allowed to go on their journey to
 the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What the royal tutor says is right,&#8221; replied Monkey. &#8220;We three
 mustn't make difficulties. We'll let our master stay here as the
 queen's husband. Hurry up and return us our travel document so that we
 can be on our way West. We will pay our respects to Her Majesty on our
 way back with the scriptures, and ask for some money for the journey
 back to the Great Tang.&#8221;</P>
<P>The royal tutor and the superintendent both bowed to Monkey and said,
 &#8220;We are very grateful to you, sir, for your helpfulness.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Tutor,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;don't just talk about feeding us. Now that we've
 agreed, get your mistress to lay on a banquet so that we can all drink
 a cup of betrothal wine. What about it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said the tutor, &#8220;a banquet will be provided.&#8221; The
 superintendent and the tutor returned in great delight to report back
 to the queen.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sanzang meanwhile grabbed Monkey and started abusing him. &#8220;You're
 trying to kill me, you ape. How could you say things like that? Making
 me stay here to be her husband while you go to the Western Heaven to
 worship the Buddha! I'd die before I agreed to do that.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry, Master,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Of course I know your nature.
 But faced with people like that in a place like this I had to play them
 at their own game.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean by playing them at their own game?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you had been obstinate and refused her she would not have
 returned our travel paper or let us continue on our way,&#8221; Monkey
 replied. &#8220;If she had turned vicious and called on all her underlings to
 slice your flesh off to make perfume bags or whatever we'd never have
 earned a good reward. We'd have had to use our magic powers for
 subduing and killing demons. You know how hard we hit and how murderous
 our weapons are. Once we got going we'd have wiped out everyone in the
 whole country. But they're people, not demons, even if they are
 blocking our way. And all along this journey you've been good and
 merciful&#8212;you haven't killed a single soul. How could you bear to kill
 so many innocent people? That really would be evil.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; replied Sanzang, &#8220;that is a very fine argument. But I'm
 afraid that when the queen takes me into her palace she will want me to
 perform my conjugal duties. I could not possibly lose my primal
 masculinity and ruin my conduct as a Buddhist monk, or let my true seed
 escape and destroy my status in the faith.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As you have agreed to the marriage she is bound to treat you as king
 and come out in her carriage to fetch you,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;You must
 on no account refuse. Take your seat in the phoenix and dragon
 carriage, enter the throne hall, and sit on the throne facing South as
 monarch. Tell the queen to fetch her royal seals and write an
 invitation summoning us to court. Stamp our travel permit with the
 official seal and ask her to sign it herself and return it to us. Have
 a banquet laid on as a celebration for yourself and the queen and to
 say farewell to us too. When the banquet is over have the carriage got
 ready and tell her that when you have seen us three out of the city you
 will be coming back to sleep with her. This will put the queen and her
 subjects into such a good mood that they won't try to keep us any more,
 let alone have any evil intentions towards us. When you have escorted
 us out of the city, get out of the carriage. Tell Friar Sand to stay
 with you and help you mount the white horse while I use some
 immobilizing magic to stop the queen and her subjects from moving. Then
 we can carry on West along the main road, and when we've been
 travelling for a day and a night I'll say a spell to undo the magic and
 revive them so that they can go back into the city. This way none of
 them will be killed and you won't have to harm your essential spirit.
 This is what they call a plan to 'slip through the net with a false
 marriage.' It works both ways, doesn't it?&#8221;</P>
<P>These words sobered Sanzang up and woke him from his dream. He forgot
 his worries and thanked Monkey profusely: &#8220;I am profoundly grateful to
 you, good disciple, for your brilliant suggestion.&#8221; Now that the four
 of them had agreed on a plan we shall leave them discussing it.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The queen's tutor and the post station superintendent went straight
 through the gates of the palace to the steps of the throne without
 waiting to be summoned. &#8220;Your Majesty's auspicious dream was completely
 justified,&#8221; they announced. &#8220;You two will be as happy together as fish
 and water.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the queen heard their report she lifted the pearl curtain, came
 down from her dragon throne, and gave a smile that opened her cherry
 lips and showed her silvery teeth as she asked in her charming voice,
 &#8220;What did the emperor's brother say when you spoke to him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When we reached the post station and had bowed to the emperor's
 brother,&#8221; the queen's tutor replied, &#8220;we told him of the proposal of
 marriage. He tried to decline it, but fortunately his senior disciple
 agreed on his behalf. He would like his master to marry Your Majesty
 and sit on the throne as king. He asked that you should first return
 their passport and send the three disciples on their way West. When
 they come back with the scriptures they will pay their respects to
 their master and Your Majesty and ask for some money for their journey
 back to Great Tang.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What did the emperor's brother say to that?&#8221; the queen asked with a
 smile.</P>
<P>&#8220;He did not speak,&#8221; the tutor replied, &#8220;but he is willing to marry
 Your Majesty. The only thing is that his second disciple wants a
 betrothal feast first.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the queen heard this she ordered the office that dealt with
 foreign relations to lay on a banquet. She also had the state carriage
 prepared to take her out of the city to welcome her lord and husband.
 The female officials obediently swept the palace clean and laid on a
 banquet in the hall. Those who were setting out the banquet moved as
 fast as fire, and those who were preparing the chariot did so with the
 speed of shooting stars. Western Liang was a country of women, but its
 state carriage was no less splendid than a Chinese one:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Six dragons snorting out coloured clouds,</P>
<P>A pair of phoenixes full of good omen.</P>
<P>The six dragons supported the carriage as it came out,</P>
<P>The pair of phoenixes were riding upon it.</P>
<P>Fragrant were the perfumes,</P>
<P>Dense the clouds of auspicious vapor.</P>
<P>Officials with goldfish-shaped pendants of jade now crowded around;</P>
<P>The women were all drawn up with their hair full of ornaments.</P>
<P>Mandarin-duck fans gave shade to the carriage,</P>
<P>While curtains of jade and pearl did shelter the queen.</P>
<P>Beautifully sounded the songs to the panpipes</P>
<P>While strings and woodwinds all played in harmony.</P>
<P>A surge of joy soared up to the heavens;</P>
<P>Boundless bliss poured out from the heart.</P>
<P>The triple silken canopy shook the sky;</P>
<P>Brilliant banners cast their light on the throne steps.</P>
<P>Never before had the marriage cup here been drunk;</P>
<P>Today the queen would be taking a husband.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The carriage soon left the city and reached the Male-welcoming Post
 Station. At once the queen's arrival was announced to Sanzang and his
 disciples, who straightened up their clothes and came out to meet the
 queen's carriage. The queen raised the curtain and came out. &#8220;Which of
 these gentlemen is the Tang emperor's brother?&#8221; she asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The gentleman in front of the post station who is wearing a long
 gown,&#8221; the tutor replied. The queen took a very careful look at him
 with her phoenix eyes, her moth-eyebrows raised. He was indeed an
 exceptional sight. Look at him:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A noble manner,</P>
<P>Distinguished features.</P>
<P>White teeth as if made of silver,</P>
<P>A square-cut mouth with lips of red.</P>
<P>The top of the head flat, the forehead broad and ample;</P>
<P>Fine eyes, a clear brow, and a long jaw.</P>
<P>His ears had the round lobes of a great man;</P>
<P>His body was that of one with no ordinary talent.</P>
<P>A handsome, intelligent and gallant gentleman;</P>
<P>The ideal consort for the graceful queen.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As the queen was gazing at him with delight and admiration she felt a
 great surge of desire and passion. Opening her cherry lips she said,
 &#8220;Younger brother of the Great Tang emperor, won't you ride in my royal
 carriage?&#8221; This made Sanzang blush from ear to ear. He was too
 embarrassed to look up at her.</P>
<P>Pig, who was standing beside him, put his hands to his snout and
 devoured the queen with his eyes. She was a slim beauty:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Brows like green willow,</P>
<P>Flesh like mutton fat,</P>
<P>Cheeks set off with plum blossom,</P>
<P>Hair like the plumage of a golden phoenix.</P>
<P>The autumn waves of her eyes were full of charm;</P>
<P>Like bamboo shoot in spring was her graceful posture.</P>
<P>Red tassels floated with elegance over her temples,</P>
<P>Pearls and kingfisher feathers adorned her high-piled hair.</P>
<P>Why talk now of the Princess Zhaojun's beauty?</P>
<P>This queen is lovelier than the legendary Xi Shi.</P>
<P>As her willow waist gently bends gold pendants tinkle;</P>
<P>Her lotus feet move lightly with her limbs of jade.</P>
<P>The Lady of the Moon could not compare with her;</P>
<P>No heavenly fairy could be her match.</P>
<P>Her exquisite palace clothes were not those of a mere mortal;</P>
<P>She was the Queen Mother of the West come to the Jade Pool.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Seeing how beautiful she was the idiot could not help drooling. His
 heart pounded and his limbs went weak; he melted like a snow lion next
 to a bonfire.</P>
<P>When the queen came closer to Sanzang she took hold of him and said
 in a most beguiling voice, &#8220;Dear emperor's brother, won't you come into
 my dragon coach, ride back with me to the throne hall and marry me?&#8221;
 The venerable elder trembled, feeling unsteady on his feet. It was as
 if he were drunk or stupefied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be so shy and modest, Master,&#8221; urged monkey, who was standing
 beside him. &#8220;Please get into the carriage with your future wife. Have
 our passport returned to us as soon as possible so that we can continue
 on our journey to fetch the scriptures.&#8221; Sanzang could not bring
 himself to reply as he put his hand on Monkey, unable to hold back his
 tears.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be so upset, Master,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;Here's your chance to
 enjoy wealth and honour, so make the most of it.&#8221; Sanzang had no choice
 but to do as Monkey bade him. Wiping his tears away he forced himself
 to smile as he stepped forward to</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Hold the queen's white hand</P>
<P>Sitting in the dragon carriage.</P>
<P>The queen was in raptures at the prospect of a husband;</P>
<P>The elder in his terror wanted only to worship the Buddha.</P>
<P>One longed to embrace her man in the candle-lit bedroom;</P>
<P>The other wanted to see the</P>
<P>World-honoured on Vulture Peak.</P>
<P>The queen was sincere,</P>
<P>The holy monk was pretending.</P>
<P>The queen in her sincerity</P>
<P>Hoped that they would grow old in harmony together.</P>
<P>The holy monk pretending</P>
<P>Controlled his tender feeling to nourish his primal spirit.</P>
<P>One was so happy to see her husband</P>
<P>She wished they could be man and wife in broad daylight.</P>
<P>The other was afraid of woman's beauty,</P>
<P>Longing to escape her clutches and climb to the Thunder Monastery.</P>
<P>The two ascended the carriage together,</P>
<P>But the Tang Priest's intentions were far away.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the civil and military officers saw their mistress enter the
 royal coach with the venerable Sanzang sitting beside her their faces
 were all wreathed in smiles. The procession turned around and went back
 into the city. Monkey told Friar Sand to carry the luggage while he led
 the horse as they followed behind the coach. Pig rushed wildly ahead,
 and when he reached the Tower of Five Phoenixes he started shouting,
 &#8220;This is very fine and splendid, but it won't do, it won't do at all.
 We've got to have some wedding drinks to toast the groom.&#8221;</P>
<P>He so alarmed the women officials carrying ceremonial insignia who
 were leading the procession that they all went back to the queen's
 carriage to report, &#8220;Your Majesty, the one with big ears and a long
 snout is making a row in front of the Tower of Five Phoenixes and
 demanding wedding drinks.&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing this the queen leant her fragrant shoulder against
 Sanzang, pressed her peach-blossom cheek against his, and opened her
 sandalwood-scented mouth to murmur in her seductive voice, &#8220;Dear
 emperor's brother, is the one with big ears and a long snout one of
 your distinguished disciples?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He is my second disciple,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;He has an enormous
 appetite, and he has spent all his life trying to get good things to
 eat. We must lay on some food and drink for him before we can get on
 with things.&#8221; The queen then asked anxiously if the office dealing with
 foreign relation had yet prepared the banquet.</P>
<P>&#8220;It is ready,&#8221; the women officials reported. &#8220;It is set out on the
 Eastern hall and includes both meat and vegetarian dishes.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why both sorts?&#8221; the queen asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your subjects thought that the Tang emperor's brother and his
 distinguished disciples might be vegetarians,&#8221; the officials replied.
 &#8220;That was why we had both sorts of food provided.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Dear emperor's brother,&#8221; said the queen with another little laugh of
 pleasure as she rubbed herself against Sanzang's fragrant cheek, &#8220;do
 you eat meat or vegetarian food?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I eat vegetarian food,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;but I have never given up
 wine. We must have a few cups of light wine for my second disciple to
 drink.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before he had finished speaking the queen's tutor said to the queen,
 &#8220;If it pleases Your Majesty, will you come to the Eastern hall for the
 banquet? Today is an auspicious day, and at a lucky hour tonight you
 may marry the emperor's brother. Tomorrow a new ecliptic begins, and I
 beg that the emperor's younger brother will enter the throne hall
 tomorrow to take his throne facing South as monarch and inaugurate a
 new reign.&#8221;</P>
<P>The queen was delighted by this suggestion. Descending from the coach
 hand-in-hand with Sanzang she went in through the palace's main gate.
 This is what they saw and heard:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Magic music wafting down from a gallery,</P>
<P>As the turquoise carriage came within the palace.</P>
<P>The phoenix gates stood wide open amid gentle light;</P>
<P>The harem in all its splendor was not closed.</P>
<P>Incense smoke curled aloft in the unicorn hall;</P>
<P>Shadows were moving behind the peacock screen.</P>
<P>The buildings were magnificent as those of a mighty state;</P>
<P>The jade halls and golden horses were even more splendid.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When they reached the Eastern hall the harmonious sounds of panpipes
 and singing could be heard and two rows of powdered beauties seen. In
 the middle of the hall two sumptuous banquets were set out; a
 vegetarian one to the left and a meat one on the right. Below were two
 rows of individual places. The queen folded back her sleeves, took a
 jade goblet with her ten delicate fingers, and led Sanzang to the
 feast. Monkey went up to her and said, &#8220;We are all vegetarians, so
 would you ask my master to sit at the vegetarian feast to the left
 while three places are set below him for us three disciples?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, that's right,&#8221; said the queen's tutor. &#8220;Master and disciples
 are like father and sons. It would be wrong to seat them side by side.&#8221;
 The women officials quickly rearranged the seating, and the queen gave
 goblets to each of them as she led them to their places. Monkey gave
 the Tang Priest a look to remind him to return her courtesies, at which
 he came down from his seat with a jade goblet in his hand and led the
 queen to her place. The civil and military officials all kowtowed to
 the queen in gratitude and took their seats in order of precedence on
 either side. Only then did the music cease and the toasts begin.</P>
<P>Pig did not worry about anything as he relaxed his belly and ate for
 all he was worth. He did not care whether it was jadeflake rice,
 steamed buns, sweet cakes, mushrooms, gill fungus, bamboo shoots,
 tree-ear fungus, day lilies, agar, laver, turnips, taro, devilpepper,
 yams or sealwort: he wolfed the whole lot down together. Then he drank
 some six or seven goblets of wine and shouted, &#8220;Fill it up, bring me
 another. I want a big goblet. Give me a few more drinks, then we can
 all go off and do what we've got to do.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What is there so important that makes us have to leave this fine
 banquet?&#8221; Friar Sand asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;There's an old saying,&#8221; replied the idiot with a grin, &#8220;'that each
 man should stick to his trade. Some of us are getting married now, and
 others of us have to be on our way to fetch the scriptures. We mustn't
 ruin everything for the sake of a few more drinks. We want our passport
 returned as soon as possible. As they say, 'The warriors stay on their
 horses, all of them pressing ahead.'&#8220; When the queen heard this she
 sent for big cups, and the officials in attendance quickly fetched some
 parrot-shaped goblets, cormorant ladles, golden baskets, silver
 beakers, glass chargers, crystal dishes, immortals' bowls and amber
 goblets. Ambrosial liquor was now served out and everybody drank of it.</P>
<P>Sanzang then bowed, rose to his feet, put his hands together in front
 of his chest and said to the queen, &#8220;Your Majesty, I am very grateful
 for this sumptuous banquet. We have had enough now. Could you now go to
 the throne hall and return the passport so that I may see the three of
 them off from the city tomorrow morning?&#8221; Doing as he asked, the queen
 led Sanzang by the hand as they ended the banquet and climbed the steps
 to the throne hall, where she invited the Tang Priest to sit on the
 throne.</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it would be wrong. As Your Majesty's tutor said, a
 new ecliptic begins tomorrow: only then will I dare to take the throne.
 Today the passport must be stamped so that they can be sent on their
 way.&#8221;</P>
<P>The queen accepted his suggestions, sat on the dragon throne again,
 had a gilt chair placed to the left of it for Sanzang to sit on, and
 told the disciples to bring the passport. The Great Sage asked Friar
 Sand to open the cloth wrapper and take it out, then offered it with
 both hands to the queen, who examined it carefully. At the top were
 nine stamps from the Great Tang emperor's seals, and underneath were
 the seals of the countries of Elephantia, Wuji and Tarrycart. When she
 had looked at them the queen said with a delightful, tinkling smile in
 her voice, &#8220;Is your surname Chen, emperor's brother?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My lay surname was Chen,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;and my religious name is
 Xuanzang. It was when the Tang emperor in his wisdom and mercy took me
 as his younger brother that he granted me the surname Tang.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why do your illustrious disciples' names not appear on the
 passport?&#8221; the queen asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;My three stupid disciples are not men of Tang.&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;But if they are not from Tang why have they come here with you?&#8221; the
 queen asked again.</P>
<P>&#8220;My senior disciple,&#8221; Sanzang answered, &#8220;was originally from the
 country of Aolai in the Eastern Continent of Superior Body. My second
 disciple is from Gao Village in Stubet in the Western Continent of
 Cattle-gift. My third disciple is from the Flowing Sands River. They
 were all punished for offences against the laws of Heaven until the
 Bodhisattva Guanyin delivered them from their sufferings. Since then
 they have been converted to the faith and have volunteered to escort me
 on my journey to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven to redeem
 their past crimes. I won each of them during the journey, which is why
 their religious names have not been entered on the passport.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Would you like me to add their names to it?&#8221; said the queen.</P>
<P>&#8220;If that is Your Majesty's pleasure,&#8221; Sanzang replied. The queen then
 sent for brush and inkstone, and when she had rubbed the ink-stick on
 the stone to produce a thick and fragrant ink with which she filled the
 hairs of her writing brush she wrote the names of the three
 disciples&#8212;Sun Wukong, Zhu Wuneng and Sha Wujing&#8212;at the bottom of the
 passport. Then she stamped it fair and square with her royal seal,
 wrote her signature, and handed it down to Monkey, who told Friar Sand
 to wrap it up again carefully.</P>
<P>The queen then presented them with a dish of small pieces of gold and
 silver, came down from her throne and said to Monkey, &#8220;You three must
 take this to help with the costs of your journey and go to the Western
 Heaven as quickly as you can. When you come back with the scriptures we
 shall richly reward you again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We are men of religion,&#8221; said Brother Monkey, &#8220;and we do not accept
 gold and silver. There will be places along the way for us to beg food
 from.&#8221; Seeing that they were not going to accept it the queen had ten
 bolts of damask and brocade brought out that she gave to Monkey with
 the words, &#8220;You are in such a hurry that we do not have time for this
 to be made up. Please take this to have some clothes made on the
 journey to keep you warm.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We monks may not wear damask or brocade,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;We are only
 allowed to cover ourselves with cotton cloth.&#8221; Seeing that he would not
 accept the silk either, the queen ordered that three pints of rice be
 brought out to provide them with a meal on their journey. The moment
 Pig heard the word &#8220;rice&#8221; he took it and put it with the bundles of
 luggage. &#8220;Brother,&#8221; Monkey said to him, &#8220;the luggage is very heavy now.
 Will you be able to carry the rice as well?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You wouldn't know that rice is best eaten the same day it's cooked,&#8221;
 Pig replied. &#8220;One meal and it'll be finished.&#8221; He then put his hands
 together in thanks.</P>
<P>&#8220;May I trouble Your Majesty to come with me while I escort my
 disciples out of the city?&#8221; Sanzang asked. &#8220;When I have given them some
 parting instructions about their journey West I shall come back to
 enjoy perpetual glory with Your Majesty. Only when I am freed from
 these cares and worries will we be able to join together like a pair of
 phoenixes.&#8221; Not realizing that this was a trick, the queen sent for her
 coach and climbed into it, leaning her fragrant shoulder against
 Sanzang as they rode Westwards out of the city. Bowls has been filled
 with clean water and fine incense put in all the burners. This was
 because the people were seeing their queen in her carriage and also
 because they were seeing a man, the emperor's younger brother. All of
 them, young and old alike, were women with powdered and lovely faces,
 and green-black hair piled high in cloud coiffures. The coach was soon
 out of the town and outside the Western gate.</P>
<P>Monkey, Pig and Friar Sand, joined in a common cause, neatened up
 their clothes and went to meet the carriage. &#8220;There is no need to
 escort us a long way, Your Majesty. We shall take our leave of you
 here.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang stepped down from the royal carriage, raised his hands
 together to the queen, and said, &#8220;Please go back now, Your Majesty, and
 allow me to fetch the scriptures.&#8221; When the queen heard this her face
 went pale with shock. She grabbed hold of the Tang Priest and said,
 &#8220;Dear emperor's brother, I have offered you the wealth of my realm to
 become my husband. Tomorrow you are going to take the throne as
 monarch, and I am going to be your consort. We have already eaten the
 wedding feast. How can you go back on your word now?&#8221;</P>
<P>This was too much for Pig, who went wild. Thrusting his snout about
 and waving his ears he rushed to the royal coach shouting. &#8220;What would
 monks like us want to marry a powdered skeleton like you for? Let my
 master go!&#8221; This rough and violent behavior so frightened the queen
 that her souls all went flying and she collapsed in the coach. Friar
 Sand pulled Sanzang out of the crowd and helped him mount the horse.
 Just then a woman shot forward from the roadside shouting, &#8220;Don't go,
 Tang emperor's brother. You and I are going to make love.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You ignorant, wicked creature,&#8221; Friar Sand shouted at her, striking
 at her head with his staff. The woman then made a whirlwind that
 carried the Tang Priest off with a great roar. He had disappeared
 without shadow or trace. Indeed</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He escaped from the net of beauties</P>
<P>To encounter a lecherous ogress.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know whether the woman was a human being or a monster,
 or whether the master lived or died, then listen to the explanation in
 the next installment.</P>
<B><I>
<P></P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="1_0_56">Chapter 55</A></H3>
</I>
<P>The Tang Priest Is Tempted with Sex<SUP></SUP> and Debauchery</P>
<P>Because His Nature Is Upright He Resists Unharmed</P>
</B>
<P>The story tells how the Great Sage and Pig were just about to use
 their magic to immobilize all the women when they suddenly heard the
 noise of a wind. Friar Sand, who was shouting, looked round at once to
 find the Tang Priest gone.</P>
<P>&#8220;Who's taken the master?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;A woman made a whirlwind and carried him off in it,&#8221; Friar Sand
 reported. At this news Monkey jumped up with a whoosh to stand on his
 cloud and shade his eyes as he looked all around. He saw the gray dust
 cloud of a whirlwind that was heading Northwest.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brothers,&#8221; he turned back to shout, &#8220;come straight up on your
 clouds. We're going after the master.&#8221; Pig and Friar Sand tied the
 luggage on the horse and both sprang noisily into the air.</P>
<P>All this gave such a fright to the queen of Western Liang and her
 subjects that they fell to their knees in the dust and said, &#8220;He is an
 arhat who has flown away in broad daylight. Do not be alarmed, Your
 Majesty. The Tang emperor's brother is a dhyana monk who has mastered
 the Way. We were too blind to see who this man of China really was, and
 we allowed ourselves all that longing for nothing. Please ride back to
 the palace in your carriage, Your Majesty.&#8221; The queen felt ashamed as
 she went back into her capital with her officials, and we shall say no
 more of them.</P>
<P>Monkey and the other two disciples meanwhile were riding their clouds
 through the air after the whirlwind. They chased it to a high mountain,
 where the gray dust settled and the wind fell, so that they did not
 know which way the demon had gone. The brothers brought their clouds
 down to land to search for the way. Suddenly they noticed a gleaming
 rock shaped like a screen. Leading the horse round behind it they found
 a pair of stone doors above which was written:</P>
<P>DEADLY FOE MOUNTAIN PIPA CAVE</P>
<P>In his ignorance Pig went up to the doors and was about to beat on
 them with his rake when Monkey rushed forward to stop him. &#8220;Don't be in
 such a hurry, brother,&#8221; he said. &#8220;After following the whirlwind we had
 to look around for a while before we found these doors. We don't know
 what's behind them. If they're the wrong doors we'd stir up trouble
 offending the wrong people, and we don't want to do that. You two take
 the horse round to the front of the rock screen and wait a moment. I'm
 going to take a look around and find out what's happening here. Then
 it'll be much easier to know what to do.&#8221;</P>
<P>Friar Sand liked this idea. &#8220;Splendid, splendid,&#8221; he said, &#8220;You've
 found the subtle solution when things were looking rough, the calm way
 out of the crisis.&#8221; The two of them then led the horse to the other
 side of the rock screen.</P>
<P>Monkey then showed his magic powers. Making a spell with his hands
 and saying the words he shook himself and turned into an exquisite bee.
 Just look at him:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Fine wings bending in the wind,</P>
<P>A narrow waist gleaming with the sun.</P>
<P>With his sweet mouth he searched for stamens,</P>
<P>While the sting in his tail killed toads.</P>
<P>Great was his achievement in making honey,</P>
<P>And he always entered the hive with courtesy.</P>
<P>Now be would use a brilliant plan</P>
<P>As he flew in under the eaves of the doorway.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey squeezed in through the crack between the outer doors then
 past the inner doors to see a female monster sitting in a flower
 pavilion with serving girls in brightly-coloured embroidered clothes
 and their hair sticking upwards in two bunches. They were all very
 pleased, but he could not hear what they were talking about. Monkey
 flew up to them very quietly, perched on the lattice of the pavilion,
 and cocked his ear to listen. He saw two women with their tangled hair
 tied in a bun carrying two piping hot dishes of food to the pavilion
 and saying, &#8220;Madam, this dish has steamed rolls with human flesh in
 them, and that one has vegetarian ones with sweet beanpaste fillings.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Little ones,&#8221; said the she-devil with a smile, &#8220;Bring the Tang
 emperor's brother out.&#8221; Some of the serving girls in embroidered
 clothes went to the room at the back to help the Tang Priest out. His
 face was sallow, his lips white, and his eyes red as the tears streamed
 down his face, &#8220;The master's been drugged,&#8221; thought Monkey with a
 silent sigh.</P>
<P>The she-devil went down from the pavilion and showed her ten fingers
 that were as delicate as spring onions as she grabbed hold of Sanzang
 and said, &#8220;Don't worry, emperor's brother. This may not be as rich and
 splendid as the palace in the Womanland of Western Liang, but it's
 peaceful and comfortable, and an ideal place for reciting the Buddha's
 name and reading the scriptures. With me as your companion we'll be
 able to live in harmony till we're a hundred.&#8221; Sanzang said nothing.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be upset,&#8221; the she-devil said. &#8220;I know that you had nothing to
 eat or to drink at your banquet in Womanland. Here are two dishes, one
 of meat and one of vegetarian food. Won't you take some to calm your
 nerves?&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang thought deeply: &#8220;If I say nothing and eat nothing, this
 she-devil may murder me. She is worse than the queen, who was at least
 human and knew how to behave. What am I to do? My disciples don't know
 that I'm a prisoner here. If I let her murder me I'll be throwing my
 life away for nothing.&#8221; Though he racked his brains he could find no
 other plan, so he pulled himself together and asked, &#8220;What is the meat
 dish and what is the vegetarian one?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The meat one is steamed rolls stuffed with human flesh, and the
 vegetarian one steamed rolls with sweet fillings,&#8221; the she-devil
 replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;I would like some of the vegetarian ones,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;Servant girls,&#8221; said the she-devil, &#8220;bring hot tea and give your
 master some vegetarian steamed rolls.&#8221; A servant girl then brought in a
 tray of tea that she set before the Tang Priest. The she-devil broke a
 vegetarian roll open and handed it to Sanzang, who offered a whole meat
 one to her. &#8220;Why won't you open it for me, emperor's brother?&#8221; the
 she-devil asked with a smile.</P>
<P>&#8220;I am a man of religion, so I would not dare to break meat food,&#8221;
 said Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said the she-devil, &#8220;Why did you eat wedding cake at
 the Motherhood River, and why are you insisting on eating beanpaste
 now?&#8221;</P>
<P>To this Sanzang replied,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;When the river is high I'm carried away.</P>
<P>When bogged down I have to slow down.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey, who could hear from his perch in the lattice just how
 friendly their conversation was getting, started worrying that the
 master's true nature might become disturbed. It was more than he could
 bear, so he resumed his own appearance and brandished his cudgel with a
 shout of &#8220;Behave yourself, you evil beast.&#8221; When the she-devil saw him
 she spat out smoke and light that covered the pavilion and told her
 underlings to shut the Tang Priest away.</P>
<P>Then she seized her steel trident and leapt out through the door of
 the pavilion, shouting abusively, &#8220;Hooligan ape! How dare you sneak
 into my house to set your dirty eyes on me! Stay where you are and take
 this!&#8221; The Great Sage parried the lunge from her trident and fell back,
 fighting all the way.</P>
<P>When they came to the outside of the cave where Pig and Friar Sand
 were waiting, the sight of the hard-fought battle so alarmed Pig that
 he led the white horse over to Friar Sand and said, &#8220;Look after the
 horse and the luggage. I'm joining in.&#8221; The splendid idiot then raised
 his rake with both hands and rushed forward with a shout, &#8220;Stand back,
 brother, while I kill this vicious beast.&#8221; Seeing Pig coming the
 she-devil used another kind of magic to breathe fire out of her nose
 and smoke from her mouth as she shook herself and charged him with her
 trident flying and dancing. Goodness only knows how many hands she had
 as she somersaulted towards them, lashing out furiously. Monkey and Pig
 were both fought to a standstill.</P>
<P>&#8220;Sun Wukong,&#8221; said the she-devil, &#8220;you don't know when to keep your
 head down. I know who you are, but you don't recognize me. Even your
 Tathagata Buddha from the Thunder Monastery is afraid of me. Where do
 you think you two little wretches are going to get? Come here, all of
 you, and watch me beat every one of you.&#8221; It was a fine battle:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Great was the she-devil's prowess</P>
<P>As the Monkey King's anger rose.</P>
<P>Then Marshal Tian Peng joined in the fight,</P>
<P>Showing off wildly wielding his rake.</P>
<P>One was a many-handed mistress of the trident,</P>
<P>Surrounding herself with smoke and with light;</P>
<P>The other two were impatient and their weapons powerful,</P>
<P>As they stirred up many a cloud of mist.</P>
<P>The she-devil was fighting to win a mate,</P>
<P>But the monk would never lose his vital seed.</P>
<P>Ill-matched male and female fought it out,</P>
<P>Each showing heroism in the bitter struggle.</P>
<P>Calmly the female had built up her strength, longing for action;</P>
<P>The male was on guard in his love of pure stillness.</P>
<P>This made peace between them impossible</P>
<P>As trident fought for mastery with cudgel and rake.</P>
<P>Powerful was the cudgel,</P>
<P>Even stronger the rake,</P>
<P>But the she-devil's trident was a match for them both.</P>
<P>Nobody would yield on Deadly Foe Mountain;</P>
<P>No mercy was given outside Pipa Cave.</P>
<P>One was happy at the thought of the Tang Priest as a husband;</P>
<P>The other two were going with him to collect the scriptures.</P>
<P>Heaven and earth were alarmed by the battle,</P>
<P>Which darkened sun and moon and displaced all the stars.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the three of them had been fighting for a long time without
 anyone emerging as victor, the she-devil shook herself and used the
 sting in her tail to jab the Great Sage in the head. Monkey yelled in
 agony at the unbearable pain and fled, defeated. Seeing that things
 were going badly Pig withdrew too, dragging his rake behind him. The
 victorious she-devil put her steel trident away.</P>
<P>Monkey had his hands round his head and his face screwed up in agony
 as he shouted, &#8220;It's terrible, it's terrible.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, going up to him, &#8220;why did you run away howling
 in pain just when you were fighting so well?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's agony, agony,&#8221; groaned Brother Monkey, still holding his head.</P>
<P>&#8220;Is it an attack of your migraine?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; said Monkey, hopping around in pain.</P>
<P>&#8220;But I didn't see you get wounded,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;so how can your head
 be hurting?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's unbearable,&#8221; groaned Monkey. &#8220;Just when she saw that I was
 beginning to beat her trident she braced herself and jabbed me in the
 head. I don't know what weapon she used, but it's made my head ache so
 unbearably that I had to run away, beaten.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In quiet places you're always boasting that your head was tempered
 in the furnace,&#8221; said Pig with a laugh, &#8220;so why was that too much for
 you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Monkey, &#8220;after my head was refined I stole the magic
 peaches and immortal wine and Lord Lao Zi's golden elixir tablets. When
 I made havoc in Heaven the Jade Emperor ordered the Strongarm Demon
 King and the Twenty eight Constellations to take me to be beheaded at
 the Dipper and Bull Palace. The gods used their cutlasses, axes,
 hammers and swords on me, struck me with thunderbolts and burned me
 with fire. Then Lao Zi put me in his Eight Trigrams Furnace and refined
 me for forty-nine days. None of that harmed me at all. Goodness only
 knows what weapon that woman used to make my head hurt like this.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Put your hands down and let me have a look,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;Has
 it been cut open?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'd better go back to Western Liang to get you some ointment to put
 on it,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's not cut open or swollen; I don't need ointment,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; laughed Pig, &#8220;I wasn't at all ill when I was pregnant or
 after I lost the baby, but you've got a carbuncle on your forehead.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop teasing him, brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;It's getting late, our
 eldest brother's been wounded in the head, and we don't know whether
 the master is dead or alive. What on earth are we going to do?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The master's all right,&#8221; groaned Brother Monkey. &#8220;I flew in as a bee
 and saw the woman sitting in a flower pavilion. Before long two servant
 girls came in with two dishes of steamed rolls, one with fillings of
 human flesh and one with sweet fillings of beanpaste. She sent two
 other serving girls to help the master come out to eat something to
 soothe his nerves. She was talking about being his companion. At first
 he wouldn't reply or eat any of the rolls, but she was giving him so
 much sweet talk that he said he'd have a vegetarian one. Goodness knows
 why. The woman broke one open and gave it to him, and he passed her an
 unbroken meat one. 'Why won't you open it for me?' She asked, and he
 said, 'I am a man of religion, so I would not dare to break meat food.'
 Then she said, 'In that case, why did you eat wedding cake at the
 Motherhood River, and why are you eating sweet fillings now?' The
 master did not catch what she was driving at, and replied, 'When the
 river is high I'm carried away; when bogged down I have to slow down.'
 Listening to all this from the lattice I got worried that the master
 was going to forget himself, so I turned back into myself and hit at
 her with my cudgel. She used magic too, breathed out clouds, told them
 to shut the master away, and drove me out of the cave with her
 trident.&#8221;</P>
<P>Friar Sand bit his finger and said, &#8220;That low bitch must have
 followed us at some stage, she knows so much.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;From what you say,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;we mustn't rest. From dusk to the
 middle of the night we've got to keep going back and challenging her to
 fight. We'll have to yell and make such a din that she can't go to bed
 or have it off with our master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I can't go back,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;My head's hurting too badly.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We can't challenge her to battle,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;Our eldest
 brother's head is aching and our master is a true monk. He won't let
 the illusion of sex disturb his nature. Let's spend the light sitting
 somewhere under the mountain that's sheltered from the wind. Then we
 can build up our energy and think of something else in the morning.&#8221;
 The three brother disciples tethered the white horse and guarded the
 luggage as they spent the night resting under the slope of the
 mountain.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The she-devil then put aside thoughts of murder and started to wear a
 mile again as she said, &#8220;Little ones, shut the front and back doors
 tight.&#8221; Then she sent out two scouts to keep an eye on Monkey, and
 ordered them to report the moment any sound was heard at the door.
 &#8220;Maids,&#8221; she commanded, &#8220;tidy the bedroom and get it ready. Bring
 candles, burn incense, and ask the Tang emperor's brother in. I'm going
 to make love with him.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Tang Priest was then helped out from the back, while the
 she-devil, looking utterly bewitching, took him by the hand and said,
 &#8220;As the saying goes, pleasure's worth more than gold. You and I are
 going to have some fun as man and wife.&#8221;</P>
<P>The venerable elder clenched his teeth and let out not a sound. He
 would have preferred not to go with her but he was afraid she might
 kill him, so in fear and trembling he accompanied her into the bridal
 chamber, he was as if stupefied and dumb. He would not lift his head
 and look up, let alone catch sight of the bed and the curtains in the
 room, and even less did he see the intricately carved furniture or her
 hairstyle and clothing. He was deaf and indifferent when she spoke of
 her desire. He was indeed a fine monk:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>His eyes saw no evil beauty,</P>
<P>His ears heard no voluptuous words.</P>
<P>To him the brocade and the lovely face was dung,</P>
<P>The gold, the jewels and the beauty so much dirt.</P>
<P>The love of his life was contemplation;</P>
<P>He never took a step from Buddha land.</P>
<P>He did not care for female charms,</P>
<P>Knowing only how to nourish his true nature.</P>
<P>The she-devil</P>
<P>Was full of life</P>
<P>And unbounded desire.</P>
<P>The venerable monk</P>
<P>Seemed almost dead,</P>
<P>His mind fixed on meditation.</P>
<P>One was soft jade and warm fragrance;</P>
<P>The other was dead ash and withered wood.</P>
<P>One spread open the bridal sheets,</P>
<P>Full of voluptuousness;</P>
<P>The other fastened his tunic more tightly,</P>
<P>His heart ever true.</P>
<P>One longed to press her breasts against him and entwine their limbs</P>
<P>In rapturous union;</P>
<P>The other wanted only to sit facing the wall</P>
<P>Like the monk Bodhidharma.</P>
<P>The she-devil took off her clothes,</P>
<P>Displaying her smooth skin and fragrant body;</P>
<P>The Tang Priest pulled his robes together,</P>
<P>Covering the roughness of his hide and flesh.</P>
<P>The she-devil said,</P>
<P>&#8220;There is room on my pillow and under my sheet:</P>
<P>Why not come to bed?&#8221;</P>
<P>The Tang Priest replied,</P>
<P>&#8220;My head is shaven and I wear monk's robes:</P>
<P>I may not join you.&#8221;</P>
<P>She said, &#8220;I would like to be Liu Cuicui in the story.&#8221;</P>
<P>He replied, &#8220;But I am not like the Monk of the Moonlight.&#8221;</P>
<P>The she-devil said, &#8220;I am more lovely than Xi Shi herself.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Long was the king of Yue buried on her account,&#8221; the monk replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Do you remember the lines,&#8221; the she-devil asked,</P>
<P>&#8220;'I'm willing to die and be buried under flowers;</P>
<P>Even as a ghost shall I live and love?'&#8221;</P>
<P>To this the Tang Priest replied,</P>
<P>&#8220;My true masculinity is my great treasure;</P>
<P>I could not lightly give it to a bag of bones like you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The two of them kept up their battle of words till it was late in the
 night, and the Tang Priest's resolution was unmoved. The she-devil kept
 tugging at his clothes, refusing to let go of him, while the master
 kept up his resistance. The struggle went on till the middle of the
 night, when the she-devil finally lost her temper and called, &#8220;Bring
 rope, little ones.&#8221; Sadly she had her beloved man tied up like a dog
 and dragged outside to the portico. Then the silver lamps were blown
 out and everyone went to bed for the night.</P>
<P>Before they knew it the cocks had crowed three times. On the
 mountainside the Great Sage Monkey leaned forward and said, &#8220;This head
 of mine ached for a while, but now it doesn't hurt or feel numb. It's
 just a bit itchy.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If it's itchy then what about letting her jab it again for you?&#8221;
 said Pig with a grin.</P>
<P>&#8220;We've got to make her let him go,&#8221; said Monkey, spitting.</P>
<P>&#8220;'Let him go, let him go,'&#8220; mocked Pig. &#8220;I bet our master spent last
 night having a go.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop arguing, you two,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;It's light now. We've got
 to capture that demon as quickly as we can.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you stay here and look after the horse.
 Don't move. Pig, come with me.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot braced himself, tightened the belt round his black cotton
 tunic and went with Monkey as each of them leapt up to the top of the
 car and arrived beneath the stone screen, weapon in hand. &#8220;You stand
 here,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'm afraid that the she-devil may have harmed the
 master during the night, so wait while I go in and find out. If he was
 seduced by her into losing his primal masculinity and ruining his
 virtue then we'll all split up. But if he kept his spirit firm and his
 dhyana heart was unmoved we'll have to hold out till we've killed the
 she-devil and rescued the master. Then we can head West.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Idiot!&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;As the saying goes, can a dried fish be a cat's
 pillow? Even if she didn't succeed she'll have had a good grab at him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop talking such nonsense,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'm going to have a
 look.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage took his leave of Pig and went round the rock
 screen. Then he shook himself, turned back into a bee, and flew inside,
 where he saw two serving girls sound asleep with their heads pillowed
 on their watch-keepers' clappers and gongs. When he reached the flower
 pavilion he found that the devils were still asleep, exhausted after
 being up half the night, and not aware that it was dawn. Monkey then
 flew on to the back of the cave, where he could half hear Sanzang's
 voice. He looked up to see the master with his hands and feet all roped
 together under the portico. Landing lightly on Sanzang's head he said,
 &#8220;Master.&#8221;</P>
<P>Recognizing his voice, Sanzang said, &#8220;Is that you, Wukong. Rescue
 me!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Did you have a good time last night?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I would have died first,&#8221; Sanzang replied through clenched teeth.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yesterday it looked to me that she was in love with you,&#8221; Monkey
 continued, &#8220;so why has she been torturing you like this?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;She pestered me for half the night,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;but I never
 undid my clothes or even touched the bed. She only tied me up and left
 me here when she saw that I was not going to give in to her. Whatever
 happens you must rescue me so that I can go and fetch the scriptures.&#8221;
 By now their conversation had woken the she-devil up. Ferocious though
 she was she still could not bear to lose Sanzang.</P>
<P>As she woke up and sat up she heard him saying &#8220;fetch the
 scriptures,&#8221; rolled straight out of bed, and shrieked, &#8220;What do you
 want to<I></I> go and fetch scriptures for instead of being my
 husband?&#8221;</P>
<P>This alarmed Monkey, who left the master, spread his wings, flew out,
 turned back into himself, and shouted for Pig. The idiot came round the
 stone screen and asked, &#8220;Well? Did it happen?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; laughed Monkey, &#8220;it didn't. She kept pawing him but he wouldn't
 go along with her, so she lost her temper and tied him up. Just when he
 was telling me what had happened the fiend woke up and I had to rush
 out in a panic.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What did the master say?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;He told me that he never undid his clothes,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and
 never even touched the bed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's wonderful,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;He's a true monk. Let's go and save
 him.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot was too crude to bother with arguing: he lifted his rake
 and brought it down with all his might against the doors, smashing them
 to pieces. This gave the serving girls who were asleep with their heads
 pillowed on their watch-keepers' clappers and gongs such a fright that
 they ran to the inner doors shouting, &#8220;Open up! The two ugly men who
 came here last night have smashed the front doors down.&#8221;</P>
<P>The she-devil was just coming out of her bedroom when four or five
 serving girls came rushing in to report, &#8220;Madam, the two ugly men who
 were here yesterday have come back and smashed the front doors down.&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing this the she-devil ordered, &#8220;Little ones, boil water at
 once for me to wash and comb my hair.&#8221; Then she told them, &#8220;Carry the
 emperor's brother roped up as he is and lock him up in the back room.
 I'm going out to fight them.&#8221;</P>
<P>Out went the splendid monster, brandishing her<I></I> trident and
 shouting abusively, &#8220;Vicious ape! Dirty hog! Ignorant beast! How dare
 you come knocking down my doors!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Filthy whore,&#8221; Pig retaliated, &#8220;you tie our master up and then you
 have the nerve to talk tough like that. You tried to seduce our master
 into being your husband. Give him back now and we'll spare your life.
 If there's so much as a hint of a 'no' from you this rake of mine will
 smash your whole mountain down.&#8221;</P>
<P>The demon did not allow any more argument but summoned up her spirits
 and used the same magic as before to breathe out smoke and fire as she
 thrust at Pig with her steel trident. Swerving aside to avoid the blow,
 Pig struck back with his rake. When Monkey joined in to help him with
 his cudgel the she-devil used more magic to give herself endless pairs
 of hands with which to parry their weapons to left and to right. When
 they had fought four or five rounds the mystery weapon jabbed Pig in
 the lip, making him flee for his life, dragging his rake behind him and
 pressing a hand to his mouth. Monkey, who was also rather scared of
 her, feinted with his cudgel and fled in defeat too. The she-devil went
 back into her cave in victory, telling her underlings to build up a
 temporary outer barrier with rocks.</P>
<P>Friar Sand heard piggish groans as he was pasturing the horse and
 looked up to see Pig coming towards him with his hand on his face and
 moaning. &#8220;What's up?&#8221; Friar Sand asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's terrible, terrible,&#8221; the idiot groaned, &#8220;the pain, the pain.&#8221;</P>
<P>He was still complaining when Monkey turned up too, saying with a
 grin, &#8220;Idiot! Yesterday you wished me a carbuncle on my forehead, and
 today you've got one on your lip.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I can't bear it,&#8221; groaned Pig, &#8220;it's agony, it's excruciating.&#8221;</P>
<P>Just as the three of them were at a loss as to what to do an old
 woman came by with a green bamboo basket carrying wild vegetables from
 the hills to the South. &#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand to Monkey, &#8220;that
 woman's coming this way. I'll ask her who this evil spirit is and what
 weapon she has that causes such terrible wounds.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You stay here while I go and ask her,&#8221; Monkey said, and taking a
 quick look he saw that there was a halo of auspicious cloud directly
 above the old woman's head, and that fragrant mists were all around
 her.</P>
<P>Recognizing who it was, Monkey called out, &#8220;Come and kowtow,
 brothers. This lady is the Bodhisattva.&#8221; This so surprised them that
 Pig kowtowed despite his pain, Friar Sand bowed low as he held the
 horse, and Monkey fell to his knees and called, &#8220;I submit to The
 Merciful and Compassionate Deliverer from Suffering, the Miraculously
 Responding Bodhisattva Guanyin.&#8221;</P>
<P>Seeing that they had recognized her, the Bodhisattva rose up into
 midair on her auspicious cloud and appeared in her true form as the
 carrier of the fish basket. Going up into the sky with her, Monkey
 kowtowed and reported, &#8220;Bodhisattva, please forgive your disciple for
 failing to come to meet you. Because we were so busy trying to save the
 master we did not realize that you had come to see us. We are now up
 against a monster we can't beat, and we beseech you, Bodhisattva, to
 help us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;She is indeed a very terrible monster,&#8221; the Bodhisattva replied.
 &#8220;Her trident is really the two claws she was born with, and what causes
 such agonizing wounds is a sting in her tail called 'horse-killer
 poison'. She was originally a scorpion spirit who used to listen to the
 Buddha preaching the scriptures on the Thunder Monastery. When the
 Tathagata Buddha saw her and mistakenly tried to push her away with his
 hand she used her tail to sting him on his left thumb. The Buddha in
 his pain told one of the vajrapanis to arrest her and she is now here.
 You will have to ask someone else for help as I too have to keep my
 distance from her.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey then bowed again and said, &#8220;I beg the Bodhisattva for further
 instructions. Please tell your disciple whom I should go to see to ask
 for help.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Go to the Palace of Light inside the Eastern Gate of Heaven and look
 for the Star Officer of the Pleiades. He will be able to subdue her.&#8221;
 Having spoken she turned into a beam of golden light and went straight
 back to the Southern Ocean.</P>
<P>The Great Sage Monkey then brought down his cloud and said to Pig and
 Friar Sand, &#8220;Don't worry, brothers. Our master has a star to save him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where?&#8221; Friar Sand asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The Bodhisattva has just told me to ask the help of the Star Officer
 of the Pleiades,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;I'm off.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; groaned Pig, his hand still on his mouth, &#8220;please ask the
 star lord for some ointment to stop this pain.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't need any ointment,&#8221; laughed Monkey. &#8220;After a night's pain
 it'll get better, just as mine did last night.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop all that talk,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;and get there as fast as you
 can.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Monkey set off at once on his somersault cloud and was
 outside the Eastern Gate of Heaven in an instant. The Heavenly King
 Virudhaka suddenly appeared to greet him courteously and ask, &#8220;Where
 are you going, Great Sage?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I want to go to the Palace of Light to see the Star Lord of the
 Pleiades because the Tang Priest I'm escorting to the West to fetch the
 scriptures is being pestered by a devil,&#8221; Monkey said. Then the four
 marshals Tao, Zhang, Xin and Deng appeared to ask Monkey where he was
 going.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm looking for the Star Officer of the Pleiades to subdue a demon
 and rescue my master,&#8221; he said.</P>
<P>To this they answered, &#8220;The star officer has gone on an inspection to
 the Star-viewing Tower today at the Jade Emperor's command.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Is that true?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;We left the Dipper and Bull Palace with him,&#8221; Heavenly Lord Xin
 said, &#8220;and we would not dare lie about it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He has been gone for a long time,&#8221; Heavenly Lord Tao said, &#8220;so he
 may be back by now. Great Sage, you would do best to go to the Palace
 of Light first, and if he is not back, go on to the Star-viewing
 Tower.&#8221;</P>
<P>This delighted the Great Sage, who took his leave of them and went to
 the gate of the Palace of Light. Finding that the star officer was
 indeed not there he was just about to leave when he noticed a column of
 soldiers outside. Behind them was the star lord returning in his court
 dress sewn with golden thread. This is how he looked:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Five Peak pins in his hat gleamed gold;</P>
<P>The mountain and river tablet he held was of the finest jade.</P>
<P>The Seven Stars hung from his waist amid clouds and mist;</P>
<P>Bright were the rings of jade on his Eight-pole sash.</P>
<P>His pendants chimed with a rhythmical sound;</P>
<P>The wind rushing past made a noise like bells.</P>
<P>The Star Officer of the Pleiades came holding his kingfisher fan;</P>
<P>While clouds of heavenly incense filled the hall.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the soldiers in the front ranks saw Monkey standing outside the
 Palace of Light they hurried back to report, &#8220;My lord, the Great Sage
 Sun is here.&#8221; The star officer put away his clouds and tidied his court
 dress, then when the attendants carrying his insignia of office stood
 aside to left and right he stepped forward to greet Monkey courteously
 and ask, &#8220;Why are you here, Great Sage?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have come especially to pay my respects and beg you to rescue my
 master from disaster,&#8221; Brother Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;What disaster, and where?&#8221; the star officer asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;He is in the Pipa Cave on Deadly Foe Mountain in Western Liang,&#8221;
 Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;What evil monster is there in the cave that you should need to send
 for me?&#8221; asked the star officer.</P>
<P>&#8220;The Bodhisattva Guanyin appeared to us just now,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;and
 told us that she is a scorpion spirit. She specially mentioned you,
 sir, as the only person who would be able to control her. That is why I
 have come here to ask your help.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I would have preferred to submit a memorial to the Jade Emperor,&#8221;
 the star officer replied, &#8220;but as you have come here, Great Sage, and
 as I am much obliged to the Bodhisattva for recommending me I would not
 like to lose any more time. Excuse me if I don't offer you tea: let's
 go down to subdue the demon. I can report back to His Majesty on my
 return.&#8221;</P>
<P>At that the Great Sage went out with the star officer through the
 Eastern Gate of Heaven and straight back to Western Liang. Seeing
 Deadly Foe Mountain not far off, Monkey Pointed to it and said, &#8220;That's
 the mountain.&#8221; The star lord brought his cloud down and went with
 Monkey to the slope in front of the stone screen.</P>
<P>&#8220;Get up, brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand to Pig on seeing them. &#8220;Brother
 Monkey is back with the star officer.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Forgive me,&#8221; said the idiot, his hand still pressed over his mouth,
 &#8220;forgive me, but I'm too ill to pay you all the courtesies.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But you are one who cultivates his conduct,&#8221; the star lord said.
 &#8220;How can you be ill?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The she-devil jabbed me in the lip when I was fighting her,&#8221; Pig
 replied, and it still hurts.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Come here,&#8221; said the star lord, &#8220;and I'll cure it for you.&#8221;</P>
<P>Only then did the idiot put his hands down as he groaned, &#8220;Please,
 please cure it for me. I'll pay you well when it's better.&#8221; The star
 lord then touched his lip and blew on it, at which the pain stopped. A
 delighted Pig went down on his knees and kowtowed to the star lord.
 &#8220;Wonderful, wonderful,&#8221; he said.</P>
<P>&#8220;Will you touch my head too?&#8221; asked Monkey with a smile.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why?&#8221; the star lord asked. &#8220;You weren't jabbed with the poison.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I was yesterday,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;and it only stopped hurting after
 last night. It's still rather numb and itchy and may be bad again when
 the weather turns overcast, which is why I would like you to cure it.&#8221;
 The star officer then touched and blew on his head too, thus removing
 the remaining poison and stopping the numbness and itching.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said a wrathful Pig, &#8220;let's go and fight that vicious
 creature.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; the star lord said, &#8220;you two call her out so that I can
 put her in her place.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey and Pig leapt up the slope and went round the stone screen
 once more. Yelling insults the idiot used his hands like picks and hit
 with his rake to clear a way through the wall of stones that had been
 built outside the mouth of the cave. Once through these outer defenses
 he struck again with his rake to smash the inner doors to sawdust,
 giving the little devils behind them such a shock that they ran inside
 to report, &#8220;Madam, those two hideous men have smashed the inner doors
 now.&#8221; The she-devil had just had the Tang Priest untied and sent for
 some vegetarian breakfast for him when she heard the inner doors being
 smashed. Leaping out of her flower pavilion she thrust at Pig with her
 trident. He parried with his rake while Monkey joined in the fight from
 the side. The she-devil went right up to them and was just going to use
 her vicious trick when the two of them, who now knew what she was
 about, turned and fled.</P>
<P>As soon as the two of them were round the rock Monkey shorted, &#8220;Where
 are you, star lord?&#8221; The star lord stood up at once on the mountainside
 in his original form as a giant rooster with twin combs. When he raised
 his head he was six or seven feet tall, and as soon as he crowed the
 monster reverted to her true appearance as a scorpion spirit the size
 of a pipa mandolin. When the star officer crowed again the monster's
 whole body crumbled in death. There is a poem as evidence that goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>With fancy combs and a tasseled neck,</P>
<P>Hard claws, long spurs and angry eyes,</P>
<P>Nobly he leaps, complete in all his powers,</P>
<P>Towering majestic as three times he cries.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He is no common fowl who by a cottage crows</P>
<P>But a star down from the sky in all his glory.</P>
<P>Vainly the vicious scorpion took a human form:</P>
<P>Revealed now as herself she ends her story.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Pig went forward and said, one foot planted on the monster's back,
 &#8220;Evil beast, You won't be able to use your horse-killer poison this
 time.&#8221; The monster did not move, whereupon the idiot pounded her to
 mincemeat with his rake. The star lord gathered his golden light around
 him once more and rode away on his cloud. Monkey, Pig and Friar Sand
 all raised their clasped hands to Heaven in thanks.</P>
<P>&#8220;We have put you to much trouble,&#8221; they said. &#8220;We shall go to your
 palace to thank you another day.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the three of them had finished expressing their gratitude they
 bot the luggage and the horse ready and went into the cave, where the
 young and old serving girls were kneeling on either side saying, &#8220;My
 lords, we are not evil spirits but women from Western Liang who were
 carried off by the evil spirit. Your master is sitting in the scented
 room at the back crying.&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing this Monkey took a very careful look around, and seeing
 that there were indeed no more devilish vapors he went round to the
 back and called, &#8220;Master!&#8221; The Tang Priest was very pleased indeed to
 see them all there.</P>
<P>&#8220;Good disciples,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I have put you to such a lot of trouble.
 What has happened to that woman?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That damned female was really a scorpion,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;Luckily the
 Bodhisattva Guanyin told us what to do. Brother Monkey went to the
 palaces of Heaven to ask the Star Lord of the Pleiades to come down and
 defeat the demon. I've beaten her to pulp. That's why we dared to come
 right inside to see you, Master.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Tang Priest thanked them deeply. They then looked for some
 meat-free rice and noodles and laid on a meal for themselves that they
 ate. The kidnapped women were all taken down the mountain and shown the
 way back home. Then they lit a firebrand and burned down all the
 buildings there before helping the Tang Priest back on his horse and
 continuing along the main road West. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>They cut themselves off from worldly connections,</P>
<P>Turning away from the lures of desire.</P>
<P>By pushing right back the ocean of gold,</P>
<P>In their minds and their hearts their awareness was higher.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know how many years were to pass before they finally won
 their true achievement, listen to the explanation in the next
 installment.</P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="1_0_57">Chapter 56</A></H3>
</I>
<P>The Spirit Goes Wild and Wipes Out the Bandits</P>
<P>The Way in Confusion Sends the Mind-Ape Away</P>
</B>
<P>As the poem goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The heart that is empty of all things is said to be pure,</P>
<P>In utter placidity not giving rise to a thought.</P>
<P>The ape and the horse must be tethered, not left to run wild;</P>
<P>The spirit must always be cautious, not seeking for glory.</P>
<P>Wake up to Three Vehicles, wipe out the Six Bandits,</P>
<P>And all human destinies then become clear.</P>
<P>Extinguish the evil of sex and rise to enjoy</P>
<P>The pleasures of paradise that can be found in the West.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story tells how Tang Sanzang bit on the bullet, straggled with
 all his powers to preserve the purity of his body and was rescued from
 the Pipa Cave when Monkey and the others killed the scorpion spirit.
 There is nothing to tell about the next stage of their journey, and it
 was soon summer again. What they saw was</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Fragrant winds carrying the scent of wild orchids,</P>
<P>New bamboo cool as the skies clear after rain;</P>
<P>No travelers to pick artemisia on the hillside,</P>
<P>And the fragrant flowers of cattails filling the streams.</P>
<P>Bees are bewitched by pomegranates' beauty,</P>
<P>While siskins delight in the willow trees' shade.</P>
<P>How can the wayfarers offer dumplings to Qu Yuan?</P>
<P>Dragon boats should be mourning his death in the river.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Master and disciples were just enjoying the early summer scenery as
 they spent the day of the Dragonboat Festival without being able to
 celebrate it when a high mountain rose in front of them to block their
 way forward. Sanzang reined in his horse and turned back to say, &#8220;Be
 careful, Wukong: I'm worried that there may be demons on that mountain
 ahead.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry, Master,&#8221; said Brother Monkey. &#8220;We are all faithful
 believers. I'm not scared of demons.&#8221; This reply pleased the venerable
 elder greatly, who</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Whipped on his noble charger,</P>
<P>Gave the dragon steed his head.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Before long they were above a rock-face on the mountain, and when
 they raised their heads to look around this is what they saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Cypress and pine that touch the azure heavens,</P>
<P>Creepers climbing up hazels on the cliffs.</P>
<P>A hundred thousand feet high,</P>
<P>A thousand sheer-cut strata.</P>
<P>A hundred thousand feet high are the towering pinnacles;</P>
<P>A thousand sheer-cut strata of the chasm's sides.</P>
<P>Mosses and liverwort cover damp rocks,</P>
<P>Locust and juniper form a great forest.</P>
<P>Deep in the forest</P>
<P>Birds are heard unseen,</P>
<P>Singing their songs with beautiful voices.</P>
<P>The water in the brook is a torrent of jade;</P>
<P>The fallen blooms by the path are piles of gold.</P>
<P>The mountain is steep,</P>
<P>The going is hard,</P>
<P>And hardly a pace is on level ground.</P>
<P>Foxes and David's deer come in twos;</P>
<P>White stage and black gibbons greet one in pairs.</P>
<P>The bowl of the tiger fills one with terror;</P>
<P>The call of the crane resounds through the sky.</P>
<P>Plum and red apricot provide one with food;</P>
<P>No names can be put to the many wild flowers.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After climbing the mountain slowly for a long time the four of them
 crossed the summit, and on the Western slopes they saw a stretch of
 level sunlit ground. Pig put on a great show of energy, telling Friar
 Sand to carry the luggage while he raised his rake in both hands and
 tried to drive the horse ahead. But the horse was not afraid of him and
 carried on at the same slow pace despite all the noises he made to
 speed it up.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why are you trying to make the horse go faster, brother?&#8221; Monkey
 asked. &#8220;Let it walk slowly at its own speed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's getting late,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;and I'm hungry after that day on
 the mountain. We'd better get a move on and find a house to beg some
 food from.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case let me speed him up,&#8221; said Monkey waving his
 gold-banded cudgel and shouting, at which the horse slipped its halter
 and started to gallop along the track with the speed of an arrow. Do
 you wonder why the horse was afraid of Monkey but not of Pig? It was
 because five hundred years earlier Monkey had been given a post in the
 Imperial Stables in the Daluo Heaven as Protector of the Horses; the
 name has been passed on right till the present day, which is why all
 horses are still afraid of monkeys. The venerable elder could not keep
 hold of the reins: he simply held tight to the saddle and gave the
 horse its head as it galloped six or seven miles towards some farm land
 before slowing down to a walk.</P>
<P>As Sanzang was riding along he heard a gong being struck as over
 thirty men armed with spears, swords and staves emerged from both sides
 of the track to block his way and say, &#8220;Where do you think you're
 going, monk?&#8221; This made the Tang Priest shake with fright so badly that
 he lost his seat and fell off the horse.</P>
<P>&#8220;Spare my life, Your Majesty,&#8221; he pleaded as he squatted in the
 undergrowth by the path, &#8220;Spare my life.&#8221;</P>
<P>The two chiefs of the gang then said, &#8220;We're not going to kill you.
 Just give us your money.&#8221; Only then did the venerable elder realize
 that they were bandits. As he raised his head to look at them this is
 what he saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>One's blue face and protruding fangs were worse than an evil god's:</P>
<P>The other's bulging eyes were like the Star of Death.</P>
<P>The red hair at their temples seemed ablaze;</P>
<P>Their brownish bristles were as sharp as needles.</P>
<P>Both wore berets of tiger skin.</P>
<P>And kilts of marten fur.</P>
<P>One carried a cudgel with wolf-tooth spikes,</P>
<P>The other a rope of knotted rattan.</P>
<P>They were no less terrible than mountain tigers,</P>
<P>And just as frightening as dragons from the waters.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On seeing how murderous they looked Sanzang could only rise to his
 feet, put his hands together before his chest, and say, &#8220;Your
 Majesties, I have been sent by the Tang emperor in the East to fetch
 the scriptures from the Western Heaven. It has been many years since I
 left Chang'an and all my travelling money was finished long ago. We
 monks may only support ourselves by begging&#8212;we don't have any money. I
 beg you, Your Majesties, to show charity and allow me to pass.&#8221; The two
 bandit chiefs led their men forward and said, &#8220;We here are tigers. The
 only reason we stop travelers on the main roads is to get rich. Charity
 doesn't come into it. If you've got no money, take your clothes off and
 give us that white horse, then we'll let you go on your way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Amitabha Buddha!&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;This habit of mine was begged piece
 by piece, a bit of cloth from one family and a needle from another. If
 you take it you will be killing me. If you act as tough guys in this
 life you'll be reborn as animals in the next.&#8221;</P>
<P>One of the bandit chiefs was so infuriated by this remark that he
 started to wave his cudgel about and went up to Sanzang to strike him.
 Unable to speak, Sanzang could only think, &#8220;Poor man, you may think
 you've got a cudgel: wait till you find out about my disciple's.&#8221; The
 bandit was in no mood for argument as he raised his cudgel and started
 to lay about Sanzang. Sanzang, who in all his life had never told a
 lie, in this desperate crisis had to make one up now: &#8220;Don't hit me,
 Your Majesties. I have a young disciple following behind me who'll be
 here soon. He has several ounces of silver that he'll give to you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't hurt the monk,&#8221; said one of the bandit chiefs. &#8220;Tie him up.&#8221;
 The crowd of bandits then fell upon him, roped him up, and suspended
 him high from a tree.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The three disaster-bringing spirits were still following behind. Pig
 was chuckling aloud as he said, &#8220;The master's been going very fast. I
 don't know where he's waiting for us.&#8221; Then he saw Sanzang in the tree
 and said, &#8220;Just look at the master, He could have just waited if he'd
 wanted to, but he was in such high spirits he had to climb a tree and
 make a swing out of creepers.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop talking nonsense,&#8221; said Monkey when he saw what had happened.
 &#8220;The master's been hung up there, hasn't he? You two wait for a moment
 while I go up and look around.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage then rushed up the slope to look around and
 saw the bandits. &#8220;I'm in luck,&#8221; he thought with glee, &#8220;I'm in luck.
 Business has brought itself to my front door.&#8221; With that he turned
 round, shook himself, and turned into a trim little novice of only
 sixteen wearing a black habit and carrying a bundle wrapped in blue
 cotton cloth on his shoulder. Then he stepped out until he was by the
 master and called, &#8220;Master, what's been happening? Who are these wicked
 people?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Rescue me, disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;and stop asking so many
 questions.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What's it all about?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;These highwaymen blocked my way and demanded money,&#8221; Sanzang
 replied. &#8220;As I don't have any they hung me up here. I'm waiting for you
 to work something out. If you can't you'll just have to give them the
 horse.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're hopeless, Master,&#8221; laughed Monkey. &#8220;Of all the monks in the
 world there can be few as soft as you. When the Tang Emperor Taizong
 sent you to worship the Buddha in the Western Heaven he never told you
 to give that dragon horse away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Whatever was I to do when they hung me up here and were hitting me
 as they demanded things?&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;What did you say to them?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I was so desperate when they beat me that I had no choice: I had to
 tell them about you,&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you're useless. Why ever did you squeal on
 me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I told them that you were carrying some money,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;I
 only did it in desperation to stop them beating me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Great,&#8221; said Brother Monkey, &#8220;great. Thanks for the recommendation.
 That just how to squeal on me. You can do that seventy or eighty times
 a month if you like, and I'll do more business than ever.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the bandits saw Monkey talking to his master they spread out to
 surround them and said, &#8220;Little monk, get out the money your master
 told us you're carrying inside your belt and we'll spare your life. But
 if you even try to say no, you're dead.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't shout, gentlemen,&#8221; said Monkey, putting his bundle down. &#8220;I've
 got some money in here, but not much&#8212;only twenty horseshoe ingots of
 gold and twenty or thirty ingots of frosted silver, not counting the
 smaller pieces. If you want it I'll get the whole packet out as long as
 you don't hit my master. As the ancient book has it, 'Virtue is the
 root, and wealth is only the tip of the branch'. This is just the tip
 of the branch. We men of religion can always find a place to beg. When
 we meet a benefactor who feeds monks there'll be plenty of money and
 clothes for us. We don't need much at all. As soon as you've let my
 master down I'll give you it all.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the bandits heard this they were delighted, and they all said,
 &#8220;The old monk is stingy, but this little monk is very generous. Let him
 down.&#8221; Now that his life had been spared the venerable elder leapt on
 the horse and galloped back the way he had come, making good use of the
 whip and not giving Monkey another thought.</P>
<P>&#8220;You've gone the wrong way,&#8221; Monkey called out in alarm, then picked
 up his bundle and started to run after him, only to find his way
 blocked by the bandits.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where do you think you're going?&#8221; they asked. &#8220;Give us your money or
 we'll have to torture you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Now we're on that subject,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;we'll have to split the
 money three ways.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're a bit of a rascal, aren't you, little monk?&#8221; said one of the
 bandit chiefs. &#8220;You want to keep something without letting your master
 know. All right then. Bring it all out and we'll have a look at it. If
 there's a lot we'll let you keep a bit to buy fruit with on the side.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's not what I mean at all, brother,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I haven't got
 any money. What I mean is that you've got to give me a cut of the gold
 and silver you two have stolen from other people.&#8221;</P>
<P>This infuriated the bandit chief, who shouted abusively, &#8220;You're
 asking for it, little monk. Wanting ours instead of giving us yours!
 Stay where you are and take this.&#8221; He lifted his knotted rattan cane
 and brought it down on Monkey's head six or seven times.</P>
<P>Monkey pretended not to notice, and his face was wreathed in smiles
 as he said, &#8220;Brother, if you can only hit me like that you could still
 be hitting me at the end of next spring and you wouldn't really have
 hit me at all.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You have a very hard head,&#8221; exclaimed the shocked bandit.</P>
<P>&#8220;No, no, you overpraise me: I just get by with it,&#8221; Monkey replied.
 With that the discussion was cut short as two or three of the bandits
 rushed at Monkey and started lashing out at him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Keep your tempers, gentlemen,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;while I get it out.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage then felt in his ear and pulled out an
 embroidery needle. &#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we monks really don't carry
 money with us. All I can give you is this needle.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What lousy luck,&#8221; said one of the bandits. &#8220;We've let the rich monk
 go and kept this bald donkey who's not got a penny to his name. I
 suppose you do tailoring. A needle's no use to us.&#8221; On hearing that
 they did not want it Monkey held the needle in<I></I> his hand, waved
 it, and turned it into a cudgel as thick as a rice bowl.</P>
<P>&#8220;Young you may be, little monk,&#8221; said the terrified bandits, &#8220;but you
 certainly have some magical powers.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey then thrust the cudgel into the ground and said, &#8220;If any of
 you gentlemen can move it it's yours.&#8221; The two bandit chiefs rushed up
 to grab it, but they could no more move it than a dragonfly can move a
 stone pillar: it did not shift a fraction of an inch. How could those
 bandits have known that the gold-banded As-You-Will cudgel had been
 weighed on the scales of Heaven at 13,500 pounds? Then Monkey stepped
 forward, lifted it effortlessly, spun it in a writhing python movement,
 pointed it at the robbers and said, &#8220;You're all out of luck: you've met
 Monkey.&#8221;</P>
<P>The bandit chief rushed at him again and hit him another fifty or
 sixty times. &#8220;Your hands must be getting tired,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Let me
 hit you one now, but don't think this is the real thing.&#8221; Watch him as
 he swings his cudgel, shakes it, and makes it as thick as the top of a
 well and seventy or eighty feet long. A single blow of it struck one
 bandit chief to the ground. He bit the dust and said no more.</P>
<P>&#8220;You're pretty cheek there, baldy,&#8221; said the other bandit chief
 abusively. &#8220;You've got no money, and now you've killed one of us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Just a moment,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile. &#8220;I'm going to kill every
 one of you and wipe you all out.&#8221; With another swing of his cudgel he
 killed the other bandit chief, at which all their men threw down their
 spears and clubs and scattered in terror, fleeing for their lives.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Tang Priest galloped Eastwards until Pig and Friar Sand stopped
 him and asked, &#8220;Where are you going, Master? This is the wrong way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciples,&#8221; said Sanzang, reining in his horse, &#8220;go back and tell
 your brother to be merciful with that cudgel of his and not kill all
 the bandits.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop here, Master,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;I'll go.&#8221; The idiot ran straight back
 along the path, shouting at the top of his voice, &#8220;Brother, the master
 says you're not to kill them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Have I killed anyone?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where have the bandits all gone?&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;They've all run away
 apart from the two chiefs. They're asleep here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You pox-ridden pair,&#8221; said Pig, addressing them, &#8220;no doubt you had a
 hard night of it and were so exhausted that you had to choose this of
 all places to sleep.&#8221; Walking closer to them he went on, &#8220;You're like
 me: you sleep with your mouths open and dribble.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's because I smashed the beancurd out of them with my cudgel,&#8221;
 said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;But people don't have beancurd in their heads,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;I beat their brains out,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>The moment he heard Monkey say that the idiot turned and rushed
 straight back to say to the Tang Priest, &#8220;He's scattered them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Splendid, splendid,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;Which way did they go?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He hit them so hard he laid them out,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;They can't go
 anywhere.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Then what do you mean by scattering them?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;He killed them,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;If that isn't scattering their band,
 what else is it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How did he hit them?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;He hit two big holes in their heads,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;Open the bundle,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;Take out a few coins, and buy some
 ointment somewhere to put on their wounds.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're not being at all sensible, Master,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;There's only
 any point in putting ointment on the wounds of people who are still
 alive. Why put it on gaping holes in people who are already dead?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Has he really killed them?&#8221; said Sanzang, losing his temper and
 beginning to mutter abusive remarks about monkeys and macaques as he
 turned the horse round and rode back with Friar Sand and Pig to where
 the dead men lay covered with gore, their heads pointing down the
 mountainside.</P>
<P>The sight was too much for the venerable elder. &#8220;Dig a grave for them
 with your rake and bury them,&#8221; he told Pig, &#8220;while I say the<I> Burial
 Sutra</I> for them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're giving the job to the wrong man, Master,&#8221; complained Pig.
 &#8220;Monkey killed them, so Monkey ought to bury them. Why make me do the
 digging?&#8221;</P>
<P>Brother Monkey, who was already in a very bad mood after being told
 off by the master, shouted at Pig, &#8220;Hooligan! Moron! Bury them at once.
 I'll hit you if you waste any more time.&#8221; This so alarmed the idiot
 that he started digging with his rake. When he was three feet down he
 came to a layer of stones that the prongs of his rake could not shift,
 so he threw the rake aside and rooted about with his snout. In the
 softer earth he could get two and a half feet down with one push and
 five feet with two. He then buried the two bodies and piled up a
 tombmound above them.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;fetch some incense and candles so that I can
 pray for them and recite sutras.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You understand nothing,&#8221; Monkey retorted, pouting. &#8220;We're in the
 middle of the mountains with no village or inn for miles around. Where
 do you expect me to get candles and incense? There's nowhere I could
 buy them even if I had the money.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Out of my way, ape,&#8221; said Sanzang with fury, &#8220;I am going to scatter
 earth on the tomb, burn incense and pray.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sanzang dismounted sadly by the tomb in the wild;</P>
<P>The holy monk prayed by the desolate grave.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>These were the words of his invocation:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I bow to you tough guys and ask you to hear my prayer. I am from the
 land of Tang in the East. At the command of Emperor Taizong I was going
 to the West to fetch the scriptures when I met you gentlemen here. I do
 not know what province, prefecture and county you came from to form
 your band in the mountains here. I spoke to you kindly and pleaded
 earnestly, but you paid no heed as you repaid good with wrath. Then you
 encountered Sun the Novice, who killed you with his cudgel. Out of
 consideration for your bodies left lying in the open I had them buried
 and a mound piled over them. I broke off some bamboo to serve instead
 of incense and candles; although they give no light, they come from a
 sincere heart. Only stones can I offer in place of food: they have no
 flavor, but they are given in honest faith. When you reach the
 Underworld to lodge your complaint and look for the roots of your
 misfortune, remember that his surname is Sun and mine is Chen: they are
 different. Know who it was who wronged you, just as you would know a
 debtor, and do not bring a case against the monk who is going to fetch
 the scriptures.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've shuffled off all the blame,&#8221; said Pig with a laugh. &#8220;We two
 weren't there either when Monkey killed them.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang then picked up another pinch of earth and prayed again.
 &#8220;Tough guys, when you bring your case you must only indict Sun the
 Novice. It was nothing to do with Pig or Friar Sand.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he could not help laughing as he replied,
 &#8220;Master, you've got no finer feelings at all. Goodness knows what
 efforts I've been to so that you can fetch your scriptures, but now
 that I've killed those two bandits you tell them to go and bring a case
 against me. It's true that I did kill them, but it was only for you. If
 you hadn't set out to fetch the scriptures and I hadn't become your
 disciple I'd never have come here and killed them. I'm damned if I
 don't invoke them, too.&#8221;</P>
<P>He took his iron cudgel, pounded the grave three times, and said,
 &#8220;Listen to me, pox-ridden bandits. You hit me seven or eight times,
 then seven or eight times again; you didn't hurt me or even tickle me
 at all, but you did make me lose my temper. One misunderstanding led to
 another and I killed you. You can bring a case against me wherever you
 like&#8212;I'm not scared. The Jade Emperor knows me. The Heavenly Kings do
 as I say. The Twenty-eight Constellations are afraid of me. The Nine
 Bright Shiners, the star lords, are scared of me. The city gods of
 counties and prefectures kneel to me; the God of the Eastern Peak Who
 Is Equal to Heaven is terrified of me. The Ten Kings of the Underworld
 used to be my servants. The Five Fierce Gods were once my juniors. The
 five Commanders of the Three Worlds and the Officers of the Ten
 Directions are all my very good friends. So go and bring your case
 wherever you like.&#8221;</P>
<P>Hearing Monkey speak in this most unpleasant way was another shock
 for Sanzang. &#8220;Disciple,&#8221; he said, &#8220;my prayer was only intended to teach
 you to spare life and become good and kind. Why do you have to take
 this all so seriously?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is not something to fool around with, Master,&#8221; Monkey replied.
 &#8220;We must find somewhere for the night as soon as we can.&#8221; The master
 had no choice but to hold in his anger and remount.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>With the Great Sage Sun feeling disgruntled and Pig and Friar Sand
 also suffering from jealousy, master and disciples were only getting on
 together on the surface: underneath there was hostility. As they
 carried along their road Westwards a farmhouse came into sight to the
 North of the track. Pointing at it with the whip Sanzang told them that
 this was the place where they would find somewhere to spend the night.</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Pig, and they went up to the farm to look at it. It
 was a fine sight:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Wild flowers on the paths,</P>
<P>Trees shading the doorways.</P>
<P>A mountain stream fell down a distant cliff;</P>
<P>Wheat and mallows grew in the fields.</P>
<P>The reeds moistened by dew were beds for the gulls;</P>
<P>Poplars in the wind were perches for weary birds.</P>
<P>Among blue cypress the pine's green was a rival;</P>
<P>Red rush competed with knotweed in fragrance.</P>
<P>Village dogs barked,</P>
<P>The cocks crowed at dusk,</P>
<P>Well-fed cattle and sheep were led back by boys.</P>
<P>Under clouds of smoke from the stoves the millet was cooked;</P>
<P>Now it was evening in the hill farm.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As the venerable elder went closer an old man came out through the
 gateway of the farm, noticed Sanzang, and greeted him. &#8220;Where have you
 come from, monk?&#8221; he asked, to which Sanzang replied, &#8220;I have been sent
 from the Great Tang in the East to fetch the scriptures from the
 Western Heaven. As I am passing this way and it is getting late I have
 come to beg a night's lodging from you, benefactor.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It is a very long way indeed from your distinguished country to
 here,&#8221; the old man replied with a smile, &#8220;so how did you manage to
 cross so many rivers and climb so many mountains to get here by
 yourself?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have three disciples who have come with me,&#8221; Sanzang said. &#8220;Where
 are they?&#8221; the old man asked. &#8220;There they are, standing by the road,&#8221;
 said Sanzang.</P>
<P>The old man looked up and was so appalled by their hideous faces that
 on the instant he turned to run back inside, only to be held back by
 Sanzang, who said, &#8220;Benefactor, I beg you in your mercy to let us spend
 the night here.&#8221;</P>
<P>The old man was shivering, barely able to open his mouth, shaking his
 head and waving his arms around as he said, &#8220;Th...th... th...they're
 not human. They're e...e...evil spirits.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be afraid, benefactor,&#8221; said Sanzang, putting on a smile.
 &#8220;They just grew ugly. They're not evil spirits.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But my lord,&#8221; said the old man, &#8220;one's raksha demon, one's a
 horse-faced devil, and one's a thunder god.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this last remark he shouted at the top of his
 voice, &#8220;The thunder gods are my grandsons, the rakshas are my
 great-grandsons, and the horse-faced devils are my
 great-great-grandsons.&#8221;</P>
<P>This sent the old man's souls flying as he paled and wanted to go in.
 Sanzang held him up as they went into the thatched main room of the
 house, and said with a forced smile, &#8220;Don't be afraid of him. They are
 all rough like that. They don't know how to speak properly.&#8221;</P>
<P>As he was making his explanations a woman came out from the back
 holding a child of four or five by the hand. &#8220;What has given you such a
 fright, sir?&#8221; she asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Bring some tea, wife,&#8221; he said, and the woman let go of the child's
 hand and fetched two cups of tea from the inside. When the tea had been
 drunk Sanzang stepped down from his seat to greet her and explain, &#8220;I
 have been sent by Great Tang in the East to fetch the scriptures from
 the Western Heaven. I had just arrived here and was asking for a
 night's lodging in your distinguished mansion when the sight of my
 three disciples' ugly faces gave the old gentleman rather a fright.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If the sight of ugly faces gives you such a scare how would you cope
 if you saw a tiger or a wolf?&#8221; the woman said.</P>
<P>&#8220;Their ugliness I could take, wife,&#8221; the old man replied. &#8220;What
 terrified me was the way they spoke. When I said they were like a
 raksha, a horse-faced devil and a thunder god one of them shouted that
 thunder gods were his grandsons, rakshas his great-grandsons, and
 horse-faced devils his great-great-grandsons. That was what really
 terrified me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No need to be frightened,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;no need. The one like a
 thunder god is my senior disciple Sun Wukong. The one like a
 horse-faced devil is my second disciple Zhu Wuneng, or Pig. And the one
 like a raksha is my third disciple Sha Wujing, or Friar Sand. Although
 they are ugly they are all faithful Buddhists who believe in the true
 achievement. They are not evil monsters or vicious demons. They are
 nothing to be afraid of.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the old man and his wife heard who Sanzang was and were told
 that the disciples were all devout Buddhists their nerves were finally
 somewhat calmed, and they told Sanzang to invite them in. The venerable
 elder went to the door to call them over, then told them, &#8220;The old
 gentleman was really appalled by the sight of you just now. When you go
 in to see him now you must all be on your best behavior and be very
 polite to him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm handsome and cultured,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;not rough and noisy like my
 brothers,&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If it weren't for your long snout, big ears and ugly face you'd be a
 very good-looking man,&#8221; laughed Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop quarrelling,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;This is hardly the place for a
 beauty contest. Get inside!&#8221;</P>
<P>With that they carried the luggage and led the horse in, entered the
 main room, made a respectful call of greeting, and sat down. The good
 and able wife took the child out and gave orders for rice to be cooked
 and a vegetarian meal prepared. When master and disciples had eaten it
 the night was drawing in, so a lamp was fetched and they sat talking in
 the main room. Only then did Sanzang ask his host's surname.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yang,&#8221; the old man replied, and on being asked his age said he was
 seventy-three.</P>
<P>&#8220;How many sons do you have?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Only one,&#8221; the old man replied. &#8220;It was my grandson that my wife
 brought in just now.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Won't you ask your son in? I would like to greet him,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;He's not worth your courtesy, the wretch,&#8221; the old man replied. &#8220;I
 was fated to raise a worthless son, and he isn't at home now.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where does he make his living?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>The old man nodded and sighed as he replied, &#8220;It's sad story. I would
 be very happy if he were willing to make an honest living, but his mind
 is set on evil and he won't work at farming. All he wants to do is to
 rob houses, hold up travelers, burn and kill. His cronies are all worse
 than foxes and dogs. He went away five days ago and he hasn't come
 back.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang did not dare to breathe a word when he heard this, but he
 thought, &#8220;Perhaps he was one of the ones Wukong killed.&#8221; Feeling very
 uneasy, he bowed as he sat there. &#8220;Oh dear,&#8221; he said, &#8220;oh dear. How
 could such good parents have so wicked a son?&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey went up to the old man and said, &#8220;What do you want a rotten
 son like that for? He's a murderer and a rapist, and he'll get both of
 you into trouble too. Let me find him and kill him for you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I wish I could be rid of him,&#8221; said the old man, &#8220;but if I did I
 have no other son. Evil though he is I'll need him to bury me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop meddling in things that are none of your business, brother,&#8221;
 said Friar Sand and Pig. &#8220;We're not the government. What's it to us if
 his son's a bad lot? Benefactor, could you give us a bundle of straw to
 spread out and sleep on over there? We'll be on our way tomorrow
 morning.&#8221; The old man rose to his feet and sent Friar Sand to take two
 bundles of rice straw to the yard at the back, where they were to spend
 the night in a thatched shed. Monkey led the horse and Pig carried the
 luggage as they took their master to the shed and slept the night
 there, where we shall leave them.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Now old Mr. Yang's son was indeed one of the bandits who had fled for
 their lives after Monkey killed their two chiefs on the mountainside
 the previous morning. Late that night, in the small hours, a group of
 them gathered together again and knocked at the front gate. Hearing the
 noise the old man pulled some clothes over his shoulders and said,
 &#8220;Wife, those damned bandits are here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Then open the gate and let them in,&#8221; she replied. Only then did he
 open up, and what he saw was a crowd of bandits shouting, &#8220;We're
 starving, we're staving.&#8221; Old Mr. Yang's son rushed in, and made his
 wife get up to cook some rice. As there was no firewood in the kitchen
 he went into the yard to fetch some.</P>
<P>Back in the kitchen he asked his wife, &#8220;Where did the white horse in
 the yard come from?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There are some monks from the East who are going to get scriptures,&#8221;
 she replied. &#8220;They asked to stay here last night. Your parents treated
 them to supper and put them up in the thatched shed.&#8221;</P>
<P>The news made the bandit clap his hands with glee as he came out of
 the hall saying, &#8220;What a piece of luck, brothers, what a piece of luck.
 Our enemies are right here in my own home.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What enemies?&#8221; the others all asked.</P>
<P>:The monks who killed our chiefs came here for the night,&#8221; he
 replied, &#8220;and they're asleep in the shed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Lovely,&#8221; said the other bandits. &#8220;Let's get those bald-headed
 donkeys. We can chop them all up and pickle them in soy sauce. We'll
 have their things and their horse and be avenging the chiefs into the
 bargain.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Take it easy,&#8221; said Yang the bandit. &#8220;You lot go and sharpen your
 swords while we cook the rice. Let's all have a good feed before we do
 them in.&#8221; Whereupon the bandits sharpened their swords and their
 spears.</P>
<P>The old man had heard all this, so he crept stealthily round to the
 back to tell the Tang Priest and his disciples, &#8220;That evil son of mine
 has brought the gang here. They know you're here and they want to
 murder you. Knowing how far you've come I couldn't bear to see you
 murdered, so please pack your bags as fast as you can. I'll let you out
 through the back gate.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang, now shivering with fright, kowtowed to the old man in thanks
 then told Pig to lead the horse while Friar Sand shouldered the
 carrying pole and Monkey took the nine-ringed monastic staff. The old
 man opened the back gate to let them out then made his way quietly back
 to the front to go to bed.</P>
<P>By the time the bandits had sharpened their weapons and eaten a good
 meal it was the fifth watch and almost dawn. They crowded into the
 backyard to find their intended victims gone. Quickly lighting lamps
 and fires they made a long search but could find no traces of them
 anywhere except that the back gate was open. &#8220;They've got away out the
 back,&#8221; they all exclaimed. &#8220;After them! Catch them!&#8221;</P>
<P>They all rushed along as fast as arrows, and when the sun rose in the
 East they finally saw Sanzang, who looked back when he heard shouts and
 saw a crowd of twenty or thirty men armed with spears and swords coming
 after him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciples,&#8221; he called, &#8220;the bandits have caught up with us. Whatever
 shall we do?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'll finish them off.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said Sanzang, reining in his horse, &#8220;you're not to hurt
 them. Just scare them off.&#8221;</P>
<P>Not a blind bit of notice did Monkey take of this as he swung his
 cudgel and turned to face them. &#8220;Where do you gentlemen think you're
 going?&#8221; he asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Bloody baldies,&#8221; they shouted back abusively, ringing Monkey in a
 circle, &#8220;give us back our chiefs.&#8221; When they started thrusting and
 hacking at him with their spears and swords the Great Sage whirled his
 cudgel once around, made it as thick as a ricebowl, and scattered the
 lot of them. Those who took the full impact of it were killed outright;
 glancing blows broke bones, and even a touch left an open wound. A few
 of the nimbler ones managed a getaway, but the slower ones all had to
 pay their respects to King Yama in the Underworld.</P>
<P>At the sight of so many people being struck down a panic-stricken
 Sanzang made his horse gallop West as fast as it could, with Pig and
 Friar Sand rushing along beside. &#8220;Which of you is old Yang's boy?&#8221;
 Monkey asked the wounded bandits who were still alive.</P>
<P>&#8220;The one in yellow, my lord,&#8221; they groaned.</P>
<P>Monkey went over, took his sword from him, and sliced off his head.
 Holding the gory head in his hand he put his cudgel away and caught up
 with the Tang Priest by cloud. &#8220;Master,&#8221; he said, waving the head in
 front of the horse, &#8220;here's the head of old Yang's wicked son.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang, pale with horror, fell out of the saddle. &#8220;Evil macaque,&#8221; he
 said, &#8220;you will be the death of me, terrifying me like that. Take it
 away at once.&#8221; Pig kicked the head to the side of the path and buried
 it with his rake.</P>
<P>&#8220;Do get up, Master,&#8221; said Friar Sand, putting down the carrying pole
 and supporting the Tang Priest. Pulling himself together as he sat
 there on the ground the venerable elder started to recite the
 Band-tightening Spell. Monkey's skull was squeezed so tight that his
 face and ears turned bright red, his eyes bulged and his head ached.
 &#8220;Stop! Stop!&#8221; he pleaded, rolling around in agony, but even when
 Sanzang had said it a dozen times or more he still carried on.</P>
<P>In his unbearable agony Monkey turned somersaults and stood on his
 head, screaming, &#8220;Forgive me, Master. Say what you have to say. Stop,
 stop!&#8221; Only then did Sanzang stop reciting the spell.</P>
<P>&#8220;I've nothing to say to you,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I don't want you with me
 any more. Go back.&#8221; Kowtowing despite his pain, Monkey asked, &#8220;Master,
 why are you sending me away?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wicked ape,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;you're too much of a murderer to fetch
 scriptures. I gave it to you yesterday for your cruelty in killing the
 two bandit chiefs on the mountainside. When we reached the old
 gentleman's house late yesterday evening he gave us a meal and a
 night's lodging, and we only got away with our lives because he helped
 us to escape through the back gate. Even though his son was a bad lot
 that was none of our business, and it was wrong of you to cut off his
 head, to say nothing of all the other lives you destroyed. Goodness
 knows how much you have damaged the harmony of heaven and earth.
 Despite my repeated advice there is not a shred of goodness in you. I
 do not need yon at all. Clear off at once if you don't want me to say
 the spell again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't say it, don't say it,&#8221; pleaded Monkey in terror, &#8220;I'm going.&#8221;
 No sooner had the words left his mouth than he disappeared without a
 trace on his somersault cloud. Alas!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the mind is full of murder,</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cinnabar cannot be treated.</P>
<P>If the spirit is in disorder,</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Way stays uncompleted.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know where the Great Sage had gone listen to the
 explanation in the next installment.</P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="1_0_58">Chapter 57</A></H3>
</I>
<P>The True Sun Wukong Makes His Complaint at Potaraka</P>
<P>The False Monkey King Copies a Document in the Water Curtain Cave</P>
</B>
<P>Angry and depressed, the Great Sage Sun rose up into the air. There
 were many places he would have liked to go to but could not. In the
 Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit he was afraid
 of being teased for coming back so soon after he had gone, not like a
 real man. He did not think he would be allowed to stay long in the
 palaces of Heaven; he could not face the immortals in the three magic
 islands in the sea; and he could not bring himself to beg for the help
 of the dragon king in his dragon palace. He had nobody to turn to.</P>
<P>&#8220;There's nothing for it,&#8221; he thought bitterly. &#8220;I'll just have to go
 back to the master and pursue the true achievement.&#8221;</P>
<P>He then brought his cloud straight down to stand in front of the Tang
 Priest's horse and say, &#8220;Please forgive me this time, Master. I'll
 never commit another murder, and I'll do every thing you tell me. You
 must, must let me escort you to the Western Heaven.&#8221; The moment the
 Tang Priest saw him he reined in the horse. His only reply was to start
 reciting the Band-tightening Spell, which he did over and over again
 more than twenty times, not stopping until Monkey lay weeping on the
 ground, the band sunk a good inch into his head.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why haven't you gone back? Why are you still bothering me?&#8221; Sanzang
 asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't say it again,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;don't! I've got places I can
 live, but I'm afraid you'll never reach the Western Heaven without me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You are a brutal murderer, you macaque,&#8221; Sanzang angrily burst out.
 &#8220;You have got me into a lot of trouble on your account. I want nothing
 more to do with you. Whether I get there or not is nothing to do with
 you. Go at once. One more moment's delay and I'll say the spell again,
 and I won't stop till your brains have all been squeezed out.&#8221; In
 unbearable pain, and seeing that the master would not change his mind,
 Monkey had no choice. Once again he shot up into the air on his
 somersault cloud, and this time he had a sudden inspiration.</P>
<P>&#8220;That monk has let me down,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;I'm off to Potaraka to
 lodge a complaint with the Bodhisattva Guanyin.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Monkey set off once more on his somersault cloud and in
 less than two hours he was at the Southern Ocean. He stopped his
 auspicious cloud and then straight to Potaraka.</P>
<P>Sun Wukong charged in to the Purple Bamboo Grove where Moksa the
 Novice appeared to greet him politely and ask, &#8220;Where are you going,
 Great Sage?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I would like to see the Bodhisattva,&#8221; he replied. Moksa then led him
 to the mouth of the Tide Cave, where the page Sudhana bowed and asked,
 &#8220;Why are you here, Great, Sage?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I want to lay a complaint before the Bodhisattva,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>At the word &#8220;complaint&#8221; Sudhana said with a smile, &#8220;What an evil
 tongue you have, you ape. It's just like when you tricked me after I
 caught the Tang Priest. Our Bodhisattva is an infinitely holy and good
 Bodhisattva who in her great mercy and compassion has made a vow to use
 the Great Vehicle to save all suffering beings. What could she have
 done wrong for you to complain about?&#8221;</P>
<P>At this Monkey, who was already in thoroughly bad spirits, exploded
 with fury. He gave a shout that made Sudhana fall back: &#8220;Ungrateful
 little beast! Stupid fool! You used to be a monster-spirit till I asked
 the Bodhisattva to win you over and convert you. Now you're living in
 eternal bliss and freedom, and you'll go on doing so as long as the
 heavens last. You ought to be bowing low to thank me instead of being
 so thoroughly insulting. I come here with a complaint to lay before the
 Bodhisattva, and you accuse me of having an evil tongue and complaining
 about her.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I see you're as hot-tempered a monkey as ever,&#8221; said Sudhana. &#8220;I was
 only teasing: no need to turn nasty.&#8221;</P>
<P>As they were talking the white parrot came and flew around them,
 which they recognized as a summons from the Bodhisattva. Moksa and
 Sudhana then led Monkey in to her lotus throne, where he kowtowed to
 her, howling aloud as the tears streamed down his cheeks. Telling Moksa
 and Sudhana to help Monkey to his feet, the Bodhisattva said, &#8220;Wukong,
 tell me straight out what it is that is upsetting you so. Don't cry: I
 shall deliver you from your troubles.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've never been treated this badly in the whole of my life,&#8221; said a
 tearful Monkey, continuing to kowtow to her. &#8220;Ever since you saved me
 from the disaster sent by Heaven I've been a faithful Buddhist and
 protected the Tang Priest on his way to the Western Heaven to worship
 the Buddha and fetch the scriptures. I've risked my skin to rescue him
 from demons, even though it's been like taking crunchy bones out of a
 tiger's mouth, or lifting the scales on a dragon's back. I've been
 trying so hard to win a true reward and wipe out my past sins. I never
 thought that the master would be so ungrateful that he'd ruin my
 chances of a good destiny because he couldn't tell right from wrong.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Explain what you mean by not telling right from wrong,&#8221; said the
 Bodhisattva, and Monkey told her all the details of how the bandits had
 been killed, and of how in his anger at so much slaughter the Tang
 Priest had said the Band-tightening Spell many times over without going
 into the rights and wrongs of the case then repeatedly sent him away.
 He said he had come to her because he had no way of getting up to
 heaven or into the earth.</P>
<P>&#8220;The Tang Priest is travelling West on his emperor's orders,&#8221; said
 the Bodhisattva, &#8220;and would not allow anyone to be killed for no good
 reason. He is a monk whose heart is set on kindness. Why did someone of
 your tremendous powers need to bother with killing so many small-time
 bandits? Bandits like that are bad, but they're human and it's wrong to
 kill them. It's not the same as with evil beasts, demons and spirits.
 Killing them is a good deed. Killing those men was cruel. You could
 have saved your master by just making them run away. In my impartial
 judgement it was wicked of you to kill them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Even if I was wicked,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;I ought to be allowed to redeem
 it by doing good. He was wrong to sent me away like that. I beg you in
 your mercy, Bodhisattva, say the Band-loosening Spell and take it off.
 I'll give the band back to you and go and live in the Water Curtain
 Cave.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The Tathagata Buddha taught me the Band-tightening Spell,&#8221; the
 Bodhisattva replied. &#8220;He gave me three treasures when I was sent to the
 East to find a pilgrim to fetch the scriptures: the brocade cassock,
 the nine-ringed monastic staff, and the three bands. He taught me the
 three secret spells, but a band-loosening spell was not one of them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case, Bodhisattva, I must say good-bye,&#8221; Monkey replied.
 &#8220;Where will you go?&#8221; the Bodhisattva asked. &#8220;I'll go to the Western
 Heaven to pay my respects to the Tathagata and ask him to teach me the
 Band-loosening Spell.&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Wait a moment while I find out
 for you whether the prospects are good.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No need,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Things are quite bad enough as they are
 already.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm not finding out about yours but about the Tang Priest's,&#8221; the
 Bodhisattva replied.</P>
<P>The splendid Bodhisattva then took her seat on her lotus throne and
 sent her heart roaming through the three worlds while her perceptive
 eyes traveled all over the universe. Within the instant she spoke:
 &#8220;Wukong, your master is just about to be wounded, and he will soon be
 coming to look for you. Wait here while I go to see the Tang Priest and
 tell him to continue taking you with him to fetch the scriptures and
 achieve the true reward.&#8221; The Great Sage could only agree and control
 his impatience as he stood at the foot of the lotus throne.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story returns to the Tang Priest, who since sending Monkey away
 had done some fifteen more miles to the West with Pig leading the horse
 and Friar Sand carrying the luggage. &#8220;Disciples,&#8221; he said, reining in
 the horse, &#8220;I'm extremely hungry and thirsty. I've been going for many
 hours since we left that cottage before dawn and I've been thoroughly
 upset by that Protector of the Horses. Which of you is going to beg me
 some food?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Down you get, Master,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;while I look round here for a
 village to beg some food in.&#8221; At this Sanzang dismounted, while the
 idiot went up into the air on a cloud and took a good look all around.
 All he could see were mountains: there was no hope of spotting a human
 house. Bringing the cloud back down Pig said to Sanzang, &#8220;There's
 nowhere to beg from here. I couldn't see a single farm when I looked
 around.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;fetch us some water to quench our
 thirst.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll get some from the stream on that mountain to the South,&#8221; said
 Pig, and Friar Sand handed him the begging bowl. While Pig carried it
 off on his cloud the master sat and waited beside the path for a very
 long time, getting more and more unbearably thirsty, and there was no
 sign of Pig. There is a poem to prove it that goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Preserve the true spirit and nourish the breath, for this is called
 essence.</P>
<P>Feeling and nature originally shared the same form.</P>
<P>When spirit and heart are disordered all illness arises;</P>
<P>If essence and form both decline the primal will crash.</P>
<P>Without the three contemplations all effort is wasted;</P>
<P>Should the four elements be too wretched there's no point in
 contending.</P>
<P>Without earth and wood there can be no more metal or water;</P>
<P>How can the dharma body be won through idleness?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Seeing his master in agony from thirst as Pig was not back with the
 water, Friar Sand put the luggage down, tethered the white horse, and
 said, &#8220;Master, make yourself comfortable. I'm going to hurry him up
 with that water.&#8221; Sanzang, too tearful to speak, nodded his head in
 agreement, whereupon Friar Sand headed by cloud for the mountain to the
 South.</P>
<P>Sanzang was left by himself to endure his excruciating pain. In his
 deep misery he was alarmed by a noise that made him sit up and look. It
 was Monkey kneeling by the side of the path holding a porcelain cup and
 saying, &#8220;Without me you can't even have water to drink, Master. Drink
 this cup of lovely cold water while I go to beg you some food.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I won't drink water you give me,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;I'd rather die of
 thirst right here. I want no more of you. Go away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But you'll never get to the Western Heaven without me,&#8221; said Monkey.
 &#8220;Whether I get there or not is none of your business,&#8221; the Tang Priest
 replied. &#8220;Wicked ape! Why do you keep pestering me?&#8221; At that Monkey
 turned angry and started shouting abusively, &#8220;You've been lousy to me,
 you cruel, vicious old baldy.&#8221; With that he threw the bowl aside and
 swung his cudgel, hitting Sanzang on his back. Sanzang fell to the
 ground, barely conscious and unable to speak, as Monkey took the two
 bundles wrapped in blue felt in his arms and disappeared without trace
 on a somersault cloud.</P>
<P>As Pig was hurrying to the mountain to the South with the bowl in his
 hand he noticed a thatched cottage in a hollow. He had not spotted it
 when first he looked because it had been hidden in a fold of the
 mountain. Realizing that it was a house now he was close to the idiot
 thought, &#8220;If I show them my ugly mug they'll be so scared they won't
 possibly give me any food. It'd all be wasted effort. I'd better turn
 into something a bit better-looking.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid idiot then made a spell with his hands, said the magic
 words, shook himself seven or eight times, and turned himself into a
 consumptive monk with a fat, sallow face who was mumbling something as
 he went up to the door and called out, &#8220;Benefactor, have you any
 leftover rice in the kitchen for starving travelers? I'm from the East
 and I'm on my way to fetch scriptures from the Western Heaven. My
 master is back at the road, hungry and thirsty. If you have any
 left-over rice stuck to the bottom of your pan I beg you to give me
 some to save our lives.&#8221;</P>
<P>As it happened the men of the house were all out transplanting rice
 and sowing millet, and the only people in were two women who had just
 cooked the rice for the midday meal and had filled two platters with it
 that they were preparing to take to the fields. There was some rice
 left at the bottom of the pan. Seeing how sickly he looked they took
 what he said about going from the East to fetch the scriptures from the
 Western Heaven as delirious ravings. Afraid he might collapse and die
 in the doorway, they made a great to-do as they filled his bowl with
 rice from the bottom of the pan. The idiot took it from them, reverted
 to his true form, and went back the way he had come.</P>
<P>As he was going along he heard a shout of &#8220;Pig!&#8221; and looked up to see
 Friar Sand standing on the top of a precipice yelling, &#8220;Over here, over
 here.&#8221; Friar Sand came down and walked straight towards him, asking,
 &#8220;Why didn't you take some of the fresh water from this stream? Why did
 you go over there?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;After I got here I saw a cottage in a hollow, so I went and begged
 this bowlful of rice.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We could certainly use it,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;but the master is
 terribly thirsty, so how are we going to carry some water back?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's easy,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;Carry this rice in the fold of your habit
 while I go and fetch some water in this bowl.&#8221;</P>
<P>The two of them were feeling very cheerful as they went back to the
 path, only to find Sanzang lying face downwards in the dirt. The white
 horse had slipped its bridle and was running to and fro beside the
 path, whinnying. There was not a sigh of the baggage. Pig stumbled and
 beat his breast with horror, &#8220;Don't tell me,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;don't tell
 me. The survivors of the gang Monkey drove away have come back, killed
 the master and stolen the baggage.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Tether the horse,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;Whatever shall we do? We've
 failed halfway along our journey. Master!&#8221; Tears poured down his face
 as he sobbed bitterly.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't cry, brother,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;As this is what's happened we'll
 just have to forget about fetching the scriptures. You look after the
 master's body. I'll take the horse till I get to some town, village,
 market or inn where I can sell it for a few ounces of silver to buy a
 coffin to bury him in. Then we'll split up and go our separate ways.&#8221;</P>
<P>Friar Sand, unable to bear the loss of his master, turned the body
 over to warm the face with his own. &#8220;Poor, poor master,&#8221; he cried, then
 noticed hot breath coming from his master's nose and felt warmth in his
 chest. &#8220;Come here, Pig,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;the master's still alive.&#8221; Pig
 came over and helped Sanzang to sit up.</P>
<P>As Sanzang came to he groaned and said bitterly, &#8220;That evil macaque
 tried to murder me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What macaque?&#8221; the other two asked. The venerable elder sighed and
 said nothing.</P>
<P>Only when he had asked for and drunk a few mouthfuls of water did he
 reply, &#8220;As soon as you'd gone Wukong came to pester me again. When I
 still refused to take him back he hit me with his cudgel and stole the
 bundles wrapped in blue felt.&#8221; At this Pig ground his teeth as the fury
 rose higher and higher in him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Damn that monkey,&#8221; he said. &#8220;How could he do such a terrible thing?
 Look after the master,&#8221; he continued, addressing Friar Sand, &#8220;I'm going
 to his house to get back the bundles.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't lose your temper,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;Let's help the master
 over to that cottage in the hollow to ask for hot tea. Then we can heat
 up the rice you've begged already, and get the master better before we
 go after Monkey.&#8221;</P>
<P>Accepting this suggestion Pig helped the master back on the horse.
 Carrying the bowl of water, and with the rice in Friar Sand's habit,
 they headed straight back for the door of the cottage. There was only
 an old woman at home, and at the sight of them she hid herself as fast
 as she could. Friar Sand put his hands together in front of his chest
 and said, &#8220;Good lady, we've been sent by the Tang court in the East to
 the Western Heaven. As our master is not very well I have come to ask
 you for some hot tea to warm his rice with.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We had a consumptive monk begging here just now who said he'd come
 from the East,&#8221; the old woman replied. &#8220;Now you say you're from the
 East too. There's nobody at home. Please try somewhere else.&#8221;</P>
<P>Hearing this, the venerable elder dismounted with Pig's help, bowed
 to her and said, &#8220;Madam, I used to have three disciples who worked
 together to protect me on my way to the Thunder Monastery in the
 country of India to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures. But
 because my senior disciple Sun Wukong is a born murderer and will not
 be kind I sent him away. To my utter surprise he sneaked up on me, hit
 me across the back, and stole my clothes, baggage and bowl. I want to
 send one of my other disciples after him, and as I can't stay by the
 roadside I have come here to ask if I may rest in your house for a
 while. It will only be till the luggage has been recovered. I won't
 stay long.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;A consumptive monk with a fat, sallow face begged some food from us
 just now,&#8221; the woman said. &#8220;He said he had come from the East and was
 going to the Western Heaven. There can't be another group of you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That was me,&#8221; said Pig, unable to keep a straight face any longer.
 &#8220;I made myself look like that. I thought my long snout and big ears
 would give you such a fright that you wouldn't give me any food. If you
 don't believe me, my brother here has the rice from the bottom of your
 pan inside his tunic.&#8221;</P>
<P>Recognizing the rice the old woman stopped trying to send them away.
 She asked them to sit down inside and prepared a pot of hot tea that
 she gave to Friar Sand to warm the rice with. He did this and handed it
 to his master, who ate a few mouthfuls, sat quietly to calm himself for
 a while, then asked, &#8220;Which of you will go to fetch the luggage?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When you sent him away the other year,&#8221; replied Pig, &#8220;I went to
 fetch him. I know the way to his Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of
 Flowers and Fruit. Wait here while I go.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;not you. You have never got on with that
 macaque, and besides you're very rough-spoken. If you say anything
 wrong he'll hit you. Let Wujing go.&#8221; Friar Sand agreed at once, and
 Sanzang gave him these instructions: &#8220;When you get there you must keep
 a close watch on the situation. If he is willing to give you back the
 bundles then pretend to be very grateful when you accept them. If he
 won't you must on no account quarrel with him. Go straight to the
 Bodhisattva in the Southern Sea, tell her what has happened, and ask
 her to demand them from him.&#8221;</P>
<P>Friar Sand accepted his instructions and said to Pig, &#8220;I'm off to
 find Monkey now. Whatever you do, don't complain. Look after the master
 properly. You mustn't have a row with these people or they might not
 feed you. I'll soon be back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; Pig replied with a nod. &#8220;Off you go, and come back
 soon whether you recover the luggage or not. Otherwise we'll have lost
 both ways,&#8221; Friar Sand then made a hand spell and headed off by cloud
 for the Eastern Continent of Superior Body. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the body is present but the soul files off, nothing remains to
 keep it alive;</P>
<P>A furnace without fire can refine no cinnabar.</P>
<P>The yellow wife leaves the lord to seek the metal elder.</P>
<P>Wood's mother puts on a sickly face to look after the master.</P>
<P>Who knows when this journey will ever end</P>
<P>Or when he will return from far away?</P>
<P>The Five Elements give birth and yield to each other.</P>
<P>All is disorder until the mind-ape comes back.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Friar Sand flew for three days and nights before he reached the
 Eastern Ocean. At the sound of its waves he looked down and saw</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Black mists up to the sky and gloomy vapors;</P>
<P>The ocean embracing the sun in dawn's cold light.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>But he was in no mood to enjoy the view as he crossed Yingzhou and
 the other islands of immortals and headed on East straight for the
 Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. Riding the sea wind and walking on the
 water it took him a lot longer before he saw a line of peaks like
 serried halberds and sheer rocks like screens. When he reached the
 highest peak he landed his cloud and found his way down the mountain,
 heading for the Water Curtain Cave. As he approached he heard a great
 commotion: the mountain was covered with yelling monkey spirits. When
 closer still he saw Monkey sitting on a high stone terrace holding a
 piece of paper in both hands from which he was reading:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We, the Emperor Li of the Great Tang Dynasty in the East have called
 to our presence our younger brother the Master of the Law Chen Xuanzang
 and commissioned him to go West to seek the scriptures from the Lord
 Buddha in the Thunder Monastery at the Saha Vulture Peak in India. When
 our soul went wandering in the Underworld after we succumbed to a
 sudden illness we were fortunate enough to have our years of life
 extended and to be returned to the world of the living by the Lord of
 Darkness. Since then we have held many masses and built altars to help
 the souls of the dead across to the other side. We were blessed by the
 appearance of the golden deliverer from suffering, the Bodhisattva
 Guanyin, who informed us that the Buddha in the West has scriptures
 that will deliver all lost souls. We have therefore sent the Dharma
 Master Xuanzang to make the long journey across a thousand mountains in
 search of the sutras and the gathas. We request that in the states of
 the West through which he passed he be allowed to proceed in accordance
 with this passport and that his holy cause be not brought to naught.
 Given on an auspicious day in the autumn of the thirteenth year of<I>
 Zhenguan</I> of the Great Tang.</P>
<P>Since leaving that mighty empire he has passed through many other
 states. On the journey he has taken three disciples. The senior one is
 Sun Wukong the Novice; the second is Zhu Wuneng, or Zhu Bajie; and the
 third is Sha Wujing, or Friar Sand.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Having read the text of Sanzang's passport through once he read it
 out again, at which Friar Sand could not help himself calling out at
 the top of his voice, &#8220;Brother, why are you reading the master's
 passport out?&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he jerked his head up and, refusing to
 recognize Friar Sand, shouted, &#8220;Arrest him! Arrest him!&#8221; All the
 monkeys rushed him and surrounded him, pulling him and dragging him
 towards Monkey, who shouted, &#8220;Who do you think you are? What a nerve,
 coming so close to our immortals' cave.&#8221;</P>
<P>Seeing how Monkey had turned cold and was refusing to recognize him
 any longer Friar Sand had no choice but to go up to him with a bow and
 say, &#8220;Elder brother, it was wrong of our master to be so angry with
 you, curse you and send you away. Pig and I ought to have persuaded him
 not to, and we shouldn't have been away looking for water and begging
 for food for our starving, thirsty master when you were so good as to
 come back. It was wrong of the master to be so stubborn and to refuse
 again to let you stay. That was why you knocked him senseless and took
 the luggage. When we came back we revived the master and now I've come
 to see you. Unless you hate the master and have forgotten what you owe
 him for delivering you from your torment in the past, won't you bring
 the luggage and come back with me to see him? Then we can all go to the
 Western Heaven and win our true reward. If you really hate him so
 deeply that you won't come with me, then please, please give me the
 bundles. Then you can enjoy the sunset of your life here in your native
 mountain. This way we'll all be fine.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey's answer to this was to say with a derisive laugh, &#8220;that's not
 what I had in mind at all, brother. The reason why I hit the master and
 took the luggage isn't because I'm not going to the West or want to
 stay here. I'm learning the passport off by heart so that I can go to
 the Western Heaven to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures
 myself. I shall have all the glory of taking them back to the East.
 I'll make those people in the Southern Jambu Continent see me as a
 great master and I'll be famous for ever.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What you say isn't quite right,&#8221; replied Friar Sand with a smile.
 &#8220;Nobody's ever heard of Sun the Novice going to fetch the scriptures.
 Our Tathagata Buddha created three stores of true scriptures and sent
 the Bodhisattva Guanyin to the East to find the pilgrim who would go to
 fetch them. Our job is to escort the pilgrim across a thousand
 mountains and through all the countries along the way. As the
 Bodhisattva has told us, the pilgrim was once the venerable elder
 Golden Cicada, a disciple of Tathagata Buddha's. Because he was exiled
 from Vulture Peak and reborn in the East for not listening to the Lord
 Buddha's sermons on the scriptures he is the one who must make his true
 achievement in the West and return to the Great Way. We three were
 saved to protect him from the demons he would meet on the journey. No
 Lord Buddha's going to give you the scriptures if you turn up without
 the Tang Priest. It'd just be wasted effort.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you've always been rather thick. You don't
 know the half of it. You may say you've got a Tang Priest, but what
 makes you think I haven't got one to escort to? I've chosen another
 holy monk here to escort. No problem! We're starting off on our big
 journey tomorrow. If you don't believe me I'll show you him. Little
 ones,&#8221; he called, &#8220;bring my master out at once.&#8221; In they ran, and they
 came out again leading a white horse, a Tang Sanzang, a Pig carrying
 the luggage and a Friar Sand with his monastic staff.</P>
<P>&#8220;I've never changed my name,&#8221; roared Friar Sand in fury at this
 sight. &#8220;There can't possibly be another Friar Sand. How dare you! Take
 this!&#8221; The splendid Friar Sand raised his demon-quelling staff with
 both arms and brought it down on his double's head, killing him
 outright and revealing that he had really been a monkey spirit. This
 made Monkey so angry that he swung his gold-banded cudgel and led all
 the monkeys to surround him. Lashing about him, Friar Sand fought his
 way out and escaped by cloud.</P>
<P>&#8220;That damned ape is being so thoroughly vicious that I'll have to
 report him to the Bodhisattva,&#8221; he thought; and as Friar Sand had
 killed a monkey spirit and been driven away Monkey did not go after
 him. Going back to his cave he told his underlings to drag the corpse
 to one side, skin it and cook its flesh, on which he and the other
 monkeys then feasted with coconut toddy and the wine of grapes. Then he
 chose another monkey fiend who was good at transformations to turn into
 Friar Sand and started instructing him again as he prepared to travel
 to the West. There we shall leave him.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Meanwhile Friar Sand flew his cloud away from the Eastern Ocean and
 traveled for a day and a night to the Southern Ocean. Before long Mount
 Potaraka came into view not far away, so he pressed forward then
 brought his cloud down so that he could stop and look. It was a
 wonderful sight. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>It includes all the mysteries of heaven and earth.</P>
<P>Here is the confluence of the rivers,</P>
<P>Where sun and stars are washed and bathed.</P>
<P>Hither all creatures come,</P>
<P>The winds are born and the moon is rocked in the ripples.</P>
<P>When the tidal wave rises high the leviathan is transformed.</P>
<P>Amid the mighty breakers the giant turtle swims.</P>
<P>The waters are joined to the Western and Northern Seas;</P>
<P>The waves connect with the Central and Eastern Oceans.</P>
<P>The four seas are linked as the artery of the earth;</P>
<P>In the magic islands are palaces of immortals.</P>
<P>Forget about all the earthly paradises;</P>
<P>Look at Potaraka's cloudy cave.</P>
<P>A wonderful sight:</P>
<P>Noble the primal spirit of the peak at sunset;</P>
<P>Below the cliffs the winds make rippling crystal.</P>
<P>Peacocks fly in the Purple Bamboo Grove;</P>
<P>Parrots talk in the branches of green poplar.</P>
<P>Flowers of jade and jasper always bloom;</P>
<P>Precious trees and golden lotuses grow every year.</P>
<P>White cranes come to pay homage at this peak;</P>
<P>Phoenixes often alight in the mountain pavilions.</P>
<P>Even the fish here cultivate their true nature,</P>
<P>Leaping in the waves as they listen to the scriptures.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As Friar Sand strolled on the mountain enjoying this magical view
 Moksa the Novice came up to him and said, &#8220;Why are you here instead of
 escorting the Tang Priest on his way to fetch the scriptures, Sha
 Wujing?&#8221;</P>
<P>Friar Sand bowed to him and replied, &#8220;There is something on which I
 would like an audience with the Bodhisattva. Could I trouble you to
 take me to her?&#8221;</P>
<P>Moksa, who realized that he was looking for Monkey, asked no further
 questions but went straight to the Bodhisattva and said, &#8220;The Tang
 Priest's junior disciple Sha Wujing is here to pay homage.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey, who was still there below the lotus throne, heard this
 he said with a smile, &#8220;The Tang Priest must be in trouble if Friar Sand
 is here to ask for your help, Bodhisattva.&#8221; The Bodhisattva then asked
 Moksa to bring him in. Friar Sand prostrated himself on the ground to
 kowtow to her, then looked up, about to start making his complaint,
 when he saw Monkey standing beside her. Without a word he struck at
 Monkey's face with his demon-subduing staff. Instead of hitting back
 Monkey dodged the blow and got out of the way.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll get you, you thoroughly evil, treacherous ape,&#8221; roared Friar
 Sand. &#8220;You're trying to deceive the Bodhisattva too.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't hit him,&#8221; shouted the Bodhisattva. &#8220;Tell me what's been
 happening.&#8221;</P>
<P>Only then did Friar Sand put down his precious staff and kowtow to
 the lotus throne again, saying with raging fury, &#8220;We're lost count of
 the number of murders this ape has committed on the journey. The other
 day he killed two highwaymen and the master let him have it, so when we
 were spending the next night at the bandit chief's home it came as a
 shock when he butchered as many of the gang as he could and took a
 severed head all dripping with blood to show to the master. It gave the
 master such a fright that he fell off his horse, said some nasty things
 to Monkey and sent him packing. After he'd gone the master was so
 hungry and thirsty that he sent Pig off to look for some water, and
 because Pig took a very long time to get back he sent me off after him.
 We never imagined that Monkey would come back, hit the master with his
 iron cudgel and steal the two bundles wrapped in blue felt while we
 were away. We came back and brought the master round. Then I went all
 the way to the Water Curtain Cave to fetch Monkey. To my amazement he
 turned cold and refused to recognize me. He was reading the master's
 passport aloud over and over again. When I asked him why, he said that
 as he couldn't escort the Tang Priest any further he was going to fetch
 the scriptures from the Western Heaven and take them back East himself.
 Then they'd treat him as a great master and he'd be famous for ever.
 When I asked who'd give him scriptures if the Tang Priest wasn't with
 him he said he'd chosen a holy monk and asked him to come out. There
 was a white horse, a Tang Priest, a Pig and a Friar Sand. Tm Friar
 Sand,' I said, 'and the one and only Friar Sand too'. I hit him one
 with my staff, and he turned out to be a monkey spirit. When Monkey
 came after me with his hordes I decided to come here to tell you,
 Bodhisattva, and ask for your help. I never realized he'd get here
 before me by somersault cloud, or that he'd fool you with his fine
 words.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You must not make such slanders, Wujing,&#8221; the Bodhisattva said.
 &#8220;Wukong has been here for four days. I never let him go back, and he
 didn't send for another Tang Priest to go to fetch the scriptures.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But what about that Monkey in the Water Curtain Cave? I'm telling
 you the truth,&#8221; replied Friar Sand.</P>
<P>&#8220;Calm down,&#8221; said the Bodhisattva. &#8220;I'll send Wukong back to the
 Mountain of Flowers and Fruit with you to take a good look round. If
 he's real he'll be hard to wipe out, but if he's a fake you'll be able
 to eliminate him easily. You'll find out which he is when you get
 there.&#8221; At this Brother Monkey and Friar Sand took their leave of the
 Bodhisattva. They were making their journey</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>To the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The rights and wrongs to reveal;</P>
<P>To the cave with a curtain of water</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;To tell the false from the real.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know how they told them apart you had better listen to
 the explanation in the next installment</P>

<P>Two Minds Throw Heaven and Earth into Uproar</P>
<P>One Body Cannot Achieve True Nirvana</P>
</B>
<P>When Monkey and Friar Sand took their leave of the Bodhisattva they
 departed from the Southern Ocean by two beams of auspicious light. Now
 Monkey's somersault cloud was much faster than Friar Sand's immortal's
 cloud, so Monkey was drawing ahead when Friar Sand pulled him back and
 said, &#8220;There's no need for you to show me your heels like that,
 brother, rushing ahead to sort things out at home. Wait for me to come
 with you.&#8221;</P>
<P>Although Brother Monkey's intentions were good Friar Sand could not
 help being suspicious. The two of them then flew their clouds together
 and were soon in sight of the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. They
 brought their clouds down and had a good look at the outside of the
 cave, where there was indeed a Monkey sitting on a high stone terrace,
 drinking and making merry with his monkey hosts. He looked exactly the
 same as the Great Sage: yellow hair held in a golden band, fiery eyes
 with golden pupils, a brocade tunic, a tigerskin kilt, a gold-banded
 iron cudgel in his hands, and deerskin boots. He had the same</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Hairy face like a thunder god,</P>
<P>Cheeks like the planet Saturn;</P>
<P>Pointed ears and a forehead broad,</P>
<P>And long, protruding fangs.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In an explosion of fury the Great Sage left Friar Sand behind as he
 went up to the other, brandishing his cudgel and shouting abusively,
 &#8220;What sort of demon do you think you are? How dare you! You make
 yourself look like me, you steal my children and grandchildren, you
 occupy my immortal's cave, and on top of that you live it up like
 this.&#8221; When the other Monkey heard all this he did not deign to reply
 but went for him with his own iron cudgel. When the two Monkeys were
 together there was no way of telling the true from the false. It was a
 splendid fight:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Two cudgels and a pair of monkey spirits,</P>
<P>A couple of truly formidable foes.</P>
<P>Both want to escort the Tang emperor's brother;</P>
<P>Each longs to achieve what will make him famous.</P>
<P>The true Monkey now accepts Sakyamuni's teachings;</P>
<P>The false demon only pretends to be a Buddhist.</P>
<P>In magic powers and transformations</P>
<P>The false and true are evenly balanced.</P>
<P>One is the Sage Equaling Heaven of primal energy,</P>
<P>The other an earth spirit who has long refined his powers.</P>
<P>One wields an As-You-Will gold-banded cudgel,</P>
<P>The other an iron bar that follows the heart's desire.</P>
<P>As they block and parry neither comes out on top.</P>
<P>First they fight each other outside the cave,</P>
<P>But soon they carry on the struggle in mid air.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Each of them rose on his clouds and light till they were fighting up
 in the clouds of the ninth heaven. As Friar Sand stood beside them he
 dared not intervene in their fight as he really could not tell the true
 Monkey from the false one. He longed to draw his sword and join in, but
 he was frightened of wounding the real Monkey. When he had endured this
 dilemma for a long time he shot back down to the mountain scar, where
 he used his demon-quelling staff to fight his way to the outside of the
 Water Curtain Cave. Here he sent all the demons fleeing in terror,
 turned the stone benches over, and smashed the tableware from which
 they had been eating and drinking to their hearts' content. But
 although he looked everywhere for the blue felt bundles he failed to
 find them. Now the Water Curtain Cave was so called because the
 waterfall screening its entrance looked from a distance like a white
 cloth curtain and only appeared as the waterfall it was from close to.
 As Friar Sand did not know that the entrance to the cave was behind it
 he was unable to find the way in, so he took his cloud back up to the
 Ninth Heaven and started swinging his staff again, still unable to
 strike.</P>
<P>&#8220;Friar Sand,&#8221; said the Great Sage, &#8220;you can't help much here. Go back
 and tell the master what's been happening to us while I drive this
 demon to Potaraka Island in the Southern Ocean for the Bodhisattva to
 identify me as the real Monkey.&#8221; The other Monkey then repeated what he
 had said. As they looked and sounded exactly the same Friar Sand really
 could not tell them apart. He could only do as he was told and ride his
 cloud back to rejoin the Tang Priest.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The two Monkeys meanwhile fought and shouted their way to the
 Southern Ocean, where they went straight to Potaraka Island still
 throwing blows and abuse at each other. Their unending shouts disturbed
 all the devas who protected the Law, so that they went to the Tide Cave
 and reported, &#8220;Bodhisattva, two Sun Wukongs really have fought their
 way here.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Bodhisattva came down from her lotus throne and went with Moksa,
 the page Sudhana and the Naga Maiden to the entrance, where she
 shouted, &#8220;Stay where you are, evil beast.&#8221;</P>
<P>Each Monkey grabbed hold of the other one while the real one said,
 &#8220;Bodhisattva, this damned fiend really does look just like me. Our
 fight started at the Water Curtain Cave and has been going on for a
 very long time without getting anywhere. Friar Sand's mortal eyes are
 too weak to tell us apart, so he can't help at all. I sent him back
 West to report to the master while I fought this bloody impostor here
 for you to distinguish the true from the false. Your eyes are
 perceptive, Bodhisattva.&#8221;</P>
<P>The other Monkey then said exactly the same. Look long and hard
 though they did, the devas and the Bodhisattva could not tell which was
 which. &#8220;Let go of each other and stand one on each side while I take
 another look,&#8221; the Bodhisattva said.</P>
<P>Doing as she told them, the one on her left said, &#8220;I'm the real
 Monkey,&#8221; and the one on her right said, &#8220;He's an impostor.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Bodhisattva then called Moksa and Sudhana to her and whispered
 these instructions: &#8220;I want one of you to stand very close to each of
 them while I recite the Band-tightening Spell quietly. The one in agony
 will be the real one, and the one who isn't will be the impostor.&#8221;</P>
<P>One of them went up to each of the Monkeys, but as the Bodhisattva
 secretly said the words of the spell they both yelled out in pain,
 clutched their heads, and rolled on the ground shouting, &#8220;Stop! Stop!&#8221;
 The moment she did they grabbed each other again and went on fighting
 and shouting. At her wit's end, the Bodhisattva ordered the devas and
 Moksa to help, but none of them dared strike a blow for fear of
 wounding the real Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Sun Wukong,&#8221; called the Bodhisattva, and both the Monkeys answered
 her. &#8220;As you were once appointed the Protector of the Horses,&#8221; said the
 Bodhisattva, &#8220;When you made havoc in the Heavenly Palace, all the
 heavenly generals recognize you. Go to the upper world: let it
 distinguish between you two. Come back and tell me the result.&#8221; The
 Great Sage thanked the Bodhisattva for her kindness and the other
 Monkey also thanked her.</P>
<P>Pulling and tugging at each other and keeping up their ceaseless
 clamour they went straight to the Southern Gate of Heaven, where the
 Heavenly King Virupaksa led the four heavenly generals Ma, Zhao, Wen
 and Guan and all the other gate gods great and small to block the
 entrance with their weapons.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;This is no place for a brawl.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Sanzang sent me away for killing some bandits while I was escorting
 him to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures,&#8221; the Great Sage
 replied. &#8220;I went to Potaraka to complain. To my horror this evil spirit
 turned himself into my double, knocked the Tang Priest over and stole
 the luggage. Friar Sand went to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit
 looking for me and found that this evil spirit had seized my cave. Then
 he went to Potaraka to tell the Bodhisattva and ask for her help. When
 he saw me there he made the outrageous accusation that I'd got there
 first by somersault cloud and told the Bodhisattva a pack of lies to
 cover up. Luckily she could vouch for me and didn't believe Friar Sand,
 so she sent us both back to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit to find
 out what had happened. As you can see, this evil spirit looks just like
 me. We fought our way from the Water Curtain Cave to Potaraka Island to
 see the Bodhisattva, but she couldn't tell us apart, so I've now fought
 him all the way here in the hope that all the eyes of all the heavens
 will be able to see that I'm the real Monkey.&#8221; Then the other Monkey
 told the same story. No matter how long they looked all the gods of the
 heavens could not tell them apart.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you can't tell which is which,&#8221; the two Monkey shouted, &#8220;get out
 of the way and let us go to see the Jade Emperor.&#8221;</P>
<P>As the gods could not stop them they opened the gates wide to let
 them go straight to the Hall of Miraculous Mist. Marshal Ma and the
 four Heavenly Teachers Zhang, Ge, Xu and Qiu all reported to the Jade
 Emperor, &#8220;Two identical Sun Wukongs from the mortal world have charged
 in through the gates of Heaven and say that they want to see Your
 Majesty.&#8221; Before they had finished the two Monkeys came roaring
 straight in, so alarming the Jade Emperor that he came down from his
 throne and stood in the palace hall. &#8220;Why are you two making such a row
 in the heavenly palace and shouting in our presence?&#8221; the Jade Emperor
 asked. &#8220;Do you want to die?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Long live Your Majesty,&#8221; said the Great Sage. &#8220;Now that I'm a devout
 Buddhist I'd never dare try to bully my betters. It's just that this
 evil spirit has turned himself into my double.&#8221; He then told the whole
 story, concluding, &#8220;and I beg that Your Majesty will unmask the
 impostor.&#8221; Then the other Monkey said the same thing all over again.</P>
<P>The Jade Emperor ordered Heavenly King Li the Pagoda-carrier to look
 at them both in his demon-revealing mirror, kill the false one and
 preserve the true one. The Heavenly King caught them both in his mirror
 and invited the Jade Emperor and the other deities all to look. Both
 Monkeys could be seen in it, wearing the same golden band and the same
 clothes. There was not the slightest difference between them. Unable to
 tell them apart, the Jade Emperor had both of them driven out of the
 palace.</P>
<P>The Great Sage gave a mocking laugh and so did the other Monkey. Then
 they grabbed each other by the hair and by the throat, fought their way
 out of the heavenly gates, and landed on the road to the West. &#8220;Let's
 go and see the master,&#8221; said one of them; and the other replied, &#8220;Let's
 go and see the master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After Friar Sand had taken his leave of the two Monkeys it took him
 three days and nights' travelling to return to the farm, where he told
 the Tang Priest everything that had happened. The Tang Priest was full
 of regrets: &#8220;I said that Sun Wukong had hit me and stolen the bundles,
 never realizing that an evil spirit had turned itself into an imitation
 Monkey.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The evil spirit made doubles of yourself, the white horse, Pig
 carrying our luggage, and me,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;I was so furious that
 I killed the fake Friar Sand: he was really a monkey spirit. That made
 them all run away, then I went to tell the Bodhisattva my troubles. She
 sent Monkey and me back to identify the demon, but he was so much like
 the real Monkey that I couldn't help in the fight, which is why I've
 come back to report to you, Master.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang paled with horror at this news, while Pig roared with
 laughter. &#8220;Great, great,&#8221; he guffawed. &#8220;Just as this kind old lady
 said, there are several lots of pilgrims going to fetch the scriptures.
 They're one lot, aren't they?&#8221;</P>
<P>Everyone in the house, young and old alike, came to ask Friar Sand,
 &#8220;Where have you been looking for money for your travelling expenses
 these last few days?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I went to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit in the Eastern Continent
 of Superior Body to look for my eldest brother and fetch the baggage,&#8221;
 Friar Sand replied with a smile. &#8220;Then I went to Potaraka Island in the
 Southern Ocean to see the Bodhisattva Guanyin and to the Mountain of
 Flowers and Fruit again before coming back here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How long was your return journey?&#8221; the old man of the family asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;About 70,000 miles,&#8221; Friar Sand replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;That would be a very long way to walk in only a few days,&#8221; the old
 man said, &#8220;You must have gone by cloud to get there.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How else do you think he got across the sea?&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;What you and I do is like walking compared with Monkey: he'd have
 been there and back in a day or two,&#8221; said Friar Sand. When the family
 heard this they realized that they must all be gods or immortals.</P>
<P>&#8220;No, we're not,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;We're senior to them.&#8221;</P>
<P>As they were talking they were interrupted by a noisy quarrel in mid
 air, and when they rushed out to look they saw two Monkeys fighting.
 The sight made Pig's hands itch. &#8220;I'm going up to tell them apart,&#8221; he
 said, and with that the splendid idiot leapt up into the air and
 shouted, &#8220;Stop yelling, brother, Pig's here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Hit the evil spirit,&#8221; both Monkeys shouted, &#8220;hit the evil spirit.&#8221;</P>
<P>All this both horrified and delighted the family, who exclaimed,
 &#8220;We've got a whole lot of arhats who can ride on clouds staying with
 us. Even if we'd made a vow to feed monks we would never have been able
 to feed such holy men as these.&#8221; They were now more generous with their
 food and tea than ever. Then they began to worry that if the fight
 between the two Sun the Novices turned nasty, heaven and earth might be
 turned upside down: it could be disastrous.</P>
<P>Seeing that behind the old man's delight lay these deep misgivings
 Sanzang said to him, &#8220;There's no need to worry or alarm yourself,
 benefactor. When I made him submit and become my disciple he gave up
 evil and turned to good. Of course we will show you our gratitude.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That would be too great an honour,&#8221; the old man replied, &#8220;too great
 an honour.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop talking now, benefactor,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;and you sit here,
 Master. Pig and I'll each bring one of them back here to stand in front
 of you. When you say the spell the one who suffers will be the real
 Monkey and the one who doesn't will be the impostor.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a very good idea,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>Friar Sand then rose up into mid-air and said, &#8220;Stop it, both of you.
 I'm taking you for the master to choose between you.&#8221; The Great Sage
 then let go of his opponent, and so did the other Monkey. Friar Sand
 held one and told Pig to hold the other, and they took them both down
 by their clouds till they stood in front of the thatched cottage.</P>
<P>As soon as he saw them Sanzang began to say the Band-tightening
 Spell, at which both Monkeys cried out together, &#8220;Why do you have to
 say that spell when we're fighting so hard? Stop! Stop!&#8221; Being a kind
 and merciful man the venerable elder stopped reciting the spell before
 he had been able to tell them apart. The two Monkeys then broke free
 from Pig and Friar Sand and started fighting again.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brothers,&#8221; the Great Sage said, &#8220;look after the master while I fight
 this impostor down to get the Kings of the Underworld to tell which of
 us is which.&#8221; The other Monkey said likewise, and the two of them soon
 disappeared, grabbing and tugging at each other.</P>
<P>&#8220;Friar Sand,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;why didn't you grab the luggage off the fake
 Pig when you saw him carrying it at the Water Curtain Cave?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The evil spirits surrounded me when I killed my double with the
 demon-quelling staff,&#8221; Friar Sand replied. &#8220;They were going to get me,
 so I had to flee for my life. After I'd been to see the Bodhisattva and
 gone back to the cave entrance again with Monkey I overturned all their
 stone benches and scattered the little demons, but I couldn't see any
 entrance to the cave, only a waterfall. I came back empty-handed as I
 couldn't find the luggage.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Let me tell you something,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;When I went there a few years
 ago to ask him to come back we met outside the cave. After I'd
 persuaded him to come he jumped down and went into the cave to change.
 I saw him go straight through the water: the waterfall is the entrance.
 I bet that's where that devil has put our luggage.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As you know the way into the cave I think you'd better go and fetch
 our baggage from there while the demon's away,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;Even if
 Wukong does come back I still won't have him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm off then,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;There are thousands and thousands of little monkeys in front of the
 cave,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;It'd be terrible if they were too much for you
 by yourself.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm not worried,&#8221; said Pig, who rushed outside and headed off to the
 Mountain of Flowers and Fruit to fetch the luggage.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The two Monkeys fought their way round to the back of the Dark
 Mountain of the Underworld, where all the demons shivered and shook
 with terror as they hid themselves. The ones who managed to run away
 first rushed straight to the Underworld government offices and reported
 to the Senluo Palace, &#8220;Your Majesties, two Great Sages Equaling Heaven
 have come to the Dark Mountain and are fighting their way here.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Ring of Qinguang in the First Palace reported this with alarm to
 the King of Chujiang in the Second Palace. The news was passed on in
 turn to King Songdi in the Third Palace, the King of Biancheng in the
 Fourth Palace, King Yama in the Fifth Palace, King Impartial in the
 Sixth Palace, the King of Taishan in the Seventh Palace, the
 Metropolitan King in the Eighth Palace, King Wuguan in the Ninth
 Palace, and King Everturning Wheel in the Tenth Palace. In an instant
 the Ten Kings all gathered together and sent an urgent message to King
 Ksitigarbha. Meanwhile the Underworld forces were mustered in the
 Senluo Palace ready to capture the true and the false Monkey. Just then
 there was the roar of a mighty wind as dreary mists filled the air and
 the two Monkeys came tumbling and rolling to the Senluo Palace.</P>
<P>The Lords of the Underworld stepped forward to block their way and
 say, &#8220;Great Sages, why are you making such disorder in our Underworld?&#8221;</P>
<P>To this the real Great Sage replied, &#8220;I was escorting the Tang Priest
 on his journey to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven when
 bandits tried to rob him on a mountain in the land of Western Liang. He
 got angry with me when I killed a few of them and sent me away. I went
 to tell my troubles to the Bodhisattva in the Southern Ocean. I never
 imagined that this demon would have the effrontery to turn himself into
 my double, attack my master on the road, and steal our baggage. When my
 fellow-disciple Friar Sand went back to my mountain to fetch the
 baggage he found that the demon had created an imitation of the master
 to take to the Western Heaven and fetch the scriptures, so he rushed to
 the Southern Ocean to see the Bodhisattva Guanyin and found me there at
 her side. After he'd told his story the Bodhisattva sent me back to the
 Mountain of Flowers and Fruit with him to see what was going on. I
 found that this bastard had stolen my cave. We argued all the way to
 the Bodhisattva Guanyin's place, but she couldn't tell which of us was
 the real me. Then I fought with him up to Heaven, where none of the
 gods knew which of us was which, and after that went to see the master.
 When the master recited the Band-tightening Spell my double was in just
 as much pain as I was. That's why I've brought this chaos to the
 Underworld in the hope that Your Majesties will look up the Registers
 of Life and Death for me to find out about the False Sun the Novice's
 background so that I can catch his soul and end this confusion of there
 being two minds.&#8221; The demon then said the same thing.</P>
<P>The Lords of the Underworld called on the judges in charge of the
 records to go through them carefully from beginning to end. There was
 nobody under the name of False Sun the Novice. They checked through the
 registers of hairy beasts again, and found that under item 130 in the
 monkey section there was a record of how the Great Sage Sun had
 achieved the Way in his youth, made havoc in the Underworld and removed
 his name from the registers of death, so that from then on none of the
 monkeys were listed. When the judges had made their inspection they
 reported back to the palace.</P>
<P>Holding their tablets of office, the Lords of the Underworld said to
 Monkey, &#8220;Great Sage, there are no names in the records that can be
 checked. You will have to go back to the world of the living to be told
 apart.&#8221;</P>
<P>As they were saying this they heard the Bodhisattva King Ksitigarbha
 shout, &#8220;Wait, wait! I'll send Examiner to tell you apart.&#8221; Now Examiner
 was the name of an animal who lay under the Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha's
 sutra table. Just by lying there he could tell good from evil and wise
 from stupid among any of the snails, fish, hairy creatures, feathered
 creatures, insects, heavenly immortals, earthly immortals, divine
 immortals, human immortals and devil immortals in all the mountains,
 rivers and countries of the four great continents, in all cave heavens
 and in all blessed places. The animal lay on the ground in the
 courtyard of the Senluo Palace as Ksitigarbha instructed it.</P>
<P>A little later it raised its head and said to Ksitigarbha, &#8220;I've
 found the name of the demon, but I cannot say it to his face, nor can I
 help catch him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What would happen if you identified him to his face?&#8221; Ksitigarbha
 asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;If I did,&#8221; Examiner replied, &#8220;I am afraid that the evil spirit would
 turn nasty, make disorder in the palace and destroy the peace of the
 Underworld.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why won't you help capture him?&#8221; Ksitigarbha went on to ask, and
 Examiner replied, &#8220;The evil spirit's magic powers are no less than
 those of Sun Wukong. No matter how much dharma power the gods of the
 Underworld have, they would never be able to catch him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case, how is the evil spirit to be got rid of?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Boundless is the Buddha's Dharma,&#8221; Examiner replied. Ksitigarbha was
 now enlightened. &#8220;As you two look the same and have the same magic
 powers,&#8221; he said to both Monkeys, &#8220;if you want to be told apart you
 will have to go to Sakyamuni Buddha in Thunder Monastery.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right,&#8221; they both replied together, &#8220;you've right. You and
 I'll go to the Western Heaven to be told apart by the Lord Buddha.&#8221;
 They then took their leave of Ksitigarbha and were seen out by the Ten
 Kings of the Underworld as they went up to the Turquoise Cloud Palace,
 after which devils were sent to close the entrance to the Underworld.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Watch the two Monkeys as they fly by cloud and mist to the Western
 Heaven. There is a poem about it that goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Troubles arise if one has two minds;</P>
<P>Doubts cloud everything from sea to sky.</P>
<P>One desires fine horses and the highest rank,</P>
<P>Craving for eminence at the royal court.</P>
<P>Fighting North and South without respite,</P>
<P>They parry to East and West with never a pause.</P>
<P>In dhyana the secret of mindlessness must be learned;</P>
<P>Nourish the babe in silence and form the holy foetus.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The two of them fought as they flew through the air, grabbing,
 tugging, pulling and snatching at each other, all the way to the
 outside of the Thunder Monastery on Vulture Peak in the Western Heaven.
 Even before they arrived the four Bodhisattvas, the eight vajrapanis,
 the five hundred arhats, the three thousand protectors, the nuns,
 monks, lay people and all the holy hosts were standing beneath the
 seven-precious lotus throne listening to the Tathagata expounding the
 Dharma. This is what he was explaining:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>There is existence in non-existence, non-existence in
 non-non-existence. There is matter in non-matter, emptiness in
 non-emptiness. What exists is non-existent, and what does not exist is
 not non-existent. Non-matter is matter; non-emptiness is emptiness.
 Emptiness is emptiness and matter is matter. Matter is not permanent
 matter, matter is empty. Emptiness is not permanent emptiness,
 emptiness is matter. Know that emptiness is not empty and that matter
 is not matter. This is what is meant by insight and understanding the
 Wonderful Voice.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>All the host kowtowed in submission. Amid the sound of chanting the
 Tathagata released a shower of heavenly petals, left his throne and
 said to them. &#8220;You are all of one mind. Watch the struggle of two minds
 coming here.&#8221;</P>
<P>They all raised their eyes to look and saw the two Monkeys come
 shouting and yelling to the holy Thunder Peak. The eight vajrapanis
 were so alarmed that they stepped forward to block their way and say,
 &#8220;Where do you two think you are going?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This evil spirit has turned himself into my double,&#8221; Monkey replied,
 &#8220;so I wish to go to the lotus throne to ask the Tathagata to tell that
 I am the real Sun Wukong and he is an impostor.&#8221;</P>
<P>As the vajrapanis could not stop them they yelled at each other right
 to the foot of the lotus throne, where they kowtowed and each of them
 said, &#8220;Your disciple has been escorting the Tang Priest here to fetch
 the true scriptures. Goodness only knows how much effort I've spent
 dealing with demons and capturing monsters along the way. Recently we
 were robbed by bandits, and I admit that I did twice kill some of them.
 The master was so angry with me that he sent me back and wouldn't let
 me come with him to worship your golden self. The only thing I could do
 was to go back to the Southern Ocean to tell my troubles to Guanyin. I
 never imagined that this evil spirit would make himself look and sound
 just like me, knock the master over, and steal our luggage. My brother
 Friar Sand went to my mountain looking for me and this monster talked a
 whole lot of fancy nonsense about having his own holy monk to go and
 fetch the scriptures. When Friar Sand got away and fled to the Southern
 Ocean to tell the whole story to Guanyin she sent us both back to my
 mountain. After that the two of us, the real me and the impostor side
 by side, fought our way to the Southern Ocean, Heaven, the Tang Priest
 and the Underworld, but nobody could tell which of us was which. That
 is why I've had the effrontery to come here to beg you in your infinite
 charity and mercy to identify me as the true Sun Wukong. Then I'll be
 able to escort the Tang Priest here to worship you in person and fetch
 the scriptures to take back to the East, so that the great teachings
 will be made known for ever.&#8221; Hearing the two of them saying the same
 things in the same voice, none of the host could tell them apart: only
 the Tathagata himself knew. He was just about to expose the impostor
 when a coloured cloud brought Guanyin from the South to see our Buddha.</P>
<P>&#8220;Noble Guanyin,&#8221; said our Buddha, putting his hands together in front
 of his chest, &#8220;can you tell the true Sun the Novice from the false
 one?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I could not tell them apart when they visited my island,&#8221; the
 Bodhisattva replied. &#8220;Since then they have been to Heaven and the
 Underworld, and still nobody could say which was which. That is why I
 have come to beg you, Tathagata, to identify the true Sun Wukong.&#8221;</P>
<P>To this the Buddha replied with a smile, &#8220;You all have very great
 dharma powers, but you can only scan everything that happens under the
 sky. You cannot know all the creatures and categories under the sky.&#8221;
 When the Bodhisattva asked what these categories were, the Buddha
 replied, &#8220;There are five kinds of immortal: heavenly, earthly, divine,
 human and demonic. There are five kinds of beast: snail, scaly, furry,
 feathered and insect. This wretch is not heavenly, earthly, divine,
 human or demonic. He is not a snail, or scaly, or furry, or feathered
 or an insect. Now there are also four kinds of ape that cause confusion
 and don't come under any of the ten categories.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;May I ask what these four kinds of ape are?&#8221; the Bodhisattva asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The first kind is the intelligent stone monkey,&#8221; the Buddha replied.
 &#8220;He can do all kinds of transformation, knows all about the seasons of
 Heaven and earthly advantages, and can move the stars and their
 constellations about. The second kind is the red-rumped mandril that
 knows all about the Yin and the Yang and human affairs, can go into or
 out of anywhere, and knows how to prolong its life and avoid death. The
 third kind is the magic-armed gibbon that can catch the sun or moon,
 shrink mountains, see what is auspicious and what is not, and fool
 around with heaven and earth. The fourth kind is the six-eared macaque
 which has wonderful hearing and perception. It knows about the past and
 the future and understands all creatures. These four kinds of ape do
 not come within any of the ten categories and are not listed among the
 creatures that live between heaven and earth. I can see that the false
 Sun Wukong is just such a six-eared macaque. Wherever he stands he can
 know what is happening hundreds of miles away and hear everything that
 is said. That is why he has such wonderful hearing, brilliant
 perception, and knowledge of the past, the future, and all beings; that
 is why he looks and sounds just like Wukong. He is a six-eared
 macaque.&#8221;</P>
<P>As soon as the macaque heard the Tathagata Buddha say who he really
 was, he started shaking with fear and took a great leap to get away.
 The Tathagata at once ordered his hosts to strike, and the macaque was
 immediately surrounded by the four Bodhisattvas, eight vajrapanis, five
 hundred arhats, three thousand protectors, and all the monks, nuns and
 lay people, as well as Guanyin and Moksa. The Great Sage Monkey rushed
 forward too.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't hit him, Wukong,&#8221; said the Tathagata. &#8220;I shall capture him for
 you.&#8221; The macaque's fur stood on end as he realized that there would be
 no escape, so he shook himself and turned straight into a bee who
 started to fly straight up, only to fall down again as the Tathagata's
 golden begging bowl was clapped over him. The host all thought he had
 got away. &#8220;Stop talking,&#8221; said the Buddha with a smile. &#8220;The evil
 spirit has not escaped. He is under my bowl.&#8221; They all surged forward
 to see him in his true form of a six-eared macaque as the bowl was
 lifted.</P>
<P>The Great Sage could not restrain himself. Swinging his iron cudgel
 he killed the demon with a single blow to the head, and that is why
 this species is now extinct. It was more than the Tathagata could bear.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is terrible,&#8221; he said, &#8220;this is terrible.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You shouldn't be sorry for him,&#8221; said the Great Sage. &#8220;He wounded my
 master and stole our bundles. According to the law he should get his
 head cut off for wounding in the course of theft and daylight robbery.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Go back at once to escort the Tang Priest here to fetch the
 scriptures,&#8221; said the Tathagata.</P>
<P>The Great Sage kowtowed to him in thanks and said, &#8220;I wish to report
 to the Tathagata that my master definitely refuses to have me. The
 journey would be a lot of trouble for nothing. I beg you in your
 kindness, Tathagata, to say the Band-loosening Spell. Then I can take
 this gold band off and give it back to you, and you can let me return
 to lay life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop those silly ideas and behave yourself,&#8221; said the Tathagata. &#8220;I
 shall send Guanyin to take you back to him. Of course he'll accept you.
 Protect him well, and when you succeed and reach ultimate bliss there
 will be a place on a lotus throne for you too.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the Bodhisattva Guanyin heard this she put her hands together to
 thank him for his mercy then took Wukong off by cloud followed by Moksa
 and the white parrot. They were soon back at the thatched cottage by
 the road. As soon as Friar Sand saw them he hurried out to ask the
 master to greet the Bodhisattva at the door.</P>
<P>&#8220;Tang Priest,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it was a six-eared macaque pretending to be
 Wukong who hit you the other day. Fortunately the Tathagata could tell
 who he was, and Wukong has now killed him. You must now take Wukong
 back. There are many demon obstacles on the way ahead and you must have
 his protection if you are to reach Vulture Peak, see the Buddha and
 fetch the scriptures, so stop being angry with him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I shall respectfully obey,&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>Just as he was kowtowing in thanks there was the roar of a whirlwind
 from the East carrying Pig with the two bundles on his back. Seeing the
 Bodhisattva the idiot kowtowed to her and said, &#8220;Your disciple left the
 master the other day and went back to the Water Curtain Cave on the
 Mountain of Flowers and Fruit to look for this luggage. I found the
 imitation Tang Priest and imitation Pig and killed the pair of them.
 They were both monkeys. Then I went inside and found the bundles.
 Nothing's missing&#8212;I've checked them over. So I came straight back by
 wind. What happened to the two Monkeys?&#8221;</P>
<P>The Bodhisattva then told him how the Tathagata had told the two of
 them apart. The idiot was delighted and gave thanks at great length.
 Master and disciples then said farewell to the Bodhisattva, who went
 back to the sea. The four of them were now once more of a single will
 and a single mind; all grievances had been washed away and anger
 removed. They thanked their hosts in the thatched cottage, retied the
 luggage, saddled up the horse, and headed West. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A separation on the journey muddled the Five Elements;</P>
<P>At the demon-subduing gathering enlightenment returned.</P>
<P>The spirit returned to the house of the mind and dhyana was calmed;</P>
<P>When the six perceptions were controlled the elixir was completed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know how long it was till Sanzang saw the Buddha and
 asked for the scriptures after setting out again listen to the
 explanation in the next installment.</P>

</I>
<P>Sanzang's Way Is Blocked at the Fiery Mountains</P>
<P>Monkey First Tries to Borrow the Plantain Fan</P>
</B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The many species are at root the same;</P>
<P>All flows into the boundless sea.</P>
<P>Every thought and worry is in vain;</P>
<P>All types and forms together blend.</P>
<P>When the achievement is complete</P>
<P>Great will be the full and shining dharma.</P>
<P>Do not allow your differences to divide:</P>
<P>Keep everything together.</P>
<P>Gather all into the elixir furnace,</P>
<P>Refine it till it is red as darkest gold.</P>
<P>Then in its brilliance and beauty</P>
<P>On dragons it may ride at will.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story tells how Sanzang took back Brother Monkey as the
 Bodhisattva had instructed him and headed towards the Western Heaven,
 united in heart with Pig and Friar Sand. They were no longer in two
 minds, and the ape and the horse were firmly under control. Time shot
 by like an arrow; days and nights alternated with the speed of a
 shuttle. After the scorching heat of summer they were now in the frosts
 of late autumn. What they saw was:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The sparse clouds blown away by the wild West wind,</P>
<P>Cranes calling in the distant hills amid the frosty woods.</P>
<P>This is a chilly time</P>
<P>When mountain rivers seem longer than ever.</P>
<P>The swan returns through the Northern frontier passes;</P>
<P>Migrating birds go back to their Southern fields.</P>
<P>The traveler feels lonely on the road;</P>
<P>Monastic robes do not keep out the cold.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As master and disciples pressed ahead they began to feel hotter and
 hotter in the warm air. &#8220;It is autumn now, so why is it getting hotter
 again?&#8221; Sanzang asked, reining in his horse.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't know,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;There's a country in the West, Sihali, where
 the sun sets. People call it 'the end of the sky'. At about six o'clock
 every evening the king sends people on the city walls to band drums and
 blow bugles to cover the sound of the sea boiling. That's because when
 the fire of the sun falls into the Western Ocean there's a great
 seething noise like something burning being plunged into water. If they
 didn't cover the noise with their drums and bugles the shock would kill
 all the little children in the city. That's where I think we are&#8212;the
 place where the sun sets.&#8221; When the Great Sage heard this he could not
 help laughing.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't talk such nonsense, you idiot. We're a long way from Sihali
 yet. The way our master keeps dithering and changing his mind we won't
 get there in three lifetimes, even if we go on from childhood to old
 age, then to childhood again, and then to another old age and a third
 childhood.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Tell me then, brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;if this isn't where the sun sets
 why's it so scorching hot?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The seasons must be out of joint,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;I expect
 they're following summer rituals here although it's autumn.&#8221; Just as
 the three disciples were arguing they saw a farm by the side of the
 road. It had a red tiled roof, red brick walls, and red painted doors,
 windows and furniture. It was red everywhere.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said Sanzang, dismounting, &#8220;go to that house and find out
 why it's so burning hot.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Great Sage put his gold-banded cudgel away, neatened his clothes,
 and swaggered along the road like a fine gentleman. When he reached the
 gate to have a look an old man suddenly appeared from inside. This is
 what he looked like:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He wore a robe of hemp-cloth,</P>
<P>Not quite brown or red,</P>
<P>A sunhat of woven bamboo,</P>
<P>In between black and green.</P>
<P>The knobby stick in his hand</P>
<P>Was neither crooked nor straight.</P>
<P>His long boots of leather</P>
<P>Were not new, but not yet old.</P>
<P>His face was the color of copper,</P>
<P>His beard bleached white like yarn.</P>
<P>Long eyebrows shaded his jade-blue eyes</P>
<P>And his smile showed golden teeth.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The old man had a shock when he looked up to see Monkey. &#8220;Where are
 you from, you freak?&#8221; he asked, steadying himself on his stick. &#8220;What
 are you doing at my gate?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Venerable patron,&#8221; replied Monkey with a bow, &#8220;don't be afraid. I'm
 no freak. My master and we three disciples have been sent by the Great
 Tang emperor in the East to fetch the scriptures from the West. As
 we've now reached your residence I have come to ask you why it's so
 boiling hot here and what this place is called.&#8221;</P>
<P>Only then did the old man stop feeling worried and reply with a
 smile, &#8220;Please don't take offence, reverend sir. My old eyes are rather
 dim and I failed to recognize your distinguished self.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no need to be so polite,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Which road is your
 master on?&#8221; the old man asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;That's him, standing on the main road due South,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Ask him over, ask him over,&#8221; the old man replied, to Monkey's
 pleasure. Monkey waved to them, and Sanzang came over with Pig and
 Friar Sand leading the white horse and carrying the luggage. They all
 bowed to the old man.</P>
<P>The old man was at the same time delighted by Sanzang's fine
 appearance and alarmed by Pig's and Friar Sand's remarkable ugliness.
 Inviting them in, he told the younger members of the family to bring
 tea and cook a meal. Hearing all this Sanzang rose to his feet to thank
 the old man and ask, &#8220;Could you tell me, sir, why it has turned so hot
 again although it is autumn now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;These are the Fiery Mountains,&#8221; the old man replied. &#8220;We don't have
 springs or autumns here. It's hot all the year round.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are the mountains?&#8221; Sanzang asked. &#8220;Do they block the way to
 the West?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's impossible to get to the West,&#8221; the old man replied. &#8220;The
 mountains are about twenty miles from here. You have to cross them to
 get to the West, but they're over 250 miles of flame. Not a blade of
 grass can grow anywhere around. Even if you had a skull of bronze and a
 body of iron you would melt trying to cross them.&#8221; This answer made
 Sanzang turn pale with horror; he dared not to ask any more questions.</P>
<P>Just then a young man pushing a red barrow stopped by the gate,
 shouting, &#8220;Cakes! Cakes!&#8221; The Great Sage pulled out one of his hairs
 and turned it into a copper coin with which he bought a cake off the
 young man. The man accepted the money and without a worry he lifted the
 cover off his barrow to release a cloud of hot steam, took out a cake
 and passed it to Monkey. When Monkey took it in his hand it was as hot
 as a burning coal or a red-hot nail in a furnace.</P>
<P>Just look at him as he keeps tossing the cake from one hand to
 another shouting, &#8220;It's hot, it's hot, I can't eat it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you can't stand heat don't come here,&#8221; the young man replied.
 &#8220;It's always this hot here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't understand at all, my lad,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;As the saying
 goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If it's never too cold and it's never too hot</P>
<P>The five kinds of grain will be harvested not.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;If it's so hot here how do you get the flour to make your cakes?&#8221; To
 this the young man said,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;You ask me where we can obtain the flour for the pan:</P>
<P>Politely we request it from Immortal Iron Fan.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;What can you tell me about this immortal?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The immortal has a plantain fan,&#8221; the young man replied. &#8220;If you ask
 it to, the fan puts out the fire at the first wave, makes a wind blow
 at the second wave, and brings rain at the third wave. That is how we
 can sow and reap the crops to support ourselves. Without it nothing
 would be able to grow.&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing this Monkey rushed back inside, gave the cakes to Sanzang,
 and said, &#8220;Don't worry, Master: Don't get upset about what's going to
 happen the year after next. East these cakes up and I'll tell you all
 about it.&#8221; Sanzang took the cakes and said to the old man, &#8220;Please have
 a cake, sir.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I could not possibly eat one of your cakes before we've offered you
 any of our tea and food,&#8221; the old man replied. &#8220;Sir,&#8221; Monkey replied,
 &#8220;there's no need to give us food or tea. But could you tell me where
 the Iron Fan Immortal lives?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you want to know about the immortal for?&#8221; the old man asked.
 &#8220;The cake-seller told me just now that the immortal has a plantain
 fan,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;If you borrow it the first wave puts the fire out,
 the second raises a wind and the third brings rain. That's why you're
 able to sow and reap the crops to support yourselves. I want to go to
 ask the immortal to come so we can put out the flames on the Fiery
 Mountains and cross them. And you'll be able to sow, reap and live in
 peace.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's a nice idea,&#8221; said the old man, &#8220;but as you have no presents
 the immortal wouldn't come.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What sort of presents would be wanted?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Every ten years,&#8221; the old man replied, &#8220;we go to visit the immortal.
 We take four pigs and four sheep, all decorated with flowers and red
 ribbons, delicious fruit in season, chickens, geese and the best wine.
 We bathe ourselves and go very reverently to pay a respectful visit to
 the mountain and ask the immortal to leave the cave and come here to
 perform magic.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where is this mountain?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;What's it called? How far is
 it from here? I'm going there to ask for the fan.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It lies Southwest of here,&#8221; the old man said, &#8220;and it's called Mount
 Turquoise Cloud. When we believers go to worship at the magic mountain
 the journey takes us a month as it's about 485 miles altogether.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No problem,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I can be there and back in no time.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wait a minute,&#8221; said the old man. &#8220;Have something to eat and drink
 first, and we'll get some provisions ready for the journey. You'll need
 two people to go with you. Nobody lives along the way and there are
 many wolves and tigers. It'll take you many a day to get there. You
 must be serious about it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No need,&#8221; said Monkey with a laugh, &#8220;no need. I'm off.&#8221; As soon as
 he had said that he disappeared.</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord!&#8221; the old man said in astonishment. &#8220;He's a god who can ride
 clouds.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We shall say no more of how the family redoubled their offerings to
 the Tang Priest, but tell of Monkey, who arrived at Mount Turquoise
 Cloud in an instant, brought his auspicious light to a stop and started
 looking for the entrance to the cave. He heard the sound of an axe and
 saw a woodcutter felling a tree in the forest on the mountainside.
 Hurrying forward, Monkey heard him saying.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;I recognize the ancient woods amid the clouds;</P>
<P>The path is overgrown; the hillside steep.</P>
<P>From Western hills I see the morning rain;</P>
<P>Returning to the South the ford's too deep.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Going closer to the woodman Monkey said, &#8220;Greetings, woodman.&#8221;
 Putting down his axe the woodcutter returned his courtesy and asked him
 where he was going. &#8220;May I ask if this is Mount Turquoise Cloud?&#8221; said
 Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the woodcutter replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where is the Iron Fan Immortal's Plantain Cave?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;There's a Plantain Cave here,&#8221; the woodcutter replied, &#8220;but no Iron
 Fan Immortal, only a Princess Iron Fan. She's also called Raksasi.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They say the immortal has a plantain fan that can put out the flames
 of the Fiery Mountains. Is that her?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; the woodman said. &#8220;She's a sage and she has this treasure
 that puts out fire. Because she protects the people who live over
 yonder they call her the Iron Fan Immortal. We have no need of her
 here, so we just call her Raksasi. She's the wife of the Bull Demon
 King.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey went pale with shock at the news. &#8220;Another person who's got it
 in for me,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;When I subdued the Red Boy the other year he
 said this bitch was his mother. When I met the Red Boy's uncle at
 Childfree Cave on Mount Offspring Dissolved he refused me the water and
 wanted revenge. Now I'm up against his parents. How am I ever going to
 borrow the fan?&#8221;</P>
<P>Seeing Monkey deep in thought and sighing endlessly, the woodcutter
 said with a smile, &#8220;Venerable sir, you're a man of religion. You
 shouldn't have any worries. Just follow this path East and you'll be at
 the Plantain Cave within a couple of miles.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll be frank with you, woodcutter,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'm the senior
 disciple of the Tang Priest who has been sent by the Tang emperor in
 the East to go to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven. The
 other year I had words with Raksasi's son Red Boy at the Fire-cloud
 Cave, and I'm afraid that Raksasi may refuse to let me have the fan
 because she's still nursing a grudge. That's why I'm worried.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;A real man knows how to play it by ear,&#8221; the woodcutter replied.
 &#8220;Just ask for the fan. Forget about your old quarrel. I'm sure you'll
 be able to borrow it.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey made a respectful chant and said, &#8220;Thank you very much for
 your advice. I'm off.&#8221;</P>
<P>Brother Monkey then took his leave of the woodcutter and went
 straight to the mouth of the Plantain Cave. Both doors were tightly
 shut, and the scenery outside was magnificent. It was a splendid place.
 Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The rocks were the hones of the mountain,</P>
<P>And also the spirit of the earth.</P>
<P>Clouds at sunset held night rain,</P>
<P>And mosses lent the freshness of their green.</P>
<P>The towering peaks outdid those of Penglai;</P>
<P>The fragrant calm was like a magic island's.</P>
<P>Wild cranes were perching in the lofty pines</P>
<P>While warblers sang in the weeping willows.</P>
<P>This was indeed an ancient site,</P>
<P>The home of immortals for ten thousand years.</P>
<P>The resplendent phoenix sang in the parasol trees</P>
<P>While azure dragons hid in the running waters.</P>
<P>Vines hung over the winding paths,</P>
<P>And creepers covered the steps of stone.</P>
<P>Apes on the cliffs screeched to welcome the rising moon;</P>
<P>In tall trees birds sang for joy at the clear blue sky.</P>
<P>The groves of bamboo were as cool as if it had rained;</P>
<P>The flowers along the path were embroidered velvet.</P>
<P>At times a cloud of white would blow from a distant peak;</P>
<P>It had no single form as it drifted in the wind.</P>
<P>&#8220;Open up, Brother Bull,&#8221; Monkey shouted as he went up to the doors.
 They opened with a creak, and out came a young girl carrying a flower
 basket in her hand and hoe over her shoulder. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Though clad in rags and dressed in no fine array,</P>
<P>Her face was full of spirit, her heart set on the Way.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey went up to her with his hands together in front of his chest
 and said, &#8220;Would you kindly tell the princess that I'm a monk going to
 the West to fetch the scriptures. I'm here to beg the loan of her
 plantain fan as we can't get across the Fiery Mountains.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What monastery are you from,&#8221; the girl asked, &#8220;and what is your
 name? Please tell me so that I can announce you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm from the East,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and my name is Sun Wukong.&#8221;</P>
<P>The girl went back into the cave, knelt to the princess, and said,
 &#8220;Your Highness, there's a monk from the East called Sun Wukong outside
 who would like to see you to ask for the loan of the plantain fan to
 cross the Fiery Mountains.&#8221; The name Sun Wukong was like a pinch of
 salt thrown into a flame, or oil poured on a fire. Her face went bright
 red and evil anger flared up in her heart.</P>
<P>&#8220;So that damned monkey's here at last,&#8221; she said with hatred. &#8220;Girl,&#8221;
 she shouted, &#8220;fetch me my armor and my weapons.&#8221; She then put on her
 armor, tied her pair of blue-tipped swords at her waist, fastened it
 all firmly, and went out. Monkey slipped over to the entrance to see
 what she looked like and this is what he saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A flowered kerchief tied around her head,</P>
<P>A cloud-patterned robe of quilted brocade.</P>
<P>A belt of two tiger sinews round her waist,</P>
<P>Revealing a skirt of embroidered silk.</P>
<P>Her shoes like phoenix beaks were but three inches long;</P>
<P>Her trousers in dragon-beard style were adorned with gold.</P>
<P>Brandishing her swords she gave out angry shouts;</P>
<P>She looked as lethal as the goddess of the moon.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where's Sun Wukong?&#8221; Raksasi shouted as she came out of her cave.</P>
<P>Monkey stepped forward, bowed, and replied, &#8220;Monkey offers his
 respectful greetings, sister-in-law.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm no sister-in-law of yours,&#8221; she shouted angrily, &#8220;and I'll have
 no greetings from you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your worthy husband the Bull Demon King was once my sworn brother,&#8221;
 Monkey replied. &#8220;There were seven of us altogether. As I learn that you
 are my brother Bull's good lady, of course I must call you
 sister-in-law.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Damned ape,&#8221; said Raksasi, &#8220;if you're my husband's sworn brother why
 did you have to do that terrible thing to our boy?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Who is your son?&#8221; Monkey asked, as if he did not know.</P>
<P>&#8220;He's the Red Boy, the Boy Sage King of the Fire-cloud Cave by
 Withered Pine Ravine on Mount Hao,&#8221; Raksasi replied. &#8220;You ruined him,
 and now you've come to our door to pay with your life. We've been
 longing to get our revenge on you but didn't know where to find you.
 You'll get no mercy from me.&#8221;</P>
<P>Putting on the broadest of smiles, Monkey replied, &#8220;You haven't gone
 into it thoroughly enough, sister-in-law. You've no reason to be so
 angry with me Your good son had captured my master and would have
 steamed or boiled him if the Bodhisattva hadn't taken the boy as his
 disciple and rescued my master. He's now the page Sudhana on the
 Bodhisattva's island and he's accepted the pursuit of the true reward
 from her. He is now beyond life and death and above filth and purity.
 He will live as long as heaven, earth, the sun and the moon. But far
 from thanking me for saving his life you're getting angry at me. That's
 wrong of you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You smooth-tongued ape,&#8221; Raksasi snapped back. &#8220;My boy may be alive,
 but when is he ever going to come here? When am I going to see him
 again?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It'll be easy for you to see your son again,&#8221; Monkey replied, still
 smiling. &#8220;Just lend me the fan to put the fires out. When I've taken my
 master across the mountains I'll go to the Bodhisattava's place in the
 Southern Ocean and ask him to come here to see you and give your fan
 back. No problem. Then you'll be able to see that he's completely
 unharmed. If he'd been wounded at all you'd have had every right to be
 angry with me. But he's as handsome as ever. You ought to be thanking
 me.&#8221;</P>
<P>To this Raksasi's reply was: &#8220;Shut up, ape fiend! Stick your head out
 for me to hack with my sword. If you can stand the pain I'll lend you
 the plantain fan. If you can't you'll be going straight down to Hell to
 see King Yama.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey then clasped his hands together in front of him and replied
 with a smile, &#8220;Enough said, sister-in-law. I'll stretch my bald head
 out and you can take as many hacks as you like until you're exhausted.
 But you must lend me the fan.&#8221; With no more argument Raksasi swung both
 of her swords around and brought them down with loud thunks a dozen or
 more times on Monkey's head. He was not bothered at all. Raksasi was so
 frightened by this that she turned to run away.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you going, sister-in-law?&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;Hurry up and lend
 me that fan.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My treasure isn't something to be lent out casually,&#8221; Raksasi
 replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;if you refuse now you'll just have to try a
 taste of your brother-in-law's cudgel.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Monkey King held on to her with one hand while pulling
 his cudgel out from his ear with the other. With one wave it became as
 thick as a ricebowl. Raksasi broke free from his grip and raised her
 swords to strike back at him. Monkey started swinging his cudgel to hit
 her with and the fight began in front of Mount Turquoise Cloud. All
 talk of kinship was forgotten and their minds full of hatred alone. It
 was a fine battle:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The woman had worked hard to make herself a monster;</P>
<P>She loathed the ape and would avenge her son.</P>
<P>Although Monkey was seething with fury,</P>
<P>He would have made concessions for his master's sake.</P>
<P>First he had asked to borrow the plantain fan,</P>
<P>Being patient and gentle, not fierce.</P>
<P>In ignorance Raksasi hacked with her sword,</P>
<P>While Monkey decided to speak of kinship.</P>
<P>Women should never fight with men,</P>
<P>For men are harder and can crush them.</P>
<P>Terrible was the gold-banded cudgel,</P>
<P>Fine were the movements of the blue frost-bladed sword,</P>
<P>With blows to face and head,</P>
<P>As both of them grimly refused to yield.</P>
<P>Blocking to left and right they used their martial skill;</P>
<P>Great was the cunning with which they stood or fell back.</P>
<P>Just when they both were beginning to enjoy themselves</P>
<P>The sun set in the Western sky before they noticed.</P>
<P>Raksasi made ghosts and deities feel small</P>
<P>With many a wave of her true magic fan.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Raksasi and Monkey fought it out till evening. As Monkey's cudgel
 struck so hard and his technique was so flawless she realized that she
 would never be able to beat him. She brought out her plantain fan and
 with a single wave blew Monkey right out of sight. There was no way he
 could stand his ground. With that she went back to her cave in triumph.</P>
<P>The Great Sage was thrown around in the air, unable to come down to
 earth or find any refuge. He was like a dead leaf in a whirlwind or a
 fallen blossom carried along by a torrent.</P>
<P>Only after a whole night's buffeting did he manage to land on a
 mountain the next morning and hold on hard to a rock by putting both
 arms round it. He needed a long time to calm himself and take a good
 look around before he realized that he was on Little Mount Sumeru.</P>
<P>&#8220;What a terrible woman,&#8221; he said to himself with a deep sigh. &#8220;How
 ever did she get me here? I remember coming here once to ask the
 Bodhisattva Lingji to subdue the Yellow Wind Monster and rescue my
 master. The Yellow Wind Ridge is over a thousand miles South of here,
 so as I've been blown back from the West I must have come thousands and
 thousands of miles. I'll go down and find out some more from the
 Bodhisattva Lingji before I go back.&#8221;</P>
<P>Just as he was making his mind up he heard a resounding gong, so he
 hurried down the mountain and straight to the dhyana monastery. The lay
 brother on the gate recognized Monkey and went in to announce, &#8220;The
 hairy-faced Great Sage who asked the Bodhisattva to subdue the Yellow
 Wind Monster some years back is here again.&#8221;</P>
<P>Realizing that this must be Sun Wukong, the Bodhisattva hurried down
 from his throne to greet him and lead him inside with the words, &#8220;Allow
 me to congratulate you. I suppose you have fetched the scriptures now.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It'll be a long time yet,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;a long time.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But why are you visiting my mountain if you have yet to reach the
 Thunder Monastery?&#8221; the Bodhisattva asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Since in your great kindness you subdued the Yellow Wind Monster for
 me some years ago,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;goodness only knows how much we've
 suffered on our journey. Now we are at the Fiery Mountains, but we
 can't cross them. When I asked the local people they told me about an
 Iron Fan Immortal who had an iron fan that could put the fires out. I
 went to visit the immortal, only to discover that she's the wife of the
 Bull Demon King and the Red Boy's mother. I told her that her son is
 now Guanyin Bodhisattva's page, but she has it in for me because she
 can't see him. She refused to lend me her fan and fought me. When she
 realized that my cudgel was too much for her she waved her fan and sent
 me hurling through the air till I landed here. That's why I've come
 blundering into your monastery to ask the way back. How far is it from
 here to the Fiery Mountains?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The woman is called Raksasi, or Princess Iron Fan,&#8221; replied Lingji
 with a smile. &#8220;That plantain fan of hers is a miraculous treasure
 formed by heaven and earth behind Mount Kunlun ever since primal chaos
 was first separated. This leaf is the very essence of the negative Yin
 principle, which is why it can put out fire. If she fans somebody with
 it he'll be blown 27,000 miles before that negative wind drops. But
 this mountain of mine is only some 17,000 miles from the Fiery
 Mountains. You must have stopped here because you have the power to
 delay clouds, Great Sage. No ordinary mortal would have been able to
 stop.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;She's terrible,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;How ever is my master going to get
 across those mountains?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry, Great Sage,&#8221; Lingji replied. &#8220;The Tang Priest is fated
 to succeed on this journey with you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you tell?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;Many years age when the Tathagata
 gave me his instructions,&#8221; Lingji replied, &#8220;he presented me with a
 Wind-fixing Pill and a Flying Dragon Staff. The Flying Dragon Staff was
 used to subdue the Yellow Wind Monster, but I haven't yet tried out the
 Wind-fixing Pill and I'll give it to you today. It'll stop the fan from
 being able to move you. You'll just have to ask to get it and put the
 fire out with it. You'll have an instant success.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey bowed deeply and expressed profound thanks. The Bodhisattva
 then produced a brocade bag from his sleeve and took out of it the
 Wind-fixing Pill. This he gave to Monkey to sew up securely inside the
 lapel of his tunic. &#8220;I won't detain you here any longer,&#8221; Lingji said
 as he saw Monkey out through doors. &#8220;Head Northwest and that will get
 you to Raksasi's mountain.&#8221;</P>
<P>Taking his leave of Lingji Monkey rode his somersault cloud straight
 back to Mount Turquoise Cloud and was there in a moment. &#8220;Open up, open
 up!&#8221; he shouted, hammering on the doors with his iron cudgel. &#8220;Monkey's
 here to borrow the fan.&#8221;</P>
<P>This so alarmed the servant girl inside the doors that she ran back
 and reported, &#8220;Your Highness, he's here to borrow the fan again.&#8221; The
 news frightened Raksasi, who thought, &#8220;That damned monkey really has
 got some powers. If I fan anyone else with my treasure they go 27,000
 miles before stopping. How can he be back so soon after being blown
 away? This time I'll fan him two or three times and he'll never be able
 to find his way back here.&#8221;</P>
<P>She sprang to her feet, tied all her armor firmly on, and went out of
 the cave with her swords in her hands shouting, &#8220;Sun the Novice, aren't
 you afraid of me? Why have you come back here to get yourself killed?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be so stingy, sister-in-law,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile.
 &#8220;You've got to lend me it. I'll bring it back as soon as I've escorted
 the Tang Priest across the Fiery Mountains. I give you my word as a
 gentleman. I'm not the sort of low creature who borrows things but
 doesn't give them back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Damned macaque,&#8221; Raksasi shouted back. &#8220;You're outrageous, and you
 understand nothing. I've got to avenge the loss of my son, so how could
 I possibly be prepared to lend you my fan? Clear off if you don't want
 a taste of my sword.&#8221; The Great Sage, not at all afraid, struck back at
 her hands with his iron cudgel, and the two of them fought six or seven
 rounds. By then Raksasi's arms were becoming too tired to wield the
 swords, while Brother Monkey was feeling strong and fighting well.
 Seeing that the balance of the fight was tilting against her, Raksasi
 took out the fan and fanned it once in Monkey's direction.</P>
<P>He stood unmoved, put his iron cudgel away, and said with a chuckle,
 &#8220;This time it's different. Fan as much as you like. If I move an inch
 I'm no man.&#8221; She fanned twice more and still he did not move. By now
 she was so alarmed that she put her pride and joy away at once, went
 straight back into the cave, and shut the doors firmly.</P>
<P>When Monkey saw this he used magic. He tore the lapel of his tunic
 open, put the Wind-fixing Pill in his mouth, shook himself, turned into
 the tiniest of insects, and squeezed in through the crack between the
 doors, where he saw Raksasi shouting, &#8220;I'm thirsty, I'm thirsty. Quick,
 bring me some tea.&#8221; The servant girl who attended her fetched a pot of
 the best tea and poured a large cup of it so noisily that the surface
 was frothy. Monkey was delighted. With a quiet buzz of his wings he
 flew under the froth. Raksasi was so parched that she drained the tea
 in two gulps.</P>
<P>Once inside her stomach Monkey reverted to his own form and shouted
 at the top of his voice, &#8220;Sister-in-law, lend me the fan.&#8221;</P>
<P>Raksasi went pale with shock. &#8220;Little ones,&#8221; she called to her
 underlings, &#8220;are the front doors shut?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; they all said.</P>
<P>&#8220;If the doors are shut then how can Sun the Novice be inside the cave
 and shouting?&#8221; she asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;He's shouting from inside you,&#8221; the servant girl replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you playing your conjuring tricks, Sun the Novice?&#8221;
 Raksasi asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I've never been able to do conjuring tricks in all my life,&#8221; Monkey
 replied. &#8220;My magic and my powers are all real. I'm fooling around in
 your own in-sides, good sister-in-law. I've just seen your lungs and
 your liver. I know you're very hungry and thirsty, so I'll give you a
 bowlful to quench your thirst.&#8221; With that he stamped his foot, giving
 Raksasi an unbearable cramp in her stomach that left her sitting
 groaning on the floor. &#8220;Don't try to say no, sister-in-law,&#8221; Monkey
 then said. &#8220;I'm giving you a pastry in case you're hungry.&#8221; He butted
 upwards, causing such a violent heart pain that she could only roll
 around on the ground, her face sallow and her lips white from agony.</P>
<P>&#8220;Spare me, brother-in-law, spare me,&#8221; was all she could say.</P>
<P>Only then did Monkey stop hitting and kicking. &#8220;So you call me
 brother-in-law now, do you?&#8221; he said. &#8220;I'll spare your life for my
 brother Bull's sake. Get me the fan, and quick.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You shall have it, brother-in-law, you shall have it,&#8221; she said.
 &#8220;Come out and get it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Fetch it and show it to me,&#8221; Monkey said. She told the servant girl
 to fetch a plantain fan and stand holding it beside her. Monkey poked
 his head up her throat to see it and said, &#8220;As I'm sparing your life,
 sister-in-law, I won't smash my way out under your ribs. I'll come out
 through your mouth. Open wide three times.&#8221; With that Raksasi opened
 her mouth and Monkey turned back into the tiny insect to fly out and
 alight on the fan. Not realizing what had happened Raksasi went on to
 open her mouth twice more.</P>
<P>&#8220;Come out, brother-in-law,&#8221; she said.</P>
<P>Monkey turned back into himself, took the fan and said, &#8220;Here I am.
 Thanks for the loan.&#8221; With that he strode forward while the underlings
 opened the doors to let him out of the cave.</P>
<P>The Great Sage then turned his cloud around and headed back East. A
 moment later he had landed the cloud and was standing by the red brick
 wall. Pig was very pleased indeed to see him. &#8220;Master,&#8221; he said,
 &#8220;Monkey's here! He's back!&#8221; Sanzang went out with the old man of the
 farm and Friar Sand to greet him, and they all went back inside.</P>
<P>Propping the fan against the wall, Monkey asked, &#8220;Tell me sir, is
 this the fan?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; the old man said.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is a great achievement, disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;Fetching this
 treasure must have cost you a great deal of trouble.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No trouble at all,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Do you know who that Iron Fan
 Immortal is? She's Raksasi, the wife of the Bull Demon King and the Red
 Boy's mother. Her other name is Princess Iron Fan. I found her outside
 her cave and asked to borrow the fan, but all she could talk of were
 her old grudges. She took a few cuts at me with her swords, but when I
 gave her a bit of a scare with the cudgel she fanned me with the fan
 and blew me all the way to Little Mount Sumeru. I was lucky enough to
 be able to see the Bodhisattva Lingji who gave me a tablet that stops
 winds and showed me the way back to Mount Turquoise Cloud. Then I saw
 Raksasi again, but this time her fan did not move me an inch, so she
 went back into her cave and I turned into a tiny insect to fly back in
 after her. When the damned woman-asked for some tea I slipped in under
 the froth at the top, got inside her, and started giving her a few
 punches and kicks. She couldn't take the pain. She kept saying, 'Spare
 me, brother-in-law, spare me.' As she agreed to lend me the fan I
 spared her life and took the fan. I'll give it back to her after we've
 crossed the Fiery Mountains.&#8221; When Sanzang heard this he was extremely
 grateful.</P>
<P>Master and disciples then took their leave of the old man and
 traveled about fifteen miles West. The heat was becoming unbearable.
 &#8220;The soles of my feet are being roasted,&#8221; Friar Sand complained.</P>
<P>&#8220;My trotters are getting burnt and it hurts,&#8221; said Pig. The horse was
 going much faster than usual too. The ground was so hot that they could
 not stop, but every step was painful.</P>
<P>&#8220;Please dismount, Master,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;and brothers, stay here
 while I use the fan to put the fire out. When the wind and the rain
 come the ground will be a lot cooler and we'll be able to get across
 the mountains.&#8221; He then raised the fan and fanned it hard once in the
 direction of the fire: tongues of flame rose above the mountains. He
 fanned again, and they were a hundred times as high. He fanned a third
 time, and now they were a couple of miles high and beginning to burn
 him. Monkey fled, but not before two patches of fur had been burnt
 away. He ran straight back to the Tang Priest and said, &#8220;Hurry back,
 hurry back, the flames are coming.&#8221;</P>
<P>The master remounted and headed back East with Pig and Friar Sand
 some seven miles before stopping and asking, &#8220;What happened, Wukong?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's the wrong one,&#8221; Monkey said, flinging the fan down, &#8220;it's the
 wrong one. The damned woman fooled me.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Sanzang heard this he frowned and felt thoroughly depressed.
 &#8220;What are we to do?&#8221; he sobbed, the tears flowing freely down his
 cheeks.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;why did you come back in such a mad rush and
 send us back here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The first time I fanned there were flames,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;the
 second time the fire got fiercer, and the third time the flames were a
 couple of miles high. If I hadn't run fast all my fur would have been
 burnt off.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But you're always telling us that you can't be hurt by thunder and
 lightning and that fire can't burn you,&#8221; said Pig with a laugh. &#8220;How
 come you're afraid of fire now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Idiot,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you don't understand anything. The other times
 I was ready: that's why I wasn't hurt. Today I didn't make any
 flame-avoiding spells or use magic to defend myself. That's why two
 patches of my fur were singed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If the fire's so fierce and there's no other way to the West what
 are we going to do?&#8221; Friar Sand asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;We'll just have to find somewhere where there isn't any fire,&#8221; Pig
 replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Which way will that be?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;East, North or South: there's no fire those ways,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;But
 which way are the scriptures?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Only in the West,&#8221; Pig replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;I only want to go where the scriptures are,&#8221; Sanzang said.</P>
<P>&#8220;We're well and truly struck,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;Where there are
 scriptures there's fire, and where there's no fire there are no
 scriptures.&#8221;</P>
<P>While master and disciples were talking this nonsense they heard
 someone call, &#8220;Don't get upset, Great Sage. Come and have some
 vegetarian food before you take your discussions any further.&#8221; The four
 of them looked round to see an old man wearing a cloak that floated in
 the wind and a hat the shape of a half moon. In his hand he held a
 dragon-headed stick, and on his legs were boots of iron. With him was a
 demon with the beak of an eagle and the cheeks of a fish carrying on
 his head a copper bowl full of steamed buns, millet cakes, cooked
 millet and rice.</P>
<P>The old man bowed to them on the road to the West and said, &#8220;I am the
 local god of the Fiery Mountains. As I know that you are escorting this
 holy monk, Great Sage, and can't go any further I have brought this
 meal as an offering.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Eating doesn't matter,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;When are these fires going
 to be put out so that my master can cross the mountains?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you want to put the fires out you must first ask Raksasi to lend
 you the plantain fan,&#8221; the local god said. Monkey went to the side of
 the path, picked the fan up, and said, &#8220;This is it, isn't it? The more
 I fan the flames the more fiercely they burn. Why?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Because it's not the real one,&#8221; said the local deity with a laugh
 when he looked at it. &#8220;She fooled you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Then how am I to get the real one?&#8221; Monkey said.</P>
<P>The local god bowed again and had a slight smile on his face as he
 replied, &#8220;If you want to borrow the real plantain fan you will have to
 ask the Strongarm King.&#8221;</P>
<P>If you don't know all about the Strongarm King listen to the
 explanation in the next installment.</P>

</B>
<P>&#8220;The Strongarm King is the Bull Demon King,&#8221; the local god explained.</P>
<P>&#8220;Did he set these mountains ablaze and pretend they were the Fiery
 Mountains?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; the local god replied. &#8220;If you'll promise to forgive me for
 doing so, Great Sage, I'll speak frankly.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What's there to forgive?&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;Speak frankly.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You started this fire, Great Sage,&#8221; the local god replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;That's nonsense,&#8221; said Monkey angrily. &#8220;I wasn't here. Do you take
 me for an arsonist?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't realize who I am,&#8221; the local god said. &#8220;These mountains
 haven't always been here. When you made havoc in Heaven five hundred
 years ago and were captured by the Illustrious Sage Erlang you were
 escorted to Lord Lao Zi, put in the Eight Trigrams Furnace and refined.
 When the furnace was opened you kicked it over, and some of its bricks
 that still had fire in them fell here as the Fiery Mountains. I used to
 be one of the Taoist boys who looked after the furnace in the Tushita
 Palace, but Lord Lao Zi was so angry with me for failing in my duty
 that he sent me down to be the local god here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I was wondering why you were dressed like that,&#8221; said Pig
 forcefully, &#8220;you're a Taoist turned local god.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Tell me why I need to find the Strongarm King,&#8221; said Monkey, only
 half-convinced.</P>
<P>&#8220;He's Raksasi's husband,&#8221; the local god said. &#8220;He's abandoned her now
 and gone to live in the Cloud-touching Cave in Mount Thunder Piled. A
 fox king there who'd lived for ten thousand years died leaving an only
 daughter, Princess Jade, with property worth a million but nobody to
 manage it. Two years ago she visited the Bull Demon King and found out
 about his tremendous magical powers. She decided to give him her
 property if he'd come to live in her cave as her husband. So the Bull
 Demon King abandoned Raksasi and hasn't been back to see her for ages.
 If you can find him, Great Sage, and persuade him to come here you'll
 be able to borrow the real fan. First, you'll be able to blow the
 flames out to take your master across the mountains. Second, you'll put
 an end to this disastrous fire so that the land here can come back to
 life. And third, I'll be pardoned and allowed to go back to Heaven and
 return to live under Lord Lao Zi's command.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where is Mount Thunder Piled, and how far is it from here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Due South,&#8221; the local deity said, &#8220;and over a thousand miles.&#8221; Once
 he knew this Monkey told Friar Sand and Pig to look after the master
 and ordered the local god to stay with them. There was then a roaring
 like the wind as he disappeared.</P>
<P>In less than an hour he saw a high mountain that touched the sky.
 Bringing his cloud down he stood on the peak to look around, and this
 is what he saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Was it tall?</P>
<P>Its peak touched the azure sky.</P>
<P>Was it big?</P>
<P>Its roots went down to the Yellow Springs.</P>
<P>While the sun warmed the front of the mountain</P>
<P>The winds behind the ridge blew cold.</P>
<P>On the sun-warmed front of the mountain</P>
<P>The flowers and trees never knew what winter was;</P>
<P>In the cold winds behind the ridge</P>
<P>The ice and frost did not even melt in summer.</P>
<P>From a dragon pool a river flowed in gullies;</P>
<P>Flowers bloomed early by the tiger's cave in the crag.</P>
<P>The river split into a thousand jade streams;</P>
<P>The flowers bloomed together like brocade.</P>
<P>On the twisting ridge grew twisted trees;</P>
<P>Beside the knotted rocks were knotted pines.</P>
<P>Indeed there were</P>
<P>A high mountain,</P>
<P>Steep ridges,</P>
<P>Sheer precipices,</P>
<P>Fragrant flowers,</P>
<P>Fine fruit,</P>
<P>Red creepers,</P>
<P>Purple bamboo,</P>
<P>Green pines,</P>
<P>Turquoise willows.</P>
<P>It looked the same throughout the seasons;</P>
<P>Changeless forever, like a dragon.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After looking for a long time the Great Sage walked down from the
 towering peak to find his way through the mountain. Just when he was
 feeling bewildered a slender young woman came towards him holding a
 spray of fragrant orchid. The Great Sage slipped behind a grotesque
 rock and took a good look at her. This is what she was like:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A ravishing beauty to enchant a nation</P>
<P>Walking so slowly on her little lotus feet.</P>
<P>Her face was like Wang Qiang or the woman of Chu.</P>
<P>She was a talking flower,</P>
<P>Scented jade.</P>
<P>The hair was swept down from her coiffure like jade-blue crows;</P>
<P>The green of her eyes made one think of autumn floods.</P>
<P>Her silken skirt showed a glimpse of tiny feet;</P>
<P>From her turquoise sleeves came long and elegant wrists.</P>
<P>She would put anyone into the mood for love;</P>
<P>Red were her lips, and white her pearly teeth.</P>
<P>Her skin was as smooth and her brows as fine as the Jinjiang beauty;</P>
<P>She was more than a match for Wenjun or Xue Tao.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As the young woman slowly approached the rock the Great Sage bowed to
 her and said, &#8220;Where are you going, Bodhisattva?&#8221; Before he spoke she
 had not noticed him; but when she looked up and saw how hideous the
 Great Sage was she was petrified, unable to move forward or back.</P>
<P>All she could do was shiver and force herself to reply, &#8220;Where are
 you from? How dare you question me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If I tell her about fetching the scriptures and borrowing the fan,&#8221;
 the Great Sage thought, &#8220;this damn woman might be some relation of the
 Bull Demon King's. I'd better pretend to be some kinsman of the Bull
 Demon King come to invite him to a banquet.&#8221;</P>
<P>When he would not answer her questions the woman turned angry and
 shouted, &#8220;Who are you and how dare you question me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm from Mount Turquoise Cloud,&#8221; Monkey replied with a bow and a
 forced smile. &#8220;I don't know the way as it's my first time here. Could I
 ask you, Bodhisattva, if this is Mount Thunder Piled?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It is,&#8221; she replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where might I find the Cloud-touching Cave?&#8221; the Great Sage asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you want to find it for?&#8221; the woman asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I've been sent by Princess Iron Fan in the Plantain Cave on Mount
 Turquoise Cloud with an invitation for the Bull Demon King,&#8221; Monkey
 replied.</P>
<P>The moment the woman heard him speak of Princess Iron Fan sending an
 invitation to the Bull Demon King she flared into a rage and went
 crimson from ear to ear.</P>
<P>&#8220;She ought to know better, the low bitch. It's less than two years
 since the Bull Demon King came here, and goodness only knows how much
 jewelry, gold, silver, fine silk and brocade I've given her since then.
 I send her firewood every year and rice every month. She's doing nicely
 thank you. So what's the shameless hussy doing, sending him an
 invitation?&#8221;</P>
<P>When the Great Sage heard this and realized that she was Princess
 Jade he deliberately pulled out his iron cudgel and shouted at her,
 &#8220;You're a damned bitch, using your wealth to buy the Bull Demon King.
 You could only get him to marry you for your money. You ought to be
 thoroughly ashamed of yourself instead of being so insulting.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this all of her souls sent flying, and she fled trembling with
 terror, stumbling and tripping over her shoes, while the Great Sage ran
 after her, shouting and roaring. Once they were out from under the
 shade of the pines they were at the entrance to the Cloud-touching
 Cave. She ran inside and the doors slammed shut behind her. Only then
 did Monkey put his cudgel away and take a good look:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A thick forest,</P>
<P>Sheer precipices,</P>
<P>Luxuriance of creepers,</P>
<P>Fragrance of orchids.</P>
<P>The spring washed over jade and through bamboo;</P>
<P>Grotesque and cunning rocks held precious stones.</P>
<P>The distant peaks were wreathed in mists;</P>
<P>Sun and moon lit up the cloudy crags.</P>
<P>Dragons howled, tigers roared,</P>
<P>Cranes called and warblers sang.</P>
<P>Fresh and lovely was its elegant peace,</P>
<P>And the scenery was radiant with precious flowers.</P>
<P>It was a match for Tiantai's magic caves,</P>
<P>And finer than the Peng and Ying islands in the sea.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We will say nothing of how Brother Monkey admired the view but tell
 how the young woman, dripping with sweat after running and her heart
 beating wildly from terror, went straight to the study where the Bull
 Demon King was quietly perusing a book on cinnabar alchemy. She threw
 herself into his arms feeling thoroughly put out, scratched and tugged
 at his face and ears, and howled aloud.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't upset yourself so, my lovely,&#8221; said the Bull Demon King, all
 smiles. &#8220;What do you want to tell me?&#8221;</P>
<P>She then began to prance and jump about in her fury as she said
 abusively, &#8220;You're killing me, damned monster.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What makes you say that?&#8221; he asked, all smiles.</P>
<P>&#8220;I brought you here to look after me and protect me because I'd lost
 my parents and people who'd been around all said that you were a tough
 guy,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But you're just another henpecked hack.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Bull Demon King took her in his arms and said, &#8220;How've I done you
 wrong, my lovely? Take your time and tell me about it. I'll make it up
 to you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I was taking a stroll among the flowers outside the cave just now
 picking orchids,&#8221; she said, &#8220;When a monk with a face like a thunder god
 rushed up to me and started bowing. I was so scared I couldn't move.
 When I calmed down enough to ask him who he was he said he'd been sent
 by that Princess Iron Fan with an invitation for you. I was so angry I
 had something to say about that, and he started abusing me and chased
 me with his cudgel. He'd have just about killed me with it if I hadn't
 run so fast. So you see, bringing you here was a disaster. It's killing
 me.&#8221; At this the Bull Demon King apologized to her very earnestly. It
 took a long time and many tender attentions from his before she finally
 calmed down.</P>
<P>&#8220;I tell you the truth, my lovely,&#8221; the demon king said forcefully.
 &#8220;The Plantain Cave may be rather out of the way, but it's a place of
 purity and elegance. That wife of mine has had the highest moral
 principles since childhood, and she's also an immortal who has attained
 the Way. She runs her household very strictly. There's not even a page
 there. She couldn't possibly have sent a monk with a face like a
 thunder god. I wonder what evil fiend he is. He must have used her name
 to come and see me. I'm going out to have a look.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid demon king strode out of the study and into the hall to
 put on his armor and take his iron cudgel. &#8220;Who are you, and why are
 you behaving so outrageously?&#8221; he shouted as he went out through the
 doors. Monkey, who was watching from one side, saw that he now looked
 quite different from the way he had five hundred years earlier.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>His wrought iron helmet shone like water or silver;</P>
<P>His golden armor was trimmed with silks and brocades.</P>
<P>The toes of his deerskin boots turned up; their soles were white.</P>
<P>The silken belt at his waist included three lion's tails.</P>
<P>His eyes were as bright as mirrors,</P>
<P>His brows as elegant as red rainbows,</P>
<P>His mouth like a bowl of blood,</P>
<P>His teeth a row of copper plates.</P>
<P>At his resounding roar the mountain gods took fright;</P>
<P>Evil ghosts were overawed by his majestic power.</P>
<P>His fame was known throughout the seas for raising chaos;</P>
<P>He was the Strongarm Demon King here in the West.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Great Sage then tidied his clothes, stepped forward, chanted a
 deep &#8220;re-e-er&#8221; of respect, and asked, &#8220;Can you still recognize me,
 eldest brother?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Are you Sun Wukong, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven?&#8221; the Bull Demon
 King replied, returning his bow.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;It's such a long time since last we met. I
 only got here to see you because I asked a woman some questions just
 now. I must congratulate you on how well everything is growing.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Cut that out,&#8221; the Bull Demon King shouted back. &#8220;I heard about you
 making havoc in Heaven and being crushed under the Five Elements
 Mountain by the Lord Buddha. Then you were released from your heavenly
 punishment to protect the Tang Priest on his way to worship the Buddha
 and fetch the scriptures in the Western Heaven. Why did you have to
 destroy my son, the Sage Boy Bullcalf? I'm very angry with you. Why are
 you here looking for me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please don't misjudge me, brother,&#8221; said the Great Sage with another
 bow. &#8220;Your good son captured my master and was going to eat him. I was
 no match for him. Luckily the Bodhisattva Guanyin rescued my master and
 converted your boy. He's now the page Sudhana. He's even taller than
 you. He lives in a temple of great bliss and enjoys eternal ease.
 There's nothing wrong with any of that, so why be angry with me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Smooth-tongued macaque,&#8221; retorted the Bull Demon King. &#8220;Even if you
 can talk your way out of having ruined my son, what do you mean by
 upsetting my beloved concubine and chasing her up to my doors?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I made a polite inquiry of the lady because I could not find you,&#8221;
 Monkey replied. &#8220;I never realized she was your second wife, so when she
 was rude to me I acted rough. Please forgive me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well then,&#8221; the Bull Demon King said. &#8220;I'll let you off this
 time for the sake of our old friendship.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm very grateful indeed for your immense kindness,&#8221; the Great Sage
 replied. &#8220;But there is one thing I'd like to trouble you with. I hope
 you'll be able to help me out.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You macaque,&#8221; the Bull Demon King shouted at him, &#8220;you think you can
 get away with anything! I spare your life, but instead of making
 yourself scarce you have to keep pestering me. What do you mean by
 helping out?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Let me be honest with you,&#8221; the Great Sage replied. &#8220;I'm stuck at
 the Fiery Mountains on my journey escorting the Tang Priest, and we're
 not getting anywhere. The local people told me that your good lady
 Raksasi has a plantain fan. I tried to borrow it. I went to visit my
 sister-in-law, but she refused to lend it me, which is why I've come to
 see you. I beg you, brother, in the greatness of your heart to come
 with me to sister-in-law's place and borrow the fan for me so that I
 can blow out the fires and get my master across the mountains. Then
 I'll return it right away.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this the Bull Demon King's heart blazed with wrath. &#8220;You told me
 you knew how to behave,&#8221; he said, noisily gnashing his teeth of steel.
 &#8220;I suppose all this was not just to borrow the fan. I'm certain my wife
 has refused to lend it you because you've mistreated her. So that's why
 you came to see me. On top of that you send my beloved concubine
 fleeing in terror. As the saying goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>'Don't push around</P>
<P>Your best friend's wife,</P>
<P>Don't try to destroy</P>
<P>The joy of his life.'</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>You've been pushing my wife around and trying to destroy the
 concubine who's the joy of my life. It's an outrage. Take this!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you want to hit me, brother, I'm not afraid,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;All I
 want is the treasure. I beg you to lend it me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you can last out three rounds with me,&#8221; the Bull Demon King said,
 &#8220;I'll make my wife lend it to you. And if you can't I'll kill you and
 have my revenge.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Good idea, brother,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;I've been so lazy. I haven't
 been to see you for ages, and I don't know how your fighting powers now
 compare with the old days. Let's have a match with our cudgels.&#8221; The
 Bull Demon King was in no mood for further argument, and he hit at
 Monkey's head with his mace. Monkey hit back with his gold-banded
 cudgel. It was a splendid fight:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The gold-banded cudgel,</P>
<P>The rough iron mace,</P>
<P>Are no longer friends.</P>
<P>One said, &#8220;You destroyed my son, you macaque.&#8221;</P>
<P>The other, &#8220;Don't be angry: he has found the Way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How could you be so stupid as to come to my door?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am here to visit you with a special purpose.&#8221;</P>
<P>One wanted the fan to protect the Tang Priest;</P>
<P>The other was too mean to lend the plantain leaf.</P>
<P>Friendship was lost in the exchange of words;</P>
<P>In anger neither had any sense of brotherhood.</P>
<P>The Bull Demon King's mace moved like a dragon;</P>
<P>The Great Sage's cudgel sent gods and demons fleeing.</P>
<P>First they fought in front of the mountain,</P>
<P>Then they both rose on auspicious clouds.</P>
<P>They showed their great powers up in mid-air,</P>
<P>Doing wonderful movements in multi-coloured light.</P>
<P>The clash of their cudgels rocked the gates of Heaven;</P>
<P>They were too evenly matched for either to win.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Great Sage and the Bull Demon King fought over a hundred rounds
 without either emerging as the victor. Just as they were becoming
 locked in their struggle a voice called from the peak, &#8220;King Bull, my
 king sends his respects and invites you to honour him with your
 presence at a banquet.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this the Bull Demon King blocked the gold-banded cudgel with his
 iron mace and called out, &#8220;You stay here, macaque. I'm going to a
 friend's house for a meal. I'll be back.&#8221; With that he landed his cloud
 and went straight back into the cave.</P>
<P>&#8220;My lovely,&#8221; he said to Princess Jade, &#8220;the man you saw with a face
 like a thunder god is the macaque Sun Wukong. A bout with my mace has
 sent him packing: he won't be back. Stop worrying and enjoy yourself.
 I'm going to a Mend's place for some drinks.&#8221; He then took off his
 helmet and armor, donned a duck-green jacket of cut velvet, went
 outside and mounted his water-averting golden-eyed beast. Telling his
 underlings to look after the palace he headed Northwest in clouds and
 mist.</P>
<P>While the Great Sage watched all this from the peak he thought, &#8220;I
 wonder who the friend is and where he's gone for his banquet. I'll
 follow him.&#8221; Splendid Monkey then shook himself and turned into a clear
 breeze to follow him. He soon reached a mountain, but the Bull Demon
 King was nowhere to be seen. The Great Sage turned back into himself
 and started to search the mountain. He found a deep pool of pure water
 beside which was inscribed in large letters on a tablet of stone</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>RAGGED ROCK MOUNTAIN</P>
<P>GREEN WAVE POOL</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Old Bull must have gone into the water,&#8221; Monkey thought, &#8220;and
 underwater spirits are lesser dragons, dragon or fish spirits, or else
 turtle, tortoise or terrapin spirits. I'd better go down and have a
 look.&#8221;</P>
<P>Making a hand-spell and saying the magic words the splendid Great
 Sage shook himself, turned into a medium-sized crab weighing thirty-six
 pounds, jumped into the water with a splash, and went straight down to
 the bottom of the pool. He saw an ornamental arch of delicate tracery
 to which was tethered a water-averting golden-eyed beast. On the other
 side of the arch there was no more water. Monkey crawled through and
 took a careful look. From one side he heard music, and this is what he
 saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Cowry gateways to a palace red,</P>
<P>Like nothing else in the world.</P>
<P>The roof tiles were of yellow gold,</P>
<P>The door pivots of whitest jade.</P>
<P>The screens were of tortoise-shell,</P>
<P>The balustrades of coral and of pearl.</P>
<P>Auspicious clouds glowed all around the throne,</P>
<P>From the sky above right down to the ground.</P>
<P>This was not the palace of Heaven or the sea,</P>
<P>Although it more than rivaled an island paradise.</P>
<P>A banquet for host and guests was set in the lofty hall,</P>
<P>Where all the official wore their hats with pearls.</P>
<P>Jade girls were told to bring ivory bowls,</P>
<P>Exquisite beauties to play fine music.</P>
<P>The great whale sang,</P>
<P>Giant crabs danced,</P>
<P>Turtles played pipes and drums,</P>
<P>While pearls shone over the goblets and boaras.</P>
<P>Birdlike script adorned the turquoise screens,</P>
<P>While shrimp-whisker curtains hung along the corridors.</P>
<P>From the eight notes mingled came wonderful music</P>
<P>Whose tones rose up to the clouds above.</P>
<P>Green-headed singsong girls stroked zithers of jasper</P>
<P>While red-eyed dragonflies played jade flutes.</P>
<P>Mandarin fish carried dried venison in on their heads,</P>
<P>While dragon girls had the wings of golden pheasants in their hair.</P>
<P>What they ate were</P>
<P>The rarest delicacies of the heavenly kitchen;</P>
<P>What they drank were</P>
<P>The finest vintages of the purple palace.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Bull Demon King was sitting in the seat of honour with three or
 four lesser dragon spirits on either side. Facing him was an ancient
 dragon, surrounded by dragon sons, dragon grandsons, dragon wives and
 dragon daughters. Just as they were feasting and drinking the Great
 Sage Sun marched straight in, to be spotted by the ancient dragon, who
 ordered, &#8220;Arrest that vagrant crab.&#8221; The dragon sons and grandsons fell
 upon him and seized him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Spare me, spare me,&#8221; said Monkey, suddenly reverting to human
 speech.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you from, crab vagrant?&#8221; the ancient dragon asked. &#8220;How
 dare you come into my hall and behave in this disgraceful way in front
 of my distinguished guests? Tell me this moment if you want to be
 spared the death penalty.&#8221; The splendid Great Sage then made up a pack
 of lies to tell him:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Ever since coming to live in the lake</P>
<P>I've had to make my home in cliffs and caves.</P>
<P>Over the years I've learned to stretch myself out</P>
<P>So now I am known as the Sideways Man-at-arms.</P>
<P>Dragging my way through weeds and through mud,</P>
<P>I have never been taught correct social behavior.</P>
<P>If in my ignorance I have caused offence I beg</P>
<P>Your Majesty to show me mercy.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the spirits at the banquet heard this they all bowed to the
 ancient dragon and said, &#8220;This is the first time that the Sideways
 Man-at-arms has come to your palace of jasper, and he does not
 understand royal etiquette. We beg Your Excellency to spare him.&#8221;</P>
<P>The ancient dragon thanked the spirits and ordered, &#8220;Release the
 wretch. Put a beating on record against his name, and have him wait
 outside.&#8221; The Great Sage acknowledged his kindness then fled for his
 life till he reached the archway outside.</P>
<P>&#8220;That Bull Demon King is drinking for all he's worth in there,&#8221; he
 thought. &#8220;I'm not going to wait till the feast breaks up. And even if I
 did he still wouldn't lend me the fan. I'd do better to steal his
 golden-eyed beast and turn myself into a Bull Demon King. Then I can
 trick Raksasi into lending me the fan and I'll be able to escort my
 master across the mountains. That'll be best.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage then reverted to his original form, untied
 the golden-eyed beast, leapt into the carved saddle, and rode straight
 up from the bottom of the water. Once out of the pool he made himself
 look like the Bull Demon King. Whipping on the beast he set his cloud
 moving and was soon at the mouth of the Plantain Cave in Mount
 Turquoise Cloud.</P>
<P>&#8220;Open up!&#8221; he shouted, and at the sound of his voice the two servant
 girls inside the gates opened them for him.</P>
<P>Taking him for the Bull Demon King they went in to report, &#8220;Madam,
 His Majesty's come home.&#8221; At the news Raksasi quickly neatened her hair
 and hurried out on her little lotus feet to meet him. Climbing out of
 the saddle the Great Sage led the golden-eyed beast inside. He was bold
 enough to try to deceive the beauty, whose mortal eyes failed to see
 who he really was as she led him inside, hand in hand. The maids were
 told to prepare places and bring tea, and as the master was back the
 whole household tried its hardest.</P>
<P>The Great Sage and Raksasi were soon talking. &#8220;My good lady,&#8221; said
 the false Bull Demon King, &#8220;it's been a long time.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I hope that everything has gone well for Your Majesty,&#8221; Raksasi
 replied, going on to ask, &#8220;What wind brings you back to your abandoned
 wife now that you have married your new darling?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no question of having abandoned you,&#8221; the Great Sage replied
 with a smile. &#8220;It's just that I've been away a long time since Princess
 Jade invited me to her place. I'm kept very busy with domestic matters
 to deal with and friends to attend to. I hear that so-and-so Sun Wukong
 is very near the Fiery Mountains with the Tang Priest, and I'm worried
 that he might come and ask you to lend him the fan. I can't forgive him
 for destroying our son, I want my revenge. If he turns up, just send
 someone to tell me. When I get him we can cut his body up into ten
 thousand pieces as revenge for what we have suffered.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You Majesty,&#8221; replied Raksasi, in tears at what he had just said,
 &#8220;as the saying goes, 'A man with no woman is risking his wealth; a
 woman with no husband is risking her health.' That macaque practically
 killed me.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this the Great Sage pretended to fly into a terrible rage. &#8220;When
 did that bloody monkey go?&#8221; he swore.</P>
<P>&#8220;He hasn't gone yet,&#8221; Raksasi replied. &#8220;He was here yesterday to
 borrow the fan, and as he'd destroyed our boy I put my armor on and
 went out to cut him to bits with my swords. But he endured the pain,
 called me his sister-in-law, and said that you and he were once sworn
 brothers.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He was my seventh sworn brother five hundred years ago,&#8221; the Great
 Sage replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;He said not a word when I swore at him,&#8221; Raksasi continued, &#8220;and
 didn't strike back when I cut him. Finally I blew him away with the
 fan. Goodness only knows where he got some wind-fixing magic from, but
 this morning he was back shouting outside the door again, and the fan
 wouldn't move him no matter how hard I waved it. When I swung my swords
 around and went for him with them he wasn't being polite any more. I
 was so scared of the force of his cudgel I came back in here and had
 the doors tightly shut. Somehow or other he managed to get right into
 my belly and it practically killed me. I had to call him brother-in-law
 and lend him the fan before he'd go.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Great Sage put on a great show of beating his chest and saying,
 &#8220;How terrible, how terrible. You did wrong, wife. You should never have
 given that treasure to the macaque.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be angry, Your Majesty,&#8221; Raksasi replied. &#8220;I lent him a false
 fan and tricked him into going away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where's the real one?&#8221; the Great Sage asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;don't worry. It's safely put away.&#8221; She
 then told the serving girls to lay on wine and a feast to welcome him
 back. &#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; she then said, offering him a goblet of wine,
 &#8220;please don't forget the wife of your youth in the joy of your new
 marriage. Won't you drink this cup of wine from home?&#8221; The Great Sage
 had no choice but to accept the goblet and smile as he raised it.</P>
<P>&#8220;You drink first, wife,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I've left you looking after the
 home by yourself, good lady, for too long, while I've been busy with my
 other property. Let this be a gesture of my gratitude.&#8221;</P>
<P>Raksasi took the goblet back, lifted it again, and handed it to the
 king with the words, &#8220;As the old saying goes: The wife is the equal,
 but the husband is the father who supports her. You don't need to thank
 me.&#8221; It was only after more such politeness that the two of them sat
 down and began drinking. Not wanting to break his vow to avoid meat,
 the Great Sage only ate some fruit while he talked to her.</P>
<P>After they had each had several cups Raksasi was feeling a little
 drunk and rather sexy. She started to press herself against the Great
 Sage, stroking and pinching him. Taking him by the hand, she whispered
 tender words to him; leaning her shoulder against him, she spoke
 quietly and submissively. They shared the same cup of wine, drinking a
 mouthful each at a time, and she fed him fruit. The Great Sage
 pretended to go along with this and smile. He had no choice but to lean
 against her. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The hook to catch poetry,</P>
<P>The broom to sweep away sorrow,</P>
<P>The remover of all difficulties is wine.</P>
<P>The man, though virtuous, unbuttoned his lapel;</P>
<P>The woman forgot herself and began to laugh.</P>
<P>Her face had the complexion of a peach,</P>
<P>Her body swayed like a willow sapling.</P>
<P>Many a word came babbling from her mouth</P>
<P>As she pinched and nipped in her desire.</P>
<P>Sometimes she tugged at her hair,</P>
<P>Or waved her delicate fingers.</P>
<P>She often raised a foot</P>
<P>And twitched the sleeves of her clothes.</P>
<P>Her powdered neck sunk lower</P>
<P>And her fine waist started to wiggle.</P>
<P>She never stopped talking for a moment</P>
<P>As she opened gold buttons to half show her breasts.</P>
<P>In her cups she was like a landslide of jade,</P>
<P>And as she rubbed her bleary eyes she did not look at her best.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Watching her get drunk the Great Sage had kept his wits about him,
 and he tried to lead her on by saying, &#8220;Where have you put the real
 fan, wife? You must watch it very carefully all the time. I'm worried
 that Sun the Novice will trick it out of you with some of his many
 transformations.&#8221; At this Raksasi tittered, spat it out of her mouth,
 and handed it to the Great Sage. It was only the size of an apricot
 leaf.</P>
<P>&#8220;Here's the treasure,&#8221; she said.</P>
<P>The Great Sage took it but could not believe that it really was. &#8220;How
 could a tiny little thing like this blow a fire out?&#8221; he wondered. &#8220;It
 must be another fake.&#8221;</P>
<P>Seeing him looking at the treasure so deep in thought, Raksasi could
 not restrain herself from rubbing her powdered face against Monkey's
 and saying, &#8220;Put the treasure away and have another drink, darling.
 What are you looking so worried about?&#8221;</P>
<P>The Great Sage took the chance to slip in the question, &#8220;How could a
 little thing like this blow out 250 miles of fire?&#8221; She was now drunk
 enough to have no inhibitions about speaking the truth, so she told him
 how it was done: &#8220;Your Majesty, I expect you've been overdoing your
 pleasures day and night these last two years since you left me. That
 Princess Jade must have addled your brains if you can't even remember
 about your own treasure. You just have to pinch the seventh red silk
 thread with the thumb of your left hand and say,<I>
 'Huixuhexixichuihu.'</I> Then it'll grow twelve feet long. It can do as
 many changes as you like. It could blow 250,000 miles of flame out with
 a single wave.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Great Sage committed all this very carefully to memory, put the
 fan in his mouth, rubbed his face and turned back into himself.
 &#8220;Raksasi!&#8221; he yelled at the top of his voice. &#8220;Have a careful look: I'm
 your brother-in-law. What a disgusting way you've been carrying on in
 with me, and for what a long time too. You're shameless, quite
 shameless.&#8221;</P>
<P>In her horror at realizing it was Sun Wukong she pushed the dining
 table over and fell into the dust, overcome with shame and screaming.
 &#8220;I'm so upset I could die, I could die.&#8221;</P>
<P>Not caring whether she was dead or alive, the Great Sage broke free
 and rushed straight out of the Plantain Cave. He was indeed not lusting
 after that female beauty, and glad to turn away with a smiling face. He
 sprang on his auspicious cloud that took him up to the top of the
 mountain, spat the fan out of his mouth, and tried the magic out.
 Pinching the seventh red tassel with the thumb of his left hand, he
 said<I> &#8220;Huixuhexixichuihu,&#8221;</I> and indeed it grew to be twelve feet
 long. On close examination he found it quite different from the false
 one he had borrowed before. It glittered with auspicious light and was
 surrounded by lucky vapors. Thirty-six threads of red silk formed a
 trellis pattern inside and out. But Brother Monkey had only asked how
 to make it grow and had not found out the spell for shrinking it. So he
 had to shoulder it as he went back by the way he had come.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the Bull Demon King's feast with all the spirits at the bottom
 of the Green Wave Pool ended he went outside to find that the
 water-averting golden-eyed beast was missing. The ancient dragon king
 called the spirits together to ask them, &#8220;Which of you untied and stole
 the Bull Demon King's golden-eyed beast?&#8221; The spirits all knelt down
 and replied, &#8220;We wouldn't dare steal it. We were all waiting, singing
 or playing at the banquet. None of us was out here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am sure that none of you palace musicians would have dared to take
 it,&#8221; the ancient dragon said. &#8220;Have any strangers been here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;A crab spirit was here not long ago during the banquet, and he was a
 stranger.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this the Bull King suddenly realized what had happened. &#8220;Say no
 more,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;When you sent your messenger with the invitation
 this morning there was a Sun Wukong there who'd come to ask to borrow
 my plantain fan as he couldn't get the Tang Priest he's escorting to
 fetch the scriptures across the Fiery Mountains. I refused. I was in
 the middle of a fight with him that neither of us was winning when I
 shook him off and came straight here to the banquet. That monkey's
 extremely quick and adaptable. I'm sure that the crab spirit was him
 here in disguise to do a bit of spying. He's stolen my beast to go and
 trick the plantain fan out of my wife.&#8221; This news made all the spirits
 shake with fright.</P>
<P>&#8220;Do you mean the Sun Wukong who made havoc in Heaven?&#8221; they asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the Bull Demon King replied. &#8220;If any of you gentlemen have any
 trouble on the road West keep your distance from him whatever you do.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But if all that's true, what about Your Majesty's steed?&#8221; the
 ancient dragon asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;No problem,&#8221; the Bull Demon King replied with a smile. &#8220;You
 gentlemen may all go home now while I go after him.&#8221;</P>
<P>With that he parted his way through the waters, sprang up from the
 bottom of the pool and rode a yellow cloud straight to the Plantain
 Cave on Mount Turquoise Cloud, where he heard Raksasi stamping her
 feet, beating her breast, howling and moaning. He pushed the doors open
 to see the water-averting golden-eyed beast tethered by them.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where did Sun Wukong go, wife?&#8221; the Bull Demon King said.</P>
<P>Seeing that the Bull Demon King was back, the serving girls all knelt
 down and said, &#8220;Are you home, Your Majesty?&#8221;</P>
<P>Raksasi grabbed hold of him, banged her head against his, and said
 abusively, &#8220;Damn and blast you, you careless fool. Why ever did you let
 that macaque steal the golden-eyed beast and turn himself into your
 double to come here and trick me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Which way did the macaque go?&#8221; the Bull Demon King asked, grinding
 his teeth in fury. Beating her breast Raksasi continued to pour out
 abuse: &#8220;The damn monkey tricked me out of my treasure, turned back into
 himself, and went. I'm so angry I could die.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do look after yourself, wife,&#8221; the Bull Demon King said, &#8220;and don't
 be so upset. When I've caught the macaque and taken the treasure off
 him I'll skin him, grind his bones to powder, and bring you his heart
 and liver. That'll make you feel better.&#8221; He then called for weapons.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty's weapons aren't here,&#8221; the serving girls replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Then bring your mistress' weapons,&#8221; the Bull Demon King replied. The
 servants brought her pair of blue-tipped swords, and the Bull Demon
 King took off the duck-green velvet jacket he had worn to the banquet
 and tied the little waistcoat he wore next to his skin more tightly. He
 then strode out of the Plantain Cave, a sword in each hand, and headed
 straight for the Fiery Mountains in pursuit of Monkey. It was a case of</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The man who forgot a kindness</P>
<P>Tricking a doting wife;</P>
<P>The fiery-tempered old demon</P>
<P>Meeting a mendicant monk.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

</I>
<P>Zhu Bajie Helps to Defeat a Demon King</P>
<P>Monkey's Third Attempt to Borrow the Fan</P>
</B>
<P>The story tells how the Bull Demon King caught up with the Great Sage
 Sun and saw him looking very cheerful as he went along with the
 plantain fan over his shoulder. &#8220;So the macaque has also tricked the
 art of using the fan out of her,&#8221; the demon king thought. &#8220;If I ask him
 for it back to his face he's bound to refuse, and if he fans me with it
 and sends me sixty thousand miles away that would be just what he
 wants. Now I know that the Tang Priest is sitting waiting by the main
 road. When I was an evil spirit in the old days I used to know his
 second disciple the Pig Spirit. I think I'll turn myself into a double
 of the Pig Spirit and play a trick back on him. That macaque will no
 doubt be so pleased with himself that he won't really be on his guard.&#8221;
 The splendid demon king could also do seventy-two transformations and
 his martial skills were on a par with those of the Great Sage: it was
 just that he was rather more clumsily built, was less quick and
 penetrating, and not so adaptable.</P>
<P>First he hid the swords then he said the words of the spell, turned
 himself into the exact likeness of Pig, went down, and met Monkey face
 to face. &#8220;I'm here, brother,&#8221; he called.</P>
<P>The Great Sage was indeed delighted. As the ancient saying goes, a
 cat that's won a fight is more pleased with himself than a tiger.
 Monkey was so confident of his powers that he did not bother to
 investigate why the new arrival was here, but seeing that he looked
 like Pig, called out, &#8220;Where are you going brother?&#8221;</P>
<P>The Bull Demon King made up an answer on the spot: &#8220;You'd been away
 for so long that the master wondered if the Bull Demon King's magic
 powers were too much for you and you couldn't get the treasure. So he
 sent me to meet you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There was no need to worry,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I've already got it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How did you manage that?&#8221; the Bull Demon King asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Old Bull and I fought over a hundred rounds without either of us
 getting the upper hand till he broke off the fight and went to the
 bottom of the Green Wave Pool in Ragged Rock Mountain for a banquet
 with a whole lot of lesser dragons and dragons. I tailed-him there,
 turned into a crab, stole the water-averting golden-eyed beast, made
 myself look like him, and went to the Plantain Cave to trick Raksasi,
 She as good as married me on the spot and I conned it out of her.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You had to go to a lot of trouble, brother,&#8221; the Bull Demon King
 replied. &#8220;Can I hold the fan?&#8221; Not realizing that this Pig was an
 impostor, or even considering the possibility, the Great Sage Sun
 handed him the fan.</P>
<P>Now the Bull Demon King knew the secret of making the fan shrink or
 grow, and as soon as he had the fan in his hands he made a spell with
 them that nobody could see, shrunk it back to the size of an apricot
 leaf, and reverted to his true form. &#8220;Bloody macaque,&#8221; he swore, &#8220;do
 you know who I am now?&#8221; As soon as he saw this Monkey regretted making
 so terrible a mistake.</P>
<P>With a cry of anguish he stamped his feet and yelled, &#8220;Aagh! After
 all these years I've been hunting wild geese a gosling has pecked out
 my eye!&#8221; He was now leaping around in a thunderous fury, and he took a
 crack at the Bull Demon King's head with his iron cudgel. The demon
 king then fanned him with the fan, not realizing that the Great Sage
 had inadvertently swallowed the wind-fixing pill he had in his mouth
 when he turned himself into a tiny insect to go into Raksasi's stomach.
 This had made all his entrails, his skin and his bones so solid and
 firm that no matter how hard the Bull Demon King fanned he could not
 move him. This alarmed the Bull Demon King, who put the treasure in his
 mouth and fought back, swinging a sword in each hand. The two of them
 fought a splendid battle up in mid-air:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Great Sage Equaling Heaven,</P>
<P>The Bull Demon King of evil,</P>
<P>All for the sake of a plantain-leaf fan.</P>
<P>When they met each showed his powers;</P>
<P>The careless Great Sage got the fan by a trick,</P>
<P>But allowed the Bull King to take it back.</P>
<P>One mercilessly raised the golden cudgel,</P>
<P>The other wielded with skill his blue-tipped swords.</P>
<P>The mighty Great Sage belched out coloured mists</P>
<P>While the evil Bull King breathed brilliant lights.</P>
<P>Well matched in courage,</P>
<P>Both of them wicked,</P>
<P>They gnashed and ground their teeth in terrible wrath.</P>
<P>Heaven and earth were darkened by the dust they kicked up;</P>
<P>Gods and ghosts alike hid from the flying stones.</P>
<P>&#8220;How dare you try to turn a trick against me!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll get you for what my wife promised you!&#8221;</P>
<P>Coarse was their language and fierce were their tempers.</P>
<P>&#8220;For tricking my wife you deserve to die.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When I sue you the sentence will surely be death.&#8221;</P>
<P>The cunning Great Sage Equaling Heaven,</P>
<P>The murderous Strongarm Demon King:</P>
<P>Both of them only wanting to fight,</P>
<P>Neither of them willing to pause and discuss.</P>
<P>Equal the effort of swords and of cudgel;</P>
<P>Had either relaxed he'd have gone straight to Hell.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story now tells not of those two locked in their struggle but of
 the Tang Priest sitting by the road and finding the heat unbearable. He
 was also very anxious and thirsty.</P>
<P>&#8220;May I ask you,&#8221; he said to the local deity, &#8220;what that Bull Demon
 King's powers are like?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He has very great magic,&#8221; the local god replied, &#8220;and his dharma
 powers are unlimited. He and the Great Sage Sun are well matched.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong is a very good traveler,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;He can normally
 go six or seven hundred miles and back in an instant. Why has he been
 away all day? I'm sure he must be fighting the Bull Demon King.&#8221; With
 that he called for Pig and Friar Sand and asked, &#8220;Which of you will go
 to meet your elder brother? If he is up against an enemy you will have
 to help him in the fight, get the fan, and come back. I am very
 impatient to cross these mountains and continue along our way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's getting late,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;and I'd like to go to meet him.
 The only thing is that I don't know the way to Mount Thunder Piled.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But I do,&#8221; the local god said. &#8220;Tell the Curtain-lifting General to
 keep your master company while you and I go there.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang was delighted. &#8220;I am most grateful to you for going to such
 trouble,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I shall thank you again when you have
 succeeded.&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig then summoned up his spirits, tightened the belt round his black
 brocade tunic, and took his rake in his hands as he rose up on his
 cloud with the local god and headed due East. As they were going along
 they heard great shouts and were buffeted by strong winds. Stopping his
 cloud for a good look he saw that it was all caused by Monkey and the
 Bull Demon King fighting.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why don't you join in, Marshal Tian Peng?&#8221; the local deity asked.
 &#8220;What are you waiting for?&#8221;</P>
<P>At that the idiot brandished his rake and said with a great shout,
 &#8220;Brother, I'm coming.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Idiot,&#8221; said Monkey bitterly, &#8220;you've ruined things for me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But the master told me to come to meet you,&#8221; Pig protested. &#8220;He
 asked the local god to guide me as I don't know the way. That's why I'm
 a bit late. How can you say I've ruined things for you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm not angry with you for being late,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;It's this
 damned bull who's a thorough disgrace. I'd got the fan off Raksasi, but
 he turned himself into your double and came to meet me. I was so
 pleased to see you that I passed him the fan. He turned back into
 himself and we've been fighting it out ever since. That's why I said
 you'd ruined things for me.&#8221;</P>
<P>This news put Pig into a flaming temper. Raising his rake he shouted
 abuse to the Bull Demon King's face: &#8220;I'll get you, you pox-ridden bag
 of blood! I'll get you for pretending to be me, your own ancestor, to
 trick my brother and stir up trouble between us.&#8221;</P>
<P>Watch as he starts lashing out wildly with the rake. The Bull Demon
 King, who had been fighting Monkey all day, was tiring, and he also
 realized that he would never be able to withstand the onslaught of
 Pig's rake, so he fled in defeat. But his way was blocked by a force of
 spirit soldiers led by the local god of the Fiery Mountains.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wait, Strongarm King,&#8221; the local deity said. &#8220;All the gods and
 heavens are protecting Tang Sanzang on his journey West to fetch the
 scriptures. The Three Worlds all know about him, and the Ten Directions
 are supporting him. Please lend him your plantain fan to blow out the
 flames so that he can cross the mountains without danger or disaster.
 Otherwise Heaven will hold you criminally responsible and you're bound
 to be executed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You haven't looked into the rights and wrongs of this at all,&#8221; King
 Demon Bull replied. &#8220;That damned ape has done one evil thing after
 another: he's stolen my son, bullied my concubine, and defrauded my
 wife. I wish I could swallow him whole and turn him into shit to feed
 to the dogs. I'll never lend him my treasure.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before the words were all out of his mouth Pig had caught up with him
 and was saying abusively, &#8220;I'll get you, you poxy bull. The fan or your
 life!&#8221; The Bull Demon King had to turn round to fight Pig off with his
 swords while the Great Sage Monkey wielded his cudgel to help him. It
 was a fine fight they had there:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A boar turned spirit,</P>
<P>A bull become monster.</P>
<P>A monkey who had robbed Heaven and found the Way.</P>
<P>Dharma-nature can always overcome what has been created;</P>
<P>Earth must be used to combine with the prime cause.</P>
<I>
<P>Pointed and sharp were the nine teeth of the rake;
</I>
<P>Flexible and keen were the two sword blades.</P>
<P>The movements of the iron cudgel dominated the fray;</P>
<P>The local god formed the cinnabar head.</P>
<P>The three of them struggled to overcome,</P>
<P>Each of them scheming to give play to his powers.</P>
<P>Metal money is best at making the bull draw the plough;</P>
<P>If the boar goes in the oven, wood is finished.</P>
<P>Unless the heart is in it the Way cannot be completed;</P>
<P>To keep the spirit controlled the monkey must be tied up.</P>
<P>Amid wild shouts and desperate pleas</P>
<P>The three types of weapon whistled through the air.</P>
<P>There was no kindness in the blows of rake and sword;</P>
<P>The gold-banded cudgel rose for good reason.</P>
<P>Their fight put out the stars and dimmed the moon;</P>
<P>The sky was filled with a cold, dark dreary fog.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The demon king fought hard and courageously for mastery, falling back
 all the while. When the dawn came after a whole night of battle there
 was still no victor, and in front of them now was the entrance to the
 Cloud-touching Cave on Mount Thunder Piled. The ear-splitting noise
 that the three of them, the local god and the spirit soldiers were
 making alarmed Princess Jade, who sent her serving girls to see who was
 causing the din.</P>
<P>The little demons on the doors came in to report, &#8220;It's our master.
 He's fighting the man with a face like a thunder god, another monk with
 a long snout and big ears, and the local god of the Fiery Mountains and
 his men.&#8221; The moment Princess Jade heard this she ordered the senior
 and junior officers of the guard to take their swords and spears and
 help their lord.</P>
<P>&#8220;Good to see you,&#8221; said the Bull Demon King with delight, &#8220;good to
 see you.&#8221; All the demons rushed wildly into the attack. It was more
 than Pig could cope with and he fled in defeat, trailing his rake
 behind him. The Great Sage sprang aloft out of the multiple
 encirclement on a somersault cloud; the spirit soldiers broke and ran.
 Old Bull led his host of demons back to the cave in victory and the
 doors were shut tightly behind them.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;He's tough, damn him,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;He started fighting me at about
 four yesterday afternoon and we were nowhere near a result when you two
 came along to help last night. He fought for half a day and a whole
 night without showing any sign of tiring. And that bunch of little
 devils who came out just now were a rough lot too. Now he's shut the
 doors of his cave and won't come out. What are we to do?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It was about ten yesterday morning when you left the master,
 brother,&#8221; Pig said, &#8220;so why was it four in the afternoon when you
 started fighting him? What were you doing for the six hours in
 between?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I reached this mountain soon after I left you,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and
 saw a woman. When I questioned her she turned out to be his favorite
 concubine Princess Jade. I gave her a bit of a fright with my cudgel,
 so she fled into the cave and sent her Bull Demon King out. He and I
 swapped a few insults then started fighting. We'd been at it for a
 couple of hours when someone came to invite him to a banquet. I tailed
 him to the bottom of the Green Wave Pool on Ragged Rock Mountain and
 turned into a crab to do a little spying. Then I stole his
 water-averting golden-eyed beast and changed myself into the Bull Demon
 King's double to go back to the Plantain Cave on Mount Turquoise Cloud,
 where I conned Raksasi into giving me the fan. I went outside to try
 the magic spell out on the fan and made it grow, but I didn't know how
 to make it shrink again. As I was walking along with it on my shoulder
 he turned himself into your spitting image and tricked it back off me
 again. That's how I wasted six hours.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As the saying goes,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;it's just like a boatful of
 beancurd sinking: it came out of the wet and it disappeared into the
 wet. Easy come, easy go, But how are we going to take our master across
 the mountains if we're having so hard a time getting the fan? We'll
 just have to go back and make a bloody detour.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't get impatient, Great Sage,&#8221; the local god said, &#8220;and don't try
 to be lazy, Marshal Tian Peng. If you make a detour that will mean
 leaving the straight and narrow: you'll never cultivate your conduct
 that way. As the old saying goes, 'In walking never take a short cut.'
 You mustn't talk about detours. Your master is waiting by the main
 road, desperate for your success.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said Monkey, his resolve stiffened, &#8220;don't talk nonsense,
 idiot. The local deity is right. As for that Bull Demon King, we'll
 have to&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Straggle for mastery,</P>
<P>Use our powers,</P>
<P>Until we can make the whole earth change.</P>
<P>Since coming to the West he has never met a rival:</P>
<P>The Bull King was originally the mind-ape transformed.</P>
<P>Only today do the sources flow:</P>
<P>We must hold out till we borrow the fan.</P>
<P>Put out the flames in the cool of the dawn,</P>
<P>Smash through obstinate emptiness to visit the Buddha.</P>
<P>When all is fulfilled we will rise to heavenly bliss,</P>
<P>And all go to the assembly under the Dragon-flower Tree.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>These words braced Pig's spirits too, and eagerly he said,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes, yes!</P>
<P>Go, go, go!</P>
<P>Never mind what the Bull King's powers are,</P>
<P>Wood grows in the nor'nor'west and is matched with a pig;</P>
<P>The bull-calf will be led back to the earth.</P>
<P>Metal was born in West sou'west and was an ape,</P>
<P>Without any conflict or conquest and full of peace.</P>
<P>We must use the plantain leaf as if it were water</P>
<P>To put out the flames and bring harmony.</P>
<P>Hard work by night and day with never a rest</P>
<P>Will lead us to success and the Ullambana feast.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The two of them led the local deity and his spirit soldiers forward,
 then battered the doors of the Cloud-touching Cave to pieces with the
 rake and the cudgel. This so terrified the guard commanders that they
 rushed inside to report, &#8220;Your Majesty, Sun Wukong's brought his troops
 here and has smashed down our front doors.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Bull Demon King was just then telling Princess Jade what had
 happened and feeling thoroughly fed up with Monkey. The news of the
 front doors being smashed made him beside himself with fury, so he put
 his armor on immediately and went outside with his iron mace in his
 hands shouting abusively, &#8220;Damned macaque! You must think you're a very
 big shot indeed, coming here to play the hooligan and smash down my
 front door.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Old skinflint,&#8221; retorted Pig, going forward, &#8220;who do you think you
 are, trying to put other people in their place? Don't move! Take this!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Idiot!&#8221; the Bull Demon King replied. &#8220;Chaff-guzzler! You're not
 worth bothering with. Tell that monkey to come here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't know what's good for you, cud-chewer,&#8221; called Monkey.
 &#8220;Yesterday you were still my sworn brother, but today we're enemies.
 Watch this carefully!&#8221; The Bull Demon King met their onslaught with
 spirit, and the ensuing fight was even finer than the one before. The
 three heroes were locked in a melee. What a battle!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Rake and iron cudgel showing their might,</P>
<P>Leading the spirit soldiers to attack the ancient beast.</P>
<P>The beast displayed his terrible strength when fighting alone,</P>
<P>Reviving his powers that rivaled those of Heaven.</P>
<P>The rake hit hard,</P>
<P>The mace struck,</P>
<P>The iron cudgel showed its heroic powers.</P>
<P>The three weapons rang against each other,</P>
<P>Blocking and parrying, never giving way.</P>
<P>One said he was the champion,</P>
<P>Another claimed, &#8220;I am the best.&#8221;</P>
<P>The earth soldiers who were watching could hardly tell them apart.</P>
<P>As wood and earth were locked in combat.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why won't you lend us the plantain fan?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You had the effrontery to mistreat my wife,</P>
<P>To ruin my son and terrify my concubine.</P>
<P>I haven't punished you for all of that yet,</P>
<P>And now you harass us and beat down my doors.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Be on your guard against the As-You-Will cudgel:</P>
<P>A touch of it will tear your skin open.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Mind you avoid the teeth of my rake:</P>
<P>One blow, and nine wounds all gush blood.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Bull Monster fearlessly gave play to his might,</P>
<P>Wielding his mace with skill and with cunning.</P>
<P>Their movements turned the rain clouds upside-down,</P>
<P>As each of them snorted out his mists and winds.</P>
<P>This was indeed a battle to the death,</P>
<P>As they fought it out together with hatred in their hearts.</P>
<P>Taking new stances,</P>
<P>Offering openings high and low,</P>
<P>They attacked and they parried with never a mistake.</P>
<P>The two brother disciples were united in their efforts;</P>
<P>The solitary mace showed its might alone.</P>
<P>They battled from dawn till eight in the morning</P>
<P>Till the Bull Demon had to abandon the fight.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>With death in their hearts and no thought of survival the three of
 them fought another hundred or so rounds till Pig took advantage of
 Monkey's miraculous powers to put all his brute strength into a rain of
 blows from his rake that were more than the Bull Demon King could
 withstand. He turned and fled defeated back to his cave, only to find
 the entrance blocked by the local god and his spirit troops.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where do you think you're going, Strongarm King?&#8221; the local god
 shouted. &#8220;We're here.&#8221; As he could not get into his cave the Bull Demon
 King fled, only to be pursued by Pig and Monkey. In his panic the Bull
 Demon King tore off his helmet and armor, threw away his mace, shook
 himself, turned into a swan and flew away. Monkey looked around and
 said with a grin, &#8220;Pig, Old Bull's gone.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot had not the faintest idea of what had happened and neither
 had the local god as they looked all around and aimlessly searched
 Mount Thunder Piled. &#8220;Isn't that him flying up there?&#8221; said Monkey,
 pointing.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's a swan,&#8221; Pig replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;it's what Old Bull turned himself into.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So what are we going to do about it?&#8221; the local god asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;You two charge in there, wipe all the demons out without quarter and
 tear down his den,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;That will cut off his retreat
 while I go and match transformations with him.&#8221; We shall say no more of
 Pig and the local god smashing their way into the cave as they had been
 instructed.</P>
<P>Putting away his gold-banded cudgel and saying the words of a spell
 while making the necessary hand movements, Monkey shook himself and
 turned into a vulture who soared up into the clouds with his wings
 beating noisily, then swooped down on the swan, seizing its neck and
 gouging at its eyes. Realizing that this was Sun Wukong transformed the
 Bull Demon King braced himself and turned into a golden eagle who
 gouged, back at the vulture. Then Monkey turned into a black phoenix to
 chase the eagle, only to be recognized by the Bull King, who turned
 into a white crane and flew off South with a loud call. Monkey stopped,
 braced his feathers, and turned into a red phoenix, who called loudly
 too. At the sight of the phoenix, the king of all the birds whom no
 bird dared treat with disrespect, the white crane swooped down beside
 the precipice with a beat of his wings, shook himself, and turned into
 a river-deer grazing in a timid, stupid way at the foot of the cliff.
 Monkey spotted him, came swooping down too, and turned into a hungry
 tiger that came running after the river-deer, swishing his tail
 hungrily. The demon king had to move fast as he transformed himself
 into a huge leopard with spots like golden coins who turned to savage
 the hungry tiger. Seeing this, Monkey faced the wind, shook himself,
 and turned into a golden-eyed lion with a voice like thunder, a brazen
 head and an iron brow. He spun round to devour the leopard, at which
 the Bull Demon King immediately became a giant bear that ran after the
 lion. Monkey then rolled himself up and became an elephant with tusks
 shaped like bamboo shoots, and a trunk like a python that he stretched
 out to wrap round the bear.</P>
<P>The Bull Demon King chuckled and switched back into his own original
 shape as a great white bull with a craggy head and flashing eyes. Each
 of his horns was like an iron pagoda, and his teeth were rows of sharp
 swords. He was about ten thousand feet long from head to tail and stood
 eight thousand feet high at the shoulder.</P>
<P>&#8220;What are you going to do to me now, damned macaque?&#8221; he shouted to
 Brother Monkey at the top of his voice; at which Monkey too reverted to
 his own form, pulled out his gold-banded cudgel, bowed forward and
 shouted &#8220;Grow!&#8221; He then grew to be a hundred thousand feet tall with a
 head like Mount Taishan, eyes like the sun and moon, a mouth like a
 pool of blood and teeth like doors. He raised his iron cudgel and
 struck at the Bull Demon King's head; and the Bull Demon King hardened
 his head and charged Monkey with his horns. This was a ridge-rocking,
 mountain-shaking, heaven-scaring, earth-frightening battle, and there
 is a poem to prove it that goes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Way grows by one foot, the demon by ten thousand;</P>
<P>The cunning mind-ape puts him down by force.</P>
<P>If the Fiery Mountains' flames are to be put out,</P>
<P>The precious fan must blow them cool.</P>
<P>The yellow-wife is determined to protect the primal ancient;</P>
<P>The mother of wood is set on wiping out the demons.</P>
<P>When the Five Elements are harmonized they return to the true
 achievement;</P>
<P>Evil and dirt are refined away as they travel to the West.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The two of them gave such a great display of their magic powers as
 they fought on the mountain that they alarmed all the deities, the
 Gold-headed Protector, the Six Jias, the Six Dings and the Eighteen
 Guardians of the Faith, who were passing through the air, came to
 surround the demon king. He was not in the least afraid as he butted to
 East and West with his straight, shining, iron horns, and lashed to
 North and South with his strong and hairy tail. Sun Wukong stood up to
 him head on while all the other gods surrounded him till in his despair
 the Bull Demon King rolled on the ground, turned back into his usual
 form, and headed for the Plantain Cave. Monkey too put away his magical
 form and joined in the chase with all the gods, but once in the cave
 the demon king shut the doors fast. The gods then threw a watertight
 encirclement around Mount Turquoise Cloud. Just when they were all
 about to storm the doors they heard the shouts of Pig arriving with the
 local god and his spirit soldiers.</P>
<P>&#8220;How are things in the Cloud-touching Cave?&#8221; Monkey asked, greeting
 him.</P>
<P>&#8220;I finished off Old Bull's woman with one blow from my rake,&#8221; grinned
 Pig, &#8220;and when I stripped her I found she was a jade-faced fox spirit.
 Her demons were all donkeys, mules, bulls, badgers, foxes, raccoon
 dogs, river-deer, goats, tigers, elk, deer and things like that. We
 killed the lot of them and burnt down all the buildings in the cave.
 The local god tells me he's got another woman who lives here, so we've
 come here to wipe her out too.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've done well, brother,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Congratulations. I tried
 competing with Old Bull in transformations, but I couldn't beat him. He
 turned into a simply enormous white bull, and I made myself as big as
 heaven and earth. We were just battling it out when all the gods came
 down and surrounded him. After a long time he turned back into himself
 and went into the cave.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Is this Plantain Cave?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes yes,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;Raksasi's in here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Then why don't we storm the place and wipe the lot of them out to
 get the fan?&#8221; said Pig, his blood still up. &#8220;Are we going to let the
 two of them live to be any older and wiser and love each other with
 tender passion?&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid idiot then summoned up his strength to bring his rake
 down on the doors so hard that doors, rock-face and all collapsed with
 a mighty rumble. The serving girls rushed inside to report, &#8220;Your
 Majesty, someone's smashed the doors in and we don't know who he is.&#8221;
 The Bull Demon King himself had just run panting in and was still
 telling Raksasi about his fight with Monkey for the fan when he heard
 this report, which made him very angry indeed.</P>
<P>At once he spat out the fan and gave it to Raksasi, who took it in
 her hands and said tearfully, &#8220;Your Majesty, give the macaque the fan
 if he'll call his troops off.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wife,&#8221; the Bull Demon King replied, &#8220;it may only be a little thing
 in itself, but I hate and loathe him. Wait here while I have it out
 with him again.&#8221; Once more the demon put on his armor, chose another
 pair of swords, and went out to find Pig smashing the doors down with
 his rake. Without a word Old Bull raised his swords and cut at Pig's
 head. Pig parried with his rake and fell back a few paces till he was
 outside the doors, where Monkey swung his cudgel at the Bull Demon
 King's head. The Bull Monster then mounted a storm wind and sprang away
 from the cave to fight Monkey once more on Mount Turquoise Cloud. All
 the gods surrounded him, while the local god's soldiers joined in the
 fray from either side. It was a splendid fight:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Mists obscured the world,</P>
<P>Fog shrouded heaven and earth.</P>
<P>A whistling evil wind sent sand and pebbles rolling;</P>
<P>Towering wrath had the ocean's waves breaking.</P>
<P>With a newly-sharpened pair of swords,</P>
<P>And a body encased in armor once more,</P>
<P>His hatred was deeper than the sea,</P>
<P>And loathing made his fury greater than ever.</P>
<P>In his pursuit of glory the Great Sage Equaling Heaven</P>
<P>No longer regarded the other as an old friend.</P>
<P>Pig was using his might to obtain the fan</P>
<P>While the gods and protectors tried to capture the Bull.</P>
<P>Neither of the Bull King's hands could rest</P>
<P>As he blocked to left and right with heavenly skill.</P>
<P>Birds folded their wings, unable to fly past;</P>
<P>Fish stopped leaping and sank to the bottom.</P>
<P>Ghosts wept, gods howled; the earth and sky were dark;</P>
<P>Dragons and tigers were terrified and the sun was dimmed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Bull Demon King fought over fifty rounds for all he was worth
 till he abandoned the field and fled North, unable to hold out any
 longer. He was soon blocked by the Vajrapani Bofa from the Hidden Demon
 Cave on Mount Wutai whose magical powers were very extensive. &#8220;Bull
 Monster,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;Where are you going? I have been commanded by
 the Lord Sakyamuni Buddha to spread out heaven-and-earth nets and
 arrest you here.&#8221;</P>
<P>As he spoke the Great Sage, Pig and all the gods caught up. In his
 desperation the demon king turned and fled South only to find his way
 blocked by the Vajrapani Shenzhi of the Cave of Cool Purity on Mount
 Emei, who shouted, &#8220;I am here on the Buddha's orders to take you.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Bull Demon King was now so terrified and exhausted that he turned
 and fled East, only to be blocked by the Vairocana monk, the Vajrapani
 Dali of Mo'er Cave on Mount Sumeru, who shouted, &#8220;Where are you going,
 Old Bull? I am on a secret mission from the Tathagata to catch you.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Bull Demon King withdrew in terror once more, this time to the
 West, where he came up against the imperishable king, the Vajrapani
 Yongzhu from the Golden Brightness Ridge on Mount Kunlun, shouting,
 &#8220;Where are you going, damn you? I have been personally instructed by
 the venerable Buddha of the Thunder Monastery in the Western Heaven to
 cut off your escape this way. Nobody will let you pass.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Old Bull was now trembling with fear, but it was too late for
 regrets. On all sides he was surrounded by the Buddha's troops and
 heavenly generals. It really was as if he were caught in a high net
 from which there was no escape. In his despair he heard Monkey coming
 after him at the head of his forces, so he sprang on his cloud and went
 up.</P>
<P>At just that moment Heavenly King Li the Pagoda-carrier was encamped
 in the sky with Prince Nezha, the Fish-bellied Yaksa and the Mighty
 Miracle God.</P>
<P>&#8220;Not so fast,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;not so fast. I am here on the mandate of
 the Jade Emperor to exterminate you.&#8221; In his extremity the Bull Demon
 King shook himself, turned back into the giant white bull, and tried to
 gore the Heavenly King with his iron horns, while the Heavenly King
 hacked at him with his sword. Soon Brother Monkey arrived.</P>
<P>&#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; Prince Nezha shouted at the top of his voice, &#8220;I can't
 greet you properly as I'm in armor. Yesterday my father and I went to
 see the Tathagata Buddha, who sent a note to the Jade Emperor. It said
 that the Tang Priest was held up by the Fiery Mountains and that you
 couldn't subdue the Bull Demon King, Great Sage. The Jade Emperor then
 ordered my father to bring his forces here to help.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But this damned creature's magical powers are tremendous,&#8221; Monkey
 replied, &#8220;and he's turned himself into this. What are we going to do
 about him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Have no doubts,&#8221; replied Nezha with a smile. &#8220;Watch me catch him.&#8221;</P>
<P>The prince then shouted, &#8220;Change!&#8221; gave himself three heads and six
 arms, and took a flying leap upon the Bull Demon King's back. With one
 swing of his demon-beheading sword he had the bull's head off before he
 even realized he had done it. The Heavenly King threw down his sword
 and went to meet Monkey. But another head grew out from the Bull Demon
 King's throat, its mouth breathing black vapors and its eyes flashing
 golden light. Nezha cut again, but as the head fell a new one appeared.
 Nezha's sword cut a dozen heads off and a dozen new heads immediately
 grew again. Nezha then hung his fire-wheel on the bull's horns, blew on
 the magic fire, and made it blaze so fiercely that the Bull Demon King
 bellowed in desperate pain, shaking his head and tail and trying for
 all he was worth to escape.</P>
<P>Just when he was about to do another transformation and get away his
 true image was fixed in Heavenly King Li's demon-revealing mirror. Now
 he could make no more changes and he had no way of escape.</P>
<P>He could only call out, &#8220;Spare my life! I wish to be converted to the
 Buddhist faith.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you value your life, hand the fan over at once,&#8221; said Nezha. &#8220;My
 wife is looking after it,&#8221; the Bull Demon King replied.</P>
<P>Hearing this reply, Nezha undid his demon-binding rope and slipped it
 round his neck, then took him by the nose, ran the rope through it, and
 led him along by hand. Monkey meanwhile gathered together the four
 vajrapanis, the Six Dings, the Six Jias, the Guardians of the Faith,
 Heavenly King Li, the Mighty Miracle God, Pig, the local god and the
 spirit soldiers to crowd around the white bull and lead him back to the
 entrance to the Plantain Cave.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wife,&#8221; Old Bull called, &#8220;bring the fan out and save my life.&#8221; As
 soon as she heard this Raksasi took off her jewelry and bright-coloured
 clothing, dressed her hair like a Taoist nun and put on a white silk
 habit like a Buddhist one.</P>
<P>She came out through the doors carrying the twelve-foot fan with both
 hands, and at the sight of the vajrapanis, the gods, the Heavenly King
 and Nezha she fell to her knees in terror, kowtowing in worship and
 saying, &#8220;I beg you Bodhisattvas to spare my husband and me. I present
 the fan to my brother-in-law Monkey for him to win his glory with.&#8221;
 Monkey went forward, took the fan, and rode back East by auspicious
 cloud with the others.</P>
<P>Sanzang and Friar Sand had been waiting a very long time, sometimes
 sitting and sometimes standing, for Monkey to come back. They were
 extremely anxious by the time the sky was suddenly filled with
 auspicious clouds and the earth was lit up by blessed light as all the
 gods came whistling through the air towards them. &#8220;Wujing,&#8221; said the
 venerable elder in terror, &#8220;whose divine soldiers are coming from over
 there?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Friar Sand, who could recognize them, &#8220;it's the four
 vajrapanis, the Golden-headed Protector, the Six Jias, the Six Dings,
 the Guardians of the Faith and all the other passing gods. The one
 leading the bull is Prince Nezha, and there's Heavenly King Li the
 Pagoda-carrier holding a mirror. My eldest brother is carrying the
 plantain fan, and that's second brother and the local god behind him.
 The others are all escort troops.&#8221;</P>
<P>Hearing this, Sanzang put on his Vairocana mitre and his cassock then
 went with Friar Sand to welcome the gods and thank them with these
 words: &#8220;What merits do I, your disciple, have that I put all you holy
 ones to the trouble of coming down to earth?&#8221;</P>
<P>To this the four vajrapanis replied, &#8220;Congratulations, holy monk. The
 great task has now been achieved. We were sent to help you on the
 Buddha's orders. You must now continue your self-cultivation and not
 slacken for a moment.&#8221; Sanzang replied amid kowtows that he accepted
 their commands.</P>
<P>The Great Sage Sun took the fan close to the Fiery Mountains, waved
 it as hard as he could, and put the flames out. Their glare
 disappeared. He waved the fan again and the rustle of a cool breeze
 could be heard; and at the third wave the sky was overcast with cloud
 and a fine rain began to fall. There is a poem that bears witness to
 this:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>For hundreds of miles the mountains of fire</P>
<P>Lit heaven and earth with notorious flames.</P>
<P>When fire roasts the five passions the elixir cannot be made.</P>
<P>When flame burns the three passes the Way is not pure.</P>
<P>To borrow the plantain fan and bring down rain,</P>
<P>Heavenly gods had to help with their spiritual power.</P>
<P>When the bull is led to the Buddha it must stop being evil;</P>
<P>When water and fire are allied the nature is calm.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Having been relieved of his cares Sanzang stopped worrying. All the
 hosts then reverently thanked the vajrapanis, who all returned to their
 mountains, and the Six Dings and Six Jias went back into the sky to
 give their protection. The deities who had been passing by all went on
 their way; and the Heavenly King and Nezha led the bull back to hand
 him over to the Buddha. This left only the local mountain god waiting
 there with Raksasi under his guard.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why aren't you on your way, Raksasi?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;What are you
 standing there waiting for?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I beg you in your mercy, Great Sage,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;to give me back
 the fan.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've got a cheek, damned bitch,&#8221; roared Pig. &#8220;We've spared your
 life and that should be enough for you. What do you want the fan for?
 When we've crossed the mountains we'll be able to sell it for food. Do
 you think we're going to give it to you after all the trouble and
 effort we've been to? It's raining, so be off home with you.&#8221;</P>
<P>She bowed again and said, &#8220;But the Great Sage promised to give it
 back when he'd put the fire out. I'm very sorry about all that has
 happened. It was only because I was feeling so upset that I put you to
 all that trouble. We too have learned to live like human beings. The
 only thing is that we had not been converted to the pursuit of the true
 achievement. Now our true bodies have turned to the West, and we will
 not dare do anything wicked again. I beg you to return the fan so that
 I can reform and cultivate myself.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; said the local deity, &#8220;let us make full use of this
 woman's knowledge of the art of extinguishing fire to put these fires
 out for good, and give her back her fan. Then I will be able to live
 here in peace, help the people who live here, and be given offerings of
 blood and food. This would truly be a great kindness to me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I heard the local people saying that when the fan puts the flames
 out in these mountains they can only gather one harvest before they
 start burning again,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;How are we going to be able to put
 them out forever?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;All you have to do to put the flames out forever,&#8221; said Raksasi, &#8220;is
 wave the fan forty-nine times. Then they'll never burn again.&#8221;</P>
<P>Now that Brother Monkey knew this he took the fan and fanned the
 mountains with it forty-nine times as hard as he possibly could,
 whereupon heavy rain began to pour down. The fan really was a treasure:
 where there were flames it rained, and where there were not the sky was
 clear. By standing where there no flames master and disciples avoided
 getting wet. After spending the night sitting there they got the horse
 and luggage ready the next morning and returned the fan to Raksasi.</P>
<P>&#8220;If I don't give it back to you,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;people might say I
 don't keep my word. Take the fan with you, go back to your mountain and
 don't make any more trouble. As you've achieved human form I'll spare
 your life.&#8221; Taking the fan from him Raksasi said the words of the
 spell, pinched the thread so that it shrank back to the size of an
 apricot leaf and put it in her mouth. She then thanked them all and
 prepared to cultivate her conduct as a hermit. Later she too achieved
 the true reward and her name was made eternally famous through the
 scriptures. Raksasi and the local god expressed their deep gratitude to
 the four sages and escorted them along their way. As Monkey, Pig and
 Friar Sand escorted Sanzang along his way their bodies felt cool and
 the ground under their feet was pleasantly damp. This was indeed a case

<P>Through all the hours it must never be forgotten:</P>
<P>When success is won all time will be put away.</P>
<P>For five years and sixty thousand miles</P>
<P>Do not let the holy water dry up,</P>
<P>Do not allow the fire to flag.</P>
<P>When water and fire are in balance no harm will arise;</P>
<P>The Five Elements are joined as if with hooks.</P>
<P>Ying and Yang in harmony climb the cloud tower,</P>
<P>Riding the phoenix to the purple palace,</P>
<P>And flying on the crane to magical Yingzhou.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This lyric is set to the tune<I> Lin jiang xian.</I> It tells how
 Tang Sanzang and his disciples with the help of water and fire cooled
 their natures and borrowed the fan that was pure Yin to blow out the
 flames on the distant mountains. It took them many days to cover the
 250 miles as they made their way West feeling relaxed and free of care.
 It was now the time when late autumn was becoming early winter, and
 this is what they saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The petals of wild chrysanthemums wilting,</P>
<P>The tender new blossom of the plum.</P>
<P>In all the villages crops are gathered in;</P>
<P>Delicious broth is everywhere enjoyed.</P>
<P>As the trees are stripped of leaves distant forests can be seen;</P>
<P>Ravines are thickly frosted and the quiet valleys pure.</P>
<P>In response to the cold season</P>
<P>The silkworms are put away to hibernate.</P>
<P>In pure Yin and Yang</P>
<P>The moon rules over the primal ocean;</P>
<P>Where water is at the full</P>
<P>Shun's sun shines with merciful brightness.</P>
<P>Earth vapors sink,</P>
<P>Sky vapors rise.</P>
<P>The rainbow is no more to be seen,</P>
<P>While slowly ice forms over the pond.</P>
<P>Flowers fall from the creepers on the cliff,</P>
<P>While bamboo and pine show still greener in the cold.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the four of them had traveled a lot further they approached a
 walled and moated city. Reining in the horse the Tang Priest spoke to
 his disciples: &#8220;Wukong, what sort of place is that with all those tall
 and magnificent buildings?&#8221; Monkey looked and saw that the city was
 like this:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A wall of bronze, shaped like a dragon,</P>
<P>And in the form of a crouching tiger,</P>
<P>From all directions fine carriages approach</P>
<P>And many a wheel has smoothed the roads to it.</P>
<P>Amazing beasts are carved on the balustrades of marble;</P>
<P>Statues of great men stand on pedestals of gold.</P>
<P>This is indeed a blessed capital,</P>
<P>A true metropolis.</P>
<P>Its vast domains are firmly held;</P>
<P>The dynasty has flourished for a thousand years.</P>
<P>To the monarch's goodness the barbarians submit;</P>
<P>Here is the holy gathering from islands and from sea.</P>
<P>Before the palace steps is purity;</P>
<P>Peace reigns on the highways.</P>
<P>The bars are full of noise and song;</P>
<P>Bliss is found in the houses of pleasure.</P>
<P>Outside the palace grow trees of eternal spring</P>
<P>Where phoenixes sing their greetings to the dawn.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;that city is a royal capital.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The world is full of prefectural cities and county seats,&#8221; laughed
 Pig. &#8220;What makes you so sure that this is a royal capital?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't seem to realize that royal capitals are different from
 prefectural cities and county towns,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Just look. It's
 got over ten gates and the wall must measure twenty or thirty miles
 around. Those towers are so high they disappear into the clouds. How
 could anything except a royal capital be as grand as that?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right, brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;it is a royal city. But
 what's it called?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How can I tell?&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;There aren't any signs or banners.
 We'll have to go into it and ask.&#8221;</P>
<P>The venerable elder whipped on his horse and was soon at a gate,
 where he dismounted to cross the bridge and go in to look. They saw the
 six main streets and the three markets, where commerce was flourishing,
 as well as the imposing clothes of the noble and great. Then as they
 were walking along they saw a dozen or so Buddhist monks in chains and
 cangues, heavy boards locked round their necks, begging from door to
 door. They were dressed in rags.</P>
<P>&#8220;The fox mourns for the death of the hare,&#8221; sighed Sanzang. &#8220;All
 things are sorry for their own kind. Go and ask them, Wukong, why they
 are being punished like that.&#8221;</P>
<P>Doing as he had been told, Monkey asked, &#8220;What monastery are you
 from, monks? Why are you in cangues and chains?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; said the monks, all falling to their knees, &#8220;we are from
 the Golden Light Monastery and we have been wronged.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where is the Golden Light Monastery?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Just round the corner,&#8221; they replied.</P>
<P>Monkey led them to the Tang Priest and asked them, &#8220;How have you been
 wronged? Tell me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We don't know where you're from, but you look a little familiar to
 us, my lords,&#8221; the monks replied. &#8220;We don't dare talk here. Please come
 to our poor monastery where we can tell you our woes.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the venerable elder, &#8220;we shall go to their
 monastery and ask them all the details.&#8221; They went with them to the
 monastery gate, over which was a board on which was written in letters
 of gold</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>NATION-PROTECTING GOLDEN LIGHT MONASTERY</P>
<P>FOUNDED BY ROYAL COMMAND</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When master and disciples went inside to look around this is what
 they saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Cold were the lamps in the ancient hall;</P>
<P>Wind blew the leaves along deserted cloisters.</P>
<P>A thousand-foot pagoda touched the clouds;</P>
<P>Pine trees grew to nourish the nature.</P>
<P>Fallen blooms carpeted the unvisited grounds;</P>
<P>Spiders span cobwebs all over the eaves.</P>
<P>The drum-stand was empty,</P>
<P>The bell hung in vain,</P>
<P>And the frescoes could barely be seen through the dust.</P>
<P>Still was the pulpit where no priest could be seen,</P>
<P>Silent the dhyana hall except for the birds.</P>
<P>The desolation made one long to sigh;</P>
<P>Its dreariness caused great pain.</P>
<P>Although an incense burner stood before the Buddha</P>
<P>All was cold ash, withered flowers and desolation.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>All this made Sanzang miserable, and he could not help his tears
 flowing. The monks in their cangues and chains pushed open the doors of
 the main Buddha-hall and invited him to step inside and worship the
 Buddha. Sanzang entered, offered the incense of his heart and said the
 recitation three times. Then he turned round again to see six or seven
 young monks locked to the pillars outside the abbot's lodgings. It was
 more than he could bear.</P>
<P>When he entered the abbot's lodgings and all the monks came to kowtow
 to him they asked, &#8220;You reverend gentlemen look rather different. Are
 you from Great Tang in the East?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You must have second sight,&#8221; Monkey said with a laugh. &#8220;We are
 indeed, but how could you tell?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We don't have second sight, my lords,&#8221; the monks replied. &#8220;It's just
 that because we're so distressed at the injustice we've suffered and
 because there's nowhere else we can turn, we have been calling on
 heaven and earth for days on end. Some heavenly deity must have been
 moved by us because last night we all had the same dream. We were told
 that a holy monk was coming from Great Tang in the East who would save
 our lives and right our wrongs. We knew who you were today because you
 looked rather unusual.&#8221;</P>
<P>This pleased Sanzang greatly. &#8220;What country is this, and what
 injustice have you suffered?&#8221; he asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; said the monks on their knees, &#8220;this country is called
 Jisai, and it's one of the biggest in the West. In the old days the
 foreign states all around used to send tribute: Yuetuo in the South,
 Gaochang to the North, Western Liang in the East, and Benbo to the
 West. Every year they used to offer fine jade, bright pearls, beautiful
 women and magnificent horses. We never had to resort to arms or send
 expeditions against them: they naturally acknowledged us as their
 suzerain.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If they did that your king must understand the Way and your civil
 and military officials be wise and good,&#8221; Sanzang said.</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; the monks replied to Sanzang's question, &#8220;our country's
 civil officials are not wise, our generals are not good, and our
 monarch does not understand the Way. Auspicious clouds used to gather
 round the pagoda of our monastery and mists of good omen rose high
 above it. The glow above it at night could once be seen from thousands
 of miles away; the coloured vapors were admired by the countries all
 around. That was why this was a divinely-appointed capital to which all
 the foreigners sent tribute. But three years ago at midnight on the
 first day of the first month of autumn it rained blood. The next
 morning everyone was terrified and miserable. All the ministers
 submitted a memorial to the throne: they didn't understand why heaven
 was so angry with us. Taoists were asked to perform purifications and
 Buddhist monks to recite sutras as an offering to heaven and earth.
 Goodness only knows why, but our golden pagoda has been contaminated,
 and for the last two years no foreign countries have sent tribute. Our
 king wanted to send armies to punish them, but the officials said that
 the reason why foreign countries weren't sending tribute was that the
 auspicious clouds and mists of good omen had disappeared, and this was
 because we monks had stolen the treasure from the pagoda in our
 monastery. The stupid king did not investigate, and those corrupt
 officials had all us monks arrested. We have been beaten and tortured
 in every possible way. There used to be three generations of us monks
 in this monastery, but the two older generations both died off because
 they couldn't take the beating and torture. Now we've been arrested and
 made to wear these cangues and chains. Your Honour, we could never be
 so wicked as to steal the treasure from the pagoda. We implore you to
 take pity on your fellows and in your great mercy and compassion make
 wide use of your dharma powers and save our lives.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this Sanzang nodded and said with a sigh, &#8220;This is an obscure
 business that will be hard to sort out. The court is ruling badly, and
 you are suffering a calamity. If it was the rain of blood that
 contaminated your pagoda why did you not report the fact to your king
 at the time? Instead you let yourselves in for this calamity.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We are only common mortals, your lordship, and had no way-of telling
 what heaven had in mind. Besides, our elders didn't understand. What
 could we be expected to do about it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What's the time, Wukong?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;About four in the afternoon,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;I would like to see the king to present our passport,&#8221; Sanzang said,
 &#8220;but I cannot solve these monks' problem and report on it to His
 Majesty. When I left Chang'an I made a vow in the Famen Monastery that
 on my journey West I would burn incense at every temple I passed,
 worship the Buddha in every monastery I came across, and sweep every
 pagoda I saw. Today I have met these monks who have been wronged on
 account of their pagoda. Will you get me a new broom while I take a
 bath? I shall then go up to sweep it and find out what has contaminated
 it and why it does not gleam any longer. Once I have found out the
 truth it will be much easier to report on it in person to the king and
 rescue them from their misery.&#8221;</P>
<P>As soon as the monks in cangues and chains heard this they hurried to
 the kitchen to fetch a big vegetable chopper that they handed to Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;Take this chopper, your lordship,&#8221; they said, &#8220;and cut through the
 iron locks holding the young monks to the pillars so that they can
 prepare you some food and tea and wait on your master while he eats and
 bathes. Meanwhile we shall go out on the streets again to beg for a new
 broom for your master to sweep the pagoda with.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no problem about opening locks,&#8221; laughed Pig. &#8220;We don't need
 knives or axes. Just ask the hairy-faced gentleman: he's been opening
 locks for years.&#8221; Monkey then stepped forward and used lock-opening
 magic: one touch and the locks all fell open. The young monks all ran
 into the kitchen to clean up the cooking pots and stove and prepare the
 meal. When Sanzang and his disciples had eaten and it was gradually
 getting dark the monks in cangues and chains came in with two brooms to
 Sanzang's great delight.</P>
<P>As they were talking a young monk came in to light the lamp and
 invite Sanzang to take his bath. By now the sky was bright with the
 moon and the stars, and from the look-out towers the watches of the
 night were being beaten out on the drum. It was indeed the time when</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Cold breezes blow around the walls,</P>
<P>And lamps are lit in every house.</P>
<P>Along the streets all the doors are shut;</P>
<P>The gates of the three markets are all closed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The fishing boat is sheltered under the trees;</P>
<P>The ploughing ox is let off its rope.</P>
<P>The woodman gives his axe a rest,</P>
<P>While the schoolboy can be heard reciting his lessons.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Sanzang had bathed he put on a narrow-sleeved tunic, tightened
 the belt around his waist, put on a pair of boots, and took the new
 brooms. &#8220;You sleep here while I sweep the pagoda,&#8221; he said to the
 monks.</P>
<P>&#8220;The pagoda was contaminated by the rain of blood,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;and
 it hasn't shone for many a long day. There may be evil things living up
 there. If you go up by yourself on this cold and windy night I'm
 worried that something might go wrong. Why don't I go with you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very good idea,&#8221; Sanzang replied, and each carrying a broom they
 first went up into the main Buddha hall, where Sanzang lit the glazed
 lamp, burned incense, and bowed to the Buddha saying, &#8220;Your disciple
 Chen Xuanzang has been sent by the Great Tang in the East to worship
 out Tathagata Buddha on Vulture Peak and fetch the scriptures. I have
 now reached the Golden Light Monastery in the kingdom of Jisai, where
 the monks tell me that their pagoda has been contaminated and that they
 have been unjustly punished because the king suspects them of having
 stolen the treasure. Your disciple is now going devoutly to sweep the
 tower in the hope that my Buddha in his great responsiveness will
 reveal the cause of the contamination and spare these folk from
 injustice.&#8221;</P>
<P>When he had prayed he and Brother Monkey opened the door of the
 pagoda and began to sweep it from the ground upwards. That pagoda</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Towered to the stars,</P>
<P>Thrust up into space.</P>
<P>It was called the glazed tile pagoda,</P>
<P>The golden sarira spire.</P>
<P>The stairway spiraled like the inside of a cave;</P>
<P>The door seemed to be the door of a coop.</P>
<P>The gleam of the vase reached the moon at the horizon;</P>
<P>The sea breeze carried the sound of its bells.</P>
<P>Look at the eaves and corbel brackets,</P>
<P>The finial in the clouds.</P>
<P>The eaves and corbel brackets</P>
<P>Were of masonry through which the scented breezes blew.</P>
<P>The finial in the clouds</P>
<P>Had mist dragons coiling around the pagoda.</P>
<P>The view stretched out for hundreds of miles;</P>
<P>To climb it was to climb to the heavens.</P>
<P>At the doors of every story were set glazed lamps,</P>
<P>But full of dust, not light.</P>
<P>All around under the eaves ran marble balustrades,</P>
<P>Covered with filth and insects.</P>
<P>Inside the tower,</P>
<P>By the Buddha statues,</P>
<P>Incense no longer burned.</P>
<P>Outside the windows,</P>
<P>In front of the divine face,</P>
<P>Cobwebs covered all.</P>
<P>The incense-burners were full of mouse-droppings,</P>
<P>The lamps untouched by oil.</P>
<P>Because the treasure had been spirited away</P>
<P>Many a monk had died for nothing.</P>
<P>Sanzang was determined to sweep out the pagoda</P>
<P>And restore to it the beauty that it had before.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When he had swept one story the Tang Priest went on to sweep the
 next, and so he continued till he reached the seventh story. By now it
 was the second watch of the night and he was beginning to feel
 exhausted.</P>
<P>&#8220;You're tired,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;Sit here and let me sweep it for you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How many stories does it have?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;About thirteen I suppose,&#8221; Monkey replied. Overcoming his weariness
 the Tang Priest said, &#8220;I must sweep it myself to fulfil the vow.&#8221; By
 the time he had swept another three stories his back and his legs were
 aching. At the tenth he collapsed and said, &#8220;Sweep the last three
 floors for me, Wukong.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey summoned up his energy, went to the eleventh floor, and a
 moment later up to the twelfth. As he was sweeping there he heard
 voices from in the roof. &#8220;That's odd,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;Very odd indeed.
 It's the third watch. They can't be people talking up there as late as
 this. I'm sure it's evil spirits. Let's have a look.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Monkey King put his broom quietly under his arm, tucked
 up his clothes, slipped out through the door, and stepped on a cloud to
 take a better look. Sitting in the middle of the thirteenth story were
 two evil spirits with a dish of food, a bowl, and a jug of wine. They
 were playing the finger-guessing game and drinking.</P>
<P>Monkey used his magic powers to get rid of the broom and bring out
 his gold-banded cudgel, with which he barricaded the entrance to the
 pagoda and shouted, &#8220;So you're the ones who stole the pagoda's
 treasure, you monsters.&#8221; The two of them jumped up in their panic,
 grabbed the jug and bowl, and flung them at him. Monkey deflected them
 with his iron cudgel and said, &#8220;I won't kill you because I need you to
 give evidence.&#8221;</P>
<P>He just used his cudgel to force them to talk. The devils were pinned
 against the wall, unable to struggle or even move. All they could do
 was to repeat, &#8220;Spare us, spare us. It was nothing to do with us. The
 thief isn't here.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey used holding magic to carry them single-handed down to the
 tenth story, where he said, &#8220;Master, I've got the thieves.&#8221;</P>
<P>This news woke up Sanzang, who had been dozing, with a start of
 pleasure. &#8220;Where did you catch them?&#8221; he asked.</P>
<P>Dragging the demons over and forcing them to kneel to his master
 Monkey replied, &#8220;They were drinking and playing finger-guessing up in
 the roof. When I heard the din they were making I shot up by cloud to
 the roof and blocked their escape. I wasn't rough with them because I
 was worried that a single blow would kill them and we'd have nobody to
 give evidence. That's why I brought them here nice and gently. You can
 take statements from them, Master, and find out where they're from and
 where the stolen treasure has been hidden.&#8221;</P>
<P>The demons were still shivering and shaking and saying, &#8220;Spare us!&#8221;
 Then they made this true statement. &#8220;We were sent by the Infinitely
 Sage Dragon King of the Green Wave Pool on the Ragged Rock Mountain.
 His name's Benborba and mine is Baborben. He's catfish spirit and I'm a
 snakehead fish spirit. Our Infinitely Sage Ancient Dragon has a
 daughter called the Infinitely Sage Princess. She is as lovely as
 flowers or the moon and brilliant as well. The Ancient Dragon got a
 husband for her who would live in the palace. He has tremendous magic
 powers and he's called Prince Ninehead. He came here the other year
 with the dragon king to demonstrate his powers by making a blood rain
 that contaminated the pagoda and stealing the precious sarira relic of
 the Buddha. The princess then went up to the Daluo Heaven and stole the
 Queen Mother's nine-lobed magic fungus plant from in front of the Hall
 of Miraculous Mist. We keep it at the bottom of the pool, and it shines
 day and night with golden light and a coloured glow. Recently we've
 heard that Sun Wukong is on his way to fetch the scriptures from the
 Western Heaven. They say his powers are enormous, and that all along
 the way he has been looking out for wrongs to right. That's why we keep
 getting sent here to patrol and stop him when the comes. If that Sun
 Wukong turns up we're ready for him.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this Monkey gave a mocking laugh. &#8220;What an evil beast,&#8221; he said.
 &#8220;He's unspeakable. No wonder he invited the Bull Demon King to his
 place for a banquet the other day. He's been extending his contacts
 among all these damned demons because he's up to no good.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before he had finished speaking Pig and two or three of the young
 monks came up the steps from the bottom of the pagoda with lanterns.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; Pig said, &#8220;why don't you go to bed now that you've swept
 the pagoda instead of staying here talking?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've come at just the right moment, brother,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;The
 pagoda's treasure was stolen by the Infinitely Sage Ancient Dragon. He
 sent these two little devils I've just captured to patrol the pagoda
 and keep their ears open for news of us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What are they called, and what sort of spirits are they?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;They've just confessed everything,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;This one's
 called Benborba and he's a catfish spirit, and that one's Baborben and
 he's a snakehead fish spirit.&#8221; Pig then lifted his rake to strike them.</P>
<P>&#8220;If they're evil spirits and they've already confessed,&#8221; he said,
 &#8220;what are we waiting for? Let's kill them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you don't understand. Keep them alive so that
 they can tell it all to the king and lead us to catch the thieves and
 get the treasure back.&#8221; The splendid idiot then put his rake down
 again. He and Monkey each carried one of them down the stairs.</P>
<P>&#8220;Spare us,&#8221; the demons kept pleading.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'd like to turn you two fish into soup for those monks who've been
 mistreated so unjustly,&#8221; muttered Pig.</P>
<P>The two or three young monks, who were thoroughly delighted, led the
 venerable elder down the pagoda stairs with their lanterns. One of them
 ran ahead to tell the other monks.</P>
<P>&#8220;Good news,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;good news! Our troubles are over. The
 reverend gentlemen have caught the evil spirits who stole the
 treasure.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Fetch chains,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;run them through their shoulder-bones,
 and lock them up here. Watch over them while we get some sleep. We'll
 decide what to do next tomorrow.&#8221; The monks then kept a very close
 watch on the demons while Sanzang and his disciples slept.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Before they knew it it was dawn. &#8220;Wukong and I will go to court to
 present the passport,&#8221; Sanzang said, and he put on his brocade cassock
 and Vairocana mitre. When he was dressed in his majestic vestments he
 strode forward, accompanied by Monkey, who had tightened his tigerskin
 kilt and straightened up his tunic and was carrying the passport.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why aren't you taking those two demons with you?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;We'll submit a memorial to the throne first,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;then
 I expect the king will send men for them.&#8221; They then went to the palace
 gates, seeing no end of red birds and golden dragons adorning the deep
 red gateways of the pure capital.</P>
<P>At the Gate of Eastern Splendor Sanzang bowed to the officer in
 charge and said, &#8220;May I trouble Your Honour to report that a monk sent
 from Great Tang in the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western
 Heaven begs an audience with His Majesty to present his passport?&#8221;</P>
<P>The gate officer did indeed make this report, going to the steps of
 the throne to say, &#8220;There are two Buddhist monks with strange faces and
 strange clothes outside who say they have been sent by the Tang court
 in the East of the Southern Continent of Jambu to go to the West to
 worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures. They request an audience
 with Your Majesty in order to present their passport.&#8221; The king then
 sent for them.</P>
<P>As the Tang Priest took him into the palace all the civilian and
 military officials were alarmed at the sight of Monkey. Some called him
 the monkey monk, and others the thunder-god monk; they were all too
 terrified to look at him for very long. The Tang Priest bowed to the
 king with a dance and a loud chant of obeisance, while the Great Sage
 stood leaning to one side with his arms crossed, not moving.</P>
<P>The venerable elder then submitted this memorial: &#8220;I am a priest who
 has been sent by the Great Tang in the East of the Southern Continent
 of Jambu to worship the Buddha and fetch the true scriptures in Thunder
 Monastery in the land of India in the West. As my route lies across
 your distinguished country I would not dare cross without
 authorization, and I beg you to verify the passport I have with me and
 allow me to proceed.&#8221;</P>
<P>The king was very pleased to hear all this, so he summoned the holy
 priest from Tang to the throne hall, where an embroidered stool was set
 for him to sit on. Sanzang went into the hall by himself and handed
 over the passport before gratefully accepting the courtesy stool.</P>
<P>When the king read the passport through he was delighted. &#8220;It appears
 that when your Great Tang emperor was ill he could choose an eminent
 monk who would not flinch from a long journey to worship the Buddha and
 fetch the scriptures. But all the monks in our country want to do is to
 steal, thus destroying the country and ruining their sovereign.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Sanzang heard this he put his hands together and replied, &#8220;How
 can you be so sure they are destroying the country and ruining their
 sovereign?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This country of ours is the leading one in the Western Regions. The
 foreign states all around always used to send tribute because of the
 golden pagoda in the Golden Light Monastery in this capital. A
 multicolored glow used to shine from the pagoda right up to the sky.
 But recently the pagoda's treasure has been stolen by the wicked monks
 in the monastery, and for three years now there has been no coloured
 glow and no tribute from the foreigners. It is all extremely upsetting
 for us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; said Sanzang, smiling as he put his hands together in
 front of his chest, &#8220;a little mistake can lead to a great disaster.
 Soon after entering the gates of your heavenly capital yesterday I saw
 a dozen or so monks in cangues. When I asked them why they told me that
 they were from the Golden Light Monastery and were the victims of
 injustice. On close investigation in the monastery I found that it was
 no fault of the monks there. When I swept the pagoda in the middle of
 the night I captured the thieving devils who had stolen the treasure.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are they?&#8221; asked the delighted king.</P>
<P>&#8220;My disciples have them locked up in the Golden Light Monastery,&#8221;
 Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>The king ordered royal guards to be sent at once to the Golden Light
 Monastery to fetch the thieving devils so that he could interrogate
 them himself. &#8220;Your Majesty, I think it would be best if my disciple
 went with the guards.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221; the king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Standing by the steps of the throne,&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>The king was shocked by what he saw. &#8220;How can your disciple be so
 ugly when you, reverend sir, are so handsome?&#8221; he asked.</P>
<P>When he heard this the Great Sage Sun shouted at the top of his
 voice, &#8220;Your Majesty, you should no more judge people by their faces
 than you'd measure the sea with a bucket. Good looks would never have
 captured the thieving devils.&#8221;</P>
<P>This calmed the king's alarm, and he said, &#8220;You are right, holy monk.
 We do not know how to select men of talent here. The ones who catch the
 thieves and recover the treasure are best.&#8221; He then ordered his aides
 to have a carriage prepared and told the royal guards to look after the
 holy monk as he went to fetch the thieving devils. The aides had a
 large palanquin with a yellow canopy got ready in which eight guardsmen
 carried Monkey with eight more as escorts who shouted to clear the way
 to the Golden Light Monastery. By now the whole city had heard the
 news; everyone came out to see the holy monk and the thieving devils.</P>
<P>Hearing the shouts Pig and Friar Sand, imagining that the king must
 have sent some of his officials, hurried out to meet them, only to see
 Monkey riding in the palanquin. &#8220;Now you're yourself again, brother,&#8221;
 laughed Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; Monkey asked, putting his hand on Pig to steady
 himself as he stepped out of the chair.</P>
<P>&#8220;There you are, being carried by eight men in a carrying chair under
 a royal yellow canopy,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;Isn't that the way the Handsome
 Monkey King should travel? That's why I said you're yourself again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop joking,&#8221; said Monkey, who then had the two devils brought for
 him to escort to the king.</P>
<P>&#8220;Won't you take me along too?&#8221; Friar Sand asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;You stay here and look after the luggage and the horse,&#8221; Monkey
 replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;My lords,&#8221; said the monks in cangues and chains, &#8220;why don't you all
 go to see His Majesty? We can look after your things here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case we'll all go to report to the king,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;and
 then have you released.&#8221; With Pig manhandling one devil and Friar Sand
 the other, Monkey got back into the palanquin, and led the devils to
 the court.</P>
<P>They were soon at the steps of the throne hall, where the king was
 told that the devils had arrived. He came down from his dragon throne
 to examine them with the Tang Priest and his civil and military
 officials. One of the devils had bulging cheeks, black scales, a
 pointed mouth and sharp teeth. The other had slimy skin, a fat belly, a
 big mouth and long whiskers. Although they had legs and could walk it
 was obvious that they had only assumed a certain appearance of humanity
 through transformation.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you from, you thieving devils, you evil spirits?&#8221; the king
 asked. &#8220;How long have you been preying on this country? Which year did
 you steal our treasure? How many of you bandits are there? What are
 your names? I want it all, and I want the truth.&#8221; The two devils fell
 to their knees before him, and although blood was gushing from their
 necks they did not feel the pain. This was what they had to say:</P>
<P>&#8220;Three years ago, on the first day of the seventh month, the
 Infinitely Sage Dragon King brought a crowd of his relations to live in
 the Southeast corner of this country, in the Green Wave Pool on Ragged
 Rock Mountain about forty miles from here. He has an extremely
 attractive daughter for whom he found a husband to live in our palace,
 Prince Ninehead. His magic powers are unbeatable. He knew that you had
 a rare treasure in your tower, so he plotted with the dragon king to
 steal it. First he made it rain blood and then he stole the Buddha
 relic. Now it lights up the dragon palace, which is as bright as day
 even in the darkest night. Then the princess used her powers to sneak
 up and steal the Queen Mother's magic fungus to keep the treasure warm
 in the pool. We two aren't the bandit chiefs. We're just private
 soldiers sent here by the dragon king who were captured last night.
 This is the truth.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As you have made this confession,&#8221; the king said, &#8220;why don't you
 tell me your names?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am Benborba,&#8221; one of them replied, &#8220;and he is Baborben. I am a
 catfish monster and he is a snakehead monster.&#8221;</P>
<P>The king then told the royal guards to keep them safely behind bars
 and ordered, &#8220;Release all the monks of the Golden Light Monastery from
 their cangues and chains, and have the Office of Foreign Affairs
 prepare a banquet in the Unicom Hall to congratulate the holy monks on
 their great achievements in catching the thieves. We shall now invite
 them to capture the ringleaders.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Office of Foreign Affairs then laid on a double banquet of both
 meat and vegetarian food, for which the king invited Sanzang and his
 disciples to take their places in the Unicorn Hall.</P>
<P>&#8220;May I ask your title, holy monk?&#8221; he said to Sanzang, who replied,
 his hands together, &#8220;My lay surname is Chen, and my Buddhist name
 Xuanzang. My emperor granted me the surname Tang and the title
 Sanzang.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What are your disciple's titles?&#8221; the king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;They do not have titles,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;The senior one is called
 Sun Wukong, the second one Zhu Wuneng, and the third Sha Wujing. These
 were the names the Bodhisattva Guanyin of the Southern Sea gave them.
 When they became my disciples I called Wukong Sun the Novice, Wuneng
 Bajie and Wujing Friar Sand.&#8221;</P>
<P>The king then asked Sanzang to take the place of honour while Monkey
 sat at his left and Pig and Friar Sand at his right. Their banquet was
 all vegetarian: fruit, vegetables, tea and rice. In front of them was a
 table of meat dishes at which sat the king, and below him were a
 hundred or more tables set with meat dishes for all the civil and
 military officials. The officials all thanked the king for his
 kindness, and the disciples sat down with the permission of their
 master. When all were seated the king raised his goblet, and though
 Sanzang would not drink his three disciples all drank to the success of
 the banquet. Woodwinds and strings then began to sound as the court
 musicians performed.</P>
<P>Just watch Pig as he eats for all he is worth, gobbling his food down
 whole like a tiger or a wolf and emptying the table. Soon more soup and
 food was brought, only to disappear in the same way. Every time
 servants brought more wine he drained the cup, never refusing. The
 feast went on till after midday before it broke up.</P>
<P>When Sanzang expressed his thanks for the sumptuous banquet the king
 wanted to keep him longer. &#8220;It was just a gesture to thank you holy
 monks for catching the demons.&#8221; He then ordered the Office of Foreign
 Affairs to move the banquet to the Jianzhang Palace so that he could
 discuss with the holy monks how the ringleaders were to be captured and
 the treasure brought back to the pagoda.</P>
<P>&#8220;If we are to capture the thieves and recover the treasure,&#8221; Sanzang
 said, &#8220;another banquet won't be needed. We shall take our leave of Your
 Majesty now and set off to catch the demons.&#8221;</P>
<P>But the king insisted on taking them to the Jianzhang Palace for
 another banquet. &#8220;Which of you holy monks will lead the force that is
 to capture the monsters?&#8221; he asked, raising his goblet.</P>
<P>&#8220;Send my senior disciple Sun Wukong,&#8221; Sanzang replied. The Great Sage
 raised his clasped hands and bowed in acknowledgement.</P>
<P>&#8220;If the venerable Sun is going how big a force of cavalry and foot
 will he need,&#8221; the king asked, &#8220;and when will he be setting out?&#8221;</P>
<P>At this Pig could not restrain himself from shouting, &#8220;We won't need
 any soldiers, and we don't care when we go. With a good meal and a few
 drinks inside us he and I can go and catch them right now, just by
 laying our hands on them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Bajie,&#8221; said Sanzang with delight, &#8220;you're getting very keen.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well then,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Friar Sand, you guard the master
 while we two go.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Even if you two venerable elders don't need troops,&#8221; the king said,
 &#8220;surely you need weapons.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We don't need your weapons,&#8221; laughed Pig. &#8220;We carry our own.&#8221; On
 hearing this the king fetched two huge goblets and drank a toast to
 them on their journey.</P>
<P>&#8220;We won't have any more to drink,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;But we'd like the
 royal guards to bring those little demons to us. We need them as
 guides.&#8221; The king gave the order and they were brought out at once.
 Then Monkey and Pig, each firmly grasping a demon, rode the wind and
 used carrying magic to take them off to the Southeast. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Only when king and court saw the magical clouds</P>
<P>Did they realize that the four of them were truly holy monks.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know how the capture went and what they found, listen to
 the explanation in the next installment.</P>
<B><I>
<P></P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="1_0_64">Chapter 63</A></H3>
</I>
<P>Two Monks Wipe out the Demons in the Dragon Palace</P>
<P>The Sages Destroy Evil and Recover the Treasure</P>
</B>
<P>The story tells how the king of Jisai and his officials high and low
 watched as the Great Sage Monkey and Pig disappeared by wind and cloud,
 carrying the two demons with them. Then all of them bowed in homage to
 heaven, saying, &#8220;Their fame is well founded. Only today can we really
 believe that such immortals and living Buddhas exist.&#8221; As Monkey and
 Pig vanished into the distance the king bowed again to thank Sanzang
 and Friar Sand.</P>
<P>&#8220;Our mortal eyes were only able to see that your illustrious
 disciples had the power to capture thieving devils. We never realized
 that you were superior immortals with the power to ride on winds and
 clouds.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I do not have any dharma powers,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;On my journey I
 have depended very much on my three disciples.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I tell you the truth, Your Majesty,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;My senior
 fellow-disciple is the Great Sage Equaling Heaven who has been
 converted. He once made havoc in Heaven, and none of the hundred
 thousand heavenly troops was a match for his gold-banded cudgel. He had
 the Supreme Lord Lao Zi and the Jade Emperor both scared. My next
 senior fellow-disciple is Marshal Tian Peng, now a faithful Buddhist.
 He once commanded 80,000 sailors on the River of Heaven. I'm the only
 one of us with no magic powers: I was the Curtain-lifting General
 before I took my vows. We're useless at everything except capturing
 demons and monsters, arresting thieves and runaways, subduing tigers
 and dragons, and kicking the sky into a well. And we know a thing or
 two about stirring up the sea and turning rivers upside-down. Oh yes,
 and then there's riding clouds and mists, summoning wind and rain,
 moving the stars around in the sky, carrying mountains, and chasing the
 moon: but those are just extras.&#8221; All this made the king treat them
 with very great respect Indeed:</P>
<P>Inviting Sanzang to take the place of honour, he kept addressing him
 as &#8220;Buddha&#8221; and referring to Friar Sand and the others as bodhisattvas.
 All the civil and military officials were delighted, and the citizens
 of the country kowtowed to them.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story switches to the Great Sage Monkey and Pig riding their
 storm wind to the Green Wave Pool on the Ragged Rock Mountain, where
 they stopped their clouds.</P>
<P>Blowing a magic breath on his gold-banded cudgel Wukong told it to
 change and turned it into a monk's knife with which he cut an ear off
 the snakehead and the lower lip of the catfish, then threw the two
 demons into the water with a shout of, &#8220;Tell the Infinitely Sage Dragon
 King that Lord Sun, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven, is here. If he
 wants me to spare the lives of him and his family he'd better hand over
 the treasure from the pagoda of the Golden Light Monastery in Jisai at
 once. If there's even the hint of a 'no' from him I'll give this pool
 such a stirring that there'll be no water left in it and then
 exterminate his whole family.&#8221;</P>
<P>Having been given this order the two little devils fled for their
 lives in great pain, jumping into the water, chains, ropes and all, to
 the alarm of the various turtle, alligator, shrimp, crab and fish
 spirits, who crowded round them to ask, &#8220;Why are you roped and
 chained?&#8221;</P>
<P>Once of them shook his head and waved his tail with his hand over his
 ear; the other stamped and beat his chest as he covered his mouth.
 There was much shouting and commotion as they both went to the dragon
 king's palace to report, &#8220;Disaster, Your Majesty.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Infinitely Sage Dragon King was drinking with his son-in-law
 Prince Ninehead when the two of them arrived. &#8220;What disaster?&#8221; the
 dragon king asked, putting down his cup.</P>
<P>&#8220;We were on sentry duty last night,&#8221; they reported, &#8220;when the Tang
 Priest and Sun the Novice captured us as they were sweeping the pagoda.
 We were chained up and taken to see the king this morning. Then Sun the
 Novice and Pig dragged us here. One of us had an ear cut off and the
 other a lip. Then they threw us into the water to come to ask for the
 treasure from the top of the pagoda.&#8221; They then told the whole story in
 great detail. The news about Sun the Novice, the Great Sage Equaling
 Heaven, gave the ancient dragon such a fright that his souls left his
 body and were scattered beyond the sky.</P>
<P>&#8220;Son-in-law,&#8221; he said to the prince, shivering and shaking, &#8220;anyone
 else would have been easy enough to deal with; but if it's him it's
 terrible.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Relax, father-in-law,&#8221; the prince replied. &#8220;I've been studying the
 martial arts since childhood and made friends with quite a few of the
 world's heroes. He's nothing to be scared of. After three rounds with
 me I guarantee the wretch will surrender with his head hanging so low
 he won't even dare look you in the face.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid demon jumped to his feet, put on his armor, took the
 weapon he used, a crescent-bladed halberd, walked out of the palace,
 parted the waters, and when he reached the surface called out, &#8220;What's
 all this about a 'Great Sage Equaling Heaven'? Come and give yourself
 up at once.&#8221; Standing on the bank, Pig and Monkey saw how the evil
 spirit was dressed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A silver helmet on his head,</P>
<P>Outshone the whitest snow;</P>
<P>The suit of armor that he wore</P>
<P>Was higher than autumn frost.</P>
<P>Over it was a battle-robe of brocade,</P>
<P>With dragons, cloud-patterns and pearls;</P>
<P>The rhinoceros-patterned belt at his waist</P>
<P>Was like a python wrapped in gold.</P>
<P>He held a crescent halberd</P>
<P>That flew and flashed like lightning;</P>
<P>The pigskin boots on his feet</P>
<P>Moved as smoothly as water or waves.</P>
<P>From a distance he seemed to have only one face and head,</P>
<P>But seen from close to there were faces all around him:</P>
<P>Eyes in front and eyes behind</P>
<P>That could see in all directions;</P>
<P>Mouths to the left and mouths to the right,</P>
<P>Nine of them, all talking.</P>
<P>One shout from him would make the sky shake</P>
<P>Like the call of the crane resounding through the stars.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As nobody answered he shouted again, &#8220;Which of you is the Great Sage
 Equaling Heaven?&#8221;</P>
<P>Touching the golden band round his head and fingering his iron
 cudgel, Monkey replied, &#8220;I am.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where do you live?&#8221; the demon asked. &#8220;Where are you from? What
 brought you to Jisai to look after the king's pagoda? Why did you have
 the effrontery to capture and mutilate two of our officers? And why are
 you here demanding battle now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Thieving devil,&#8221; replied Monkey abusively, &#8220;it's obvious you don't
 know who I am. Come a little closer and I'll tell you:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>My people come from the Mount of Flowers and Fruit,</P>
<P>From the Water Curtain Cave in the middle of the sea.</P>
<P>Since childhood I have made my body indestructible;</P>
<P>The Jade Emperor created me Heaven-equaling Sage.</P>
<P>When I made havoc in the Dipper and Bull Palace</P>
<P>All the gods of Heaven were not enough to beat me.</P>
<P>The Buddha then was asked to use his great and subtle powers;</P>
<P>His infinite wisdom went beyond the mortal world.</P>
<P>When I matched my powers with his and made my somersaults</P>
<P>His hand turned to a mountain and crushed me underneath.</P>
<P>There I was kept for full five hundred years,</P>
<P>And only was released when converted by Guanyin</P>
<P>Because Sanzang was going to the Western Heaven</P>
<P>To seek the Buddha's words at distant Vulture Peak.</P>
<P>She freed me then to escort the holy monk,</P>
<P>To clear up all the monsters and purify my conduct.</P>
<P>Our journey led to Jisai in the regions of the West</P>
<P>Where there monkish generations have been cruelly mistreated.</P>
<P>When in our mercy we asked them what had happened</P>
<P>We learned that the pagoda no longer shone with light.</P>
<P>My master swept it clean to find out the reason.</P>
<P>In the deep silence of the night's third watch,</P>
<P>We captured the demons and extracted their confessions:</P>
<P>They said you were the thief who had stolen the great treasure,</P>
<P>Conspiring to be a robber with the ancient dragon king</P>
<P>And the princess who is also known as Infinitely Sage.</P>
<P>Your rain of blood washed out the pagoda's magic light</P>
<P>And you brought the treasure back to use it here yourselves.</P>
<P>The confession that they made was true in every detail,</P>
<P>And we have come here now on His Majesty's own orders.</P>
<P>That is why we looked for you and challenge you to battle:</P>
<P>Never will you need to ask my name again.</P>
<P>Give the king back his treasure this instant</P>
<P>If you want to save the lives of all members of your family.</P>
<P>Should you in your folly try to make resistance</P>
<P>Your pool will be dried out and your palace smashed to ruins.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the prince heard all this he replied with a touch of a mocking
 smile, &#8220;If you're monks going to fetch the scriptures you shouldn't be
 trumping up charges where it's none of your business. So what if I
 stole their treasure? You're going to fetch your Buddhist scriptures
 and it's nothing to do with you. Why are you here looking for a fight?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Thieving devil,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you've got no idea of right and
 wrong. The king's done us no favours. We don't drink his kingdom's
 waters or eat its grain. We were under no obligation to do thing for
 him. But you have stolen his treasure, contaminated his pagoda, and
 brought years of misery to the monks in the Golden Light Monastery.
 They are our fellow believers, so of course we'll make an effort for
 them and right their wrong.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So it looks as though you want a fight,&#8221; said the prince. &#8220;As the
 saying goes, the warrior avoids unnecessary combat; but once I start
 there'll be no mercy, you'll be dead in next to no time, and that will
 be the end of going to fetch the scriptures.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Bloody thieving devil,&#8221; Monkey cursed back, &#8220;you must think you're
 quite a fighter, talking big like that. Come here and take this!&#8221; The
 prince was not flustered in the least as he blocked the cudgel with his
 crescent-bladed halberd. A fine battle ensued on the Ragged Rock
 Mountain.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Because the monster stole the treasure the pagoda was dark;</P>
<P>Monkey went to catch the demons for the sake of the king;</P>
<P>The little devils fled for their lives back into the water;</P>
<P>The ancient dragon took counsel in his terror.</P>
<P>Prince Ninehead showed his might</P>
<P>As he went out in armor to exercise his powers.</P>
<P>The angry Great Sage Equaling Heaven</P>
<P>Raised his gold-banded cudgel that was very hard Indeed:</P>
<P>In the monster's mine heads were eighteen eyes</P>
<P>Shining bright as they looked in all directions.</P>
<P>Monkey's iron arms were immensely strong</P>
<P>And auspicious lights glowed all around.</P>
<P>The halberd was like a new moon's crescent,</P>
<P>The cudgel like flying frost.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why don't you give up trying to right wrongs?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You were wrong to steal the pagoda's treasure.</P>
<P>Behave yourself, damned devil,</P>
<P>And give me back the treasure if you want to live.&#8221;</P>
<P>Cudgel and halberd fought for mastery:</P>
<P>Neither emerged as victor in the fight.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The two of them fought hard for over thirty rounds without either of
 them emerging as winner. Pig, who was standing on the mountain admiring
 the sweetness and beauty of their fight, raised his rake and brought
 down on the evil spirit from behind, Now the monster's nine heads all
 had eyes in them, and he could see Pig coming behind him very clearly,
 so he now used the butt-end of his halberd to block the rake while
 holding off the cudgel with the blade. He resisted for another six or
 seven rounds until he could hold out no longer against the weapons that
 were swinging at him from before and behind, when he rolled away and
 leapt up into the sky in his true form as a nine-headed bird. He looked
 thoroughly repulsive: the sight of him was enough to kill one with
 horror:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>His body all covered in feathers and down,</P>
<P>His girth was some twelve feet measured around,</P>
<P>And he was as long as an old crocodile.</P>
<P>His two feet were as sharp as book-shaped blades,</P>
<P>And his nine heads were all set in a circle.</P>
<P>When he opened his wings he could fly superbly:</P>
<P>Not even the roc could match his great strength.</P>
<P>His voice could resound to the edge of the sky,</P>
<P>With an echo even louder than the call of the crane.</P>
<P>Bright flashed golden light from his many pairs of eyes;</P>
<P>His pride far outstripped that of ordinary birds.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The sight alarmed Pig, who said, &#8220;Brother, I've never seen anything
 as ugly in all my days. What sort of blood could that monstrous bird
 have been born of?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's nothing like him,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;nothing. I'm going up to
 kill him.&#8221; The splendid Great Sage then leapt up on his cloud into
 mid-air, where he struck at the monster's head with his cudgel. The
 monster now displayed the power of his body as he swooped down, his
 wings outspread, then turned with a roaring noise to come low over the
 mountain and shoot out from his waist another head with a mouth open
 wide like a bowl of blood. His beak gripped Pig's bristles at the first
 attempt, then he dragged Pig to the pool and pulled him in.</P>
<P>Once back outside the dragon palace he turned himself back into what
 he had been before, threw Pig to the ground, and said, &#8220;Where are you,
 little ones?&#8221;</P>
<P>Thereupon the mackerel, trout, carp, mandarin fish, hard and
 soft-shelled tortoises, and alligators, who were all armored demons,
 rushed forward with a shout of, &#8220;Here!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Take this monk and tie him up for me,&#8221; said the prince. &#8220;This will
 be revenge for our patrolling sentries.&#8221; Shouting and pushing, the
 spirits carried Pig inside, to the delight of the ancient dragon king,
 who came out to meet the prince with the words, &#8220;Congratulations,
 son-in-law. How did you catch him?&#8221; The prince then told him the whole
 story, after which the ancient dragon ordered a celebratory banquet,
 which we need not describe.</P>
<P>Instead the story tells how Monkey thought in terror after the evil
 spirit had captured Pig, &#8220;This monster is terrible. But if I go back to
 the court to see the master the king will probably laugh at me. But if
 I challenge him to battle again how will I deal with him single-handed?
 Besides, I'm not used to coping in water. I'll just have to turn myself
 into something to get inside and see what the evil spirit has done with
 Pig. If it's possible I'll sneak him out of there to help me.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage then made magic with his fingers, shook
 himself, turned into a crab again, and plunged into the water till he
 was outside the archway again. He knew the way from when he had come
 here the previous time and stolen the Bull King's water-averting
 golden-eyed beast. When he reached the gateway to the palace he walked
 in sideways to see the ancient dragon king, the nine-headed monster and
 their whole family drinking together to celebrate. Not daring to go too
 close. Monkey crawled under the eaves of the Eastern verandah, where
 several shrimp and crab spirits were fooling around and amusing
 themselves. He listened to them for a while then said, imitating their
 way of talking, &#8220;Is the long-snouted monk the prince brought here dead
 or alive?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He's alive,&#8221; the spirits all replied, &#8220;and tied up. Can't you see
 him groaning under the Western verandah over there?&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey then crawled quietly over to the Western verandah, where he
 did indeed find Pig tied to a column and groaning. &#8220;Can you recognize
 me, Pig?&#8221; he asked. Pig knew who it was from Monkey's voice.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is terrible, brother,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The monster got me.&#8221; Looking
 all around to make sure there was nobody there Monkey cut through the
 ropes with his claws and told Pig to go. &#8220;What am I to do, brother?&#8221;
 Pig said. &#8220;He's got my rake.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do you know where he put it?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I think he must have taken it into the main hall of the palace,&#8221; Pig
 replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wait for me under the arch,&#8221; said Monkey, and Pig slipped quietly
 out to save his skin. Monkey climbed up on the roof of the main hall,
 from where he saw the intense glow of Pig's rake down on the left, made
 himself invisible, and sneaked it out of the palace. Once under the
 archway he called, &#8220;Pig, take your weapon.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You go on ahead, brother,&#8221; said Pig, now reunited with his rake.
 &#8220;I'm going to attack that palace. If I win I'll capture the whole
 family of them, and if I lose you'll be waiting by the bank to rescue
 me.&#8221; Monkey, who was delighted at the suggestion, urged him to be
 careful. &#8220;I'm not scared of him,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;I know a thing or two
 when it comes to water.&#8221; Monkey then left him and came up through the
 water.</P>
<P>Pig meanwhile tightened the belt round his black tunic, grasped his
 rake with both hands, and charged in with a great war-cry that sent all
 the members of the watery tribe rushing into the palace and shouting,
 &#8220;Disaster! The long-snouted monk has broken free from his bonds and is
 charging back in.&#8221; The ancient dragon king, the nine-headed monster and
 the rest of the family were caught off their guard, and all they could
 do was jump to their feet and flee for cover. The idiot, not fearing
 for his life, charged into the hall, laying about him with his rake as
 he went. He smashed everything: doors, tables, chairs, wine-cups and
 all else too. There is a poem to prove it that goes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the mother of wood was taken by the water monster</P>
<P>The mind-ape did not flinch from a difficult rescue.</P>
<P>One used his secret skills to open the locks;</P>
<P>The other one showed his might in hatred and wrath.</P>
<P>The prince fled, taking his princess to safety;</P>
<P>Not a sound was heard from the shivering dragon.</P>
<P>The palace's crimson windows and doors were all smashed;</P>
<P>The dragon's descendants were all scared out of their wits.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Pig smashed the tortoise-shell screens to powder and the coral trees
 to fragments.</P>
<P>When the nine-headed monster had hidden his princess safely inside he
 grabbed his crescent-bladed halberd and went for Pig in the front of
 the living quarters of the palace, shouting, &#8220;Bloody idiot! Swine! How
 dare you terrorize my family?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Thieving devil,&#8221; retorted Pig. &#8220;How dared you capture me? This was
 none of my fight till you brought me into it. Give the treasure back at
 once for me to take back to the king and that'll be that. Otherwise
 every last member of your family will be killed.&#8221; The demon was in no
 mood for kindness: he ground his teeth and started fighting Pig. Only
 then did the ancient dragon calm down enough to lead his dragon sons
 and grandsons to surround and attack Pig with their spears and swords.
 Seeing that things were going badly for him Pig feinted and fled,
 followed by the ancient dragon and his host. A moment later he shot up
 through the water and they all surfaced at the top of the pool.</P>
<P>Monkey, who had been waiting on the bank, suddenly saw them coming
 out of the water after Pig, so he put one foot on a cloud and brought
 out his iron cudgel with a shout of, &#8220;Stay where you are.&#8221; His first
 blow smashed the ancient dragon king to pulp. It was a terrible sight:
 his corpse and the scales that had come off it floated on the surface
 of the pool, which turned red with his gore. His sons and grandsons all
 fled for their lives in terror, while Prince Ninehead took the body
 back to the underwater palace.</P>
<P>Brother Monkey and Pig did not pursue them but went back to the bank
 to discuss what had happened. &#8220;I've knocked a bit of the stuffing out
 of him,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;I went charging in with my rake and smashed
 everything to smithereens. They were all scared witless. I was just
 fighting the prince when the ancient dragon king went for me. Thanks
 for killing him. Now those bastards have gone back they'll be too busy
 with mourning and the funeral to come out again. Besides it's getting
 late now. What are we going to do?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Never mind about it being late,&#8221; replied Monkey. &#8220;This is our
 chance. Get back down there and attack again. You must get the treasure
 so that we can go back to court.&#8221; The idiot was feeling lazy so he made
 all sorts of excuses to get out of going down again, but Monkey
 insisted: &#8220;Don't worry so, brother. Just draw him out again as you did
 just now and I'll kill him.&#8221;</P>
<P>As the two of them were talking they heard the roar of a mighty wind
 as dark and gloomy clouds came from the East, heading South. When
 Monkey took a closer look he saw that it was the Illustrious Sage
 Erlang with the Six Brothers of Plum Hill. They had falcons and hounds
 and were carrying foxes, hares, water-deer and deer that they had
 killed. All of them had bows and crossbows at their waists and were
 carrying sharp swords as they arrived on their wind and clouds.</P>
<P>&#8220;Pig,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;here come my seven-sage-sworn brothers. Let's
 stop them and ask them to help us in this fight. This will really stack
 the odds in our favour.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If they're your sworn brothers they owe you that,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;The only trouble is that the eldest of them, the Illustrious Sage,
 once made me surrender, so I feel too embarrassed to face him,&#8221; said
 Monkey. &#8220;I'd like you to go up, stop the clouds and say, 'Wait a moment
 please, True Lord. The Great Sage Equaling Heaven would like to pay his
 respects.' I'm sure he'll stop then. I can only face him after he's
 landed.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot then shot up on his cloud to the top of the mountain to
 stop Erlang. &#8220;True Lord,&#8221; he shouted at the top of his voice, &#8220;could
 you slow down for a moment? The Great Sage Equaling Heaven would like
 to see you.&#8221; On hearing this Lord Erlang ordered the six brothers to
 stop and exchanged polite salutations with Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where is the Great Sage Equaling Heaven?&#8221; he asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Awaiting your summons at the foot of the mountain,&#8221; Pig replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brothers,&#8221; said Erlang, &#8220;go and ask him up at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>The six brothers Kang, Zhang, Yao, Li, Guo and Zhi all came out of
 their camps and said, &#8220;Great Sage, our eldest brother has sent us with
 an invitation for you.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey went forward, paid his respects to them, then accompanied them
 to the top of the mountain, where Lord Erlang received him, took him by
 the hand and returned his courtesies.</P>
<P>&#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; he said, &#8220;allow me to congratulate you on being rescued
 from your terrible sufferings and being converted to the Buddhist
 faith. Soon you will have succeeded and will be sitting on your lotus
 throne.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I don't deserve your congratulations,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;I am under
 enormous obligations that I've hardly begun to repay. I've been rescued
 and am heading West, but it's too soon to say whether we'll succeed. As
 we agreed to rescue some monks from disaster in the kingdom of Jisai we
 are here to capture a demon and demand the return of a treasure. Seeing
 that you are passing this way, eldest brother, I wonder if I could
 persuade you to stay and help us. May I ask where you have come from
 and whether you'd be willing to help?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm just on my way home from a hunting trip with my brothers because
 I had nothing to do,&#8221; Erlang replied. &#8220;I'm grateful to you, Great Sage,
 for asking me to stay out of consideration for our old friendship. Of
 course I'll help subdue a demon if that is what you wish. What kind of
 demons are there here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Have you forgotten?&#8221; the six brothers asked. &#8220;This is the Ragged
 Rock Mountain, and below it is the Green Wave Pool, the Infinitely Sage
 Dragon's palace.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The Infinitely Sage Ancient Dragon is no trouble-maker,&#8221; said Erlang
 with astonishment. &#8220;How could he have robbed the pagoda?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Recently he's had a son-in-law living with him,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;a
 nine-headed monster turned spirit. He plotted it all with his
 father-in-law. They made it rain blood on Jisai then stole the sacred
 Buddha relic from the top of the pagoda in the Golden Light Monastery.
 The king in his ignorance had the monks arrested and tortured. I
 captured two of their underlings in the pagoda who'd been sent out on
 patrol when my master in his mercy swept it out one night, and they
 confessed everything in the palace this morning. When the king asked
 our master to capture these monsters we two were sent here. In the
 first fight the nine-headed monster grew another head that shot out
 from his waist and carried Pig off. I had to transform myself to go
 into the water and rescue him. Then there was another big fight in
 which I killed the ancient dragon king. The swine have recovered the
 body and are now in mourning. We two were just discussing how to draw
 them into battle again when we saw you arriving. That's why I have had
 the effrontery to ask to see you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As you've killed the ancient dragon king you'll have to hit them so
 hard that the monster won't know what to do,&#8221; Erlang replied. &#8220;Then you
 can clean up the whole den of them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;but it's late now.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's a soldier's saying that you should never put off an attack,&#8221;
 Erlang replied. &#8220;It doesn't matter that it's late.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be so impatient brother,&#8221; said Kang, Yao, Quo and Zhi. &#8220;The
 demon's family is here, so we don't think he'll run away. Brother
 Monkey is a distinguished guest, and Iron-haired Pig has been converted
 too. We have wine and good food in our camp. Why don't we tell the
 little ones to light the stove and set out a banquet here? It would be
 a way of congratulating them and a chance to talk at the same time.
 After a good night's feasting there'll be plenty of time for the battle
 tomorrow.&#8221;</P>
<P>Erlang was very pleased with the suggestion: &#8220;An excellent idea,
 brothers.&#8221; The underlings were then ordered to set out the banquet.</P>
<P>&#8220;We couldn't possibly refuse you gentlemen's generous invitation,&#8221;
 Monkey replied. &#8220;But now we're monks we may only eat vegetarian food.
 We can't eat meat.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We have vegetarian food in plenty,&#8221; Erlang replied, &#8220;and monastic
 wine too.&#8221; All the brothers then drank and talked of the old days under
 the light of the moon and the stars; when the sky was their canopy and
 the earth their mats.</P>
<P>How true it is that the night is long in loneliness and short in
 pleasure. Soon the East started to become light and Pig, feeling very
 cheerful and energetic after a few drinks, said, &#8220;It's getting light.
 I'm going down to challenge them to battle.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Be careful, Marshal,&#8221; said Erlang. &#8220;Just lure him out for my
 brothers and me to deal with.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; grinned Pig, &#8220;I understand.&#8221; Watch as he tucks up his
 clothes, grabs his rake, makes water-dividing magic, jumps in, goes
 straight to the archway, and charges into the palace with a great
 war-cry.</P>
<P>The dragon sons were wearing the hempen clothes of mourning as they
 watched and wept over the dragon's body while the dragon grandsons and
 the prince were preparing the coffin at the back. Then in came Pig,
 roaring abuse at them. He landed a terrible blow from his rake that
 made nine holes in a dragon son's head. The dragon's widow fled inside
 in terror with the rest of them.</P>
<P>&#8220;The long-snouted monk's killed my son now,&#8221; she howled, and on
 hearing this the prince led the dragon grandsons out to fight, wielding
 his crescent-bladed halberd. Pig raised his rake to parry the halberd
 and fought a fighting retreat till he jumped out of the water. The
 Great Sage Equaling Heaven and the seven sworn brothers all leapt into
 the fray, thrusting furiously with sword and spear. One of the dragon
 grandsons was chopped up into mincemeat.</P>
<P>Seeing that things were going badly the prince rolled in front of the
 mountain, turned back into himself, spread his wings, and started
 circling around. Erlang then took his golden bow, fixed a silver pellet
 to it pulled it to its full extent, and fired it in the air. The
 monster pulled in its wings and swooped down to bite Erlang with the
 head that shot out from its waist. Erlang's slim dog leapt up, barked,
 and bit off the head, which dripped blood. The monster fled for his
 life in great pain, heading straight back for the Northern Sea. Pig
 wanted to go after him but Monkey stopped him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't chase him,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Never corner a defeated enemy. Now the
 dog's bitten that head off I'm sure he'll be more dead than alive. I'm
 going to turn myself into his double. I want you to part the waters and
 chase me in there to find the princess and trick the treasure out of
 her.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't have to chase him if you don't want to,&#8221; said Erlang and
 his six sages, &#8220;but by letting a creature like that stay alive you are
 only creating trouble for the future.&#8221; The nine-headed gory monsters
 that are still found today are its descendants.</P>
<P>Pig did as he was told and parted a way through the waters for
 Monkey, looking just like the monster, to flee with himself in noisy
 pursuit. They soon reached the dragon palace, where Princess Infinitely
 Sage asked, &#8220;Why are you in such a state, prince?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Pig beat me,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and chased me in here. I'm no match
 for him. Hide the treasures somewhere safe.&#8221;</P>
<P>Not realizing in her alarm that he was an impostor, she fetched a
 golden casket from the rear palace that she gave to Monkey with the
 words: &#8220;This is the Buddha relic.&#8221; Then she fetched a white jade box
 that she gave to Monkey saying, &#8220;This is the nine-lobed magic fungus.
 Hide the treasures away where they'll be safe while I fight two or
 three rounds with him to cover you. When the treasures are safe come
 and join in the fight.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey then tucked the treasures into his clothes, rubbed his face,
 and turned back into himself. &#8220;Have a good look, princess,&#8221; he said.
 &#8220;Am I really your husband?&#8221; As the princess made a desperate grab for
 the boxes Pig ran up and knocked her to the floor with a blow on the
 shoulder from his rake.</P>
<P>The ancient dragon's widow was fleeing as Pig grabbed her and raised
 his rake to smash her. &#8220;Stop!&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Don't kill her! Keep her
 alive for when we go back to announce our victory at court.&#8221; Pig then
 lifted her up out of the water while Monkey followed him to the bank
 with the two boxes.</P>
<P>&#8220;Thanks to your power and prestige, elder brother, we have recovered
 the treasures and wiped out the thieving devils,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;That was no credit of ours,&#8221; said Erlang. &#8220;In the first place the
 king's good fortune equaled heaven, and in the second you worthy
 brothers showed your boundless powers.&#8221;</P>
<P>The brothers then all said, &#8220;As you have now succeeded, Brother
 Monkey, we shall take our leave of you.&#8221; Monkey expressed his thanks
 profusely and tried to persuade them to go to see the king. None of
 them agreed, and they led their forces back to Guankou.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey carried the boxes and Pig dragged the dragon wife back to the
 city in next to no time, travelling by cloud and mist. The liberated
 monks of the Golden Light Monastery were waiting for them outside the
 city, and when they saw the two of them suddenly alight from the
 clouds, they went up and kowtowed, ushering them into the city. The
 king was then sitting in the main hall of the palace talking with the
 Tang Priest.</P>
<P>A monk came ahead and took his courage in his hands to go in through
 the palace gates and report, &#8220;Your Majesty, Lords Monkey and Pig are
 back with one of the thieves and the treasures.&#8221; The moment he heard
 this news the king hurried down from the throne hall to welcome them
 with the Tang Priest and Friar Sand. He was full of expressions of
 gratitude for their amazing achievement and he ordered a thanksgiving
 banquet.</P>
<P>&#8220;We don't need any drinks now,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;We can only feast when
 my disciples have returned the treasure to the pagoda.&#8221; He then asked
 Monkey why it was that they were only back then as they had left the
 day before, Monkey then told him all about the battle with the prince,
 the death of the dragon king, meeting the True Lord Erlang, the defeat
 of the evil monsters and how he had got the treasures through trickery
 and transformation. Sanzang, the king and all the civil and military
 officials were delighted.</P>
<P>&#8220;Can the dragon wife talk in human speech?&#8221; the king then asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Of course she knows human speech,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;She was married to
 a dragon and had a lot of dragon sons and grandsons.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said the king, &#8220;she'd better tell us the whole story
 of their crimes.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I don't know anything about the theft of the Buddha relic,&#8221; she
 said. &#8220;That was all done by that husband of mine, the dragon who's a
 ghost now, and our son-in-law the nine-headed monster. They knew that
 the light from your pagoda came from the Buddha relic that they stole
 under cover of the blood rain.&#8221;</P>
<P>When asked how the magic fungus was stolen she answered, &#8220;My daughter
 the Infinitely Sage Princess sneaked into the Daluo Heaven and stole
 the Queen Mother's nine-lobed magic fungus from in front of the Hall of
 Miraculous Mist. The magic vapors of the fungus have nourished the
 relic, which will now be indestructible and shine for tens of thousands
 of years. Even if it's buried or put in a field it will give out
 thousands of beams of coloured light and auspicious vapors the moment
 it's brushed. You have now taken it back and killed my husband, all my
 sons, my son-in-law and my daughter. Please spare my life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There'll be no mercy for you,&#8221; Pig replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no such thing as a family that's all criminal,&#8221; said Monkey.
 &#8220;I'll spare your life on one condition: you look after the pagoda for
 me for ever.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;A poor life is better than a good death,&#8221; the dragon wife replied.
 &#8220;Spare my life and I'll do whatever you want.&#8221; Monkey sent for an iron
 chain that was fetched by one of the aides.</P>
<P>He put it through the dragon wife's collarbone and said to Friar
 Sand, &#8220;Please ask the king to come and watch the treasures being put
 back in the pagoda.&#8221;</P>
<P>The king then had his carriage prepared and left the court
 hand-in-hand with Sanzang, accompanied by the civil and military
 officials. He went to the Golden Light Monastery and climbed the
 pagoda, where the relic was placed in a precious vase on the thirteenth
 floor just under the roof. The dragon wife was chained to the central
 column of the pagoda. Spells were then said to summon the local deities
 and city gods of the capital and the Guardians of the monastery, who
 were ordered to bring the dragon wife food and drink once every three
 days to keep her alive. If she tried any tricks they were to execute
 her on the spot. The gods all secretly accepted their orders. Brother
 Monkey used the magic fungus to sweep out the thirteen stories of the
 pagoda one by one, then put it in the vase to look after the relic.
 Then and only then did the pagoda shine anew with coloured light and an
 auspicious glow that could be seen from all directions and admired by
 the countries all around.</P>
<P>When they came down out of the pagoda the king thanked them with the
 words, &#8220;If you, venerable Buddha, and your three Bodhisattvas had not
 come here this matter would never have been cleared up.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;Golden Light is not a good name as it's
 not something permanent. Gold can melt and light is only shining vapor.
 As we monks have gone to some trouble on your behalf we would like to
 change the name to Subdued Dragon Monastery. This will ensure that you
 live for ever.&#8221; The king ordered that the name be changed and a new
 board hung up that read.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>NATION-PROTECTING</P>
<P>SUBDUED DRAGON MONASTERY</P>
<P>FOUNDED BY ROYAL COMMAND</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He then commanded that a banquet be laid on and sent for painters to
 paint portraits of the four of them. Their names were recorded in the
 Tower of Five Phoenixes. The king then had his carriage brought out to
 see the Tang Priest and his disciples on their way. He tried to give
 them gold and jewels, but they firmly refused to accept anything.
 Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Evil had been wiped out;</P>
<P>Now calmness once more reigned.</P>
<P>Sunshine had been brought back,</P>
<P>The pagoda's light regained.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The story has been told how the king of Jisai thanked Tang Sanzang
 and his three disciples for capturing the demons and pressed on them
 gold and jade, none of which they would accept. The king therefore told
 his aides to have made for each of them two suits of clothing like
 those they were wearing, two pairs of socks, two pairs of shoes and two
 belts. They were also provided with dry rations, and their passport was
 duly examined and returned. They were seen out of the city by a
 procession of carriages, the civil and military officials, the common
 people of the city and the monks of the Subdued Dragon Monastery. There
 was also loud music. After six or seven miles they took their leave of
 the king, to be accompanied for a further six or seven miles by
 everyone else. Then all the others turned back except the monks of the
 Subdued Dragon Monastery, who were still with them after twenty miles.
 Some of the monks wanted to accompany them to the Western Heaven and
 the others wanted to cultivate their conduct and wait on them.</P>
<P>Seeing that none of them was willing to turn back Monkey decided to
 use his powers. He pulled out thirty or forty of his hairs, blew on
 them with magic breath, shouted, &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned them into
 ferocious striped tigers that leapt roaring about on the path ahead.
 Only then were the monks scared into going back. The Great Sage then
 led the master as he whipped his horse forward and they were soon far
 away.</P>
<P>At this the monks began to weep aloud, shouting, &#8220;Kind and honorable
 sirs, fate must be against us since you won't take us with you.&#8221;</P>
<P>Let us tell not of the wailing monks but of how the master and his
 three disciples headed along the main path West for a while before
 Monkey took his hairs back. Once again the seasons were changing, and
 it was now the end of winter and the beginning of spring, neither hot
 nor cold. As they were making their way along without a care they saw a
 long ridge in front of them over which the road led. Sanzang reined in
 his horse to look. He saw that the ridge was overgrown with brambles
 and creepers. Although the line of the path could be made out there
 were brambles and thorns all over it. &#8220;How are we going to manage that
 path, disciples?&#8221; he asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;No problem,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;But, disciple, the path is covered with thorns. We could only manage
 it by crawling on our bellies like snakes or insects. Your backs will
 be bent with walking, and I'll never be able to ride the horse.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's nothing to worry about, Master,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;I'll clear
 the thorns away with my rake. It'll be just like gathering up kindling
 for the fire. Never mind about riding your horse&#8212;I promise we could
 even get up there in a carrying-chair.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You are very strong,&#8221; the Tang Priest replied, &#8220;but it is a long way
 and it will be hard. I don't know where you'll find the energy to do
 that distance: goodness only knows how far it is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no need to guess,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'll go and have a look.&#8221;
 When he jumped up into the air he saw it stretching away endlessly.
 Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Vast was its size;</P>
<P>It was covered in mist and rain.</P>
<P>Soft was the carpet of grass on the path;</P>
<P>The mountain was covered in brilliant green.</P>
<P>New leaves were sprouting in dense abundance,</P>
<P>Fragrant creepers climbed all around.</P>
<P>When seen from afar no end was in sight;</P>
<P>From close to it seemed a mass of verdant cloud,</P>
<P>Luxuriant, mysterious and green.</P>
<P>The winds soughed everywhere</P>
<P>As the ridge shone bright in the sunshine.</P>
<P>There was pine and cypress and bamboo,</P>
<P>Many a plum and willow, and mulberry too.</P>
<P>Climbing figs coiled round ancient trees,</P>
<P>While creepers entwined the weeping poplars,</P>
<P>All twisted together like a frame,</P>
<P>Woven together in a bed.</P>
<P>Here the flowers made living brocade;</P>
<P>Far spread the scent of boundless blossom.</P>
<P>Everyone's life has brambles and thorns.</P>
<P>But none are as tall as those in the West.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Having looked for a long time, Monkey brought his cloud down and
 said, &#8220;Master, it's a very long way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How far?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I can't see any end to it,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;There must be at least
 three hundred miles of it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's terrible,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be miserable, Master,&#8221; said Friar Sand with a laugh. &#8220;We know
 how to burn undergrowth. Set fire to it with a torch and all the thorns
 will be burned away. Then we'll be able to cross.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't talk nonsense,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;You can only clear the ground
 that way in November or later when the grass has withered and there are
 dead trees. The fire won't take otherwise. It'd never burn now, when
 everything's growing.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Even if it did burn it would be terrifying,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Then how are we to get across?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;You'll just have to depend on me,&#8221; said Pig with a grin.</P>
<P>The splendid idiot made a spell with his hands and said the words of
 it, leaned forward, and said, &#8220;Grow!&#8221; He grew two hundred feet tall,
 then waved the rake and shouted. &#8220;Change!&#8221; It became three hundred feet
 long. Then he strode forward and wielded the rake two-handed to clear
 the undergrowth from both sides of the path. &#8220;Come with me, Master,&#8221; he
 said. Sanzang was delighted to whip the horse along and follow close
 behind while Friar Sand carried the luggage and Monkey used his cudgel
 to help clear the way. They did not let their hands rest for a moment
 all day long, and they had covered over thirty miles when near
 nightfall they came to an empty stretch of ground where a stone tablet
 stood in the middle of the path.</P>
<P>On the tablet the words THORN RIDGE were written large, and under
 them two lines of smaller writing read, &#8220;Two hundred and fifty miles of
 rampant thorns; few travelers have ever taken this road.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Pig saw this he said with a laugh, &#8220;Let me add a couple more
 lines to that: 'Pig has always been good at removing thorns; he's
 cleared the roads right to the West.'&#8220; Sanzang then dismounted in a
 very good mood.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciples,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I've put you to a lot of trouble. Let's stop
 here for the night and carry on at first light tomorrow.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't stop now, Master,&#8221; said Pig with a smile. &#8220;It's a clear sky
 and we're in the mood. It's all right if we carry on all bloody night.&#8221;
 The venerable elder had to accept his suggestion.</P>
<P>While Pig was working so hard in the lead all four of them pressed
 ahead without stopping for the night and another day until it was
 evening once more. In front-of them the trees and undergrowth were
 densely tangled and the wind could be heard rustling in the bamboos and
 soughing in the pines. Luckily they came to another patch of empty land
 where there stood an old temple outside whose gates pine and cypress
 formed a solid green shade, while peach and plum trees rivaled each
 other in beauty. Sanzang then dismounted and went with his three
 disciples to examine it. This is what they saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Before the cliff an ancient shrine stood by a cold stream;</P>
<P>Desolation hung all around the hill.</P>
<P>White cranes in the thickets made the moon seem brighter;</P>
<P>The green moss on the steps had been there for years.</P>
<P>The rustle of green bamboo seemed like human speech;</P>
<P>The remaining calls of the birds seemed expressions of grief.</P>
<P>Dogs and hens never came, and few human souls;</P>
<P>Wild flowers and plants grew all over the wall.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;This place strikes me as very sinister,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Let's not
 stay here long.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're being overcautious, brother,&#8221; remarked Friar Sand. &#8220;As this
 is deserted and I don't think there are any monsters, wild beasts or
 fiends, there's nothing to be afraid of.&#8221; No sooner were the words out
 of his mouth than there was a gust of sinister wind and an old man
 emerged from the temple gateway. He wore a turban, a pale-coloured gown
 and grass sandals, and he held a crooked stick. He was accompanied by a
 devil servant with a blue face, terrible fangs, red whiskers and a red
 body who was carrying on his head a tray of cakes.</P>
<P>&#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; said the old man as they both knelt down, &#8220;I am the
 local god of Thorn Ridge. As I knew you were coming but had nothing
 better to offer you I have prepared this tray of steamed cakes for your
 master. Do all have some. As there are no other houses for hundreds of
 miles I hope you will accept a few to stave off the pangs of hunger.&#8221;</P>
<P>This was just what Pig wanted to hear: he went up and was just
 stretching out his hands to take a cake when Monkey, who had been
 taking a long, hard look at all this, shouted, &#8220;Stop! He's evil! Behave
 yourself!&#8221; He was now addressing the local god.</P>
<P>&#8220;You're no local god, trying to fool me like that. Take this!&#8221;</P>
<P>Seeing the ferocity of his attack, the local god turned round and
 transformed himself into a howling gust of negative wind that carried
 the venerable elder flying off through the air. Nobody knew where he
 had been taken. The Great Sage was desperate because he did not know
 where to look for the master, while Pig and Friar Sand stared at each
 other, pale with shock. Even the white horse was whinnying with fright.
 The three brother disciples and the horse were in utter confusion. They
 looked all around as far as they could see but without finding him.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We will not describe their search but tell how the old man and his
 devil servant carried Sanzang to a stone house that was wreathed in
 mist and gently set him down. Holding him by the hand and supporting
 him the old man said, &#8220;Don't be afraid, holy monk. We aren't bad
 people. I am the Eighteenth Lord of Thorn Ridge. I have asked you here
 on this cool, clear moonlit night to talk about poetry and pass the
 time in friendship.&#8221; Only then did Sanzang calm down. When he took a
 careful look around this is what he saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>From where the banks of cloud set out</P>
<P>Stood a pure house for immortals, a place</P>
<P>To purify the self and refine elixir,</P>
<P>To plant groves of bamboo and grow one's flowers.</P>
<P>Cranes often came to the emerald cliff,</P>
<P>And frogs called in the pool's blue waters.</P>
<P>This was a match for the cinnabar furnace on Mount Tiantai,</P>
<P>And made one think of the sunsets at Mount Huashan.</P>
<P>Forget the vain effort of ploughing the clouds and fishing for the
 moon;</P>
<P>Here there is admirable privacy and ease.</P>
<P>Sit here for long enough and your mind becomes sea-vast;</P>
<P>The rising moon can be half seen through the gauzy curtains.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As Sanzang was looking around and noticing how brightly the moon and
 the stars were shining he heard the sound of voices saying, &#8220;The
 Eighteenth Lord has brought the holy monk here.&#8221; Sanzang looked up and
 saw three old men. The nearest one was white-haired and distinguished;
 the second one's temples had a green gloss and he was full of vigor;
 and the third had a pure heart and blue-black hair.</P>
<P>Their faces and clothes were all different, and they all came to bow
 to Sanzang, who returned their courtesy, saying, &#8220;I have done nothing
 to deserve this great affection you are showing for me.&#8221;</P>
<P>To this the Eighteenth Lord replied with a smile, &#8220;We have long
 heard, holy monk, of how you have found the Way and we've long been
 waiting for the good fortune of meeting you that we have enjoyed today.
 I hope that you will not be grudge the pearls of your wisdom, but will
 make yourself comfortable, sit and talk. Then we may learn about the
 true Dhyana teachings.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;May I ask the titles of the immortals?&#8221; Sanzang asked with a bow.</P>
<P>&#8220;The one with white hair,&#8221; the Eighteenth Lord replied, &#8220;is known as
 the Lone Upright Lord; the one with green temples is Master Emptiness;
 and the one with a pure heart is the Ancient Cloud-toucher. My title is
 Energy.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How old are you four venerable gentlemen?&#8221; Sanzang asked. To this
 the Lone Upright Lord replied,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am already a thousand years old;</P>
<P>I touch the sky and my leaves are always spring.</P>
<P>Elegant are my fragrant branches</P>
<P>Shaped like dragons and snakes;</P>
<P>My shadow is broken into many parts;</P>
<P>My body is covered in snow.</P>
<P>Since childhood I have stood firm and endured;</P>
<P>Now I am happy to cultivate the True.</P>
<P>The birds and phoenixes that perch are not mere mortal ones;</P>
<P>I am free and far from the dust of the normal world.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Master Emptiness spoke next with a smile:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've borne wind and frost for a thousand years,</P>
<P>Strong in my tall body and the vigor of my limbs.</P>
<P>In the still of the night comes the sound of raindrops,</P>
<P>And the shade spreads like a cloud in autumn sunlight.</P>
<P>My gnarled roots have the secret of eternal life;</P>
<P>I have been given the art of never aging.</P>
<P>Storks stay here and dragons, not common creatures:</P>
<P>I am green and full of life, as in immortals' land.&#8221;</P>
<P>Then the Ancient Cloud-toucher said with a smile,</P>
<P>&#8220;Over a thousand autumns have I passed in emptiness;</P>
<P>Lofty is the view that grows ever purer.</P>
<P>Here there is no commotion, but eternal cool and calm;</P>
<P>I am full of spirit and have seen much frost and snow.</P>
<P>The seven worthies come to talk about the Way;</P>
<P>I sing and drink with my friends, the six men of leisure.</P>
<P>Lightly beating the jade and the gold</P>
<P>My nature is one with heaven; I roam with immortals.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Then Energy, the Eighteenth Lord, smiled as he said,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;My age is also over a thousand,</P>
<P>I am hoary, pure and natural.</P>
<P>Rain and dew give admirable vigor;</P>
<P>I borrow the creative power of heaven and earth.</P>
<P>Alone I flourish in ravines of wind and mist,</P>
<P>Relaxed and at my ease through all four seasons.</P>
<P>Under my green shade immortals stay</P>
<P>For chess and music and books on the Way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;All four of you immortals have lived to most advanced ages.&#8221; Sanzang
 said, &#8220;and the old gentleman Energy is over a thousand. You are
 ancient, you have found the Way, you are elegant and you are pure. Are
 you not the Four Brilliant Ones of Han times?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You flatter us too much,&#8221; said the four old men. &#8220;We're not the Four
 Brilliant Ones: we're the four from deep in the mountains. May we ask,
 worthy monk, what your illustrious age is?&#8221; Sanzang put his hands
 together and replied,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Forty years ago I left my mother's womb,</P>
<P>Fated to disaster since before my birth.</P>
<P>Escaping with my life I floated in the waves</P>
<P>Until I reached Jinshan where I renewed my body.</P>
<P>I nourished my nature and studied the sutras,</P>
<P>Sincere in worship of the Buddha, not wasting time.</P>
<P>Now that His Majesty has sent me to the West,</P>
<P>I am deeply honoured by you ancient immortals.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The four ancients then praised him, saying, &#8220;Holy monk, you have
 followed the Buddha's teaching since you left your mother's womb. By
 cultivating your conduct from childhood you have become a lofty monk
 who has found the Way. We are very happy to see you and would like to
 ask you to teach us. Could you possibly tell us the rudiments of the
 Dhyana dharma? It would be a great comfort to us.&#8221; When the venerable
 elder heard this he was not at all alarmed, and this is what he said to
 them:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Dhyana is silence; the dharma is that which saves. Silent salvation
 can only come through enlightenment. Enlightenment is washing the mind
 and cleansing it of care, casting off the vulgar and leaving worldly
 dust. Human life is hard to obtain; it is hard to be born in the
 central lands; and the true dharma is hard to find. There is no greater
 good fortune than to have all three. The wonderful Way of perfect
 virtue is subtle and imperceptible. Only with it can the six
 sense-organs and the six forms of consciousness be swept away. Wisdom
 is this: there is no death and no life, no excess and no deficiency,
 emptiness and matter are all included, holy and secular both dismissed.
 It has mastered the tools of the Taoist faith and is aware of the
 methods of Sakyamuni. It casts the net of phenomena and smashes
 nirvana. Perception within perception is needed, enlightenment within
 enlightenment, then a dot of sacred light will protect everything.
 Light the raging fire to illuminate the Saha realm; it alone is
 revealed throughout the dharma world. Being utterly subtle it is firmer
 than ever: who crosses the pass of mystery through verbal persuasion?
 From the beginning I cultivated the Dhyana of great awareness: I was
 fated and determined to attain enlightenment.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The four elders listened with cocked ears and were filled with
 boundless joy. Each of them kowtowed and was converted to the truth,
 saying with bows of gratitude, &#8220;Holy monk, you are the very root of the
 enlightenment to be found through Dhyana meditation.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Ancient Cloud-toucher said, &#8220;Dhyana may be silence, and the
 dharma may well save, but it is necessary for the nature to be settled
 and the mind sincere. If one is a true immortal of great awareness one
 has to sit in the Way of no-life. Our mysteries are very different.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The Way is not fixed; its form and function are one. How is yours
 different?&#8221; Sanzang asked. To this the Ancient Cloud-toucher replied
 with a smile:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;We have been firm from birth: our forms and functions are different
 from yours. We were born in response to heaven and earth and grew
 through the rain and the dew. Proudly we laugh at wind and frost; we
 wear out the days and nights. Not one leaf withers, and all our
 branches are full of firm resolve. What I say has no emptiness about
 it, but you cling to your Sanskrit. The Way was China's in the first
 place and only later looked for more evidence in the West. You are
 wearing out your straw sandals for nothing: you don't know what you are
 looking for. You are like a stone lion cutting out its own heart, or a
 fox salivating so hard it digests the marrow of its own bones. If in
 your meditation you forget your roots you will pursue the Buddha's
 reward in vain. Your words are as tangled as the brambles on our Thorn
 Ridge and as confused as the creepers. How can we accept a gentleman
 such as you? How can one like you be approved and taught? You must
 reexamine your present state and find a life of freedom in stillness.
 Only then can you learn to raise water in a bottomless basket, and make
 the rootless iron-tree flower. On the peak of the Miraculous Treasure
 my feet stand firm; I return to the assembly at Longhua.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Sanzang heard this he kowtowed in thanks, and the Eighteenth
 Lord and the Lone Upright Lord helped him back to his feet, Master
 Emptiness said with a chuckle, &#8220;Cloud-toucher's remarks revealed things
 a little too clearly. Please get up, holy monk: you don't have to
 believe every word of it. We didn't intend to use the light of the moon
 for serious discussions. We should chant poems, feel free, and let
 ourselves relax.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If we're going to recite poems,&#8221; said Cloud-toucher with a smile,
 pointing towards the stone house, &#8220;why don't we go into the hermitage
 and drink some tea?&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang answered with a bow and went over to look at the hermitage,
 above which was written in large letters TREE IMMORTALS' HERMITAGE.
 They all then went inside and decided where to sit, whereupon the red
 devil servant appeared with a tray of China-root cakes and five bowls
 of fragrant tea. The four old men urged Sanzang to eat some cakes, but
 he was too suspicious to do so, and would not take any till the four
 old men had all eaten some: only then did he eat a couple. After they
 had drunk some tea it was cleared away. Sanzang then stole a careful
 look around and saw that everything was of a delicate and intricate
 beauty in the moonlight:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Where waters flowed beside the rocks,</P>
<P>And fragrant scents from the flowers curled,</P>
<P>The scene was one of cultured peace,</P>
<P>Free from the dust of a lower world.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sanzang took great pleasure in gazing on this sight: he felt happy,
 relaxed and exhilarated. He found himself saying a line of poetry: &#8220;The
 dhyana heart revolves in moonlike purity.&#8221;</P>
<P>The couplet was completed by Energy, who said with a smile: &#8220;Poetic
 inspiration is fresher than the sky.&#8221;</P>
<P>To this Lone Upright added: &#8220;By grafting on each line embroidery
 grows.&#8221;</P>
<P>Then Emptiness said: &#8220;Pearls come when naturally the writing flows.&#8221;</P>
<P>Cloud-toucher continued: &#8220;The glory is now over: Six Dynasties
 disappear. The<I> Songs</I> are redivided to make distinctions clear.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I shouldn't have let those silly words slip out just now,&#8221; said
 Sanzang, &#8220;I was only rambling. Really, I am a beginner trying to show
 off in front of experts. Having heard you immortals talk in that fresh
 and free-ranging way I now know that you old gentlemen are true poets.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't waste time in idle chat,&#8221; said Energy. &#8220;A monk should take
 things through to the end. You started the verse, so why don't you
 finish it? Please do so at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I can't,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;It would be much better if you completed
 it for me, Eighteenth Lord.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's very nice of you, I must say!&#8221; commented Energy. &#8220;You started
 the verse so you can't refuse to finish it. It's wrong to be so stingy
 with your pearls.&#8221; Sanzang then had no choice but to add a final
 couplet:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Waiting for the tea lying pillowed in the breeze,</P>
<P>Spring is in the voice now that the heart's at ease.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;I like 'Spring is in the voice now that the heart's at ease,'&#8220; said
 the Eighteenth Lord.</P>
<P>To this Lone Upright replied, &#8220;Energy, you have a deep understanding
 of poetry, and spend all your time savoring its delights. Why don't you
 compose another poem for us?&#8221;</P>
<P>The Eighteenth Lord generously did not refuse. &#8220;Very well then,&#8221; he
 replied, &#8220;let's make up chain couplets. Each person has to start his
 couplet with the last word of the couplet before. I'll lead off:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Without spring's glory there would be no winter's death;</P>
<P>Clouds come and mists depart as if existing not.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Let me tack another couple more lines on,&#8221; Master Emptiness said.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Not any breath of wind to rock the spreading shade;</P>
<P>Visitors enjoy the Wealth and Long Life picture.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Cloud-toucher now joined in with his couplet:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Picture it like the strong old man of the Western hills,</P>
<P>Pure as the hermit of the South, the heartless man.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Lone Upright added his two lines:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;The man is a roof-beam as he has side-leaves</P>
<P>To build the office of the censorate.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Sanzang heard all this he could only sigh and say, &#8220;Indeed, your
 superb poems have a noble spirit that rises up to the heavens. Despite
 my lack of talent I would like to add a couplet to that.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Holy monk,&#8221; said Lone Upright, &#8220;you are one who has found the Way
 and a man of great cultivation. You need not add another couplet.
 Instead you can give us a whole verse so that we can try as best we can
 to match the rhyme pattern.&#8221; Sanzang had no choice but to recite the
 following regulated verse with a smile:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Travelling West with my staff to visit the Dharma King</P>
<P>I seek the wonderful scriptures to spread them far and wide.</P>
<P>The golden magic fungus blesses the poetry circle;</P>
<P>Under the trees is the scent of a thousand flowers.</P>
<P>One must go higher from the top of a hundred-foot pole,</P>
<P>Leaving one's traces in ten regions' worlds.</P>
<P>Cultivate the jade image and majestic body:</P>
<P>Before the gate of bliss is the monastery.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the four old men had heard this they were full of high praise
 for it. &#8220;Although I'm stupid and untalented,&#8221; the Eighteenth Lord said,
 &#8220;I'll take my courage in both hands and try to match your rhymes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Vigorous and proud, I smile as king of the trees:</P>
<P>Not ever the tree of heaven can match my fame.</P>
<P>A dragon and snake shadow for a thousand feet in the mountains;</P>
<P>The spring has flowed for a thousand years with its amber fragrance.</P>
<P>My spirit is at one with heaven and earth:</P>
<P>I gladly cover my traces in the wind and rain.</P>
<P>Now I am old I regret having no immortal bones</P>
<P>And rely on China-root alone to maintain my years.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;That poem started off heroically, and the next couplet had some
 strength,&#8221; said the Lone Upright Lord. &#8220;But the last line was too
 modest. Admirable! Most admirable! Let me try rhyming one too:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;I happily give a perch in the frost to the king of the birds;</P>
<P>My talent is displayed before the Hall of Four Perfections.</P>
<P>The pearly tassels of heavy dew obscure the green carpet;</P>
<P>In the light breeze stone teeth crush chilly fragrance.</P>
<P>A delicate voice intones in the corridor at night;</P>
<P>Pale autumn shadows are put away in the ancient hall.</P>
<P>I used to be offered for long life at the New Year;</P>
<P>In old age I stand proudly on the mountain.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a fine poem, what a fine poem,&#8221; said Master Emptiness. &#8220;Truly,
 the moon was working together with heaven to write it. How could such a
 clumsy fool as I am hope to match its rhymes? But I must try to patch a
 few lines together: I don't want to waste this chance:&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;The timber of roofbeams is close to kings;</P>
<P>Its fame is spread in the Palace of Great Purity.</P>
<P>The sunlit hall seems filled with azure blue;</P>
<P>Green fragrance always pervades the dark wall.</P>
<P>Strong, cold and ancient in my beauty,</P>
<P>My roots go down to the Underworld's nine springs.</P>
<P>My spreading shade gives cover like cold clouds.</P>
<P>I don't compete in prettiness with flowers.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;You three gentlemen's poems,&#8221; said Cloud-toucher, &#8220;are elegant and
 pure, like a whole sackful of embroidery and brocades being opened out.
 Although I have neither strength nor talent you three gentlemen have
 removed the block for me. If you insist I'll put a few lines of
 doggerel together. I hope they won't make you laugh:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In the bamboo grove I delight wise kings;</P>
<P>A hundred acres of me by the Wei brings fame.</P>
<P>My green skin is naturally marked by the tears of the Xiang Goddess;</P>
<P>My scaly shoots pass on the scent of history.</P>
<P>My leaves will never change their color in frost;</P>
<P>The beauty of my misty twigs can never be concealed.</P>
<P>Few have understood me since the death of Wang Huizhi;</P>
<P>Since ancient times I have been known through brush and ink.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;You venerable immortals have all composed poems like phoenixes
 breathing out pearls,&#8221; Sanzang said. &#8220;There is nothing I can add. I am
 deeply moved by the great favour you have shown me. But it is late now
 and I do not know where my three disciples are waiting for me. I cannot
 stay any longer, and I must start finding my way back. I am profoundly
 grateful for your boundless love. Could you show me my way back?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be so worried, holy monk,&#8221; replied the four ancients,
 laughing. &#8220;An encounter like this is rare in a thousand years. The sky
 is fresh and clear, and the moon makes the night as bright as day.
 Relax and sit here for a little longer. At dawn we shall see you across
 the ridge. You will certainly meet your distinguished disciples.&#8221;</P>
<P>As they were talking in came two serving maids in blue, each carrying
 a lantern of crimson silk. Behind them followed a fairy who was holding
 a sprig of apricot blossom as she greeted them with a smile. What did
 the fairy look like?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Her hair had the green of jade,</P>
<P>Her face was pinker than rouge.</P>
<P>Her starry eyes were full of light and color;</P>
<P>Her elegant eyebrows were like moth antennae.</P>
<P>She wore a red skirt with plum-blossom designs;</P>
<P>And a light jacket of gray shot with red.</P>
<P>Her curved shoes were shaped like phoenix beaks,</P>
<P>And her silk stockings were marked with mud.</P>
<P>This witch was as lovely as the woman on Tiantai,</P>
<P>No less a beauty than the Zhou king's concubine.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;To what do we owe the pleasure of your visit, Apricot Fairy?&#8221; the
 old man asked as they bowed to her.</P>
<P>Returning their bows she replied, &#8220;I hear that you have a
 distinguished guest here and are exchanging poems with him. May I meet
 him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Here he is,&#8221; said the Eighteenth Lord, pointing him out. &#8220;You don't
 need to ask.&#8221; Sanzang bowed to her but dared say nothing.</P>
<P>&#8220;Bring in the tea at once,&#8221; she said. Two more serving girls in
 yellow, carried in a red lacquer tray on which were six fine porcelain
 tea-bowls with rare fruits in them and spoons lying across the top, as
 well as a copper-inlaid iron teapot in which was hot and fragrant tea.
 When the tea had been poured the woman showed glimpses of finger as
 delicate as spring onion shoots as she presented the porcelain bowls of
 it first to Sanzang and then to the four ancients. The last cup she
 kept for herself.</P>
<P>Only when Master Emptiness invited the Apricot Fairy to sit down did
 she do so. After they had drunk the tea she leant forward and said, &#8220;As
 you ancient immortals have been having so delightful an evening could
 you tell me some of the choicest lines you've composed?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Our stuff was just vulgar rubbish,&#8221; Cloud-toucher replied. &#8220;But this
 holy monk's verses were truly superb examples of high Tang poetry.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please let me hear them if you will,&#8221; the fairy said, whereupon the
 four ancients recited Sanzang's two poems and his exposition of the
 Dhyana dharma. The woman, whose face was all smiles, then said, &#8220;I'm
 completely untalented and shouldn't really be making a fool of myself
 like this, but hearing this wonderful lines is an opportunity too good
 to waste. Could I cobble together a verse in the second rhyme pattern?&#8221;
 She then recited these lines:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Han Emperor Wu first made my name;</P>
<P>In Zhou times Confucius taught under my shade.</P>
<P>Dong Feng loved me so much he planted a wood of me;</P>
<P>Sun Chu once offered my jelly in sacrifice.</P>
<P>Soft is my pink and rain-fed beauty;</P>
<P>The misty green is shown and yet concealed.</P>
<P>When over-ripe I have a touch of sourness;</P>
<P>Each year I fall beside the fields of wheat.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the four ancients heard the poem they were all full of
 admiration for it. &#8220;How elegant it is,&#8221; they said, &#8220;and how free of
 worldly dust. At the same time the lines have something of the
 awakening of spring in them. 'Soft is my pink and rain-fed beauty.'
 That's good. 'Soft is my pink and rain-fed beauty.'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're too kind&#8212;it quite alarms me,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;The holy monk's
 lines that I heard just now were like brocade from the heart or
 embroidery in words. Could you be generous with your pearls and teach
 me one of those verses?&#8221; The Tang Priest dared not reply.</P>
<P>The woman was evidently falling for him and moving closer and closer,
 pressing herself against him and whispering to him, &#8220;Noble guest, let's
 make the most of this wonderful night for love. What are we waiting
 for? Life is short.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The Apricot Fairy admires you completely, holy monk,&#8221; said the
 Eighteenth Lord. &#8220;You must feel something for her. If you don't find
 her adorable you have very poor taste.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The holy monk is a famous gentleman who has found the Way,&#8221; said the
 Lone Upright Lord, &#8220;and he wouldn't possibly act in a way that was at
 all improper. It would be quite wrong of us to do things like that. To
 ruin his reputation and honour would be a very mean thing to do. If the
 Apricot Fairy is willing Cloud-toucher and the Eighteenth Lord can act
 as matchmakers while Master Emptiness and I act as the guarantors of
 the wedding. It would be excellent if they married.&#8221;</P>
<P>Hearing this Sanzang turned pale with horror, jumped to his feet and
 shouted at the top of his voice, &#8220;You're all monsters, trying to lead
 me astray like that. There was nothing wrong with talking about the
 mysteries of the Way with well-honed arguments, but it's disgraceful of
 you to try to ruin a monk like me by using a woman as a bait.&#8221; Seeing
 how angry Sanzang was they all bit their fingers in fear and said
 nothing more.</P>
<P>But the red devil servant exploded with thunderous fury, &#8220;You don't
 know how honoured you're being, monk. What's wrong with my sister?
 She's beautiful and charming. Her needlework aside, her gift for poetry
 alone would make her more than a match for you. What do you mean,
 trying to turn her down? You're making a terrible mistake. The Lone
 Upright Lord's idea was quite right. If you're not prepared to sleep
 with her on the quiet I'll marry the two of you properly.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang went paler still with shock. None of their arguments, however
 outrageous, had the slightest impact on him. &#8220;We've been talking to you
 very nicely, monk,&#8221; the devil servant said, &#8220;but you don't pay the
 slightest attention. If we lose our tempers and start our rough,
 country way of doing things we'll drag you off and see to it that you
 can never be a monk any longer or ever marry a wife. After that your
 life will be pointless.&#8221;</P>
<P>The venerable elder's heart remained as hard as metal or stone and he
 obdurately refused to do as they asked, wondering all the time where
 his disciples were looking for him. At the thought his tears flowed
 unquenchably. Smiling and sitting down next to him the woman produced a
 silk handkerchief from her emerald sleeve with which she wiped away his
 tears.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be so upset, noble guest,&#8221; She said. &#8220;You and I are going to
 taste the pleasures of love.&#8221; Sanzang jumped up and shouted at her to
 go away and would have left at once if they had not held him there by
 force. The row went on till daybreak.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Suddenly Sanzang heard a call of, &#8220;Master! Master! We can hear you.
 Where are you?&#8221; Monkey, Pig and Friar Sand had been searching
 everywhere all night, leading the white horse and carrying the baggage.
 They had gone through all the thorns and brambles without a moment's
 rest and by now had reached the Western side of the 250-mile-wide
 cloud-capped Thorn Ridge, This was the shout they gave when they heard
 Sanzang's angry yells. Sanzang broke free, rushed outside, and called,
 &#8220;Wukong, I'm here. Help! Help!&#8221; The four ancients, the devil servant,
 the woman and her maids all disappeared in a flash.</P>
<P>A moment later Pig and Friar Sand were there too. &#8220;How ever did you
 get here, Master?&#8221; they asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciples,&#8221; said Sanzang, clinging to Monkey, &#8220;I have put you to a
 lot of trouble. I was carried here by the old man who appeared last
 night and said he was a local deity bringing us vegetarian food&#8212;the
 one you shouted at and were going to hit. He held my hand and helped me
 inside that door there, where I saw three old men who had come to meet
 me. They kept calling me 'holy monk' and talked in a very pure and
 elegant way. They were marvellous poets, and I matched some verses with
 them. Then at about midnight a beautiful woman came with lanterns to
 see me and made up a poem herself. She kept calling me 'noble guest'.
 She liked the look of me so much she wanted to sleep with me. That
 brought me to my senses. When I refused they offered to be matchmakers
 and guarantors, and to marry us. I swore not to agree and was just
 shouting at them and trying to get away when to my surprise you turned
 up. Although they were still dragging at my clothes they suddenly
 disappeared. It must have been because it was dawn and because they
 were frightened of you too.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Did you ask them their names when you were talking about poetry?&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey asked. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;I asked them their titles. The
 oldest was Energy, the Eighteenth Lord; the next oldest was the Lone
 Upright Lord; the third was Master Emptiness; and the fourth the
 Ancient Cloud-toucher. They called the woman Apricot Fairy.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are they?&#8221; Pig asked, &#8220;where've they gone?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where they have gone I don't know,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;but where we
 talked about poetry was near here.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the three disciples searched with their master they found a
 rock-face on which were carved the words &#8220;Tree Immortals' Hermitage.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is it,&#8221; said Sanzang, and on looking carefully Brother Monkey
 saw a big juniper, an old cypress, an old pine and an old bamboo.
 Behind the bamboo was a red maple. When he took another look by the
 rock-face he saw an old apricot tree, two winter-flowering plums, and
 two osman-thuses.</P>
<P>&#8220;Did you see the evil spirits?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's just because you don't realize that those trees have become
 spirits,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you tell that the spirits were trees?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The Eighteenth lord is the pine,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;the Lone Upright
 Lord the cypress, Master Emptiness the juniper and the Ancient
 Cloud-toucher the bamboo. The maple there was the red devil and the
 Apricot Fairy that apricot tree.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Pig heard this he ruthlessly hit with his rake and rooted with
 his snout to knock the plum, osmanthus, apricot and maple trees over,
 and as he did blood flowed from their roots. &#8220;Wuneng,&#8221; said Sanzang,
 going up to him to check him, &#8220;don't harm any more of them. Although
 they have become spirits they did me no harm. Let's be on our way
 again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be sorry for them, Master,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;They'll do people a
 great deal of harm if we let them develop into big monsters.&#8221; With that
 the idiot let fly with his rake and knocked pine, cypress, juniper ad
 bamboo all to the ground. Only then did he invite his master to remount
 and carry along the main route to the West.</P>
<P>If you don't know what happened as they pressed ahead, listen to the
 explanation in the next installment.</P>

<P>A Demon Creates a False Thunder Peak</P>
<P>All Four Pilgrims Meet with Disaster</P>
</B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The cause and effect this time revealed</P>
<P>Should make one do what's good and shun the evil.</P>
<P>Once a thought is born</P>
<P>The Intelligence is aware of it.</P>
<P>And lets it become action.</P>
<P>Why strive to learn stupidity or skill?</P>
<P>Both are medicines for heartlessness.</P>
<P>Do what is right while you are still alive;</P>
<P>Do not just drift.</P>
<P>Recognize the root and the source,</P>
<P>Escape from the trunk and the husk.</P>
<P>If seeking long life you must grasp this.</P>
<P>Watch clearly at every moment,</P>
<P>Refine your thoughts.</P>
<P>Go through the three passes, fill up the black sea;</P>
<P>The good will surely ride on the phoenix and crane.</P>
<P>Then your gloom will change to compassion</P>
<P>As you ascend to absolute bliss.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Tang Sanzang's thoughts were so pure that not only did the heavenly
 gods protect him: even the vegetable spirits had taken him along a part
 of his journey for a night of elegant conversation, thereby saving him
 from having to go through the thorns and brambles. Nor were there any
 more creepers to entangle them. As the four of them carried on West for
 another long period winter ended and spring returned.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>All things begin to flower,</P>
<P>The handle of the Dipper returns to the East.</P>
<P>Everywhere the grass is green,</P>
<P>As are the leaves of willows on the bank.</P>
<P>The ridge covered in peach blossom is red brocade;</P>
<P>The mist over the stream is a translucent gauze.</P>
<P>Frequent wind and rain,</P>
<P>Unbounded feeling.</P>
<P>Flowers open their hearts to the sun,</P>
<P>Swallows carry off the delicate moss.</P>
<P>Wang Wei should have painted the beauty of the mountains;</P>
<P>The birdsong is as persuasive as Su Qin's golden tongue.</P>
<P>Though no one sees these fragrant cushions of flowers</P>
<P>The butterflies and singing bees adore them.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Master and disciples made their way across the flowers and the grass
 ambling along with the horse until they made out in the distance a
 mountain so high that it touched the sky. Pointing at it with his
 riding crop Sanzang said, &#8220;I wonder how high that mountain is, Wukong.
 It touches the heavens and pierces the firmament.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Isn't there some ancient poem that says, 'Heaven alone is supreme:
 no mountain can equal its height?'&#8220; Monkey replied. &#8220;However high a
 mountain is it can't possibly join up with the sky.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Then why's Mount Kunlun called the pillar of heaven?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Evidently you don't know that part of the sky has always been
 missing in the Northwest,&#8221; Brother Monkey replied. &#8220;As Kunlun's in the
 Northwest corner it plugs that hole in the sky. That's why it's called
 the pillar of heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand with a smile, &#8220;stop telling him all that.
 He'll brag about it to make himself superior. We'll know how high the
 mountain is when we've climbed it.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot started chasing Friar Sand and brawling with him in a
 playful way, and the master's horse galloped as if on wings. They were
 soon at the foot of a precipice up which they made their way painfully
 slowly. This is what the mountain was like:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The wind rustling in the woods,</P>
<P>Water gushing along the beds of ravines.</P>
<P>Crows and sparrows cannot fly across it;</P>
<P>Even gods and immortals find it hard.</P>
<P>Scars and gullies endlessly twisting;</P>
<P>Clouds of dust blowing where no one can go;</P>
<P>Rocks in strange and fascinating shapes.</P>
<P>Clouds like vast expanses of water,</P>
<P>While elsewhere birds sing in the trees.</P>
<P>Deer carry magic fungus in their mouths.</P>
<P>Apes pick peaches.</P>
<P>Foxes and raccoon dogs spring around on the cliffs,</P>
<P>Large and small deer play on the ridge.</P>
<P>Then comes the spine-chilling roar of a tiger,</P>
<P>And the way is blocked by leopards and wolves.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sanzang was terrified by what he saw, but Monkey's powers were
 enormous. With his gold-banded cudgel and a mighty roar he sent the
 wolves, tigers, leopards and other wild beasts running then cleared the
 way for the master to reach the top of the mountain. Once they were
 over the summit ridge and had started going down the gentle Western
 slope they saw divine light and coloured clouds over some imposing
 buildings from which came the muffled sounds of bells and stone chimes.</P>
<P>&#8220;Look and see what that place is, disciples,&#8221; said Sanzang. Monkey
 raised his head, shaded his eyes with his hands, and on careful
 examination saw that it was a fine place:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Magnificent architecture,</P>
<P>A famous monastery.</P>
<P>The valley of emptiness is full of the earth's vibrations;</P>
<P>Heavenly fragrance pervades the stillness.</P>
<P>Rain in the bluish pines obscures the buildings;</P>
<P>Mist around the green bamboo protects the preaching hall.</P>
<P>Through coloured clouds one can make out the dragon palace;</P>
<P>The infinite worlds are seen in shimmering light.</P>
<P>Red balustrades and doors of marble,</P>
<P>Painted and carved beams.</P>
<P>Incense fills the hall in which the scriptures are taught;</P>
<P>The moon hangs over the window where the mysteries are passed on.</P>
<P>Birds sing in red trees,</P>
<P>Cranes drink from a spring in the rocks.</P>
<P>The flowers as fine as those of the Jetavana;</P>
<P>All the doors open on the brilliance of Sravasti.</P>
<P>Beside the towering buildings the gates face crags;</P>
<P>Slow is the rhythm of the bell and chime.</P>
<P>A light breeze blows into open windows,</P>
<P>And under the rolled-up curtains is a smoky haze.</P>
<P>Among the monks emotions are all calm;</P>
<P>Peace reigns in the absence of worldliness.</P>
<P>A land of immortals unsullied by earth's dust,</P>
<P>This splendid monastery of the pure land.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When he had taken a good look at it Monkey went back to report, &#8220;It's
 a monastery, Master, but for some reason there's something evil about
 the auspicious dhyana atmosphere. The place looks like the Thunder
 Monastery but the distance to here is wrong. Whatever we do we mustn't
 go rushing inside. If we do we may run into something nasty.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But if it looks like the Thunder Monastery this must surely be the
 Vulture Peak,&#8221; said the Tang Priest. &#8220;Don't try to frustrate my
 sincerest wish and put off what I've come for.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But it isn't vulture peak,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I've been there several
 times and this isn't the way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Even if it isn't there must be good people living here,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be so suspicious,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;The road goes straight
 past the gate, so we can find out at a glance,&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>Whipping on the horse, the venerable elder arrived at the monastery
 gate, above which the words THUNDER MONASTERY were written.</P>
<P>This came as such a surprise to him that he fell to the ground from
 the horse, saying abusively, &#8220;Wretched macaque! You'll be the death of
 me. Here we are at the Thunder Monastery and you're still trying to
 trick me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be angry, Master,&#8221; said Monkey with a forced smile. &#8220;Take
 another look. There are three words over the gate. Why did you only
 read two of them out, then get angry with me?&#8221; Still shaking, the
 master climbed to his feet again for another look and saw that there
 were in fact three words written there: LESSER THUNDER MONASTERY.</P>
<P>&#8220;Even if it is the Lesser Thunder Monastery,&#8221; Sanzang said, &#8220;there
 must be a Buddha in here. The three thousand Buddhas of whom the
 scriptures speak can't all live in the same place, just as the
 Bodhisattva Guanyin lives in the Southern Sea, Samantabhadra lives on
 Mount Emei and Manjusri on Mount Wutai. I wonder which Buddha's holy
 seat this is. As the saying has it,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Wherever there's a Buddha there are scriptures;</P>
<P>Everywhere you go you'll find some treasures.</P>
<P>Let's go in.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;No, we mustn't,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;This place looks thoroughly sinister.
 Don't blame me if this leads to disaster.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Even if there is not Buddha here there's bound to be a statue of a
 Buddha, and I am under a vow to worship every Buddha statue I pass,&#8221;
 Sanzang replied. &#8220;I won't blame you.&#8221; He then told Pig to get out his
 cassock, put on his mitre, neatened his clothes up and strode forward.</P>
<P>As he did so a voice from inside the gate called out, &#8220;Tang Priest,
 you've come from the East to worship our Buddha, so why are you still
 being so casual about it?&#8221; Sanzang at once started kowtowing, as did
 Pig while Friar Sand knelt. The Great Sage hung back, holding the horse
 and looking after the luggage. Once they were inside the inner gates
 they reached the Buddha Hall, outside of which were drawn up the five
 hundred arhats, the three thousand protectors, the four vajrapanis, the
 eight Bodhisattvas, nuns, lay people, and countless holy monks and lay
 brothers. Everywhere was the scent of flowers and auspicious vapors.
 The venerable elder, Pig and Friar Sand were all so overwhelmed that
 they kowtowed at every step until they reached the hall. Monkey alone
 did not bow.</P>
<P>&#8220;Sun Wukong,&#8221; came a shrill shout from the throne, &#8220;why don't you
 kowtow when you see the Buddha?&#8221; Nobody realized that Monkey had
 spotted as he took a careful look around that this was all false.</P>
<P>Letting go of the horse and putting down the luggage he shouted as he
 brandished his cudgel, &#8220;Evil beasts! What a nerve! How dare you try to
 ruin the Buddha's good name by pretending to be him! Stay where you
 are!&#8221; He raised his cudgel in both hands and was just about to strike
 when a pair of bronze cymbals came out of the sky to join together with
 a mighty crash, enclosing him completely from head to toe. Pig and
 Friar Sand grabbed desperately for their rake and staff, only to be so
 closely surrounded by the arhats, protectors, holy monks and lay
 brothers that they could not move. They and Sanzang too were all
 captured and roped up tightly.</P>
<P>Now the Buddha on the lotus throne was a demon king and all the
 arhats and others his little devils. They now put off their Buddha
 disguises, so that they looked once more like the evil creatures they
 really were, and carried the three of them round to the back to be kept
 under guard while Monkey was sealed inside the cymbals, never to be
 released. The cymbals were then set on a pedestal, and here he was to
 be turned to pus and blood within three days and nights, after which
 the other three were to be steamed in an iron steamer and eaten.
 Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The green-eyed macaque saw that it was false;</P>
<P>The dhyana monk worshipped the appearance of the Buddha.</P>
<P>The yellow-wife blindly joined in the prostration,</P>
<P>While the mother of wood foolishly agreed.</P>
<P>The monsters used force to oppress the true nature;</P>
<P>Evilly the demon king mistreated the holy man.</P>
<P>The demon king was greater than the narrow Way;</P>
<P>By taking the wrong course they threw away their lives.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Having locked the Tang Priest and his two disciples away and tied the
 horse up at the back they put Sanzang's cassock and mitre back into the
 luggage and stored that away too. They then put everything under a
 close guard.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Inside the cymbals Monkey found it pitch black and so hot that he was
 soon pouring with sweat. Push and shove though he might, there was no
 way he could get out, and when in desperation he hit out wildly all
 around with his iron cudgel he could not move the cymbals by even a
 fraction of an inch. Then he made a hand-spell that made him ten
 thousand feet tall; the cymbals grew with him. There was not a crack
 anywhere through which a chink of light could get in. He made another
 hand-spell to make himself smaller and shrank till he was as tiny as a
 mustard-seed. The cymbals shrank with him, and still there was no hole.</P>
<P>He blew a magic breath on the iron cudgel, said, &#8220;Change!&#8221; and made
 it into a flagpole with which to prop the cymbals up. Then he pulled
 two of the longer hairs from the back of his head, blew on them, said,
 &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned them into a five-part drill with a plum-blossom
 shaped bit which he turned a thousand times or more. There was a
 rasping noise but the drill made no impression.</P>
<P>By now he was feeling desperate, so he made another handspell and
 recited the words,<I> &#8220;Om ram</I> peaceful dharma world; eternal keen
 purity of the heavenly unity.&#8221;</P>
<P>This compelled the Five Protectors, the Six Dings, the Six Jias and
 the Eighteen Guardians of the Faith to gather round the cymbals and
 say, &#8220;Great Sage, we are all protecting your master and keeping the
 demons from harming him, so why do you call us here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If he dies it serves him right for ignoring my advice,&#8221; Monkey
 replied. &#8220;You lot had better find some magic to get these cymbals open
 at once and have me out of here so I can decide what to do. It's
 completely dark in here, I'm feeling very hot, and it's so stuffy it'll
 kill me.&#8221; The gods all tried to lift the cymbals, but as before it was
 impossible to move them by even a fraction of an inch.</P>
<P>&#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; said the Gold-headed Protector, &#8220;goodness only knows
 what kind of treasure this is, but they're all of a piece from top to
 bottom. We gods aren't strong enough to move them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;And I've lost count of the number of my magic powers I've used here
 without being able to move them either,&#8221; said Monkey. When the
 Protector heard this he told the Six Dings to look after Monkey and the
 Six Jias to watch over the cymbals while the guardians kept their eyes
 on what was happening all around.</P>
<P>He then set off on his beam of auspicious light and a moment later
 shot in through the Southern Gate of Heaven, where he did not wait to
 be summoned but rushed straight to the steps of the Hall of Miraculous
 Brightness to prostrate himself before the Jade Emperor and report, &#8220;My
 sovereign, I am one of the Protectors of the Four Quarters and the
 Centre. The Great Sage Equaling Heaven who is escorting the Tang Priest
 on the journey to fetch the scriptures has now reached a mountain with
 a monastery called the Lesser Thunder Monastery on it. The Tang Priest
 went in to worship under the illusion that he had reached Vulture Peak,
 but it turned out that the whole thing was a decoy to trap them. The
 Great Sage is caught inside a pair of cymbals and can't go anywhere.
 He's gradually dying. That is what I have come to report.&#8221; At once the
 Jade Emperor ordered that the Twenty-eight Constellations be sent to
 rescue them and defeat the demons.</P>
<P>Not daring to delay for a moment, the constellations went out through
 the gate of Heaven with the Protector and were soon inside the
 monastery. It was now the second of the night's five watches, and all
 the demons, senior and junior, had gone to sleep after the feast their
 king had given them to celebrate the Tang priest's capture. Doing
 nothing to disturb them, the constellations went to the cymbals and
 reported, &#8220;Great Sage, we're the Twenty-eight Constellations. The Jade
 Emperor has sent us here to rescue you.&#8221; The news made Monkey very
 happy. &#8220;Smash them open with your weapons and get me out of here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We don't dare to,&#8221; the constellations replied. &#8220;This is pure gold
 and if we hit it the noise would wake the devils up and it would be
 impossible to rescue you. We'll have to try to work it open with our
 weapons. The moment you see a chink of light in there, out you come.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Monkey. They used their spears, swords, sabers and
 battle-axes to try to lever, prise, lift, and force it open, but
 despite all their efforts the third watch came and still they had
 failed to make the slightest impression on them. It was as if the
 cymbals had been cast as a single whole. Not a chink of light could
 Monkey see from inside, no matter how hard he looked and crawled and
 rolled all around.</P>
<P>Then the Metal Dragon of the constellation Gullet said, &#8220;Don't get
 impatient, Great Sage. This must be an As-You-Will treasure and I'm
 sure it can be changed. You feel where the cymbals join from the
 inside. Once I get my horn between them you can turn yourself into
 something and get out where I've loosened them.&#8221; Monkey followed this
 suggestion and felt frantically around inside. Meanwhile the
 constellation made himself so small that his horn was no bigger than
 the point of a needle. He pushed hard with it where the two cymbals
 joined, and by exerting tremendous pressure he managed to penetrate
 inside.</P>
<P>He then gave himself a magic body by saying, &#8220;Grow! Grow! Grow!&#8221; The
 horn became as thick as a rice-bowl, but the cymbals were more like
 creatures of skin and flesh than objects cast from metal: they kept
 their close bite on the Metal Dragon of Gullet's horn, and not a crack
 appeared anywhere around.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's no use,&#8221; said Monkey, feeling the constellation's horn, &#8220;it's
 not at all loose anywhere around it. There's nothing for it: you'll
 have to bear the pain and pull me out.&#8221; The splendid Great Sage then
 changed his gold-banded cudgel into a steel gimlet, bored a hole in the
 tip of the horn, made himself the size of a mustard seed, crawled into
 the hole, squatted there, and shouted, &#8220;Pull it out.&#8221; Only through
 stupendous efforts did the constellation manage to pull his horn out,
 which left him so weak and exhausted that he collapsed.</P>
<P>Monkey then crawled out of the hole in the horn again, resumed his
 own appearance, raised his cudgel and smashed the cymbals apart with a
 tremendous noise like a copper mountain collapsing. The Buddhist
 instruments now lay shattered into thousands of fragments of gold. This
 gave the Twenty-eight Constellations a terrible fright and made the
 Protectors' hair stand on end. All the devils woke up, and as the demon
 king was shocked out of his sleep he jumped up, pulled on his clothes
 and had the drums beaten to muster all the demons with their weapons.
 By now it was nearly dawn and they all gathered round the throne. On
 seeing Monkey and the constellations standing in a ring round the
 fragments of the golden cymbals the demon king went pale from shock and
 ordered his underlings to shut the front gates and not let them escape.</P>
<P>As soon as Monkey heard this he led the Twenty-eight Constellations
 to spring up on their clouds till they were above the ninth heaven,
 while the demon king had the fragments of gold tidied away and drew his
 devilish forces up outside the monastery gates.</P>
<P>In his anger the king had no choice but to put on his armor, take his
 short and flexible wolf's-tooth spiked mace and come out of his camp
 shouting, &#8220;Sun the Novice! A real man doesn't run away from a fight.
 Come back and fight three rounds with me.&#8221; This was more than Monkey
 could stand, and he landed his cloud at the head of his starry host to
 see what the evil spirit looked like.</P>
<P>This is what he saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Matted hair</P>
<P>Held in place by a thin gold band;</P>
<P>Eyes flashing</P>
<P>Under a pair of frowning yellow brows;</P>
<P>A pear-shaped nose</P>
<P>With flaring nostrils;</P>
<P>A square-cut mouth</P>
<P>With sharp-pointed teeth.</P>
<P>He wore a coat of chain-mail</P>
<P>Tied with a tasseled raw silk sash;</P>
<P>On his feet were a pair of oxhide boots</P>
<P>And he carried a wolf's-tooth mace.</P>
<P>He looked both like a wild beast and at the same time not;</P>
<P>His face was human and yet not human.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;What kind of monster do you think you are?&#8221; shouted Monkey as he
 brandished his cudgel. &#8220;How can you have the effrontery to pose as a
 Buddha, occupy a mountain and create a false Lesser Thunder Monastery?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The only reason you've got the nerve to come rampaging around my
 magic mountain must be that you don't know my name,&#8221; the monster said.
 &#8220;This is the Lesser Western Heaven, and Heaven has given me these fine
 buildings because I have cultivated my conduct and gained the true
 achievement. I am called the Yellow-browed Buddha, though in their
 ignorance the people around here call me King Yellow Brow or Lord
 Yellow Brow. I've known about your journey to the West for a very long
 time now and I have some magic powers, which was why I could create
 those illusions to lure your master in so that you and I could have a
 trial of strength. If you can beat me I'll spare your master and his
 disciples and allow you to fulfil your true achievement. But if you
 can't I'll kill the lot of you and go myself to see the Tathagata
 Buddha, fetch the scriptures and take them to China.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You talk too much, evil spirit,&#8221; said Monkey with a laugh. &#8220;If you
 want a trial of strength try this from my cudgel.&#8221; With great pleasure
 the demon king parried it and a fine fight ensued:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A pair of cudgels,</P>
<P>Each quite different.</P>
<P>To start with what they looked like,</P>
<P>One was a short and flexible Buddha weapon,</P>
<P>The other was hard from the stores of the sea.</P>
<P>Both of them could be changed at will,</P>
<P>And today they met in a struggle for mastery.</P>
<P>The soft wolf's-tooth mace was adorned with brocade,</P>
<P>The hard gold-banded cudgel had dragon patterns.</P>
<P>They could both be admirably big or small,</P>
<P>Any length you liked and always just right.</P>
<P>Monkey and monster were evenly matched:</P>
<P>This fight between them was the real thing.</P>
<P>The monkey tamed by faith was now the mind-ape;</P>
<P>The evil monster had offended Heaven with deception.</P>
<P>In his anger and loathing neither showed mercy;</P>
<P>Both had their ways of being savagely vicious.</P>
<P>One struck to the head, never easing the pressure;</P>
<P>The other hit at the face and could not be fought off.</P>
<P>The sun went dark behind the clouds they made;</P>
<P>They breathed out mists that hid the towering crags.</P>
<P>Cudgel met cudgel as the rivals fought,</P>
<P>Both forgetting life and death for the Tang priest's sake.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The two of them fought fifty rounds without either emerging as
 victor. By the monastery gate there was much beating of drums and gongs
 as the evil spirits shouted their war-cries and waved their flags.
 Facing them were the heavenly soldiers of the Twenty-eight
 Constellations and the holy hosts of the Five Protectors, who were all
 armed and shouting as they surrounded the demon king. The demons
 outside the monastery gate were too frightened to beat their drums, and
 their hands were shaking so badly that they could not strike their
 gongs.</P>
<P>The old demon king was not at all afraid. He held all the enemy
 troops at bay with his mace in one hand while with the other he undid
 an old white cotton pouch that was round his waist as a sash; this he
 threw into the air. With a loud swish it caught the Great Sage Monkey,
 the Twenty-eight Constellations and the Protectors of the Four Quarters
 and the Centre; he then slung them over his shoulder and carried them
 back inside. All the little demons returned in triumph. The demon king
 told his underlings to fetch forty or fifty hempen ropes, opened the
 bag, and took his prisoners out one at a time to be tied up, Each of
 them felt that his bones had turned soft. Their muscles were numb and
 their skin hung loosely on them. Once tied up they were all carried out
 to the back and flung on the ground indiscriminately. The demon king
 then ordered a banquet and the devils drank from dawn till dusk before
 it broke up and they all went off to sleep.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In the middle of the night, as the Great Sage Monkey lay there tied
 up with all the gods, he heard the sound of weeping. Listening more
 carefully he recognized the voice of Sanzang, who was saying as he
 sobbed, &#8220;Wukong,&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;I wish I had heeded the warning you gave:</P>
<P>From this disaster we could have steered clear.</P>
<P>While you're being tortured in cymbals of gold,</P>
<P>Nobody knows I'm a prisoner here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Bitter the fate that afflicts us all four;</P>
<P>All our achievements have now come to naught.</P>
<P>How can we be saved from this awful impasse</P>
<P>To go to the West and then home as we ought?&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he felt sorry for his master. &#8220;Although
 ignoring my advice was what caused this disaster,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;at
 least you're remembering me in your troubles. I'd better save them all
 and let them get away while it's night, the demons are all asleep and
 nobody's on guard.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage used escaping magic to make himself so small
 that he slipped out of his bonds, went up to the Tang Priest and said,
 &#8220;Master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why are you here?&#8221; Sanzang asked, recognizing his voice. Monkey told
 him very quietly what had happened, to his great delight.</P>
<P>&#8220;Please rescue me as soon as you can,&#8221; Sanzang said. &#8220;From now on
 I'll do whatever you say and not be so stubborn.&#8221;</P>
<P>Only then did Monkey start moving, first releasing the master, Pig
 and Friar Sand, then the Twenty-eight Constellations; and the
 Protectors of the Four Quarters and the Centre, all of whom he untied
 one by one. Next he brought the horse over and told his master to carry
 on ahead as quickly as possible. Once they were outside Monkey realized
 that he did not know where the luggage was and went back to look for
 it.</P>
<P>&#8220;You seem to think that things matter more than people,&#8221; said the
 Metal Dragon of Gullet. &#8220;It ought to be enough that we've rescued your
 master. Why do you want to look for the luggage?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Of course people are important,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;but things are even
 more important. In the luggage there's our passport, the brocade
 cassock and the golden begging bowl. They're all great treasures of the
 Buddhist faith, and we must have them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You go back and look for them, brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;while we start
 out. We'll wait for you later.&#8221; Watch how the stars crowd round the
 Tang Priest and all use their magic powers at once to take him out of
 the enclosure with a breath of wind as they hurry along the main road
 down the slope till they reach level ground and rest.</P>
<P>At about the third watch the Great Sage Monkey crept slowly and
 stealthily back inside to find gate inside gate all very tightly
 closed. When he climbed up to the upper story of a building to take a
 look he saw that the windows were all fastened too. He was on the point
 of going down again but dared not move for fear of the window-frames
 making a noise. He therefore made a hand-spell, shook himself and
 turned into a mouse immortal, or what is more commonly known as a bat.
 Do you know what he looked like?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>His head was pointed like a rat's,</P>
<P>His eyes like a rat's did spark.</P>
<P>He emerged at twilight on his wings,</P>
<P>To sleep by day in the dark.</P>
<P>He hid away among the tiles;</P>
<P>The mosquitoes he caught were his food.</P>
<P>Bright moonlit nights he liked the best;</P>
<P>At flying he really was good.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He found his way in under the rafters through an open-ended tile then
 flew over doors till he got to the middle of the building. Here he
 noticed a faintly glimmering beam of light coming from under a
 second-floor window. It was not like the light of a lantern or candle,
 the glow of burning incense, a beam of evening sunlight or a flash of
 lightning. He went closer to the window, his heart in his mouth with
 excitement, and looked inside to see that the glow was coming from the
 luggage. The evil spirit had taken the cassock off the Tang Priest, but
 instead of folding it up he had thrust it untidily back into the
 bundles. The reason why the cassock glowed was because it was a Buddha
 treasure itself, with As-You-Will pearls, mani pearls, red cornelian,
 purple coral, sarira Buddha-relics and night-shining pearls on it. He
 was very pleased when he saw these things and turned back into himself
 to pick them up, put the carrying pole on his shoulder, and take them
 downstairs without stopping to adjust the ropes to balance the loads.</P>
<P>Unfortunately the load at one end slipped off and landed with a loud
 crash on the floorboards. Alas!</P>
<P>This noise woke up the old demon king sleeping downstairs, and he
 leapt out of bed with a cry of &#8220;Intruders! Intruders!&#8221; At this all the
 big and little demons got up too, lit lamps, and started searching all
 around, all shouting loudly the while, &#8220;The Tang Priest's escaped!&#8221;
 someone came in to report, to be followed by another saying, &#8220;Sun the
 Novice and all the rest of them have got away.&#8221; The old demon then
 ordered strict security on all the gates. As soon as Monkey heard this
 he abandoned the luggage, somersaulted out through the windows and fled
 before they could catch him.</P>
<P>No matter how hard they looked, the evil spirits could not find the
 Tang Priest and the rest of them. By now the day was beginning to dawn,
 so the demon king seized his mace and led his hosts in hot pursuit.
 They found the camp of the Twenty-eight Constellations and the Five
 Protectors surrounded by mists and cloud at the foot of the mountain.
 &#8220;Where do you think you're going?&#8221; the demon king shouted. &#8220;I'm here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brothers,&#8221; called the Wooden Lesser Dragon of the Constellation Horn
 in alarm, &#8220;the monsters are here.&#8221; The Metal Dragon of the Gullet, the
 Earth Bat of the Woman, the Sun Hare of the Chamber, the Moon Fox of
 the Heart, the Fire Tiger of the Tail, the Water Leopard of the
 Winnower, the Wooden Unicorn of the Dipper, the Metal Bull of the Ox,
 the Earth Raccoon-dog of the Base, the Sun Rat of the Barrens, the Moon
 Swallow of the Roof, the Fire Pig of the House, the Water Beast of the
 Wall, the Wooden Wolf of the Strider, the Metal Dog of the Harvester,
 the Earth Boar of the Stomach, the Sun Cock of the Pleiades, the Moon
 Crow of the Net, the Fire Monkey of the Turtle, the Water Ape of Orion,
 the Wooden Hyena of the Well, the Metal Goat of the Ghosts, the Earth
 River Deer of the Willow, the Sun Horse of the Seven Stars, the Moon
 Deer of the Spread Net, the Fire Snake-of the Wing, and the Water Worm
 of the Axletree, at the head of the Golden-headed Protector, the
 Silver-headed Protector, the Six Dings, the Six Jias, the Guardians of
 the Faith, Pig and Friar Sand&#8212;they did not take the Tang Priest or the
 white dragon horse&#8212;all rushed forward with their weapons. At the sight
 of them the demon king laughed a contemptuous laugh, whistled, and
 called up four or five thousand evil spirits, each of whom was powerful
 and strong. A bitter fight then followed on the Western slopes of the
 mountain, and a fine battle it was too:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The evil demon king had tricked the true nature:</P>
<P>The gentle true nature was no match for him.</P>
<P>With so many plots it was hard to escape from pain;</P>
<P>When so much cunning was used there could be no peace.</P>
<P>All the heavens offered their protection,</P>
<P>And hosts of sages helped to wage the fight.</P>
<P>The mother of wood suffers for showing mercy.</P>
<P>Determination moves the yellow-wife.</P>
<P>The bitter fight shook heaven and earth;</P>
<P>Both sides spread their nets in the struggle.</P>
<P>On one side the waving of banners and warcries,</P>
<P>On the other the beating of drums and gongs.</P>
<P>A cold sea of light from massed sabers and spears,</P>
<P>And a murderous look of the swords and the halberds.</P>
<P>The demon troops were cruel and tough;</P>
<P>The heavenly soldiers were no match for them.</P>
<P>Dreary clouds blocked out the sun and moon;</P>
<P>Spine-chilling mists lay over the landscape.</P>
<P>Hard and bitter was the fight,</P>
<P>And all because Sanzang wanted to visit the Buddha.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The evil spirit now felt more ferocious than ever as he led his hosts
 into the attack. Just when the issue was hanging in the balance there
 could be heard an angry roar from Monkey of, &#8220;I'm here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What about the luggage!&#8221; Pig asked as he greeted him.</P>
<P>&#8220;I barely got away with my life,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;so what are you
 asking about the luggage for?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop talking, you two,&#8221; said Friar Sand, who was wielding his staff.
 &#8220;Hurry up and fight the evil spirits.&#8221; The Constellations, Protectors,
 Dings, Jias and all the other gods had been surrounded and bunched
 together by the demons in the wild melee, while the demon king attacked
 the three of them with his mace. Monkey, Pig and Friar Sand held the
 enemy off by striking and swinging with their cudgel, staff and rake.
 The earth and sky were now plunged into darkness, and still there was
 no victor. They fought on till the sun set in the Western hills and the
 moon rose over the Eastern islands.</P>
<P>Seeing how late it now was, the demon whistled and told all the
 fiends to be specially careful while he produced his treasure once
 more. Monkey could see clearly as he undid the pouch and took it in his
 hands.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is bad,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Let's get out of here.&#8221; And with that he
 somersaulted straight up to the ninth heaven, not concerning himself
 with Pig, Friar Sand and the heavenly hosts, who failed to take his
 hint and were left behind to be caught in the bag again. Monkey alone
 escaped. The demon king then called off his forces and took them back
 inside the monastery, where once more he sent for ropes and tied them
 up again. The<I></I> Tang Priest, Pig and Friar Sand were hung up from
 a high beam and the white horse was tethered at the back. The gods, who
 were also bound, were carried down into a cellar that was then covered
 and sealed. We will not go into how the devils then packed everything
 away once more.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Monkey saved his life by springing up into the clouds and saw
 the devil soldiers returning, not waving their banners, he knew that
 his side must have been made prisoner once more. As he landed his
 auspicious light on the Eastern summit</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He ground his teeth in hatred of the demon;</P>
<P>The tears flowed free as Monkey missed his master.</P>
<P>Then in despair he turned his face to heaven</P>
<P>And groaned aloud at Sanzang's new disaster.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; he called, &#8220;in whatever past world did you lay down so many
 difficulties for yourself that you meet evil spirits at every turn?
 There's no end to your troubles. What are we to do?&#8221; He sighed alone up
 there for a long time before calming himself down and working out what
 to do.</P>
<P>&#8220;I wonder what sort of pouch it is the devil has that can hold so
 many things inside!&#8221; he thought. &#8220;Now it's got the gods, the heavenly
 generals and a lot of other people too. I'll have to ask Heaven to help
 me, but I fear the Jade Emperor will be angry about what has happened.
 Now I remember there's a True Martial God of the North, the Heavenly
 Honoured Demon Suppressor, who now lives on Mount Wudang in the
 Southern Continent of Jambu. I'll go and ask him to rescue my master.&#8221;
 Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>With the Way still uncompleted ape and horse were scattered;</P>
<P>When the mind was masterless the Five Elements lacked life.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know what happened on this journey listen to the

<P>The story tells how the Great Sage Sun, finding himself at his wit's
 end, somersaulted by auspicious cloud straight to Mount Wudang in the
 Southern Continent of Jambu to ask the Heavenly Honoured Demon
 Suppressor to save Sanzang, Pig, Friar Sand, the heavenly soldiers and
 all the rest of them. He flew non-stop and was soon in sight of the
 patriarch's immortal domain. As he brought his cloud gently down to
 land and took a good look around this is what he saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The great fortress of the Southeast,</P>
<P>A divine pillar of the central heaven.</P>
<P>Lotus Pinnacle soared in its majesty,</P>
<P>Purple-covered Ridge rose to a great height.</P>
<P>The nine rivers ended here, far from Jing and Yang;</P>
<P>A hundred mountains touch the stars in Wing and Axletree.</P>
<P>Above was the precious cave of Emptiness,</P>
<P>And the spirit tower of Zhu and Lu.</P>
<P>In the thirty-six palaces golden chimes rang,</P>
<P>As thousands of worshippers offered their incense.</P>
<P>Here the emperors of antiquity patrolled and worshipped,</P>
<P>Officials held jade tablets inscribed in gold.</P>
<P>Blue birds flew over lofty towers;</P>
<P>Under the canopies red gowns were worn.</P>
<P>The place was set on a mountain that towered over the cosmos,</P>
<P>An immortal domain suffused with emptiness.</P>
<P>Some plum trees were just in blossom,</P>
<P>And the hillside was covered in a blaze of color from the flowers.</P>
<P>Dragons hid at the bottom of ravines</P>
<P>While tigers lurked on the precipices.</P>
<P>The pheasants seemed to be talking;</P>
<P>Tame deer came up to people.</P>
<P>White cranes perched in cloud-topped junipers;</P>
<P>Green and red phoenixes sang to the sun.</P>
<P>Jade-pure, it resembles a land of immortals;</P>
<P>The compassion of the golden gateway rules the age.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The True Martial Lord had been born after King Purejoy and his wife
 Queen Victoria had dreamed one night that she conceived by swallowing
 the light of the sun. After fourteen months of pregnancy she had given
 birth in the royal palace on the first day of the third month of the
 year<I> jiachen,</I> the first of the reign period of<I> Kaihuang.</I>
 The prince</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Was brave from his boyhood,</P>
<P>Grew into perception.</P>
<P>Did not take the throne,</P>
<P>But practised religion.</P>
<P>His parents could not stop him.</P>
<P>He gave up the palace</P>
<P>For mysteries and trance</P>
<P>Here in the mountains.</P>
<P>When all was completed</P>
<P>He could fly by broad daylight.</P>
<P>The Jade Emperor named him</P>
<P>The True Martial Lord.</P>
<P>He responds to dark emptiness,</P>
<P>Joining with tortoise and snake.</P>
<P>In all quarters of the compass</P>
<P>Is his excellence proclaimed.</P>
<P>He penetrates all mysteries,</P>
<P>Achieves every glory.</P>
<P>From beginning to end</P>
<P>He exterminates demons.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>While admiring the splendid view the Great Sage Sun was soon through
 the first, second and third gates to his heaven. When he arrived
 outside the Palace of Great Peace he saw five hundred spirit officers
 standing crowded together in the auspicious light and atmosphere. They
 stepped forward to ask, &#8220;Who is it who has come?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am Sun Wukong, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven,&#8221; Monkey replied,
 &#8220;and I would like to see the Teacher.&#8221; The spirit officers reported
 this at once to the patriarch, who came from his throne hall to welcome
 Monkey into the palace hall.</P>
<P>After paying his respects Monkey said, &#8220;I have a request to trouble
 you with.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am in trouble escorting the Tang priest on his journey to seek
 scriptures in the Western Heaven,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;There is an evil
 monster who lives in the Lesser Thunder Monastery on a mountain called
 the Lesser Western Heaven in the Western Continent of Cattle-gift. When
 my master went in through the monastery gates and saw all the arhats,
 protectors, monks and priests line up there he thought that the Buddha
 was a real one, threw himself to the ground and started kowtowing to
 him. Then they caught him. Because I was too careless I let him trap me
 inside a pair of golden cymbals that were joined tight together without
 the slightest crack between them, just as if they were clamped
 together. Very luckily for me the Gold-headed Protector requested the
 Jade Emperor to send the Twenty-eight Constellations to come down to
 earth that very night. They couldn't prise the cymbals apart, but the
 Metal Dragon of the Gullet managed to push his horn between the cymbals
 and bring me out, thank goodness. Then I smashed the cymbals, which
 woke up the monster. When he came after us he caught us all&#8212;me, the
 Twenty-eight Constellations and the Five Protectors&#8212;and tied us all up
 with rope. I got out that night and rescued the constellations, the
 Tang Priest and the rest of them. Later I woke the old demon up again
 while I was looking for our things and he went after the heavenly
 soldiers to fight them again. When he took his pouch off to use it this
 time I recognized it and got away, but all the rest of them were
 caught. As I'm at my wit's end I've come to pay my respects to you,
 Teacher, and ask your help.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In the old days,&#8221; said the patriarch, &#8220;I garrisoned the North. My
 position was that of True Martial God, and I wiped out evil spirits all
 over the world on the orders of the Jade Emperor. Later I rode barefoot
 and with my hair loose on the leaping snake and the divine tortoise,
 and led the five thunder generals, young giant dragons, lions,
 ferocious beasts and vicious dragons to put an end to the black demonic
 atmosphere in the Northeast. That was when I was acting under the
 orders of the Original Heavenly Honoured One. Now I live in tranquility
 and ease on Mount Wudang in the Hall of Great Peace. The mountains and
 seas have long been at peace, and heaven and earth are very calm. In
 our Southern Continent of Jambu and the Northern Continent of Kuru all
 evil monsters have been exterminated and wicked demons are seen no
 more. I am very grateful that you've come to see me, Great Sage: the
 only trouble is that in the absence of instructions from Heaven I can't
 fight on my own authority alone. If I sent all my gods the Jade Emperor
 might well take offence; but if I turned your request down flat, Great
 Sage, I'd be showing a lack of finer feeling. I'm sure that even if
 there are evil creatures on that road West they cannot be really
 terrible. So I'll send General Tortoise, General Snake, and five magic
 dragons to help you. I guarantee that they will capture the evil spirit
 and rescue your master.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey then bowed in thanks to the patriarch and went with Tortoise,
 Snake and the magic dragons, all carrying the finest and sharpest of
 weapons, back to the West. Before long they were back at the Lesser
 Thunder Monastery, where they landed their clouds and went straight to
 the gate to challenge them to battle.</P>
<P>Meanwhile King Yellow Brow had called all his demonic hosts together
 before the main hall of the monastery to say to them, &#8220;Sun the Novice
 hasn't been here for the last couple of days. I wonder where he's gone
 for reinforcements.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before the words were out of his mouth a little devil came from the
 main gates to report, &#8220;Sun the Novice is here with some dragon, snake
 and tortoise officers. They're demanding battle outside the main
 gates.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How ever did that monkey get them?&#8221; the demon king asked. &#8220;Where are
 they from?&#8221;</P>
<P>With that he put on his armor and went out through the main gate,
 shouting, &#8220;Which dragon gods are you? How dare you invade my immortal
 domain?&#8221;</P>
<P>Looking majestic and summoning up their spirits, the five dragons and
 Generals Tortoise and Snake shouted, &#8220;Damned monster! We're five dragon
 gods, and Generals Tortoise and Snake who stand before the Heavenly
 Honoured Demon Suppressor, the Patriarch of the Indiffirentiated Unity,
 from the Palace of Great Peace on Mount Wudang. We are here at the
 invitation of the Great Sage Equaling Heaven and on the authority of
 the Heavenly Honoured One to arrest you. Hand over the Tang Priest, the
 constellations and all the rest of them and your life will be spared,
 you evil spirit. Otherwise we'll hack the bodies of every one of you
 devils on this mountain into little pieces, and burn all your buildings
 to ashes.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the demon heard this he was furious. &#8220;Animals!&#8221; he retorted.
 &#8220;How dare you talk like that? What sort of powers do you think you
 have? Stay where you are, and take this!&#8221; The five dragons turned their
 clouds over to make rain while the two generals raised dust and sand as
 they all charged into the attack with their spears, sabers, swords and
 halberds. Monkey followed them into action wielding his iron cudgel. It
 was a fine fight.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The evil demon used his might;</P>
<P>Monkey went for help.</P>
<P>When the evil demon used his might</P>
<P>He occupied the monastery and created Buddha images.</P>
<P>When Monkey went for help</P>
<P>He traveled far to a precious land to borrow the dragons.</P>
<P>Tortoise and Snake created water and fire;</P>
<P>The evil spirits took to arms.</P>
<P>The five dragons went to the West as instructed,</P>
<P>While Monkey hung behind for his master's sake.</P>
<P>Sword and halberd flashed like coloured lightning;</P>
<P>The spears and sabers gleamed like rainbows.</P>
<P>The wolf-toothed mace</P>
<P>Was powerful, short and flexible;</P>
<P>The gold-banded cudgel</P>
<P>Could change at its owner's will.</P>
<P>There were crashes like firecrackers,</P>
<P>And the rhythmic clang of metal being struck.</P>
<P>The monster was attacked by fire and water,</P>
<P>And weapons crowded close around the spirits.</P>
<P>The cries of battle frightened wolves and tigers;</P>
<P>The din disturbed both gods and devils.</P>
<P>Just when the battle was still unresolved</P>
<P>The evil spirit fetched out his treasure again.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Monkey had been leading the five dragons and two generals in
 fight against the demon king for an hour the demon took off his pouch
 and held it in his hand. &#8220;Watch out, gentlemen,&#8221; exclaimed Monkey in
 horror. Not realizing what was happening, they all stopped attacking
 with their weapons and surged forward. There was a loud swish as the
 demon king threw his pouch into the air. Abandoning the five dragons
 and the two generals to be wrapped up in the pouch, the Great Sage
 Monkey escaped by somersaulting up above the ninth heaven. The evil
 spirits returned in triumph once more, tied them up too, took them down
 into the pit and put the lid on it.</P>
<P>Monkey landed his cloud and lay sprawled out under the peak, listless
 and dispirited. &#8220;That demon is a terror,&#8221; he thought with bitter
 regret, and without realizing what was happening he shut his eyes as if
 he were going to sleep.</P>
<P>Just then there came a call: &#8220;Great Sage, don't go to sleep. Get up
 and rescue them as soon as you can. Your master's life is in great
 danger.&#8221; At once Monkey opened his eyes again and sprang to his feet to
 see that it was the Duty God of the Day.</P>
<P>&#8220;You wretched little god,&#8221; Monkey shouted, &#8220;you were so greedy for
 your blood and sacrifices over there that you haven't reported for duty
 for days. Why are you coming to disturb me now? Put out your foot. I'm
 going to hit you a couple of times to cheer myself up. I'm feeling
 low.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Duty God hastily bowed and said, &#8220;Great Sage, you are one of the
 happy immortals in the human world. How could you possibly be feeling
 low? We've been here for a long time on the Bodhisattva's orders to
 keep secret guard over the Tang Priest. We and the local gods have
 never left him for a moment, which is why we can't pay our respects to
 you often enough. You can't hold that against me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you're guarding him,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;tell me where the evil
 spirit has imprisoned the constellations, the protectors, the
 guardians, my master and the rest of them. What are they suffering?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your master and your fellow-disciples have been hung up in the
 cloister outside the main hall,&#8221; the Duty God replied. &#8220;The
 constellations are all in agony in a pit. For the last couple of days
 I've had no news of you, Great Sage, but I've just seen that the evil
 spirits have captured the divine dragons, Tortoise and Snake and put
 them in the pit too. It was only then that we realized you must have
 fetched some reinforcements, Great Sage, which is why we came specially
 to look for you. Whatever you do you must rescue them at once, Great
 Sage, no matter how tired you are.&#8221;</P>
<P>Hearing this, Monkey said to the duty god, the tears streaming down
 his face, &#8220;I'm too ashamed to go up to Heaven, and I haven't the nerve
 to go to the sea. I'm afraid of asking for the Bodhisattva's help and
 too miserable to look the Buddha in the face. The ones who were
 captured just now were the True Martial God's Tortoise, Snake and five
 dragons and their forces. There's nowhere else I can turn for help.
 What am I to do?&#8221;</P>
<P>The Duty God smiled as he replied, &#8220;Relax, Great Sage, I've thought
 of some elite troops who are bound to be able to subdue these demons.
 You went to Wudang just now that was in the Southern Jambu Continent.
 The troops I have in mind come from the same continent, from Bincheng
 on Mound Xuyi. It's what's now called Sizhou. There's a Great Sage
 Bodhisattva King Teacher there who has enormous magical powers. He has
 a disciple called Little Prince Zhang and four divine generals: the
 other year they subdued the Water Mother Goddess. You should go there
 yourself to ask him. If he in his kindness is willing to help you're
 bound to be able to catch the demon and save the master.&#8221;</P>
<P>The news delighted Monkey, who said, &#8220;You look after the master and
 don't let him come to any harm while I go off to ask his help.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey then set off on his somersault and left that demon-infested
 place to go straight to Mount Xuyi. He was soon there, and when he
 looked around he saw that it was a fine place.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Yangtse was not far to the South,</P>
<P>To the North it faced the Huai River.</P>
<P>To the East it led to the islands in the sea,</P>
<P>To the West it was connected with Fengfou.</P>
<P>On the mountain-top was a lofty temple</P>
<P>While springs gushed forth from its sides.</P>
<P>Grotesquely-shaped rocks towered high;</P>
<P>Lofty pines were elegantly angular.</P>
<P>There was always fresh fruit in season,</P>
<P>And every kind of flower opened in the sun.</P>
<P>People moved around like armies of ants</P>
<P>While boats came from far and wide like flights of geese.</P>
<P>On it there stood</P>
<P>The Auspicious Crag Temple,</P>
<P>The Palace of the Eastern Peak,</P>
<P>The Shrine of the Five Illustrious Ones,</P>
<P>The Tortoise Mountain Monastery.</P>
<P>Rhythmic bells and incense smoke rose to the heavens.</P>
<P>There were also</P>
<P>The Crystal Spring,</P>
<P>The Valley of Five Stupas,</P>
<P>The Terrace of Eight Immortals,</P>
<P>The Apricot Orchard.</P>
<P>The colours of the mountain and trees lit up Bincheng.</P>
<P>Boundless were the stretches of cloud,</P>
<P>While hidden birds still sang when they were tired.</P>
<P>Never mind mounts Tai, Song, Heng or Hua;</P>
<P>Here was the beauty of an earthly paradise.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Great Sage enjoyed the view enormously as he crossed the Huai
 River, entered the city of Bincheng, and arrived at the gates of the
 Great Sage's Dhyana Monastery. Over the majestic halls and colorful
 cloisters there towered a pagoda. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>It rose ten thousand feet through clouds to the sky;</P>
<P>The golden vase penetrated the heavens above.</P>
<P>The light from it filled the universe;</P>
<P>No shadows were cast on its windows.</P>
<P>Heavenly music was heard when the wind rang the bells;</P>
<P>The sun shone on roof-dragons facing the Buddha-hall.</P>
<P>Birds constantly came here to sing their complaints;</P>
<P>Endlessly beautiful was the view of the Huai River.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey looked at it all as he went in to the inner gates, where the
 Bodhisattva King Teacher, who was expecting him, had come out to meet
 him with Little Prince Zhang. After they had greeted each other and
 exchanged polite remarks Monkey said, &#8220;I'm escorting the Tang Priest to
 fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven. We have come to the
 Lesser Thunder Monastery where there's a Yellow-browed Demon who's
 pretending to be a Buddha. Not realizing he was an impostor, my master
 kowtowed to him and was captured. Then I was caught inside a pair of
 golden cymbals until, thank goodness, the constellations who had been
 sent down from heaven rescued me. I smashed the cymbals, but when we
 fought him again he wrapped the heavenly gods, the protectors, the
 guardians, my master and my fellow-disciples up in a cloth bag. As I
 have nowhere else to turn, Bodhisattva, I've come to call on you and
 ask you to give play to your great strength. Use the magic powers with
 which you put down the Water Mother and saved the common people to go
 with me to rescue my master. Then he can take the scriptures back to
 China to be transmitted forever, praise the wisdom of our Buddha and
 make the prajna-paramita better known.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What you ask today is indeed for the greater glory of our Buddha,&#8221;
 said King Teacher, &#8220;and I really ought to go myself. But it's early
 summer now, just the time when the Huai River floods. The Great Sage
 Water Ape I subdued recently gets active when there's water, and I'm
 worried that he'd take advantage of my absence to make so much trouble
 that no divine powers could bring him back under control. I'll send my
 disciple with four generals to help you force the demon into
 submission.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey thanked him then headed back by cloud with the four generals
 and Little Prince Zhang to the Lesser Western Heaven, where they went
 straight to the Lesser Thunder Monastery. Here Little Prince Zhang
 brandished his paper-white spear and the four generals swung their
 superb swords as they shouted abuse to challenge the demons to battle.</P>
<P>When the little devils ran inside to report this, the demon king led
 his devils out once more, had his drums beaten and replied, &#8220;Who've you
 persuaded to come this time?&#8221;</P>
<P>Before the words were all out of his mouth Little Prince Zhang at the
 head of the four generals shouted, &#8220;Damned evil spirit! Do you have no
 eyes in your head? Don't you recognize who we are?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Whose underlings are you?&#8221; the demon king said. &#8220;How dare you help
 him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am the disciple of the Great Sage of Sizhou, the Bodhisattva King
 Teacher, and I'm here on his orders with four divine generals to
 capture you,&#8221; the prince replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;What sort of martial arts do you have,&#8221; replied the demon king with
 a sneer, &#8220;that give you the nerve to be so insulting?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As you want to know about my martial powers,&#8221; the prince replied,
 &#8220;let me tell you:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>My people come from the Flowing Sands River,</P>
<P>Where my father used to be king of Sandland.</P>
<P>I was a weak and sickly child,</P>
<P>Born under a bad influence and an unlucky star.</P>
<P>Long had I admired my master's immortal powers,</P>
<P>When in a chance meeting he taught me the secret.</P>
<P>Half a pill of elixir cured my sickness;</P>
<P>I abandoned my throne to cultivate my conduct.</P>
<P>Once I knew bow to live as long as heaven;</P>
<P>My face became youthful and will remain so forever.</P>
<P>I have been to the assemblies under the dragon-flower tree,</P>
<P>And ridden by cloud to the Buddha's hall.</P>
<P>Seizing the fogs and winds I subdued the watery tribe;</P>
<P>I defended the mountain by subduing dragons and tigers.</P>
<P>The dutiful people raised a lofty pagoda</P>
<P>To calm the seas through the glow of its relics.</P>
<P>My paper-white spear can capture all demons;</P>
<P>Evil spirits are caught in the gray sleeve of my coat.</P>
<P>Now peace and joy reign in the city of Bincheng,</P>
<P>And all the world praises Little Zhang's fame.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the demon king heard this he replied with a touch of a mocking
 smile, &#8220;Prince, when you abandoned your throne to follow the
 Bodhisattva King Teacher what sort of arts of immortality did you
 learn? All you're good for is capturing water monsters in the Huai
 River. You shouldn't have believed all the nonsense Sun the Novice
 talked and have come across all those mountains and rivers to offer
 your life. We'll soon find out whether you're immortal or not.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Little Zhang heard this he was very angry and thrust straight
 for the demon's face with his spear. The four generals all rushed into
 the attack together and so did the Great Sage Monkey, wielding his iron
 cudgel. The splendid evil spirit was not afraid in the least as he
 blocked, parried and struck back with his short and flexible wolf-tooth
 mace. It was a fine battle:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The little prince with his paper-white spear,</P>
<P>Made stronger by the four generals' swords,</P>
<P>Wukong using his gold-banded cudgel,</P>
<P>With one heart they surrounded the demon king.</P>
<P>Truly his magical powers were great</P>
<P>As without a trace of fear he resisted their attacks.</P>
<P>The wolf-tooth mace was a Buddha weapon</P>
<P>Preserving him from wounds by swords or spear.</P>
<P>Wile howled the wind</P>
<P>Through the turbid swirl of evil vapors.</P>
<P>One used his skill for love of mortal things;</P>
<P>The other's heart was set on the Buddha and the scriptures.</P>
<P>They charged and they raged,</P>
<P>Shrouding sun, moon and stars in cloud,</P>
<P>Each of them evil and vicious in anger.</P>
<P>For long the Three Vehicles could not assert dominance:</P>
<P>Bitter and well-matched was the battle of rival skills.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After the fight had been going on for a long time and was still
 inconclusive the evil spirit undid his pouch and Monkey once more
 shouted, &#8220;Look out, gentlemen.&#8221; The prince and his followers did not
 realize what he was telling them to look out for, so with a swish the
 demon king had them caught in his pouch. Only Monkey escaped in time.
 We will not describe how once more the demon king returned in triumph,
 sent for ropes, and had them tied up and put into the pit under lock
 and lid.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Monkey leapt up into the sky and saw the demon leading his
 troops back and fastening the gates he brought his auspicious light
 down to land and stood on the Western slope of the mountain. &#8220;Master!&#8221;
 he wept aloud in his misery,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Since being converted and becoming a monk</P>
<P>I've been grateful to Guanyin for ending my woes.</P>
<P>In escorting you West to seek the great Way</P>
<P>I have helped you towards the Buddha's own temple.</P>
<P>Who would have thought when the going looked easy</P>
<P>That we'd be attacked by so mighty a monster.</P>
<P>None of my tricks or devices succeed;</P>
<P>All the help I have looked for has just been in vain.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As Monkey was in the very depths of misery a brightly-coloured cloud
 suddenly landed to the Southwest and the whole mountain peak was lashed
 with a torrential rainstorm. &#8220;Wukong,&#8221; a voice called, &#8220;do you know who
 I am?&#8221; Monkey hurried forward to look and this is what he saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Big ears, a broad jaw and a square face;</P>
<P>Wide shoulders, a deep chest and a fat body.</P>
<P>A jolly voice that was full of fun,</P>
<P>A pair of bright and sparkling eyes.</P>
<P>His clothes hung open; luck was all about him.</P>
<P>His straw sandals were comfortable and his spirits high.</P>
<P>He was the lord of the land of bliss,</P>
<P>The laughing monk Maitreya.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As soon as Monkey saw him he kowtowed immediately and said, &#8220;Where
 are you going, Lord Buddha from the East? I beg you to forgive me for
 failing to keep out of your way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm here because of the demon in the Lesser Thunder Monastery,&#8221; the
 Buddha replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;I am very grateful for your great kindness, my lord,&#8221; Monkey
 replied. &#8220;May I ask where the demon is from and where he became an evil
 spirit? What sort of treasure is that pouch of his? Please tell me, my
 lord.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He was a yellow-browed page who used to strike my stone chime,&#8221; the
 Buddha Maitreya replied. &#8220;On the third day of the third month this year
 I left him looking after my palace when I went to an assembly of the
 Primal One. That was when he stole some of my treasures and became a
 spirit as an imitation Buddha. That pouch is my future heaven bag, or
 what's generally called a human seed bag. The wolf-tooth cudgel was
 originally the stick for striking the chime.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he shouted, &#8220;You're a splendid laughing monk,
 I must say. By letting that boy escape you let him masquerade as a
 Buddha and ruin things for me. You ought to be charged with slack
 management of your household.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I was careless,&#8221; Maitreya replied. &#8220;Besides, your master and you
 disciples have not yet come to the end of the demons you will have to
 deal with. That is why every kind of spiritual creature has been coming
 down to earth. It's right that you should suffer. Now I'm here to
 capture him for you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That evil spirit has very great magic powers,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and
 you haven't got any weapons. How can you possibly subdue him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll make a little hut under the mountain,&#8221; said Maitreya, &#8220;where I
 grow fruit and melons. You challenge him to battle, lose in the fight
 that follows, and lure him into my melon patch. All my melons are still
 unripe, so you're to change into a big ripe melon. When he gets there
 he's bound to want a melon and I'll give you to him. Once you're in his
 stomach you can do what you like to him. Then I'll get his pouch and we
 can put him inside it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's a very good plan,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;but how will you know which
 is the ripe melon I'll have turned into? And why should he be willing
 to go there after me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm the ruler of the world,&#8221; laughed Maitreya, &#8220;and I have
 miraculous vision. Of course I'll know which one is you. I'd recognize
 you whatever you turned into. The only worry is that the demon won't
 come after you. I'll have to teach you some new magic.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But he's bound to catch me in his pouch,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;not come
 after me. What magic power could I use?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stretch your hand out,&#8221; Maitreya said. Monkey stretched out his left
 hand. Maitreya moistened the forefinger of his own right hand with some
 magic saliva, wrote &#8220;stop&#8221; on it, and told Monkey to make a fist. If he
 opened that hand again in the demon's face the demon would certainly
 come after him.</P>
<P>Monkey cheerfully made the fist as he had been instructed and went
 back to the monastery gates, brandishing his cudgel with one hand as he
 shouted, &#8220;Evil spirit, your lord and master Monkey's here. Come out at
 once and we'll see who's the champion.&#8221; When the little devils rushed
 inside to report the demon king asked how many soldiers Monkey had
 brought with him this time.</P>
<P>&#8220;None,&#8221; they replied. &#8220;He's here by himself.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That Monkey's at his wit's end and exhausted,&#8221; the demon king
 laughed, &#8220;and he can't get anyone else to help. He's just throwing his
 life away now.&#8221; Once he was in his armor again he took his treasure and
 his flexible wolf-tooth mace and went out through the monastery gates
 shouting, &#8220;You won't be able to hold out this time, Sun Wukong.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Damned demon,&#8221; Monkey replied abusively. &#8220;What do you mean, I won't
 be able to hold out?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Look at you,&#8221; the demon replied. &#8220;You're at your wit's end and
 exhausted. There's nobody else you can turn to for help. Now you're
 here again to try to resist me there won't be any more divine soldiers
 or anything like that to help you. That's why I said you wouldn't be
 able to hold out.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Fiend,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you don't even know whether you want to live
 or to die. Stop all that talk and take this!&#8221;</P>
<P>Seeing that Monkey was wielding his cudgel single-handed, the demon
 burst out laughing: &#8220;What a clever little ape! Do you think you'll be
 able to hold me off by using your cudgel one-handed?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My dear boy,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;if I used both hands it would be too
 much for you. Even with four or five hands you wouldn't be able to beat
 me even if I had one hand tied behind my back. That is, as long as you
 didn't use that pouch of yours.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well then,&#8221; the demon king replied, &#8220;I won't use my treasure.
 I'll give you a straight fight and we'll see who's the best man.&#8221; With
 that he raised his wolf-tooth mace and attacked Monkey, who opened his
 clenched fist in the demon's face before wielding the cudgel in both
 hands. Once the demon was under the spell he put all thought of retreat
 out of his mind and indeed did not use his pouch, but went for Monkey
 with his mace. Monkey feinted then turned and fled in defeat, pursued
 by the evil spirit down the Western slopes of the mountain.</P>
<P>As soon as he saw the melon field Monkey rolled himself into a ball
 to go into it and turn himself into a big, ripe, sweet watermelon. The
 evil spirit stopped to look all around, not knowing where Monkey had
 gone.</P>
<P>He rushed over to the hut and asked, &#8220;Who's growing these melons?&#8221;</P>
<P>Maitreya, who had turned himself into an old melon grower, came out
 of the thatched hut and said, &#8220;I am, Your Majesty.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Have you got any ripe ones?&#8221; the demon king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Maitreya replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Pick me a ripe one then,&#8221; said the demon. &#8220;I'm thirsty.&#8221;</P>
<P>Maitreya then picked the melon that was Monkey transformed and handed
 it to the demon king respectfully with both hands. The demon king did
 not stop to examine it, but took it and bit into it. This was Monkey's
 chance to go straight down the demon's throat. Without any more ado he
 started hitting out and kicking, grabbing and clawing at the monster's
 entrails and stomach, turning somersaults, standing on his head, and
 doing just as he liked. The evil spirit ground his teeth and grimaced
 in agony, the tears flowing down his face, as he rolled around the
 melon field till it looked like a threshing floor.</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop, stop!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Save me, save me.&#8221;</P>
<P>Maitreya then reverted to his true form and said with a jolly smile,
 &#8220;Evil beast, do you recognize me?&#8221;</P>
<P>When the evil spirit looked up he fell to his knees on the ground,
 rubbing his stomach with both hands and kowtowing as he said, &#8220;Spare
 me,. master, spare me. I'll never do it again.&#8221;</P>
<P>Maitreya then stepped forward, seized him with one hand, undid the
 future heaven pouch, took back the stick for beating the stone chime,
 and said, &#8220;Sun Wukong, spare his life for my sake.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey, who was still beside himself with loathing and hatred, went
 on punching, kicking, and making havoc in the demon's insides until the
 demon collapsed in unbearable agony.</P>
<P>&#8220;He's had all he can take, Wukong,&#8221; Maitreya said. &#8220;Spare him now.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Open your mouth wide,&#8221; Sun Wukong finally said, &#8220;and let me out.&#8221;
 Although the demon's insides had been tied up into agonizing knots his
 heart had not yet been damaged, and as the saying goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Until the heart is damaged nobody dies;</P>
<P>Leaves only fall when the trunk's sap dries.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As soon as he was told to open his mouth wide he did so, in spite of
 the pain. Only then did Monkey jump out and turn back into himself. He
 at once seized his cudgel and was about to strike again, but the Buddha
 Maitreya had already put the evil spirit into the pouch and slung it at
 his waist. Holding the chime-stick in his hand Maitreya said, &#8220;Evil
 beast, where are the golden cymbals you stole?&#8221;</P>
<P>The monster, who was desperate to live, could be heard mumbling
 inside the future heaven bag, &#8220;Sun Wukong smashed them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If they're broken give me my gold back,&#8221; said Maitreya.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's piled up on the lotus throne in the main hall,&#8221; the monster
 replied.</P>
<P>Holding the bag in one hand and the stick in the other the Buddha
 laughed as he said, &#8220;Wukong, you and I are going to get my gold back.&#8221;
 After the display of such dharma power Sun Wukong dared not be at all
 remiss, but took the master back up the mountain and into the
 monastery, where they gathered all the pieces of gold.</P>
<P>Although the monastery gates were firmly shut one push with the stick
 was enough to open them wide, and when they looked inside they saw that
 all the little devils had taken the monastery's wealth and were now
 fleeing in all directions. When Monkey found one he killed one; when he
 found two he killed two; and so on until he had killed all the six or
 seven hundred little devils, who resumed their real forms as mountain
 spirits, tree monsters, evil beasts and animal demons.</P>
<P>The Buddha gathered all the pieces of gold together, blew on them
 with magic breath, and said the words of a spell. At once they were the
 two golden cymbals again. He then took his leave of Monkey and headed
 straight back to his paradise by auspicious cloud. The Great Sage then
 released the Tang Priest, Pig and Friar Sand.</P>
<P>After being hung up there for several days the idiot was desperately
 hungry. Without waiting to thank Monkey he ran straight to the kitchen,
 his back bent, to find some food. As it happened the demon had sent for
 his lunch but not had time to eat it when Monkey challenged him to
 battle. The moment he saw it Pig ate half a saucepan of rice before
 fetching a pair of bowls for the master and Friar Sand each to eat two
 bowlfuls. Only then did he thank Monkey and ask about the evil spirit.</P>
<P>Monkey told him all about how he had asked the help of King Teacher,
 Tortoise and Snake, then borrowed the prince from the True Lord, and
 about how Maitreya had subdued the demon. When Sanzang heard this he
 expressed his gratitude at great length and kowtowed to all the
 heavens. &#8220;Disciple,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;where are all the gods imprisoned?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The Duty God of the Day told me yesterday that they were all in the
 pit,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Pig,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;you and I are going to
 rescue them.&#8221;</P>
<P>Now that he had eaten, the idiot was full of strength and energy
 again as he found his rake and went with Monkey to open up the pit,
 untie the prisoners, and ask them to come out to under the tower.
 Sanzang, who had now put his cassock back on, bowed to each of them in
 thanks, after which the Great Sage saw the five dragons and two
 generals off on their way back to Wudang, Little Prince Zhang and the
 four generals on their way to Bincheng, and the Twenty-eight
 Constellations on their way back to the palaces of Heaven. He also
 released the Protectors and Guardians so that each could return to his
 own territory.</P>
<P>Master and disciples stayed on in the monastery to rest for a few
 hours. Then, after the horse had eaten its fill and the luggage all
 been packed, they set out again the next morning. Before leaving they
 burnt the towers, thrones, halls and preaching chambers to ashes. Thus
 it was that</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Without any cares from their troubles they flee,</P>
<P>From disasters and obstacles finally free.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know when they reached the Great Thunder Monastery,
 listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="1_0_68">Chapter 67</A></H3>
</I>
<P>The Dhyana-Nature Is Stable and Tuoluo Village Is Saved</P>
<P>The Mind of the Way Is Purified As Corruption Is Removed</P>
</B>
<P>The story tells how Sanzang and his three disciples happily continued
 along their way after leaving the Lesser Western Heaven. They had been
 going for over a month, and it was now late spring. The flowers were in
 bloom and all the woods they could see were full of green shade. After
 a spell of wind and rain dusk was falling once more.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang, reining in his horse, &#8220;it's getting late.
 Which way shall we go to look for somewhere to spend the night?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry, Master,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile. &#8220;Even if we can't
 find anywhere to stay we three all have our skills. Tell Pig to cut
 some grass and Friar Sand to fell some pines. I know a bit of
 carpentry. We can make ourselves a hut by the road here good enough to
 stay in for a year. Why the rush?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But this is no place to stay, brother,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;The mountain's
 crawling with wild beasts like tigers, leopards and wolves. Mountain
 ogres and hobgoblins are all over the place. It's hard enough
 travelling by daylight. I wouldn't dare spend the night here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Idiot!&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;You're getting more and more hopeless. I'm not
 just shooting my mouth off. With this cudgel in my hands I could hold
 up the sky itself if it collapsed.&#8221;</P>
<P>Master and disciples were in the middle of their conversation when
 they noticed a hill farm not far away. &#8220;Good,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;a place
 for the night.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where?&#8221; the venerable elder asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Isn't that a house in the trees over there?&#8221; asked Monkey, pointing.
 &#8220;Let's ask if we can put up for the night there. We can be on our way
 first thing in the morning.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang was so delighted he urged his horse forward. Dismounting
 outside the wicker gates he found them firmly fastened.</P>
<P>&#8220;Open up, open up,&#8221; he called, knocking on the gates. They were
 opened from the inside by an old man with a stick who was wearing rush
 sandals, a black turban and a plain gown.</P>
<P>&#8220;Who's that shouting?&#8221; he asked.</P>
<P>Putting his hands together in front of his chest, Sanzang bowed in
 polite greeting and said, &#8220;Venerable patron, I am a monk sent from the
 East to fetch scriptures from the Western Heaven. As I have reached
 this distinguished place so late in the day I have come to your
 residence to ask for a night's lodging. I beg you to be charitable to
 us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Monk,&#8221; the elder said, &#8220;you may want to go to the West, but you'll
 never get there. This is the Lesser Western Heaven, and it's a very
 long way from here to the Great Western Heaven. This place alone is
 hard enough to get out of, to say nothing of the difficulties of the
 rest of the journey.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why is it hard to get out of?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>The old man put his hands together and replied, &#8220;About a dozen miles
 West of our village is a Runny Persimmon Lane and a mountain called
 Seven Perfections.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why 'Seven Perfections?'&#8220; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's 250 miles across,&#8221; the old man replied, &#8220;and covered with
 persimmons. There's an old saying that persimmon trees have seven
 perfections:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>1. They prolong life.</P>
<P>2. They are very shady.</P>
<P>3. No birds nest in them.</P>
<P>4. They are free of insects.</P>
<P>5. Their leaves are very beautiful after frost.</P>
<P>6. The fruit is excellent.</P>
<P>7. The branches and leaves are big and fat.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>That's why it's called Mount Seven Perfections. This is a big, thinly
 populated area, and nobody has ever been deep into the mountain. Every
 year over-ripe, rotten persimmons fall on the path, and they fill the
 rocky lane right up. The rain, dew, snow and frost attack them, and
 they rot all through the summer until the whole path is a mass of
 putrefaction. The people round here call it Runny Shit, or Runny
 Persimmon, Lane. When there's a West wind it smells even worse than a
 cesspit being emptied. As it's now high spring and there's strong
 Southeasterly blowing you can't smell it yet.&#8221; Sanzang felt too
 depressed to speak.</P>
<P>Monkey could not contain himself. &#8220;Silly old fool,&#8221; he shouted at the
 top of his voice. &#8220;We're here late at night to find somewhere to stay,
 and you're trying to scare us with all that talk. If your house really
 is so poky that there's no room for us to sleep indoors we'll spend the
 night squatting under this tree. So cut the cackle.&#8221; At the sight of
 Monkey's hideous face the old man shut his mouth, petrified with fear.</P>
<P>Then he plucked up his courage, pointed his stick at Monkey and
 shouted, &#8220;Damn you, you bony-faced, pointy-browed, flat-nosed,
 sunken-cheeked, hairy-eyed, sickly-looking devil. You've got no sense
 of respect, sticking your mouth out like that and insulting an old
 gentleman.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're not very perceptive, old chap,&#8221; Monkey replied, putting on a
 smile. &#8220;You don't realize who this sickly-looking devil is. As the
 manual of physiognomy says, 'A freakish face is like a rock in which
 fine jade is hidden.' You're completely wrong to judge people on their
 looks. Ugly I certainly am, but I know a trick or two.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you from?&#8221; the old man asked. &#8220;What's your name? What
 powers do you have?&#8221; To this Monkey replied with a smile:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;My home is in the Eastern Continent of Superior Body;</P>
<P>My conduct I cultivated on the Mount of Flowers and Fruit.</P>
<P>After studying with the Patriarch of the Spirit-tower Heart Mountain</P>
<P>I learned complete and perfect skill in the martial arts.</P>
<P>I can stir up the oceans, subdue mother dragons,</P>
<P>Carry mountains on my shoulders, and drive the sun along.</P>
<P>At capturing monsters and demons I'm champion;</P>
<P>Ghosts and gods are terrified when I shift the stars.</P>
<P>Great is my fame as sky-thief and earth-turner;</P>
<P>I'm the Handsome Stone Monkey of infinite transformations.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This turned the old man's anger to delight. Bowing to them he said,
 &#8220;Please come into my humble abode and make yourselves comfortable.&#8221; The
 four of them then went in together, leading the horse and carrying the
 load. All that could be seen to either side of the gates were prickly
 thorns. The inner gates were set in a wall of brick and stone that had
 more thorns on top of it, and only when they had gone through them did
 they see a three-roomed tiled house. The old man pulled up chairs for
 them to sit on while they waited for tea to be brought and gave orders
 for a meal. Soon a table was brought in and set with wheat gluten,
 beancurd, sweet potatoes, radishes, mustard greens, turnips, rice and
 sour-mallow soup.</P>
<P>Master and disciples all ate their fill. After the meal Pig pulled
 Monkey aside and whispered, &#8220;Brother, the old bloke wasn't going to let
 us stay at first. Now he's given us this slap-up meal. Why?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It wasn't worth very much, was it?&#8221; Brother Monkey replied.
 &#8220;Tomorrow we'll make him give us ten kinds of fruit and ten dishes of
 food.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've got a nerve,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;You talked him into giving us a
 meal all right with all that boasting. But we'll be on our way
 tomorrow. How can he give you things?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be so impatient,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;I've got a way to cope.&#8221;</P>
<P>Dusk soon started to draw in. The old man brought a lamp, and Monkey
 asked with a bow, &#8220;What is your surname, sir?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Li,&#8221; the old man replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;I suppose this must be Li Village,&#8221; Monkey continued.</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the old man, &#8220;this is Tuoluo Village. Over five hundred
 families live here. Most of them have other surnames. I am the only one
 called Li.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Benefactor Li,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;with what kind intentions did you
 give us that ample meal?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Just now you said that you could capture evil monsters,&#8221; said the
 old man. &#8220;We have a monster here that we'd like you to capture for us,
 and we will of course reward you generously.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey then chanted a &#8220;na-a-aw&#8221; of respect and said, &#8220;I accept your
 commission.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Just look at him,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;asking for trouble. The moment he
 hears there's a demon to catch he's nicer to him than he would be to
 his own grandfather. He even chanted a 'na-a-aw' first.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't understand, brother,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;My 'na-a-aw' clinched
 the deal. Now he won't hire anyone else.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Sanzang heard this he said, &#8220;You monkey, you always want to grab
 things for yourself. If that evil spirit's powers are too great for you
 to capture him then we monks will be shown up as liars.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be cross with me, Master,&#8221; Monkey said with a smile. &#8220;Let me
 ask some more questions.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What else?&#8221; the old man asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;This fine village is on an open plain and a lot of people live
 here,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;It's not remote and isolated. What evil spirit
 would dare come to your door?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I will be frank with you,&#8221; the old man replied. &#8220;We had long lived
 in peace and prosperity here till a sudden, strong wind blew three and
 a half years ago. Everyone was busy at the time threshing the wheat on
 the threshing floor or transplanting rice in the paddy fields. We
 thought it was just a change in the weather. We never imagined that
 when the wind had blown by an evil spirit would eat the horses and
 cattle that people had put out to pasture as well as the pigs and the
 sheep. He swallowed hens and geese whole, and any men or women he found
 he devoured alive. Since then he's come again each of the last two
 years to murder us. Venerable sir, if you really do have magic powers
 to capture the evil spirit and cleanse the place of him, we will most
 certainly reward you generously and with great respect.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But the monster will be hard to catch,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;very hard. We're pilgrim monks only here for the
 night. We'll be on our way tomorrow. We can't catch any monsters.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So you monks just tricked that meal out of me,&#8221; the old man said.
 &#8220;When we first met you talked very big. You said you could move the
 stars and capture evil monsters. But now I've told you about this you
 pretend he can't be caught.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Old man,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;it would be easy to catch the evil spirit,
 except that you people here don't work together. That's why it's hard.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you be so sure that we don't work together?&#8221; the old man
 asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;If the monster has been harassing you for three years, goodness only
 knows how many lives he's taken,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;I reckon that if
 every family put up one ounce of silver the five hundred households
 could raise five hundred ounces, and with that you could find a priest
 somewhere who'd exorcise the monster. Why did you cheerfully put up
 with three years of such cruelty from him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You talk of spending money,&#8221; the old man said. &#8220;You're trying to
 shame us to death. Every family here has spent four or five ounces of
 silver. The year before last we went to invite a Buddhist monk South of
 the mountains here to catch the monster, but he failed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How did the monk try to do it?&#8221; Brother Monkey asked. To this the
 old man replied:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;The monk wore a cassock</P>
<P>And recited the scriptures;</P>
<P>First the Peacock Sutra</P>
<P>And then the Lotus.</P>
<P>He burned incense in a burner,</P>
<P>Held a bell between his hands.</P>
<P>His reading of the scriptures</P>
<P>Alarmed the evil spirit,</P>
<P>Who came straight to the farm</P>
<P>Amid his wind and clouds.</P>
<P>The monk fought with the spirit</P>
<P>And it was a splendid sight:</P>
<P>One of them landed a punch,</P>
<P>The other grabbed at his foe.</P>
<P>The monk had the advantage of</P>
<P>Having a hairless head.</P>
<P>But soon the demon had won,</P>
<P>And gone straight back to his clouds.</P>
<P>When the wound had dried in the sun</P>
<P>We went up close for a look;</P>
<P>The monk's bald head was smashed open</P>
<P>Just like a ripe watermelon.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;In other words,&#8221; laughed Monkey, &#8220;he lost.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He just paid with his life,&#8221; the old man replied. &#8220;We were the ones
 who lost. We had to buy his coffin, pay for his funeral, and give
 compensation to his disciple. That silver wasn't enough for the
 disciple. He's still trying to sue us. He won't call it a day.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Did you hire anyone else to catch the demon?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Last year we invited a Taoist priest to do it,&#8221; the old man
 answered.</P>
<P>&#8220;How did he try?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The Taoist,&#8221; the old man replied,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wore a golden crown on his head,</P>
<P>And magic robes on his body,</P>
<P>He sounded his magic wand,</P>
<P>Used charms and water too.</P>
<P>He made gods and generals do his will,</P>
<P>Captured demons and goblins.</P>
<P>A wild wind howled and roared,</P>
<P>While black fog blotted all out.</P>
<P>Demon and Taoist</P>
<P>Were evenly matched;</P>
<P>They fought till nightfall,</P>
<P>When the fiend went back to the clouds.</P>
<P>Heaven and earth were clear</P>
<P>And all of us people were there.</P>
<P>We went out to search for the priest,</P>
<P>Found him drowned in the mountain stream.</P>
<P>When we fished him out to look</P>
<P>He was like a drenched chicken.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;In other words,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile, &#8220;he lost too.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He only paid with his life, but we had to spend a lot of money that
 wasn't really necessary,&#8221; the old man replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;It doesn't matter,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;It doesn't matter. Wait till I
 catch the demon for you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you've got the power to catch him I'll ask some of the village
 elders to write an undertaking to give you as much silver as you want
 when you've defeated him. You'll not be a penny short. But if you lose
 don't try to extort money out of us. We must each accept the will of
 heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Old man,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;they've got you terrified of extortion.
 We're not like that. Send for the elders.&#8221;</P>
<P>The old man was delighted. He sent his slaves to invite seven or
 eight old men from among his next-door neighbors, his cousins, his
 wife's family and his friends. They all came to meet the strangers, and
 when they had greeted the Tang Priest they cheerfully discussed the
 capture of the demon.</P>
<P>&#8220;Which of your distinguished disciples will do it?&#8221; they asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I will,&#8221; said Monkey, putting his hands together in front of his
 chest.</P>
<P>&#8220;You'll never do, never,&#8221; said the old man with horror. &#8220;The evil
 spirit's magic powers are enormous, and it's huge too. Venerable sir,
 you're so tiny and skinny you'd slip through one of the gaps between
 its teeth.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Old man,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile, &#8220;You're no judge of people.
 Small I may be, but I'm solid. There's a lot more to me than meets the
 eye.&#8221; When the elders heard this they had to take him at his word.</P>
<P>&#8220;Venerable sir,&#8221; they said, &#8220;how big a reward will you want for
 capturing the demon?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why do you have to talk about a reward?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;As the
 saying goes, 'Gold dazzles, silver is white and stupid, and copper
 coins stink.' We're virtuous monks and we definitely won't take money.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case you must all be lofty monks who obey your vows,&#8221; the
 elders said. &#8220;But even if you won't accept money we can't let you work
 for nothing. We all live by agriculture. If you subdue the demon and
 clean the place up, every family here will give you a third of an acre
 of good farmland, which will make over 150 acres altogether. Your
 master and you disciples can build a monastery there and sit in
 meditation. That would be much better than going on your long journey.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It would be even worse,&#8221; replied brother Monkey with a smile. &#8220;If we
 asked for land we'd have to raise horses, do labor service, pay grain
 taxes and hand over hay. We'll never be able to go to bed at dusk or
 lie in after the fifth watch. It'd be the death of us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you won't accept anything, how are we to express our thanks?&#8221; the
 elders asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;We're men of religion,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Some tea and a meal will be
 thanks enough for us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's easy,&#8221; said the elders. &#8220;But how are you going to catch the
 demon?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Once it comes I'll get it,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;But it's enormous,&#8221; the elders said. &#8220;It stretches from the earth to
 the sky. It comes in wind and goes in mist. How are you ever going to
 get close to it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When it comes to evil spirits who can summon winds and ride on
 clouds,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;I treat them as mere kids. It makes no
 difference how big it is&#8212;I have ways of beating it.&#8221;</P>
<P>As they were talking the howl of a great wind made the eight or nine
 elders start shaking with fear. &#8220;Monk, you've asked for trouble and
 you've got it,&#8221; they said. &#8220;You talked about the monster and here he
 is.&#8221;</P>
<P>Old Mr. Li opened the door and said to his relations and the Tang
 Priest, &#8220;Come in, come in, the demon's here.&#8221;</P>
<P>This so alarmed Pig and Friar Sand that they wanted to go inside too,
 but Monkey grabbed each of them with one of his hands and said, &#8220;You're
 a disgrace. You're monks and you ought to know better. Stay where you
 are, and don't try to run away. Come into the courtyard with me. We're
 going to see what kind of evil spirit this is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;they've been through this before. The noise
 of the wind means that the demon's coming. They've all gone to hide.
 We're not friends or relations of the demon. We've had no business
 dealings with him. What do we want to see him for?&#8221; Monkey was so
 strong that with no further argument he hauled them into the courtyard
 and made them stand there while the wind blew louder and louder. It was
 a splendid wind that</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Uprooted trees and flattened woods, alarming wolves and tigers,</P>
<P>Stirred up the rivers and oceans to the horror of ghosts and gods,</P>
<P>Blowing the triple peaks of the great Mount Hua all upside down,</P>
<P>Shaking the earth and sky through the world's four continents.</P>
<P>Every village family shut fast its gates,</P>
<P>While boys and girls all fled for cover.</P>
<P>Black clouds blotted out the Milky Way;</P>
<P>Lamps lost their brightness and the world went dark.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Pig was shaking with terror. He lay on the ground, rooted into the
 earth with his snout and buried his head. He looked as if he had been
 nailed there. Friar Sand covered his face and could not keep his eyes
 open. Monkey knew from the sound of the wind that the demon was in it.
 A moment later, when the wind had passed, all that could be vaguely
 made out in the sky were two lamps.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brothers,&#8221; he said, looking down, &#8220;the wind's finished. Get up and
 look.&#8221; The idiot tugged his snout out, brushed the dirt off himself and
 looked up into the sky, where he saw the two lamps.</P>
<P>&#8220;What a laugh,&#8221; Pig said, laughing aloud, &#8220;What a laugh. It's an evil
 spirit with good manners. Let's make friends with it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's a very dark night,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;and you haven't even seen
 it, so how can you tell whether it's good or bad?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As they used to say in the old days,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;'Take a candle
 when you're out at night, and stay where you are if you haven't one.'
 You can see that it's got a pair of lanterns to light its way. It must
 be a good spirit.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're wrong,&#8221; Friar Sand said. &#8220;That's not a pair of lanterns:
 they're the demon's eyes.&#8221; This gave the idiot such a fright that he
 shrank three inches.</P>
<P>&#8220;Heavens,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If its eyes are that size goodness knows how big
 its mouth is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be scared, brother,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;You two guard the master
 while I go up and see what sort of mood it's in and what kind of evil
 spirit it is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;don't tell the monster about us.&#8221;</P>
<P>Splendid Monkey sprang up into mid-air with a whistle. &#8220;Not so fast,&#8221;
 he yelled at the top of his voice, brandishing his cudgel, &#8220;not so
 fast. I'm here.&#8221; When the monster saw him it took a firm stance and
 began to wield a long spear furiously.</P>
<P>Parrying with his cudgel, Monkey asked, &#8220;What part do you come from,
 monster? Where are you an evil spirit?&#8221; The monster ignored the
 questions and continued with its spearplay. Monkey asked again, and
 again there was no answer as the wild spearplay continued.</P>
<P>&#8220;So it's deaf and dumb,&#8221; Monkey smiled to himself. &#8220;Don't run away!
 Take this!&#8221; Unperturbed, the monster parried the cudgel with more wild
 spearplay. The mid-air battle ebbed and flowed until the middle of the
 night as first one then the other was on top, but still there was no
 victor. Pig and Friar Sand had a very clear view from the Li family
 courtyard, and they could see that the demon was only using its spear
 to defend itself and not making any attacks, while Monkey's cudgel was
 never far from the demon's head.</P>
<P>&#8220;Friar Sand,&#8221; said Pig with a grin, &#8220;you keep guard here. I'm going
 up to join in the fight. I'm not going to let Monkey keep all the
 credit for beating the monster to himself. He won't be the first to be
 given a drink.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid idiot leapt up on his cloud and joined in the fight,
 taking a swing with his rake. The monster fended this off with another
 spear. The two spears were like flying snakes or flashes of lightning.
 Pig was full of admiration.</P>
<P>&#8220;This evil spirit is a real expert with the spears. This isn't
 'behind the mountain' spearplay; it's 'tangled thread' spearplay. It's
 not Ma Family style. It's what's called soft-shaft style.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't talk such nonsense, idiot,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;There's no such
 thing as soft-shaft style.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Just look,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;He's parrying us with the blades. You
 can't see the shafts. I don't know where he's hiding them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;All right then,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;perhaps there is a soft-shaft style.
 But this monster can't talk. I suppose it's not yet humanized: it's
 still got a lot of the negative about it. Tomorrow morning, when the
 positive is dominant, it's bound to run away. When it does we've got to
 catch up with it and not let it go.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>When the fight had gone on for a long time the East grew light. The
 monster didn't dare fight any longer, so it turned and fled, with
 Monkey and Pig both after it. Suddenly they smelled the putrid and
 overwhelming stench of Runny Persimmon Lane on Mount Seven Perfections.</P>
<P>&#8220;Some family must be emptying its cesspit,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;Phew! What a
 horrible stink!&#8221;</P>
<P>Holding his nose, Brother Monkey said, &#8220;After the demon, after the
 demon!&#8221; The monster went over the mountain and turned back into
 himself: a giant red-scaled python. Just look at it:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Eyes shooting stars,</P>
<P>Nostrils gushing clouds,</P>
<P>Teeth like close-set blades of steel,</P>
<P>Curving claws like golden hooks.</P>
<P>On its head a horn of flesh</P>
<P>Like a thousand pieces of agate;</P>
<P>Its body clad in scales of red</P>
<P>Like countless patches of rouge.</P>
<P>When coiled on the ground it might seem a brocade quilt;</P>
<P>When flying it could be mistaken for a rainbow.</P>
<P>From where it sleeps a stench rises to the heavens,</P>
<P>And in movement its body is wreathed in red clouds.</P>
<P>Is it big?</P>
<P>A man could not be seen from one side to the other.</P>
<P>Is it long?</P>
<P>It can span a mountain from North to South.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;So it's a long snake,&#8221; Pig said. &#8220;If it's a man-eater it could
 gobble up five hundred for a meal and still not be full.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Its soft-shafted spears are its forked tongue,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;It's
 exhausted by the chase. Attack it from behind.&#8221; Pig leapt up and went
 for it, hitting it with his rake. The monster dived into a cave, but
 still left seven or eight feet of tail sticking outside.</P>
<P>Pig threw down his rake, grabbed it and shouted, &#8220;Hold on, hold on!&#8221;
 He pulled with all his strength, but could not move it an inch.</P>
<P>&#8220;Idiot,&#8221; laughed Monkey, &#8220;let it go in. We'll find a way of dealing
 with it. Don't pull so wildly at the snake.&#8221; When Pig let go the
 monster contracted itself and burrowed inside.</P>
<P>&#8220;But we had half of it before I let go,&#8221; he grumbled. &#8220;Now it's
 shrunk and gone inside we're never going to get it out. We've lost the
 snake, haven't we?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The wretched creature is enormous and the cave is very narrow,&#8221;
 Monkey replied. &#8220;It won't possibly be able to turn round in there. It
 definitely went straight inside, so the cave must have an exit at the
 other end for it to get out through. Hurry round and block the back
 door while I attack at the front.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot shot round to the other side of the mountain, where there
 was indeed another hole that he blocked with his foot. But he had not
 steadied himself when Monkey thrust his cudgel in at the front of the
 cave, hurting the monster so much that it wriggled out through the
 back. Pig was not ready, and when a flick of the snake's tail knocked
 him over he could not get back up: he lay on the ground in agony.
 Seeing that the cave was now empty Monkey rushed round to the other
 side, cudgel in hand, to catch the monster. Monkey's shouts made Pig
 feel so ashamed that he pulled himself to his feet despite the pain and
 started lashing out wildly with his rake.</P>
<P>At the sight of this Monkey said with a laugh, &#8220;What do you think
 you're hitting? The monster's got away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm 'beating the grass to flush out the snake.'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Cretin!&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;After it!&#8221;</P>
<P>The two of them crossed a ravine, where they saw the monster coiled
 up, its head held high and its enormous mouth gaping wide. It was about
 to devour Pig, who fled in terror. Monkey, however, went straight on
 towards it and was swallowed in a single gulp.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; wailed Pig, stamping his feet and beating his chest,
 &#8220;you've been destroyed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't fret, Pig,&#8221; called Monkey from inside the monster's belly,
 which he was poking around with his cudgel. &#8220;I'll make it into a
 bridge. Watch!&#8221; As he spoke the monster arched its back just like a
 rainbow-shaped bridge.</P>
<P>&#8220;It looks like a bridge all right,&#8221; Pig shouted, &#8220;but nobody would
 ever dare cross it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Then I'll make it turn into a boat,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Watch!&#8221; He pushed
 out the skin of the monster's belly with his cudgel, and with the skin
 against the ground and its head uplifted it did look like a river boat.</P>
<P>&#8220;It may look like a boat,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;but without a mast or sail it
 wouldn't sail very well in the wind.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Get out of the way then,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;and I'll make it sail for
 you.&#8221; He then jabbed his cudgel out as hard as he could through the
 monster's spine from the inside and made it stand some sixty or seventy
 feet high, just like a mast. Struggling for its life and in great pain
 the monster shot forward faster than the wind, going down the mountain
 and back the way it had come for over seven miles until it collapsed
 motionless in the dust. It was dead.</P>
<P>When Pig caught up with the monster he raised his rake and struck
 wildly at it. Monkey made a big hole in the monster's side, crawled out
 and said, &#8220;Idiot! It's dead and that's that. Why go on hitting it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;don't you realize that all my life I've
 loved killing dead snakes?&#8221; Only then did he put his rake away, grab
 the snake's tail and start pulling it backwards.</P>
<P>Meanwhile back at Tuoluo Village old Mr. Li and the others were
 saying to the Tang Priest, &#8220;Your two disciples have been gone all
 night, and they're not back yet. They must be dead.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm sure that there can be no problem,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;Let's go
 and look.&#8221; A moment later Monkey and Pig appeared, chanting as they
 dragged an enormous python behind them. Only then did everyone feel
 happy.</P>
<P>All the people in the village, young and old, male and female, knelt
 down and bowed to Sanzang, saying, &#8220;Good sirs, this is the evil spirit
 that has been doing so much damage. Now that you have used your powers
 to behead the demon and rid us of this evil we will be able to live in
 peace again.&#8221; Everyone was very grateful, and all the families invited
 them to meals as expressions of their gratitude, keeping master and
 disciples there for six or seven days, and only letting them go when
 they implored to be allowed to leave. As they would not accept money or
 any other gifts the villagers loaded parched grain and fruit on horses
 and mules hung with red rosettes and caparisoned with flags of many
 colours to see them on their way. From the five hundred households in
 the village some seven or eight hundred people set out with them.</P>
<P>On the journey they were all very cheerful, but before they reached
 Runny Persimmon Lane on Mount Seven Perfections Sanzang smelled the
 terrible stench and could see that their way was blocked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; he said to Monkey, &#8220;how are we going to get through?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's going to be hard,&#8221; replied Monkey, covering his nose. When even
 Monkey said that it was going to be hard Sanzang began to weep.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't upset yourself so, my lord,&#8221; said old Mr. Li and the other
 elders as they came up to him. &#8220;We have all come here with you because
 we're already decided what to do. As your illustrious disciples have
 defeated the evil spirit and rid the village of this evil we have all
 made up our minds to clear a better path for you over the mountain.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's nonsense, old man,&#8221; said Monkey with a grin. &#8220;You told us
 before that the mountain is some 250 miles across. You aren't Yu the
 Great's heavenly soldiers, so how could you possibly make a path across
 it? If my master is to get across it'll have to be through our efforts.
 You'll never do it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But how can we do it through our efforts?&#8221; Sanzang asked after
 dismounting.</P>
<P>&#8220;It'd certainly be hard to cross the mountain as it is now,&#8221; Monkey
 said, still smiling, &#8220;and it would be even harder to cut a new path.
 We'll have to go by the old lane. The only thing that worries me is
 that there may be nobody to provide the food.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a thing to say, venerable sir,&#8221; old Mr. Li said. &#8220;We can
 support you gentlemen for as long as you care to stay here. You can't
 say that nobody will provide the food.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case, go and prepare two hundredweight of parched grain, as
 well as some steamed cakes and buns,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;When our
 long-snouted monk has eaten his fill he'll turn into a giant boar and
 clear the old lane with his snout. Then my master will be able to ride
 his horse over the mountain while we support him. He'll certainly get
 across.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;you want to keep all the rest of you clean. Why
 should I be the only one to stink?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wuneng,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;if you can clear the lane with your snout
 and get me across the mountain that will be a very great good deed to
 your credit.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master, benefactors, please don't tease me,&#8221; said Pig with a smile.
 &#8220;I can do thirty-six transformations. If you ask me to become something
 that's light or delicate or beautiful or that flies I just can't. But
 ask me to turn into a mountain, a tree, a rock, a mound of earth, an
 elephant, a hog, a water buffalo or a camel and I can manage any of
 them. The only thing is that the bigger I make myself the bigger my
 belly gets. I can't do things properly unless it's full.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We've got plenty,&#8221; the people said, &#8220;We've got plenty. We've brought
 parched grain, fruit, griddle cakes and ravioli. We were going to give
 them to you when we'd made a path across the mountain. They can all be
 brought out for you to eat now. When you've transformed yourself and
 started work we'll send some people back to prepare more food to send
 you on your way with.&#8221; Pig was beside himself with delight.</P>
<P>Taking off his tunic and putting down his nine-pronged rake he said
 to them all, &#8220;Don't laugh at me. Just watch while I win merit doing
 this filthy job.&#8221; The splendid idiot made a spell with his hands, shook
 himself, and turned himself into a giant hog. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>His snout was long, his bristles short, and half of him was fat;</P>
<P>As a piglet in the mountains he had fed on herbs and simples.</P>
<P>Black was his face and his eyes as round as sun or moon;</P>
<P>The great ears on his head were just like plantain leaves.</P>
<P>His bones he'd made so strong he would live as long as heaven;</P>
<P>His thick skin had been tempered till it was hard as iron.</P>
<P>He grunted with a noise that came from a blocked-up nose;</P>
<P>His gasping breath rasped harshly in his throat.</P>
<P>Each of his four white trotters was a thousand feet high;</P>
<P>Every sword-like bristle was hundreds of yards in length.</P>
<P>Since pigs were first kept and fattened by mankind</P>
<P>Never had such a monster porker been seen as this today.</P>
<P>The Tang Priest and the rest were full of admiration</P>
<P>For Marshal Tian Peng and his magic powers.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Seeing what Pig had turned into, Brother Monkey asked the people who
 had come to see them off to pile up all the parched grain at once and
 told Pig to eat it. Not caring whether it was cooked or raw, the idiot
 downed it all at one gulp, then went forward to clear the way. Monkey
 told Friar Sand to take his sandals off and carry the luggage carefully
 and advised his master to sit firm in the carved saddle.</P>
<P>Then he took off his own tall boots and told everyone else to go
 back: &#8220;Could you be very kind and send some more food as soon as
 possible to keep my brother's strength up?&#8221;</P>
<P>Of the seven or eight hundred who were seeing the pilgrims off most
 had come on mules or horse and they rushed back to the village like
 shooting stars. The three hundred who were on foot stood at the bottom
 of the mountain to watch the travelers as they went away. Now it was
 ten miles or more from the village to the mountain, and another journey
 of over ten miles each way to fetch the food, making over thirty in
 all, so by the time they were back master and disciples were already
 far ahead of them. Not wanting to miss the pilgrims, the villagers
 drove their mules and horses into the lane and carried on after them
 through the night, only catching them up the next morning.</P>
<P>&#8220;Pilgrims,&#8221; they shouted, &#8220;wait a moment, wait a moment, sirs. We've
 brought food for you.&#8221; When Sanzang heard this he thanked them
 profusely, said that they were good and faithful people, and told Pig
 to rest and eat something to build up his strength. The idiot, who was
 on the second day of clearing the way with his snout, was by now
 ravenously hungry. The villagers had brought much more than seven or
 eight hundredweight of food, which he scooped up and devoured all at
 once, not caring whether it was rice or wheat. When he had eaten his
 fill he went back to clearing the way, while Sanzang, Monkey and Friar
 Sand thanked the villagers and took leave of them. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The peasants all went back to Tuoluo Village;</P>
<P>Across the mountain Pig had cleared the way.</P>
<P>Sanzang's faith was backed up by great power;</P>
<P>Sun's demon-quelling arts were on display.</P>
<P>A thousand years of filth went in a single morning;</P>
<P>The Seven Perfections Lane was opened up today,</P>
<P>The dirt of six desires all now removed,</P>
<P>Towards the Lotus Throne they go to pray.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know how much longer their journey was going to be or
 what evil monsters they would meet listen to the explanation in the
 next installment.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story tells how Sanzang and his disciples cleaned the lane of its
 filth and pressed far ahead along the road. Time passed quickly and the
 weather was scorching again. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The begonias spread their globes of brocade;</P>
<P>Lotus leaves split their own green dishes.</P>

<P>Travelers wave their silken fans for relief from the heat.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As they carried on their way a walled and moated city appeared before
 them. Reining in his horse, Sanzang, said, &#8220;Disciples, can you see
 where this is?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You can't read, Master,&#8221; Monkey exclaimed. &#8220;How ever did you get the
 Tang Emperor to send you on this mission?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have been a monk since I was a boy and read classics and
 scriptures by the thousand,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;How could you say I
 can't read?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;if you can, why ask where we are instead of
 reading the big clear writing on the apricot-yellow flag over the city
 wall?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wretched ape,&#8221; Sanzang shouted, &#8220;you're talking nonsense. The flag
 is flapping much too hard in the wind for anyone to read what, if
 anything, is on it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Then how could I read it?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't rise to his bait, Master,&#8221; Pig and Friar Sand said. &#8220;From this
 distance we can't even see the walls and moat clearly, never mind words
 in a banner.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But doesn't it say Purpuria?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Purpuria must be a Western kingdom,&#8221; Sanzang said. &#8220;We shall have to
 present our passport.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Goes without saying,&#8221; Monkey observed.</P>
<P>They were soon outside the city gates, where the master dismounted,
 crossed the bridge, and went in through the triple gates. It was indeed
 a splendid metropolis. This is what could be seen:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Lofty gate-towers,</P>
<P>Regular battlements,</P>
<P>Living waters flowing around,</P>
<P>Mountains facing to North and South.</P>
<P>Many are the goods in the streets and markets,</P>
<P>And all the citizens do thriving business.</P>
<P>This is a city fit for a monarch.</P>
<P>A capital endowed by heaven.</P>
<P>To this distant realm come travelers by land and water;</P>
<P>Jade and silk abound in this remoteness.</P>
<P>It is more beautiful than the distant ranges;</P>
<P>The palace rises to the purity of space.</P>
<P>Closely barred are the passes leading here,</P>
<P>When peace and prosperity have lasted for ever.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As master and disciples walked along the highways and through the
 markets they saw that the people were tall, neatly dressed and well
 spoken. Indeed, they were not inferior to those of the Great Tang. When
 the traders who stood on either side of the road saw how ugly Pig was,
 how tall and dark-featured Friar Sand was, and how hairy and
 wide-browed Monkey was they all dropped their business and came over to
 see them.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't provoke trouble,&#8221; Sanzang called to them. &#8220;Hold your heads
 down.&#8221; Pig obediently tucked his snout into his chest and Friar Sand
 did not dare look up. Monkey, however, stared all around him as he kept
 close to the Tang Priest. The more sensible people went away again
 after taking a look, but the idlers, the curious and the naughty
 children among the spectators jeered, threw bricks and tiles at the
 strangers, and mocked Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;Whatever you do, don't get into a row,&#8221; Sanzang said again in great
 anxiety. The idiot kept his head down.</P>
<P>Before long they turned a corner and saw a gate in a wall over which
 was written HOSTEL OF MEETING in large letters. &#8220;We are going into this
 government office,&#8221; Sanzang said.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The Hostel of Meeting is a place where people from all over the
 world are received, so we can go and disturb them,&#8221; said Sanzang.
 &#8220;Let's rest there. When I have seen the king and presented our passport
 we can leave the city and be on our way again.&#8221; When Pig heard this he
 brought his snout out, so terrifying the people following behind that
 dozens of them collapsed.</P>
<P>&#8220;The master's right,&#8221; said Pig, stepping forward. &#8220;Let's shelter
 inside there and get away from these damned mockers.&#8221; They went inside,
 after which the people began to disperse.</P>
<P>There were two commissioners in the hostel, a senior one and his
 assistant, and they were in the hall checking over their personnel
 before going to receive an official when, to their great consternation,
 the Tang Priest suddenly appeared.</P>
<P>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; they asked together. &#8220;Who are you? Where are you
 going?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have been sent by His Majesty the Tang Emperor to fetch the
 scriptures from the Western Heaven,&#8221; the Tang Priest replied, putting
 his hands together in front of his chest. &#8220;Having reached your
 illustrious country I did not dare to try to sneak through. I would
 like to submit my passport for inspection so that we may be allowed to
 continue our way. Meanwhile we would like to rest in your splendid
 hostel.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the two commissioners heard this they dismissed their
 subordinates, put on their full official dress and went down from the
 main hall to greet the visitors. They instructed that the guest rooms
 be tidied up for them to sleep in and ordered vegetarian provisions for
 them. Sanzang thanked them, and the two officials led their staff out
 of the hall. Some of their attendants invited the visitors to sleep in
 the guest rooms.</P>
<P>Sanzang went with them, but Monkey complained bitterly, &#8220;Damned
 cheek. Why won't they let me stay in the main hall?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The people here don't come under the jurisdiction of our Great Tang
 and they have no connections with our country either. Besides, their
 superiors often come to stay. It is difficult for them to entertain
 us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case.&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;I insist on them entertaining us
 properly.&#8221;</P>
<P>As they were talking the manager brought their provisions: a dish
 each of white rice and wheat flour, two cabbages, four pieces of
 beancurd, two pieces of wheat gluten, a dish of dried bamboo shoots and
 a dish of &#8220;tree-ear&#8221; fungus. Sanzang told his disciples to receive the
 provisions and thanked the manager.</P>
<P>&#8220;There's a clean cooking-stove in the Western room,&#8221; the manager
 said, &#8220;and it's easy to light the firewood in it. Would you please cook
 your own food?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;May I ask you if the king is in the palace?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;His Majesty has not attended court for a long time,&#8221; the manager
 replied. &#8220;But today is an auspicious one, and he is discussing the
 issue of a notice with his civil and military officials. You'd better
 hurry if you want to get there in time to submit your passport to him.
 Tomorrow will be too late to do it, and goodness knows how long you'll
 have to wait.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;you three prepare the meal while I hurry
 there to have our passport inspected. After we have eaten we can be on
 our way.&#8221; Pig quickly unpacked the cassock and passport for Sanzang,
 who dressed himself and set out for the palace, instructing his
 disciples not to leave the hostel or make trouble.</P>
<P>Before long the Tang Priest was outside the Tower of Five Phoenixes
 at the outer palace gate. The towering majesty of the halls and the
 splendor of the tall buildings and terraces beggared description. When
 he reached the main Southern gate he requested the reporting officer to
 announce to the court his wish to have his passport inspected.</P>
<P>The eunuch officer at the gate went to the steps of the throne, where
 he submitted the following memorial: &#8220;There is a monk at the palace
 gate sent by the Great Tang in the East to worship the Buddha and fetch
 the scriptures at the Thunder Monastery in the Western Heaven. He
 wishes to submit his passport for approval. I await Your Majesty's
 command.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the king heard this he replied happily, &#8220;For a long time we have
 been too ill to sit on our throne. Today we are in the throne room to
 issue a notice sending for doctors, and now a distinguished monk has
 arrived in our country.&#8221; He ordered that the monk be summoned to the
 steps of the throne. Sanzang abased himself in reverence. The king then
 summoned him into the throne room, invited him to sit down, and ordered
 the department of foreign relations to arrange a vegetarian meal.
 Sanzang thanked the king for his kindness and presented his passport.</P>
<P>When he had read it through the king said with great delight, &#8220;Master
 of the Law, how many dynasties have ruled in your land of Great Tang?
 How many generations of wise ministers have there been? After what
 illness did the Tang emperor come back to life, so that he sent you on
 this long and difficult journey to fetch the scriptures?&#8221;</P>
<P>On being asked all these questions the venerable elder bowed, put his
 hands together and said, &#8220;In my country,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Three Emperors ruled,</P>
<P>The Five Rulers established morality.</P>
<P>Yao and Shun took the throne,</P>
<P>Yu and Tang gave the people peace.</P>
<P>Many were the offspring of Chengzhou</P>
<P>Who each established their own states,</P>
<P>Bullying the weak with their own strength,</P>
<P>Dividing the realm and proclaiming themselves rulers.</P>
<P>Eighteen such lords of local states</P>
<P>Divided the territory up to the borders.</P>
<P>Later they became a dozen,</P>
<P>Bringing peace to the cosmic order.</P>
<P>But those who had no chariots of war</P>
<P>Were swallowed up by others.</P>
<P>When the seven great states contended</P>
<P>Six of them had to surrender to Qin.</P>
<P>Heaven gave birth to Liu Bang and Xiang Yu,</P>
<P>Each of whom cherished wicked ideas.</P>
<P>The empire then belonged to Han</P>
<P>According to the stipulations agreed between the two.</P>
<P>Power passed from Han to the Sima clan,</P>
<P>Till Jin in its turn fell into chaos.</P>
<P>Twelve states ruled in North and South,</P>
<P>Among them Song, Qi, Liang and Chen.</P>
<P>Emperors ruled in succession to each other</P>
<P>Till the Great Sui restored the true unity.</P>
<P>Then it indulged in evil and wickedness.</P>
<P>Inflicting misery on the common people.</P>
<P>Our present rulers, the House of Li,</P>
<P>Have given the name of Tang to the state.</P>
<P>Since the High Ancestor passed on the throne</P>
<P>The reigning monarch has been Li Shimin.</P>
<P>The rivers have run clear and the seas been calm</P>
<P>Thanks to his great virtue and his benevolence.</P>
<P>North of the city of Chang'an</P>
<P>Lived a wicked river dragon</P>
<P>Who gave the timely rain in short measure,</P>
<P>For which he deserved to pay with his death.</P>
<P>One night he came in a dream to the emperor,</P>
<P>Asking the monarch to spare his life.</P>
<P>The emperor promised to grant a pardon</P>
<P>And sent for his wise minister early next day.</P>
<P>He kept him there inside the palace,</P>
<P>Filling his time with a long game of chess.</P>
<P>But at high noon the minister</P>
<P>Slept, and in a dream cut off the dragon's head.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On hearing this the king groaned and asked, &#8220;Master of the Law, which
 country did that wise minister come from?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He was our emperor's prime minister Wei Zheng, astrologer,
 geographer, master of the Yin and Yang, and one of the great founders
 and stabilizers of our state,&#8221; Sanzang explained. &#8220;Because he beheaded
 the Dragon King of the Jing River in his dream, the dragon brought a
 case in the Underworld against our emperor for having him decapitated
 after granting a pardon. The emperor became very ill and his condition
 was critical. Wei Zhang wrote him a letter to take to the Underworld
 and give to Cui Jue, the judge of Fengdu. Soon after that the emperor
 died, only to come back to life on the third day. It was thanks to Wei
 Zheng that Judge Cui was persuaded to alter a document and give His
 Majesty an extra twenty years of life. He held a great Land and Water
 Mass and dispatched me on this long journey to visit many lands,
 worship the Buddha and fetch the Three Stores of Mahayana scriptures
 that will raise all the sufferers from evil up to Heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this the king groaned and sighed again. &#8220;Yours is indeed a
 heavenly dynasty and a great nation,&#8221; he said, &#8220;with a just ruler and
 wise ministers. We have long been ill, but not one minister do we have
 who will save us.&#8221; On hearing this the venerable elder stole a glance
 at the king and saw that his face was sallow and emaciated; his
 appearance was going to pieces and his spirits were very low. The
 venerable elder was going to ask him some questions when an official of
 the department of Foreign relations came to invite the Tang Priest to
 eat. The king ordered that his food should be set out with Sanzang's in
 the Hall of Fragrance so that he could eat with the Master of the Law.
 Thanking the king for his kindness Sanzang took his meal with him.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Meanwhile, back in the Hostel of Meeting, Brother Monkey told Friar
 Sand to prepare the tea, the grain and the vegetarian dishes. &#8220;There's
 no problem about the tea and the rice,&#8221; Friar Sand said, &#8220;but the
 vegetable dishes will be difficult.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no oil, salt, soya sauce or vinegar,&#8221; Friar Sand replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;I've got a few coins here,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;so we can send Pig out to
 buy them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I wouldn't dare,&#8221; said the idiot, who was feeling too lazy to go.
 &#8220;My ugly mug could cause trouble, and then the master would blame me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you buy the stuff at a fair price and don't try to get it by
 asking for alms or theft there couldn't possibly by any trouble,&#8221; said
 Brother Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Didn't you see the commotion just now?&#8221; asked Pig. &#8220;I only showed my
 snout outside the gate and about a dozen of them collapsed with fright.
 Goodness only knows how many I'd scare to death in a busy shopping
 street.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;as you know so much about the busy shopping
 streets did you notice what was being sold in them?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;The master told me to keep my head down and cause no
 trouble. Honest, I didn't see anything.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I won't need to tell you about the bars, grain merchants, mills,
 silk shops and grocers,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;But there are marvellous
 teahouses and noodle shops selling big sesame buns and steamed bread.
 You can buy terrific soup, rice, spices and vegetables in the
 restaurants. Then there are all the exotic cakes, yogurts, snacks,
 rolls, fries, and honey sweets. Any number of goodies. Shall I go out
 and buy you some?&#8221;</P>
<P>This description had the idiot drooling; the saliva gurgled in his
 throat. &#8220;Brother,&#8221; he said, jumping to his feet, &#8220;I'll let you pay this
 time. Next time I'm in the money I'll treat you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Friar Sand,&#8221; said Monkey, hiding his amusement, &#8220;cook the rice while
 I go out to buy some other ingredients.&#8221;</P>
<P>Realizing that Monkey was only fooling the idiot, Friar Sand agreed.
 &#8220;Off you go,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Buy plenty and have a good feed.&#8221; Grabbing a
 bowl and a dish the idiot went out with Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you reverend gentlemen going?&#8221; two officials asked him.</P>
<P>&#8220;To buy some groceries,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Go West along this street, turn at the drum tower, and you'll be at
 Zheng's grocery,&#8221; they said. &#8220;You can buy as much oil, salt, soya
 sauce, vinegar, ginger, pepper and tea as you like there: they've got
 them all.&#8221;</P>
<P>The two of them headed West along the road hand in hand. Monkey went
 past several teahouses and restaurants but did not buy any of the
 things on sale or eat any of the food. &#8220;Brother,&#8221; called Pig, &#8220;why
 don't we make do with what we can buy here?&#8221; This was the last thing
 that Monkey, who had only been fooling him, intended to do.</P>
<P>&#8220;My dear brother,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you don't know how to get a good
 bargain. If we go a little further you can choose bigger ones.&#8221; As the
 two of them were talking a lot of people followed jostling behind them.
 Before long they reached the drum tower, where a huge and noisy crowd
 was pushing and shoving and filling the whole road.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm not going any further, brother,&#8221; said Pig when he saw this.
 &#8220;From the way they're shouting they sound as though they're out to
 catch monks. And we're suspicious-looking strangers. What'll we do if
 they arrest us?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop talking such nonsense,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;We monks haven't broken
 the law, so monk-catchers would have no reason to arrest us. Let's
 carry on and buy the ingredients we need at Zheng's.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;never. I'm not going to ask for trouble. If I try to
 squeeze through that crowd and my ears get pulled out to their full
 length they'll collapse with fright. Several of them might get trampled
 to death, and it would cost me my life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well then,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;You stand at the foot of this wall
 while I go and buy the things. I'll bring you back some wheaten cakes.&#8221;
 The idiot handed the bowl and dish to Monkey then stood with his back
 to the crowd and his snout against the foot of the wall. He would not
 have moved for anything in the world.</P>
<P>When Monkey reached the drum tower he found that the crowds really
 were very dense. As he squeezed his way through them he heard people
 saying that a royal proclamation had been posted at the tower: this was
 what all the people were struggling to see. Monkey pushed forward till
 he was close to it, then opened wide his fiery eyes with golden pupils
 to read it carefully. This is what was written:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We, the King of Purpuria in the Western Continent of Cattle-gift,
 from the beginning of our reign gave peace to the four quarters and
 tranquillity to the people. Recently the state's misfortunes have
 confined us to our bed with a chronic illness that has continued for a
 very long time. Recovery has proved impossible, and the many excellent
 prescriptions of our country's Royal College of Medicine have not yet
 effected a cure. We hereby issue an invitation to all experts in
 medicine and pharmacy among the wise men of the world, whether from the
 North or the East, from China or from foreign countries, to ascend to
 the throne hall and heal our sickness, in the event of a recovery we
 will give half our kingdom. This is no empty promise. All those who can
 offer cures should come to this notice.</P>
<P>When Monkey had read this he exclaimed with delight, &#8220;As they used to
 say in the old days, 'Make a move and your fortune's one third made.' I
 was wrong to stay put in the hostel. There's no need to buy groceries,
 and fetching the scriptures can wait for a day while I go and have a
 bit of fun as a doctor.&#8221; The splendid Great Sage bent low, got rid of
 the bowl and dish, took a pinch of dust, threw it into the air, said
 the words of a spell and made himself invisible. He then went up to the
 notice, quietly took it down, and blew towards the Southeast with a
 magic breath.</P>
<P>Immediately a whirlwind arose that scattered all the people there.
 Monkey then went straight back to where Pig was standing, his nose
 propped against the foot of the wall as if he were fast asleep. Brother
 Monkey folded the notice up, slipped it inside the lapel of Pig's tunic
 without disturbing him, turned and went back to the hostel.</P>
<P>As soon as the whirlwind started blowing all the people in the crowd
 at the foot of the drum tower covered their heads and shut their eyes,
 never imagining that when the wind fell the royal proclamation would
 have disappeared. They were horrorstruck. That morning twelve palace
 eunuchs and twelve guards officers had come out to post it, and now it
 had been blown away after less than six hours. In fear and trembling
 the people searched all around for it until a piece of paper was
 spotted sticking out of Pig's lapel.</P>
<P>&#8220;So you took the proclamation down, did you?&#8221; they asked, going up to
 him.</P>
<P>Looking up with a start the idiot thrust his nose up at them, making
 the guards officers stagger about and collapse with terror. He turned
 to flee, only to be grabbed by several bold spirits who blocked his
 way.</P>
<P>&#8220;You've taken down the royal proclamation inviting doctors, so you're
 coming to the palace to cure His Majesty,&#8221; they said. &#8220;Where else d'you
 think you're going?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm your son if I tore the poster down,&#8221; said Pig in panic. &#8220;I'd be
 your grandson if I could cure disease.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What's that sticking out of your tunic?&#8221; one of the officers asked.</P>
<P>Only then did the idiot look down and see that there really was a
 piece of paper there. Opening it he ground his teeth and swore, &#8220;That
 macaque is trying to get me killed!&#8221; He gave an angry roar and was just
 about to tear it up when they all stopped him.</P>
<P>&#8220;You're a dead man,&#8221; they said. &#8220;That's a proclamation His Majesty
 issued today. How dare you tear it up? As you've put it in your tunic
 you're no doubt a brilliant doctor. Come with us at once!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't understand,&#8221; shouted Pig. &#8220;It wasn't me that took it down.
 It was my fellow disciple Sun Wukong. He sneaked it into my tunic then
 abandoned me. We'll all have to go and find him to get to the bottom of
 this.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; they said. &#8220;We've got a bell here&#8212;we're not going off to
 play one that's still being cast. You can say what you like. Drag him
 off to see His Majesty.&#8221; Not bothering to get to the truth of the
 matter they pushed and pulled the idiot, who stood his ground as firmly
 as if he had taken root there. Over ten of them tried to move him
 without any success. &#8220;You've got no respect,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;If you go on
 pulling at me and make me lose my temper I'll go berserk, and don't
 blame me then.&#8221;</P>
<P>It had not taken long for this commotion to stir up the whole
 neighbourhood, and Pig was now surrounded. Two elderly palace eunuchs
 in the crowd said, &#8220;You look very odd and you sound wrong too. Where
 are you from, you ruffian?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We're pilgrims sent from the East to fetch the scriptures from the
 Western Heaven,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;My master is the younger brother of the
 Tang emperor and a Master of the Law. He's just gone to the palace to
 hand his passport over for inspection. I came here with my brother
 disciple to buy some groceries, but there were so many people by the
 tower that I was scared to go any further. He told me to wait here.
 When he saw the proclamation he made a whirlwind, took it down, sneaked
 it into my tunic and went away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We did see a monk with a plump white face going in through the
 palace gates,&#8221; one of the eunuchs said. &#8220;Perhaps that was your master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where did your fellow disciple go?&#8221; the eunuch asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;There are four of us altogether,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;When the master went to
 present his passport the other three of us stayed with our luggage and
 our horse in the Hostel of Meeting. My brother's played a trick on me
 and gone back there ahead of me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Let go of him, officers,&#8221; the eunuch said. &#8220;We'll all go to the
 hostel together and find out what's really happening.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You two ladies are very sensible,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;Monk, you don't know about anything,&#8221; said the officers. &#8220;How can
 you address gentlemen as ladies?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're shameless,&#8221; laughed Pig. &#8220;You've made them change sex. Fancy
 calling these two old females gentlemen instead of women or ladies!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's enough of your insolence,&#8221; they all said. &#8220;Find your fellow
 disciple at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>The noisy crowd in the street, which was not to be numbered in mere
 hundreds, carried him to the hostel gates. &#8220;Don't come any further,
 gentlemen,&#8221; Pig said. &#8220;My brother won't let you make a fool of him the
 way I do. He's a ferocious and serious character. When you meet him
 you'll have to bow deeply to him and call him 'Lord Sun,' then he'll
 look after you. If you don't he'll turn nasty and this business will
 fail.&#8221;</P>
<P>To this the eunuchs and officers replied, &#8220;If your brother really has
 the power to cure our king he'll be given half the country and we will
 all bow to him.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idlers were still making a commotion outside the hostel gates as
 Pig led the eunuchs and officers straight inside, where Monkey could be
 heard laughing with pleasure as he told Friar Sand about how he had
 taken the proclamation down.</P>
<P>Pig went up to him, grabbed him and yelled, &#8220;Why won't you act like a
 man? You said you'd buy me noodles, buns, and steamed bread to lure me
 out, but it was only an empty promise. Then you made a whirlwind, took
 down the royal proclamation, and sneakily put it in my tunic. You made
 a real idiot of me. What kind of brother are you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Idiot,&#8221; laughed Monkey, &#8220;you must have got lost and gone the wrong
 way. I couldn't find you when I rushed back from buying the groceries
 the other side of the drum tower, so I came back ahead. Where did I
 tear any royal proclamations down?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The officials who were guarding it are here,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>Before he had finished speaking the eunuchs and officers came up,
 bowed low and said, &#8220;Lord Sun, His Majesty is very fortunate today as
 Heaven has sent you down to us. We are sure that you will display your
 great skill and give him the benefit of your outstanding medical
 knowledge. If you cure our king you will receive half the country and
 half the state.&#8221; On hearing this Monkey composed his face, took the
 proclamation from Pig and said, &#8220;I suppose you are the officials who
 were guarding the notice.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We slaves are eunuchs in the Bureau of Ritual,&#8221; said the eunuchs,
 kowtowing, &#8220;and these gentlemen are officers in the royal guard.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I did take the royal proclamation down,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;and I used my
 younger brother to bring you here. So your lord is ill. As the saying
 goes, 'Don't sell medicine carelessly, and don't send for any old
 doctor when you're ill.' Tell your king to come here and ask me himself
 to help him. I can get rid of his illness at a touch.&#8221; This shocked all
 the eunuchs.</P>
<P>&#8220;That is very big talk, so you must be a man of great breadth of
 spirit,&#8221; the officers said. &#8220;Half of us will remain here to press the
 invitation in silence while the other half go back to the palace to
 report.&#8221;</P>
<P>Four of the eunuchs and six of the guards officers went straight into
 the palace without waiting to be summoned and said at the steps of the
 throne room, &#8220;Congratulations, Your Majesty.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the king, who was in the middle of a cultivated conversation
 with Sanzang after their meal together, heard this he asked, &#8220;What on?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When we, your slaves, took out Your Majesty's proclamation sending
 for doctors this morning and posted it at the foot of the drum tower, a
 holy monk from Great Tang in the East took it down,&#8221; they replied. &#8220;He
 is now in the Hostel of Meeting and wants Your Majesty to go in person
 to ask his help. He can get rid of illness at a touch. That is why we
 have come to submit this report.&#8221;</P>
<P>This news delighted the king. &#8220;How many distinguished disciples do
 you have, Master of the Law?&#8221; he asked.</P>
<P>Putting his hands together in front of his chest Sanzang replied, &#8220;I
 have three stupid followers.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Which of them is a medical expert?&#8221; the king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;To be frank with Your Majesty,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;they are all
 country bumpkins fit only for carrying baggage, leading the horse,
 finding their way along streams, or leading me over mountains and
 rivers. In dangerous places they can defeat monsters, capture demons,
 and subdue tigers and dragons. None of them knows anything about
 medicines.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Aren't you being too hard on them?&#8221; the king asked. &#8220;It was very
 fortunate that you came to court when we entered the throne hall this
 morning: this was surely destined by Heaven. If your disciple knows
 nothing about medicine why would he have taken down our proclamation
 and demanded that we go to greet him in person? He must surely be a
 great physician.&#8221;</P>
<P>He then called, &#8220;Civilian and military officers, we are much too weak
 to ride in our carriage. You must all leave the palace and go on our
 behalf to invite the Venerable Sun to treat our disease. When you meet
 him you must on no account show him any disrespect. You must address
 him as 'Holy monk, Venerable Sun' and treat him with the deference due
 to your own sovereign.&#8221;</P>
<P>Having received these orders the officials went straight to the
 Hostel of Meeting with the eunuchs and guards officers responsible for
 the proclamation. There they arranged themselves in their companies to
 kowtow to Monkey. Pig was so frightened that he hid in the wing, while
 Friar Sand slipped behind the wall. Just look at the Great Sage sitting
 solemnly and unmoving in the middle of the room.</P>
<P>&#8220;That macaque is really asking to have his head cut off,&#8221; Pig thought
 resentfully. &#8220;All those officials bowing to him, and he's not bowing
 back or standing up either.&#8221;</P>
<P>Soon afterwards, when the rituals had been performed, the officials
 addressed Monkey as if he were their monarch: &#8220;We report to the holy
 monk, the Venerable Sun, that we officials of the Kingdom of Purpuria
 have come at the command of our king to do respectful homage to the
 holy monk and invite him to the palace to treat our sick king.&#8221;</P>
<P>Only then did Brother Monkey stand up and reply, &#8220;Why hasn't your
 king come?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;His Majesty is too weak to ride in his carriage,&#8221; the officials all
 replied, &#8220;which is why he ordered us to pay homage to you, holy monk,
 as if you were our sovereign, kowtow to you and invite you to come.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;will you gentlemen please lead the way.
 I'll follow you.&#8221; The officials then formed themselves into a column in
 accordance with their ranks and set out. Monkey tidied his clothes and
 got to his feet.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;whatever you do, don't drag us in.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I won't,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;provided you two accept the medicine for
 me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What medicine?&#8221; Friar Sand asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;You must accept all the medicine people send me,&#8221; Monkey replied.
 &#8220;I'll collect it when I come back.&#8221; The two of them undertook this
 commission.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey was soon at the palace with the officials, who went in first
 to inform the king. He raised high the curtains of pearls, flashed his
 dragon and phoenix eyes, opened his golden mouth and spoke
 majestically, &#8220;Which gentleman is the holy monk, the Venerable Sun?&#8221;</P>
<P>Taking a step forward, Monkey shouted at the top of his voice, &#8220;I
 am.&#8221;</P>
<P>The voice was so ugly and the face so hideous that the king fell back
 on his dragon throne. In their alarm the female officials and the
 palace eunuchs helped him to the inner quarters.</P>
<P>&#8220;He's terrified His Majesty to death,&#8221; they said.</P>
<P>&#8220;Monk,&#8221; all the officials said angrily to Monkey, &#8220;how could you be
 so rough and crude? Why did you dare take the proclamation down?&#8221;</P>
<P>When Brother Monkey heard this he replied with a smile, &#8220;You
 shouldn't be angry with me. If you're going to be so rude to me your
 king won't get better in a thousand years.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But how long does human life last?&#8221; the officials asked. &#8220;How is it
 that he won't get better even in a thousand years?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He's a sick ruler now,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;When he dies he'll be a sick
 ghost, and whenever he's reincarnated he'll be a sick man again. That's
 why he won't get better even in a thousand years.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've got no sense of respect at all,&#8221; the infuriated officials
 replied. &#8220;How dare you talk such nonsense!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's not nonsense,&#8221; Monkey laughed. &#8220;Listen and I'll explain:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Mysterious indeed are the principles of medicine;</P>
<P>Flexibility of mind is a quality required.</P>
<P>Use eyes and ears, ask questions, take the pulses:</P>
<P>Omit but one and the examination's incomplete.</P>
<P>First look for outward signs of the patient's vital energy.</P>
<P>Dried? Smooth? Fat? Thin? Active? Does he sleep well?</P>
<P>Secondly, listen to whether the voice is clear or harsh:</P>
<P>Determine if the words he speaks are true or crazed.</P>
<P>Third, you must ask how long the disease has lasted,</P>
<P>And how the patient eats, drinks and relieves himself.</P>
<P>Fourth, feel the pulses and be clear about the veins:</P>
<P>Are they deep, shallow, external or inside?</P>
<P>Should I not look and listen, ask questions, and take the pulses,</P>
<P>Never in all his days will the king be well again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In the ranks of the civil and military officials there were some
 fellows of the Royal College of Medicine who when they heard these
 words praised Monkey publicly: &#8220;The monk is right. Even a god or an
 immortal would have to look, listen, ask questions and take the pulses
 before treating a patient successfully with his divine gifts.&#8221;</P>
<P>All the officials agreed with these remarks, then went up to the king
 and submitted: &#8220;The reverend gentleman wishes to look, listen, ask
 questions and take the pulses before he can prescribe properly.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Send him away,&#8221; the king said over and over again as he lay on his
 dragon bed. &#8220;We cannot bear to see any strangers.&#8221;</P>
<P>His attendants then came out from the inner quarters and announced,
 &#8220;Monk, His Majesty commands that you go away. He cannot bear to see a
 stranger.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If he won't see a stranger,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;I know the art of
 taking the pulses with hanging threads.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That is something of which we have only heard,&#8221; exclaimed all the
 officials, concealing their delight, &#8220;but that we have never seen with
 our own eyes. Please go back in and submit another report.&#8221;</P>
<P>The personal attendants then went back into the inner quarters and
 reported, &#8220;Your Majesty, the Venerable Sun can take your pulses with
 hanging threads: he does not need to see Your Majesty's face.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this the king reflected, &#8220;In the three years we have been ill we
 have never tried this technique. Send him in.&#8221;</P>
<P>At once the courtiers in attendance announced, &#8220;His Majesty has
 consented to pulse-taking by the hanging threads. Send the Venerable
 Sun to the inner quarters at once to make his diagnosis.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey then entered the throne hall, where the Tang Priest met him
 with abuse: &#8220;Wretched ape! You will be the death of me!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My good master,&#8221; Monkey replied with a smile, &#8220;I'm bringing you
 credit. How can you say I'll be the death of you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In all the years you've been with me,&#8221; Sanzang shouted, &#8220;I have
 never seen you cure a single person. You know nothing about the nature
 of drugs, and you have never studied medical books. How can you be so
 reckless and bring this disaster on us?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't realize, Master,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile, &#8220;that I do
 know the odd herbal remedy and can treat serious illnesses. I guarantee
 I can cure him. Even if the treatment kills him I'll only be guilty of
 manslaughter through medical incompetence. That's not a capital
 offence. What are you afraid of? There's nothing to worry about,
 nothing. You sit here and see what my pulse diagnosis is like.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you talk all this rubbish,&#8221; Sanzang asked, &#8220;when you have
 never read the<I> Plain Questions,</I> the<I> Classic of Difficulties,</I>
 the<I> Pharmacopoeia</I> and the<I> Mysteries of the Pulses,</I> or
 studied the commentaries to them? How could you possibly diagnose his
 pulses by hanging threads?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've got golden threads on me that you've never seen,&#8221; Monkey
 replied, putting out his hand to pull three hairs from his tail, hold
 them in a bunch, call, &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turn them into three golden
 threads each twenty-four feet long to match the twenty-four periods of
 the solar year. Holding these in his hand he said to the Tang Priest,
 &#8220;These are golden threads, aren't they?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop talking, reverend gentleman,&#8221; said the eunuchs in attendance on
 the king. &#8220;Please come inside and make your diagnosis.&#8221; Taking his
 leave of the Tang Priest Monkey followed the attendants into the inner
 quarters to see his patient. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The heart has a secret prescription that will save a country;</P>
<P>The hidden and wonderful spell gives eternal life.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you do not know what illness was diagnosed or what medicines were
 used and wish to learn the truth listen to the explanation in the next
 installment.</P>

<P></P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="1_0_70">Chapter 69</A></H3>
</I>
<P>The Heart's Master Prepares Medicine in the Night</P>
<P>The Monarch Discusses a Demon at the Banquet</P>
</B>
<P>The story tells how the Great Sage Sun went with the eunuchs in
 attendance on the king to the inner quarters of the palace and stood
 outside the doors of the royal bed-chamber. Handing the three golden
 threads to the eunuchs to take inside he gave them these instructions:</P>
<P>&#8220;Tell the queens and consorts of the inner palace or the eunuchs in
 personal attendance to fasten these threads to His Majesty's left wrist
 at the inch, the bar and the cubit, then pass them out of the window to
 me.&#8221; The eunuchs did as he said, asking the king to sit on his dragon
 bed while they fastened one end of the golden threads to the inch, the
 bar and the cubit and passed the other ends outside.</P>
<P>Monkey took these ends and first held the end of one between the
 thumb and the forefinger of his right hand and felt the pulse at the
 inch point. He held the next against his middle finger and felt the
 pulse at the bar, and then pressed his thumb against his third finger
 and felt the cubit pulse. Next he regulated his own breathing to
 examine the four functions, the five depressions, the seven exterior
 and eight interior symptoms, the nine tempers, the deep pulses within
 the floating ones and the floating ones within the deep ones. He thus
 determined the insufficiencies and excesses of the functioning of
 organs, then told the eunuchs to take the threads off the king's left
 wrist and fasten them to the same points on the right wrist. He felt
 the threads one by one with the fingers of his left hand.</P>
<P>With a shake he put the golden threads back on his body and shouted
 at the top of his voice, &#8220;Your Majesty, the inch pulse on your left
 wrist is strong and tense, the bar pulse is sluggish and tardy, and the
 cubit is hollow and deep. On your right wrist the inch is floating and
 slippery, the bar is slow and knotted, and the cubit is frequent and
 firm. The left inch being strong and tense means that you have an
 internal emptiness and pains in the heart. The left bar being sluggish
 and tardy shows that you sweat and that your muscles feel numb. The
 hollowness and depth of the cubit suggest red urine and bloody stools.
 The floating, slippery inch pulse on the right wrist shows internal
 accumulations and blocked channels. The bar being slow and knotted is
 from indigestion and retained drinking. The frequency and wiriness of
 the cubit shows a chronic opposition of irritable fullness and empty
 coldness. My diagnosis of Your Majesty's ailment is that you are
 suffering from alarm and worry. The condition is the one known as the
 'pair of birds parted.'&#8221;</P>
<P>When the king heard this inside his chamber he was so delighted that
 his spirits revived and he shouted in reply, &#8220;You have understood my
 illness through your fingers. That is indeed my trouble. Please go out
 and fetch some medicine.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey walked slowly out of the inner palace, by when the eunuchs
 watching him had already given the news to everyone. When Monkey
 emerged a moment later the Tang Priest asked him how it had gone. &#8220;I
 made a diagnosis from his pulses,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;I now have to prepare
 the medicine for his condition.&#8221;</P>
<P>All the officials then came forward to ask, &#8220;Holy monk, reverend sir,
 what is the 'pair of birds parted' condition of which you spoke just
 now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's when a cock bird and a hen who were flying together are
 suddenly separated by a violent storm,&#8221; replied Monkey with a smile.
 &#8220;The hen misses the cock and the cock misses the hen. Isn't that 'a
 pair of birds parted?'&#8220; At this the officials all cried out over and
 over again in admiration. &#8220;He really is a holy monk! He really is a
 divine doctor!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You have diagnosed the condition,&#8221; said one of the fellows of the
 Royal College of Medicine, &#8220;but what drugs will you use to treat it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no need to stick to prescriptions,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'll
 choose the drugs when I see them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;According to the medical classic, &#8220;There are 808 varieties of
 medicine and 404 varieties of sickness,'&#8220; said the fellows of the Royal
 College of Medicine. &#8220;How can it be right to use all the medicines when
 one person does not have all the ailments? You can't just choose your
 drugs on sight.&#8221;</P>
<P>To this Monkey replied, &#8220;The ancients said, 'In preparing medicines
 do not stick rigidly to the formulae; use them as appropriate.' That's
 why I've asked for the full range of pharmaceutical materials so that I
 can make adjustments as I need to.&#8221;</P>
<P>The fellows of the Royal College could say no more to this, but went
 out through the palace gates and sent those of the college's staff who
 were on duty to tell all the pharmacies in the city, whether selling
 raw materials or prepared drugs, to send three pounds of each to
 Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is no place for preparing medicine,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;All the
 medicines and a set of pharmacist's utensils must be sent to the Hostel
 of Meeting and handed over to my two fellow disciples.&#8221; The fellows did
 as they were told. Three pounds of each of the 808 ingredients of
 medicine together with pharmacist's rollers, hand-mills, sieves,
 mortars, bowls, pestles and the like were all sent to the hostel,
 handed over and received.</P>
<P>Monkey went back into the throne hall and asked his master to return
 to the hostel with him while he prepared the medicine. Sanzang was just
 getting up to go when the king sent a command from the inner quarters
 that the Master of the Law was to stay behind and spend the night in
 the Hall of Literary Splendor; the next morning, after taking the
 medicine and recovering from his illness, the king would reward them,
 inspect the passport and send them on their way. Sanzang was horrified.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; he said, &#8220;he means to keep me here as a hostage. If he is
 cured he will be happy to send us on our way, but if the treatment
 fails my life is over. You must be very careful and pay full attention
 when preparing the medicine.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry, Master,&#8221; Monkey said with a smile, &#8220;Enjoy yourself
 here. I'm a superb doctor.&#8221;</P>
<P>Taking his leave of Sanzang and of all the officials the splendid
 Great Sage went straight back to the hostel where Pig welcomed him with
 a grin. &#8220;Brother,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I know what you're up to.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;If fetching the scriptures doesn't come off you'll be left without
 any capital to start up a business.&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;Now you've seen how
 prosperous this place is you're planning to open a chemist's shop
 here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't talk nonsense,&#8221; shouted Monkey. &#8220;When I've cured the king I'll
 use my success to leave the court and be on our way. I'm not going to
 be running a chemist's.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;if you're not opening a shop, why get three pounds
 of each of 808 different ingredients to treat one man? How much of it
 will you need? How many years will it take for him to finish the lot?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He'll never finish that much,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;The fellows of their
 Royal College of Medicine are a load of idiots. The only reason why I
 sent for so many ingredients was to baffle them and stop them knowing
 which ones I'm going to use. Then they won't be able to find out what
 my miraculous prescription is.&#8221;</P>
<P>As they were talking two of the hostel staff came in and fell to
 their knees before them to say, &#8220;We beg the holy monks and reverend
 gentlemen to partake of their evening repast.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This morning you treated us rather differently,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;so
 why go on your knees to invite us now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When you first came, my lords,&#8221; the hostel orderlies replied, &#8220;we
 were too blind to recognize your illustrious faces. Now we have heard
 how you are using your outstanding medical powers to treat our king. If
 His Majesty recovers his health he will share the kingdom with you, so
 we'll all be your subjects. So it's only proper for us to kowtow to you
 and to invite you politely to eat.&#8221; On hearing this Monkey cheerfully
 took the place of honour while Pig and Friar Sand sat to his left and
 right.</P>
<P>As the vegetarian meal was served Friar Sand asked, &#8220;Where's our
 master, brother?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The king's kept him as a hostage,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;When the king's
 cured he'll regard us and send us on our way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Is he being well looked after?&#8221; Friar Sand continued.</P>
<P>&#8220;His host's a king,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;so of course he's in luxury.
 When I went there he had three senior ministers looking after him and
 he was invited into the Hall of Literary Splendor.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;the master's still doing much better than
 us. He's got ministers looking after him, and we've only got a couple
 of hostel orderlies to serve us. So I'm going to forget about him and
 eat a good meal.&#8221; Thus the three of them enjoyed their meal at ease.</P>
<P>It was now late. &#8220;Tidy the dishes away,&#8221; Monkey said to the hostel
 orderlies, &#8220;and fetch me plenty of oil and candles. The best time for
 us to make up the medicine will be in the quiet of the night.&#8221;</P>
<P>The orderlies brought oil and candles as instructed and were then
 dismissed. In the still silence of the middle of the night Pig asked,
 &#8220;Brother, what, medicines are we going to make? Let's get on with it. I
 need my shut-eye.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Get an ounce of rhubarb and grind it to a fine powder with a
 roller,&#8221; said Brother Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Rhubarb has a bitter taste and a cold nature and isn't noxious,&#8221;
 said Friar Sand. &#8220;Its nature is deep, not superficial; it's an active
 medicine, not a defensive one. It removes stagnations and clears
 obstructions, settles disorder, and brings about peace, and they call
 it 'the general'. It's a cathartic drug. But perhaps it's wrong for
 someone in an empty, weakened state after a long illness.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's something you don't know, brother,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;This drug
 helps phlegm, makes the vital forces travel smoothly, and calms the
 heat and cold that become congested in the stomach. Just leave me alone
 and fetch me an ounce of croton seeds. Shell them, peel them, hammer
 the poisonous oil out of them, then grind them to a fine powder with a
 roller.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Croton seed is acrid, hot by nature and poisonous,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;It
 cuts away hard accumulations, deals with submerged cold in the lungs
 and bowels, and clears obstructions. It smooths the way for water and
 grain. It's a warrior for storming passes and gates. You must be very
 careful how you use it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;what you don't understand is that this is
 a drug that destroys knots, opens the intestine and can cure swelling
 of the heart and dropsy. Hurry up and get it ready. And I'll want an
 adjuvant to back it up.&#8221;</P>
<P>The two of them started work on grinding the two drugs to a fine
 powder. &#8220;You'll need dozens more, brother,&#8221; they said, &#8220;so which'll
 they be?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's all,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;But you've got three pounds of each of 808 different medicinal
 ingredients,&#8221; Pig said. &#8220;If all you're going to use is two ounces
 you've been making a fool of these people.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey then produced a patterned porcelain dish and said, &#8220;Stop
 talking, brothers. Take this dish and fill it half full with soot
 scraped from a cooking pot.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Whatever for?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I need it for the medicine,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;I never heard of soot
 from a cooking pot being used in medicine,&#8221; said Friar Sand.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's called 'frost on the flowers,'&#8220; said Monkey, &#8220;and it helps
 treat all kinds of illness. Didn't you know that?&#8221; The idiot then
 scraped off half a dishful and ground it up to a fine powder.</P>
<P>Monkey then handed him another dish and said, &#8220;Now fetch me half a
 dishful of our horse's piss.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What for?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;To make the medicine up into pills with.&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand with a smile, &#8220;this is no joking matter.
 Horse piss stinks. You can't use it in medicine. I've only seen vinegar
 paste, old rice paste, refined honey and clean water used for making
 pills. Who ever heard of horse piss used to make pills? It's got a
 terrible stink. Anyone with a weak spleen would throw up at the first
 sniff. If he goes on and takes the rhubarb and croton seeds he'll be
 vomiting at one end and having the runs at the other. That'll be no
 joke.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't know the inside story,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;That horse of ours
 is no ordinary horse. He used to be a dragon in the Western Ocean. If
 he'll give us some of his piss it'll cure any illness you could have.
 My only worry is that he might refuse.&#8221; When Pig heard this he went and
 stood beside the horse, who was lying down asleep. The idiot kicked the
 horse till he got to his feet then pressed himself against the horse's
 stomach for a very long time but without seeing any sign of piss. He
 ran back to Monkey to say, &#8220;Brother, never mind about treating the
 king. Hurry up and cure the horse. He's done for: he's dried right up.
 There's no way we're going to get a drop of piss out of him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll go with you,&#8221; smiled Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll come and have a look too,&#8221; said Friar Sand.</P>
<P>When the three of them reached the horse he started to jump about and
 shout in human language at the top of his voice, &#8220;How can you be so
 ignorant, brother? I used to be a flying dragon in the Western Ocean.
 The Bodhisattva Guanyin saved me after I'd offended against the
 Heavenly Code. She sawed off my horns, removed my scales and turned me
 into a horse to carry the master to the Western Heaven to fetch the
 scriptures. This way I'll be able to redeem my crimes. If I pissed into
 any river I was crossing the fish in the water would drink it and turn
 into dragons. The grass on any mountain we were going over that got a
 taste of it would become magic fungus for immortal boys to gather and
 give themselves eternal life. So of course I can't casually drop it in
 a vulgar, worldly place like this.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Watch your words, brother,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;This is the city of a
 Western king, not some vulgar, worldly place. You wouldn't be casually
 dropping it here. As the saying goes, many hands make light work. We've
 got to cure the king. When we do we'll all be covered in glory. If we
 fail I'm afraid we won't be able to leave this country with any
 credit.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wait a moment,&#8221; the horse finally said. Look at him as he springs
 forward then squats back on his haunches, grinds his teeth noisily and
 only with the greatest strain manages to squeeze out a few drops before
 standing up again.</P>
<P>&#8220;What a deadbeat,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;You could give us a few more even if
 they were drops of gold.&#8221;</P>
<P>Seeing that the dish was now about a third full Monkey said, &#8220;That'll
 do, that'll do. Take it away.&#8221; Only then did Friar Sand feel cheerful.</P>
<P>The three of them then returned to the main hall, mixed the piss with
 the ingredients that had already been prepared, and rolled the mixture
 into three large round balls. &#8220;They're too big, brothers,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;They're only walnut-sized,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;That wouldn't be enough
 for a single mouthful if I were taking them.&#8221; The three disciples then
 put the pills into a large box and went to bed fully dressed.</P>
<P>It was soon dawn, and despite his sickness the king held court,
 asking the Tang Priest to come to see him and sending all his officials
 straight to the Hostel of Meeting to pay their respects to the holy
 monk, the Venerable Sun, and fetch the medicine.</P>
<P>When the officials reached the hostel they prostrated themselves
 before Brother Monkey with the words, &#8220;His Majesty has sent us to pay
 our respects and fetch the miraculous medicine.&#8221; Monkey told Pig to
 fetch the box, which he opened and handed to the officials.</P>
<P>&#8220;What is this medicine called?&#8221; they asked. &#8220;We would like to be able
 to inform His Majesty when we see him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's called Black Gold Elixir,&#8221; Monkey replied, at which Pig and
 Friar Sand had to hide their grins as they thought, &#8220;of course they're
 black gold&#8212;they were made with soot scraped off cooking pots.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What should be taken with the pills to guide them on their way?&#8221; the
 officials asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;There are two kinds of guide that can be taken with them,&#8221; Monkey
 replied. &#8220;One's easily got hold of. That is a decoction of six
 ingredients to be taken as a hot potion.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What six ingredients?&#8221; the officials asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;A fart from a flying crow,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;piss from a carp in a
 fast-flowing stream, some of the face-powder used by the Queen Mother
 of the West, soot from elixir refined in Lord Lao's furnace, three
 pieces of a worn-out head cloth of the Jade Emperor's, and five
 whiskers from a trapped dragon's beard. A decoction of those six
 ingredients taken with the pills would clear up your king's illness
 straight away.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the officials heard this they replied, &#8220;Those are things that
 are not to be found in this world, so please tell us what the other
 guide is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The pills should be taken with rootless water,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;That's very easily got hold of,&#8221; smiled the officials.</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you be so sure?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;We have a saying here,&#8221; the officials replied, &#8220;that if you need
 rootless water you take a bowl or a dish to a well or a stream, fill it
 with water, and hurry back with it. Don't spill a drop, don't look
 behind you, and give it to the patient to take with the medicine.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But well water and stream water both have roots,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;The
 rootless water I'm talking about has to fall from the sky and be drunk
 before it touches the ground. Only then can it be called rootless.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's easily got too,&#8221; the officials said. &#8220;The medicine shouldn't
 be taken till the next cloudy, wet day.&#8221;</P>
<P>The officials then kowtowed to thank Monkey and took the medicine
 back with them to present to the king, who delightedly ordered his
 attendants to bring it to him.</P>
<P>&#8220;What are these pills?&#8221; he asked when he saw them.</P>
<P>&#8220;The holy monk says they are Black Gold Elixir and have to be taken
 with rootless water,&#8221; the officials replied. The king then sent some of
 his palace women to fetch rootless water.</P>
<P>&#8220;The holy monk says that rootless water can't be got from wells or
 streams,&#8221; the officials said. &#8220;It has to be water that has come down
 from the sky and not yet touched the ground.&#8221; The king then ordered his
 aides to issue a decree inviting magicians to summon rain. The
 officials then issued a proclamation as the king had ordered.</P>
<P>Back in the hall of the Hostel of Meeting Brother Monkey said to Pig,
 &#8220;He must be given some rain now so he can take his medicine. This is
 very urgent. How are we going to get some? I reckon he's a very
 virtuous and worthy king, so why don't we help him get a little
 rainwater to take his medicine with?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But how are we going to help him get some rootless water?&#8221; Pig
 asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Stand on my left and be my Sustainer Star,&#8221; Monkey said to him, then
 told Friar Sand, &#8220;stand on my right as my Straightener Star while I
 help him to get some rootless water.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage then paced out a magic pattern and said the
 words of a spell. Soon a dark cloud appeared to their East that came
 closer till it was over their heads. &#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; called a voice from
 it, &#8220;Ao Guang, the Dragon King of the Eastern Sea, is here to call on
 you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I wouldn't have troubled you if it hadn't been important,&#8221; Monkey
 said. &#8220;Could I ask you to help by giving the king here some rootless
 water to take his medicine with?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When you summoned me, Great Sage,&#8221; the dragon king replied, &#8220;you
 said nothing about water. I have only come by myself. I haven't brought
 any rain-making equipment, to say nothing of wind, clouds, thunder and
 lightning. So how can I make it rain?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There'll be no call for wind, clouds, thunder or lightning this
 time,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;and we don't need much rain either. We just need
 enough water for someone to take his medicine with.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case I'll do a couple of sneezes and spit out some saliva,&#8221;
 the dragon king said. &#8220;That ought to be enough for him to take his
 medicine.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Terrific,&#8221; said Monkey, delighted. &#8220;Don't waste a moment. Do it as
 soon as you can.&#8221;</P>
<P>The ancient old dragon gradually brought his dark cloud down till it
 was just over the palace, though he kept himself entirely concealed. He
 spat out a mouthful of saliva that turned into timely rain, whereupon
 all the officials at court exclaimed, &#8220;Ten million congratulations,
 Your Majesty. Heaven is sending down timely rain.&#8221;</P>
<P>The king then ordered, &#8220;Take vessels out to hold the rain. All
 officials, whether inside or outside the palace and irrespective of
 their rank, must gather this sacred water to save our life.&#8221; Just watch
 as all the civil and military officials as well as the consorts,
 concubines, three thousand beauties, and eight hundred charming
 ladies-in-waiting of the three harems and the six compounds of the
 inner palace all stood there holding cups, dishes, bowls and plates to
 catch the timely rain. Up in the sky the ancient dragon so controlled
 his saliva that all of it fell within the palace. After about two hours
 the dragon king took his leave of the Great Sage and went back to the
 sea. When the officials gathered all the cups, dishes, bowls and plates
 together they found that some had caught one or two drops of water,
 some three to five, and some none at all. When it was all put together
 there were a little over three dishes full of it, and this was all
 presented to the king. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The throne hall was filled with exquisite fragrance;</P>
<P>Fine scents were wafting round the Son of Heaven's court.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The king then dismissed the Master of the Law and had the Black Gold
 Elixir and the timely rain carried into the inner quarters, where he
 took the first pill with the first dish of timely rain, then the second
 pill with the second dish. In three efforts he finished all three pills
 and all three dishfuls. Soon afterwards there was a noise from his
 stomach like the endless turning of a windlass. He sent for his chamber
 pot and evacuated four or five times before taking some rice porridge
 and collapsing on his dragon bed. When two of his consorts inspected
 the chamber pot they saw it contained huge amounts of feces and mucus,
 and amid it all a ball of glutinous rice.</P>
<P>&#8220;The root of the disorder has come out,&#8221; the consorts reported, going
 over to the royal bed. The king was very pleased to hear this and ate
 some rice. A little later his chest felt eased and his natural forces
 and blood were in harmonious balance once more. He was full of vigor
 and the strength came back to his legs, so he rose from his bed,
 dressed in his court clothes and went into the throne hall, where he
 greeted the Tang Priest by prostrating himself. The venerable elder
 returned this courtesy as quickly as he could.</P>
<P>When this had been done the king helped Sanzang to his feet with his
 own hands and told his courtiers, &#8220;Write a note at once sending our
 personal and respectful greetings and have an official go to invite the
 three illustrious disciples of the Master of the Law to come here.
 Meanwhile the Eastern hall of the palace is to be opened up and the
 department of foreign relations is to arrange a banquet of
 thanksgiving.&#8221; Having been given these commands the officials carried
 them out. The scribes wrote out the note and the caterers prepared the
 meal. A state is indeed strong enough to overturn a mountain, and
 everything was done in an instant.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Pig saw the officials come to deliver the note he was beside
 himself with delight. &#8220;Brother,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it really must be miracle
 medicine. From the way they're coming to thank you you must have pulled
 it off.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've got it all wrong, brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;As the saying
 goes, 'One man's good fortune affects his whole household.' We two made
 up the pills, so we take a share of the credit. So just enjoy yourself
 and stop talking.&#8221; Hey! Just look at the three brothers as they all
 happily go straight to the palace, where all the officials received
 them and led them to the Eastern hall.</P>
<P>Here they saw the Tang Priest with the king and his ministers and the
 banquet all set out ready. Brother Monkey, Pig and Friar Sand all
 chanted a &#8220;na-a-aw&#8221; of respect to their master, after which the
 officials all came in. In the best place there were set out four tables
 of vegetarian food. It was the sort of banquet at which there are ten
 times as many dishes as you can eat. In front of these tables was one
 of meat dishes, and on this too you could see ten dishes of rare
 delicacies while you ate one. To either side four or five hundred more
 single tables were most neatly set out.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As the ancients had it:</P>
<P>&#8220;A hundred rare delicacies,</P>
<P>A thousand goblets of fine wine,</P>
<P>Rich cream and yogurt,</P>
<P>Fat, red meat like brocade.&#8221;</P>
<P>Precious and many-coloured decorations,</P>
<P>Heavy fragrances of fruit.</P>
<P>Huge sugar dragons coil round sweet lions and immortals:</P>
<P>Ingots of cake draw furnaces escorted by phoenixes.</P>
<P>For meat there was pork and mutton, goose, chicken, duck and fish;</P>
<P>For vegetables, bamboo shoots, beansprouts, fungus and button
 mushrooms.</P>
<P>Delicious noodles in soup,</P>
<P>Translucent creamy sweets,</P>
<P>Succulent millet,</P>
<P>Fresh wild rice congee,</P>
<P>Pungent, tasty soup with rice noodles,</P>
<P>Dishes in which sweetness vied with beauty.</P>
<P>Monarch and subjects raised their cups as the diners took their
 seats;</P>
<P>Officials seated by rank slowly passed the jugs.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Holding a cup in his hand the king first seated the Tang Priest, who
 said, &#8220;As a monk I may not drink liquor.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is alcohol-free wine,&#8221; the king said. &#8220;Could you not drink one
 cup of this, Master of the Law?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But wine is the first prohibition for us monks,&#8221; said Sanzang. The
 king felt awkward.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you may not drink, Master of the Law, how can I congratulate
 you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My three badly-behaved disciples will drink on my behalf,&#8221; Sanzang
 replied. The king then happily passed the golden goblet to Monkey, who
 took it, made a courteous gesture to the assembly, and downed a cupful.
 Seeing how cheerfully he downed it the king offered him another cup.
 Monkey did not decline it but drank again.</P>
<P>&#8220;Have a third goblet,&#8221; said the king with a smile, and Monkey
 accepted and drank for a third time. The king then ordered that the cup
 be refilled and said, &#8220;Have another to make it four for the four
 seasons.&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig, who was standing beside Monkey, had to put up with the saliva
 gurgling inside him as the wine would not come his way; and now that
 the king was pressing Monkey so hard to drink he started to shout,
 &#8220;Your Majesty, that medicine you took owes something to me. Those pills
 include horse&#8212;&#8221; When Monkey heard this he was terrified that the idiot
 was going to give the game away, so he handed Pig the cup. Pig took the
 cup, drank and stopped talking.</P>
<P>&#8220;Holy monk,&#8221; said the king, &#8220;just now you said there was horse in the
 pills. What sort of horse?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This brother of mine has a very loose tongue,&#8221; said Monkey, cutting
 in. &#8220;We've got a really good formula that has been tried and tested,
 and he wants to give it away. The pills Your Majesty took this morning
 included not horse but Aristolochia.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What class of medicine is Aristolochia?&#8221; the king asked. &#8220;What
 conditions can it cure?&#8221;</P>
<P>One of the fellows of the Royal College of Medicine who was standing
 beside the king said, &#8220;Your Majesty,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Aristolochia is bitter, cold and free of poison,</P>
<P>Ends shortness of breath and cures phlegm well,</P>
<P>Circulates the energy, removes blood infections,</P>
<P>Fills emptiness, soothes coughs and eases the heart.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;It was the right thing to use, the right thing to use,&#8221; the king
 said. &#8220;The Venerable Pig must have another cup.&#8221; The idiot said nothing
 more, but downed three goblets. The king then gave three cupfuls to
 Friar Sand, who drank them. Everyone then sat down.</P>
<P>When they all had been feasting and drinking for a long time the king
 raised a large goblet once more and handed it to Monkey. &#8220;Please sit
 down, Your Majesty,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;I've been drinking hard in every
 round. I'd never refuse.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Holy monk,&#8221; the king said, &#8220;we are under a profound debt of
 gratitude to you that we will never be able to repay. Please drain this
 great goblet: we have something to say to you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Say what you will first,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;I'll drink after.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We suffered from that melancholia for years on end,&#8221; the king said,
 &#8220;and one dose of your miraculous pills cured it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When I saw Your Majesty yesterday I realized you were suffering from
 melancholia,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;but I don't know what's getting you down.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's an old saying that a family doesn't talk about its dirt to
 strangers,&#8221; the king replied. &#8220;As you are our benefactor, holy monk, we
 shall tell you, but please don't laugh.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'd never dare,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;Please speak freely.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How many countries did you holy monks come through on your way here
 from the East?&#8221; the king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Five or six,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;What titles do the queens of the other kings have?&#8221; the king went on
 to ask.</P>
<P>&#8220;They're called the queens of the Main Palace, East Palace and West
 Palace,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;We don't use titles like that,&#8221; the king said. &#8220;We call the
 principal queen the Queen of the Sacred Golden Palace, the Eastern
 queen the Queen of the Sacred Jade Palace and the Western queen the
 Queen of the Sacred Silver Palace. But now only the Jade and Silver
 Queen are here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why isn't the Golden Queen in the palace?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;She has been gone for three whole years,&#8221; the king replied in tears.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where did she go?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;At the Dragon-boat Festival three years ago,&#8221; the king said, &#8220;we
 were in the Pomegranate Pavilion of the palace gardens with our queens
 and consorts, unwrapping rice dumplings, putting artemisia out,
 drinking calamus and realgar wine and watching the dragon boats race
 when all of a sudden there was a gust of wind. An evil spirit appeared
 in mid-air. He said he was the Evil Star Matcher who lives in the
 Horndog Cave on Mount Unicorn and was short of a wife. Seeing how
 beautiful and charming our Golden Queen is he wanted her for his wife
 and insisted we should hand her over at once. If we did not do so by
 the time he had asked three times he was going to eat us up first, then
 our officials and all the commoners living in the city. We were so
 concerned over the fate of our country and our people that there was no
 alternative: the Golden Queen had to be pushed outside the pavilion to
 be carried noisily off by the evil spirit. All this gave us such a
 fright that the rice dumpling we were eating turned solid inside us. On
 top of that we have been unable to sleep for worrying, which is why we
 were ill for three years. Since taking you holy monks' miraculous pills
 we have evacuated our bowels three times, and the accumulations from
 three years ago have all been passed. That is why our body now feels
 light and strong and our spirit is restored to what it was. Our life
 has today been given to us by you holy monks; this is a gift more
 weighty than Mount Tai.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Brother Monkey heard this he was very happy indeed and he downed
 the huge goblet of wine in two gulps. &#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; he said with a
 smile to the king, &#8220;so that's what caused your shock and your
 depression. Today you've been lucky: you met me and you were cured. But
 I don't know whether you want the Golden Queen back in the palace.&#8221;</P>
<P>To this the king answered with tears, &#8220;We have been longing for her
 night and day, but nobody has ever been able to catch the evil spirit.
 Of course we want her back in our country.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What if I go to deal with that evil creature for you?&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>The king fell to his knees and replied, &#8220;If you can rescue our queen
 we will gladly take our three queens and nine consorts away from the
 capital and go to live as commoners, leaving the whole kingdom to be
 yours to reign over, holy monk.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Pig, who was sitting beside them, heard all this being said and
 such great honors being done he could not help bursting into noisy
 laughter.</P>
<P>&#8220;This king's got no sense of what's proper,&#8221; he chortled. &#8220;Fancy
 giving up his kingdom and going on his knees to a monk for the sake of
 his old woman.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey hurried forward to help the king back on his feet and ask,
 &#8220;Your Majesty, has the evil spirit been back since he got the Golden
 Queen?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In the fifth month of the year before last,&#8221; the king said, &#8220;he
 carried off the Golden Queen. In the tenth month he came back to demand
 a couple of ladies in waiting to serve her, and we presented him with a
 couple. In the third month of last year he came to demand another
 couple, and two more in the seventh month. Then in the second month of
 this year it was a fourth pair. We do not know when he will be back
 again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If he comes that often you must be terrified of him,&#8221; Monkey
 replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Because he has come so frequently we are afraid of him and of his
 murderous intentions,&#8221; said the king. &#8220;In the fourth month last year we
 ordered the building of a demon shelter, so that whenever we hear the
 wind and know that he's coming we can shelter there with our two queens
 and nine consorts.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Would Your Majesty mind taking me to see the shelter?&#8221; Monkey asked,
 and the king led Monkey by his left hand from the table. All the
 officials rose to their feet.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; protested Pig, &#8220;you're very unreasonable. Why leave this
 royal wine and break up the banquet to go looking at something?&#8221;</P>
<P>Hearing this and realizing that Pig was worried for his stomach the
 king told his attendants to have two tables of vegetarian food brought
 along so that Pig could go on being wined outside the demon shelter.
 Only then did the idiot stop making a fuss and join in with his master
 and Friar Sand saying, &#8220;Let's break up the banquet.&#8221;</P>
<P>As a column of civil and military officials led the way the king and
 Monkey went arm-in-arm through the living quarters of the palace to the
 back of the royal gardens, but there were no great buildings to be
 seen.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where's the demon shelter?&#8221; Monkey asked, and before the words were
 out of his mouth two eunuchs levered open a square flagstone with red
 lacquered crowbars.</P>
<P>&#8220;Here it is,&#8221; said the king. &#8220;Twenty feet or more below us a large
 underground palace hall has been excavated. In it there are four great
 vats of purified oil in which lights burn night and day. When we hear
 the wind we take shelter here and the flagstone is put on again from
 outside.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So the evil spirit doesn't want to kill you,&#8221; said Monkey with a
 smile. &#8220;If he did this would give you no protection.&#8221; Just as he was
 speaking there came the roaring of a wind from due South that made the
 dust fly.</P>
<P>In their alarm all the officials complained, &#8220;That monk has the mouth
 of an oracle. The moment he mentions the evil spirit it turns up.&#8221; The
 panic-stricken monarch abandoned Monkey and scuttled into his
 underground shelter. The Tang Priest went with him, and all the
 officials fled for cover.</P>
<P>Pig and Friar Sand wanted to hide too, but Monkey grabbed one of them
 with each hand and said, &#8220;Don't be afraid, brothers. You and I are
 going to identify him and see what sort of evil spirit he is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;What do we want to identify him for? The
 officials have all hidden and the king's shut himself away. Why don't
 we clear off? What kind of hero are you trying to be?&#8221; But struggle
 though he might the idiot could not break free. When Monkey had been
 holding on to him for some time an evil spirit suddenly appeared in
 mid-air. Just see what it looked like:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A loathsome great body nine feet tall,</P>
<P>Round eyes flashing like lamps of gold.</P>
<P>Two huge ears sticking out as if they were round fans,</P>
<P>Four steel fangs like very long nails.</P>
<P>Red hair curled at his temples; his brows were as flames;</P>
<P>His nose was a hanging trough; his nostrils flared.</P>
<P>His whiskers were strands of cinnabar thread,</P>
<P>And jutting cheekbones shaped his green face.</P>
<P>On red-muscled arms were hands of indigo blue,</P>
<P>And ten sharp claws grasped a spear.</P>
<P>A leopardskin kilt was tied round his waist.</P>
<P>Bare feet and tangled hair completed his fiendish looks.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Friar Sand,&#8221; asked Monkey when he saw the evil spirit, &#8220;can you
 recognize him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I don't know who he is,&#8221; Friar Sand replied. &#8220;I've never seen him
 before.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Pig,&#8221; Monkey next asked, &#8220;do you know?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've never had a cup or a drink with him,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;He's no
 friend or neighbour of mine. How could I know?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He reminds me of the sallow-faced golden-eyed gate keeper ghost
 under the Equal of Heaven of the Eastern Peak.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No he isn't, no he isn't,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;How do you know he isn't?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Because ghosts are spirits of the dark and the underworld,&#8221; Pig
 replied. &#8220;They only come out at night, between five and midnight. It's
 only ten in the morning, and no ghost would ever dare come out now. And
 even if it was a devil it'd never ride a cloud. Ghosts that stir up
 winds make whirlwinds, not gales. Perhaps he's the Evil Star Matcher.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're not such an idiot after all,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;That sounds
 sensible, so you two look after the master while I go to ask him his
 name. That'll help me rescue the Golden Queen and bring her back to the
 palace for the king.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Go if you must,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;but don't tell him anything about
 us.&#8221; Monkey did not deign to answer, but leapt straight up on his magic
 light. Goodness!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>To settle the nation he started by curing the king;</P>
<P>To preserve the Way love and hatred had to go.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know who won the battle that followed when Monkey rose
 up into the sky or how the evil monster was captured and the Golden
 Queen rescued listen to the explanation in the next chapter.</P>

</I>
<P>The Evil Monster's Treasures Emit Smoke,</P>
<P>Sand and Fire Wukong Steals the Golden Bells by Trickery</P>
</B>
<P>The story tells how Brother Monkey summoned up his divine prestige
 and rose up into the air on his magic light, wielding his iron cudgel.
 &#8220;Where are you from, evil monster?&#8221; he asked, shouting in the evil
 spirit's face. &#8220;And where are you going to wreak havoc?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm the vanguard warrior under the Great King Evil Star Matcher from
 Horndog Cave on Mount Unicorn,&#8221; shouted the demon at the top of his
 voice, &#8220;that's who I am. His Majesty has ordered me to fetch two
 ladies-in-waiting to serve Her Majesty the Golden Queen. Who are you
 and how dare you question me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm Sun Wukong, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;I
 was passing through this country while escorting the Tang Priest to
 worship the Buddha in the Western Heaven. Now I know that your gang of
 monsters was oppressing the king I'm going to use my heroic powers to
 bring the country back to order and wipe out this evil. And now you've
 come along to throw your life away just when I didn't know where to
 find you.&#8221; When the monster heard this he foolishly thrust his spear at
 Monkey, who struck back at his face with the iron cudgel. They fought a
 splendid battle up in mid-air:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The cudgel was the sea-settler from the dragon's palace;</P>
<P>The spear was of iron tempered by mankind.</P>
<P>An ordinary weapon was no match for that of an immortal;</P>
<P>In a few clashes its magic powers all drained away.</P>
<P>The Great Sage was an immortal of the Supreme Ultimate;</P>
<P>The spirit was only an evil monster.</P>
<P>How could a demon approach a True One?</P>
<P>In the face of truth the evil would be destroyed.</P>
<P>One stirred up wind and dust to terrify a king;</P>
<P>The other trod on mist and cloud to blot out sun and moon.</P>
<P>When they dropped their guard to try for victory</P>
<P>Neither of them dared to show off.</P>
<P>The Heaven-equaling Great Sage was the abler fighter:</P>
<P>With a loud clash of his cudgel the spear was broken.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When his spear was quickly broken in two by Monkey's iron cudgel the
 evil spirit was in fear for his life, so he turned the wind right round
 and fled Westwards.</P>
<P>Instead of chasing him Monkey brought his cloud down to the entrance
 of the underground demon shelter. &#8220;Master,&#8221; he called, &#8220;you and His
 Majesty can come out now. The monster's run away.&#8221; Only then did the
 Tang Priest come out of the underground shelter, supporting the king.
 The sky was clear, and all traces of the evil spirit had disappeared.</P>
<P>The king went over to the table, filled a golden goblet from the wine
 bottle with his own hands, and presented it to Monkey with the words,
 &#8220;Holy monk, allow us to offer our provisional thanks.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey took the cup, but before he could reply an official came in
 from outside the Western gate of the palace to report, &#8220;The Western
 gate is on fire.&#8221;</P>
<P>As soon as he heard this Monkey threw the wine, cup and all, up into
 the air. The cup fell with a clang. This so alarmed the king that he
 bowed to Monkey with the words, &#8220;Forgive us, holy monk, forgive us. We
 have treated you shabbily. The proper thing would have been to ask you
 into the throne hall to bow to you in thanks. We only offered you the
 wine here because it was to hand. Did you not throw the goblet aside
 because you were offended, holy monk?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Nothing of the sort,&#8221; laughed Monkey, &#8220;nothing of the sort.&#8221;</P>
<P>A moment later another official came in to report, &#8220;There's been a
 miraculous fall of rain. No sooner had the Western gate caught fire
 than a heavy rainstorm put it out. The streets are running with water
 and it all smells of wine.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; said Monkey with another smile, &#8220;you thought I'd
 taken offence when I tossed the cup aside, but you were wrong. When the
 evil spirit fled Westwards I didn't go after him, so he started that
 fire. I just used the goblet to put out the demon's fire and save the
 people outside the Western gate. It didn't mean anything else.&#8221;</P>
<P>The king, even more delighted than before, treated Monkey with still
 greater respect. He invited Sanzang and his three disciples to enter
 the throne hall with him, clearly intending to abdicate in their
 favour.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; said Brother Monkey with a smile, &#8220;the demon who was
 here just now said he was a vanguard warrior under the Evil Star
 Matcher who'd come here to fetch palace girls. Now he's gone back
 beaten he's bound to report that damned monster, who's certain to come
 here to fight me. I'm worried that if he comes here at the head of his
 hordes he'll alarm the common people and terrify Your Majesty. I'd like
 to go out to meet him, capture him in mid-air and bring back your
 queen. But I don't know the way. How far is it to his cave from here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We once sent some of the horsemen and infantry of our night scouts
 to find out what was happening,&#8221; the king replied. &#8220;The return journey
 took them over fifty days. It's over a thousand miles away to the
 South.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Pig, Friar Sand,&#8221; said Monkey on learning this, &#8220;stay on guard here.
 I'm off.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wait another day, holy monk,&#8221; said the king, grabbing hold of him.
 &#8220;Don't go till we have had some dried provisions prepared for you.
 We'll give you silver for the journey and a fast horse too.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're talking as if I'd have to go slogging up mountains and over
 ridges, Your Majesty,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;I tell you truthfully that I
 can do the return journey of a thousand miles each way before a cup of
 wine you've poured out has had time to get cold.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Holy monk,&#8221; the king replied, &#8220;I hope you won't take offence at our
 saying this, but your distinguished features are very much like those
 of an ape. How can you have such magical powers of travel?&#8221; To this
 Monkey replied:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Although my body is the body of an ape,</P>
<P>When young I mastered the paths of life and death.</P>
<P>1 visited all the great teachers who taught me their Way</P>
<P>And trained myself by night and day beside the mountain.</P>
<P>I took heaven as my roof and the earth as my furnace</P>
<P>And used both kinds of drug to complete the sun and moon,</P>
<P>Taking from positive and negative, joining fire and water,</P>
<P>Until suddenly I-was aware of the Mystic Pass.</P>
<P>1 relied entirely on the Dipper for success in my movements,</P>
<P>Shifting my steps by relying on the handle of that constellation.</P>
<P>When the time is right I lower or increase the heat,</P>
<P>Taking out lead and adding mercury, watching them both.</P>
<P>By grouping the Five Elements transformations are made;</P>
<P>Through combining the Four Forms the seasons can be distinguished.</P>
<P>The two vital forces returned to the zodiac;</P>
<P>The three teachings met on the golden elixir road.</P>
<P>When understanding of the laws came to the four limbs</P>
<P>The original somersault was given divine assistance.</P>
<P>With a single bound I could cross the Taihang mountains;</P>
<P>At one go I could fly across the Cloud-touching Ford.</P>
<P>A thousand steep ridges are no bother to me,</P>
<P>Nor hundreds of rivers as great as the Yangtse.</P>
<P>Because my transformations are impossible to stop</P>
<P>I can cover sixty thousand miles in a single leap.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The king was both alarmed and delighted to hear this. He presented a
 cup of royal wine to Monkey with a chuckle and the words, &#8220;Holy monk,
 you have a long and tiring journey ahead of you. Won't you drink this
 wine to help you on your way?&#8221;</P>
<P>All the Great Sage had on his mind was going off to defeat the demon,
 he was not at all interested in drinking. &#8220;Put it down,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I'll
 drink it when I come back.&#8221; No sooner had the splendid Monkey said this
 than he disappeared with a whoosh. We will not describe the amazement
 of the king and his subjects.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Instead we tell how with a single leap Monkey was soon in sight of a
 tall mountain locked in mists. He brought his cloud down till he was
 standing on the summit. When he looked around he saw that it was a fine
 mountain:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Soaring to the heavens, occupying the earth,</P>
<P>Blocking out the sun and making clouds.</P>
<P>Where it soared to the heavens</P>
<P>The towering peak rose high;</P>
<P>In the earth it occupied</P>
<P>Its ranges spread afar.</P>
<P>What blocked the sun</P>
<P>Was the ridge dark with pines;</P>
<P>Where clouds were made</P>
<P>Was among the boulders glistening underneath the scar.</P>
<P>The dark pines</P>
<P>Were green throughout all seasons;</P>
<P>The glistening boulders</P>
<P>Would never change in many a thousand years.</P>
<P>Apes could often be heard howling in the night,</P>
<P>And evil pythons would often cross the deep ravines.</P>
<P>On the mountains birds sang sweetly</P>
<P>While the wild beasts roared.</P>
<P>Mountain roebuck and deer</P>
<P>Moved around in many a pair.</P>
<P>Mountain magpies and crows</P>
<P>Flew in dense flocks.</P>
<P>There was no end of mountain flowers in sight,</P>
<P>While mountain peaches and other fruit gleamed in season.</P>
<P>Steep it was, and the going impossible,</P>
<P>But this was still a place where evil immortals could live in
 retirement.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Great Sage gazed with unbounded delight and was just about to
 look for the entrance to the cave when flames leapt out from a mountain
 hollow. In an instant the red fire blazed to the heavens, and from the
 flames there poured out evil smoke that was even more terrible than the
 fire. What splendid smoke! This is what could be seen:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The fire glared with a myriad golden lamps;</P>
<P>The flames leapt in a thousand crimson rainbows.</P>
<P>The smoke was not a stove chimney's smoke,</P>
<P>Nor the smoke of grass or wood,</P>
<P>But smoke of many colours,</P>
<P>Blue, red, white, black and yellow.</P>
<P>It blackened the columns outside the Southern Gate of Heaven,</P>
<P>Scorched the roofbeams in the Hall of Miraculous Mist.</P>
<P>It burned so hard that</P>
<P>Wild beasts in their dens were cooked through, skins and all,</P>
<P>And the forest birds lost all their plumage.</P>
<P>At the mere sight of this appalling smoke he wondered</P>
<P>How the demon king could be captured in the mountain.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Just as the Great Sage was transfixed with terror a sandstorm burst
 out of the mountain. What magnificent sand! It blotted out the sun and
 the sky. Look:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Swirling masses of it filled the sky,</P>
<P>Dark and turbid as it covered the earth.</P>
<P>The fine grains blinded the people everywhere,</P>
<P>While bigger cinders filled the valleys like rolling sesame seeds.</P>
<P>Immortal boys collecting herbs lost their companions;</P>
<P>Woodmen gathering firewood could not find their way home.</P>
<P>Even if you were holding a bright-shining pearl</P>
<P>It still would have blown too hard for you to see.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey had been so absorbed in enjoying the view that he did not
 notice the sand and cinders flying into his nose till it started
 tickling. Giving two great sneezes he stretched his hand out behind
 him, felt for two pebbles at the foot of a cliff and blocked his
 nostrils with them, then shook himself and turned into a fire-grabbing
 sparrowhawk that flew straight in among the flames and smoke, made a
 few swoops, and at once stopped the sand and cinders and put out the
 fires. He quickly turned back into himself, landed, and looked around
 again. This time he heard a banging and a clanging like a copper gong.</P>
<P>&#8220;I've come the wrong way,&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;This is no den of
 demons. The gong sounds like an official messenger's gong. This must be
 the main road to some country, and that I must be an official messenger
 on his way to deliver some document. I'll go and question him.&#8221;</P>
<P>As Monkey went along what looked like a young demon appeared. He was
 holding a yellow flag, carrying a document on his back and beating a
 gong as he hurried along so fast he was almost flying. &#8220;So this is the
 so-and-so who was beating that gong,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;I wonder what
 document he's delivering. I'll ask him.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage shook himself and turned into a grasshopper
 that lightly flew over and alighted on his document bag. Here Monkey
 could hear the evil spirit talking garrulously to himself as he beat
 the gong. &#8220;Our king is thoroughly vicious. Three years ago he took the
 Golden Queen from the Kingdom of Purpuria, but fate's been against him
 and he hasn't been able to get his hands on her. The poor palace ladies
 he took had to suffer on her behalf. He killed two of them who came,
 then the next four. He demanded them the year before last, last year
 and earlier this year. When he sent for two more this time he found his
 match. The vanguard warrior who went to demand the palace ladies was
 beaten by someone called Sun the Novice or whatever. He didn't get his
 palace girls. It made our king so angry he wants to wage a war on
 Purpuria. He's sent me with this declaration of war. Their king will be
 all right if he doesn't fight, but if he does fight it'll be a disaster
 for him. When our king uses his fire, smoke and sandstorms their king,
 ministers and common people will all die. Then we'll take over their
 city. Our king will be its monarch and we'll be his subjects. But even
 though we'll get official posts it goes against Heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey was very pleased to hear this. &#8220;So there are even some decent
 evil spirits,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;That last remark&#8212;'it goes against
 Heaven'&#8212;was very good. I wonder what he meant when he said that fate
 has been against their king and he hasn't been able to get his hands on
 the Golden Queen. Let me ask him some questions.&#8221; With a whining buzz
 he flew away from the evil spirit to a point some miles ahead of him on
 the road, shook himself and turned into a Taoist boy:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He wore his hair in two bunches</P>
<P>And a robe of a hundred patches.</P>
<P>He beat on a fisherman's drum</P>
<P>As he sang some Taoist snatches.</P>
<P>As Monkey came round the slope towards the little devil he raised his
 hands in greeting and said, &#8220;Where are you going, sir? What official
 document is that you're delivering?&#8221;</P>
<P>The devil seemed to recognize him as he stopped beating his gong,
 returned his greeting and said with a titter, &#8220;Our king's sent me to
 Purpuria with a declaration of war.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Has that woman from Purpuria slept with the king yet?&#8221; Monkey asked,
 pressing on with his questioning.</P>
<P>&#8220;When he brought her here the other year,&#8221; the little devil replied,
 &#8220;an immortal gave the Golden Queen a magic robe as her wedding dress.
 As soon as she put it on she was covered from head to foot with spike.
 Our king didn't dare so much as caress her. Even the slightest touch
 makes his hand hurt. I don't know why it happened. So from that year
 till this he hasn't had her. When his vanguard fighter was sent this
 morning to demand two more palace ladies to serve her he was beaten.
 Our king was so angry he sent me with this declaration of war. He's
 going to fight him tomorrow.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So is the king in a bad mood?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, he's in a bad mood back there,&#8221; said the little devil. &#8220;You
 ought to go and sing him some Taoist songs to cheer him-up.&#8221; The
 splendid Monkey put his arms in his sleeves, ready to go, while the
 evil spirit went on his way beating his gong as before. Monkey then
 turned murderous. He brought out his cudgel, turned round and hit the
 little devil on the back of his head. The unfortunate demon's head was
 smashed to a pulp. The blood gushed out as his skin split open and his
 neck was broken. He was dead. Monkey then put his cudgel away and said
 to himself with regret.</P>
<P>&#8220;I was in too much of a hurry. I never asked him his name. Too bad.&#8221;
 He took the declaration of war from the body and put it in his sleeve.
 Then he hid the yellow flag and the gong in the undergrowth by the path
 and was dragging the body by its ankles to throw it down the ravine
 when he heard something clinking. An ivory tablet inlaid with gold
 could be seen at the demon's waist. The writing on it read:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This is our trusted subordinate Gocome. He is of short stature and
 has a spotty and unbearded face. This tablet is to be kept permanently
 at his waist. Anyone without this tablet is an impostor.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;So the wretch was called Gocome. But after being hit by this cudgel
 of mine he's gone and won't be coming back.&#8221; He then undid the ivory
 tablet, fastened it at his own waist, and was just about to throw the
 body down when he remembered the terrible fire and smoke and decided he
 could not bring himself to look for the cave palace. He raised the
 cudgel, rammed it into the demon's chest, lifted him up into the air
 and went straight back to Purpuria to announce his first success. Watch
 him as he goes whistling back to that country.</P>
<P>Pig was in front of the throne room guarding the king and his master
 when suddenly he turned round to see Monkey carrying the demon through
 the air. &#8220;Hey,&#8221; he complained, &#8220;that was an easy piece of work. If I'd
 known you were going to get him I'd have done it and got the credit.&#8221;
 Before he had finished speaking Monkey brought the cloud down and threw
 the demon at the foot of the steps.</P>
<P>Pig ran over and struck the body with his rake, &#8220;I'll take the credit
 for that,&#8221; he said.</P>
<P>&#8220;You? The credit?&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't try to rob me of it,&#8221; Pig said, &#8220;I've got proof. Can't you see
 the nine holes I made in him with my rake?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;See if he's got a head,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;So he doesn't have a head,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;Now I know why he never
 moved when I hit him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where's the master?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Talking to the king in the throne hall,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;Go and ask him to come out,&#8221; said Monkey, and Pig hurried up into
 the hall.</P>
<P>At Pig's nod Sanzang rose to his feet and came out at once to see
 Monkey, who thrust the declaration of war into his sleeve with the
 words, &#8220;Look after this, Master, and don't let the king see it.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before the words were all out of his mouth the king too came out of
 the hall to greet Monkey and say, &#8220;You're back, holy monk, venerable
 sir. How did the capture of the demon go?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Isn't that a demon at the foot of the steps?&#8221; Monkey asked,
 pointing. &#8220;I killed him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;True,&#8221; said the king, &#8220;it is the body of an evil spirit, but it
 isn't the Evil Star Matcher. We have twice seen the Evil Star Matcher
 with our own eyes. He is eighteen feet tall and nine feet across the
 shoulders. His face shines like gold and his voice is like thunder.
 He's not a miserable little wretch like that.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You Majesty is right,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;this isn't him. It's just a
 little messenger devil I happened to meet. I killed him and brought him
 back as a trophy.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Splendid,&#8221; said the king, who was very pleased indeed, &#8220;splendid.
 This is the first success. We have often sent people out to find out
 what is happening but they never discover anything. Then you just have
 to go out, holy monk, to bring one straight back. You really do have
 divine powers.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Fetch some warm wine,&#8221; he ordered, &#8220;and give it to the reverend
 gentlemen.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Never mind about the wine,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I want to ask Your Majesty
 whether the Golden Queen left any keepsakes when she went. If so, give
 me some.&#8221; The word &#8220;keepsakes&#8221; cut the king to the heart. He could not
 help sobbing aloud with tears pouring down as he replied:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;When we were enjoying the festival that year</P>
<P>The Evil Star Matcher gave a mighty shout,</P>
<P>He took our wife to be his bandit queen;</P>
<P>To save the land we had to send her out.</P>
<P>We had no time for talk or parting words,</P>
<P>Nor could I see her off along her way.</P>
<P>She left no keepsake and no perfume bag;</P>
<P>We would be lonely here until today.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty is here,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;so why upset yourself?&#8221; If the
 queen didn't leave any keepsake there must be some things in the palace
 that she's specially fond of. Give me one of them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you want it for?&#8221; the king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;That demon king's magic powers are quite something,&#8221; said Monkey,
 &#8220;and from what I've seen of his fire, smoke and sand he'll be really
 hard to capture. Even if I do capture him the queen might refuse to
 come back here with a stranger like me. I must have some favorite thing
 of hers so that she'll trust me and let me bring her back. That's why I
 want it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There is a pair of gold bracelets in her dressing room in the
 Sunlight Palace that she used to wear,&#8221; the king replied. &#8220;She only
 took them off that day as it was the Dragonboat Festival and she was
 going to wear multicolored threads instead. She was very fond of those
 bracelets. They have been put away in her dressing table. We have not
 been able to bear the sight of them since she left us: seeing them is
 like seeing her lovely face, and it makes us feel even more ill than
 ever.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Say no more,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and have the bracelets brought here.
 If you can bring yourself to part with them, give me both. If you can't
 I'll take just one.&#8221; The king ordered the Jade Queen to fetch them,
 which she did, handing them to the king.</P>
<P>At the sight of them he called out, &#8220;My beloved and tender-hearted
 queen,&#8221; several times, then handed them to Monkey, who took them and
 put them on his arm.</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage could not stay to drink the celebratory wine,
 but whistled back to Mount Unicorn on his somersault cloud. Now he had
 no interest in the view as he headed straight for the cave palace.
 While he was walking along he heard noisy shouts so he stopped to take
 a careful look around. About five hundred of the soldiers of all ranks
 guarding the entrance to Horndog Cave were</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Drawn up in massed array,</P>
<P>In close order.</P>
<P>Drawn up in massed array they held their weapons</P>
<P>Gleaming in the sun.</P>
<P>In close order they unfurled their banners</P>
<P>That fluttered in the breeze.</P>
<P>Tiger and bear generals did transformations;</P>
<P>Leopard and tiger-cat marshals were full of spirit.</P>
<P>Fiercely savage were the wolves;</P>
<P>The elephants were mighty and imposing.</P>
<P>Crafty hares and water-deer swung sword and halberd;</P>
<P>Great snakes and pythons carried cutlass and bow.</P>
<P>Orangutans that understood human speech</P>
<P>Controlled the formations and gathered intelligence.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Monkey saw this he ventured no closer but went straight back the
 way he had come. Do you know why? Not because he was afraid of them. He
 went back to where he had killed the little devil, recovered the yellow
 flag and the gong, made a hand spell, thought of what he wanted to
 become, faced the wind, shook himself and turned into the likeness of
 Gocome. Then he started hitting the gong as he strode straight back
 towards Horndog Cave.</P>
<P>He was going to look at the layout of the cave when he heard an
 orangutan say, &#8220;You're back, Gocome.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Monkey had to reply.</P>
<P>&#8220;Hurry up,&#8221; the orangutan said. &#8220;Our king is waiting in the Flaying
 Pavilion to hear what you have to report.&#8221; As soon as he heard this
 Monkey hurried straight in through the main gate beating his gong and
 looking around. He saw that rooms and halls had been carved out of the
 beetling crag. On either side bloomed rare and precious flowers, while
 all around stood ancient cypresses and tall pines. Before he realized
 it he was through the inner gate, and suddenly looking up he saw a
 pavilion made light by the eight windows in it. In the pavilion was a
 splendid chair inlaid with gold on which a demon king was sitting
 upright. He was a truly terrifying sight. This is what he looked like:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A shimmering red glow rose from the top of his head;</P>
<P>A mighty and murderous air burst from his chest.</P>
<P>Sharp were the fangs that protruded from his mouth;</P>
<P>Red smoke rose from the scorched hair at his temples.</P>
<P>The bristles of his moustache were like embedded arrows;</P>
<P>His body was covered with hair like brushed-up felt.</P>
<P>Eyes bulged like bells to rival the Evil Star:</P>
<P>Hands held an iron mace like Mahadeva.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Monkey saw the evil spirit he acted towards him in an offhand
 way, showing no trace of respect, but looking away and keeping on
 hitting his gong. &#8220;So you're back, are you?&#8221; said the demon king.
 Monkey did not reply.</P>
<P>&#8220;Gocome,&#8221; the demon king asked again, &#8220;you're back, are you?&#8221; Still
 Monkey did not reply. The demon king then went over to him, grabbed him
 and said, &#8220;Why are you still beating your gong now you're back home?
 And why don't you answer when I ask you a question?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean by your 'Why? Why? Why?'&#8220; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;I told you I didn't want to go but you insisted. When I got there I
 saw huge numbers of foot soldiers and cavalry drawn up in order of
 battle. As soon as I was spotted they shouted, 'Seize the demon! Seize
 the demon!' They pushed and shoved and dragged and carried me into the
 city, where I saw their king. He told them to cut my head off, but
 luckily his two groups of advisers said that in international conflicts
 envoys should not be executed, so I was spared. They took the
 declaration of war, marched me out of the city, gave me thirty strokes
 in front of their army, and let me come back here to report. Before
 long they'll be here to fight you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In other words,&#8221; the monster said, &#8220;you had a bad time. I don't
 blame you for refusing to answer when I asked you those questions.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It wasn't that,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;The reason I didn't answer was
 because of the pain.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How strong are their forces?&#8221; the demon king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I was reeling from shock and too badly frightened by the beating to
 be able to count them,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;All I could see were masses of
 weapons drawn up there:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Bows and arrows, spears and sabers, suits of armor,</P>
<P>Dagger-axes, halberds, swords and tasseled banners.</P>
<P>Pikes, partisans, helmets,</P>
<P>Axes, round shields, and iron caltrops.</P>
<P>Long staves,</P>
<P>Short cudgels,</P>
<P>Steel forks, cannons and casques.</P>
<P>They were wearing tall boots, hats and quilted jackets,</P>
<P>And carrying cudgels, small pellet-bows and maces of bronze.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's neither here nor there,&#8221; laughed the demon king when he heard
 this. &#8220;Weapons like that can be finished off in a single blaze. Go and
 tell the Golden Queen all about it and ask her not to upset herself.
 Ever since she heard me lose my temper this morning and decide to go to
 war she's been crying her eyes out. Tell her that their army is so
 fierce and brave that they're bound to beat us. That'll calm her down
 for a while.&#8221;</P>
<P>This delighted Monkey, who thought, &#8220;Just what I want.&#8221; Watch him as
 he goes the way he knows, through the side door and across the hall.
 Inside there were tall buildings: it was not like outside. He went
 straight to the women's quarters at the back, where he saw from a
 distance a handsome and decorated doorway. That was where the Golden
 Queen lived. When he went to see her there were two groups of fox and
 deer spirits dressed like beautiful women to wait on her. The queen sat
 in the middle with her fragrant cheeks in her hands and tears pouring
 from both of her eyes. Indeed, she had</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A beautiful face so soft and charming,</P>
<P>A bewitching countenance so fair.</P>
<P>But her raven-black hair was uncombed</P>
<P>And piled untidily on her head;</P>
<P>She did not want to dress up</P>
<P>And wore no hair ornaments or rings.</P>
<P>Her face was unpowdered,</P>
<P>And she wore no rouge.</P>
<P>Her hair was not oiled</P>
<P>But all in a tangle.</P>
<P>She pouted her cherry lips,</P>
<P>Ground her silver teeth,</P>
<P>Frowned with her brows like moth antennae,</P>
<P>And let her eyes sparkle with tears.</P>
<P>All her heart</P>
<P>Was filled with memories of Purpuria's king;</P>
<P>All the time</P>
<P>She longed to escape from the net that held her.</P>
<P>Truly,</P>
<P>Ill-fated have been many lovely ladies</P>
<P>Left in their wordless grief to face the Eastern wind.</P>
<P>Monkey went up to her and greeted her with a &#8220;Hello.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;You impudent boorish freak,&#8221; said the queen. &#8220;I remember how when I
 was living in splendor with my king in Purpuria even the king's tutor
 and the prime minister had to prostrate themselves in the dust when
 they met me: they would never have dared look me in the face. How dare
 you say 'Hello' to me, you lout? Where are you from, you coarse beast?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please don't be angry, ma'am,&#8221; the serving women said. &#8220;He's one of
 His Majesty's most trusted lieutenants. His name is Gocome. He was the
 one who was sent with the declaration of war this morning.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this the queen controlled her temper and asked, &#8220;Did you go inside
 Purpuria when you delivered the declaration?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I took it straight to the capital and right into the throne hall,&#8221;
 said Monkey. &#8220;I saw the king himself and got an answer from him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What did the king say when you saw him?&#8221; the queen asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I have already told His Majesty here what he said about war and
 about the dispositions of their forces,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;But there was
 also a private message from the king, who misses you, ma'am. There's
 something private I have come to report to you, but with all these
 attendants around this is no place to talk.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the queen heard this she dismissed her foxes and deer. Brother
 Monkey shut the door of the palace, rubbed his face, and turned back
 into himself. &#8220;Don't be afraid of me,&#8221; he said to her. &#8220;I'm a monk sent
 by the Great Tang in the East to see the Buddha and fetch the
 scriptures at the Thunder Monastery in India. My master is Tang
 Sanzang, the younger brother of the Tang Emperor. I'm Sun Wukong, his
 senior disciple. When we were in your capital to present our passport
 for approval I saw a notice calling for doctors that your king and his
 ministers had posted. Then I used my medical skills to cure the illness
 he had contracted from missing you. When we were drinking at the
 banquet he gave to thank me he told me that you had been carried off by
 the evil spirit. As I can subdue dragons and tigers I was specially
 invited to capture the demon, rescue you and take you back to your
 country. I was the one who defeated the vanguard and killed the little
 devil. When I saw from outside the gates how ferocious the demon king
 was I turned myself into Gocome's double and came here to bring you a
 message.&#8221;</P>
<P>The queen said nothing when she heard this. Then Monkey produced the
 bracelets and presented them to her with both hands.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you don't believe me, just look; where did these come from?&#8221; he
 asked.</P>
<P>As soon as she saw them the queen burst into tears, came down from
 where she was sitting, bowed to him in thanks and said, &#8220;Reverend sir,
 if you really can save me and get me back to court I will remember my
 deep debt of gratitude to you even when I'm old and toothless.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Let me ask you something,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;What treasure does he use
 to produce that fire, smoke and sand?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's no treasure,&#8221; the queen said, &#8220;just three golden bells. As soon
 as he shakes the first one three thousand feet of burning flames shoot
 out. When he shakes the second one a three-thousand-foot column of
 smoke gushes out to kipper people. And when he shakes it the third time
 a blinding three-thousand-foot sandstorm blows up. The fire and smoke
 are nothing much, but the sand is lethal. If it gets up your nostrils
 it can kill you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's terrible,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;terrible. I've experienced it and I
 had to sneeze a couple of times. I wonder where he keeps the bells.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He never puts them down,&#8221; the queen replied. &#8220;He keeps them at his
 waist whether he's going somewhere, staying at home, sitting down or
 sleeping. They are always with him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you still care for Purpuria and want to see your king again you
 must forget about your distress and grief for the moment,&#8221; said Monkey.
 &#8220;Make yourself look attractive and happy. Talk to him like a loving
 wife and get him to give you the bells to look after. When I've stolen
 them and defeated the monster I'll take you back to be reunited with
 your royal husband so that you can live in peace together.&#8221;</P>
<P>The queen did as Monkey said while he turned himself back into the
 demon king's trusted lieutenant, opened the doors again and called the
 serving women back in. &#8220;Go to the pavilion at the front, Gocome,&#8221; the
 queen said, &#8220;and ask His Majesty to come here as I've something to say
 to him.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Monkey assented and went to the Flaying Pavilion, where
 he said to the evil spirit, &#8220;Your Majesty, Her Majesty would like to
 see you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;All she usually does is curse me, so why is she sending for me now?&#8221;
 the demon king happily asked. &#8220;When she asked me about the king of
 Purpuria I told her, 'He doesn't want you any more: he's got a new
 queen now.' When she heard that Her Majesty stopped missing him. That's
 why she sent me out with this invitation.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're very able,&#8221; the demon king said, &#8220;and when we've destroyed
 Purpuria I'll make you my high chancellor in personal attendance.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey thanked the demon king for his kindness and hurried to the
 door of the living quarters at the back, where the queen greeted him
 with happy smiles and her hands on his arms. The king stepped back with
 an awkward noise.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't,&#8221; he said, &#8220;don't. I'm very grateful for this sign of your
 affection, ma'am, but I don't dare stand next to you in case it hurts
 my hand.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Sit down, Your Majesty,&#8221; the queen said. &#8220;I have something to say to
 you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no objection to you speaking,&#8221; the demon king replied. &#8220;I'm
 very much obliged to Your Majesty for condescending to love me,&#8221; she
 said. &#8220;For three years now you have not shared my pillow although we
 were fated from our earlier lives to be married. I never expected that
 Your Majesty would treat me as a stranger instead of your wife. I
 remember that when I was queen of Purpuria the king gave all the
 valuable tribute from foreign countries to the queen to look after when
 he had seen it. But you have no treasures here. The servants wear
 marten hides and feed on blood. I have seen no fine silks, brocades,
 gold or pearls here. All the covers and blankets are of skins and felt.
 Or perhaps you do have some treasures that you won't let me see or look
 after because you regard me as a stranger. They say you have three
 bells. I think they must be treasures. Why do you always keep them with
 you, even when you're travelling or sitting down? There's no reason why
 you shouldn't give them to me to look after. I can give them to you
 when you need them. That would be one way of being a wife to you and it
 would show that we trust each other in our hearts. The only reason why
 you don't do this must because you regard me as an outsider.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this the demon king burst into loud laughter, then bowed to her
 and said, &#8220;Ma'am, you're justified in your complaint. Here are the
 treasures, and today I'm giving them to you to look after.&#8221; He undid
 his clothing to bring them out. Monkey watched with unwavering eyes as
 the monster pulled two or three layers of clothing aside to bring out
 the three bells that he carried next to his skin.</P>
<P>Putting cotton-wool in to muffle them he wrapped them up in a piece
 of leopard skin and handed them to the queen with the words, &#8220;They're
 nothing, but please look after them very carefully. Whatever you do
 don't shake them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; the queen replied as she accepted them. &#8220;I shall keep
 them on my dressing table and nobody will move them at all.&#8221; Then she
 gave these orders: &#8220;My little ones, lay on a banquet. His Majesty and I
 are going to have a few drinks to celebrate our happy union.&#8221; At once
 the serving women brought in fruit, vegetables and the flesh of water
 deer, raccoon-dogs, deer and hare and poured out coconut toddy that
 they offered them. The queen made herself so bewitchingly attractive
 that she swept the evil spirit off his feet.</P>
<P>Monkey meanwhile went to fetch the bells. Feeling and groping, he
 found his way to the dressing-table, gently took the three bells, crept
 out through the doors of the inner quarters and left the cave palace.
 When he reached the Flaying Pavilion there was nobody about, so he
 opened the leopard-skin wrapper to have a look. One of the bells was as
 big as a teacup and the other two the size of fists. With reckless
 folly he tore the cottonwool apart. There was a loud clang and smoke,
 fire and sand came gushing out. Desperately Monkey tried to stop them
 but could do nothing. The pavilion was by now ablaze, sending the evil
 spirits on the gates all crowding in alarm inside the inner quarters.</P>
<P>&#8220;Put the fire out,&#8221; said the demon king, who was badly rattled. As he
 rushed out to look he saw that Gocome had taken the golden bells, went
 up to him and shouted, &#8220;Dirty slave! Why did you steal my precious
 golden bells? What sort of nonsense are you up to? Arrest him!&#8221; The
 tiger and bear generals, the leopard and tiger-cat marshals, the
 elephants, gray wolves, cunning water deer, crafty hares, long snakes,
 great pythons, orangutans and all the other troops on the gates rushed
 him in a crowd.</P>
<P>Monkey was thrown into panic. Dropping the golden bells he turned
 back into himself, pulled out his gold-banded As-You-Will cudgel, went
 and charged at them, going through his cudgel routines and lashing out
 wildly. The demon king took his treasures back and ordered, &#8220;Shut the
 main gates.&#8221; At this some of the demons shut the gates and others went
 into battle. Unable to get away, Monkey put his cudgel away, shook
 himself and turned into a silly fly that attached itself to a spot on
 the stone wall which was not burning. None of the demons could find
 him. &#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; they reported, &#8220;the thief's got away, the thief's
 got away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Did he get out through the gates?&#8221; the demon king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The front gates are firmly locked and bolted,&#8221; the demons replied.
 &#8220;He can't have got out through them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Make a careful search,&#8221; said the demon king, and while some of them
 fetched water to douse the fire the others made a close search but
 found no trace of him.</P>
<P>&#8220;What sort of thief is he?&#8221; the demon king asked with fury. &#8220;He's got
 a hell of a nerve, turning himself into Gocome's double, coming in here
 to report back to me, then staying with me till he found a chance to
 steal my treasures. It's luck he didn't take them out, if he'd taken
 them over the mountain top and there had been a heavenly wind it would
 have been a disaster.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty's good fortune is divine,&#8221; said the tiger general,
 stepping forward. &#8220;It was because our luck has not yet run out that he
 was discovered.&#8221;</P>
<P>Then the bear marshal came forward to say, &#8220;Your Majesty, the thief
 was none other than the Sun Wukong who beat our vanguard warrior. I
 think he must have run into Gocome when he was on his way, killed him,
 taken his yellow flag, gong and ivory tablet, and turned into his
 double to come here and deceive Your Majesty.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; the demon king replied, &#8220;you're clearly right. Little
 ones,&#8221; he ordered, &#8220;make another careful search and be on your guard.
 Whatever you do, don't open the gates and let him out.&#8221; It is rightly
 said that</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>By being too clever one becomes a fool;</P>
<P>What was once a joke can turn out to be real.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know how Brother Monkey got out through the demons'
 gates, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story tells how the Evil Star Matcher had the front and back
 gates tightly closed while Monkey was hunted for. The din went on till
 dusk, but no sign of him did they find. The demon king sat in the
 Flaying Pavilion, where he called his demons together and issued orders
 to the guards on all the gates to carry bells, shout passwords, beat
 drums and strike clappers. Everyone was to have an arrow on his
 bowstring or a sword unsheathed as he took his turn to keep watch
 during the night. Sun Wukong, who had turned into a fly, was sitting by
 the gates. Seeing how strict the security was at the front gates he
 spread his wings and flew to the gateway of the living quarters to take
 a look. He saw the Golden Queen slumped across a low table, the tears
 flowing down as she wept quietly in her sorrow, so he flew inside and
 landed lightly on the loose black clouds of her hair to listen to what
 she was crying about. A moment later she said tearfully, &#8220;My lord, you
 and I,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Burnt in an earlier life the incense of separation,</P>
<P>And now I have encountered an evil demon king.</P>
<P>For three years I have been gone: when will we two be reunited?</P>
<P>Great is the grief of mandarin ducks that are parted.</P>
<P>Just when the priest had brought me your message</P>
<P>Our union has been severed once more and the monkey is dead.</P>
<P>Because he was too curious about the golden bells</P>
<P>I long for you now more desperately than ever.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When he heard this Monkey went behind her ear, where he whispered,
 &#8220;Don't be afraid, Your Majesty. I'm the holy monk, the venerable Sun
 Wukong, who was sent from your country. I'm still alive. It was all
 because I was too impatient. I went to your dressing table and stole
 the golden bells. While you were drinking with the demon king I sneaked
 out to the pavilion in the front, but I couldn't restrain myself from
 opening them up to take a look at them. I didn't mean to, but I tore
 the cotton wool muffling the bells, and the moment they rang flame,
 smoke and sand came gushing out. I panicked, threw the bells down,
 turned back into myself, and tried hard to fight my way out with my
 iron cudgel. When I failed and was scared they'd kill me I turned into
 a fly, and hid on the door pivot till just now. The demon king has made
 the security precautions even stricter and he won't open the doors.
 Will you act like a wife to him and lure him in here to sleep so that I
 can escape and find some other way of rescuing you?&#8221;</P>
<P>When the queen heard this she shivered and shook, and her hair stood
 on end as if a spirit were pulling it; she was terrified, as if her
 heart was being pounded by a pestle. &#8220;Are you a man or a ghost?&#8221; she
 asked, the tears streaming down.</P>
<P>&#8220;Neither man nor ghost,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;At the moment I've turned into
 a fly and I'm here. Don't be afraid. Hurry up and ask the demon king
 here.&#8221; The queen still refused to believe him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop appearing in this nightmare,&#8221; she said in a low voice through
 her tears.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm not in a nightmare,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;If you don't believe me put
 your hand out and open it. I'll jump down into it for you to see.&#8221; The
 queen then put out her open hand. Monkey flew down and landed lightly
 on her jade palm. He was just like</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A black bean on a lotus flower,</P>
<P>A bee resting on a peony blossom,</P>
<P>A raisin fallen into a hydrangea,</P>
<P>A black spot on a wild lily stalk.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The queen raised her hand and said, &#8220;Holy monk.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm the holy monk transformed,&#8221; Monkey replied. Only then did the
 queen believe him.</P>
<P>&#8220;When I invite the demon king here what are you going to do?&#8221; she
 asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;There's an old saying that there's nothing like liquor for ending a
 life,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and another that there's nothing like liquor
 for solving any problem. Liquor's very useful stuff. The best thing is
 to give him plenty to drink. Call one of your personal slave-girls in
 and let me have a look at her so I can make myself look like her and
 wait on you. Then I'll be able to make my move.&#8221;</P>
<P>The queen did as he told her. &#8220;Spring Beauty, where are you?&#8221; she
 called, and a fox with a beautiful face came in round the screen, knelt
 down and said, &#8220;What orders did Your Majesty call me in to receive?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Tell them to come in and light the silk lanterns, burn some musk,
 and help me into the front room,&#8221; the queen said. &#8220;Then I shall ask His
 Majesty to bed.&#8221; Spring Beauty went to the front and called seven or
 eight deer and fox spirits who lined up on either side of her. They
 carried two pairs of lanterns and one pair of portable incense-burners.
 By the time the queen bowed to them with her hands together the Great
 Sage had already flown off.</P>
<P>Spreading his wings, the splendid Monkey flew straight to the top of
 Spring Beauty's head, where he pulled out one of his hairs, blew a
 magic breath on it, and called, &#8220;Change!&#8221; It turned into a sleep insect
 that landed lightly on Spring Beauty's face. Now when sleep insects
 reach a human face they crawl into the nostrils, and once they are
 inside the person goes to sleep. Spring Beauty did indeed start feeling
 sleepy. She could not keep on her feet, but swayed about and felt dozy
 as she hurried to where she had been resting before, collapsed head
 first and fell into a deep sleep. Brother Monkey then jumped down,
 shook himself, turned into Spring Beauty's exact likeness and went back
 round the screen to line up with the others.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As the Golden Queen walked into the front part of the palace a little
 devil saw her and reported to the Evil Star Matcher, &#8220;The queen's here,
 Your Majesty.&#8221; The demon king hurried out of the Flaying Pavilion to
 greet her.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; the queen said, &#8220;the smoke and fire have been put out
 and there's no sign of the thief. As it's late now I've come to urge
 you to come to bed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How considerate you are, my queen,&#8221; the monster replied utterly
 delighted to see her. &#8220;The thief was Sun Wukong who defeated my
 vanguard warrior, then killed my lieutenant and came here disguised as
 him to fool us. We've searched but can't find a trace of him. It makes
 me feel uneasy.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The wretch must have got away,&#8221; the queen replied. &#8220;Relax, Your
 Majesty, stop worrying, and come to bed.&#8221;</P>
<P>Seeing the queen standing there and inviting him so earnestly the
 demon king could not refuse too insistently, so he told the other
 demons to be careful with the fires and lamps and be on their guard
 against robbers before he went to the living quarters at the back with
 the queen. Monkey, disguised as Spring Beauty, led their way with the
 other slave girls.</P>
<P>&#8220;Bring wine for His Majesty,&#8221; the queen said. &#8220;He's exhausted.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Indeed I am,&#8221; said the demon king with a smile, &#8220;indeed I am. Fetch
 some at once. It'll calm our nerves.&#8221; The imitation Spring Beauty and
 the other servants then laid out fruit and high meat and set a table
 and chairs. The queen raised a cup and the demon king did likewise;
 each gave the other a drink from their own.</P>
<P>The imitation Spring Beauty, who was standing beside them, said as
 she held the jug, &#8220;As tonight is the first time Your Majesties have
 given each other a drink from your own cups I hope that you will each
 drain them dry for double happiness.&#8221; They did indeed both refill their
 cups and drain them again. &#8220;As this is so happy an occasion for Your
 Majesties why don't we slave girls sing and dance for you?&#8221; the
 imitation Spring Beauty suggested.</P>
<P>Before the words were all out of her mouth melodious voices could be
 heard as the singing and dancing began. The two of them drank a lot
 more before the queen called for the singing and dancing to end. The
 slave girls divided themselves into their groups and went to line up
 outside the screen, leaving only the imitation Spring Beauty to hold
 the jug and serve them wine. The queen and the demon king spoke to each
 other like husband and wife, and the queen was so full of sensuality
 that the demon king's bones turned soft and his sinews went numb. The
 only trouble was that the poor demon was not lucky enough to enjoy her
 favours. Indeed, it was a case of &#8220;happiness over nothing, like a cat
 biting a piss bubble.&#8221;</P>
<P>After talking and laughing for a while the queen asked, &#8220;Were the
 treasures damaged, Your Majesty?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Those are treasures that were cast long, long ago,&#8221; the demon king
 said, &#8220;so they couldn't possibly be damaged. All that happened was that
 the thief tore the cotton wool that was muffling the bells and the
 leopard skin wrapper was burnt.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where have they been put away?&#8221; the queen asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;No need for that,&#8221; the demon king replied. &#8220;I carry them at my
 waist.&#8221; Hearing this, the imitation Spring Beauty pulled out a handful
 of his hairs, chewed them up into little bits, crept closer to the
 demon king, put the pieces of hair on the demon's body, blew three
 magic breaths, said &#8220;Change!&#8221; very quietly, and turned the pieces of
 hair into three revolting pests: lice, fleas and bedbugs. They all made
 for the demon king's body and started biting his skin wildly. Itching
 unbearably, the demon king put his hands inside his clothing to rub the
 irritation. He caught a few of the lice between his fingers and took
 them to a lamp for a closer look.</P>
<P>When the queen saw them she said mockingly, &#8220;Your Majesty, your shirt
 must be filthy. It can't have been washed for ages. I expect that's why
 they're there.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've never had insects like these before,&#8221; he said in embarrassment.
 &#8220;I would have to make a fool of myself tonight.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean, making a fool of yourself, Your Majesty?&#8221; the
 queen said with a smile. &#8220;As the saying goes, even the emperor has
 three imperial lice. Undress and I'll catch them for you.&#8221; The demon
 king really did undo his belt and take his clothes off.</P>
<P>The imitation Spring Beauty was standing beside the demon king
 looking closely at the fleas leaping around between each layer of
 clothing, on which were rows of enormous bedbugs. Lice and nits were
 crowded as closely together as ants coming out of their nest. When the
 demon king took off the third layer of clothing and revealed his flesh
 the golden bells were also swarming with countless insects.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; said the imitation Spring Beauty, &#8220;hand me the bells
 so that I can catch the lice on them for you.&#8221; The demon king was so
 overcome with shame and alarm that he handed the three bells to Spring
 Beauty, not noticing that she was an impostor.</P>
<P>The imitation Spring Beauty took the bells and made a long show of
 catching lice. When she saw the demon king looking down to shake his
 clothes she hid the golden bells, pulled out a hair and turned it into
 three more bells just like the originals that she carried to the lamp
 to examine.</P>
<P>She then wriggled, braced herself, put the lice, bedbugs and fleas
 back on her body and returned the imitation bells to the monster. He
 took them but was still too befuddled to see that they were copies.
 Passing them with both his hands to the queen he said, &#8220;Put them away
 now, but be very careful with them, not like before.&#8221; The queen took
 the bells, quietly opened the chest, put them inside, and locked them
 in with a golden lock. Then she drank several more cups of wine with
 the demon king.</P>
<P>&#8220;Dust and clean the ivory bed,&#8221; she ordered the serving women, &#8220;and
 spread the brocade quilt. His Majesty and I are going to bed.&#8221;</P>
<P>The demon king expressed his thanks but said, &#8220;I have no such luck. I
 don't dare go with you. I'll take one of the palace women with me and
 go to bed in the Western part of the palace. I wish you a good night by
 yourself, ma'am.&#8221; With that each of them went to bed, and we will say
 no more of that.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Meanwhile the successful imitation Spring Beauty tucked the treasures
 into her belt and turned back into Monkey. He shook himself, took back
 the sleep insect, and headed for the front of the palace, where
 nightsticks and bells sounded together to mark the third watch.
 Splendid Monkey made himself invisible by making a spell with his hands
 and saying the words of it. Going straight to the gates he saw that
 they were very firmly locked and bolted, so he brought out his
 gold-banded cudgel, pointed it at the door and made unlocking magic.
 The gates swung easily open.</P>
<P>Hurrying outside he stood by the gates and shouted two or three times
 at the top of his voice, &#8220;Evil Star Matcher, give us back our Golden
 Queen.&#8221;</P>
<P>This startled all the devils, who hurried to look and saw that the
 gates were open. Quickly they fetched lamps to find the locks and
 fasten the gates once more. Several of them were sent running back
 inside to report, &#8220;Your Majesty, there's someone outside the main gates
 shouting your title and demanding the Golden Queen.&#8221;</P>
<P>The slave girls hurried out to say very quietly, &#8220;Stop yelling. His
 Majesty's only just gone to sleep.&#8221; Monkey gave another loud shout at
 the front gates, but the little devils still dared not disturb their
 master. This happened three or four times over, but they never went in
 to report. The Great Sage kept up his din till daybreak, by when his
 patience was exhausted and he swung his iron cudgel to hit the gates.
 This so alarmed the demons big and small that while some of them
 barricaded the gates the others went in to report.</P>
<P>As soon as the demon king woke up and heard the cacophonous din he
 got up, dressed and emerged from his bed-curtains to ask, &#8220;What's all
 the shouting about?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; said the kneeling slave girls, &#8220;someone's been shouting and
 cursing outside the cave half the night. We don't know who it is. Now
 he's attacking the gates.&#8221;</P>
<P>As the demon king went out through the gates of the palace several
 panic-stricken little devils appeared to kowtow to him and say,
 &#8220;There's someone shouting and cursing outside. He's demanding the
 Golden Queen, and if we say so much as half a 'no' he goes on and on at
 us, swearing in a thoroughly horrible way. When Your Majesty still
 hadn't come out at daybreak he got so desperate he started attacking
 the gates.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't open them,&#8221; the demon king said. &#8220;Go and ask him where he's
 from and what he's called. Report back as quickly as you can.&#8221;</P>
<P>The little devils hurried off to ask through the gates, &#8220;Who are you,
 knocking at our gates?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm your grandpa sent by Purpuria to take the Golden Queen back to
 her own country,&#8221; Monkey replied. When the little devils heard this
 they reported it to the demon king, who went back to the living
 quarters at the back to question the queen about why the attacker had
 come.</P>
<P>The queen had only just arisen and had not yet done her hair or
 washed when slave girls came in to report, &#8220;His Majesty's here.&#8221; The
 queen hastily tidied up her clothes and let her black tresses hang
 loose as she went outside to greet him.</P>
<P>He had just sat down and had not yet asked her any questions when
 little demons were heard again asking, &#8220;The Grand Par from over there
 has smashed the gates down.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How many officers are there in your country, ma'am?&#8221; The demon king
 asked with a smile.</P>
<P>&#8220;Inside the palace there are forty-eight brigades of horse and foot,
 and a thousand good officers; and there are ever so many marshals and
 commanders on the frontiers,&#8221; the queen replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Are any called Grand Par?&#8221; the demon king asked. &#8220;When I was in the
 palace all I knew about was helping His Majesty in the inner quarters
 and instructing the consorts and concubines every morning and evening,&#8221;
 the queen said. &#8220;There were no end of things happening outside. How
 could I possibly remember the names?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This one calls himself Grand Par,&#8221; the demon king replied. &#8220;There's
 no such name I can think of in the book<I> The Hundred Surnames.</I>
 You're a very intelligent and well-born lady, ma'am, and you've lived
 in a royal palace. You must have read a lot of books. Can you remember
 coming across that name in any of them?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's a passage in the<I> Thousand Word Classic</I> that goes,
 'received grand instruction,'&#8220; the queen replied. &#8220;I think that must
 refer to him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm sure you're right,&#8221; the demon king said with pleasure, &#8220;I'm sure
 you're right.&#8221; He then got up, took his leave of the queen, went to the
 Flaying Pavilion, fastened his armor on neatly, mustered his devil
 soldiers, had the gates opened, and went straight outside with his
 flower-scattering battle-axe in his hand.</P>
<P>&#8220;Who's the Grand Par from Purpuria?&#8221; he yelled stridently at the top
 of his voice.</P>
<P>Grasping his gold-banded cudgel in his right hand and pointing with
 his left Monkey replied, &#8220;What are you shouting at me for, nephew?&#8221; The
 sight of him drove the demon king into a fury.</P>
<P>&#8220;Damn you,&#8221; he shouted:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've a face just like a monkey's;</P>
<P>You resemble a macaque.</P>
<P>A ghost is what you look like;</P>
<P>Don't try to knock me back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Impudent devil,&#8221; laughed Monkey, &#8220;trying to bully your superiors and
 push your master around. You're blind. I remember how when I made havoc
 in Heaven five hundred years ago all the nine heavenly generals only
 dared speak to me with the greatest respect. If I make you call me
 Grandpa I'm letting you off lightly.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Tell me your name immediately,&#8221; the demon king shouted. &#8220;What
 fighting skills have you got that give you the nerve to come rampaging
 here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You'd have done better not to ask me what I'm called,&#8221; Monkey
 replied. &#8220;But as you insist on me telling you I'm afraid you'll be in a
 hopeless mess. Come here and stand still while I tell you:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Heaven and earth were the parents that bore me;</P>
<P>My foetus was formed from the sun and moon's essence.</P>
<P>The magic rock was pregnant for years beyond number;</P>
<P>Strange indeed was the miraculous root's gestation.</P>
<P>When I was born the Three Positives were at their height;</P>
<P>Now I have been converted all is in harmony.</P>
<P>Once I was declared the chief of all the demons,</P>
<P>Who bowed to me by the red cliff as subduer of monsters.</P>
<P>The Jade Emperor issued a decree of summons,</P>
<P>And the Great White Planet came with the edict,</P>
<P>Inviting me to Heaven to take up my office,</P>
<P>But as Protector of the Horses I had no joy.</P>
<P>When I first planned rebellion in my mountain cave</P>
<P>Boldly I led my armies against the Jade Emperor,</P>
<P>The Pagoda-carrying Heavenly King and Prince Nezha</P>
<P>Were utterly helpless when they fought against me.</P>
<P>Then the White Planes made a new suggestion,</P>
<P>And brought another edict urging me to make peace</P>
<P>I was made Great Sage Equaling Heaven,</P>
<P>And proclaimed as one of the pillars of the state.</P>
<P>Because I disrupted the banquet of peaches</P>
<P>And stole elixir when drunk I met with disaster.</P>
<P>Lord Lao Zi submitted a memorial in person,</P>
<P>And the Queen Mother of the West did homage to the throne.</P>
<P>Knowing that I was running riot with the law,</P>
<P>They mustered heavenly forces and issued movement orders.</P>
<P>A hundred thousand vicious stars and evil planets</P>
<P>Were packed in close array with their swords and their halberds.</P>
<P>Heaven-and-earth nets were spread across the mountain</P>
<P>As all of the soldiers raised their weapons together.</P>
<P>A bout of bitter fighting left neither side the victor,</P>
<P>So Guanyin recommended the warrior Erlang.</P>
<P>The two of us fought together for mastery;</P>
<P>He was helped by the Seven Brothers who come from Plum Hill.</P>
<P>Each of us played the hero and did our transformations:</P>
<P>The three sages at the gates of Heaven opened the clouds.</P>
<P>Then Lord Lao Zi dropped his diamond noose,</P>
<P>And the gods led me as a prisoner to the steps of the throne-hall.</P>
<P>They did not bother with a detailed indictment:</P>
<P>The sentence was death by a thousand cuts.</P>
<P>Axe and hammer could not till me,</P>
<P>And I was unharmed by sword or saber.</P>
<P>Fire and thunderbolts were neither here nor there;</P>
<P>They had no way to destroy my immortal body.</P>
<P>I was taken under escort to the Tushita Heaven,</P>
<P>And all was arranged to refine me in the furnace.</P>
<P>Only when full time was up did they open up the vessel,</P>
<P>And I came bounding out from the middle of the crucible.</P>
<P>In my hands I was wielding this As-You-Will cudgel</P>
<P>As I somersaulted up to the Jade Emperor's throne.</P>
<P>All the stars and constellations went into hiding,</P>
<P>And I could play the vandal in the palaces of Heaven.</P>
<P>The Miraculous Investigator rushed to invite the Buddha,</P>
<P>Then Sakyamuni and I both displayed our powers.</P>
<P>Turning my somersaults in the palm of his hand</P>
<P>I roamed all over the heavens before my return.</P>
<P>The Buddha then, using both foresight and deception,</P>
<P>Crushed and held me at the ends of the heavens.</P>
<P>After a period of over five hundred years</P>
<P>My body was delivered and I could once more play up.</P>
<P>Guarding the Tang Priest on his journey to the West,</P>
<P>Brother Sun Wukong is very intelligent.</P>
<P>I subdue the demons on the Westward road:</P>
<P>Every evil spirit is struck with terror.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the demon king heard him tell that he was Sun Wukong he said,
 &#8220;So you're the so-and-so who made havoc in Heaven. If you were released
 to guard the Tang Priest on his journey West then you should be an your
 way there. Why are you being such a busybody and making trouble for me?
 You're acting as if you were the slave of Purpuria. By coming here
 you've thrown your life away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Thieving damned monster,&#8221; Monkey shouted back. &#8220;You don't know what
 you're talking about. I was politely invited to help by the king of
 Purpuria. He addressed me very respectfully and treated me well. I'm a
 thousand times higher than that king. He treated me as if I were his
 father and mother or a god. How can you say I'm acting like a slave?
 I'll get you, you monster, for bullying your superiors and trying to
 push your master around. Stay there and take this from your grandpa.&#8221;
 The monster then moved his hands and feet as fast as he could, dodged
 the blow from the cudgel and struck back at Brother Monkey's face with
 his flower-scattering axe. It was a fine battle. Just watch!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The gold-banded As-You-Will cudgel,</P>
<P>The flower-scattering axe and its wind-keen blade.</P>
<P>One ground his teeth with terrible ferocity;</P>
<P>The other gnashed his molars and displayed his might.</P>
<P>One was the Great Sage Equaling Heaven descended to earth,</P>
<P>The other an evil demon king come down to the lower world.</P>
<P>Both snorted out clouds and shining mists that lit up the heavenly
 palace.</P>
<P>Sent stones and sand flying that blotted out the Dipper.</P>
<P>They came and went through many a movement,</P>
<P>Twisting and turning and giving off golden light.</P>
<P>Each used all of his talents to the full;</P>
<P>Both staked the whole of their magical powers.</P>
<P>One wanted to take the queen back to the capital;</P>
<P>The other would happily have stayed with her in the cave.</P>
<P>There was no deep reason for the struggle:</P>
<P>He was ready to give his life for the sake of the king.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the two of them had fought fifty rounds without result the demon
 king realized that Monkey was too strong a fighter for him to be able
 to beat. Blocking the iron cudgel with his axe the demon said, &#8220;Stop,
 Sun the Novice. I haven't had my breakfast yet today. Let me eat, then
 I'll have it out with you.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey was well aware that he wanted to fetch the bells, so he put
 his cudgel away and said, &#8220;A hero doesn't chase an exhausted hare. Off
 you go. Have a good meal, and get ready to come back and die.&#8221;</P>
<P>The demon quickly turned and rushed inside, where he said to the
 queen, &#8220;Get me my treasures at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What for?&#8221; she asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The man challenging me to battle this morning was a disciple of the
 monk who's going to fetch the scriptures,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He's called Sun
 Wukong, or Sun the Novice, and Grand Par was just a nickname. I've been
 battling it out with him all this time, but still there's no outcome.
 Just wait while I take my treasures out and set off smoke and flames to
 burn that ape.&#8221; These words made the queen feel very uneasy. If she
 didn't fetch the bells, she was worried that he might be suspicious,
 but if she did she feared that Sun the Novice would be killed. As she
 was hesitating the demon king pressed her again: &#8220;Hurry up and fetch
 them.&#8221; She had no choice but to undo the lock, bring out the three
 bells and hand them to the demon king, who took them and went outside
 the cave again. The queen sat in the inner quarters, her tears pouring
 down like rain, as she thought that Monkey would not possibly be able
 to escape with his life. Neither of them realized that the bells were
 only copies.</P>
<P>Once outside the cave the demon stood upwind and shouted, &#8220;Stay where
 you are, Sun the Novice. Watch while I ring these bells.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You have your bells, but why shouldn't I have mine?&#8221; Monkey replied.
 &#8220;You can ring yours, so why shouldn't I ring mine?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What bells have you got?&#8221; the demon king asked. &#8220;Show me.&#8221; Monkey
 pinched his iron cudgel to make it into an embroidery needle that he
 tucked into his ear then brought out the three real treasures from at
 his waist.</P>
<P>&#8220;Here are my purple gold bells,&#8221; he said to the demon king. The sight
 of them came as a shock to the demon.</P>
<P>&#8220;That's funny,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;very funny. Why are his bells exactly
 the same as mine? Even if they'd been cast from the same mould they'd
 not have been properly smoothed: you'd expect some extra marks or
 missing knobs. How can they be identical with this?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where did you get your bells from?&#8221; he went on to ask again.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are yours from, dear nephew?&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>Being honest, the demon king replied, &#8220;These bells of mine,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Come from deep in the Way of the Immortal of Great Purity,</P>
<P>Are made of gold long refined in the Eight Trigrams Furnace</P>
<P>Formed into bells renowned as ultimate treasures</P>
<P>Left by Lord Lao Zi till the present day.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's where my bells come from too,&#8221; Monkey replied with a smile.</P>
<P>&#8220;How were they made?&#8221; the demon king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;These bells of mine,&#8221; said Monkey,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Were made of gold refined in the furnace</P>
<P>When Lord Lao Zi made elixir in the Tushita Palace.</P>
<P>They are cyclical treasures.</P>
<P>The two threes make six:</P>
<P>Mine are the female and yours are the male.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;The bells are golden elixir treasures,&#8221; the demon king said, &#8220;not
 birds or beasts. They can't be male or female. As long as they yield
 what's precious when they're rung they're good ones.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Words prove nothing,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Show it by actions. Shake yours
 first.&#8221; The demon king then rang his first bell three times. No fire
 came out. He rang his second three times. No smoke came out. He rang
 his third three times, and no sand came out either.</P>
<P>&#8220;Very odd,&#8221; he said, making wild gestures, &#8220;very odd. The world's
 changed. These bells must be hen-pecked. When the males see the females
 they don't dare to do their stuff.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop, nephew,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Now I'm going to shake mine to show you
 what happens.&#8221; The splendid ape then grasped all three bells in one
 hand and rang them together. Watch as clouds of red flames, black smoke
 and yellow sand all come gushing out, setting the trees and the
 mountain ablaze. Monkey then said the words of another spell and
 shouted &#8220;Wind!&#8221; towards the Southeast; and a wind did indeed spring up
 that fanned the flames. With the power of the wind behind them the
 flames and smoke filled the heavens, blazing red and deepest black, and
 the earth was covered by the yellow sandstorm. The Evil Star Matcher's
 souls fled from his body in his terror, but he had nowhere to turn:
 amid that fire there was no way of escaping with his life.</P>
<P>Then a penetrating shout was heard from mid-air: &#8220;Sun Wukong, I am
 here.&#8221; Monkey quickly looked up and saw that it was the Bodhisattva
 Guanyin holding her vase of pure water in her left hand and a sprig of
 willow in her right with which to sprinkle sweet dew and put out the
 flames. In his alarm Monkey hid the bells at his waist, put the palms
 of his hands together and prostrated himself in a kowtow. The
 Bodhisattva flicked a few drops of sweet dew from her willow sprig and
 in an instant both flames and smoke disappeared, while no sign of the
 yellow sand remained to be seen.</P>
<P>&#8220;I did not realize, Most Merciful One, that you were coming down to
 the mortal world,&#8221; said Brother Monkey as he kowtowed, &#8220;and it was
 wrong of me to fail to keep out of your way. May I venture to ask where
 you are going, Bodhisattva?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am here especially to find and take this evil monster,&#8221; the
 Bodhisattva replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;What is the monster's background, and how can he put you to the
 trouble of capturing him in your illustrious person?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;He is a golden-haired giant hound on which I used to ride,&#8221; the
 Bodhisattva replied. &#8220;The boy in charge of it fell asleep and failed to
 keep proper guard over it, so that the wicked beast bit through its
 iron chains and escaped to save the king of Purpuria from disaster.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he hastily bowed and said, &#8220;You have it the
 wrong way round, Bodhisattva. He's been mistreating the king and his
 queen, and thus damaging public morality. So how can you say that he
 has saved the king from disaster when in fact he has brought him
 disaster?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You would not know,&#8221; the Bodhisattva replied, &#8220;that when the
 previous king of Purpuria was reigning and the present king was the
 crown prince and had not yet taken the throne he was a superb archer
 and huntsman. Once he led his men and horses hunting with falcon and
 hound. They came to the Fallen Phoenix Slope, where a young peacock and
 peahen, two children of the Buddha's mother in the West, the
 Bodhisattva Maurya Vidya Rani were resting. When the king shot with his
 bow he wounded the cock, while the hen died with an arrow still in her.
 After the Buddha's mother realized to her regret what had happened she
 ordered that the prince should be separated from his wife for three
 years and suffer himself the way birds do when they are parted from
 their mates. At the time I was riding that hound and we both heard her
 say that. I never imagined that the beast would remember it and come
 back to mistreat the queen and thus save the king from disaster. That
 was three years ago, and now that the misdeed has been paid for it was
 fortunate that you came along to cure the king. I am here to recover
 the wicked and evil creature.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Bodhisattva,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;this may well be so, but he did sully
 the queen, damage public morality, offend ethics and break the law. You
 can't let him off a non-capital punishment. Let me give him twenty
 blows before handing him over for you to take back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said the Bodhisattva, &#8220;as you know I am here you really
 ought to show me the respect I deserve and spare him completely. This
 still counts as one of your successes in subduing a demon. If you hit
 him with your cudgel it'll kill him.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey dared not disobey, but bowed and said, &#8220;If you're taking him
 back to the ocean with you, Bodhisattva, you mustn't let him escape and
 come down to the human world again. That would be quite a catastrophe.&#8221;</P>
<P>Only then did the Bodhisattva shout, &#8220;Wicked beast! Turn back into
 your own form! What are you waiting for?&#8221; The monster could be seen
 doing a roll and turning back into himself. Then he shook his fur for
 the Bodhisattva to mount on his back. The Bodhisattva looked down at
 his neck to see that the three golden bells were missing. &#8220;Wukong,&#8221; she
 said, &#8220;give me my bells back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I don't know where they are,&#8221; Monkey said.</P>
<P>&#8220;Thieving ape,&#8221; the Bodhisattva shouted. &#8220;If you hadn't stolen those
 bells then ten Sun Wukongs, never mind one, would have dared go nowhere
 near him. Hand them over at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I really haven't seen them,&#8221; Monkey replied with a smile.</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case I'll have to recite the Band-tightening Spell,&#8221; said
 the Bodhisattva.</P>
<P>This scared Monkey, who could only plead, &#8220;Don't say it, don't say
 it. The bells are here.&#8221; This was indeed a case of</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Who could untie the bells from neck of the giant hound?</P>
<P>To find that out ask the one who first fastened them on.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Bodhisattva then placed the bells round the giant hound's neck,
 and flew up to her high throne. Watch as the</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Four-stalked lotus flowers blazed with fire;</P>
<P>Her whole body was thickly clad in cloth of gold.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We will say no more of how the Great Merciful One returned to the
 Southern Ocean.</P>
<P>The Great Sage Sun Wukong then tidied up his clothing and charged
 into the Horndog Gave swinging his iron cudgel and killing to his
 heart's content. He wiped all the demons out till he reached the inner
 quarters of the palace and asked the Golden Queen to go back to her
 country. She prostrated herself to him for a long time. Monkey told her
 all about how the Bodhisattva had subdued the demon and why she had
 been separated from her husband. Then he gathered some soft grasses
 that he twisted together into a long straw dragon.</P>
<P>&#8220;Sit on this, ma'am,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and shut your eyes. Don't be afraid.
 I'm taking you back to court to see your master.&#8221; The queen followed
 his instructions carefully while he used his magic power. There was a
 sound of the wind whistling in her ears.</P>
<P>An hour later he brought her into the city. Bringing his cloud down
 he said, &#8220;Open your eyes, ma'am.&#8221; When the queen opened her eyes and
 looked she recognized the phoenix buildings and dragon towers. She was
 very happy, and getting off the straw dragon she climbed the steps of
 the throne hall. When the king saw her he came straight down from his
 dragon throne to take the queen by her jade hand.</P>
<P>He was just going to tell her how much he had missed her when he
 suddenly collapsed, shouting: &#8220;My hand hurts, my hand hurts.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Look at that mug,&#8221; Pig said, roaring with laughter, &#8220;he's out of
 luck. No joy for him. The moment he meets her again he gets stung.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Idiot,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;would you dare grab her?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What if I did?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The queen's covered with poisonous spikes,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and she
 has poison on her hands. In the three years she was with the Evil Star
 Matcher in Mount Unicorn the monster never had her. If he had, his
 whole body would have been in agony. Even touching her with his hand
 made his hand ache.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Then what is to be done about it?&#8221; the officials asked. While all
 the officials were wondering what to do in the outer palace and the
 consorts and concubines in the inner palace were full of terror, the
 Jade and the Silver Queen helped their king to his feet.</P>
<P>Amid-the general alarm a voice was heard in the sky shouting, &#8220;Great
 Sage, I'm here.&#8221; Brother Monkey looked up, and this is what was to be
 seen:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The cry of a crane soaring through the heavens,</P>
<P>Then flying straight down to the palace of the king.</P>
<P>Beams of auspicious light shone about;</P>
<P>Clouds of holy vapors drifted all around.</P>
<P>Mists came from the cloak of coconut that covered his body:</P>
<P>Rare were the straw sandals on which he trod.</P>
<P>The fly-whisk in his hand was made of dragon whiskers,</P>
<P>And silken tassels hung around his waist.</P>
<P>He joined human destinies together throughout heaven and earth</P>
<P>As he roamed free and easy all over the world.</P>
<P>He was the Purple Clouds Immortal of the Daluo Heaven,</P>
<P>Come down to earth today to lift an enchantment.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey went over to him to greet him with, &#8220;Where are you going,
 Zhang Boduan of the Ziyang sect?&#8221;</P>
<P>The True Man of Ziyang came to the front of the hall, bowed and
 replied, &#8220;Great Sage, the humble immortal Zhang Boduan greets you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where have you come from?&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Three years ago I passed this way when going to a Buddha assembly,&#8221;
 the True Man said. &#8220;When I saw that the King of Purpuria was suffering
 the agony of being parted from his wife I was worried that the demon
 would defile the queen. That would have been an affront to morality and
 made it hard for the queen to be reunited with the king later on. So I
 turned an old coconut cloak into a new dress of many colours and gave
 it to the demon king. He made the queen wear it as her wedding dress.
 As soon as she put it on poisonous barbs grew all over her body. They
 were the coconut cloak. Now that you have been successful, Great Sage,
 I've come to lift the spell.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;thank you for coming so far. Please
 remove the barbs at once.&#8221; The True Man stepped forward, pointed at the
 queen, and removed the coconut cloak. The queen's body was once more as
 it had originally been.</P>
<P>The True Man shook the cloak, put it over his shoulders, and said to
 Monkey, &#8220;Please forgive me if I leave now, Great Sage.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't go yet,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Wait till the king has thanked you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I won't trouble him,&#8221; said the True Man with a smile, then raised
 his hands together in salute, rose up into the sky and went. The king,
 queen and the officials high and low were so astonished that they all
 bowed to the sky.</P>
<P>When the bowing was over the king ordered that the Eastern hall of
 the palace be thrown open so that they could give thanks to the four
 monks. The king led all his officials to go down on their knees and
 kowtow to them, and husband and wife were reunited. In the middle of
 the celebratory banquet Monkey said, &#8220;Master, bring out that
 declaration of war.&#8221;</P>
<P>The venerable elder produced it from his sleeve and handed it to
 Monkey, who passed it in turn to the king. &#8220;This was a letter that the
 demons sent his lieutenant to deliver,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;He was the
 officer I killed and brought here as a trophy. Then I turned myself
 into the officer and went back to the cave to report. That was how I
 saw Her Majesty and stole the golden bells. He almost caught me, but I
 did another change, stole them again, got them out and fought him. It
 was lucky for him that the Bodhisattva Guanyin came to collect him and
 tell me why you and Her Majesty were parted.&#8221;</P>
<P>He told the whole story from beginning to end in great detail.
 Everyone in the country&#8212;whether ruler or ministers, whether within the
 palace or outside&#8212;expressed admiration and gratitude.</P>
<P>&#8220;In the first place,&#8221; said the Tang Priest, &#8220;it was because of Your
 Majesty's own good fortune, and in the second place it was thanks to my
 disciple's efforts. We are deeply obliged to you for this sumptuous
 banquet today, and now we must take our leave of you. Please do not
 delay us poor monks on our pilgrimage to the West.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the king realized that his efforts to keep them there would be
 of no avail he inspected and returned the passport and arranged a great
 procession of royal coaches. The Tang Priest was invited to sit in his
 own dragon carriage, while the king, his queens and his consorts
 themselves all pushed it along as they saw them on their way then bade
 them farewell. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He was fated to have his melancholy washed clean away:</P>
<P>The mind finds peace of itself when thought and worrying cease.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you do not know what of good or ill lay in store for them on the
 way ahead listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

</I>
<P>The Seven Emotions Confuse the Basic in Gossamer Cave</P>
<P>At Filth-Cleansing Spring Pig Forgets Himself</P>
</B>
<P>The story tells how Sanzang took his leave of the king of Purpuria,
 got everything ready, saddled the horse and headed Westwards. They
 crossed many a mountain and river. Before they realized it autumn and
 winter were over and spring's brightness and charm were back. Master
 and disciples were enjoying the scenery as their way led them across
 the greenery when they suddenly noticed a building amid trees. Sanzang
 dismounted and stood beside the main track.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; Brother Monkey asked, &#8220;the road is easy and there is no
 evil about, so why have you stopped?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You aren't at all understanding, brother,&#8221; Pig said. &#8220;The master is
 feeling sleepy after being in the saddle for so long. You ought to let
 him come down and have a rest.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's not that,&#8221; Sanzang said. &#8220;I can see a house over there. I was
 thinking of going there myself to beg for some food.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a thing for the master to say,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile. &#8220;If
 you want some food I'll go and beg some for you. As the saying goes,
 'Your teacher for a day is your father for the rest of your life.' It
 would be outrageous for me, your disciple, to sit here idly and let my
 master go begging.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no need to say that,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;Usually you three
 have to cross enormous distances as far as the eye can see to beg for
 our food. Today there's a house so close it's in shouting distance, so
 let me beg this time.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But, Master, you wouldn't know what to do,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;As the saying
 goes, when three people go travelling it's the youngest who does the
 rough jobs. You're the senior one and we're all only disciples. As the
 old book says, 'When there is a job to be done the disciple does it.'
 Let me go.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciples,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;the weather is good today. It's not at
 all like the times when you all have to go far away in wind and rain.
 Let me go to this house. Whether I get any food or not I shall soon be
 back and we shall be on our way.&#8221;</P>
<P>Friar Sand, who was standing beside them, smiled and said, &#8220;Stop
 arguing so much, brother. As the master has made his mind up you
 shouldn't disobey him. If you upset him he won't eat any of the food
 you are able to beg.&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig accepted this suggestion and brought out the begging bowl and a
 change of hat and cassock for the master, who went straight to the farm
 building to look at it. It really was a fine place. He could see:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A high-rising stone bridge,</P>
<P>Ancient trees growing close together.</P>
<P>Where the stone bridge rose high</P>
<P>A babbling brook joined a long stream;</P>
<P>Amid close-growing ancient trees</P>
<P>Hidden birds sang sweetly on the distant hill.</P>
<P>Across the bridge were several thatched houses</P>
<P>As pure and elegant as an immortal's hermitage.</P>
<P>There was also a thatched hut</P>
<P>So pure and white it would put a Taoist temple to shame.</P>
<P>Before the hut could be seen four beauties</P>
<P>All busily embroidering phoenix designs.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As there were no males but only these four girls to be seen the
 reverend gentleman did not dare go inside, but slipped back under the
 tall trees and stood stock still. He could see that each of the girls</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Were rock-hard in their ladylike propriety,</P>
<P>And happy as the spring in their orchid natures.</P>
<P>Red glows set off their tender cheeks;</P>
<P>Crimson make-up was spread on their lips.</P>
<P>Their moth brows were as fine as a crescent moon,</P>
<P>While their clouds of hair were piled up like cicada wings.</P>
<P>Had any of them stood among the flowers</P>
<P>Wandering bees would have taken them for blossoms.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He stood there for an hour. The silence was complete, unbroken by dog
 or cock. &#8220;If I'm not even capable of begging us a meal my disciples
 will laugh at me,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;If the master can't beg a meal, what
 hope do his disciples have of ever getting to see the Buddha?&#8221;</P>
<P>He did not know what to do, but it seemed wrong to stay there any
 longer, so he went back towards the bridge, only to notice a pavilion
 inside the compound of thatched cottages. In the pavilion three more
 girls were juggling a ball with their feet. Look at them. They were
 different from the other four:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Their turquoise sleeves are waving</P>
<P>And their embroidered skirts are swaying.</P>
<P>The waving turquoise sleeves</P>
<P>Cover their delicate jade bamboo-shoots of fingers,</P>
<P>The swaying embroidered skirts</P>
<P>Half show their tiny golden lotus feet.</P>
<P>Perfect are their faces and bodies,</P>
<P>Endless the movements of their slippered heels.</P>
<P>As they grab for the head they vary in height;</P>
<P>They pass the ball around most smoothly.</P>
<P>One turns around and kicks an &#8220;over-the-wall flower,&#8221;</P>
<P>Then does a backward somersault called &#8220;crossing the sea.&#8221;</P>
<P>After lightly taking a pass like a lump of clay</P>
<P>A single spear is hard pressed by a pair of sticks.</P>
<P>A shining pearl is put on the Buddha's head</P>
<P>And held between the tips of their fingers.</P>
<P>Skillfully they hold the ball as a narrow brick,</P>
<P>Twisting their feet in the sleeping fish position.</P>
<P>Their backs held level, they squat with bended knee;</P>
<P>Turning their necks they kick their heels in the air.</P>
<P>They can make benches fly around;</P>
<P>Very stylish are the capes upon their shoulders.</P>
<P>Their trouser-legs are bound with tapes to let them move,</P>
<P>While their necklaces swing as they sway.</P>
<P>They kick the ball like the Yellow River flowing backwards.</P>
<P>Or goldfish purchased on the beach.</P>
<P>When you mistake one of them for the leader</P>
<P>Another one turns to carry the ball away.</P>
<P>They all hold their calves so trimly in the air,</P>
<P>Pointing their toes to catch the ball.</P>
<P>They raise their heels to spin straw sandals,</P>
<P>Planting them upside-down and picking them up in a turn.</P>
<P>As they step back their shoulder-capes spread out</P>
<P>Fastened only with a hook.</P>
<P>The peddler's basket comes down long and low,</P>
<P>Then they grab for the goal.</P>
<P>At the really magnificent footwork.</P>
<P>All the beauties shout with admiration.</P>
<P>The silken clothes of all are soaked in sweat;</P>
<P>Feeling tired and relaxed they ended their game.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The description could go on and on. There is another poem that tells
 more:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Kicking the ball in the April weather,</P>
<P>Beauties blown along by the magical wind.</P>
<P>Sweat stained their powdered faces like dew on a flower;</P>
<P>The dust on their moth eyebrows was mist hiding willows.</P>
<P>Their turquoise sleeves hanging low covered jade fingers;</P>
<P>Trailing embroidered skirts showed golden lotus feet.</P>
<P>After kicking the ball many times they were charmingly tired;</P>
<P>Their hair was disheveled and their topknots askew.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After watching for a long time Sanzang could only go to the bridge
 and call loudly, &#8220;Bodhisattvas, fate brings me here as a poor monk to
 beg for the gift of some food.&#8221; As soon as the women heard him they
 cheerfully put aside their needlework and balls to come out smiling and
 giggling through the gates to greet him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Reverend sir,&#8221; they said, &#8220;we're sorry we didn't welcome you sooner.
 As you have come to our poor farm we couldn't possibly feed you on the
 path. Please come inside and sit down.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Sanzang heard this he thought, &#8220;Splendid, this is splendid. The
 West really is Buddha's land. If even these womenfolk are so diligent
 about feeding monks the men are bound to be pious followers of the
 Buddha.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang stepped forward to greet the women and followed them into the
 thatched cottages. As he passed the pavilion and looked he saw that on
 the other side of it there were no buildings. All that could be seen
 were:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Towering mountain-tops,</P>
<P>Distant ranges of the earth.</P>
<P>The towering mountain-tops touch the clouds;</P>
<P>The distant ranges of the earth lead to peaks in the ocean.</P>
<P>From the stone bridge by the gates</P>
<P>One looks on a stream that bends nine times;</P>
<P>The peach and plum trees in the orchard</P>
<P>Vie in abundance of blossom.</P>
<P>Creepers and vines hang from three or four trees;</P>
<P>The fragrance of orchids is spread by thousands of flowers.</P>
<P>From afar this retreat rivals Penglai's fairyland;</P>
<P>Seen from close to the mountain beats Tai and Hua.</P>
<P>This is truly a retreat for demon immortals,</P>
<P>An isolated house with no neighbors around.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>One woman came forward to push the stone gates open and invite the
 Tang Priest to come in and sit down. All he could do was go inside.
 When he looked up he saw that the tables and seats were all of stone,
 and the atmosphere was oppressively cold. This alarmed the venerable
 elder, who thought, &#8220;This is a thoroughly sinister place. I'm sure it's
 evil.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please sit down, venerable elder,&#8221; the women all said with simpering
 smiles. He had no choice but to sit down. A little later he found
 himself shuddering.</P>
<P>&#8220;What monastery are you from, reverend sir?&#8221; the women asked. &#8220;For
 what purpose are you collecting alms? Are you repairing roads and
 bridges, founding monasteries, worshipping at pagodas, or having Buddha
 statues made and sutras printed? Won't you show us your donation book?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am not a monk collecting donations,&#8221; the venerable elder replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you're not here to ask for charity then why are you here?&#8221; the
 women asked. &#8220;We have been sent by Great Tang in the East to the
 Thunder Monastery in the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures,&#8221;
 Sanzang replied. &#8220;As our stomachs were empty when we happened to be
 passing this distinguished place I have come to beg a vegetarian meal
 from you in your kindness. After that we poor monks will be on our way
 again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Splendid, splendid,&#8221; the women all said. &#8220;As the saying goes, monks
 from afar most love to read the scriptures. Sisters! We must treat them
 well. Let's give them some vegetarian food as quickly as we can.&#8221;</P>
<P>While three of the women kept him company, talking about such matters
 as primary and secondary causation, the other four went into the
 kitchen, where they tucked up their clothes, rolled up their sleeves,
 fanned the fire and scrubbed the cooking pots. Do you know what it was
 they prepared? They were frying in human fat, and what they cooked was
 human flesh, stewed into black paste as if it were wheat gluten, and
 human brain cut out to fry like pieces of beancurd.</P>
<P>Then they placed the two dishes on a stone table and said to Sanzang,
 &#8220;Do eat. We were too rushed to prepare anything good, so please make do
 with this. It'll stave off the pangs of hunger. There will be some more
 dishes to follow.&#8221;</P>
<P>As soon as Sanzang used his nose and smelled the stench of flesh he
 would not eat, but bowed with his hands together be; re his chest and
 said, &#8220;Bodhisattvas, I have been a vegetarian since birth.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But this is vegetarian food, reverend sir,&#8221; the women all replied
 with smiles.</P>
<P>&#8220;Amitabha Buddha!&#8221; exclaimed Sanzang. &#8220;If as a monk I ate vegetarian
 food like that I would never have any hope of seeing the Buddha or
 fetching the surras.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Reverend sir,&#8221; the women said, &#8220;as a monk you shouldn't be so choosy
 about what you're given.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I never could be,&#8221; Sanzang said, &#8220;I never could be. I am under the
 orders of the Great Tang emperor to harm not even the tiniest life, to
 save all I see suffering, to put all the food-grain I am given into my
 mouth with my fingers, and to cover my body with the threads of silk
 that come my way. I would never dare pick and choose among my
 benefactors' gifts.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Even if you're not picking and choosing,&#8221; the women replied with
 smiles, &#8220;you do seem to have come here to complain. Please eat some of
 the food and don't mind if it's a little coarse and flavorless.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's not that I don't want to eat it,&#8221; Sanzang said, &#8220;it's that I'm
 afraid I'd be breaking my vows. I hope that you Bodhisattvas will
 remember that setting living beings free is better than keeping them
 with you and let me go on my way.&#8221;</P>
<P>As Sanzang struggled to get out the women blocked the gateway and
 refused to let him go. &#8220;Business bringing itself to our door!&#8221; they all
 said. &#8220;You've no more chance of getting away from here than of covering
 up a fart with your hands. Where do you think you're going?&#8221;</P>
<P>They were all quite skilled in the martial arts and quick movers too,
 and after they had grabbed Sanzang they dragged him like a sheep and
 threw him to the ground. Then they all held him down, tied him up, and
 suspended him from the rafters. There is a special name for the way
 they hung him up there: The Immortal Shows the Way. One hand was strung
 up by a rope so that it pointed forward. The other hand was fastened to
 his waist by another rope that was also holding him aloft, and his legs
 were both held up by a third rope behind him. The three ropes had him
 suspended from a beam with his back on top and his belly pointing down.</P>
<P>As Sanzang endured the agony and held back his tears he thought with
 bitter regret, &#8220;How evil my destiny is. I thought I was coming to beg
 for a vegetarian meal from good people. I never imagined I'd be falling
 into the fiery pit. Disciples! Rescue me as soon as you can if I am
 ever to see you again. If you don't get here within four hours I shall
 be dead.&#8221;</P>
<P>Despite his misery Sanzang kept a careful eye on the women. When they
 had him tied up securely and hanging there they started to remove their
 clothes. This alarmed the venerable elder, who thought, &#8220;They must be
 taking their clothes off because they are going to beat me. Perhaps
 they are going to eat me too.&#8221; The women only unbuttoned their gauze
 blouses, exposing their stomachs. Then each of them produced a silken
 rope about as thick as a duck egg from her navel. These they made move
 like bursting jade or flying silver as they fastened the gates of the
 farm.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We leave them and go back to Monkey, Pig and Friar Sand, who were all
 still waiting by the main road. While the other two were pasturing the
 horse and looking after the baggage Monkey was amusing himself by
 leaping from tree to tree and climbing around the branches as he picked
 leaves and looked for fruit. Suddenly he turned round and saw a sheet
 of light.</P>
<P>This so alarmed him that he jumped out of the tree with a shout of,
 &#8220;This is terrible! Terrible! The master's luck is out.&#8221; He pointed as
 he continued, &#8220;Look at the farm. What do you think?&#8221; When Pig and Friar
 Sand both looked they saw a sheet of something like snow but brighter
 and like silver but shinier.</P>
<P>&#8220;That's done it,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;that's done it. The master's run into
 evil spirits. We'd better go and rescue him straight away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop yelling, brother,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Neither of you can see just
 what's there. Wait while I go and take a look.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do be careful, brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand.</P>
<P>&#8220;I can cope,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage tightened his tigerskin kilt, pulled out his
 gold-banded cudgel and took a few strides forward to see that the
 silken ropes had formed something like a web with thousands of strands.
 When he felt it with his hands it was somewhat soft and sticky. Not
 knowing what it was, Monkey raised his cudgel and said, &#8220;Never mind
 thousands of strands. This cudgel could break through tens of thousands
 of them.&#8221;</P>
<P>He was just about to strike when he stopped to think, &#8220;If they were
 hard I could certainly smash them, but then soft ones would only be
 knocked flat, and if I alarm the demons and get caught myself that
 would be a disaster. I'd better make some enquiries before I do any
 hitting.&#8221;</P>
<P>Who do you think he asked? He made a spell with his hands, said the
 words of it and sent for an old local god, who ran round and round in
 his shrine just as if turning a mill. &#8220;Old man,&#8221; his wife asked, &#8220;what
 are you rushing round and round for? You must be having a fit.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't understand,&#8221; the local god replied. &#8220;There's a Great Sage
 Equaling Heaven here. I didn't go to meet him. But he's sending for
 me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Go and see him then,&#8221; his wife replied, &#8220;and that'll be that. Why
 charge round and round in here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But if I go and see him that cudgel of his hits very hard,&#8221; the
 local deity said. &#8220;He doesn't care what you're like&#8212;he just hits you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He won't possibly hit you when he sees how old you are,&#8221; his wife
 replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;He's been cadging free drinks all his life,&#8221; the local god said,
 &#8220;and he really loves hitting old people.&#8221;</P>
<P>After talking for a while with his wife the local god had no choice
 but to go outside and kneel shivering and shaking by the roadside,
 calling out, &#8220;Great Sage, the local deity kowtows to you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Get up,&#8221; Brother Monkey replied, &#8220;and stop pretending to be so keen.
 I'm not going to hit you. I'm just passing through. Tell me where this
 is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Which way have you come, Great Sage?&#8221; the local deity asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I've come from the East and I'm heading West,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Which mountain have you reached on your journey from the East?&#8221; the
 local deity asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;That ridge there,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Our baggage and the horse are
 there, aren't they?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That is Gossamer Ridge,&#8221; the local deity replied. &#8220;Under the ridge
 there's a cave called Gossamer Cave where seven evil spirits live.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Male or female ones?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;She-devils,&#8221; the local deity replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;How powerful is their magic?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm much too weak and insignificant to know that,&#8221; the local god
 replied. &#8220;All I can tell you is that a mile due South of here there is
 a natural hot spring called the Filth-cleansing Spring,&#8221; the local god
 said, &#8220;where the Seven Fairies from on high used to bathe. When the
 seven evil spirits settled here and took over the Filth-cleansing
 Spring the good spirits didn't try to fight them for it. They let the
 spirits have it for nothing. I reckon that if even good spirits from
 Heaven don't dare offend them the evil spirits must have tremendous
 powers.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What have they taken the spring over for?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Ever since taking the bathing pool over the monsters have been
 coming to bathe there three times a day,&#8221; the local god replied. &#8220;It's
 already after eleven. They'll be along at noon.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Go back now, local god,&#8221; Monkey said when he heard all this, &#8220;and
 wait while I capture them.&#8221; The old local god kowtowed to him and went
 back to his shrine all of a tremble.</P>
<P>The Great Sage then gave a solo display of his magical powers,
 shaking himself, turning into a fly, and landing on the tip of a blade
 of grass to wait beside the path. A little later he heard a rustling,
 hissing sound like that of silkworms eating leaves or an ocean tide
 coming in. In the time it takes to drink half a cup of tea the silken
 ropes had all gone, and the farm looked just the same as it had before.
 Then there was a creaking noise as the wicker gate opened and the seven
 women came out laughing and talking noisily. Monkey watched carefully
 from where he was hiding and saw them talking and laughing as they held
 each other by the hand and walked shoulder to shoulder across the
 bridge. They were real beauties:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Compare them with jade and they were more fragrant;</P>
<P>They were like flowers but able to talk.</P>
<P>Their willowy brows were like distant hills;</P>
<P>Sandalwood-scented mouths were bursting cherries.</P>
<P>Hair ornaments were of jade;</P>
<P>Golden lotus feet darted out under crimson skirts.</P>
<P>They were like the moon goddess come down to earth,</P>
<P>Immortal girls descending to the world.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;No wonder the master wanted to come begging for food,&#8221; thought
 Monkey with a laugh, &#8220;with all these lovelies here. If these seven
 beauties have captured him he won't be enough for a single meal for
 them. They couldn't make him last a couple of days. And if they take it
 in turns to have their way with him they'll kill him straight off. I'd
 better go and listen to what they're plotting.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage flew over with a high-pitched buzz and landed
 on the topknot of the woman who was walking in front. When she was over
 the bridge the women behind her caught up with her and called out,
 &#8220;Sister, let's have a bath before we steam the fat monk and eat him
 up.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;These monsters aren't at all economical,&#8221; Monkey smiled to himself.
 &#8220;They'd save a lot of firewood if they boiled him. Why steam him
 instead?&#8221; The women walked South, picking flowers and throwing grass at
 each other, and were soon at the bathing pool, where a very magnificent
 wall and gateway appeared, with fragrant flowers, among them a bed of
 orchids, growing all around. One of the women behind him stepped
 forward and with a whistling sound pushed the double gates open,
 revealing the pond of naturally hot water inside. As for this water,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When heaven and earth were first separated</P>
<P>There were ten suns in the sky</P>
<P>Till Yi, the fine archer,</P>
<P>Shot nine of the sun-crows down to the earth,</P>
<P>Leaving only one golden crow star,</P>
<P>The true fire of the sun.</P>
<P>The nine hot springs in heaven and earth</P>
<P>Are the other nine crows transformed.</P>
<P>These nine hot springs are</P>
<P>Cool Fragrance Spring,</P>
<P>Mountain-companions Spring</P>
<P>Warm Spring,</P>
<P>Donghe Spring,</P>
<P>Mount Huang Spring,</P>
<P>Xiao'an Spring,</P>
<P>Guangfen Spring,</P>
<P>Hot Water Spring,</P>
<P>And this Filth-cleansing Spring.</P>
<P>There is a poem about it that goes:</P>
<P>The same vital force runs in all four seasons;</P>
<P>Spring continues throughout the autumn.</P>
<P>The scalding water bubbles like a cauldron;</P>
<P>The snow-white waves are boiling hot.</P>
<P>If the waters are spread they help the crops to grow;</P>
<P>Left where they are they wash worldly dust away.</P>
<P>Little bubbles spread out like pearls,</P>
<P>Rolling ones rise like pieces of jade.</P>
<P>It is rich and smooth although not wine,</P>
<P>Clear, calm and naturally warm.</P>
<P>The whole place thrives on its air of good omen:</P>
<P>It brings good fortune and the natural truth.</P>
<P>When the beauties wash their flesh is smooth as ice;</P>
<P>As dirt is soaked away their jade-like bodies are made new.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The bathing pool was about fifty feet across, a hundred feet long and
 four feet deep. The water was pure and translucent, and from the bottom
 of it came up bubbles like rolling pearls or floating jade. In the four
 sides of the pool there were six or seven pipes through which the water
 flowed out, keeping warm even when it reached fields up to a mile away.
 Beside the pool was a three-roomed pavilion, next to the back wall of
 which stood an eight-legged bench. At each end of the pavilion was a
 clothes stand painted in coloured lacquers. All this secretly delighted
 Monkey, who flew straight to one of the stands and landed on it.</P>
<P>When the women saw how clear and warm the water was they wanted to
 bathe in it, so they all took their clothes off and hung them on the
 stands before going into the pool together. This is what Monkey saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>They undid the buttons on their clothes,</P>
<P>Loosened the knots in their gauzy sashes.</P>
<P>Silvery white were their creamy breasts,</P>
<P>Snowy their bodies that looked like jade.</P>
<P>Their arms and elbows were cool as ice,</P>
<P>And scented shoulders more lovely than if powdered.</P>
<P>Soft and supple the skin on their stomachs,</P>
<P>Glistening and clean their backs.</P>
<P>Their knees and wrists were rounded and soft;</P>
<P>Only three inches long were their golden lotus feet.</P>
<P>And as for what lay in between,</P>
<P>They showed a glimpse of the cave of pleasure.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The women all jumped into the water and enjoyed themselves as they
 frolicked in the waves. &#8220;If I wanted to hit them,&#8221; Monkey thought, &#8220;I'd
 only need to stir the water with my cudgel. It would be like pouring
 boiling water on a nest of mice: I could kill the lot of them. What a
 pity. If I hit them I'd kill them, but it wouldn't do my reputation any
 good. As they say, a real man doesn't fight women. It'd be hopeless if
 a man like me killed these girls. If I'm not going to hit them I'll
 have to make things difficult for them so that they can't move.&#8221; The
 splendid Great Sage made a spell with his hands, said the words of it,
 shook himself and turned into a hungry eagle.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>His feathers were like frost or snow,</P>
<P>His eyes like bright stars.</P>
<P>When evil foxes saw him their souls were scared out of them;</P>
<P>And crafty hares were struck with terror.</P>
<P>His steely claws were sharp as spear-points;</P>
<P>His air was both majestic and ferocious.</P>
<P>He used his talons to seize his food,</P>
<P>And was ready to catch his flying prey himself.</P>
<P>He could fly high and low across the chilly sky,</P>
<P>Swooping through clouds and on his quarry at will.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>With a whoosh of his wings he flew towards them, stretched his sharp
 talons to seize all seven sets of clothes that were hung on the stands
 and flew straight back to the ridge with them. Here he reverted to his
 own form to see Pig and Friar Sand.</P>
<P>Just look at the idiot as he comes up to Brother Monkey and says with
 a grin, &#8220;The master must have been taken to a pawnbroker's.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you tell?&#8221; asked Friar Sand.</P>
<P>&#8220;Can't you see all those clothes our brother's grabbed?&#8221; Pig replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;These are the evil spirits' clothes,&#8221; said Monkey, putting them
 down.</P>
<P>&#8220;How on earth did you get so many?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;There are seven outfits,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;How did you strip them so easily, and strip them naked at that?&#8221; Pig
 asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I didn't have to strip them,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;This place is called
 Gossamer Ridge, and the farm is called Gossamer Gave. The seven
 she-devils who live there captured the master, hung him up in their
 cave and all went off to bathe in the Filth-cleansing Spring. It's a
 natural hot spring. Their plan was to have a bath then steam the master
 and eat him. I went there with them and watched them undress and get
 into the water. I wanted to hit them, but I was worried it would
 contaminate my cudgel and ruin my reputation so I didn't. I just turned
 myself into a hungry eagle and grabbed their clothes in my talons. Now
 they're all squatting in the water, too embarrassed to come out. Let's
 rescue the master and be on our way as quickly as we can.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; grinned Pig, &#8220;you always leave something undone. You could
 see that they were evil spirits, so why didn't you kill them first then
 rescue the master? Even if they're too embarrassed to come out now
 they'll certainly come out after nightfall. They're bound to have
 enough old clothes at home to be able to put on an outfit each and come
 after us. Even if they don't come after us they live here permanently
 and we'll have to come this way back after we've fetched the
 scriptures. As the saying goes, it's better to get into debt on a
 journey than to get into a fight. When they stop us and make a row
 they'll really have it in for us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So what do you suggest?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you ask me we should kill the demons then rescue the master,&#8221;
 said Pig. &#8220;That's what's called cutting down weeds and digging them out
 by the roots.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm not going to hit them,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;If you want them hit go
 and do it yourself.&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig then summoned up his spirits and in high delight rushed straight
 there, his rake held aloft. As he suddenly pushed the gates open and
 looked inside he saw the seven women squatting in the water and wildly
 cursing the eagle.</P>
<P>&#8220;Feathery beast,&#8221; they were saying, &#8220;cat-headed monster. What the
 hell can we do now you've carried our clothes off?&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig could not help laughing as he said to them, &#8220;Bodhisattvas, carry
 on with your bath. Do you mind if I join you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You monk, you're disgrace,&#8221; the devils retorted angrily as they saw
 him. &#8220;We're laywomen and you're a man of religion. As the ancient book
 has it, 'From the age of seven boys and girls do not share the same
 mat.' You mustn't possibly bathe in the same pool as us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But the weather's so scorching hot I've got no choice,&#8221; said Pig.
 &#8220;You'll have to make the best of it and let me take a wash. What do you
 have to show off all that book-learning about sharing mats for?&#8221;</P>
<P>With further argument the idiot dropped his rake, stripped off his
 cotton tunic and jumped in with a splash, to the fury of the demons who
 all rushed at him to hit him. Little did they realize how expert Pig
 was in the water. Once in the pool he shook himself and turned into a
 catfish spirit. The demons then tried to grab him but even when they
 caught him they could not get a firm grip. If they grabbed to the East
 he suddenly shot Westwards, and if they tried to grab him to the West
 he went East. The funny thing was that he kept wriggling around their
 crotches. The water was about chest-high, and after swimming around at
 the surface and then at the bottom of the pool for a while he had
 covered all of it and was panting and exhausted.</P>
<P>Only then did Pig jump out, turn back into himself, put his tunic
 back on, pick up his rake and shout, &#8220;Who am I then? You thought I was
 a catfish spirit!&#8221;</P>
<P>At the sight of him the demons all trembled with fright and said to
 Pig, &#8220;When you came here first you were a monk, then you turned into a
 catfish in the water and we couldn't catch you. Now you've dressed like
 that. Where have you come from? You must tell us your name.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Bloody demons, you really don't know who I am,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;I'm a
 disciple of the Venerable Tang Priest, who has been sent from Tang in
 the East to fetch the scriptures. My title is Marshal Tian Peng and I'm
 called Zhu Wuneng, or Pig. You've hung my master up in your cave and
 you're planning to steam him and eat him. Is my master just a meal for
 you to cook? Stretch your heads out at once. I'm going to smash you all
 with my rake and wipe the lot of you out.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this the demons were scared out of their wits. They fell to their
 knees in the water, kowtowed to him and said, &#8220;Please be kind, reverend
 sir. We were blind and we captured your master by mistake. Although we
 did hang him up we haven't tortured him. We beg you in your compassion
 to spare our lives. We'll gladly give you some money for the journey
 and send your master on his way to the Western Heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Cut that talk out,&#8221; said Pig, waving his hands. &#8220;It's quite right
 what they say: 'Once you've been tricked by a confectioner you won't
 believe sweet-talkers again.' I'm going to hit you with my rake, then
 we can all go our separate ways.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot was thoroughly rough and crude and wanted to show off his
 powers. He was unmoved by their fragrant feminine beauty. Raising his
 rake he charged them, lashing out wildly without caring what he was
 doing. The demons acted desperately. Forgetting about their modesty
 they cared only about saving their lives as covering their private
 parts with their hands they jumped out of the water and ran into the
 pavilion. Standing there they used magic to make thick silken ropes
 come out of their navels, filling the sky with a huge silken canopy
 under which Pig was caught. When the idiot looked up he could not see
 the sun in the heavens. He tried to run outside, but he could not lift
 his feet, which were tangled in silken ropes that covered the ground.
 When he tried to move his feet he tripped and staggered. He tried going
 left, but his head crashed to the ground, then tried going right and
 came a cropper. So he turned round as quickly as he could and kissed
 the dirt, got himself back on his feet, and collapsed head first once
 more. Goodness only knows how many times he stumbled and fell till his
 whole body was numb, his feet sore, his head aching and his eyes
 blurred. He could no longer even crawl, but lay groaning on the floor.
 Then the demons tied him up. They neither beat him up nor wounded him,
 but sprang outside to rush back to their cave, leaving the silken
 canopy to blot out the daylight.</P>
<P>When they reached the stone bridge they stopped and said the words of
 a spell. In an instant the silk canopy had been put away, and they all
 rushed stark naked into the cave, covering their private parts with
 their hands as they ran giggling past the Tang Priest.</P>
<P>Once inside their bedrooms carved out of the rock they put on old
 clothes and went straight to the back door of the cave, where they
 stood and called, &#8220;Where are you, children?&#8221;</P>
<P>Now each she-devil had a child, not one that she had borne, but an
 adopted child who had taken her as a mother. They were called Bee,
 Hornet, Cockroach, Spanish-fly, Grasshopper, Wax-insect and Dragonfly,
 for such they were. The evil spirits had spread their nets across the
 sky, caught these seven insects and been on the point of eating them.
 But as the old saying goes, &#8220;Birds have bird language and beasts have
 beast language.&#8221;</P>
<P>The insects had pleaded for their lives and volunteered to take the
 spirits as their own mothers. Ever since then they had gathered
 blossoms in the spring and summer flowers for the evil spirits, and as
 soon as they heard the shouts they appeared and asked, &#8220;What orders do
 you have for us, mothers?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Sons,&#8221; the demons replied, &#8220;this morning we made a mistake and
 provoked the monk from Tang. His disciples trapped us in the pool and
 disgraced us. We were almost killed. You must do your utmost. Go
 outside and drive them away. When you've beaten them come to your
 uncle's to meet us.&#8221; The she-devils then fled for their lives and went
 to the home of their teacher's senior disciple, where their wicked
 tongues were to give rise to more disasters, but of that we shall not
 now speak. Watch while the insects rub their fists in their hands and
 go out to confront their enemies.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Pig, meanwhile, whose head was spinning after falling over so often,
 looked up and suddenly saw that the silken canopy and ropes had all
 disappeared. Groping around he picked himself up, and despite his pain
 he made his way back the way he had come. As soon as he saw Monkey he
 grabbed him and said, &#8220;Brother, is my head bulging? Is my face all
 blue?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What happened to you?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Those damned creatures caught me under a silken net and tripped me
 up goodness knows how many times with silk ropes,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;My
 waist was twisted, my back felt broken and I couldn't move an inch.
 Then the silk canopy and the ropes all disappeared, so I could escape
 and come back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Forget about it,&#8221; said Friar Sand when he saw him, &#8220;forget about it.
 You asked for trouble. I'm sure the demons have all gone back to the
 cave to harm the master. We must go and rescue him straight away.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he set out at once as fast as he could and
 rushed back to the farm while Pig led the horse. Here the seven little
 devils could be seen standing on the bridge, blocking their way and
 saying, &#8220;Not so fast, not so fast. We're here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a joke!&#8221; said Pig when he saw them. &#8220;They're just a bunch of
 kids. They're only two foot five or six, well under three foot, and
 they can only weigh eight or nine pounds, not even ten.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; he shouted.</P>
<P>&#8220;We're the sons of the seven immortal ladies,&#8221; the little devils
 replied. &#8220;You've insulted our mothers, and now you've got the
 effrontery to attack us, you ignorant fools. Stay where you are, and
 watch out.&#8221; The splendid monsters then launched a wild onslaught on
 Pig, who was in a flaming temper after falling over so often. Seeing
 how tiny the insects were he lifted his rake to strike furious blows at
 them.</P>
<P>When the little devils saw how ferocious the idiot was they all
 reverted to their original forms, flew into the air and shouted,
 &#8220;Change!&#8221; In an instant each of them became ten, each ten became a
 hundred, each hundred became a thousand, and each thousand became ten
 thousand. Every one became a countless number. This is what could be
 seen:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The sky was full of wax-flies,</P>
<P>Dragonflies danced all over the land.</P>
<P>Bees and hornets went for the head,</P>
<P>Cockroaches jobbed at the eyes.</P>
<P>Spanish-flies bit before and behind,</P>
<P>While grasshoppers stung above and below.</P>
<P>His face was black and crawling with insects:</P>
<P>Even devils or deities would have been scared by their speed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig in alarm, &#8220;you can say what you like about it
 being easy to fetch the scriptures, but on this road to the West even
 the insects give you a bad time.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be afraid, brother,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Go for them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But they're flying into my head and my face and all over my body,&#8221;
 replied Pig. &#8220;They're at least ten layers deep and all stinging me. How
 can I go for them?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No problem,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;no problem. I know a trick.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Whatever it is, brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;use it right now. His
 shaven head has swollen up with those bites in no time at all.&#8221; The
 splendid Great Sage pulled out a handful of hairs, chewed them into
 little bits and blew them out, telling them to turn to golden eagles,
 falcons, hawks, white eagles, vultures, ospreys and sparrowhawks.
 &#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;what's that jargon about goldens and all that?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Something you don't know about,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Golden eagles,
 falcons, hawks, white eagles, vultures, ospreys and sparrowhawks are
 the seven birds of prey that my hairs turned into. That's because the
 she-devils' children are insects.&#8221; Because the birds were so good at
 catching insects they got one every time they opened their beaks,
 grabbed at them with their claws or struck them with their wings. They
 wiped all the insects out in an instant, leaving no trace of them in
 the sky. The ground was piled over a foot deep with their bodies.</P>
<P>Only then could the three brothers charge across the bridge and into
 the cave, where they found their master hanging groaning and sobbing in
 mid-air. &#8220;Master,&#8221; said Pig, going up to him, &#8220;are you hanging around
 here for fun? I don't know how many times I've had to fall over on your
 account.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Untie the master before we take this conversation any further,&#8221; said
 Friar Sand. Brother Monkey then snapped the ropes and set the master
 free, asking, &#8220;Where did the evil spirits go?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;All seven of them ran stark naked through to the back,&#8221; the Tang
 Priest replied. &#8220;They were calling for their sons.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;After them, brothers!&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Follow me!&#8221;</P>
<P>The three of them, each holding his weapon, went searching in the
 back garden, but no sign of them could be found. They looked for them
 without success under all the peach and plum trees. &#8220;They've gone,&#8221;
 said Pig, &#8220;they've gone.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We can stop looking for them,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;I'm going to help
 the master away from here.&#8221; The three brothers then went back to the
 front, where they asked the Tang Priest to mount up. &#8220;You two help the
 master along the way,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;I'm going to smash these buildings to
 the ground with my rake. Then they'll have nowhere to live when they
 come back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Smashing the place would be too much effort,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;The best
 way to cut off their roots would be to find some firewood.&#8221; The
 splendid idiot then gathered some dead pine, broken-off bamboo,
 dried-out willow and withered creepers that he set alight. The roaring
 blaze destroyed everything. Only then did master and disciples feel
 easy enough to be on their way.</P>
<P>If you don't know what of good or evil the demons were to do to them,
 listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

</B>
<P>The story tells how the Great Sage Sun supported the Tang Priest as
 they hurried along the main road to the West together with Pig and
 Friar Sand. Within a few hours they were in sight of a compound with
 many tall towers and imposing buildings. &#8220;Disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang,
 reining in his horse, &#8220;what's that place?&#8221; Monkey looked up to gaze at
 it and this is what he saw.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Tall towers girdled by hills,</P>
<P>Streams winding round pavilions.</P>
<P>Dense grew the wood in front of the gates,</P>
<P>And outside the buildings the scent of flowers hung heavy.</P>
<P>White egrets perched among the willows,</P>
<P>Like flawless jades half hidden in a mist;</P>
<P>Golden orioles sang in the peach-trees,</P>
<P>Flashes of gold in the fiery blossom.</P>
<P>Wild deer in couples</P>
<P>Trod lost to the world across cushions of greenery;</P>
<P>Pairs of mountain birds</P>
<P>Sang as they flew among the red tree-tops.</P>
<P>It was like the Tiantai Cave of Liu and Ruan,</P>
<P>And rivaled the home of the immortals in fairyland.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; Brother Monkey reported, &#8220;that's no princely palace or rich
 man's mansion. It looks like a Taoist temple or Buddhist monastery.
 We'll know for sure when we get there.&#8221; On hearing this Sanzang whipped
 on his horse, and when master and disciples reached the gates to look
 there was a stone tablet set over the gateway on which was written
 YELLOW FLOWER TEMPLE. Sanzang dismounted.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yellow Flower Temple means it's a Taoist place,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;so it's
 all right for us to go in and see them. Although we wear different
 clothes we cultivate our conduct the same way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;We can go in and have a look round,
 and at the same time the horse can have a feed. If it looks suitable we
 can arrange a meal for the master.&#8221;</P>
<P>The master accepted their suggestions and the four of them went
 inside. A couplet was pasted up on either side of the inner gates:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Palace of immortals: yellow shoots and white snow.</P>
<P>Home of men who can fly: rare and wonderful flowers.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;So the Taoist here refines drugs, plays with a furnace and totes a
 crucible,&#8221; said Monkey with a grin.</P>
<P>&#8220;Watch your words,&#8221; said Sanzang, giving him a pinch, &#8220;watch your
 words. We don't know them and they are no relations of ours. This is
 only a passing encounter. Never mind what they are like.&#8221; Before he had
 finished saying these words he went in through the inner gate, where he
 found the doors of the main hall shut tight and a Taoist master sitting
 under a covered walkway making elixir pills. Just look at how he was
 dressed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On his head a bright red hat all set with gold,</P>
<P>On his body a jet-black Taoist robe.</P>
<P>On his feet a pair of deep green cloud-treading shoes,</P>
<P>Round his waist a brilliant yellow Lu Dongbin sash.</P>
<P>His face was round like a golden melon,</P>
<P>His eyes like bright stars.</P>
<P>His nose was as big and as high as a Muslim's,</P>
<P>And his lips turned back like a Tartar's.</P>
<P>His heart, set on the Way, was hidden thunder;</P>
<P>He was a true immortal, subduer of tigers and dragons.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As soon as he saw him Sanzang shouted at the top of his voice, &#8220;My
 respectful greetings, venerable Taoist master.&#8221; The Taoist looked up
 with a start and was so alarmed by what he saw that he dropped the
 elixir on which he was working.</P>
<P>Then he neatened his hair-pins and clothes, came down the steps and
 greeted Sanzang: &#8220;Venerable sir, excuse me for failing to meet you.
 Please come inside and sit down.&#8221; The venerable elder happily went up
 into the main hall. On pushing the doors open he saw the statues of the
 Three Pure Ones and an altar on which stood incense burners and
 incense, so he planted some joss-sticks in the burner and performed a
 triple set of obeisances to the Pure Ones before bowing to the Taoist
 master. He then went to the guest seats, where he sat down with his
 disciples. Immortal boys were told to bring tea at once, whereupon two
 boys went inside to fetch the tea-tray, wash the teacups, wipe the
 teaspoons and prepare some refreshments to eat with it. Their rushing
 about soon disturbed the pilgrims' enemies.</P>
<P>Now the seven devils from Gossamer Cave had been fellow-students of
 the Taoist master here, and it was here that they had hurried after
 putting on their old clothes and calling for their sons. They were
 making themselves new clothes at the back of the temple when they
 noticed the boys preparing the tea and asked, &#8220;What visitors have
 arrived, boys? What are you in such a rush for?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Four Buddhist monks have just turned up,&#8221; the boys replied, &#8220;and the
 master has told us to prepare tea for them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Is one of the monks pale and fat?&#8221; the she-devils asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Does one of them have a long snout and big ears?&#8221; they asked again.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Then take the tea in as quickly as you can,&#8221; the she-devils said,
 &#8220;and tip your master a wink to come in here. We've got something urgent
 to say to him.&#8221;</P>
<P>The boys took five cups of tea out to the Taoist master, who tucked
 back his sleeves and passed a cup with both hands first to Sanzang and
 then to Pig, Friar Sand and Brother Monkey. After the tea had been
 drunk the cups were collected and the boys gave their master a look, at
 which he bowed and said, &#8220;Please sit down, gentlemen. Boys, put the
 tray down and keep them company. I have to go out. I'll be back.&#8221;
 Sanzang and his disciples went out of the hall to look around, guided
 by one boy.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the Taoist master went back to the abbot's lodgings the seven
 women all fell to their knees and said, &#8220;Brother, brother, please
 listen to what we have to say.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Taoist master helped them to their feet and said, &#8220;When you came
 here this morning you wanted to tell me something, but because of the
 elixir pills I was making I couldn't see any women. That's why I had to
 refuse. I have visitors out there now, so you can tell me later.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We have to report, elder brother,&#8221; the she-devils said, &#8220;that it's
 because the strangers are here that we're talking to you. If the
 strangers go away there'll be no point in telling you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What are you talking about, sisters?&#8221; the Taoist master said. &#8220;Why
 do you have to talk to me just now, when the strangers are here? Have
 you gone off your heads? I'm a man who lives in peace and quiet
 cultivating immortality, but even if I were a layman with wife and
 children and family responsibilities I'd wait till my visitor had left
 before attending to them. How can you be so ill-behaved and disgrace
 me? Now let me go.&#8221;</P>
<P>All the she-devils grabbed him and said, &#8220;Please don't lose your
 temper, elder brother. Tell us where the visitors come from.&#8221; The
 Taoist master pulled a long face and ignored them. &#8220;When the boys came
 in for the tea just now they told us the visitors are four Buddhist
 monks,&#8221; the she-devils said.</P>
<P>&#8220;They're monks,&#8221; said the Taoist master angrily, &#8220;what of it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Does one of the four monks have a pale, fat face,&#8221; the she-devils
 asked, &#8220;and one of them a long snout and big ears? Did you ask them
 where they're from?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the Taoist said, &#8220;there are two like that among them. How did
 you know? I suppose you've seen them somewhere.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't know the terrible things that have happened, brother,&#8221; the
 devils said. &#8220;That monk was sent by the Tang court to fetch the
 scriptures from the Western Heaven. He came to our cave this morning
 begging for food. We captured him because we'd heard of this Tang
 Priest.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why did you capture him?&#8221; the Taoist asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;We've long known that the Tang Priest has a pure body because he has
 cultivated his conduct for ten successive incarnations,&#8221; the devils
 replied. &#8220;Anyone who eats a piece of his flesh will live for ever.
 That's why we captured him. Later the monk with a long snout and big
 ears kept us in the Filth-cleansing Spring. First he stole our clothes
 and then he used his magical powers to insist on bathing with us. He
 jumped into the water and turned himself into a catfish. From the way
 he kept swimming around between our thighs he obviously had very
 improper ideas. He was thoroughly disgraceful. Then he jumped out of
 the water and turned back into himself. As we weren't going to let him
 have his way he tried to kill us all with his nine-pronged rake. If we
 hadn't known a thing or two he'd have murdered the lot of us. We fled
 in fear and trembling and sent your nephews into battle. We don't know
 whether they are alive or dead. We have come here to fling ourselves on
 your mercy and beg you to avenge your fellow-students from long ago.&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing this the Taoist was furious, as could be seen from his
 changed expression. &#8220;What outrageous monks!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;What
 hooligans! Don't you worry: I'm going to sort them out.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you're going to fight them,&#8221; said the she-devils in gratitude,
 &#8220;you must let us help you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There'll be no need to fight,&#8221; said the Taoist, &#8220;no need. As the
 saying goes, you have to lower yourself to fight someone. Come with
 me.&#8221;</P>
<P>The women went with him into his room, where he carried a ladder
 behind the bed, climbed up to the rafters and brought down a little
 leather box. It was eight inches high, a foot long, four inches wide
 and locked with a tiny brass lock. From his sleeve he produced a square
 handkerchief of goose-yellow silk, to the fringes of which a tiny key
 was tied. Unlocking the box he brought out a packet containing a drug.
 This drug was:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A thousand pounds of droppings</P>
<P>From all kinds of mountain birds,</P>
<P>Boiled in a copper cauldron,</P>
<P>Reduced on an even fire,</P>
<P>Till the thousand pounds were only a spoonful</P>
<P>That was then reduced to a third.</P>
<P>This was fried even longer,</P>
<P>Refined and smoked once again.</P>
<P>To make the poisonous drug,</P>
<P>More precious than treasures or jewels.</P>
<P>Were you to try out its flavor,</P>
<P>One taste would send yon to Hell.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Sisters,&#8221; said the Taoist master, &#8220;any mortal who eats one grain of
 this treasure of mine will be dead when it reaches his stomach. Only
 three grains would be enough to kill a god or an immortal. As these
 monks may have mastered something of the Way they'll need three grains.
 Fetch my balance.&#8221; One of the women brought a balance at once.</P>
<P>&#8220;Weigh out twelve grains,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and divide that into four
 portions.&#8221; Then he took twelve red jujubes, pinched holes in them,
 stuffed a grain of the drug in each, and put them into four teacups.
 These were then placed with a fifth cup containing two black jujubes on
 a tray.</P>
<P>&#8220;Let me question them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If they aren't from Tang that'll be
 the end of it; but if they are I'll ask for fresh tea and you can give
 this tea to the boys to bring in. Once they drink it they'll all die
 and you'll be avenged. That'll cheer you up.&#8221; The seven women were
 beside themselves with gratitude.</P>
<P>The Taoist changed into another robe and walked out again with a
 great show of feigned courtesy. He urged the Tang Priest and the others
 to sit down in the guest seats again. &#8220;Please excuse me, venerable
 sir,&#8221; the Taoist said. &#8220;The reason why I neglected you just now was
 because I was at the back telling my disciples to choose some greens
 and radishes to cook as a vegetarian meal for you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We Buddhist monks came empty-handed,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;We could not
 possibly trouble you for a meal.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We are all men of religion,&#8221; replied the Taoist master with a smile.
 &#8220;Whenever we go to a monastery or temple we are entitled to three pints
 of rice, so why talk of being empty-handed? May I ask you, reverend
 sir, what monastery you are from, and why you are here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have been sent by His Majesty the Great Tang emperor to fetch the
 scriptures from the Great Thunder Monastery in the Western Heaven,&#8221;
 Sanzang replied. &#8220;As we were passing your Taoist temple we came in to
 pay our respects.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this news the Taoist's face was full of animation, as he said, &#8220;It
 was only because I did not realize you were so faithful to the most
 virtuous Buddha that I failed to come out a long way to meet you.
 Please forgive me. Please forgive me.&#8221; Then he told the boys to bring
 fresh tea at once and get a meal ready as soon as possible, at which
 the boys went straight inside to fetch the tea.</P>
<P>&#8220;Here's some good tea that's all ready,&#8221; the women called to them.
 &#8220;Take this in.&#8221; The boys did indeed take the five cups in, and the
 Taoist master hurriedly passed a cup of red jujube tea to the Tang
 Priest. As Pig was so big the Taoist took him for the senior disciple,
 and he thought Friar Sand was the next senior. Thinking that Monkey was
 the junior one the Taoist only handed him his cup fourth. By the time
 the sharp-eyed Brother Monkey took his cup he had already noticed that
 there were two black jujubes in the cup left on the tray.</P>
<P>&#8220;Let's change cups, sir,&#8221; he said. &#8220;To be honest with you,&#8221; the
 Taoist replied with a smile, &#8220;as a poor Taoist living out here in the
 wilds I am rather short of tea and food at the moment. I was looking
 for fruit out at the back just now and I could only find these twelve
 red jujubes to put into four cups of tea to offer you. As I had to take
 something with you I made another cup with these inferior jujubes to
 keep you company. This is just a gesture of respect.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What nonsense,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile. &#8220;As the ancients said,
 'You are never poor if you are at home; but poverty on a journey is
 killing.' You're at home here, so why all this talk about being poor?
 It's wandering monks like us who are really poor. I'll swap with you. I
 insist.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said Sanzang when he heard this, &#8220;this immortal gentleman
 is being very hospitable. You have yours. There is no need for a swap.&#8221;
 Monkey had no choice. Taking the cup with his left hand he covered it
 with his right and watched them.</P>
<P>Pig, however, who apart from feeling hungry and thirsty had an
 enormous appetite at the best of times, picked the three red jujubes
 out of the cup as soon as he saw them and swallowed them noisily. The
 master ate his too, as did Friar Sand. In that very instant Pig's face
 changed color, tears started pouring from Friar Sand's eyes and the
 Tang Priest began to foam at the mouth. Unable to sit upright, all
 three of them fainted and fell to the floor.</P>
<P>Realizing that they had been poisoned, the Great Sage raised his
 teacup in his hands and threw it at the Taoist master's face. The
 Taoist stopped it with his sleeve and it shattered noisily as it fell
 to the floor. &#8220;You lout, monk,&#8221; said the Taoist in fury, &#8220;how dare you
 smash my cup?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Animal,&#8221; said Monkey abusively, &#8220;just look what you've done to those
 three! What have I ever done to you for you to give my people poisoned
 tea?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Beast,&#8221; said the Taoist master, &#8220;you asked for it. Don't you realize
 that?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We've only just come here and talked about things like where we
 should sit and where we're from,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;We didn't talk big. How
 can you say we asked for this trouble?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Did you beg for food in Gossamer Cave?&#8221; the Taoist master asked.
 &#8220;Did you bathe in the Filth-cleansing Spring?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There were seven she-devils in the Filth-cleansing Spring,&#8221; Monkey
 replied. &#8220;From what you're saying you must be in cahoots with them. I'm
 sure you're an evil spirit yourself. Stay where you are and take this!&#8221;
 The splendid Great Sage felt in his ear for his gold-banded cudgel,
 waved it to make it as thick as a rice-bowl, and struck at the Taoist
 master's face. The Taoist rapidly turned and dodged the blow, then
 produced a fine sword with which he fought back.</P>
<P>Their cursing and fighting had by now disturbed the seven she-devils
 inside, who all rushed out shouting, &#8220;Spare yourself the trouble, elder
 brother. Let us catch him.&#8221; At the sight of them Monkey became angrier
 than ever. Whirling his iron cudgel around with both hands he dropped
 his guard and tumbled in among them, lashing out wildly. The seven
 women then undid their clothes, revealing their white stomachs, and
 from their navels they produced by magic thick silken ropes that came
 reeling out in such abundance that they formed a canopy under which
 Brother Monkey was confined.</P>
<P>Seeing that things were going badly Monkey got up, said the words of
 a spell, did a somersault, smashed through the canopy and escaped. Then
 he stood gloomily in mid-air, controlling his temper and watching as
 the flashing silken ropes crisscrossed like the warp and weft of cloth
 on the loom. Within a moment the Yellow Flower Temple's towers and
 halls were all completely concealed. &#8220;Terrible,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;they're
 terrible. I've never been up against anything like that before. No
 wonder Pig fell over so often. What am I to do now? The master and my
 brothers have been poisoned. This gang of devils are all hand in glove,
 and I know nothing about their background. I'll go back and question
 that local god.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage brought his cloud down to land, made a spell
 with his fingers, said the sacred syllable<I> Om,</I> and forced the
 old local god to come to him again. The old deity knelt beside the
 path, trembling with fear and kowtowing as he said, &#8220;Great Sage, you
 went to rescue your master. Why are you back again?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I rescued him this morning,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and a little way ahead
 from there we reached a Yellow Flower Temple. When I went in with the
 master to look around, the head Taoist of the temple greeted us, and in
 the middle of our conversation he knocked out my master and the other
 two with poisoned tea. Luckily I didn't drink any, but when I was going
 to hit him with my cudgel he started talking about begging for food at
 Gossamer Cave and bathing at the Filth-cleansing Spring, so I knew he
 was a monster. No sooner had he raised his hand to fight back than the
 seven women came out and set off their silken ropes. It was a good
 thing I had the know-how to get away. I reckon that as you're a god who
 lives round here you're bound to know their background. What sort of
 evil spirit are they? Tell me the truth if you don't want to be hit.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's less than ten years since those evil spirits came here,&#8221; said
 the local deity, kowtowing. &#8220;When I was making an inspection three
 years ago I saw what they really are: seven spider spirits. The silken
 ropes that come out of them are spiders' webs.&#8221;</P>
<P>The news thoroughly delighted Monkey, who said, &#8220;From what you tell
 me they're no problem. Very well then. You can go back while I use
 magic to subdue him.&#8221; The local god kowtowed and went.</P>
<P>Monkey then went to the outside of the Yellow Flower Temple, pulled
 seventy hairs out of his tail, blew on them with magic breath and
 shouted, &#8220;Change!&#8221; The hairs turned into seventy little Monkeys. He
 then blew a magic breath on his gold-banded cudgel, called &#8220;Change!&#8221;
 and turned it into seventy two-pronged forks, one of which he gave to
 each of the little Monkeys. Monkey himself used one of the forks to
 twist the silken ropes as he stood outside, then they all attacked
 together to the rhythm of a tune, tearing the ropes to pieces, each of
 them tearing off over ten pounds of rope. They dragged seven spiders
 out from inside. Each was about the size of a wicker basket. All of
 them held their hands and feet together and had ropes round their
 necks.</P>
<P>&#8220;Spare us, spare us,&#8221; they said. The seventy little Monkeys then
 pressed the seven spiders to the ground, refusing to let them go.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't hit them,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;All we want is to make them give my
 master and my brothers back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Elder Brother,&#8221; shrieked the demons at the tops of their voices,
 &#8220;give the Tang Priest back and save our lives.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Taoist master rushed outside saying, &#8220;Sisters, I'm going to eat
 the Tang Priest. I can't save you.&#8221;</P>
<P>This infuriated Brother Monkey. &#8220;If you won't give my master back
 just watch what happens to your sisters.&#8221; The splendid Great Sage waved
 his fork, turned it back into an iron cudgel that he lifted with both
 hands and smashed the seven spider spirits to pulp. Then he shook his
 tail a couple of times, put the hairs back on it and charged inside
 alone, swinging his cudgel to fight the Taoist master.</P>
<P>When the Taoist master saw Monkey kill his seven fellow-students it
 was more than he could bear. Goaded to fury, he raised his sword to
 fight back. In this battle each of them was seething with anger and
 giving full play to his divine powers. It was a fine battle:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The evil spirit swung a fine sword;</P>
<P>The Great Sage raised his gold-banded cudgel.</P>
<P>Both were fighting for Sanzang of the Tang,</P>
<P>On whose account the seven women had been killed.</P>
<P>Now they were fighting with all-round skill,</P>
<P>Showing their mighty powers with their weapons.</P>
<P>Powerful was the Great Sage's aura,</P>
<P>And rough the courage of the evil immortal.</P>
<P>Their vigorous moves were as rich as brocade,</P>
<P>And both hands moved as fast as a windlass.</P>
<P>Noisily clanged the sword and cudgel,</P>
<P>And ominously pale were the floating clouds.</P>
<P>Few were the words they spoke</P>
<P>As they used their cunning,</P>
<P>Moving to and fro like brush-strokes in a painting.</P>
<P>The wind and dust they raised scared wolves and tigers;</P>
<P>The stars disappeared as heaven and earth went dark.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the Taoist master had fought fifty or sixty rounds with the
 Great Sage he felt his hand weakening and his sinews getting slack, so
 he undid his belt and with a loud flapping noise took off his black
 robe. &#8220;Well, my lad,&#8221; said the Great Sage with a laugh, &#8220;if you can't
 beat me you still won't be able to when you strip off.&#8221; Once the Taoist
 master had stripped off his clothes he raised both hands to reveal
 under his ribs a thousand eyes flashing golden light. It was terrible:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Dense yellow smoke,</P>
<P>Brilliant golden light.</P>
<P>The dense yellow smoke</P>
<P>Gushed out as clouds from under his ribs;</P>
<P>The brilliant golden light</P>
<P>Came from a thousand eyes like fire.</P>
<P>To left and right they seemed like golden pails;</P>
<P>To East and West they resembled bells of bronze.</P>
<P>Thus an evil immortal used his magic power,</P>
<P>A Taoist master showed divine ability,</P>
<P>Dazzling the eyes, blotting out sun, moon and sky,</P>
<P>Blanketing people with acrid vapors.</P>
<P>The Great Sage Equaling Heaven</P>
<P>Was caught in the golden light and yellow smoke.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey started lashing out desperately with his hands and feet, but
 could only spin around inside the golden light, unable to take a step
 either forwards or backwards. It was as if he were turning round and
 round in a bucket. It was hopeless. He was unbearably hot. In his
 anxiety he leapt into the air, smashing against the golden light, and
 crashing head first to the ground. His head ached where he had hit it,
 and felt anxiously to find that the top of his scalp was tender.</P>
<P>&#8220;What lousy luck,&#8221; he though, &#8220;what lousy luck. This head's useless
 today. Usually swords and axes can't hurt it, so why has golden light
 bruised it now? After a while it's bound to go septic, and even if it
 does get better I might have tetanus.&#8221; He was still feeling unbearably
 hot. &#8220;I can't move forward or back,&#8221; he thought, working out a plan,
 &#8220;or to left or right, and I can't smash my way through by going up.
 Whatever shall I do? I'll damn well have to get out by going down.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage said the words of a spell, shook himself, and
 turned into one of those scaly diggers called pangolins. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Four sets of iron claws</P>
<P>Dug through the mountain, smashing rocks like powder.</P>
<P>The scales covering his body</P>
<P>Carved through ridges and crags like slicing scallions.</P>
<P>His eyes were as bright</P>
<P>As two gleaming stars;</P>
<P>His mouth was sharper</P>
<P>Than a steel drill or brazen auger.</P>
<P>He was the scaly mountain-borer used in medicine,</P>
<P>The creature known as the pangolin.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Watch him as he burrows into the ground with his head, not coming out
 again till he has covered over six miles. The golden light could only
 enclose about three miles. When he emerged and turned back into himself
 he was exhausted. His muscles ached, his whole body was in pain, and he
 could not help weeping. Suddenly he burst out with, &#8220;Master,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Since leaving the mountain and joining the faith</P>
<P>I've worked very hard on our way to the West.</P>
<P>The waves of the ocean are nothing to fear,</P>
<P>But in this dry gulch I've come out second best.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Just as the Handsome Monkey King was feeling miserable the sound of
 sobs could suddenly be heard from the other side of the mountain.
 Leaning forward and drying his tears he turned to look. A woman
 appeared, dressed in deep mourning and sobbing at every step as she
 came from the other side of the mountain. She was holding a dish of
 cold rice gruel in her left hand and several pieces of yellow paper
 money for burning to the dead in her right. Monkey sighed and nodded as
 he said to himself, &#8220;This is a case of</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Weeping eyes meeting weeping eyes,</P>
<P>One broken heart coming across another.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I wonder what this woman is crying about. I'll ask her.&#8221; Before long
 the woman was coming along the path towards him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Lady Bodhisattva,&#8221; asked Brother Monkey with a bow, &#8220;who are you
 weeping for?&#8221;</P>
<P>Through her tears the woman replied, &#8220;My husband was murdered by the
 master of the Yellow Flower Temple with poisoned tea because he got
 into a quarrel with him over the purchase of some bamboo poles. I'm
 going to burn this paper money as a mark of my love for him.&#8221;</P>
<P>This made Monkey's tears flow. The sight made the woman say angrily,
 &#8220;You ignorant fool. I'm grieving over my husband, but what business do
 you have to be weeping and looking so miserable? Are you mocking me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please don't be angry, Bodhisattva,&#8221; said Monkey with a bow. &#8220;I'm
 Sun Wukong the Novice, the senior disciple of Tang Sanzang, the younger
 brother of the Great Tang Emperor in the East. When we passed the
 Yellow Flower Temple on our way to the Western Heaven we stopped to
 rest, but the Taoist master there is some kind of evil spirit who's the
 sworn brother of seven spider spirits. When the spider spirits wanted
 to kill my master in Gossamer Cave I and my brother disciples Pig and
 Friar Sand managed to save him. The spider spirits fled to the Taoist's
 place and told him a pack of lies about us bullying them, so the Taoist
 knocked out my master and brothers. The three of them and the horse are
 now prisoners in his temple. I was the only one who didn't drink the
 tea. I smashed the cup and he attacked me. Because of the noise the
 seven spider spirits rushed outside to give out their silken ropes and
 catch me in the web they wove. I only got away by magic. After I'd
 found out who they really were I used my power of giving myself extra
 bodies to tear the silken ropes to pieces, drag the demons out and beat
 them to death. The Taoist master wanted revenge, so he went for me with
 his sword. When we'd gone sixty rounds he fled beaten, took off his
 clothes, and used the thousand eyes he has under his ribs to give off
 countless beams of golden light. I was caught under them, unable to
 move forwards or backwards, so I turned into a pangolin and burrowed my
 way out underground. It was when I was feeling thoroughly depressed
 that I heard you weeping, which was why I asked you those questions.
 When I saw that you had paper money to give your husband I felt
 wretched and miserable because I've got nothing for my master when he
 dies. Making fun of you was the last thing on my mind!&#8221;</P>
<P>Putting down the gruel and the paper money the woman returned Brother
 Monkey's bow and said, &#8220;Please forgive me. I didn't realize that you
 were a sufferer too. From what you've just said you don't know who that
 Taoist is. He's really the Demon King Hundred-eye, who's also known as
 the Many-eyed Monster. You must have tremendous magical powers to have
 escaped from the golden light and fought so long, but you couldn't get
 near him. I'll tell you about a sage you can send for who would be able
 to smash the golden light and defeat the Taoist.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey's immediate response was to chant a &#8220;na-a-aw&#8221; of respect and
 say, &#8220;If you know the sage's background, lady Bodhisattva, may I
 trouble you to tell me about it? If there is such a sage I'll fetch him
 to rescue my master and avenge your husband.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll tell you,&#8221; the woman said, &#8220;and you can fetch the sage, who
 will subdue the Taoist, but that will only bring revenge. I'm afraid
 the sage won't be able to rescue your master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;His poison is truly lethal,&#8221; the woman
 replied. &#8220;When people are laid low by it the very marrow of their bones
 rots within three days. I'm afraid that by the time you've been to see
 the sage and come back again you'll be too late to save him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I know how to travel,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;However far it is I'll only
 take half a day.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you can travel then listen to this,&#8221; the woman said. &#8220;About three
 hundred miles from here there's a mountain called Mount Purple Clouds,
 and in the mountain there's a Thousand Flower Cave where there lives a
 sage called Vairambha who will be able to defeat that demon.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where's the mountain?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;Which direction should I
 take?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's due South of here,&#8221; the woman replied, pointing; and by the
 time Brother Monkey looked back at her she had disappeared.</P>
<P>Monkey quickly did a kowtow and said, &#8220;Which Bodhisattva was that?
 After all that burrowing you disciple was feeling too stupid to
 recognize you. I beg you to tell me your name so that I can thank you.&#8221;
 At this there came a shout from mid-air, &#8220;Great Sage, it's me.&#8221; Monkey
 quickly looked up to see that it was the Old Lady of Mount Li. Catching
 up with her in the sky he thanked her with the words, &#8220;Where have you
 come from to give me these instructions?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;On my way back from Dragon Flower Assembly I noticed that your
 master was in trouble,&#8221; the Old Lady replied. &#8220;It was to save his life
 that I pretended to be a woman in mourning for her husband. Hurry up
 and fetch the sage. But don't tell her I sent you: she is rather
 difficult.&#8221;</P>
<P>Thanking her, Monkey took his leave and set off straight away on his
 somersault cloud. Once at Mount Purple Clouds he brought his cloud down
 and saw the Thousand Flower Cave. Outside the cave:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Blue pines masked the splendid view,</P>
<P>Turquoise cypresses surrounded the immortal's home.</P>
<P>Green willows were packed close along the mountain paths,</P>
<P>Rare flowers filled the watercourses.</P>
<P>Orchids grew all around stone buildings,</P>
<P>And scented blooms gave color to the crags.</P>
<P>Flowing water linked ravines with green,</P>
<P>While clouds enclosed the emptiness of trees.</P>
<P>Noisily sang wild birds.</P>
<P>Slowly strolled the deer,</P>
<P>Elegant grew the bamboo,</P>
<P>And all the red plums were open.</P>
<P>Rooks perched in ancient woods,</P>
<P>While spring birds chirped in the tree of heaven.</P>
<P>Summer wheat filled spreading acres,</P>
<P>And autumn millet grew all over the land.</P>
<P>No leaf fell in all four seasons.</P>
<P>And flowers bloomed throughout the year.</P>
<P>Auspicious rosy glows joined with the Milky Way,</P>
<P>And clouds of good omen were linked with the Great Emptiness.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Great Sage was delighted as he went inside, seeing boundless
 beauty at every stage. He went straight on, but found it deserted and
 completely silent. Not even a chicken or a dog could be heard. &#8220;I think
 that this sage must be out.&#8221; Monkey thought. When he had gone a mile or
 two further on he saw a Taoist nun sitting on a couch. This is what she
 looked like:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>She wore a five-flowered hat of brocade,</P>
<P>And a robe of golden silk.</P>
<P>Her cloud-treading shoes were patterned with phoenixes</P>
<P>And round her waist was a sash with double tassels.</P>
<P>Her face looked as old as autumn after a frost,</P>
<P>But her voice was as charming as swallows in the spring.</P>
<P>Long had she mastered the Dharma of Three Vehicles,</P>
<P>And she was ever mindful of the Four Truths.</P>
<P>She knew true achievement, that emptiness is empty,</P>
<P>And through her training had acquired great freedom.</P>
<P>She was the Buddha of the Thousand Flower Cave,</P>
<P>The illustrious Vairambha of great fame.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey went straight up to her without stopping and said, &#8220;Greetings,
 Bodhisattva Vairambha.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Bodhisattva then came down from her couch, put her hands together
 to return his greeting and said, &#8220;Great Sage, it was remiss of me not
 to come out to greet you. Where have you come from?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How do you know that I'm the Great Sage?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;When you made havoc in Heaven the other year,&#8221; Vairambha replied,
 &#8220;your picture was circulated everywhere. That's why everyone can
 recognize you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How true it is,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;that</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>While good deeds stay at home</P>
<P>Bad deeds are known far and wide.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Take my conversion to Buddhism, for example. You didn't know about
 that.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Congratulations,&#8221; said Vairambha. &#8220;When did that happen?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Not long ago my life was spared to escort my master the Tang Priest
 on his journey to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures,&#8221; Monkey
 replied. &#8220;My master has been laid low with poisoned tea by the Taoist
 of the Yellow Flower Temple. When I was fighting with him he caught me
 in his golden light, and I had to use magic to escape. I have come here
 to pay you my respects, Bodhisattva, and ask your help because I've
 heard that you are able to destroy his golden light.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Who told you that?&#8221; the Bodhisattva asked. &#8220;I have not left here
 since the Ullambana assembly over three hundred years ago. I've lived
 in complete secrecy and nobody has heard of me, so how is it that you
 know of me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm an underground devil,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and I can make my own
 enquiries anywhere at all.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; Vairambha said, &#8220;never mind. I shouldn't really go, but
 as you have honoured me with a visit, Great Sage, and as the great
 cause of fetching the scriptures must not be allowed to fail I'll go
 with you.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey thanked her and said, &#8220;It's very ignorant of me to hurry you
 along in this way. I wonder what weapon you use.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have an embroidery needle that will put an end to that damned
 creature,&#8221; said the Bodhisattva.</P>
<P>This was too much for Monkey. &#8220;Old Lady, you've been wasting my
 time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Had I known it was an embroidery needle I wouldn't
 have had to trouble you. I could have provided a hundredweight of
 them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your embroidery needles are all made of iron, steel or gold,&#8221; the
 Bodhisattva replied. &#8220;They're no use. My treasure isn't iron and isn't
 steel and isn't gold. It was tempered by my son in the sun.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Who is he?&#8221; asked Monkey. &#8220;He is the Star Lord of the Mane,&#8221;
 Vairambha replied.</P>
<P>This came as a shock to Monkey, who gazed at the golden light then
 turned to Vairambha and said, &#8220;The Yellow Flower Temple is where that
 golden light is coming from.&#8221; Vairambha then took from the lapel of her
 gown an embroidery needle about the thickness of an eyebrow hair and
 half an inch long. Holding it between her fingers she threw it into the
 air. A few moments later there was a loud noise and the golden light
 was shattered.</P>
<P>&#8220;That's wonderful, Bodhisattva, wonderful!&#8221; exclaimed a delighted
 Monkey. &#8220;Let's find your needle now.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Isn't this it here?&#8221; asked Vairambha, who was holding it in her
 hand. Brother Monkey brought his cloud down to land with hers and went
 into the temple, where he found the Taoist with his eyes shut, unable
 to move. &#8220;Stop playing blind, damned demon,&#8221; he said abusively, taking
 his cudgel from his ear ready to hit the Taoist with.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't hit him, Great Sage,&#8221; said Vairambha. &#8220;Go and see your
 master.&#8221;</P>
<P>On going straight to the reception room at the back Monkey found the
 three of them bringing up mucus and spittle where they lay on the
 floor. &#8220;What am I to do?&#8221; wept Monkey. &#8220;What am I to do?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't grieve, Great Sage,&#8221; said Vairambha. &#8220;As I've come out today I
 think I might as well accumulate some merit by giving you three of
 these pills that are an antidote to the poison.&#8221; Monkey turned round to
 bow down and beg her for them, whereupon she produced a torn paper
 packet from her sleeve containing three red pills that she handed to
 Monkey, telling him to put one in each of their mouths. This he did,
 forcing their teeth apart. A few moments later they all started
 vomiting as the drug reached their stomachs, bringing up the poison and
 coming back to life. Pig was the first to scramble to his feet.</P>
<P>&#8220;I feel suffocated,&#8221; he said. Sanzang and Friar Sand both came round
 too, saying that they felt very dizzy.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your tea was poisoned,&#8221; Brother Monkey explained. &#8220;It was the
 Bodhisattva Vairambha who saved you. Hurry up and bow to her in
 thanks.&#8221; Sanzang bowed to her to show his gratitude as he straightened
 up his clothes.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;where's that Taoist? I've got some questions to
 ask him about why he tried to murder me.&#8221; Monkey then told him all
 about the spider spirits.</P>
<P>&#8220;If spider spirits are his sisters that damned creature must be an
 evil spirit too,&#8221; said Pig with fury.</P>
<P>&#8220;He's standing outside the main hall pretending to be blind,&#8221; said
 Monkey, pointing.</P>
<P>Pig grabbed his rake and was about to hit the Taoist with it when
 Vairambha stopped him and said, &#8220;Control your temper, Marshal Tian
 Peng. As the Great Sage knows, I have no servants in my cave. I am
 going to take him as my doorkeeper.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We are deeply indebted to your great power,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and we
 will of course obey. But we would like you to turn him back into his
 real self so that we can have a look at him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Easily done,&#8221; said Vairambha, stepping forward and pointing at the
 Taoist, who collapsed into the dust and reverted to his real form of a
 giant centipede spirit seven feet long. Picking him up with her little
 finger Vairambha rode her auspicious cloud straight back to the
 Thousand Flower Cave. &#8220;That old lady's a real terror,&#8221; said Pig,
 looking up. &#8220;How did she manage to subdue that evil creature?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When I asked her what weapon she had to smash the golden light
 with,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;she told me about a golden embroidery needle of
 hers that her son had tempered in the sun. When I asked her who her son
 was she told me he was the Star Lord of the Mane. As I remember, the
 Mane Star is a cock, so his mother must be a hen. Hens are very good at
 dealing with centipedes, which is why she could subdue him.&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing this Sanzang performed no end of kowtows. &#8220;Disciples,&#8221; he
 ordered, &#8220;go and get things ready.&#8221; Friar Sand then went inside to find
 some rice and prepare a vegetarian meal, so that they could all eat
 their fill. Then they led the horse up, shouldered the carrying-pole,
 and asked the master to set out. Monkey started a blaze in the kitchen
 that in an instant burnt the whole temple to ashes. He then set out on
 his way. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Tang Priest thanked Vairambha for saving his life;</P>
<P>The emotions were eliminated and the Many-eyed Monster removed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As for what happened on the way ahead, listen to the explanations in
 the next installment.</P>

</I>
<P>Li Changgeng Reports the Demons' Vicious Nature</P>
<P>The Novice Displays His Powers of Transformation</P>
</B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Emotions and desires are in origin all the same;</P>
<P>Both emotions and desires are completely natural.</P>
<P>Many a gentleman refines himself in the Buddhist faith;</P>
<P>When desire and emotions are forgotten, dhyana conies.</P>
<P>Don't be impatient; be firm of heart;</P>
<P>Be free of dust like the moon in the sky.</P>
<P>Make no mistake in your labors and your progress;</P>
<P>When your efforts are completed you will be an enlightened immortal.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story tells how Sanzang and his disciples, having broken through
 the net of desires and escaped from the prison-house of the emotions,
 let the horse travel West. Before they had been going for very long the
 summer was over and the new coolness of early autumn was refreshing
 their bodies. What they saw was:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Driving rains sweeping away the last of the heat,</P>
<P>Alarming the leaf of the parasol tree.</P>
<P>At evening glow-worms flew by the sedge path</P>
<P>While crickets sang beneath the moon.</P>
<P>The golden mallows opened in the dew;</P>
<P>Red knotweed covered the sandbanks.</P>
<P>Rushes and willows were the first to lose their leaves</P>
<P>As cold cicadas sang in tune.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As Sanzang was travelling along a high mountain appeared in front of
 him. Its peak thrust up into the azure void, touching the stars and
 blocking out the sun. In his alarm the venerable elder said to Monkey,
 &#8220;Look at that mountain in front of us. It's very high. I don't know
 whether the path will take us across.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a thing to say, Master,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile. &#8220;As the old
 saying goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>However high the mountain there will be a way across;</P>
<P>However deep the river there's always a ferryman.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>There's no reason why we shouldn't get over it. Stop worrying and
 carry on.&#8221; When Sanzang heard this his face broke out in smiles and he
 whipped his horse forward to climb straight up the high crag.</P>
<P>After a mile or two an old man appeared. His white hair was tangled
 and flying in the wind while his sparse whiskers were being blown about
 like silver threads. He wore a string of prayer-beads round his neck
 and held a dragon-headed walkingstick as he stood far away at the top
 of the slope shouting, &#8220;Venerable gentleman travelling West, stop your
 worthy steed. Rein in. There is a band of demons on this mountain who
 have eaten all the people in the continent of Jambu. Go no further!&#8221;</P>
<P>At this Sanzang turned pale with terror, and because the horse was
 not standing steadily and he himself was not well seated in the carved
 saddle he crashed to the ground and lay in the grass, moaning but
 unable to move.</P>
<P>Monkey went over to help him to his feet with the words, &#8220;Don't be
 afraid, don't be afraid. I'm here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Did you hear the old man up on the crag telling us that there's a
 band of demons on this mountain who have eaten everyone in the
 continent of Jambu?&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;Who'll dare go to ask him what this
 is really all about?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Sit there while I go and ask him,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;With your ugly face and coarse language I'm afraid you may shock
 him,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;so you won't get the truth from him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll make myself a bit better looking before questioning him,&#8221;
 laughed Brother Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Do a change to show me,&#8221; said Sanzang, and the splendid Great Sage
 made a spell with his fingers, shook himself, and turned into a very
 neat little monk, clear-eyed, fine-browed, round-headed and regular of
 features. He moved in a most refined way and said nothing vulgar when
 he opened his mouth.</P>
<P>Brushing his brocade tunic he stepped forward and said to the Tang
 Priest, &#8220;Master, have I changed for the better?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the delighted Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;Marvellous,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;but the rest of us look shabby by
 comparison. Even if I rolled around for two or three years on end I
 couldn't make myself look as elegant as that.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage left them behind as he went straight up to
 the old man, bowed to him and said, &#8220;Greetings, venerable sir.&#8221; Seeing
 how young and cultivated he looked, the old man returned his greeting
 and stroked his head in an offhand way.</P>
<P>&#8220;Little monk,&#8221; the old man said with a smile, &#8220;where have you come
 from?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We are from the Great Tang in the East,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;going to
 worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures. When we came here and
 heard you tell us that there are demons here my master was terrified.
 He sent me to ask you about them. What sort of evil spirits would dare
 go in for that sort of crime? I would trouble you, venerable sir, to
 tell me all the details so that I can put them in their place and send
 them on their way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're much too young, little monk,&#8221; said the old man with a smile,
 &#8220;to know what's good for you. Your remarks aren't helpful. Those evil
 spirits have tremendous magical powers. How can you have the nerve to
 talk of putting them in their place and sending them on their way?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;From what you are saying,&#8221; Monkey replied with a smile, &#8220;you seem to
 be trying to protect them. You must be a relation of theirs, or else a
 neighbour or a friend. Why else would you be promoting their prestige
 and boosting their morale, and refusing to pour out everything you know
 about their background?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You certainly know how to talk, monk,&#8221; said the old man, nodding and
 smiling. &#8220;I suppose you must have learned some magic arts while
 travelling with your master. Perhaps you know how to drive away and
 capture goblins, or have exorcised people's houses for them. But you've
 never come up against a really vicious monster.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What sort of vicious?&#8221; Monkey said.</P>
<P>&#8220;If those evil spirits send a letter to Vulture Mountain the five
 hundred arhats all come out to meet them,&#8221; the old man said. &#8220;If they
 send a note to the Heavenly Palace the Ten Bright Shiners all turn out
 to pay their respects. The dragons of the Four Oceans were their
 friends and they often meet the immortals of the Eight Caves. The Ten
 Kings of the Underworld call them brothers; the local gods and city
 gods are good friends of theirs.</P>
<P>When the Great Sage heard this he could not help bursting into loud
 guffaws. &#8220;Stop talking,&#8221; he said, grabbing hold of the old man, &#8220;stop
 talking. Even if that demon is friends with all those young
 whippersnappers, my juniors, that's nothing really remarkable. If he
 knew I was coming he'd clear off the same night.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're talking nonsense, little monk,&#8221; the old man said. &#8220;How can
 any of those sages be juniors and young whippersnappers to you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;To be truthful with you,&#8221; Monkey replied with a grin, &#8220;my people
 have lived for many generations in the Water Curtain Cave on the
 Mountain of Flowers and Fruit in the land of Aolai. My name is Sun
 Wukong. In the old days I used to be an evil spirit too and did some
 great things. Once I fell asleep after drinking too much at a feast
 with the other demons and dreamed that two men came to drag me off to
 the World of Darkness. I got so angry that I wounded the demon judges
 with my gold-banded cudgel. The kings of the Underworld were terrified
 and I practically turned the Senluo Palace upside-down. The judges in
 charge of the case were so scared that they fetched some paper for the
 Ten Kings to sign. They promised to treat me as their senior if I let
 them off a beating.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Amitabha Buddha!&#8221; exclaimed the old man when he heard this. &#8220;If you
 talk big like that you won't be able to grow any older.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm old enough, fellow,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;How old are you then?&#8221; the old man asked. &#8220;Guess,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Six or seven,&#8221; the old man said. &#8220;I'm ten thousand times as old as
 that,&#8221; laughed Monkey, &#8220;I'll show you my old face, then you'll believe
 me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you have another face?&#8221; the old man asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;This little monk has seventy-two faces,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>Not realizing that Monkey really had these powers the old man went on
 questioning him till Monkey rubbed his face and turned back into
 himself, with his protruding teeth, big mouth, red thighs and tigerskin
 kilt round his waist. As he stood there at the foot of the rocky scar,
 holding his gold-banded cudgel, he was the living image of a thunder
 god. The sight of him made the old man turn pale with terror and go so
 weak at the knees that he could not keep himself upright but collapsed
 to the ground. When he got to his feet again he lost his balance once
 more.</P>
<P>&#8220;Old man,&#8221; said the Great Sage, going up to him, &#8220;don't get yourself
 so frightened over nothing. I may look evil but I'm good inside. Don't
 be afraid! You were kind enough just now to tell us that there are
 demons here. Could I trouble you to let me know how many of them there
 are? I'll thank you very much if you do.&#8221; The old man trembled, unable
 to speak and acting as if deaf. He replied not a word.</P>
<P>Getting no answer from him, Monkey went back down the slope.</P>
<P>&#8220;So you are back, Wukong,&#8221; Sanzang said. &#8220;What did you find out?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's nothing,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile, &#8220;nothing. Even if there are
 one or two evil spirits on the way to the Western Heaven, the people
 here only worry so much about them because they're such cowards. No
 problem! I'm here!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Did you ask him what mountain this was and what cave,&#8221; said Sanzang,
 &#8220;how many monsters there are, and which is the way to Thunder
 Monastery?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please excuse me if I speak frankly, Master,&#8221; put in Pig. &#8220;When it
 comes to transformations, trickery and deception, then four or five of
 us would be no match for Brother Monkey. But a whole parade of Monkeys
 couldn't touch me for honesty.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's right,&#8221; said the Tang Priest, &#8220;that's right. You're honest.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Goodness knows why,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;but he just rushed in without a
 second thought, asked a couple of questions, and came running back in
 an awful mess. I'm going to find out the truth.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do be careful, Wuneng,&#8221; said the Tang Priest.</P>
<P>The splendid idiot put his rake in his belt, straightened up his
 tunic, and swaggered straight up the slope to call to the old man,
 &#8220;Respectful greetings, sir.&#8221; The old man had finally managed to get
 back on his feet with the help of his stick after seeing that Monkey
 had gone, and was still shaking and about to depart when Pig suddenly
 appeared.</P>
<P>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; he said, more shocked than ever, &#8220;whatever kind of nightmare
 am I in the middle of? The first monk was ugly enough, but at least he
 looked a little bit human. But this one's got a snout like a pestle,
 ears like rush fans, a face like iron plates, and a neck covered in
 bristles. It doesn't look at all human.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You must be in a very bad mood to run me down like that, old man,&#8221;
 laughed Pig. &#8220;Is that how you see me? Ugly I may be, but if you can
 bear to look at me for a while you'll find I get quite handsome.&#8221;</P>
<P>Only when the old man heard Pig using human speech did he address him
 by asking, &#8220;Where are you from?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm the Tang Priest's second disciple,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;and my
 Buddhist names are Wuneng or Bajie. The one who came and asked you
 questions just now was Sun Wukong the Novice, the senior disciple. My
 master has sent me to pay my respects to you because he's angry with
 Sun Wukong for offending you and not finding out the truth. Could you
 please tell me, sir, what mountain this is, what caves there are on it,
 what demons live in them, and which is the main route West?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Are you honest?&#8221; the old man asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I've never been false in all my life,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;You mustn't
 talk a whole lot of fancy nonsense like the other monk just now,&#8221; said
 the old man.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm not like him,&#8221; Pig replied.</P>
<P>Leaning on his stick, the old man said to Pig, &#8220;This is Lion Ridge,
 and it is 250 miles around. In it there is a Lion Cave where there are
 three demon chieftains.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're worrying over nothing, old man,&#8221; said Pig, spitting. &#8220;Why go
 to all that trouble just to tell us about three demons?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Aren't you afraid?&#8221; the old man said.</P>
<P>&#8220;To tell you the truth,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;my elder brother'll kill one
 with one swing of his cudgel, I'll kill another with one bash from my
 rake, and the other disciple will kill the third one with his
 demon-quelling staff. And with the three of them dead our master will
 be able to cross the ridge. No problem!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't know the whole story, monk,&#8221; said the old man with a
 smile. &#8220;Those three demon chiefs have the most tremendous magic powers.
 As for the little demons under their command, there are five thousand
 on the Southern end of the ridge, five thousand on the Northern end,
 ten thousand on the road East, ten thousand on the road West, four or
 five thousand patrollers, and another ten thousand on the gates. Then
 there are any number who work in the kitchen and gather firewood. There
 must be 47,000 or 48,000 altogether. They all have names and carry
 passes, and all they do is eat people.&#8221;</P>
<P>On learning this the idiot ran back, shivering and shaking. As soon
 as he was near the Tang Priest he put down his rake and started
 shitting instead of reporting back. &#8220;What are you squatting there for
 instead of making your report?&#8221; shouted Monkey when he saw the idiot.</P>
<P>&#8220;Because I'm shit scared,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;No time to talk now. The
 sooner we all run for our lives the better.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stupid fool,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I wasn't frightened when I questioned
 him, so why should you be in such a witless panic?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What is the situation?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The old man says that this is Lion Mountain,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;and that
 there's Lion Cave in it. There are three chief demons there, and they
 have 48,000 little devils under them. All they do is eat people. So if
 we step on their mountain we'll just be serving ourselves up as a meal
 to them. Let's forget about it.&#8221; On hearing this Sanzang shivered, his
 hairs standing on end.</P>
<P>&#8220;What are we to do, Wukong?&#8221; he asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry, Master,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;It can't be anything much. There
 are bound to be a few evil spirits here. It's just that the people here
 are such cowards that they exaggerate about how many demons there are
 and how powerful they are. They get themselves into a funk. I can
 cope.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're talking nonsense, brother,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;I'm not like you. What
 I found out was the truth. I wasn't making any of it up. The hills and
 valleys are all crawling with demons. How are we going to move ahead?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're talking like an idiot,&#8221; said Monkey with a grin. Don't scare
 yourself over nothing. Even if the hills and valleys were crawling with
 demons I'd only need half a night to wipe them all out with my cudgel.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're shameless,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;quite shameless. Stop talking so big.
 It would take seven or eight days just to call the roll. How could you
 wipe them all out?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Tell me how you'd do it,&#8221; laughed Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;However you grabbed them, tied them up, or fixed them where they are
 with fixing magic you'd never be able to do it so fast,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;I wouldn't need to grab them or tie them up,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'll
 give my cudgel a tug at both ends, say 'Grow!,' and make it over four
 hundred feet long. Then I'll wave it, say 'Thicken!,' and make it
 eighty feet around. I'll roll it down the Southern slope and that'll
 kill five thousand of them. I'll roll it down the Northern slope and
 kill another five thousand. Then I'll roll it along the ridge from East
 to West, and even if there are forty or fifty thousand of them I'll
 squash them all to a bloody pulp.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;if you kill them that way, like rolling out
 dough for noodles, you could do it in four hours.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Friar Sand with a laugh, &#8220;as my elder brother has such
 divine powers we've got nothing to fear. Please mount up so that we can
 be on our way.&#8221; Having heard them discussing Monkey's powers Sanzang
 could not but mount with an easy heart and be on his way.</P>
<P>As they traveled along the old man disappeared. &#8220;He must have been an
 evil spirit himself,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;deliberately coming to frighten
 us with cunning and intimidation.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Take it easy,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'm going to take a look.&#8221; The splendid
 Great Sage leapt up to a high peak but saw no trace of the old man when
 he looked around. Then he suddenly turned back to see a shimmering
 coloured glow in the sky, shot up on his cloud to look, and saw that it
 was the Great White Planet. Walking over and grabbing hold of him,
 Monkey kept addressing him by his personal name: &#8220;Li Changgeng! Li
 Changgeng! You rascal! If you had something to say you should have said
 it to my face. Why did you pretend to be an old man of the woods and
 make a fool of me?&#8221;</P>
<P>The planet hastened to pay him his respects and said, &#8220;Great Sage, I
 beg you to forgive me for being late in reporting to you. Those demon
 chiefs really have tremendous magical abilities and their powers are
 colossal. With your skill in transformations and your cunning you may
 just be able to get over, but if you slight them it will be very hard.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm very grateful,&#8221; Monkey thanked him, &#8220;very grateful. If I really
 can't get across this ridge I hope that you'll go up to Heaven and put
 in a word with the Jade Emperor so he'll lend me some heavenly soldiers
 to help me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes, yes,&#8221; said the Great White Planet. &#8220;Just give the word and
 you can have a hundred thousand heavenly troops if you want them.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Great Sage then took his leave of the planet and brought his
 cloud down to see Sanzang and say, &#8220;The old man we saw just now was
 actually the Great White Planet come to bring us a message.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang, putting his hands together in front of his
 chest, &#8220;catch up with him quick and ask him where there's another path
 we could make a detour by.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no other way round,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;This mountain is 250
 miles across, and goodness knows how much longer it would be to go all
 the way around it. How ever could we?&#8221; At this Sanzang could not
 restrain himself from weeping.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if it's going to be as hard as this how are we
 going to worship the Buddha?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't cry,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;don't cry. If you cry you're a louse. I'm
 sure he's exaggerating. All we have to do is be careful. As they say,
 forewarned is forearmed. Dismount and sit here for now.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you want to talk about now?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; replied Monkey. &#8220;You stay here and look after the master
 carefully while Friar Sand keeps a close eye on the baggage and the
 horse. I'm going up the ridge to scout around. I'll find out how many
 demons there are in the area, capture one, ask him all the details, and
 get him to write out a list with all of their names. I'll check out
 every single one of them, old or young, and tell them to shut the gates
 of the cave and not block our way. Then I can ask the master to cross
 the mountain peacefully and quietly. That'll show people my powers.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Be careful,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;do be careful!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No need to tell me,&#8221; Brother Monkey replied with a smile. &#8220;On this
 trip I'd force the Eastern Ocean to make way for me, and I'd smash my
 way in even if it were a mountain of silver cased in iron.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage went whistling straight up to the peak by his
 somersault cloud. Holding on to the vines and creepers, he surveyed the
 mountain only to find it silent and deserted. &#8220;I was wrong,&#8221; he said
 involuntarily, &#8220;I was wrong. I shouldn't have let that old Great White
 Planet go. He was just trying to scare me. There aren't any evil
 spirits here. If there were they'd be out leaping around in the wind,
 thrusting with their spears and staves, or practicing their fighting
 skills. Why isn't there a single one?&#8221;</P>
<P>As he was wondering about this there was a ringing of a bell and a
 banging of clappers. He turned round at once to see a little devil boy
 with a banner on which was written BY ORDER over his shoulder, a bell
 at his waist and clappers in his hands that he was sounding. He was
 coming from the North and heading South. A close look revealed that he
 was about twelve feet tall.</P>
<P>&#8220;He must be a runner,&#8221; thought Monkey, grinning to himself,
 &#8220;delivering messages and reports. I'll take a listen to what he's
 talking about.&#8221; The splendid Great Sage made a spell with his hands,
 said the magic words, shook himself and turned into a fly who landed
 lightly on the devil's hat and tilted his head for a good listen.</P>
<P>This is what the little devil was saying to himself as he headed
 along the main road, sounding his clappers and ringing his bell: &#8220;All
 we mountain patrollers must be careful and be on our guard against Sun
 the Novice. He can even turn into a fly!&#8221; Monkey was quietly amazed to
 hear this. &#8220;That so-and-so must have seen me before. How else could he
 know my name and know that I can turn into a fly?&#8221; Now the little devil
 had not in fact seen him before. The demon chief had for some reason
 given him these instructions that he was reciting blindly. Monkey, who
 did not know this, thought that the devil must have seen him and was on
 the point of bringing the cudgel out to hit him with when he stopped.</P>
<P>&#8220;I remember Pig being told,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;when he questioned the
 planet that there were three demon chieftains and 47,000 or 48,000
 junior devils like this one. Even if there were tens of thousands more
 juniors like this it would be no problem. But I wonder how great the
 three leaders' powers are. I'll question him first. There'll be time to
 deal with them later.&#8221;</P>
<P>Splendid Great Sage! Do you know how he questioned the demon? He
 jumped off the devil's hat and landed on a tree top, letting the junior
 devil go several paces ahead. Then Monkey turned round and did a quick
 transformation into another junior devil, sounding clappers, ringing a
 bell and carrying a flag over his shoulder just like the real one. He
 was also dressed identically. The only difference was that he was a few
 inches taller.</P>
<P>He was muttering the same things as the other as he caught him up,
 shouting, &#8220;Hey, you walking ahead, wait for me.&#8221;</P>
<P>Turning round, the junior devil asked, &#8220;Where have you come from?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're a nice bloke,&#8221; Monkey said with a smile, &#8220;not even
 recognizing one of your own people.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're not one of ours,&#8221; said the demon.</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;Take a look and see if you can
 recognize me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've never seen you before,&#8221; the demon said. &#8220;I don't know you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's not surprising you don't know me,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I work in the
 kitchens. We've rarely met.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't,&#8221; said the demon, shaking his head, &#8220;you don't. None of
 the brothers who do the cooking has got a pointy face like yours.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I must have made my face too pointy when I did the transformation,&#8221;
 thought Monkey, so he rubbed it with his hands and said, &#8220;It isn't
 pointy.&#8221; Indeed it was not.</P>
<P>&#8220;But it was pointy just now,&#8221; the little devil said. &#8220;How did you
 stop it being pointy just by rubbing it? You're a very shady character.
 I don't have the faintest idea who you are. You're not one of us. I've
 never met you. Very suspicious. Our kings run the household very
 strictly. The kitchen staff only work in the kitchen and the mountain
 patrols keep to patrolling the mountain. How could you possibly be a
 cook and a patroller?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's something you don't know,&#8221; said Monkey, improvising a clever
 answer. &#8220;I was promoted to patrolling because the kings saw how well
 I'd worked in the kitchens.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well then,&#8221; said the little devil. &#8220;We patrollers are divided
 into ten companies of forty each, which makes four hundred in all.
 We're all known by our ages, appearances, names and descriptions.
 Because Their Majesties want to keep the organization neat and
 roll-calls convenient they've given us all passes. Have you got one?&#8221;
 Monkey, who had seen what the devil looked like and heard what he had
 said, had been able to turn himself into the devil's double. But not
 having seen the devil's pass he was not carrying one himself. Instead
 of saying that he did not have one the splendid Great Sage claimed that
 he had.</P>
<P>&#8220;Of course I've got one,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But it's a new one that's only
 just been issued to me. Show me yours.&#8221;</P>
<P>Not realizing what Monkey was up to, the little devil lifted his
 clothes to reveal a gold-lacquered pass with a silken cord through it
 fastened next to his skin that he lifted out to show Monkey. Monkey saw
 that on the back of it were the words &#8220;Demon-suppresser,&#8221; while on the
 front was handwritten &#8220;Junior Wind-piercer.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Goes without saying,&#8221; Brother Monkey thought, &#8220;all the ones in
 mountain patrols have 'Wind' at the end of their names. Put your
 clothes down now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and come over here while I show you my
 pass.&#8221; With that he turned away, put a hand down to pull a little hair
 from the tip of his tail, rubbed it between his fingers, called
 &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned it into another gold-lacquered pass on a green
 silken cord on which were handwritten the words &#8220;Senior Wind-piercer.&#8221;</P>
<P>With his liking for taking things to extremes and his gift of finding
 the right thing to say, Monkey remarked, &#8220;There's something you don't
 know. When Their Majesties promoted me to patrolling for doing so well
 in the kitchen they gave me a new pass as a Senior Patroller and put me
 in charge of you forty lads in this company.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this the demon at once gave a &#8220;na-a-aw&#8221; of respect and said, &#8220;Sir,
 I didn't recognize you as you've only just been appointed. Please
 forgive me if anything I said offended you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm not angry with you,&#8221; said Monkey, returning his courtesy.
 &#8220;There's just one thing. I want some money from you all to mark our
 first meeting: five ounces of silver each.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please be patient, sir,&#8221; the little devil replied. &#8220;When I get back
 to the Southern end of the ridge to meet the rest of our company we'll
 all give it to your together.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case I'm coming with you,&#8221; said Monkey, and he followed
 behind as the demon led the way.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After a mile or two a writing-brush peak was seen. Why was it called
 a writing-brush peak? Because on the top of the mountain there was a
 pinnacle about forty or fifty feet high that looked just like a writing
 brush standing upright on a brush stand.</P>
<P>Going up to it Monkey lifted his tail, jumped to the top of the
 pinnacle, sat down and called, &#8220;Come here, all of you.&#8221;</P>
<P>The young Wind-piercers all bowed low beneath him and said, &#8220;We're at
 your service, sir.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do you know why Their Majesties appointed me?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; they replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Their Majesties want to eat the Tang Priest,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;but
 they're worried about Sun the Novice's tremendous magic powers. They've
 heard that he can do transformations and are worried that he might turn
 himself into a young Wind-piercer and come along the path here to find
 out what's going on. That's why they're made me Senior Wind-piercer to
 check up on you and find out if there are any impostors among you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We're all genuine, sir,&#8221; the junior Wind-piercers all replied at
 once.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you're all genuine do you know what powers His Senior Majesty
 has?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; one of the young Wind-piercers said.</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;tell me about them at once. If what you
 say matches what I know, you're genuine. If it's at all wrong you're
 impostors, and I'll take you to Their Majesties for punishment.&#8221;</P>
<P>Seeing him sitting up on high, playing wise and cunning as he shouted
 at them, the young devils had nothing for it but to tell him the truth.
 &#8220;His Majesty has vast magical abilities and enormous powers,&#8221; one of
 the young devils replied. &#8220;He once devoured a hundred thousand heavenly
 warriors in a single mouthful.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're an impostor,&#8221; Monkey spat out when he heard this.</P>
<P>&#8220;Sir, Your Honour,&#8221; said the young devil in panic, &#8220;I'm real. How can
 you call me an impostor?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you're genuine why did you talk such nonsense?&#8221; Monkey replied.
 &#8220;No matter how big he is His Majesty couldn't have swallowed a hundred
 thousand heavenly soldiers in a single mouthful.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is something you don't know about, sir,&#8221; the young devil
 replied. &#8220;His Majesty can do transformations. He can make himself tall
 enough to hold up the sky or as small as a cabbage seed. Some years ago
 when the Queen Mother invited all the immortals to a peach banquet she
 didn't send him an invitation, so His Majesty wanted to fight Heaven.
 The Jade Emperor sent a hundred thousand heavenly soldiers to subdue
 His Majesty, gave himself a magical body and opened his mouth that was
 as big as a city gate. He made as if to swallow hard, which frightened
 the heavenly soldiers so much that they dared not give battle, and the
 Southern Gate of Heaven was shut. That's how he could have swallowed a
 hundred thousand heavenly soldiers at a single mouthful.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey grinned to himself and thought, &#8220;Frankly, I've done that too.
 What powers does His Second Majesty have?&#8221; he asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;His Second Majesty is thirty feet tall with brows like sleeping
 silkworms, phoenix eyes, a voice like a beautiful woman, tusks like
 carrying-poles and a nose like a dragon. If he's in a fight he only
 needs to wrinkle his nose for his enemy to be scared witless even if
 he's covered in bronze and iron.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Evil spirits who get people with their noses are easy enough to
 catch,&#8221; said Monkey, who then asked, &#8220;and what powers does His Third
 Majesty have?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He's no monster from the mortal world,&#8221; the young devil replied.
 &#8220;His name is Ten Thousand Miles of Cloud Roc. When he moves he rolls up
 the wind and shifts the waves, shaking the North as he heads for the
 South. He carries a treasure about with him called the Male and Female
 Vital Principles Jar. Anyone who's put in that jar is turned liquid in
 a few moments.&#8221;</P>
<P>That news gave Monkey something to worry about. &#8220;I'm not scared of
 the monsters,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;but I'll have to watch out for his jar.&#8221;
 Then he said aloud, &#8220;Your account of Their Majesties' powers isn't
 bad&#8212;it fits exactly with what I know. But which of them wants to eat
 the Tang Priest?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't you know, sir?&#8221; said the young Wind-piercer.</P>
<P>&#8220;As if I didn't know better than you!&#8221; shouted Monkey. &#8220;I was told to
 come and question you because they're worried that you don't know all
 the details.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Our Senior King and Second King have long lived in Lion Cave on Lion
 Mountain,&#8221; the young devil replied, &#8220;but the Third King doesn't live
 here. He used to live over a hundred miles to the West of here in the
 capital of a country called Leonia. Five hundred years ago he ate the
 king of the country, his civil and military officials, and everybody
 else in the city, young and old, male and female. So he seized their
 country, and now all the people there are evil monsters. I don't know
 which year it was in which he heard that the Tang court has sent a
 priest to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures. They say this
 priest is a good man who has cultivated his conduct for ten
 incarnations, and anyone who eats a piece of his flesh will live for
 ever and never grow old. But the Third King is worried about the
 priest's disciple Sun the Novice who's a real terror, so he's come to
 swear brotherhood with our two kings, all three are now working
 together to catch the Tang Priest.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Damn this thoroughly ill-behaved monster,&#8221; thought Brother Monkey
 with great fury. &#8220;I'm protecting the Tang Priest while he works for the
 true achievement. How dare they plot to eat my man?&#8221; With a snort of
 fury he ground his steel teeth and brandished his iron cudgel as he
 leapt down from the high pinnacle and smashed the poor young devil's
 head into a lump of meat. When he saw what he had done Monkey felt
 sorry.</P>
<P>&#8220;Oh dear,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;he meant well, telling me all about the
 house. Why did I finish him off all of a sudden like that? Oh well! Oh
 well! That's that.&#8221; The splendid Great Sage had been forced to do this
 because his master's way ahead had been blocked. He took the little
 devil's pass off him, tied it round his own waist, put the &#8220;By order&quot;
 flag over his shoulder, hung the bell from his waist and sounded the
 clappers with his hand. Then he made a hand-spell into the wind, said a
 spell, shook himself, turned into the exact likeness of the junior
 Wind-piercer, and went straight back the way he had come, looking for
 the cave to find out about the three demon chieftains. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Handsome Monkey King had a thousand transformations</P>
<P>And the true power of magic to make ten thousand changes.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey was rushing deep into the mountains along the way he had come
 when suddenly he heard shouts and whinnies. As he looked up he saw tens
 of thousands of little devils drawn up outside the entrance to the Lion
 Cave with their spears, sabers, swords, halberds, flags and banners.
 Monkey was delighted.</P>
<P>&#8220;Li Changgeng, the planet, was telling the truth,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;He
 wasn't lying at all.&#8221; The devils were drawn up in a systematic way,
 each 250 forming a company, so that from the forty standards in many
 colours that were dancing in the wind he could tell that there were ten
 thousand infantry and cavalry there.</P>
<P>&#8220;If I go into the cave disguised as a junior Wind-piercer and one of
 the demon chiefs questions me about my mountain patrol,&#8221; Monkey
 thought, &#8220;I'll have to make up answers on the spur of the moment. The
 moment I say anything at all wrong he'll realize who I am and I won't
 be able to get away. That army on the gates would stop me and I'd never
 get out. If I'm going to catch the demon kings I'll have to get rid of
 the devils on the gates first.&#8221;</P>
<P>Do you know how he was going to do that? &#8220;The old demons have never
 seen me,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;they've only heard of my reputation. I'll talk
 big and scare them with my fame and prestige. If it's true that all
 living beings in the middle land are destined to have the scriptures
 brought to them, then all I need do is talk like a hero and scare those
 monsters on the gate away. But if they're not destined to have the
 scriptures brought to them I'll never get rid of the spirits from the
 gates of this cave in the West even if I talk till lotus flowers
 appear.&#8221; Thus he thought about his plans, his mind questioning his
 mouth and his mouth questioning his mind, as he sounded the clappers
 and rang the bell.</P>
<P>Before he could rush in through the entrance to Lion Cave he was
 stopped by the junior devils of the forward camp, who said, &#8220;You're
 back, young Wind-piercer.&#8221; Monkey said nothing but kept going with his
 head down.</P>
<P>When he reached the second encampment more young devils grabbed hold
 of him and said, &#8220;You're back, young Wind-piercer.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;On your patrol this morning did you meet a
 Sun the Novice?&#8221; they asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I did,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;He was polishing his pole.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What's he like?&#8221; the terrified devils asked. &#8220;What sort of pole was
 he polishing?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He was squatting beside a stream,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;He looked like
 one of those gods that clear the way. If he'd stood up I'm sure he'd
 have been hundreds of feet tall, and the iron cudgel he was holding was
 a huge bar as thick as a rice-bowl. He'd put a handful of water on a
 rocky scar and was polishing the cudgel on it muttering, 'Pole, it's
 ages since I got you out to show your magic powers: This time you can
 kill all the demons for me, even if there are a hundred thousand of
 them. Then I'll kill the three demon chiefs as a sacrificial offering
 to you.' He's going to polish it till it shines then start by killing
 the ten thousand of you on the gates.&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing this the little devils were all terror-struck and their
 souls all scattered in panic. &#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; Monkey continued, &#8220;that Tang
 Priest has only got a few pounds of flesh on him. We won't get a share.
 So why should we have to carry the can for them? We'd do much better to
 scatter.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right,&#8221; the demons said. &#8220;Let's all run for our lives.&#8221; If
 they had been civilized soldiers they would have stayed and fought to
 the death, but as they were all really wolves, tigers and leopards,
 running beasts and flying birds, they all disappeared with a great
 whoosh. Indeed, it wasn't as if the Great Sage Sun had merely talked
 big: it was like the time when Xiang Yu's army of eight thousand
 soldiers disappeared, surrounded by foes who were former comrades.</P>
<P>&#8220;Splendid,&#8221; said monkey to himself with self-congratulation, &#8220;the old
 devils are as good as dead now. If this lot run away at the sound of me
 they'll never dare look me in the face. I'll use the same story when I
 go in there. If I said anything different and one or two of the young
 devils had got inside and heard me that would give the game away.&#8221;
 Watch him as he carefully approaches the ancient cave and boldly goes
 deep inside.</P>
<P>If you don't know what of good or ill was to come from the demon
 chieftains listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<P></P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="1_0_76">Chapter 75</A></H3>
</I>
<P>The Mind-Ape Bores a Hole in the Male and Female Jar</P>
<P>The Demon King Returns and the Way Is Preserved</P>
</B>
<P>The story tells how the Great Sage Sun went in through the entrance
 of the cave and looked to either side. This is what he saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Hills of skeletons,</P>
<P>Forests of bones,</P>
<P>Human heads and hair trampled into felt,</P>
<P>Human skin and flesh rotted into mud,</P>
<P>Sinews twisted round trees,</P>
<P>Dried and shining like silver.</P>
<P>Truly there was a mountain of corpses, a sea of blood,</P>
<P>An unbearable stench of corruption.</P>
<P>The little devils to the East</P>
<P>Sliced the living flesh off human victims;</P>
<P>The evil demons to the West</P>
<P>Boiled and fried fresh human meat.</P>
<P>Apart from the heroic Handsome Monkey King</P>
<P>No common mortal would have dared go in.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He was soon inside the second gates, and when he looked around here
 he saw that things were different from outside. Here was purity, quiet
 elegance, beauty and calm. To left and right were rare and wonderful
 plants; all around were tall pines and jade-green bamboo. After another
 two or three miles he reached the third gates, slipped inside for a
 peep, and saw the three old demons sitting on high. They looked
 thoroughly evil. The one in the middle</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Had teeth like chisels and saws,</P>
<P>A round head and a square face.</P>
<P>His voice roared like thunder;</P>
<P>His eyes flashed like lightning.</P>
<P>Upturned nostrils faced the sky;</P>
<P>Red eyebrows blazed with fire.</P>
<P>Wherever he walked</P>
<P>The animals were terrified;</P>
<P>If he sat down</P>
<P>The demons all trembled.</P>
<P>He was the king among the beasts,</P>
<P>The Blue-haired Lion Monster.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The one sitting on his left was like this:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Phoenix eyes with golden pupils,</P>
<P>Yellow tusks and powerful thighs.</P>
<P>Silver hair sprouting from a long nose,</P>
<P>Making his head look like a tail.</P>
<P>His brow was rounded and wrinkled,</P>
<P>His body massively heavy.</P>
<P>His voice as delicate as a beautiful woman's,</P>
<P>But his face was as fiendish as an ox-headed demon's.</P>
<P>He treasured his tusks and cultivated his person for many years,</P>
<P>The Ancient Yellow-tusked Elephant.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The one on the right had</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Golden wings and a leviathan's head,</P>
<P>Leopard eyes with starry pupils.</P>
<P>He shook the North when he headed South,</P>
<P>Fierce, strong and brave.</P>
<P>When he turned to soaring</P>
<P>Quails laughed but dragons were terrified.</P>
<P>When he beat his phoenix wings the birds all hid their heads,</P>
<P>And the beasts all lost their nerve when he spread his talons.</P>
<P>He could fly thirty thousand miles through the clouds,</P>
<P>The Mighty Roc.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Beneath these two were ranged a hundred and ten commanders high and
 low, all in full armor and looking most imposing and murderous. The
 sight delighted Brother Monkey, who strode inside, quite unafraid, put
 down his clappers and bell, and called, &#8220;Your Majesties.&#8221;</P>
<P>The three old demons chuckled and replied, &#8220;So you're back, young
 Wind-piercer.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;When you were patrolling what did you find
 out about where Sun the Novice is?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesties,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;I don't dare tell you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; the senior demon chief asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I was walking along sounding my clappers and ringing my bell
 following Your Majesties' orders,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;when all of a sudden I
 looked up and saw someone squatting and polishing a pole there. He
 looked like one of the gods that clear the way. If he'd stood up he'd
 have been well over a hundred feet tall. He'd scooped up some water in
 his hand and was polishing his iron bar on the rocky scar. He was
 saying to himself that his cudgel still hadn't the chance to show its
 magical powers here and that when he'd shined it up he was coming to
 attack Your Majesties. That's how I realized he was Sun the Novice and
 came here to report.&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing this the senior demon chief broke into a sweat all over
 and shivered so that his teeth chattered as he said, &#8220;Brothers, I don't
 think we should start any trouble with the Tang Priest. His disciple
 has tremendous magical powers and he's polishing his cudgel to attack
 us. Whatever are we to do?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Little ones,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;call everybody, high and low, who's
 outside the cave to come inside and shut the gates. Let them pass.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; said one of the subordinate officers who knew what
 had happened, &#8220;the little devils outside have all scattered.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why?&#8221; the senior demon asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;They must have heard about his terrible reputation. Shut the gates
 at once! At once!&#8221; The hosts of demons noisily bolted all the front and
 back gates firmly.</P>
<P>&#8220;Now they've shut the gates they might ask me all sorts of questions
 about things in here,&#8221; Monkey thought with alarm &#8220;If I don't know the
 right answers I'll give the game away and they'll catch me. I'd better
 give them another scare and get them to open the gates to let me out.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; he said, stepping forward, &#8220;there were some other
 wicked things he said.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What else?&#8221; the senior demon chief asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;He said he was going to skin Your Senior Majesty,&#8221; replied Brother
 Monkey, &#8220;slice up the bones of His Second Majesty, and rip out His
 Third Majesty's sinews. If you shut the gates and refuse to go out he
 can do transformations. He might turn himself into a fly, get in
 through a crack between the gates and catch us all. Then we'll be done
 for.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Be very careful, brothers,&#8221; said the senior demon. &#8220;We haven't had a
 fly here for years, so any fly that gets in will be Sun the Novice.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So I'll change into a fly and frighten them into opening the gates,&#8221;
 thought Monkey, smiling to himself. The splendid Great Sage then
 slipped aside, reached up to pull a hair from the back of his head,
 blew on it with a magic breath, called &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned it into a
 golden fly that flew straight into the old demon's face.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brothers,&#8221; said the old demon in a panic, &#8220;this is terrible! He's
 inside!&#8221; All the demons great and small were so alarmed that they
 rushed forward to swat the fly with their rakes and brooms.</P>
<P>The Great Sage could not help giggling aloud, which was just what he
 should not have done as it revealed his true face. The third demon
 chief leapt forward, grabbed him and said, &#8220;Brothers, he almost had us
 fooled.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Who had who fooled?&#8221; the senior demon asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The young devil who reported just now was no junior Wind-piercer,&#8221;
 the third chief replied, &#8220;but Sun the Novice himself. He must have run
 into a junior Wind-piercer and somehow or other murdered him and done
 this transformation to trick us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He's rumbled me,&#8221; thought Monkey with alarm, rubbing his face.</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean, I'm Sun the Novice?&#8221; Monkey said to the senior
 demon chief. &#8220;I'm a junior Wind-piercer. His Majesty's mistaken.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said the senior demon, &#8220;he really is a junior
 Wind-piercer. He's in the roll-call out front three times a day. I know
 him. Do you have a pass?&#8221; he went on to ask Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Monkey replied, pulling his clothes apart to produce it.
 Seeing that it looked genuine the senior demon said, &#8220;Brother, don't
 mistreat him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Elder brother,&#8221; the third demon chief replied, &#8220;didn't you see him
 slip aside just now and giggle? I saw him show his face: it's like a
 thunder god's. When I grabbed hold of him he turned back into what he
 looks like now. Little ones,&#8221; he called, &#8220;fetch ropes!&#8221; The officers
 then fetched ropes.</P>
<P>The third demon chief knocked Monkey over and tied his hands and feet
 together. When his clothes were stripped off he was most evidently the
 Protector of the Horses. Now of the seventy-two transformations that
 Monkey could perform, when he turned himself into a bird, a beast, a
 plant, a tree, a vessel or an insect he changed his whole body. When he
 turned into another person, however, he could only change his head and
 face but not his body, and indeed he was still covered with brown hair
 and had red thighs and a tail.</P>
<P>&#8220;That's Sun the Novice's body,&#8221; the senior demon chief said when he
 saw this, &#8220;and a junior Wind-piercer's face. It's him! Little ones,&#8221; he
 ordered, &#8220;bring wine and give His Third Majesty a cup of it to
 congratulate him. Now that we've captured Sun the Novice the Tang
 Priest is as good as a meal in our mouths.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We mustn't drink now,&#8221; said the third demon chief. &#8220;Sun the Novice
 is a slippery customer and is good at escaping by magic. I'm worried he
 might get away. Tell the juniors to bring the jar out and put him
 inside. Then we can drink.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said the senior demon chief with a smile, who then chose
 thirty-six little demons to go inside, open the storerooms, and carry
 the jar out. Do you know how big the jar was? It was only two feet four
 inches high. So why were thirty-six people needed to carry it? It was
 because the jar was a treasure of the two vital forces, male and
 female, and contained the seven precious things, the eight trigrams and
 the twenty-four periods of the year that thirty-six carriers were
 required to match the number of the stars of the Dipper. Before long
 the precious jar had been carried out, set down outside the third pair
 of gates, cleaned up and opened. Monkey was untied, stripped bare and
 sucked inside the jar with a hiss by magical vapor that came out of it.</P>
<P>The lid was then put back on and sealed on with a label, after which
 the demons went off to drink, saying, &#8220;Now that he's in our jar that
 monkey can forget all about his journey West. The only way he'll be
 able to pay his respects to the Buddha and fetch the scriptures now
 will be by pushing the wheel of destiny backwards and being reborn.&#8221;
 Watch how all the demons great and small go laughing off to celebrate.
 But of that no more.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Once inside the jar the Great Sage, who was very cramped, decided to
 transform himself and squat down in the middle, where he found it very
 cool. &#8220;Those evil spirits don't live up to their reputation,&#8221; he said
 to himself, laughing aloud. &#8220;Why ever do they tell people that anyone
 put in this jar will be turned to pus and blood in a few moments. It's
 so cool that spending seven or eight years here would be no problem.&#8221;</P>
<P>Alas! The Great Sage did not know about this treasure. Anyone put
 inside it who said nothing for a year would stay cool for a year; but
 the moment a voice was heard fires began to turn. Before Monkey had
 finished speaking the whole jar was full of flame. Luckily he could use
 the knack of making fire-averting magic with his hands as he sat in the
 middle of the jar completely unafraid. When he had endured the flames
 for an hour forty snakes emerged from all around to bite him. Swinging
 his arms about him Monkey grabbed hold of all of them, twisted with all
 his strength, and broke them into eighty pieces. A little later three
 fire dragons appeared to circle above and below Monkey, which was
 really unbearable.</P>
<P>It drove Monkey into a helpless desperation of which he was only too
 conscious, &#8220;The other things were no trouble,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but these
 three fire dragons are a real problem. If I don't get out soon the fire
 will attack my heart, and what then? I'll make myself grow,&#8221; he went on
 to think, &#8220;and push my way out.&#8221; The splendid Great Sage made a spell
 with his hands, said the words of a spell and called out, &#8220;Grow!&#8221; He
 made himself over a dozen feet tall, but as he grew the jar grew with
 him, enclosing him tightly. When he made himself smaller, the jar
 shrank too.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is terrible,&#8221; Brother Monkey thought with alarm, &#8220;terrible. It
 grows when I grow and shrinks when I get smaller. Why? What am I to
 do?&#8221; Before he had finished speaking his ankle began to hurt. Putting
 his hand down at once to feel it he found that it had been burnt so
 badly it had gone soft. &#8220;I don't know what to do,&#8221; he said with
 anxiety, &#8220;My ankle's been cooked tender. I'm a cripple now.&#8221; He could
 not stop the tears from flowing. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When suffering at the demons' hands he thought of his master;</P>
<P>In facing deadly peril he worried about the Tang Priest.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;since I was converted by the Bodhisattva
 Guanyin and delivered from my heavenly punishment you and I have toiled
 over many a mountain. I've beaten and wiped out a lot of monsters,
 subdued Pig and Friar Sand, and gone through no end of suffering. All
 this was done in the hope of reaching the West and completing the true
 achievement together. Never did I expect to meet these vicious demons
 today. Now I've been stupid enough to get myself killed in here I've
 left you stuck in the middle of the mountains. What a mess to be in for
 someone who used to be as famous as I was!&#8221;</P>
<P>Just when he was feeling thoroughly miserable he suddenly remembered,
 &#8220;Years ago the Bodhisattva gave me three life-saving hairs on the
 Coiled Snake Mountain. I wonder if I've still got them. I'd better look
 for them.&#8221; He felt all over his body and found three very rigid hairs
 on the back of his head.</P>
<P>&#8220;All the other hair on my body is soft except for these three that
 are as hard as spears,&#8221; he said with delight. &#8220;They must be my
 lifesavers.&#8221; Gritting his teeth against the pain, he pulled the three
 hairs out, blew on them with magic breath and called, &#8220;Change!&#8221; One of
 them turned into a steel drill, one into a strip of bamboo, and one
 into a silken cord. He made the bamboo strip into a bow to which he
 fixed the drill. After a noisy spell of drilling at the bottom of the
 jar he made a hole through which the light came in. &#8220;I'm in luck,&#8221; he
 said with glee, &#8220;I'm in luck. Now I can get out.&#8221; No sooner had he
 transformed himself ready to escape than the jar became cool again. Why
 was that? It cooled because the hole he had bored in it let the male
 and female vital forces escape.</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage put his hairs back, made himself small by
 turning into the tiniest of insects, a very delicate creature as thin
 as a whisker and as long as an eyebrow hair, and slipped out through
 the hole. Instead of making his escape Monkey flew straight to the
 senior demon chief's head and landed on it. The senior demon, who was
 drinking, slammed his goblet down and asked, &#8220;Third brother, has Sun
 the Novice been liquefied yet?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Is the time up?&#8221; the third demon chief asked. The senior demon told
 his messengers to carry the jar in. When the thirty-six young devils
 picked the jar up they found that it was far lighter.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; they reported with alarm, &#8220;the jar's lighter.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; the senior demon shouted. &#8220;It has the full powers of the
 male and female vital forces. It couldn't possibly get lighter.&#8221;</P>
<P>One of the junior demons who liked showing off picked the jar up and
 said, &#8220;Look. It is lighter, isn't it?&#8221; When the senior demon took the
 lid off to look in he saw that it was bright inside.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's empty,&#8221; he could not help shouting aloud, &#8220;it's leaked.&#8221; And
 Monkey, sitting on his head, could not help shouting, &#8220;Search, my lads!
 He's escaped.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He's escaped,&#8221; all the monsters shouted, &#8220;he's escaped!&#8221; The order
 was then given to shut the gates.</P>
<P>With that Monkey shook himself, took back the clothes that had been
 taken off him, turned back into himself and leapt out of the cave.
 &#8220;Behave yourselves, evil spirits,&#8221; he flung back insultingly. &#8220;I've
 bored through the jar and you can't keep anyone in it any more. You'll
 have to take it outside and shit in it.&#8221;</P>
<P>Shouting and yelling with glee he went straight back on his cloud to
 where the Tang Priest was. Here he found the venerable gentleman making
 symbolic incense with a pinch of earth and praying to the sky. Monkey
 stopped his cloud to listen to what he was saying. Sanzang had his
 hands together in front of his chest and was saying to Heaven,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;All you immortals up there in the clouds,</P>
<P>The Dings and the Jias and each god and goddess,</P>
<P>Protect my disciple, whose powers are enormous,</P>
<P>And magic is boundless, the good Sun the Novice.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the Great Sage heard this he decided to redouble his efforts.
 Putting his cloud away he went up to Sanzang and called, &#8220;Master, I'm
 back.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang held him as he said, &#8220;Wukong, you have been to great trouble.
 I was very concerned because you had gone so far into these high
 mountains and not come back for so long a time. How dangerous is the
 mountain in fact?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; Monkey replied with a smile, &#8220;that trip just now depended
 in the first place on the good destiny of all the living beings in the
 East, secondly on your boundless achievement and great virtue, and
 thirdly on your disciple's magical powers.&#8221; Then he told the whole
 story of how he had pretended to be a Wind-piercer, been drawn into the
 jar and escaped.</P>
<P>&#8220;Now I've seen your face again, Master, It's like having a second
 life.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang expressed endless thanks then asked, &#8220;Did you not fight the
 evil spirits this time?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No, I didn't,&#8221; replied Brother Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Then you won't be able to escort me safely across this mountain,&#8221;
 Sanzang said, at which Monkey, who hated to admit he was beaten,
 shouted, &#8220;What do you mean, I won't be able to escort you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you and they have not yet had it out and you can only give me
 evasive answers I will never dare press ahead,&#8221; the venerable elder
 replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; laughed the Great Sage, &#8220;you really don't understand. As
 the saying goes, you can't spin a thread from a single strand of silk,
 and you can't clap one-handed. There are three demon chiefs and
 thousands of the little devils. How could I fight them all
 single-handed?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you are that outnumbered you would indeed find it hard by
 yourself,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;Pig and Friar Sand also have their
 talents. I shall tell them to go with you to help you clean up the path
 across the mountain and escort me over it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What you say is completely right, Master,&#8221; replied Monkey with a
 smile. &#8220;Tell Friar Sand to protect you while Pig comes with me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig in alarm, &#8220;you're a poor judge. I'm rough and I
 can't do anything much. I'd just get in the way as I walked along. What
 use would I be to you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You may not be up to much, brother,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;but you're
 someone. As the saying goes, even a fart can swell the wind. You'd make
 me feel a bit braver.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;All right,&#8221; Pig said, &#8220;all right. You can take me with you. But
 don't play any of your tricks on me when the going gets tough.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't forget that Friar Sand and I will be waiting here,&#8221; said
 Sanzang.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The idiot braced himself and set off a gale with Monkey that carried
 them by cloud up to the top of the mountain where the entrance to the
 cave was. They saw at once that the gates were shut tight. There was
 nobody in sight anywhere around. Monkey went forward, his iron cudgel
 in his hands, to shout at the top of his voice, &#8220;Open up, evil
 monsters! Come out right now and fight Monkey!&#8221; When the young devils
 in the cave went inside to report the senior demon shook with terror as
 he commented,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've heard tell for years of that monkey's ferocity;</P>
<P>Now I can vouch for the story's veracity.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean, elder brother?&#8221; the second demon chief asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;When that Sun the Novice first turned himself into a fly to sneak in
 here none of us realized who he was except our Third Brother, who put
 him in the jar. He used his skills to drill a hole in the jar, pick up
 his clothes and get out. Now he's outside challenging us to battle.
 Who's brave enough to be the first to take him on?&#8221; Nobody replied. The
 senior demon asked again; again there was no response. Everyone was
 pretending to be deaf and dumb.</P>
<P>&#8220;We've got ourselves a lousy reputation in the West already,&#8221; the
 senior demon chief said in fury. &#8220;Now that Sun the Novice has treated
 us with such contempt today our reputation will stand even lower if we
 don't fight him. I'm going out there to chance my old life on three
 rounds with him. If I can hold out for those three rounds the Tang
 Priest will still be a meal in our mouths. If I can't then shut the
 gates and let them pass.&#8221; He then kitted himself out in his armor, had
 the gates opened and went out. As Monkey and Pig watched from beside
 the gates they saw that he was a fine monster:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On iron brow and brazen head a precious helmet</P>
<P>With tassels dancing brightly in the wind.</P>
<P>His eyes both flashed as if with lightning,</P>
<P>And ruddy glowed the hair at his temples.</P>
<P>Pointed and sharp were his silvery claws,</P>
<P>And his saw-like teeth were set close and neat.</P>
<P>His armor was golden, without any seam,</P>
<P>Bound with a dragon sash that could foresee the future.</P>
<P>In his hand flashed a cutlass of steel.</P>
<P>Such martial might is rare in the world.</P>
<P>With a voice that roared like thunder he asked,</P>
<P>&#8220;Who is that knocking at my gates?&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your grandfather, Lord Sun, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven,&#8221; said
 Monkey, turning to face the gate.</P>
<P>&#8220;Are you Sun the Novice?&#8221; asked the demon with a laugh. &#8220;You've got a
 cheek, ape. I never gave you any trouble, so why are you here
 challenging me to battle?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;'No waves come without a wind; without the tide the waters are
 still,'&#8220; Monkey replied. &#8220;Would I have come looking for you if you
 hadn't given me trouble? The reason why I'm here to fight is because
 your gang of foxes and dogs is plotting to eat my master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;From the way you're acting so fierce and shouting at our gates you
 must want a fight,&#8221; the old demon replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;Stop all that ranting and raving then,&#8221; said the
 demon. &#8220;It would be most unfair if I brought out my devil soldiers and
 drew them up in battle order with flags flying and drums beating to
 fight you as I'm on my own territory. I'll fight you single-handed with
 no helpers for either side.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he shouted, &#8220;Keep out of the way, Pig, and
 let's see how he copes with me.&#8221; The idiot did indeed get out of the
 way.</P>
<P>&#8220;Come over here,&#8221; the senior demon shouted, &#8220;and be a chopping block
 for me. Let me hack you three times as hard as I can with sword on your
 bare head. After that I'll let your Tang Priest pass. If you can't take
 it then hand your Tang Priest over at once. He'll be a tasty morsel to
 help our rice down.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Bring out a brush and some paper if you have them in your cave and
 I'll give you a bond. You can hack at me from today till next year, but
 it'll be nothing to me.&#8221;</P>
<P>The old demon then summoned up all his might, took up a stance with
 his feet apart, lifted his sword with both hands and hacked at the top
 of the Great Sage's head. The Great Sage raised his head, and though
 there was a mighty crash his scalp did not even go red.</P>
<P>&#8220;That monkey really does have a hard head,&#8221; exclaimed the old demon
 with shock.</P>
<P>&#8220;You wouldn't know about it,&#8221; said Monkey with a laugh. &#8220;I was</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Born with a skull of bronze and iron,</P>
<P>Like nobody else's in all the world.</P>
<P>Hammer and axe will never smash me;</P>
<P>I went in Lord Lao Zi's furnace when I was a boy.</P>
<P>The Star Lords of the Four Dippers helped mould me,</P>
<P>The twenty-eight constellations all used their skill.</P>
<P>I've often been soaked in water but never come to harm,</P>
<P>And all over my body the sinews are knotty.</P>
<P>The Tang Priest, fearing I would not stand firm,</P>
<P>Placed a golden band around my head.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Cut out that insolence, ape,&#8221; the senior demon said, &#8220;and take these
 two blows from my sword. I'm most certainly not going to spare your
 life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's nothing,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Have another cut like that if you
 like.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You monkey,&#8221; the old demon said, &#8220;you don't know about this sword,&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Created in furnaces of metal and fire,</P>
<P>A hundred times tempered by divine craftsmanship.</P>
<P>Its sharp blade follows the Three Strategies,</P>
<P>And it is as strong as described in the Six Plans.</P>
<P>The point is as fine as a housefly's tail,</P>
<P>And supple as the body of a white dragon.</P>
<P>When it goes to the mountains dense clouds arise;</P>
<P>If it plunges into the sea the great waves roll.</P>
<P>It has been burnished times beyond number,</P>
<P>Heated and tempered many hundred times over.</P>
<P>Deep in the mountains it is kept in the caves;</P>
<P>Great is the glory it has won when in battle.</P>
<P>If I use it to strike at your monkish pate</P>
<P>I'll cut it into a pair of gourd ladles.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're blind, evil spirit,&#8221; laughed the Great Sage, &#8220;if you think my
 head is just gourd ladles. I'll let you hack at me if you're silly
 enough to want to. Have another go and see what happens.&#8221;</P>
<P>The senior demon raised his sword for another hack, which the Great
 Sage moved his head forward to meet. With a loud band his head was
 split into two, whereupon the Great Sage rolled on the ground and gave
 himself a second body. The sight so alarmed the demon that he lowered
 his sword.</P>
<P>Watching all this from a distance Pig said with a laugh, &#8220;Give him a
 couple more hacks, old devil, then there'll be four of him.&#8221;</P>
<P>Pointing at Brother Monkey the senior demon said, &#8220;I'd heard that you
 can use self-dividing magic. Why are you showing it off to me now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What self-dividing magic?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why was it that the first time I hacked you it made no impact, but
 this time I cut you in two?&#8221; the senior demon asked. &#8220;Don't worry, evil
 spirit,&#8221; said the Great Sage with a smile. &#8220;If you cut me ten thousand
 times there'll be twenty thousand of me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You ape,&#8221; the demon said, &#8220;you may be able to divide yourself but
 you can't put yourself together again. If you can, hit me with your
 cudgel.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't talk nonsense,&#8221; said the Great Sage. &#8220;You asked to take three
 cuts at me but only took two. Now you've invited me to hit you once.
 I'm not Monkey if I hit you one and a half times.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the senior demon.</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage hugged his two bodies together, rolled,
 became one body again and struck with his cudgel at the demon's head.
 The old demon raised his sword to parry the blow. &#8220;Damned ape,&#8221; he
 said, &#8220;you've got a cheek! How dare you come here attacking me with a
 mourner's staff like that?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you ask about this cudgel of mine,&#8221; shouted the Great Sage,
 &#8220;everybody in heaven and earth has heard of it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What's it famous for?&#8221; the senior demon asked. To this Monkey
 replied:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;The cudgel is made of nine-cycled wrought iron</P>
<P>Tempered by Lord Lao Zi himself in his furnace.</P>
<P>King Yu called it a divine treasure when he obtained it</P>
<P>To hold the eight rivers and four oceans in place.</P>
<P>In its middle the constellations are secretly set out,</P>
<P>And each end is banded with yellow gold.</P>
<P>Ghosts and gods are amazed at its intricate decorations,</P>
<P>Dragon patterns and phoenix signs.</P>
<P>Known as the Divine Male Cudgel,</P>
<P>It was inaccessibly deep in the bed of the sea.</P>
<P>Its shape can change and it knows how to fly,</P>
<P>Sending clouds of many colours drifting through the air.</P>
<P>Once it was mine I took it back to my mountain,</P>
<P>Where I discovered how its infinite changes.</P>
<P>When I want size it's as thick as a vat,</P>
<P>Or it can be as thin as an iron wire,</P>
<P>Huge as a mountain or small as a needle,</P>
<P>Adapting its length to the wishes of my heart.</P>
<P>Lightly I lift it and coloured clouds spring up,</P>
<P>Or it flies through the sky and flashes like lightning.</P>
<P>The cold air it gives off chills all who feel it,</P>
<P>And ominous mists appear in the sky.</P>
<P>I have carried it with me to beat dragons and tigers,</P>
<P>Travelling to all of the ends of the earth.</P>
<P>Once with this cudgel I made havoc in heaven,</P>
<P>And used its great might to wreck the peach banquet.</P>
<P>The heavenly kings were unable to beat me,</P>
<P>And Nezha was hard pressed to match me in combat.</P>
<P>With this cudgel against them the gods had no safe refuge;</P>
<P>A hundred thousand heavenly troops all scattered and fled.</P>
<P>The gods of thunder guarded the Hall of Miraculous Mist</P>
<P>When the cudgel attacked the Palace of Universal Brightness</P>
<P>All of the angels at court were flustered</P>
<P>And the Jade Emperor's ministers were thrown into panic.</P>
<P>I raised my cudgel to overturn the Palace of the Dipper,</P>
<P>Then turned back to shake up the South Pole Compound.</P>
<P>Seeing my dread cudgel at his golden gates</P>
<P>The Jade Emperor invited the Buddha to see me.</P>
<P>The soldier takes defeat and victory in his stride;</P>
<P>There is nothing to choose between suffering and disaster.</P>
<P>I stuck it out for full five hundred years</P>
<P>Until I was converted by the Bodhisattva Guanyin.</P>
<P>Then a holy monk appeared in Tang</P>
<P>Who swore a mighty oath to heaven,</P>
<P>To save the souls in the City of the Unjustly Slain</P>
<P>And fetch the sutras at an assembly on Vulture Mountain.</P>
<P>On the journey to the West are many evil monsters</P>
<P>Whose actions would be a great obstacle to him.</P>
<P>So, knowing that my cudgel is matchless in the world,</P>
<P>He begged me to be his companion on the journey.</P>
<P>When it struck down evil spirits they were sent to the Underworld,</P>
<P>Their flesh turned to red dust and their bones all to powder.</P>
<P>Evil spirits everywhere were killed by the cudgel,</P>
<P>In thousands upon thousands too numerous to count.</P>
<P>Up above it wrecked the Dipper and Bull Palace,</P>
<P>And below it ruined the Senluo Court in Hell.</P>
<P>Of the heavenly generals it routed the Nine Bright Shiners,</P>
<P>And it wounded all of the Underworld's judges.</P>
<P>Dropped from mid-air it shakes mountains and rivers;</P>
<P>It is stronger than the sword of an evil star.</P>
<P>With this cudgel alone I protect the Tang Priest</P>
<P>And kill all the evil monsters in the world.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the monster heard this he trembled, lifted his sword and struck
 with all his strength. Chuckling, Monkey blocked the blow with his iron
 cudgel. At first the two of them struggled in front of the cave, but
 then they both sprang up and fought in mid-air. It was a splendid
 battle.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The divine rod had once secured the bed of Heaven's River:</P>
<P>The As-You-Will cudgel is the finest in the world,</P>
<P>Praise of its powers enraged the demon chief,</P>
<P>Whose mighty cutlass was full of great magic.</P>
<P>When they fought outside the gates they were still open to reason,</P>
<P>But no mercy was shown in their battle in the sky.</P>
<P>One could change his appearance at will;</P>
<P>The other could make himself grow on the spot.</P>
<P>The fight was so intense that the sky filled with clouds,</P>
<P>And all of the plains were enveloped in mist.</P>
<P>One had often determined to devour the monk Sanzang;</P>
<P>The other used his magic to protect the Tang Priest.</P>
<P>All because the Lord Buddha transmitted the scriptures</P>
<P>Evil and good were opposed in harsh conflict.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The senior demon and the Great Sage fought over twenty rounds without
 either emerging the victor while Pig admired their magnificent battle
 from down below until, unable to restrain himself, he grabbed his rake
 and leapt up into the air, riding on the wind to strike at the evil
 monster's face. The demon panicked, not realizing that Pig had no
 staying power, but could only rush recklessly in and give people a
 fright. All the demon could see was that Pig had a long snout, big ears
 and a vicious way with his rake, so he abandoned the struggle, threw
 his sword away, turned and fled.</P>
<P>&#8220;After him,&#8221; the Great Sage shouted, &#8220;after him!&#8221; The idiot raised
 his rake and went down in all his ferocious might straight after the
 monster. Seeing how close Pig was to him the old demon stood still in
 front of the mountainside, faced the wind, shook himself, resumed his
 real appearance and opened his mouth to devour Pig. This so terrified
 Pig that he fled as fast as he could into the undergrowth, not caring
 that brambles and thorns were tearing his head. He sat there trembling
 and listening out for the sound of the cudgel. When Monkey caught up
 with him the monster opened his jaws to eat Monkey up too. This was
 just what Monkey intended. Putting his cudgel away he went straight
 towards the demon, who swallowed him in a single gulp.</P>
<P>This gave the idiot such a fright as he was hiding in the undergrowth
 that he grumbled to himself, &#8220;You've got no common sense, Protector of
 the Horses. Why did you go towards the monster when he wanted to eat
 you up instead of running away? Now he's swallowed you. Today you're
 still a monk, but tomorrow you'll be a turd.&#8221; Only when the monster had
 departed in triumph did Pig emerge from the undergrowth and slip back
 by the way he had come.</P>
<P>Sanzang and Friar Sand were still waiting for Pig at the foot of the
 mountain when they saw him come running breathless towards them. &#8220;Pig,&#8221;
 said Sanzang with horror, &#8220;why are you in this terrible state? Why is
 Wukong not here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My brother was swallowed up by the evil spirit in a single gulp,&#8221;
 Pig replied amid sobs, at which Sanzang collapsed in terror. A little
 later he stamped and beat his chest, saying, &#8220;Disciple, I thought you
 were good at subduing demons and were going to take me to see the
 Buddha in the Western Heaven. Who would have thought that you would die
 at this demon's hand today? Alas! Alas! All the efforts of my disciples
 have now turned to dust.&#8221; The master was thoroughly miserable.</P>
<P>Just look at the idiot. Instead of coming over to comfort his master
 he calls, &#8220;Friar Sand, fetch the luggage. Let's split it between us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why, brother?&#8221; Friar Sand asked. &#8220;Divide it up,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;and
 all of us can go our separate ways. You can go back to the River of
 Flowing Sand and carry on eating people. I'll go back to Gao Village
 and see my wife. We can sell the white horse to buy the master a coffin
 to be buried in.&#8221; The master was so upset when he heard this that he
 wept aloud to Heaven.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We shall leave them and return to the senior demon chief.</P>
<P>When he had swallowed Monkey he thought he had won, so he went
 straight back to his cave, where all the other demons came out to ask
 him how the fight had gone.</P>
<P>&#8220;I've got one of them,&#8221; the senior demon said.</P>
<P>&#8220;Which one is that?&#8221; asked the second demon with delight.</P>
<P>&#8220;Sun the Novice,&#8221; the senior demon replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where have you got him?&#8221; the second demon chief said.</P>
<P>&#8220;In my stomach,&#8221; said the senior demon, &#8220;I swallowed him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Elder brother,&#8221; said the third demon chief with horror, &#8220;I forgot to
 tell you that Sun the Novice wasn't worth eating.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm delicious,&#8221; said the Great Sage from inside the demon's stomach,
 &#8220;and I'll stop you from ever feeling hungry again.&#8221;</P>
<P>This caused the junior devils such a shock that they reported, &#8220;This
 is terrible, Your Senior Majesty. Sun the Novice is talking inside your
 stomach.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That doesn't frighten me,&#8221; said the senior demon. &#8220;If I'm clever
 enough to catch him do you think I'm not clever enough to deal with
 him? Make me some hot salty water at once. I'll pour it into my
 stomach, vomit him out, and have him fried at my leisure to eat as a
 snack with some drinks.&#8221;</P>
<P>The junior devils soon had ready half a bowl of hot salty water that
 the old demon drained in one, filling his mouth. He then really did
 vomit, but the Great Sage, who had taken root in his stomach, did not
 even move. The monster then pressed his throat and vomited again till
 his head was spinning, his eyes in a daze and his gallbladder split,
 but still Monkey would not be shifted. By now the senior demon was
 gasping for breath.</P>
<P>&#8220;Sun the Novice,&#8221; he called, &#8220;won't you come out?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;I don't want to come out now.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; the old demon asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;You really don't understand, evil spirit,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Ever since
 I've been a monk I've had scant food and clothing. Although it's autumn
 now and getting cool I'm still only wearing a thin tunic. But it's warm
 in your stomach and there are no drafts down here. I think I'll spend
 the winter here before coming out.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the evil spirits heard this they all said, &#8220;Your Majesty, Sun
 the Novice wants to spend the winter in your stomach.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If he wants to spend the winter there I'll take to meditation and
 use magic to shift him,&#8221; the senior demon said. &#8220;I won't eat anything
 all winter. The Protector of the Horses will starve to death.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You just don't understand, my boy,&#8221; the Great Sage said. &#8220;I came via
 Guangzhou when I started escorting the Tang Priest and I've got a
 folding cooking pan with me that I brought in here to cook myself a
 mixed grill. I'll take my time enjoying your liver, bowels, stomach and
 lungs. They'll be enough to keep me going till spring.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said the second demon chief with shock, &#8220;that ape would do
 it too.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said the third demon, &#8220;perhaps he can eat up some bits and
 pieces, but I don't know where is he going to set up his pan.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The collar bone is an ideal stand,&#8221; replied Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is terrible,&#8221; said the third demon. &#8220;If he sets up his pan and
 lights a fire won't the smoke get into your nose and make you sneeze?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That'll be no problem,&#8221; said Monkey with a laugh. &#8220;I'll use my
 gold-banded cudgel to push a hole through his skull. That'll be a
 skylight for me and serve as a chimney too.&#8221;</P>
<P>The old demon heard this and was most alarmed despite saying that he
 was not afraid. All he could do was to summon up his courage and call,
 &#8220;Don't be scared, brothers. Bring me some of that drugged wine. When I
 down a few goblets of that the drugs will kill the monkey.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this Monkey smiled to himself and thought, &#8220;When I made havoc in
 Heaven five hundred years ago I drank the Jade Emperor's wine and ate
 Lord Lao Zi's elixir, the Queen Mother's peaches, the marrow of phoenix
 bones and dragon livers. I've eaten everything. What kind of drugged
 wine could do me any harm?&#8221;</P>
<P>By then the junior devils had strained two jugfuls of drugged wine, a
 goblet of which they handed to the senior demon chief, who took it in
 his hands.</P>
<P>Monkey, who could smell it from inside the demon's belly, called out,
 &#8220;Don't give it to him!&#8221; The splendid Great Sage then tipped his head
 back and turned it into the bell of a trumpet that he placed wide open
 below the demon's throat. The demon gulped the wine down noisily and
 Monkey noisily received it. The demon swallowed the second cupful and
 Monkey noisily drank that too. This went on till Monkey had drunk all
 of the seven or eight cupfuls that the demon downed.</P>
<P>&#8220;That's enough,&#8221; the demon said, putting the goblet down. &#8220;Normally
 my stomach feels as if it's on fire after a couple of cups of this
 wine,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but this time my face hasn't even gone red after seven
 or eight.&#8221;</P>
<P>Now the Great Sage was not a heavy drinker, so after taking these
 seven or eight cupfuls he started to act drunk in the demon's stomach,
 propping himself up, falling flat on his face, kicking about him,
 swinging on the demon's liver, doing headstands and somersaults, and
 dancing wildly. This caused the monster such unbearable pain that he
 collapsed.</P>
<P>If you don't know whether he lived or died listen to the explanation

<P>When the Heart Spirit Stays in the Home the Demons Submit</P>
<P>The Mother of Wood Helps Bring Monsters to the Truth</P>
</B>
<P>The story tells how after the Great Sage had struggled in his stomach
 for a while the senior demon collapsed in the dust. He made no sound
 and was not breathing either. As he said nothing Monkey thought the
 demon was dead, so he stopped hitting him. When the demon chief
 recovered his breath he called out, &#8220;Most merciful and most
 compassionate Bodhisattva, Great Sage Equaling Heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My boy,&#8221; said Monkey when he heard this, &#8220;don't waste your effort.
 You could save yourself a few words by simply calling me Grandpa Sun.&#8221;</P>
<P>Desperate to save his skin, the evil monster really did call out,
 &#8220;Grandpa! Grandpa! I was wrong. I shouldn't have eaten you, and now
 you're destroying me. I beg you, Great Sage, in your mercy and
 compassion take pity on my antlike greed for life and spare me. If you
 do I'll escort your master across the mountain.&#8221;</P>
<P>Although the Great Sage was a tough hero he was most eager to help
 the Tang Priest in his journey, so on hearing the evil monster's
 pathetic pleas and flattery he decided once more to be kind.</P>
<P>&#8220;Evil monster,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;I'll spare your life. How are you going
 to escort my master?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We don't have any gold, silver, pearls, jade, agate, coral, crystal,
 amber, tortoiseshell or other such treasures here to give him, but my
 two brothers and I will carry him in a rattan chair across the
 mountain.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you could carry him in a chair that would be better than
 treasure,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile. &#8220;Open your mouth: I'm coming out.&#8221;</P>
<P>The demon then opened his mouth, whereupon the third chief went over
 to him and whispered in his ear, &#8220;Bite him as he comes out, brother.
 Chew the monkey to bits and swallow him. Then he won't be able to hurt
 you.&#8221;</P>
<P>Now Monkey could hear all this from inside, so instead of coming
 straight out he thrust his gold-banded cudgel out first as a test. The
 demon did indeed take a bite at it, noisily smashing one of his front
 teeth in the process.</P>
<P>&#8220;You're a nice monster, aren't you!&#8221; exclaimed Monkey, pulling his
 cudgel back. &#8220;I spare your life and agree to come out, but you try to
 murder me by biting me. I'm not coming out now. I'm going to kill you.
 I won't come out! I won't!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; the senior demon chief complained to the third one, &#8220;what
 you've done is destroy one of your own kind. I'd persuaded him to come
 out but you would have to tell me to bite him. Now I'm in agony from my
 broken tooth. What are we to do?&#8221;</P>
<P>In the face of the senior demon chief's complaints the third demon
 chief tried the method of making the enemy lose his temper.</P>
<P>&#8220;Sun the Novice,&#8221; he yelled at the top of his voice, &#8220;you have a
 thundering reputation. They tell of how mighty you were outside the
 Southern Gate of Heaven and at the Hall of Miraculous Mist. I'd heard
 that you've been capturing demons along your way to the Western Heaven.
 But now I see that you're only a very small-time ape.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What makes me small-time?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;A hero who only roams three hundred miles around will go three
 thousand miles to make his fame resound,&#8221; the third chief replied.
 &#8220;Come out and fight me if you're a real tough guy. What do you mean by
 messing about in someone else's stomach? If you're not small-time what
 are you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes, yes,&#8221; thought Monkey when he heard this. &#8220;It wouldn't be
 at all difficult for me to tear this demon's bowels to bits, rip up his
 liver, and kill him,&#8221; the Great Sage shouted. &#8220;But I'd destroy my own
 reputation in the process. I'll have to forget about it. Open your
 mouth and I'll come out and fight you. The only problem is that this
 cave of yours is much too cramped for me to use my weapons. We'll have
 to go somewhere where there's more room.&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing this the third demon chief mustered all the demons young
 and old from all around. There were over thirty thousand of them armed
 with the finest and sharpest weapons who came out of the cave to form a
 line of battle symbolizing heaven, earth and mankind. They were all
 waiting for Monkey to come out of the senior demon's mouth before
 rushing him. The second demon chief then helped the senior demon out
 through the entrance of the cave, where he shouted, &#8220;Sun the Novice! If
 you're such a tough guy, come out. There's good battlefield here for us
 to fight on.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Great Sage could tell that this was an open area from the calls
 of crows, magpies and cranes that he could hear in the monster's belly.
 &#8220;If I don't come out I'll be breaking faith with them,&#8221; he thought.
 &#8220;But if I do these demons are beasts at heart behind their human faces.
 They tried to lure me out and bite me when they promised to carry the
 master across the ridge. Now they've got their army here. Oh well! I'll
 let them have it both ways. I'll go out but I'll leave a root in his
 stomach too.&#8221;</P>
<P>With that he put his hand behind him to pluck a tiny hair from his
 tail, blew on it with magic breath, called &#8220;Change!&#8221; and made it into a
 string as fine as a hair but some four hundred feet long. As the string
 came outside it grew thicker in the wind. One end Monkey fastened round
 the evil monster's heart in a slip-knot that he did not tighten&#8212;if he
 had it would have caused great pain. The other end he held in his hand
 as he said to himself, &#8220;If they agree to escort my master across the
 ridge when I come out this time I'll leave it at that. But if they
 refuse and go for me with their weapons so hard that I can't cope with
 them I'll just need to pull this rope. I'll get the same results as if
 I were still inside.&#8221;</P>
<P>He then made himself tiny and crawled up as far as the throat, from
 where he could see that the evil spirit had opened his mouth wide. Rows
 of steel teeth were set above and below like sharp knives. &#8220;This is no
 good,&#8221; he thought at once, &#8220;no good at all. If I take this rope out
 through his mouth and he can't stand the pain he'll be able to cut
 through it with a single bite. I'll have to go out where there aren't
 any teeth.&#8221; The splendid Great Sage paid out the string as he crawled
 up the demon's upper palate and into his nostril, which made his nose
 itch. The demon sneezed with a loud &#8220;atchoo,&#8221; blowing Monkey out.</P>
<P>As he felt the wind blowing him Monkey bowed and grew over thirty
 feet long, keeping the string in one hand and holding the iron cudgel
 in the other. The wicked monster raised his steel sword as soon as he
 saw Monkey appear and hacked at his face. The Great Sage met the blow
 one-handed with his cudgel. Then the second demon chief with his spear
 and the third chief with his halberd went for him furiously. The Great
 Sage relaxed his pull on the rope, put his iron cudgel away and made
 off at speed by cloud, afraid that he would be unable to fight properly
 when surrounded by so many young devils. Once he had leapt out of the
 demons' camp he brought his cloud down on a spacious and empty mountain
 top and pulled with both hands on the rope as hard as he could. This
 gave the senior demon a pain in the heart. The demon struggled upwards
 in agony, whereupon the Great Sage pulled him down again.</P>
<P>As they all watched from afar the junior demons all shouted: &#8220;Don't
 provoke him, Your Majesty! Let him go. That ape has no sense of when
 things ought to be done. He's flying a kite before the beginning of
 April.&#8221; When the Great Sage heard this he gave a mighty stamp, at which
 the senior demon came whistling down out of the sky like a
 spinning-wheel to crash into the dust, making a crater some two feet
 deep in the hard earth at the foot of the mountain.</P>
<P>This gave the second and third demon chiefs such a fright that they
 landed their clouds together and rushed forward to grab hold of the
 rope and kneel at the foot of the mountain. &#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; they pleaded,
 &#8220;we thought you were an immortal of vast and boundless generosity. We'd
 never dreamed that you would be as small-minded as a rat or a snail.
 It's true that we lured you out to give battle, but we never expected
 that you would tie a rope round our eldest brother's heart&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're a thorough disgrace, you damned gang of demons,&#8221; said Monkey
 with a laugh. &#8220;Last time you tried to trick me into coming out so you
 could bite me and this time you've lured me out to face an army ready
 for battle. It's obvious that you've got tens of thousands of soldiers
 here to tackle me when I'm alone. Most unreasonable. I'll pull him
 away. I'm going to drag him off to see my master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If in your mercy and compassion you spare our lives, Great Sage,&#8221;
 the demons said, all kowtowing together, &#8220;we vow to escort your master
 across this mountain.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you want to live all you have to do is cut the rope with your
 sword,&#8221; said Monkey with a laugh.</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; the senior monster said, &#8220;I can cut the rope outside, but
 it's no good having the length inside that's tied round my heart. It
 sticks in my throat so uncomfortably that it makes me feel sick.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;open your mouth and I'll go back inside
 to undo the rope.&#8221; This alarmed the senior demon, who said, &#8220;If you
 don't come out when you go in this time I'll be in a mess, a real
 mess.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I know how to undo the end of the rope that's in you from the
 outside,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;But when I've undone it will you really
 escort my master across?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We will as soon as you've undone it,&#8221; the senior demon chief
 replied. &#8220;I wouldn't dare lie about this.&#8221; Now that he had satisfied
 himself the demon was telling the truth Monkey shook himself and put
 the hair back on his body, whereupon the monster's heart pains stopped.
 It was the Great Sage Sun's transforming magic that had tied the hair
 round his heart in the first place, which was why the pain ended as
 soon as the hair was put back on Monkey.</P>
<P>The three demon chiefs then rose up into the air to thank him with
 the words, &#8220;Please go back now, Great Sage, and pack your luggage. We
 will carry a chair down to fetch him.&#8221; The demon horde then all put
 their weapons down and went back into the cave.</P>
<P>Having put his rope away the Great Sage went straight back to the
 Eastern side of the ridge, and when he was still a long way away he saw
 the Tang Priest lying on the ground, rolling around and howling. Pig
 and Friar Sand had opened the bundles of luggage and were dividing it
 up.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't tell me,&#8221; thought Monkey with a quiet sigh. &#8220;No doubt Pig has
 told the master that I've been eaten up by evil spirits. The master's
 sobbing his heart out because he can't bear to be without me and the
 idiot's dividing the things ready for us all to split up. Oh dear! I
 can't be sure, so I'd better go down and give the master a shout.&#8221;</P>
<P>Bringing his cloud down, Monkey shouted, &#8220;Master!&#8221; As soon as Friar
 Sand heard this he started complaining to Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;All you want is to see people dead, just like a coffin stand,&#8221; he
 said. &#8220;Our elder brother wasn't killed but you said he was and started
 this business here. Of course he's bound to kick up a row.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But I saw him with my own eyes being eaten up by the evil spirit in
 one mouthful,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;I'm sure we're just seeing that ape's
 spirit because it's an unlucky day.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey then went up to Pig and hit him in the face with a slap that
 sent him staggering. &#8220;Cretin!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Is this my spirit you can
 see?&#8221;</P>
<P>Rubbing his face, the idiot replied, &#8220;But the monster really did eat
 you up, brother. How can you&#8212;how can you have come back to life?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Useless gumboil!&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;After he ate me I grabbed his
 bowels, twisted his lungs, tied a rope round his heart and tore at him
 till he was in horrible agony. Then they all kowtowed and pleaded with
 me, so I spared his life. Now they're bringing a carrying-chair here to
 take the master over the mountain.&#8221;</P>
<P>As soon as Sanzang heard this he scrambled to his feet, bowed to
 Monkey and said, &#8220;Disciple, I've put you to enormous trouble. If I had
 believed what Wuneng said we would have been finished.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Chaff-guzzling idiot,&#8221; Monkey said abusively, taking a swing at Pig
 with his fist, &#8220;you're thoroughly lazy and barely human. But don't get
 upset, Master. The monsters are coming to take you across the
 mountain.&#8221; Friar Sand too felt deeply ashamed, and quickly trying to
 cover it up he packed up the luggage and loaded the horse to wait on
 the road.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story returns to the three demon chiefs, who led their devilish
 hosts back into the cave. &#8220;Elder brother,&#8221; said the second demon, &#8220;I'd
 imagined that Sun the Novice had nine heads and eight tails, but he
 turns out to be nothing but that pipsqueak of a monkey. You shouldn't
 have swallowed him. You should have fought him. He'd have been no match
 for us. With our tens of thousands of goblins we could have drowned him
 in our spit. But by swallowing him you let him use his magic and cause
 you agony, so that you didn't dare have it out with him. When I said
 we'd take the Tang Priest across the mountains just now I didn't mean
 it. It was only a way of luring him out because your life was in
 danger. I most certainly won't escort the Tang Priest.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why not, good brother?&#8221; the senior demon chief asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you and I draw up three thousand junior devils ready for battle I
 can capture that ape,&#8221; the second demon replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Never mind about three thousand,&#8221; the senior demon chief said. &#8220;You
 can have our whole force. If we capture him it'll be a credit to us
 all.&#8221;</P>
<P>The second demon chief then mustered three thousand junior demons
 whom he led to a place beside the main road, where they were put into
 battle formation. He sent a herald with a blue flag to carry a message.</P>
<P>&#8220;Sun the Novice,&#8221; the herald said, &#8220;come out at once and fight His
 Second Majesty.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Pig heard this he said with a laugh, &#8220;As the saying goes,
 brother, liars don't fool the people at home. You lied to us when you
 came back, you trickster. You said you'd beaten the evil spirits and
 that they'd be bringing a carrying-chair to take the master across. But
 here they are challenging you to battle. Why?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The senior demon did surrender to me,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and he
 wouldn't dare show his face. The sound of my name alone is enough to
 give him a headache. The second demon chief must be challenging me to
 battle because he can't bring himself to escort us across. I tell you,
 brother, those three evil spirits are brothers and they have a sense of
 honour. We're three brothers but we don't. I've beaten the senior
 demon, so the second demon's come out. There's no reason why you
 shouldn't fight him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm not scared of him,&#8221; Pig said. &#8220;I'll go and give him a fight.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you want to, go ahead,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig with a laugh, &#8220;I'll go, but lend me that rope.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you want it for?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;You don't know how to get
 into his belly or tie it to his heart, so what use would it be to you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I want it tied round my waist as a lifeline,&#8221; replied Pig. &#8220;You and
 Friar Sand are to hold on to it and let it out for me to fight him. If
 you think I'm beating him pay more rope out and I'll capture him, but
 if he's beating me, pull me back. Don't let him drag me off.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this Monkey smiled to himself and thought, &#8220;Another chance to make
 a fool of the idiot.&#8221; Monkey then tied the rope round Pig's waist and
 sent him off into battle.</P>
<P>The idiot lifted his rake and rushed up the steep slope shouting.
 &#8220;Come out, evil spirit! Come and fight your ancestor Pig!&#8221; The herald
 with the blue flag rushed back to report, &#8220;Your Majesty, there's a monk
 with a long snout and big ears here.&#8221; The second demon chief came out
 of the encampment, saw Pig, and without a word thrust his spear
 straight at Pig's face. The idiot raised his rake and went forward to
 parry the blow. The two of them joined battle in front of the
 mountainside, and before they had fought seven or eight rounds the
 idiot began to weaken. He was no longer able to hold the evil spirit
 off.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; he shouted, turning back in a hurry, &#8220;pull in the
 lifeline, pull in the lifeline!&#8221; When the Great Sage heard this from
 where he stood he loosened his hold on the rope and dropped it. The
 idiot started to run back now that he was defeated. At first he had not
 noticed the rope trailing behind him, but after he turned back,
 relaxing the tension on it, it started to get tangled round his legs.
 He tripped himself over, climbed to his feet and tripped over again. At
 first he only staggered, but then he fell facedown into the dust. The
 evil spirit caught up with him, unwound his trunk that was like a
 python, wrapped it round Pig and carried him back in triumph to the
 cave. The devilish host chorused a paean of victory as they swarmed
 back.</P>
<P>When Sanzang saw all this from the foot of the slope he became angry
 with Monkey. &#8220;Wukong,&#8221; he said, &#8220;no wonder Wuneng wishes you were dead.
 You brother-disciples don't love each other at all. All you feel is
 jealousy. He told you to pull in his lifeline, so why didn't you? Why
 did you drop the rope instead? What are we to do now you have got him
 killed?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're covering up for him again, Master,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;and showing
 favoritism too. I'm fed up. When I was captured it didn't bother you at
 all. I was dispensable. But when that idiot gets himself caught you
 blame me for it. Let him suffer. It'll teach him how hard it is to
 fetch the scriptures.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;was I not worried when you went? I
 remembered that you could change into other things, so I was sure you
 would come to no harm. But the idiot was born clumsy and can't
 transform himself, which makes this a very dangerous business. You must
 go and rescue him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop complaining, Master,&#8221; said Brother Monkey. &#8220;I'll go and save
 him.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey rushed up the mountain thinking resentfully, &#8220;I'm not going to
 make life easy for that idiot if he wishes me dead. I'll go and see
 what the evil spirits are doing with him. Before I rescue him I'll let
 him suffer a bit.&#8221; He then made magic with his hands, said the words of
 a spell, shook himself, turned into the tiniest of insects and flew
 into the cave, where he landed at the bottom of one of Pig's ears to be
 taken inside with the evil spirit. The second demon chief had led his
 three thousand junior devils trumpeting and drumming loudly to the
 cave, where they stopped.</P>
<P>He now took Pig inside and said, &#8220;I've got one, elder brother.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Show me,&#8221; the senior demon replied.</P>
<P>Unwinding his trunk the second demon chief flung Pig to the ground
 and said, &#8220;There he is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That one's useless,&#8221; said the senior demon.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; put in Pig when he heard this, &#8220;if I'm no use let me
 go and find a more useful one to capture.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He may not be any use,&#8221; said the third demon chief, &#8220;but he is the
 Tang Priest's disciple Zhu Bajie. Tie him up and put him to soak in the
 pool at the back. When his bristles have been soaked off we can open
 his belly up, salt him and dry him in the sun. He'll go down well with
 some wine on a rainy day.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's that then,&#8221; exclaimed Pig in horror. &#8220;I've fallen into the
 clutches of a demon who's a salt-pork peddler.&#8221; The demon hordes fell
 on him, tied his hands and feet together, carried him to the pool at
 the back, pushed him in and went back.</P>
<P>When the Great Sage flew there to have a look he saw the idiot with
 his four limbs pointing upwards and his snout downwards as he half
 floated and was half sinking, grunting through his snout. He really was
 a ridiculous sight, like a big blackened frost-bitten lotus pod that
 has shed its seeds in September or October. Seeing his face the Great
 Sage felt both loathing and pity for him.</P>
<P>&#8220;What shall I do?&#8221; he wondered. &#8220;After all, he is another member of
 the Dragon Flower Assembly. I just wish he wouldn't keep trying to
 divide up the luggage, split our band, and incite the master to say the
 Band-tightening Spell. The other day I heard Friar Sand say that he'd
 stashed some money away for himself. I wonder if it's true. I'll give
 him a scare and find out.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage flew down to his ear and called in a
 disguised voice, &#8220;Zhu Wuneng, Zhu Wuneng.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is terrible,&#8221; thought Pig in alarm, &#8220;Wuneng is the name the
 Bodhisattva Guanyin gave me. I've been called Zhu Bajie all the time
 I've been with the Tang Priest. How can there be anyone here who knows
 my name is Wuneng?&#8221; So he could not restrain himself from asking,
 &#8220;Who's that calling my Buddhist name?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Me,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; the idiot asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm a catcher,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where from, sir?&#8221; asked Pig in terror.</P>
<P>&#8220;From the Fifth King of the Underworld, and he's sent me to fetch
 you,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Then please go back and ask the Fifth King as he's such a good
 friend of my senior fellow-disciple Sun Wukong to give me a day's
 grace. You can come for me tomorrow.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're talking nonsense,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;If King Yama of Hell
 decides you're to die in the third watch nobody will keep you till the
 fourth. Come with me at once if you don't want me to put a rope round
 your neck and drag you off.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do me a favour,&#8221; said the idiot. &#8220;Even with a face like mine still
 want to go on living. I'll certainly die if I have to, but give me a
 day till these evil spirits have captured my master and the rest of us,
 so I can see them again before we're all done for.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well then,&#8221; said Monkey, grinning to himself. &#8220;I've got about
 thirty people to capture around here in this batch. When I've caught
 them I'll come back for you. That'll give you a day's grace. Give me
 some money. I'm sure you've got some.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Oh dear,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;we monks don't have money.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you haven't then I'm dragging you off,&#8221; said Brother Monkey.
 &#8220;Come with me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be so impatient, sir,&#8221; said the idiot, panicking. &#8220;I know that
 rope of yours is what they call the life-taking rope. Once It's round
 you you're dead. Yes, I have got some money. I've got a bit, but not
 much.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where is it?&#8221; Monkey demanded. &#8220;Give it me at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Oh dear, what a pity!&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;From when I became a monk right up
 till now the kind people who feed monks have given me a bit more alms
 than the others because my belly's so big. I saved all the little bits
 of silver till I had about half an ounce. They were awkward to keep, so
 when we were in a city some time ago I asked a silversmith to melt them
 all together. The wicked man stole a few grains of it, so the ingot he
 made only weighed forty-six hundredths of an ounce. Take it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The idiot hasn't even got his trousers on,&#8221; grinned Monkey to
 himself, &#8220;so where can he have hidden it? Hey, where's your silver?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's stuffed inside my left ear,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;I can't get it
 myself because I'm tied up, so take it out yourself.&#8221; When Monkey heard
 this he put his hand out and took the silver from inside Pig's ear. It
 was indeed an ingot shaped like a saddle that weighed only forty-five
 or forty-six hundredths of an ounce. As he held it in his hands Monkey
 could not help roaring with laughter.</P>
<P>Recognizing Monkey's voice the idiot started cursing him wildly from
 the water: &#8220;Damn and blast you, Protector of the Horses, for coming to
 extort money from me when I'm in such misery.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've got you now, you dreg-guzzler!&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Goodness only
 knows what I've had to suffer for the sake of protecting the master,
 while you've been making your fortune.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; Pig retorted. &#8220;Call this a fortune? It's just what I've
 scraped off my teeth. I resisted spending it on my stomach, so I saved
 it to buy myself some cloth to get a tunic made. You've got it out of
 me by intimidation. You ought to share it with me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You won't get a cent of it,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;I've paid you to spare my life,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;so now you damn well
 ought to rescue me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be so impatient,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'll rescue you all in good
 time.&#8221; Putting the silver away he turned back into himself and used his
 cudgel to bring Pig close enough to grab him by his feet, drag him
 ashore and untie him. Pig then sprang up, took off his clothes, wrung
 them out, shook them, and draped them still dripping wet over his
 shoulders.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; he said, &#8220;open the back gates. Let's go.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no glory in sneaking out the back way,&#8221; replied Monkey.
 &#8220;We'll leave by the front gates.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My feet are still numb after being tied up,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;I can't
 run.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Buck up and come with me,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage charged out, clearing his way by swinging his
 cudgel. The idiot had no choice but to endure the pain and keep close
 to him. When he saw the rake propped up by the second pair of gates he
 went over to it, pushed the junior devils aside, retrieved it and
 rushed forward, lashing out wildly. He and Brother Monkey charged
 through three or four pairs of gates, and goodness only knows how many
 junior devils they killed.</P>
<P>When the senior demon chief heard all this he said to the second
 chief, &#8220;You captured a fine one! A fine one indeed! Look! Sun the
 Novice has rescued Pig and they've wounded or killed the juniors on the
 gates.&#8221; The second demon at once sprang to his feet and rushed out
 through the gates brandishing his spear.</P>
<P>&#8220;Damned macaque,&#8221; he shouted at the top of his voice. &#8220;What a nerve!
 How dare you treat us with such contempt!&#8221; As soon as the Great Sage
 heard this he stopped still. The monster thrust his spear straight at
 him without allowing any argument. With the unhurried skill of the
 expert Monkey raised his iron cudgel to hit back at the demon's face.
 The two of them fought a splendid battle outside the entrance to the
 cave:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The yellow-tusked elephant in human form</P>
<P>Had sworn brotherhood with the Lion King.</P>
<P>Persuaded by the senior monster</P>
<P>They plotted together to eat the Tang Priest.</P>
<P>Huge were the powers of the Great Sage, Heaven's equal,</P>
<P>Who helped the good against the bad and killed off demons,</P>
<P>The incompetent Pig had met with disaster,</P>
<P>So Monkey saved him and led him outside.</P>
<P>When the demon king pursued them with great ferocity</P>
<P>The spear and the cudgel each showed off its powers.</P>
<P>The spear moved like a snake in the woods;</P>
<P>The cudgel arose like a dragon from the sea.</P>
<P>Where the dragon emerged the clouds were thick;</P>
<P>Dense hung the mist where the snake went through the woods.</P>
<P>It was all for the sake of the Tang Priest</P>
<P>That they fought each other with ferocity and hatred.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When he saw the Great Sage start fighting the evil spirit, Pig stood
 on the spur, his rake upright. Instead of joining in to help, he
 watched with stupefied amazement. Monkey's cudgel was so powerful and
 his martial skills so faultless the evil spirit used his spear to parry
 Monkey's blows while unrolling his trunk to wrap round him. As Monkey
 knew about this trick he held his gold-banded cudgel out horizontally
 in both hands and raised them. The evil spirit's trunk caught Monkey
 round the waist but missed his hands. Just watch how Monkey belabors
 the evil spirit's trunk with his cudgel.</P>
<P>When Pig saw this he beat his chest and said, &#8220;Oh dear! That
 monster's got lousy luck. When he caught me he got my arms too because
 I'm so clumsy, but he didn't when he caught that slippery character.
 He's got his cudgel in both hands, and all he needs to do is shove it
 up the monster's trunk to give him such a pain in the nostrils that
 it'll make the snot run. The monster'll never be able to hold him.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey had not thought of this before Pig gave him the idea, but now
 he waved his cudgel to make it as thick as a hen's egg and over ten
 feet long and actually did shove it hard up the monster's trunk. This
 gave the evil spirit such a shock that he unraveled his trunk with a
 swishing noise. Monkey brought his hand round to grab the trunk and
 drag it forcefully towards him. To spare himself any more agony the
 monster stepped out and moved with Monkey's hand. Only then did Pig
 dare approach, raising his rake to hit wildly at the monster's flanks.</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Brother Monkey, &#8220;that's no good. The prongs of your rake
 are so sharp they might break his skin. If he starts bleeding heavily
 and the master sees it he'll say we've been killing again. You'd better
 turn it round and hit him with the handle.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot then raised the handle of his rake and struck the monster
 at every step while Monkey dragged him by the trunk. They looked like a
 pair of elephant boys as they led him down to the foot of the mountain,
 where Sanzang could be seen gazing with concentration at the two of
 them coming noisily towards him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wujing,&#8221; he said to Friar Sand, &#8220;what is it Wukong is leading?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; replied Friar Sand when he saw them, &#8220;big brother is
 dragging an evil spirit here by the nose. He really enjoys slaughter.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Splendid, splendid,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;What a big evil spirit, and what
 a long nose! Go and ask him if he's happy and willing to escort us over
 the-mountain. If he is he must be spared and not be killed.&#8221;</P>
<P>Friar Sand at once rushed straight towards them shouting, &#8220;The master
 says you mustn't kill the monster if he's really willing to escort him
 across the mountain.&#8221; As soon as he heard this the demon fell to his
 knees and promised to do so in a very nasal voice. His voice was like
 this because Monkey was pinching his nostrils shut, making it sound as
 though he had a heavy cold.</P>
<P>&#8220;Lord Tang,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I'll carry you across by chair if you spare my
 life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My master and we disciples are good people.&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;As
 you've said this we'll spare your life. Fetch the chair at once. If you
 break your word again we most certainly won't spare your life when we
 catch you next time.&#8221; The freed monster kowtowed and left. Monkey and
 Pig went to report to the Tang Priest on everything that had happened
 to them. Pig was overcome with shame as he spread his clothes out to
 dry in the sun while they waited.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The second demon chief returned trembling and shaking to the cave.
 Even before his return some junior devils had reported to the senior
 and the third demon chiefs that Monkey had dragged him off by the
 trunk. In his anxiety the senior demon had led his hosts out with the
 third demon when they saw the second chief coming back alone. As they
 brought him inside and asked him why he had been released the second
 chief told them all about Sanzang's words of mercy and goodness. They
 looked at each other, at a loss for words.</P>
<P>&#8220;Elder brother,&#8221; said the second demon chief, &#8220;shall we take Sanzang
 across?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a thing to say, brother,&#8221; replied the senior chief. &#8220;Sun the
 Novice is a monkey who shows the greatest benevolence and sense of
 justice. If he had wanted to kill me when he was in my stomach he could
 most certainly have done so. He only grabbed your trunk. He might have
 dragged you off and not let you go. All he did was to pinch your trunk
 and break its skin, and that's given you a scare. Get ready at once to
 take them across.&#8221;</P>
<P>The third demon chief smiled and said, &#8220;Yes, yes, yes!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;From the way you're talking, my good brother,&#8221; said the senior
 demon, &#8220;it sounds as though you're reluctant to let the Tang Priest go.
 If you don't, we'll take him across.&#8221;</P>
<P>The third demon chief smiled again and said, &#8220;Elder brothers, it
 would have been luckier for those monks if they hadn't asked us to
 escort them but had slipped quietly across instead. By asking us to
 escort them they've fallen in with our plan to lure the tiger down from
 the mountain.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean by 'luring the tiger from the mountain?'&#8220; the
 senior demon asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Summon all the demons in our cave,&#8221; the third demon chief continued.
 &#8220;Choose one thousand from the ten thousand of them, then a hundred from
 the thousand, then sixteen and thirty from the hundred.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why do you want sixteen and thirty?&#8221; the senior demon asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The thirty must be good cooks,&#8221; the third demon chief replied. &#8220;Give
 them the best rice and flour, bamboo shoots, tea, gill fungus, button
 mushrooms, beancurd and wheat gluten. Send them to put up a shelter
 seven to ten miles along the way and lay on a meal for the Tang
 Priest.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;And what do you want the sixteen for?&#8221; the senior demon asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Eight to carry the chair and eight to shout and clear the way,&#8221; the
 third demon replied. &#8220;We brothers will accompany them for a stage of
 their journey. About 150 miles West of here is my city, and I've plenty
 of troops there to greet them. When they get to the city we'll do such
 and such and so on... The Tang Priest and his disciples won't be able
 to see what's happening to them. Whether we catch the Tang Priest or
 not depends completely on those sixteen demons.&#8221;</P>
<P>The senior demon was beside himself with delight on hearing this. It
 was as if he had recovered from a drunken stupor or woken up from a
 dream. &#8220;Excellent, excellent,&#8221; he said, whereupon he mustered the
 demons, chose thirty to whom he gave the food and another sixteen to
 carry a rattan chair. As they set out the senior demon gave the
 following instructions to the rest of the demons: &#8220;None of you are to
 go out on the mountain. Sun the Novice is a very cautious ape, and if
 he sees any of you around he'll be suspicious and see through our
 plan.&#8221;</P>
<P>The senior demon then led his underlings to a place beside the main
 road, where he called aloud, &#8220;Lord Tang, today's not an unlucky one, so
 please come across the mountain straight away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Who is that calling me, Wukong?&#8221; Sanzang asked when he heard this.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's the demons I beat,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;They're bringing a chair
 to carry you.&#8221;</P>
<P>Putting his hands together in front of his chest Sanzang looked up to
 the sky and said, &#8220;Splendid, splendid! But for my worthy disciple's
 great abilities I could not proceed on my journey.&#8221; He then walked
 forward to greet the demons with the words, &#8220;I am most grateful for the
 consideration you gentlemen are showing. When my disciples and I return
 to Chang'an we will praise your admirable achievements.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please get into the carrying-chair, my lord,&#8221; the demons said,
 kowtowing. Having mortal eyes and body Sanzang did not realize that
 this was a trick. The Great Sage Sun, a golden immortal of the Supreme
 Monad with a loyal nature, thought that because he had captured and
 released the demons they were now won over. He never imagined that they
 had other plots in mind, so he did not investigate closely but went
 along with his master's ideas. He told Pig to tie the luggage on the
 horse and keep close to the master with Friar Sand while he cleared the
 way with his iron cudgel, watching out to see if all was well. While
 eight devils carried the chair and eight shouted in turn to clear the
 way the three demon chiefs steadied the poles of the chair. The master
 was delighted to sit upright in it and go up the high mountain by the
 main track, little realizing that</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Great grief would return in the midst of rejoicing;</P>
<P>&#8220;Extremes,&#8221; says the classic, &#8220;create their negation.&#8221;</P>
<P>Fated they were to meet with disaster,</P>
<P>A star of ill-omen to mark desolation.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The band of demons worked with one mind to escort them and serve them
 diligently at all times. After ten miles there was a vegetarian meal
 and after fifteen more miles another one. They were invited to rest
 before it grew late, and everything along their way was neat and tidy.
 Each day they had three most satisfactory and delightful meals and
 spent a comfortable night where they were able to sleep well.</P>
<P>When they had traveled about 150 miles West they found themselves
 near a walled city. Raising his iron cudgel the Great Sage, who was
 only a third of a mile ahead of the carrying-chair, was so alarmed by
 the sight of the city that he fell over and was unable to rise to his
 feet. Do you know why someone of his great courage was so frightened by
 what he saw? It was because he saw a very evil atmosphere hanging over
 the town.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Crowds of evil demons and monsters,</P>
<P>Wolf spirits at all four gates.</P>
<P>Striped tigers are the commanders;</P>
<P>White-faced tiger-cats are senior officers.</P>
<P>Antlered stags carry documents around;</P>
<P>Cunning foxes walk along the streets.</P>
<P>Thousand-foot pythons slither round the walls;</P>
<P>Twenty-mile serpents occupy the roads.</P>
<P>At the base of high towers gray wolves shout commands;</P>
<P>Leopards speak in human voices by pavilions.</P>
<P>Standard-bearers and drummers&#8212;all are monsters;</P>
<P>Mountain spirits patrol and stand sentry;</P>
<P>Crafty hares open shops to trade;</P>
<P>Wild boars carry their loads to do business.</P>
<P>What used to be the capital of a heavenly dynasty</P>
<P>Has now become a city of wolves and tigers.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Just as he was being overcome by terror the Great Sage heard a wind
 from behind him and turned quickly to see the third demon chief raising
 a heaven-square halberd with a patterned handle to strike at his head.
 Springing to his feet, the Great Sage struck back at the monster's face
 with his gold-banded cudgel. Both of them were snorting with rage and
 fury as they ground their teeth and fought a wordless struggle. Monkey
 then saw the senior demon chief giving out orders as he lifted his
 steel saber to hack at Pig. Pig was in such a rush that he had to let
 the horse go as he swung his rake around to hit wildly back. Meanwhile
 the second demon chief was thrusting with his spear at Friar Sand, who
 parried with his demon-quelling staff.</P>
<P>The three demon chiefs and the three monks were now all fighting in
 single combat, ready to throw away their lives. The sixteen junior
 devils obeyed their orders, each giving play to his talents as they
 grabbed hold of the white horse and the luggage and crowded round
 Sanzang, lifting up his chair and carrying him straight to the city.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Senior Majesty, please decide what to do now we've captured the
 Tang Priest,&#8221; they shouted. All the demons of every rank on the city
 walls came rushing down to throw the city gates wide open. Every
 battalion was ordered to furl its flag, silence its drums, and on no
 account shout war-cries or strike gongs.</P>
<P>&#8220;His Senior Majesty has given orders that the Tang Priest is not to
 be frightened. He can't endure being scared. If he is, his flesh will
 turn sour and be inedible.&#8221; The demons were all delighted to welcome
 Sanzang, bowing and carrying him into the throne hall of the palace,
 where he was invited to sit in the place of honour. They offered him
 tea and food as they bustled around him in attendance. The venerable
 elder felt dizzy and confused as he looked about and saw no familiar
 faces.</P>
<P>If you don't know whether he was to escape with his life listen to
 the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<P>The Demon Host Mistreats the Fundamental Nature</P>
<P>The One Body Pays His Respects to the Buddha</P>
</B>
<P>We will tell now not of the sufferings of the venerable Tang Elder
 but of the three demon chiefs in strenuous combat with the Great Sage
 and his two brother disciples in the low hills to the East outside the
 city. It was indeed a good hard battle, like an iron brush against a
 copper pan:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Six types of body, six types of weapon,</P>
<P>Six physical forms, six feelings.</P>
<P>The six evils arise from the six sense organs and the six desires;</P>
<P>The six gates to nirvana and the six ways of rebirth are struggling
 for victory.</P>
<P>In the thirty-six divine palaces spring comes of itself;</P>
<P>The six times six forms do not want to be named.</P>
<P>This one holding a gold-banded cudgel</P>
<P>Performs a thousand movements;</P>
<P>That one wielding a heaven-square halberd</P>
<P>Is exceptional in every way.</P>
<P>Pig is even more ferocious with his rake;</P>
<P>The second demon's spear-play is superb and effective.</P>
<P>There is nothing commonplace about young Friar Sand's staff</P>
<P>As he tries to inflict a blow that is fatal;</P>
<P>Sharp is the senior demon's saber</P>
<P>Which he raises without mercy.</P>
<P>These three are the true priest's invincible escorts;</P>
<P>The other three are evil and rebellious spirits.</P>
<P>At first the fight is not so bad,</P>
<P>But later it becomes more murderous.</P>
<P>All six weapons rise up by magic</P>
<P>To twist and turn in the clouds above.</P>
<P>They belch out in an instant clouds that darken the sky,</P>
<P>And the only sounds to be heard are roars and bellows.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After the six of them had been fighting for a long time evening was
 drawing in, and as the wind was also bringing clouds it became dark
 very quickly. Pig was finding it harder and harder to see as his big
 ears were covering his eyelids. His hands and feet were besides too
 slow for him to be able to hold off his opponent, so he fled from the
 fight, dragging his rake behind him. The senior demon chief took a
 swing at him with his sword that almost killed him. Luckily Pig moved
 his head out of the way, so that the blade only cut off a few of his
 bristles. The monster then caught up with Pig, opened his jaws, picked
 Pig up by the collar, carried him into the city and threw him to the
 junior demons to tie up and take to the throne hall. The senior demon
 chief then rose back into the air by cloud to help the other two.</P>
<P>Seeing that things were going badly Friar Sand feinted with his staff
 and turned to flee only to be caught, hands and all, when the second
 demon unraveled his trunk and noisily wrapped it round him. The demon
 took him too into the city, ordering the junior demons to tie him up in
 the palace before rising up into the sky again to tell the others how
 to catch Monkey. Seeing that both his brother disciples had been
 captured Monkey realized that it was going to be impossible for him to
 hold out single-handed. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A couple of fists can defeat a good hand,</P>
<P>But cannot a competent foursome withstand.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>With a shout Brother Monkey pushed the three demons' weapons aside,
 set off his somersault cloud and fled. When the third demon chief saw
 Monkey ride off by somersault he shook himself, resumed his real form,
 spread his wings and caught up with the Great Sage. You may well ask
 how the demon could possibly catch up with him. When Monkey made havoc
 in heaven all that time ago a hundred thousand heavenly soldiers had
 failed to capture him. Because he could cover 36,000 miles in a single
 somersault of his cloud, none of the gods had been able to catch up
 with him. But this evil spirit could cover 30,000 miles with one beat
 of his wings, so that with two beats he caught up with Monkey and
 seized him. Monkey could not get out of the demon's talons no matter
 how hard he struggled or how desperately he longed to escape. Even when
 he used his transformation magic he still could not move. If he made
 himself grow the demon opened his grip but still held firmly to him;
 and if he shrank the demon tightened his clutch. The demon took him
 back inside the city, released his talons, dropped him into the dust,
 and told the fiendish hordes to tie him up and put him with Pig and
 Friar Sand. The senior and the second demon chiefs both came out to
 greet the third chief, who went back up into the throne hall with them.
 Alas! This time they were not tying Monkey up but sending him on his
 way.</P>
<P>It was now the second watch of the night, and after all the demons
 had exchanged greetings the Tang Priest was pushed out of the throne
 hall. When he suddenly caught sight in the lamplight of his three
 disciples all lying tied up on the ground the venerable master leaned
 down beside Brother Monkey and said through his tears, &#8220;Disciple, when
 we meet with trouble you normally go off and use your magic powers to
 subdue the monsters causing it. Now that you too have been captured can
 I survive, poor monk that I am?&#8221; As soon as Pig and Friar Sand heard
 their master's distress they too began to howl together.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry, Master,&#8221; said Monkey with a hint of a smile, &#8220;and don't
 cry, brothers. No matter what they do they won't be able to hurt us.
 When the demon chiefs have settled and are asleep we can be on our
 way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're just making trouble again, brother,&#8221; replied Pig. &#8220;We're
 trussed up with hempen ropes. If we do manage to work them a bit loose
 they spurt water on them to shrink them again. You might be too skinny
 to notice, but fat old me's having a terrible time. If you don't
 believe me take a look at my arms. The rope's cut two inches deep into
 them. I'd never get away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Never mind hempen ropes,&#8221; said Monkey with a laugh, &#8220;even if they
 were coconut cables as thick as a rice-bowl they'd be no more than an
 autumn breeze to me. What's there to make a fuss about?&#8221;</P>
<P>As master and disciples were talking the senior demon could be heard
 saying, &#8220;Third brother, you really are strong and wise. Your plan to
 capture the Tang Priest was brilliant and it worked.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Little ones,&#8221; he called, &#8220;Five of you carry water, seven scrub the
 pans, ten get the fire burning and twenty fetch the iron steamer. When
 we've steamed the four monks tender for my brothers and me to enjoy
 we'll give you juniors a piece so that you can all live for ever.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, trembling, when he this, &#8220;listen. That evil
 spirit's planning to steam and eat us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be afraid,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'm going to find out whether he's
 an evil spirit still wet behind the ears or an old hand.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand, sobbing, &#8220;don't talk so big. We're next
 door to the king of Hell. How can you talk about whether he's wet
 behind the ears or an old hand at a time like this?&#8221; The words were not
 all out of his mouth before the second demon chief was heard to say,
 &#8220;Pig won't steam well.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Amitabha Buddha!&#8221; said Pig with delight. &#8220;I wonder who's building up
 good karma by saying I won't steam well.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If he won't steam well,&#8221; the third chief said, &#8220;skin him before
 steaming him.&#8221; This panicked Pig, who screamed at the top of his voice,
 &#8220;Don't skin me. I may be coarse but I'll go tender if you boil me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If he won't steam well,&#8221; the senior demon chief said, &#8220;put him on
 the bottom tray of the steamer.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry, Pig,&#8221; said Monkey with a laugh, &#8220;he's wet behind the
 ears. He's no old hand.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you tell?&#8221; Friar Sand asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Generally speaking you should start from the top when steaming,&#8221;
 Monkey replied. &#8220;Whatever's hardest to steam should be put on the top
 tray. Add a bit of extra fuel to the fire, get up a good steam and
 it'll be done. But put it at the bottom and lower the steam and you
 won't get the steam up even if you cook it for six months. He must be
 wet behind the ears if he says that Pig should be put on the bottom
 tray because he's hard to cook.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;if he followed your advice I'd be
 slaughtered alive. When he can't see the steam rising he'll take the
 lid off, turn me over and make the fire burn hotter. I'll be cooked on
 both sides and half done in the middle.&#8221;</P>
<P>As they were talking a junior devil came in to report that the water
 was boiling. The senior chief ordered that the monks be carried in, and
 all the demons acted together to carry Pig to the lowest shelf of the
 steamer and Friar Sand to the second shelf.</P>
<P>Guessing that they would be coming for him next Brother Monkey freed
 himself and said, &#8220;This lamplight is just right for some action.&#8221; He
 then pulled out a hair, blew on it with magic breath, called, &#8220;Change!&#8221;
 and turned it into another Monkey he tied up with the hempen rope while
 extracting his real self in spirit form to spring into mid-air, look
 down and watch. Not realizing his deception, the crowd of demons picked
 up the false Monkey they saw and carried him to the third tray of the
 steamer, near the top. Only then did they drag the Tang Priest to the
 ground, tie him up, and put him into the fourth tray. As the dry
 firewood was stacked up a fierce fire blazed.</P>
<P>&#8220;My Pig and Friar Sand can stand a couple of boilings,&#8221; sighed the
 Great Sage up in the clouds, &#8220;but that master of mine will be cooked
 tender as soon as the water boils. If I can't save him by magic he'll
 be dead in next to no time.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage made a hand-spell in mid-air, said the magic
 words &#8220;<I>Om</I> the blue pure dharma world; true is the eternal
 beneficence of Heaven,&#8221; and summoned the Dragon King of the Northern
 Ocean to him.</P>
<P>A black cloud appeared among the other clouds, and from it there came
 at once an answering shout, &#8220;Ao Shun, the humble dragon of the Northern
 Ocean, kowtows in homage.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Arise, arise,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I would not have ventured to trouble
 you for nothing. I've now got this far with my master the Tang Priest.
 He's been captured by vicious monsters and put into an iron steamer to
 be cooked. Go and protect him for me and don't let the steam harm him.&#8221;
 The dragon king at once turned himself into a cold wind that blew
 underneath the cooking pot and coiled around to shield it from all the
 heat of the fire. Thus were the three of them saved from death.</P>
<P>As the third watch was drawing to an end the senior demon chief
 announced a decision. &#8220;My men,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we have worn out brains and
 brawn to capture the Tang Priest and his three disciples. Because of
 the trouble we went to in escorting them we have not slept for four
 days and nights. I don't think that they'll be able to escape now that
 they're tied up and being steamed. You are all to guard them carefully.
 Ten of your junior devils are to take it in turns to keep the fires
 burning while we withdraw to our living quarters for a little rest. By
 the fifth watch, when it's about to get light, they're bound to be
 cooked tender. Have some garlic paste, salt and vinegar ready and wake
 us up; then we'll be able to eat them with a good appetite.&#8221; The devils
 did as they had been ordered while the three demon chiefs returned to
 their sleeping chambers.</P>
<P>Up in the clouds Brother Monkey clearly heard these instructions
 being given, so he brought his cloud down. As there was no sound of
 voices from inside the steamer he thought, &#8220;The fire is blazing away
 and they must be feeling hot. Why aren't they afraid? Why aren't they
 saying anything? Hmm... Could they have been steamed to death? Let me
 go closer and listen.&#8221; The splendid Great Sage shook himself as he
 stood on his cloud and turned into a black fly. As he alighted on the
 outside of the iron steamer's trays to listen he heard Pig saying
 inside, &#8220;What lousy luck! What lousy luck! I wonder whether we're being
 closed-steamed or open-steamed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean by 'closed' and 'open,' brother?&#8221; Friar Sand asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Closed steaming is when they cover the steamer and open steaming is
 when they don't,&#8221; Pig replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciples,&#8221; said Sanzang from the top tray, &#8220;the cover is off.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We're in luck!&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;We won't be killed tonight. We're being
 open-steamed.&#8221; Having heard all three of them talking Monkey realized
 that they were still alive, so he flew away, fetched the iron steamer
 lid and placed it lightly on the steamer.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciples,&#8221; exclaimed Sanzang in alarm, &#8220;they've covered us up.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's done it,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;That means closed steaming. We're bound to die tonight.&#8221; Friar Sand
 and the venerable elder started to sob.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't cry,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;A new shift of cooks has come on duty.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you tell?&#8221; Friar Sand asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I was delighted at first when they carried me here,&#8221; Pig replied.
 &#8220;I've got a bit of a feverish chill and I wanted warming up. But all
 we're getting at the moment is cold air. Hey! Mr. Cook, sir! What are
 you making such a fuss about putting more firewood on for? Am I asking
 for what's yours?&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he could not help laughing to himself. &#8220;Stupid
 clod,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;Being cold is bearable. If it got hot you'd be
 dead. The secret will get out if he goes on talking. I'd better rescue
 him.... No! I'd have to turn back into myself to rescue them, and if I
 did that the ten cooks would see me and start shouting. That would
 disturb the old monsters and I'd be put to a lot more trouble. I'll
 have to use some magic on the cooks first.&#8221; Then a memory came back to
 him.</P>
<P>&#8220;When I was the Great Sage in the old days I once played a guessing
 game with the Heavenly King Lokapala at the Northern Gate of Heaven and
 won some of his sleep insects off him. I've got a few left I can use on
 them.&#8221; He felt around his waist inside his belt and found that he had
 twelve of them left.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll give them ten and keep two to breed from,&#8221; Monkey thought. Then
 he threw the insects into the ten junior devils' faces, where the
 insects went up their nostrils, so that they all started feeling
 drowsy, lay down and went to sleep. One of them, however, who was
 holding a fire-fork slept very fitfully, kept rubbing his head and
 face, pinching his nose and continuously sneezing. &#8220;That so-and-so
 knows a trick or two,&#8221; thought Monkey. &#8220;I'll have to give him a double
 dose.&#8221; He threw one of his remaining insects into the demon's face.</P>
<P>&#8220;With two insects the left one can go in when the right one comes out
 and vice versa,&#8221; Monkey thought. &#8220;That should keep him quiet.&#8221; With
 that the junior demon gave two or three big yawns, stretched himself,
 dropped the fork and slumped down, fast asleep. He did not get up
 again.</P>
<P>&#8220;What marvellous magic; it really works,&#8221; said Monkey, turning back
 into himself. Then he went close to the steamer and called, &#8220;Master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Rescue me, Wukong,&#8221; said the Tang Priest when he heard him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Is that you calling to us from outside?&#8221; Friar Sand asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;If I weren't out here would you prefer me to be suffering in there
 with you?&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;you slipped off and left us to carry the can.
 We're being closed-steamed in here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop yelling, idiot,&#8221; said Monkey with a laugh. &#8220;I'm here to rescue
 you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;if you're going to rescue us do it properly.
 Don't get us put back in here for another steaming.&#8221; Monkey then took
 the lid off, freed the master, shook the hair of his that he had turned
 into an imitation Monkey and put it back on his body, then released
 Friar Sand and Pig, taking one tray at a time. As soon as he was
 untied, the idiot wanted to run away.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be in such a hurry!&#8221; said Monkey, who recited the words of a
 spell that released the dragon before going on to say to Pig, &#8220;We've
 still got high mountains and steep ridges ahead of us on our way to the
 Western Heaven. The going's too heavy for the master&#8212;he isn't a strong
 walker. Wait till I've fetched the horse.&#8221;</P>
<P>Watch him as with light step he goes to the throne hall, where he saw
 that all the demons young and old were asleep. He undid the rope
 attached to the horse's reins, being even more careful not to alarm
 him. Now the horse was a dragon horse, so had Monkey been a stranger he
 would have given him a couple of flying kicks and whinnied. But Monkey
 had kept horses and held the office of Protector of the Horses, and
 this horse was besides their own. That was why the animal neither
 reared nor whinnied. Monkey led the horse very quietly over, tightened
 the girth and got everything ready before inviting his master to mount.
 Trembling and shaking, the Tang Priest did so. He too wanted to go.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't you be in such a hurry either,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;There'll be
 plenty more kings along our journey West and we'll need our passport if
 we're to get there. What other identity papers do we have? I'm going
 back to find the luggage.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I remember that when we came in the monsters put the luggage to the
 left of the throne hall,&#8221; said the Tang Priest. &#8220;The loads must still
 be there.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Understood,&#8221; said Monkey, who sprang off at once to search for it by
 the throne hall. When he suddenly saw shimmering lights of many colours
 Brother Monkey knew that they came from the luggage. How did he know?
 Because the light came from the night-shining pearl on the Tang
 Priest's cassock. He rushed towards it and found that their load was
 unopened, so he took it out and gave it to Friar Sand to carry. While
 Pig guided the horse, the Great Sage took the lead.</P>
<P>They were hurrying to go straight out through the main Southern gate
 when they heard the noise of watchmen's clappers and bells. They found
 the gates locked and paper seals over the locks.</P>
<P>&#8220;How are we going to get out if the place is so closely guarded?&#8221;
 Monkey wondered.</P>
<P>&#8220;Let's get out the back door,&#8221; said Pig. With Monkey leading the way
 they rushed straight to the back gates.</P>
<P>&#8220;I can hear clappers and bells outside the back gates as well, and
 they're sealed too,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;What are we to do? If it weren't for
 the Tang Priest's mortal body it wouldn't bother us three: we could get
 away by cloud and wind. But the Tang Priest hasn't escaped from the
 Three Worlds and is still confined within the Five Elements. All his
 bones are the unclean ones he got from his mother and father. He can't
 lift himself into the air and he'll never get away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No time for talking now, brother,&#8221; said Pig: &#8220;Let's go somewhere
 where there aren't any bells, clappers or guards, lift the master up
 and climb over the wall.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That won't do,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;We could lift him over now because
 we've got to, but you've got such a big mouth you'd tell people
 everywhere when we're taking the scriptures back that we're the sort of
 monks who sneak over people's walls.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But we can't bother about behaving properly now,&#8221; replied Pig.
 &#8220;We've got to save our skins.&#8221; Monkey had no choice but to do as he
 suggested, so they went up to wall and worked out how to climb over.</P>
<P>Oh dear! Things would have to work out this way: Sanzang was not yet
 free of his unlucky star. The three demon chiefs who had been fast
 asleep in their living quarters suddenly awoke and, fearing that the
 Tang Priest had escaped, got up, threw on their clothes and hurried to
 the throne hall of the palace.</P>
<P>&#8220;How many times has the Tang Priest been steamed?&#8221; they asked. The
 junior devils who were looking after the fires were all so soundly
 asleep because the sleep insects were in them that not even blows could
 wake them up.</P>
<P>The chiefs woke up some others who were not on duty, who answered
 rashly, &#8220;Ss...ss...seven times.&#8221; Then they rushed over to the steamer
 to see the steamer trays lying scattered on the floor and the cooks
 still asleep.</P>
<P>In their alarm they rushed back to report, &#8220;Your Majesties,
 th...th...they've escaped.&#8221;</P>
<P>The three demon chiefs came out of the throne hall to take a close
 look around the cauldron. They saw that the steamer trays were indeed
 scattered on the floor, the water was stonecold and the fire completely
 out. The cooks supposed to be tending the fire were still so fast
 asleep that they were snoring noisily.</P>
<P>The fiends were all so shocked that they all shouted, &#8220;Catch the Tang
 Priest! At once! Catch the Tang Priest!&#8221; Their yells woke up the demons
 senior and junior all around. They rushed in a crowd to the main front
 gates carrying their swords and spears.</P>
<P>Seeing that the sealed locks had not been touched and that the night
 watchmen were still sounding their clappers and bells they asked the
 watchman, &#8220;Which way did the Tang Priest go?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Nobody's come out,&#8221; the watchmen all replied. They hurried to the
 back gates of the palace, only to find that the seals, locks, clappers
 and bells were the same as at the front. With a great commotion they
 grabbed lanterns and torches, making the sky red and the place as
 bright as day. The four of them were clearly lit up as they climbed
 over the wall.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where do you think you're going?&#8221; the senior demon chief shouted,
 running towards them and so terrifying the reverend gentleman that the
 muscles in his legs turned soft and numb and he fell off the wall to be
 captured by the senior demon. The second demon chief seized Friar Sand
 and the third knocked Pig over and captured him. The other demons took
 the luggage and the white horse. Only Monkey escaped.</P>
<P>&#8220;May Heaven kill him,&#8221; Pig grumbled under his breath about Monkey. &#8220;I
 said that if he was going to rescue us he ought to do a thorough job of
 it. As it is we're going to be put back in the steamer for another
 steaming.&#8221;</P>
<P>The monsters took the Tang Priest into the throne hall but did not
 steam him again. The second demon chief ordered that Pig was to be tied
 to one of the columns supporting the eaves in front of the hall and the
 third chief had Friar Sand tied to one of the columns holding up the
 eaves at the back. The senior chief clung to the Tang Priest and would
 not let go of him.</P>
<P>&#8220;What are you holding him for, elder brother?&#8221; the third demon asked.
 &#8220;Surely you're not going to eat him alive. That wouldn't be at all
 interesting. He's no ordinary idiot to be gobbled up just to fill your
 stomach. He's a rare delicacy from a superior country. We should keep
 him till we have some free time one rainy day, then bring him out to be
 carefully cooked and enjoyed with drinking games and fine music.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;A very good suggestion, brother,&#8221; replied the senior demon with a
 smile, &#8220;but Sun the Novice would come and steal him again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In our palace we have a Brocade Fragrance Pavilion,&#8221; said the third
 demon, &#8220;and in the pavilion is an iron chest. I think we should put the
 Tang Priest into the chest, shut up the pavilion, put out a rumour that
 we have already eaten him half raw and get all the junior devils in the
 city talking about it. That Sun the Novice is bound to come back to
 find out what's happening, and when he hears this he'll be so miserably
 disappointed that he'll go away. If he doesn't come to make trouble for
 another four or five days we can bring the Tang Priest out to enjoy at
 our leisure. What do you think?&#8221;</P>
<P>The senior and second demon chiefs were both delighted. &#8220;Yes, yes,
 you're right, brother,&#8221; they said. That very night the poor Tang Priest
 was taken inside the palace, put into the chest and locked up in the
 pavilion. We will not tell how the rumour was spread and became the
 talk of the town.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Instead the story tells how Monkey escaped that night by cloud,
 unable to look after the Tang Priest. He went straight to Lion Cave
 where he wiped out all the tens of thousands of junior demons with his
 cudgel to his complete satisfaction. By the time he had hurried back to
 the city the sun was rising in the East. He did not dare challenge the
 demons to battle because</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>No thread can be spun from a single strand;</P>
<P>Nobody can clap with a single hand.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>So he brought his cloud down, shook himself, turned himself into a
 junior demon and slipped in through the gates to collect news in the
 streets and back alleys. &#8220;The Tang Priest was eaten raw by the senior
 king during the night,&#8221; was what all the people in the city were saying
 wherever he went. This made Brother Monkey really anxious. When he went
 to look at the throne hall in the palace he saw that there were many
 spirits constantly coming and going. They were wearing leather and
 metal helmets and yellow cotton tunics. In their hands they held red
 lacquered staves, and ivory passes hung at their waists.</P>
<P>&#8220;These must be evil spirits who are allowed in the inner quarters of
 the palace,&#8221; thought Monkey. &#8220;I'll turn myself into one, go in and see
 what I can find out.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage then made himself identical to the demons and
 slipped in through the inner gates of the palace. As he was walking
 along he saw Pig tied to one of the columns of the throne hall,
 groaning.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wuneng,&#8221; Monkey said, going up to him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Is that you, brother?&#8221; asked the idiot, recognizing his voice. &#8220;Save
 me!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll save you,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Do you know where the master is?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He's done for,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;The evil spirits ate him raw last
 night.&#8221; At this Monkey burst into sobs and the tears gushed out like
 water from a spring.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't cry, brother,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;I've only heard the junior devils
 gossiping. I didn't see it with my own eyes. Don't waste any more time.
 Go on and find out more.&#8221; Only then did Monkey dry his tears and go to
 search in the inner part of the palace.</P>
<P>Noticing Friar Sand tied to a column at the back of the palace he
 went up to him, felt his chest and said, &#8220;Wujing.&#8221;</P>
<P>Friar Sand also recognized his voice and said, &#8220;Brother, is that you
 here in disguise? Save me! Save me!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Saving you will be easy,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;but do you know where the
 master is?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother!&#8221; said Friar Sand in tears. &#8220;The evil spirits couldn't even
 wait to steam the master. They've eaten him raw.&#8221;</P>
<P>Now that both of them had told him the same story the Great Sage was
 cut to the heart. Instead of rescuing Pig and Friar Sand he sprang
 straight up into the sky and went to the mountain East of the city,
 where he landed his cloud and let himself weep aloud.</P>
<P>&#8220;Poor Master,&#8221; he said:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;I fought against heaven, was caught in its net,</P>
<P>Till you came along and delivered me, Master.</P>
<P>It became my ambition to worship the Buddha;</P>
<P>I strove to eliminate fiendish disaster.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;I never imagined that now you'd be murdered</P>
<P>And I would have failed on your journey to keep you.</P>
<P>The lands of the West were too good for your fate.</P>
<P>Your life's at an end: in what way can I help you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Deep in misery, Monkey said to himself, &#8220;It's all the fault of our
 Buddha, the Tathagata, who had nothing better to do in his paradise
 than make the three stores of scriptures. If he really wanted to
 convert people to be good he ought to have sent them to the East
 himself. Then they would have been passed on for ever. But he couldn't
 bring himself to part with them. He had to make us go to fetch them.
 Who'd ever have thought that after all the trouble of crossing a
 thousand mountains the master would lose his life here today? Oh well!
 I'll ride my somersault cloud to see the Tathagata Buddha and tell him
 what's happened. If he's willing to give me the scriptures to deliver
 to the East then the good achievement will be propagated and we'll be
 able to fulfil our vow. If he won't give me them I'll get him to recite
 the Band-loosening Spell. Then I can take the band off, return it to
 him and go back to my own cave to play the king and enjoy myself
 again.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage jumped to his feet and went straight to India
 on his somersault cloud. In less than a couple of hours he could see
 the Vulture Peak in the near distance, and an instant later he had
 landed his cloud and was heading straight for the foot of the peak. He
 looked up and saw the four vajrapanis blocking his way and asking him
 where he was going.</P>
<P>&#8220;There's something I want to see the Tathagata about,&#8221; Monkey replied
 with a bow.</P>
<P>Next he was faced by the Vajrapani Yongzhu, the indestructible king
 of Golden Glow Ridge on Mount Kunlun, who shouted, &#8220;Macaque, you're an
 outrage! When the Bull Demon King was giving you such terrible trouble
 we all helped you, but now you've come to see us today you're showing
 no manners at all. If you're here on business you should submit a
 memorial first and wait till you're summoned before going any further.
 This isn't like the Southern Gate of Heaven, where you can come and go
 as you please. Clear off! Out of the way!&#8221;</P>
<P>Being told off like this when he was feeling so depressed drove
 Monkey into thundering roars of fury, and his uncontrollable shouts and
 yells soon disturbed the Tathagata.</P>
<P>The Tathagata Buddha was sitting on his nine-level lotus throne
 expounding the sutras to his eighteen arhats when he said, &#8220;Sun Wukong
 is here. You must all go out to receive him.&#8221; In obedience to the
 Buddha's command the arhats went out in two columns with their banners
 and canopies.</P>
<P>&#8220;Great Sage Sun,&#8221; they said in greeting, &#8220;the Tathagata has commanded
 us to summon you to his presence.&#8221; Only then did the four vajrapanis at
 the monastery gates step aside to let Monkey enter. The arhats led him
 to the foot of the lotus throne, where he went down to kowtow on seeing
 the Tathagata. He was sobbing and weeping.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said the Buddha, &#8220;what makes you weep so miserably?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your disciple has often received the grace of your instruction,&#8221;
 Brother Monkey replied, &#8220;and has committed himself to the school of
 Lord Buddha. Since being converted to the true achievement I have taken
 the Tang Priest as my master and been protecting him on our journey. No
 words could describe what we have suffered. We have now reached the
 city of Leonia near Lion Cave on Lion Mountain where three vicious
 monsters, the Lion King, the Elephant King and the Great Roc, seized my
 master. All of us disciples of his were in a very bad way too, tied up
 and put in a steamer to suffer the agony of fire and boiling water.
 Fortunately I was able to get away and summon a dragon king to save the
 others. But we could not escape our evil star: the master and the
 others were recaptured when I was trying to sneak them out last night.
 When I went back into the city this morning to find out what had
 happened I learned that those utterly evil and ferocious monsters ate
 my master raw during the night. Nothing is left of his flesh and bones.
 On top of that my fellow-disciples Wuneng and Wujing are tied up there
 and will soon be dead too. I'm desperate. That's why your disciple has
 come to visit the Tathagata. I beg you in your great compassion to
 recite the Band-loosening Spell so that I can take the band off my head
 and give it back to you. Let your disciple go back to the Mountain of
 Flowers and Fruit and enjoy himself.&#8221; Before he had finished saying
 this the tears welled up again. There was no end to his howls of
 misery.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't upset yourself so, Wukong,&#8221; said the Tathagata with a smile.
 &#8220;You can't beat those evil spirits. Their magical powers are more than
 you can handle. That is why you are so unhappy.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey knelt below the Buddha and beat his breast as he replied,
 &#8220;Truly, Tathagata, I made havoc in Heaven all those years ago and was
 called Great Sage. Never in all my life had I been beaten before I met
 these vicious monsters.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop being so sorry for yourself,&#8221; said the Tathagata. &#8220;I know those
 evil spirits.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Tathagata!&#8221; Monkey suddenly blurted out. &#8220;They say those evil
 spirits are relations of yours.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wicked macaque!&#8221; said the Tathagata. &#8220;How could an evil spirit be
 any relation of mine?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If they're not relations of yours how come you know them?&#8221; retorted
 Monkey with a grin.</P>
<P>&#8220;I know them because I see them with my all-seeing eyes,&#8221; the Buddha
 replied. &#8220;The senior demon and the second demon have masters. Ananda,
 Kasyapa, come here. One of you is to take a cloud to Mount Wutai and
 the other to Mount Emei. Summon Manjusri and Samantabhadra to come and
 see me.&#8221; The two arhats left at once as they had been commanded. &#8220;They
 are the masters of the senior and the second demon chiefs. But the
 third demon does have some connection with me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;On his mother's or his father's side?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;When the primal chaos was first separated the heavens opened up in
 the hour of the rat and the earth at the hour of the ox,&#8221; the Buddha
 replied. &#8220;Mankind was born at the tiger hour. Then heaven and earth
 came together again and all living creatures were born, including
 beasts that walk and birds that fly. The unicorn is the most senior of
 the beasts that walk and the phoenix is the most senior of the birds
 that fly. When the phoenixes combined their essential spirit they gave
 birth to the peafowl and the Great Roc. When the peafowl came into the
 world she was the most evil of creatures and a man-eater. She could
 devour all the people for fifteen miles around in a single mouthful.
 When I was cultivating my sixteen-foot golden body on the peak of the
 snowy mountain she swallowed me as well. I went down into her belly. I
 wanted to escape through her backside, but for fear of soiling my body
 I cut my way out through her backbone and climbed Vulture Peak. I would
 have killed her, but all the Buddha host dissuaded me: to kill the
 peahen would have been like killing my own mother. So I kept her at my
 assembly on Vulture Peak and appointed her as the Buddha-mother, the
 Great Illustrious Peahen Queen Bodhisattva. The Great Roc was born of
 the same mother as she was. That is why we are relations of a kind.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he said with a smile, &#8220;By that line of
 argument, Tathagata, you're the evil spirit's nephew.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I shall have to go and subdue that demon in person,&#8221; the Tathagata
 said. Monkey kowtowed as he respectfully replied, &#8220;I beg you to
 condescend to grant us your illustrious presence.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Tathagata then came down from his lotus throne and went out
 through the monastery gates with all the Buddha host just as Ananda and
 Kasyapa arrived bringing Manjusri and Samantabhadra. These two
 Bodhisattvas bowed to the Tathagata, who asked them, &#8220;How long have
 your animals been away from your mountains, Bodhisattvas?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Seven days,&#8221; said Manjusri.</P>
<P>&#8220;A mere seven days on your mountains is several thousand years in the
 mortal world,&#8221; the Tathagata replied. &#8220;Goodness knows how many living
 beings they have destroyed there. Come with me to recapture them at
 once.&#8221;</P>
<P>The two Bodhisattvas traveled at the Buddha's left and right hand as
 they flew through the air with the host. This is what could be seen:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The shimmering clouds of blessing parted for Lord Buddha</P>
<P>As in his great compassion he came down from his shrine.</P>
<P>He taught the truth about all beings since creation,</P>
<P>Explaining how everything had been transformed in time.</P>
<P>Before him went five hundred holy arhats;</P>
<P>Behind him were three thousand guardians of the faith.</P>
<P>Ananda and Kasyapa were both in close attendance;</P>
<P>Samantabhadra and Manjusri came to conquer monsters.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Great Sage had been granted this favour and succeeded in bringing
 the Lord Buddha and his host with him. It was not long before the city
 was in sight. &#8220;Tathagata,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;that's Leonia, where the black
 vapors are coming from.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You go down into the city first,&#8221; said the Tathagata, &#8220;and start a
 fight with the evil spirits. Do not win. You must lose and come back
 up. Leave it to us to recapture them.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Great Sage then brought his cloud straight down to land on the
 city wall, where he stood on the battlements and shouted abusively,
 &#8220;Evil beasts! Come out and fight me at once!&#8221; This caused such
 consternation among the junior demons in the towers on the wall that
 they jumped straight down into the city to report, &#8220;Your Majesties, Sun
 the Novice is on the wall, challenging us to battle.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That ape hasn't been here for two or three days,&#8221; the senior demon
 replied. &#8220;Now he's back challenging us to battle. Can he have fetched
 some reinforcements?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He's nothing to be scared of,&#8221; said the third demon chief. &#8220;Let's
 all go and have a look.&#8221; The three chieftains, all carrying their
 weapons, hurried up on the wall where they saw Monkey. Without a word
 they raised their weapons and thrust at him. Monkey held them off by
 swinging his iron cudgel. When they had fought seven or eight rounds
 Monkey feigned defeat and fled.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where do you think you're going?&#8221; the demon king asked with a mighty
 shout, and with a somersault Monkey sprang up into mid-air. The three
 spirits went after him on clouds, but Monkey slipped aside and
 disappeared completely in the Lord Buddha's golden aura.</P>
<P>All that could be seen were the images of the Three Buddhas of Past,
 Future and Present, the five hundred arhats and the three thousand
 Protectors of the Faith who spread all around, encircling the three
 demon kings so closely that not even a drop of water could leak
 through.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is terrible, my brother,&#8221; said the senior demon chief, lashing
 out wildly, &#8220;that ape is a really sharp operator. How did he manage to
 bring my master here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be afraid, elder brother,&#8221; said the third demon. &#8220;If we all
 charge together we can cut down the Tathagata with our swords and
 spears and seize his Thunder Monastery.&#8221; The demons, who had no sense
 of proper behavior, really did raise their swords to charge forward,
 hacking wildly.</P>
<P>Manjusri and Samantabhadra recited the words of a spell and shouted,
 &#8220;Won't you repent now, evil beasts? What else do you hope for?&#8221; The
 senior and the second demon chiefs gave up the struggle, threw down
 their weapons, rolled and reverted to their true images. The two
 Bodhisattvas threw their lotus thrones on the demons' backs and flew
 over to sit on them. The two demons then gave up and submitted.</P>
<P>Now that the blue lion and the white elephant had been captured only
 the third evil monster was still unsubdued. Spreading its wings it
 dropped its heaven-square halberd and rose straight up to try to catch
 the Monkey King with a swing of its sharp talons, but as the Great Sage
 was biding in the golden aura the demon dared get nowhere near him.
 When the<I></I> Tathagata realized what it was trying to do he made his
 golden aura flash and shook his head, the supreme meditator in the
 wind, to turn the creature into a bright red lump of bloody meat. The
 evil spirit seized it with a flourish of its sharp talons, whereupon
 the Lord Buddha pointed upwards with his hand, destroying the muscles
 in the monster's wings. It could not fly or get away from the top of
 the Buddha's head, and it reverted to its true appearance as a
 golden-winged vulture.</P>
<P>Opening its beak it said to the Buddha, &#8220;Tathagata, why did you use
 your great dharma powers to catch me like this?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You have been doing much evil here,&#8221; the Tathagata replied. &#8220;Come
 with me and you will win credit for a good deed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You eat vegetarian food in great poverty and suffering at your
 place,&#8221; the evil spirit replied, &#8220;but here I can eat human flesh and
 live in no end of luxury. If you kill me by starvation you'll be guilty
 of a sin.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In the four continents I control countless living beings who worship
 me,&#8221; the Buddha replied, &#8220;and whenever they are going to perform a
 service to me I shall tell them to make a sacrifice to you first.&#8221; The
 Great Roc would have escaped and got away if it could. As it was he had
 no choice but to accept conversion.</P>
<P>Only then did Monkey emerge to kowtow to the Tathagata and say, &#8220;Lord
 Buddha, today you have captured the evil spirits and removed a great
 bane, but my master is dead.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this the Great Roc said bitterly as it ground its teeth, &#8220;Damned
 ape! Why did you have to bring these ferocious men here to persecute
 me? I never ate that old monk of yours. He's in the Brocade Fragrance
 Pavilion now, isn't he?&#8221; When Monkey heard this he quickly kowtowed to
 thank the Lord Buddha. Not daring to release the Great Roc, the Buddha
 made him into a guardian of the dharma in his brilliant halo then led
 his host back to his monastery on their clouds. Monkey landed his cloud
 and went straight into the city, where there was not a single junior
 demon left. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A snake cannot move without its head;</P>
<P>A bird cannot fly without its wings.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>They had all fled for their lives when they saw the Buddha capturing
 their evil kings.</P>
<P>Monkey then freed Pig and Friar Sand, found the luggage and the
 horse, and said to his fellow-disciples, &#8220;The master hasn't been eaten.
 Come with me.&#8221; He took the two of them straight into the inner compound
 where they found the Brocade Fragrance Pavilion. Opening the door and
 looking inside they saw an iron trunk from which could be heard the
 sound of Sanzang weeping.</P>
<P>Friar Sand used his demon-quelling staff to open the iron cage over
 the chest and raise its lid. &#8220;Master,&#8221; he called.</P>
<P>At the sight of them Sanzang wept aloud and said, &#8220;Disciples, how
 were the demons beaten? How did you manage to find me here?&#8221; Monkey
 told him all the details of what had happened from beginning to end and
 Sanzang expressed boundless gratitude. Then master and disciples found
 some rice in the palace and ate their fill of it before packing their
 things and leaving the city along the main road West. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Only a true man can find the true scriptures;</P>
<P>The will's shouts and the heart's labors are in vain.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know when on this journey they were to see the Tathagata
 listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<P></P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="1_0_79">Chapter 78</A></H3>
</I>
<P>In Bhiksuland the Hidden Gods Are Sent on an Errand of Mercy</P>
<P>In the Palace the Monster Is Revealed and the Way Discussed</P>
</B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A single thought at once disturbs a hundred monsters;</P>
<P>The hardest efforts are all to no avail.</P>
<P>One can only wash away each speck of dust,</P>
<P>Tidy everything and polish well.</P>
<P>Sweep all causation away and come to nirvana;</P>
<P>Waste no time and destroy the thousand demons.</P>
<P>You surely will be free from obstructions,</P>
<P>And rise to the Daluo Heaven when your deeds are done.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story tells how the Great Sage Sun used all his ingenuity to
 fetch the Tathagata to subdue the demons and rescue Sanzang and the
 other two disciples, after which they left the city of Leonia and
 headed West. When they had been travelling for several more months it
 was winter, and this is what could be seen:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The plum on the ridge was like broken jade</P>
<P>As the water in the pond slowly turned to ice.</P>
<P>All the red autumn leaves had fallen,</P>
<P>And the green of the pine looked fresher than ever.</P>
<P>The pale and scudding clouds were on the point of snowing;</P>
<P>Flat lay the withered grass upon the hills.</P>
<P>As far as the eye could see was chilly brightness</P>
<P>As the unseen cold went right into the bone.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Master and disciples braved the cold, sleeping out in the rain and
 dining off the wind, until as they were walking along another walled
 and moated city came into sight. &#8220;What sort of place is that over
 there, Wukong?&#8221; Sanzang asked Monkey, who replied, &#8220;We'll know when we
 get there. If it's the capital of a Western kingdom we'll have to
 present our passport to be inspected and returned. If it's a prefecture
 or county town we'll go straight through.&#8221; Before master and disciples
 could finish their conversation they had arrived at the city gates.</P>
<P>Sanzang dismounted and the four of them went in through the curtain
 wall outside the gates. Noticing an old soldier sleeping shielded from
 the wind under the South-facing wall, Brother Monkey went up to him,
 shook him and said, &#8220;Sir!&#8221;</P>
<P>When the old soldier awoke with a start to open his bleary eyes and
 see Monkey he fell to his knees to kowtow and say, &#8220;My Lord!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no need for such alarm,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'm no evil god, so
 why call me your lord?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Aren't you Lord Thunder God?&#8221; the old soldier asked, kowtowing
 again.</P>
<P>&#8220;What a thing to say,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;We're monks from the East on
 our way to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven. We've just
 arrived here. Could I ask what this place is called?&#8221; This answer
 finally eased the old soldier's mind.</P>
<P>With a yawn he got back on his feet, stretched and said, &#8220;Please
 forgive me, reverend gentlemen. This country used to be called
 Bhiksuland but its name has been changed to Boytown.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do you have a king?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; the old soldier replied.</P>
<P>Monkey then turned to report to the Tang Priest, &#8220;This country used
 to be called Bhiksuland but the name's been altered to Boytown, though
 I don't know what the change signifies.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If it was Bhiksuland before why is it Boytown now?&#8221; the Tang Priest
 wondered.</P>
<P>&#8220;I expect there was a King Bhiksu who died,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;and they
 changed the name to Boytown when a boy succeeded him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Impossible,&#8221; said the Tang Priest, &#8220;impossible. Let's go in and make
 some enquiries in the street.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's right,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;The old soldier wouldn't have known
 anyhow, and on top of that elder brother gave him such a fright that he
 talked nonsense. We'll ask some more questions in the city.&#8221;</P>
<P>When they had gone through the third pair of gates they came to a
 great market on a main street. The people were well-dressed and their
 bearing distinguished.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A hubbub of voices came from bar and music hall;</P>
<P>High hung the curtains outside splendid shop and teahouse.</P>
<P>Business was good in firms by the thousand;</P>
<P>Wealth flowed free in shopping street and market.</P>
<P>The dealers in metal and silk were swarming like ants,</P>
<P>Caring only for money while struggling for fame and wealth.</P>
<P>With these noble manners, magnificent scenery</P>
<P>And peaceful waters it was a time of prosperity.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The master and his three disciples, who were leading the horse and
 carrying the baggage, spent some time walking around the streets as
 they admired the general air of prosperity. In the entrance to every
 house there was a basketwork coop of the sort geese are kept in.
 &#8220;Disciples,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;why do all the people here put coops in
 their gateways?&#8221; Pig's response to this was to look around and see that
 there were indeed lines of coops hung with satin curtains of many
 colours. &#8220;Master,&#8221; said the idiot with a smile, &#8220;today must be a lucky
 one for weddings and celebrations. Everybody's having a wedding.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;How could every single family possibly be
 having a wedding? There must be some other reason for this. I'm going
 over to take a look.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're not to go,&#8221; said Sanzang, grabbing hold of him. &#8220;You look so
 ugly that people might take offence.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll go as something else,&#8221; Brother Monkey replied.</P>
<P>Making a spell with his hands the splendid Great Sage said the words
 of a spell, shook himself, turned into a bee, spread his wings, flew to
 one of the coops and slipped in through the curtains to take a look. A
 little boy was sitting inside. Monkey looked inside another family's
 coop and there was a child in that too. He inspected eight or nine
 households and all of them had a child. All were boys: there was not a
 single girl. Some were sitting up in their coops and playing and some
 were crying; some were eating fruit and some were snoozing.</P>
<P>His inspection over, Monkey turned back into his normal self and
 reported to the Tang Priest, &#8220;There are little boys in the coops. The
 oldest is under six and the youngest only four. I don't know why
 they're here.&#8221; Sanzang wondered what the explanation could be.</P>
<P>Turning a comer they saw the gateway to an official building. It was
 a government hostel with golden pavilions. The venerable elder was
 delighted.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciples,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we will go into this hostel. We can find out
 where we are, give the horse a rest and put up for the night.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, that's right,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;Let's go straight in.&#8221; This
 the four of them happily did, a fact that the officials there reported
 to the hostel's superintendent.</P>
<P>When the superintendent had led them inside greetings had been
 exchanged and they had all sat down, the superintendent asked, &#8220;Where
 have you come from, reverend sir?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am a monk sent by the Great Tang in the East to fetch the
 scriptures from the Western Heaven,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;Now that we have
 arrived at this excellent establishment I will of course present my
 passport for inspection. Could we, I wonder, impose on your hospitality
 for the night?&#8221;</P>
<P>The superintendent ordered tea, and when it had been drank he saw to
 their entertainment and told the staff who were on duty to look after
 the pilgrims. After thanking him for this Sanzang went on to ask,
 &#8220;Could we go to the palace today to see His Majesty and have our
 passport inspected?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That will not be possible this evening,&#8221; the superintendent replied.
 &#8220;It will have to wait until tomorrow morning. I hope that you will
 spend a comfortable night in this humble hostel.&#8221;</P>
<P>A little later, when all had been prepared, the superintendent of the
 hostel invited the four travelers to take a vegetarian meal with him.
 He also told his staff to sweep out the guest rooms for them to spend
 the night in. Sanzang expressed endless gratitude. When they were all
 seated the venerable elder said, &#8220;I wonder if I could trouble you for
 information on something that I cannot understand. How do you raise
 children in your country?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;People are the same the whole world over, just as there are never
 two suns in the sky,&#8221; the superintendent replied. &#8220;Children are born
 when their time comes after the father's seed has joined with the
 mother's blood and they have been in the womb for ten lunar months.
 After they are born they are suckled for three years and their bodies
 gradually grow. Everybody knows that.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What you tell me is no different from how they grow in my humble
 country,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;But when we came into the city we saw a
 goose coop with a little boy inside in front of every house in the
 street. This is something I cannot understand, which is why I ventured
 to raise the question.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Ignore that, reverend sir,&#8221; whispered the hostel superintendent into
 Sanzang's ear. &#8220;Don't ask about it. Put it out of your mind. Don't even
 mention it. Would you like to settle down for the night before starting
 your journey again tomorrow morning?&#8221; Sanzang's response was to seize
 hold of the superintendent and demand an explanation.</P>
<P>&#8220;Watch your words,&#8221; the superintendent replied, shaking his head and
 wagging his finger, but Sanzang was not going to drop the matter. He
 insisted on being told all the details. The superintendent had no
 choice but to dismiss all the staff on duty.</P>
<P>When they were alone under the lamplight he whispered to Sanzang,
 &#8220;The goose coops you asked about are there because our king is a bad
 ruler. Why ever do you have to keep asking about it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How is he a bad ruler?&#8221; Sanzang asked. &#8220;I will not be able to set my
 mind at ease until you give me an explanation.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This country is really called Bhiksuland,&#8221; the superintendent
 replied. &#8220;Boytown is only what the people have started calling it.
 Three years ago an old man dressed as a Taoist came here with a girl
 just fifteen years old. She was a ravishing beauty, just like a
 Bodhisattva Guanyin. He presented her to our present king, who was so
 smitten by her charms that she became the favorite of all his women.
 She was given the title Queen Beauty. For some time now he's had no
 eyes for any of his other queens or consorts. He's so insatiable that
 he's been at it day and night. The result is nervous exhaustion and
 physical collapse. He's eating and drinking next to nothing. He might
 die at any moment. The Royal College of Physicians has tried every
 possible medicine without any success. The Taoist who presented the
 girl to the king was rewarded with the title of Elder of the Nation. He
 has a secret foreign formula for making people live a great deal
 longer. He's been to ten continents and the three magic islands to
 collect the ingredients. Everything is ready. The only problem is that
 it needs a terrible adjuvant to help it&#8212;a potion made from the hearts
 of 1,111 little boys. When he's taken it he'll have a thousand years of
 vigorous life ahead of him. All the little boys being kept in the coops
 are the ones that have been chosen. Their parents are so afraid of the
 king that none of them dares weep. That's why they've put out the story
 that this place is now called Boytown. When you go to the palace
 tomorrow morning, reverend sir, you must only present your passport to
 be inspected and returned. Say nothing about any of this.&#8221; When he had
 said all this he left them.</P>
<P>Sanzang was so horrified by what he had heard that his bones turned
 soft and his muscles went numb. He could not help the tears that
 streamed down his face as he started sobbing aloud. &#8220;Foolish king,&#8221; he
 exclaimed, &#8220;foolish king. Your lechery has ruined your health, and now
 you are planning to destroy all those young lives. How could you? What
 misery! The pain of it all is killing me.&#8221; There is a poem about it
 that goes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The wicked monarch's folly makes him forget the truth;</P>
<P>His health is ruined by his unbridled lusts.</P>
<P>Pursuing eternal life by killing little children,</P>
<P>He slaughters his subjects to avoid Heaven's punishment.</P>
<P>This is all more than the merciful monk can bear:</P>
<P>He cannot accept the official's worldly wisdom.</P>
<P>Long are his sighs as he weeps in the lamplight;</P>
<P>Stricken with grief is the Buddha worshipper.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Pig, going up to him, &#8220;what's the matter with you?
 What you're doing is like taking a stranger's coffin to your own home
 and weeping over it. Don't upset yourself like that. As the rhyme goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When a monarch insists that his subjects will die</P>
<P>None that are loyal to live will aspire;</P>
<P>When a father commands his own offspring to perish</P>
<P>Any dutiful son will most surely expire.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The people he's going to kill are his own subjects. What are they to
 you? Take off your clothes, get some sleep and 'don't worry about the
 ancients.'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang, his tears still flowing, &#8220;you haven't a
 shred of compassion. The most important thing for us monks as we
 accumulate good deeds is to help others. How could this deluded king be
 so set in his wickedness? Never have I ever heard that eating human
 hearts could prolong life. How could something so terrible not grieve
 me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't grieve so, Master,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;When you present our
 passport tomorrow and seethe king you can talk to him about it. Even if
 he doesn't accept your advice you'll be able to see what the Elder of
 the Nation looks like. Probably he's an evil spirit who's thought all
 this up because he wants to eat human hearts.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wujing is right,&#8221; said Brother Monkey. &#8220;Go to bed now, Master, and
 tomorrow morning I'll go to court with you to see what this Elder of
 the Nation is like. If he's human he's probably a heretic who doesn't
 follow orthodox ways but believes in drugs, and I'll convert him with
 the essential teachings of intrinsic nature. If he's an evil spirit
 I'll catch him, show the king what he is, and urge the king to control
 his desires and build up his strength. Whatever happens I won't let him
 kill those children.&#8221;</P>
<P>As soon as he heard this Sanzang bowed to Monkey with great courtesy
 and said, &#8220;What an excellent suggestion! But when we see the deluded
 king we must say nothing about this in case he thinks we are guilty of
 not knowing our place and spreading slander. What could we do if that
 happened?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've got my magic powers,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;First of all I'm going
 to get the little boys in the coops away from the city so that he'll
 have nobody to take the hearts out of tomorrow. The local officials
 will of course report this and the king will be bound either to order a
 discussion with the Elder of the Nation or else to demand more
 information. This will give us a chance to submit our memorial without
 getting ourselves into trouble.&#8221; Sanzang was very pleased.</P>
<P>&#8220;How are you going to get the children out of the town now?&#8221; he
 asked. &#8220;If you really can rescue them you will be doing the greatest of
 good deeds, worthy disciple. But do it quick, because if you lose any
 time you may be too late.&#8221;</P>
<P>Summoning up his might Monkey stood up and gave Pig and Friar Sand
 their parting instructions: &#8220;Sit here with the master while I do my
 stuff. If you notice a magical wind blowing that'll be the boys leaving
 the city.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang and the other two disciples said, &#8220;We invoke the Saviour
 Bhaisajya-guru Buddha. We invoke the Saviour Bhaisajya-guru Buddha.&#8221;</P>
<P>Once outside the doors the Great Sage whistled, rose into mid-air,
 made a spell with his hands and said the magic words, called out &#8220;<I>Om</I>
 pure dharma world,&#8221; and summoned the city god, the local deities, the
 officiating immortals, the Protectors of the Faith of the four quarters
 and the center, the Four Duty Gods, the Six Dings and the Six Jias and
 the Guardians of the Teaching.</P>
<P>They all came to him where he was in midair, bowed and said, &#8220;Great
 Sage, what is the urgent business on which you have summoned us in the
 middle of the night?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My journey has brought me to Bhiksuland,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;where the
 king is a bad one who believes in evil doctrines. He wants to take the
 hearts out of little boys to make the adjuvant to a medicine that he
 hopes will make him live for ever. My master finds this utterly
 horrible and has asked me to rescue the boys and destroy the demon.
 That is why I've asked all you gentlemen here. I want you to use your
 magical powers to lift all the little boys, coops and all, over the
 city wall into a mountain hollow or somewhere deep in a forest. Keep
 them there for a day or two. Give them fruit to eat and don't let them
 go hungry. Keep watch over them in secret and don't frighten them or
 make them cry. When I've eliminated the evil, brought the country back
 to good government and persuaded the king to mend his ways and am about
 to leave, you must bring them back to me.&#8221;</P>
<P>The gods all listened to their orders then brought their clouds down
 to land so that they could use their magical powers. The city was
 filled with a blustering negative wind that brought with it an
 all-pervasive and sinister fog.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>All the stars in the sky were obscured by the negative wind;</P>
<P>The moon was blacked out by the magical fog for many a mile.</P>
<P>At first the wind was gusty,</P>
<P>And then it blew like a hurricane.</P>
<P>When it was gusting</P>
<P>All ran to the gateways to rescue their children;</P>
<P>Then in the hurricane</P>
<P>They wanted to save their own flesh and blood in the coops.</P>
<P>The air turned so chilly that none dared show their heads;</P>
<P>The cold was so piercing that clothes froze like iron.</P>
<P>Vainly did parents look all around;</P>
<P>The families all were stricken with grief.</P>
<P>The sinister wind blew right across the land</P>
<P>As the boys in their baskets were carried off by the gods.</P>
<P>Although that was a night of bereavement and grief</P>
<P>Joy was coming to all the next day.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>There is another poem about it that goes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Compassion has always been strong in the Sakyamuni faith;</P>
<P>The achievement of goodness explains the Great Vehicle.</P>
<P>A multitude of holy ones all accumulate goodness;</P>
<P>For the Three Refuges and Five Precepts harmony is needed.</P>
<P>The land of Bhiksu was not to be ruined by its monarch</P>
<P>When a thousand little boys were to forfeit their lives.</P>
<P>Monkey and his master had brought them to safety,</P>
<P>Which conferred more merit than the Great Wisdom.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>By the third watch of the night the gods had carried all the coops
 off and hidden them in all the safe places. Monkey then landed his
 auspicious light and went straight back to the government hostel, where
 to his secret delight he could hear the other three still chanting, &#8220;We
 invoke the Saviour Bhaisajya-guru Buddha.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; he said, going up to them, &#8220;I'm back. What was the negative
 wind like?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Terrific,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;How did the rescue of the children go?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Every single one of them has been saved,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;They'll
 all be brought back when we set out again.&#8221; The master thanked him over
 and over again before finally going to sleep.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Sanzang awoke at dawn he dressed himself in his best vestments
 and said, &#8220;Wukong, I am going to the early audience to present our
 passport.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you go by yourself, Master,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;I'm afraid that you
 won't be able to manage. Let me go with you. Then I'll be able to find
 out about the evil in this country.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you go you will refuse to pay homage,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;and the
 king may well take it amiss.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I won't be seen,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'll go with you in secret and
 protect you.&#8221; This pleased Sanzang very much. He had told Pig and Friar
 Sand to look after the luggage and horse and was just about to set out
 when the superintendent of the hostel came in to see him. The
 superintendent was struck by the difference between vestments he wore
 this day compared with what he had been wearing the day before.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>His cassock was of brocade, set with exotic gems;</P>
<P>On his head he wore a gold-topped Vairocana mitre.</P>
<P>He held a nine-ringed monastic staff</P>
<P>And hid a divine radiance in his breast.</P>
<P>The passport was fastened tightly to his body,</P>
<P>Wrapped in brocade inside another cloth.</P>
<P>He moved like an arhat come down to earth;</P>
<P>His face was truly that of a living Buddha.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the superintendent had greeted Sanzang courteously he murmured
 into his ear advice against meddling in matters that were none of his
 business. Sanzang nodded and assented. The Great Sage stole to a place
 by the gate, said the words of a spell, shook himself and turned into
 the tiniest of insects that flew with a high-pitched hum to Sanzang's
 mitre.</P>
<P>Sanzang left the government hostel and headed straight for the
 palace.</P>
<P>Arriving at the palace gates Sanzang saw a eunuch officer to whom he
 bowed and said, &#8220;This humble monk has been sent by the Great Tang in
 the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven. Now that I
 have reached your distinguished country I must present my passport to
 be inspected and returned. I beg Your Excellency to report this to His
 Majesty.&#8221; This the eunuch duly did.</P>
<P>The king was very pleased. &#8220;A monk from afar must be a holy man,&#8221; he
 said, ordering that Sanzang be asked in. When the venerable elder had
 paid his respects at the foot of the steps of the throne hall he was
 invited to enter the hall and take a seat. Sanzang thanked the king and
 sat down. The king looked weak and enervated. When he raised his hands
 to make a polite salutation he could not do so properly, and he was
 incapable of continuous speech. His right was so blurred that he had to
 make several attempts to read the document that Sanzang handed to him
 before he could sign, seal and return it to the Tang Priest, who put it
 away again.</P>
<P>The king was just about to ask why they were fetching the scriptures
 when one of his aides reported, &#8220;His Excellency the Elder of the Nation
 is here.&#8221; Leaning on one of his young eunuch attendants the king
 struggled down from his throne to greet the Elder. Sanzang hastily got
 to his feet, stood to one side and looked round to see that the Elder
 of the Nation was an aged Taoist who advanced with a swagger towards
 the steps of the throne.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On his head he wore a goose-yellow silken cap,</P>
<P>Round his body a scented cloak of silk and crane feathers,</P>
<P>And at his waist a triple sash of blue velvet.</P>
<P>On his feet were sandals of hemp and grasscloth;</P>
<P>At the top of his rattan stick coiled a dragon.</P>
<P>The pouch at his chest was embroidered with dragon, phoenix and
 flowers.</P>
<P>His jadelike face radiated well-being;</P>
<P>A gray beard blew about his chin.</P>
<P>Flames shot from golden pupils</P>
<P>In eyes even longer than his eyebrows.</P>
<P>Clouds followed his steps</P>
<P>As he wandered through incense-laden mists.</P>
<P>The officials below the steps received him with obeisances,</P>
<P>Announcing the presence of the Elder of the Nation.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When he reached the throne hall the Elder of the Nation performed no
 obeisance but arrogantly strode straight in. The king leaned forward in
 a bow and said, &#8220;We are most fortunate that you have condescended to
 make your immortal way here, Elder of the Nation.&#8221; He ordered that an
 embroidered stool be set on his left for the Elder to sit on.</P>
<P>Taking a step forward Sanzang bowed and said, &#8220;Greetings, Elder of
 the Nation.&#8221; The Elder sat majestically on his seat, but instead of
 returning Sanzang's courtesy he turned to the king and asked, &#8220;Where's
 this monk from?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He has been sent by the Tang court in the East to fetch the
 scriptures from the Western Heaven,&#8221; the king replied, &#8220;and is here to
 present his passport for inspection.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The road West is dark and dismal,&#8221; said the Elder of the Nation with
 a smile. &#8220;There's nothing good about it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The West has always been a land of bliss,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;How
 could it not be good?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There is an old saying we once heard that monks are disciples of the
 Buddha,&#8221; said the king. &#8220;I wonder whether it is true that by being a
 monk and turning to the Buddha one can live for ever.&#8221; When Sanzang
 heard this he put his hands together and replied:</P>
<P>&#8220;One who becomes a monk gets away from all kinds of causation. By
 understanding nature he learns that all dharmas are empty. Great wisdom
 is casual and drifts in non-living. The true secret is hidden; it
 wanders in extinction. When the three worlds are empty all origins are
 ordered; when the six sense-organs are purified all troubles are
 finished. To be resolute, single-minded and enlightened one must
 understand the heart. When the heart is purified it can shine alone;
 when the heart is sincere all regions are imbued with it. The true
 appearance has neither deficiency nor excess and can be seen in life.
 The images of illusion always decay. Why seek what is beyond one's lot?
 The way to enter meditation is through meritorious deeds and by sitting
 in silence; the root of cultivating one's conduct truly is charity and
 kindness. Great skill appears as clumsiness and knows that all deeds
 are achieved through inaction. The finest plans involve no calculation;
 everything must be left alone. It only needs one heart not to move for
 every action to be perfect. It is truly absurd to try to strengthen the
 male by drawing on the female and nonsensical to try to extend one's
 years by taking elixirs. The only essential is that all the causation
 of every speck of dust must be discarded and that every type of matter
 should be empty. Live plain and pure; let your desires be few. Then
 naturally you will enjoy life without end for ever.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the Elder of the Nation heard this he laughed at it. &#8220;Phooey,&#8221;
 he said, pointing at the Tang Priest, &#8220;phooey! You're talking a load of
 rubbish, monk. Fancy you talking about understanding nature, and you a
 member of the faith that preaches nirvana. You don't have any idea of
 where nature comes from. Sitting still like a dead tree to enter dhyana
 is wasted effort as far as self-cultivation and tempering are
 concerned. In the words of the saying,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sit, sit, sit;</P>
<P>Your backside's split.</P>
<P>The fire's too hot;</P>
<P>Good that's not.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>What you don't realize at all is this:</P>
<P>&#8220;One who cultivates immortality has strong bones; one who attains the
 Way has the most magical spirit. Carrying his bowl and ladle he goes
 into the mountains to visit his friends; he picks every kind of herb to
 succor humanity. He makes a rainhat from immortal flowers, plucks the
 fragrant orchid to make his bed. He sings, claps and dances, then goes
 to sleep. When expounding the Way he teaches the doctrines of the
 Supreme One; he eliminates the evil of the human world with holy water.
 He takes the finest breath of heaven and earth, gathers the essence of
 the sun and moon. By controlling the negative and positive forces he
 creates the elixir; through the mastery of fire and water the foetus is
 formed. On the sixteenth day of the month the negative is eliminated,
 hazily and obscurely. In the twenty-seventh day of winter the positive
 begins to grow, darkly and mysteriously. He gathers the herbs of each
 of the four seasons, refining his elixir to nourish the nine
 transformations. Astride his blue phoenix he ascends to the purple
 palace; riding his white crane he goes to the jasper capital. He visits
 all the splendors of Heaven, showing the efficacy of the wonderful Way.
 Just compare it with the dhyana teachings of your Sakyamuni, your
 elimination of atman and your nirvana that enables you to shuffle off
 your stinking husk. None of this lifts you out of the worldly dust.
 Among the Three Teachings it is supreme; the Way alone has always been
 esteemed.&#8221;</P>
<P>The king was delighted to hear this exposition, and all the court
 officials exclaimed with admiration, &#8220;That's splendid, 'the Way alone
 has always been esteemed.'&#8220; Sanzang was overcome by humiliation at all
 this praise going to his rival. The king then told his department of
 foreign relations to lay on a banquet of vegetarian food for the monks
 from a far country when they left the city to travel West.</P>
<P>Sanzang thanked the king for his kindness and withdrew. As he was
 leaving the throne hall and going out of the palace Monkey flew down
 from the top of his mitre to say into his ear, &#8220;Master, the Elder of
 the Nation is an evil spirit, and the king has been bewitched. Go back
 to the hostel and wait for your meal while I get some information
 here.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang understood this and left through the main gates of the
 palace.</P>
<P>Of him we will say no more. Watch Monkey as he flies straight to a
 jade screen in the throne hall and lands on it. From the ranks of
 officials the military commanders of the capital stepped forward to
 report, &#8220;Your Majesty, last night a cold wind carried away the little
 boys in their goose coops from every house in every ward of the city.
 They have vanished without a trace, coops and all.&#8221;</P>
<P>This report both alarmed and angered the king, who said to the Elder
 of the Nation, &#8220;Heaven must be destroying us. We had the good fortune
 to be given the formula for your elixir after months of serious illness
 that the royal physicians have been unable to cure. We were preparing
 to have the boys cut open at noon today and their hearts taken out to
 be made into the adjuvant for the elixir. Never did we imagine that a
 cold wind would blow them all away. If this is not Heaven destroying us
 what is it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't upset yourself,&#8221; the Elder of the Nation replied with a smile.
 &#8220;By blowing them away Heaven is giving Your Majesty eternal life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you maintain that Heaven is giving me eternal life when they
 have just been blown away?&#8221; the king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;When I was coming to court this morning,&#8221; the Elder of the Nation
 replied, &#8220;I saw a uniquely marvellous adjuvant that will be far
 superior to 1,111 little boys' hearts. They would only lengthen Your
 Majesty's life by a thousand years, but if you take my elixir with this
 other adjuvant you can live for a hundred million years.&#8221;</P>
<P>The king was mystified about what this adjuvant could be, but only
 after repeated questions did the Elder of the Nation reply, &#8220;The monk
 from the East who is being sent to fetch the scriptures has pure organs
 and regular features. His is the body of one who has cultivated his
 conduct for ten lifetimes. He has been a monk since childhood and has
 preserved his masculine purity, which all makes him ten thousand times
 better than those little boys. If you can make a decoction from his
 heart with which to take my elixir I can guarantee you an extremely
 long life.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the deluded king heard this he believed it completely. &#8220;Why
 didn't you tell us before?&#8221; he said to the Elder of the Nation. &#8220;If
 it's as good as you say we should have kept him when he was here just
 now and not let him go.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This will present no problem,&#8221; the Elder of the Nation said. &#8220;You
 have already told the department of foreign relations to give him a
 vegetarian banquet. He can't possibly leave the city before eating the
 meal. Urgent orders must be issued to have the gates firmly closed.
 Send troops to surround the government hostel and bring that monk here.
 First we will try to win his heart by treating him with courtesy. If he
 agrees we will cut it out and give him a royal burial, build him a
 temple and make offerings to him. If he will not agree we'll use rough
 methods. We can tie him up and cut it out. There will be no problem.&#8221;
 The deluded ruler accepted this suggestion and ordered that all the
 gates be closed. He then sent the officers and men of the royal guard
 to surround the hostel.</P>
<P>Having found all this out Monkey flew straight to the hostel, turned
 back into himself and said to the Tang Priest, &#8220;Something terrible's
 happened, Master, something terrible.&#8221; Sanzang had just begun to eat
 the king's vegetarian banquet with Pig and Friar Sand when this sudden
 announcement scattered his three bodily spirits and made smoke come out
 of his seven orifices. He collapsed in the dust, pouring with sweat,
 and unable to see clearly or speak.</P>
<P>Friar Sand was so alarmed he came forward to help him back to his
 feet, calling, &#8220;Wake up, Master, wake up.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What's so terrible?&#8221; Pig asked. &#8220;What's so terrible? You should have
 broken the news gently instead of giving the master such a scare.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When the master left the palace I went back to keep an eye on
 things,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;That Elder of the Nation is an evil spirit. A
 moment later the city garrison came to report about the cold wind
 carrying the little boys away. This upset the king, but the Elder of
 the Nation cheered him up by saying that this was Heaven giving him
 eternal life. He wants to use your heart as an adjuvant for the elixir
 of immortality, Master. The deluded king has accepted this wicked
 suggestion and ordered his best troops to surround this hostel. He's
 also sent an aide to ask you for your heart, Master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a merciful and compassionate chap you are,&#8221; said Pig with a
 laugh. &#8220;You saved the boys and made the wind blow all right, but now
 you've got us in this disastrous mess.&#8221;</P>
<P>Trembling and shaking, Sanzang dragged himself to his feet, seized
 hold of Monkey and said imploringly, &#8220;Good disciple, how are we to get
 out of this?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you want to get out of this,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;there'll have to be a
 switch.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean by a switch?&#8221; Friar Sand asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you want to survive,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;the disciple will have to
 become the master and the master the disciple. Do that and we'll be
 safe.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Save my life,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;and I will gladly become your disciple
 or even your disciple's disciple.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case there must be no hesitation,&#8221; Monkey replied,
 continuing, &#8220;Pig, mix up some mud at once.&#8221; The idiot loosened some
 earth with his rake then, not daring to go outside for water, lifted
 his tunic to make some water himself. With this he mixed up a lump of
 foul-smelling mud that he handed to Monkey. Monkey had no option but to
 beat it out flat and press it against his face so that it looked like a
 monkey's face. Then he told his master to stand up and neither move nor
 say anything while he placed the mask on his face, said the words of a
 spell, blew a magic breath and said, &#8220;Change!&#8221;</P>
<P>The venerable elder now looked just like Monkey. He took off his own
 clothes and put on Monkey's while Monkey dressed in his master's
 clothes, made a spell with his hands, said the magic words, shook
 himself and made himself look just like the Tang Priest. Even Pig and
 Friar Sand could not tell that he really was not.</P>
<P>Just when they had completed the disguises together there came the
 sound of gongs and drums as a dense forest of spears and swords
 appeared. The commanders of the royal guard had surrounded the hostel
 with their three thousand men. A royal aide came into the main hall of
 the hostel to ask, &#8220;Where is the reverend gentleman from the Tang court
 in the East?&#8221;</P>
<P>The superintendent of the hostel anxiously fell to his knees and
 said, pointing, &#8220;In the guest room over there.&#8221;</P>
<P>The aide then went into the room and said, &#8220;Venerable elder from
 Tang, His Majesty has sent for you.&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig and Friar Sand stood on either side of the imitation Monkey to
 guard him while the imitation Tang Priest went out through the door,
 bowed and said, &#8220;Your Excellency, what does His Majesty wish to say to
 me? Why has he sent for me?&#8221; The aide stepped forward to grab hold of
 him and say, &#8220;You and I are going to the palace. His Majesty must have
 some use for you.&#8221; Alas!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Wickedness was stronger than goodness and mercy;</P>
<P>Goodness and mercy only led to catastrophe.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know whether they were to survive this departure listen
 to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

</B>
<P>The story tells how the royal aide dragged the imitation Tang Priest
 out of the government hostel and marched him, heavily surrounded by
 royal guardsmen, straight to the gates of the palace, where he said to
 the eunuch gate officer, &#8220;Please be so good as to report to His Majesty
 that we have brought the Tang Priest.&#8221; The eunuch officer hurried into
 the palace to pass this on to the deluded king, who ordered that they
 be brought in.</P>
<P>All the officials knelt at the foot of the steps to the throne hall,
 leaving the imitation Tang Priest standing alone in the middle of them.</P>
<P>&#8220;King of Bhiksuland,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;what have you summoned me here to
 say to me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We are sick with a chronic illness that has dragged on for many a
 day without any improvement,&#8221; the king replied. &#8220;Now the Elder of the
 Nation has to our good fortune presented us with a prescription that
 has been made up. All that is needed now is an adjuvant. The reason we
 have sent for you, reverend sir, is to ask you for the adjuvant. If we
 recover we will build a temple to you in which offerings will be made
 in all four seasons and incense will be burnt to you in perpetuity by
 our country.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am a man of religion,&#8221; the imitation Tang Priest replied, &#8220;and
 have brought nothing with me. I do not know what adjuvant the Elder of
 the Nation has told Your Majesty you need.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your heart, reverend sir,&#8221; the deluded monarch replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;I will be frank with Your Majesty,&#8221; the imitation Tang Priest said.
 &#8220;I have a number of hearts. I don't know which you want.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Monk,&#8221; pronounced the Elder of the Nation, who was standing beside
 the king. &#8220;I want your black heart.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well then,&#8221; the imitation Tang Priest replied. &#8220;Produce your
 knife at once and open up my chest. If there is a black heart there I
 shall offer it to you obediently.&#8221;</P>
<P>The deluded monarch thanked him delightedly and ordered an official
 in attendance to bring a small knife with a blade shaped like a cow's
 ear that was handed to the imitation Tang Priest. Taking the knife, the
 imitation Tang Priest undid his clothes, thrust out his chest, pressed
 his left hand against his abdomen and cut the skin of his stomach open
 with the knife in his right hand. There was a whoosh, and out rolled a
 whole pile of hearts. The civilian officials all turned pale with
 fright; the military officers were numbed.</P>
<P>When the Elder of the Nation saw this from inside the throne hall he
 said, &#8220;This monk is a suspicious-minded character. He has too many
 hearts.&#8221;</P>
<P>The imitation Tang Priest then held up the hearts one by one, each
 dripping with blood, for all to see. They included a loyal red heart, a
 pure white heart, a yellow heart, an avaricious heart, a fame-hungry
 heart, a jealous heart, a calculating heart, an over-competitive heart,
 an ambitious heart, an overbearing heart, a murderous heart, a vicious
 heart, a frightened heart, a cautious heart, a heretical heart and a
 heart full of indefinable gloom. There was every kind of evil heart
 except a black one. The deluded ruler was horror-struck, unable to
 speak until he said in trembling tones, &#8220;Put them away! Put them away!&#8221;</P>
<P>The imitation Tang Priest had taken as much as he could, so he put
 his magic away and turned back into himself to say to the deluded
 monarch, &#8220;Your Majesty, you're not at all perceptive. We monks all have
 good hearts. It's only this Elder of the Nation of yours who has a
 black heart. His would make a good adjuvant for the medicine. If you
 don't believe me I'll take his out to show you.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the Elder of the Nation heard this he opened his eyes wide to
 take a careful look. He saw that the monk's face had changed to
 something quite different. Heavens! Recognizing him as the Great Sage
 Monkey who had been so famous five hundred years ago he made a getaway
 by cloud. Monkey did a somersault and sprang up into mid-air to shout,
 &#8220;Where do you think you're going? Take this from me!&#8221; The Elder used
 his stick with a dragon on its head to meet the blow from Monkey's
 cudgel. The two of them fought a fine battle up in the sky:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The As-You-Will cudgel</P>
<P>And the dragon stick</P>
<P>Making clouds up in the sky.</P>
<P>The Elder of the Nation was really an evil spirit,</P>
<P>Using his fiendish daughter's seductive charms.</P>
<P>The king had made himself ill through his lust;</P>
<P>The monster wanted to butcher the boys.</P>
<P>There was no escape from the Great Sage's divine powers</P>
<P>To catch demons and to rescue their victims.</P>
<P>The cudgel's blows to the head were really vicious;</P>
<P>Splendid was the way in which the stick met them.</P>
<P>They fought so hard that the sky was full of mist,</P>
<P>Casting city and people into darkness and fear.</P>
<P>The souls of civil and military officials went flying;</P>
<P>The faces of the queens and concubines turned pale.</P>
<P>The deluded king tried desperately to hide,</P>
<P>Trembling and shaking, unable to do anything.</P>
<P>The cudgel was as fierce as a tiger from the mountains;</P>
<P>The staff whirled round like a dragon leaving the sea.</P>
<P>Now they made havoc in Bhiksuland</P>
<P>As good and evil were clearly set apart.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the evil spirit had fought over twenty hard rounds with Monkey
 his dragon staff was no longer a match for the gold-banded cudgel.
 Feinting with his staff, the spirit turned himself into a beam of cold
 light and dropped into the inner quarters of the palace to take the
 demon queen he had presented to the king out through the palace gates
 with him. She too turned into cold light and disappeared.</P>
<P>Bringing his cloud down, the Great Sage landed in the palace and said
 to the officials, &#8220;That's a fine Elder of the Nation you have!&#8221; The
 officials, all bowed to him, thanking the holy monk.</P>
<P>&#8220;No need for that,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Go and see where your deluded king
 is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When our monarch saw the fighting he hid in terror,&#8221; the officials
 replied. &#8220;We do not know which of the palaces he is in.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Find him at once,&#8221; Monkey ordered them. &#8220;Perhaps Queen Beauty has
 carried him off.&#8221; As soon as the officials heard this they rushed with
 Monkey straight to the rooms of Queen Beauty, ignoring the fact that
 these were the inner quarters. They were deserted and there was no sign
 of the king. Queen Beauty was nowhere to be seen either. The queens of
 the main, the Eastern and the Western palaces and the consorts of the
 six compounds all came to kowtow in thanks to the Great Sage.</P>
<P>&#8220;Please get up,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;It's too early for thanks now. Go and
 find your sovereign lord.&#8221;</P>
<P>A little later four or five eunuchs appeared from behind the Hall of
 Caution supporting the deluded king. All the ministers prostrated
 themselves on the ground and called out in union, &#8220;Sovereign lord!
 Sovereign lord! We are grateful that this holy monk came here to
 uncover the impostor. The Elder of the Nation was an evil spirit and
 Queen Beauty has vanished too.&#8221; When the king heard this he invited
 Monkey to come from the inner quarters of the palace to the throne
 hall, where he kowtowed in thanks to Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Venerable sir,&#8221; he said, &#8220;when you came to court this morning you
 were so handsome. Why have you made yourself look different now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I can tell you for a fact, Your Majesty,&#8221; replied Monkey with a
 grin, &#8220;that the one who came this morning was my master Sanzang, the
 younger brother of the Tang Emperor. I'm his disciple Sun Wukong. There
 are two more of us disciples, Zhu Wuneng, or Pig, and Sha Wujing, or
 Friar Sand, who are both now in the government hostel. I turned myself
 into my master's double and came here to defeat the monster because I
 knew that you had been deluded by his evil suggestions and were going
 to take my master's heart to use as an adjuvant for your elixir.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the king heard this he ordered his ministers in attendance to go
 straight to the hostel to fetch Monkey's master and fellow-disciples.
 The news that Brother Monkey had turned back into himself and had
 fought the evil spirit in mid-air gave Sanzang such a fright that his
 souls scattered. It was lucky that Pig and Friar Sand were able to hold
 him up. His face was still plastered with stinking mud and he was
 feeling thoroughly depressed and miserable when he heard someone call,
 &#8220;Master of the Law, we are ministers in attendance sent by the king of
 Bhiksuland to invite you to court to receive His Majesty's thanks.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be afraid, master,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;don't be afraid. This time he's
 not sending for you to take your heart out. I'm sure that elder brother
 has succeeded and they're inviting you there to thank you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Even if they have come to invite me there because he has succeeded I
 could not face anyone with this stinking mask on,&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;We've got no option,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;We'll just have to go to see my
 elder brother. He's bound to have a solution.&#8221; The venerable elder
 really did have no choice but to go to the main hall of the hostel with
 Pig and Friar Sand carrying the luggage and leading the horse. When the
 ministers saw him they were all terrified.</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; they said, &#8220;they both have heads like monsters.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please don't take offence at our ugliness,&#8221; Friar Sand replied.
 &#8220;Both of us have the bodies that were left after an earlier life. If my
 master could see my elder brother he'd become handsome straight away.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the three of them reached the palace they went straight to the
 throne hall without waiting to be summoned. As soon as Monkey saw them
 he turned round and came down from the hall to meet them. Pulling the
 mud mask off his master's face he blew on him with magic breath, called
 &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned the Tang Priest back into himself. Sanzang was now
 in better spirits. The king came down from the throne hall to greet him
 as &#8220;Master of the Law&#8221; and &#8220;ancient Buddha.&#8221; Master and disciples then
 tethered the horse and went into the throne hall to be presented.</P>
<P>&#8220;Does Your Majesty know where the monsters came from?&#8221; Monkey asked.
 &#8220;Let me go and catch them both for you. Then we will have eliminated
 future catastrophe.&#8221;</P>
<P>When all the queens, consorts and concubines of the three palaces and
 six compounds, who were behind the screen of bright green jade, heard
 Monkey saying that he was going to eliminate future catastrophe they
 cast aside all their inhibitions about appearing in front of an
 outsider, and a male one at that, as they came out to bow to him and
 say, &#8220;We beg you, holy monk and venerable Buddha, to destroy them
 completely, root and branch, with your dharma powers. That would be an
 act of the greatest kindness, and we would of course reward you
 richly.&#8221; Quickly responding to their bows Monkey insisted that the king
 tell him where the monsters lived.</P>
<P>&#8220;We asked him when he came here three years ago,&#8221; the king replied
 shamefacedly, &#8220;and he told us that it was only some twenty miles to the
 South of the city, in Pure Splendor Grange on Willow Slope. The Elder
 of the Nation was old and had no son, only the daughter that his second
 wife had given him. She was just fifteen and unmarried. He offered to
 present her to us, and because we fancied the girl we accepted her. She
 was the favorite among all the palace women. We never expected that we
 would fall so ill that all the prescriptions of the Royal College of
 Physicians would be of no avail. Then he told us that he had a formula
 for an elixir for which a decoction of boiled little boys' hearts was
 needed as the adjuvant. In our folly we believed him and chose some
 boys from among the common people. At noon today we were going to
 operate and take out their hearts. We never expected that you would
 come down to us, holy monk, and that at that very moment all the boys
 would disappear in their coops. Then he said that as you were a holy
 monk who had cultivated the truth for ten lifetimes and not yet
 dissipated your primal masculinity your heart would be ten thousand
 times more effective than the little boys' ones. In our temporary
 delusion we did not realize that you would see through the evil
 monster, holy monk. We hope that you will make full use of your great
 dharma to eliminate any future catastrophe. All the wealth of the
 nation will be given to you as your reward.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I will tell you the truth,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Because my master took
 pity on the little boys in the coops he told me to hide them. Don't say
 anything about giving us wealth. When I capture the evil monsters that
 will be a good deed to my credit. Come with me, Pig.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Whatever you say, elder brother,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;The only thing is
 that I've got an empty belly: I'll be rather weak.&#8221; The king then
 ordered the department of foreign affairs to prepare a vegetarian meal
 at once. Before long the food arrived.</P>
<P>Having eaten his fill, Pig braced his spirits and rose by cloud with
 Monkey. The king, queens, consorts and civil and military officials
 were all so astonished that they all kowtowed to the sky, exclaiming,
 &#8220;They really are immortals and Buddhas come down to earth.&#8221; The Great
 Sage led Pig twenty miles due South, stopped their wind and cloud and
 started searching for the demons' home. All he could see was a clear
 stream running between banks on which grew thousands of willows: he had
 no idea where the Pure Splendor Grange might be. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Endless expanses stretched out in his gaze;</P>
<P>The embankment had vanished amid willows and haze.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When he could not find the grange the Great Sage Sun made a spell
 with his hands, said the magic word &#8220;<I>Om</I>&#8221; and summoned the local
 deity, who approached shivering and shaking, fell to his knees and
 called out, &#8220;Great Sage, the local god of Willow Bank kowtows to you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be afraid,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;I'm not going to hit you. Tell me
 this: is there a Pure Splendor Grange on Willow Hill? And where is it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There is a Pure Splendor Cave,&#8221; the local deity replied, &#8220;but there
 has never been a Pure Splendor Grange. I suppose you have come from
 Bhiksuland, Great Sage.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;The king of Bhiksuland was hoodwinked by
 an evil spirit till I turned up, saw through the monster, defeated him
 and drove him away. He turned into a beam of cold light and I don't
 know where he went. When I asked the king of Bhiksuland about it he
 told me that when the demon first presented him with the girl three
 years ago he asked the spirit about his background. The demon said that
 he lived in Pure Splendor Grange on Willow Hill twenty miles South of
 the city. I've found this place with its wooded hill but can't see any
 Pure Splendor Grange. That's why I asked you about it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I beg your forgiveness, Great Sage,&#8221; said the local god, kowtowing.
 &#8220;This is part of the domain of the king of Bhiksuland, and I should
 have kept a closer watch on things. But the evil spirit had such
 terrible magical powers. If I had given away what he was doing he would
 have come and given me a bad time. That is why he has never been
 caught. Now that you are here, Great Sage, you need only go to the foot
 of the nine-forked willow on the Southern bank, walk round it three
 times to the left and three times to the right, hit the tree with both
 hands and shout 'Open up' three times. The Pure Splendor Cave Palace
 will then appear.&#8221;</P>
<P>On learning this the Great Sage sent the local god away again, jumped
 over the stream with Pig and went to look for that willow tree. There
 was indeed a tree with nine forks on a single trunk. &#8220;Stand well back,&#8221;
 Monkey ordered Pig, &#8220;while I make the gates open. When I've found the
 demon and chased him out you're to help.&#8221;</P>
<P>In response to this order Pig took up his stand about three hundred
 yards from the tree while the Great Sage followed the local god's
 advice and went round the tree three times to the left and three times
 to the right then hit it with both hands, shouting, &#8220;Open up! Open up!&#8221;
 An instant later a pair of double doors opened with a noisy whoosh and
 the tree was nowhere to be seen. Inside the doors was bright light of
 many colours but no sign of human life. Confident in his divine might,
 Monkey charged in. He could see that it was a fine place:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Shimmering clouds, from which</P>
<P>Sun and moon stole their brightness.</P>
<P>White clouds billowing from the caves,</P>
<P>Bright green lichens running wild in the courtyard.</P>
<P>Along the path rare flowers competed in beauty,</P>
<P>While plants on the steps vied in fragrant blossom.</P>
<P>Warm was the air</P>
<P>Where it was ever spring.</P>
<P>This was just like a fairyland,</P>
<P>Or Penglai, the paradise of immortals.</P>
<P>Creepers grew all over the benches;</P>
<P>Vines ran wild across the bridge.</P>
<P>Bees flew into the cave carrying flowers;</P>
<P>Butterflies flirted with orchids as they passed the screen of stone.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Hurrying forward for a closer look Monkey saw that on the stone
 screen was carved IMMORTAL PALACE OF PURE SPLENDOR. Unable to restrain
 himself, he jumped over the stone screen to see the old monster
 embracing a beautiful woman and telling her breathlessly what had
 happened in Bhiksuland.</P>
<P>&#8220;That was our chance,&#8221; they said together. &#8220;Three years' efforts
 should have paid off today, but that ape's ruined everything.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey charged up to them, brandishing his cudgel and shouting, &#8220;I'll
 get you, you fools. What do you mean, that was your chance? Take that!&#8221;
 Pushing the woman aside, the old monster swung his dragon-headed stick
 to block the cudgel. It was a fine battle that the two of them fought
 in front of the cave, and quite unlike the previous one:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The upraised cudgel spat out golden light;</P>
<P>Vicious vapors came from the swinging staff.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The monster said,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;How dare you in your ignorance come to my home?&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey replied,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;I intend to subdue evil monsters.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Said the monster,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;My love for the king was no business of yours,</P>
<P>So why did you come to bully and interfere?&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Answered Monkey,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;A compassionate monk should bring misrule to an end:</P>
<P>We could not endure the slaughter of children.&#8221;</P>
<P>As they flung words at each other hostility grew:</P>
<P>Staff parried cudgel as blows struck at the heart.</P>
<P>Precious flowers were destroyed as they fought for their lives;</P>
<P>Green moss became slippery when trampled underfoot.</P>
<P>Pale grew the light in the cave as they struggled:</P>
<P>Crushed were the fragrant blooms on the crags.</P>
<P>At the clash of their weapons the birds dared not fly;</P>
<P>Their shouts sent the beauties all running in terror.</P>
<P>Only the monster and Monkey were left</P>
<P>To stir up a hurricane that roared over the earth.</P>
<P>Slowly their battle took them out of the cave</P>
<P>Where Wuneng gave play to his mindless wrath.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The sound of the commotion they were making inside so excited Pig
 where he was waiting outside that his heart itched. As he could get no
 relief from scratching he raised his rake, smashed the nine-forked
 willow to the ground, then hit it several times so hard that blood
 gushed straight out with a barely audible sound. &#8220;This tree's become a
 spirit,&#8221; he said, &#8220;this tree's a spirit.&#8221; Pig had just raised his rake
 for another blow when he saw Monkey drawing the monster after him.
 Without another word the idiot rushed forward, raised his rake and
 struck. The old monster was already finding Monkey too much to cope
 with, so that Pig's rake made him more desperate than ever. Abandoning
 the fight he shook himself, turned back into a beam of cold light, and
 headed East again. The two of them would not let the demon go but
 headed Eastwards in pursuit.</P>
<P>Above the shouts of battle they heard the calls of the phoenix and
 the crane and looked up to see that it was the Star of Longevity from
 the Southern pole of the heavens. Placing a cover over the cold light
 the old man called out, &#8220;Don't be in such a hurry, Great Sage; stop
 chasing him now, Marshal Tian Peng. This old Taoist offers his
 greetings.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey returned his courtesy and asked, &#8220;Where have you come from,
 Longevity my brother?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've capped the cold light, so you must have caught the monster,
 old fat chops,&#8221; said Pig with a grin.</P>
<P>&#8220;Here he is, here he is,&#8221; said the Star of Longevity, smiling back.
 &#8220;I trust you two gentlemen will spare his life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The old devil's nothing to do with you, brother,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;so
 why have you come to plead for him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He's a messenger of mine,&#8221; replied the star with a smile. &#8220;I
 carelessly let him escape to become a monster here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Since he's yours make him turn back into what he really looks like
 for us to see,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>The Star of Longevity then let the cold light out and shouted, &#8220;Evil
 beast! Turn back into yourself at once if you want to be spared the
 death penalty.&#8221; The demon turned himself round and revealed that he was
 really a white deer. Picking the staff up the Star of Longevity said,
 &#8220;You've even stolen my staff, evil beast.&#8221; The deer lay down in
 submission, unable to speak, but only kowtowing and weeping. Look at
 him:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Brindled like a tablet of jade,</P>
<P>And carrying a pair of seven-branched antlers.</P>
<P>When hungry he used to find the herb garden;</P>
<P>On mornings when thirsty he drank from the misty stream.</P>
<P>In his lengthening years he had taught himself to fly</P>
<P>And through many a day had mastered transformation.</P>
<P>Now that he heard the call of his master</P>
<P>He resumed his own form and lay down in the dust.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Thanking Monkey, the Star of Longevity mounted his deer and was just
 leaving when Monkey grabbed hold of him and said, &#8220;Not so fast,
 brother. There are a couple more jobs still to be done.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What jobs?&#8221; the star asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The girl hasn't been caught yet and I don't know what sort of
 monster she is,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;We've also got to go back to
 Bhiksuland together to see the deluded ruler and show him what they
 really are.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case I'll be patient,&#8221; the star replied. &#8220;You and Marshal
 Tian Peng can go down into the cave to capture the girl and take her
 back to show the king what she really is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Just wait a little while,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;We'll soon be back.&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig then summoned up his spirits and went straight into the Immortal
 Palace of Pure Splendor with Monkey. &#8220;Catch the evil spirit,&#8221; he
 shouted, &#8220;catch the evil spirit.&#8221; Hearing this great roar the beauty,
 who was trembling with fear and unable to escape, rushed behind the
 stone screen, but there was no rear exit.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where do you think you're going?&#8221; Pig shouted. &#8220;I'll get you, you
 man-trap, you whore spirit. Try my rake!&#8221; As the beauty was unarmed she
 could not fight back, so she dodged the blow and turned herself into a
 beam of cold light and fled, only to be stopped by the Great Sage, who
 with two thumping blows of his cudgel knocked her off her feet and laid
 her low in the dust. She turned back into her real form as a
 white-faced vixen. Unable to restrain himself, the idiot lifted his
 rake and struck her a blow on the head. The great beauty of so many
 smiles was now a hairy fox.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't smash her to pulp,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;keep her in that shape to
 show her to the deluded king.&#8221; The idiot grabbed her by the tail, not
 minding the filth, and dragged her out through the cave entrance with
 Monkey. Here he saw the Star of Longevity stroking the deer's head and
 giving him a dressing-down.</P>
<P>&#8220;Evil beast,&#8221; he was saying, &#8220;why did you run away from me and come
 here to turn yourself into a spirit? If I hadn't turned up the Great
 Sage Sun would certainly have killed you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What's that you're saying, brother?&#8221; asked Monkey, springing out of
 the cave.</P>
<P>&#8220;I was telling the deer off,&#8221; the star explained, &#8220;telling the deer
 off.&#8221;</P>
<P>Throwing the body of the dead fox in front of the deer, Pig said,
 &#8220;Your daughter, I suppose.&#8221;</P>
<P>The deer nodded then stretched its head out to sniff the body and
 whimpered as if with grief at its bereavement until the Star of
 Longevity cuffed its head and said, &#8220;Evil beast. You're lucky to have
 got away with your life. What are you sniffing her for?&#8221; He then took
 off the belt he wore round his gown, fastened it round the deer's neck,
 and led it off with the words, &#8220;Great Sage, let's go to Bhiksuland.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wait a moment,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;I feel like cleaning the whole place
 up so that no other evil creatures can ever live here again.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Pig heard this he raised his rake and started to smash the
 willow down wildly. Monkey then said the magic word &#8220;<I>Om</I>&#8221; and
 summoned the local deity once more. &#8220;Gather some dried firewood,&#8221;
 Monkey ordered him, &#8220;and start a roaring fire that will rid this place
 of yours of evil. Then you won't be bullied any more.&#8221;</P>
<P>The local deity then turned around and with a roaring negative wind
 led his spirit soldiers to gather all sorts of withered vegetation that
 had dried out since the previous year: frostbitten grass, autumn grass,
 knotweed grass, mountain grass, dragonbone grass, rushes and reeds.
 Once set alight they would burn like oil or grease.</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no need to go knocking trees over, Pig,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Fill
 the mouth of the cave with all this and set it alight: that'll burn the
 place clean out.&#8221; And indeed once they were lit they turned the evil
 demons' Pure Splendor home into a fiery furnace. Only then did Monkey
 dismiss the local god and go with the Star of Longevity as they dragged
 the fox to the steps of the throne hall where he said to the king,
 &#8220;Here's your Queen Beauty. Do you want to fool around with her now?&#8221;</P>
<P>This caused the king a terrible shock. At the sight of the Great Sage
 Monkey bringing the Star of Longevity with the white deer before the
 throne hall, monarch, ministers, consorts and queens all dropped to the
 ground to kowtow. Monkey went up to the king and held him up. &#8220;Don't
 kowtow to me,&#8221; he said with a smile. &#8220;This deer is the Elder of the
 Nation. It's him you should be kowtowing to.&#8221;</P>
<P>The king was now so overcome with shame that he could only say,
 &#8220;Thank you, holy monk, for saving the boys in my kingdom. It truly was
 an act of heavenly kindness.&#8221; He then ordered the department of foreign
 relations to prepare a vegetarian feast, had the Eastern hall of the
 palace opened up and invited the star, the Ancient of the Southern
 Pole, to take part in a thanksgiving feast with the Tang Priest and his
 three disciples. Sanzang bowed in greeting to the Star of Longevity, as
 did Friar Sand.</P>
<P>&#8220;If the white deer is one of your creatures, Star of Longevity,&#8221; they
 both asked, &#8220;how did he get here to become such a nuisance?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Some time ago the Lord of Eastern Splendor came to my mountain,&#8221; the
 Star of Longevity replied with a smile, &#8220;and I persuaded him to sit
 down for some chess. The wicked creature escaped before our first game
 was over. It was only when I couldn't find him after my visitor had
 gone that I worked out by calculating on my fingers that he must have
 come here. I had just reached here in my search for him when I met the
 Great Sage Sun using his mighty powers. If I had been any later this
 beast would be dead.&#8221; Before he could finish his remarks it was
 announced that the banquet was ready. It was a splendid vegetarian
 feast:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The room was overflowing with color;</P>
<P>Exotic fragrances filled the hall.</P>
<P>Embroidered hangings made the tables magnificent;</P>
<P>Red carpets on the floor shimmered like the glow of dawn.</P>
<P>From duck-shaped censers</P>
<P>Curled the scented smoke of eaglewood;</P>
<P>Before the king's place</P>
<P>Were fragrant vegetables.</P>
<P>See how high the towers of fruit were piled;</P>
<P>Sugar dragons and prowling animals.</P>
<P>Molded mandarin ducks,</P>
<P>Lion confections,</P>
<P>Looking quite lifelike.</P>
<P>Parrot goblets,</P>
<P>Cormorant ladles,</P>
<P>Shaped like the real thing.</P>
<P>Every kind of fruit in abundance,</P>
<P>Each exquisite dish a delicacy.</P>
<P>Giant longans and tender bamboo-shoots,</P>
<P>Fresh lichees and peaches.</P>
<P>Sweet smelled the jujubes and persimmon cakes;</P>
<P>More fragrant than wine were the pine-nuts and grapes.</P>
<P>Many a sweet dish made with honey,</P>
<P>Steamed pastries of various kinds,</P>
<P>Sugar-drenched doughnuts</P>
<P>Piled up like bouquets of flowers,</P>
<P>Mountains of rolls on golden dishes,</P>
<P>Fragrant rice heaped high in silver bowls,</P>
<P>Long bean noodles in hot chili soup,</P>
<P>Tasty dishes came in succession.</P>
<P>There was no end of button mushrooms,</P>
<P>&#8220;Tree-ear&#8221; fungus,</P>
<P>Tender bamboo shoots,</P>
<P>Sealwort,</P>
<P>Vegetables of many flavors,</P>
<P>A hundred kinds of rare delights.</P>
<P>They came and went in endless succession,</P>
<P>All the abundant dishes offered at the feast.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The seating was arranged on the spot, the seat of honour going to the
 Star of Longevity and the next best place to the Tang Priest. The king
 sat between them while Brother Monkey, Pig and Friar Sand sat at the
 side places. There were also three senior ministers present to keep
 them company, and the musicians and singers of the court theatre were
 ordered to perform. Holding his purple cloud goblet, the king, toasted
 them one by one.</P>
<P>The only person who would not drink was the Tang Priest. &#8220;Brother,&#8221;
 said Pig to Monkey, &#8220;I'll leave the fruit for you, but you must let me
 have a good feed of the soup, bread and rice.&#8221; With no further thought
 the idiot ate everything all at once. He devoured everything that was
 brought in and left nothing behind.</P>
<P>When the banquet was coming to an end the Star of Longevity took his
 leave of them. The king went up to him, knelt, kowtowed and begged the
 star to tell him the secret of eliminating disease and prolonging life.
 &#8220;I didn't bring any elixir as I was here to search for my deer,&#8221; the
 Star of Longevity replied. &#8220;I would like to teach you the techniques of
 self-cultivation, but you are so weak in body and ruined in spirit that
 you would not be able to convert the elixir. All I have in my sleeve is
 these three jujubes that I was intending to offer to the Lord of
 Eastern Splendor to take with tea. As they haven't been eaten I can
 offer them to you now.&#8221;</P>
<P>The king swallowed them, and he gradually began to feel lighter in
 body as the illness was cured. This was the origin of his later success
 in achieving immortality. As soon as Pig saw this he called,
 &#8220;Longevity, old pal, if you've got any fire jujubes give me some.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I didn't bring any,&#8221; the star replied, &#8220;but I'll give you several
 pounds of them next time.&#8221; The Star of Longevity then went out of the
 Eastern pavilion, expressed his thanks, called to the white deer,
 sprang on his back and departed by cloud. We will not relate how the
 king, queens and consorts in the palace and the common people in the
 city all burnt incense and kowtowed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciples,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;let us pack up and take our leave of His
 Majesty.&#8221; The king pleaded with them to stay and instruct him. &#8220;Your
 Majesty,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;from now on you should be less greedy for your
 sexual pleasures and accumulate more hidden merit. In whatever you do
 you should use your strong points to make up for your weaknesses. This
 is the way to get rid of your illness and prolong your life. That's
 what we'll tell you.&#8221; Two dishes full of small pieces of gold and
 silver were then offered to the pilgrims to help with the expenses of
 their journey, but the Tang Priest refused to accept a single penny.
 The king then had no choice but to order the royal carriage and invite
 the Tang Priest to sit in the dragon and phoenix coach while he, his
 queens and his consorts pushed the wheels. Thus they escorted him out
 of the palace. In the streets and markets the common people also came
 with bowls of pure water and incense-burners to see them on their way
 from the city.</P>
<P>Suddenly there was the sound of a wind in the sky and 1,111 goose
 coops landed on both sides of the road. The little boys in them were
 crying. Unseen in the sky were the deities who had been looking after
 them: the city and the local gods, the deities of the altars, the True
 Officials, the Guardians of the Four Quarters and the Centre, the Four
 Duty Gods, the Six Dings and Six Jias, the Protectors of the Faith and
 the rest of them, who all responded with a loud shout of, &#8220;Great Sage,
 on your earlier instructions we carried the boys away in the goose
 coops. Now that we have learned of your success in your task and your
 departure we have brought every one of them back again.&#8221; The king, his
 queens and consorts and all his ministers and subjects fell to their
 knees to kowtow.</P>
<P>&#8220;Thank you for your efforts, gentlemen,&#8221; Monkey shouted to the sky.
 &#8220;Please all return to your shrines now. I'll get the people to make
 thanksgiving offerings to you.&#8221; With a soughing noise the magic wind
 then arose again and departed.</P>
<P>Monkey then told the people of the city to come and collect their
 children. The news was spread at once, and the people all came to claim
 the boys in the baskets. They were very happy indeed. Holding the boys
 in their arms they called them dear ones and darlings. Dancing and
 laughing they told their children to take hold of the lords from Tang
 and bring them home so that they could express their thanks for the
 boys' rescue. Nobody, young or old, male or female, was frightened by
 the disciples' ugly faces as they all carried Pig, Friar Sand, Monkey
 and the Tang Priest back to the city in the middle of a crowd that also
 brought their luggage and led the horse. The king could not stop them.
 Family after family laid on a banquet or a feast, and those who could
 not offer hospitality made monkish hats, shoes, tunics, cotton socks,
 and other inner and outer garments in different sizes that they
 presented to the pilgrims. Only when they had been entertained in this
 way for nearly a month were the travelers able to leave the city.
 Portraits of them were painted and tablets bearing their names set up;
 to these the people could kowtow, burn incense and make offerings.
 Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Great was the gratitude for their enormous kindness,</P>
<P>In saving the lives of infants by the thousand.</P>

</I>
<P>The Young Girl Seeks a Mate to Build Up the Male</P>
<P>Protecting His Master the Mind-Ape Sees Through a Demon</P>
</B>
<P>The story tells how the king, ministers and common people of
 Bhiksuland escorted the Tang Priest and his three disciples out of the
 city. Seven miles later they were still unwilling to part from the
 pilgrims, but Sanzang insisted on getting out of the coach, mounting
 the horse and taking his leave of them. The people who had been seeing
 him off did not return to the city until the travelers had vanished
 from view.</P>
<P>When the four had been travelling for a long time the winter and the
 spring too were over. There was no end of wild flowers and mountain
 trees to be seen; fragrant blossoms filled the view. To Sanzang's alarm
 another towering mountain appeared in front of them.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciples,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;is there a way across the high mountain
 before us? We must be careful.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; laughed Brother Monkey, &#8220;that's not what a seasoned
 traveler should be saying. You sound much more like some pampered
 prince trying to look at the whole sky from the bottom of a well. As
 the old saying goes, a mountain can't stop the road: it can find its
 own way across. So why ask whether there's a way?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Even if this mountain cannot block the road,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;I am
 afraid that there may be monsters on the mountain precipices and evil
 spirits that will emerge from its deep recesses.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;don't worry. We're not far from Paradise
 here. I guarantee it'll all be nice and peaceful&#8212;there won't be any
 trouble.&#8221; As they were talking master and disciples reached the foot of
 the mountain without even noticing. Taking out his gold-banded cudgel
 Monkey climbed the rock-face.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; he called, &#8220;there's a path that goes round the mountain.
 The going's very easy. Hurry up!&#8221; The Tang Priest now put his worries
 aside and whipped the horse forward. &#8220;Carry the luggage for a while,
 brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand to Pig, who did so while Friar Sand held the
 horse's reins and the master sat in the carved saddle. They hurried
 along the main path up the steep slope after Monkey. This was what the
 mountain looked like:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The peak was wrapped in clouds;</P>
<P>Torrents rushed down ravines.</P>
<P>The paths were heavy with the scent of flowers,</P>
<P>And dense grew the countless trees.</P>
<P>Blue were the gages, white the plums,</P>
<P>Green the willows and red the peaches.</P>
<P>Spring was all but over where the cuckoo sang;</P>
<P>When fledgling swallows chirped the festival was finished.</P>
<P>Craggy boulders,</P>
<P>Blue-green pines shaped like parasols.</P>
<P>The track leading across the ridge</P>
<P>Climbed high over a tracery of rocks;</P>
<P>The beetling precipice</P>
<P>Was overgrown with creepers, grass and trees.</P>
<P>Peaks like a row of halberds vied in elegance;</P>
<P>Far from the ocean wave streams competed in gullies.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As the master was taking an unhurried look at the mountain scenery he
 was moved to homesickness by the sound of a bird singing. &#8220;Disciples,&#8221;
 he said,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;After receiving His Majesty's command</P>
<P>I was given my passport in front of the brocade screen.</P>
<P>Watching lanterns on the fifteenth night I left the Eastern land,</P>
<P>And then was parted from the emperor of Tang.</P>
<P>Just when the dragon and tiger winds both met</P>
<P>I and my disciples had to struggle with the horse.</P>
<P>Twelve may be the peaks of Mount Wu;</P>
<P>But when shall I face and see you again?&#8221;'</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you're always suffering from homesickness.
 You're not like a monk at all. Stop worrying and keep going: don't
 upset yourself so. As the old saying goes, you've got to work hard if
 you want to be rich and successful.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What you say is quite right, disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;but I do not
 know where the road to the West runs.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;it's all because our Tathagata Buddha can't
 bring himself to give those scriptures away. He must have removed the
 path because he knows we're coming to fetch them. Why else can't we get
 to the end of the journey?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't talk such nonsense,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;Just keep going with
 big brother. As long as we stick with him we're bound to get there in
 the end.&#8221;</P>
<P>As they were talking master and disciples came in sight of a great
 expanse of dark pine forest. In his fear the Tang Priest called out,
 &#8220;Wukong, no sooner have we taken that precipitous track over the
 mountain than we come to this deep, dark pine forest. Why? We must be
 careful.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's nothing to be scared of,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;Never trust what appears to be absolutely
 upright, and be on your guard against evil masquerading as goodness. I
 have been through quite a few pine woods with you, but never one as
 vast and deep as this. Just look at the trees:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Dense-packed to East and West,</P>
<P>In lines to North and South.</P>
<P>Dense-packed to East and West they reach the end of the clouds;</P>
<P>In lines to North and South they touch the azure firmament.</P>
<P>Thorns and brambles grow close-tangled all about;</P>
<P>Knotweed wraps itself around the branches.</P>
<P>Liana coils round kudzu vine,</P>
<P>Kudzu coils around liana.</P>
<P>Where liana coils around kudzu</P>
<P>Travelers cannot move between East and West;</P>
<P>Where kudzu coils round liana</P>
<P>Merchants may not ply between North and South.</P>
<P>In this forest</P>
<P>You could spend half a year,</P>
<P>Not knowing whether sun or moon was out,</P>
<P>Or travel for miles</P>
<P>And never see the stars.</P>
<P>Where the outlook is to the North the view is unbounded;</P>
<P>On Southern slopes the bushes are in flower.</P>
<P>There are thousand-year-old locust trees,</P>
<P>Ten-thousand-year-old junipers,</P>
<P>Pines that endure the winter cold,</P>
<P>Mountain peaches that bear fruit,</P>
<P>Wild peonies,</P>
<P>And hibiscus,</P>
<P>All growing in a close-packed profusion,</P>
<P>So wild that not even a god could paint it.</P>
<P>Bird-song could be heard:</P>
<P>Parrots shrieking,</P>
<P>Cuckoos calling,</P>
<P>Magpies in the branches,</P>
<P>Crows feeding their mothers,</P>
<P>Orioles with their aerial dance,</P>
<P>As the mynas adjust their voices.</P>
<P>Quails singing,</P>
<P>Swallows chirping,</P>
<P>Mynas imitating people,</P>
<P>And thrushes that could recite sutras.</P>
<P>Then there were:</P>
<P>Great beasts swishing their tails,</P>
<P>Tigers gnashing their teeth.</P>
<P>Aged foxes and raccoon-dogs disguised as ladies,</P>
<P>Ancient gray wolves at whose baying the forest shook.</P>
<P>Had the Pagoda-carrying Heavenly King come here</P>
<P>His power to suppress demons would have been of no avail.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Great Sage Sun was unafraid. Clearing the way ahead with his
 cudgel, he led the Tang Priest into the depths of the forest.</P>
<P>They had been travelling in this carefree style for many hours
 without seeing any sign of a way out of the forest when the Tang Priest
 called out, &#8220;Disciples, we have been through no end of steep and
 dangerous mountain woods on our journey West. Thank goodness we have
 found this purity and elegance and a smooth path. The rare and unusual
 flowers here are truly delightful. I intend to sit here for a moment to
 let the horse have a rest. I am, besides, famished. Go and beg me some
 meat-free food from somewhere.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;please dismount while I go begging.&#8221; This the
 venerable elder did. While Pig tied the horse to a tree Friar Sand put
 the luggage down, brought out the begging-bowl and handed it to Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Sit still here, Master,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;and don't even say the word
 'fear'. I'll be back in a moment.&#8221; While Sanzang sat upright in the
 shade of the pines Pig and Friar Sand amused themselves looking for
 flowers and fruit.</P>
<P>Let us tell of the Great Sage who somersaulted into mid air, brought
 his cloud to a hall and looked back. All he could see coming from the
 pine forest were auspicious clouds and auras that coiled and spread all
 around. &#8220;Good, good,&#8221; he found himself saying. Do you know why? He was
 expressing his admiration for the Tang Priest, the reincarnation of the
 Venerable Golden Cicada and a holy man who had cultivated his conduct
 for ten successive lifetimes, which explained there was such an aura of
 good omen above his head.</P>
<P>&#8220;Five hundred years ago, when I made havoc in heaven,&#8221; Monkey
 thought, &#8220;I wandered to the very corners of the oceans and ran wild at
 the end of the sky. I led a host of spirits and called myself the Great
 Sage Equaling Heaven. We subdued dragons and tigers, and I took us off
 the registers of death. I used to wear a triple golden crown and a coat
 of golden mail, and with my gold-banded cudgel in my hands and my
 cloud-treading shoes on my feet I had 47,000 demons under me. They all
 used to call me Lord Great Sage. I really was someone in those days.
 But ever since being rescued from Heaven's punishment I've been a
 small-time nobody as his disciple. I reckon that as the master has such
 an aura of auspicious clouds over his head things are sure to turn out
 well for us on our way back to the East and I'm bound to win the true
 achievement.&#8221;</P>
<P>As Brother Monkey was congratulating himself along these lines he saw
 a column of black vapor rising from the South of the forest. &#8220;That
 black vapor means evil for sure,&#8221; he thought with alarm. &#8220;No black
 vapors could come from our Pig or Friar Sand.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>While the Great Sage was still trying to make out exactly what the
 vapors were coming from, Sanzang was sitting in the forest clarifying
 his mind and contemplating the Buddha-nature as he recited the<I>
 Mahaprajnaparamita Heart Sutra</I> when suddenly he heard a
 high-pitched cry of &#8220;Help!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is all very well,&#8221; said Sanzang with astonishment, &#8220;but who
 could that be calling so deep in the forest?&#8221; It must be someone
 terrified by a wolf, a tiger, a leopard or some other wild beast. I
 shall go to take a look.&#8221; The venerable elder rose to his feet and
 walked through the thousand-year-old cypresses and even more ancient
 pines, holding on to vines and creepers, as he went close enough to see
 a woman tied to a big tree. The top half of her body was bound to the
 trunk with creepers and her lower half buried in the ground. Sanzang
 stopped to ask, &#8220;Why are you tied up here, lady Bodhisattva?&#8221;</P>
<P>It was quite obvious that the wretched creature was an evil monster,
 but with his mortal eyes in a worldling's body Sanzang was unable to
 perceive this. The monster's response to the question was to weep
 copiously. Just look at the tears rolling down her peachy cheeks. She
 was so lovely that fish would have sunk and wild geese fallen out of
 the sky at the sight of her; the beauty of her sorrowing and sparkling
 eyes would have made the moon hide away and put the flowers to shame.
 Sanzang did not dare go any closer to her as he opened his mouth to
 ask, &#8220;What crime have you committed, lady Bodhisattva? Tell me so that
 I can rescue you.&#8221;</P>
<P>The evil spirit then quickly put together a pack of lies as she
 replied, &#8220;Master, my home is in the country of Pinpo, which is some
 seventy miles from here. Both my parents are at home, and they are very
 great lovers of goodness. All their lives they have been on good terms
 with their relations and devoted to their friends. At the Clear and
 Bright Festival they invited all their relations and members of their
 own family to pay their respects at and sweep the ancestral graves. A
 whole procession of carrying-chairs and horses all went to the graves
 in the wilds outside the city. Here we set out our offerings and had
 just burnt the paper models of horses when a band of brigands sprang
 upon us with the sound of gongs and drums. They charged us shouting
 'kill!' My parents and relations all got hold of horses and
 carrying-chairs and fled for their lives. Because I am so young I was
 too frightened to run: I just collapsed and was carried back to the
 mountains by the brigands. The top chieftain wanted me for his lady,
 the number two chieftain wanted me for his woman, and the third and
 fourth ones both fancied me for my looks. There were seventy or eighty
 of them all quarrelling over me and none of them would give way. So
 they tied me up here in the forest and broke up the band. I've been
 here for five days and five nights now and I'm only just alive now.
 I'll soon be dead. Goodness only knows which ancestor however many
 generations back accumulated the virtue that brought you here to me
 today, reverend sir. I beg you in your great mercy to save my life. I
 won't forget your goodness to me even when I lie dead under the nine
 springs of the underworld.&#8221; When she had finished speaking her tears
 flowed like rain.</P>
<P>As Sanzang really did have a merciful heart he could not help weeping
 and sobbing himself. &#8220;Disciples,&#8221; he shouted. Pig and Friar Sand were
 still looking for flowers and fruit in the forest when suddenly they
 heard their master's anguished cry.</P>
<P>&#8220;Friar Sand,&#8221; said the idiot, &#8220;the master's found a relation here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What nonsense, brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand with a smile. &#8220;In all the
 time we've been going we haven't met a single good person, so where
 could any relation of his have come from?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If it's not a relation why's the master crying for them?&#8221; Pig asked,
 adding, &#8220;You and I had better go to take a look.&#8221; Friar Sand did indeed
 go back to where they had been before. Leading the horse and carrying
 the luggage they went up to the master and asked, &#8220;What's up, Master?&#8221;</P>
<P>The Tang Priest pointed at the tree as he replied, &#8220;Pig, untie this
 lady Bodhisattva and save her life.&#8221; Without caring whether this was
 the right or the wrong thing to do, the idiot set to.</P>
<P>The Great Sage meanwhile saw from up in the air the dense black
 vapors completely obscuring the auspicious glow. &#8220;This is bad,&#8221; he
 said, &#8220;this is bad. If the black vapors are covering the auspicious
 glow that means something evil is threatening my master. Never mind
 about begging for food&#8212;I'm going back to see the master.&#8221; He turned
 his cloud back and landed in the forest, where he saw Pig recklessly
 untying the ropes. Going up to him Monkey grabbed an ear and threw him
 to the ground. &#8220;The master told me to rescue her,&#8221; the idiot protested,
 looking up to see Monkey as he scrambled back to his feet, &#8220;so why did
 you push me over like that? You're just throwing your weight about.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; replied Monkey with a smile, &#8220;don't untie her. She's an
 evil spirit who's been putting on an act to fool us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wretched ape,&#8221; shouted Sanzang, &#8220;talking nonsense again. How can you
 possibly take a girl like this for an evil spirit?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's something you don't know, Master.&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;In the
 old days I tried all these tricks myself when I wanted some human
 flesh. You couldn't possibly tell what she is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Pig, pouting sulkily, &#8220;don't let that Protector of the
 Horses take you in. She's a local girl. We've never had dealings with
 her before on our long journey from the East and she's no relation or
 in-law of ours, so how can you say she's an evil spirit? He's trying to
 get rid of us by making us go ahead so he can turn a somersault and get
 back here by magic. Then he's going to have a bit of fun with her and
 ruin our reputation.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You cretin,&#8221; shouted Brother Monkey, &#8220;stop talking such rubbish.
 I've never done any such outrageous thing on all our journey to the
 West. I reckon it must have been some reckless womanizer like yourself
 who forgot his principles when he saw a good chance. I expect you
 tricked some family into taking you as their son-in-law and tied her up
 here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's enough of that,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;that's enough. Now then,
 Bajie. Your elder brother usually sees things very clearly. Ignore what
 he is saying. Let us be on our way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Splendid,&#8221; said Monkey with great delight, &#8220;you have a good destiny,
 Master. Please mount. Once we're out of the pine forest there will be a
 house where we can beg for some food for you.&#8221; The four of them then
 pressed on together, leaving the monster behind.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story tells how the monster gnashed her teeth with fury as she
 was left tied there to the tree. &#8220;I've heard tell of Sun Wukong's
 tremendous magic powers for years,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and now that I've seen
 him today I know that his reputation's well-founded. As that Tang
 Priest has been cultivating his conduct ever since he was a boy he has
 never lost a drop of his primal masculinity. I was longing to mate with
 him so that I could become a golden immortal of the Supreme Ultimate. I
 never expected that monkey to see through my magic and save him. If I'd
 been untied and released I could have carried him off whenever I chose
 and he'd have been mine. Now that Sun Wukong has made those damaging
 remarks and taken the Tang Priest away my efforts have all been for
 nothing. Let's see what happens when I give him another couple of
 shouts.&#8221;</P>
<P>Not shifting her ropes, the evil spirit made the most of the wind
 being in the right direction to carry some high-pitched words of
 morality into the Tang Priest's ear. Do you know what she was shouting?
 &#8220;Master,&#8221; she called, &#8220;if you forget your conscience and refuse to save
 a living being's life what's the use of your fetching the scriptures
 from the Buddha?&#8221;</P>
<P>When the Tang Priest heard this call he reined the horse in and said,
 &#8220;Wukong, go and rescue that girl.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've started on your way, Master,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;What made you
 think of her again?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;She is shouting again there,&#8221; the Tang Priest said.</P>
<P>&#8220;Did you hear, Pig?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;My big lugs cover my ear-holes,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;and I didn't hear
 anything.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Did you hear, Friar Sand?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I was walking ahead, carrying the pole with the luggage,&#8221; Friar Sand
 replied. &#8220;I wasn't paying attention and I didn't hear anything either.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Neither did I,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;What did she say, Master? You were the
 only one who heard.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What she called was quite right,&#8221; the Tang Priest called. &#8220;She asked
 what was the use of fetching scriptures when I went to visit the Buddha
 if I forgot my conscience and refused to save a living being's life. To
 save a human life is better than building a seven-storied pagoda.
 Rescuing her straight away would be even better than worshipping the
 Buddha and fetching the scriptures.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you're wanting to be charitable, Master,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;you're
 incurable. Just think of all the demons you've met in all the mountains
 you've crossed on your journey West since leaving the East. They've
 often taken you into their caves and I've had to rescue you. I've
 killed tens of thousands of them with this iron cudgel of mine. So why
 can't you bring yourself to let a single devil die today? Why do you
 have to rescue her?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; the Tang Priest replied, &#8220;there's an old saying, 'Do not
 fail to do a good deed because it is small; do not commit a bad deed
 because it is small.' You're still to go and save her.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If that's the way you're going to be, Master, I can't accept that
 responsibility,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;You insist on rescuing her and I dare
 not try too hard to dissuade you. When I did make a little attempt to
 do so you lost your temper again. You can go and rescue her if you want
 to.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Watch your tongue, ape,&#8221; Sanzang retorted. &#8220;Sit here while Bajie and
 I go to rescue her.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Tang Priest went back into the forest and told Pig to undo the
 ropes around the top half of her body and dig the lower half out with
 his rake. The demon stamped her feet, fastened her skirt and happily
 followed the Tang Priest out of the pine forest. When she met Monkey
 all he did was to wear a mocking smile.</P>
<P>&#8220;Impudent ape,&#8221; said the Tang Priest abusively, &#8220;what are you smiling
 at?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm laughing at you,&#8221; Monkey replied:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;You meet up with good friends when your luck is going well;</P>
<P>And when it's going badly you find yourself a belle.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Impudent macaque!&#8221; said Sanzang, being abusive again. &#8220;What
 nonsense! I have been a monk ever since I came out of my mother's womb.
 I am now making this journey West at His Majesty's command with the
 devout intention of worshipping the Buddha and fetching the scriptures.
 I am not the sort of person to care about wealth and office, so what do
 you mean by my luck going badly?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; replied Monkey with a grin, &#8220;you may have been a monk since
 you were a child, and you may be good at reading sutras and invoking
 the Buddha, but you have never studied the text of royal laws. This
 girl is young and beautiful. If monks like us travel with her we may
 well meet with evil people who arrest us and turn us in to the
 authorities. They won't care about worshipping Buddhas or fetching
 scriptures. They'll treat it as a case of illicit sex, and even if that
 isn't proved we'll still be convicted of abduction. You will lose your
 ordination license, Master, and be beaten half to death. Pig will be
 sent into exile and Friar Sand sentenced to penal servitude. Even I
 won't get off scot-free. No matter how I try to talk my way out of it
 I'll still be found guilty of wrongdoing.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't talk such rubbish,&#8221; Sanzang shouted. &#8220;After all, I did save
 her life. There will be no trouble. We are taking her with us. I will
 be responsible for whatever happens.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You may say you'll be responsible, Master,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;but
 what you don't realize is that so far from rescuing her you're
 destroying her.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I saved her life by rescuing her from the forest,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;so
 how can I be destroying her?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If she had stayed tied up in the forest without any food for three
 to five days, ten days or even half a month and starved to death,&#8221; said
 Monkey, &#8220;she would at least have gone to the Underworld with her body
 in one piece. But now you've taken her away from there. You're on a
 fast horse and travelling like the wind. The rest of us have to follow
 you. How will she be able to keep up on her tiny feet? She can barely
 walk. If she gets left behind and a wolf, a tiger or a leopard eats her
 up you'll have killed her.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; Sanzang said. &#8220;Thank you for thinking of it. What
 are we to do about it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Lift her up and let her ride on the horse with you,&#8221; replied Monkey
 with a grin.</P>
<P>&#8220;I could not possibly ride on the same horse as her,&#8221; moaned Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;Then how is she to travel?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;Bajie can carry her on
 his back,&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;You're in luck, idiot,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no such thing as a light load on a long journey,&#8221; Pig
 replied. &#8220;Having to carry her isn't luck.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;With your long snout you'll be able to turn it round and chat her up
 on the quiet while you're carrying her,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;which will be
 very convenient for you.&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig's reaction to hearing this was to beat his chest and jump about
 in fury. &#8220;That's terrible,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that's terrible, I'd sooner put
 up with the pain of a flogging from the master. If I carry her I won't
 possibly come out of it clean. You've always been a slanderer. I'm not
 carrying her.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well then,&#8221; Sanzang said, &#8220;very well then. I can walk a little
 further. I shall come down and walk slowly with you. Bajie can lead the
 horse with nobody riding it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've got yourself a good bargain there, idiot,&#8221; said Monkey,
 roaring with laughter. &#8220;The master's done you a favour by letting you
 lead the horse.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You are talking nonsense again, ape,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;As the ancients
 said, 'When a horse is to travel three hundred miles it cannot get
 there by itself.' If I walk slowly are you going to leave me behind?
 When I go slowly you will have to go slowly too. We shall all take the
 lady Bodhisattva down the mountain together. We can leave her in some
 convent, temple, monastery or house that we come to. Then we will still
 have rescued her.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right, Master,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Let's press on quickly.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang took the lead while Friar Sand carried the luggage, Pig led
 the riderless horse and the girl, and Monkey carried his iron cudgel as
 they carried on together. Within seven to ten miles the evening was
 drawing in and a tall building came into sight.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;that must be a temple of some sort. We
 shall ask to spend the night here and be on our way first thing
 tomorrow.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What you say is right, Master,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Let's all get a move
 on.&#8221;</P>
<P>They were soon at the gates, where Sanzang told them, &#8220;Keep well out
 of the way while I go in first to ask if we can stay for the night. If
 it looks suitable I shall send someone to call to you.&#8221; So they all
 stood in the shadows of the poplars while Monkey kept an eye on the
 girl, his iron cudgel in his hand.</P>
<P>The venerable elder walked forward to see that the gates were hanging
 crooked and falling to pieces. What he saw when he pushed the gates
 open chilled him to the heart:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The cloisters were deserted,</P>
<P>The ancient shrine left desolate.</P>
<P>The courtyard was overgrown with moss;</P>
<P>Sagebrush and brambles choked the paths.</P>
<P>The only lanterns came from the fireflies</P>
<P>While the croaking of frogs had replaced the water-clock.</P>
<P>The venerable elder started crying. Indeed:</P>
<P>The desolate halls were falling down,</P>
<P>The lonely cloisters collapsing.</P>
<P>Broken bricks and tiles lay in a dozen heaps,</P>
<P>And all the pillars and beams were askew.</P>
<P>Grass was growing all around;</P>
<P>The kitchens were crumbling and buried in dust.</P>
<P>In derelict towers the drums had lost their skins;</P>
<P>Broken was the glass lamp.</P>
<P>The color had gone from the Buddha's golden statue;</P>
<P>The figures of arhats lay strewn upon the floor.</P>
<P>Guanyin had turned to mud in the soaking rain,</P>
<P>Her pure vase with a willow spray fallen to the ground.</P>
<P>No monk was to be seen there by day,</P>
<P>And only foxes slept there at night.</P>
<P>As the wind roared with the sound of thunder</P>
<P>This was a place for tiger and leopard to shelter.</P>
<P>The walls around had collapsed</P>
<P>And no gates could be closed to guard it.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>There is a poem about this that goes</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>For many a year had the temple been unrepaired;</P>
<P>In its derelict state it had gone from bad to worse.</P>
<P>The gales had destroyed the faces of the temple guardians,</P>
<P>And rainstorms had washed the heads off the Buddha statues.</P>
<P>The vajrapani had collapsed and been soaked through.</P>
<P>The local god had lost his shrine and stayed outside at night.</P>
<P>Two other things were even more depressing:</P>
<P>Bell and drums lay on the ground instead of hanging in their towers.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Summoning up his courage, Sanzang went in through the inner gates
 where he saw that the bell-tower and drum-tower had both collapsed,
 leaving only a single bronze bell planted in the ground, its bottom
 half the color of indigo. With the passage of the years the top half of
 the bell had been bleached in the rain while the earth's vapors had
 greened the lower part.</P>
<P>&#8220;Bell,&#8221; Sanzang called aloud as he touched it,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Once you roared from high in the tower,</P>
<P>Calling afar from the painted beam where you hung.</P>
<P>At cockcrow you used to ring in the dawn,</P>
<P>And at evening you announced the dusk.</P>
<P>Where now are the lay brothers who begged for the copper,</P>
<P>Or the craftsman who cast it to form you?</P>
<P>Both, I imagine, are now in the Underworld;</P>
<P>They have gone without trace and you are left silent.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The venerable elder's loud sighs had by now disturbed someone in the
 monastery. A lay brother who was offering incense heard the voice,
 climbed to his feet, picked up a broken brick and threw it at the bell.
 The bell's clang gave the venerable elder such a fright that he fell
 over then scrambled up again to flee, only to trip over the root of a
 tree and go flying again.</P>
<P>As he lay on the ground Sanzang raised his head and said, &#8220;Bell,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I was just lamenting your fate</P>
<P>When suddenly you clanged.</P>
<P>On this deserted route to the West</P>
<P>Over the years you have turned into a spirit.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The lay brother came over to Sanzang and steadied him as he said,
 &#8220;Please get up, reverend sir. The bell hasn't become a spirit. It was I
 who struck it just now.&#8221; Looking up and seeing how dark and ugly the
 other was Sanzang said, &#8220;I suppose you are a goblin or some other evil
 creature. I am no ordinary man. I come from Great Tang and I have
 disciples who can subdue dragons and tigers. If you run into them your
 life will be lost.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be afraid, my lord,&#8221; replied the lay brother, falling to his
 knees. I'm no evil being. I'm a lay brother who looks after the incense
 here. When I heard those fine things you were saying just now I wanted
 to come out and welcome you but I was afraid that it might be some
 demon knocking at the gates. That was why I didn't dare come out until
 I'd thrown a piece of brick at the bell to calm my fears. Please rise,
 my lord.&#8221;</P>
<P>Only then did Sanzang calm himself sufficiently to reply, &#8220;Lay
 brother, that fright was almost the death of me. Take me inside.&#8221; The
 lay brother led Sanzang straight in through the third pair of gates.
 What the Tang Priest saw here was quite different from outside:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A cloud-patterned wall built of blue bricks,</P>
<P>Halls roofed with green glazed tiles.</P>
<P>The holy statues were sheathed in gold,</P>
<P>The steps made of pure white jade.</P>
<P>Blue light danced in the Buddha hall;</P>
<P>Fine vapors rose from the Vairocana chapel.</P>
<P>Above the Manjusri hall</P>
<P>Were decorations of flying clouds;</P>
<P>In the Library of Scriptures</P>
<P>Were patterns of flowers and green leaves.</P>
<P>On the roof above the triple eaves stood a precious jar;</P>
<P>In the Tower of Five Blessings embroidered covers were spread.</P>
<P>A thousand bright bamboos waved over the dhyana seat;</P>
<P>Ten thousand bluish pines threw their light on the gates.</P>
<P>Jade-coloured clouds reflected gold on this palace;</P>
<P>Auspicious clouds drifted round the woods full of purple mist.</P>
<P>Each morning the fragrant breezes could be smelled all around;</P>
<P>In the evening painted drums were heard on the high hills.</P>
<P>There should be morning sunshine to patch torn robes;</P>
<P>How can the sutra be finished by the light of the moon?</P>
<P>The courtyard at the back is lit by half a wall of lamps;</P>
<P>A column of fragrant smoke shines in the hall.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sanzang saw this but did not dare go inside. &#8220;Lay brother,&#8221; he
 called, &#8220;why is the front of the monastery so dilapidated but the back
 so neat and tidy?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; said the lay brother with a smile, &#8220;these mountains are
 full of evil creatures and brigands. On clear days they roam the
 mountains to rob and on dull ones they shelter in the monastery. They
 knock the Buddha statues down to use as seats and burn the wooden
 pillars for firewood. The monks here are too feeble to argue with them,
 which is why they have abandoned the wrecked buildings at the front for
 the brigands to stay in. They have found some new benefactors to build
 the new monastery for them. Now there is one for the pure and one for
 the impure. This is how we do things in the West.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So that is the way things are,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>As he walked further Sanzang saw written over the gate in large
 letters SEA-GUARDING MONASTERY OF MEDITATION. Only then did he stride
 in through the gates, where a monk appeared coming towards him. Just
 see what the monk looked like:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>His hat of velvet and brocade was held with a pin,</P>
<P>And a pair of bronze rings hung from his ears.</P>
<P>His tunic was made of woolen stuff,</P>
<P>And his eyes were white and bright as silver.</P>
<P>He held in his hand a self-beating drum</P>
<P>As he recited scriptures in an unknown tongue.</P>
<P>Sanzang did not know before</P>
<P>That he was a lama on the road to the West.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As the lama came out he saw how very handsome and elegant Sanzang
 was: clear-browed and fine-eyed with a broad forehead and level top to
 his skull, ears hanging to his shoulders and arms so long they came
 below his knees. He looked like an arhat come down to earth. The lama,
 his face wreathed in smiles, went up to Sanzang chuckling with delight
 to grab hold of him, feel his hands and feet, rub his nose and tug at
 his ears as ways of showing his friendliness.</P>
<P>After leading Sanzang into the abbot's lodgings and going through the
 rituals of greeting the lama asked him, &#8220;Where have you come from,
 venerable Father?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have been sent by His Majesty the Emperor of Great Tang in the
 East to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures from Thunder
 Monastery in India in the West,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;As we were passing
 this way when it was becoming dark I have come to your distinguished
 monastery to put up here for the night before leaving early tomorrow
 morning. I beg you to grant me this expeditious help.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You shouldn't say that,&#8221; replied the lama with a smile, &#8220;you
 shouldn't say that. We didn't really want to become monks. We were all
 given life by our mothers and fathers and only cut our ties with them
 because we had unlucky destinies and our families could not afford to
 keep us. Even though we are now disciples of the Buddhist faith you
 must not talk empty words.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I spoke in all sincerity,&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;However far is the journey from the East to the Western Heaven?&#8221; the
 monk said. &#8220;Along the way there are mountains, there are caves in the
 mountains and there are spirits in the caves. I don't think that a lone
 traveler looking as delicate as you could possibly be a pilgrim going
 to fetch the scriptures.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You are quite right, abbot,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;I could never have
 got here alone. I have three disciples who clear my way across the
 mountains and build me bridges over rivers. It is only because they
 have protected me that I have been able to reach your monastery.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are your three distinguished disciples?&#8221; the lama asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Waiting outside the gates of the monastery,&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Father,&#8221; said the lama with alarm, &#8220;you don't realize that there are
 dangerous tigers, wolves, evil bandits, ghosts and demons here. We
 don't dare roam far even by day and we shut the gates before nightfall.
 How can you leave people outside this late?&#8221; He then told his disciples
 to ask them in at once.</P>
<P>Two young lamas hurried outside. At the sight of Monkey they fell
 over, and then fell over again when they saw Pig. Scrambling to their
 feet they ran back in as fast as they could and said, &#8220;My lord, your
 luck is out. Your disciples have disappeared. There are only three or
 four evil monsters standing outside the gates.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do they look like?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;One has a face like a thunder god,&#8221; the young lamas replied, &#8220;one
 has a face like a tilt-hammer, and one has a green face and terrible
 fangs. There is a girl with them too&#8212;she has oiled hair and a powdered
 face.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You would not know who they are,&#8221; replied Sanzang with a smile. &#8220;The
 three ugly ones are my disciples and the girl is someone I rescued in
 the pine forest.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; the lama said, &#8220;how can a master as handsome as you have
 found yourself such ugly disciples?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Ugly they may be,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;but they are all useful. Ask
 them in straight away. If you take any longer the one who looks like a
 thunder god is a bit of a trouble-maker. He was not born to a mother
 and father and he will fight his way in.&#8221;</P>
<P>The young lamas then hurried outside again and fell to their knees,
 shivering and shaking, as they said, &#8220;My lords, Lord Tang invites you
 in.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;if he's invited us, that's that. Why are they
 shivering and shaking?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They're scared because we're so ugly,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Rubbish,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;We were born that way. None of us is ugly from
 choice.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Make yourself look a bit less ugly,&#8221; said Monkey, and the idiot
 really did tuck his snout into his tunic and keep his head down as he
 led the horse while Friar Sand carried the pole and Brother Monkey
 brought up the rear, holding his cudgel in his hand and dragging the
 girl along. They went past the ruined buildings and cloisters and in
 through the third part of gates. When they had tethered the horse they
 went into the abbot's lodgings to meet the lama and take their seats in
 order of precedence. The lama then went inside to lead seventy or
 eighty young lamas to greet them, tidy their rooms, give them a
 vegetarian meal and look after them. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In storing up achievement be mindful of mercy;</P>
<P>When the Buddha's Dharma flourishes monks admire each other.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you do not know how they left the monastery, listen to the
 explanation in the next installment.</P>

</I>
<P>The Mind-Ape Recognizes a Monster in the Monastery</P>
<P>The Three Search for Their Master in Black Pine Forest</P>
</B>
<P>The story tells how Sanzang and his disciples came to the Meditation
 Monastery where they met the lamas and were given a vegetarian meal.
 When the four of them had eaten the girl was also fed. By now night was
 gradually falling and the lamp was lit in the abbot's lodgings. The
 lamas, who wanted to ask the Tang Priest about why he was going to
 fetch the scriptures and were also eager for a look at the girl, stood
 packed together in rows under the lamp. &#8220;Abbot,&#8221; said Sanzang to the
 lama he had first met, &#8220;when we leave your monastery tomorrow what will
 the road West be like?&#8221; Before answering, the lama fell to his knees.
 Sanzang quickly helped him up and said, &#8220;Stand up, please. Why do you
 greet me in this way when I ask about the road?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When you travel West tomorrow, reverend sir, you will find that the
 road is level,&#8221; the lama replied. &#8220;There is no need to worry. There is
 just one thing at present that is rather awkward. I wanted to tell you
 about it as soon as you came in, but I was afraid that it would offend
 your distinguished self. I only venture to tell you now that the meal
 is over that you will be most welcome to spend the night in the young
 lamas' room after your long, hard journey from the East. But it would
 not be right for the lady Bodhisattva to do so. I don't know where I
 should invite her to sleep.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your suspicions are not called for, abbot,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;and
 you should not suppose that my disciples and I have wicked ideas. When
 we were coming through Black Pine Forest this morning we found this
 girl tied to a tree. My disciple Sun Wukong refused to save her, but
 out of my enlightened heart I rescued her and have brought her here for
 you to put up, abbot.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As you have been so generous, reverend Father,&#8221; the abbot replied,
 &#8220;we can set out a straw mattress behind the devarajas in the Devaraja
 Hall for her to sleep on.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's splendid,&#8221; Sanzang said, &#8220;splendid.&#8221; After this the young
 lamas took the girl to sleep in the back of the hall while in the
 abbot's lodgings Sanzang urged the officials of the monastery to put
 themselves at their ease, whereupon they all dispersed.</P>
<P>&#8220;We have had a hard day,&#8221; Sanzang said to Brother Monkey. &#8220;We must go
 to bed early and be up early in the morning.&#8221; They all slept in the
 same room, guarding the master and not daring to leave him. Later that
 night</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The moon rose high and all was peaceful;</P>
<P>The Street of Heaven was quiet and nobody moved.</P>
<P>Bright was the Silver River; the stars shone clearly;</P>
<P>The drum in the tower hastened the changing watch.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We will say nothing more of the night. When Monkey rose at first
 light he told Pig and Friar Sand to get the luggage and the horse ready
 then urged the master to start out. But Sanzang wanted to sleep longer
 and would not wake up, so Monkey went up to him to call, &#8220;Master.&#8221;</P>
<P>The master raised his head but still could make no reply. &#8220;What will
 you say, Master?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why is my head spinning,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;why are my eyes swollen,
 and why an I aching all over from my skin to my bones?&#8221;</P>
<P>When Pig heard this he stretched out his hand to feel the master's
 body. It was feverish. &#8220;Now I understand,&#8221; said the idiot with a grin.
 &#8220;He had several bowls too many of last night's free rice and went to
 sleep head-down. It's indigestion.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; shouted Monkey, &#8220;Let me ask the master what's really the
 matter.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When I got up in the middle of the night to relieve myself,&#8221; Sanzang
 replied, &#8220;I did not put my hat on. I think I must have caught a chill
 in the wind.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm sure you're right,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;Can you travel now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I cannot even sit up,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;let alone mount the horse.
 The journey will have to wait.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a thing to say, Master,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;As the saying goes, 'A
 teacher for a day is one's father for life.' As your disciples we are
 like your sons. There's another saying that</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A son does not have to shit silver or gold;</P>
<P>As long as be can do what's needed he'll be fine.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you're not feeling well you shouldn't be worrying about the
 journey being delayed. There'll be no problem about waiting for a few
 days.&#8221; The three brother-disciples all looked after their master. The
 morning was followed by midday and dusk, and after a good night dawn
 returned. Time fled, and three days had soon passed.</P>
<P>The morning after that Sanzang tried to sit up, calling, &#8220;Wukong, as
 I have been very ill these last couple of days I have not asked you
 before: have people been giving food to the lady Bodhisattva we
 rescued?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What are you bothering about her for?&#8221; laughed Monkey, &#8220;What you
 should be concerned with is your own illness.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;Help me up and fetch me paper, brush and
 ink. Borrow an inkstone here in the monastery.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you want them for?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I want to write a letter,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;I shall seal it up with
 our passport and ask you to deliver it for me to His Majesty Emperor
 Taizong in Chang'an.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Easy,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;I may not be much good at anything else, but
 when it comes to delivering letters I'm the champion of the whole
 world. So wrap the letter up and give it to me. I'll take it to
 Chang'an in a single somersault, give it to the Tang Emperor, and come
 back with another somersault before your brush and inkstone have dried
 up. But why do you want to write a letter? Tell me what you want to say
 in the letter&#8212;you can write it down later.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is what I will write,&#8221; said Sanzang, weeping:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your subject beats his head three times upon the ground,</P>
<P>With a triple shout of 'Long live Your Majesty' as I bow to my lord.</P>
<P>The civil and military officials ate all present,</P>
<P>And four hundred courtiers all listen to what is said.</P>
<P>Years ago I left the East on your command,</P>
<P>Hoping to see the Buddha on the Vulture Peak.</P>
<P>But on my journey I have met with obstructions;</P>
<P>And been delayed by unexpected disaster along the way.</P>
<P>My illness is grave; I cannot move one step;</P>
<P>The gate to Buddha is as distant as the gate to heaven.</P>
<P>I will not live to bring back the scriptures;</P>
<P>I submit with respect that a new envoy should be sent.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he could not help bursting out into uproarious
 laughter. &#8220;You're hopeless, Master,&#8221; he said, &#8220;thinking that sort of
 thing after just a touch of illness. If you were seriously ill you'd
 only have to ask me to find out whether you were going to live or die.
 I have my own special way of dealing with it. I'd ask, 'Which king of
 the Underworld dared think of this? Which of the judges issued the
 warrant? Which demon messenger is coming to fetch him?' If they make me
 angry I'll lose my temper the way I did when I made havoc in Heaven,
 smash my way into the Underworld with my cudgel, capture the ten kings
 and rip the sinews out of every one of them. I'll show them no mercy.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop that boasting, disciple,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;I am very ill.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, going up to him, &#8220;it's very awkward to have the
 master saying he's in a bad way and you insisting he isn't. Let's
 settle things as quickly as we can, sell the horse, pawn the luggage,
 buy a coffin to bury the master in and split up.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're talking out of turn again, you idiot,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;What
 you don't realize is that the master used to be our Tathagata Buddha's
 second disciple. His original name was the Venerable Golden Cicada.
 This is great hardship he has to endure because he once slighted the
 Buddha's Dharma.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But, brother,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;even if the master did slight the
 Buddha's Dharma he was exiled to the East and born into another body
 amid the sea of right and wrong and the battlefield of tongues. He
 swore an oath to go to the Western Heaven, worship the Buddha and fetch
 the scriptures. Every time he's met an evil spirit he's been tied up;
 and every time he's come across a monster he's been hung up. He's had
 to put up with every kind of agony. That should be enough. Why has he
 had to be ill as well?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is something you wouldn't know about,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;The
 master once dropped off to sleep instead of listening to the Buddha
 teaching the Dharma, and as he drowsed he trod on a grain of rice with
 his left foot. That is why he has to be ill for three days in the lower
 world.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So goodness only knows how many years someone who eats as messily as
 I do will have to be ill,&#8221; replied a shocked Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;the Buddha will spare ordinary creatures
 such as you. There's something else you don't know. As the poet said,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Hoeing millet in the noonday sun;</P>
<P>Sweat drops on the ground beneath the millet.</P>
<P>Who understands that of the food that's in the bowl,</P>
<P>Every single grain was won through bitter toil?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The master will only be ill today. Tomorrow he'll be better.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am feeling different today from how I did yesterday,&#8221; said
 Sanzang. &#8220;My throat is absolutely parched. Go and find some cold water
 somewhere for me to drink.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Fine,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;If water's what you want, Master, that means
 you're better. I'll go and fetch some.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey at once took the begging bowl and went to the kitchen at the
 back of the monastery, where he came across all the monks red-eyed and
 sobbing with grief. The only thing was that they dared not cry aloud.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be so petty, little monks,&#8221; said Brother Monkey. &#8220;Before we
 leave we'll thank you for the days we've spent here, and we'll pay for
 our cooking fuel and lighting by the day. You really shouldn't be such
 pustules.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We wouldn't dare accept it,&#8221; the lamas said at once, falling to
 their knees, &#8220;we wouldn't dare.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean, you wouldn't dare?&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;It must be that
 long-snouted monk of ours who has an enormous appetite. He'd eat you
 out of house and home.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; the lamas replied, &#8220;there are over a hundred senior and
 junior lamas in this monastery. If each of us kept you for a single day
 we could afford to support you for over a hundred days. We're not the
 sort of skinflints who'd calculate what you will cost us in food.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you're not working out the cost then why are you sobbing?&#8221; Monkey
 asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Lord,&#8221; the lamas replied, &#8220;there's an evil monster in the monastery.
 We don't know which mountain it's from. Last night we sent two junior
 lamas to strike the bell and beat the drum. We heard the sound of the
 bell and the drum but the lamas never came back. When we looked for
 them the next day all we found were their monk's hats and shoes lying
 in the courtyard at the back and their skeletons. They had been eaten.
 In the three days you have been here six lamas have disappeared from
 the monastery. That's why we can't help being frightened and grieved.
 When we realized that your venerable master was ill we couldn't stop
 these tears stealing out even though we kept the news to ourselves.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Say no more,&#8221; said Brother Monkey, who was both shocked and
 delighted by what he heard. &#8220;It must be an evil monster who's killing
 people here. I'll wipe it out for you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; the lamas replied, &#8220;any evil spirit worthy of the name has
 magical powers. It's bound to be able to ride clouds, come out of the
 underworld and disappear again. As the ancients put it so well, 'Trust
 not the straightest of the straight; beware of the inhuman human.'
 Please don't take offence, my lord, when we say that if you can rid our
 monastery of this scourge that would be a great happiness for us. But
 if you can't catch it things will be pretty difficult.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean by things being pretty difficult?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;We will be honest with you, my lord,&#8221; the lamas replied. &#8220;Although
 there are only a hundred or so of us lamas in this monastery we all
 became monks as children:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When our hair grows we have it shaved off;</P>
<P>Our clothes are patched with rags.</P>
<P>We rise in the morning to wash our faces,</P>
<P>Then bow with hands together</P>
<P>In submission to the Great Way.</P>
<P>At night we tidy up, burn incense,</P>
<P>And piously pray,</P>
<P>Chanting the name of Amitabha.</P>
<P>When we look up we see the Buddha</P>
<P>On his ninefold lotus throne</P>
<P>Well-versed in the Three Vehicles,</P>
<P>Riding in his mercy on clouds of dharma,</P>
<P>And we long to see the Sakyamuni in the Jeta park.</P>
<P>Looking down we see into our hearts,</P>
<P>Accept the Five Prohibitions,</P>
<P>Pass through a thousand aeons,</P>
<P>And live each life amid the countless dharmas,</P>
<P>Hoping to understand emptiness and the impermanence of matter.</P>
<P>When the benefactors come,</P>
<P>Old, young, tall, short, fat, thin,</P>
<P>We each beat wooden fish,</P>
<P>Strike bronze chimes,</P>
<P>Slowly and deliberately,</P>
<P>With the two rolls of the Lotus Sutra</P>
<P>And the short<I> Litany of the Emperor of Liang.</I></P>
<P>When the benefactors do not come,</P>
<P>New, old, strange, familiar, rustic, smart,</P>
<P>We put our hands together,</P>
<P>Eyes shut,</P>
<P>Silent,</P>
<P>Entering meditation on the rush mats,</P>
<P>Firmly closing the gates under the moon.</P>
<P>Let the orioles sing and other birds chirp in idle strife:</P>
<P>They cannot mount our expeditions and compassionate chariot of
 dharma.</P>
<P>This is why we cannot subdue tigers and dragons,</P>
<P>Or recognize monsters and spirits.</P>
<P>If, my lord, you provoked the evil monster,</P>
<P>To which we hundred and more lamas would be but a single meal,</P>
<P>All of us living creatures would fall to the wheel of rebirth,</P>
<P>This ancient monastery of meditation would be destroyed,</P>
<P>And finally there would be no light at the Tathagata's assembly.</P>
<P>This would cause great troubles.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Brother Monkey heard the lamas say this anger surged up from his
 heart and hatred from his gall. &#8220;What a stupid lot you lamas are!&#8221; he
 shouted at the top of his voice. &#8220;Are you only aware of those evil
 spirits? Do you know nothing of what I've done?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Really we don't,&#8221; the lamas replied in very quiet voices.</P>
<P>&#8220;Then I'll tell you briefly about it,&#8221; Monkey said.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;I used to subdue tigers and dragons on the Mountain of Flowers and
 Fruit;</P>
<P>I once went up to Heaven and made great havoc in its palace.</P>
<P>When I was hungry I nibbled just two or three</P>
<P>Of Lord Lao Zi's elixir tablets;</P>
<P>When I was thirsty I sipped six or seven cups</P>
<P>Of the Jade Emperor's own wine.</P>
<P>When I glare with my golden eyes that are neither black nor white,</P>
<P>The sky turns deathly pale</P>
<P>While the moon is hidden in cloud.</P>
<P>When I wield my gold-banded cudgel that's the right length,</P>
<P>It strikes unseen</P>
<P>And leaves no trace behind.</P>
<P>What do I care about big or little monsters,</P>
<P>However rough or vicious they may be?</P>
<P>Once I go for them</P>
<P>They may run away, nimble about, hide or panic.</P>
<P>Whenever I grab one</P>
<P>They'll be filed down, cooked, ground to bits or pulverized in a
 mortar.</P>
<P>I'm like one of the eight immortals crossing the sea,</P>
<P>Each of whom gives a unique display of his magical powers.</P>
<P>Lamas, I'll catch that evil spirit and show it to you:</P>
<P>Then you'll know what sort of person this Monkey is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the lamas heard this they nodded and said quietly, &#8220;From the way
 this damned baldy is shooting his mouth off and talking big there must
 be something behind it all.&#8221;</P>
<P>They all made polite noises of respectful assent except for the older
 lama who said, &#8220;Wait. Your master is ill, and catching the evil spirit
 is not as important as that. As the saying goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When a young gentleman goes to a feast</P>
<P>He either gets drunk or eats till he's filled.</P>
<P>When a strong warrior goes into battle</P>
<P>He either is wounded or gets himself killed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you two fight it out here you may well get your master into
 trouble too. It's not a sound idea.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you're right. I'll take my master a
 drink of cold water and be right back.&#8221; Picking up the begging bowl he
 filled it with cold water, went out of the monastery kitchen and back
 to the abbot's lodgings and called, &#8220;Master, cold water for you.&#8221;
 Sanzang, who was just then suffering torments of thirst, raised his
 head, held the bowl with both hands, and took only one sip of the
 water. It really was a case of</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A drop when you're thirsty is just like sweet dew;</P>
<P>Get the right medicine and you'll feel good as new.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Seeing the venerable elder gradually recovering his spirits and
 looking less worried Monkey asked, &#8220;Could you manage some soup and
 other food, Master?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That cold water was a magical cure,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;I have
 already half recovered from my illness. I would like some food if there
 is any.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The master's better,&#8221; Monkey shouted repeatedly at the top of his
 voice. &#8220;He wants some soup and other food.&#8221; He told the lamas to
 arrange some at once. They washed and boiled rice, made noodles, cooked
 pancakes, steamed breadrolls, and prepared vermicelli soup. Four or
 five tables of food were carried in, but the Tang Priest ate only half
 a bowl of rice gruel, while Monkey and Friar Sand managed only a
 tableful between them. Pig gobbled up the rest. The dishes were then
 taken out, the lamp was lit, and the lamas dispersed.</P>
<P>&#8220;How long have we been here now?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Three whole days,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;By tomorrow evening it will be
 four days.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We could have covered a lot of distance in three days,&#8221; Sanzang
 replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Never mind about the distance, Master,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;We'll be on
 our way tomorrow.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;even if I am still a little poorly there is
 nothing that can be done.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If we're setting out tomorrow let me catch the evil spirit tonight,&#8221;
 said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;What evil spirit?&#8221; Sanzang asked in astonishment. &#8220;There's an evil
 spirit in this monastery that I'm going to catch for them,&#8221; Monkey
 replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;But how can you be having ideas like that before I have even
 recovered from my illness?&#8221; Sanzang asked. &#8220;If that monster has magical
 powers and you fail to catch it, then it will kill me, won't it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're always running people down,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Wherever we go
 I subdue evil creatures. Have you ever seen me come off second best?
 That could only happen if I did nothing. If I act I'm bound to win.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang, clutching him, &#8220;the saying is quite right
 that goes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Do people a good turn whenever you can;</P>
<P>If it is possible treat them with mercy.</P>
<P>Worrying cannot compare with true kindness;</P>
<P>Better be patient than strive for supremacy.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In the face of his master's impassioned pleas and refusal to allow
 him to subdue the monster, Monkey could only speak frankly.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll be honest with you, Master,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The evil spirit has been
 eating people here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Who has it eaten?&#8221; Sanzang asked with shock.</P>
<P>&#8220;In the three days we've been here it's eaten six of this monastery's
 young lamas,&#8221; Monkey said, to which Sanzang replied:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Foxes will grieve at the death of the hare;</P>
<P>Creatures will all for their own kind show care.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As it has eaten monks from this monastery and I am a monk too I will
 let you go, but do be careful.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No need to tell me,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;I'll wipe it out the moment I get
 my hands on it.&#8221;</P>
<P>Watch him as he tells Pig and Friar Sand in the lamplight to guard
 the master. When he leapt happily out of the abbot's lodgings and went
 back to the Buddha Hall he looked and saw that though there were stars
 in the sky the moon had not yet risen and it was dark inside the hall.
 He breathed out some of his magic fire to light the glazed lamp then
 beat the drum that stood to the East and struck the bell to the West.
 That done, he shook himself and turned himself into a young lama of
 only eleven or twelve who was wearing a yellow silk shirt and a white
 cotton tunic, striking a wooden fish with his hand as he recited a
 sutra. He waited till the first watch without seeing anything happen.
 The waning moon rose only in the second watch. Then a roaring wind
 could be heard. It was a splendid wind:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Black mists cast the sky into darkness;</P>
<P>Gloomy clouds cover the earth with murk.</P>
<P>Inky black in every quarter,</P>
<P>All enveloped in indigo.</P>
<P>At first the wind raises dust and dirt;</P>
<P>Then it blows down trees and ravages woods.</P>
<P>Amid the dust and dirt the stars still shine;</P>
<P>When trees go down and woods are ravaged the moonlight is obscured.</P>
<P>It blows so hard the Moon Goddess holds tight to the sala tree</P>
<P>And the Jade Hare hunts all around for the medicine dish.</P>
<P>The Nine Bright Shiner star lords shut their gates;</P>
<P>The dragon kings of the four seas close their doors.</P>
<P>The city god in his temple looks for the little devils;</P>
<P>Immortals in the sky cannot ride their clouds.</P>
<P>The kings of the Underworld search for their horse-faced demons</P>
<P>While the panicking judges get their turbans in a tangle.</P>
<P>The wind blows so hard it moves Mount Kunlun's rocks,</P>
<P>And churns up the waves on rivers and lakes.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As soon as the wind had passed by there was a fragrance of musk and
 incense and the tinkling of pendants. When Monkey looked up he saw that
 a woman of great beauty was going towards the Buddha Hall. Monkey
 mumbled the words of a sutra for all he was worth. The woman went up to
 him, put her arms around him and asked, &#8220;What's that sutra you're
 reciting?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;One I vowed to,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;But why are you still reciting it when the others are all asleep?&#8221;
 she insisted.</P>
<P>&#8220;I vowed to, so why shouldn't I?&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>Keeping a tight hold on him, the woman kissed his lips and said,
 &#8220;Let's go round the back for a bit of fun.&#8221; Monkey deliberately turned
 his head aside as he replied, &#8220;Stop being so naughty.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do you know how to tell people's fortunes from their faces?&#8221; the
 woman asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I know a bit about it,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;What can you tell about me?&#8221; she continued. &#8220;You look to me rather
 like someone who's been driven out by her parents-in-law for carrying
 on with strangers.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're wrong,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;you're wrong.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I have not been driven out by my parents-in-law,</P>
<P>Nor have I carried on with strangers.</P>
<P>Because of my ill fate in an earlier life</P>
<P>I was married to a husband who is much too young</P>
<P>And can't do his staff in the candlelit bedroom:</P>
<P>That is the reason why I have left my husband.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As the stars and moon are so bright tonight and we are fated to come
 hundreds of miles to meet each other, let's go round to the garden at
 the back to make love.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Brother Monkey heard this he nodded to himself and thought, &#8220;So
 those stupid lamas all died because they were led astray by lust. Now
 she's trying to lure me. Lady,&#8221; he said in reply, &#8220;I'm a monk and still
 very young. I don't know anything about love-making.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Come with me and I'll teach you,&#8221; the woman replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;All right then,&#8221; Monkey thought with an inward smile, &#8220;I'll go with
 her and see how she fixes things.&#8221;</P>
<P>Shoulder nestling against shoulder and hand in hand the two of them
 left the Buddha Hall and went straight to the garden at the back. Here
 the monster tripped Monkey over and sent him to the ground. With wild
 calls of &#8220;My darling!&#8221; she made a grab for his crotch.</P>
<P>&#8220;So you really want to eat me up, my girl,&#8221; he said, seizing her hand
 and throwing her off balance so that she somersaulted to the ground.</P>
<P>&#8220;So you can throw your sweetie to the ground, can you, my darling?&#8221;
 she said.</P>
<P>&#8220;If I don't take this chance to finish her off what am I waiting
 for?&#8221; he thought. &#8220;As they say, hit first and win, strike second and
 lose.&#8221; He leaned forward with his hands on his hips, sprang to his feet
 and reverted to his own form. With a swing of his gold-banded iron
 cudgel he struck at the monster's head.</P>
<P>In her astonishment she thought, &#8220;What a terror this young monk is.&#8221;
 When she opened her eyes wide for a better look she realized that he
 was the Tang Priest's disciple Monkey, but she was not afraid of him.
 What sort of evil spirit was she, you may wonder.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A golden nose,</P>
<P>Snowy white fur.</P>
<P>She makes her home in a tunnel,</P>
<P>Where she is thoroughly safe.</P>
<P>Three hundred years ago, after training her vital forces,</P>
<P>She paid several visits to the Vulture Peak,</P>
<P>Carrying a full load of flowers and wax candles.</P>
<P>Tathagata sent her down from Heaven.</P>
<P>She was a beloved daughter to the Pagoda-carrying Heavenly King;</P>
<P>Prince Nezha treated her as his own sister.</P>
<P>She was no bird that fills up the sea,</P>
<P>Nor was she a tortoise carrying mountains on its back.</P>
<P>She did not fear Lei Huan's swords</P>
<P>Nor was she afraid of Lu Qian's blade.</P>
<P>She came and went</P>
<P>Flowing like the mighty Han and Yangtse;</P>
<P>Moved up and down,</P>
<P>Even up a peak as high as Mounts Taishan and Heng.</P>
<P>Seeing the charming beauty of her face</P>
<P>You would never know she was a mouse-spirit with great powers.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In the pride in her enormous magic powers she held up a pair of
 swords that rang out as she parried to left and right, moving East and
 West. Although Monkey was rather stronger he could not overpower her.
 Then magic winds arose on all sides, dimming the waning moon. It was
 fine battle they fought in the garden at the back:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Evil winds blew from the ground;</P>
<P>Dim was the light of the waning moon.</P>
<P>Deserted was the hall of the Brahma Kings,</P>
<P>And the devils' cloister could not be clearly seen.</P>
<P>The back garden saw a battle Between the warrior Sun,</P>
<P>A sage in Heaven, And the furry girl,</P>
<P>A queen among women,</P>
<P>Both competing in magical powers and refusing to submit.</P>
<P>One turned her heart in anger from the dark-skinned baldy;</P>
<P>The other glared with his all-seeing eyes at the finely dressed
 woman.</P>
<P>With swords in her hands,</P>
<P>She is no female Bodhisattva.</P>
<P>The blows of the cudgel</P>
<P>Were as fierce as a living vajrapani's.</P>
<P>The resounding golden band flashed like lightning;</P>
<P>For an instant the iron shone white as a star.</P>
<P>In fine buildings they grabbed at the precious jade;</P>
<P>In golden halls the mandarin duck figurines were smashed.</P>
<P>As the apes howled the moon seemed small;</P>
<P>Vast was the sky as wild geese called.</P>
<P>The eighteen arhats</P>
<P>Applauded in secret;</P>
<P>Each of the thirty-two devas</P>
<P>Was struck with panic.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Great Sage Monkey was in such high spirits that his cudgel never
 missed. Realizing that she was no match for him, the evil spirit
 frowned suddenly and thought of a plan as she extricated herself and
 made off.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where do you think you're going, you baggage?&#8221; Monkey shouted.
 &#8220;Surrender at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>The evil spirit paid no attention and fled. When she was hard-pressed
 by Monkey's pursuit she took the embroidered shoe off her left foot,
 blew on it with a magic breath, said the words of a spell, called out,
 &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned it into a likeness of herself that came back at
 him waving a pair of swords. Meanwhile she turned her real body with a
 shake into a pure breeze and went.</P>
<P>This was Sanzang's star of disaster. She headed straight for the
 abbot's quarters, lifted Sanzang up into a cloud, and, on the instant,
 before anyone could see anything, she was back at Mount Pitfall and
 inside the Bottomless Cave, where she told her underlings to prepare a
 vegetarian marriage feast.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story switches back to Brother Monkey, who fought with desperate
 anxiety until he was able to seize an opening and smash the evil spirit
 to the ground with a single blow, only to find that she was in fact an
 embroidered shoe. Realizing that he had fallen for a trick he went
 straight back to see the master. But was the master there? There were
 only the idiot and Friar Sand muttering together. His chest bursting
 with fury, Monkey put all thought of what he ought to do out of his
 head and raised his cudgel to lay about him.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll kill the pair of you,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;I'll kill the pair of you.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot was desperate, but there was no way for him to escape.
 Friar Sand, however, as a general from the magic mountain who had seen
 a great deal, adopted a very mild and conciliatory approach when he
 stepped forward, knelt down and said, &#8220;Elder brother, I understand. I'm
 sure that after you've killed us two you intend to go straight back
 home instead of rescuing the master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When I've killed you two I'm going to rescue him myself,&#8221; Monkey
 retorted.</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you say that?&#8221; replied Friar Sand with a smile. &#8220;Without us
 two it would be a case of</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>You can't spin a thread from only one strand</P>
<P>Or clap with the palm of a single hand.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Who'd look after the luggage or the horse for you? We'd do much
 better to forget our differences and fight side by side like Guan Zhong
 and Bao Shuya than to have a battle of wits like Sun Bin and Pang Juan.
 As the old saying goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>To kill a tiger you need your brothers' help;</P>
<P>Have fathers and sons fight together in battle.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I hope you will spare us, brother, so that tomorrow morning we can
 all work together with a single mind in our search for the master.&#8221;
 Although his magical powers were tremendous Monkey knew what was right
 and needed at the time, so that Friar Sand's entreaties made him change
 his mind.</P>
<P>&#8220;Get up, Pig and Friar Sand,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But when we hunt for the
 master tomorrow you'll have to make a real effort.&#8221; The idiot was so
 grateful at being let off that he would gladly have promised Monkey
 half the sky.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; Friar Sand said, &#8220;leave it all to me.&#8221; The three brother
 disciples were so anxious that none of them could sleep. They wished
 they could make the sun rise in the East with a nod of the head and
 blow all the stars out of the sky with a single breath.</P>
<P>After sitting there till dawn the three of them packed up and were
 about to get out, only to find the gateway barred by one of the lamas,
 who asked, &#8220;Where are you going, gentlemen?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is most embarrassing,&#8221; Monkey replied with a smile. &#8220;Yesterday
 I boasted to all the monks that I'd capture the evil spirit for them.
 So far from me capturing her she's made my master disappear. We're off
 to look for him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; said the lamas with horror, &#8220;our trivial problem has got
 your master involved. Where will you look for him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I know where I'll look,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Even though you're going please don't be in such a hurry,&#8221; said the
 lamas. &#8220;Have some breakfast first.&#8221; Two or three bowls of hot gruel
 were brought in that Pig cleaned up with great gusto.</P>
<P>&#8220;What fine monks,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When we've found the master we'll come
 back here to see you again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What you mean is come back to eat their food,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Go and
 see if the girl is still in the devarajas' hall.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;She's gone, my lord,&#8221; the lamas said, &#8220;she's gone. She has spent
 only one night there and is gone the next morning.&#8221; Monkey cheerfully
 took his leave of the lamas and made Pig and Friar Sand lead the horse
 and carry the luggage as they headed back East.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;you're wrong. Why are we going East?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You wouldn't know,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;That girl who was tied up in the
 Black Pine Forest the other day&#8212;I saw through her with my fiery eyes
 and golden pupils, but you all thought she was a good person. And now
 it's her who's eaten the monks and her who's carried the master off.
 You all did a fine thing rescuing that 'lady Bodhisattva'. As she's
 carried the master off we're going back the way we came to look for
 her.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Good, good,&#8221; sighed the other two with admiration. &#8220;You're much
 cleverer than you look. Let's go.&#8221;</P>
<P>The three of them hurried back into the forest, where this was what
 could be seen:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Piles of cloud,</P>
<P>Heavy mists,</P>
<P>Many a layer of rock,</P>
<P>A twisting path.</P>
<P>The tracks of foxes and hares cross each other;</P>
<P>Tiger, leopard, jackal and wolf move in and out of the undergrowth.</P>
<P>With no sign of a monster to be seen in the wood</P>
<P>They do not know where Sanzang might be found.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In his anxiety Monkey pulled out his cudgel, shook himself and made
 himself look as he had when he made great havoc in Heaven, with three
 heads, six arms and six hands wielding three cudgels. With these he
 lashed out furiously and noisily among the trees.</P>
<P>&#8220;Friar Sand,&#8221; said Pig when he saw this, &#8220;not finding the master has
 made him go off his head.&#8221; In fact Monkey had beat a way through the
 trees and flushed out two old men&#8212;the mountain god and the local
 deity&#8212;who went up to him, knelt down and said, &#8220;Great Sage, the god of
 this mountain and the local deity pay their respects.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That rod certainly gets results,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;He clears a path with
 it and flushes out the mountain god and the local deity. If he cleared
 another path he'd even flush out an evil star.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Mountain god, local deity,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you're a disgrace. You're
 hand in glove with the bandits here. When they make a good haul they
 buy pigs and sheep to sacrifice to you. On top of that you're
 accomplices of the evil spirit. You helped her kidnap my master and
 bring him here. Where's he being hidden? If you want to be spared a
 beating tell me the truth right now.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; the two gods said with alarm, &#8220;you are misjudging us.
 The evil spirit doesn't live on our mountain or come within our
 jurisdiction. But when the wind blows at night we have heard a thing or
 two about her.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Tell me everything you know,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;The evil spirit carried your master off to a place over three
 hundred miles due South of here,&#8221; the local deity replied. &#8220;There's a
 mountain there called Mount Pitfall with a cave in it called the
 Bottomless Cave. He was taken there by a disguised evil spirit from
 that cave.&#8221; This news gave Monkey a shock that he did not reveal.</P>
<P>Shouting at the mountain god and the local deity to dismiss them he
 put his magical appearance away, turned back into himself and said to
 Pig and Friar Sand, &#8220;The master's a long way from here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If it's a long way let's go there by cloud,&#8221; Pig replied.</P>
<P>The splendid idiot went ahead on a wild wind followed by Friar Sand
 on a cloud. As the white horse had originally been a dragon's son he
 too came by wind and mist as he carried the luggage on his back. The
 Great Sage set off by somersault as he headed due South, and before
 long a high mountain came into view that was blocking the way for the
 clouds.</P>
<P>The three of them took hold of the horse and stopped their clouds.
 This is what the mountain looked like:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The summit touched the azure sky,</P>
<P>Its peaks joined with the blue of the heavens.</P>
<P>Trees by the million grew on every side,</P>
<P>While flying birds sung noisily all around.</P>
<P>Tigers and leopards moved in packs,</P>
<P>Water deer and roebuck walked through the bushes.</P>
<P>On the Southern slopes rare flowers bloomed fragrant;</P>
<P>On the Northern side the snow never melted.</P>
<P>Steep and craggy were its ridges,</P>
<P>Sheer were its overhangs and rockfaces.</P>
<P>Pinnacles shot straight up</P>
<P>And deep ravines curved all around.</P>
<P>It was dark green among the pines,</P>
<P>And the rocks were jagged.</P>
<P>It struck fear into the traveler's heart.</P>
<P>No sign could be seen of woodcutters,</P>
<P>And the immortal boys picking herbs had vanished.</P>
<P>The tigers and leopards here could make mists,</P>
<P>And all the foxes set winds roaring.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;this mountain's so high and sheer there must be
 evil on it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Goes without saying,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;High mountains all have
 monsters; there's never a steep ridge without spirits. Friar Sand,&#8221; he
 called, &#8220;you and I are going to stay here while we send Pig into the
 mountain hollows to look around and find out the best way for us to
 take. If there really is a cave palace he must discover where the
 entrance is. Find everything out so that we can go in together to find
 the master and rescue him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Just my lousy luck,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;having to go first and take the
 brunt.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Last night you said we could leave it all to you,&#8221; Monkey replied,
 &#8220;so why are you trying to get out of it now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop shouting at me,&#8221; Pig said. &#8220;I'm going.&#8221; The idiot put down his
 rake, tugged at his clothes and leapt empty-handed down from the
 mountain to find the path.</P>
<P>If you don't know whether this departure was to be for good or ill
 listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<P></P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="1_0_83">Chapter 82</A></H3>
</I>
<P>The Girl Seeks the Male</P>
<P>The Primal Deity Guards the Way</P>
</B>
<P>The story tells how Pig leapt down the mountainside and found a
 narrow path. After following it for nearly two miles he came across two
 she-monsters drawing water from a well. How did he know that they both
 were monsters? Each of them had on her head an extremely unfashionable
 hair-style held up by bamboo slivers that stood one foot two or three
 inches high.</P>
<P>&#8220;Evil monsters,&#8221; Pig called, going up to them.</P>
<P>The two of them looked at each other and said. &#8220;What an outrageous
 monk. We don't know him and we've never had words with him. So why did
 he call us evil monsters?&#8221; In their fury the monsters raised the pole
 with which they were going to carry the water and struck at Pig's head.</P>
<P>After a few blows that he could not ward off as he was unarmed, the
 idiot rushed back up the mountain with his head covered by both hands
 shouting, &#8220;Brother! Go back! The monsters are vicious.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What's so vicious about them?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;There were two evil spirits drawing water from the well in the
 hollow,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;and they hit me three or four times with their
 carrying-pole just because I spoke to them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What did you call them?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Evil monsters,&#8221; Pig replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;You got off lightly then,&#8221; laughed Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm most obliged for your concern,&#8221; replied Pig. &#8220;My head has
 swollen up where they hit it, and you tell me I've got off lightly.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Soft words will get you anywhere on earth; act rough and you won't
 move a single step,&#8221; replied Monkey. &#8220;As they're local fiends from
 round here and we're monks from far away you'd have had to be a bit
 polite even if you'd had fists growing all over your body. Do you think
 they should have hit me instead of you? You were the one who called
 them evil monsters. Courtesy first!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I never realized,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;Living on human flesh in the mountains since childhood as you have,&#8221;
 said Monkey, &#8220;can you recognize two kinds of tree?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I don't know,&#8221; Pig said. &#8220;Which two trees?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The willow and the sandalwood,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;The willow has a
 very soft nature, so that craftsmen can carve it into holy images or
 make statues of the Tathagata out of it. It's gilded, painted, set with
 jewels, decorated with flowers, and many worshippers burn incense to
 it. It receives unbounded blessings. But the sandalwood is so hard that
 it's used as the pressing-beam in the oil-press with iron hoops round
 its head, and it's hit with iron hammers too. The only reason it
 suffers like this is because it's to hard.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You should have told me all this before,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;then I wouldn't
 have been beaten.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Now go back and find out the truth,&#8221; said Brother Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;But if I go there again they'll recognize me,&#8221; Pig replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Then turn into something else,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;But even if I do turn into something else, brother, how am I to
 question them?&#8221; asked Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;When you look different go up to them and bow to them,&#8221; Monkey
 replied. &#8220;See how old they are. If they're about the same age as us
 call them 'Miss,' and if they're a lot older call them 'Lady.'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a terrible climb-down: why should we be treating them as our
 relations when they're strangers from this far away?&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;That's not treating them as relations,&#8221; replied Monkey. &#8220;Its just a
 way of getting the truth out of them. If they're the ones who've got
 our master we'll be able to act; and if it isn't them we won't lose any
 time before going to fight elsewhere.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;I'm going back.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid idiot tucked his rake in his belt, went down into the
 hollow, shook himself and turned into a far, dark-skinned monk. He
 swaggered as he went up to the monsters, chanted a loud &#8220;na-a-aw&#8221; of
 respect and said, &#8220;Respectful greetings, ladies.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This monk's much better,&#8221; the two monsters said with delight. &#8220;He
 expresses his respects and knows how to address us properly.&#8221; Then they
 asked him, &#8220;Where are you from, venerable elder?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;From somewhere,&#8221; Pig replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;And where are you going?&#8221; they asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Somewhere,&#8221; Pig replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;What's your name?&#8221; they asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;What it is,&#8221; Pig replied again.</P>
<P>&#8220;Better he may be,&#8221; the monsters said with a laugh, &#8220;but he won't
 tell us about himself. He just echoes our questions.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Ladies,&#8221; Pig asked, &#8220;why are you fetching water?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You wouldn't know, monk,&#8221; the demons replied with smiles. &#8220;Our lady
 brought a Tang Priest back to the cave last night and she wants to look
 after him well. As the water in our cave is none too clean she's sent
 us two to fetch some of this good water produced by the mating of the
 Yin and the Yang. She's laid on a vegetarian banquet as well for the
 Tang Priest; she's going to marry him this evening.&#8221;</P>
<P>As soon as he heard this the idiot rushed straight back up the
 mountain shouting. &#8220;Friar Sand, bring the luggage here at once. We're
 dividing it up.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why, brother?&#8221; Friar Sand asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;When we've divided it up you can go back to man-eating in the
 Flowing Sands River,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;I'll return to Gao Village to see
 my wife, Big Brother can play the sage on the Mountain of Flowers and
 Fruit, and the white dragon can be a dragon in the ocean again. The
 master's getting married in this evil spirits cave. Let's all go and
 settle down.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're talking nonsense again, you idiot,&#8221; replied Brother Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;I bloody well am not,&#8221; Pig retorted. &#8220;Those two evil spirits who
 were carrying water said a moment ago that a vegetarian wedding feast
 is being laid on for the master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you say things like that when the evil spirits are holding
 the master prisoner in the cave and he's longing for us to go in and
 rescue him?&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;How can we rescue him?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;You two bring the horse and the luggage, while we go with the two
 she-monsters as our guides,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;When we reach the
 entrance we can act together.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot could only go with Monkey as he followed the two monsters
 for five or six miles deep into the mountains before suddenly
 disappearing. &#8220;So the master was captured by a devil in broad
 daylight,&#8221; exclaimed Pig with surprise.</P>
<P>&#8220;You've got good eyesight,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;How can you possibly tell
 what they really were?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Those two monsters were carrying the water along when suddenly they
 disappeared. They must be daytime devils.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I think they went into a cave,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Wait while I go to
 have a look.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage opened his fiery eyes with their golden
 pupils and scanned the whole mountain. He saw no movement, but did spot
 a ceremonial archway most intricately made with many flowers and
 colours, triple eaves and fourfold decorations in front of the cliff.
 Going closer with Pig and Friar Sand he saw four large words written on
 it:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>PITFALL MOUNTAIN: BOTTOMLESS CAVE</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brothers,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;here's the evil spirits' archway, but I
 still don't know where the entrance is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Can't be far,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;can't be far. Let's have a good
 look for it.&#8221; When they turned round to look they saw a great rock over
 three miles around at the foot of the mountain beneath the archway. In
 the middle of it was a hole the size of a water-vat, which had become
 very slippery by repeated climbing.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;that's where the evil spirits go in and out of
 their cave.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's very strange,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;To be frank with the two of you,
 I've captured quite a few evil spirits since I started escorting the
 Tang Priest, but I've never seen a cave palace like this one before.
 Pig, you go down first and find out how deep it is. Then I'll be able
 to go in and rescue the master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It'll be hard,&#8221; said Pig with a shake of his head, &#8220;very hard. I'm
 very clumsy. If I tripped and fell in it might take me two or three
 years to reach the bottom.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How deep is it then?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Look,&#8221; Pig replied, and as the Great Sage leant over the edge of the
 hole to take a careful look he saw to his astonishment that it was very
 deep indeed and must have measured over a hundred miles around.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's very, very deep, brother,&#8221; he turned round to say.</P>
<P>&#8220;Go back then,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;The master's beyond saving.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a thing to say!&#8221; Monkey retorted. &#8220;'Have no thoughts of being
 lazy; put idleness out of your mind.' Put the luggage down, and tether
 the horse to one of the legs of the archway. You and Friar Sand must
 block the entrance with your rake and staff while I go inside to
 explore. If the master really is inside I'll drive the evil spirits out
 with my iron cudgel, and when they reach the entrance you mustn't let
 them out. We'll only be able to kill the evil spirits and rescue the
 master if we work together.&#8221; The other two accepted their orders.</P>
<P>Monkey sprang into the hole, and under his feet tea thousand coloured
 clouds appeared, while a thousand layers of auspicious mist shielded
 him. He was soon at the bottom, which was a very long way down. Inside
 all was bright; there was the same sunshine, winds, flowers, fruit and
 trees as in the world above.</P>
<P>&#8220;What a splendid place,&#8221; Monkey thought. &#8220;It reminds me of the Water
 Curtain Cave that Heaven gave me in the place where I was born. This is
 another cave paradise.&#8221; As he looked around he saw a gate-tower with
 double eaves around which grew many clumps of pine and bamboo. Inside
 were many buildings.</P>
<P>&#8220;This must be where the evil spirit lives,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;I'll go in
 and find out what's up. No, wait. If I go in like this she'll recognize
 me. I'd better transform myself.&#8221; With a shake and a hand-spell he
 turned himself into a fly and flew lightly up to land on the gate-tower
 and listen in. From here he saw the monster sitting at her ease in a
 thatched pavilion. She was dressed far more beautifully than she had
 been when they rescued her in the pine forest or when she had tried to
 catch Monkey in the monastery:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Her hair was piled in a crow-black coiffure;</P>
<P>She wore a green velvet waistcoat.</P>
<P>Her feet were a pair of curving golden lotuses;</P>
<P>Her fingers were as delicate as bamboo shoots in spring.</P>
<P>Her powdered face was like a silver dish,</P>
<P>And her red lips were as glossy as a cherry.</P>
<P>She was a regular beauty,</P>
<P>Even more lovely than the lady on the moon.</P>
<P>After capturing the pilgrim monk that morning</P>
<P>She was going to know the pleasure of sharing his bed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey said nothing as he listened out for what she might say. Before
 long the cherry of her lips parted as she said with great pleasure,
 &#8220;Lay on a vegetarian feast, my little ones, and quick. My darling Tang
 Priest and I are going to be man and wife afterwards.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So it's true,&#8221; thought Brother Monkey, grinning to himself. &#8220;I
 thought Pig was just joking. I'd better fly in and find the master. I
 wonder what state of mind he's in. If he's been led astray I'm leaving
 him here.&#8221; When he spread his wings and flew inside to look he saw the
 Tang Priest sitting in a corridor behind a trellis covered with opaque
 red paper below and left clear above.</P>
<P>Butting a hole through the trellis paper Monkey landed on the Tang
 Priest's bald head and called, &#8220;Master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Save me, disciple,&#8221; replied Sanzang, who recognized Monkey's voice.</P>
<P>&#8220;You're useless, Master,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;The evil spirit is laying on
 a feast, and when you've eaten it you two are getting married. I expect
 you'll have a son or a daughter to start another generation of monks
 and nuns. What have you got to be so upset about?&#8221;</P>
<P>When the venerable elder heard this he gnashed his teeth and said,
 &#8220;Disciple, in all the time since I left Chang'an, accepted you as my
 follower at the Double Boundary Mountain and started my journey West,
 when have I ever eaten meat or had any wicked ideas? Now the evil
 spirit has captured me she is insisting that I mate with her. If I lose
 my true masculine essence may I fall from the wheel of reincarnation
 and be fixed for ever behind the Dark Mountains, never to rise again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No need to swear any oaths,&#8221; said Monkey with a grin. &#8220;If you really
 want to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven I'll take you
 there.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I can't remember the way I came in,&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Never mind about forgetting,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;You won't get out of
 here as easily as you came in, which was from the top downwards. If I
 save you now you'll have to go from the bottom upwards. If you're very
 lucky you'll squeeze out through the entrance and get away. But if your
 luck's out you won't be able to squeeze through and sooner or later
 you'll die of suffocation.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is terrible,&#8221; said Sanzang, the tears pouring from his eyes.
 &#8220;What are we to do?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No problem,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;no problem. The evil spirit's getting
 some wine prepared for you. You'll have to drink a goblet of it whether
 you want to or not. But you must pour it out quickly so that it makes a
 lot of froth. Then I can turn myself into a tiny insect and fly under
 the bubbles. When she gulps me down into her belly I'll tear her heart
 and liver to shreds and rip her guts apart. Once I've killed her you'll
 be able to escape.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But that would be an inhuman thing to do, disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;If all you're interested in is being kind you're done for,&#8221; Monkey
 replied. &#8220;The evil spirit's a murderess. What do you care so much about
 her for?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Oh well,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;never mind. But you will have to stay with
 me.&#8221; Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Great Sage Sun guarded Tang Sanzang well;</P>
<P>The pilgrim priest depended on the Handsome Monkey King.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Master and disciple had not even finished their discussion when the
 evil spirit, who had arranged everything, came in along the corridor,
 unlocked the doors and called, &#8220;Reverend sir.&#8221; The Tang Priest dared
 not reply. She addressed him again, and again he dared not reply. Why
 was that? He was thinking that</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Divine energy is dispersed by an open mouth;</P>
<P>Trouble starts when the tongue begins to move.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He was thinking with all his heart that if he obstinately refused to
 open his mouth she might turn vicious and murder him in an instant.
 Just when he was feeling confused, wondering which difficult
 alternative to choose and asking himself what to do, the evil spirit
 addressed him as &#8220;Reverend sir&#8221; for the third time.</P>
<P>The Tang Priest had no choice but to answer, &#8220;Here I am, madam.&#8221; For
 him to give this reply was to make all the flesh fall off him. Now
 everybody says that the Tang Priest is a sincere monk, so how could he
 reply to the she-devil when he was on his way to worship the Buddha and
 fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven? What you would not
 realize is that this was a crisis in which his very survival was at
 stake, that he had absolutely no alternative; and although he went
 through the form of replying he was free of desire inside. But when the
 evil spirit heard his reply she pushed the door open, helped the Tang
 Priest to his feet, held his hand, stood with her side pressed against
 his and whispered in his ear. Just look at her as she lays on the charm
 and makes herself alluring in every possible way. She did not realize
 that Sanzang was full of revulsion.</P>
<P>&#8220;From the way she's making herself so seductive,&#8221; Monkey thought with
 a wry grin to himself, &#8220;I'm worried that she might get the master
 interested.&#8221; Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The monk in demon trouble met a pretty girl;</P>
<P>The she-devil's beauty was truly superb.</P>
<P>Her slender jade eyebrows were like two willow leaves;</P>
<P>Her round face was set off with peach blossom.</P>
<P>Embroidered shoes gave a sight of a pair of phoenixes;</P>
<P>Her crow-black hair was piled high at the temples.</P>
<P>As smiling she led the master by his hand</P>
<P>His cassock was tinged with orchid and musk.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Her arms around him, the she-devil took the master to a thatched
 pavilion and said, &#8220;Reverend sir, I've had a drink brought here to have
 with you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Lady,&#8221; said the Tang Priest, &#8220;as a monk I can take no impure food.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I know,&#8221; the evil spirit replied. &#8220;As the water in the cave isn't
 clean I've sent for some of the pure water from the mating of the Yin
 and the Yang up on the mountain, and had a banquet of fruit and
 vegetables prepared. After that you and I are going to have some fun.&#8221;
 When the Tang Priest went into the pavilion with her this is what could
 be seen:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>All within the gates</P>
<P>Was decked in silks and embroideries;</P>
<P>Throughout the hall</P>
<P>Incense rose from golden lion censers.</P>
<P>Black-painted inlaid tables were set in rows,</P>
<P>On which stood dark-lacquered bamboo dishes.</P>
<P>On the inlaid tables</P>
<P>Were all kinds of delicacies;</P>
<P>In the bamboo dishes</P>
<P>Were vegetarian delights:</P>
<P>Crab apples, olives, lotus seeds, grapes, torreya-nuts,</P>
<P>hazelnuts, pine-nuts, lichees, longans, chestnuts, water caltrops,
 jujubes, persimmons, walnuts, gingko nuts, kumquats and oranges.</P>
<P>There was the fruit that grows on every hill,</P>
<P>The fresh vegetables of each season;</P>
<P>Beancurd, wheat gluten, tree-ear fungus, fresh bamboo shoots, button
 mushrooms, gill fungus, yams, sealwort, agar, day lily fried in
 vegetable oil,</P>
<P>Hyacinth beans, cowpeas prepared with mature sauces.</P>
<P>Cucumbers, gourds, gingko, turnip greens.</P>
<P>Peeled aubergines were cooked like quails;</P>
<P>Seeded wax gourds</P>
<P>Taro stewed tender and sprinkled with sugar,</P>
<P>Turnips boiled in vinegar.</P>
<P>Pungent chili and ginger made it all delicious;</P>
<P>All the dishes were a balance of bland and salty.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Revealing the tips of her jade fingers she raised a dazzling golden
 goblet that she filled with fine wine. &#8220;Dearest reverend gentleman,&#8221;
 she said, handing it to him, &#8220;my darling, have a drink to celebrate our
 happy union.&#8221; Sanzang was covered with embarrassment as he took the
 wine.</P>
<P>He poured a libation into the air as he prayed silently, &#8220;Devas who
 guard the Dharma, Guardians of the Four Quarters and the Centre, Four
 Duty Gods: your disciple Chen Xuanzang has benefited from the secret
 protection of all you deities sent by the Bodhisattva Guanyin on my
 journey to pay my respects at the Thunder Monastery, see the Buddha and
 seek the scriptures. I have now been captured by an evil spirit on my
 way. She is forcing me to marry her and has now handed me this cup of
 wine to drink. If this really is pure wine I can force myself to drink
 it and still be able to succeed and see the Buddha. But if it is impure
 wine I will be breaking my vows and fall for ever into the bitterness
 of the wheel of rebirth.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Great Sage Sun made himself tiny and was like a secret informant
 behind his master's ear. When he spoke Sanzang was the only one who
 could hear him. Knowing that his master was normally fond of the pure
 wine of grapes he told him to drain the goblet. Sanzang had no choice
 but to do so, quickly refill the goblet and hand it back to the evil
 spirit. As he filled it bubbles of happiness formed on the surface of
 the wine. Brother Monkey turned himself into the tiniest of insects and
 flew lightly under the bubbles. But when the spirit took the goblet she
 put it down instead of drinking from it, bowed twice to the Tang Priest
 and spoke loving words to him with charming bashfulness. By the time
 she lifted the cup the bubbles had burst and the insect was revealed.
 Not realizing that it was Monkey transformed the evil spirit took it
 for a real insect, lifted it out with her little finger and flicked it
 away.</P>
<P>Seeing that as things were not going as he intended he would be
 unable to get into her belly Monkey turned himself into a hungry eagle.</P>
<P>Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Jade claws, gold eyes and iron wings;</P>
<P>In terrible might he rose above the clouds.</P>
<P>Cunning hares and foxes felt faint at just the sight,</P>
<P>And hid among mountains and rivers for hundred of miles around.</P>
<P>When hungry it chased small birds into the wind,</P>
<P>And rose to the gate of heaven when replete.</P>
<P>Murderous were its talons of steel;</P>
<P>In times of triumph it stayed aloof in the clouds.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey flew up, swung his jade claws, and noisily overturned the
 tables, smashing all the fruit, vegetables and crockery, and leaving
 the Tang Priest alone there as he flew off. This was so terrifying that
 the she-devil's heart and gall were split open, and the Tang Priest's
 flesh and bones were turned crisp. Shivering and shaking, the evil
 spirit threw her arms round the Tang Priest and said, &#8220;Dearest reverend
 gentleman, wherever did that come from?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I don't know,&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;I went to a great deal of trouble to arrange this vegetarian feast
 for you,&#8221; the she-devil said. &#8220;Goodness only knows where that feathered
 brute flew in from and smashed our crockery.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Smashing the crockery doesn't really matter,&#8221; the junior demons
 said, &#8220;but all the food has been spilt on the floor. It's too dirty to
 eat now.&#8221; Sanzang by now realized that this was all the result of
 Monkey's magic, but he dared not say so.</P>
<P>&#8220;Little ones,&#8221; said the she-devil, &#8220;I realize now. It must be heaven
 and earth that sent that thing down here because they can't tolerate my
 holding the Tang Priest prisoner. Clear all the broken dishes up and
 lay on another banquet. Never mind whether it's vegetarian or not.
 Heaven can be our matchmaker and the earth our guarantor. After that
 the Tang Priest and I will become man and wife.&#8221; We will say no more of
 her as she took the Tang Priest to sit in the East corridor.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Instead the story tells of how Monkey flew out, turned back into
 himself, reached the entrance to the cave and shouted, &#8220;Open up!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Friar Sand,&#8221; Pig shouted, &#8220;our big brother's here.&#8221; As the two of
 them drew their weapons away Monkey sprang out.</P>
<P>&#8220;Is there an evil spirit in there?&#8221; Pig asked, grabbing hold of him.
 &#8220;Is the master in there?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;The master must be having a hard time in there,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;Are his
 arms tied behind his back? Or is he all roped up? Is she going to steam
 him or boil him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;None of them,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;She'd just had a vegetarian feast
 served and was going to do it with him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So you've been lucky then,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;You must have drunk a wedding
 toast.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Idiot!&#8221; retorted Monkey, &#8220;Never mind about having a wedding drink. I
 can hardly keep him alive.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Then why are you here?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>Monkey told how he had seen the master and done his transformations,
 ending, &#8220;Don't let your fears run away with you, brothers. The master's
 here, and when I go back in this time I'll definitely rescue him.&#8221;</P>
<P>Going back inside, Monkey turned into a fly and landed on the
 gate-tower to listen. He could hear the she-devil snorting with fury as
 she gave instructions within the pavilion.</P>
<P>&#8220;Little ones, bring whatever there is, vegetarian or not, and burn
 paper as offerings to the deities. I'll ask heaven and earth to be the
 matchmakers. I'm definitely going to marry him.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he smiled to himself and thought, &#8220;That
 she-devil's completely shameless. She's locked a monk up in her home
 and now she's going to mess around with him in broad daylight. But
 don't be in too much of a hurry. Give me time to go in and have a look
 round.&#8221; With a buzz he flew along the corridor to see the master
 sitting inside, tears streaming down his face.</P>
<P>Monkey squeezed in, landed on Sanzang's head and called, &#8220;Master.&#8221;
 Recognizing the voice, Sanzang sprang to his feet and said with
 tooth-gnashing fury, &#8220;Macaque! Other people get their courage from a
 big gall, but they have to wrap their bodies around it. Your gall is so
 big that you wrap it round your body. You used your magical powers of
 transformation to smash the crockery, but what use is that? By fighting
 that she-devil you've only made her more sex-crazed than ever. She is
 arranging a banquet with vegetarian and impure food all mixed up and is
 determined to mate with me. Where will this all end?&#8221;</P>
<P>Smiling to himself again, Monkey replied, &#8220;Don't be angry with me,
 Master. I've got a way to save you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How will you save me?&#8221; the Tang Priest asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;When I flew up just now,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;I saw that she has a garden
 behind here. You must lure her into the garden to fool around and I'll
 rescue you from there.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How will you rescue me from the garden?&#8221; the Tang Priest asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Go to the peach trees in the garden with her and stay there. Wait
 till I've flown to a branch of the peach tree and turned into a red
 peach. When you want to eat a peach pick the red one first&#8212;that will
 be me. She'll be bound to pick one too. You must insist on giving her
 the red one. Once she's swallowed it I'll be in her stomach. When I
 tear her stomach to pieces and rip her guts to shreds she'll be dead
 and you'll be freed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;With your powers you ought to fight her,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;Why do you
 want to get into her stomach?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't understand, Master,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;If it were easy to
 get in and out of this cave of hers I would be able to fight her. But
 this place is very hard to get into or out of: the way out is
 complicated and difficult. If I started a fight with her all the fiends
 in her den, young and old, would overpower me. Then how would it end?
 We must act carefully if we're all to make a clean getaway.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang nodded, believing all that Monkey said, adding only, &#8220;You
 must stay with me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said monkey, &#8220;I know. I'll be on your head.&#8221;</P>
<P>When master and disciple had settled their plan Sanzang leaned
 forward, took hold of the bars in the corridor's gates and called out,
 &#8220;Lady, lady.&#8221;</P>
<P>As soon as she heard this the evil spirit came rushing over, a
 simpering smile on her face, to ask, &#8220;What do you have to say to me, my
 wonderful darling?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Lady,&#8221; replied Sanzang, &#8220;ever since leaving Chang'an and starting on
 my journey to the West I have had to cross mountains and rivers every
 single day. When I was staying in the Zhenhai Monastery last night I
 caught a bad chill and I have been in a sweat today. I was just
 beginning to feel a little better today when in your kindness, good
 lady, you brought me into your immortals' palace. As I have been
 sitting here all day I am now feeling in rather low spirits again.
 Could you take me somewhere to cheer myself up and have a little fun?&#8221;</P>
<P>The evil spirit was utterly delighted. &#8220;So you're feeling a bit
 interested, are you, my wonderful darling?&#8221; she said. &#8220;You and I will
 go into the garden for some fun. Little ones,&#8221; she called, &#8220;fetch the
 key, open the garden gates, and sweep the paths in the garden.&#8221; The
 demons all hurried off to open the gates and tidy the place up.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the evil spirit was opening the screen and helping the Tang
 Priest out. Just watch the many young demons&#8212;all willowy beauties with
 oiled hair and powdered faces&#8212;crowding around the Tang Priest as they
 head for the garden. What a splendid monk he was, walking amid these
 beauties in their gauze and brocade for no other purpose than to be
 deaf and dumb. If instead of having an iron heart set on the Buddha he
 had been any ordinary man susceptible to wine and women he would never
 have succeeded in fetching the scriptures.</P>
<P>When they reached the entrance to the garden the evil spirit
 whispered seductively, &#8220;My wonderful darling, let's have some fun
 here&#8212;it'll cheer you up.&#8221; They went into the garden hand in hand, and
 when he looked up he saw that it was indeed a splendid place. This is
 what could be seen:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>All over the winding paths</P>
<P>Bluish lichens grow.</P>
<P>Secluded gauze windows</P>
<P>Kept dark by embroidered curtains.</P>
<P>When the breeze arises</P>
<P>Silks and brocades float in the air.</P>
<P>When the gentle rain stops falling</P>
<P>The smooth white skin and jade-like flesh are revealed.</P>
<P>The sun-scorched apricot</P>
<P>Is red as an immortal's rainbow clothes spread out to dry;</P>
<P>The plantain in the moonlight</P>
<P>Is bluer than Lady Taizhen waving her feather fan.</P>
<P>Whitewashed walls enclose</P>
<P>The golden orioles that sing in ten thousand willows.</P>
<P>Within the empty halls</P>
<P>Butterflies flit among begonias in the courtyard.</P>
<P>Look at the Hall of Crystallized Perfumes,</P>
<P>The Green Moth Hall,</P>
<P>The Hall to Recover from Drunkenness,</P>
<P>The Hall of Longing,</P>
<P>Rolling up the brilliance, one behind the other.</P>
<P>On the red curtains</P>
<P>Hooks hold tassels like prawn whiskers.</P>
<P>Now look at the Pavilion to Ease Pain</P>
<P>The Pavilion of Simplicity,</P>
<P>The Pavilion of Thrushes,</P>
<P>The Four Rains Pavilion,</P>
<P>All towering and lofty,</P>
<P>And bearing on decorated tablets</P>
<P>Their names in archaic script.</P>
<P>Look too at the Pool Where Cranes Bathe,</P>
<P>The Goblet-washing Pool,</P>
<P>The Pool of Delight in the Moon,</P>
<P>The Pool for Cleansing Tassels,</P>
<P>Where amid duckweed and algae the gold scales shine.</P>
<P>Then there is the Kiosk of Ink Flowers,</P>
<P>The Kiosk of Strange Boxes,</P>
<P>The Interesting Kiosk,</P>
<P>The Kiosk for Admiring the Clouds</P>
<P>Where bubbles like green ants float on the wine in jade ladles and
 goblets.</P>
<P>Around the pools and pavilions</P>
<P>Stand rocks from Lake Taihu,</P>
<P>Rocks of purple crystal,</P>
<P>Yingluo rocks,</P>
<P>Jin River rocks,</P>
<P>Greenish and overgrown with tiger-whisker rushes.</P>
<P>East and West of the kiosks and balls are found</P>
<P>A Wooden Mountain,</P>
<P>A Turquoise Screen Mountain,</P>
<P>A Howling Wind Mountain,</P>
<P>A Jade Mushroom Mountain,</P>
<P>All covered in phoenix-tail bamboo.</P>
<P>Trellises of briar roses,</P>
<P>And garden roses,</P>
<P>Growing by a swing,</P>
<P>As a curtain of silk and brocade.</P>
<P>A Pine Pavilion,</P>
<P>A Magnolia Pavilion,</P>
<P>Opposite a Saussurea Pavilion,</P>
<P>Forming a wall of jade with embroidered hangings.</P>
<P>Herbaceous and tree peonies are rivals in luxuriance;</P>
<P>The night-closing magnolias and the jasmine</P>
<P>Are charming every year.</P>
<P>Moist with dewdrops are the purple buds:</P>
<P>They ought to be painted or drawn.</P>
<P>The red hibiscus fills the sky with flaming splendor,</P>
<P>A marvellous subject for poetry.</P>
<P>When it comes to fine scenery</P>
<P>This makes Lang Garden or Penglai not worth a mention;</P>
<P>And as for the flowers,</P>
<P>The finest peonies of Luoyang count for nothing beside them.</P>
<P>In the battle of the blossoms late in the spring</P>
<P>The garden lacks only the flowers of jade.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The venerable elder led the she-devil by the hand as they strolled in
 the garden, admiring the endless displays of rare and exotic blooms. As
 they went through many a hall and pavilion he really did seem to be
 going into an exquisite place. Looking up, he realized that he was by
 the peach grove. Monkey pinched his master's head to remind him.</P>
<P>Flying to a branch of a peach tree Brother Monkey shook himself and
 turned into a red peach, and a most fetchingly red one at that. &#8220;Lady,&#8221;
 the venerable elder said to the evil spirit, &#8220;what beautifully scented
 flowers and ripe fruit you have in this garden.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The blooms are so fragrant bees vie for their nectar;</P>
<P>The birds all compete for the fruit on the branches.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Why are some of the peaches on the trees red and some green?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If there were no Yin and Yang in the heavens the sun and moon would
 not be bright,&#8221; the evil spirit replied with a smile. &#8220;If there were no
 Yin and Yang in the earth the plants and trees would not grow. And if
 there were no Yin and Yang among people there would be no sexual
 difference. The peaches on the Southern Yang side of these trees are
 red because they ripen first in the sun's heat. The peaches on the
 Northern Yin side are green because they get no sun and are still
 unripe. It's all because of the Yin and the Yang.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Thank you, lady, for your explanation,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;I did not
 know that.&#8221; He then reached out and picked a red peach, while the evil
 spirit also picked a green one.</P>
<P>Sanzang bowed as he handed the red one respectfully to the evil
 spirit with the words, &#8220;Lady, you love what is attractive, so won't you
 take this red peach and give me the green one?&#8221;</P>
<P>The she-devil made the exchange, thinking with concealed delight,
 &#8220;What a nice monk. He really is a good man. He is being so loving to me
 even before we're man and wife.&#8221; With great pleasure she paid him her
 affectionate respects. As the Tang Priest started to eat the green
 peach at once the evil spirit was delighted to do likewise, opening her
 mouth to bite into the red one. When she parted her red lips and
 revealed her silver teeth the impatient Monkey did not give her time to
 bite him but rolled straight down her throat into her stomach.</P>
<P>&#8220;Reverend gentleman,&#8221; the terrified evil spirit said, &#8220;that peach is
 a terror. Why did it roll straight down and not let me bite it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Lady,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;the first ripe fruits of a garden are very
 delicious. That is why it went down so fast.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But it shot straight down before I'd had time to spit the stone
 out,&#8221; the evil spirit replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Because you are such a lover of what is fine and beautiful and
 enjoyed it so much,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;you swallowed it before you could
 bring the stone out.&#8221;</P>
<P>Once inside her stomach Monkey turned back into himself. &#8220;Master,&#8221; he
 called, &#8220;no need to argue with her now. I've succeeded.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be too hard on her, disciple,&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Who are you talking to?&#8221; the evil spirit asked when she heard this.
 &#8220;I am talking to my disciple Sun Wukong,&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221; the evil spirit asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;In your stomach,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;He was the red peach you have
 just eaten.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's the end of me,&#8221; exclaimed the evil spirit in horror. &#8220;If that
 ape's got into my stomach I'm dead. Sun the Novice, why did you go to
 such lengths to get into my stomach?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No particular reason,&#8221; replied Monkey from inside her. &#8220;I just
 wanted to eat the six leaves of your liver and your lungs, and your
 heart with its three hairs and seven apertures. I'm going to clean your
 insides right out and leave you a skeleton spirit.&#8221;</P>
<P>This sent the evil spirit's souls scattering in terror and shivering
 and shaking she clung tightly to the Tang Priest and said, &#8220;Reverend
 gentleman, I had thought that</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Our destinies were from former lives joined by a red thread;</P>
<P>Our love was as close as the water and the fish.</P>
<P>I never imagined that we lovebirds would be parted</P>
<P>Or that the phoenixes would fly to East and West.</P>
<P>When the waters rose under Lan Bridge the rendezvous failed;</P>
<P>The meeting came to nothing in the misty temple.</P>
<P>After brief joy we are parted once more;</P>
<P>In whatever year will I meet you again?&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard all this from inside her stomach he was afraid that
 the venerable elder would have another attack of benevolence and let
 her talk her way out of the problem. Thereupon he started to wield fist
 and foot, striking out in martial postures and leveling everything
 around him. He punched her stomach almost to ribbons. Unable to bear
 the pain, the evil spirit collapsed in the dust, not daring to utter a
 single word for some time. As she was not speaking Monkey imagined that
 she must be dead and eased off.</P>
<P>She then recovered her breath to some extent and called out, &#8220;Where
 are you, little ones?&#8221; Now once in the garden, the creatures had all
 had the understanding to go off picking flowers, playing in the grass
 and amusing themselves, leaving the she-devil alone with the Tang
 Priest for a romantic conversation. As soon as they heard her calling
 they rushed over to see the evil spirit lying on the ground, her face a
 terrible color as she groaned, unable to move.</P>
<P>They hurriedly helped her up, crowding round and asking, &#8220;What's
 wrong, madam? Have you had a heart attack?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; the evil spirit replied. &#8220;Don't ask any questions. I've got
 someone inside me. Take the monk outside if you want to save my life.&#8221;</P>
<P>The junior devils actually did start to carry the Tang Priest, at
 which Monkey yelled from inside her belly, &#8220;Don't any of you dare carry
 him. You must take my master out yourself. I'll only spare your life
 when you've carried him outside.&#8221;</P>
<P>This left the evil spirit with no choice as all she cared about was
 saving her skin. At once she struggled to her feet, lifted the Tang
 Priest on her back and headed outside, followed by the junior devils
 asking, &#8220;Where are you going, Madam?&#8221;</P>
<P>To this the evil spirit replied,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;'As long as the lakes and the bright moon remain</P>
<P>I'll surely find somewhere to put my golden hook.'</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Once I've taken this wretch outside I'll find myself another man.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid evil spirit went straight by cloud to the mouth of the
 cave, where the clang of weapons and wild shouts could be heard.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;why can I hear weapons outside?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's Pig rubbing his rake,&#8221; replied Monkey. &#8220;Give him a shout.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Bajie,&#8221; Sanzang shouted.</P>
<P>&#8220;Friar Sand,&#8221; said Pig when he heard this, &#8220;the master's out.&#8221; The
 two of them drew back their rake and staff, letting the evil spirit
 carry the Tang Priest out. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Mind Ape had subdued a monster from the inside;</P>
<P>The Earth and Wood door guards welcomed the holy monk.</P>

</B>
<P>The story tells how after Sanzang had been carried out of the cave by
 the evil spirit Friar Sand went up to him and asked, &#8220;Where is my
 oldest brother now that you have come out, Master?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He must know what he's doing,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;I expect he's exchanged
 himself for the master to get him out.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your brother is in her stomach,&#8221; Sanzang replied, pointing at the
 evil spirit.</P>
<P>&#8220;It is terribly filthy,&#8221; Pig said. &#8220;Whatever are you doing in there?
 Come out.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Open your mouth,&#8221; said Monkey from inside, &#8220;I'm coming out.&#8221; The
 she-devil did indeed open her mouth wide. Monkey made himself very
 small, sprang up into her throat, and was just about to emerge when he
 became worried that she might cheat and bite him. He then pulled out
 his iron cudgel, blew on it with magic breath, called &#8220;Change!&#8221; and
 turned it into a jujube stone with which he wedged her jaw open. With
 one bound he then leapt outside, taking the iron cudgel with him, bowed
 to resume his own form and raised his cudgel to strike her. At once she
 drew a pair of fine swords, parrying his blow with a loud clang. They
 fought a splendid battle on the mountain top.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A pair of dancing, flying swords defended her face;</P>
<P>The gold-banded cudgel struck at her head.</P>
<P>One was a heaven-born monkey, the Mind-ape;</P>
<P>The other had the bones of an earth-born girl turned spirit;</P>
<P>The two of them both had been smitten by anger:</P>
<P>Hatred arose at the celebration; the party was ended.</P>
<P>One longed to mate with the primal masculinity,</P>
<P>The other wanted to defeat the incarnation of the female.</P>
<P>When the cudgel was raised to the sky cold mists spread out;</P>
<P>The swords shook up the earth's black dirt like a sieve.</P>
<P>Because the elder would visit the Buddha</P>
<P>They were locked in fierce combat, each showing great prowess.</P>
<P>When water conflicts with fire motherhood is out;</P>
<P>When Yin and Yang cannot combine each goes its own way.</P>
<P>After the two had been fighting for a very long time</P>
<P>The earth moved, the mountains shook and the trees were destroyed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The sight of their struggle made Pig grumble resentfully about
 Monkey. &#8220;Brother,&#8221; he said, turning to Friar Sand, &#8220;our elder brother
 is messing around. When he was in her stomach just now he could have
 used his fists to make her belly red with blood, rip it open and come
 out. That would have settled her score. Why did he have to come out
 through her mouth and fight her? Why did he let her run wild?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right,&#8221; Friar Sand replied, &#8220;but it was thanks to him that
 the master was rescued from the depths of the cave, even if he is in a
 fight with her now. Let's ask the master to sit here by himself while
 we two use our weapons to help our brother beat the evil spirit.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; said Pig with a wave of his hand. &#8220;He's got his magic
 powers. We'd be useless.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a thing to say,&#8221; retorted Friar Sand. &#8220;This is in all of our
 interests. We may not be much use, but even a fart can strengthen a
 breeze.&#8221;</P>
<P>Now that the idiot's dander was up he brandished his rake and
 shouted, &#8220;Come on!&#8221; Ignoring the master, they rode the wind and went
 for the evil spirit, striking wildly at her with their rake and staff.
 The evil spirit, who was already finding Brother Monkey too much to
 handle, realized that she would be unable to hold out against two more
 of them. At once she turned and fled.</P>
<P>&#8220;After her, brothers,&#8221; Monkey shouted. Seeing that they were so hot
 on her heels the evil spirit took the embroidered shoe off her right
 foot, blew on it with a magic breath, said a spell, called &#8220;Change!&#8221;
 and turned it into her own double swinging a pair of sword. Then she
 shook herself, turned into a puff of wind and went straight back. There
 she was, fleeing for her life because she was no match for them. What
 happened next was quite unexpected: Sanzang's evil star had still not
 gone away. As the evil spirit reached the archway in front of the
 entrance to the cave she saw the Tang Priest sitting there by himself,
 so she went up to him, threw her arm round him, grabbed the luggage,
 bit through the bridle, and carried him back inside, horse and all.</P>
<P>The story tells not of her but of Pig, who exploited an opening to
 fell the evil spirit with one blow of his rake, only to find that she
 was really an embroidered shoe.</P>
<P>&#8220;You pair of idiots,&#8221; said Monkey when he saw it. &#8220;You should have
 been looking after the master. Nobody asked you to help.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What about that, then, Friar Sand?&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;I said we shouldn't
 come here. That ape has had a brainstorm. We beat the monster for him
 and he gets angry with us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Beaten the monster indeed!&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;The monster fooled me
 yesterday by leaving a shoe behind when I was fighting her. Goodness
 knows how the master is now that you've left him. Let's go straight
 back and see.&#8221;</P>
<P>The three of them hurried back to find that the master had
 disappeared: there was no sign at all of him, the luggage or the white
 horse. Pig started rushing all over the place in a panic with Friar
 Sand searching alongside him. The Great Sage Sun was also most anxious.
 As he searched he noticed half of the bridle rope lying askew beside
 the path.</P>
<P>Picking it up, he could not hold back his tears as he called in a
 loud voice, &#8220;Master! When I went I took my leave of you three and the
 horse, and all I find on my return is this rope.&#8221; It was indeed a case
 of</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Being reminded of the steed by seeing the saddle,</P>
<P>Missing the beloved amid one's tears.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The sight of Monkey's tears gave Pig an uncontrollable urge to throw
 back his head and laugh out loud. &#8220;Blockhead,&#8221; said Monkey abusively.
 &#8220;Do you want us to break up again?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's not what I mean,&#8221; said Pig, still laughing. &#8220;The master's
 been carried back into the cave. As the saying goes, 'third time
 lucky'. You've already been into the cave twice, so if you go in again
 you're sure to rescue the master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well then,&#8221; said Monkey, wiping away his tears, &#8220;as this is the
 way things are I have no choice. I'll have to go back in. You two don't
 have to worry about the luggage or the horse any more, so guard the
 cave-mouth properly.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage turned round and sprang into the cave. This
 time he did no transformations but appeared in his own dharma form.
 This is what he was like:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>His cheeks looked strange but his heart was strong;</P>
<P>As a monster since childhood his magic was mighty.</P>
<P>A misshapen face that looked like a saddle;</P>
<P>Eyes fiery bright with golden light.</P>
<P>His hairs were harder than needles of steel,</P>
<P>And striking was the pattern of his tigerskin kilt.</P>
<P>In the sky he could scatter a myriad clouds;</P>
<P>In the sea he could stir up thousandfold waves.</P>
<P>Once with his strength he fought heavenly kings,</P>
<P>Putting a hundred and eight thousand warriors to flight.</P>
<P>His title was Great Sage Equaling Heaven;</P>
<P>He was an expert with the gold-banded cudgel.</P>
<P>Today in the West he was using his powers</P>
<P>To return to the cave and rescue Sanzang.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Watch Monkey as he stops his cloud and heads straight for the evil
 spirit's residence, where he found the gates under the gate towers
 shut. Not caring whether or not it was the right thing to do, he
 smashed them open with one swing of his cudgel and charged inside. It
 was completely quiet and deserted, and the Tang Priest was nowhere to
 be seen in the corridor. The tables and chairs in the pavilion and all
 the utensils had completely disappeared. As the cave measured over a
 hundred miles around, the evil spirit had very many hiding places in
 it. This was where she had brought the Tang Priest the previous time,
 only to be found by Monkey, so after catching him this time she had
 moved him elsewhere in case Monkey came looking for him again.</P>
<P>Not knowing where they had gone, Monkey stamped his foot and beat his
 chest with fury, letting himself call out at the top of his voice,
 &#8220;Master! You are a Tang Sanzang formed in misfortune, a pilgrim monk
 molded from disaster. Hmm. I know the way well enough. Why isn't he
 here? Where should I look for him?&#8221;</P>
<P>Just when he was howling with impatience and anxiety his nose was
 struck by a whiff of incense, which brought him back to himself. &#8220;This
 incense smoke is coming from the back,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;so I suppose they
 must be there.&#8221; He strode in at the back, his cudgel in his hand, but
 still saw no sign of life. What he did see were three side rooms. Near
 the back wall was a lacquered offertory table carved with dragons on
 which stood a gilt incense-burner. From this came heavily scented
 incense smoke. On the table was a tablet inscribed with letters of gold
 to which the offerings were being made. The letters read, &#8220;Honoured
 Father, Heavenly King Li.&#8221; In a slightly inferior position was written,
 &#8220;Honoured Elder Brother, Third Prince Nezha.&#8221;</P>
<P>The sight filled Monkey with delight. He stopped searching for the
 monster and the Tang Priest, rubbed his cudgel between his fingers to
 make it as small as an embroidery needle, tucked it inside his ear,
 gathered up the tablet and the incense-burner with a sweep of his arms
 and went straight back out through the gates on his clouds. He was
 still chortling with glee when he reached the mouth of the cave.</P>
<P>When Pig and Friar Sand heard him they unblocked the entrance to the
 cave and greeted him with, &#8220;You look so happy you must have saved the
 master, elder brother.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No need for us to save him,&#8221; Monkey replied with a smile. &#8220;We can
 ask this tablet for him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But that tablet isn't an evil spirit and it can't talk,&#8221; said Pig,
 &#8220;so how can you ask it for him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Look at it,&#8221; said Monkey, putting the tablet on the ground. When
 Friar Sand went up to look he saw &#8220;Honoured Father, Heavenly King Li&quot;
 and &#8220;Honoured Elder Brother, Third Prince Nezha&#8221; written on it.</P>
<P>&#8220;What does this mean?&#8221; Friar Sand asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The evil spirit makes offerings to it,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;When I
 charged into her place there was nobody about, only this tablet. I
 think she must be a daughter of Heavenly King Li and the younger sister
 of Prince Nezha who so longed for the lower world that she pretended to
 be an evil spirit and carried our master off. So who better to demand
 the master from? You two keep guard here while I take this tablet up to
 Heaven to lodge a complaint with the Jade Emperor and force those
 heavenly kings to give our master back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;there's a saying that goes, 'Bring a capital
 charge and pay for it with your own head.' You can only do a thing like
 that if you're in the right. Besides, a case in the celestial court
 isn't something to be started lightly. You'd better tell me what sort
 of case you're going to bring.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I know what I'm going to do,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;I'm going to produce
 this tablet and incense-burner as evidence and submit a written
 deposition too.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What will you write in your deposition?&#8221; Pig asked him. &#8220;Will you
 tell me?&#8221;</P>
<P>To this Brother Monkey replied, &#8220;The complainant Sun Wukong, whose
 age is stated in this document, is the disciple of the monk Tang
 Sanzang who is going from the Tang court in the East to fetch the
 scriptures from the Western Heaven. He submits a complaint that an
 imitation evil spirit has committed a kidnap. Li Jing, the
 Pagoda-carrying Heavenly King, and his son Prince Nezha have been slack
 in controlling their women's quarters. He has allowed his daughter to
 run away and turn into an evil spirit in the Bottomless Cave in Mount
 Pitfall, where she has lured countless deluded people to their deaths.
 She has now carried my master into a remote corner where he cannot be
 found. If I had not submitted this complaint I would have been deeply
 worried that the heavenly king and his son in their wickedness had
 deliberately incited his daughter to become a spirit and cause general
 disaster. I beg Your Majesty in your mercy to summon the heavenly king
 to attend a hearing, bring the demon under control and deliver my
 master. I would be deeply grateful if Your Majesty would determine the
 correct penalty for this offence. This is my respectful submission.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Pig and Friar Sand heard this they said with delight, &#8220;Brother,
 you're bound to win if you submit so reasonable a complaint. Be as
 quick as you can. If you lose any time you may be too late to stop the
 evil spirit killing our master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll hurry,&#8221; said Brother Monkey, &#8220;I'll hurry. I'll be back in the
 time it takes to cook rice at the longest or to make a cup of tea if
 I'm quick.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>With one bound the splendid Great Sage carried the tablet and the
 incense-burner straight up by auspicious cloud to the outside of the
 Southern Gate of Heaven, where the Heavenly Kings Powerful and
 Protector of the Nation greeted him with bows, letting him in and not
 daring to block his way.</P>
<P>He went straight to the Hall of Universal Radiance, where the four
 heavenly teachers Zhang, Ge, Xu, and Qiu showed him great courtesy and
 asked, &#8220;Why are you here, Great Sage?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've got a complaint here,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;There are a couple of
 people I want to lodge a complaint against.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The scoundrel,&#8221; thought the appalled heavenly teachers, &#8220;who can he
 be wanting to sue?&#8221; They had no choice but to lead him to the Hall of
 Miraculous Mist and submit their report to the Jade Emperor, who
 ordered that Monkey be summoned hi. Monkey then put down the tablet and
 the incense-burner, bowed to the emperor, and presented his complaint.
 This was taken by the Ancient Immortal Ge, who spread it out on the
 emperor's table. When the emperor had read it through from the
 beginning and learned what had happened he approved the deposition,
 wrote an imperial rescript on it, and sent the Great White Planet, the
 Metal Planet Changgeng, to the Cloud Tower Palace to summon the
 Pagoda-carrying Heavenly King Li to the imperial presence.</P>
<P>Monkey then stepped forward and submitted this memorial: &#8220;I beg that
 the Heavenly Sovereign will punish him effectively as otherwise there
 will be further trouble.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Let the complainant go too,&#8221; the Jade Emperor ordered.</P>
<P>&#8220;What, me?&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;His Majesty has issued his decree,&#8221; said the Four Heavenly Teachers,
 &#8220;so you go with the Metal Planet.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey then went with the planet by cloud. They were soon at the
 Cloud Tower Palace, the residence of the heavenly king. The Metal Star
 saw a page standing at the palace gates.</P>
<P>Recognizing the planet, the boy went inside to report, &#8220;The Great
 White Planet is here.&#8221;</P>
<P>The heavenly king then came out to welcome the planet. Seeing that
 the planet was carrying a decree from the Jade Emperor, the heavenly
 king ordered incense to be burned before turning round and seeing to
 his fury that Monkey had come too. Why do you think he was furious?
 When Monkey had made great havoc in heaven all those years earlier the
 Jade Emperor had appointed the heavenly king as Demon-quelling High
 Marshal and Prince Nezha as Great God of the Three Altars of the Seas
 to lead the heavenly troops and subdue Monkey. They had been repeatedly
 worsted in battle. It was resentment at this defeat five hundred years
 earlier that goaded him to fury.</P>
<P>&#8220;Old Changgeng,&#8221; he said to the planet, showing his irritation, &#8220;what
 kind of decree have you brought here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It is a case that the Great Sage Sun has brought against you,&#8221; the
 planet replied.</P>
<P>The heavenly king had been in a bad enough temper before this, but
 the word &#8220;case&#8221; provoked a thunderous outburst of fury: &#8220;What case has
 he got against me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He accuses you of masquerading as an evil spirit and kidnapping,&#8221;
 the planet said. &#8220;Will you please burn incense and read it for
 yourself.&#8221;</P>
<P>Seething with anger, the heavenly king had an incense table set up,
 looked into the sky as he thanked the emperor for his grace, made his
 obeisances, opened out the decree and read it through.</P>
<P>When he saw what it contained he thumped the incense table and
 exclaimed, &#8220;That ape has trumped up a pack of lies.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please keep your temper,&#8221; the planet replied. &#8220;A tablet and an
 incense-burner have been submitted to His Majesty as evidence. He says
 it was your daughter who did it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;All I have are my three sons and a single daughter,&#8221; said the
 heavenly king. &#8220;My elder son Jinzha serves the Tathagata Buddha as a
 Vanguard Guardian of the Law Dharma. My second son Moksa is a disciple
 of Guanyin in the Southern Ocean. My third son Nezha stays with me as
 my escort at all times. My daughter Zhenying is only six and an
 innocent child. She could not possibly have become an evil spirit. If
 you don't believe me I'll carry her out to show you. This ape is really
 a disgrace. Never mind that I'm one of the most distinguished elder
 statesmen in heaven and been given the authority to cut heads off
 before reporting to the throne: not even an ordinary commoner in the
 lower world should be falsely accused. As the Legal Code says, 'the
 penalty for false accusation is three grades higher than the crime
 alleged.'&#8221;</P>
<P>He then ordered his underlings to fetch demon-binding rope and tie
 Monkey up. The Mighty Miracle God, General Fishbelly and General Yaksha
 who were drawn up outside the court rushed on Monkey and tied him up.</P>
<P>&#8220;Heavenly King Li,&#8221; the Metal Planet pleaded, &#8220;please don't invite
 disaster. I have come here with him from the imperial presence under
 orders from His Majesty to summon you. That rope of yours is heavy, and
 it could very quickly hurt him badly or strangle him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Metal Star,&#8221; the heavenly king replies, &#8220;there's no way I'm going to
 stand for his false, trumped-up charge. Won't you take a seat while I
 fetch my demon-hacking sword to kill this ape with? I'll report to His
 Majesty with you after I've done that.&#8221; At the sight of the heavenly
 king fetching the sword the planet trembled with terror.</P>
<P>&#8220;You've made a terrible mistake,&#8221; he said to Monkey. &#8220;A case before
 the emperor isn't to be lightly started. You've brought this disaster
 on yourself by not finding the facts out properly and you'll die for
 it. This is terrible.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey was completely unafraid. &#8220;Don't worry, old man,&#8221; he said with
 a chuckle, &#8220;this is nothing. This has always been my way of doing
 business: I lose out at first and win in the end.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before the words were all out of his mouth the heavenly king's sword
 swung down towards Monkey's head. But Prince Nezha was already in front
 of Monkey, parrying the blow with his great sword used for cutting men
 in half at the waist and calling, &#8220;Please calm your temper, father.&#8221;</P>
<P>This greatly shocked the heavenly king. Very strange! If a son used
 his broadsword to block his father's cutlass he ought to be bawled out,
 so why did Nezha's father turn pale with shock?</P>
<P>Now when this son had been born to the heavenly king the word<I> Ne</I>
 was written on the palm of his left hand and<I> Zha</I> on his right
 one, which was why he was called Nezha. When only three days old the
 young prince had caused great trouble by plunging into the sea to clean
 himself. He had kicked the water crystal palace down, captured a dragon
 and insisted on pulling its sinews out to make a belt. On learning
 about this, the heavenly king had been so worried about the disastrous
 consequences that he had decided to kill the boy.</P>
<P>This had made Nezha so indignant that he had seized a sword, cut off
 his flesh and returned it to his mother, then picked his bones clean
 and given them back to his father. Having returned his father's seed
 and his mother's blood he had taken his soul straight off to the
 Western Paradise to appeal to the Buddha. When the Buddha, who was
 expounding the sutras to all the Bodhisattvas, heard a call of &#8220;Help!&#8221;
 from within his curtained and jeweled canopy he had looked with his
 wise eyes and seen that it was Nezha's soul. He had made Nezha bones
 out of green lotus root and clothes from lotus leaves, then recited the
 spell to revive the dead.</P>
<P>Thus it was that Nezha had come back to life. He had used his divine
 ability and great magical powers to subdue ninety-six caves of demons
 through dharma. After this Nezha had wanted to kill his father in
 revenge for having had to pick the flesh off his own bones, leaving the
 heavenly king with no choice but to beg the help of the Tathagata
 Buddha. For the sake of harmony the Buddha had given the heavenly king
 an intricately-made golden As-You-Will reliquary pagoda, in each story
 of which were Buddhas radiant with splendor. The Buddha called on Nezha
 to regard these Buddhas as his father, thereby ending the hatred
 between them. This is why Heavenly King Li is called the Pagoda-bearer.
 As the heavenly king was at home off duty that day and not carrying the
 pagoda he was afraid that Nezha was set on revenge. This was why he
 turned pale with terror.</P>
<P>So he turned his hand back to take the golden pagoda from its stand
 and hold it as he asked Nezha, &#8220;What do you want to say to me, son? Why
 have you parried my sword with your broadsword?&#8221;</P>
<P>Throwing his broadsword down, Nezha kowtowed to his father as he
 replied, &#8220;Father, Your Majesty, there is a daughter of our family in
 the lower world.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My boy,&#8221; the heavenly king replied, &#8220;I have only had you four
 children. Where could I have got another daughter from?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You have forgotten, Your Majesty,&#8221; Nezha replied. &#8220;The girl was once
 an evil spirit. Three hundred years ago she became a monster. She stole
 and ate some of the Tathagata's incense, flowers and candles on Vulture
 Peak, and the Tathagata sent us to capture her with heavenly soldiers.
 When she was caught she should have been beaten to death, but the
 Tathagata said,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>'Raise fish in deep water but never catch them;</P>
<P>Feed deer in the depths of the mountains in the hope of eternal
 life.'</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>So we spared her life. In her gratitude she bowed to you as her
 adoptive father, Your Majesty, and to me as her elder brother. She set
 up a tablet to us in the lower world to burn incense. I never imagined
 she'd become an evil spirit again and try to ruin the Tang Priest. Now
 Sun the Novice has trailed her to her den and brought the tablet up
 here to use in a case against us before the Jade Emperor. She is your
 adopted daughter, not my real sister.&#8221;</P>
<P>This came as a terrible shock to the heavenly king. &#8220;Son,&#8221; he said,
 &#8220;I really had forgotten. What's she called?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;She has three names,&#8221; the prince replied. Where she originally came
 from she was called Gold-nosed White-haired Mouse Spirit. Then she was
 called Half-Bodhisattva-Guanyin because she had stolen the incense,
 flowers and candles. When she was forgiven and sent down to the lower
 world she changed her name again and became Lady Earth-gusher.&#8221; Only
 then did the heavenly king come to his senses. He put his pagoda down
 and started to untie Monkey himself. At this Monkey started playing it
 up.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't you dare try to untie me!&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you want to do
 something you can carry me roped up as I am to see the emperor. Then
 I'll win my case.&#8221; The heavenly king felt weak from terror and the
 prince could say nothing. Everybody fell back.</P>
<P>The Great Sage meanwhile was rolling about and playing it up,
 insisting that the heavenly king take him to the emperor. The heavenly
 king could do nothing except beg the Metal Planet to put in a good word
 for him.</P>
<P>&#8220;There is an old saying,&#8221; the planet replied, &#8220;that one should always
 be lenient. You went too far: you tied him up and were going to kill
 him. The monkey is a notorious trouble-maker. How do you expect me to
 deal with him? From what your worthy son has said, she is your
 daughter, even though adopted rather than your own, and a child by
 adoption is especially dear. However one argues it you are guilty.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Surely you can find some way of putting in a good word for me and
 helping me off the hook, venerable planet,&#8221; said the heavenly king.</P>
<P>&#8220;I would like to end the quarrel between you,&#8221; the planet replied,
 &#8220;but I have never done him a good turn that I can remind him of.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Tell him how it was you who proposed that he should be amnestied and
 given an official post,&#8221; said the heavenly king.</P>
<P>The Metal Planet did then step forward, stroke Brother Monkey and
 say, &#8220;Great Sage, won't you let us take the rope off before going to
 see the emperor, just for my sake?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No need to bother, old man,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;I'm a good roller and
 I can roll all the way there.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've got no decent feelings, you monkey,&#8221; said the planet with a
 smile. &#8220;I did you some good turns in the old days, but you won't do
 this little thing for me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What good turn did you ever do me?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;When you were a monster on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit you
 subdued tigers and dragons, forcibly removed yourself from the register
 of death and assembled hordes of fiends to run wild and wreak havoc.
 Heaven wanted to have you arrested. It was only because I made strong
 representations that an edict of amnesty and recruitment was issued and
 you were summoned to Heaven to be appointed Protector of the Horses.
 You drank some of the Jade Emperor's wine of immortality, and it was
 only because I made strong representations again that you were given
 the title of Great Sage Equaling Heaven. But you refused to know your
 place. You stole the peaches and the wine and robbed Lord Lao Zi of his
 elixir, and so it went on till you ended up in a state of no death and
 no birth. If it hadn't been for me you'd never have got where you are
 today.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As the ancients put it,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;'Don't even share a grave
 with an old man when you're dead: all he'll do is complain.' I was just
 a Protector of the Horses who made havoc in the heavenly palace: there
 was nothing much apart from that. Oh well, never mind. I'll show you a
 bit of consideration as you're such an old man. He can untie me
 himself.&#8221; Only then did the heavenly king dare step forward, untie the
 rope, and ask Brother Monkey to dress and take the seat of honour while
 they all took it in turn to pay their respects to him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Old man,&#8221; Monkey said to the Metal Planet, &#8220;what about it then? I
 told you I lose first and win later. That's my way of doing business.
 Make him hurry and see the emperor: delay could be disastrous for my
 master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be impatient,&#8221; the Metal Planet said. &#8220;After everything that's
 happened we should take a cup of tea.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you drink his tea, accept favours from him, take a bribe to let a
 criminal escape, and treat imperial edicts with disrespect I wonder
 what you'll be charged with,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;I won't stop for tea,&#8221; the Metal Planet replied, &#8220;I won't stop for
 tea. You're even trying to frame me. Hurry up, Heavenly King Li, we
 must be on our way.&#8221; The heavenly king dared not go for fear that
 Monkey would concoct some unfounded story and start playing it up: if
 Monkey started talking wildly he would be unable to argue against him.
 So once again the heavenly king pleaded with the Metal Planet to put in
 a good word for him.</P>
<P>&#8220;I have a suggestion to make,&#8221; the planet said to Monkey. &#8220;Will you
 follow it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've already agreed about being tied up and hacked at,&#8221; Monkey
 replied. &#8220;What else have you to say? Tell me! Tell me! If it's a good
 idea I'll follow it; and if it isn't, don't blame me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;'Fight a lawsuit for one day and it'll go on for ten,'&#8220; said the
 Metal Planet. &#8220;You brought a case before the emperor saying that the
 evil spirit is the heavenly king's daughter and the heavenly king says
 she isn't. You two will argue endlessly in front of His Majesty, but I
 tell you that a day in heaven is a year in the lower world. In that
 year the evil spirit will have your master under her control in the
 cave, and she won't just have married him. By then there may have been
 a happy event and she may have had a little baby monk. Then your great
 enterprise will be ruined.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; thought Monkey, his head bowed, &#8220;when I left Pig and Friar
 Sand I said I'd be back in the time it takes to cook a meal at longest
 and at quickest before they could make a cup of tea. I've been ages
 already and it might be too late. Old man,&#8221; he said aloud, &#8220;I'll take
 your advice. How do we obey this imperial decree?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Have Heavenly King Li muster his troops and go down with you to
 subdue the demon,&#8221; the Metal Planet replied, &#8220;while I report back to
 the emperor.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What will you say?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll report that the plaintiff has absconded and that the defendant
 is therefore excused,&#8221; the planet replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;That's very fine,&#8221; said Monkey with a grin. &#8220;I show you
 consideration and you accuse me of absconding. Tell him to muster his
 troops and wait for me outside the Southern Gate of Heaven while you
 and I report back on our mission.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If he says anything when he's there I'll be accused of treason,&#8221;
 exclaimed the heavenly king with terror.</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you take me for?&#8221; asked Monkey. &#8220;I'm a real man. Once I've
 given my word a team of horses couldn't take it back. I'd never slander
 you.&#8221;</P>
<P>The heavenly king thanked Monkey, who went with the Metal Planet to
 report back on their mission, while the heavenly king mustered his
 heavenly troops and went straight to the outside of the Southern Gate
 of Heaven.</P>
<P>When the Metal Planet and Monkey had their audience with the Jade
 Emperor they said, &#8220;The person who has trapped the Tang Priest is the
 Golden-nosed White-haired Mouse turned spirit. She has fraudulently set
 up a tablet to the heavenly king and his son. As soon as he found out,
 the heavenly king mustered his troops to go and subdue the demon. We
 beg your Celestial Majesty to forgive him.&#8221;</P>
<P>Once the Jade Emperor knew what had happened he dropped the
 prosecution in his heavenly mercy. Monkey then went back on his cloud
 to the outside of the Southern Gate of Heaven, where he found the
 heavenly king and the prince waiting for him with their heavenly
 soldiers draw up on parade. The heavenly commanders met the Great Sage
 amid blustering winds and seething mists, then they all took their
 clouds straight down to Mount Pitfall.</P>
<P>Pig and Friar Sand were wide-eyed at the sight of the heavenly hosts
 coming down with Brother Monkey. Greeting the heavenly king with due
 courtesy, the idiot said, &#8220;We have put you to great trouble in coming
 here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't realize, Marshal Tian Peng,&#8221; the heavenly king replied,
 &#8220;that it was because my son and I accepted a joss-stick from her that
 the evil spirit in her wickedness captured your master. Please don't be
 angry with us for being so long. Is this Mount Pitfall? Where is the
 entrance to the cave?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I know the way very well by now,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;This cave is called
 the Bottomless Cave and it measures over a hundred miles around. The
 evil spirit has a great many holes in it. Last time my master was held
 in the gate tower with double eaves, but it's deadly quiet now. There's
 not even the shadow of a demon. I don't know where she's taken him to
 now.&#8221; To this the heavenly king replied,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;'No matter how many the tricks she may try</P>
<P>She'll never escape from the nets of the sky.'</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We'll think of something else when we get to the cave entrance.&#8221;</P>
<P>They all then started out, and after they had gone three or four
 miles they reached the great rock. &#8220;This is it,&#8221; Monkey said pointing
 at the entrance that was no larger than the mouth of a large jar.</P>
<P>&#8220;You'll never capture the tiger's cub unless you go into the tiger's
 lair,&#8221; observed the heavenly king. &#8220;Who dares go in first?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll go,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;No, I'll go first,&#8221; objected Prince Nezha. &#8220;I was the one the
 emperor ordered to capture the demon.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot then started acting tough, shouting, &#8220;It ought to be me
 first.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop that din,&#8221; said the heavenly king. &#8220;I'll decide. The Great Sage
 Sun and the prince will go down with the soldiers while we three hold
 the entrance. Then we'll have a coordinated action inside and outside,
 which will make it impossible for her to find her way up to heaven or
 go further underground. That will show her a bit of our powers.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; they all said in assent.</P>
<P>Watch as Monkey and Prince Nezha slip into the cave at the head of
 their troops. As they rode their clouds they looked around and saw that
 it really was a fine cave:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The pair of sun and moon as before;</P>
<P>A vista of rivers and hills like the other world.</P>
<P>Warm mists spread over pools and wells of pearl;</P>
<P>Much more there is to admire down here.</P>
<P>Crimson houses, painted halls,</P>
<P>Red cliffs, green fields,</P>
<P>Willows in the spring and lotos in the autumn;</P>
<P>A rare and splendid cave heaven.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>An instant later they brought their clouds to a halt and went
 straight to the mansion where the evil spirit had lived before. They
 went from gateway to gateway in their search, yelling and shouting as
 they went deeper and deeper inside, trying one place after the next.
 All the grass for a hundred miles was trampled away. But where was the
 evil spirit? Where was Sanzang?</P>
<P>&#8220;The wicked beast,&#8221; everyone was saying, &#8220;she must have got out of
 this cave ages ago. She'll be far away by now.&#8221; What they did not know
 was that down underneath a dark corner in the Southeast of the cave
 there was another, smaller cave, where behind a pair of tiny gates
 there was a tiny cottage with flowers growing in pots and a few canes
 of bamboo beside the eaves. The atmosphere was dark and heavy with
 fragrance. This was where the evil spirit had carried Sanzang and was
 going to force him to marry her. She was sure that Monkey would never
 find them; none of them realized that her union was fated to be
 thwarted.</P>
<P>The junior devils were jabbering away in a great crush when a bolder
 one among them stretched outside the cave for a look around only for
 her head to butt into a heavenly soldier, who shouted, &#8220;They're here!&#8221;
 At this Monkey flew into a rage, grasped the gold-banded cudgel and
 charged straight down in. The cave was tiny and all the demons from the
 big cave were in there, so that when Prince Nezha sent his heavenly
 soldiers crowding into the attack, not a single one of the demons could
 hide.</P>
<P>Monkey found the Tang Priest, the dragon horse and the baggage. The
 senior demon was at her wit's end. All she could do was to kowtow to
 Prince Nezha, begging him to spare her life.</P>
<P>&#8220;We are here to arrest you at the Jade Emperor's command,&#8221; Prince
 Nezha replied, &#8220;which is not something to be treated lightly. My father
 and I were nearly in terrible trouble because of you.&#8221;</P>
<P>He then shouted at the top of his voice, &#8220;Heavenly soldiers, fetch
 demon-binding rope. Tie all those evil spirits up.&#8221; The senior demon
 too had to suffer for a while. They all went back out of the cave
 together by cloud.</P>
<P>Monkey was chuckling with delight when the heavenly king withdrew his
 guard from the mouth of the cave and greeted Monkey with the words,
 &#8220;Now I can meet your master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Many thanks,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;many thanks,&#8221; and he led Sanzang to bow
 in gratitude to the heavenly king and the prince.</P>
<P>Friar Sand and Pig were all for chopping the senior devil into tiny
 pieces, but the heavenly king said, &#8220;She was arrested at the Jade
 Emperor's command, and must not be mistreated. We must go to report
 back on our mission.&#8221;</P>
<P>The heavenly king and Prince Nezha at the head of their heavenly
 troops and divine officers escorted the evil spirit as a prisoner to
 report to the heavenly court and receive the emperor's verdict on her.
 Meanwhile Brother Monkey guarded the Tang Priest while Friar Sand
 collected the luggage and Pig went over to the horse and invited the
 master to ride. Then they all set out along their way again. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The silken net had been cut, the golden sea dried up,</P>
<P>The precious lock undone, and troubles left behind.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you do not know what lay in store for them on their way ahead
 listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>
<B><I>
<P></P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="1_0_85">Chapter 84</A></H3>
</I>
<P>The Indestructible Proteges of the Buddha Complete Enlightenment</P>
<P>The Dharma King Comes to the Truth Through His Own Nature</P>
</B>
<P>The story tells how Tang Sanzang kept his masculine essence intact
 and escaped from the terrible snare of mist and flowers. As he headed
 Westwards with Brother Monkey he did not notice that it was already
 summer: warm breezes were beginning to blow, and the early summer rain
 was falling. It was a beautiful sight:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Dark is the shade under tender green;</P>
<P>In the gentle breeze the swallows lead their young.</P>
<P>New lotus leaves are opening on the ponds;</P>
<P>Elegant bamboo is gradually reviving.</P>
<P>The fragrant plants join their blue to the sky;</P>
<P>Mountain flowers carpet all the ground.</P>
<P>Beside the stream the rushes are like swords;</P>
<P>The fiery pomegranate blossom makes the picture even more
 magnificent.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As the master and his three disciples traveled along enduring the
 heat they suddenly noticed two rows of tall willows, from under the
 shade of which an old woman emerged, leaning on a small boy. &#8220;Don't go
 any further, monk,&#8221; she called out. &#8220;Stop your horse and go back East
 as soon as you can. The road West leads nowhere.&#8221;</P>
<P>This gave Sanzang so bad a fright that he sprang off the horse, made
 a gesture of greeting and said, &#8220;Venerable Bodhisattva, in the words of
 the ancients,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>'The sea's breadth allows the fish to leap;</P>
<P>The sky's emptiness lets birds fly.'</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>How could there possibly be no way to the West?&#8221; To this the old
 woman replied, pointing Westwards, &#8220;If you go that way you will come to
 the capital of Dharmadestructia in a couple of miles. The king formed a
 hatred of Buddhism in an earlier existence, and in his present life he
 is punishing it without just cause. Two years ago he made a monstrous
 vow to kill ten thousand Buddhist monks. In that time he's killed 9,996
 unknown monks in succession. He's just waiting for four famous monks to
 make up his ten thousand so that he will fulfil the vow. If you go into
 the city you will be throwing away your lives for nothing.&#8221;</P>
<P>At the sound of this Sanzang was so terrified that he shivered and
 shook as he replied, &#8220;Venerable Bodhisattva, I am deeply moved by your
 great kindness and infinitely grateful too. But, tell me, is there a
 suitable way I could take that does not go into the city?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no way round,&#8221; the old woman replied with a laugh, &#8220;no way
 round. The only way you'll get past it is if you can fly.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this Pig started shooting his mouth off from where he stood beside
 them: &#8220;Don't try to put us off. We can all fly.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey's fiery eyes with their golden pupils really could distinguish
 good from evil, and he saw that the old woman and the little boy on
 whom she was leaning were in fact the Bodhisattva Guanyin and the page
 Sudhana. He hastily flung himself to the ground and began to kowtow,
 calling out, &#8220;Bodhisattva, your disciple failed to welcome you. I'm
 sorry.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Bodhisattva then rose slowly on her multicolored cloud, so
 startling the venerable elder that his legs gave way under him and he
 kowtowed as he knelt there for all he was worth. Pig and Friar Sand
 also fell to their knees in alarm and kowtowed to heaven. A moment
 later she was heading straight back to the Southern Sea amid auspicious
 clouds.</P>
<P>Monkey then got up and supported his master as he said, &#8220;Get up
 please. The Bodhisattva's already gone back to her island.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; Sanzang said, &#8220;if you knew she was the Bodhisattva why did
 you not say so before?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You ask too many questions,&#8221; Monkey replied with a grin. &#8220;When I
 started kowtowing wasn't that early enough?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It was lucky the Bodhisattva told us that Dharmadestructia, where
 they kill monks, is ahead of us,&#8221; Pig and Friar Sand said to Monkey.
 &#8220;Whatever are we to do?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be afraid, idiot,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;We've come to no harm from
 any of the vicious demons and evil monsters we've met already or in the
 tigers' dens and dragons' pools we've been in. This is just a country
 of ordinary people. What's there to be so scared of? The only thing is
 that we can't stay here. It's getting late in the day and some of the
 villagers are coming back from market in the town. It will be no good
 if they see we're monks and raise a hue and cry. We'd better take the
 master away from the main road to some quiet and secluded spot where we
 can discuss things.&#8221; Sanzang accepted Monkey's suggestion and they
 slipped away from the main road to a hollow in the ground where they
 sat down.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you two look after the master while I turn
 myself into something and go into town to take a look around. I'll find
 a side road that we can get away along tonight.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;don't take this lightly. The royal law is
 implacable. You must be careful.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile, &#8220;don't worry. I can cope.&#8221;</P>
<P>This said, the Great Sage leapt whistling up into the air. It was
 very strange:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>No rope to hold on to above,</P>
<P>No pole to support him below.</P>
<P>Others are all like their parents,</P>
<P>But the weight of his bones was low.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As he stood in the clouds looking down he saw that the city was full
 of the most happy and auspicious atmosphere. &#8220;What a splendid place,&#8221;
 Monkey said. &#8220;Why are they trying to destroy the Dharma here?&#8221; He
 looked around for a while, and in the gathering dusk he saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Bright lights at the crossroads,</P>
<P>Incense and bells in the ninefold hall.</P>
<P>The seven brightest stars shone in the blue heavens,</P>
<P>And the travelers stopped moving in all eight directions.</P>
<P>From the army barracks</P>
<P>The painted bugle could just be heard;</P>
<P>In the drum tower</P>
<P>The copper water-clock began to drip.</P>
<P>All around the evening mists were dense;</P>
<P>Cold fog was thick in the markets.</P>
<P>Two by two the couples went to their beds</P>
<P>As the bright moon's disk was rising in the East.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;If I went down into the streets to look for our way with a face like
 this,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;anyone I saw would be sure I was a monk. I'd better
 change.&#8221; He made a spell with his hands, said the magic words, shook
 himself and turned into a moth, the sort that flies into the lantern:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A tiny body, a pair of delicate wings,</P>
<P>Who puts out the lamp and flies into the candle when seeking the
 light.</P>
<P>Formed by changing its own original body,</P>
<P>It makes its magic response in grass that's decaying.</P>
<P>Loving the burning light of the candle's flame,</P>
<P>Endlessly flying around it with never a pause,</P>
<P>The purple-clad moth with its scented wings drives off the fireflies;</P>
<P>What it likes best is the windless calm of the night.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Watch him as he flutters and flies straight to the main streets and
 the markets, keeping close to the eaves and the corners of the
 buildings he passes. As he was flying along he noticed an angled row of
 houses on a corner with a lantern hanging above each doorway.</P>
<P>&#8220;They must be celebrating the Lantern Festival here,&#8221; he thought.
 &#8220;Why else is that line of lighted lanterns there?&#8221; Stiffening his wings
 and flying up for a closer look, he saw that on a square lantern
 outside the middle house was written, &#8220;Accommodation for Commercial
 Travelers,&#8221; with &#8220;Wang the Second's Inn&#8221; beneath it. Only then did
 Monkey realize that this was an inn. Stretching his head forward for a
 closer look he saw eight or nine men inside who had all eaten their
 supper, taken off their clothes and hats, washed their hands and feet
 and gone to bed.</P>
<P>&#8220;The master will get through,&#8221; Monkey thought with secret delight.
 How did he know that? Because he was having a wicked idea: he would
 wait till they were all asleep, then steal their clothes and hats so
 that he and his companions could go into the city dressed as laymen.</P>
<P>Oh dear! This was one of those things that don't turn out as you want
 them to. While Monkey was still thinking about his plan Wang the Second
 went up to the merchants and said, &#8220;Please be vigilant, gentlemen. We
 have villains here as well as decent people. You must all be careful
 about your clothes and luggage.&#8221;</P>
<P>As you can imagine, the travelling merchants were all very vigilant,
 and the innkeeper's advice made them more cautious than ever. So they
 all got out of bed and said, &#8220;You're quite right, host. We travelers
 have a hard time. We're always worried that if there's some emergency
 when we're asleep we may not wake up; and if things go wrong we're in a
 mess. You'd better take all our clothes, hats and bags and look after
 them for us inside. Tomorrow morning you can give them back to us when
 we get up.&#8221;</P>
<P>Wang the Second then took all the clothes he could find into his own
 room. Monkey anxiously spread his wings, flew in there and landed on
 the hat stand, from where he saw Wang the Second take the lantern down
 from the door, lower the blinds, and shut the door and window. Only
 then did he go into his bedroom, undress and lie down.</P>
<P>Now Wang the Second had a wife and two children who were crying and
 making a noise, in no hurry to sleep. Wang's wife then started mending
 a torn piece of clothing, so that she too was still awake. &#8220;If I have
 to wait till that woman stops working and goes to sleep,&#8221; thought
 Monkey, &#8220;I'll be keeping the master waiting too.&#8221; He then started
 worrying that if he left it till much later the city gates would be
 shut, so he lost patience and flew down into the flame of the lamp. It
 was indeed a case of</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He was ready to die when he dived at the blaze,</P>
<P>And with brows scarred by fire to live out his days.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Having extinguished the lamp he shook himself and turned into a rat
 who gave a couple of squeaks, jumped down, grabbed hats and clothes and
 went outside. &#8220;Old man,&#8221; the woman said with alarm, &#8220;this is terrible.
 A rat's turned into a spirit.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he used another trick, blocking the doorway
 and yelling at the top of his voice, &#8220;That woman's talking nonsense,
 Wang the Second. Ignore her. I'm not a rat turned spirit. As a decent
 man I don't do underhanded things. I'm the Great Sage Equaling Heaven
 come down to earth to protect the Tang Priest while he goes to fetch
 the scriptures from the Western Heaven. I've come to borrow these
 clothes as a disguise for my master because your king is so wicked.
 I'll bring them back soon when we're out of the city.&#8221;</P>
<P>Once Wang the Second heard this he scrambled out of bed and started
 groping around the floor in the dark. He was in such a rush that when
 he got hold of his trousers he thought they were his shirt: there was
 no way he could put them on no matter how he tried.</P>
<P>By now the Great Sage had used lifting magic to escape on his cloud,
 which he turned round to go straight back to the hollow by the road.
 Sanzang was looking out for him fixedly by the bright light of the moon
 and the stars, and as soon as he saw Monkey approaching he called out,
 &#8220;Can we get through the capital of Dharmadestructia, disciple?&#8221;</P>
<P>Coming up and laying the clothes down in front of him, Monkey
 replied, &#8220;Master, you won't get through Dharmadestructia as a monk.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;who do you think you're making things hard for?
 It's easy to stop being a monk. All you have to do is stop shaving your
 head for six months and let your hair grow.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We can't wait six months,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;We're going to turn into
 laymen right now.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But that's a completely ridiculous thing to say,&#8221; said a shocked
 Pig. &#8220;We're all monks now, and if we turned into laymen straight away
 we wouldn't be able to wear hats. Even if we could pull them tight
 enough at the edges we've got no hair to tie the string at the top to.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop fooling about,&#8221; Sanzang shouted, &#8220;and be serious. What do you
 really have in mind?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've had a good look at this city, Master,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and
 although the king is a wicked one who kills monks he is a true son of
 heaven. There is an auspicious glow and a happy atmosphere above the
 city. I know my way round the streets now, and I can understand and
 talk the local language. I've just borrowed these hats and clothes from
 an inn for us to dress ourselves up as laymen in. We'll go into the
 city, put up for the night, get up at the fourth watch and ask the
 innkeeper to fix us some vegetarian food. At the fifth watch we'll go
 out through the gate and head West along the main road. If we meet
 anyone who tries to stop us we can talk our way out of it. I'll tell
 him we were sent by the ruler of their suzerain state. The king of
 Dharmadestructia won't dare hold us up. He'll let us go on our way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Our big brother has arranged things very well,&#8221; said Friar Sand.
 &#8220;Let's do as he suggests.&#8221;</P>
<P>The venerable elder did indeed have no option but to take off his
 monastic tunic and hat and put on a layman's clothing and headwear.
 Friar Sand changed too, but Pig's head was too big for him to be able
 to wear a hat. Monkey fetched needle and thread, tore two hats open and
 sewed them into a single one. Then he put the hat on Pig's head and
 found a garment big enough for him to wear. Finally he dressed himself
 and said, &#8220;Gentlemen, we must ban the words 'master' and 'disciples' on
 this journey.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What else can we call each other?&#8221; Pig asked. &#8220;We must talk like
 people who address each other as brothers,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;The master
 can call himself Tang the Eldest. You can be Hogg the Third, and Friar
 Sand can be Sand the Fourth. I'll be Sun the Second. But when we are in
 the inn none of you must say anything. Leave all the talking to me.
 When they ask what line of business we're in I'll say we're horse
 dealers. I'll pretend that the white horse is a sample and that there
 are ten of us altogether, of whom we four have come ahead to book rooms
 at an inn and sell this horse. The innkeeper will be bound to treat us
 well then. We'll be properly looked after, and before we leave I'll
 find a piece of broken tile and turn it into silver to pay him with.
 Then we'll be able to go on our way.&#8221; Although he was not happy about
 it the Tang Priest had to go along with this.</P>
<P>The four of them hurried to the city, leading the horse and carrying
 the luggage. As this was a very peaceful place the city gates were
 still open although it was already night. They went straight into the
 city, and as they passed the gateway of Wang the Second's inn they
 could hear shouting inside.</P>
<P>People were yelling, &#8220;My hat's disappeared!&#8221; and &#8220;My clothes have
 gone!&#8221; Pretending he did not know what this was all about, Monkey took
 them to an inn further along on the other side of the road. This inn
 was still showing its lantern, so Monkey went up to the gateway and
 called, &#8220;Do you have a vacant room for us, innkeeper?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; a woman answered from inside. &#8220;Please come upstairs,
 gentlemen.&#8221; Before she had finished speaking a man came out to take the
 horse. Monkey handed him the horse to take inside. He then led the
 master into the building in the shadow of the lamp. Upstairs there were
 tables and chairs conveniently arranged, and when the window was opened
 they all sat down in the clear moonlight.</P>
<P>When someone came with a lighted lamp Monkey blocked the doorway,
 blew it out and said, &#8220;No need for a lamp on a bright night like this.&#8221;</P>
<P>No sooner had the man with the lamp gone down than a maid came up
 with four bowls of tea. Monkey took the bowls from her, only for her to
 be followed by a woman who looked to be about fifty-six or fifty-seven
 coming up the stairs.</P>
<P>Standing beside Monkey she asked, &#8220;Where are you gentlemen from? What
 fine goods do you have?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We're from the North,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and we've got a few poor
 horses to sell.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're very young to be a horse dealer,&#8221; the woman said.</P>
<P>&#8220;This gentleman is Tang the Eldest,&#8221; Monkey explained, &#8220;this is Hogg
 the Third, and this is Sand the fourth. I'm Sun the Second, an
 apprentice.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But your surnames are all different,&#8221; said the woman with a smile.
 &#8220;Yes,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;our surnames are different but we all live
 together. There are ten of us brothers altogether, and we four have
 come ahead to fix our board and lodging. The other six have found a
 place outside the city to stay tonight. It would have been awkward for
 them to come into the city as they've got a herd of horses. They'll
 come in tomorrow morning when we've fixed some accommodation. We won't
 go home till we've sold the horses.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How many horses are there in your herd?&#8221; the woman asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Over a hundred of all ages,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;They're all like that
 one of ours, except that they come in different colours.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Mr. Sun,&#8221; the woman said with a laugh, &#8220;you really know how to
 travel. You should have come straight here: no other inn would be able
 to put you up. We have a big courtyard well supplied with troughs and
 tethering posts and plenty of fodder too. We could feed several hundred
 horses here. There's just one thing I should mention. I've been keeping
 this inn for many years and it's quite well known. My late husband was
 called Zhao, but I'm afraid he died long ago, so this is now called
 Widow Zhao's Inn. We have three classes of entertainment for our
 guests. Let's get sordid money matters out of the way, then we can be
 more civilized later. The first thing is to discuss the tariffs and
 agree on one so that we know where we stand when it's time to settle
 the accounts.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Quite right,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;What are your three classes of
 entertainment? As the saying goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Your tariffs may be low, your tariffs may be dear,</P>
<P>But treat us all the same, who come from far or near.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>What do your tariffs involve? Could you explain them to me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We have first, second and third-class tariffs,&#8221; the old woman
 replied. &#8220;The first class is a banquet with five kinds of fruit and
 five different dishes. The tables are set with confectionery lions and
 immortals fighting. Two gentlemen share a table, and there are young
 ladies to sing to them and sleep with them. It costs half an ounce of
 silver per head, the price of the room included.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'd agree to that,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Where we come from half an
 ounce wouldn't even pay for a girl.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;For the second-class tariff,&#8221; the woman continued, &#8220;you all eat from
 the same dishes of food and we provide fruit and warm wine that you
 help yourselves to in your drinking games. No young ladies are provided
 and it costs one fifth of an ounce of silver each.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'd agree to that too,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;What about the third
 class?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I wouldn't like to discuss it with such distinguished gentlemen as
 yourselves,&#8221; she replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;No harm in telling us about it,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;so that we can
 choose what suits us best.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Nobody waits on you in the third class,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and we provide a
 big pot of rice for you to eat from as you will. When you're full
 there's straw for you to spread out on the ground and sleep on where it
 suits you. At dawn you give us a few coppers for the rice and I can
 assure you we won't argue about how much.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We're in luck,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;we're in luck. That's the sort of deal I
 like. I'll eat my fill from the cauldron then have a bloody good sleep
 in front of the stove.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What nonsense, brother,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;We've earned an ounce or two
 of silver on our travels. Give us the first-class treatment.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Make some good tea,&#8221; the woman said with great delight, &#8220;and tell
 the kitchen to get the food ready quickly.&#8221; She then went downstairs
 calling out, &#8220;Kill chickens and geese and boil up some pickled meat for
 them to have with their rice.&#8221;</P>
<P>Then she shouted, &#8220;Kill a pig and a sheep. What can't be eaten today
 can be served tomorrow. Get some good wine. Use the best white rice,
 and make some pancakes with white flour.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Sanzang heard all this from upstairs he said, &#8220;Whatever shall we
 do, Sun the Second? They're going to slaughter chickens, geese, a pig
 and a sheep. If they bring us all these we won't be able to eat them as
 we're all vegetarians.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've got an idea,&#8221; said Monkey, and he stamped in the doorway and
 called out, &#8220;Mrs. Zhao, come up here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What instructions do you have for me, sir,&#8221; she asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't kill any living creatures today. We're eating vegetarian food
 today,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Are you gentlemen permanent vegetarians, or just vegetarians for
 this month?&#8221; asked the woman in surprise.</P>
<P>&#8220;Neither,&#8221; replied Monkey. &#8220;We're vegetarians on<I> gengshen</I>
 days. Today's one, so we have to eat meatless food. But after the third
 watch tonight it'll be a<I> xinyou</I> day and the restrictions won't
 apply. Kill them tomorrow. Lay on some vegetarian food today, and make
 it first-class.&#8221;</P>
<P>This made the woman happier than ever. &#8220;Don't slaughter anything,&#8221;
 she said, hurrying downstairs, &#8220;don't slaughter anything. Fetch some
 tree-ear fungus, Fujian bamboo shoots, beancurd and wheat gluten. Pick
 some green vegetables in the garden, make vermicelli soup, steam some
 brad rolls, boil more white rice and make some scented tea.&#8221;</P>
<P>Now the cooks were experts because they cooked every day, so that
 everything was ready in an instant to be set out upstairs. They also
 had some confectioneries of lions and immortals that were already made
 for the four travelers to eat their fill of.</P>
<P>When the question was asked, &#8220;Would you like some mild wine?&#8221; Brother
 Monkey replied, &#8220;Eldest Brother Tang won't have any, but the rest of us
 will have a few cups.&#8221; The widow then fetched a jug of warm wine.</P>
<P>When drinks had been poured out for the three of them they heard the
 sound of banging against wooden boards. &#8220;Has some furniture fallen over
 downstairs, missus?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; the woman replied, &#8220;It's some retainers from my farm who
 arrived late this evening with rent rice. We let them sleep downstairs.
 As we were short-staffed when you gentlemen arrived I told them to take
 the sedan-chairs to the brothel to fetch some young ladies to keep you
 company. They must have hit the underneath of the floorboards with the
 chair-poles.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You mentioned that before,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;But don't send for them
 now. Today's a fast day, and besides, our brothers aren't here yet.
 They'll be here tomorrow for sure. Then we can all send for some
 call-girls and have a good time in your excellent establishment before
 we sell our horses and go.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What good men,&#8221; the woman said, &#8220;what good men. That way you'll all
 stay friends and you won't waste your energy.&#8221; Then she ordered that
 the sedan-chairs be brought back in as the whores were not to be
 fetched. The four of them finished their wine and food, the utensils
 were cleared away, and the meal was over.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are we going to sleep?&#8221; Sanzang whispered in Monkey's ear.</P>
<P>&#8220;Upstairs,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Too dangerous,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;We have all had so hard a journey
 that we may well fall fast asleep. If any of the inn people come in to
 tidy up and our hats have rolled off they will see our bald heads,
 realize that we are monks, and raise a hue and cry. That would be a
 disaster.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right,&#8221; said Monkey, going out to stamp his foot again.</P>
<P>&#8220;What instructions do you have this time, Mr. Sun?&#8221; the woman asked,
 coming upstairs once more.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are we to sleep?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Upstairs is best,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;There are no mosquitoes and there's
 a South wind. Open the windows wide and you'll sleep beautifully.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We won't be able to,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Our Mr. Hogg the Third has a
 touch of gout, Mr. Sand the Fourth has some rheumatism in his shoulder,
 Brother Tang can only sleep in the dark, and I don't like the light
 myself. So this is no place for us to sleep.&#8221;</P>
<P>As the woman went downstairs, leaning on the banisters and sighing,
 her daughter, who was carrying a child in her arms, came up to her and
 said, &#8220;Mother, as the saying goes, 'Be stuck on a sandbank for ten
 days, then said past nine sandbanks in one.' It's too hot now to be
 doing much business, but once autumn begins we'll have more than we can
 handle. What are you sighing like that for?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's not because business is slack, daughter,&#8221; the older woman
 replied. &#8220;I was just going to close the inn up this evening when four
 horse dealers came and took a room. They wanted the first-class tariff.
 I was hoping to make a little silver out of them, and I'm sighing
 because we won't earn much: they're fasting.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As they've already eaten they can't very well go to another inn,&#8221;
 the daughter replied. &#8220;And we'll be able to make money out of them when
 we serve them meat and wine tomorrow.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They're all poorly,&#8221; the older woman replied, &#8220;and want somewhere
 dark to sleep because they don't like drafts or light. All the rooms in
 the inn have got missing tiles, so where am I going to find somewhere
 dark for them? It'd be best to write off the cost of the meal and tell
 them to stay somewhere else.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But we do have somewhere dark in the house, mother,&#8221; her daughter
 replied, &#8220;where there's no draft and no light. It'll do splendidly.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where?&#8221; the older woman asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The big trunk that father had made when he was still alive,&#8221; the
 daughter replied. &#8220;It's four feet wide, seven feet long and three feet
 high, and big enough for seven people to sleep in. Tell them to sleep
 in the trunk.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I don't know whether it'll do,&#8221; said the older woman. &#8220;I'll ask
 them. Mr. Sun, if you won't have our poky little room there's nowhere
 darker here than our big trunk. It'll keep out light and drafts. So why
 don't you sleep in the trunk?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Splendid,&#8221; Monkey replied. She then told several of the retainers to
 carry the trunk out and open the lid, while inviting her guests to come
 downstairs. Monkey led the master and Friar Sand carried the luggage as
 they went to the trunk, following in the lantern's shadow. The reckless
 Pig was the first to climb inside. Friar Sand lifted the luggage in
 then helped the Tang Priest in before getting in himself.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where's our horse?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Tied up eating hay in the stables at the back,&#8221; replied the servant
 who was attending them.</P>
<P>&#8220;Bring it here,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;and bring the trough too. Tether the
 animal next to the trunk.&#8221; Only then did he get inside himself and call
 out, &#8220;Shut the lid, Mrs. Zhao, fasten the hasp and padlock it. And look
 it over for us. Glue paper wherever it lets in the light. Open it again
 early tomorrow morning.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're very particular,&#8221; the widow said. After that the doors were
 fastened and everyone went to bed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story switches to the four of them in the chest. Poor things!
 They were wearing hats, the weather was very hot and it was airless and
 stuffy. They took off their hats and clothes, and fanned themselves
 with their monastic hats for lack of fans. They were all crowded in
 next to each other and did not fall asleep till the second watch.
 Monkey, however, wanted to make trouble, so he stayed awake. He put his
 hand out and gave Pig a pinch on the leg.</P>
<P>The idiot pulled his leg in and mumbled, &#8220;Go to sleep. We've had a
 hard day. What do you want to fool around pinching people's hands and
 feet for?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We started by laying out five thousand ounces of silver,&#8221; said
 Monkey aloud, deliberately making mischief, &#8220;and we sold those horses
 the other day for three thousand. We've got four thousand in the two
 bags, and we'll sell this herd of horses for another three thousand.
 That means we'll have doubled our capital. That's not bad.&#8221; Pig, who
 was sleepy, did not bother to reply.</P>
<P>Now the floor staff, the water-carriers and the kitchen porters were
 in league with bandits. After hearing Brother Monkey talking about all
 the money they had, several of them slipped off to fetch twenty or more
 armed bandits to come with torches to rob the four horse traders. As
 they charger in through the gates they gave Widow Zhao and her daughter
 such a fright that shivering and shaking they fastened the doors of
 their room and let the robbers take whatever they wanted outside. Now
 the bandits were not after the inn's property but were looking for the
 guests. When they went upstairs and found no sign of them there, they
 lit their torches and held them out while they looked all around. All
 they could see was a large trunk in the courtyard, to the bottom of
 which was tethered a white horse. The lid was tightly locked and could
 not be prized open.</P>
<P>&#8220;Travelling merchants all know what they're about,&#8221; the bandits said.
 &#8220;This trunk looks so strong that it's bound to be full of purses,
 valuables and silk. Let's steal the horse, take the trunk out of town,
 open it up and share out what's inside. That would be the best thing,
 wouldn't it?&#8221; The bandits then found some rope with which they lifted
 the box and carried it off, swinging and swaying.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, woken up by this, &#8220;go to sleep. Why are you
 rocking us?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Shut up,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Nobody's rocking us.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang and Friar Sand had been abruptly awoken too, and they asked,
 &#8220;Who's carrying us?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Keep quiet,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;keep quiet. Let them carry us. If they
 carry us to the Western Heaven we'll be saved the trouble of walking.&#8221;</P>
<P>But the successful bandits were not heading West. Instead they headed
 towards the East of the city, killing the soldiers on the city gate,
 opening it and letting themselves out. This caused a sensation in the
 streets and the markets, where the watchmen of all the shops reported
 it to the commander-in-chief of the city garrison and the East city
 commissioner. As this was their responsibility the commander-in-chief
 and the East city commissioner mustered a force of infantry, cavalry
 and bowmen that left the city in pursuit of the bandits. Seeing that
 resistance to so powerful a government force would have been pointless,
 the bandits abandoned the trunk and the white horse, scattered into the
 undergrowth and disappeared. The government troops did not catch even
 half a robber: all they captured was the trunk and the white horse,
 with which they returned in triumph. The commander-in-chief examined
 the horse in the light of the lamps and saw that it was a fine one:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Threads of silver grew in his mane;</P>
<P>In his tail hung strands of jade.</P>
<P>Forget about Eight Chargers and dragon steeds;</P>
<P>This was steadier than the great Sushuang;</P>
<P>Its bones alone would have sold for a thousand ounces of silver;</P>
<P>It could gallop after the wind for three thousand miles.</P>
<P>When it climbed a mountain it merged into the clouds;</P>
<P>As it neighed at the moon it was as white as snow.</P>
<P>It was truly a dragon from an ocean island,</P>
<P>A unicorn of Jade in the human world.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The commander-in-chief rode the white horse instead of his own steed
 as he led his men back into the city. The trunk was carried to his
 headquarters, where he and the East city commissioner sealed it with
 strips of paper on which they wrote and set a guard over it till
 morning, when they would submit a memorial to the king and request a
 decision on what to do with it. After that the other troops were
 dismissed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story now tells how the venerable Tang Priest was grumbling at
 Monkey inside the chest. &#8220;Ape,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you've killed me this time.
 If I had been arrested outside and taken to the king of
 Dharmadestructia I might well have been able to put up a good argument
 in my defense. But now I am here, locked in this trunk. I have been
 carried off by bandits and recaptured by the army. When we are shown to
 the king tomorrow we will be all ready for him to put to the sword and
 make up his ten thousand.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There are people outside!&#8221; exclaimed Monkey. &#8220;If they open the trunk
 and take you out you'll either be tied up or hung up. If you don't want
 to be tied or strung up you'd better show a little patience. When we're
 taken to see this deluded king tomorrow I'll definitely be able to talk
 my way out of things. I guarantee that not one hair of yours will be
 harmed. So stop worrying and go back to sleep.&#8221;</P>
<P>In the third watch Monkey used one of his magic powers. Slipping his
 cudgel out he blew on it with a magic breath, called &#8220;Change!&#8221; and
 turned it into a triple auger with which he drilled two or three holes
 near the bottom of the chest, forming a single larger hole. He put the
 auger away, shook himself, turned into an ant and crawled out. Then he
 turned back into himself and rode his cloud straight to the palace
 gates. The king was fast asleep at the time, so Monkey used his Great
 All powerful Body-dividing Magic.</P>
<P>Plucking all the hairs out of his left arm he blew on them with a
 magic breath, called &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned them into little Monkeys.
 Then he pulled all the hairs out from his right arm, blew on them with
 a magic breath, called &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned them into sleep-insects.
 Next he recited the magic word<I> Om</I> and told the local deity of
 the place to take the little Monkeys to distribute them throughout the
 palace to all the officials in every office and department of
 government. Each holder of official rank was given a sleep-insect to
 ensure that he or she would sleep soundly and not get up. Monkey then
 took his gold-banded cudgel in his hands, squeezed it, waved it,
 called, &#8220;Change, treasure!&#8221; and turned it into over a thousand razors
 of the sort used for shaving the head. Taking one himself, he told all
 the little monkeys to take one each and shave the heads of everyone in
 the inner quarters of the palace and in all the government departments
 and offices. This was indeed a case of:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the Dharma king would destroy it the Dharma is infinite;</P>
<P>The Dharma runs through heaven and earth, opening the Great Way.</P>
<P>The origins of ten thousand Dharmas all come down to one;</P>
<P>The features of the Three Vehicles are basically the same.</P>
<P>He bored through the trunk to find out the news,</P>
<P>Distributed his golden hairs to smash delusion,</P>
<P>Determined to bring the Dharma king to the true achievement,</P>
<P>To the eternal emptiness of what is not born and dies not.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>That night the head-shaving was completed, so Monkey said another
 spell to dismiss the local deity, shook himself to bring all the hairs
 back to his arms, then touched all the razors to turn them back into
 their true form as the gold-banded cudgel, which he made much smaller
 and hid in his ear again. Finally he reverted to being an ant, crawled
 back into the trunk, and went on guarding the Tang Priest in his time
 of danger.</P>
<P>When the palace ladies in the inner quarters got up to wash and do
 their hair before dawn the next morning they all found that their hair
 had gone. The same had happened to all the eunuchs, senior and junior,
 who moved around the palace. They all crowded to the outside of the
 royal bedchamber, where they played music to wake the king up, all
 holding back their tears but not daring to speak. Before long the queen
 in the palace woke up to find her hair gone too. When she hurried with
 lanterns to the dragon bed she found a monk sleeping in the brocade
 quilt, at which she could restrain her tongue no longer, thus awakening
 the king.</P>
<P>When the king suddenly opened his eyes wide and saw the queen's bald
 head he got straight out of bed and said, &#8220;Why are you like that, my
 queen?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're the same, Your Majesty,&#8221; she replied. The king then rubbed
 his head, which gave him such a fright that the three souls in his body
 groaned, and his seven spirits flew off into the air.</P>
<P>&#8220;What has happened to me?&#8221; he exclaimed.</P>
<P>Just when he was in this panicky state the royal consorts, the palace
 ladies and the eunuchs young and old all fell to their knees, their
 heads shaved bald, and said, &#8220;Lord, we have all been turned into
 monks.&#8221;</P>
<P>At the sight of them the king wept. &#8220;We think this must be because of
 all the monks we have killed,&#8221; he said. He then gave these orders:
 &#8220;None of you are to say anything about the loss of our hair as, if you
 do, the civil and military officials may slander our country and say
 that it has been badly governed. Let us now hold court in the throne
 hall.&#8221;</P>
<P>Now all the officials high and low in all the departments and offices
 of government went to court to pay their respects before dawn. As it
 turned out, all these men had lost their hair in the night too, and
 they all submitted memorials reporting the fact. All that could be
 heard was:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The whip of silence sounding three times at the royal audience;</P>
<P>As all report that their heads have now been shaved.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you do not know what happened to the booty in the trunk that the
 commander-in-chief had recaptured and whether the Tang Priest and his
 three disciples were to live or die, listen to the explanation in the
 next installment.</P>

</I>
<P>The Mind-ape is jealous of the Mother of Wood</P>
<P>The Demon Chief Plots to Devour the Master of Dhyana</P>
</B>
<P>The story tells how when the king held his dawn audience the civil
 and military officials all carried memorials. &#8220;Sovereign Lord,&#8221; they
 reported, &#8220;we beg you to forgive your servants for their lack of
 decorum.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; the king replied, &#8220;you are all as courteous as ever.
 What lack of decorum are you showing?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Sovereign Lord,&#8221; they said, &#8220;we do not know why, but all of your
 servants lost their hair last night.&#8221; Holding in his hand these
 memorials about the lost hair, the king descended from his dragon
 throne to say to the officials, &#8220;Indeed, we do not know why either, but
 everyone in the palace, young and old, lost their hair last night.&#8221;</P>
<P>King and ministers alike all wept as they said, &#8220;From now on we will
 not dare kill any more monks.&#8221; The king then returned to his throne and
 the officials took their places in their proper ranks. The king then
 said, &#8220;Let those with business here come forward from their ranks to
 report. If there is no other business the curtain may be rolled up and
 the audience ended.&#8221;</P>
<P>The commander-in-chief of the capital's garrison then moved forward
 from the ranks of military officials and the East city commissioner
 moved forward from the ranks of the civil officials to kowtow at the
 steps of the throne and report, &#8220;We were patrolling the city on Your
 Majesty's orders last night when we recaptured a trunk of bandits'
 booty and a white horse. As we do not dare take unauthorized action
 over these we beg Your Majesty to issue an edict.&#8221; The king was
 delighted.</P>
<P>&#8220;Bring it here, trunk and all,&#8221; he ordered.</P>
<P>The two officials then returned to their own offices, mustered a full
 complement of soldiers and had the trunk carried out. Sanzang, who was
 inside, felt his soul leaving his body. &#8220;Disciples,&#8221; he said, &#8220;what
 shall we say in our defense when we reach the king?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Shut up,&#8221; said Monkey with a grin. &#8220;I've fixed everything. When the
 trunk's opened the king will bow to us as his teachers. The only thing
 is that Pig mustn't quarrel about precedence.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If they don't kill me that'll be heaven,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;What would I
 want to quarrel about?&#8221; Before these words were all out of his mouth
 they had been carried to the palace entrance and in through the Tower
 of Five Phoenixes to be set at the foot of the steps to the throne.</P>
<P>On being invited by the two officials to have the trunk opened and
 look inside the king ordered that this be done. No sooner was the lid
 lifted than Pig, who could restrain himself no longer, sprang outside,
 giving all the officials such a fright that they shivered, unable to
 speak. Next Brother Monkey could be seen helping the Tang Priest out,
 while Friar Sand lifted the luggage out.</P>
<P>Seeing that the commander-in-chief was holding the white horse, Pig
 went up to him, made an angry noise and said, &#8220;That's my horse. Hand it
 over!&#8221; This so terrified the official that he collapsed head over
 heels.</P>
<P>The four pilgrims all stood upright in the middle of the steps, and
 when the king saw that they were monks he came down at once from his
 dragon throne, sent for his queen and consorts from the inner quarters,
 descended the steps of the throne hall, bowed to them along with all
 his officials and asked, &#8220;What brings you venerable gentlemen here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have been sent by His Majesty the Great Tang Emperor to go to the
 Great Thunder Monastery in India in the West to worship the living
 Buddha and fetch the true scriptures,&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Venerable Master,&#8221; the king said, &#8220;you have come from far away. But
 why did you sleep in this trunk last night?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I knew that Your Majesty had sworn a vow to kill Buddhist monks,&#8221;
 Sanzang replied, &#8220;which is why I did not dare to visit your illustrious
 country openly, but disguised myself as a layman to arrive late at
 night to find lodging in one of your inns. We slept in the trunk
 because we were afraid that our real identity would be discovered.
 Unfortunately the trunk was stolen by bandits, then brought back here
 by the commander-in-chief. Now that I have been able to see Your
 Majesty's dragon countenance, the clouds have cleared away and the sun
 has come out. I hope that Your Majesty will pardon and release me,
 ascetic monk that I am: my gratitude will be as deep as the ocean.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Venerable Master,&#8221; the king replied, &#8220;you are a distinguished monk
 from our suzerain heavenly dynasty. It was wrong of us not to go out to
 welcome you. For years we have been fulfilling a vow to kill monks
 because a monk once maligned us. The vow we made to heaven was to kill
 ten thousand monks to make up a round number. We never imagined that
 today we would return to the truth and that we would all be turned into
 monks. Now all of us, king, officials, queen and consorts, have had our
 hair shaved off. I beg, Venerable Master, that you will not be grudging
 with your lofty virtue and will take us as your disciples.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Pig heard this he started roaring with laughter: &#8220;If you're
 going to be our disciples what introductory presents have you got for
 us?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you will accept us as your follower, Master,&#8221; the king replied,
 &#8220;we will present you with all the wealth in our kingdom.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't talk about wealth to us,&#8221; said Brother Monkey, &#8220;as we're
 proper monks. As long as you inspect and return our passport and escort
 us out of the city I can guarantee that your monarchy will last for
 ever and that you will enjoy a long and happy life.&#8221; On hearing this
 the king ordered his office of foreign relations to arrange a great
 feast at which monarch and officials together returned to the one
 truth. The passport was immediately inspected and returned, after which
 Sanzang was asked to change the name of the country.</P>
<P>&#8220;'Dharma' in the name of Your Majesty's country is excellent,&#8221; Monkey
 said, &#8220;but the 'destructia' part is nonsense. Now that we've come here
 you should change the name to 'Dharmarespectia'. This would guarantee</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Clear waters and victory for a thousand generations;</P>
<P>Timely winds and rain with universal peace.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The king thanked them for their gracious kindness, had the royal
 carriage prepared and escorted the Tang Priest and his three disciples
 Westwards out of the city.</P>
<P>We will say no more of how monarch and subjects now held to the true
 faith, but tell how after leaving the king of Dharmarespectia the
 venerable elder said happily from on his horse, &#8220;What excellent magic
 you used, Wukong. It worked very well.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Elder brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;where did you find so many barbers
 to shave all those heads in one night?&#8221; Monkey then told them all about
 how he had used his miraculous powers, at which they all laughed so
 much they could not stop.</P>
<P>Just as they were feeling so cheerful a great mountain came into
 view, blocking their way. Reining in the horse, the Tang Priest said,
 &#8220;Disciples, see how high that mountain is. You must be very careful.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry,&#8221; said Monkey with a grin, &#8220;don't worry. I promise you
 nothing will go wrong.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't say that,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;I can see those jutting peaks,
 and even from a distance it looks rather sinister. Storm clouds are
 streaming from it, and I am beginning to feel frightened. My whole body
 is turning numb and my spirits are disturbed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You have already forgotten the<I> Heart Sutra</I> that the Rook's
 Nest Hermit taught you,&#8221; said Brother Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;I can still remember it,&#8221; Sanzang said.</P>
<P>&#8220;Even if you can still remember that,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;there is a
 quatrain that you've forgotten.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What quatrain?&#8221; Sanzang asked, to which Monkey replied,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do not go far to seek the Buddha on Vulture Peak;</P>
<P>Vulture Peak is in your heart.</P>
<P>Everybody has a Vulture Peak stupa</P>
<P>Under which to cultivate conduct.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Of course I know it, disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;According to that
 quatrain the thousands of scriptures all come down to cultivating the
 heart.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Goes without saying,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;When the heart is purified it can shine alone;</P>
<P>When the heart is preserved all perceptions are pure.</P>
<P>If there is any mistake then laziness follows,</P>
<P>And success will not come in a myriad years.</P>
<P>As long as your will is sincere Thunder Peak is before your eyes.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>But if you're as scared, frightened and disturbed as this the Great
 Way is distant, and Thunder Peak is far, far away. Forget those wild
 fears and come with me.&#8221; When the venerable elder heard this his
 spirits were revived and his worries disappeared.</P>
<P>The four of them had only gone a few more steps when they reached the
 mountain. When they raised their eyes this was what they saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A fine mountain,</P>
<P>Dappled with many colours.</P>
<P>White clouds drifted around the peak,</P>
<P>And cool were the shadows of the trees in front of the cliff.</P>
<P>The birds rustled in the leaves,</P>
<P>The beasts were ferocious.</P>
<P>Among the woods were a thousand pines,</P>
<P>On the ridge a few bamboos.</P>
<P>Howls came from gray wolves seizing their prey,</P>
<P>And roars from hungry tigers fighting over food.</P>
<P>Long screamed the wild apes searching for fruit;</P>
<P>The David's-deer climbed through blossoms into mists of green.</P>
<P>The wind was blowing,</P>
<P>The waters babbled,</P>
<P>And hidden birds sang in the deserted pass.</P>
<P>Here and there wisteria was climbing</P>
<P>While rare flowers bloomed by the stream amid orchids.</P>
<P>Intricately shaped and strange were the rocks,</P>
<P>And sheer rose the crags.</P>
<P>Foxes and raccoon-dogs ran in packs;</P>
<P>Badgers and apes were playing in groups.</P>
<P>The travelers were worried by so high and steep a mountain:</P>
<P>Why was the ancient track so twisted?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>While master and disciples were moving timidly ahead they heard the
 howling of a wind. &#8220;There's a wind,&#8221; said Sanzang in fear.</P>
<P>&#8220;In the spring there are mild winds,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;in the summer
 hot ones, in the autumn golden ones and in the winter North winds.
 There are winds in all four seasons. What's so frightening about a
 wind?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This wind is blowing very hard,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;It is definitely
 not a wind from heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But winds always come from the earth and clouds from mountains,&#8221;
 Monkey replied, &#8220;so how could there be a wind from heaven?&#8221; Before he
 had finished speaking a mist arose. That mist really was</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Darkness joining up with the sky,</P>
<P>Obscurity making the whole earth dim.</P>
<P>The sun had completely vanished from sight</P>
<P>And no bird sang.</P>
<P>All was as indistinct as primal chaos,</P>
<P>And the air seemed filled with flying dust.</P>
<P>The trees on the mountain could not be seen</P>
<P>Where had the herb-gatherers gone?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said Sanzang in fright, &#8220;why is there this mist when the
 wind is still blowing?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't get upset,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Get off your horse, Master. I'll
 go and see whether or not it's sinister while you two keep guard,
 brothers.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage needed only to bow in order to be in mid-air.
 Holding his hand to his brow for shade, he opened his fiery eyes wide
 and looked down to see an evil spirit sitting at the foot of a beetling
 scar. Just look and see what he was like:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A mighty body full of charm,</P>
<P>A heroic manner of great vigor.</P>
<P>The fangs protruding from his mouth were drills of steel;</P>
<P>His nose hung like a jade hook in the middle.</P>
<P>His golden eyes with pupils round gave animals a fright;</P>
<P>Demons and gods were scared of his bristling silver whiskers.</P>
<P>He sat upright by the cliff in terrible might,</P>
<P>Making the mist and wind as he hatched his plot.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On either side of him some thirty or forty junior demons could be
 seen, all drawn up in line and blowing out mist and wind for all they
 were worth. Monkey grinned at this and thought, &#8220;So my master is
 clairvoyant. He said it wasn't a heavenly wind, and it was in fact
 caused by this evil spirit trying to fool us. Now if I went straight
 down and hit him with what they call a 'garlicsmasher' that'd kill him
 sure enough, but it would ruin my reputation.&#8221; Monkey had been a true
 hero all his life and was quite incapable of playing a dirty trick like
 that.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'd better go back and give Pig some attention. I'll ask him to hit
 the evil spirit first. If Pig's good enough to kill the evil spirit
 we'll be in luck. If he isn't and the evil spirit captures him I can
 come back to rescue him and win myself a bit of fame. He's always
 putting on such an act and being so lazy&#8212;he won't make an effort.
 Still, he is very greedy and partial to a good feed. I think I'll try a
 trick on him and see how that works.&#8221;</P>
<P>At once he brought his cloud down to land in front of Sanzang, who
 asked, &#8220;Are the wind and the mist sinister or not?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's clear now,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;They've gone.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;they have eased off a little.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile, &#8220;my eyesight is very good
 usually, but this time I was wrong. I thought there'd probably be a
 monster behind that wind and mist but there wasn't.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What caused them then?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;There's a village not far ahead,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;where the people
 are so pious that they're steaming white rice and white breadrolls to
 feed monks with. I think that the mist must have been steam escaping
 from their steamers. It was the result of their goodness.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Pig heard this he thought Monkey was telling the truth, so he
 grabbed hold of him and whispered, &#8220;Did you eat their food before you
 came back?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Only a bit,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;The vegetable dishes were too salty&#8212;I
 didn't want to eat too much.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Screw that,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;I'd eat my fill of it however salty it was.
 If it made me really thirsty I'd come back for a drink of water.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Would you like some?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Sure thing,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;I'm hungry and I'd like some now. What do
 you think?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You mustn't even talk about it,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;As the ancient book
 says, 'When the father is present the son must do nothing on his own
 account.' Our master, who's as good as a father to you, is here, so
 none of us should dare go ahead.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you'll say nothing about it, I'm going,&#8221; replied Pig with a grin.</P>
<P>&#8220;Let's see how you do it,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;I'll say nothing.&#8221; When
 it came to eating the idiot knew a thing or two.</P>
<P>He went up to his master, made a loud &#8220;na-a-aw&#8221; of respect, and said,
 &#8220;Master, elder brother has just told me that there are people in a
 village ahead of us who feed monks. Just look at that horse. It looks
 as though it's going to start playing it up. We'll be causing a lot of
 trouble if we have to ask for grass and other fodder for it. Luckily
 the wind and the clouds have gone now, so why don't you all sit here
 for a while while I fetch some tender grass? We can go and beg for food
 from that house when we've fed the horse.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Splendid,&#8221; said the Tang Priest with delight. &#8220;I wondered why you've
 become so hardworking today. Be as quick as you can.&#8221;</P>
<P>Smiling secretly to himself the idiot started out. &#8220;Brother,&#8221; said
 Monkey, catching up and grabbing hold of him, &#8220;they feed monks all
 right, but only good-looking ones.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case I'll have to change again,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Brother Monkey, &#8220;you change.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid idiot, who could perform thirty-six transformations,
 went into a hollow on the mountainside, made a spell with his hands,
 said the magic words, shook himself and turned himself into a short,
 skinny monk, beating a wooden fish-shaped dram with his hand and
 mumbling, &#8220;Oh great one, oh great one,&#8221; because he knew no scriptures
 to recite.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After putting away the wind and the mist the evil spirit ordered all
 his devils to form a circle round the main road, ready for any
 travelers. The idiot's luck was out, and he was soon inside the trap
 and surrounded by the devils, who grabbed at his clothes and his silken
 sash as they all crowded in on him together.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't pull,&#8221; Pig said. &#8220;You can let me eat in all your houses in
 turn.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you want to eat, monk?&#8221; the devils asked. &#8220;You feed monks
 here,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;and I've come to be fed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So you're hoping to be fed, are you, monk?&#8221; said the demons. &#8220;You
 don't seem to realize that what we like doing best here is eating
 monks. We're all evil immortals who've found the Way here in the
 mountains, and the only thing we want to do is to catch you monks, take
 you home with us, pop you in the steamer till you're tender and eat
 you. And you're still hoping for a vegetarian meal!&#8221;</P>
<P>At this Pig's heart was filled with terror, and he started
 complaining about Monkey. &#8220;That Protector of the Horses is a crook. He
 lied to me about them feeding monks in this village. There aren't any
 villagers here and there's nobody who feeds monks. They're all evil
 spirits.&#8221; The idiot was being tugged at so hard that he turned back
 into himself, pulled the rake out from his belt and struck out wildly,
 driving all the junior devils back.</P>
<P>They rushed back to report to the senior demon, &#8220;Disaster, Your
 Majesty.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What disaster?&#8221; the senior demon asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;A neat-looking monk came along in front of the mountain,&#8221; they
 replied, &#8220;so we decided to catch him and steam him. We were going to
 keep what we couldn't eat now for a bad day. Then to our astonishment
 he transformed himself.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What did he turn himself into?&#8221; the senior demon asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Not into anything human,&#8221; they replied. &#8220;He's got a long snout, big
 ears, and a bristly mane on his back. He lashed out furiously at us
 with a rake that he used two-handed. He gave us such a terrible fright
 that we've run straight back to report to Your Majesty.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be afraid,&#8221; the senior demon said. &#8220;Let me go and have a
 look.&#8221; Swinging his iron mace he went up for a closer look and saw that
 the idiot really was hideous. This is what he looked like:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A snout like a husking hammer over three feet long;</P>
<P>Tusks like silver nails protruding from his mouth.</P>
<P>Two round eyes that flashed like lightning;</P>
<P>A pair of ears that made a howling wind when they flapped.</P>
<P>The bristles behind his head were rows of iron arrows;</P>
<P>All of his hide was rough and green and scabby.</P>
<P>In his hands he held an amazing object:</P>
<P>A nine-toothed rake of which everyone was afraid.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Summoning up his courage, the evil spirit shouted, &#8220;Where are you
 from? What's your name? Tell me at once and I'll spare your life.&#8221;</P>
<P>To this Pig replied with a laugh, &#8220;So you can't recognize your own
 ancestor Pig either, my boy. Come closer and I'll tell you:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>For my huge mouth and tusks and mighty powers</P>
<P>I was made Marshal Tian Peng by the Jade Emperor,</P>
<P>Commanding eighty thousand marines on the River of Heaven,</P>
<P>And happy amid all the joys of the heavenly palace.</P>
<P>Because when drunk I fluted with a palace lady</P>
<P>I decided to play the hero for a while.</P>
<P>One butt from my snout destroyed the Dipper and Bull Palace;</P>
<P>I ate the magic mushrooms of the Queen Mother of the West.</P>
<P>The Jade Emperor himself gave me two thousand hammer-blows,</P>
<P>Made me an exile from the world of Heaven.</P>
<P>This made me determined to nourish my spirit,</P>
<P>And become an evil monster in the lower world.</P>
<P>Just when I had made a good marriage in Gao Village</P>
<P>Fate brought me up against my brother Monkey.</P>
<P>He subdued me with his gold-banded cudgel;</P>
<P>I was forced to bow my head and enter the Buddhist faith.</P>
<P>I do the heavy work, saddle the horse and carry luggage:</P>
<P>I must have been the Tang Priest's debtor in an earlier life.</P>
<P>As the iron-footed Marshal Tian Peng my surname was Zhu;</P>
<P>My name as a Buddhist is Zhu Bajie.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the evil spirit heard this he shouted, &#8220;So you're the Tang
 Priest's disciple. I've long heard that his flesh is very tasty. You're
 one of the people I most want to catch. I'm not going to spare you now
 you've fallen into my clutches. Stay where you are, and take this from
 my mace.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Evil beast,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;You must have been a dyer before.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean, I must have been a dyer?&#8221; the evil spirit asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you weren't a dyer, how come you know how to use a pestle?&#8221; Pig
 retorted, and with no further argument the monster was upon him,
 striking furiously. They fought a fine battle in the mountain hollow:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A nine-toothed rake,</P>
<P>An iron mace.</P>
<P>As the rake went through its movements they were like a howling gale;</P>
<P>The mace's skilful blows came as thick and fast as rain.</P>
<P>One was an unknown ogre blocking the mountain road;</P>
<P>The other was the offending Tian Peng now guarding his true nature's
 master.</P>
<P>When one's nature is right monsters cause no fear;</P>
<P>When the mountain is high earth cannot come from metal.</P>
<P>One fought with his mace like a python from a pool;</P>
<P>The other's rake was like a dragon from the waters.</P>
<P>Their angry shouts shook mountains and rivers;</P>
<P>Their mighty roars caused terror down in hell.</P>
<P>Each of the heroes displayed his prowess,</P>
<P>Staking his life on his magical powers.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We will say no more of how Pig set a mighty wind blowing as he fought
 the evil spirit, who ordered his junior devils to keep Pig surrounded.
 Instead the story tells how Brother Monkey suddenly gave a bitter laugh
 behind the Tang Priest's back.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why are you laughing like that, elder brother?&#8221; Friar Sand asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Pig really is an idiot,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;As soon as he heard that
 they feed monks there he fell for my trick. He's been away a long time
 now. If he'd beaten the evil spirit with a single blow of his rake
 you'd have seen him coming back in triumph by now, loudly insisting on
 his great victory. But if the demon's been too much for him and
 captured him my luck's out. Goodness only knows how often he'll have
 cursed the Protector of the Horses behind my back. Say nothing while I
 go to take a look around, Wujing.&#8221;</P>
<P>With that the splendid Great Sage, who did not want the venerable
 elder to know what was happening, quietly pulled a hair out of the back
 of his head, blew on it with magic breath, said &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned it
 into his own double to stay with the master together with Friar Sand.
 Then his real self disappeared as he leapt up into the air to look
 around. He saw the idiot lashing out wildly with his rake at the devils
 who were surrounding him and gradually getting the better of him.</P>
<P>This was more than Monkey could bear. Bringing his cloud down to
 land, he shouted at the top of his voice, &#8220;Take it easy, Pig. Monkey's
 here.&#8221; Recognizing that it was Monkey's voice gave the idiot a chance
 to be more ferocious than ever as he hit wildly forward with his rake.
 The evil spirit was no match for him.</P>
<P>&#8220;You weren't up to much before, monk,&#8221; he said, &#8220;so how come you're
 so fierce now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You'd better stop bullying me now, my lad,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;I've got
 one of my people here now.&#8221; A moment later he was swinging wildly again
 with the rake. The evil spirit, unable to stave off the blows, led his
 devils away in defeat. As soon as Monkey saw that the devils had been
 beaten he drew no closer but went straight back on his cloud, shook the
 hair and put it back on his body. With his mortal, fleshly eyes the
 Tang Priest noticed nothing of this.</P>
<P>Before long a triumphant Pig returned too, so exhausted that his nose
 was dripping with snot as he foamed at the mouth and was panting
 loudly. &#8220;Master!&#8221; he called.</P>
<P>When the Tang Priest saw him he exclaimed in astonishment, &#8220;Pig, you
 went to fetch some grass for the horse. Why have you come back in so
 terrible a state? Were there watchmen on the mountain who wouldn't let
 you cut any?&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot flung his rake down, beat his chest and stamped his feet as
 he replied, &#8220;Don't ask me about it, Master. If I had to tell you I'd
 die of shame.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What would you be so ashamed of?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Elder brother tricked me,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;He told me that it wasn't
 an evil spirit behind that wind and mist. He said there was nothing
 sinister about it, but that it was from a village where the people were
 so pious that they were steaming white rice and breadrolls made with
 white flour to feed monks with. I believed him. As I was so hungry I
 thought I'd go ahead to beg for some. Fetching grass for the horse was
 only an excuse. I never expected to be surrounded by a crowd of evil
 spirits. They gave me a hard fight, and if Monkey hadn't helped me out
 with his mourner's staff I'd have had no hope of escaping and getting
 back here.&#8221;</P>
<P>'The idiot's talking nonsense,&#8221; said Monkey, who was standing beside
 them, with a smile. &#8220;If you've taken to robbery you're trying to get a
 whole gaolful of people into trouble. I've been looking after the
 master here. I've never left his side.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It is true,&#8221; Sanzang said, &#8220;Wukong has never left my side.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot then sprang up shouting, &#8220;You don't understand, Master.
 He's got a double.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Is there really a monster there, Wukong?&#8221; Sanzang asked. Monkey
 could keep his deception up no longer.</P>
<P>&#8220;There are a few little devils,&#8221; Monkey replied with a bow and a
 smile, &#8220;but they won't dare give us any trouble. Come here, Pig. I'm
 going to look after you. We're going to escort the master along this
 steep mountain path as if we were an army on the march.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;You'll be the commander of the vanguard,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;going in
 front and clearing the way. If the evil spirit doesn't show up again
 that will be that; but if he does, you fight him. When you beat the
 evil spirit that'll be something to your credit.&#8221;</P>
<P>Reckoning that the evil spirit's powers were much the same as his
 own, Pig said, &#8220;Very well then. I'm ready to die at his hands. I'll
 take the lead.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Idiot,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;if you start by saying such unlucky things
 you'll never get anywhere.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As you know, brother,&#8221; Pig replied,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;When a gentleman goes to a banquet</P>
<P>He gets either drunk or well filled;</P>
<P>When a hero goes into a battle</P>
<P>He gets either wounded or killed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>By saying something unlucky first I'll make myself stronger later.&#8221;
 This delighted Monkey, who saddled the horse and invited the master to
 ride while Friar Sand carried the luggage as they all followed Pig into
 the mountains.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The evil spirit meanwhile led a few of his underlings who had
 survived the rout straight back to his cave, where he sat brooding in
 silence high up above a rocky precipice. Many of the junior devils who
 looked after things in his household came up to him and asked, &#8220;Why are
 you so miserable today, Your Majesty? You're usually in-such high
 spirits when you come back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Little ones,&#8221; said the demon king, &#8220;usually when I go out to patrol
 the mountains I can be sure of bringing home a few people or animals
 I've caught to feed you with. Today my luck was out: I've met my
 match.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Who?&#8221; the junior devils asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;A monk,&#8221; the demon king replied, &#8220;a disciple of the Tang Priest from
 the East who's going to fetch the scriptures. He's called Zhu Bajie. He
 went for me so hard with his rake that he beat me. I had to run away.
 I'm thoroughly fed up. For ages now I've heard it said that the Tang
 Priest is an arhat who has cultivated his conduct for ten successive
 lifetimes. Anyone who eats a piece of his flesh will live for ever. To
 my surprise he's come to my mountain today, and it would have been an
 ideal time to catch him, cook him and eat him. I never realized he'd
 have a disciple like that one.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before he had finished saying this a junior devil slipped forward
 from the ranks. First he gave three sobs in front of the demon king,
 then three laughs.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why sob then laugh?&#8221; shouted the demon king.</P>
<P>The junior devil fell to his knees as he replied, &#8220;Because Your
 Majesty just said that you wanted to eat the Tang Priest. His flesh
 isn't worth eating.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But everyone says that a piece of his flesh will make you live as
 long as the heavens,&#8221; said the demon king. &#8220;How can you say that it's
 not worth eating?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If he were so good to eat,&#8221; the junior devil replied, &#8220;he'd never
 have got this far. Other demons would have eaten him up. And he's got
 three disciples with him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do you know who?&#8221; the demon king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The senior disciple is Sun the Novice,&#8221; said the junior devil, &#8220;and
 the third disciple is Friar Sand. The one you met must have been his
 second disciple Zhu Bajie.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How does Friar Sand compare with Zhu Bajie?&#8221; asked the demon king.</P>
<P>&#8220;He's much the same,&#8221; the junior devil said,</P>
<P>&#8220;What about Sun the Novice?&#8221; the demon king asked, at which the
 junior devil thrust out his tongue in horror and replied, &#8220;I daren't
 tell you. That Monkey has tremendous magic powers and can do all sorts
 of transformations. Five hundred years ago he made terrible havoc in
 heaven. None of the heavenly warriors dared give him any trouble, from
 the Twenty-eight Constellations, the Star Lords of the Nine Bright
 Shiners, the Gods of the Twelve Branches, the Five Officers and the
 Four Ministers, the East and West Dippers and the Gods of the North and
 the South, to the Five Peaks and the Four Rivers. How can you have the
 nerve to want to eat the Tang Priest?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How do you know so much about him?&#8221; the demon king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I used to live in the Lion Cave of the demon king on Lion Ridge,&#8221;
 the junior devil replied. &#8220;He was reckless enough to want to eat the
 Tang Priest, and that Sun the Novice smashed his way in through the
 gates with his gold-banded cudgel. It was terrible. They were wiped
 out. Luckily I had enough sense to escape by the back door and come
 here, where Your Majesty allowed me to stay. That's how I know about
 his powers.&#8221;</P>
<P>The senior demon turned pale with shock when he heard this: it was a
 case of the commander-in-chief being afraid of the soothsayer's words.
 How could he help being alarmed when he heard all this from one of his
 own people? Just when they were all feeling terrified another junior
 devil stepped forward and said, &#8220;Don't be so upset and afraid, Your
 Majesty. As the saying goes, easy does it. If you want to catch the
 Tang Priest let me make you a plan to capture him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What plan?&#8221; the senior demon asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I have a plan to 'divide the petals of the plum blossom.'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean by 'dividing the petals of the plum blossom?'&#8220; the
 demon king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Call the roll of all the devils in the cave,&#8221; the junior devil
 replied. &#8220;Choose the best hundred from all thousand of them, then the
 best ten out of that hundred, and finally the best three out of the
 ten. They must be capable and good at transformations. Have them all
 turn into Your Majesty's doubles, wear Your Majesty's helmet and armor,
 carry Your Majesty's mace, and lie in wait in three different places.
 First send one out to fight Zhu Bajie, then one to fight Sun the Novice
 and finally one to fight Friar Sand. This way you'll only have to spare
 three junior devils to draw the three disciples away. Then Your Majesty
 will be able to stretch down from mid-air with your cloud-grabbing hand
 to catch the Tang Priest. He'll be in the bag. It'll be as easy as
 catching flies in a dish of fish juice. Nothing to it.&#8221;</P>
<P>This suggestion delighted the demon king, who said, &#8220;What a brilliant
 plan, brilliant! If I don't catch the Tang Priest this way, that'll be
 that. But if I do I can assure you you'll be richly rewarded. I'll make
 you commander of the vanguard.&#8221; The junior devil kowtowed to thank him
 for his grace and went off to call the roll of the devils. After all
 the monsters in the cave had been carefully checked through, three
 capable junior devils were selected. They turned into the senior
 devil's doubles and went to lie in wait for the Tang Priest with their
 iron maces.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The venerable Tang elder meanwhile was following Pig along the way
 without a care in the world. When they had been going for some time
 there was a crashing sound from beside the track and out leapt a junior
 devil who rushed straight at them, evidently to grab Sanzang. &#8220;The evil
 spirit's here, Pig,&#8221; Monkey shouted. &#8220;Get him!&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot, who was taken in by the imposture, hacked wildly at the
 devil with his rake. The evil spirit parried Pig's blows with his mace
 as he met the onslaught. While the battle between the pair of them
 ebbed and flowed on the mountainside there was a noise in the
 undergrowth as another monster sprang out and charged at the Tang
 Priest.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is bad, Master,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Pig can't see straight. He's let
 the monster escape to catch you. I'm going to fight him.&#8221; Pulling his
 cudgel out in a flash, he went up to the monster, shouting, &#8220;Where
 d'you think you're going? Take this!&#8221;</P>
<P>Without saying a word the evil spirit raised his mace to meet the
 attack. But while the two of them were locked in combat, swinging at
 each other, there was a howling wind from the other side of the
 mountain and a third evil spirit sprang out who also rushed straight at
 the Tang Priest. When Friar Sand saw it he exclaimed in alarm, &#8220;Master,
 big brother and second brother both can't see straight. They've let the
 evil spirit get away to catch you. Stay on the horse while I get him.&#8221;</P>
<P>Friar Sand was taken in too. Brandishing his staff he blocked the
 evil spirit's iron mace and started a bitter combat. It was a wild
 fight with shouts and awful yells, and they drew further and further
 away. When the demon king saw from up in the sky that the Tang Priest
 was alone on the horse he reached down with his five-clawed steel hook
 and seized him. The master lost horse and stirrups as the evil spirit
 carried him off in a gust of wind. Alas! This was a case of</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the dhyana-nature encountered a monster the true achievement was
 hard;</P>
<P>The monk of the river current met once more with a star of disaster.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Bringing his wind down to land, the demon king took the Tang Priest
 into the cave and called, &#8220;Commander of the vanguard!&#8221;</P>
<P>The junior devil who had made the plan came forward, knelt and said,
 &#8220;I am not worthy.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you say that?&#8221; the demon king replied. &#8220;Once the
 commander-in-chief has spoken, white becomes black. What I said before
 was that if I failed to catch the Tang Priest, that would be that; but
 that if I succeeded I'd make you my commander of the vanguard. Your
 brilliant plan has succeeded today, so there is no reason why I should
 break faith with you. Bring the Tang Priest here and tell the
 underlings to fetch water, scrub the cooking pot, fetch some firewood
 and light the fire. When he's been steamed you and I will each have a
 piece of his flesh and live for ever.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; the commander of the vanguard replied, &#8220;he mustn't be
 eaten yet.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why ever not?&#8221; the demon king asked. &#8220;We've captured him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It wouldn't matter if you ate him, Your Majesty,&#8221; said the commander
 of the vanguard, &#8220;as far as Zhu Bajie and Friar Sand are concerned.
 They would be reasonable. But I'm worried about that Sun the Novice:
 he'd be really vicious. If he found out we'd eaten the Tang Priest he
 wouldn't come to give us a straight fight. He'd just thrust that
 gold-banded cudgel of his into the mountainside and make a hole so big
 that the whole mountain would collapse. We'd be homeless.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you suggest, commander of the vanguard?&#8221; the demon king
 asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;In my opinion,&#8221; the commander replied, &#8220;we should send the Tang
 Priest out to the back garden, tie him to a tree, and starve him for
 two or three days. That will clean him up inside and let us make sure
 that the three disciples don't come here looking for him. Once we've
 found out that they've gone home we can bring the Tang Priest out and
 enjoy him at our leisure. That'd be better, wouldn't it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; the senior demon said with a laugh. &#8220;You're right,
 commander of the vanguard.&#8221;</P>
<P>An order was issued and the Tang Priest taken into the back garden to
 be roped to a tree, while all the junior devils went out to the front
 to keep watch. Look at the venerable elder as he suffers in his bonds,
 tied up tightly and unable to stop the tears rolling down his cheeks.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciples,&#8221; he called, &#8220;where did you chase those demons to when you
 went to capture them in the mountains? I have been captured by a wicked
 ogre and have met with disaster. When will I ever see you again? The
 pain is killing me.&#8221;</P>
<P>Just when the tears from both eyes were joining in a single stream he
 heard someone calling from a tree opposite, &#8220;Venerable elder, you're
 here too.&#8221;</P>
<P>Taking control of himself, the Tang Priest asked, &#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm a woodcutter who lives on this mountain,&#8221; the other replied.
 &#8220;I've been tied up here for three days. I reckon they're going to eat
 me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Woodcutter,&#8221; said the Tang Priest with tears in his eyes, &#8220;If you
 die it will only be you. You have nothing else to worry about. But if I
 die it won't be a clean end.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean, it won't be a clean end, venerable elder?&#8221; the
 woodcutter asked. &#8220;You have no parents, wife or children, so if you die
 that'll be that.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am from the East,&#8221; the Tang Priest replied, &#8220;and was going to
 fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven. I was going on the orders
 of Emperor Taizong of the Tang to worship the living Buddha and fetch
 the true scriptures. This was to save all the lonely souls in the
 underworld who have nobody to care for them. If I lose my life today
 the vain waiting will kill my sovereign and I will let down his
 ministers. Countless wronged souls in the City of the Unjustly Slain
 will suffer a terrible disappointment and never ever be able to escape
 from the wheel of life. The true achievement will all be turned to dust
 in the wind. How can that possibly be considered a clean end?&#8221;</P>
<P>When the woodcutter heard this the tears fell from his eyes as he
 said, &#8220;If you die that is all there to it. But my death will be even
 more painful for me to bear. I lost my father when I was a boy, and
 live alone with my mother. Because we had no property I have had to
 make our living as a woodcutter. My aged mother is eighty-two this year
 and I am her only support. If I die who will there be to bury her? It's
 very hard to bear: the pain of it is killing me.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the venerable elder heard this he began to wail aloud, &#8220;Oh dear,
 oh dear,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Even the mountain man thinks of his mother;</P>
<P>I am reciting the sutras in vain.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Serving one's monarch and serving one's parents are both the same in
 principle. You are moved by your mother's goodness to you and I by my
 sovereign lord's goodness to me.&#8221; This was indeed a case of</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Weeping eyes looking at eyes that weep,</P>
<P>A heartbroken one who sees off one with a broken heart.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>But we will say no more of Sanzang's sufferings as we return to
 Monkey, who after driving the junior devil back down the grassy slope
 rushed back to the track to find that his master had disappeared. All
 that was left were the white horse and the luggage. In his alarm he led
 the horse and shouldered the carrying-pole as he headed for the top of
 the mountain in his search for the master. Oh dear! Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The long-suffering monk of the river current had met with new
 suffering;</P>
<P>The Great Sage, subduer of demons, had run into a demon.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you do not know how his search for his master ended, listen to the
 explanation in the next installment.</P>

</B>
<P>The story tells how the Great Sage Monkey was leading the horse and
 carrying the baggage while he searched the whole mountain top, calling
 out for his master. Suddenly Pig came running up to him, puffing and
 panting, to ask, &#8220;Why are you shouting like that, brother?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The master's disappeared,&#8221; Brother Monkey replied. &#8220;Have you seen
 him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why did you have to play that trick on me when I was being a good
 monk with the Tang Priest?&#8221; Pig asked. &#8220;What was all that about me
 being commander of the vanguard? I had to fight for my life before I
 could beat that evil spirit and come back in one piece. You and Friar
 Sand were looking after the master, so why ask me about it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I don't blame you, brother,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Somehow or other your
 eyes must have gone blurred&#8212;you let the evil spirit get away and come
 back to catch the master again. When I went off to fight it I told
 Friar Sand to look after the master, and he's disappeared too.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I expect he's taken the master somewhere for a crap,&#8221; said Pig with
 a grin, but before he had finished speaking Friar Sand turned up.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where's the master, Friar Sand?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;You two must both be blind,&#8221; retorted Friar Sand, &#8220;letting the evil
 spirit escape to come back for the master. When I went to fight the
 evil spirit the master was left in the horse by himself.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this Monkey leapt with rage, shouting, &#8220;He's fooled me! He's
 fooled me!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How's he fooled you?&#8221; Friar Sand asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;It was a 'dividing the petals of the plum blossom' trick,&#8221; Monkey
 replied, &#8220;to draw us three off so that he could make a blow for the
 heart and carry off the master. Whatever in the name of Heaven are we
 to do?&#8221;</P>
<P>He could not stop the tears from streaming down his cheeks, at which
 Pig said, &#8220;Don't cry. If you cry you're a pustule. He can't be far
 away. He must be on this mountain. Let's look for him.&#8221; The three of
 them had no better plan than to look for him on the mountain. When they
 had covered some six or seven miles they saw a cave palace at the foot
 of a beetling precipice:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Clean-cut pinnacles blocking the light,</P>
<P>Towering and grotesque-shaped rocks.</P>
<P>The fragrance of rate and wonderful flowers,</P>
<P>The beauty of red apricots and green peaches.</P>
<P>The ancient trees in front of the precipice,</P>
<P>Forty spans round, and with bark scarred by frost and rain;</P>
<P>The azure pines standing outside the gates,</P>
<P>Two thousand feet of green blue reaching up to the sky.</P>
<P>Pairs of wild cranes</P>
<P>That dance in the breeze at the mouth of the cave;</P>
<P>Mountain birds in couples</P>
<P>Chirping by day at the ends of the branches.</P>
<P>Clumps of yellow creepers like ropes,</P>
<P>Rows of misty willows with leaves like hanging gold.</P>
<P>Water fills the pools that are square;</P>
<P>All over the mountain are caves that are deep.</P>
<P>In the pools that are square</P>
<P>Dragons lie hidden with scales unchanged.</P>
<P>In the mountain's deep caves</P>
<P>Dwell ogres that long have been eaters of humans.</P>
<P>This can be matched with the lands of immortals,</P>
<P>A den where the winds and the vapors are stored.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Monkey saw this he took two or three paces forward, sprang
 towards the gates and saw that they were shut tight. Above them was a
 horizontal stone tablet on which was written in large letters</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>LINKED RING CAVE:</P>
<P>BROKEN RIDGE:</P>
<P>HIDDEN MISTS MOUNTAIN.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Strike, Pig,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;This is where the evil spirit lives. The
 master must be here.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this the idiot turned vicious, raised his rake, and brought it
 down on the gates with all his strength, smashing a big hole in them
 and shouting, &#8220;Ogre, send my master out at once if you don't want me to
 smash your gates down and finish the lot of you off.&#8221; At this the
 junior devils on the gates rushed back inside to report, &#8220;Disaster,
 Your Majesty.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What disaster?&#8221; the senior demon asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Someone's smashed a hole in the front gates and is yelling that he
 wants his master,&#8221; the junior devils replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;I wonder which one's come looking for him,&#8221; said the demon king in a
 state of great alarm.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be frightened,&#8221; said the commander of the vanguard. &#8220;Let me go
 out and take a look.&#8221; He hurried straight to the front gates, twisted
 his head to one side and craned to look through the hole that had been
 smashed in them. He saw someone with a long snout and big ears.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry, Your Majesty,&#8221; he turned round and shouted at the top
 of his voice, &#8220;it's Zhu Bajie. He's not up to much and he won't dare
 try any nonsense on us. If he does we can open the gates and drag him
 inside to put in the steamer too. The only one to worry about is that
 hairy-cheeked monk with a face like a thunder god.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig when he heard this from outside, &#8220;he's not scared
 of me but he is of you. The master's definitely inside. Come here
 quick.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Evil damned beast,&#8221; said Monkey abusively. &#8220;Your grandfather Monkey
 is here. Send my master out and I'll spare your life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is terrible, Your Majesty,&#8221; the commander of the vanguard
 reported. &#8220;Sun the Novice is here looking for him too.&#8221; At this the
 demon king started complaining, &#8220;It's all because of your
 'petal-dividing' or whatever you called it. You've brought disaster on
 us. How is this going to end?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry, Your Majesty,&#8221; the commander of the vanguard replied,
 &#8220;and don't start grumbling yet. That Sun the Novice is a monkey of
 great breadth of spirit. Although he has such tremendous magical power
 he's partial to flattery. We'll take an imitation human head out to
 fool him with, say a few flattering things to him and tell him we've
 eaten his master already. If we can take him in, the Tang Priest will
 be ours to enjoy. If we can't we'll have to think again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But where are we to get an imitation human head?&#8221; the demon king
 asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll see if I can make one,&#8221; the commander of the vanguard replied.</P>
<P>The splendid ogre then cut a piece of willow root with an axe of pure
 steel into the shape of a human head, spurted some human blood on it
 from his mouth to make it all sticky, and told a junior devil to take
 it to the gates on a lacquer tray, calling, &#8220;My Lord Great Sage, please
 overcome your anger and allow me to address you.&#8221;</P>
<P>Brother Monkey really was partial to being flattered, and when he
 heard himself being addressed as &#8220;My Lord Great Sage&#8221; he grabbed hold
 of Pig and said, &#8220;Don't hit him. Let's hear what he has to say.&#8221;</P>
<P>To this the junior devil with the tray replied, &#8220;When my king took
 your master into the cave the junior devils were naughty and behaved
 very badly. They gobbled and gnawed and grabbed and bit, and ate the
 whole of your master up except his head, which I have here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you've eaten him up, that's that,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Bring the
 head out and let me see whether it's real or false.&#8221; The junior devil
 threw the head out through the hole in the gates, a sight that started
 Pig howling and saying, &#8220;This is terrible. The master went in looking
 one way and he's come out looking like this.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Idiot,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;have a look and find out if it's real before
 you start crying.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're shameless,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;how could there ever be such a thing
 as a fake human head?&#8221;</P>
<P>'This one's a fake,&#8221; Brother Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you tell?&#8221; Pig asked. &#8220;When you throw a real human head it
 lands quietly,&#8221; Monkey explained, &#8220;but when you throw a fake it makes a
 loud noise like a pair of wooden clappers. If you don't believe me,
 I'll throw it for you. Listen!&#8221; He picked the head up and threw it
 against a rock, where it gave a hollow ring.</P>
<P>&#8220;It was loud, brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand.</P>
<P>&#8220;That means it's a fake,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'll make it turn back into
 its real self to show you.&#8221; Producing his gold-banded cudgel in a flash
 he hit the head open. When Pig looked he saw that it was a piece of
 willow root. This was too much for the idiot, who started talking
 abusively.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll get you, you hairy lot,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you may have hidden my
 master in your cave and fooled your ancestor Pig with a piece of willow
 root, but don't imagine that my master is just a willow-tree spirit in
 disguise.&#8221;</P>
<P>The junior devil who was holding the tray was thrown into such a
 panic by this that he ran shaking with fear back to report, &#8220;It's
 terrible, terrible, terrible.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What's so terribly terrible then?' the senior demon asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Zhu Bajie and Friar Sand were taken in, but Monkey's like an antique
 dealer&#8212;he really knows his stuff,&#8221; the junior demon replied. &#8220;He could
 tell it was an imitation head. If only we could give him a real human
 head he might go away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But how are we to get one?&#8221; the senior demon wondered, then
 continued, &#8220;Fetch a human head we haven't eaten yet from the flaying
 shed.&#8221; The devils then went to the shed and choose a fresh head, after
 which they gnawed all the skin off it till it was quite smooth and
 carried it out on a tray.</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord Great Sage,&#8221; the messenger said, &#8220;I am afraid it was a fake
 head last time. But this really is Lord Tang's head. Our king had kept
 it so as to bring good fortune to our cave, but now he's making a
 special offering of it.&#8221; He then threw the head out through the hole in
 the gates, it landed with a thud and rolled on the ground, gory with
 blood.</P>
<P>Seeing that this human head was a real one Monkey could not help
 starting to wail, in which he was joined by Pig and Friar Sand.</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop crying, brother,&#8221; said Pig, holding back his tears. &#8220;This is
 very hot weather, and the head will soon become putrid. I'm going to
 fetch and bury it while it's still fresh. We can cry for him
 afterwards.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right,&#8221; said Monkey, and the idiot cradled the head against
 his chest, not caring about the filth, as he hurried up the cliff till
 he found a South-facing spot where the winds and the natural forces
 were gathered. Here he hacked out a hole with his rake, buried the
 head, and piled a grave-mound over it. Only then did he say to Friar
 Sand, &#8220;You and big brother weep over him while I look for some
 offerings.&#8221;</P>
<P>Going down to the side of a gill, he broke off some willow branches
 and gathered a few pebbles. Taking them back up to the tomb, he planted
 the willow branches on either side and piled the pebbles in front of
 it. &#8220;What's all that about?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The willow branches are used instead of cypresses to shade the
 master's tomb for the time being,&#8221; Pig answered, &#8220;and the pebbles are
 offerings to him instead of cakes.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Cretin!&#8221; Monkey shouted. &#8220;He's already dead. What do you want to go
 offering him stones for?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Just to show what the living feel,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;and out of
 mourning and respect.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You'd better cut that nonsense out,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Tell Friar
 Sand to come here. He can guard the tomb and keep an eye on the horse
 and the luggage while we two go and smash the cave palace up, capture
 the monster and break his body into ten thousand bits. Then we'll have
 avenged the master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're absolutely right, big brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand through his
 tears. &#8220;You two be careful. I'll keep watch here.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Pig then took off his black brocade tunic, tied his
 undershirt tightly, picked up his rake and followed Monkey. The two of
 them rushed straight for the stone gates, and with no more ado they
 smashed them down and shouted with a yell that made the heavens shake,
 &#8220;Give us our Tang Priest back alive!&#8221; This sent the souls flying from
 all the devils old and young in the cave, who complained that the
 commander of the vanguard had wronged them. &#8220;How are we going to deal
 with these monks now they've fought their way in through the gates?&#8221;
 the demon king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The ancients used to say,&#8221; the commander of the vanguard replied,
 &#8220;'Put your hand in a basket of fish and it's bound to stink.' Now we're
 in this we've got to see it through. We'll just have to take our troops
 into battle with these monks.&#8221; When the demon heard this he had no
 alternative but to issue the order, &#8220;Stand together, my little ones.
 Bring your best weapons with you and come with me.&#8221; They then charged
 out through the entrance of the cave with a great war cry.</P>
<P>The Great Sage and Pig quickly fell back a few paces before they held
 the devilish onslaught on a piece of flat ground on the mountainside,
 shouting, &#8220;Who's your best-known boss? Who's the ogre who captured our
 master?&#8221;</P>
<P>The devils had now palisaded their position, over which a
 multicolored embroidered flag flew, and the demon king shouted straight
 back as he held the iron mace, &#8220;Damned monks! Don't you know who I am?
 I'm the Great King of the Southern Mountains, and I've been running
 wild here for hundreds of years. I've eaten your Tang Priest up. What
 are you going to do about it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've got a nerve, you hairy beast,&#8221; retorted Monkey abusively.
 &#8220;How old are you, daring to call yourself after the Southern Mountains?
 Lord Lao Zi was the ancestor who opened up heaven and earth, but even
 he sits on the right of the Supreme Pure One. The Tathagata Buddha is
 the Honoured One who rules the world, and he sits below the Great Roc.
 Confucius the Sage is the Honoured One of the Confucian School, and all
 he's called is Master. So how dare you call yourself Great King of the
 Southern Mountains and talk about running wild for several hundred
 years? Don't move, and take this from your grandfather's cudgel!&#8221;</P>
<P>The evil spirit twisted aside to avoid the cudgel, which he parried
 with his iron mace. &#8220;How dare you try to put me down like that,
 monkey-face,&#8221; said the monster, glaring furiously. &#8220;What kind of powers
 have you got, acting like a maniac at my gates.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll get you, you nameless beast,&#8221; replied Brother Monkey with a
 grin. &#8220;You evidently don't know who I am, so just stand there and make
 yourself brave while I tell you:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>My ancestral home is in the Eastern Continent,</P>
<P>Where heaven and earth nourished me for thousands of years.</P>
<P>On the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit was a magic stone egg;</P>
<P>When the egg broke open my roots were inside.</P>
<P>My birth was not like that of an ordinary being:</P>
<P>My body was formed when sun and moon mated.</P>
<P>1 cultivated myself with formidable effect;</P>
<P>Heaven gave me a perceptive and cinnabar head.</P>
<P>As the Great Sage I dwelt in the palace in the clouds,</P>
<P>Using my strength in a fight against the Dipper and Bull Palace.</P>
<P>A hundred thousand heavenly troops could get nowhere near me;</P>
<P>All the stars in the sky were easily subdued.</P>
<P>My fame resounds throughout the cosmos;</P>
<P>I know all about everything between earth and sky.</P>
<P>Since my conversion to Sakyamuni's teachings</P>
<P>1 have been helping my master on his journey to the West.</P>
<P>When I clear a path through mountains no one can stop me;</P>
<P>My skill at bridging rivers causes demons distress.</P>
<P>In forests I use my power to seize tigers and leopards;</P>
<P>I capture wild beasts bare-handed before sheer cliffs.</P>
<P>For the sake of the East's true achievement I have come to the
 Western Regions;</P>
<P>What evil monster will dare to show itself?</P>
<P>I hate the wicked beasts who have murdered my master;</P>
<P>Their lives will all be ended at this moment.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>These remarks both shocked and infuriated the ogre, who ground his
 teeth, sprang forward and struck at Brother Monkey with his iron mace.
 Monkey blocked it effortlessly with his cudgel and would have said some
 more to him when Pig, unable to restrain himself any longer, started
 swinging wildly at the demon king's commander of the vanguard. The
 commander of the vanguard led his whole force into action, and a hectic
 and splendid battle was fought on that piece of level ground on the
 mountainside:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The monk from the great and superior country in the East</P>
<P>Was going to fetch true scriptures from the Western Paradise.</P>
<P>The great leopard of the Southern mountains breathed out wind and
 clouds</P>
<P>To block their way through the mountains and show off his prowess.</P>
<P>With tricks</P>
<P>And deception</P>
<P>He had foolishly captured the priest from Great Tang.</P>
<P>Then he met Monkey with his tremendous powers</P>
<P>As well as the famous Zhu Bajie.</P>
<P>While the demons fought on level ground in the mountains</P>
<P>Dust clouds arose and darkened the sky.</P>
<P>Above the fray rose the junior devils' roars</P>
<P>As they thrust out wildly with spear and with sword.</P>
<P>On the other side the monks shouted back,</P>
<P>Fighting with rake and with cudgel together.</P>
<P>The Great Sage was a matchless hero,</P>
<P>And Pig in his perfection reveled in his strength.</P>
<P>The ancient ogre of the South,</P>
<P>And his vanguard commander</P>
<P>For the sake of a piece of the Tang Priest's flesh</P>
<P>Were prepared to throw their own lives away.</P>
<P>These two hated them for killing their master:</P>
<P>The other two were set on murder because of the Tang Priest.</P>
<P>The struggle long swayed to and fro,</P>
<P>The clashes and charges yielding no victor.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Monkey realized that the junior devils were fighting so hard
 that repeated attacks were failing to drive them back he used
 body-dividing magic, plucked out a bunch of hairs, chewed them up in
 his mouth, spat the pieces out, called &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned them all
 into his own doubles, each wielding a gold-banded cudgel and fighting
 his way into the cave from the outside. The one or two hundred junior
 devils, unable to cope with their attacks from all sides, all fled for
 their lives back into the cave. Monkey and Pig then fought their way
 back out through the enemy ranks from the inside. The evil spirits who
 had no sense tried to stand up to the rake and found themselves
 bleeding from nine wounds, or resisted the cudgel and had their flesh
 and bones beaten to paste. The Great King of the Southern Mountains was
 so alarmed that he fled for his life on his clouds and wind. The
 commander of the vanguard, who did not know how to do transformations,
 had already fallen to Monkey's club and been revealed as what he really
 was: an iron-backed gray wolf ogre.</P>
<P>Pig went up to him, turned him over by his leg, and said, &#8220;Goodness
 only knows how many piglets and lambs this so-and-so has eaten.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey meanwhile shook himself, put the hair back on his body and
 said, &#8220;No time to lose, idiot. After the demon king! Make him pay for
 the master's life.&#8221; Pig turned back, but all the little Monkeys had
 disappeared.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your magic bodies have all gone, brother,&#8221; he exclaimed.</P>
<P>&#8220;I've taken them back,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Splendid,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;splendid.&#8221; The two of them went back in
 triumph, feeling very pleased.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the senior demon escaped back to the cave he told his underlings
 to move rocks and earth to barricade the front gates. The surviving
 junior demons were all trembling with terror as they barricaded the
 entrance: they would not have dared to stick their heads out again now.
 Monkey led Pig to the gates and shouted without getting any response.
 Pig's rake made no impression when he struck them with it.</P>
<P>Realizing what had happened, Monkey said, &#8220;Don't waste your effort,
 Pig. They've barricaded the gates.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Then how are we going to avenge the master?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Let's go back to his grave and see Friar Sand,&#8221; Brother Monkey
 replied.</P>
<P>When they got back there they found Friar Sand still weeping, at
 which Pig became more miserable than ever, throwing down his rake,
 prostrating himself on the tomb mound and beating the ground with his
 hand as he howled, &#8220;Poor, poor Master. Master from so far away! I'll
 never see you again!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't distress yourself so, brother,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;The evil spirit
 may have barricaded his front gates, but he's bound to have a back
 entrance to go in and out through. You two wait here while I go and
 look for it.</P>
<P>&#8220;Do be careful, brother,&#8221; said Pig through his tears. &#8220;Don't get
 caught yourself too. We could never cope if we had to wail for the
 master then for you by turns. We'd make an awful mess of it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No problem,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I've got my ways of doing things.&#8221;</P>
<P>Putting his cudgel away the splendid Great Sage tightened his kilt,
 stepped out and went back over the mountain. On his way he heard the
 sound of flowing water. When he turned round to look he saw that there
 was a brook flowing down from above him, and beside the gill was a
 gate, to the left of which was a drainpipe from which red water was
 coming out.</P>
<P>&#8220;Goes without saying,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;That must be the back entrance.
 If I go as myself the junior demons may well recognize me when I open
 the door and see them. I'd better turn into a water snake to go in. No,
 hold on. If the master's spirit knows that I've turned into a water
 snake he'll be angry with me as a monk for turning into something so
 long drawn-out. I'd better turn into a little crab. No, that's no good
 either. The master would be cross with me for having too many legs for
 a monk.&#8221; So he turned into a water rat who slipped into the water with
 a soughing sound and went straight to the inner courtyard along the
 drainpipe. Here he thrust his head out for a look around and saw some
 junior devils setting out gobbets of human flesh to dry in a sunny
 spot.</P>
<P>&#8220;Heavens!&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;That must be what they can't finish from the
 master's flesh. No doubt they're drying it to save for a rainy day. If
 I turned back into myself now, went up to them and wiped them out with
 one swing of my cudgel I'd be making myself look brave but stupid. I'll
 do another change, go in to look for the senior devil, and find out
 what's what.&#8221; With that he jumped out of the drain, shook himself, and
 turned himself into a winged ant. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Weak and tiny and known as black colts,</P>
<P>They hide away for many a day till they have wings and can fly.</P>
<P>Casually crossing beside the bridge they draw up their ranks;</P>
<P>They enjoy battles of high strategy under the bed.</P>
<P>Because they know when rain is coming they block their holes</P>
<P>And build their mounds of dust that turn to ashes.</P>
<P>Light they are, and delicate and quick,</P>
<P>Rarely observed as they pass the wicker gate.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He spread his wings and flew straight into the inner hall, unseen and
 unheard. Here the senior demon could be seen sitting very angrily in
 the seat of honour, while a junior devil ran up from behind to report,
 &#8220;Many congratulations, Your Majesty.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What on?&#8221; the senior demon asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I was on lookout by the gill outside the back door just now,&#8221; the
 junior devil replied, &#8220;when suddenly I heard some loud wails. I rushed
 up to the top of the mountain to take a look and saw Zhu Bajie, Sun the
 Novice and Friar Sand all bowing to a grave and weeping bitterly. I
 think they must have taken that head for the Tang Priest's and buried
 it, piled up a grave mound and mourned for it.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey overheard this he said to himself with delight, &#8220;From
 what he's said they've still got the master here and haven't eaten him
 yet. I'll take a look around and find out if he's still alive, then
 have a word with him.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage then flew into the main hall and looked all
 around until he saw a very tiny doorway on one side of it. It was very
 firmly shut, and when he squeezed through the narrow gap between the
 doors he found himself in a big garden in which he could vaguely make
 out the sound of sobbing. Flying further inside he saw a clump of tall
 trees at the foot of which were tied two men. One of these was the Tang
 Priest. As soon as Monkey saw him he felt an itch in his heart that he
 could not scratch.</P>
<P>He could not help turning back into himself, going up to Sanzang and
 calling, &#8220;Master.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the Tang Priest saw who it was he started crying and saying, &#8220;Is
 that you, Wukong? Save me as quickly as you can, Wukong.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't keep saying my name, Master,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;There are
 people at the front and the secret may get out. As you're still alive I
 can rescue you. The ogres said they'd already eaten you and tricked me
 with an imitation human head. Now we're in a bitter struggle with them.
 There's no need to worry, Master. Just stick it out for a little longer
 till I've beaten the evil spirit, then I'll be able to rescue you.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Great Sage said the words of a spell, shook himself, turned into
 an ant again and flew back into the hall, where he landed on the main
 beam. From here he saw the surviving junior devils jostling and
 shouting. One of them sprang out from the crowd and said, &#8220;Your
 Majesty, now they know we've blocked the main gate and they won't be
 able to fight their way in they've given up hope. They've even made a
 tomb for the wrong head. They spent today mourning for him, and they'll
 do the same again tomorrow and the day after. I'm sure they'll go away
 after that. Once we find out that they've split up we can bring the
 Tang Priest out, chop him up into little bits, and fry him with
 aniseed. Then everyone will be able to eat a piece when he's steaming
 hot, and we'll all live forever.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this another junior devil clapped his hands together and said,
 &#8220;No, no, he'd taste much better steamed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Boiling him would save some firewood,&#8221; another put in.</P>
<P>&#8220;He's such a rare and wonderful thing,&#8221; said someone else, &#8220;that we
 ought to salt him down and take our time over eating him.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard all this from up among the beams he thought with
 fury, &#8220;What harm did my master ever do you? Why are you making these
 plans to eat him?&#8221; He pulled out a handful of hairs, chewed them up
 into little pieces, blew them lightly out of his mouth and silently
 recited the words of the spell that turned all the pieces into sleep
 insects. These he threw into the faces of all the devils, and the
 insects crawled up their noses, gradually making the devils feel
 sleepy. Before long the junior devils were all lying stretched out fast
 asleep. The demon king was the only one left fitfully awake as he kept
 rubbing his face and head, sneezing and pinching his nose.</P>
<P>&#8220;Perhaps he knows about how to cope with sleep insects,&#8221; Monkey
 thought. &#8220;I'd better give him a double dose.&#8221; He pulled out a hair,
 made two more sleep insects as before, and threw them into the demon's
 face to crawl up his nose, one up the left nostril and one up the
 right. The demon king jumped to his feet, stretched, yawned twice and
 fell fast asleep, breathing heavily.</P>
<P>Quietly delighted, Monkey then sprang down from the roof and turned
 back into himself. He produced his cudgel from his ear and waved it
 till it was the thickness of a duck egg, then with a loud bang broke
 down the side door, ran into the garden at the back and called out,
 &#8220;Master!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Untie me quick, disciple,&#8221; the venerable elder said. &#8220;Being roped up
 like this has been agony.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Be patient, Master,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;When I've killed the evil spirit
 I'll come and untie you.&#8221; He then hurried back into the hall, lifted
 his cudgel and was about to strike when he stopped and thought, &#8220;No,
 this is wrong. I ought to release the master before I kill the evil
 spirit.&#8221; He went back into the garden, where he changed his mind again:
 &#8220;No, I'll kill the monster first.&#8221; This happened two or three times
 till finally he came dancing back into the garden, where his master's
 grief turned to joy at the sight of him.</P>
<P>&#8220;You monkey,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I suppose it's because you're beside yourself
 with pleasure at seeing me still alive that you're dancing about like
 that.&#8221; Only then did Monkey go up to him, untie him, and help him walk
 away. The man tied to the other tree then called out, &#8220;Please save me
 too in your great mercy, my lord.&#8221;</P>
<P>The venerable elder stopped and said, &#8220;Untie him too, Wukong.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Who's he?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;He was captured and brought here a day before me,&#8221; Sanzang replied.
 &#8220;He's a woodcutter. He tells me his mother is very old and he is most
 worried about her. He is a very dutiful son. You must save him too.&#8221;</P>
<P>Doing as he was bid, Monkey untied the other man and took them both
 out through the back gate, up the scar and across the ravine. &#8220;Thank
 you for rescuing this man and me, worthy disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang.
 &#8220;Where are Wuneng and Wujing?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Mourning for you over there,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;Give them a shout.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang then shouted at the top of his voice, &#8220;Bajie! Bajie!&#8221; The
 idiot, who had been weeping so much that his head was spinning, wiped
 away the snot and tears to call, &#8220;Friar Sand, the master's come back as
 a ghost. That him calling, isn't it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Idiot,&#8221; shouted Monkey, going up to him, &#8220;that's no ghost. It's the
 master himself.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Friar Sand looked up and saw who it was he fell to his knees in
 front of Sanzang and said &#8220;Master, you've suffered terribly. How did
 big brother rescue you?&#8221; Monkey then told them everything that had
 happened.</P>
<P>When Pig heard all this he gnashed his teeth, unable to restrain
 himself from knocking the tomb mound over with one blow of his rake,
 digging out the head and smashing it to pulp &#8220;Why are you hitting it?&#8221;
 the Tang Priest asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;goodness only knows what kind of wretch he was,
 but we all mourned for him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It was thanks to him that I'm still alive,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;When
 you disciples attacked their gates and demanded me they took him out to
 fob you off with. Otherwise they would have killed me. I think we
 should bury him properly as a mark of our monastic respect.&#8221; When the
 idiot heard his master saying this he buried that bag of flesh and bone
 that had been beaten to a pulp and piled up a tomb mound over it.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Brother Monkey with a smile, &#8220;won't you sit here for a
 while while I go to wipe them out?&#8221; With that he leapt down the cliff,
 crossed the ravine, went into the cave and took the ropes with which
 the Tang Priest and the woodcutter had been hound into the hall, where
 he used them to truss together the arms and legs of the demon king, who
 was still asleep. He then lifted the demon up with his cudgel onto his
 shoulder and took him out by the back door.</P>
<P>&#8220;You like making things difficult for yourself, brother,&#8221; said Pig
 when he saw him coming from a distance. &#8220;Why don't you find another to
 balance him?&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey then set the demon king down in front of Pig, who raised his
 rake and was just about to hit him when Monkey said, &#8220;Wait a moment. We
 haven't captured the junior devils in the cave yet.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If there are any left,&#8221; Pig said, &#8220;take me in with you to smash
 them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Smashing them would be too much trouble,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;The best
 thing would be to find some firewood and wipe them out that way.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the woodcutter heard this he led Pig to a hollow to the East to
 find some broken ends of bamboo, pines that had lost their needles,
 hollow stumps of willows, creepers broken off from their roots,
 withered artemisia, old reeds, rushes and dead mulberry. They carried a
 lot of this into the back entrance, where Monkey set it alight and Pig
 fanned the flames with both ears. Then the Great Sage sprang up, shook
 himself and put the sleep-insect hairs back on his body. When the
 junior devils woke up they were all already on fire. Poor things! None
 of them had the faintest chance of surviving. When the whole cave was
 burnt right out the disciples went back to see the master.</P>
<P>When Sanzang saw that the senior demon had woken up and was shouting
 he called, &#8220;Disciples, the evil spirit has come round.&#8221; Pig went up and
 killed him with one blow of his rake, whereupon the ogre turned back
 into his real form as a leopard spirit with a coat patterned like
 mugwort flowers.</P>
<P>&#8220;Leopards with flower-patterned coats can eat tigers,&#8221; Monkey
 observed, &#8220;and this one could turn into a human too. Killing him has
 prevented a lot of serious trouble in future.&#8221; The venerable elder
 could not express his gratitude strongly enough, and he then mounted
 the saddle. &#8220;My home isn't far from here to the Southwest, sirs,&#8221; said
 the woodcutter. &#8220;I invite you to come there to meet my mother and
 accept my kowtows of thanks for saving my life. Then I'll see you
 gentlemen along your way.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang was happy to accept, and instead of riding he walked there
 with his three disciples and the woodcutter. After they had followed a
 winding path to the Southwest for a short distance this is what they
 saw.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Lichen growing across a stone-flagged path,</P>
<P>Wisteria joining across the wicker gate,</P>
<P>Chains of mountains on every side, And a wood full of singing birds.</P>
<P>A dense thicket of pine and bamboo,</P>
<P>Rare and wonderful flowers in profusion.</P>
<P>The place is remote and deep amid the clouds,</P>
<P>A thatched cottage with a bamboo fence.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>While they were still some distance away they could make out an old
 woman leaning on the wicker gate with tears streaming from her eyes,
 weeping and calling to heaven and earth for her son.</P>
<P>As soon as the woodcutter saw his mother he left the Tang Priest
 behind as he rushed straight to the gate, knelt down and said, &#8220;Mother,
 I'm back.&#8221;</P>
<P>Throwing her arms around him the woman said, &#8220;My boy, when you didn't
 come home for days on end I thought the mountain lord must have caught
 you and killed you. I've suffered terrible heartache. If you weren't
 killed why didn't you come back before? Where are your carrying-pole,
 ropes and axe?&#8221;</P>
<P>The woodcutter kowtowed as he replied, &#8220;Mother, the mountain lord did
 capture me and tie me to a tree. I was lucky to escape with my life,
 thanks to these gentlemen. They are arhats sent by the Tang court in
 the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven. This
 gentleman was captured by the mountain lord and tied to a tree as well.
 His three disciples have enormous magic powers. They killed the
 mountain lord with a single blow: he was a leopard with mugwort flower
 spots who had become a spirit. They burnt all the junior devils to
 death, untied the senior gentleman and then untied me too. I owe them a
 tremendous debt of gratitude: but for them your son would certainly be
 dead. Now that the mountain is completely safe I'll be able to walk
 around at night without any danger.&#8221;</P>
<P>After hearing this the old woman came forward to greet Sanzang and
 his disciples, kowtowing at every step. Then she led them in through
 the wicker gate to sit down in the thatched cottage. Mother and son
 next performed endless kowtows as expressions of their gratitude before
 hastily and in a fluster preparing them some vegetarian food as a mark
 of their thanks.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig to the woodcutter, &#8220;I know you're hard up here.
 Just put something simple together for us. Don't go to a lot of trouble
 and effort.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Quite frankly, sir,&#8221; the woodcutter replied, &#8220;we're very poor here.
 We don't have any gill fungus, button mushrooms, peppers or aniseed.
 All we can offer you gentlemen are some wild vegetables.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We're putting you to a lot of trouble,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;Be as quick as
 you can. We're starving.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It'll soon be ready,&#8221; the woodcutter replied, and before long a
 table and stools were set out and wiped clean, and several dishes of
 wild vegetables served:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Tender-scalded day lilies,</P>
<P>White lumps of pickled scallion,</P>
<P>Knotweed and purslane,</P>
<P>Shepherds purse and &#8220;goosegut blossom.&#8221;</P>
<P>The &#8220;swallows stay away&#8221; was delicious and tender;</P>
<P>The tiny fists of beansprouts were crisp and green.</P>
<P>Indigo heads boiled soft,</P>
<P>White-stewed &#8220;dog footprints,&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Cat's ears,&#8221;</P>
<P>Wild turnips,</P>
<P>All with tender and tasty gray noodles.</P>
<P>&#8220;Scissor shafts,&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Oxpool aid,&#8221;</P>
<P>Tipped in the pot with broom purslane.</P>
<P>Broken grain purslane,</P>
<P>And lettuce purslane,</P>
<P>All green, delicious and smooth.</P>
<P>&#8220;Birdflower&#8221; fried in oil,</P>
<P>Superb water-chestnuts,</P>
<P>Roots of reeds and wild-rice stems,</P>
<P>Four kinds of excellent water plants.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wheat-mother,&#8221;</P>
<P>Delicate and finely flavored;</P>
<P>&#8220;Raggedy patches&#8221;</P>
<P>You could never wear.</P>
<P>Under the bitter sesame bed runs a fence.</P>
<P>Sparrows wander around,</P>
<P>Macaques leave their footprints,</P>
<P>Eager to eat it all when fried and piping hot.</P>
<P>Sloping wormwood and green artemisia surround crown daisy
 chrysanthemums;</P>
<P>The moths fly around the buckwheat.</P>
<P>Bald &#8220;goat's ear,&#8221;</P>
<P>Wolfberry fruits,</P>
<P>That don't need oil when combined with dark indigo.</P>
<P>A meal of every kind of wild vegetable</P>
<P>As a mark of the woodcutter's reverent thanks.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When master and disciples had eaten their fill they packed up ready
 to start out again. Not daring to press them to stay, the woodcutter
 asked his mother to come out and bow to them in thanks again. He then
 kowtowed, fetched a club of jujube wood, fastened his clothes tight,
 and came out to see them on their way.</P>
<P>Friar Sand led the horse, Pig carried the shoulder-pole, and Monkey
 followed close behind them while the master put his hands together on
 the back of the horse and said, &#8220;Brother woodcutter, could you kindly
 lead us to the main track? We will take out leave of you there.&#8221;
 Together they then climbed high, went down slopes, skirted ravines and
 negotiated inclines. &#8220;Disciples,&#8221; said the venerable elder thoughtfully
 as he rode,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Since leaving my monarch to come to the West</P>
<P>I have made a long journey across a great distance.</P>
<P>At each river and mountain I have met with disaster,</P>
<P>Barely escaping from monsters and fiends.</P>
<P>My heart has been set on the Three Stores of scriptures,</P>
<P>And my every thought is of Heaven above.</P>
<P>When will my toil and my labor be ended?</P>
<P>When will I go home, my journey completed?&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the woodcutter heard Sanzang saying this he said, &#8220;Don't be so
 downhearted, sir. It's only some three hundred miles West along this
 road to India, the land of paradise.&#8221;</P>
<P>As soon as Sanzang heard this he dismounted and replied, &#8220;Thank you
 for bringing us so far. Now that we are on the main track, please go
 home now, brother woodcutter, and give our respects to your venerable
 mother. We poor monks have no way to reward you for the sumptuous meal
 you gave us just now except by reciting surras morning and evening to
 protect you and your mother and enable both of you to live to be a
 hundred.&#8221; The woodcutter took his leave of them and went back by the
 way he had came. Master and disciples then headed West together.</P>
<P>Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The ogre subdued and wrongs set to right, he escaped from his peril;</P>
<P>Having been shown this kindness he set out on his way with the
 greatest of care.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know how long it was till they reached the Western
 Heaven, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<P>When Heaven Is Offended in Fengxian It Stops the Rain</P>
<P>The Great Sage Urges Goodness and Brings a Downpour</P>
</B>
<P>Deep and mysterious is the Great Way;</P>
<P>What news is there of it?</P>
<P>When revealed it will alarm ghosts and divine beings.</P>
<P>It controls the universe,</P>
<P>Divides darkness and light;</P>
<P>In the world of true happiness there is no competition.</P>

<P>Pearls and jewels emerge,</P>
<P>Shining with every color.</P>
<P>It illuminates all beings that live between heaven and earth;</P>
<P>Those who understand it live as long as mountains and seas.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story tells how Sanzang and his three disciples took their leave
 of the woodcutter on the Hidden Clouds Mountain and hurried along the
 main road. After they had been going for several days they suddenly saw
 a walled and moated city not far before them.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;is that city ahead of us India, do you
 think?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; said Monkey shaking his head. &#8220;Although the Tathagata lives
 in a paradise there are no cities there. It's a great mountain, Vulture
 Peak, on which are the high buildings and halls of Thunder Monastery.
 Even if we've now reached the land of India this isn't where the Buddha
 lives. I don't know how far India is from Vulture Peak. Presumably this
 city is one of the frontier prefectures of India. We'll know when we
 get there.&#8221;</P>
<P>Soon they were outside the city, where Sanzang dismounted to go in
 through the triple gates. Here they found the people destitute and the
 streets deserted. When they reached the market there were many
 black-clad government servants lined up on either side of a number of
 officials wearing their hats and sashes of office and standing under
 the eaves of a building. As the four travelers came along the road
 these men did not give way at all, so Pig in his rough way raised his
 snout and shouted, &#8220;Out of the way! Out of the way!&#8221;</P>
<P>When the men looked up with a start and saw what he looked like their
 bones went soft, their sinews turned numb and they fell over, shouting,
 &#8220;Evil spirits! Evil spirits!&#8221;</P>
<P>This gave the officials standing under the eaves such a fright that
 they were shivering as they bowed and asked, &#8220;Where are you from?&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang, who was worried that his disciples would cause trouble,
 pushed himself forward and said to the men, &#8220;I am a monk sent by His
 Majesty the Great Tang emperor to worship the Lord Buddha and fetch the
 scriptures in the Great Thunder Monastery in the land of India. Our
 journey brings us to this distinguished place, but as we do not know
 its name and have not yet found a place to stay we hope that you
 gentlemen will forgive us if we have caused any offence to your customs
 on entering your city.&#8221;</P>
<P>Only then did the officials return his courtesy and say, &#8220;This is the
 prefecture of Fengxian, one of the frontier prefectures of India.
 Because we have been suffering from drought for years on end the
 marquis has sent us to put up a notice here calling for masters of the
 Dharma to pray for rain and save the people.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where's the notice?&#8221; asked Monkey when he heard this.</P>
<P>&#8220;Here,&#8221; the officials said. &#8220;The arcade has only just been swept
 clean: we haven't posted it yet.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Bring it here and show me,&#8221; said Brother Monkey. The officials then
 opened the notice out and hung it up under the eaves. Monkey and the
 others went up to read it, and this was what was written on it:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Shangguan, Marquis of Fengxian Prefecture in Great India, issues this
 notice to invite enlightened teachers and great masters of the Dharma.
 This country with its prosperous soldiers and people has been afflicted
 with drought for years. Military and civil land alike has been
 devastated; the rivers have dried up and the ditches are empty. There
 is no water in the wells, and the springs have stopped flowing. While
 the rich are barely managing to stay alive, the poor cannot survive. A
 bushel of wheat costs a hundred pieces of silver; a bundle of firewood
 costs five ounces. Girls of ten are being sold for three pints of rice;
 boys of five are being given to whoever will take them. Because the
 city dwellers fear the law they pawn their clothes to buy the
 necessities for survival; but in the countryside thugs rob and eat
 people in order to live. I have therefore issued this notice in the
 hope that wise and worthy men from all around will pray for rain to
 save the people. The will be richly rewarded for their kindness with a
 thousand pieces of silver. This is no empty promise. Let those who
 would take it up come to this notice.</P>
<P>When he had read it Monkey asked the officials, &#8220;What's Shangguan?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Shangguan is our marquis' surname,&#8221; they replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's a very rare surname,&#8221; said Monkey with a laugh.</P>
<P>&#8220;You've never been to school, brother,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;There's a bit at
 the end of the book<I> The Hundred Surnames</I> that goes 'Ouyang and
 Shangguan.'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop this idle chatter, disciples,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;If any of you
 know how to pray for rain, bring them a fall of timely rain and save
 the people from this affliction: that would be a very good thing indeed
 to do. If you cannot, we must be on our way and waste no more time.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What's so difficult about praying for rain?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;I can
 turn rivers upside down, stir up the sea, move the stars and
 constellations about, kick the sky, churn up water in wells, breathe
 out mist and clouds, carry mountains, drive the moon along and summon
 wind and rain. They're all child's play. Nothing to them!&#8221;</P>
<P>When the officials heard this they sent two of their number straight
 to the prefectural offices to report, &#8220;Your Excellency, something very
 splendid indeed has happened.&#8221;</P>
<P>The marquis, who was burning incense and praying silently at the
 time, asked what it was when he heard that something splendid had
 happened. &#8220;We were taking the notice to post at the entrance to the
 market,&#8221; the officials replied, &#8220;when four monks came along who said
 that they have been sent by the Great Tang in the East to the Great
 Thunder Monastery in India to worship the Buddha and fetch the
 scriptures. As soon as they read the notice they said they could bring
 timely rain, which is why we have come here to report.&#8221;</P>
<P>Refusing to take a sedan-chair, horse or large retinue, the marquis
 went on foot in his robes of office straight to the entrance to the
 market in order to invite the strangers with the utmost courtesy to
 pray for rain.</P>
<P>&#8220;His Excellency the marquis is here,&#8221; it was suddenly announced, and
 everybody moved out of the way.</P>
<P>As soon as he saw the Tang Priest the marquis, who showed no fear of
 his hideous disciples, prostrated himself in the middle of the street
 and said, &#8220;I am Marquis Shangguan of Fengxian Prefecture, and I have
 bathed and perfumed myself in order to beg you teachers to pray for the
 rain that will save the people. I implore you in your great mercy to
 give play to your divine powers and bring us deliverance.&#8221;</P>
<P>Returning his courtesies, Sanzang said, &#8220;This is no place to talk. We
 will be able to act when we have gone to a monastery.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please come with me to my humble palace,&#8221; the marquis replied. &#8220;We
 have a pure place there.&#8221;</P>
<P>Master and disciples then led the horse and carried the luggage
 straight to the palace, where they all exchanged greetings and the
 marquis ordered tea and a vegetarian meal. When the food arrived a
 little later Pig ate for all he was worth like a hungry tiger,
 terrifying the waiters, who trembled as they kept coming and going with
 more and more soup and rice. They looked like the figures on one of
 those revolving lanterns, and they could just keep him supplied until
 he had eaten his fill. Only then did he stop.</P>
<P>When the meal was over the Tang Priest expressed his thanks then
 asked, &#8220;How long has the drought lasted here, Your Excellency?&#8221; To this
 the marquis replied,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is a part of the great land of India,</P>
<P>Fengxian Prefecture of which I am governor.</P>
<P>For three years on end we have suffered from drought:</P>
<P>Grass does not grow, and the grain has all died.</P>
<P>Business is hard for rich and for poor;</P>
<P>Nearly all of the families are weeping with grief.</P>
<P>Two thirds of the people have now died of starvation;</P>
<P>The rest barely survive, like a candle flame in the wind.</P>
<P>I have issued a notice for worthies</P>
<P>And am lucky you monks have come to our land.</P>
<P>If you bring the people a whole inch of rain</P>
<P>A thousand in silver will be your reward.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this his face showed his pleasure as he chuckled,
 &#8220;Don't say that, don't say that. If you promise us a reward of a
 thousand pieces of silver you won't get a single drop of rain. But if
 you put it in terms of accumulating merit I'll provide you with plenty
 of rain.&#8221;</P>
<P>The marquis, a thoroughly upright and good man who cared deeply for
 his people, invited Monkey to take the seat of honour, then bowed to
 him and said, &#8220;Teacher, if you really can show us this great compassion
 this humble official will do nothing to offend against morality.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please get up,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;only look after my master well while I
 do the job.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How are you going to do it, brother?&#8221; asked Friar Sand. &#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You and Pig are to must come here and be my assistants outside while
 I summon a dragon to make rain,&#8221; Monkey replied. Pig and Friar Sand did
 as he bade them, and while the three of them went outside the marquis
 burned incense and prayed. Sanzang sat there reciting sutras.</P>
<P>While Monkey recited the spell and said the magic words a dark cloud
 appeared to the East and slowly moved till it was in front of the hall:
 it was Ao Guang, the ancient dragon of the Eastern Sea. Ao Guang then
 put away his cloud feet and turned himself into human form to go up to
 Monkey, bow low to him with full courtesy and ask, &#8220;What have you sent
 for this humble dragon to do, Great Sage?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please rise,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;The only reason why I have troubled
 you to make this long journey is because there has been a drought in
 this prefecture of Fengxian for years on end. I'd like to ask you if
 you couldn't send some rain.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I must inform you, Great Sage,&#8221; the dragon replied, &#8220;that although I
 can make rain I can only act on the orders of Heaven. I would never
 dare come here to make rain on my own authority without Heaven's
 instructions.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As our journey brought us this way I asked you specially to come
 here to make rain and save the people,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;so why are you
 trying to get out of it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'd never dare,&#8221; the dragon king replied. &#8220;I came because you
 summoned me with the magic words, Great Sage, and I'd never dare try to
 get out of it. In the first place I haven't had an edict from Heaven,
 and secondly I haven't brought the magic rain-making generals with me.
 How could I, Great Sage? If you wish to be a savior, you must let me go
 back to the sea to muster my forces while you go to the heavenly palace
 to obtain an imperial edict for a fall of rain and ask the officials in
 charge of water to release us dragons, so that I can make rain in the
 quantities ordered.&#8221;</P>
<P>Accepting the force of his argument, Brother Monkey had to let the
 old dragon go back to the sea. He then told the Tang Priest what the
 dragon king had said.</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case you had better go and do that,&#8221; the Tang Priest said.
 &#8220;But don't be telling lies.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey then told Pig and Friar Sand to look after the master while he
 went up to the heavenly palace. No sooner had the splendid Great Sage
 said he was going than he was out of sight.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where has Lord Sun gone?&#8221; the marquis asked, trembling with shock.</P>
<P>&#8220;He's gone up to Heaven on a cloud,&#8221; replied Pig with a grin. With
 great reverence the marquis then issued an urgent order that all the
 people in the big and little streets of the city, whether nobility,
 high officials, gentry, commoners, soldiers or civilians, were to
 worship dragon-king tablets and set out water urns with sprigs of
 willow in them in front of their gates. They were also to burn incense
 and pray to Heaven.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Once on his somersault cloud Monkey went straight to the Western Gate
 of Heaven, where the Heavenly King Lokapala soon appeared at the head
 of his heavenly soldiers and warriors to greet him and say, &#8220;Great
 Sage, have you fetched the scriptures yet?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Quite soon now,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;We've reached a frontier
 prefecture called Fengxian on the borders of India now. It hasn't
 rained for three whole years there, and the people are suffering
 terribly. I want to pray for rain to save them. I sent for the dragon
 king, but he told me that he couldn't do it on his own authority
 without a heavenly order, which is why I've come to see the Jade
 Emperor to request an edict.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I don't think it's supposed to rain there,&#8221; the heavenly king said.
 &#8220;I heard just now that the marquis of Fengxian had behaved
 disgracefully and offended both Heaven and Earth. His Majesty took it
 badly and immediately had a rice mountain, a flour mountain and a huge
 gold lock set up. It won't rain till all three have been knocked over
 or snapped.&#8221; Not understanding what all this was about, Monkey demanded
 to see the Jade Emperor, and, not daring to stop him, the heavenly king
 let him in.</P>
<P>Going straight to the Hall of Universal Brightness, Brother Monkey
 was met by the four heavenly teachers, who asked, &#8220;What are you here
 for, Great Sage?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;On my journey escorting the Tang Priest I've reached Fengxian
 Prefecture on the frontiers of India, where there is a drought,&#8221; Monkey
 replied. &#8220;The marquis there has been asking for magicians to pray for
 rain. I sent for the dragon king to order him to make rain, but he said
 that he could not do so on his own authority without an edict from the
 Jade Emperor. I have now come to request an edict in order to relieve
 the people's suffering.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But it's not supposed to rain there,&#8221; said the four heavenly
 teachers.</P>
<P>&#8220;As to whether it's supposed to rain or not,&#8221; said Monkey with a
 smile, &#8220;could I trouble you to take me in to submit a memorial so that
 I can find out whether I can still get a favour done?&#8221;</P>
<P>To this the heavenly teacher Ge Xianweng replied, &#8220;As the saying
 goes, 'a fly that needs a net for a veil&#8212;what a nerve!'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't talk nonsense,&#8221; said Xu of Jingyang. &#8220;Just take him in.&#8221;</P>
<P>Qiu Hongji, Zhang Daoling, Ge and Xu took Monkey to the outside of
 the Hall of Miraculous Mist, where they reported, &#8220;Your Majesty, Sun
 Wukong has reached Fengxian Prefecture in India and wants to obtain
 rain. He has come to ask for an edict.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Three years ago,&#8221; the Jade Emperor replied, &#8220;on the twenty-fifth day
 of the twelfth month, when we were inspecting the myriad heavens and
 travelling through the three worlds, we arrived at his city. We saw
 that Shangguan was most wicked; he knocked over the vegetarian
 offerings to heaven to feed to dogs, spoke foully, and was guilty of
 lese-majeste. That is why we set up those three things in the Hall of
 Fragrance. Take Sun Wukong to see them. When those three things have
 been accomplished we will issue our edict; but if they are not, then do
 not meddle in what does not concern you.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the four heavenly teachers led Brother Monkey to the Hall of
 Fragrance he saw a mountain of rice about a hundred feet high and a
 mountain of flour about two hundred feet high. Beside the rice mountain
 was a chicken the size of a fist eating the rice, sometimes with quick
 pecks, sometimes with slow ones. Beside the flour mountain was a
 golden-haired Pekinese licking the flour, sometimes with long licks and
 sometimes with short ones. To the left of it a golden padlock about one
 foot three or four inches long hung from an iron frame. The crossbar of
 the lock was about the thickness of a finger, and under it was a lamp,
 the flame of which was heating the bar.</P>
<P>Not understanding what all this was about, Monkey turned back to ask
 the heavenly teachers, &#8220;What does it mean?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When that wretch offended Heaven the Jade Emperor had these three
 things set up,&#8221; the heavenly teachers replied. &#8220;That place will only be
 due for rain when the chicken has eaten all the rice, the dog has
 licked up all the flour, and the lamp has melted the bar of the lock.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he went pale with shock, and he dared make no
 more memorials to the throne. He left the palace hall overcome with
 embarrassment. &#8220;Don't take it so badly, Great Sage,&#8221; said the four
 heavenly teachers with smiles. &#8220;This is something that can be resolved
 through goodness. Once a single kind thought moves Heaven the rice and
 flour mountains will collapse and the bar of the padlock will be
 broken. If you can persuade the marquis to return to goodness then
 blessings will come of themselves.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey accepted their advice, and instead of going back to the Hall
 of Miraculous Mist to take his leave of the Jade Emperor he headed
 straight down to the lower world and its ordinary mortals. Within an
 instant he was at the Western Gate of Heaven, where he saw Heavenly
 King Lokapala again, who asked, &#8220;Did you get the decree you wanted?&#8221;
 Monkey told him about the rice and flour mountains and the metal lock.</P>
<P>&#8220;What you said to me was quire right,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;The Jade
 Emperor refuses to issue a decree. Just now the heavenly teachers told
 me as they saw me off that the secret of blessings lay in persuading
 that so-and-so to return to goodness.&#8221; With that Monkey took his leave
 and went down to the lower world on his cloud.</P>
<P>When the marquis, Sanzang, Pig, Friar Sand and the officials high and
 low all welcomed him back they crowded round him asking questions.
 Monkey then shouted at the marquis, &#8220;It's all because on the
 twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month three years ago you offended
 Heaven and Earth that the people are suffering, you wretch. That's why
 rain won't be sent now.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this the marquis was so alarmed that he fell to his knees,
 prostrated himself on the ground and asked, &#8220;How do you know about what
 happened three years ago, teacher?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why did you knock the vegetarian offerings to Heaven over to feed to
 dogs?&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;You'd better tell me the truth.&#8221;</P>
<P>Not daring to conceal anything, the marquis said, &#8220;On the
 twenty-fifth of the twelfth month three years ago I was making
 offerings to Heaven within the palace. As my wife was wicked we
 quarreled and said bad things to each other. In an unthinking outburst
 of fury I knocked over the table with the offerings and scattered the
 vegetarian food. It's true that I called the dogs to eat it up. I never
 realized that Heaven would take offence at this and harm the common
 people. For the last couple of years it has been preying on my mind. My
 thoughts have been disturbed, and I haven't been able to understand
 why. I never realized that it was because Heaven had taken offence that
 it was inflicting this disaster on the common people. Now that you have
 come down to visit us, teacher, I beg you to enlighten me on what the
 upper world intends to do.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That happened to be a day on which the Jade Emperor was visiting the
 lower world,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;When he saw you feed the vegetarian food
 to the dogs and heard your foul language the Jade Emperor set three
 things up to remember you by.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What three things, brother?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;In the Hall of Fragrance he had set up a rice mountain about a
 hundred feet high and a flour mountain about two hundred feet high.
 Beside the rice mountain is a chicken the size of a fist who's eating
 it with quick pecks and slow pecks. Beside the flour mountain is a
 golden-haired Pekinese licking the flour up with long licks and short
 licks. And to the left is an iron frame from which hangs a golden
 padlock with a crossbar the thickness of a finger under which a lamp is
 burning and warming the bar. You will only be due for rain here
 when-the chicken's eaten all the rice, the dog's licked up all the
 flour and the lamp has melted the bar of the lock.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No problem,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;no problem. If you take me with you,
 brother, I can do a transformation, eat all the rice and flour up in
 one sitting and snap the bar of the lock. I can guarantee rain.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't talk nonsense, you idiot,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;This is a plan that's
 been made by Heaven. You'll never be able to get there.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;From what you say I don't know what to do,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's easy,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;easy. As I was leaving the four heavenly
 teachers said to me that this could only be solved through goodness.&#8221;</P>
<P>The marquis then prostrated himself on the ground again and said
 imploringly, &#8220;I will do just as you tell me, teacher.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If your heart can turn back to goodness,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;I hope
 that you'll at once start invoking the Buddha and reciting scriptures.
 Then I'll be able to help you. If you persist in refusing to reform
 there'll be nothing I can do to get you off. It won't be long before
 Heaven executes you, and your life will be beyond saving.&#8221;</P>
<P>The marquis kowtowed in worship, swearing to return to the faith. At
 once he summoned all the Buddhist and Taoist clergy in the city and
 ordered that a site be prepared for religious ceremonies. They were all
 to write out documents and memorials for three days. The marquis led
 his followers in burning incense and worshipping, thanking Heaven and
 Earth and repenting of his sins. Sanzang recited surras on his behalf.
 At the same time urgent notices were sent out ordering all the men and
 women, young and old, in all the households inside and outside the city
 to burn incense sticks and invoke the Buddha. From that moment on all
 ears were filled with virtuous sounds. Only then did Brother Monkey
 feel happy.</P>
<P>&#8220;You two look after the master,&#8221; he said to Pig and Friar Sand,
 &#8220;while I go off for him again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you going this time, brother?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The marquis really believed what I told him and is being reverent,
 good and kind,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and he's sincerely invoking the
 Buddha's name. So I'm going back to submit another request for rain to
 the Jade Emperor.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you're going, don't lose any time, brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand.
 &#8220;This is holding us up on our journey. But do get a fall of rain: it'll
 be another true achievement for us.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage set his cloud off once more and went straight
 to the gate of Heaven, where he met Heavenly King Lokapala again.</P>
<P>&#8220;What have you come for now?&#8221; Lokapala asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The marquis has mended his ways,&#8221; Monkey replied, which pleased the
 Heavenly King. As they were talking the Straight Spell Messenger
 arrived at the gate of Heaven to deliver letters and documents written
 by Taoist and Buddhist clergy.</P>
<P>When he saw Monkey the messenger bowed and said, &#8220;This is all the
 result of your successful conversion, Great Sage.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you taking those letters?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Straight to the Hall of Universal Brightness,&#8221; the messenger
 replied, &#8220;to give to the heavenly teachers to pass on to the Great
 Heavenly Honoured One, the Jade Emperor.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case you'd better go first and I'll follow,&#8221; Monkey said.
 The messenger then went in through the heavenly gate. &#8220;Great Sage,&#8221;
 said Heavenly King Lokapala, &#8220;there's no need for you to go to see the
 Jade Emperor. You should go to borrow some thunder gods from the Office
 of Response to the Primary in the Ninth Heaven, then set off thunder
 and lightning. After that there'll certainly be rain.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey accepted this suggestion and went in through the gate of
 Heaven. Instead of going to the Hall of Miraculous Mist to ask for an
 edict he at once turned his cloud-treading steps towards the Office of
 Response to the Primary in the Ninth Heaven, where the Envoy of the
 Thunder Gate, the Corrector of Records and the Inspector of Probity
 appeared to bow and say, &#8220;Why are you here, Great Sage?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's something I'd like to see the Heavenly Honoured One about,&#8221;
 Monkey replied, and the three envoys passed this on in a memorial to
 the Heavenly Honoured One, who then came down from behind his screen of
 red clouds and nine phoenixes in full court dress.</P>
<P>When they had exchanged greetings Monkey said, &#8220;There is something I
 would like to request of you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What might that be?&#8221; the Heavenly Honoured One asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;While escorting the Tang Monk I have reached the prefecture of
 Fengxian,&#8221; said Brother Monkey, &#8220;and as they have long been suffering
 from drought there I promised to make it rain for them. The reason I
 have come here is to ask for the loan of some of your subordinate
 officials and generals in order to ask for rain.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am aware that three things have been set up because the marquis
 there offended Heaven,&#8221; the Heavenly Honoured One replied, &#8220;but I have
 not yet heard that rain is due to fall there.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When I went to ask the Jade Emperor for an edict yesterday,&#8221; Monkey
 replied with a smile, &#8220;he told the heavenly teachers to take me to see
 the three things in the Hall of Fragrance: the mountain of rice, the
 mountain of flour and the golden lock. Rain isn't due to fall till
 these three things have been knocked down or broken. When I was feeling
 very upset because it was so difficult the heavenly teachers advised me
 to persuade the marquis and his people to do good deeds because Heaven
 is bound to help anyone who has a good thought. So there's a good
 chance of persuading Heaven to change its mind and delivering them from
 this disaster. Now good thoughts are happening everywhere, and all ears
 are filled with good sounds. Not long ago the Straight Spell Messenger
 took letters showing that they had mended their ways and turned towards
 goodness to the Jade Emperor, which is why I've come to your
 illustrious palace to ask for the help of your thunder officials and
 thunder generals.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; the Heavenly Honoured One replied, &#8220;I'll send Deng,
 Xin, Zhang and Tao to take Mother Lightning and go with you to Fengxian
 Prefecture to make thunder, Great Sage.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before long the four generals and the Great Sage had reached the
 boundaries of Fengxian and started performing their magic in mid air. A
 great ramble of thunder could be heard, and there were sizzling flashes
 of lightning. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The lightning was like snakes of purple gold;</P>
<P>The thunder was like the noise of sleeping insects awakened.</P>
<P>Flashes of light like flying fire,</P>
<P>Thunderclaps like landslides in the mountains.</P>
<P>The jagged lines lit up the whole of the sky;</P>
<P>The great noise caused the earth itself to move.</P>
<P>When the red silk flashed like sprouts of plants</P>
<P>Rivers and mountains shook for three thousand miles.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Inside and outside the city of Fengxian nobody, whether an official
 high or how, a soldier or a civilian had heard thunder or seen
 lightning for three whole years; and now that the thunder was booming
 and the lightning flashing they all fell to their knees, put incense
 burners on their heads, held sprigs of willow in their hands and said,
 &#8220;We submit to Amitabha Buddha. We submit to Amitabha Buddha.&#8221; These
 good thoughts had indeed moved Heaven, as is proved by an old-style
 poem:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When thoughts have been born in human minds</P>
<P>Heaven and earth will both be aware.</P>
<P>If evil and good do not get their due</P>
<P>Sides have been taken by powers up there.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We will for the moment leave the Great Sage Monkey directing the
 thunder generals as they unleashed thunder and lightning over Fengxian
 Prefecture, where everyone had turned back to goodness, and tell how
 the Straight Spell Messenger took the Taoist and Buddhist documents
 straight to the Hall of Universal Brightness, where the four heavenly
 teachers submitted them to the Jade Emperor in the Hall of Miraculous
 Mist.</P>
<P>When the Jade Emperor had seen them he said, &#8220;As that wretch has had
 some virtuous thoughts, see what has happened to the three things.&#8221;
 Just as he was speaking the official in charge of the Hall of Fragrance
 came in to report, &#8220;The rice and flour mountains have collapsed: the
 rice and flour all disappeared in an instant. The bar of the lock has
 also been broken.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before he could finish submitting this memorial the heavenly official
 in attendance led in the local deity, the city god and the gods of the
 altars from Fengxian, who all bowed and reported, &#8220;The lord of our
 prefecture and every member of every household, high and low, of the
 people have been converted to the true achievement and are worshipping
 the Buddha and Heaven. We now beg you in your compassion to send a
 widespread fall of timely rain to deliver the common people.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the Jade Emperor heard this he was very pleased, so he issued an
 edict: &#8220;Let the departments of wind, cloud and rain go to the lower
 world in accordance with orders. At this hour on this day the clouds
 are to be spread, the thunder shall roar, and three feet and forty-two
 drops of rain shall fall.&#8221; At once the four heavenly teachers
 transmitted the edict to the weather departments, who were all to go to
 the lower world, show their powers and act together.</P>
<P>Monkey was enjoying himself up in the sky with Deng, Xin, Zhang and
 Tao, who were ordering Mother Lightning about, when the arrival of all
 other gods filled the sky with their assembly. As the wind and the
 clouds met, the timely rain began to pour down.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Thick, heavy clouds,</P>
<P>Lowering black mists,</P>
<P>The rumbling of the thunder cart,</P>
<P>The searing flash of lightning,</P>
<P>A roaring gale,</P>
<P>A torrential downpour.</P>
<P>Indeed, when one thought goes up to Heaven</P>
<P>Ten thousand hopes are all fulfilled.</P>
<P>Because the Great Sage has used his powers</P>
<P>The landscape is darkened for thousands of miles.</P>
<P>The wonderful rain falls like rivers and seas,</P>
<P>Hiding the country and heavens from sight.</P>
<P>Water comes pouring down the eaves,</P>
<P>Noisily pounding outside the windows.</P>
<P>While every household invokes the Buddha</P>
<P>All of the streets and markets are flooded.</P>
<P>To East and West every channel is filled;</P>
<P>Winding streams meander to North and to South.</P>
<P>Dried-up shoots receive moisture,</P>
<P>Withered trees revive.</P>
<P>The hemp and wheat now flourish in the fields;</P>
<P>Beans and other grains grow in the countryside.</P>
<P>Traders happily travel to sell their wares;</P>
<P>Cheerful peasants get ready to work.</P>
<P>After this the millet will do well,</P>
<P>And the crops are bound to yield a bumper harvest.</P>
<P>When wind and rain are timely the people know content;</P>
<P>When rivers and seas are calm the world is at peace.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>That day three feet and forty-two drops of rain fell, after which all
 the gods began to tidy up and go away. &#8220;Gods of the four departments,&#8221;
 yelled the Great Sage at the top of his voice, &#8220;stay there for a moment
 with your cloud followers while I tell the marquis to bow to you all
 and express his thanks. You may part the clouds and appear in your true
 forms to let this mortal see you with his own eyes. That's the only way
 he'll believe and make offerings.&#8221; When the gods heard this they all
 stayed where they were up in the clouds.</P>
<P>Monkey then brought his cloud down to land and went straight into the
 prefectural palace, where Sanzang, Pig and Friar Sand all greeted him.
 The marquis kowtowed to him in thanks at every pace he took.</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop thanking me,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I've asked the gods of the four
 departments to stay. Could you tell everyone to come here to kowtow and
 thank them so that they'll make it rain properly in future?&#8221; The
 marquis issued urgent orders summoning everyone to give thanks, and
 they all kowtowed with incense-sticks in their hands. The gods of the
 four departments&#8212;rain, thunder, cloud and wind&#8212;then parted the clouds
 and revealed themselves in their true form.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The dragon king appeared,</P>
<P>The thunder generals were revealed,</P>
<P>The clouds boys were seen,</P>
<P>The lords of the wind came down.</P>
<P>The dragon king appeared:</P>
<P>With silver whiskers and an azure face he was really peerless.</P>
<P>The thunder generals were revealed</P>
<P>With their countenances of matchless might and crooked mouths.</P>
<P>The cloud boys were seen</P>
<P>Wearing gold crowns over faces like jade.</P>
<P>The lords of the wind came down</P>
<P>With flustered brows and bulging eyes.</P>
<P>All were displayed on the azure clouds</P>
<P>Drawn up in ranks with their holy countenances.</P>
<P>Only then were the people of Fengxian convinced</P>
<P>As they kowtowed, burned incense and rejected evil.</P>
<P>Today they gazed up at the heavenly generals,</P>
<P>Washing their hearts as they all turned to goodness.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The gods stood there for two hours as the people kowtowed to them
 endlessly. Monkey rose up into the clouds again to bow to all the gods
 and say, &#8220;I've put you to great trouble. All you gentlemen may now
 return. I'll make everyone in this prefecture give pure and lofty
 offerings to thank you at the due season. From now on you gentlemen
 must send wind every five days and rain every ten days to help them
 out.&#8221; The gods all consented as he told them and returned to their own
 departments.</P>
<P>Bringing his cloud down to land, Monkey said to Sanzang, &#8220;Now that
 the job's been done and the people given peace we can pack our things
 and be on our way again.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the marquis heard this he hastened to bow and say, &#8220;How can you
 say such a thing, Lord Sun? What has happened today has been an
 infinitely great act of kindness. I have sent people to prepare a
 humble banquet to thank you for your great kindness. Then I will buy
 some land from the people to build a monastery for you, my lords, with
 a shrine to you with inscribed tablets where offerings can be made in
 all four seasons. Even if I were to carve my own bones and heart it
 would be hard to repay a ten thousandth part of what I owe you. You
 can't possibly leave.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What Your Excellency says is very fine,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;but we
 are pilgrim monks who can only put up for the night on our journey
 West. We cannot stay here long. We definitely must leave in a day or
 two.&#8221; The marquis refused to let them go, and he ordered many people to
 prepare a banquet and start building a monastery that very night.</P>
<P>The next day there was a magnificent banquet at which the Tang Priest
 took the place of honour while the Great Sage Monkey sat beside him
 with Pig and Friar Sand. The marquis and his officials high and low
 passed them cups of wine and dishes of food while fine music was
 played, and so they were entertained all day. It was a most happy
 occasion, and there is a poem to prove it:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After long drought the fields received sweet rain;</P>
<P>Merchants were travelling along all watercourses.</P>
<P>They were deeply moved by the monks who had come to the city,</P>
<P>And by the Great Sage who had gone up to Heaven.</P>
<P>The three things had now been accomplished;</P>
<P>One thought had brought all back to the good.</P>
<P>From now on all longed for a new golden age</P>
<P>With ideal weather and good harvests for ever.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The banquets went on for days, as did the giving of thanks, until
 they had been kept there for almost half a month. All that remained to
 do was complete the monastery and the shrine. One day the marquis
 invited the four monks to go to inspect them.</P>
<P>&#8220;How did you complete so enormous a project so quickly?&#8221; asked the
 Tang Priest in astonishment.</P>
<P>&#8220;I pressed the laborers to work night and day without stopping and
 insisted most urgently that they finish quickly,&#8221; the marquis replied.
 &#8220;Now I would like you gentlemen to come and inspect it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You certainly are a most good and able marquis,&#8221; said Monkey with a
 smile. By now they had all reached the new monastery, where they were
 full of admiration for the towering halls and the majestic entrance.
 Monkey asked Sanzang to name the monastery.</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; Sanzang said, &#8220;I name it the Monastery of Salvation by
 Timely Rain.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Splendid,&#8221; said the marquis, &#8220;splendid.&#8221; He then issued a golden
 invitation to monks from far and wide to come to burn incense there. To
 the left of the Buddha hall was a shrine to the four pilgrims at which
 offerings were to be made in each of the four seasons every year.
 Temples had also been built for the thunder gods and dragon gods to
 thank them for their divine efforts. When the visit was over Sanzang
 ordered an early departure.</P>
<P>When the local people realized that the monks could be persuaded to
 stay no longer they all prepared parting gifts, none of which the
 travelers would accept. Then all the officials in the prefecture
 escorted them on their way for ten miles with a band playing and a
 great display of flags and canopies. Still loath to let the travelers
 go, the officials watched with tears in their eyes till they had
 disappeared from sight. Only then did the officials return to the city.
 Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The virtuous and holy monk left behind the Salvation Monastery;</P>
<P>The Great Sage Equaling Heaven dispensed great kindness.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know how many more days after this departure it was that
 they finally saw the Tathagata Buddha, listen to the explanation in the
 next installment.</P>

</I>
<P>When the Dhyana Reaches Yuhua a Display of Magic Is Given</P>
<P>The Mind-Ape and the Mother of Wood Take Their Own Disciples</P>
</B>
<P>The story tells how after happily taking their leave of the marquis
 the Tang Priest turned to Monkey as he rode and said, &#8220;Worthy disciple,
 this good result was even better than rescuing the babies in
 Bhiksuland, and it was all your achievement.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In Bhiksuland you only saved 1,111 little boys,&#8221; said Friar Sand.
 &#8220;That's no comparison with this heavy, soaking rain that's saved tens
 of thousands of lives. I've been quietly admiring my big brother's
 magical powers that extend right up to the heavens, as well as his
 mercy that covers the whole earth.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Merciful and good our big brother may be,&#8221; said Pig with a laugh,
 &#8220;but it's just a show of being kind. Inside he's a troublemaker. When
 he's with me he treats me like dirt.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When have I ever treated you like dirt?&#8221; Monkey protested. &#8220;Often
 enough,&#8221; replied Pig. &#8220;You're always seeing to it that I get tied up,
 hung up, boiled and steamed. After being so kind to all those tens of
 thousands of people in Fengxian you should have stayed there for half a
 year and let me have a few more good filling meals. Why did you have to
 be sending us on our way?&#8221;</P>
<P>When the venerable elder heard this he shouted, &#8220;You idiot! Can you
 think of nothing but your greed? Stop quarrelling and be on your way.&#8221;
 Daring say no more, Pig thrust out his snout, shouldered the luggage,
 and followed the master and his fellow disciples along the road,
 laughing loudly.</P>
<P>Time moved as fast as a shuttle, and soon it was late autumn. What
 could be seen was,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The end of ripples on the waters,</P>
<P>The mountains' bones looking lean.</P>
<P>Red leaves fly around,</P>
<P>In the time of yellowing flowers.</P>
<P>Under the clear and frosty sky the nights seem longer;</P>
<P>The moon shines white through the windows.</P>
<P>Many the household fires in the evening light;</P>
<P>The water gleams cold all over the lake.</P>
<P>The clover fern is now white,</P>
<P>While knotweed blooms red.</P>
<P>Mandarins are green and oranges yellow;</P>
<P>Willows are withering and the millet is ripe.</P>
<P>Beside the desolate village wild geese land among the reeds;</P>
<P>Cocks call by the country inn while the beans are harvested.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the four of them had been travelling for a long time they saw
 the towering shape of a city wall. &#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said Sanzang, waving his
 riding-crop, &#8220;you can see there's another city there. I wonder where it
 is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Neither of us have ever been here before,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;so how
 could I know? Let's go ahead and ask.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before the words were out of his mouth an old man appeared from among
 some trees. He was leaning on a stick, lightly dressed with coconut
 sandals on his feet and had a sash round his waist. The Tang Priest
 hastily dismounted and went over to greet the old man.</P>
<P>Returning his greeting as he leaned on his stick, the old man asked,
 &#8220;Where are you from, reverend sir?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am a poor monk sent by the Tang court in the East to worship the
 Buddha in the Thunder Monastery and fetch the scriptures,&#8221; the Tang
 Priest replied, putting his hands together in front of his chest. &#8220;Now
 that I have come to this distinguished place I wonder which city it is
 that I can see in the distance, and I would ask you, venerable
 benefactor, to inform me.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the old man heard this he replied, &#8220;Enlightened master of the
 dhyana, this humble place of ours is Yuhua County in one of the
 prefectures of India. The lord of our city is a member of the king of
 India's royal family who has been made prince of Yuhua. He is a very
 worthy prince who respects both Buddhist and Taoist clergy and cares
 deeply for the common people. If you go to see him he will certainly
 treat you with great respect.&#8221; Sanzang thanked the old man, who went
 off through the woods.</P>
<P>Sanzang then turned back to tell his disciples what had happened. The
 three of them were happily going to help the master back on his horse
 when Sanzang said, &#8220;It's not far. There is no need to ride.&#8221; The four
 of them then walked to a street beside the city wall to take a look.
 This was an area where traders lived; it was crowded with people and
 business was good. The people looked and sounded no different from
 those of China. &#8220;Be careful, disciples,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;On no account
 must you act wild.&#8221;</P>
<P>At that Pig bowed his head and Friar Sand covered his face, leaving
 only Monkey to support the master. On both sides of the road people
 were crowding in to look at them, shouting, &#8220;We only have eminent monks
 who subdue dragons and tigers here. We've never seen monks who subdue
 pigs and monkeys before.&#8221; This was more than Pig could stand.</P>
<P>Thrusting his snout at them he said, &#8220;Have you ever seen a monk in
 all your life who subdued the king of the pigs?&#8221; This gave all the
 people in the street so bad a fright that they fell back on both sides
 of them stumbling and tripping over, trying to get away.</P>
<P>&#8220;Put that snout away at once, you idiot,&#8221; said Monkey with a grin,
 &#8220;and don't try to make yourself look pretty. Just pay attention while
 you're crossing the bridge.&#8221; The idiot lowered his head and kept
 grinning. Once over the drawbridge they entered the city, where the
 main roads were bustling and prosperous with bars and houses of
 entertainment. It was indeed a city in a divine region, and there is a
 poem to prove it that goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>An eternally iron-strong city like splendid brocade,</P>
<P>Full of fresh color, lying next to a river near mountains,</P>
<P>Connected by boat with lakes for the movement of goods.</P>
<P>A thousand wine-shops await behind curtains.</P>
<P>Everywhere smoke rises from towering buildings;</P>
<P>Each morning the lanes are filled with the hubbub of traders.</P>
<P>The look of the city was much like Chang'an:</P>
<P>Cock-crows and the barking of dogs were all just the same.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have heard tell of the foreigners in the West,&#8221; Sanzang thought
 with secret delight, &#8220;but I have never come here before. On close
 examination it is no different from our Great Tang. This must be what
 is meant by paradise.&#8221; When he learned that a bushel of hulled rice
 cost only four tenths of an ounce of silver and a pound of sesame oil
 only eight thousandths of an ounce of silver he realized that this
 truly was a place where crops grew in abundance.</P>
<P>After walking for quite a long time they reached the prince of
 Yuhua's palace. On either side of the palace gates were the office of
 the remembrancer, the law courts, the prince's kitchens and the
 government hostel.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciples,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;here is the palace. Wait while I go
 inside for the prince to inspect our passport and let us on our way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We can't very well stand at the gates while you go in, Master,&#8221; said
 Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;Can you not see 'Government Hostel' written over that gateway?&#8221;
 Sanzang asked. &#8220;Go and sit there and see if you can buy some fodder for
 the horse. If the prince offers me a meal when I have my audience with
 him I will send for you to share it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Go on in, Master, and don't worry,&#8221; said Brother Monkey. &#8220;I can
 cope.&#8221; Friar Sand carried the luggage into the hostel, where the staff
 were so alarmed by their hideous faces that they did not dare ask them
 any questions or send them away but could only invite them to sit down.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the master changed his habit and hat and went straight into
 the prince's palace with the passport in his hands. Soon he was met by
 a protocol officer who asked, &#8220;Where are you from, reverend sir?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am a monk sent by the Great Tang in the East to worship the Lord
 Buddha and fetch the scriptures in the Great Thunder Monastery,&#8221;
 Sanzang replied. &#8220;Now that I have reached this distinguished place I
 would like to have my passport inspected and returned, which is why I
 have come to seek an audience with His Royal Highness.&#8221; The protocol
 officer passed this on, and as the prince was indeed an enlightened one
 he sent for Sanzang at once.</P>
<P>Sanzang bowed in greeting before the prince's hall, and the prince
 invited him into the hall to sit down. When the prince read the
 passport that Sanzang handed him and saw the seals and signatures from
 so many countries on it he signed it himself, folded it up and put it
 on his table. &#8220;Venerable Teacher of the Nation,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you have
 passed through many countries on your way here from Great Tang. How
 long has your journey taken?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have kept no record of the distance,&#8221; Sanzang said, &#8220;but some
 years ago the Boddhisattva Guanyin appeared to me and left an address
 in verse in which it was said that the road would be sixty thousand
 miles long. I have already seen fourteen winters and summers on my
 journey.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That means fourteen years,&#8221; the prince replied. &#8220;I should imagine
 that there were many delays along the way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It would be hard to tell of them all,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;There were
 thousands of monsters and I don't know how much suffering to be endured
 before I could reach here.&#8221; The prince was so pleased with his visitor
 that he ordered his kitchens to prepare a vegetarian meal for him.</P>
<P>&#8220;I wish to inform Your Royal Highness that I have three disciples,&#8221;
 Sanzang said. &#8220;As they are waiting outside I will not be able to delay
 our journey by accepting the meal.&#8221; The prince then ordered his aides
 to go straight out to invite the venerable elder's three disciples into
 the palace to share the meal.</P>
<P>When the aides went out with this invitation they said, &#8220;We can't see
 them, we can't see them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There are three hideous monks sitting in the hostel,&#8221; one of their
 staff said. &#8220;Must be them.&#8221;</P>
<P>The aides and their staff then went to the hostel, where they asked
 the people in charge, &#8220;Which are the disciples of the monk from Great
 Tang who's going to fetch the scriptures? His Royal Highness has
 invited them to a meal.&#8221;</P>
<P>As soon as Pig, who was sitting there snoozing, heard the word &#8220;meal&quot;
 he could not help jumping up and saying, &#8220;We are, we are,&#8221; at the sight
 of which the palace aides' souls flew from their bodies as they
 shivered and said, &#8220;A pig demon! A pig demon!&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he seized hold of Pig and said, &#8220;Act a bit
 more civilized, brother, and don't be so wild.&#8221; When the officials saw
 Monkey they all said, &#8220;A monkey spirit! A monkey spirit!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no need to be frightened,&#8221; said Friar Sand, raising his
 hands together in polite greeting. &#8220;We're all disciples of the Tang
 Priest.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;A stove god, a stove god,&#8221; was the officials' reaction to the sight
 of him. Monkey then told Pig to lead the horse and Friar Sand to
 shoulder the carrying-pole as they followed the officials' staff into
 the prince of Yuhua's palace. The aides went ahead to announce them.</P>
<P>When the prince looked up and saw how ugly they were he too was
 frightened. &#8220;Do not be alarmed, Your Royal Highness,&#8221; said Sanzang,
 putting his hands together in front of his chest. &#8220;Although my rough
 disciples are ugly they have good hearts.&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig intoned a noise of respect and said, &#8220;How do you do?&#8221; This made
 the prince feel even more alarmed.</P>
<P>&#8220;All my rough disciples are from the wilds and the mountains and they
 do not know how to behave,&#8221; Sanzang explained, &#8220;so please forgive
 them.&#8221; Overcoming his fear, the prince told the superintendent of his
 kitchens to take the monks to eat in the Gauze Pavilion.</P>
<P>Sanzang thanked the prince, came down from the hall to proceed to the
 pavilion with his disciples, then grumbled at Pig, &#8220;You idiot,&#8221; he
 said, &#8220;you've not a shred of manners. If you had kept your mouth shut
 that would have been fine, but why did you have to be so coarse? That
 one remark from you was enough to knock a mountain over.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I did better by not making a respectful chant,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;and I
 saved a bit of my breath too.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You didn't even intone the chant properly,&#8221; said Friar Sand to Pig.
 &#8220;First of all, you stuck your snout out and roared.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It makes me hopping mad,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;The other day the master told
 me that the polite thing when I met someone was to say, 'How do you
 do?' I do it today and you tell me it's wrong. How do you want me to
 behave?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I told you to say, 'How do you do?' when you meet people,&#8221; Sanzang
 replied, &#8220;but not to make such a fool of yourself when you meet a
 prince. As the saying goes, things, like people, come in grades. Why
 can't you see the differences of social rank?&#8221; While he was still
 making these remarks the superintendent of the kitchens led servants in
 to set out tables and chairs and serve the vegetarian feast. Then the
 monks stopped talking and started eating their meal.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the prince withdrew from the palace hall to his living quarters
 his three sons noticed his pallor and asked, &#8220;What has given you such a
 fright today, Father?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;A most remarkable monk has arrived,&#8221; the prince replied. &#8220;He has
 been sent by the Great Tang in the East to worship the Buddha and fetch
 the scriptures, and he came to present his passport. When I invited him
 to take a meal he told me that he had some disciples outside the
 palace, so I asked them in. When they came in a moment later they
 didn't kowtow to me but just said, 'How do you do?' That was upsetting
 enough. Then when I looked at them I saw that they were all as ugly as
 demons, which gave me quite a shock. That's why I'm looking pale.&#8221;</P>
<P>Now the three young princes were no ordinary boys. They were all fond
 of the martial arts, so they stretched out their hands, rolled up their
 sleeves and said, &#8220;They must be evil spirits from the mountains
 disguised as humans. Wait while we fetch our weapons and take a look at
 them.&#8221;</P>
<P>Splendid young princes! The eldest wielded a brow-high rod, the
 second a nine-toothed rake and the third a black-painted cudgel, and
 the three of them strode with great valour and spirit out of the
 palace, shouting, &#8220;What's this about monks fetching scriptures? Where
 are they?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Young prince,&#8221; replied the superintendent of the kitchens and the
 others on their knees, &#8220;they're eating in the Gauze Pavilion.&#8221;</P>
<P>The young princes then charged straight in without stopping to think
 as they shouted, &#8220;Are you men or monsters? Tell us at once and we'll
 spare your lives.&#8221;</P>
<P>This gave Sanzang such a fright that he turned pale, dropped his
 bowl, bowed to them and replied, &#8220;I have come from Great Tang to fetch
 the scriptures. I am a man, not a monster.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You look human enough,&#8221; the princes said, &#8220;but the three ugly ones
 are definitely monsters.&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig kept eating and ignored them, while Friar Sand and Monkey bowed
 and said, &#8220;We're all human. Our faces may be ugly but our hearts are
 good, and despite our clumsy bodies we have good natures. Where are you
 three from, and why are you shooting your mouths off so wildly?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;These three gentlemen are His Royal Highness's sons,&#8221; explained the
 superintendent of the kitchens and the others who were standing at the
 side of the pavilion.</P>
<P>&#8220;Well, Your Highnesses,&#8221; said Pig, throwing down his bowl, &#8220;what are
 you carrying those weapons for? Do you want a fight with us?&#8221;</P>
<P>The second prince strode forward wielding his rake in both hands to
 strike at Pig, which made him say with a chuckle, &#8220;That rake of yours
 is only fit to be the grandson of my one.&#8221; With that he stripped down,
 pulled his own rake out from his belt and swung it, making ten thousand
 beams of golden light, then went through some movements, leaving a
 thousand strands of auspicious vapor. The second prince was so
 terrified that his hands went weak and his muscles turned numb and he
 lost the nerve for any more showing off.</P>
<P>When Monkey saw that the oldest of the young princes was leaping
 about with a brow-high rod he brought his own gold-banded cudgel out
 from his ear and shook it to make it as thick as a bowl and twelve or
 thirteen feet long. Ramming it into the ground, he made a hole about
 three feet deep in which it stood upright, then said with a smile, &#8220;I'm
 giving you this cudgel.&#8221;</P>
<P>As soon as the prince heard this he threw his own rod down and went
 to take the cudgel, but though he pulled at it with all his strength he
 couldn't move it by as much as a hair's breath. Then he straightened
 himself up and shook it, but it was as if it had taken root. At this
 the third prince started acting wild, moving into the attack with his
 black-painted cudgel. Friar Sand dodged the blow, then brought out his
 own demon-quelling staff, and as he fingered it brilliant light and
 glowing, coloured clouds came from it, leaving the superintendent of
 the kitchens and the rest of them wide-eyed and speechless. The three
 young princes then kowtowed, saying, &#8220;Divine teachers, divine teachers,
 we mere mortals failed to recognize you. We beg you to give us a
 display of your powers.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey went up to them, effortlessly picked up his cudgel and said,
 &#8220;It's too cramped here for me to do my stuff. I'm jumping up into the
 auto play around and give you something to see.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage went whistling up by somersault and stood on
 an auspicious cloud of many colours up in mid-air about three hundred
 feet above the ground. Then he moved up and down and spun to left and
 right as he performed a Canopy from Which Flowers Are Scattered and a
 Twisting Dragon with his gold-banded club. At first both he and the
 cudgel moved like flowers being added to brocade, but later he could no
 longer be seen as the whole sky was filled with the whirling cudgel.</P>
<P>As he roared his approval from down below Pig could not keep still,
 and with a great shout of &#8220;I'm going to have a bit of fun too!&#8221; the
 splendid idiot rode a breeze up into the air and started swinging his
 rake. He went three times up, four times down, five times to the left,
 six times to the right, seven times forwards and eight times backwards
 as he ran through all the movements he knew, filling the air with a
 noise like a howling gale.</P>
<P>Just when he had warmed up Friar Sand said to Sanzang, &#8220;Master, let
 me go up and give a show too.&#8221; Springing up into the air with both
 feet, the splendid monk whirled his club through the air, which
 glittered with golden light. Wielding his demon-subduing cudgel he
 performed a Red Phoenix Facing the Sun and a Hungry Tiger Seizing Its
 Prey, attacking hard and defending with time to spare as he turned for
 a sudden forward thrust. The three brother disciples all gave a most
 imposing display of their magical powers. This was indeed</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>An image of the dhyana, no common sight;</P>
<P>The causation of the Great Way filling all of space.</P>
<P>Metal and wood fill the dharma-world with their might;</P>
<P>A pinch of elixir produces perfect unity.</P>
<P>The quality of these magic warriors is often displayed;</P>
<P>The splendor of their weapons is widely revered.</P>
<P>Lofty though India is,</P>
<P>The princes of Yuhua now return to the central truth.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This all so terrified the three young princes that they fell to their
 knees in the dust; and all the staff in the Gauze Pavilion, high and
 low, together with the senior prince in his palace, all the soldiers,
 civilians, men and women, Buddhist monks and nuns, Taoist clergy, lay
 people&#8212;everyone in fact&#8212;all invoked the Buddha, kowtowed, held sticks
 of incense and worshipped. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>All the monks were converted at the sight of the true images,</P>
<P>Bringing blessings to mankind and the joys of peace.</P>
<P>From here the achievement was won on the road to enlightenment;</P>
<P>All joined in meditation and worshipped the Buddha.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the three of them had given a display of their heroic powers
 they brought their auspicious clouds down to land, put their weapons
 away, joined their hands together in homage to the Tang Priest, thanked
 him and took their seats again.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The three young princes hurried back into the palace to report to
 their father, &#8220;A most wonderful thing has happened, Father. Today has
 been a tremendous success. Did you see the performance in the sky just
 now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When I saw the coloured clouds glowing in the sky a little while
 back I, your mother and everyone else in the inner palace burned
 incense and worshipped,&#8221; the prince, their father, replied. &#8220;I don't
 know where the gods or immortals who had gathered there were from.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They weren't gods and immortals from somewhere else,&#8221; the young
 princes said. &#8220;They were the three hideous disciples of the monk who's
 going to fetch the scriptures. One of them uses a gold-banded iron
 cudgel, one a nine-toothed take, and one a demon-quelling staff, all
 exactly the same as our three weapons. When we asked them to give us a
 display they said it was too cramped down here to be able to manage, so
 they'd go up into the sky to give us a show. Then they all went up on
 clouds, filling the sky with auspicious clouds and vapors. They only
 came down a moment ago, and they're now sitting in the Gauze Pavilion.
 We are all very taken with them and we'd like to make them our teachers
 and learn their skills to protect the country with. This really will be
 an enormous achievement. I wonder what Your Majesty thinks.&#8221; When the
 prince, their father, heard this he was convinced and agreed.</P>
<P>Father and sons then went straight to the Gauze Pavilion, going on
 foot instead of by carriage, and without any parasols. The four
 travelers had by now packed up their luggage and were just about to go
 to the palace to thank the prince for the meal and start out on their
 journey again when they saw the prince of Yuhua and his sons come into
 the pavilion and prostrate themselves before them. The venerable elder
 hurriedly rose and prostrated himself to return the courtesy, while
 Monkey and the rest of them moved aside with a hint of a mocking grin.
 When the kowtowing was over the four travelers were happy to go into
 the palace on being invited to do so and take seats of honour.</P>
<P>Then the senior prince got up and said, &#8220;Tang Master, there is one
 thing I would like to ask of you, but I do not know whether your three
 illustrious disciples will grant it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My disciples will obey any instruction that Your Royal Highness
 gives them,&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;When I first saw you gentlemen,&#8221; said the prince, &#8220;I took you for
 pilgrim monks from distant Tang, and because I am a mere mortal with
 fleshly eyes I treated you in a most offhand way. It was only when I
 saw Teacher Sun, Teacher Zhu and Teacher Sand whirling around in the
 sky that I realized you are immortals and Buddhas. My three wretched
 sons have been fond of the martial arts all their lives and they now
 wish most sincerely to be accepted as your disciples and learn some of
 your skills. I beg that in the greatness of your hearts you will agree
 to be the salvation of my boys. I will certainly reward you with all
 the wealth of the city.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Brother Monkey heard this he could not restrain himself from
 replying with a chuckle, &#8220;You really don't understand, Your Royal
 Highness. As monks we'd love to have disciples, and your fine sons have
 their hearts set on goodness. But you mustn't talk about material
 benefits. As long as they can get on with us we'll look after them.&#8221;
 This delighted the prince, who ordered a great banquet in the main hall
 of the palace. It was amazing: no sooner had he issued his order than
 everything was there. This is what could be seen:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Fluttering silken decorations,</P>
<P>Darkly fragrant incense smoke.</P>
<P>Gold-inlaid tables hung with knotted silks,</P>
<P>Dazzling the eyes;</P>
<P>Lacquered chairs with cushions of brocade,</P>
<P>Making them even more splendid.</P>
<P>Fresh fruit,</P>
<P>Fragrant tea.</P>
<P>Three or four courses of pure confectioneries,</P>
<P>One or two servings of rich and pure breadrolls.</P>
<P>The crisp steamed honeycakes were even finer;</P>
<P>The deep-fried sweets were truly delicious.</P>
<P>There were jugs of mild rice-wine,</P>
<P>Better than nectar when poured;</P>
<P>Servings of Yangxian tea that is fit for immortals,</P>
<P>More fragrant than cassia when held in the hands.</P>
<P>Every possible dish is provided;</P>
<P>All that is offered is outstanding.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Meanwhile there was singing, dancing, instrumental music, acrobatics
 and opera to entertain them. Master, disciples, the prince and his sons
 all had a day of delight, and after night fell unnoticed they
 dispersed. The princes then had beds and curtains set up in the
 pavilion and invited their teachers to turn in for the night; early the
 next morning they would piously burn incense and call on them again to
 ask them to teach their martial skills. These orders were obeyed, and
 hot, scented water was brought in for the travelers to bath in, after
 which everyone went to bed. At that time</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The birds perched high in the trees and all was silent;</P>
<P>The poet came down from his couch to end his chanting.</P>
<P>The light of the Milky Way now filled the sky,</P>
<P>And the grass grew thicker along the overgrown path.</P>
<P>The bang of a washing stick came from another courtyard;</P>
<P>The distant mountains and passes made one long for home.</P>
<P>The chirp of crickets expressed people's feelings,</P>
<P>Chirruping at the bedside interrupted one's dreams.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>That describes the night. Early the next morning the prince and his
 three sons came to call on the venerable elder again. The previous day
 they had greeted each other with the etiquette appropriate to a prince,
 but today's greetings were those appropriate to teachers.</P>
<P>The three young princes kowtowed to Monkey, Pig and Friar Sand, then
 asked with bows, &#8220;Will you let your disciples have a look at your
 weapons, honoured teachers?&#8221; As soon as Pig heard this request he
 happily brought out his iron rake and threw it on the ground, while
 Friar Sand tossed his staff against the wall. The second and third
 young princes sprang to their feet to pick them up, but they might just
 as well have been dragonflies trying to shake a stone pillar: they both
 strained themselves till they were red in the face without moving the
 weapons in the slightest. When their elder brother saw this he said,
 &#8220;Don't waste your efforts, brothers. Our teachers' weapons are all
 magical ones. Goodness only knows how heavy they are.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My rake's not all that heavy,&#8221; said Pig with a smile. &#8220;It only
 weighs a couple of tons&#8212;5,048 pounds including the handle.&#8221;</P>
<P>The third prince then asked Friar Sand how heavy his staff was. &#8220;It's
 5,048 pounds too,&#8221; replied Friar Sand with a smile.</P>
<P>The oldest of the young princes then asked Brother Monkey to let him
 see the gold-banded cudgel. Monkey produced the needle from his ear,
 shook it in the wind to make it as thick as a rice bowl, and stood it
 upright in the ground in front of him, to the consternation and alarm
 of all the princes and officials. The three young princes then kowtowed
 again and said, &#8220;Teacher Zhu and Teacher Sand carry their weapons under
 their clothes where they can get them out. Why do you take yours out of
 your ear, Teacher Sun? How do you make it grow in the wind?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You wouldn't realize that this isn't some mere mortal object,&#8221;
 Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;When chaos was first parted the iron was cast:</P>
<P>Yu the Great had the work done himself.</P>
<P>When he unified the depths of rivers, lakes and seas</P>
<P>This cudgel served as a measuring rod.</P>
<P>In the prosperity after mountains and seas had been ordered</P>
<P>It floated to the gates of the Eastern Ocean.</P>
<P>Over the years it gave off a coloured glow,</P>
<P>Learned to shrink and to grow and shine with pure light.</P>
<P>It was my destiny to recover this rod</P>
<P>Which endlessly changes when I say the spell.</P>
<P>When I tell it to grow it fills the universe,</P>
<P>But it can be as tiny as a needle's eye.</P>
<P>It's known as As-You-Will and called gold-banded;</P>
<P>In Heaven and on Earth it is quite unique.</P>
<P>Its weight is thirteen thousand and five hundred pounds;</P>
<P>Whether thick or fine it can bring life or death.</P>
<P>Once it helped me make havoc in Heaven,</P>
<P>And took part when I attacked the Underworld.</P>
<P>It always succeeds in subduing dragons and tigers,</P>
<P>Everywhere wipes out monsters and ogres.</P>
<P>If it points up the sun goes dark;</P>
<P>Heaven, earth, gods, devils, all are afraid.</P>
<P>Passed on by magic since the birth of time,</P>
<P>This is no ordinary piece of iron.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the young princes had heard this they all started kowtowing
 endlessly, bowing over and over again as they earnestly begged for
 instruction.</P>
<P>&#8220;Which fighting skills do the three of you want to learn?&#8221; Monkey
 asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The one of us who uses a rod wants to learn that,&#8221; the young princes
 replied, &#8220;the one who fights with a rake wants to learn the rake, and
 the staff man wants to learn the staff.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Teaching would be easy enough,&#8221; replied Monkey with a smile, &#8220;except
 that you're all too weak to be able to use our weapons, so you won't be
 able to master them. 'A badly-drawn tiger only looks like a dog.' As
 they used to say in the old days, 'If the teaching isn't strict it
 shows the teacher is idle; if the student doesn't learn it's his own
 fault.' If you're really sincere you'd better burn incense and bow to
 Heaven and Earth. I'll give you some magic strength before teaching you
 how to fight.&#8221;</P>
<P>The three young princes were very pleased to hear him say this, and
 they at once carried in an incense table themselves, washed their
 hands, lit incense sticks and bowed to Heaven. This done, they asked
 their teachers to instruct them.</P>
<P>Monkey stepped down and said to the Tang Priest with a bow, &#8220;Please
 forgive your disciple, honoured Master. Ever since in your goodness you
 rescued me at the Double Boundary Mountain and I became a Buddhist all
 those years ago we've been travelling West. Although I've never done
 very much to repay your kindness I have crossed plenty of rivers and
 mountains and done everything I possibly could. Now that we've come to
 this land of the Buddha and had the good fortune of meeting these three
 young princes, they've taken us as their teachers of martial arts. As
 our pupils they'd be your pupils' pupils, so I ask you respectfully,
 Master, to allow us to instruct them.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang was delighted, and when Pig and Friar Sand saw Monkey bowing
 to him they kowtowed too and said, &#8220;Master, we're stupid and too
 awkward with words to be able to explain things properly. Please take
 your dharma seat and let each of us take a pupil. It'll be fun, and
 something to remind us of our journey West.&#8221; Sanzang was happy to
 agree.</P>
<P>Monkey then took the three young princes into a quiet room behind the
 pavilion where he drew a star-chart of the Dipper and told them to
 prostrate themselves inside it while they shut their eyes and settled
 their spirits. Meanwhile he silently said the words of the spell,
 recited a mantra, and blew magic breath into the hearts of the three of
 them. He put their primal spirits back into their original home, taught
 them magical spells, gave each of them immense strength, applied the
 right heat, and performed a magic that replaced their old bodies and
 bones with new ones. After the heat circulated in a roundabout way
 through their bodies the three young princes came to, stood up, rubbed
 their faces, summoned up their spirits, and all found that they were
 much stronger. The eldest of them could pick up the gold-banded cudgel,
 the second could swing the nine-toothed rake, and the third could raise
 the demon-quelling staff.</P>
<P>When the king saw this he was beside himself with delight, and
 arranged another vegetarian feast for the Tang Priest and his three
 disciples. In front of the banquet each of the princes was taught his
 own skill: the one who was learning the rod practised with the rod, the
 one who was learning the rake practised with the rake, and the one who
 was learning the staff practised with the staff. Though the young
 princes did manage a few turns and movements it took a lot of effort,
 and going through a series of movements left them gasping for breath,
 so that they could not go on. Besides this, the weapons they were using
 had the power of transformation, so that as the princes advanced,
 retreated, attacked and lifted the weapons shrunk, grew and went
 through amazing changes by themselves. But the princes were, after all,
 only mortals, and were unable to keep up with the speed of their
 weapons. Later that day the banquet came to an end.</P>
<P>The next day the three princes came back once more to express their
 thanks and say, &#8220;We are very grateful to you, divine teachers, for
 giving us this strength, but when we try to spin your divine weapons
 around we can only move them with great difficulty. We would like to
 get smiths to make lighter copies of them, but we don't know whether
 you would agree to that, Teachers.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Great, great,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;That's the way to talk. You ought to have
 your own made because you can't use our weapons, and anyhow we need
 them to protect the Dharma and beat monsters.&#8221; The princes then sent
 for smiths who bought ten thousand pounds of iron and steel, set up a
 workshop with a furnace in the front courtyard of the prince's palace,
 and began to cast the weapons. On the first day the steel was made, and
 on the second Monkey and the other two were asked to bring out their
 gold-banded cudgel, nine-toothed rake and demon-quelling staff and put
 them under the matting shelter to be copied. The work went on by night
 and day without stopping.</P>
<P>These weapons were the treasures they always carried with them that
 they could not be parted from for a moment. Normally they hid them
 about their persons. Now the weapons were protected by coloured light,
 so that when they were put in the yard of the workshop for several days
 many beams of radiance reached up to the heavens, while every kind of
 auspicious vapor blanketed the earth. That night an evil spirit, who
 was sitting out on a night watch in a cave called Tigermouth Cave on a
 mountain called Mount Leopard Head that was only some twenty-five miles
 from the city, noticed the glow and the auspicious vapors.</P>
<P>Going up on his cloud to investigate he saw that the light came from
 the city, whereupon he brought his cloud down and went closer for a
 better look. Discovering that the light was coming from the weapons, he
 thought with delight and desire, &#8220;What wonderful weapons, what splendid
 treasures. I wonder whose they are and why they've been left here. This
 must be my lucky chance. I'll take them, I'll take them.&#8221; His
 covetousness now moved, he created a mighty wind, scooped up all three
 weapons and took them back to his cave. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Not for one moment must the Way be left;</P>
<P>What can be left is not the true Way.</P>
<P>Cultivation and trance will both be in vain</P>
<P>When divine arms have been taken away.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you do not know how these weapons were found, listen to the
 explanation in the next installment.</P>

</B>
<P>The story tells how after days on end of hard work the smiths all
 went to sleep that night, only to get up at dawn to start again and
 find that the three weapons had disappeared from under the matting
 shelter. Dumbfounded with horror, they started looking for them
 everywhere, and when the three young princes came out of the inner
 quarters to watch, the smiths all kowtowed to them and said, &#8220;Young
 masters, we don't know where the divine teachers' three weapons have
 all gone.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the young princes heard this news they trembled and said, &#8220;We
 expect our masters put them away last night.&#8221; Rushing to the Gauze
 Pavilion, they found the white horse still tethered in the walkway and
 could not help shouting, &#8220;Teachers, are you still asleep?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We're up,&#8221; Friar Sand replied, and opened the door of their room to
 let the young princes in.</P>
<P>When they saw that the weapons were not there they asked with alarm,
 &#8220;Masters, have you put your weapons away?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Monkey, springing up.</P>
<P>&#8220;The three weapons disappeared during the night,&#8221; the princes
 explained.</P>
<P>&#8220;Is my rake still there?&#8221; Pig asked as he scrambled to his feet.</P>
<P>&#8220;When we came out a moment ago we saw everyone searching for them,&#8221;
 the princes replied. &#8220;When they couldn't find them we wondered if you
 had put them away, which is why we came to ask. As your treasures can
 shrink or grow we wonder if you've hidden them about yourselves to play
 a trick on us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Honestly, we haven't,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Let's all join the search.&#8221;</P>
<P>When they went to the matting shelter in the yard and could see that
 there really was no sign of the weapons Pig said, &#8220;You smiths must have
 stolen them. Bring'em out at once. Do it right now or I'll kill you.
 I'll kill you, I say.&#8221;</P>
<P>The smiths kowtowed desperately and said with tears pouring down
 their faces, &#8220;Your Lordships, we went to sleep last night because we'd
 been working so hard for days on end. When we got up this morning
 they'd gone. We're only ordinary mortals. We could never have moved
 them. Spare our lives, Your Lordships, spare our lives.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey said with bitter regret, &#8220;It's our fault. After we'd shown
 them what they look like to copy we should have kept them on us instead
 of leaving them lying there. I suppose our treasures' glowing clouds
 and light must have alerted some monster who came and stole them during
 the night.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Nonsense, brother,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;This is a peaceful, orderly sort
 of place, not somewhere in the wilds or the mountains. No monsters
 could possibly have come here. I'm sure it was those evil smiths who
 stole our weapons. They could tell they were treasures from the light
 shining from them. They must have left the palace last night and got a
 whole gang together to carry or drag them out. Bring'em here! I'm going
 to hit them.&#8221; The smiths kowtowed and swore to their innocence for all
 they were worth.</P>
<P>Amid all this commotion the senior prince came out, and when he asked
 what had happened the color drained from his face too. After muttering
 to himself in a low voice for a while he said, &#8220;Divine teachers, your
 weapons were not mere mortals' ones. Even if there had been a hundred
 or more people they would never have been able to move them. Besides,
 my family has been ruling this city for five generations. I'm not
 boasting, but I do have a certain reputation for being a good man. The
 soldiers, civilians and artisans who live here fear my laws, and I am
 certain that they could never have had so wicked an idea. I hope that
 you divine teachers will think again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No need for any more thinking about it,&#8221; replied Brother Monkey with
 a smile, &#8220;and no need to make the smiths suffer for what's not their
 fault. I would like to ask Your Royal Highness if there are any evil
 monsters in the mountains and forests around the city.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's a very good question,&#8221; the prince replied. &#8220;There is a
 mountain North of the city called Mount Leopard Head, with a Tigermouth
 Cave in it. People often say that immortals, or tigers and wolves, or
 evil spirits live there. As I've never been there to find out the truth
 I am not sure what kind of creatures there are.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No need to say any more,&#8221; replied Monkey with a laugh. &#8220;It must be
 someone wicked from there who knew they were treasures and came during
 the night to steal them. Pig, Friar Sand,&#8221; he ordered, &#8220;stay here to
 guard the master and the city while I go for a look round.&#8221; He then
 told the smiths to keep the furnace burning and carry on forging the
 new weapons.</P>
<P>The splendid Monkey King took his leave of Sanzang and whistled out
 of sight. Soon he was on Mount Leopard Head, which took him but an
 instant as it was only ten miles from the city. As he climbed to the
 summit to look around he saw that there was quite an air of evil about
 it. Indeed, it was</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A long dragon chain of hills,</P>
<P>A mighty formation.</P>
<P>Sharp peaks thrusting into the sky,</P>
<P>Streams flowing fast along chasms deep.</P>
<P>In front of the mountain grow cushions of rare plants;</P>
<P>Behind the mountain strange flowers form brocade.</P>
<P>Tall pine and ancient cypress,</P>
<P>Old trees and find bamboo.</P>
<P>Crows and magpies sing as they fly,</P>
<P>Cranes call and gibbons scream.</P>
<P>Below the beetling scar</P>
<P>David's deer go in twos;</P>
<P>In front of the sheer rock-face</P>
<P>Are pairs of badgers and foxes.</P>
<P>Dragons from afar emerge briefly from the waters</P>
<P>Of the twisting, winding stream that runs deep under the ground.</P>
<P>This ridge runs right to the edge of Yuhua,</P>
<P>A place of beauty for a thousand ages.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Just as he was surveying the scene Monkey heard voices on the other
 side of the mountain, turned quickly round to look, and saw a couple of
 wolf-headed ogres climbing towards the Northwest and talking loudly as
 they went.</P>
<P>&#8220;They must be monsters patrolling the mountain,&#8221; Monkey guessed. &#8220;I'm
 going to listen to what they have to say.&#8221;</P>
<P>Making magic with his hands and saying the words of a spell Monkey
 shook himself, turned into a butterfly, spread his wings and fluttered
 after them. It was a very lifelike transformation:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A pair of powdery wings,</P>
<P>Two silver antennae.</P>
<P>In the wind it files very fast;</P>
<P>In the sun it's a leisurely dancer.</P>
<P>It crosses rivers and walls in a flash.</P>
<P>Enjoys stealing fragrance and playing with catkins.</P>
<P>This delicate creature loves the taste of fresh flowers</P>
<P>It shows its beauty and elegance as it pleases.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He flew to a spot right above the evil spirits' heads, where he
 floated and listened to what they had to say. &#8220;Brother,&#8221; one of them
 shouted suddenly, &#8220;our chief keeps on striking it lucky. The other
 month he caught himself a real beauty to live with him in the cave, and
 he was as pleased as anything about that. Then last night he got the
 three weapons, which really are priceless treasures. Tomorrow there's
 going to be a Rake Banquet to celebrate, so we're all going to
 benefit.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We've been quite lucky too,&#8221; the other replied, &#8220;being given these
 twenty ounces of silver to buy pigs and sleep. When we get to Qianfang
 Market we can have a few jugs of wine to start with, and then fiddle
 the accounts to make ourselves two or three ounces of silver to buy
 ourselves padded jackets for the winter. It's great, isn't it?&#8221; As they
 laughed and talked the two monsters hurried along the main path at a
 great speed.</P>
<P>When Monkey heard about the banquet to celebrate the rake he was
 quietly delighted. He would have liked to kill the devils, but it was
 not their fault and, besides, he had no weapon. So he flew round till
 he was in front of them, turned back into himself and stood at a
 junction along the path. As the devils gradually came closer he blew a
 mouthful of magic saliva at them, recited the words<I> Om Humkara</I>
 and made a fixing spell that held the two wolf-headed spirits where
 they were. Their eyes were fixed in a stare, they could not open their
 mouths, and they stood upright, both legs rigid. Monkey then knocked
 them over, undid their clothes and searched them, finding the twenty
 ounces of silver in a purse carried by one of them in the belt of his
 kilt. Each of them was also carrying a white lacquered pass. One of
 these read &#8220;Wily Freak&#8221; and the other read &#8220;Freaky Wile.&#8221;</P>
<P>Having taken their silver and undone their passes the splendid Great
 Sage went straight back to the city, where he told the princes, the
 Tang Priest, the officials high and low and the smiths what had
 happened.</P>
<P>&#8220;I reckon my treasure's the one that shone the brightest,&#8221; said Pig
 with a grin. &#8220;That's why they're buying pigs and sheep for a slap-up
 meal to celebrate. But how are we going to get it back?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We'll all three of us go,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;This silver was for buying
 pigs and sheep. We'll give it to the smiths: His Royal Highness can
 provide us with some animals. Pig, you turn yourself into Wily Freak,
 I'll turn into Freaky Wile, and Friar Sand can be a trader selling pigs
 and sheep. We'll go into Tigermouth Cave, and when it suits us we'll
 grab our weapons, kill all the monsters, come back here to pack up and
 be on our way again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Terrific,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;No time to lose. Let's go.&#8221; The senior
 prince agreed with the plan and told his steward to buy seven or eight
 pigs and four or five sheep.</P>
<P>The three of them left their master and gave a great display of their
 magic powers once outside the city.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;I've never seen that Wily Freak, so how can I
 possibly turn myself into his double?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I did fixing magic on him to keep him over there somewhere,&#8221; Monkey
 said, &#8220;and he won't come round till tomorrow. I can remember what he
 looks like, so you stand still while I tell you how to change. Yes,
 like this...no, a bit more like that....That's it. That's him.&#8221;</P>
<P>While the idiot said an incantation Brother Monkey blew on him with
 magic breath, turned him into Wily Freak's double and gave him a white
 pass to tuck in at his waist. Monkey then turned himself into Freaky
 Wile with a pass at his waist too, and Friar Sand made himself look
 like a travelling dealer in pigs and sheep. Then they drove the pigs
 and sheep together along the path West towards the mountain. Before
 long they were in a mountain gully, where they met another junior
 devil. He had the most horrible face. Just look:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A pair of round and bulging eyes</P>
<P>Shining like lanterns;</P>
<P>A head of red and bristly hair,</P>
<P>Blazing like fire.</P>
<P>A red nose,</P>
<P>A twisted mouth,</P>
<P>Sharp and pointy fangs;</P>
<P>Protruding ears,</P>
<P>A brow that seemed hacked into shape,</P>
<P>And a green and bloated face.</P>
<P>He was wearing a pale yellow tunic</P>
<P>And sandals made of sedge.</P>
<P>He looked most imposing, like some evil god,</P>
<P>As he hurried along like a vicious demon.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This devil was carrying a coloured lacquer invitation box under his
 left arm as he greeted Monkey and the other two with a call of &#8220;Freaky
 Wile, good to see you both. Did you buy us some pigs and sheep?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Can't you see we're driving them along?&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Who's this gentleman?&#8221; the devil asked, looking at Friar Sand.</P>
<P>&#8220;He's the dealer in pigs and sheep,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;We still owe
 him a couple of ounces of silver, so we're taking him home with us to
 fetch it. Where are you going?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;To Bamboo Mountain to invite His Senior Majesty to the feast
 tomorrow morning,&#8221; the devil said.</P>
<P>Taking his cue from the devil's tone of voice, Monkey then asked,
 &#8220;How many guests will there be altogether?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;His Senior Majesty will take the place of honour,&#8221; the devil
 replied, &#8220;and with our own king, chiefs and the rest of them there'll
 be over forty.&#8221;</P>
<P>As they were talking Pig called, &#8220;Get a move on! The pigs and sheep
 are going everywhere.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You go and invite them while I get a look at that invitation,&#8221;
 Monkey said, and as the devil regarded him as one of their own kind he
 opened the box, took out the invitation and handed it to Monkey. This
 is what Monkey read when he unfolded it:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A banquet is being given tomorrow morning to celebrate the capture of
 the rake, and if you will condescend to cross the mountain, honoured
 ancestor, Primal Sage of Ninefold Numinosity, I will be deeply
 grateful.</P>
<P>With a hundred kowtows,</P>
<P>Your grandson,</P>
<P>Tawny Lion</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Monkey had read it he handed it back to the devil, who returned
 it to its case and carried on towards the Southeast.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; Friar Sand asked, &#8220;what did it say on the invitation?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It was an invitation to the Rake Banquet,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;It was
 signed, 'with a hundred kowtows, your grandson Tawny Lion,' and the
 invitation was being sent to the Primal Sage of Ninefold Numinosity.'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Tawny Lion must be a golden-haired lion who's become a spirit,&#8221; said
 Friar Sand with a smile, &#8220;but I wonder who the Primal Sage of Ninefold
 Numinosity is.&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig's reaction was to laugh and say, &#8220;He's mine.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why should he necessarily be yours?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;There's an old saying that goes, 'a mangy old sow can put a golden
 lion to flight,'&#8220; Pig replied. &#8220;That's why I know he's mine.&#8221; As they
 talked and laughed the three of them drove the pigs and sheep along
 till they could see the gates of Tigermouth Cave. Outside the gates
 there were,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Green mountains all around,</P>
<P>Ranges forming a mighty wall.</P>
<P>Creepers clung to the sheer rock faces,</P>
<P>Thorns hung down from the towering cliffs.</P>
<P>Bird song came from all around the woods,</P>
<P>While flowers gave a welcome by the entrance.</P>
<P>This cave was a match for the Peach Blossom Spring,</P>
<P>A place to avoid the troubles of the world.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As they came closer to the mouth of the cave they saw a crowd of evil
 spirits of every age and kind playing under the blossoming trees, and
 when they heard Pig's shouts of &#8220;Hey! Hey!&#8221; as he drove the pigs and
 sheep they all came out to meet them. The pigs and sheep were caught
 and trussed up. The noise had by now disturbed the demon king inside,
 who came out with ten or more junior demons to ask, &#8220;Are you two back?
 How many animals did you buy?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Eight pigs and seven sheep&#8212;fifteen altogether,&#8221; Monkey replied.
 &#8220;The pigs cost sixteen ounces of silver and the sheep nine. We were
 only given twenty ounces, so we still owe five. This is the dealer
 who's come with us for the silver.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Fetch five ounces of silver, little ones,&#8221; the demon king ordered on
 hearing this, &#8220;and send him on his way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But the dealer hasn't only come to get his silver,&#8221; Monkey replied.
 &#8220;He's come to see the banquet too.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What nerve, Freaky Wile!&#8221; said the furious demon abusively. &#8220;You
 were sent off to buy things, not to talk about banquets.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As you've got those amazingly fine treasures, my lord,&#8221; Pig said,
 stepping forward, &#8220;what's the harm in letting him have a look?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Damn you too, Wily Freak,&#8221; said the demon with an angry snort. &#8220;I
 got these treasures from inside the city of Yuhua. If this stranger
 sees them and talks about them in the city the word will get around and
 the prince will come to demand them. What'll we do then?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;this dealer comes from the other side of
 Qianfang Market. That's a long way from the city, and he's not a city
 man either, so where would he go telling tales? Besides, he's hungry,
 and the two of us haven't eaten. If there's any food and liquor in the
 place why don't we give him some before sending him on his way?&#8221;</P>
<P>Before he could finish speaking a junior devil came out with five
 ounces of silver that he gave to Monkey, who in turn handed it to Friar
 Sand with the words, &#8220;Take your silver, stranger, then come round to
 the back for something to eat with us.&#8221;</P>
<P>Taking his courage in his hands, Friar Sand went into the cave with
 Pig and Monkey. When they reached the second hall inside they saw on a
 table in the middle of it the nine-toothed iron rake set up in all its
 dazzling brightness to receive offerings. At the Eastern end of the
 table was leant the gold-banded cudgel, and at the Western end the
 demon-quelling staff.</P>
<P>&#8220;Stranger,&#8221; said the demon king who was following them in, &#8220;that's
 the rake shining so brightly in the middle. You're welcome to look, but
 don't tell anyone about it, whatever you do.&#8221; Friar Sand nodded in
 admiration.</P>
<P>Oh dear! This was a case of &#8220;when the owner sees what's his he's
 bound to pick it up.&#8221; Pig had always been a rough customer, and once he
 saw his rake he was not going to talk about the facts of the case, but
 charged over, pulled it down and swung it around as he turned back into
 himself. He struck straight at the evil spirit's face, not caring now
 about the proper ways of using his weapon. Monkey and Friar Sand each
 rushed to one end of the table to grab his own weapon and turn back
 into himself. As the three brothers started lashing out wildly the
 demon king had to get out of their way in a hurry, go round to the back
 and fetch his four-bright halberd with its long handle and sharp,
 pointed butt.</P>
<P>Rushing into the courtyard, he used this to hold off the three
 weapons and shout at the top of his voice, &#8220;Who do you think you are,
 tricking me out of my treasures by impersonation?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll get you, you hairy beast,&#8221; Monkey cursed back. &#8220;You don't know
 who I am. I'm a disciple of Tang Sanzang, the holy monk from the East.
 When we came to Yuhua to present our passport the prince told his three
 sons to take us as their teachers of fighting skills. They were having
 weapons copied from ours. That was why ours were left in the courtyard
 for you to sneak into the city and steal in the middle of the night.
 And you accuse us of tricking them out of you by impersonation! Stay
 right there and try a taste of our three weapons.&#8221;</P>
<P>The evil spirit at once raised his halberd to fight back. They fought
 from the courtyard out through the front gate, three monks chasing a
 single demon. It was a splendid battle:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The cudgel whistled like the wind,</P>
<P>The rake's blows came raining down.</P>
<P>The demon-quelling staff filled the sky with glowing mist;</P>
<P>The four-bright halberd gave off clouds.</P>
<P>They were like the three immortals refining elixir,</P>
<P>Making dazzling light that frightened gods and ghosts.</P>
<P>Monkey was brilliant at displaying his might;</P>
<P>The evil spirit was wrong to have stolen the treasures.</P>
<P>Marshal Tian Peng showed off his divine powers,</P>
<P>While the great general Sand was heroic and splendid.</P>
<P>As the three brothers fought with skill and one mind</P>
<P>A great battle took place in Tigermouth Cave.</P>
<P>The ogre was full of power and cunning,</P>
<P>A fit match for the four heroes.</P>
<P>They fought until the sun set in the West,</P>
<P>When the demon weakened and could hold out no longer.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After their long fight on Mount Leopard Head the evil spirit shouted
 at Friar Sand, &#8220;Watch this halberd!&#8221; As Friar Sand fell back to dodge
 the blow the evil spirit escaped through the opening he left and fled
 by wind to the Xun quarter to the Southeast.</P>
<P>Pig started rushing after him to catch him, but Monkey said, &#8220;Let him
 go. As the old saying goes, 'never chase a desperate robber.' Let's
 leave him nothing to come back to.&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig agreed, and the three of them went back to the entrance of the
 cave, where they killed all the hundred and more evil spirits great and
 small. It turned out that they were all really tigers, wolves, tiger
 cats, leopards, red deer and goats. Monkey used one of his powers to
 bring all the valuables and fabrics, as well as the bodies of all the
 animals they had killed, the pigs and the sheep out of the cave. Friar
 Sand used some dry wood he found to start a fire that Pig fanned with
 both his ears. The cave was soon burnt out, and they took what they had
 brought with them back to the city.</P>
<P>The city gates were wide open; people had not yet gone to bed. The
 senior prince and his sons were still waiting in the Gauze Pavilion.
 The three disciples dropped all the dead wild animals and sheep as well
 as the valuables with loud thumps into the courtyard, filling it up as
 they called out, &#8220;Master, we're back. We've won.&#8221;</P>
<P>The senior prince then expressed his thanks to them, the Tang priest
 was delighted, and the three young princes fell to their knees to bow.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't thank us,&#8221; Friar Sand said, helping them to their feet. &#8220;Come
 and see what we've got.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are they from?&#8221; the senior prince asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The tigers, wolves, tiger cats, leopards, red deer and goats were
 all monsters that made themselves into spirits. When we'd got our
 weapons back we fought our way out through the gates. Their demon king
 is a golden-haired lion who fights with a four-bright halberd. He
 battled it out with us till nightfall, then ran away to the Southeast.
 Instead of chasing him we made sure he'd have nowhere to come back to
 by killing all these devils and bringing back all his things.&#8221;</P>
<P>This news both delighted and alarmed the senior prince: he was
 delighted at their triumphant return; worried that the demon would seek
 his revenge later.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry, Your Royal Highness,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I've thought about
 it very carefully, and I'll deal with it properly. I promise to
 exterminate the demons completely before we go. We'll definitely not
 leave you with trouble that'll come back later. When we went there at
 noon we ran into a little green-faced, red-haired devil who was
 carrying an invitation. What it said on it was: 'A banquet is being
 given tomorrow morning to celebrate the capture of the rake, and if you
 will condescend to cross the mountain, honoured ancestor, Primal Sage
 of Ninefold Numinosity, I will be deeply grateful.' It was signed:
 'with a hundred kowtows, your grandson, Tawny Lion'. When the evil
 spirit was defeated just now he must have gone to have a word with his
 grandfather. They're bound to come looking for us to get their revenge
 tomorrow morning, and when that happens I'll wipe them all out for
 you.&#8221; The senior prince thanked him and had supper arranged. When
 master and disciples had eaten, everybody went to bed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story now tells of how the evil spirit really did head Southeast
 to Bamboo Mountain, in which there was a cave called the Nine-bend
 Twisty Cave where the evil spirit's grandfather, the Primal Sage of
 Ninefold Numinosity, lived. That night the demon did not stop treading
 the wind until he reached the cave's entrance in the last watch.</P>
<P>When he knocked on the gates and went in a junior devil greeted him
 with the words, &#8220;Your Majesty, Greenface brought the invitation last
 night, and the old gentleman invited him to say till this morning to go
 to your Rake Banquet with him. Why have you come here so very early to
 invite him yourself?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I hate to have to say it,&#8221; the evil spirit replied, &#8220;but the banquet
 is off.&#8221;</P>
<P>As they were talking Greenface came out from the inner part of the
 cave to say, &#8220;What are you doing here, Your Majesty? As soon as His
 Senior Majesty's up he's coming to the celebration with me.&#8221; The evil
 spirit was so distraught that he could say nothing, but only wave his
 hands.</P>
<P>A little later the old demon got up and called for the evil spirit,
 who dropped his weapon and prostrated himself on the ground to kowtow,
 tears streaming down his cheeks. &#8220;Worthy grandson,&#8221; the old demon said,
 &#8220;you sent me an invitation yesterday, and this morning I'm on my way to
 the celebration. So why have you come yourself, looking so miserable
 and upset?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I was taking a stroll in the moonlight the night before last,&#8221; the
 evil spirit replied, still kowtowing, &#8220;when I saw a dazzling light
 rising up to the sky from the city of Yuhua. I hurried there to take a
 look and saw that it came from three weapons in the prince's palace: a
 nine-toothed rake with gold in it, a staff and a gold-banded cudgel. I
 used my magic to take them away and decided to have a Rake Banquet to
 celebrate. I sent some of my underlings to buy pigs, sheep and fruit
 for the feast that I invited you to come and enjoy, Grandfather. But
 after I sent Greenface over with the invitation yesterday Wily Freak
 and the other one who'd been told to buy pigs and sheep came back with
 a dealer, a stranger, for some silver. The stranger was all set on
 seeing the banquet. I refused as I was afraid he'd spread the news
 around. Then they said they were hungry and asked for some food to eat,
 so I told them to go round the back to eat. When they got inside and
 saw the weapons they said they were theirs. They each snatched one and
 turned back into their real selves. One was a monk with a hairy face
 and a mouth like a thunder god's, one was a monk with a long snout and
 big ears, and one was a monk with a really sinister face. The three of
 them yelled at me and started lashing out: they didn't care at all. I
 just managed to fetch my four-bright halberd and come out to hold them
 at bay. When I asked them who they were and how they dared go in for
 impersonation they told me they were disciples of the Tang Priest who's
 been sent to the Western Heaven by Great Tang in the East. When they
 went to present their passport on their way through the city the
 princes pressed them to stay and teach them martial arts. They said
 their three weapons had been left in the palace yard for copies of them
 to be made, and that I'd stolen them. Then they went for me with great
 fury. I didn't know what those three monks are called, but they're all
 very good fighters. As I was no match for them by myself I had to run
 away and come here. If you have any love for your grandson I beg you to
 lend me your arms in order to get my revenge on those monks.&#8221;</P>
<P>After a moment's silent thought the old demon replied with a smile,
 &#8220;So it's them. Worthy grandson, you made a big mistake provoking him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do you know who they are, grandfather?&#8221; the other asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The one with a long snout and big ears is Zhu Bajie,&#8221; the old demon
 said, &#8220;and the one with a horrible face is Friar Sand. They're not too
 bad. But the one with a hairy face and a mouth like a thunder god is
 called Sun the Novice. He's got really tremendous magical powers. When
 he made great havoc in Heaven five hundred years ago a hundred thousand
 heavenly troops couldn't catch him. And he's a most determined hunter.
 He's like a policeman who'll search mountains and seas, smash caves,
 storm cities and cause all sorts of trouble. Why did you have to
 provoke him? Never mind. I'll go with you and capture those so-and-sos
 and the prince of Yuhua to avenge you.&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing this the evil spirit kowtowed again in thanks. The senior
 demon immediately mustered his grandsons Monkey Lion, Snowy Lion, Leo,
 Gryphon, Raccoon-dog Lion and Elephant-fighter, each of whom carried a
 sharp weapon. With Tawny Lion leading the way each of them set off a
 powerful gale that carried them straight to Mount Leopard Head, where
 there was an all-pervasive smell of smoke and fire and all that could
 be heard was sobbing. When they looked more closely they saw Wily Freak
 and Freaky Wile weeping for their lord.</P>
<P>&#8220;Are you the real Freak and Wile or impostors?&#8221; the evil spirit
 shouted as he went up to them.</P>
<P>Falling to their knees and kowtowing with tears in their eyes, the
 two devils replied, &#8220;We're no impostors. After we were given the silver
 to buy pigs and sheep yesterday we met a monk with a hairy face and a
 mouth like a thunder god in the wide valley to the West of the
 mountain. When he spat on us our legs went all weak, our mouths went
 stiff, we couldn't speak and we couldn't move. He knocked us over,
 found and stole our silver and took our passes off us. We were left in
 a daze till we came round just now. When we got home we found the place
 still on fire and all the buildings burnt down. We were crying so
 bitterly because you, my lord, and all the chiefs had disappeared. We
 don't know how the fire was started.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the evil spirit heard this he could not stop his tears from
 gushing forth as he stamped his feet in fury, let loose heaven-shaking
 roars and exclaimed in hatred and fury, &#8220;Damned baldies! Vicious
 beasts! How could you be so evil? You've destroyed my cave palace and
 burnt my beauty to death. You've killed everyone, young and old, in the
 household. I'm so angry I could die!&#8221;</P>
<P>The old demon then told Monkey Lion to take hold of Tawny Lion,
 saying, &#8220;Grandson, what's done is done. Upsetting yourself won't do you
 any good. What you must do now is summon up all your energy to catch
 those monks in the city.&#8221;</P>
<P>The evil spirit was still crying as he replied, &#8220;Grandfather, this
 mountain palace of mine wasn't built in a day. Now those damned baldies
 have destroyed everything! My life's not worth living!&#8221; With that he
 broke free and flung himself forward to smash his head against the
 rock-face, only stopping after Snowy Lion and Monkey Lion had made
 great efforts to calm him. They then left the cave and all headed for
 the city.</P>
<P>With a roaring wind and in a thick fog they approached the city, so
 frightening all the people living outside the city wall that they
 abandoned their belongings and dragged or carried their children with
 them as they fled into the city. Once the people were all inside the
 gates were shut. A report was then made to the palace that a disaster
 was upon them. When the prince, who was taking a vegetarian breakfast
 in the Gauze Pavilion with the Tang Priest and the others, heard this
 report he went out to ask about it:</P>
<P>&#8220;A whole crowd of evil spirits are heading for the city with
 sandstorms, flying stones, fogs and wind.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Whatever shall we do?&#8221; asked the prince, deeply alarmed.</P>
<P>&#8220;All stop worrying,&#8221; said Brother Monkey, &#8220;all stop worrying. It's
 the evil spirit from Tigermouth Cave who ran away when he was beaten
 yesterday. He went to the Southeast to gang up with the Primal Sage of
 Ninefold Numinosity or whatever he's called and now he's here. We
 brothers are going out. Tell them to shut all the city gates, and send
 men to hold the city wall.&#8221; The prince ordered that the city gates be
 shut, sent men to the wall, and went with his sons and the Tang Priest
 to inspect. The army's banners blotted out the sun, and the cannon fire
 reached the sky as Monkey, Pig and Friar Sand left the city amid wind
 and clouds to give battle. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Because they were careless the weapons were lost,</P>
<P>Which led to attacks by the devilish host.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you do not know the outcome of the battle listen to the
 explanation in the next installment.</P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="1_0_91">Chapter 90</A></H3>
</I>
<P>By Giving and Receiving the Master and the Lion Turn into One</P>
<P>After Stealing the Way and Obstructing Dhyana Ninefold Numinosity Is
 Pacified</P>
</B>
<P>The story tells how the Great Sage Sun left the city with Pig and
 Friar Sand and looked the monsters in the face to see that they were
 all lions of various kinds. The Tawny Lion Spirit was leading, with Leo
 and Elephant-fighter Lion on his left, Gryphon and Raccoon-dog Lion on
 his right and Monkey Lion with Snowy Lion behind him. In the middle of
 them all was a nine-headed lion. The ogre Greenface was holding a
 canopy of brocade embroidered with flowers just behind the nine-headed
 lion; while Wily Freak and Freaky Wile carried a pair of red flags.
 They were all drawn up at a hollow place.</P>
<P>In his rough way Pig went up to them to shout abusively, &#8220;Ogres!
 Thieves! Treasure-stealers! What did you go there and gang up with that
 hairy lot for?&#8221;</P>
<P>To this the Tawny Lion Spirit retorted, gnashing his teeth in fury,
 &#8220;Vicious baldies! When I was alone yesterday the three of you beat me
 and I had to run away. You should have done right, instead of burning
 my cave palace, destroying my mountain home and murdering my family. My
 hatred for you is as great as the ocean. Stay where you are and take
 this from my halberd!&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Pig raised his rake to parry the blow. When the two of
 them had just started fighting and neither was yet coming out on top
 Monkey Lion joined in, swinging his spiked iron club, as did Snowy Lion
 with his three-edged mace.</P>
<P>&#8220;Welcome,&#8221; shouted Pig. Watch him as he charges straight forward to
 meet their onslaught and fight with them all. Friar Sand quickly pulled
 his demon-quelling staff out from where he was at the side and hurried
 forward to help Pig, at which Leo Spirit, Gryphon Spirit,
 Elephant-fighter Spirit and Raccoon-dog Spirit all piled in. The Great
 Sage Monkey held the evil spirits at bay with his gold-banded cudgel.
 Leo fought with a club, Snowy with a bronze hammer, Elephant-fighter
 with a steel spear and Raccoon-dog with a battleaxe.</P>
<P>The fight between the seven lion spirits and the three ferocious
 monks was a splendid one:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Club, hammer, spear, axe and three-edged mace,</P>
<P>Spiked club, ball-staff and four-bright halberd:</P>
<P>Seven lions with seven deadly weapons,</P>
<P>Shouting their war cries as they surround three monks.</P>
<P>Powerful was the Great Sage's gold-banded cudgel;</P>
<P>Friar Sand's staff was almost matchless in the world.</P>
<P>Pig moved around with the power of a whirlwind</P>
<P>As his flashing rake gave off baleful light.</P>
<P>All, displaying their might, blocked before and behind,</P>
<P>Held off the onslaughts with daring and courage.</P>
<P>From the walls of the city the prince lent support,</P>
<P>Where his soldiers felt braver as they beat drums and gongs.</P>
<P>Throwing and thrusting, all showed off their magic,</P>
<P>Turning heaven and earth both dark and upside-down.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After the evil spirits had been fighting the Great Sage and the two
 others for half a day, night fell. Pig by now was dribbling and his
 legs were going weak, so he feinted with his rake and fled in defeat.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where do you think you're going?&#8221; Snowy Lion and Monkey Lion
 shouted. &#8220;Take this!&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot could not dodge them, and he took a heavy blow from the
 mace on his spine that laid him flat on the ground crying out, &#8220;I'm
 done for, I'm done for!&#8221;</P>
<P>The two lion spirits grabbed Pig by the bristles on his neck and by
 his tail and carried him over to see the nine-headed lion,
 &#8220;Grandfather,&#8221; they reported, &#8220;we've caught one of them.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before the words were out of their mouths Friar Sand and Monkey also
 had to fall back, beaten. When the evil spirits all came after them
 Monkey pulled out a handful of hairs, chewed them to pieces, spat them
 out, shouted, &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned them into more than one hundred
 little Monkeys who went round and round, surrounding Snowy, Leo,
 Elephant-fighter, Raccoon-dog and Tawny Lion. Friar Sand and Monkey
 then came forward to join in the fight again. Later that night they
 caught Leo and Gryphon and put Raccoon-dog and Elephant-fighter to
 flight.</P>
<P>When Tawny Lion reported to the old demon that two of the lions had
 been lost the demon ordered, &#8220;Tie Pig up but don't kill him. When they
 give our lions back we'll return Pig to them. If they're stupid enough
 to kill them we'll make Pig pay with his life.&#8221; That evening all the
 fiends slept outside the city.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story now turns to the Great Sage Sun, who carried the two lion
 spirits to beside the city wall, from where the senior prince saw him
 and ordered that the gates be opened. Twenty or thirty officers were
 sent out with rope to tie the lion spirits up and carry them into the
 city. The Great Sage then put his magic hairs away and went straight
 with Friar Sand to the wall tower, where he saw the Tang Priest.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is a terrible business,&#8221; the Tang Priest said. &#8220;Is Wuneng still
 alive?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No problem,&#8221; Brother Monkey replied. &#8220;As we've captured a couple of
 the evil spirits they won't possibly dare harm him. Have them tied up
 tight. I'll swap them for Pig tomorrow morning.&#8221;</P>
<P>The three young princes then kowtowed to Monkey and said, &#8220;When you
 were fighting them at first you were by yourself, Teacher. Then when
 you pretended to run away and came back again there were over a hundred
 of you. How was that done? When you came back to the city wall after
 capturing the evil spirits there was only one of you again. What
 magical powers did you use to do that?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have 84,000 hairs on my body,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Each of them can
 become ten, and the ten become a hundred, so I can do millions and
 millions of transformations. It's extra body magic.&#8221; The princes all
 kowtowed as a vegetarian feast was brought to the tower for them. All
 along the battlements lanterns and banners were displayed. There was
 the sound of clappers, bells, gongs and drums as the watches were
 changed, arrows passed on, cannons fired and warcries shouted.</P>
<P>Soon it was dawn, and the old demon sent for Tawny Lion Spirit to
 make a plan of action: &#8220;You must all use your wits to capture Sun the
 Novice and Friar Sand while I make a secret flight up onto the wall to
 capture their master, the old prince and his sons. I'll take them back
 to the Nine-bend Twisty Cave and wait for you to come back in triumph.&#8221;</P>
<P>Accepting this plan, Tawny Lion took Monkey Lion, Snowy Lion,
 Elephant-fighter and Raccoon-dog back to beside the city wall, all
 carrying their weapons and demanding battle amid winds and fog.</P>
<P>On the other side Monkey and Friar Sand jumped on the wall, where
 Monkey yelled abusively at the top of his voice, &#8220;Thieving damned
 ogres! Give me my brother Pig back this moment and I'll spare your
 lives. If you don't I'll smash your bones to powder and chop you all
 into little pieces.&#8221; With no further argument the evil spirits all
 charged into the attack. The Great Sage and Friar Sand had to use skill
 and cunning to hold the five lions at bay. This fight was very
 different from the one on the previous day.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As an evil wind howled across the land</P>
<P>Black fog blotted out the sky.</P>
<P>Moving stones and flying sands alarmed both gods and demons;</P>
<P>As the trees in the forest fell the tigers and wolves were afraid.</P>
<P>Fierce was the spear of steel and bright the axe,</P>
<P>Merciless the rod, the halberd and the brazen hammer.</P>
<P>They wished they could swallow Monkey up whole,</P>
<P>And capture Friar Sand live and kicking.</P>
<P>The Great Sage's As-You-Will cudgel</P>
<P>Could attack and defend with miraculous effect.</P>
<P>Friar Sand's demon-quelling staff</P>
<P>Had won its fame outside the Hall of Miraculous Mist.</P>
<P>Now that it moved with its magical powers,</P>
<P>It would achieve glory in the West by wiping out demons.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>While the five lion spirits with coats of different colours were
 fighting really well with Monkey and Friar Sand the old demon flew on a
 black cloud straight to the wall tower, where he shook his heads, which
 gave the military and civil officials, Sanzang, the senior prince and
 the soldiers guarding the wall such a fright that they all fell off.
 The demon then charged into the tower, opened his mouths, took Sanzang,
 the senior prince and his sons in them one by one, and went back to the
 hollow ground, where he took Pig in another mouth, one of the nine he
 had in his nine heads. One mouth held the Tang Priest, one Pig, one the
 senior prince, one his eldest son, one the second son and one the third
 son.</P>
<P>With six mouths full of six people he still had three mouths empty
 and wide open as he roared, &#8220;I'm going back ahead.&#8221; The five junior
 lion spirits all fought more bravely than ever now that they had seen
 their grandfather's triumph.</P>
<P>As soon as Monkey heard the yells from the wall and realized he had
 fallen for a trick, he gave Friar Sand a quick shout to be careful then
 pulled all the hairs off his arms, put them in his mouth, chewed them
 up and spat them out as well over a thousand little Monkeys who swarmed
 into the attack. They knocked Monkey Lion over, took Snowy alive,
 captured Elephant-fighter, laid Raccoon-dog Lion low and killed Tawny
 Lion; but as they returned to the city wall with a great hubbub they
 let Greenface, Wily Freak and Freaky Wile escape. When the officers on
 the wall saw what had happened they opened the gates, tied up the five
 lion spirits with ropes and carried them into the city.</P>
<P>But before they could deal with them the princess appeared, sobbing
 and weeping, to say, &#8220;Holy teachers, His Royal Highness the prince, our
 sons and your master are all dead. How ever is this isolated city to
 survive?&#8221;</P>
<P>Putting his magic hairs away, Monkey bowed to her and said, &#8220;Don't
 upset yourself, Princess. It was only because I'd captured seven of his
 lion spirits that the old demon carried off my master, His Royal
 Highness and your sons with catching magic. I'm certain they'll come to
 no harm. My brother-disciple and I will go to his mountain first thing
 tomorrow morning, and I can guarantee that we'll catch the old demon
 and bring your four princes back to you.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the princess and her womenfolk heard this they all bowed to
 Monkey and said, &#8220;We pray that His Royal Highness and his sons will all
 be safe and that our dynasty will be secure.&#8221; When their bowing was
 done the womenfolk all returned to the palace in tears.</P>
<P>&#8220;Skin the Tawny Lion spirit we killed,&#8221; Brother Monkey instructed the
 officials, &#8220;and have the five who are still alive securely tied up and
 put under lock and key. Bring us some vegetarian food to eat before we
 go to sleep. Stop worrying: I promise nothing will go wrong.&#8221;</P>
<P>The next morning the Great Sage took Friar Sand up on an auspicious
 cloud. Before long they were at the top of Bamboo Mountain, and as they
 brought their cloud down to look they saw that it was magnificent:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Rows of jutting peaks,</P>
<P>Sheer and craggy ridges.</P>
<P>In the deep gill waters gently flow;</P>
<P>Flowers weave a fragrant brocade before the beetling cliff,</P>
<P>Where the ridges twist and double back,</P>
<P>Encircled by the ancient winding paths.</P>
<P>When the crane comes the pine has a companion,</P>
<P>And the rock is left alone as the cloud drifts away.</P>
<P>The black ape heads for brightness when looking for fruit;</P>
<P>The deer rejoice in the warming sun as they search for flowers.</P>
<P>The green phoenix sings sweetly</P>
<P>And the golden bird's melodies never stop.</P>
<P>In spring the peach blossom contends with the plum;</P>
<P>In summer the willow and locust trees are rivals.</P>
<P>In autumn are carpets of chrysanthemums,</P>
<P>And in winter the snow flies all around.</P>
<P>Here there is beauty throughout the year,</P>
<P>Where the scenery can compare with Yingzhou's magic land.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As the two of them were standing on the mountain admiring the view
 Greenface suddenly appeared in a ravine between cliffs. He was holding
 a short cudgel. &#8220;Where do you think you're going?&#8221; Monkey shouted. &#8220;I'm
 here.&#8221;</P>
<P>This gave the young devil such a fright that he went running and
 tumbling down the ravine. Monkey and Friar Sand went straight after him
 but could find no sign of where he had gone. When they went further and
 searched around they found a cave palace with double gates of mottled
 stone that were firmly closed. Above the gates a stone tablet was set
 on which was written in large block letters:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>NINE-BEND TWISTY CAVE,</P>
<P>MIGHTY BAMBOO MOUNTAIN</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Now when the junior devil ran inside the cave he had shut the gates
 firmly behind him. Once inside he reported to the old demon, &#8220;My lord,
 those two monks are outside.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Have your lord, Monkey Lion, Snowy Lion, Elephant-fighter and
 Raccoon-dog come back yet?&#8221; the old demon asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I haven't seen them,&#8221; the junior demon replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;There were just the two monks looking around from high up on the
 peak. As soon as I saw them I turned and ran. As they came after me I
 shut the gates.&#8221;</P>
<P>The old demon bowed his head in silence at this news. After a while
 his tears began to flow as he called out, &#8220;This is terrible. My
 grandson Tawny Lion is dead. My grandsons Monkey Lion and the rest of
 them have all been captured by those monks and taken into the city. How
 am I to get my revenge?&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig was tied up nearby, crammed in together with the Tang Priest and
 the princes, terrified and miserable until he heard the old demon
 saying that his grandsons had been captured and taken into the city. At
 this he said with quiet delight, &#8220;Don't be afraid, Master. Cheer up,
 Your Royal Highness. My elder brother has won. He's captured the whole
 lot of the devils and he's found his way here to rescue us.&#8221;</P>
<P>When he had said this the old demon could be heard shouting, &#8220;Little
 ones, guard the place well while I go out to catch those other two
 monks. Then we can punish them all together.&#8221;</P>
<P>Watch him as he strides off without armor or weapons. When he heard
 Monkey shouting he threw the gates of the cave wide open and went
 straight for him, not deigning to answer. Monkey raised his iron cudgel
 to stop him with a blow to the head while Friar Sand swung his staff at
 him. As the demon shook his principal head the eight other heads to
 left and right of it all opened their mouths, with which they gently
 picked Monkey and Friar Sand up and carried them into the cave.</P>
<P>&#8220;Fetch rope,&#8221; he ordered; and Wily Freak, Freaky Wile and Greenface,
 who had come back after their escape the previous night, brought two
 ropes with which they tied the two of them up very securely. &#8220;Impudent
 ape,&#8221; said the old demon, &#8220;you captured my seven grandsons. But now
 I've caught you four monks and the four princes I've got enough to
 ransom them with. Little ones, get some thorns and willow rods and beat
 this ape for me to avenge my grandson Tawny Lion.&#8221;</P>
<P>The three junior devils then beat Monkey with willow rods, but
 Monkey's body had been so toughened that all the rods could do was to
 scratch his itches. He made no sound and was not in the least bothered,
 no matter how hard they hit him. The sight of it, however, made Pig,
 the Tang Priest and the princes all feel their hair standing on end.
 Before long the rods started to break up, but the demons kept on till
 evening, keeping no count of the number of strokes.</P>
<P>Friar Sand was most upset to see Monkey being given so long a
 flogging, so he said, &#8220;Let me take a hundred or so for him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be so impatient,&#8221; the old demon replied, &#8220;you'll get your
 beating tomorrow. You'll all be done in turn.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That means it'll be me the day after tomorrow,&#8221; said Pig with alarm.
 The beating continued for a while as night slowly fell.</P>
<P>&#8220;Little ones,&#8221; the old demon called, &#8220;stop for now. Light the lamp
 and go for something to eat and drink. I'm off to my Brocade Cloud Den
 for a little shut-eye. You three have all had a hard time, so keep a
 close watch on them. We'll carry on with the beatings tomorrow.&#8221; The
 three junior devils moved a lamp over and hit Monkey some more on the
 top of his head with their willow rods, tic-tic-toc, toc-toc-tic, like
 the rhythm of a wooden clapper, sometimes fast and sometimes slow. By
 then it was very late and they all fell asleep.</P>
<P>Monkey now used escaping magic to shrink himself, wriggled out of his
 bonds, shook his fur, straightened up his clothes, took the cudgel out
 of his ear and shook it till it was as thick as a well-bucket and about
 twenty feet long.</P>
<P>Then he said to the three junior devils, &#8220;You animals, you hit me an
 awful lot of times, and now I'm going to return the compliment. I'll
 just shove this at you and see how you like it.&#8221; One gentle push from
 the cudgels turned the three devils into three lumps of minced pork.
 Monkey then turned up the lamp and released Friar Sand.</P>
<P>Pig, who was feeling desperate about being tied up, could not stop
 himself from yelling at the top of his voice, &#8220;My hands and feet are
 tied up so tight they're swollen. Why don't you come and free me?&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot's shout at once woke up the old demon, who rolled straight
 out of bed and called out, &#8220;Who's setting them free?&#8221; The moment Monkey
 heard this he blew out the lamp, smashed his way through several sets
 of doors with his cudgel and fled, not bothering about Friar Sand and
 the rest of them, while the old demon went into the main hall shouting,
 &#8220;Little ones, why's there no light? Don't let them get away!&#8221; He
 shouted once without getting an answer, then again, and still no
 answer.</P>
<P>When he fetched a lantern and looked all he could see were three gory
 lumps of minced meat on the floor. The prince, his sons, the Tang
 Priest and Pig were still there, but Monkey and Friar Sand had
 disappeared. He lit a torch, searched the front and the back and could
 find only Friar Sand, who was still standing pressed against the wall
 of a corridor. The demon knocked him down, tied him up as before, and
 carried on looking for Monkey. Seeing that pair after pair of his doors
 had been smashed down, he realized that Monkey had destroyed them in
 his flight. Instead of giving chase he patched up and blockaded the
 doors and guarded his home.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story now tells how Monkey left the Nine-bend Twisty Cave and
 rode by auspicious cloud straight back to the city of Yuhua, where all
 the local deities and spirits as well as the god of the city could be
 seen bowing in mid-air to greet him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why have you only come to see me today?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;When we knew
 that the worthy prince was entertaining you in Yuhua, Great Sage,&#8221; they
 replied, &#8220;we did not venture to greet you. But now that the princes
 have been captured by ogres and you have subdued those monsters we have
 come to welcome you with kowtows.&#8221; While Monkey was abusing them the
 Gold-headed Protector and the Six Ding and Six Jia generals escorted a
 local deity in and made him kneel on the ground.</P>
<P>&#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; they said, &#8220;we've arrested this ground devil.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What are you making a noise here for instead of guarding my master
 on Bamboo Mountain?&#8221; Monkey yelled.</P>
<P>&#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; the Ding and Jia gods replied, &#8220;the evil spirit caught
 the Curtain-raising General and tied him up again after you escaped. As
 we could see how great his magic powers are we've brought the local
 deity of Bamboo Mountain here. He knows all about that evil spirit's
 background, so we beg you to question him, Great Sage, and find out how
 best to deal with him and deliver the holy monks and worthy princes
 from their suffering.&#8221; When Monkey heard this he was delighted.</P>
<P>&#8220;The old demon came down to Bamboo Mountain the year before last,&#8221;
 the local deity said, shivering and shaking as he kowtowed. &#8220;The
 Nine-bend Twisty Cave used to be the den of six lions. Once the old
 demon came the six lions all took him as their grandfather. He is a
 nine-headed lion called the Primal Sage of Ninefold Numinosity. If you
 want to deal with him you must go to the Wonderful Crag Palace in the
 uttermost East and fetch his master here to subdue him. Nobody else can
 possibly do it.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he thought for a long time before saying, &#8220;The
 Wonderful Crag Palace in the uttermost East is where the Heavenly
 Honoured Saviour of the Great Monad lives. Yes, he does have just such
 a nine-headed lion under his throne. Protector, Jias,&#8221; he ordered, &#8220;go
 back with the local deity and keep a secret watch on the master, my
 brother disciple, the prince of the city and his sons. The city god
 must guard the wall and moat. Off you go.&#8221; The gods all took up guard
 as instructed.</P>
<P>The Great Sage set off his somersault cloud and traveled through the
 night till it was about the last watch, when he reached the Eastern
 Gate of Heaven, where he ran into the Heavenly King Virupaksa with his
 retinue of heavenly soldiers and warriors, who stopped, put their hands
 together in greeting and asked, &#8220;Where are you going, Great Sage?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm off to the Wonderful Crag Palace,&#8221; Monkey replied when he had
 returned their greetings. &#8220;Why have you come to the Eastern Heaven
 instead of following your road to the Western Heaven?&#8221; Virupaksa asked.
 &#8220;When we reached the city of Yuhua,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;the prince of the
 city entertained us and told his three sons to take us as their
 teachers of martial arts. We had a most unpleasant surprise: coming up
 against a gang of lion monsters. Now I'm going to ask the Heavenly
 Honoured Saviour of the Great Monad, the chief monster's owner, to
 subdue him and save my master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It was because you wanted to be a teacher that you provoked that
 trouble with the lions,&#8221; said the heavenly king. &#8220;How true,&#8221; replied
 Monkey with a smile, &#8220;how true.&#8221; The heavenly soldiers and warriors all
 raised joined hands in greeting then stood aside to let him pass.
 Monkey went in through the Eastern Gate of Heaven and was soon at the
 Wonderful Crag Palace. This is what could be seen:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Coloured clouds behind coloured clouds,</P>
<P>Purple mists and rich, green vegetation.</P>
<P>The roof-tiles are a surge of golden flame,</P>
<P>And at the gates are imposing beasts of jade.</P>
<P>Flowers grow between gate towers, round which red mists drift;</P>
<P>The sun shines on turquoise vapors rising from the woods.</P>
<P>All the immortals pay their respects,</P>
<P>And a thousand sages make everything flourish.</P>
<P>The halls of the palace are like layers of brocade;</P>
<P>Windows and pavilions open on all sides.</P>
<P>Azure dragons glow with sacred clouds;</P>
<P>Golden beams of brilliant light come from the magic mists.</P>
<P>This is a land of splendor and eternal joy,</P>
<P>The Wonderful Crag Palace in the uttermost East.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>There was an immortal boy wearing a rainbow mantle standing at the
 palace gates, and as soon as he noticed the Great Sage he went in to
 report, &#8220;My lord, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven who made havoc in
 Heaven is here.&#8221; When the Heavenly Honoured Saviour of the Great Monad
 heard this he ordered all the immortals in attendance on him to go out
 to welcome Monkey and bring him into the palace. Here the Heavenly
 Honoured One was sitting on a nine-coloured lotus throne amid countless
 rays of auspicious light, and when he saw Monkey he came down from his
 throne to greet him while Monkey bowed to him from below.</P>
<P>&#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; the Heavenly Honoured One said, returning his bow, &#8220;I
 haven't seen you for years, but I did hear that you have abandoned the
 Way for Buddhism and are escorting the Tang Priest to fetch the
 scriptures from the Western Heaven. I presume that you have now
 succeeded.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;but near enough. I have escorted the Tang
 Priest as far as Yuhua, where the prince told his three sons to take me
 and the other two as their teachers of martial arts and had copies of
 our three magic weapons made. The weapons were, to our surprise, stolen
 one night. When I searched for them the next day I found that they had
 been stolen by a spirit turned by a golden-haired lion from Tigermouth
 Cave on Mount Leopard Head. I tricked them back from him by cunning,
 whereupon the spirit ganged up with some other lion spirits to give me
 a tremendous fight. One of them is a nine-headed lion with enormous
 magic powers who carried my master, Pig, the prince and his three sons
 to the Ninebend Twisty Cave on Mount Bamboo. When Friar Sand and I went
 to look for them the next day we were carried off too. He had me tied
 up and hit so often I lost count. Luckily I was able to make my
 get-away by magic, but they're still suffering there. When I questioned
 the local deity I found out that you were his master, Heavenly Honoured
 One, which is why I'm here to ask you to subdue the lion and rescue
 them.&#8221;</P>
<P>As soon as the Heavenly Honoured One heard this he sent his immortal
 officers to the lion house to call out his lionkeeper slave and
 question him. The lionkeeper slave was sleeping so deeply that the
 officers had to push and shake him before they could wake him up and
 drag him into the main hall. Here the Heavenly Honoured One asked him,
 &#8220;Where is the lion?&#8221;</P>
<P>All the slave could do was to kowtow with tears streaming down his
 face, pleading, &#8220;Spare me, spare me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The Great Sage Sun is here,&#8221; the Heavenly Honoured One replied, &#8220;so
 I won't have you beaten just yet. You must explain this instant your
 carelessness in letting the nine-headed lion escape.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; the lionkeeper replied, &#8220;I stole and drank a jug of wine I
 saw in the Sweet Dew Palace of the Great Chiliocosm. Before I realized
 what had happened I was dead drunk. It must have slipped its chains and
 got away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That wine was given me by Lord Lao Zi of the Supreme Ultimate,&#8221; the
 Heavenly Honoured One replied. &#8220;It's called Cyclical Nectar, and after
 drinking that you would have slept for three days. How many days has
 the lion been gone?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What the local deity said was that he went down there the year
 before last, which would mean two years or more,&#8221; the Great Sage said.</P>
<P>&#8220;That's right,&#8221; the Heavenly Honoured One said with a smile, &#8220;A day
 in the palaces of Heaven is a year in the mortal world. Get up,&#8221; he
 said to the lion-tamer. &#8220;I'll spare your life. Come down to the lower
 world with the Great Sage and me to recapture him. You immortals can
 all go back. None of you need come with us.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Heavenly Honoured One, the lion-keeper slave and the Great Sage
 all went by cloud straight to Bamboo Mountain, where the Protectors of
 the Four Quarters and the Centre, the Six Dings, the Six Jias and the
 local deity of the mountain all knelt to greet them.</P>
<P>&#8220;Has my master been harmed while you people have been protecting
 him?&#8221; Brother Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The evil spirit was so angry that he went to sleep,&#8221; the gods
 replied. &#8220;He didn't torture them any more.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That Primal Sage of mine is a true soul who has long cultivated the
 Way,&#8221; the Heavenly Honoured One remarked. &#8220;A single call from him will
 go up to the Three Sages and down to the Underworld. He wouldn't kill
 anyone lightly. Great Sage Sun, go to his gates, challenge him to
 battle and draw him outside for us to catch.&#8221;</P>
<P>As soon as Monkey heard this he sprang towards the mouth of the cave,
 brandishing his cudgel and shouting loudly and abusively, &#8220;Damned evil
 spirit, give me my people back! Damned evil spirit, give me my people
 back!&#8221; He shouted several times, but the old demon was fast asleep and
 nobody answered. Monkey lost his patience, swung his cudgel and smashed
 his way inside, still cursing.</P>
<P>Only then did the old demon wake up, rise to his feet and yell with
 great fury, &#8220;I'm coming for you!&#8221; He shook his heads and opened his
 jaws to pick Monkey up.</P>
<P>As Monkey turned and fled the evil spirit chased after him till they
 were outside the cave, shouting, &#8220;Where do you think you're going, you
 thieving ape?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How dare you go on behaving so dreadfully!&#8221; said Monkey with a grin
 from where he was standing on the top of a high cliff. &#8220;You haven't
 even got the sense to realize that your life's at stake. Don't you see
 your master's here?&#8221;</P>
<P>By the time the evil spirit reached the cliff in pursuit of Monkey
 the Heavenly Honoured One had said a spell and shouted, &#8220;I'm here, my
 little Primal Sage.&#8221; Recognizing his master, the monster gave up the
 struggle and lay down with all four feet on the ground, kowtowing.</P>
<P>The lionkeeper then ran over to him, took hold of his mane, and
 punched him hundreds of times on the neck, saying abusively, &#8220;Why did
 you run away, animal? You got me into terrible trouble.&#8221; The lion kept
 his mouths shut and said nothing, not daring to move, and the
 lionkeeper only stopped hitting him when his fist was tired out. When a
 brocade saddlecloth had been put on the animal's back the Heavenly
 Honoured One mounted and shouted to it to go. They then rose up on
 coloured clouds and went straight back to the Wonderful Crag Palace.</P>
<P>After addressing his thanks skywards the Great Sage went into the
 cave and freed first the prince of Yuhua, then Sanzang, then Pig, Friar
 Sand and the three young princes. After this they made a leisurely
 search of the cave and led everyone outside. Pig then fetched some dry
 brushwood, piled it at the front and the back, and started a fire that
 left the Nine-bend Twisty Cave looking like a ruined, burnt-out kiln.
 Monkey released all the gods, ordered the local deity to keep guard on
 it, and told Pig and Friar Sand to use their magic to carry the four
 princes back to the city while he helped the Tang Priest along. They
 were soon back at the city, where the princess and the officials all
 came out to greet them. It was now getting dark, and a vegetarian feast
 was provided for everyone to enjoy. The venerable elder and his
 disciples slept in the Gauze Pavilion once more, and the princes in the
 living quarters of the palace. Of that night no more need be said.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The next day the prince issued an order for another great vegetarian
 banquet to be laid on. Each of the officials high and low in the palace
 expressed his gratitude, and Monkey asked for butchers to slaughter the
 six lions who were still alive, skin them like the tawny lion, and
 prepare their meat to be eaten. The prince, who was delighted with this
 proposal, gave the order for them to be killed. One animal was kept for
 the inside and outside palace staff, one was given to the chief
 administrator and the other officials in the palace, and the flesh of
 the other five was cut into lumps weighing one or two ounces that
 officers distributed among the soldiers and civilians inside and
 outside the city wall so that they could all eat a little. Thus the
 people could both try the taste and overcome their fear. Every single
 household was most impressed.</P>
<P>By now the smiths had made the three weapons and were kowtowing to
 Monkey, saying, &#8220;My lord, we have finished our work.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How heavy are they?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The gold-banded cudgel weighs a thousand pounds,&#8221; the smiths
 replied, &#8220;and the nine-toothed rake and the demon-quelling staff each
 eight hundred pounds.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That'll do,&#8221; said Monkey, who then had the three princes asked to
 come out. As each took his weapon they said to the senior prince, &#8220;Your
 Royal Highness, our weapons have now been finished.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They almost cost both your father and yourselves their lives,&#8221; the
 senior prince replied. &#8220;Thanks to our divine teachers' powers,&#8221; the
 young princes said, &#8220;we were all saved and the evil spirits have been
 wiped out. We'll have no trouble from them in future. Now this really
 is a world at peace with calm seas and rivers running clear.&#8221; The four
 princes then rewarded the smiths and went to the Gauze Pavilion to
 thank the teachers.</P>
<P>Sanzang told the Great Sage and the other two to pass on some more
 martial skills quickly so as not to delay their journey. The three of
 them all swung their weapons in the palace yard as they taught the
 secrets one by one. Within a few days the three young princes were all
 skilled performers. They also mastered all the seventy-two routines of
 attack, retreat and fast and slow fighting. This was firstly because
 the princes were all thoroughly determined, and secondly because the
 Great Sage Sun had given them the divine strength beforehand that
 enabled them to lift and move the thousand-pound cudgel and the
 eight-hundred-pound rake and staff. There was all the difference in the
 world between their present skills and those they had had before, and
 there is a poem that goes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When they celebrated their fortune in finding divine teachers</P>
<P>They never expected their studies to alert a lion spirit.</P>
<P>With evil destroyed the country was at peace;</P>
<P>The frontier was settled as all were devoted to the one</P>
<P>Entity. Ninefold Numinosity's powers lasted through their many
 clashes</P>
<P>Till the Way was achieved with all-round expertise.</P>
<P>The brilliant teaching would be passed on for ever,</P>
<P>And Yuhua know eternal peace and joy.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The prince then gave another great banquet to thank the three
 teachers, and a huge dish of gold and silver was brought out as a
 reward. &#8220;Take it straight back inside,&#8221; Monkey said with a smile, &#8220;take
 it straight back. We're monks, and that's no use to us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We really can't take gold or silver,&#8221; put in Pig who was standing
 beside him, &#8220;but the lion spirits tore our clothes to ribbons. If you
 could give us a change of clothing that would be very kind of you.&#8221; The
 prince ordered his tailors to fetch some bolts of blue, red and brown
 brocade and make each of them a garment after the style and colours of
 their old ones. The three of them were delighted to accept and put on
 their new brocade tunics, after which they packed up the luggage and
 set off on their way again. Everyone inside and outside the city,
 whether young or old, exclaimed that they were arhats and living
 Buddhas come down to earth. Crowds packed the streets to the sound of
 drums and music, and banners flew overhead. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>From the gate of every family the incense smoke arose;</P>
<P>At every household's door coloured lanterns hung in rows.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The people only went back after seeing them for a long way along
 their journey. Only then did the four travelers manage to leave the
 city and head West. By leaving they shook off all thought and immersed
 their hearts in the True Achievement. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Free from thought and worry, the Buddha's land they seek,</P>
<P>Going faithfully, sincerely, towards the Vulture Peak.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you do not know how much further the journey was to be or when it
 was to end, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

</I>
<P>Admiring the Moon Festival Lanterns in Jinping</P>
<P>The Tang Priest Confesses in Dark Essence Cave</P>
</B>
<P>Where should one strive to practice dhyana?</P>
<P>Swiftly to extirpate the misdeeds of the thought-horse and the
 mind-ape.</P>
<P>When they are firmly tethered they give off radiance,</P>
<P>But whoever halts falls to the three paths of suffering.</P>
<P>If one allows the divine elixir to leak away,</P>
<P>The jade-pure nature will wither as one slackens.</P>
<P>Anger, joy and worry must all be swept away:</P>
<P>When the wonderful mystery is gained it seems like nothing.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story tells how the Tang Priest and his three disciples left the
 city of Yuhua and had a very easy journey in what really was a land of
 paradise. When they had been travelling for five or six days another
 city appeared.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where is this?&#8221; the Tang Priest asked Brother Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's a city,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;but there are no flags on the poles
 above the city wall and I don't know this area, so I'll ask when we get
 closer.&#8221; When they reached the Eastern suburb they found it noisy with
 bars and tea-houses and bustling with a rice market and oil shops. Some
 idlers who were wandering in the streets with nothing better to do
 crowded round for a better look when they saw Pig's long snout, Friar
 Sand's black face and Monkey's red eyes, but they dared not come any
 closer to question the travelers. The Tang Priest was sweating with the
 worry that they would provoke trouble as they crossed several more
 streets and had still not yet reached the city wall. Then they saw a
 monastery gate over which were the words CLOUDS OF COMPASSION
 MONASTERY.</P>
<P>&#8220;What about going in here to give the horse a rest and take a meal?&#8221;
 the Tang Priest suggested, to which Monkey replied, &#8220;Splendid,
 splendid.&#8221; The four of them then went inside, and this is what they
 saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Splendid, towering buildings,</P>
<P>Gleaming bases for statues..</P>
<P>The Buddha hall rise above the clouds;</P>
<P>The monks' cells lie in the moonlit silence.</P>
<P>Red mists circle the stupas;</P>
<P>In the shade of jade-green trees the scripture-wheel is cool.</P>
<P>This is a true Pure Land,</P>
<P>Another Naga Palace,</P>
<P>Where purple mists surround the Mahavira Hall.</P>
<P>The cloisters are never empty of people enjoying the sights,</P>
<P>And visitors climb the pagoda that is always open.</P>
<P>Incense burns in the stand at every moment,</P>
<P>And lamps shine on the altar through the night.</P>
<P>A golden bell rings rhythmically in the abbot's lodgings</P>
<P>As monks worship the Buddha by reciting sutras.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As the four of them looked around a monk came along the cloister and
 said to the Tang Priest with polite gestures of greeting, &#8220;Where have
 you come from, Teacher?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;From the Tang Court in China,&#8221; the Tang Priest replied, at which the
 monk went down on his knees to kowtow, only to be quickly helped up by
 the Tang Priest, who asked, &#8220;Why do you perform this great courtesy,
 reverend abbot?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;All the lovers of goodness here who read the sutras and recite the
 name of the Buddha hope to achieve rebirth in your land of China, so
 that when I saw you coming in your magnificent mitre and robes I was
 certain that your present splendor must be the result of your
 successful cultivation in earlier lives. That's why it is right to
 kowtow to you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It alarmed me,&#8221; said the Tang Priest with a smile, &#8220;it alarmed me. I
 am only an itinerant monk, and know no splendor at all. To be able to
 live at your leisure and ease as you do, abbot, is real bliss.&#8221; The
 monk then led the Tang Priest to worship the Buddha statues in the main
 hall. It was only now that Sanzang called for his disciples. After
 seeing their master start talking to the monk, Monkey and the other two
 had been standing in a group with their faces averted, holding the
 horse's bridle and looking after the luggage, so that the monk had not
 noticed them.</P>
<P>But when they turned round on hearing the Tang Priest's call the
 sight of them so frightened the monk that he called out, &#8220;My lord, why
 are your distinguished disciples so hideously ugly?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Ugly they may be,&#8221; the Tang Priest replied, &#8220;but they do have some
 magical powers. I have been very grateful for their protection all the
 way along the journey.&#8221;</P>
<P>As they were speaking more monks came out to greet them. The monk who
 had been the first to welcome the visitors explained to the others,
 &#8220;This teacher has come from Great Tang in China, and these three
 gentlemen are his distinguished disciples.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Teacher,&#8221; said the others with mixed pleasure and apprehension, &#8220;why
 have you come here from Great China?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have been commanded by the Tang emperor to worship the Buddha and
 seek the scriptures in the Western Heaven,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;As I was
 passing this way I have come to your monastery to ask where we are and
 take a vegetarian meal before setting out again.&#8221; The monks were all
 delighted, and they invited the visitors into the abbot's lodgings,
 where there were some more monks who were performing ceremonies on
 behalf of benefactors.</P>
<P>The monk who had met them first went on to explain to the others,
 &#8220;Come and have a look at what people from China are like: some are
 handsome and some are ugly. The beauty of the handsome ones could never
 be caught in a painting or drawing, and the ugly ones look really
 weird.&#8221; Both the monks and the benefactors all came to greet them,
 after which everyone sat down.</P>
<P>When tea had been drunk the Tang Priest inquired, &#8220;What is this fine
 country called?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is Jinping, one of the outer prefectures of India,&#8221; the monks
 replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;How far is it from this prefecture to Vulture Peak?&#8221; the Tang Priest
 asked. &#8220;It is about seven hundred miles from here to the capital,&#8221; the
 monks replied, &#8220;and we have walked that distance. As we haven't gone
 further West to Vulture Peak we don't know how far that is and would
 not like to make a wild guess.&#8221; The Tang Priest thanked them.</P>
<P>A little later a vegetarian meal was provided, after which the Tang
 Priest wanted to be on his way, only to be pressed to stay by the monks
 and the benefactors who said, &#8220;Teacher, you must stay for a couple of
 days or so. Enjoy the Full Moon Festival before you go on your way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;On my journey I have only been aware of mountains and rivers and the
 danger of running into ogres or monsters,&#8221; the Tang Priest replied,
 &#8220;and I have lost my sense of time. I don't know when Full Moon is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's because your heart is so set on worshipping the Buddha and on
 enlightenment that you have not thought about it, Teacher,&#8221; the monks
 replied. &#8220;Today is the thirteenth of the first month and the lanterns
 will be tried out tonight. The day after tomorrow is the fifteenth,
 when the festival begins, and it goes on till the lanterns are put away
 on the eighteenth or nineteenth. We enjoy celebrations here and our
 prefect, who cares for the people, has lanterns set out everywhere and
 music played all night. We also have a Bridge of Golden Lamps&#8212;it's an
 ancient tradition that still flourishes. If you will stay for a few
 days, my lords, our monastery can certainly afford to entertain you.&#8221;
 The Tang Priest had no choice but to stay. As the bell and drum in the
 Buddha hall resounded to the skies the faithful came in from the
 streets bringing lanterns to present to the Buddha. The Tang Priest and
 the rest of them came out of the abbot's lodgings to look at the
 lanterns, after which everyone turned in.</P>
<P>The next day, when they had eaten the vegetarian breakfast the monks
 of the monastery brought them, they strolled in the garden at the back.
 It really was a lovely place:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>It is the first month of the year,</P>
<P>The beginning of the spring.</P>
<P>The wooded garden is quiet and elegant;</P>
<P>The beauty of the scene subdued.</P>
<P>Throughout the four seasons flowers and trees contend;</P>
<P>Turquoise peaks rise behind each other.</P>
<P>Fragrant flowers are growing before the steps,</P>
<P>And scent comes from the plum-tree's branches.</P>
<P>Where there is red it joins the tender peach blossom;</P>
<P>Where there is green it mingles with the willows' fresh green.</P>
<P>Forget about the splendor of the Gold Valley Garden;</P>
<P>Say nothing of the Wang River landscapes painted by Wang Wei.</P>
<P>In the flowing stream</P>
<P>The wild ducks bob and rise;</P>
<P>Among bamboos by the thousand</P>
<P>Poets ponder their choice of words.</P>
<P>Tree and herbaceous peonies, myrtle, fleeting-smile flowers,</P>
<P>That waken when their time is due;</P>
<P>Camellias, red plum blossom, winter jasmine and daphne,</P>
<P>All early to open out their beauty.</P>
<P>The snow piled by the hidden cliff seems frozen solid still;</P>
<P>The clouds that drift by the distant trees already bring early traces
 of spring.</P>
<P>The deer sees its reflection beside the pool;</P>
<P>Cranes come to hear the lute beneath the pines.</P>
<P>A few halls and pavilions to East and West,</P>
<P>Where travelers may stay;</P>
<P>Buildings and pagodas to North and South</P>
<P>Where monks may meditate in peace.</P>
<P>Among the flowers</P>
<P>Are one or two houses to nourish one's nature,</P>
<P>Where double eaves rise above each other.</P>
<P>Amid the hills and streams</P>
<P>Are three or four cells in which to reline magic, Peaceful and light.</P>
<P>This is indeed a natural spot for a recluse:</P>
<P>Why look elsewhere for the earthly paradise?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After a day enjoying the garden they inspected the lanterns in the
 Buddha hall before going to look at the lantern festival. This is what
 they saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A splendid city of agate,</P>
<P>A fairyland of glass;</P>
<P>Palaces of crystal and mica,</P>
<P>Like layer upon layer of brocade,</P>
<P>Openwork carving behind openwork carving.</P>
<P>The dazzling bridge of stars moved heaven and earth</P>
<P>While trees of fire made waves of red</P>
<P>Flutes and drums played in the streets.</P>
<P>A moon like a ring of jade hung over a thousand gates;</P>
<P>Fragrant breezes blew through ten thousand homes.</P>
<P>There were giant turtle peaks soaring on high,</P>
<P>Fishes and dragons emerging from the sea,</P>
<P>Phoenixes sporting in the sky.</P>
<P>As all admired the moon and the lanterns</P>
<P>The atmosphere was full of harmony.</P>
<P>Among the crowds dressed in fine silks</P>
<P>All enjoyed the songs and panpipes.</P>
<P>Carriages rumbled along.</P>
<P>There was no end of beautiful faces,</P>
<P>Dashing gallants, And marvellous sights.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Sanzang and the others had looked at the lanterns in the
 monastery they wandered around the streets of the Eastern suburb, not
 going back to bed till the second watch in the middle of the night.</P>
<P>The next day Sanzang said to the monks, &#8220;I made a vow to sweep
 pagodas, and on the occasion of tonight's Moon Festival I would like to
 ask the reverend abbot to open the doors of the pagoda to allow me to
 fulfil this vow.&#8221; The monks opened the doors, and when Friar Sand
 fetched his cassock and brought it to him on the ground floor he put it
 over his shoulders and prayed to the Buddha. Then he swept the ground
 floor with a broom, took the cassock off and gave it back to Friar
 Sand. He swept the second story next, and so on story by story till he
 reached the top. In every story there was a Buddha, and in each one he
 opened all the windows, swept the floor, and enjoyed the splendid
 views. By the time he had finished sweeping and come down again it was
 late and all the lamps had been lit.</P>
<P>It was now the night of the full moon. &#8220;Venerable teacher,&#8221; the monks
 said, &#8220;last night you only saw the lamps in our humble monastery and
 the outskirts of the city. As tonight is the main festival why don't we
 go into the city to see the golden lamps there?&#8221; The Tang Priest was
 glad to follow this suggestion, and he went with his three disciples
 and the monks of the monastery into the city to see the lanterns.
 Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On the festive fifteenth night</P>
<P>The harmony of spring begins with the first full moon.</P>
<P>Decorated lanterns hang in the busy markets</P>
<P>As all sing the songs of a world at peace.</P>
<P>Over the lantern light in streets and markets</P>
<P>The moon's round mirror rises in the sky</P>
<P>Like a silver dish, driven by the charioteer Ping Yi.</P>
<P>The lanterns were like a brocade carpet woven by fairies;</P>
<P>The lanterns were reflected by the moon,</P>
<P>Doubling its brilliance;</P>
<P>The moon shone on the lanterns,</P>
<P>Making them resplendent.</P>
<P>There was no end of iron-chain star bridges,</P>
<P>Lantern flowers and trees of fire.</P>
<P>Snowflake lanterns,</P>
<P>Plum-blossom lanterns,</P>
<P>Like fragments of ice in spring;</P>
<P>Embroidered screen lanterns,</P>
<P>Painted screen lanterns,</P>
<P>Made up from every color.</P>
<P>Walnut lanterns,</P>
<P>Lotus lanterns,</P>
<P>Hung high on lantern towers;</P>
<P>Blue lion lanterns,</P>
<P>White elephant lanterns,</P>
<P>Fixed on lofty frames.</P>
<P>Shrimp lanterns,</P>
<P>Terrapin lanterns,</P>
<P>Placed in front of awnings;</P>
<P>Goat lanterns,</P>
<P>Hare lanterns,</P>
<P>Bringing the eaves to life.</P>
<P>Eagle lanterns,</P>
<P>Phoenix lanterns,</P>
<P>Lined up next to each other;</P>
<P>Tiger lanterns,</P>
<P>Horse lanterns,</P>
<P>Being carried along together.</P>
<P>Red-crowned crane lanterns,</P>
<P>White deer lanterns,</P>
<P>Carrying the Star of Longevity;</P>
<P>Goldfish lanterns,</P>
<P>Whale lanterns,</P>
<P>On which rode the poet Li Bai.</P>
<P>Giant turtle mountain lanterns,</P>
<P>Where gods and immortals gathered;</P>
<P>Revolving horse lanterns</P>
<P>On which warriors joined combat.</P>
<P>The towers of lanterns on thousands of houses</P>
<P>Made a world of clouds and smoke for several miles.</P>
<P>On one side, shining reins and flying jade saddles;</P>
<P>On the other, rumbling carriages leave fragrance behind.</P>
<P>On the red balcony,</P>
<P>Leaning against the railings,</P>
<P>Behind the curtains,</P>
<P>Shoulder to shoulder,</P>
<P>Hand in hand,</P>
<P>Pairs of beauties were eager for the fun.</P>
<P>By the bridge over green waters,</P>
<P>Noisy,</P>
<P>Many-coloured,</P>
<P>Drunken,</P>
<P>Laughing</P>
<P>Couples enjoyed the brilliant sights.</P>
<P>All of the city's flutes and drums were playing;</P>
<P>Panpipes and songs went on all night.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>There is also this poem as evidence:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Amid the fine brocades, of lotus were the songs;</P>
<P>This blessed land at peace was full of many throngs.</P>
<P>The lanterns and the moon upon this festive night</P>
<P>Foretold rich harvests after rain and wind just right.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This was a night when the curfew was relaxed, so that there were huge
 crowds and a great commotion. People were dancing, walking on stilts,
 wearing masks and riding elephants, pushing and crowding to East and to
 West as they looked all around. When they reached the bridge of golden
 lamps the Tang Priest and the monks pushed forward for a look and saw
 that it consisted of three golden lamps each the size of a water vat
 and shaped like a two-storied pavilion with a light shining out through
 intricate gold and silver filigree openwork. Glazed ceramic tiles
 inside the lamps reflected their light. They were so bright they
 outshone the moon, and their oil was very fragrant.</P>
<P>&#8220;What sort of oil do those lamps burn?&#8221; the Tang Priest asked the
 monks, &#8220;and why does it smell so remarkably good?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You wouldn't know that, Teacher,&#8221; the monks replied. &#8220;There is a
 county near this prefecture called Mintian. In the whole county there
 are 240 wards, and when we have our annual assignment of jobs to be
 done for the state, 240 households have to provide oil. All the other
 jobs assigned by the prefecture or county are reasonable enough, but
 these oil households have a very hard time. Every household has to take
 it on for a year, and it costs them over two hundred ounces of silver.
 The oil isn't ordinary oil but perfumed refined butter oil. One ounce
 costs two ounces of silver and a pound costs thirty-two ounces. Each of
 the lamps holds five hundred pounds of oil, making 1,500 pounds for the
 three of them, costing 48,000 ounces of silver. With other
 miscellaneous expenses it comes to over 50,000 ounces. And that only
 lasts three nights.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How can so much oil be used up in only three nights?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;In each lamp there are forty-nine big wicks about the size of an egg
 made of rushes wrapped in silk floss,&#8221; the monks explained. &#8220;When they
 have burned for one night the Lord Buddhas appear, the oil all vanishes
 and the lamp goes out.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I suppose the Lord Buddhas take all the oil,&#8221; said Pig with a grin
 as he stood at one side.</P>
<P>&#8220;That's right,&#8221; the monks replied, &#8220;that's what everyone in the city
 has always said ever since ancient times. If the oil runs dry they say
 that the Buddhas have taken the oil and the crops will certainly be
 bountiful; but if it doesn't dry up on one occasion there will be
 famine, drought and the wrong weather at the wrong time in that year.
 That's why everyone makes this offering.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As they were talking there was the howling of a wind up in the air,
 sending everyone who was admiring the lanterns fleeing in terror. The
 monks could not hold their ground either. &#8220;Let's go back, venerable
 teacher,&#8221; they said, &#8220;the wind's here. It's the Lord Buddhas bringing
 blessings. They're here to see the lanterns.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you tell that?&#8221; the Tang Priest asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's the same every year,&#8221; the monks replied. &#8220;The wind blows up
 before the third watch. Everybody gets out of the way as they know that
 it is the Lord Buddhas bringing down blessings.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am one who thinks of, invokes and worships Buddhas,&#8221; the Tang
 Priest said. &#8220;If the Buddhas are honoring us with their presence on
 this festive occasion it would be wonderful to be able to worship
 them.&#8221; He rejected the monks' repeated urgings to go back, and a little
 later the forms of three Buddhas appeared in the wind and approached
 the lamps. The Tang Priest was so excited that he ran to the top of the
 lamp bridge and threw himself down worship.</P>
<P>Brother Monkey rushed forward in alarm to drag him to his feet and
 say, &#8220;They're no good, Master. I'm sure they're evil.&#8221; Before the words
 were even out of his mouth the lamps all went out as with a great
 whoosh the Tang Priest was swept up by the wind. It was terrible! Who
 knew what evil monsters from what cave in what mountain had been posing
 as Buddhas to watch the golden lamps?</P>
<P>Pig and Friar Sand were thrown into such panic that they rushed all
 about, searching and calling for their master. &#8220;Brothers,&#8221; called
 Monkey, &#8220;no use shouting here. The master's bliss has turned to
 disaster. He's been carried off by evil spirits.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you tell that, my lord,&#8221; the appalled monks asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;You're just a bunch of mortals,&#8221; Monkey replied with a grin, &#8220;so you
 haven't realized what's been happening all these years. The evil
 spirits have fooled you into thinking they're true Buddhas coming down
 to accept the offerings of lamps. The Buddhas that appeared when the
 wind blew just now were three evil spirits. My master didn't realize
 who they were, so he went up on the top of the bridge to worship them.
 They covered up all the lights and carried him off together with the
 oil in the lamps. As I was a bit too late the three of them got away by
 wind.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;Whatever are we to do?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Not a moment to lose,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;You two go back the monastery
 with the monks and look after the horse and the luggage. I'm going
 after them while this wind's still blowing.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage then shot up by his somersault cloud into mid
 air, picked up the stench of the wind and headed Northeast in pursuit,
 carrying on till all of a sudden the wind dropped at dawn. A great
 mountain could be seen, a most steep, towering and splendid mountain:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Many a foothill and ravine,</P>
<P>Twisting and bending streams.</P>
<P>Creepers hang from the beetling precipice,</P>
<P>Pine and cypress rise from the lonely rock.</P>
<P>Cranes cry in the morning mists,</P>
<P>Wild geese call among the clouds at dawn.</P>
<P>Jutting peaks like a row of halberds,</P>
<P>Jagged crags of interlocking rocks.</P>
<P>The summits rise to eighty thousand feet,</P>
<P>And sheer-walled ridges make a thousand angles.</P>
<P>Wild flowers and noble trees all flourish with the spring;</P>
<P>Cuckoo and oriole respond to the scenery with song.</P>
<P>Majestic beauty,</P>
<P>Towering grandeur,</P>
<P>Steep, grotesque crags hard to climb.</P>
<P>One will stay there long in silence:</P>
<P>All that can be heard are tigers and leopards breathing.</P>
<P>River deer and white deer wander around;</P>
<P>Jade-coloured hares and gray wolves come and go.</P>
<P>The stream in the deep ravine will flow for a million miles;</P>
<P>Twisting torrents splash loud against the rocks.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>While the Great Sage was on the top of a scar looking for his way he
 saw four people coming from the Western slopes driving three goats and
 all shouting, &#8220;New Year.&#8221; Monkey's fiery eyes with their golden pupils
 flashed as he took a closer look to see that they were the four Duty
 Gods of the year, the month, the day and the hour in disguise.</P>
<P>The Great Sage then pulled out his iron cudgel, shook it till it was
 as thick as a ricebowl and about twelve feet long and sprang down from
 the cliff with a shout of, &#8220;Where are you skulking off to like that,
 trying to hide your faces?&#8221;</P>
<P>When the four Duty Gods realized that he had rumbled them they at
 once turned back into their normal selves, kowtowed beside the path and
 said, &#8220;Forgive us, Great Sage, forgive us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Just because I haven't had any jobs for you recently you thought I
 was getting lax and so you've all become very casual,&#8221; Monkey said.
 &#8220;You didn't even greet me. It's outrageous! Why aren't you giving my
 master your secret protection? Where are you going?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Because your master somewhat forgot his dhyana nature and was so
 eager to enjoy himself in the Clouds of Compassion Monastery in Jinping
 Prefecture,&#8221; the Duty Gods said, &#8220;he met with evil at the height of
 splendor, his joy turned to disaster, and he was captured by the evil
 spirits. The Defenders of the Faith are looking after him at the
 moment. We realized that you would be coming after him this very night,
 Great Sage, and we came here to report to you in case you did not know
 the mountains and forests here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you were here to report,&#8221; said Brother Monkey, &#8220;why did you
 disguise your identities, why were you driving three goats, and what
 were you shouting and yelling for?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The three goats were for luck at the beginning of the year.</P>
<P>They are to drive away the evil that's obstructing your master.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey had been absolutely determined to beat them, but on hearing
 this explanation he let them off and put his cudgel away as his fury
 turned to delight. &#8220;Are there evil spirits on this mountain?&#8221; he asked.
 &#8220;Yes,&#8221; they replied, &#8220;yes. This mountain is called Green Dragon
 Mountain and there's a cave in it called the Dark Essence Cave where
 three evil spirits live. The oldest is called King Cold-avoider, the
 second is called King Heat-avoider and the third is called King
 Dust-avoider. They've lived here for a thousand years and have been
 fond of refined butter oil since they were children. Ever since they
 became spirits some years ago they've been pretending to be Buddhas to
 trick the officials and people of Jinping into setting out those golden
 lamps full of the refined butter oil that they take in their Buddha
 guises in the middle of every first month. When they saw your master
 this time they realized that he was a holy monk and carried him off to
 the cave too. Any day now they'll slice off his flesh to fry in the
 refined butter. You must use your skills to save him as soon as
 possible.&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing this Monkey dismissed the four Duty Gods with a shout and
 went round the mountain looking for the cave. Within a mile or two he
 saw a rock face by a gill, at the foot of which was a stone building
 with a pair of stone doors that stood ajar. Beside the doors was a
 stone tablet on which was inscribed</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>GREEN DRAGON MOUNTAIN</P>
<P>DARK ESSENCE CAVE</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Not daring to go in uninvited, Monkey stopped and called, &#8220;Give me my
 master back at once, monster.&#8221; With a great noise the doors burst wide
 open, and out rushed a crowd of bull-headed demons who glared as they
 asked, &#8220;Who are you, yelling here like that?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm the senior disciple of the holy monk Tang Sanzang who's come
 from Great Tang in the East to fetch scriptures,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;He
 was looking at the lanterns in Jinping along our way when your chief
 demons carried him off here. Give him back at once if you want me to
 spare your lives. If you don't I'll turn our den upside-down and turn
 all you demons into just pus and blood.&#8221;</P>
<P>As soon as the junior demons heard this they rushed inside to report,
 &#8220;Disaster, Your Majesties, disaster!&#8221; The three old evil spirits had
 taken Sanzang into the depths of the cave and with no further ado were
 telling their underlings to strip him and wash him with water from the
 torrent. They were just about to have him sliced and diced into tiny
 pieces to fry in the refined butter when they heard the report of
 disaster from outside. The oldest demon king asked with some alarm what
 had happened.</P>
<P>&#8220;There's a hairy-faced monk who looks like a thunder god outside,&#8221;
 the junior devils replied. &#8220;He's shouting that Your Majesties carried
 his master here and wants him given back straight away if our lives are
 to be spared. Otherwise he'll turn our den upside-down and turn us all
 into pus and blood.&#8221;</P>
<P>This news shocked the demon kings, who all said, &#8220;We've only just
 caught the wretch, and haven't even asked him his name and his
 background. Little ones, dress him again and bring him here to be
 questioned. We must find out who he is and where he's from.&#8221;</P>
<P>A crowd of devils untied the Tang Priest, put his clothes back on and
 pushed him to before the thrones, where he fell to his knees, trembling
 with fear, and pleaded, &#8220;Spare my life, Your Majesties, spare my life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you from, monk?&#8221; the three evil spirits said, all talking
 at once, &#8220;and why did you rush into the way of our clouds instead of
 avoiding the Buddha images?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have been sent by the Great Tang Emperor in the East to worship
 the Lord Buddha and fetch the scriptures from the Great Thunder
 Monastery in India,&#8221; Sanzang replied with kowtows. &#8220;When I went into
 the Clouds of Compassion Monastery for a vegetarian meal the monks
 there pressed me to stay to see the lanterns at the Moon Festival.
 Seeing Your Majesties appearing as Buddhas from the bridge of golden
 lamps I kowtowed to you because my mortal eyes took you for real
 Buddhas. That's why I got in the way of your clouds, Your Majesties.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How long was the journey from your country in the East to here?&#8221; the
 evil spirits asked. &#8220;How many people have you got with you? What are
 they called? Tell us the truth straight away and we'll spare your
 life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My secular name was Chen Xuanzang,&#8221; the Tang Priest replied, &#8220;and I
 was a monk in the Jinshan Monastery from boyhood. Later I was given
 official rank as a monk in the Hongfu Monastery in Chang'an. When the
 minister Wei Zheng beheaded the Dragon King of the River Jing in his
 dream and the Tang emperor came back to life after his travels in the
 underworld, a Great Land and Water Mass was held for the rebirth of
 souls. The Tang emperor chose me to officiate at this ceremony and
 expound the great principles. The Bodhisattva Guanyin appeared during
 the mass and informed me that in the Thunder Monastery in the Western
 Heaven there are three stores of true scriptures that can carry the
 dead up to Heaven. I was sent to fetch them and given the title
 Sanzang, or &#8220;Three Stores.&#8221; As I use Tang as my surname people call me
 Tang Sanzang. I have three disciples. The first one is called Sun
 Wukong the Novice, and he is the Great Sage Equaling Heaven who has
 been converted to the truth.&#8221;</P>
<P>This news came as a shock to the evil spirits, who asked, &#8220;Did this
 Great Sage Equaling Heaven make great havoc in Heaven five hundred
 years ago?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; the Tang Priest said. &#8220;The second one is called Zhu
 Wuneng or Zhu Bajie. He is Marshal Tian Peng come down to earth. The
 third is Sha Wujing, or Friar Sand, the Curtain-lifting General in
 mortal reincarnation.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's as well we haven't eaten him yet,&#8221; the evil spirits all
 exclaimed in horror. &#8220;Little ones, lock the Tang Priest in iron chains
 at the back. When we've caught his three disciples we'll eat them
 together.&#8221; They then mustered a force of armed yak, water-buffalo and
 ox spirits to go outside carrying bugles, waving banners and beating
 drums.</P>
<P>Once the three evil spirits were fully clad in their armor they went
 out and shouted, &#8220;Who's that who dares come here shouting like that?&#8221;
 Monkey slipped round behind the scar to have a good look, and this is
 what the evil spirits were like:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Multi-coloured faces, round eyes,</P>
<P>Towering horns.</P>
<P>Four sharp-pointed ears,</P>
<P>Neat and shining bright.</P>
<P>Bodies patterned like a painting,</P>
<P>Covered with brocades that shine like fireflies.</P>
<P>The first one wore a hat of foxes' fur</P>
<P>And hot steam rose from the long hairs of his face.</P>
<P>The second wore a flaming cloak of lightest gauze</P>
<P>And had four gleaming, jade-like hooves.</P>
<P>The third had a mighty roar like thunder;</P>
<P>His sharp and pointed fangs were just like silver needles.</P>
<P>Each was brave and fierce</P>
<P>As they carried their three weapons;</P>
<P>One used a battle-axe,</P>
<P>One was an expert in the cutlass,</P>
<P>And the third had a knotted flail resting on his shoulders.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The other evil spirits, tall and short, fat and thin, senior and
 junior, were all cattle-headed monsters carrying spears or clubs. There
 were three big banners clearly inscribed with the words &#8220;King
 Cold-avoider,&#8221; &#8220;King Heat-avoider&#8221; and &#8220;King Dust-avoider.&#8221; After
 looking at all this for a while Monkey lost his patience and went up to
 them with a shout of, &#8220;Can you recognize Monkey, thieving damned
 ogres?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Are you the Sun Wukong who made havoc in Heaven?&#8221; the evil spirits
 shouted back. &#8220;It really is a case of</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I heard your name before I saw your face:</P>
<P>The sight of that would bring the gods disgrace.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>So all you are is a macaque.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll get you, you lamp-oil thieves,&#8221; Monkey retorted in high
 dudgeon. &#8220;Don't talk such rubbish, you smooth-tongued monsters. Give my
 master back at once.&#8221; With that he advanced and swung his iron cudgel,
 to be parried by the old demons who raised their weapons to meet the
 blow. A splendid fight ensued in the mountain hollow:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Battle-axe, cutlass and flail</P>
<P>Met by the Monkey King's lone cudgel.</P>
<P>Cold-avoider, Heat-avoider and Dust-avoider</P>
<P>Had heard of the Great Sage Equaling Heaven.</P>
<P>When the cudgel rose it scared demons and gods;</P>
<P>Axe and cutlass hacked and flew.</P>
<P>A primal dharma image of true emptiness</P>
<P>Holding off three demons masquerading as Buddhas.</P>
<P>Their noses all greasy with this year's stolen oil,</P>
<P>They tried to snatch the monk sent by the emperor.</P>
<P>One for his master's sake feared not the lengthy road;</P>
<P>The others in their greed had lamps offered every year.</P>
<P>All that could be beard was clash of axe and cutlass</P>
<P>And the noisy clatter of the cudgel.</P>
<P>With clashes and lunges three fought against one</P>
<P>As each showed his skill with blocks and parries.</P>
<P>They fought from dawn till almost nightfall</P>
<P>And a victor had yet to emerge in the struggle.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>By the time Monkey's cudgel had gone 150 rounds with the three demons
 it was nearly evening and the outcome was still in doubt. Then
 Dust-avoider sprang forward from the ranks with a swing of his flail
 and waved a flag, whereupon the crowd of cattle-headed demons swarmed
 round Monkey, encircling him and swinging wildly at him with their
 weapons. Seeing that things were going badly, Monkey set off his
 somersault cloud and fled in a whoosh. The demons did not go after him
 but called their devils back so that everyone could have an evening
 meal. They told the junior devils to take a bowl of food to Sanzang as
 well: he was not to be dealt with until Monkey had been caught. As the
 master was a lifelong vegetarian and was besides feeling miserable he
 sobbed and let none of the food touch his lips.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story tells how Monkey rode his cloud back to the Clouds of
 Compassion Monastery and called, &#8220;Brothers.&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing this Pig and Friar Sand, who were waiting for him and
 discussing what to do, came out together to greet him with the words,
 &#8220;Brother, why are you only back now after being away all day? What's
 happened to the master?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I followed the smell of the wind right through the night till we got
 to a mountain and it disappeared,&#8221; Monkey replied with a smile.
 &#8220;Luckily the four Duty Gods told me that the mountain's called Green
 Dragon Mountain and that there's a Dark Essence Cave on it where three
 evil spirits live: King Cold-avoider, King Heat-avoider and King
 Dust-avoider. They've been stealing the oil here for years on end by
 disguising themselves as Buddhas to trick the officials of Jinping
 Prefecture. When they came across us this year they wickedly carried
 our master off with them. I told the Duty Gods and the rest of them to
 give the master some secret protection while I shouted insults at them
 from outside their doors. When the three demons came out they all
 looked like bullheaded demons. The first of them fought with a
 battle-axe, the second with a cutlass and the third with a flail. They
 had a whole gang of cattle-headed monsters with them, waving banners
 and beating drums. The fight went on all day and was still in the
 balance when one of the demon kings waved a flag to bring all the
 junior devils forward. As it was late and I was worried that I couldn't
 beat them I came back by somersault cloud.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I reckon it must be the Demon King of Fengdu who's making trouble
 for you,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;What makes you guess that?&#8221; Friar Sand asked. &#8220;I can tell because
 our big brother said they were all cattle-headed monsters,&#8221; replied Pig
 with a laugh.</P>
<P>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I saw them and they were all rhinoceros
 spirits.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If they're rhinos we've just got to catch them and saw their horns
 off,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;They'll be worth quite a bit of silver.&#8221;</P>
<P>As they were talking the monks all asked Monkey if he had eaten any
 supper. &#8220;I'll have something if it's no trouble,&#8221; Brother Monkey
 replied, &#8220;but I can do without just as well.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Surely you're hungry after fighting all day, my lord,&#8221; the monks
 said.</P>
<P>&#8220;You can't get hungry in a mere day,&#8221; Monkey laughed. &#8220;I once went
 without food for five hundred years.&#8221; The monks did not know whether he
 was telling the truth or joking, and a little later food was brought in
 that Monkey ate, after which he said, &#8220;Tidy up and go to sleep. We'll
 go and fight them again tomorrow and capture the demon kings so as to
 rescue the master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What nonsense, brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand, who was standing to one
 side. &#8220;As the saying goes, 'Delay brings wisdom.' It'll be terrible if
 that monster stays awake tonight and murders the master. We'd better go
 there right now and make such a row that he can't do anything. It may
 go badly wrong if we lose a single moment.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Pig heard this he braced himself and said, &#8220;Friar Sand's right.
 Let's go and put down those demons. The moon's bright enough.&#8221;
 Accepting their advice, Monkey left his instructions with the monks of
 the monastery.</P>
<P>&#8220;Look after the luggage and the horse. When we've captured the evil
 spirits we'll bring them back here to prove to the prefect that they're
 imposters. Then he can end the oil levy and relieve the common people
 of this hardship. That'll be a good thing, won't it?&#8221; The monks all
 accepted their orders while the three of them left the city by
 auspicious cloud. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Idleness and unrestraint</P>
<P>Threw the dhyana into confusion;</P>
<P>Danger and catastrophe</P>
<P>Led the Way-heart into delusion.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know who was to win this encounter listen to the
 explanation in the next installment.</P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="1_0_93">Chapter 92</A></H3>
</I>
<P>Three Monks Wage a Great Fight on Green Dragon Mountain</P>
<P>Four Stars Seize the Rhinoceros Monsters</P>
</B>
<P>The story tells how after the Great Sage Monkey took his two brother
 disciples by gale and cloud to the Northeast they were soon bringing
 their cloud down at the entrance to the Dark Essence Cave on Green
 Dragon Mountain. Pig was just about to smash the doors in when Monkey
 said, &#8220;Wait a moment. I'll go in and find out whether the master's
 still alive before we have it out with him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But the doors are shut very tightly,&#8221; said Friar Sand. How will you
 get in?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've got my methods,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage then put his cudgel away, made a spell with
 his fingers while saying the magic words, called &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned
 into a fire-fly. He was really nimble. Just look at him:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Wings that shine like shooting stars:</P>
<P>The ancients say fire-flies grow from rotting plants.</P>
<P>His powers of transformation are truly great,</P>
<P>And he loves to wander all around.</P>
<P>When he flies to the stone doors to look within</P>
<P>A draft blows through the crack beside him.</P>
<P>A single jump and he is in the dark courtyard,</P>
<P>Watching the movements of the evil spirits.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As he flew in he saw some cattle sprawled around on the ground, fast
 asleep and snoring like thunder. In the main hall nothing was moving,
 and all the doors were closed. Not knowing where the three evil spirits
 were sleeping, he went through the hall and shone with his light into
 the back, where he heard sobs. The Tang Priest was chained to a pillar
 under the eaves at the back and weeping. Monkey kept out of sight as he
 listened to what he was crying about, and this is what he heard:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Since I left Chang'an in China some ten years back and more,</P>
<P>I have had to suffer much crossing all those rivers and mountains.</P>
<P>I came out to the West at a very happy season,</P>
<P>Arriving in the city for the festival of lanterns.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;I failed to understand that the Buddhas were impostors</P>
<P>All because my fate seems to doom me to distress.</P>
<P>My disciples gave pursuit and will use their mighty powers:</P>
<P>I pray they will be able to achieve a great success.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Delighted to hear this, Monkey spread his wings and flew closer to
 his master, who wiped away his tears and observed, &#8220;Goodness, the West
 really is different. This is only the first month of the year, when
 dormant insects are just beginning to wake up. Fancy seeing a fire-fly
 now!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Brother Monkey, unable to keep quiet any longer, &#8220;I'm
 here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I was just wondering how there could be a fire-fly at this time of
 year, and it's you,&#8221; the Tang Priest replied with delight.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Monkey, turning back into himself, &#8220;the journey's been
 held up so long and so much effort has been wasted because you can't
 tell true from false. All the way along I've told you demons are no
 good, but you will kowtow to them. When those devils covered up the
 lamps to steal the refined butter oil they carried you off too. I told
 Pig and Friar Sand to go back to the monastery and keep an eye on our
 things while I followed the smell of the wind here. I didn't know what
 the place was called, but luckily the four Duty Gods told me that this
 is Dark Essence Cave on Green Dragon Mountain. I fought the monsters
 all day long till I went back at evening, told my brother-disciples the
 full story, and came back here with them instead of going to bad. As I
 thought it was too late at night to fight and didn't know where you
 were I transformed myself to come in and find out what's going on.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Are Pig and Friar Sand outside?&#8221; the happy Tang Priest asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;I've just had a look around and seen that the
 evil spirits are all asleep. I'll unlock you, smash the doors down and
 get you out.&#8221; The Tang Priest nodded his head in gratitude.</P>
<P>Using his unlocking magic, Monkey made the lock open at a touch. He
 was just leading his master to the front of the cave when the demon
 kings could be heard shouting from their bedrooms, &#8220;Shut the doors
 tight, little ones, and be careful of fire. Why can't we hear the
 watchmen calling the watches? Where are the clappers and bells?&#8221;</P>
<P>After a day's hard fighting the junior demons were all asleep,
 exhausted; and they only woke up when they heard the shout. To the
 sound of clappers and bells several of them came out from the back
 holding weapons and beating gongs, and they just happened to bump into
 Monkey and his master.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where do you think you're going, my fine monks, now you've broken
 the locks?&#8221; the junior devils all shouted together, and with no further
 argument Monkey pulled out his cudgel, shook it to make it as thick as
 a rice bowl and struck, killing two of them at a blow. The rest of them
 dropped their weapons, went to the central hall, beat on the doors and
 shouted, &#8220;Disaster, Your Majesties, disaster. The hairy-faced monk's
 got inside and he's killing people.&#8221;</P>
<P>The moment the three demons heard this they tumbled out of their beds
 and ordered, &#8220;Catch them! Catch them!&#8221; This gave the Tang Priest such a
 fright that his hands and legs turned weak. Monkey abandoned him and
 stormed his way forward, swinging his cudgel.</P>
<P>The junior devils could not stop him as, pushing two or three aside
 here and knocking two or three over there, he smashed several pairs of
 doors open and rushed straight out, shouting, &#8220;Where are you,
 brothers?&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig and Friar Sand greeted him, rake and staff raised for action,
 with the question, &#8220;What's up, brother?&#8221; Monkey told them all about how
 he had transformed himself to rescue the master, been found by the
 spirits when they woke up, and been forced to abandon him and fight his
 way out.</P>
<P>Now that they had recaptured the Tang Priest, the demon kings had him
 locked up in chains again and questioned him in the glare of lamplight,
 as they brandished cutlass and axe. &#8220;How did you open the lock, damn
 you,&#8221; they asked, &#8220;and how did that ape get inside? Confess this moment
 and we'll spare your life, or else we'll cut you in half.&#8221;</P>
<P>This so terrified the Tang Priest that he fell to his knees shivering
 and shaking and said, &#8220;Your Majesties, my disciple Sun Wukong can do
 seventy-two kinds of transformations. Just now he turned into a
 fire-fly and flew in to rescue me. We never realized that Your
 Majesties would wake up or that we would bump into Their Junior
 Majesties. My wicked disciple wounded a couple of them, and when they
 all started shouting and going for us with weapons and torches he
 abandoned me and escaped.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If we'd woken up earlier he'd never have got away,&#8221; the three demon
 kings said with loud guffaws. They then told their underlings to fasten
 the doors firmly at front and back and stop shouting.</P>
<P>&#8220;As they've shut the doors and stopped shouting I think they must be
 going to murder the master,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;We must act.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;Let's smash the doors,&#8221; The idiot showed
 off his magical powers by smashing the stone doors to smithereens with
 a blow from his rake then shouted at the top of his voice, &#8220;Thieving,
 oil-stealing monsters! Send my master out right now!&#8221;</P>
<P>This gave the junior devils inside the doors such a fright that they
 tumbled and ran inside to report, &#8220;Disaster, Your Majesties, disaster.
 The monks have smashed the front doors.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They're outrageous, damn them,&#8221; the three demon kings said in a
 great fury, and when they had sent for their armor and fastened it on
 they took their weapons and led their underlings into battle. It was
 now about the third watch of the night, and the moon in the middle of
 the sky made all as bright as day. As they led their forces out they
 wasted no more words and started fighting. Monkey held off the
 battle-axe, Pig blocked the cutlass, and Friar Sand took on the flail.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Three monks with cudgel, staff and rake;</P>
<P>Three evil monsters both brave and angry.</P>
<P>The battle-axe, the cutlass and the flail</P>
<P>Made howling winds and set the sand flying.</P>
<P>In their first clashes they breathed out baleful mists,</P>
<P>Then as they flew around they scattered coloured clouds.</P>
<P>The nailed rake went through its routines round the body,</P>
<P>The iron cudgel was even more splendidly heroic,</P>
<P>And the demon-quelling staff was something rarely seen on earth;</P>
<P>But the unrepentant ogres would not yield a foot of ground.</P>
<P>The bright-bladed axe had a sharp-pointed butt,</P>
<P>The whirling flail made a pattern of flowers,</P>
<P>And the flashing cutlass swung like a painted door;</P>
<P>But the monks were their match.</P>
<P>One side was fighting with fury for their master's life;</P>
<P>The other hit at their faces so as not to release the Tang Priest.</P>
<P>The axe hacked and the cudgel blocked in the struggle for mastery;</P>
<P>The rake swung and the cutlass struck as they fought;</P>
<P>The knotted flail and the demon-quelling staff,</P>
<P>Coming and going in a splendid display.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the three monks and the three monsters had been fighting for a
 long time without either side coming out on top King Cold-avoider
 shouted, &#8220;Come on, little ones!&#8221; The monsters all charged at Pig,
 quickly tripping him up and bringing him to the ground. Several
 water-buffalo spirits dragged and pulled him inside the cave, where
 they tied him up. When Friar Sand saw that Pig had disappeared and
 heard the mooing of all the cattle he then raised his staff, feinted at
 King Dust-avoider and tried to flee, only to be rushed by another crowd
 of spirits who pulled at him, sending him staggering. However hard he
 struggled he could not get up, and he too was carried off to be tied
 up. Realizing that he was in an impossible situation, Monkey escaped by
 somersault cloud.</P>
<P>When Pig and Friar Sand were dragged to him the Tang Priest said with
 tears welling up in his eyes at the sight of them, &#8220;Poor things! You
 two have been caught too. Where's Wukong?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When he saw we'd been caught he ran away,&#8221; Friar Sand replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wherever he has gone he will certainly have gone to fetch help,&#8221;
 said the Tang Priest. &#8220;But who knows when we will be delivered?&#8221; Master
 and disciples felt thoroughly miserable.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story tells how Brother Monkey rode his somersault cloud back to
 the Clouds of Compassion Monastery, where the monks met him with the
 question, &#8220;Have you been able to rescue Lord Tang?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's difficult,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;very difficult. Those three evil
 spirits have tremendous magical powers, and when we three had fought
 them for a long time they called up their underlings to capture Pig and
 Friar Sand. I was lucky to get away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; said the monks with horror, &#8220;if someone who can ride mists
 and clouds as you can couldn't catch them, your master is bound to be
 killed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No problem,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;no problem. My master's under the
 secret protection of the Protectors, the Guardians, the Dings and the
 Jias. He has besides eaten Grass-returning Cinnabar. I'm sure his life
 will be safe. The only trouble is that those demons really know their
 stuff. You people look after the horse and the luggage while I go up to
 Heaven to get some troops.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Can you go up to Heaven, my lord?&#8221; asked the terrified monks.</P>
<P>&#8220;I used to live there,&#8221; replied Monkey with a smile. &#8220;Because I
 wrecked the Peach Banquet when I was Great Sage Equaling Heaven, our
 Buddha subdued me, so that now I've no option but to redeem my crimes
 by guarding the Tang Priest while he fetches the scriptures. All along
 the journey I've been helping the good and fighting against the evil.
 What you don't realize is that the master is fated to have these
 troubles.&#8221; When the monks heard this they kowtowed in worship, while
 Monkey went outside and disappeared with a whistle.</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage was soon outside the Western Gate of Heaven,
 where the Metal Planet, Heavenly King Virudhaka and the four spirit
 officers Yin, Zhu, Tao and Xu were talking to each other. As soon as
 they saw Monkey coming they hastily bowed to him and said, &#8220;Where are
 you going, Great Sage?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;After we reached Mintian County in Jinping Prefecture on the Eastern
 borders of India,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;my master, the Tang Priest who I'm
 escorting, was being entertained by the monks of the Clouds of
 Compassion Monastery for the Full Moon Festival. When we went to the
 Bridge of Golden Lamps there were three golden lamps full of over fifty
 thousand ounces of silver's worth of scented refined butter oil that
 the Buddhas came down to take every year. While we were admiring the
 lamps three Buddha images did come down to earth, and my master was
 gullible enough to go on the bridge to worship them. I told him they
 were a bad lot, but by then the lamps had been covered up and the
 master carried off with the oil by a wind. When I'd followed the wind
 till dawn I reached a mountain, where the four Duty Gods fortunately
 told me that it was called Green Dragon Mountain with a Dark Essence
 Cave in it where three monsters lived: King Cold-avoider, King
 Heat-avoider and King Dust-avoider. I hurried to their doors to demand
 the master and fought them for a while without success, so I got in by
 transforming myself to find the master locked up but unharmed. I
 released him and was just taking him out when they woke up and I had to
 flee again. Later I fought hard against them with Pig and Friar Sand,
 but the two of them were both captured and tied up. That's why I've
 come up to inform the Jade Emperor, find out about the monsters'
 background and ask him to give orders to have them suppressed.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this the Metal Planet burst out laughing and said, &#8220;If you've been
 fighting the monsters why can't you tell where they're from?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I can see that,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;They're a bunch of rhino spirits.
 But they have such enormous magical powers that I can't beat them and
 I'm desperate.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They are three rhinoceros spirits,&#8221; the Metal Planet explained.
 &#8220;Because their form is seen in heaven they cultivated their awareness
 for many years and became true spirits able to fly on clouds and walk
 in mists. Those monsters are fanatical about cleanliness and don't like
 the look of their own bodies, and are always going into the water to
 bathe. They have lots of different names: there are she-rhinos,
 he-rhinos, gelded rhinos, spotted rhinos,<I> humao</I> rhinos,<I>
 duoluo</I> rhinos and heaven-connected brindled rhinos. They all have a
 single nostril, three types of hair and two horns. They roam the rivers
 and seas and can travel through water. It looks as though Cold-avoider,
 Heat-avoider and Dust-avoider have nobility in their horns, which is
 why they call themselves kings. If you want to catch them, they will
 submit to the four beast stars belonging to the element wood.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Which four wood stars?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;Could I trouble you,
 venerable sir, to spell it out for me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Those stars are spread out in space outside the Dipper and Bull
 Palace,&#8221; the planet replied with a smile. &#8220;If you submit a memorial to
 the Jade Emperor he will give you detailed instructions.&#8221; Raising his
 clasped hands as he expressed his thanks, Monkey went straight in
 through the heavenly gates.</P>
<P>He was soon outside the Hall of Universal Brightness, where he saw
 the heavenly teachers Ge, Qiu, Zhang and Xu, who asked, &#8220;Where are you
 going?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We've just reached Jinping Prefecture,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;where my
 master relaxed his dhyana nature by going to enjoy the Moon Festival
 lanterns and was carried off by evil monsters. As I can't subdue them
 myself I've come to ask the Jade Emperor to save him.&#8221; The four
 heavenly teachers then took Monkey to the Hall of Miraculous Mist to
 submit his memorial, and when all the ceremonials had been performed he
 explained his business. The Jade Emperor then asked which units of
 heavenly soldiers he wanted to help him.</P>
<P>&#8220;When I arrived at the Western Gate of Heaven just now,&#8221; Monkey
 replied, &#8220;the Metal Planet told me they were rhinoceros spirits that
 could only be subdued by the four beast stars belonging to the element
 wood.&#8221; The Jade Emperor then told Heavenly Teacher Xu to go to the
 Dipper and Bull Palace with Monkey to fetch the four beast stars and
 take them down to the lower world to make the capture.</P>
<P>By the time they arrived outside the Dipper and Bull Palace the
 Twenty-eight Constellations were there to greet them. &#8220;We are here by
 imperial command to order four beast stars belonging to the element
 wood to go down to the lower world with the Great Sage Sun,&#8221; the
 heavenly teacher explained. The Wooden Lesser Dragon of the
 Constellation Horn, the Wooden Unicorn of the Dipper, the Wooden Wolf
 of the Strider, and the Wooden Hyena of the Well all stepped forward
 from the side to ask, &#8220;Where are you sending us to subdue demons, Great
 Sage?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So you're the ones,&#8221; said Brother Monkey with a smile. &#8220;That old man
 Metal Planet kept your names secret, and I didn't realize what he was
 driving at. If he'd told me before that it was you four wooden animals
 from the Twenty-eight Constellations I'd have come here to invite you
 myself: there'd have been no need to trouble His Majesty for an edict.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a thing to say, Great Sage,&#8221; the four wooden animals replied.
 &#8220;We'd never have dared to leave on our own authority in the absence of
 an imperial decree. Where are they? Let's go right away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They are rhinoceros spirits in the Dark Essence Cave in Green Dragon
 Mountain to the Northeast of Jinping Prefecture.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If they're really rhinoceros spirits,&#8221; said the Wooden Unicorn of
 the Dipper, the Wooden Wolf of the Strider and the Wooden Lesser Dragon
 of the Horn, &#8220;you'll only need Wooden Hyena from the Well
 Constellation. He can eat tigers on mountains and capture rhinos in the
 sea.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But these aren't ordinary rhinos who gaze at the moon,&#8221; replied
 Monkey. &#8220;They have cultivated their conduct and found the Way and are a
 thousand years old. All four of you gentlemen must come: no excuses. If
 one of you can't capture them single-handed it'll be wasted effort.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You people are talking nonsense,&#8221; the heavenly teacher added. &#8220;The
 imperial command is that all four of you go, so go you must. Fly there
 at once while I report back.&#8221; The heavenly teacher then took his leave
 of Monkey and went.</P>
<P>&#8220;Delay no more, Great Sage,&#8221; the four wooden ones said. &#8220;You
 challenge them to battle and lure them out so we can come from behind
 you and get them.&#8221; Monkey then went up to the cave and shouted
 abusively, &#8220;Oil-thieving ogres! Give my master back!&#8221; The doors, which
 Pig had smashed open, had been barricaded with a few planks by a number
 of junior devils, and when they heard his insults they rushed inside to
 report, &#8220;Your Majesties, the monk Sun is outside insulting us again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We beat him and he ran away,&#8221; said Dust-avoider, &#8220;so why's he back
 again today? I think he must have got some reinforcements from
 somewhere.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We're not scared of any reinforcements he could get,&#8221; said
 Cold-avoider and Heat-avoider scornfully. &#8220;Let's get into our armor at
 once. Little ones, surround him carefully and don't let him get away.&#8221;
 Not caring about their lives, the evil spirits came out of the cave
 holding spears and swords, with banners waving and drums beating. &#8220;Back
 again, are you, macaque?&#8221; they shouted at Brother Monkey. &#8220;Not afraid
 of another beating?&#8221;</P>
<P>Nothing infuriated Monkey so much as the word &#8220;macaque,&#8221; and he was
 grinding his teeth in rage as he lifted his cudgel to hit them. The
 three demon kings brought their junior devils up to surround him, at
 which the four wooden beasts who were waiting to one side swung their
 weapons with shouts of, &#8220;Don't move, animals!&#8221;</P>
<P>The three demon kings were of course most alarmed at the sight of the
 four stars, and they all said, &#8220;This is terrible, terrible. He's found
 the people who can beat us. Run for your lives, little ones!&#8221; With that
 there was much roaring, lowing, panting and sighing as the junior
 devils all resumed their original appearances as yak, water-buffalo and
 ox spirits running all over the mountain. The three demon kings also
 turned back into their true selves, put their hands down to become
 four-hoofed creatures like iron cannons, and galloped off to the
 Northeast, to be followed hard by the Great Sage leading the Wooden
 Hyena of the Well and the Wooden Lesser Dragon of the Horn. While they
 were not going to relax for a moment, the Wooden Unicorn of the Dipper
 and the Wooden Wolf of the Strider were mopping up all the cattle
 spirits among the hollows, summits, ravines and valleys of the Eastern
 mountain. Some were killed and others taken alive. They then went into
 the Dark Essence Cave to free the Tang Priest, Pig and Friar Sand.</P>
<P>Recognizing the two stars, Friar Sand bowed to them in thanks and
 asked, &#8220;What brought you two gentlemen here to rescue us?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We came to rescue you because the Great Sage Monkey submitted a
 request to the Jade Emperor that we be sent,&#8221; the two stars replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why has my disciple Wukong not come in?&#8221; the Tang Priest asked with
 tears in his eyes.</P>
<P>&#8220;The three old demons are rhinoceroses,&#8221; the stars explained, &#8220;and
 when they saw us they fled for their lives to the Northeast. The Great
 Sage Sun has gone after them with the Wooden Hyena of the Well and the
 Wooden Lesser Dragon of the Horn. We two wiped out the oxen then came
 here to rescue you, holy monk.&#8221; The Tang Priest once again kowtowed in
 thanks then kowtowed to heaven.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;overdone courtesy is hypocrisy. Stop kowtowing
 all the time. The four star officers came at the Jade Emperor's command
 and as a favour to big brother. The ordinary demons have all been wiped
 out, but we still don't know how the senior demons are to be put down.
 Let's clear all the valuables out of the cave, wreck the place so as to
 dig out their roots, then go back to the monastery to wait for Monkey.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Marshal Tian Peng, your suggestion is right,&#8221; said the Wooden Wolf
 of the Strider. &#8220;You and the Curtain-lifting General escort your master
 back to the monastery to sleep while we head Northeast to fight the
 enemy.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;With you two to help you're bound to wipe them
 all out. Then you'll be able to report back on your mission.&#8221; The two
 star officers immediately joined the chase. After Pig and Friar Sand
 had found a bushel of valuables in the cave&#8212;there was much coral,
 agate, pearls, amber, precious shells, jade and gold&#8212;they carried them
 outside and invited the master to sit on the top of a crag while they
 started a fire that burned the whole cave to ashes. Only then did they
 take the master back to the Clouds of Compassion Monastery in Jinping
 Prefecture. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The classic says, &#8220;Disaster comes at the height of success.&#8221;</P>
<P>Indeed one can meet with evil in happiness.</P>
<P>For love of the lanterns the dhyana nature was disturbed;</P>
<P>The heart set on the Way was weakened by a beautiful sight.</P>
<P>The great elixir has always had to be permanently guarded;</P>
<P>Once it is lost one always comes to grief.</P>
<P>Shut it up tight; bind it fast; never idle.</P>
<P>A moment's lack of care can lead one astray.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We will tell not of how the three of them went back to the monastery,
 their lives saved, but of how the Wooden Unicorn of the Dipper and the
 Wooden Wolf of the Strider were riding their clouds Northeast in
 pursuit of the demons when they lost sight of them in mid air. On
 reaching the Western Ocean they saw the Great Sage Monkey down by the
 sea a long way away, shouting.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where have the monsters gone, Great Sage?&#8221; they asked, bringing
 their clouds down. &#8220;Why didn't you two come after them and help put
 them down?&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;How can you have the nerve to ask that
 question?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When we saw that you and the stars from the Well and the Horn had
 routed the demons and were going after them, Great Sage,&#8221; the Wooden
 Unicorn of the Dipper replied, &#8220;we were sure you'd capture them, so we
 two wiped out the rest of the devils, rescued your master and
 fellow-disciples from the cave, searched the mountain, burned the cave
 out, and entrusted your master to your two fellow-disciples to take
 back to the Clouds of Compassion Monastery in the city. We only came
 after you this way when you had been gone for such a long time.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case you did very well,&#8221; said Brother Monkey, his wrath now
 turned to pleasure. &#8220;Thank you for going to so much trouble. The only
 thing is that when we'd chased the three ogres this far they plunged
 into the sea. The two stars from the Well and the Horn followed close
 behind them while I stayed on the shore to cut off their escape. Now
 you're here you can block them on the shore while I go there.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage then swung his cudgel and made a spell with
 his fingers as he cleared a way through the waters, plunging deep into
 the waves, where the three monsters were locked in a life-and-death
 struggle with the Wooden Hyena of the Well and the Wooden Lesser Dragon
 of the Horn.</P>
<P>&#8220;Monkey's here,&#8221; he shouted, springing forward. The evil spirits
 could barely hold off the two star officers, so when they heard
 Monkey's great yell at this moment of crisis they turned and fled for
 their lives into the middle of the sea. Their horns were very good at
 parting the waters, and they cleared their way through the sea with a
 whooshing noise, the two star officers and the Great Sage Monkey
 chasing after them.</P>
<P>A yaksha who was patrolling the Western Ocean with a shelled warrior
 saw from a distance the way the rhinoceroses were parting the waters,
 recognized Monkey and the two stars, and rushed back to the crystal
 palace to report to the dragon king in alarm, &#8220;Your Majesty, the Great
 Sage Equaling Heaven and two stars from the sky are chasing three
 rhinoceroses this way.&#8221; When the old dragon king Ao Shun heard this he
 said to his heir, Prince Mo'ang, &#8220;Muster our water forces at once. I'm
 sure it must be the three rhinoceros spirits Cold-avoider, Heat-avoider
 and Dust-avoider who've provoked Sun the Novice. As they're in the sea
 now we'd better lend a hand.&#8221; Having been given his orders Ao Mo'ang
 hastened to muster his troops.</P>
<P>A moment later a fully-armed force of tortoises, soft-shelled
 turtles, alligators, bream, mackerel, mandarin fish, carp, and prawn
 and crab soldiers charged out of the crystal palace shouting their
 battle-cries together to stop the rhinoceros spirits. Unable to go any
 further forward, the rhinoceroses made a hasty retreat, only to find
 their escape blocked by the stars from the Well and the Horn as well as
 the Great Sage. In their panic they failed to stay in a group, but
 scattered as they fled for their lives. Dust-avoider was soon
 surrounded by the old dragon king's men.</P>
<P>A delighted Monkey called out, &#8220;Stop! Stop! Take him alive! Don't
 kill him!&#8221; When Mo'ang heard this order he rushed forward, knocked
 Dust-avoider to the ground, put an iron hook through his snout and tied
 all his hoofs together.</P>
<P>The old dragon king then divided his forces into two to help the star
 officers capture the other two monsters. As the young dragon prince led
 his men forward the Wooden Hyena of the Well reverted to his real form
 to hold Cold-avoider down and start eating him in big and little bites.</P>
<P>&#8220;Well Star!&#8221; Mo'ang shouted. &#8220;Don't kill him! The Great Sage Monkey
 wants him alive, not dead.&#8221; Mo'ang shouted several times, but by then
 the Hyena had already gnawed right through the monster's throat.</P>
<P>Mo'ang ordered his prawn and crab soldiers to carry the dead
 rhinoceros back to the palace of crystal, then joined the Wooden Hyena
 of the Well in the pursuit. Heat-avoider, who was being driven back
 towards them by the Wooden Lesser Dragon of the Horn, ran straight into
 the star from the Well, at which Mo'ang ordered his tortoises,
 soft-shelled turtles and alligators to spread out in the winnowing-fan
 formation to encircle the monster.</P>
<P>&#8220;Spare me, spare me!&#8221; the monster pleaded. The wooden Hyena of the
 Well sprang forward, grabbed the monster by the ear, seized his sword,
 and shouted, &#8220;I won't kill you. I won't kill you. I'll take you to the
 Great Sage Monkey for him to deal with you.&#8221;</P>
<P>The troops then went back to the crystal palace, where they reported,
 &#8220;We've got them both.&#8221; Monkey saw that one was lying headless and gory
 on the ground, while the other was being forced to kneel by the Wooden
 Hyena of the Well twisting his ear.</P>
<P>&#8220;That head wasn't cut off with a weapon,&#8221; Monkey said on going up for
 a closer look.</P>
<P>&#8220;If I hadn't shouted so hard the star officer of the Well would have
 eaten the whole of him up,&#8221; replied Mo'ang with a smile. &#8220;Very well
 then,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case you'd better get a saw to cut off his horns and have
 his hide removed for us to take. We'll leave the flesh for your worthy
 father the dragon king and yourself to enjoy.&#8221; A chain was then run
 through Dust-avoider's nose for the Wooden Lesser Dragon of the Horn to
 lead him by, and the same was done to Heat-avoider for the Wooden Hyena
 of the Well.</P>
<P>&#8220;Take them to the prefect of Jinping,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Investigate
 them, question them about all the years they masqueraded as Buddhas to
 harm the people, then off with their heads.&#8221;</P>
<P>They all then did as Monkey told them, taking their leave of the
 dragon king and his son and emerging from the Western Ocean, leading
 the rhinoceroses with them. When they met the other two stars from the
 Strider and the Dipper they went by cloud straight back to Jinping
 Prefecture.</P>
<P>Here Monkey called out as he stood in mid air on a beam of auspicious
 light, &#8220;Mr. Prefect, subordinate officials, soldiers and civilians of
 Jinping, listen to what I say. We are holy monks sent by the Great Tang
 in the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven. In this
 prefecture and its counties you have had to make offerings in golden
 lamps every year to these rhinoceros monsters pretending to be Buddhas
 coming down to earth. When we came here and were admiring the lamps at
 the Moon Festival these monsters carried the oil and our master off
 together. I asked for some gods from heaven to capture them. We've
 cleaned out their cave and wiped out the monsters. They won't be able
 to give you any more trouble. You needn't waste the people's money
 making offerings in golden lamps here any more.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Pig and Friar Sand, who were just escorting the master back into
 the Clouds of Compassion Monastery, heard Monkey talking from up in the
 sky they abandoned their master, dropped the luggage and shot up into
 the air by cloud to ask Monkey about how the demons had been beaten.</P>
<P>&#8220;One of them was chewed to death by the star from the Well,&#8221; Monkey
 replied, &#8220;and we've got his sawn-off horns and his hide with us. The
 other two we've brought back alive.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Throw the pair of them down into the city,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;for the
 officials and everyone else to see. Then they'll know we're gods and
 sages. I'll trouble you four star officers to put your clouds away,
 land, and come into the prefectural court with us to execute the
 monsters. The facts are clear and the penalty's the right one. There's
 nothing else to be said.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Marshal Tian Peng is right, and he knows the laws too,&#8221; the four
 stars said.</P>
<P>&#8220;I have learned a bit during my years as a monk,&#8221; Pig replied.</P>
<P>The gods then pushed the rhinoceroses, which fell wreathed in
 coloured clouds into the prefectural court, to the astonishment of the
 prefectutal officials and everyone else inside and outside the walled
 city, who all set up incense tables outside their houses, and bowed
 their heads to worship the gods from heaven. A little later the monks
 of the Clouds of Compassion Monastery carried the venerable elder into
 the court in a sedan chair.</P>
<P>When Sanzang met Monkey he kept thanking him, adding, &#8220;I am very
 grateful for the trouble I have put the star officers to in rescuing
 us. I had been very anxious when I did not see you, worthy disciple,
 but now you have returned in triumph. I wonder where you had to chase
 the monsters to before you caught them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;After I left you the day before yesterday,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;I went
 up to heaven to make some enquiries. The Metal Planet knew that the
 monsters were rhinoceroses, so he told me to ask for the four beast
 stars that belong to the element wood. So I submitted a memorial to the
 Jade Emperor and he sent them straight to the mouth of the cave, where
 they gave battle. When the demon kings fled, the stars from the Dipper
 and the Strider rescued you, Master, I chased the demons with the Well
 and the Horn stars straight to the Western Ocean, where the dragon king
 sent his son out with their troops to help us. That's how the monsters
 were captured and brought here for questioning.&#8221; The venerable elder
 was full of endless praise and thanks. The prefectural and county
 officials and their subordinates all lit precious candles and whole
 containers of incense sticks as they kowtowed in respect,</P>
<P>A little later Pig lost his temper, pulled out his monastic knife and
 beheaded first Dust-avoider, then Heat-avoider, each with a single
 stroke. Then he removed their four horns with a saw. The Great Sage
 Monkey then had another suggestion to make: &#8220;You four star officers
 must take these four rhinoceros horns to the upper world to offer to
 the Jade Emperor as trophies when you report back on your mission.&#8221; As
 for the two horns he had brought back from the sea, he said, &#8220;We'll
 leave one here to guard the storehouses of the prefectural palace and
 as evidence that from now on no more lamp-oil will ever be levied.
 We'll take the other to offer to the Lord Buddha on Vulture Peak.&#8221; The
 four stars were delighted, and after bowing to take their leave of the
 Great Sage they rose by coloured cloud to report back to the Jade
 Emperor.</P>
<P>The prefectural and county officials kept the master and his
 disciples for a great vegetarian banquet to which all the rural
 officials were also invited. Notices were issued to tell the military
 and civil population that golden lamps were not to be lit the next
 year, and that the duty of serving as an oil-purchasing household was
 abolished for ever. Butchers meanwhile were instructed to remove the
 rhinoceros skins to be steeped in saltpeter and smoked dry for making
 into armor, while the flesh was to be distributed to the officials. At
 the same time money and grain that had been raised by unjust fines on
 innocent people were spent to buy a plot of privately-owned empty land.
 On this a temple to the four stars who had put the demons down, as well
 as a shrine to the Tang Priest and his three disciples, were to be
 built. Stone tablets with inscriptions were to be set up for each of
 them to record their deeds for ever as a mark of gratitude.</P>
<P>Master and disciples relaxed and enjoyed the offerings. They had
 hardly a moment to themselves as they had so many invitations from the
 240 lamp-oil households. Pig was delighted to have so much to eat, and
 he always kept in his sleeve some of the treasures he had collected in
 the cave to give to all his hosts to thank them for their banquets.
 When they had stayed there for a month and were still unable to get
 away the Tang Priest ordered Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong, give all the remaining valuables to the monks in the Clouds
 of Compassion Monastery. Let's leave before dawn, without letting the
 rich families here know. If we are so eager to enjoy ourselves here
 that we delay in fetching the scriptures we may offend the Lord Buddha
 and cause some catastrophe. That would be terrible.&#8221; Monkey then
 disposed of all the objects.</P>
<P>When they got up early the next morning at the fifth watch Pig was
 woken up to get the horse ready. The idiot had eaten and drunk so well
 that he was still half asleep as he said, &#8220;Why get the horse ready so
 early?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The master says we've got to be going,&#8221; Monkey shouted.</P>
<P>&#8220;That reverend gentleman doesn't do things right,&#8221; the idiot said,
 rubbing his eyes. &#8220;We've had invitations from all 240 of the big
 families, but only had thirty or so good vegetarian meals so far. How
 can he be making me go hungry again?&#8221;</P>
<P>When the venerable elder heard this he retorted abusively,
 &#8220;Dreg-guzzling idiot! Stop talking such nonsense! Get up at once! If
 you go on arguing back like that I'll tell Wukong to smash your teeth
 in with his gold-banded cudgel.&#8221;</P>
<P>At the mention of a beating the idiot gesticulated frantically as he
 said, &#8220;The master's changed. Usually he favours me and likes me and
 protects me because I'm so stupid. When you want to hit me, brother, he
 usually persuades you not to. So why's he dead set on telling you to
 hit me today?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The master's angry with you for being so greedy,&#8221; Monkey replied,
 &#8220;and holding us up on our journey. If you don't want me to hit you,
 pack the luggage and get the horse ready.&#8221;</P>
<P>As the idiot really was scared of being hit he jumped out of bed, got
 dressed and shouted to Friar Sand, &#8220;Get up right now! He's going to
 start hitting.&#8221; Friar Sand then jumped up too, and they both got
 everything packed.</P>
<P>&#8220;Keep quiet,&#8221; said the Tang Priest, waving his hands about, &#8220;and
 don't disturb the monks.&#8221; He quickly mounted, after which they opened
 the gate of the monastery and found their way out. Indeed, this
 departure was</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Letting the phoenix escape from the birdcage of jade;</P>
<P>Secretly opening locks so the dragon goes free.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know what the households who still wanted to thank them
 did at daybreak, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

</I>
<P>In the Almsgiver's Garden Antiquity and Causes Are Discussed</P>
<P>In the Court of India the King Meets the Monks</P>
</B>
<P>When thoughts arise there surely will be desire,</P>
<P>Longing is certain to lead one to disaster.</P>
<P>Why should intelligence distinguish the three ranks of nobility?</P>
<P>When conduct is complete it naturally returns to the primal sea.</P>
<P>Whether you become an immortal or a Buddha,</P>
<P>All must be arranged from within.</P>
<P>In absolute purity, with all dust removed,</P>
<P>All will be achieved and one will rise to heaven.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story tells how when Sanzang and his disciples were nowhere to be
 seen at dawn the monks in the Clouds of Compassion Monastery all said,
 &#8220;We couldn't keep them, we couldn't say goodbye to them, and we weren't
 able to ask them for anything. We've let those living Bodhisattvas slip
 clean away.&#8221;</P>
<P>As they were talking, some of the great families from the Southern
 outskirts of the city came in with invitations, at which the monks
 clapped their hands in regret and said, &#8220;We were caught off our guard
 last night: they all rode off by cloud.&#8221; Everyone then kowtowed to
 heaven in gratitude. The news was spread to all the officials in the
 city, who told the great families to prepare the five kinds of
 sacrificial animal, flowers and fruit to offer to the shrines in
 thanksgiving.</P>
<P>The story tells how the Tang Priest and his three disciples fed on
 the wind and slept in the open, travelling uneventfully for the best
 part of a month. One day they suddenly saw a high mountain.
 &#8220;Disciples,&#8221; said the Tang Priest in fear, &#8220;the ridge in front of us is
 very steep. You must be very careful.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As our journey has brought us so close to the land of the Buddha
 there will definitely be nothing evil here,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Don't worry,
 Master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; the Tang Priest replied, &#8220;although we are not far from
 the Buddha's land the monks told us in the monastery the other and they
 didn't know how much further after that.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Have you forgotten the<I> Heart Sutra</I> that the Rook's Nest
 Hermit taught you again, Master?&#8221; asked Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;The<I> Prajna-paramita Heart Sutra</I> is constantly with me, like
 my habit and begging bowl,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;There has not been a day
 ever since the Rook's Nest Hermit taught it to me that I have not
 recited it. I have never forgotten it for a moment. I can even recite
 it backwards. How could I possibly forget it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You can only recite it, Master,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;You never asked the
 hermit to explain it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Ape!&#8221; retorted Sanzang. &#8220;How can you say I don't understand it? Do
 you understand it then?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;I do.&#8221;</P>
<P>After that neither Sanzang nor Monkey made another sound. This had
 Pig falling about with laughter, while Friar Sand was hurting himself,
 he was so amused.</P>
<P>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;We all started out in life as monsters. We're
 not Dhyana monks who've heard the sutras being explained or Buddhist
 priests who've been taught the dharma. He's pretending, just putting on
 an act. How can you say you understand? Well then, why aren't you
 saying anything? We're listening. Please explain.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Second brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;leave him be. Big brother's only
 talking big like that to keep the master going. What he knows about is
 how to use a cudgel. What does he know about explaining sutras?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop talking such nonsense, Wuneng and Wujing,&#8221; said Sanzang.
 &#8220;Wukong understands the wordless language. That is true explanation.&#8221;</P>
<P>As master and disciples talked they did indeed cover a long distance,
 leaving the ridge behind them. They saw a big monastery beside the
 road. &#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;There's a monastery ahead. Just look at
 it.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>It's neither too big nor too small,</P>
<P>But has green glazed tiles;</P>
<P>Neither too new nor too old,</P>
<P>And with a red wall.</P>
<P>Leaning canopies of azure pines can just be seen:</P>
<P>Who knows how many thousand years old they are?</P>
<P>Listen to the murmur of the waters in the channel,</P>
<P>Cut from the mountain untold dynasties ago.</P>
<P>Above the gates is written,</P>
<P>'Spread Gold Dhyana Monastery';</P>
<P>The tablet is inscribed,</P>
<P>'Ancient relic.'&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey saw that it was called the Spread Gold Dhyana Monastery, and
 Pig said so too. '&#8220;Spread Gold,'&#8220; Sanzang wondered as he sat on his
 horse, &#8220;'Spread Gold' ...Can we be in the country of Sravasti?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is very remarkable, Master,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;In all the years I've
 been with you you've never known the way before, but you seem to know
 it now.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;I have often read in the scriptures about the
 Buddha being in the Jetavana garden in the city of Sravasti. The
 Venerable Almsgiver Sudatta tried to buy it from the prince as a place
 to ask the Buddha to preach in. The prince refused to sell the garden,
 and said he would only part with it if it were covered with gold. When
 the Venerable Almsgiver heard this he had gold bricks made with which
 he covered the whole garden to buy it. Then he invited the Buddha to
 preach on the dharma. I am sure that the name Spread Gold Monastery
 must refer to that story.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We're in luck,&#8221; said Pig with a smile, &#8220;If that story's true we can
 find ourselves one of those bricks as a present to give people.&#8221;
 Everybody laughed, after which Sanzang dismounted.</P>
<P>As they went in through the monastery gates they saw people carrying
 loads with shoulder-poles or on their backs, pushing carts, or sitting
 in loaded carts. Others were sleeping or talking. The sight of the
 master, who was so handsome, and his three hideous disciples rather
 frightened them, so they drew back to make way.</P>
<P>Worried that his disciples would provoke trouble, Sanzang kept
 saying, &#8220;Behave yourselves! Behave yourselves!&#8221; They were all very
 restrained. As they went round the Vajra Hall a Dhyana monk of most
 unworldly appearance came out to meet them:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A face like a shining full moon,</P>
<P>A body like a bodhi tree.</P>
<P>The wind blew through the sleeve round his staff,</P>
<P>As his sandals trod the stony path.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Sanzang extended a monastic greeting to him the monk returned
 his courtesy and asked, &#8220;Where are you from, teacher?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am Chen Xuanzang,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;sent to the Western Heaven at
 the command of the Great Tang emperor in the East to worship the Buddha
 and fetch the scriptures. As my journey brings me here I am paying you
 this hasty visit to request a night's shelter before continuing on my
 way tomorrow.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This monastery of ours is one that receives people from all
 quarters,&#8221; the monk replied. &#8220;Everyone is welcome to visit, and we
 would be especially happy to provide for so holy a monk from the East
 as your reverend self.&#8221; Sanzang thanked him and called to his three
 disciples to come with him as they crossed the cloister and refectory
 and went to the abbot's lodgings. When they had exchanged courtesies
 they sat down as befits host and guests. Monkey and the other two sat
 down as well, their hands at their sides.</P>
<P>The story tells how, on learning that monks from Great Tang in the
 East who were going to fetch the scriptures had arrived, all in the
 monastery, young and old alike, whether permanent inmates, itinerant
 monks, elders or novices came to see them. After tea had been drunk a
 vegetarian meal was brought in. While Sanzang was still saying the
 grace before the meal Pig in his impatience had already grabbed and
 wolfed down steamed buns, vegetarian dishes and soup noodles. In the
 crowded abbot's lodgings those who knew better were admiring Sanzang's
 majestic bearing, while those who enjoyed fun watched Pig eat.</P>
<P>When Friar Sand cast his eyes around and saw what was happening he
 gave Pig a discreet pinch and muttered, &#8220;Behave yourself!&#8221;</P>
<P>At this Pig started a desperate howl of, &#8220;All this 'behave yourself,
 behave yourself!' I'm starving!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't understand, brother,&#8221; Friar Sand replied with a smile.
 &#8220;When it comes to the belly, all the well-behaved people in the world
 are exactly the same as we two.&#8221; Only then did Pig stop eating. After
 Sanzang had said the grace for the end of the meal the attendants
 cleared the tables and Sanzang expressed his thanks.</P>
<P>When the monks asked about why they had come from the East, Sanzang's
 conversation turned to ancient sites and he asked them about the name
 Spread Gold Monastery.</P>
<P>&#8220;This used to be the Monastery of the Venerable Almsgiver in the
 country of Sravasti,&#8221; the monks answered. &#8220;It was also known as the
 Jetavana and its name was changed to its present one after the
 Venerable Almsgiver covered the ground with gold bricks, in those days
 the Venerable Almsgiver used to live in the country of Sravasti, and
 our monastery was his Jetavana, which is why it was renamed the
 Almsgiver's Spread Gold Monastery. The site of the Jetavana is at the
 back of the monastery. Whenever there has been a torrential rainstorm
 in recent years, small pieces of gold and silver have been washed out,
 and some people are lucky enough to pick them up.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So the story is a true one,&#8221; said Sanzang, going on to ask, &#8220;Why did
 I see so many travelling merchants with horses, mules, carts and
 carrying-poles resting here when I came in through the gates of your
 monastery?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This mountain is called Mount Hundredfoot,&#8221; the monks replied. &#8220;We
 used to live in peace and prosperity here, but with the cyclic
 progression of the natural forces a number of centipede spirits have
 for some inexplicable reason appeared. They attack people on the roads
 and though nobody gets killed people don't dare to travel. At the foot
 of the mountain there's a Cock-crow Pass that people only dare to cross
 after cock-crow. As all these strangers arrived late they are worried
 that it would not be safe and are putting up here tonight. They'll set
 out at cock-crow.&#8221; As master and disciples were talking a vegetarian
 meal was brought in that they ate.</P>
<P>Sanzang and Monkey were strolling in the light of the rising half
 moon when a lay brother came to announce, &#8220;Our ancient master would
 like to meet the gentlemen from China.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang at once turned to see an ancient monk holding a bamboo cane
 who came forward to greet him and ask, &#8220;Are you the teacher come from
 China?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You do me too great an honour,&#8221; Sanzang replied, returning his
 greeting. The old monk was full of admiration for him, asking how old
 he was.</P>
<P>&#8220;I have wasted forty-five years,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;May I ask how old
 you are?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Just one sixty-year cycle older than you, teacher,&#8221; the other
 answered.</P>
<P>&#8220;Then you're a hundred and five this year,&#8221; Brother Monkey said. &#8220;How
 old do you think I am?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Teacher,&#8221; the old monk replied, &#8220;your appearance seems so ancient
 and your spirit so pure that I could not tell in a hurry, especially by
 moonlight with my poor eyes.&#8221; After talking for a while they walked to
 the back cloister for a look round.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where is the site of the Almsgiver's Garden that you mentioned just
 now?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Outside the back gate,&#8221; the other replied. On the order being given
 for the back gate to be opened immediately, all that could be seen was
 the ruined base of a stone wall. Putting his hands together, Sanzang
 sighed and said,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;I think of the benefactor Sudatta</P>
<P>Who gave his treasures to help the needy</P>
<P>The fame of Jetavana long endures;</P>
<P>Where is he now with the enlightened arhat?&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After a leisurely stroll enjoying the moonlight they sat down for a
 while on a terrace, where they heard the sound of sobbing. As Sanzang
 listened with a still heart he could hear that the weeper was grieving
 because her parents did not know of her suffering. This moved him to
 sorrow, and he found himself in tears as he turned to the monks and
 asked, &#8220;Who is it being so sad, and where?&#8221; On hearing this question
 the ancient monk sent all the others away to prepare tea, and when
 nobody else was around he kowtowed to the Tang Priest and Brother
 Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Venerable abbot,&#8221; said Sanzang, helping him to his feet again, &#8220;why
 do you pay me this courtesy?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As I am over a hundred,&#8221; the ancient monk replied, &#8220;I do know a
 little of the ways of the world; and in between periods of meditation
 and stillness I have seen some things. I know a certain amount about
 you, my lord, and your disciples, and you are not like other people.
 The only teachers here who would be able to analyze this most painful
 business are you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Tell me what it's all about,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;A year ago today,&#8221; the ancient monk replied, &#8220;I was concentrating my
 mind on the nature of the moon when I suddenly heard a gust of wind and
 the sound of someone grieving. I got out of bed, went into the Jetavana
 and saw a beautiful girl there. 'Whose daughter are you?' I asked her.
 'Why are you here?' 'I am a princess, the daughter of the king of
 India,' the girl replied. 'The wind blew me here when I was looking at
 the flowers by moonlight.' I locked her up in an empty room that I
 bricked up like a prison cell, just leaving a gap in the door big
 enough to pass a bowl through. That day I told the other monks that she
 was an evil spirit I had captured. But as we monks are compassionate I
 couldn't kill her, and every day she is given two meals of simple food
 and drink to keep her alive. The girl is clever enough to understand
 what I mean, and to prevent herself from being sullied by the other
 monks she has pretended to be deranged and slept in her own piss and
 shit. During the day she talks nonsense or just sits there in silence,
 but in the still of the night she cries because she misses her parents.
 I've been into the city several times to make enquiries about the
 princesses, but not a single one is missing. So I have put her under
 stronger locks, and I am even more determined not to let her go. Now
 that you have come here, teacher, I beg you to go to the capital and
 use your dharma powers to find out the truth. You will thus be able
 both to rescue the good and display your magical powers.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Sanzang and Monkey heard this they noted it very carefully. As
 they were talking two junior monks came in to invite them to take tea
 and go to bed, so they went back inside.</P>
<P>Back in the abbot's lodgings Pig and Friar Sand were grumbling,
 &#8220;We'll have to be on our way at cock-crow tomorrow, so why aren't you
 in bed yet?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What's that you're saying, idiot?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Go to bed,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;Why are you admiring the blooming scenery
 this late?&#8221; At this the ancient monk left them, and the Tang Priest
 went to bed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sweet dreams of flowers in the moonlit silence;</P>
<P>Warm breezes coming through the window gauze.</P>
<P>As water drips in the clepsydra to fill three sections,</P>
<P>The Milky Way shines on the splendors of the palace.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>They had not slept long that night when they heard the cocks crowing.
 The traders in front of the monastery all got up noisily and prepared
 their breakfast by lamplight. The venerable elder woke up Pig and Friar
 Sand to bridle the horse and pack up, while Monkey called for lamps to
 be lit. The monks of the monastery, who were up already, set out tea,
 soup and snacks, and waited on them. Pig ate a plate of steamed buns
 with delight then took the luggage and the horse outside while Sanzang
 and Brother Monkey took their leave of all the monks.</P>
<P>&#8220;Please don't forget about that very tragic business,&#8221; said the
 ancient monk.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll give it all my attention,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;all my attention.
 Once I'm in the city I'll be able to find out the truth from what I
 hear and see.&#8221; They traders noisily set off together. By the last watch
 of the night they were through Cockcrow Pass, and by ten in the morning
 the walls of the city were in sight. It was indeed a powerful city as
 strong as an iron cauldron, the heavenly capital of a divine region.
 The city</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Was a crouching tiger or a coiled dragon on high ground,</P>
<P>Colorful with its phoenix towers and unicorn halls.</P>
<P>The waters of the royal moat encircled it like a belt;</P>
<P>In his mountainside paradise were many a monument.</P>
<P>The morning sun lit up banners by the high-way;</P>
<P>The spring wind carried the sound of pipes and drums across the
 bridges.</P>
<P>The wise king was dressed in robes and crown,</P>
<P>The crops were abundant and the splendor manifest.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>That day they reached the streets of the Eastern market, where the
 traders all put up at inns. As Sanzang and his disciples were walking
 in the city they came to a government hostel and went inside. The
 hostel manager went to report to the hostel superintendent that there
 were four strange-looking monks outside who had arrived with a white
 horse. On being told about the horse the superintendent realized that
 they must be on an official mission, so he went out to welcome them.</P>
<P>&#8220;I have been sent by the Tang court in the East to the Great Thunder
 Monastery on Vulture Peak to see the Buddha and seek the scriptures,&#8221;
 Sanzang replied with a bow. &#8220;I have a passport to present at court for
 inspection. I would be grateful if I could spend the night in Your
 Excellency's distinguished hostel. I will be on my way when my business
 has been done.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This hostel has been established to entertain envoys and travelers,&#8221;
 the superintendent replied, returning his bow, &#8220;so it is only right
 that we should entertain you. Please come in, please come in.&#8221;</P>
<P>A delighted Sanzang invited his disciples to come in to meet the
 superintendent, who was quietly appalled by their hideous faces. He did
 not know whether they were men or demons, so he trembled as he saw to
 tea and a vegetarian meal for them. Noticing his fright, Sanzang said,
 &#8220;Don't be afraid, Your Excellency. My three disciples look hideous, but
 they are good at heart. As the saying goes, the faces are ugly but the
 men are kind. There's nothing to be afraid of about them.&#8221;</P>
<P>The hostel superintendent's worries were eased when he heard this.
 &#8220;Where is your Tang court, Teacher of the Nation?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In the land of China in the continent of Jambu,&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;When did you leave home?&#8221; was the next question.</P>
<P>&#8220;In the thirteenth year of<I> Zhenguan,</I> fourteen years ago,&#8221;
 Sanzang replied. &#8220;I had to cross thousands of rivers and mountains&#8212;it
 was very hard&#8212;to arrive here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You are a holy monk,&#8221; the hostel superintendent said.</P>
<P>&#8220;How old is your exalted dynasty?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is the great land of India,&#8221; the superintendent replied, &#8220;and
 the dynasty has endured for over five hundred years since our High
 Ancestor. Our reigning sovereign, who is a lover of landscapes and
 flowers, is known as the Happy Emperor. His reign-period is called<I>
 Jingyan</I> and is now in its twenty-eighth year.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I would like to have an audience with His Majesty today to have the
 passport inspected and returned,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;When does he hold
 court?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Splendid,&#8221; the superintendent said, &#8220;absolutely splendid. Today is
 the twentieth birthday of Her Royal Highness, the king's daughter. A
 decorated tower has been built at the crossroads, where the princess is
 going to throw down an embroidered ball to let heaven decide who her
 husband it to be. Today is a very lively one, and I believe that His
 Majesty will not yet have finished his morning audience. This would be
 a good time to go if you wish to have your passport inspected and
 returned.&#8221; Sanzang was just about to set happily off when the meal was
 brought in, so he ate it with the superintendent, Monkey and the other
 two.</P>
<P>By now it was past midday, and Sanzang said, &#8220;I had better be going.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll escort you, Master,&#8221; said Brother Monkey. &#8220;Me too,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;No, don't, brother,&#8221; put in Friar Sand. &#8220;Your face is nothing much
 to look at, so there's no point in your going to look impressive
 outside the palace gates. Best let our big brother go,&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wujing is right,&#8221; Sanzang commented. &#8220;The idiot is coarse and
 stupid. Wukong is more clever and subtle.&#8221; The idiot thrust his snout
 out and said, &#8220;Apart from you, Master, there's not much to choose
 between our three faces.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang then put on his cassock. Monkey took the passport case had
 accompanied him. In the streets everyone&#8212;gentleman, peasant; artisan,
 trader, scholar, pen-pusher, dim-wit, or common man&#8212;was exclaiming,
 &#8220;Let's go and see the embroidered ball being thrown.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang stood beside the road and said to Monkey, &#8220;People, clothes,
 buildings, language and speech here are all the same as in our Great
 Tang. I remember that my late mother married after throwing an
 embroidered ball to make the match she was destined for, and they have
 that custom here too.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What about us going to take a look too?&#8221; asked Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;We are not wearing the right clothes for
 the occasion. We might arouse suspicion.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you've forgotten what the ancient monk in the
 Spread Gold Monastery told us. We could find out whether she is genuine
 or not while we're taking a good look at the decorated tower. With all
 this bustle and activity the king is bound to be going to hear the
 princess's good news. He won't bother with court business. Let's go.&#8221;
 On hearing this Sanzang did indeed go with Monkey. All kinds of people
 were there to watch the throwing of the embroidered ball. Oh dear!
 Little did they know that by going they were like a fisherman casting
 his hook and line and catching himself trouble.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story now explains that two years earlier the king of India had
 taken his queen, consorts and daughter into the royal garden to enjoy a
 moonlit night because he so loved landscapes and flowers. This had
 provoked an evil spirit, who had carried the princess off and turned
 herself into the girl's double. When she learned that the Tang Priest
 was coming at this time, day, month and year the evil spirit had used
 the wealth of the kingdom to build the decorated tower in the hope of
 winning him as her mate and absorbing his true masculine primal essence
 to make herself a superior immortal of the Great Monad.</P>
<P>At the third mark of the noonday hour, when Sanzang and Monkey had
 joined in the crowd and were approaching the tower, the princess lit
 some incense and prayed to heaven and earth. She was surrounded by five
 or six dozen exquisitely made-up beauties who were attending her and
 holding her embroidered ball for her. The tower had many windows on all
 sides. As the princess looked around she saw the Tang Priest
 approaching, so she took the embroidered ball and threw it with her own
 hands at the Tang Priest's head. It knocked his Vairocana mitre askew,
 giving him such a start that he immediately reached with both hands to
 steady the ball, which rolled down his sleeve.</P>
<P>At once there were great shouts from everyone on the tower of, &#8220;She's
 hit a monk! She's hit a monk!&#8221;</P>
<P>Oh dear! All the travelling merchants at the crossroads pushed and
 shouted as they rushed to grab the embroidered ball, to be met by
 Monkey with a shout and bared teeth as he bent forward then grew to the
 majestic height of thirty feet. The hideous face he made gave them all
 such a fright that they collapsed and crawled about, not daring to come
 closer. A moment later they had all scattered and Monkey resumed his
 true form.</P>
<P>The maids, palace beauties and senior and junior eunuchs who had been
 in the tower all camp up to the Tang Priest, kowtowed to him and said,
 &#8220;Your Highness, we beg you to come to the palace to be congratulated.&#8221;
 Sanzang was quick to return their greetings and help them all back to
 their feet.</P>
<P>He then turned back to grumble at Monkey, &#8220;Ape! You've been trying to
 make a fool of me again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It was your head the embroidered ball landed on,&#8221; Monkey replied
 with a laugh, &#8220;and your sleeve it rolled into. Nothing to do with me,
 so what are you moaning at me for?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What are we going to do?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop worrying, Master,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;While you go to the palace to
 see the king I'll go back to the hostel to tell Pig and Friar Sand to
 wait. If the princess doesn't want you, that'll be that. You submit the
 passport and we can be on our way. If the princess insists on marriage
 you must say to the king, 'Please send for my disciples so that I can
 take my leave of them.' When we three are summoned to court I'll be
 able to tell whether the princess is real or an impostor. This is the
 trick called 'subduing a demon through marriage.'&#8220; The Tang Priest had
 nothing to say as Monkey turned away and went back to the hostel.</P>
<P>The venerable elder was hustled by the palace beauties and the rest
 of them to the foot of the tower, from where the princess came down to
 support him with her jade hand as they both entered the royal carriage.
 The retinue formed a procession to return to the palace gates.</P>
<P>The eunuch gate-officer at once reported to the king, &#8220;Your Majesty,
 Her Royal Highness the princess is outside the Meridional Gate, holding
 a monk's arm and waiting to be summoned. I expect she hit him with her
 embroidered ball.&#8221;</P>
<P>The king was most displeased to hear this, and wanted to have the
 monk driven away, but as he did not know what the princess had in mind
 he restrained his feelings and summoned them in. The princess and the
 Tang Priest came in to stand beneath the throne hall. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Man and future wife both hailed the king aloud;</P>
<P>Good and ill together with deep respect kowtowed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When this ceremonial had been performed they were called into the
 throne hall, where the king began by asking, &#8220;Where are you from, monk?
 Did our daughter hit you with her ball?&#8221;</P>
<P>The Tang Priest prostrated himself to reply, &#8220;I have been sent by the
 emperor of Great Tang in the continent of Jambu to the Western Heaven
 to worship the Buddha and seek the scriptures in the Great Thunder
 Monastery. As I carry a passport for this long journey I was coming to
 present it for inspection at Your Majesty's dawn audience when I passed
 a decorated tower at a crossroads, never imagining that Her Royal
 Highness the princess would throw an embroidered ball that would hit me
 on the head. As I am a monk and belong to a different faith I could not
 possibly marry your exquisite daughter, so I beg you to spare me the
 death penalty and return the passport. Then I can be on my way and soon
 reach Vulture Peak, see the Buddha, ask for the scriptures and return
 to my own country, where Your Majesty's divine mercy will be for ever
 recorded.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So you are a holy monk from the East,&#8221; the king replied. &#8220;Indeed, 'a
 thread can draw together a fated match across a thousand miles.' Our
 princess has reached the age of nineteen and is still unmarried, and as
 the hour, day, month and year are all now auspicious a decorated tower
 was set up for her to choose a good husband by throwing the ball from
 it. You just happened to be hit by it, and although this does not
 please us we would like to know the princess's views.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty my father,&#8221; the princess replied, kowtowing, &#8220;as the
 saying goes, 'Marry a cockerel and follow a cockerel; marry a dog and
 follow a dog.' I swore a vow beforehand, made the ball and told heaven,
 earth and the gods that heaven would choose as my husband the man my
 ball hit. As the ball hit the holy monk today this must have been fated
 ever since an earlier incarnation, which is why we met today. I would
 never dare to change my mind. I ask you to take him as your
 son-in-law.&#8221;</P>
<P>Only then was the king happy, and he commanded the chief royal
 astrologer to choose a day. While organizing the trousseau the king
 issued proclamations to the world. When Sanzang heard this, so far from
 thanking the king for his kindness, he pleaded, &#8220;Forgive me, forgive
 me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're most unreasonable, monk,&#8221; the king replied. &#8220;We offer you a
 nation's wealth to be our son-in-law. Why won't you stay here and enjoy
 yourself? All you can think about is fetching the scriptures. If you go
 on refusing we will have the palace guards take you out and behead
 you.&#8221;</P>
<P>The venerable elder was so frightened by this that his soul left his
 body as he kowtowed, trembling, and submitted, &#8220;I am grateful for Your
 Majesty's heavenly grace, but there are four of us monks travelling
 West. I have three disciples outside. If I am now to be taken as your
 son-in-law I beg you to summon them inside as I have not yet taken my
 leave of them. Then you can return the passport and let them go at
 once, so that they will not fail in the purpose of their journey to the
 West.&#8221;</P>
<P>The king approved this request, asking, &#8220;Where are your disciples?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In the government hostel for foreigners,&#8221; Sanzang replied, and
 officers were at once sent to fetch the holy monk's disciples to
 receive the passport and be on their way, leaving the holy monk there
 to be the princess's husband. The venerable elder could only rise to
 his feet and stand in attendance.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>For the Great Elixir not to leak away the Triple Completeness is
 needed;</P>
<P>Blame an evil fate if the ascetic way is hard.</P>
<P>The Way is in the sage traditions; cultivation depends on the self;</P>
<P>Goodness is accumulated by people, but blessings come from Heaven.</P>
<P>Do not give play to the six sense-organs and their many desires;</P>
<P>Open up the single nature, original and primary.</P>
<P>When there are no attachments or thoughts, purity comes of itself;</P>
<P>Strive for liberation and achieve transcendence.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We will say no more of how officers were sent to the hostel to fetch
 Sanzang's three disciples.</P>
<P>Instead the story tells how Monkey, after taking his leave of Sanzang
 at the foot of the decorated tower, went happily back to the hostel,
 laughing aloud as he walked. &#8220;Why are you laughing so cheerfully,
 brother,&#8221; Pig and Friar Sand asked as they greeted him, &#8220;and why's the
 master disappeared?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The master has found happiness,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;What happiness?&#8221;
 Pig asked. &#8220;He hasn't reached the end of the journey, he hasn't seen
 the Buddha and he hasn't fetched the scriptures.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The master and I only got as far as the foot of a decorated tower at
 the crossroads,&#8221; Brother Monkey replied. &#8220;Just then the king's daughter
 hit the master with an embroidered ball, so he was hustled by palace
 beauties, pretty girls and eunuchs to the front of the tower, where he
 climbed into a carriage to go to the palace with the princess. He's
 been invited to become the king's son-in-law. Isn't that something to
 be cheerful about?&#8221;</P>
<P>When Pig heard this he stamped, beat his chest and said, &#8220;If I'd
 known beforehand, I'd have gone too. It was all Friar Sand's fault for
 making trouble. I'd have run straight to the foot of the decorated
 tower, the embroidered ball would have hit me first time, and the
 princess would have taken me for her husband. That would have been
 marvellous, terrific. I'm handsome and good-looking: I'd have been just
 the man. We'd all have been in luck and have had a good time. It'd have
 been real fun.&#8221;</P>
<P>Friar Sand went up to Pig, rubbed his face and said, &#8220;Shameless,
 you're shameless! That's a handsome mug, I must say. You're like the
 man who bought an old donkey for three-tenths of an ounce of silver and
 boasted that he'd be able to ride it. If she'd hit you first time she
 wouldn't have wanted to wait till tonight before burning spells to get
 rid of you. Do you think she'd have let trouble like you into the
 palace?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're being very disagreeable, you blacky,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;Ugly I
 may be, but I've got class. As the old saying goes, 'When skin and
 flesh are coarse, the bones may yet be strong: everyone is good at
 something.'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop talking nonsense, idiot,&#8221; Monkey retorted, &#8220;and pack the
 baggage. I expect the master will get anxious and send for us, so we
 must be ready to go to protect him at court.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're wrong again, brother,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;If the master's become the
 king's son-in-law and gone to take his pleasure with the king's
 daughter, he won't be climbing any more mountains, or tramping along
 the road, or running into demons and monsters. So what'll he want you
 to protect him from? He's old enough to know what happens under the
 bedcovers. He won't need you to hold him up.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey grabbed Pig by the ear, swung his fist, and said abusively,
 &#8220;You're as dirty-minded as ever, you cretin! How dare you talk such
 nonsense!&#8221;</P>
<P>While they were in the middle of their quarrel the hostel
 superintendent came to report, &#8220;His Majesty has sent an official here
 with a request for you three holy monks to present yourselves.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What's he really asking us to go for?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The senior holy monk had the good fortune to be hit by the
 princess's golden ball and be taken as her husband,&#8221; the superintendent
 replied, &#8220;which is why the official has come with invitations for you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where is the official?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;Send him in.&#8221;</P>
<P>The official then bowed in greeting to Monkey, after which he did not
 dare look straight at Monkey as he muttered to himself, &#8220;Is it a ghost?
 a monster? a thunder god? a yaksha?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why are you mumbling instead of saying whatever you have to say,
 official?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>Trembling with terror, the official raised the royal edict with both
 hands as his words came tumbling out in confusion: &#8220;Her Royal
 Highness&#8212;invitation&#8212;meet her new relations&#8212;Her Royal Highness&#8212;meet
 her relations&#8212;invitation....&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We've got no torture equipment here and we're not going to beat
 you,&#8221; Pig said, &#8220;so don't be frightened and take your time telling us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do you think he's scared you're going to beat him?&#8221; Monkey said.
 &#8220;What he's scared of is your ugly mug. Get the carrying-pole load
 packed up at once. We're taking the horse and going to court to see the
 master and talk things over.&#8221; Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>One you meet on a narrow path is hard to avoid;</P>
<P>Determination can turn love to hatred.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you do not know what was said when they met the king, listen to
 the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="1_0_95">Chapter 94</A></H3>
</I>
<P>The Four Monks Dine to Music in the Palace Gardens</P>
<P>One Demon Loves in Vain and Longs for Bliss</P>
</B>
<P>The story tells how Brother Monkey and the other two disciples went
 with the official who had brought the invitation to outside the
 Meridional Gate of the palace, where the eunuch gate officer
 immediately reported their arrival and brought back a summons for them
 to enter. The three of them stood in a row, not bowing. &#8220;Are you three
 gentlemen the illustrious disciples of the holy monk? What are your
 names? Where do you live? Why did you become monks? What scriptures are
 you going to fetch?&#8221; Monkey then came closer, intending to enter the
 throne hall.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't move,&#8221; one of the king's bodyguards shouted. &#8220;If you have
 anything to say, say it standing down there.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We monks like to step forward whenever we're given an opening,&#8221;
 Monkey said with a smile, at which Pig and Friar Sand too approached
 the king. Worried that their rough manners would alarm the king,
 Sanzang stepped forward and called out, &#8220;Disciples, His Majesty has
 asked you why you have come here. You must submit your reply.&#8221;</P>
<P>Seeing his master standing in attendance beside the king, Monkey
 could not restrain himself from calling aloud, &#8220;Your Majesty is
 treating yourself with respect but others with contempt. If you are
 taking my master as your son-in-law, why do you make him stand in
 attendance on you? The normal custom is for a king to call his
 son-in-law Your Excellency, and an Excellency really ought to be
 sitting down.&#8221;</P>
<P>This gave the king so bad a fright that he turned pale and wished he
 could leave the throne hall. But as this would have looked very bad he
 had to summon up his courage and tell his attendants of fetch an
 embroidered stool on which he invited the Tang Priest to sit. Only then
 did Brother Monkey submit the following spoken memorial: &#8220;My ancestral
 home is the Water Curtain Cave in the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit in
 the land of Aolai in the Eastern Continent of Superior Body.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>My father was heaven, my mother earth,</P>
<P>And I was born when a rock split open.</P>
<P>1 took as my master a Taoist adept,</P>
<P>And mastered the Great Way.</P>
<P>Then I returned to my land of immortals,</P>
<P>Where I gathered all of us to live in our cave heaven.</P>
<P>In the ocean's depths I subdued the dragons,</P>
<P>Then climbed the mountains to capture wild beasts.</P>
<P>I removed us from the registers of death,</P>
<P>Put us on the rolls of the living,</P>
<P>And was appointed Great Sage Equaling Heaven.</P>
<P>I enjoyed the heavenly palaces,</P>
<P>And roamed around the splendid buildings.</P>
<P>I met the immortals of Heaven</P>
<P>In daily carousals;</P>
<P>Lived in the holy regions,</P>
<P>Happy every day.</P>
<P>But because I disrupted the Peach Banquet,</P>
<P>And raised a rebellion in the palaces of Heaven,</P>
<P>I was captured by the Lord Buddha</P>
<P>And imprisoned under the Five Elements Mountain.</P>
<P>When hungry I was fed on pellets of iron,</P>
<P>When thirsty I drank molten copper:</P>
<P>For five hundred years I tasted no food or tea.</P>
<P>Fortunately my master came from the East</P>
<P>To worship in the West.</P>
<P>Guanyin told him to deliver me from heavenly disaster.</P>
<P>I was rescued from my torment</P>
<P>To be converted to the Yogacarin sect.</P>
<P>My old name was Wukong;</P>
<P>Now I am known as the Novice.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the king realized how important Monkey was he quickly came down
 from his dragon throne and walked over to steady the venerable elder
 with his hand and say, &#8220;Son-in-law, it was divine providence that
 brought us one such as yourself to be our kinsman through marriage.&#8221;
 Sanzang thanked the king profoundly for his graciousness and urged him
 to return to his throne. &#8220;Which gentleman has the distinction of being
 the second disciple?&#8221; the king asked. Pig thrust his snout out to make
 himself look more impressive as he replied:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;In previous lives old Pig used to be</P>
<P>Given to pleasure and indolence.</P>
<P>I lived in confusion,</P>
<P>My nature disordered and my heart deluded.</P>
<P>1 did not know how high the sky was or how deep the earth;</P>
<P>I could not tell the ocean's width or the mountains' distance.</P>
<P>Then in the middle of my idleness</P>
<P>I suddenly met a true immortal.</P>
<P>In half a sentence</P>
<P>He undid the net of evil;</P>
<P>With two or three remarks</P>
<P>He smashed the gate to disaster.</P>
<P>Then I became aware,</P>
<P>Took him as my master on the spot,</P>
<P>Diligently studied the arts of the Double Eight,</P>
<P>Respectfully refined the Triple Three's sequence.</P>
<P>When training was complete I was able to fly,</P>
<P>And ascend to the heavenly palace.</P>
<P>The Jade Emperor in his benevolence</P>
<P>Appointed me as Marshal Tian Peng,</P>
<P>To command the marines of the River of Heaven,</P>
<P>And wander at ease within the palace gates.</P>
<P>Then when I was drunk at the Peach Banquet</P>
<P>I misbehaved with the goddess of the moon,</P>
<P>Was stripped of my commission,</P>
<P>And exiled to the mortal world.</P>
<P>Because I came into the wrong womb</P>
<P>1 was born with the likeness of a pig.</P>
<P>Living at the Mount of Blessing</P>
<P>I committed unbounded evil.</P>
<P>When I met the Bodhisattva Guanyin</P>
<P>She showed me the way of goodness.</P>
<P>I came over to the Buddhist faith</P>
<P>To escort the Tang Priest</P>
<P>On his journey to the Western Heaven,</P>
<P>Seeking the marvellous scriptures.</P>
<P>My Dharma name is Wuneng,</P>
<P>And people call me Bajie.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the king heard this he trembled with fear, not daring to look at
 him. This made the idiot more spirited than ever, shaking his head,
 pursing his lips, thrusting his ears up and roaring with laughter.</P>
<P>Sanzang, worried that Pig was giving the king a fright, shouted,
 &#8220;Control yourself, Bajie.&#8221; Only then did Pig put his hands together and
 pretend to behave himself.</P>
<P>&#8220;And why was the third distinguished disciple converted?&#8221; the king
 then asked. Putting his hands together, Friar Sand said:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;I was originally a mortal man,</P>
<P>Who turned to the Way out of fear of the Wheel of Reincarnation.</P>
<P>1 wandered like a cloud to the corners of the seas.</P>
<P>Roamed to the very ends of the sky.</P>
<P>I always wore the robe and held the begging-bowl,</P>
<P>And ever concentrated my mind within the body.</P>
<P>Because of my sincerity</P>
<P>I fell in with immortals,</P>
<P>Raised the Baby Boy,</P>
<P>To mate him with the Lovely Girl.</P>
<P>When the Three Thousand Tasks were achieved</P>
<P>All was combined in the Four Images.</P>
<P>I rose above the boundary of the sky,</P>
<P>Bowed to the dark vault of heaven,</P>
<P>And was appointed Curtain-lifting General.</P>
<P>1 was in attendance on the Phoenix and Dragon Carriage,</P>
<P>And General was my rank.</P>
<P>Because at the Peach Banquet</P>
<P>1 accidentally smashed a crystal bowl</P>
<P>1 was exiled to the Flowing Sands River,</P>
<P>My face was altered,</P>
<P>And I became an evil killer.</P>
<P>Fortunately the Bodhisattva traveled to the East</P>
<P>To persuade me to turn to the faith</P>
<P>And await the Buddha's son from Tang.</P>
<P>Who would go to seek scriptures in the Western Heaven.</P>
<P>I became his follower and made a fresh start,</P>
<P>Refining once more my great awareness.</P>
<P>I took my surname Sand from the river;</P>
<P>My Buddhist name is Wujing,</P>
<P>And my title Friar.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The king was both most alarmed and most delighted to hear this.
 Delighted because his daughter had found herself a living Buddha, and
 alarmed by three veritable evil gods. Just as the king was being torn
 between alarm and delight the chief astrologer submitted this memorial:
 &#8220;The wedding has been set for the twelfth day of this month, the day of
 water-rat, a lucky time at which all will be auspicious for nuptials.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What day is it today?&#8221; the king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Today is the eighth, the day of earth-monkey,&#8221; the astrologer
 replied, &#8220;the day on which gibbons offer fruit, and the right day on
 which to advance worthies and accept their suggestions.&#8221; This greatly
 pleased the king, who sent his officials in attendance to have the
 halls and pavilions in the royal garden swept clear. Here he invited
 his future son-in-law with his three distinguished disciples to stay
 while they waited for the nuptial feast at which the princess would
 marry him. The underlings all carried out their instructions, the king
 ended the audience and the officials withdrew.</P>
<P>The story now tells how when Sanzang and his disciples reached the
 imperial garden night was falling. A vegetarian meal was laid on. &#8220;We
 really deserve a meal today,&#8221; said Pig with delight. The people in
 charge brought in plain rice and pasta by the carrying-pole load. Pig
 kept eating a bowlful then taking a refill over and over again. He only
 stopped eating when his stomach was completely full. A little later the
 lamps were lit and the bedding laid out, after which everyone went to
 bed. As soon as the venerable elder saw that there was nobody around he
 started to shout angrily at Monkey, berating him.</P>
<P>&#8220;You macaque, Wukong! You keep ruining me. I said we were just going
 to present the passport and told you not to go near the decorated
 tower. Why did you keep demanding to take me there to have a look?
 Well, did you have a good enough look? Whatever are we to do about this
 trouble you have got us into?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; replied Monkey, putting on a smile, &#8220;it was you who said,
 'My late mother married after throwing an embroidered ball to make the
 match she was destined for.' I only took you there because you seemed
 to want to enjoy something of the past. Besides, because I remembered
 what the ancient monk in the Almsgiver's Spread Gold Monastery said I
 came here to find out whether she's an impostor or not. When I saw the
 king just now there was something a bit sinister about the way he
 looked, but I haven't yet seen what the princess is like.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What will happen when you see the princess?&#8221; the venerable elder
 asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;My fiery eyes with their golden pupils can tell whether someone's
 true or false, good or evil, rich or poor,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;I'll know
 what to do and be able to sort out right and wrong.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So you've learned physiognomy in the last few days, elder brother,&#8221;
 said Friar Sand and Pig with a smile.</P>
<P>&#8220;Physiognomists are just my grandson,&#8221; Brother Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop joking,&#8221; shouted Sanzang. &#8220;He definitely wants me now. What are
 we to do about it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;At that happy occasion on the twelfth the princess is bound to come
 out to pay her respects to her parents,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'll take a look
 at her from where I'll stand by the side. If she really is a woman you
 can be her consort and enjoy the kingdom's glory and splendor.&#8221; This
 made Sanzang angrier than ever.</P>
<P>&#8220;You're a fine ape,&#8221; he said abusively, &#8220;still trying to ruin me. As
 Wuneng said, we have already done ninety-seven or ninety-eight
 hundredths of the journey. You're trying to destroy me with your crafty
 tongue again. Shut up! Don't open that stinking mouth of yours any
 more. Next time there's any misbehavior from you I shall start reciting
 that spell again, and that will be more than you can take.&#8221;</P>
<P>The mention of the spell being recited had Monkey falling straight to
 his knees before Sanzang and pleading, &#8220;Don't say it, don't say it! If
 she's really a woman we'll all raise a rumpus in the palace during the
 wedding ceremony and get you out.&#8221; While master and disciples were
 talking they had not noticed that it was now night. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Slow dripped the clepsydras;</P>
<P>Heavy hung the fragrance of the flowers.</P>
<P>Pearl curtains hung over splendid doorways;</P>
<P>No fire or light was seen in the still courtyard.</P>
<P>Empty was the shadow of the deserted swing;</P>
<P>All was silence when the flute's notes died away.</P>
<P>The room was surrounded by flowers and bright in the moonbeams,</P>
<P>Lit by those spiky stars not blocked by any trees.</P>
<P>The cuckoo rested from her song;</P>
<P>Long was the butterfly's dream.</P>
<P>The River Way spanned the celestial vault</P>
<P>While white clouds made their way home.</P>
<P>Just when they were closest in feeling</P>
<P>The willows swaying in the wind were more dispiriting than ever.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's late, Master,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;Let's carry on arguing tomorrow
 morning. Go to sleep now, go to sleep!&#8221; Master and disciples did then
 get a night's sleep.</P>
<P>The golden cockerel was soon greeting the dawn, and the king entered
 the throne hall for his audience. This is what could be seen:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A purple aura rising high above the opened palace</P>
<P>As the winds carried royal music to the azure sky.</P>
<P>While clouds drifted, the leopard-tail banners moved;</P>
<P>The sun shone upon the demon figures on the roof, and the jade
 pendants tinkled.</P>
<P>A scented mist delicately touched the palace's green willows,</P>
<P>While dewdrops lightly moistened the garden flowers.</P>
<P>A thousand officials in ranks shouted and danced in homage:</P>
<P>Seas and rivers were at peace and the state was unified.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When all the civil and military officials had paid their homage to
 him, the king proclaimed, &#8220;The Department of Foreign Relations will
 arrange a nuptial banquet for the twelfth. Today the spring wine shall
 be prepared, and our future son-in-law shall be entertained in the
 royal gardens.&#8221; The Protocol Office were told to lead the three worthy
 future royal in-laws to sit in the state hostel while the Department of
 Foreign Relations laid on a vegetarian banquet for the three of them.
 The two departments arranged for the musicians of the court orchestra
 to play and look after them while they passed the days enjoying the
 beauty of spring.</P>
<P>As soon as Pig heard this he said, &#8220;Your Majesty, we always stay with
 our master: we never leave him for a moment. As he's going to be
 drinking and feasting in the palace gardens we'd better go along for a
 couple of days' fun too if our master's to be your son-in-law.
 Otherwise the deal's off.&#8221; Seeing how ugly and coarse-spoken Pig was,
 twisting his head and neck, thrusting his snout out and waving his
 ears&#8212;which all made him seem rather intimidating&#8212;the king was so
 worried that Pig might ruin the wedding that he had to accede to the
 request.</P>
<P>&#8220;Prepare a banquet for two in the Sino-Barbarian Hall of Eternal
 Pacification for our son-in-law and ourself. Prepare a meal for the
 other three gentlemen in the Pavilion of Lingering Spring. We are
 afraid that it might be inconvenient for master and disciples to sit
 together.&#8221; Only then did the idiot chant his respects to the king and
 thank him. Everyone then withdrew, after which the king ordered the
 officials of the inner palace to prepare a banquet, and told the queens
 and consorts of the three palaces and six compounds to give the
 princess hair ornaments, cakes and other things for the wedding on the
 twelfth.</P>
<P>It was now about ten in the morning, and the king had a carriage
 ready in which to take the Tang Priest and the others to go to see the
 palace gardens. The gardens were a fine place:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The paths, inlaid with coloured stones,</P>
<P>Have carved and chiseled balustrades.</P>
<P>Beside the paths inlaid with coloured stones</P>
<P>Strange flowers spread over the rocks;</P>
<P>Outside the carved and chiseled balustrades,</P>
<P>And within them too, flower blossoms rare.</P>
<P>Early peach trees are a bewitching turquoise,</P>
<P>And golden orioles dart among the willows.</P>
<P>The walker finds the fragrance fill his sleeve,</P>
<P>And many pure scents imbue his clothing.</P>
<P>Phoenix terrace and dragon pool,</P>
<P>Bamboo lodge and pine pavilion.</P>
<P>On the phoenix terrace</P>
<P>Pipes are played to lure the phoenix to appear;</P>
<P>In the dragon pools</P>
<P>Fish are reared to become dragons and leave.</P>
<P>In the bamboo lodge are poems</P>
<P>Whose well-chosen words match the &#8220;White Snow Melody&#8221;</P>
<P>The books in the pine pavilion</P>
<P>Are pearls and jade in blue-covered volumes.</P>
<P>Rocks and jade twist around the artificial hills;</P>
<P>Deep are the blue-green waters of the winding stream.</P>
<P>Peony pavilions,</P>
<P>Rose bowers,</P>
<P>Make a natural brocade.</P>
<P>Trellises of jasmine,</P>
<P>Beds of begonia,</P>
<P>Are like sunset clouds or jeweled mosaics.</P>
<P>Herbaceous peonies are marvelously fragrant;</P>
<P>Rare is the beauty of the mallows from Sichuan.</P>
<P>White pear and red apricot blossom vie in scent;</P>
<P>Purple orchid and golden daylily compete in splendor.</P>
<P>Corn poppy,</P>
<P>Lily magnolia buds,</P>
<P>Azalea flowers,</P>
<P>Are brilliantly coloured.</P>
<P>Magnolia flowers,</P>
<P>Garden balsam,</P>
<P>Plantain lilies,</P>
<P>Tremble.</P>
<P>Everywhere red shines through the richness of cosmetics</P>
<P>While heavy scents drift from a brocade surrounding screen.</P>
<P>The warmth returning with the East wind is greeted with joy;</P>
<P>All the garden's beauties display their brilliance.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The king and his companions walked around enjoying the flowers for a
 long time. Soon the officials of the Protocol Office came to invite
 Monkey and the other two to the Pavilion of Lingering Spring while the
 king led the Tang Priest by the hand to the Sino-Barbarian Hall so that
 they could all drink and feast. These were splendid occasions with
 singing, dancing and instrumental music. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The sun shone from the majestic palace gates;</P>
<P>Good auras filled the royal buildings.</P>
<P>The spring spread out an embroidery of flowers,</P>
<P>And heaven's light shone from afar on the court robes.</P>
<P>Pipes and singers wafted their music as if in a banquet of immortals;</P>
<P>The goblets flew, carrying jade liquor.</P>
<P>Master and subjects enjoyed the same pleasure</P>
<P>As Sino-barbarian peace brought prosperity.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Seeing with what great respect he was being treated by the king, the
 venerable elder had nothing for it but to force himself to join in the
 celebrations. In fact he gave only a show of happiness: inside he was
 miserable. As he sat there he saw four golden screens hanging on the
 wall, screens painted with scenes of the four seasons. Each picture had
 a poem on it by a famous academician. The poem on the spring scene
 read:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The vital forces of heaven turn creation around;</P>
<P>The world is happy and everything is renewed.</P>
<P>The peach and the plum blossoms vie in splendor;</P>
<P>Swallows fly to the painted rafters, shaking the incense dust.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The poem on the summer scene read:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In warm and sultry air all thoughts are slow</P>
<P>The palace mallow and pomegranate reflect the sun's brilliance.</P>
<P>The jade flute's music disturbs the noonday dream;</P>
<P>The scent of caltrops is wafted through the curtains.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The poem on the autumn scene read:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>One leaf on the parasol tree by the well is yellow;</P>
<P>The pearl curtain is not rolled up on the night of frost.</P>
<P>After the autumn sacrifice the swallows abandon their nest;</P>
<P>When the rush flowers snap, the wild geese leave for another land.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The poem on the winter scene read:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The clouds fly over the rainy sky, all dark and cold;</P>
<P>The North wind blows the snow into thousands of bills.</P>
<P>Deep in the palace the stove glows warm;</P>
<P>They say the plum has blossomed by the jade balustrade.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the king noticed the absorption with which the Tang Priest was
 gazing at the poems he said, &#8220;As you enjoy savoring the poems so much
 you must be a fine poet yourself, son-in-law. If you do not begrudge
 your pearls we would like to invite you to make up a matching poem for
 each of them, ending three of the lines with the same word. Will you
 agree?&#8221;</P>
<P>The venerable elder was the sort of person who could be so carried
 away by a scene that he forgot the circumstances, someone who had an
 enlightened mind and thoroughly comprehended his own nature, so when
 the king pressed him so earnestly to match the verses he found himself
 saying the line, &#8220;The sun's warmth melts the ice the world around.&#8221;</P>
<P>This greatly pleased the king, who told the officials in attendance
 on him, &#8220;Fetch the four treasures of the study, so that our son-in-law
 can write down the matching verses he composes for us to savor at our
 leisure.&#8221; The venerable elder was glad to comply. Picking up a brush,
 he produced matching lines. The matching poem on the spring scene read:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The sun's warmth melts the ice the world around;</P>
<P>Within the palace garden, flowers are renewed.</P>
<P>Gentle winds and rain enrich the people;</P>
<P>Rivers and seas are calm; gone is all worldly dust.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The matching poem on the summer scene read:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Dipper now points South; the day goes slow;</P>
<P>Locust and pomegranate trees contend in brilliance.</P>
<P>Golden oriole and purple swallow sing in the willows,</P>
<P>Their melodious voices drifting through red curtains.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The matching poem on the autumn read:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Fragrant the green mandarin; the orange turns to yellow.</P>
<P>Blue pine and cypress welcome frost's coming.</P>
<P>Half-open chrysanthemums make a tapestry on the trellis;</P>
<P>Pipes and songs waft through the watery, cloud-covered land.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The matching poem on the winter scene read:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As skies clear after welcome snow the air is cold;</P>
<P>Grotesque-shaped crags and boulders mark jade hills.</P>
<P>As charcoal burns in the stove to warm the yogurt</P>
<P>Singing with hands in their sleeves they lean on jade balustrades.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The king was utterly delighted by the matching verses. &#8220;'Singing with
 hands in their sleeves they lean on jade balustrades' is really good,&#8221;
 he said with admiration, and ordered the royal orchestra to set the new
 poems to music. The banquet did not break up until the day was over.</P>
<P>Brother Monkey and the other two were also having a splendid meal in
 the Pavilion of Lingering Spring. Each of them was feeling rather merry
 after downing a few cups, and they decided to go to see their master,
 who was in another building with the king. This made Pig start acting
 like the idiot he was.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is great,&#8221; he yelled at once. &#8220;We're doing very nicely here.
 Today we've had a right good time. But now we're full we ought to go to
 sleep it off.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You really are ill-bred, brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand with a grin. &#8220;How
 could you possibly go to sleep when you're as full as that?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You wouldn't know,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;There's a saying that goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Unless you stretch out for a nap when you've dined</P>
<P>How can your belly with fat be well lined?&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the Tang Priest had taken his leave of the king he went back to
 the pavilion and scolded pig: &#8220;Cretin! You acted coarser than ever.
 What sort of place do you think this is, to shout and yell like that?
 If you had made the king angry he would have had you killed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;don't worry. We're being treated as his
 in-laws, so it would be very awkward for him to get angry with us. As
 the proverb goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you're related a beating can't rend it;</P>
<P>If you are neighbors a cursing won't end it.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We were only joking. He's nothing to be frightened of.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this the venerable elder shouted, &#8220;Bring the idiot here. Give him
 twenty strokes of the dhyana staff.&#8221; Monkey then grabbed Pig and
 knocked him over, while Sanzang raised the cudgel to beat him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master, Royal Son-in-law,&#8221; the idiot shouted, &#8220;Spare me! Spare me!&#8221;</P>
<P>One of the officials who was present at the banquet persuaded Sanzang
 not to hit Pig, who clambered back on his feet, grumbling, &#8220;You're a
 fine excellency; you're a fine royal son-in-law. Applying the royal law
 before you're even married!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop that nonsense,&#8221; said Monkey, making a face at him, &#8220;stop that
 nonsense! Go to bed at once.&#8221; They then spent another night in the
 Lingering Spring Pavilion. The next morning they feasted as before.</P>
<P>Before long they had been enjoying themselves for three or four days,
 by when it was that splendid day, the twelfth. The officials of the
 three sections of the Department of Foreign Relations all submitted a
 memorial that said, &#8220;Since we received the edicts on the eighth the
 palace for the Royal Son-in-law has been built, and all that we are
 waiting for is for the trousseau to be installed. The nuptial banquet
 has been prepared, with meat and vegetarian food for over five hundred
 guests.&#8221;</P>
<P>This greatly pleased the king, who was just going to invite his
 future son-in-law to come to the banquet when a eunuch from the inner
 quarters of the palace reported to him, &#8220;Your Majesty, Her Majesty the
 Queen asks you to come.&#8221; The king then withdrew to the inner quarters
 of the palace, where the queens of the three palaces and the consorts
 of the six compounds brought the princess to the Sunlight Palace to
 talk and joke together. The place was truly a mass of flowers or
 brocade. The magnificence and beauty was more than a match for the
 halls of heaven or the moon's pavilions; nor was it inferior to the
 jade palaces of immortals.</P>
<P>There are four new lyrics on the &#8220;Happy Gathering and Splendid
 Wedding&#8221; about it. The lyric &#8220;Happy&#8221; goes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Happy! Happy!</P>
<P>Delight and bliss!</P>
<P>The wedding is celebrated</P>
<P>With its love and beauty.</P>
<P>Elegant court dresses</P>
<P>That the Lady of the Moon could never rival;</P>
<P>Dragon and phoenix hairpins,</P>
<P>Sumptuous threads of flying gold.</P>
<P>Cherry lips, white teeth and rouge-red cheeks</P>
<P>Sylphs with forms as delicate as flowers.</P>
<P>Brocades upon brocades,</P>
<P>An extravagance of color,</P>
<P>Full of fragrance,</P>
<P>A host of princesses.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The lyric &#8220;Gathering&#8221; goes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Gathering! Gathering!</P>
<P>Bewitching charms,</P>
<P>Rivaling the great beauties of the past,</P>
<P>Enough to topple a city or a state,</P>
<P>Like flowers or jade.</P>
<P>Dressed to make them lovelier still,</P>
<P>Even more dazzling in their finery,</P>
<P>And the splendor of their jewels.</P>
<P>Their orchid hearts and natures were pure and lofty;</P>
<P>Noble were their powder-white faces and ice-smooth skin.</P>
<P>The lines of their painted eyebrows were like distant hills;</P>
<P>They formed a throng of willowy elegance.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The lyric &#8220;Splendid&#8221; goes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Splendid! Splendid!</P>
<P>Jade girls, fairy maidens,</P>
<P>Utterly adorable,</P>
<P>Truly to be admired,</P>
<P>Perfumed with fine fragrances,</P>
<P>Adorned with cosmetics.</P>
<P>Although far from the Tiantai paradise,</P>
<P>This was no mere palace of a king.</P>
<P>Sweet were their smiling words</P>
<P>As the sound of pipes and songs was wafted around.</P>
<P>A thousand beauties, massed flowers, a splendid brocade:</P>
<P>How could its match be found in the world?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The lyric &#8220;Wedding&#8221; goes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Wedding! Wedding!</P>
<P>Orchid Fragrance,</P>
<P>Ranks of fairy girls,</P>
<P>Crowds of beauties.</P>
<P>The royal concubines have put on new splendor;</P>
<P>The princesses are in fresh garments.</P>
<P>Piled clouds of raven hair,</P>
<P>Rainbow gowns over phoenix skirts.</P>
<P>Soft music of immortals,</P>
<P>Two rows of purple and red.</P>
<P>In the past they pledged to ride in one phoenix chariot;</P>
<P>This morning is the happy occasion and the splendid wedding.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the king arrived his queens and consorts led the princess and
 the other palace ladies out to meet him. The delighted king took them
 into the Sunlight Palace to sit down. When the queens, consorts and
 others had made their obeisances the king said, &#8220;Princess, my good
 daughter, we think that your heart's desire was fulfilled when you had
 the good fortune to find the holy monk by throwing your ball from the
 decorated tower on the eighth. The officials of all the departments
 have been most understanding of our wishes, so that everything is now
 ready. As today is a lucky one let us hurry to the nuptial banquet and
 not be late.&#8221;</P>
<P>The princess stepped forward, went down in a kowtow, and submitted
 this petition: &#8220;Your Majesty my father, I beg you to forgive your
 daughter for her effrontery, but I have a request to make. In the last
 few days it has been reported in the inner quarters of the palace that
 the Tang Priest has three extremely hideous disciples. I couldn't bring
 myself to see them: I'm afraid the sight would terrify me. So I beg
 you, Father, to send them out of the city. Otherwise the shock might be
 too much for my trail health and lead to disaster.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you had not mentioned them, child,&#8221; the king replied, &#8220;we would
 have very nearly forgotten about them. They are indeed rather ugly, and
 for the last few days we have had them entertained in the Lingering
 Spring Pavilion. When we go into the throne hall this morning we will
 return their passport and tell them to leave the city so that we can
 hold our banquet.&#8221; The princess then kowtowed again in thanks, after
 which the king left in his carriage to enter the throne hall and issue
 a decree inviting his son-in-law and the other three gentlemen to
 attend.</P>
<P>Now the Tang Priest had been following the dates by counting on his
 fingers, so when he reached the twelfth he had a discussion with his
 three disciples before dawn. &#8220;It is the twelfth today,&#8221; he said. &#8220;How
 are we to cope?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've already noticed something of an ill-omened air about the king,&#8221;
 Brother Monkey replied, &#8220;but the evil hasn't actually infected him or
 done any great harm. The only thing is that I've not yet had a look at
 the princess. If she comes out and lets me take a peep at her I'll know
 whether she's an impostor or not, then I'll do something. Don't worry.
 He's bound to summon us now and send us three away from the city.
 Accept the invitation and don't be afraid. I'll slip back and stay
 close to you to protect you.&#8221; As master and disciples were talking a
 royal equerry did indeed come with officials from the protocol office
 to bring an invitation.</P>
<P>&#8220;Let's go,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;let's go. I'm sure they're going to see us
 three on our way and keep you here, Master, for the wedding.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If they're seeing us off they're bound to give us hundreds and
 thousands of ounces of gold and silver,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;We'll be able to
 buy some presents to take home with us. When I get back to my in-laws'
 place I'll be able to have a bit of fun again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Shut up, second brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;and stop talking such
 nonsense. We'll do what big brother says.&#8221;</P>
<P>They then followed the officials to the foot of the throne hall
 steps, taking baggage and horse with them. When the king had greeted
 them he commanded Monkey and the other two to come forward. &#8220;Hand your
 passport up,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and we shall seal it, sign it and return it to
 you. You three gentlemen will be generously provided with funds for
 your journey and escorted on your way to see the Buddha on Vulture
 Peak. If you come back with the scriptures you will also receive
 generous rewards. We shall keep our son-in-law here: there will be no
 need for you to worry about him.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey thanked the king, then told Friar Sand to take the passport
 out and hand it over. The king read it, sealed and signed it, then
 brought out ten ingots of gold and twenty of silver that he wanted to
 present to them as gifts for his in-laws. Pig, who always had been very
 keen on money and sex, stepped forward to accept them.</P>
<P>Monkey then gave a respectful chant and said, &#8220;We've disturbed you.&#8221;</P>
<P>As Monkey turned to go Sanzang hastily scrambled to his feet, grabbed
 hold of him, and said through clenched teeth, &#8220;You are all abandoning
 me.&#8221;</P>
<P>Brother Monkey pinched the palm of Sanzang's hand, gave him a
 meaningful look and said, &#8220;Unwind and take your pleasure here while we
 go to fetch the scriptures. We'll call on you on our way back.&#8221; Not
 knowing whether to believe this or not, the venerable elder refused to
 let him go. When all the officials saw this they took it for a real
 parting. Soon the king invited his son-in-law back into the throne
 hall, ordering the officials to escort the three gentlemen out of the
 city, whereupon Sanzang had to let go of Monkey and enter the hall.</P>
<P>As Brother Monkey and the other two went out through the palace gates
 they each took their leave.</P>
<P>&#8220;Are we really going?&#8221; asked Pig. Monkey said nothing, and just
 walked back to the hostel, where the superintendent received them and
 provided tea and a meal.</P>
<P>&#8220;You two stay here,&#8221; Monkey said to Pig and Friar Sand, &#8220;and whatever
 you do, don't show your faces. If the hostel superintendent asks what's
 happening, give him vague answers. Don't say anything. I'm going off to
 look after the master.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage pulled out one of his hairs, blew on it with
 magic breath, called &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned it into his own double to
 stay in the hostel with Pig and Friar Sand, while he himself leapt up
 into mid air in a flash, turning himself into a bee.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Yellow wings, sweet mouth and a sharp tail,</P>
<P>He dances wildly in the wind,</P>
<P>The brilliant thief of fragrance from the blossom</P>
<P>Who sways his way through willows and flowers.</P>
<P>With many a drenching for his troubles</P>
<P>He flies to and fro, but all in vain.</P>
<P>The thick delight be makes he never tastes;</P>
<P>All he can do is leave his fame behind.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Watch him as he flies lightly into the palace, where he saw the Tang
 Priest sitting on an embroidered stool at the king's left, frowning and
 worried at heart. Flying up to his master's Vairocana mitre, Monkey
 crept stealthily to his ear and said, &#8220;I'm here, Master, so don't
 fret.&#8221; These words were heard by the Tang Priest alone,&#8212;none of the
 ordinary mortals had any hope of hearing them&#8212;so he felt relief at
 last.</P>
<P>Before long a eunuch came with an invitation: &#8220;Your Majesty, the
 nuptial banquet is set out in the Jay Palace. Her Majesty and the
 princess are awaiting you in the inner quarters. They invite Your
 Majesty and His Excellency to go in for the wedding.&#8221; Overwhelmed with
 happiness, the king went into the inner quarters with his son-in-law.
 Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The wicked king's love of flowers led to disaster;</P>
<P>When the dhyana mind starts thinking, each thought brings sorrow.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know how the Tang Priest escaped once in the inner
 quarters of the palace, listen to the explanation in the next
 installment.</P>

</B>
<P>The story tells how the Tang Priest was feeling thoroughly miserable
 as he accompanied the king into the inner quarters, from where a great
 sound of drums and music arose and fine perfumes could be smelt. He
 kept his head bowed, not daring to look up. Monkey, secretly very
 pleased, had fixed himself to the Vairocana mitre, from where he used
 his magic light to look around with his fiery eyes and golden pupils.
 There were two ranks of court ladies, making it seem like a palace of
 flowers or immortals, and finer than a spring breeze blowing past a
 brocade screen. Indeed, they were</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Graceful and charming,</P>
<P>Jadelike, and with ice-smooth skin.</P>
<P>Bewitching pairs more lovely than the girl of Chu,</P>
<P>Beauties two by two, rivaling the lady Xi Shi.</P>
<P>Their hair was coiled high like flying phoenixes;</P>
<P>Their eyebrows were just visible, low lines of distant hills.</P>
<P>Elegantly played the pipe and shawm;</P>
<P>Fast sounded flute and drum.</P>
<P>All the notes of the scale rang out,</P>
<P>Rising then falling again together.</P>
<P>Delightful were they as they danced and sang,</P>
<P>A carpet of flowers, every one of them lovely.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Seeing that his master was not in the least moved by this Monkey
 silently smacked his lips in admiration and said, &#8220;What a fine monk!
 What a fine monk!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Dwelling amid splendor, his heart forms no attachment;</P>
<P>Walking through magnificence, his mind is not confused.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A little later the princess came out of the Jay Palace surrounded by
 the queens and consorts so greet the king with cheers of &#8220;Long live the
 king! Long live the king!&#8221; This so alarmed the venerable elder that he
 trembled, not knowing what to do.</P>
<P>By now Monkey had already noticed a touch of the demonic&#8212;though
 nothing very vicious&#8212;that could just be made out in the aura above the
 princess's head. Monkey crawled quickly to Sanzang's ear and said, &#8220;The
 princess is a fake, Master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If she is a fake,&#8221; the venerable elder replied, &#8220;then how are we to
 make her turn back into her real form?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll give myself a magic body and catch her right here,&#8221; said
 Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;That would terrify His Majesty,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;Wait till he and his
 queens have withdrawn before using your magic.&#8221;</P>
<P>Now Monkey had been impatient by nature all his life, so he could not
 restrain himself. With a great and angry roar he resumed his true from,
 rushed up and grabbed the princess. &#8220;You're a fine, evil beast,&#8221; he
 said abusively. &#8220;You've had no end of luxury here, you impostor, but it
 wasn't enough for you. You're so sex-crazed you had to try to trick my
 master and destroy his primal masculinity.&#8221; This struck the king
 speechless with fright, and made the queens and consorts fall about.
 The palace beauties all ran off to hide, fleeing for their lives. It
 was just like</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A roaring wind in spring,</P>
<P>The howling autumn gale.</P>
<P>When the roaring wind in spring blows through the wood</P>
<P>A thousand blossoms are shaken;</P>
<P>When the howling autumn gale hits the park</P>
<P>Ten thousand leaves all swirl and fly.</P>
<P>The tree peony beneath the balustrade is snapped;</P>
<P>Herbaceous peonies beside the balcony fall over.</P>
<P>Hibiscus on the pond's banks are shaken all about.</P>
<P>While chrysanthemums are flung in heaps at the foot of the terrace.</P>
<P>The delicate begonia collapses in the dust;</P>
<P>The fragrant rose is now sleeping in the wilds.</P>
<P>The spring wind smashes caltrop, lotus and pear;</P>
<P>Winter snows weigh down the plum tree's tender blossoms.</P>
<P>The petals of the pomegranate</P>
<P>Are scattered all around the inner courtyard;</P>
<P>The branches of the willow</P>
<P>Are blown sideways within the royal palace.</P>
<P>Fine blooms, and a night of raging wind and rain:</P>
<P>Countless red petals carpet the ground with brocade.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sanzang hastily put his trembling arms round the king and said,
 &#8220;Don't be afraid, Your Majesty. It is only my wicked disciple using his
 magical powers to find out whether she is an impostor or not.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Seeing that things were going badly for her, the evil spirit broke
 free, tore off her clothes, flung down her jewelry and hair ornaments
 and ran to the shrine of the local deity in the palace garden. From
 here she brought out a short club shaped like the head of a
 trip-hammer, with which she started hitting wildly at Monkey as she
 turned quickly towards him. Monkey, who had caught up with her at once,
 struck back at her face with his iron cudgel, Shouting and roaring at
 each other, the two of them started fighting in the palace gardens.
 Then each began a great display of magic powers, riding clouds as they
 battled in mid air. In this fight</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Great was the fame of the gold-banded cudgel;</P>
<P>No one had heard of the hammerhead club.</P>
<P>One of them was there to fetch the true scriptures;</P>
<P>The other was lingering for love of rare flowers.</P>
<P>Long had the demon known of the holy Tang Priest,</P>
<P>And she longed to mate with his primal seed-juices.</P>
<P>In a past year she had carried off the real princess,</P>
<P>And taken the form of the king's true daughter.</P>
<P>When she met the Great Sage, who saw her evil aura,</P>
<P>He could tell true from false as he came to save a life.</P>
<P>The murderous club was flung at the head;</P>
<P>The mighty iron cudgel struck back at the face.</P>
<P>Ranting and roaring, they were locked in struggle,</P>
<P>Filling the skies and blotting out the sun.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As the two of them battled in mid air they terrified the common
 people of the city, and struck fear into all the officials at court.
 The venerable elder kept saying as he supported the king, &#8220;Don't be
 alarmed, and please tell Her Majesty and all the others not to be
 afraid. Your princess is an impostor pretending to be her. When my
 disciple has captured her you will be able to see whether she is good
 or evil.&#8221; Some of the bolder consorts brought clothes and jewelry to
 show the queen.</P>
<P>&#8220;These are what the princess wore. She tore them off and is fighting
 that monk up in the sky stark naked. She must be an evil spirit.&#8221; Only
 then did the king, queens and consorts come to their senses and look up
 into the sky.</P>
<P>When the evil spirit and the Great Sage had been fighting for half a
 day without either emerging as victor Monkey threw his cudgel up and
 called &#8220;Change!&#8221; One turned into ten, ten into a hundred, and a hundred
 into a thousand. Half the sky was filled with writhing serpents and
 pythons striking wildly at the evil spirit. With a flurry of her hands
 and feet she turned into a pure wind and fled into the azure sky.
 Monkey said a spell, took all the iron cudgels back into a single
 cudgel, and went straight after her magic light.</P>
<P>As he approached the Western Gate of Heaven and saw the dazzling
 flags and banners Monkey shouted at the top of his voice, &#8220;Heavenly
 gatekeepers, stop that evil spirit and don't let her get away.&#8221; The
 gate was being held by the Heavenly King Lokapala with the four great
 marshals Pang, Liu, Gou and Bi, who did indeed use their weapons to
 block the way. As she could not get further she turned straight back
 and started fighting Monkey with her short club.</P>
<P>As he wheeled his iron cudgel the Great Sage looked carefully at her
 and saw that one end of her club was thick and one end thin, just like
 the lead of a trip-hammer used for hulling with a mortar, so he gave a
 furious roar and shouted, &#8220;Beast! What's that implement you're holding?
 How dare you fight me with it? Surrender at once or I'll smash your
 skull with a single blow from my cudgel.&#8221;</P>
<P>Grinding her teeth, the evil spirit replied, &#8220;You don't know about
 this weapon of mine, so listen while I tell you:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Its immortal root was a piece of mutton-fat jade,</P>
<P>Which took countless years to be worked into shape.</P>
<P>It was already mine when chaos was separated;</P>
<P>When the primal disorder was sorted out I came first.</P>
<P>Its origins cannot be compared with mere mortal things;</P>
<P>Its nature has always belonged to the highest heaven.</P>
<P>Embodying the golden light and the four images</P>
<P>With the auspicious vapors of the Five Elements and the Three
 Primaries.</P>
<P>Long did it live with me in the Moon Palace,</P>
<P>Staying beside me in the Cassia Hall.</P>
<P>For love of flowers I descended to the mortal world,</P>
<P>Coming to India as a beautiful impostor.</P>
<P>The only reason why I shared the King's pleasures</P>
<P>Was because I wanted my destined marriage with the Tang Priest.</P>
<P>How could you be so cruel as to ruin this fine mating,</P>
<P>Pursuing me and giving rein to your vicious nature?</P>
<P>Great is the fame of this implement of mine,</P>
<P>Which is older than your cudgel with gold bands.</P>
<P>It was a drug-pounding pestle in the Moon Palace:</P>
<P>One blow from this and a life is ended.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he replied with a mocking laugh, &#8220;Evil beast!
 If you used to live in the Toad Palace you must have heard of my
 powers. How dare you argue with me! Turn back into your real self and
 surrender at once if I'm to spare your life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I know you,&#8221; the monster replied. &#8220;You're the Protector of the
 Horses who made great havoc in the palaces of Heaven five hundred years
 ago. By rights I ought to give way to you, but because you've wrecked
 my marriage I hate you as much as if you'd killed my mother and father.
 It's more than I can stand for. I'm going to kill you, you Protector of
 the Horses, for breaking the laws of Heaven.&#8221; The words Protector of
 the Horses always infuriated the Great Sage, so the moment he heard
 them he flew into a great rage, lifted his iron cudgel and struck at
 her face. The evil spirit swung her pestle in reply. A ferocious battle
 then ensued in front of the Western Gate of Heaven. In this combat
 there were</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A gold-banded cudgel,</P>
<P>A drug-pounding pestle,</P>
<P>Two immortals' weapons, a worthy match.</P>
<P>One had come down to earth for the sake of a marriage;</P>
<P>The other was there to protect the Tang Priest.</P>
<P>It was because the king was not a righteous one</P>
<P>And loved flowers that he attracted the evil spirit,</P>
<P>Causing today's bitter strife</P>
<P>As two of them gave Ml play to their stubbornness of heart.</P>
<P>Charging and rushing each other they strove for triumph;</P>
<P>In cutting words they fought on with their tongues.</P>
<P>Rare was the martial prowess of the medicine pestle,</P>
<P>But finer still was the iron cudgel's might.</P>
<P>A powerful golden light flashed at the heavenly gates;</P>
<P>Brilliantly coloured mists went right down to the earth.</P>
<P>After a dozen rounds of fighting to and fro</P>
<P>The evil spirit became too weak to resist.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the evil spirit had fought another dozen or so rounds with
 Brother Monkey she could see how thick and fast his blows were coming,
 and realized that she could not win. Feinting with her pestle, she
 shook herself and fled due South in ten thousand beams of golden light
 with the Great Sage in pursuit. Suddenly they reached a great mountain,
 where the evil spirit landed her golden light and disappeared into a
 cave. Monkey, who was worried that she might escape, return to India
 and do some underhand harm to the Tang Priest, made sure he could
 recognize the mountain then turned his cloud round and went straight
 back to the capital.</P>
<P>It was now about four in the afternoon. The king was clinging to
 Sanzang, shivering and shaking as he kept saying, &#8220;Save me, holy monk!&#8221;</P>
<P>The consorts and queens were all in a panic as the Great Sage came
 down from the clouds with a cry of, &#8220;Here I am, Master!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stand still, Wukong,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;You must not alarm His Majesty.
 Now, I am asking you what in fact happened about the imitation
 princess.&#8221; Standing outside the Jay Palace, Monkey put his hands
 together in front of his chest and said, &#8220;The imitation princess was an
 evil spirit. First of all I fought her for half a day, and she couldn't
 beat me, so she turned into a pure wind and fled straight to the gates
 of heaven. I shouted to the gods to block her way. She turned back into
 her real self and fought another dozen or so rounds with me. Then she
 turned herself into golden light and fled due South to a mountain,
 beaten. I chased her as fast as I could till I got to the mountain, but
 I couldn't find her anywhere. Then I came back because I was worried
 she might come here to harm you.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the king heard this he grabbed hold of the Tang Priest and
 asked, &#8220;If the false princess was an evil spirit, where is my real
 princess?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When I've caught the false princess your real princess will turn up
 by herself,&#8221; Monkey replied straight away. When the queens and consorts
 heard this their fears vanished, and each of them came forward to bow
 and say, &#8220;We beg you to rescue our real princess, holy monk, and sort
 out the light from the dark. You will be richly rewarded.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is no place for us to talk,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I beg Your Majesty
 to go from the inner quarters to the throne hall with my master. Her
 Majesty and the rest of them should all go back to the inner palace,
 and my fellow-disciples Pig and Friar Sand should be sent for to
 protect my master so that I can go and subdue the demon. That will keep
 a proper distinction between the inner and outer quarters of the
 palace, and spare me from worrying. I am going to sort this out to show
 my sincerity.&#8221;</P>
<P>The king accepted the suggestion and was boundlessly grateful. He led
 the Tang Priest out of the inner quarters and straight to the throne
 hall. All the queens and consorts returned to the inner palace. A
 vegetarian meal was ordered while Pig and Friar Sand were sent for. The
 two of them soon arrived. Monkey explained to them both about what had
 happened and told them to guard the master carefully. The Great Sage
 set off by his cloud somersault and flew up into mid air. All the
 officials in front of the throne hall looked up into the sky and bowed
 low.</P>
<P>The Great Sage Monkey went straight to the mountain that lay due
 South. When the evil spirit had fled in defeat to the mountain and gone
 into her den she blocked the entrance with boulders and lay hidden
 there, terrified. Having looked around for a while and seen no sign of
 life Monkey felt very impatient, so he made a spell with his hands and
 said the magic words, calling out the local deity and mountain god to
 be questioned. A moment later the two gods arrived, kowtowed and said,
 &#8220;We didn't realize, we didn't realize. If we had known we'd have gone a
 long way to meet you. We beg you to forgive us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I won't hit you just now,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;Tell me what this
 mountain's called. How many evil spirits are there here? Tell me the
 truth and I'll forgive you your crimes.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; the two gods replied, &#8220;this mountain is called Mount
 Hairtrip. There are three have warrens in the mountain, but from remote
 antiquity there have never been any evil spirits here. This is a
 blessed land of five felicities. Great Sage, if you want to find an
 evil spirit, take the road to the Western Heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've reached the kingdom of India in the Western Heaven, where the
 king has a princess who was carried off by an evil spirit and abandoned
 in the wilds. The evil spirit turned herself into the princess's double
 to deceive the king into building a decorated tower from which she
 could throw an embroidered ball to find herself a husband. When I got
 to the foot of the tower while escorting the Tang Priest she
 deliberately hit the Tang Priest because she wanted to mate with him
 and lure his primal masculinity out of him. When I saw through her I
 turned back into myself in the palace to catch her. She threw off her
 human clothes and jewels and fought with me for half a day with a short
 club that she called a medicine-pounding pestle. Then she turned
 herself into a pure wind and disappeared. When I chased her as far as
 the Western Gate of Heaven and fought another dozen or more with her
 she realized she couldn't beat me, turned herself into golden right and
 fled here. Why didn't you see her!&#8221;</P>
<P>When the two gods heard this they led Brother Monkey to search the
 three warrens. When they first looked by the warren at the foot of the
 mountain a few frightened hares were startled and ran away. When their
 search reached the cave at the top of the mountain they saw that the
 entrance was blocked with two great boulders.</P>
<P>&#8220;The evil spirit must have gone inside,&#8221; the local god said, &#8220;when
 you were chasing her so hard.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey then pried the boulders apart with his iron cudgel. The evil
 spirit, who was indeed hiding in there, sprang out with a whoosh,
 raising her medicine pestle to strike him with. As Monkey swung his
 cudgel to parry her blow the mountain deity fell back in terror and the
 local god fled.</P>
<P>From the demon's mouth came abusive grumbles: &#8220;Who told you to bring
 him here to find me?&#8221; She continued to fend off the iron cudgel as she
 fled up into mid air in a fighting retreat.</P>
<P>Just at the moment of crisis, when it was getting late in the day,
 Monkey became more vicious than ever and his blows were even harder. He
 wished he could finish her off with a single stroke. Just then a call
 came from the ninefold azure sky of, &#8220;Don't strike, Great Sage! Don't
 strike! Be kind with your cudgel.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey turned round he saw that it was the Star Lord of the Moon
 leading his beauties and immortals down on multicolored clouds to stand
 in front of him. A flustered Monkey at once put his iron cudgel away,
 bowed and said, &#8220;Where are you going, Old Man? I'm sorry I didn't keep
 out of your way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The evil spirit fighting you is the Jade Hare who pounds the
 immortal elixir of mysterious dew in my palace,&#8221; the Moon replied. &#8220;A
 year ago she secretly opened the golden locks on the jade gates and
 absconded from the palace. As I reckoned that she would be in mortal
 peril I have come here to save her life. I do beg you, Great Sage, to
 spare her life out of consideration for me.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey assented, saying only, &#8220;I wouldn't dare harm her, I wouldn't
 dare. No wonder she's so good with a medicine-pounding pestle. She's
 the Jade Hare. What you don't know, Old Moon, is that she has kidnapped
 the king of India's daughter, made herself into the princess's double,
 and wants to ruin my master's primal masculinity although he's a holy
 monk. This is the truth. We can't stand for crimes like that. How can
 you possibly let her off so lightly?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There are things you don't know,&#8221; the Moon replied. &#8220;That king's
 daughter is no ordinary mortal. She was the White Beauty from the Moon
 Palace. Eighteen years ago she slapped the Jade Hare, after which she
 longed for the human world and came down to it in a beam of magic light
 to the womb of the king's senior queen. She was born then. The Jade
 Hare was getting her own back for that slap when she ran away from the
 palace last year and threw White Beauty into the wilds. But she was
 wrong to want to marry the Tang Priest. That's an offence she mustn't
 get away with. It was a good thing you were careful enough to see
 through her before she ruined your master. But I plead with you to
 forgive her for my sake and let me take her back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If that's why it happened,&#8221; Brother Monkey replied with a smile, &#8220;I
 wouldn't dare to make any objections. But if you take the Jade Hare
 back I'm worried that the king might not believe it, so I'd like to
 trouble you and the immortal sisters to take the Jade Hare over there
 to prove it to the king. Then I'll be able to show off my powers and
 explain how White Beauty came down to earth. I'll make the king fetch
 Princess White Beauty to prove the truth of retribution.</P>
<P>The Moon was persuaded, so he pointed at the evil spirit and shouted,
 &#8220;Repent and submit, evil beast!&#8221; The Jade Hare rolled on the ground and
 turned back into her real form. Indeed she was</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Gap-lipped and sharp-toothed,</P>
<P>Long-eared and with few whiskers.</P>
<P>Her body was covered with jade-coloured fur;</P>
<P>When she stretched out her legs she flew over mountains.</P>
<P>Her straight nose was like yogurt,</P>
<P>Glossier than face-cream with powder.</P>
<P>Two eyes glowed red,</P>
<P>Brighter than dots of rouge on the snow.</P>
<P>Crouching on the ground</P>
<P>She was a heap of pure white silk;</P>
<P>When she stretched herself out</P>
<P>She was a structure of dazzling silver wire.</P>
<P>Often did she</P>
<P>Drink in the purest dew of the heavenly dawn,</P>
<P>Pounding the elixir with her pestle of jade.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the Great Sage saw this he was delighted, and treading clouds
 and light he led the way as the Moon Lord brought all the beauties and
 immortals, taking the Jade Hare with them as they headed straight for
 India. It was now dusk, and the moon was slowly rising. When they
 reached the walls of the capital they heard the drums being beaten on
 the watch-towers. The king and the Tang Priest were still inside the
 throne hall, while Pig, Friar Sand and the officials were standing in
 front of the steps. They were just discussing whether the king should
 withdraw when a sheet of coloured cloud as bright as day was seen due
 South.</P>
<P>When they all raised their heads to look they heard the Great Sage
 Monkey shouting at the top of his voice, &#8220;Your Majesty, King of India,
 ask your queens and consorts to come out and look. Under this canopy is
 the Star Lord of the Moon Palace, and the immortal sisters to either
 side of him are the beauties of the moon. This Jade Hare was the bogus
 princess of yours who has now turned back into her real form.&#8221; The king
 then quickly called his queen, consorts, palace beauties and maids out,
 and they all kowtowed towards the sky. The king, the Tang Priest and
 the officials also bowed to the sky in thanks. There was nobody in any
 house throughout the whole city who did not set out an altar on which
 to burn incense, kowtow and recite the name of the Buddha.</P>
<P>Just when everyone was looking up Pig felt a surge of uncontrollable
 desire, leapt up into the air and flung his arms round an immortal girl
 dressed in a rainbow. &#8220;We're old Mends, darling,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Let's go
 and have a bit of fun.&#8221; Monkey went up to Pig, grabbed hold of him,
 gave him a couple of slaps and swore at him: &#8220;You village idiot. What
 sort of place is this for getting randy?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I was just going to chat her up for a bit of fun,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>The Moon Lord had his celestial canopy turned about as he took the
 Jade Hare straight back to the Moon Palace with all his beauties.
 Brother Monkey threw Pig down into the dust, then was thanked by the
 king in the throne hall.</P>
<P>When the king was told what had happened he said, &#8220;We are very
 grateful to you, holy monk, for using your great magical powers to
 capture the imitation princess. But where is our real daughter?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;She is no ordinary human either,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;but the immortal
 girl White Beauty from the Moon Palace. Because she slapped the Jade
 Hare in the face eighteen years ago she yearned for the lower world,
 came down to the womb of Your Majesty's senior queen and was born here.
 It was because the Jade Hare nursed her old grudge that she
 surreptitiously opened the golden lock on the jade gate's, came down
 here, abandoned White Beauty in the wilds and made herself look like
 White Beauty to deceive you. The Moon Lord himself told me about this
 chain of events. Today we've got rid of the imposter, and tomorrow I'll
 invite Your Majesty to go in your royal carriage to fetch the real
 one.&#8221;</P>
<P>This came as rather a shock to the king, who said with the tears
 streaming down his cheeks, &#8220;Daughter! In all the time since we came to
 the throne as a child we have never even gone outside the city gates.
 Where are we to go to look for you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No need to upset yourself,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile. &#8220;Your daughter
 is now in the Almsgiver's Spread Gold Monastery, pretending to be mad.
 Everyone can go home now. Tomorrow morning I'll bring your real
 princess back to you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please stop worrying, Your Majesty,&#8221; the officials all said,
 kowtowing. &#8220;These holy monks are all Buddhas who can ride clouds and
 mists: they are sure to know all about causes and effects in the future
 and the past. If we trouble the holy monks to come with us tomorrow to
 look for her we will learn the truth.&#8221;</P>
<P>Accepting their suggestion, the king invited the monks to the
 Lingering Spring Pavilion, where a vegetarian meal was provided and
 they were to spend the night. By now it was almost the second watch.
 Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The copper water-clock drips in the moon's bright glow;</P>
<P>The chimes of the golden bell are carried by the wind.</P>
<P>When the cuckoo sings the spring is half-way gone;</P>
<P>The blossoms fall aimlessly as the third watch draws near.</P>
<P>The swing casts a shadow in deserted royal gardens;</P>
<P>The silver river spans the sky's blue vault.</P>
<P>No travelers are to be seen in markets and streets;</P>
<P>The constellations make the night sky shine.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>That night they all went to bed, and of that no more need be said.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>During the night the king lost his demonic aura, and his spirit grew
 with great speed, so that at three marks after the fifth watch he came
 out of the inner quarters to give audience once more. When the audience
 was over he ordered that the Tang Priest and his three disciples be
 fetched to discuss the search for the princess. Sanzang then came and
 did obeisance to the king, while the Great Sage and the other two also
 paid their respects. The king bowed to them and said, &#8220;Yesterday you
 spoke of our daughter the princess. May we trouble you divine monks to
 find and rescue her?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The day before yesterday we had been walking from the East till
 evening,&#8221; the venerable elder replied, &#8220;when we saw the Almsgiver's
 Spread Gold Monastery. We went inside to ask for accommodation and had
 the good fortune to be entertained by the monks there. After supper I
 took a moonlight stroll in the former Spread Gold Garden, and as I was
 looking at the remains I heard wailing. When I asked what it was all
 about, an ancient monk, over a hundred years old, sent everyone else
 away before telling me, 'Now, about that wailing, in the late spring of
 last year I was enjoying the moon when suddenly heard a gust of wind
 and the sound of someone grieving. I got out of bed, went into the
 Jetavana and saw a girl there. When I questioned her the girl said, &#8220;I
 am a princess, the daughter of the king of India. The wind blew me here
 when I was looking at the flowers by moonlight.&#8221;' The ancient monk
 knows a lot about correct behavior, so he locked the princess up in a
 quiet, out-of-the-way cell. As he was worried that the monks of the
 monastery might sully her he put it about that he had locked up an evil
 spirit. The princess, who understood what he was doing, ranted and
 raved during the day and demanded food and tea. Only late at night,
 when there was nobody about, did she think of her mother and father and
 cry for them. The ancient monk did come to the capital to make
 enquiries several times, but when he found that the princess was well
 and in the palace he didn't dare say anything or submit a memorial.
 When the ancient monk saw that my disciple had some magic powers he
 repeatedly insisted that we were to come here to investigate. I never
 expected that she would turn out to be the Jade Hare from the Moon
 Palace who had put on an imitation of the real body and made herself
 look like the princess. She was also set on ruining my primal
 masculinity. Fortunately my disciple showed his mighty magic and
 detected the fraud. The Jade Hare has now been recaptured by the Moon
 Lord. Your worthy princess is now pretending to be crazy in the Spread
 Gold Monastery.&#8221;</P>
<P>After hearing the story in all this detail the king started to weep
 aloud. This soon alarmed the queens and consorts of the three palaces
 and six compounds, who all came out to ask why. Everybody began to weep
 bitterly, and it was a long time before the king asked, &#8220;How far is the
 Spread Gold Monastery from the city?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Only twenty miles,&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>The king then issued these commands: &#8220;Let the Queens of the Eastern
 and Western Palaces look after the court while the High Minister takes
 charge of the nation's business. We are going to the monastery with our
 Senior Queen, our officials and the four holy monks to fetch the
 princess.&#8221;</P>
<P>Carriages were at once prepared and a line of them left the palace.
 Watch as Brother Monkey sprang up into the air and with a bend of his
 back was the first to reach the monastery. The monks all hastily knelt
 to greet him.</P>
<P>&#8220;When you left, sir,&#8221; they said, &#8220;you walked with the others, so why
 did you come down from the sky today?&#8221;</P>
<P>To this Monkey replied with a smile, &#8220;Where is your ancient teacher?
 Ask him to come out straight away, and set out incense tables to
 welcome His Majesty. The king and queen of India, the officials and my
 master are all coming.&#8221; The monks could not understand what he meant,
 so they asked the ancient monk to come out.</P>
<P>When the ancient monk saw Monkey he prostrated himself before him
 with the words, &#8220;What has happened about the princess, sir?&#8221; Monkey
 told him all about how the imitation princess had thrown the
 embroidered ball, wanted to mate with the Tang Priest, been chased,
 fought, and been recaptured by the Moon Lord as the Jade Hare. The
 ancient monk kowtowed to him again in thanks.</P>
<P>&#8220;Please stop kowtowing,&#8221; said Monkey, helping him up, &#8220;please stop.
 Hurry up and get ready to receive His Majesty.&#8221; Only then did the monks
 realize that it was a girl locked up in the garden at the back.
 Surprised and delighted, they all set out a row of incense tables
 outside the monastery gates, put on their cassocks and started striking
 the bell and the drum. Soon after this the king's carriage arrived.
 Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The sky is filled with clouds of holy incense;</P>
<P>Sudden blessing comes to the monastery.</P>
<P>The rainbow flows for a thousand years; rivers and seas are pure.</P>
<P>The eternal spring round which lightning flickers is finer than those
 of Yu and Tang.</P>
<P>Thanks to the royal grace the plants' colours are finer than ever;</P>
<P>The wild flowers have extra fragrance because of this generosity.</P>
<P>Men of distinction have always left their mark behind them;</P>
<P>Today all rejoice at an enlightened king's arrival.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the king arrived outside the monastery gates the monks were all
 lined up on their knees in orderly ranks, bowing low in greeting.
 Monkey stood in the middle. &#8220;How did you arrive first, holy monk?&#8221; the
 king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;It just took a little bend of my waist for me to get here,&#8221; Monkey
 replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why were you such a long time coming?&#8221; After this the Tang Priest
 and the others all arrived. He led the royal carriage to the building
 at the back where the princess was still raving and pretending to be
 crazy.</P>
<P>The ancient monk knelt down, pointed towards her and said, &#8220;This is
 Her Royal Highness the princess who was blown here by a wind the other
 year.&#8221; The king ordered the cell opened. When the iron locks were
 undone and the door opened the king and queen saw and recognized the
 princess.</P>
<P>Not caring about the filth, they went up to her and threw their arms
 round her. &#8220;Our poor child,&#8221; they said, &#8220;how did you come to suffer
 these torments and have so terrible a time here?&#8221; How true it is that
 the meeting of parents and child is not like that of other people. The
 three of them sobbed aloud, their arms round each other's heads. When
 they had cried for a while and told each other what had happened since
 they were parted, scented hot water was sent for. The princess bathed
 and changed her clothes before they all climbed into carriages to go
 back to the capital.</P>
<P>Monkey then put his hands together in greeting to the king and said,
 &#8220;I have something else to put to you, Your Majesty.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Say it, whatever it is, holy monk,&#8221; the king said, returning his
 greeting, &#8220;and we will do as you ask.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This mountain of theirs,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;is called Mount
 Hundredfoot. They tell me that centipedes have been turning into
 spirits here recently and injuring people by night. This is very
 awkward for travelling merchants. As I see it, only chickens can deal
 with centipedes, so a thousand extra-large cockerels should be chosen
 and then scattered across the mountainside to get rid of these venomous
 insects. The mountain could be renamed and you could make a land grant
 to these monks to thank them for looking after the princess.&#8221;</P>
<P>This suggestion pleased the king greatly, and he accepted it.
 Officials were then sent back to the city to fetch cocks, while the
 mountain was renamed Mount Splendor. The Department of Works was
 instructed to provide the materials for the monastery to be rebuilt, a
 deed of enfeoffment was written describing the mountain as &#8220;Mount
 Splendor, granted to the Almsgiver's Spread Gold Monastery,&#8221; and the
 ancient monk was given the title National Benefactor Hierarch, a title
 that was to be handed on to his successors in perpetuity, together with
 a stipend of thirty-six bushels of grain. The monks all thanked the
 king for his kindness and saw him off on his way back to the capital.
 Here the princess returned to the inner palace and was greeted by all
 the ladies in turn. A banquet was then laid on to cheer the princess up
 and congratulate her on her deliverance. The queen and her daughter
 were reunited; king and ministers were together. We will not describe
 the night's feasting.</P>
<P>Early the next morning the king ordered that painters make portraits
 of the countenances of the four holy monks to be kept in the
 Sino-Barbarian Hall. The princess was also invited to come out from the
 throne hall in her new finery to thank the Tang Priest and the other
 three for saving her from her suffering. When she had thanked them the
 Tang Priest took his leave of the king to continue his journey West.
 The king refused to let them go, but ordered great banquets at which
 they feasted for five or six days. The idiot really was given a good
 time, and he enjoyed putting as much food in his stomach as he possibly
 could. When the king saw how determined they were to visit the Buddha
 he realized that no matter how hard he tried he would not be able to
 keep them. He had two hundred ingots of gold and silver brought out, as
 well as a tray of jewels for each of them as an expression of thanks.
 Master and disciples refused to accept anything. The king then ordered
 the royal carriage prepared, invited the master to enter it, and
 instructed officials to escort them a long way. The queens, consorts,
 officials and common people all kowtowed endlessly in thanks. As they
 went along the way their monks all came out to kowtow to them in
 farewell; none of them could bear to be parted from the travelers.
 Seeing that the people seeing them off were unwilling to turn back.
 Monkey had no option but to make a spell with his hands and blow a
 magic breath in the direction of the trigram of the wind, Xun, so that
 a dark wind stopped all the escorts from seeing them. Only then did the
 travelers get away. This was indeed a case of</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Washing away the waves of gratitude their natures returned to the
 end;</P>
<P>Leaving the sea of gold they were aware of true emptiness.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you do not know what happened on the journey ahead, listen to the
 explanation in the next chapter.</P>

</I>
<P>Squire Kou Entertains the Lofty Monk</P>
<P>The Tang Priest Does Not Covet Wealth and Honour</P>
</B>
<P>All kinds of matter are really without matter;</P>
<P>No emptiness is truly empty.</P>
<P>Stillness and clamour, speech and silence, all are the same:</P>
<P>Why bother to dream-talk in one's dreams?</P>
<P>The useful includes the useless in its application;</P>
<P>Achievement lurks within failure.</P>
<P>When the fruit is ripe it reddens of itself;</P>
<P>Do not ask how the seed is to be grown.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story has told how the Tang Priest and his disciples used their
 magic powers to stop the monks of the Spread Gold Monastery. When the
 monks saw after the black wind had passed that the master and his
 disciples had disappeared they thought that their visitors must have
 been living Buddhas come down to earth, so they kowtowed and went back.
 Of them we tell no more. As master and disciples traveled West spring
 was giving way to early summer:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The air was clear, mild and refreshing;</P>
<P>Water chestnuts and lotuses were growing in the pool.</P>
<P>Plums were ripening after the rain;</P>
<P>The wheat was forming as the breezes blew.</P>
<P>Flowers were fragrant where blossoms fell from trees;</P>
<P>The oriole grew tired amid the willow's light branches.</P>
<P>Swallows over the river taught their young to fly;</P>
<P>The pheasants fed their chirping chicks.</P>
<P>South of the Dipper the sun was always seen;</P>
<P>All of creation shone with brightness.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We could never describe in full how they ate at dawn, found shelter
 at dusk, rounded ravines and climbed hills as they went along their way
 without incident for a fortnight. Then another city wall appeared in
 front of them. As they came closer to it Sanzang asked, &#8220;What sort of
 place is this, disciple?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I don't know,&#8221; Brother Monkey replied, &#8220;I don't know.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've been this way before,&#8221; put in Pig, &#8220;so how can you claim that
 you don't know? I suppose you're being crafty and just pretending you
 can't recognize the place to make fools of us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're being completely unreasonable, you idiot,&#8221; said Monkey.
 &#8220;Although I've been this way several times I've always come and gone by
 cloud high up in the sky. I've never landed here. I had no interest in
 the place, so why should I have looked it over? That's why I didn't
 know. I'm not being crafty, and not trying to make a fool of you
 either.&#8221;</P>
<P>While they were talking they came close to the city before they
 realized it. Sanzang dismounted, crossed the drawbridge and went
 straight in through the gates. As they went along the main street there
 were two old men to be seen sitting under a portico and talking.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciples,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;stand here in the middle of the road,
 keep your heads bowed and don't run wild. I am going under that portico
 to ask where we are.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey and the others stood still as they had been told while the
 venerable elder went up to the two men, put his hands together and
 called out, &#8220;Greetings, benefactors.&#8221; The two old men were idly
 chatting about such things as prosperity and decay, success and
 failure, sages and good men, their heroic deeds in ancient times, and
 where such men were now. Really, they said, it was enough to make you
 sigh.</P>
<P>When they suddenly heard Sanzang's greeting they returned it and
 asked, &#8220;What do you have to say to us, reverend sir?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am a monk who has come from far away to worship the Lord Buddha,&#8221;
 Sanzang replied, &#8220;and I have just arrived here. I wonder what this
 place is called, and where there are any pious folk from whom I might
 beg a meal.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is the prefecture of Brazentower,&#8221; one of the old men said,
 &#8220;and this is the county of Diling near Brazentower city. If you want
 vegetarian food, reverend sir, you won't need to beg. Go past this
 archway to the street running North-south. There's a gate-tower shaped
 like a sitting tiger facing the East, and that's Squire Kou's house. In
 front of it is a sign that says 'All monks welcome'. A monk from far
 away such as yourself will be given all you want. Off you go, and stop
 interrupting our conversation.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang thanked them, turned to Monkey and said, &#8220;This is Diling
 county in the prefecture of Brazentower. The two old men said that on
 the street running North-south past this archway there is a gate-tower
 shaped like a sitting tiger that is Squire Kou's house. In front of it
 is a sign that says 'All monks welcome'. They told me to go there for a
 vegetarian meal.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The West is a land of Buddhists,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;and they really
 do feed monks. As this is only a seat of local government we don't need
 to present our passport. Let's go and beg ourselves a meal; that'll be
 all the better for travelling with.&#8221; The master and his three disciples
 walked slowly along the main street, filling all the people in the
 market with alarm and suspicion as they crowded around, struggling to
 see what the strangers looked like.</P>
<P>Sanzang told his disciples to keep their mouths shut, saying, &#8220;Behave
 yourselves! Behave yourselves!&#8221; The three of them kept their heads
 bowed, not daring to look up. Then they turned a corner and did indeed
 see a main road running North-south.</P>
<P>As they were walking along it they saw a gate-tower like a sitting
 tiger. On a screen wall inside the gateway hung a great sign on which
 were written the words &#8220;All monks welcome.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The West is indeed the land of the Buddha,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;Nobody,
 however clever or stupid, is dishonest. I did not believe what the two
 old men told me. Now I know it is just as they said.&#8221; Being the boor
 that he was, Pig wanted to go straight in.</P>
<P>&#8220;Just a moment, idiot,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Wait till someone comes out so
 we can ask what to do before we go in.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Big brother's right,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;If we don't show respect for
 his privacy we might irritate the benefactor.&#8221; They let the horse rest
 and put down the luggage outside the gates. A little later a slave came
 out with a steelyard and a basket in his hands that the sudden sight of
 the strangers made him drop in alarm.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; he reported, running inside, &#8220;here are four strange-looking
 monks outside.&#8221; At the time the gentleman was walking with a stick in
 the inner courtyard, reciting the name of the Buddha. When he heard the
 report he dropped his stick and went out to welcome them. Their
 ugliness did not frighten him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Come in, come in,&#8221; he said. Behaving with all courtesy, Sanzang went
 inside with him.</P>
<P>The gentleman led them along a passageway and into a house, where he
 said, &#8220;The upper building includes a Buddha hall, a surra library and a
 refectory for you gentlemen. The lower building is where your
 disciple's family lives.&#8221; Sanzang expressed endless admiration. He
 brought out and put on his cassock to worship the Buddha, then went up
 into the hall to have a look. What he saw was:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Clouds of incense,</P>
<P>Dazzling candles.</P>
<P>The-ball was filled with a brocade of flowers;</P>
<P>All around was gold and many colours.</P>
<P>From red frames</P>
<P>Hung a bell of purple gold;</P>
<P>On a lacquered stand</P>
<P>Was set a matching decorated drum.</P>
<P>Several pairs of banners</P>
<P>Were embroidered with the eight treasures;</P>
<P>A thousand Buddha statues</P>
<P>Were all covered in gold.</P>
<P>Ancient bronze incense-burners,</P>
<P>Ancient bronze vases,</P>
<P>Carved lacquer tables,</P>
<P>Carved lacquer boxes.</P>
<P>In the ancient bronze incense-burners</P>
<P>Was always eaglewood incense;</P>
<P>In the ancient bronze vases</P>
<P>Were the colours of lotus blossoms.</P>
<P>On the carved lacquer tables</P>
<P>Were fresh fruits;</P>
<P>In the carved lacquer boxes</P>
<P>Fragrant petals were piled.</P>
<P>In glass bowls</P>
<P>Was pure, clear water;</P>
<P>In crystal lamps</P>
<P>The fragrant oil shone bright.</P>
<P>A metal chime</P>
<P>Resounded long and slow.</P>
<P>This was like a treasure house untouched by the world,</P>
<P>A family Buddha hall rivaling a monastery.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The venerable elder washed his hands, took a pinch of incense,
 kowtowed and worshipped, then turned back to greet the gentleman.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wait a moment,&#8221; Mr. Kou replied. &#8220;Let us make our introductions in
 the sutra library.&#8221; What they saw there was:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A square stand and upright cupboards,</P>
<P>Jade boxes and golden caskets.</P>
<P>On the square stand and in the upright cupboards</P>
<P>Were piled up countless scriptures;</P>
<P>In the jade boxes and golden caskets</P>
<P>Were stored many a manuscript.</P>
<P>On lacquered tables</P>
<P>Were paper, ink, brushes and inkstones,</P>
<P>All the finest treasures of the study.</P>
<P>Before the scented screen</P>
<P>Were calligraphy, paintings, a lute and chess,</P>
<P>All for the most refined of interests.</P>
<P>A magic chime of light jade covered with gold,</P>
<P>And a copper tripod in the wind and under the moon.</P>
<P>The clear breeze freshens the spirit;</P>
<P>The purified heart is aware; the mind set on the Way is at ease.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the venerable elder had reached the library and was going to bow
 to him Mr. Kou held on to prevent this and said, &#8220;Won't you take off
 your cassock?&#8221; Sanzang then took off his cassock, after which he
 greeted Mr. Kou. He then told Monkey and the other two to greet him
 too. Orders were given for the horse to be fed and the luggage put in a
 corridor. The gentleman asked about their background.</P>
<P>&#8220;I have been sent by the emperor of Great Tang in the East,&#8221; Sanzang
 said, &#8220;to the Vulture Peak in your splendid country to see the Lord
 Buddha and ask for the true scriptures. I am here to request a meal
 because I have heard that in your distinguished household you honour
 monks. After that we will be on our way.&#8221;</P>
<P>The gentleman's face was suffused with pleasure as he replied with a
 chuckle, &#8220;My name is Kou Hong, my other name is Kou Dakuan, and I have
 lived for sixty-four wasted years. When I was forty I made a vow to
 feed ten thousand monks, and you will complete the number. In the
 twenty-four years during which I have been feeding monks I have kept a
 record of their names. Having nothing else to do in recent days I have
 counted the names of all the monks I've fed, and the score is now
 9,996. I was only short of four to make up the full number. Then today
 heaven has you four teachers down to me to complete the ten thousand.
 Will you be so good as to tell me your names? I hope that you will stay
 for a month or more until I have celebrated the completion, after which
 I will send you teachers up the mountain in carrying-chairs or on
 horses. Vulture Peak is only some 250 miles from here, not at all far
 away.&#8221; Sanzang was thoroughly delighted to hear this, and he agreed to
 it all at once.</P>
<P>Several young and old servants fetched firewood, drew water, and
 brought rice, flour and vegetables into the house with which to prepare
 them a meal. All this disturbed the gentleman's wife, who said, &#8220;Where
 have these monks come from, and why is everyone so busy?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Four eminent monks have just arrived,&#8221; the servants told her, &#8220;and
 when the master asked them where they were from they said they'd been
 sent by the emperor of the Great Tang in the East to go to worship the
 Lord Buddha on Vulture Peak. Goodness only knows how far it is to here
 from there. The master said that they had been sent down from heaven
 and told us to get them a vegetarian meal quickly.&#8221;</P>
<P>The old woman was also very pleased to hear this, so she told a maid
 to fetch her clothes so that she too could go to see them. &#8220;Only one of
 them is handsome, ma'am,&#8221; the servant said. &#8220;The other three don't bear
 looking at. They're really hideous.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What you people don't realize,&#8221; the old woman replied, &#8220;is that if
 they look ugly, strange and freakish they must be heavenly beings come
 down to earth. Hurry and tell your master straight away.&#8221;</P>
<P>The servant ran straight to the surra hall, where he said to the
 gentleman, &#8220;The old lady's here to pay her respects to the lords from
 the East.&#8221; On hearing this Sanzang rose from his seat. Before the words
 had all been spoken the old woman was already before the hall, where
 she lifted her eyes to see the Tang Priest's majestic countenance and
 his splendid bearing. When she turned to see the extraordinary
 appearance of Monkey and the other two she was somewhat alarmed even
 though she knew they were heavenly beings come down to earth; she fell
 to her knees and bowed.</P>
<P>Sanzang quickly returned her courtesy, saying, &#8220;Bodhisattva, the
 honour you do me is undeserved.&#8221; The old woman then asked her husband
 why the four reverend gentlemen were not all sitting together.</P>
<P>&#8220;We three are disciples,&#8221; said Pig, thrusting his snout forward.
 Goodness! His voice was like the roar of a tiger deep in the mountains.
 The old woman was terrified.</P>
<P>As they were talking another servant appeared to announce, &#8220;The two
 young masters are here too.&#8221; When Sanzang turned quickly round to look
 he saw that they were two young scholars, who prostrated themselves to
 the venerable elder after walking into the sutra hall. Sanzang was
 quick to return their courtesy. Mr. Kou then came up to take hold of
 him and say, &#8220;These are my two sons. Their names are Kou Liang and Kou
 Dong. They have just come back from their school and have not yet had
 their lunch. They are here to pay their respects because they have
 heard that you teachers have come down to earth.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What fine sons,&#8221; said Sanzang with delight, &#8220;what fine sons. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you want to make a lofty match you must do good:</P>
<P>The success of your sons and grandsons depends on study.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The two scholars then asked their father, &#8220;Where have these lords
 come from?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;From a long way away,&#8221; Mr. Kou replied with a smile. &#8220;The emperor of
 Great Tang in the East of the Southern Continent of Jambu has sent them
 to Vulture Peak to worship the Lord Buddha and fetch the scriptures.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We have read in the<I> Compendious Forest of Facts</I> that there
 are four continents in the world,&#8221; the scholars said. &#8220;This continent
 of ours is the Western Continent of Cattle-gift. There is also an
 Eastern Continent of Superior Body. How many years did it take you to
 get here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have been a long time on the journey,&#8221; Sanzang replied with a
 smile, &#8220;met many vicious demons and monsters, and suffered greatly. I
 have been greatly indebted to my three disciples for their protection.
 Altogether it has taken me fourteen winters and summers to reach your
 splendid country.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the scholars heard this they said with unbounded admiration,
 &#8220;You really are holy monks, you really are.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before they had finished speaking a servant came in to invite them to
 eat: &#8220;The vegetarian banquet has been set out, so will you eat, my
 lords?&#8221; The gentleman then sent his wife and sons back to the house,
 while he went with the four monks into the refectory for the meal.
 Everything was set out very neatly. There were gold-lacquered tables
 and black-lacquered chairs. In front were fine cakes of many colours
 that skilled chefs had made up in up-to-date styles. The second row
 contained five dishes of hors-d'oeuvres, in the third row there were
 five dishes of fruit, and in the fourth were five large dishes of
 snacks. Everything tasted good, looked good and smelt good. Vegetable
 soup, rice and steamed breadrolls were all spicy, piping hot, and most
 delicious. There was plenty to fill one's stomach. Seven or eight
 servants rushed around waiting on them, while four of five cooks were
 kept constantly busy. Just watch while some poured soup and others
 filled the rice bowls, coming and going like shooting stars chasing the
 moon. Pig was finishing up bowls in single mouthfuls, like a gale
 blowing the clouds away. Thus master and disciples ate their fill.
 Sanzang then rose to thank Mr. Kou for the meal before setting out
 again.</P>
<P>The gentleman blocked his way saying, &#8220;Teacher, won't you take things
 easy and spend a few days here? As the saying goes, it's nothing to
 start a journey but it's hard to end one. I will send you on your way
 when we have celebrated the completion of my vow.&#8221; Seeing how sincere
 and determined he was, Sanzang had no option but to stay.</P>
<P>Five to seven days quickly passed before Mr. Kou engaged twenty-four
 local Buddhist monks to perform a mass to celebrate the fulfillment of
 the vow. The monks spent three or four days writing texts out and chose
 a lucky day on which to begin the Buddhist service. The way they did it
 was like in the Great Tang. There was</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A great display of banners,</P>
<P>Where the golden countenance was set out;</P>
<P>Rows of candles</P>
<P>And incense burnt in offering.</P>
<P>Drums and gongs were beaten,</P>
<P>Pipes and shawms were played.</P>
<P>Cloud-cymbals,</P>
<P>Pure-toned flutes,</P>
<P>Sounded in tune;</P>
<P>To the beat of the drum,</P>
<P>And the woodwind's notes,</P>
<P>The words of sutras were recited in unison.</P>
<P>First the local god was put at ease,</P>
<P>Then spirit generals were invited to come.</P>
<P>The documents were sent out,</P>
<P>And they bowed low to the Buddha statues,</P>
<P>Reciting the Peacock Sutra,</P>
<P>Each word of which could sweep away disasters,</P>
<P>A stand of lamps was lit for Bhaisajya-guru,</P>
<P>To shine with flames of dazzling brightness.</P>
<P>They performed the Water Ceremony</P>
<P>To end any sense of grievance.</P>
<P>Then they intoned the Avatamsaka Sutra</P>
<P>To do away with slander.</P>
<P>The Three Vehicles of the Wonderful Law are very fine:</P>
<P>Different monks are all the same.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The mass lasted for three days and nights before it ended. In his
 longing to go to the Thunder Monastery the Tang Priest was determined
 to be on his way, so he took his leave of them and thanked them.</P>
<P>&#8220;Teacher, you are very eager to say good-bye,&#8221; Mr. Kou said. &#8220;I
 suppose you must have taken offence because for days on end we have
 been so busy with our service that we have treated you very
 offhandedly.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We have put your noble house to a great deal of trouble,&#8221; Sanzang
 replied, &#8220;and I do not know how we will ever repay you. How could we
 possibly have taken offence? But when my wise monarch saw me off
 through the passes all those years ago he asked me when I would be
 back. I wrongly told him that I would return in three years, never
 imagining that the journey would be so badly delayed that it has
 already lasted fourteen years. I do not even know whether I will
 succeed in fetching the scriptures, and it will take me another twelve
 or thirteen years to get back. How am I to face the penalty for
 breaking my monarch's sage command? I beg you, sir, to let me go to
 fetch the scriptures and return. Next time I come to your mansion I
 will be able to stay much longer.&#8221;</P>
<P>This was more than Pig could bear. &#8220;You don't care at all about what
 we want, Master,&#8221; he shouted at the top of his voice. &#8220;You're showing
 no consideration at all. The old gentleman's very rich, and now he's
 fulfilled his vow to feed monks. Besides, he's really sincere about
 wanting to keep us here. It'd do no harm if we stayed here for a year
 or so. Why be so set on going? Why leave all this good food to go
 begging for meals elsewhere? Is it your parents' home ahead?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;All you care about is food, you cretin,&#8221; shouted Sanzang angrily.
 &#8220;You don't care at all about the transference of cause and effect.
 Really, you're such an animal you'd eat from the trough to scratch the
 itch in your belly. If you people are going to be so greedy and stupid
 I'll go by myself tomorrow.&#8221;</P>
<P>Seeing that the master's attitude had changed, Monkey grabbed hold of
 Pig and punched his head. &#8220;You've got no sense, you idiot,&#8221; he said
 abusively. &#8220;You've made the master angry with us too.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He deserved that,&#8221; said Friar Sand with a grin, &#8220;he deserved that.
 He's disgusting enough even if he doesn't say a word, but he would have
 to interrupt.&#8221; Breathing heavily, the idiot stood to one side, not
 daring to say another word.</P>
<P>Seeing the anger of master and disciple, Mr. Kou said, his face
 wreathed in smiles, &#8220;Do not be so short-tempered, teacher. Make
 yourself comfortable for the rest of the day. Tomorrow I will have
 banners and drums brought here and ask some relations and neighbors to
 come to see you off.&#8221;</P>
<P>As they were talking the old woman come out again to say. &#8220;Venerable
 teacher, as you have come to our house you should not refuse too
 insistently. How many days have you spent here now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It is already a fortnight,&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;That fortnight is my gentleman's achievement,&#8221; the old woman said.
 &#8220;I have a little pin-money with which I would like to entertain you
 gentlemen for another fortnight.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before she had finished speaking Kou Dong and his brother came out
 again to say, &#8220;Your four lordships, in the twenty and more years during
 which our father has been feeding monks he has never met better ones
 than yourselves. Now that by your gracious condescension you have made
 up the total you really have brought glory to our thatched hovel. We
 two are too young to understand about cause and effect, but we have
 often heard it said,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The husband gets what he has merited,</P>
<P>The wife gets what she has merited;</P>
<P>Nothing is got when nothing is merited.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Our father and mother each want to make a humble offering in order
 that each of them may merit a reward, so why must you refuse so
 insistently? And as we two brothers have saved a little of our school
 fees we hope to be allowed to support you gentlemen for another
 fortnight before seeing you on your way.</P>
<P>&#8220;I dare not accept even the lavish hospitality of the venerable
 Bodhisattva your mother,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;so how could I accept you
 brothers' generosity? I could not possibly do so. I really must set out
 today. Please, please do not take offence. If I do not go now I will be
 unable to avoid execution for exceeding my emperor's time-limit by so
 long.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the old woman and her two sons realized that Sanzang was
 determined not to stay they started losing their patience.</P>
<P>&#8220;We invite you very nicely to stay,&#8221; they said, &#8220;but you're
 obstinately set on going. If you're going, go, and cut out this
 chatter.&#8221; Mother and sons then left to go back to the house. Pig could
 hold his tongue no longer.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; he said to the Tang Priest, &#8220;don't overdo it. As the saying
 goes, 'If you can stay, don't go away.' Let's stay here for another
 month to let the mother and her sons fulfil their wishes. Why do you
 have to be in such a rush?&#8221; The Tang Priest made another angry noise at
 him and shouted again.</P>
<P>The idiot then slapped his own face twice, saying, &#8220;Tut, tut, tut.
 Don't talk out of turn. You spoke again.&#8221; Brother Monkey and Friar
 Sand, who were standing to one side, started spluttering with laughter.
 The Tang Priest was angry with Monkey again.</P>
<P>&#8220;What are you laughing at?&#8221; he asked, and made the hand magic, ready
 to recite the Band-tightening Spell.</P>
<P>This so terrified Monkey that he fell to his knees at once and said,
 &#8220;I didn't laugh, Master. Whatever you do, don't say the spell! Don't
 say it!&#8221;</P>
<P>Seeing that master and disciples were getting into a worse and worse
 temper with each other Mr. Kou gave up his insistence on their staying.
 &#8220;Don't quarrel, teachers,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I'll definitely see you on your
 way tomorrow morning.&#8221; He then left the sutra hall and told his
 secretary to write a hundred or so invitations to his neighbors and
 relations to see the Tang Priest off to the West early the next
 morning. He told the cooks to lay on a parting banquet, while also
 instructing his steward to have twenty pairs of coloured flags made,
 hire a band of musicians, and engage a group of Buddhist monks from the
 Monastery from the South and another group of Taoist priests from the
 Eastern Peak Temple. Everything was to be ready and in order by ten in
 the morning. All the gentleman's staff went off to carry out their
 orders. Soon it was evening again, and after supper everyone went to
 bed. It was the time when</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Dots of homegoing rooks pass the lonely village;</P>
<P>Drum and bell can be heard from each other's distant towers.</P>
<P>In streets and markets the bustle is stilled;</P>
<P>In all the houses the lamps shine dimly.</P>
<P>Flowers in the breeze throw shadows under the moon;</P>
<P>The stars shine bright against the Milky Way.</P>
<P>Where the cuckoo sings the night seems deeper;</P>
<P>All natural sounds are stilled across the earth.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>During the third and fourth watches of the night all the household
 servants in charge of various matters got up early to attend to their
 tasks. Just watch. The cooks preparing the banquet were busy in the
 kitchen. The people who had to buy coloured flags were bustling in
 front of the hall. Those engaging Buddhist and Taoist clergy were
 hurrying about as fast as their legs could carry them. Those hiring
 musicians were in a great rush. The messengers delivering invitations
 ran all over the place, while the servants preparing the
 carrying-chairs and horses were calling to each other. They were all
 shouting from the middle of the night until dawn, and by around ten
 o'clock everything was prepared. This was all because the family was
 rich.</P>
<P>The story tells how the Tang Priest and his disciples got up early to
 be waited on once more by that crowd of servants. The venerable elder
 told them to pack the baggage and saddle the horse. When the idiot
 heard that they were about to go he pulled a face, pouted and grumbled,
 but he still had to pack the clothes and begging bowls then go to look
 for the carrying pole. Friar Sand brushed the horse, saddled and
 harnessed it, and stood waiting. Brother Monkey put the nine-ringed
 monastic staff in his master's hand and hung the passport in a bag in
 front of his chest. They were now all ready to set out. Mr. Kou then
 invited them into the large hall at the back, where a feast was set out
 that excelled even the one they had eaten in the refectory.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Curtains hung from on high;</P>
<P>Screens stood all around.</P>
<P>In the middle was a picture:</P>
<P>A mountain of long life and a sea of blessings.</P>
<P>On both walls were displayed.</P>
<P>Scrolls of spring, summer, autumn and winter.</P>
<P>From the dragon-patterned tripod came clouds of incense;</P>
<P>Above magpie-tailed burners rose auspicious vapors.</P>
<P>In bowls were bunches of color,</P>
<P>Fresh and brilliant flowers of splendid form.</P>
<P>The tables were piled with gold:</P>
<P>Lines of confections shaped like lions and immortals.</P>
<P>Music and dancing before the steps were in true harmony;</P>
<P>The dishes in the hall were like a brocade.</P>
<P>Exquisite soup and rice, both free of meat;</P>
<P>The finest tea and the best of wines.</P>
<P>Although they were only commoners</P>
<P>Their home was fine enough for a prince.</P>
<P>All that could be heard were happy sounds</P>
<P>So loud they surprised the sky and shook the earth.</P>
<P>The venerable elder was just exchanging courtesies with Mr. Kou when
 a servant came in to report, &#8220;The guests are all here.&#8221; These were the
 people who had been invited&#8212;neighbors, relations by marriage, and some
 of his pious friends who also fed monks and recited the name of the
 Buddha&#8212;and all of them bowed to the venerable elder. After the
 greetings had been made everyone sat down. Outside the hall zithers and
 panpipes were played, while inside the hall pipas and songs accompanied
 the banquet. Pig paid great attention to this rich banquet.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; he said to Friar Sand, &#8220;relax and eat as much as you can.
 There won't be anything as good as this to eat after we leave the Kou
 house.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; Friar Sand replied with a laugh. &#8220;As the saying goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>No matter how splendid the banquet you eat,</P>
<P>For only a while can it keep you replete.</P>
<P>Your savings may meet the expense of the road,</P>
<P>But savings can never in bellies be stowed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're hopeless,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;hopeless. If I eat my fill today I
 won't feel hungry for the next three days.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Idiot,&#8221; said Monkey, who had heard this. &#8220;Don't fill your belly till
 it bursts. We've got to start walking now.&#8221;</P>
<P>They were still talking, and it was almost noon when Sanzang raised
 his chopsticks and said grace. Pig grabbed a bowl, filled it with
 desperate speed, and ate five or six bowlfuls in succession, gulping
 down a whole bowlful at a time. Without any qualms at all he filled
 both his sleeves with steamed bread, twists, pancakes and cooked dishes
 before rising with his master. Sanzang thanked the gentleman and
 everyone else, then they all went outside together. Just look at the
 coloured banners, splendid canopies, drummers and instrumentalists
 outside. Only then did two groups of clergy, one Buddhist and one
 Taoist, arrive.</P>
<P>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; said Mr. Kou, &#8220;you are late. Our teacher is in a hurry
 to leave, so I will not be able to offer you a meal. I'll show you my
 gratitude when we come back.&#8221; Everyone then opened a way to let them
 through, the carriers carrying their chairs, the riders on their horses
 and the walkers on foot all let Sanzang and his three disciples go
 first. The heavens rang with drumming and music, the flags and banner
 blotted out the sun, crowds pressed around, and carriages and horses
 were all packed close together as everyone came to watch Mr. Kou seeing
 the Tang Priest off. The splendor all around was more magnificent than
 pearls or jade, and no less fine than brocade screens behind which
 spring lies hidden.</P>
<P>The Buddhist monks playing Buddhist tunes and the Taoist priests
 their Taoist airs all escorted the travelers out of the prefecture.
 When they reached the three-mile pavilion, baskets of food and jars of
 drink were set out, cups were raised, and they all drank parting
 toasts.</P>
<P>Mr. Kou, loath to let them go, said as he choked back his tears,
 &#8220;Teacher, you must spend some more days with us on your way back with
 the scriptures to fulfil my longing.&#8221; Overcome with gratitude, Sanzang
 thanked him at great length.</P>
<P>&#8220;If I reach Vulture Peak,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and see the Lord Buddha the
 first thing I will do will be to praise your great virtue. We will
 certainly come to kowtow to you in thanks on our return journey.&#8221; As
 they talked they covered another mile or so without noticing it. Then
 the venerable elder insisted on taking his leave, at which Mr. Kou
 turned back, sobbing aloud. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He who had vowed to feed the clergy found enlightenment:</P>
<P>He was not fated to see the Tathagata Buddha.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We will tell not of how Mr. Kou went home with everyone after seeing
 the travelers off as far as the three-mile pavilion, but of how the
 master and his three disciples went on for some twelve or fifteen
 miles. By now it was growing dark.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's late,&#8221; Sanzang said. &#8220;Where are we to spend the night?&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig, who was carrying the pole, pulled a face and said, &#8220;You would
 have to leave ready-cooked meals behind and refuse to stay in a nice
 cool brick house so as to go wherever it is we're going. That's just
 asking for trouble. It's very late now. What'll we do if it starts
 raining?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Evil, insolent beast,&#8221; cursed Sanzang, &#8220;complaining again. As the
 saying goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The capital may be remarkably fine,</P>
<P>But we can't linger here for a very long time.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If we are fated to visit the Lord Buddha, fetch the true scriptures,
 go back to Great Tang and report to the emperor I will let you eat in
 the imperial kitchens for years on end. Then, you evil beast, you will
 swell up till you burst. That will teach you to be such a greedy
 devil.&#8221; The idiot chortled quietly to himself, but did not dare say
 another word.</P>
<P>When Brother Monkey raised his eyes to look around he saw some
 buildings beside the road and asked his master urgently, &#8220;Can we spend
 the night here? Can we?&#8221; Sanzang went over to the place, where he saw a
 ruined memorial arch on which was inscribed</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>THE VIHARA OF PADMAPRABHA</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;The Bodhisattva Padmaprabha was a disciple of the Buddha Sikhin,&#8221;
 said Sanzang, dismounting. &#8220;He was dismissed for eliminating the Demon
 King of Poison Fire and turned into the Spirit Officer of the Five
 Manifests. There must be a shrine here.&#8221; They then all went in
 together. The cloisters had all collapsed, the walls had fallen down,
 and there was no trace of anybody around, only of vegetation running
 wild. They would have gone out again, but the sky had filled with dark
 clouds and it had started to pour with rain. There was nothing for it
 but to find a place in the ruins where they could shelter from the
 storm. They kept completely silent, not daring to speak aloud for fear
 that some evil demon might hear them. Thus it was that they endured a
 sleepless night sitting or standing there. Oh dear! How true it is that</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Disaster strikes at triumph's height;</P>
<P>In time of joy comes sorrow's blight.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know what happened when they carried on with their
 journey, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

</I>
<P>The Monks and Their Supporters Meet With Demonic Attack</P>
<P>The Sage Makes the Spirit Reappear to Save the Primal One</P>
</B>
<P>We will tell not of how the Tang Priest and the others endured a hard
 night in the dilapidated palace of Padmaprabha, but of a group of evil
 villains in Diling county in the prefecture of Brazentower who had
 squandered all their families' fortunes in whoring, drinking and
 gambling. Having nothing else left to live on they had formed a
 criminal gang of a dozen and more members and were discussing which
 family was the richest in the city and which the second richest. The
 idea was to rob them of their gold and silver and thus get some money
 to spend.</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no need to go round making enquiries,&#8221; one of them said, &#8220;or
 work it out in detail. The Mr. Kou who saw the Tang monk off today is
 rolling in money. Let's strike tonight in the rain. There'll be nobody
 ready for us in the streets and the fire wardens won't be patrolling.
 When we've stolen his property we'll be able to go with the girls,
 gamble and have a good time again. That would be great, wouldn't it?&#8221;</P>
<P>The other robbers were all delighted with the suggestion, and with
 one heart they all set out in the rain carrying daggers, spiked clubs,
 sticks, coshes, ropes and torches. Flinging open the main gates of the
 Kou house they charged inside, shouting and sending everyone inside,
 young and old, male and female, scurrying into hiding. The old woman
 hid under the bed and the old man slipped behind the gates, while Kou
 Liang, Kou Dong and their families fled for their lives in all
 directions. Holding their knives in their hands and lighting torches,
 the bandits opened up all the chests in the house and grabbed as much
 of the gold, silver, jewelry, hair ornaments, clothing, vessels and
 other household goods as they wanted. Mr. Kou could not bear to lose
 all this, so taking his life in his hands he come out from behind the
 gate to plead with the robbers.</P>
<P>&#8220;Take as much as you want, great kings,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but please leave
 me a few clothes to be buried in.&#8221; The robbers were in no mood for
 argument. They rushed up to him, tripped and kicked him to the ground.
 Alas,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>His three souls vanished to the underworld;</P>
<P>His seven spirits left the world of men.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The successful robbers left the Kou house, put up a rope ladder from
 the foot of the city wall, took it in turns to cross and fled Westwards
 in the rain. Only when they saw that the robbers had gone did the
 servants of the Kou family dare show their heads again. When they
 looked for old Mr. Kou and found him lying dead on the floor they
 started weeping aloud. &#8220;Heavens! The master's been murdered!&#8221; they all
 said as they wept, embracing the body and sobbing in misery.</P>
<P>When it was almost the fourth watch the resentful Mrs. Kou, who was
 angry with the Tang Priest and his followers for rejecting their
 hospitality, and also because the extravagance of their send-off had
 provoked this disaster, decided to ruin the four of them. Helping Kou
 Liang to his feet, she said, &#8220;Don't cry, my son. Your father fed monks
 day in and day out. Who ever would have thought that he would complete
 the number by feeding a gang of monks who'd murder him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; the brothers asked, &#8220;how did those monks murder him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Those bandits were so bold and vicious that when they charged in I
 hid under the bed,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;Although I was trembling I made sure
 to take a very good look at them by the light of the torches. Do you
 know who they were? The Tang Priest was lighting torches, Pig was
 holding a knife, Friar Sand was taking the gold and silver, and Monkey
 killed your father.&#8221; The two sons believed all this.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you saw all that clearly, mother,&#8221; they said, &#8220;you must be right.
 They spent a fortnight in our house, so they knew all the doors, walls,
 windows and passageways. They must have been tempted by our wealth and
 come back here under cover of rain and darkness. How evil! They've
 stolen our property and murdered our father. Once it's light we'll go
 to the local government and report them as wanted men.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What sort of wanted notice should we write?&#8221; Kou Dong asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;We'll write what our mother said,&#8221; Kou Liang replied, and he wrote:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Tang Priest lit the torches, Pig incited to murder, Friar Sand
 stole the gold and silver and Sun the Novice murdered our father.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The whole household was in such a hubbub that before they noticed it
 day had dawned. While invitations were sent out to their relatives and
 a coffin was ordered Kou Liang and his brother went to the local
 government offices to deposit their complaint. Now the prefect of
 Brazentower:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Had always been upright,</P>
<P>Was good by nature.</P>
<P>As a boy he had studied by the light of the snow;</P>
<P>When young he had taken the palace examinations.</P>
<P>His heart was always set on loyalty and justice,</P>
<P>And filled with thoughts of kindness and benevolence.</P>
<P>His name would be transmitted in annals for a thousand years,</P>
<P>Like a Gong Sui or Huang Ba come back to life;</P>
<P>His fame would resound for ten thousand ages in the balls of office,</P>
<P>Zhuo Mao and Lu Gong reborn.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When he had taken his seat in the hall and declared that all matters
 could be dealt with, he ordered that the placard asking for plaints
 should be carried outside. Kou Liang and his brother then came in
 holding the placard, knelt down and called aloud, &#8220;Your Honour, we have
 come to denounce some bandits as thieves and murderers.&#8221; The prefect
 accepted their complaint and read what it had to say.</P>
<P>&#8220;I was told yesterday that your family completed your vow of feeding
 monks,&#8221; the prefect said, &#8220;by feeding four distinguished ones, arhats
 from the Tang Dynasty in the East. You made a great display of sending
 them off with drums and music. So how could such a thing as this have
 possibly happened?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Honour,&#8221; said Kou Liang, kowtowing, &#8220;our father Kou Hong had
 been feeding monks for twenty-four years. These four monks who had come
 from afar just happened to make up the ten thousand, which was why he
 held a service to mark the completion and kept them there for a
 fortnight. They got to know all the passageways, doors and windows.
 They were seen off during the day and came back yesterday evening.
 During the dark and stormy night they charged into the house with
 torches and weapons to steal our gold, silver, jewelry, clothes and
 hair ornaments. They beat our father to death and left him lying on the
 ground. We beg you to be our protector.&#8221; On hearing this the prefect
 mustered infantry, cavalry and able-bodied civilian conscripts, 150 men
 in all, who rushed straight out of the Western gate carrying sharp
 weapons in pursuit of the Tang Priest and his three disciples.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story now tells how master and disciples stayed in the ruins of
 the minor palace of padmaprabha until dawn, when they went out and
 started hurrying Westwards. The bandits, who had gone along the main
 road West all night till daybreak after robbing the Kou family and
 leaving the city, had passed the palace of Padmaprabha and hidden in
 the mountains some six or seven miles to the West. Here they were just
 dividing up the gold and silver when the Tang Priest and his three
 followers came into view, also heading West along the road.</P>
<P>The bandits, whose greed was not yet sated, pointed at the Tang
 Priest and said, &#8220;Look! Aren't they the monks who were seen off
 yesterday?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;And a very welcome arrival too,&#8221; said the other bandits, laughing,
 &#8220;Let's do a bit more of our dirty business. Those monks coming along
 the road spent a long time in the Kou house. Goodness only knows how
 much stuff they're carrying. Let's hold them up, take their travel
 money and white horse, and share it all out. That'll suit us very
 nicely.&#8221; The robbers then rushed to the road, brandishing their weapons
 and yelling their war cry as they formed a line.</P>
<P>&#8220;Stay where you are, monks,&#8221; they shouted. &#8220;Leave some toll money and
 we'll spare your lives. If so much as half a 'no' comes out through
 your teeth you'll all be cut down without mercy.&#8221; The Tang Priest was
 shaking with terror as he sat on his horse.</P>
<P>&#8220;What are we to do?&#8221; Pig and Friar Sand asked Brother Monkey with
 alarm. &#8220;What are we to do? We had a miserable night in the rain, and
 after starting out again this morning we're being robbed by bandits.
 How true is it that troubles never come singly.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be frightened, Master,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile, &#8220;and stop
 worrying, brothers. Wait while I go and ask them a few questions.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage put on his tigerskin kilt, straightened up
 his brocade and cotton tunic, went up to them, put his hands together
 in front of his chest and asked, &#8220;What are you gentlemen doing?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't you care whether you live or die, you swine?&#8221; the robbers
 yelled back at him. &#8220;How dare you question us! Have you got no eyes in
 your head? Don't you realize who we great kings are? Hand your toll
 money over at once and we'll let you go on your way.&#8221;</P>
<P>When he heard this, Monkey wreathed his face in smiles and replied,
 &#8220;So you're bandits who hold people up on the road.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Kill him!&#8221; the bandits yelled with fury.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesties,&#8221; said Monkey with feigned terror, &#8220;Your Majesties,
 I'm only a monk from the country. I don't know the right things to say.
 Please don't be angry if I've offended you, please don't. If what you
 want is toll money all you have to do is to ask me: no need to ask the
 other three. I'm the bookkeeper. All the money we get for chanting
 sutras and as alms, all we beg and all we're given, goes into the
 bundles, and I'm in charge of spending it. The man on the horse is my
 master. All he can do is recite sutras. He doesn't care about anything
 else. He's forgotten all about wealth and sex, and he's got nothing at
 all. The black-faced one is a junior I collected on our journey. All he
 can do is look after the horse. And the one with a long snout is a
 laborer I hired. He's only good for carrying a pole. Let those three go
 while I fetch our travel money, cassocks and begging bowls. I'll give
 you all you want.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You seem to be an honest chap, monk,&#8221; the robbers said, &#8220;so we'll
 spare your life. Tell the other three to leave their luggage, and we'll
 let them go.&#8221; Monkey turned back and gave them a look. Friar Sand put
 down the carrying-pole with the luggage, and led the master's horse as
 they carried on Westwards. Monkey bowed down to undo the bundle, took a
 pinch of dust from the ground, and scattered it on the bundle as he
 said the words of a spell.</P>
<P>It was body-fixing magic, so the moment he shouted, &#8220;Stop!&#8221; the
 thirty and more bandits all stood stock still, grinding their teeth,
 staring, their hands apart. None of them could speak or move.</P>
<P>&#8220;Come back, Master,&#8221; shouted Monkey, &#8220;come back!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is terrible,&#8221; said Pig in alarm, &#8220;this is terrible. Big
 brother's informed on us. He isn't carrying any money on him, and
 there's no gold or silver in the bundle. He must be calling the master
 back to ask him to give up his horse. He's going to get the clothes
 stripped off our backs.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't talk such rubbish, brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand with a laugh.
 &#8220;Big brother knows what he's doing. He's always been able to beat
 vicious monsters and demons up till now, so what do we have to fear
 from a few petty thieves? He must be calling us back because he's got
 something to say to us. Let's go straight there and find out.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the venerable elder heard this he cheerfully turned his horse
 round and went back. &#8220;Wukong,&#8221; he called, &#8220;why have you called us
 back?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Hear what these robbers have got to say for themselves,&#8221; Brother
 Monkey said.</P>
<P>Pig went up to them, shoved them and asked, &#8220;Why don't you move,
 bandits?&#8221; The bandits remained completely unconscious and said nothing.</P>
<P>&#8220;They're thick, and dumb too,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;I fixed them by magic,&#8221; said Monkey with a laugh.</P>
<P>&#8220;Even if you fixed them,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;you didn't fix their mouths, so
 why aren't they making a sound?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please dismount and sit down, Master,&#8221; said Brother Monkey. &#8220;As the
 saying goes, 'People only get arrested by mistake; they never get
 released by mistake.' Knock all the robbers over, brother, and tie them
 up. Then we'll force them to make statements. Find out if they're
 beginners or old hands.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Haven't got any rope,&#8221; said Friar Sand. Monkey then pulled out some
 of his hairs, blew on them with magic breath and turned them into
 thirty lengths of rope. They all set to, knocked the robbers over, and
 tied their hands and feet together. Then Monkey said the words that
 ended the spell, whereupon the bandits gradually revived.</P>
<P>Monkey invited the Tang Priest to take the seat of honour while he
 and the other two shouted, holding their weapons, &#8220;Hairy bandits! How
 many of you are there altogether, and how many years have you been in
 this line of business? How many things have you stolen? Have you
 murdered anyone? Is this your first offence? Or your second? Or your
 third?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Spare our lives, your lordships,&#8221; pleaded the robbers.</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop shouting,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;and come clean.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We aren't hardened robbers, your lordships,&#8221; they said. &#8220;We're all
 from good families. Because we're a bad lot we squandered all the
 wealth we'd inherited in drinking, gambling, whoring and living it up.
 We've never worked, and now we've got no money either. We found out
 that Mr. Kou's family was one of the richest in the prefecture of
 Brazentower, so last night we got together to rob it under cover of
 darkness and rain. We stole some gold, silver, clothing and jewelry,
 and were just dividing it up in a mountain hollow to the North of the
 track when we noticed you gentlemen coming. Some of us recognized you
 as the monks Mr. Kou saw off, so we were sure that you must have some
 goods on you. Then we saw how heavy your luggage was and how fast the
 white horse was going. It was our disgraceful greed that made us try to
 hold you up. Never did we imagine that you would have such divine
 powers and be able to tie us up. We beg you to be merciful to us. Take
 back what we stole and spare our lives.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang was violently shocked to hear that their booty had been
 stolen from the Kou household. He stood up at once and said, &#8220;Mr. Kou
 was a very good man, Wukong, so how did he bring such a disaster on
 himself?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It was all because the coloured hangings and fancy parasols, and the
 huge numbers of drummers and musicians when we were seen off attracted
 too much attention,&#8221; replied Monkey with a smile. &#8220;That's why this gang
 of desperadoes attacked his house. Luckily they ran into us, and we've
 taken back all the gold, silver, clothing and jewelry.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We put Mr. Kou out for a whole fortnight,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;so we owe
 him a huge debt of gratitude that we have not yet been able to repay.
 Would it not be a good deed to return this property to his house?&#8221;
 Monkey agreed, and he went to the mountain hollow with Pig and Friar
 Sand to fetch the booty, which they packed up and loaded on the horse.
 He told Pig to carry the load of gold and silver while friar Sand
 carried their own luggage. Monkey was just on the point of killing all
 the bandits with his cudgel when he had the worrying thought that the
 Tang Priest might get angry with him for committing murder. So he could
 only shake himself and take back all the hairs. Now that their hands
 and feet had been untied the thieves all got up then fled for their
 lives into the undergrowth. The Tang Priest then turned back the way he
 had come to return the booty to Mr. Kou. In making this journey he was
 like a moth flying into a flame and coming to disaster. There is a poem
 about it that goes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Kindness to others is rarely with kindness rewarded;</P>
<P>Kindness will often to hate and hostility lead.</P>
<P>Plunge in the water to rescue the drowning? You'll suffer.</P>
<P>Think before acting and spare yourself grief you don't need.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sanzang and his disciples were just heading back with the gold,
 silver, clothing and jewelry when the crowd of men armed with spears
 and swords arrived. &#8220;Disciples,&#8221; said Sanzang with alarm, &#8220;look at all
 those armed men coming here. What is happening?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's a disaster,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;a disaster. They're the robbers we set
 free. They've found weapons and ganged up with some more people. Now
 they've come back and they're going to kill us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They don't look like bandits, brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;Big
 brother, take a closer look.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The master's in bad trouble again,&#8221; Monkey whispered to Friar Sand.
 &#8220;These must be soldiers here to capture the bandits.&#8221; Before he had
 finished saying this the soldiers were upon the master and his
 disciples, surrounding them.</P>
<P>&#8220;You're a fine bunch of monks,&#8221; they said, &#8220;robbing a house then
 swaggering around here like this.&#8221; They then rushed them, dragged the
 Tang Priest off his horse and tied him up. Next they tied up Brother
 Monkey and the others, and carried them off hanging from poles, two men
 to each of them. Driving the horse along and seizing the baggage, they
 went back to the prefectural city. This is what could be seen:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Tang Priest,</P>
<P>Shivering and shaking,</P>
<P>Weeping and lost for words.</P>
<P>Zhu Bajie,</P>
<P>Muttering and grumbling,</P>
<P>Full of complaints.</P>
<P>Friar Sand,</P>
<P>Talking away,</P>
<P>While secretly feeling uncertain.</P>
<P>Sun the Novice,</P>
<P>Chuckling merrily,</P>
<P>Ready to use his powers.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Hustled and carried along by the soldiers, they were soon back in the
 city, where the soldiers escorted them straight to the prefect's court.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Honour,&#8221; they reported, &#8220;the constables have captured the
 robbers and brought them back.&#8221; The prefect, sitting in his place in
 the court, rewarded the constables, inspected the booty and sent for
 the Kou family to collect it. Then he had Sanzang and the others
 brought into court.</P>
<P>&#8220;You monks maintain that you come from a place far away to the East
 and are going to worship the Buddha in the Western Heaven,&#8221; he said,
 interrogating them. &#8220;But really you're housebreakers who used dirty
 tricks so that you could get to know your way around.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Honour,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;we are not robbers. I would not dare
 to deceive you. We carry a passport with us as proof. It was because we
 were so grateful to Mr. Kou's family for feeding us for a fortnight
 that when we ran into the robbers along our way we recovered the booty
 they had stolen from the Kou house. We were taking it back to the Kou
 house to pay our debt of gratitude when to our astonishment we were
 arrested as robbers by the constables. We really are not robbers, and I
 beg Your Honour to investigate closely.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You only made up that fancy talk about paying a debt of gratitude
 because you were arrested by the soldiers,&#8221; the prefect replied. &#8220;If
 you really met other robbers why didn't you show your gratitude by
 capturing them and turning them in? Why are only the four of you here?
 Look at the wanted notice Kou Liang submitted. He accuses you by name.
 How dare you still dispute it!&#8221; When Sanzang heard this he felt like a
 storm-tossed boat on the ocean, and all his souls flew away.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; he said, &#8220;why don't you come forward and argue in our
 defense?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The booty proves it,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Arguing would do no good.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's right,&#8221; the prefect said. &#8220;The booty is all here as proof. Do
 you still dare to deny it? Fetch the head-clamp,&#8221; he instructed his
 underlings, &#8220;and put it round the head of the bald robber. Then beat
 him again.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey was now very anxious. &#8220;Even though my master is fated to
 suffer this,&#8221; he thought to himself, &#8220;I mustn't let it be too tough for
 him.&#8221; Seeing the yamen runners tightening the cord to fix the
 head-clamp in place he opened his mouth to speak.</P>
<P>&#8220;Please don't squeeze that monk's head, Your Honour. When we robbed
 the Kou house last night I was the one who lit the torches, carried the
 sword, stole the goods and killed the man. I was the ringleader. If you
 want to torture anyone, torture me. It's nothing to do with them. The
 only thing is that you mustn't let me go.&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing this the prefect ordered, &#8220;Put the clamp on him first.&#8221;
 The underlings then all fell on Monkey, fixed the clamp on his head,
 and tightened it so hard that the cord snapped with a twang. The clamp
 was fastened, tightened and snapped with a twang again. They did this
 three or four times, and the skin on his head was not even creased.</P>
<P>When they changed the cord and were tightening it again someone was
 heard coming in to report, &#8220;Your Honour, the Lord Assistant Protector
 Chen from the capital is coming. Will you please come to greet him
 outside the city?&#8221;</P>
<P>The prefect then ordered the head torturer, &#8220;Throw the bandits into
 gaol and keep a good eye on them. The torture and interrogation will
 continue after I have gone to greet my superior.&#8221; The head torturer
 then marched the Tang Priest and the other three into the gaol. Pig and
 Friar Sand carried their luggage in with them.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;what are we to do?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In you go, Master,&#8221; said Monkey with a grin, &#8220;in you go. There
 aren't any dogs barking in there. It'll be a lark.&#8221; The four of them
 were then taken inside, and each of them was pushed on a torture rack,
 to which their bellies, heads and chests were tightly fastened. The
 warders then started beating them up again.</P>
<P>Finding the agony unbearable, Sanzang called out, &#8220;Whatever shall I
 do, Wukong? Whatever shall I do?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They're beating us because they want money,&#8221; Brother Monkey replied.
 &#8220;As the saying goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Stay put when things are going well;</P>
<P>Spend cash when things are going ill.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>They'll stop if you give them some money.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But where am I to get money from?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you haven't any money,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;clothes will do. Give
 them the cassock.&#8221;</P>
<P>These words cut Sanzang to the heart, but realizing that the beating
 was more than he could take he could only say, &#8220;Do as you will,
 Wukong.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; Monkey called out, &#8220;there's no need to beat us any more.
 There's a brocade cassock in one of the two bundles we brought in with
 us that's worth a fortune. Open them up and take it.&#8221; When the warders
 heard this they all set to together, opening the bundles up to search
 them. There were some cotton clothes and a document case, but none of
 these were worth anything. Seeing something glowing brightly inside
 several layers of oiled paper the warders realized that it must be a
 treasure. When they shook it open and looked at it, this is what it
 looked like:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Exquisitely decorated with shining pearls,</P>
<P>Set with some wonderful Buddha treasures.</P>
<P>Embroidered dragons curled around;</P>
<P>Flying phoenixes adorned brocade edges.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As they all struggled to look they disturbed the head gaoler, who
 came up to them and shouted, &#8220;What are you all making this row about?&#8221;</P>
<P>Falling to their knees, the warders replied, &#8220;His Honour has just
 started a case against four monks and sent them here. When we roughed
 them up a bit they gave us these two bundles. After we opened them we
 saw this, and we don't know how to deal with it. It would be a real
 pity to tear it up to divide between us, but it would be hard on
 everyone else if just one of us had it. It's a good thing you've come,
 sir: you can give us a ruling.&#8221; The head gaoler could see that it was a
 cassock. Then he inspected the other clothes and the document case, and
 on opening the case to read the passport he saw that it was covered
 with seals and signatures from many states.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's a good thing I saw this in time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If I hadn't, you
 people would have caused bad trouble. These monks aren't robbers. On no
 account touch their things. When His Honour questions them again
 tomorrow we'll find out the truth.&#8221; The warders then gave the wrapping
 cloths back to the prisoners, who repacked them and handed them over to
 the head gaoler for safekeeping.</P>
<P>Evening was slowly drawing in. The drum could be heard from its
 tower, and the fire wardens began their patrols. By the third mark of
 the fourth watch Monkey could see that the others had stopped groaning
 and were fast asleep. &#8220;The master was fated to meet with the hardship
 of a night in gaol,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;That was why I said nothing in our
 defense and didn't use my magic powers. But now the fourth watch is
 nearly over, and his suffering's almost done. I'd better start getting
 things sorted out if we're to leave this gaol at dawn.&#8221;</P>
<P>Just watch as he uses his powers to make himself smaller, get off the
 rack, shake himself and turn into a midge who flies out of the prison
 through a gap between the tiles over the eaves. By the light of the
 stars and the moon in the still, silent night sky, he could see where
 he was going, and he flew quietly straight towards the gates of the Kou
 house. On the West side of the road was a house where a lamp was
 shining brightly, and as he flew closer for a better look he saw that
 it was a house of beancurd-makers. An old man could be seen looking
 after the fire while an old woman was squeezing out the bean juice.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wife,&#8221; the old man suddenly called out, &#8220;Mr. Kou had wealth and
 sons, but he didn't live long. When we were boys we were both at school
 together. I was five years older than him. His father was called Kou
 Ming. In those days he had less than 150 acres. He couldn't even
 collect his overdue rents. Old Kou Ming died when his son was nineteen,
 and once the young man took charge of the household things went really
 well. He married the daughter of Zhang Wang&#8212;she used to be known as
 Threadneedle when she was a girl, but she made her husband a rich man.
 Once she came into his house his crops were good and the debts to him
 got paid. Whatever he bought showed a profit, and whatever he went in
 for made money. His family's worth a hundred thousand now. When he
 reached forty he turned pious and he fed ten thousand monks. Fancy him
 being kicked to death by robbers last night! Poor man. He was only
 sixty-four. Who would have thought so good a man would meet with so
 evil a reward and be murdered just when everything was going well for
 him? What a pity! What a pity!&#8221;</P>
<P>By the time Monkey had listened to all this it was now at the first
 mark of the fifth watch. He then flew into the Kou house, where a
 coffin was placed in the main room. A lamp was burning at the head, and
 around the coffin was incense, candles and fruit. His wife was weeping
 beside him, and the two sons also came to kowtow and weep, while their
 wives brought two bowls of rice as an offering. Monkey landed at the
 head of the coffin and coughed. This gave the two daughters-in-law such
 a fright that they ran outside waving their arms about.</P>
<P>Kou Liang and his brother lay on the floor, too terrified to move,
 and crying out, &#8220;Oh, father, oh!&#8221; Their mother, being bolder, hit the
 head of the coffin and said, &#8220;Have you come back to life, old man?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Monkey, imitating Mr. Kou's voice, to the great alarm
 of the two sons, who kept kowtowing, weeping, and repeating, &#8220;Oh,
 Father, oh!&#8221;</P>
<P>Their mother summoned up even more courage to ask, &#8220;Husband, if you
 haven't come back to life why are you talking?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;King Yama has sent demons to bring me here to talk to you,&#8221; Monkey
 replied. &#8220;He told me that Threadneedle Zhang had been lying and trying
 to frame the innocent.&#8221;</P>
<P>In her surprise at hearing him call her by the name she had been
 known as a child, the old woman fell at once to her knees, kowtowed and
 said, &#8220;You're a fine old man! Fancy calling me by my childhood name at
 this age! What lies have I been telling? Which innocent people have I
 framed?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wasn't there something about 'The Tang Priest lit the torches, Pig
 incited to murder, Friar Sand stole the gold and silver, and Sun the
 Novice murdered our father?'&#8220; Monkey replied. &#8220;Your lies have landed
 those good men in terrible trouble. What really happened was that the
 Tang Priest and the other three teachers met some bandits and got our
 property back for us to show their thanks. How good of them! But you
 had to concoct a wanted notice and send our sons to denounce them to
 the authorities. The court threw them in gaol without making a careful
 investigation. The gaol god, the local deity and the city god were all
 so alarmed and uneasy that they reported it to King Yama, and he
 ordered demons to escort me back home. I'm to tell you to have them
 released as soon as possible. If you don't, I will have to make havoc
 here for a month. Nobody in the household, young or old&#8212;not even the
 dogs and the chickens&#8212;will be spared.&#8221;</P>
<P>Kou Liang and his brother kowtowed again and begged, &#8220;Please go back,
 Father, and don't harm us all. At dawn we'll submit a petition to the
 court for their release and withdraw our charge against them. We only
 want peace for both the living and the dead.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he called out, &#8220;Burn sacrificial paper money.
 I am leaving.&#8221; All his family started burning paper money. Monkey then
 rose up on his wings and flew straight to the prefect's residence.
 Bending low to look he saw that there was a light in the bedroom: the
 prefect was already up. When Monkey flew into the main room, he saw a
 scroll-painting hanging on the back wall. It showed an official riding
 a piebald horse with several servants holding a blue umbrella and
 carrying a folding chair. Monkey did not know what the picture was
 about, but landed in the middle of it. All of a sudden the prefect came
 out of the bedroom and bent low to comb and wash himself. Monkey gave a
 sharp cough, alarming the prefect and sending him hurrying back into
 his bedroom. When he had combed his hair, washed himself and put on his
 formal clothes the prefect came out to burn incense to the picture and
 pray to it.</P>
<P>&#8220;Venerable uncle, divine Jiang Qianyi, your dutiful nephew Jiang
 Kunsan is now prefect of Brazentower, thanks to the hereditary
 privilege won for me by your ancestral virtue, and also to my success
 in the examinations. Morning and evening I offer incense without
 interruption. Why did you speak today? I beg you not to haunt us and
 terrify the household.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So this is a holy picture of his ancestor,&#8221; Brother Monkey thought
 with a hidden smile, and making the most of this chance he called out,
 &#8220;Nephew Kunsan, you have always been uncorrupt in the office you were
 given through ancestral privilege. How could you have been so stupid
 yesterday? You took four holy monks for thieves and threw them into
 prison without finding out why they had come. The prison god, the local
 deity and the city god were all so disturbed by this that they reported
 it to the king of Hell. He told demon envoys to bring me here to speak
 to you and advise you to consider the circumstances and find out the
 truth, and release them at once. Otherwise you'll have to come back to
 the Underworld with me for the case to be sorted out.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the prefect heard this he replied in terror, &#8220;Please go back
 now, sit. Your nephew will go straight into court and release them at
 once.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well then,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;Burn some sacrificial paper money. I
 am going to report back to King Yama.&#8221; The prefect lit incense, burned
 paper money and bowed in thanks. When Monkey flew out again and looked
 around he saw that the East was already turning white. He then flew to
 the Diling county office, where all the county officials could be seen
 in the courtroom.</P>
<P>&#8220;If I talk when I'm a midge,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;and someone spots me it'll
 give the game away. That wouldn't do.&#8221; So he gave himself a giant
 magical body where he was in mid air, and stretched down one foot that
 filled the whole courtroom. &#8220;Listen to me, you officials,&#8221; he shouted.
 &#8220;I am the Roving God Rambler, sent here by the Jade Emperor. He says
 that sons of the Buddha on their way to fetch the scriptures have been
 beaten up in the prefectural gaol here, which has disturbed the gods of
 the three worlds. He has asked me to tell you to release them at once.
 If anything goes wrong I'm to use my other foot to kick all you county
 and prefecture officials to death, then crush all the people around
 here and trample the whole city to dust and ashes.&#8221; At this the county
 magistrate and the other officials all fell to their knees and kowtowed
 in worship.</P>
<P>&#8220;Please go back now, superior sage,&#8221; they pleaded. &#8220;We are now going
 to the prefectural offices to request His Honour to release them
 immediately. We implore you not to move your feet and terrify us to
 death.&#8221; Only then did Monkey put away that magical body, turn into a
 midge again and fly back into the gaol through a gap between the tiles
 at the eaves, climb into his rack and go to sleep.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story now tells that no sooner had the prefect entered his
 courtroom and ordered the notice inviting people to submit written
 requests to be carried outside than Kou Liang and his brother fell to
 their knees at the entrance, holding the notice in their arms. The
 prefect ordered them to come in, and when the prefect read the document
 that the two of them submitted he said in fury, &#8220;Yesterday you handed
 me a wanted notice. The thieves were arrested and you had the booty
 back. So why are you asking for them to be released today?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Honour,&#8221; the two brothers replied, tears streaming down, &#8220;last
 night our father's spirit appeared to us and said 'the holy monks from
 Tang captured the bandits, took our property back from them, released
 them and were kindly bringing the goods back to us to show their
 gratitude. How could you have treated them as robbers, captured them
 and made them suffer in gaol? The local god in the gaol and the city
 god were so alarmed and uneasy that they reported it to King Yama. King
 Yama ordered demons to escort me back to tell you to go to the
 prefectural court and submit another plea for the Tang Priest's release
 and thus avoid disaster. Otherwise everybody in the household would be
 killed.' This is why we have come with this request for their release.
 We beg you to help us, Your Honour.&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing this the prefect thought, &#8220;Their father is a new ghost
 whose body is still warm, so it's not surprising that he should have
 appeared to them after what happened. But my uncle has been dead for
 five or six years. Why did he appear to me early this morning and tell
 me to investigate and release them? It really does look as though an
 injustice has been done.&#8221;</P>
<P>As the prefect was thinking things over the magistrate and other
 officials of Diling county came rushing into the courtroom to say in a
 wild panic, &#8220;Disaster, Your Honour, disaster! The Jade Emperor has just
 sent the Roving God Rambler down to earth to tell you to release those
 good men from gaol this very moment. The monks captured yesterday
 weren't robbers: they are disciples of the Buddha going to fetch the
 scriptures. If there's any delay he's going to kick all us officials to
 death, then trample the whole city and all the people in it to dust and
 ashes.&#8221; The prefect turned pale at this new shock, then told the head
 gaoler to write a release order and deliver them to the court. The
 prison doors were immediately opened and they were led out.</P>
<P>&#8220;Goodness knows what sort of beating we're in for today,&#8221; said Pig
 gloomily.</P>
<P>&#8220;I can guarantee that they won't dare give you a single clout,&#8221; said
 Monkey with a grin. &#8220;I've fixed everything up. When you go into the
 courtroom you absolutely mustn't kneel. He'll come down into the court
 to invite us to take the best seats. Then we'll ask for our luggage and
 the horse back from him. If anything's missing I'll give him a beating
 for your entertainment.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before he had finished speaking they reached the entrance to the
 courtroom, where the prefect, the county magistrate and all the other
 officials came out to welcome them with the words, &#8220;When you holy monks
 arrived yesterday we were under urgent pressure to meet our superiors.
 In addition, we did see the stolen goods. That is why we did not find
 out the truth.&#8221; The Tang Priest put his hands together in front of his
 chest, bowed and recounted in detail everything that had happened.</P>
<P>The officials were all voluble in admitting, &#8220;We were wrong, we were
 wrong. Please, please don't be angry with us.&#8221;</P>
<P>They then asked if the monks had lost anything in the prison. Monkey
 stepped forward, opened his eyes wide in a glare and yelled at the top
 of his voice, &#8220;Our white horse was taken by the court officers, and the
 gaolers took our luggage. Give it back right now. It's our turn to
 torture and question you lot how. What should the punishment for
 wrongfully arresting innocent people as bandits be?&#8221;</P>
<P>Seeing how ugly he was acting, the prefectural and county officials
 were all terrified. They told the people who had taken the horse to
 return the horse, and the men who had taken the luggage to return every
 single piece of it. Just look at how viciously the three disciples
 start acting, while the officials could only blame the Kou family to
 cover up their own blunder.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciples,&#8221; said Sanzang, trying to calm them down. &#8220;Let us go to
 the Kou house to question them and argue it out with them in order to
 make everything clear. Then we can find out who it was who took us for
 robbers.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Good idea,&#8221; said Brother Monkey. &#8220;I'll call the dead man back and
 ask him who killed him.&#8221;</P>
<P>Friar Sand hoisted the Tang Priest up on the horse right there in the
 courtroom, then escorted him outside with much shouting. All the
 prefectural and county officials accompanied them to the Kou house, so
 alarming Kou Liang and his brother that they kowtowed repeatedly in
 front of the gateway then led them into the hall. This was where old
 Mr. Kou's coffin lay, and the whole family was to be seen weeping
 inside the mourning drapes around it.</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop howling, you lying old woman,&#8221; Monkey shouted. &#8220;You tried to
 get innocent men killed. Wait till I call your husband back. We'll see
 what he has to say about who murdered him. That'll shame her.&#8221; The
 officials all thought that Monkey was joking, but then he said, &#8220;Please
 keep my master company for a moment, Your Honors, Pig, Friar Sand,
 protect him well. I'm off. I'll soon be back.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage bounded outside and rose up into the sky.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Coloured clouds were all around to cover up the house.</P>
<P>Auspicious auras filled the sky to protect the primal deity.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Only then did everyone recognize that Monkey was an immortal who
 could ride clouds and mists, and a sage who could bring the dead back
 to life. We will not tell of how they all burned incense and
 worshipped.</P>
<P>The Great Sage went straight to the Underworld by somersault cloud
 and charged into the Senluo Palace, causing such alarm that:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Ten Kings of the Underworld came out to raise their bands in
 greeting;</P>
<P>The demon judges of the five regions kowtowed in welcome.</P>
<P>A thousand trees of knives all leaned away;</P>
<P>Ten thousand hills of swords all leveled themselves.</P>
<P>In the City of the Unjustly Slain the fiends were converted;</P>
<P>Under the bridge over Punishment River the dead return to life.</P>
<P>The divine light was like the grace of Heaven,</P>
<P>And everywhere shone bright in the palaces of darkness.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Ten Kings received the Great Sage, greeted him, and asked him why
 he had come. &#8220;Who's got the ghost of Kou Hong who used to feed monks in
 Diling County in the prefecture of Brazentower?&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Find him
 and give him to me at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Kou Hong is a very good man,&#8221; the Ten King replied. &#8220;He came here
 himself. No demon had to envoys drag him here with their hooks. He met
 King Ksitigarbha's Goldenclad Boy, who took him to see Ksitigarbha.&#8221;
 Monkey then took his leave of them and went straight to the Turquoise
 Cloud Palace, where he saw the Bodhisattva King Ksitigarbha. When the
 Bodhisattva had greeted him Monkey explained what had happened.</P>
<P>&#8220;Liang Hong's allotted span had been completed,&#8221; the Bodhisattva said
 with delight, &#8220;and his life was over. That is why he left the world
 behind and came here without touching his bed. As he was such a good
 man who had fed monks I have made him a chief recorder in charge of the
 register of good deeds. But since you have come here to fetch him,
 Great Sage, I shall grant him a twelve-year extension of his life on
 earth. Let him leave with the Great Sage.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Goldenclad Boy then led out Kou Hong, who on seeing Monkey kept
 saying, &#8220;Teacher, save me! Teacher!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You were kicked to death by robbers,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;and now you're
 in the Bodhisattva King Ksitigarbha's place in the Under world. I've
 come to fetch you and take you to the world of the living to sort this
 matter out. The Bodhisattva will let you go back and has given you
 another twelve years of life, after which you'll come back here.&#8221; The
 old gentleman kowtowed to him endlessly.</P>
<P>Having thanked and taken his leave of the Bodhisattva, Monkey blew on
 Kou Hong, turned him into vapor, tucked him into his sleeve and left
 the Underworld to go back to the world of the living. He rode his cloud
 back to the Kou house, told Pig to lever the lid off the coffin and
 pushed Kou Hong's spirit back into the body.</P>
<P>A moment later Kou Hong started breathing as he came back to life.
 Climbing out of his coffin, he kowtowed to the Tang Priest and his
 three disciples with the words, &#8220;Teachers, teachers, I was wrongly
 killed, but my master went to the Underworld to bring me back to life.
 I owe him my recovery.&#8221;</P>
<P>His thanks were unending. When he turned round and saw all the
 officials drawn up in line he kowtowed again and asked, &#8220;Why are all
 your lordships in my house?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your sons first submitted a wanted notice,&#8221; the prefect replied,
 &#8220;and accused the holy monks by name. I sent men to arrest them, not
 realizing that the holy monks had met the robbers who raided your
 house, taken the booty off them and were returning it to your house. I
 was wrong to have them arrested, and I had them thrown into gaol
 without making a detailed investigation. Last night your spirit
 appeared, my late uncle came to lodge a complaint with me, and the
 Roving God Rambler came down to earth in the county offices. After so
 many manifestations I released the holy monks, and they have brought
 you back to life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Honour,&#8221; said Mr. Kou on his knees, &#8220;these four holy monks
 really have been wronged. That night over thirty bandits with torches
 and weapons robbed my house. Because I could not bear to lose all those
 things I tried to reason with the robbers, but to my horror they kicked
 me to death. What's it got to do with these four gentlemen?&#8221;</P>
<P>He then called for his wife. &#8220;Why did you people make that lying
 report about who had killed me? Will you please determine their
 punishments, Your Honour.&#8221; Everyone in the family, young and old alike,
 kowtowed. In his magnanimity the prefect spared them from punishment.
 Kou Hong then ordered a banquet to thank the prefectural and county
 officials for their generosity. The officials all returned to their
 offices without sitting down at the banquet. The next day the sign
 announcing that monks would be fed was hung out again, and another
 attempt was made to keep Sanzang there. Sanzang refused absolutely to
 stay any longer. Once again Mr. Kou invited his friends and relations,
 arranged for flags and canopies and saw them off as before. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>However remote the place evil deeds can be done;</P>
<P>Heaven may be high, but it does not desert the good.</P>
<P>Steadily they plod along towards the Tathagata</P>
<P>Until they reach the gate of bliss on Vulture Peak.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you do not know what happened when they met the Buddha, listen to
 the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<P>When the Ape and the Horse Are Tamed They Cast Off Their Husks</P>

</B>
<P>The story told how after coming back to life Mr. Kou once more
 arranged for parasols, banners, drummers, musicians, Buddhist monks,
 Taoist priests, his friends and his relations to see Sanzang off again.
 But instead of describing this we will tell of the Tang Priest and his
 three disciples taking the main road. The West was indeed a land of the
 Buddha, unlike anywhere else. They saw precious flowers, rare grasses,
 ancient cypresses and hoary pines. In all the places they passed
 through every family was pious and fed monks. Under every mountain
 people cultivated their conduct; in all the forests travelers recited
 sutras Master and disciples took shelter each night and set out at
 dawn, till six or seven days later a mass of high buildings and
 splendid halls suddenly came into view. Truly they were:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Thrusting a hundred feet into the heavens,</P>
<P>Touching the Milky Way in the sky.</P>
<P>Lower your head and see the setting sun;</P>
<P>Put out your hand and pluck a shooting star.</P>
<P>The spacious windows enclose the cosmos;</P>
<P>The towering roofbeams join up with the clouds.</P>
<P>Yellow cranes bring letters as the autumn trees grow old;</P>
<P>Coloured phoenix epistles come in the fresh evening breeze.</P>
<P>These are sacred and precious palaces and gates,</P>
<P>Jeweled, intricate buildings and courtyards.</P>
<P>In the holy halls the Way is discussed;</P>
<P>Sutras are transmitted throughout the universe.</P>
<P>The flowers are beautiful as they turn towards the spring;</P>
<P>Green are the pine trees in the rain.</P>
<P>Purple fungus and immortals' fruits ever flourish;</P>
<P>All beings respond as red phoenixes soar.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sanzang raised his whip and pointed with it as he said, &#8220;What a fine
 place, Wukong.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;when you were in those delusive places where
 you saw false images of Buddhas you insisted on prostrating yourself in
 front of them. But today, when you've reached the real place where
 there is the true image of the Buddha, you won't even dismount. What do
 you mean by it?&#8221; No sooner did he hear this than Sanzang sprang
 straight out of the saddle and went to the gateway.</P>
<P>A young lay brother who stood to one side of the monastery gateway
 called out, &#8220;You must be the people from the East who have come to
 fetch the scriptures.&#8221; The venerable elder quickly straightened his
 clothes and raised his head to look around. He saw that the boy was</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Wearing clothes of golden brocade,</P>
<P>Waving a jade-handled whisk.</P>
<P>Wearing clothes of golden brocade</P>
<P>He feasted in pavilions by the Jasper Pool;</P>
<P>Waving a jade-handled whisk</P>
<P>He dusted the steps of the purple palaces.</P>
<P>At his side hung an immortal's tablet;</P>
<P>And on his feet were sandals.</P>
<P>He was a true winged adept,</P>
<P>Elegant and remarkable.</P>
<P>Having won immortality he lived in a wonderful land,</P>
<P>Cultivating eternal life and escaping from worldly dust.</P>
<P>The holy priest did not recognize the stranger on Vulture Peak,</P>
<P>The Gold-crested Immortal of yesteryear.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Great Sage Monkey did, however, recognize him. &#8220;Master,&#8221; said
 Monkey, &#8220;this is the Great Gold-crested Immortal who lives at the Jade
 Truth Temple at the foot of Vulture Peak. He is here to greet us.&#8221; Only
 then did Sanzang realize who he was and step forward to salute him.</P>
<P>&#8220;You have finally arrived here this year,&#8221; replied the Great Immortal
 with a smile. &#8220;I was fooled by the Bodhisattva Guanyin. Ten years ago
 she went to the East at the Buddha's command to find the Pilgrim who
 would fetch the scriptures. She told me then he would be here within
 two or three years. I have been waiting for years on end with no news
 of you at all. I never thought that it would be this year before we
 met.&#8221;</P>
<P>Putting his hands together in front of his chest, Sanzang replied, &#8220;I
 am very grateful to you for your kindness, Great Immortal, very
 grateful.&#8221; Sanzang and his three disciples led the horse and carried
 the baggage with them into the Taoist temple, where they were
 introduced to all the Great Immortals there. Tea and a vegetarian meal
 were then ordered, and the Taoist boys were told to heat scented water
 for the holy monks to bathe in before climbing to the Buddha land.
 Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When achievements are complete it is right to bathe;</P>
<P>The fundamental nature has been trained into innate truth.</P>
<P>Many thousand troubles and today:</P>
<P>The nine prohibitions and triple surrender lead to renewal.</P>
<P>The monsters all done with, they climb to the Buddha land;</P>
<P>With disasters ended they see the Sramana.</P>
<P>Dirt and filth now washed away, they are wholly pure;</P>
<P>Returning to the fundamental, their bodies are imperishable.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>By the time master and disciples had bathed the day was drawing to a
 close. They spent the night in the Jade Truth Temple.</P>
<P>The next morning the Tang Priest changed into his brocade cassock,
 put on his Vairocana mitre and grasped his monastic staff in his hand
 to climb the steps of the main hall and take his leave of the Great
 Immortal. &#8220;Yesterday you were in rags,&#8221; the Great Immortal said with a
 smile, &#8220;but today you are dressed in splendor. I can see from your
 appearance that you are indeed a son of the Buddha.&#8221; Sanzang then bowed
 in farewell.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wait a moment,&#8221; the Great Immortal said. &#8220;I will see you off.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no need for you to see us off,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;I know the
 way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What you know,&#8221; said the Great Immortal, &#8220;is the way by cloud. The
 holy monk has never gone by cloud. He must go by the overland way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right,&#8221; replied Monkey. &#8220;Although I've been here several
 times I've always come and gone by cloud. I've never come here on foot.
 If there's an overland route I'll trouble you to see us along it. My
 master is very serious about worshipping the Buddha, so I'd be very
 grateful if you could hurry up about it.&#8221; The Great Immortal chuckled
 as he took the Tang Priest by hand and led the Incense to the gate of
 the Dharma. The way led not out by the temple's front entrance but
 through the main hall and out through the back gate.</P>
<P>Pointing towards Vulture Peak, the Great Immortal said, &#8220;Holy monk,
 do you see the auspicious light of many colours and the richly textured
 aura in the sky? That is the summit of Vulture Peak, the holy territory
 of the Lord Buddha.&#8221; As soon as he saw it the Tang Priest bowed low.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Brother Monkey with a smile, &#8220;we haven't got to the
 place for bowing yet. As the saying goes, 'The mountain may be in view,
 but your horse will collapse before you get there.' We're still quite a
 long way from the place, so why start bowing now? If you bow all the
 way from here to the top, however many times will you have to hit your
 head on the ground?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Holy monk,&#8221; said the Great Immortal, &#8220;You, the Great Sage, Marshal
 Tian Peng, and the Curtain-raising General have now reached the blessed
 land and seen Vulture Peak. I am going back now.&#8221; Sanzang took his
 leave of the Great Immortal and continued on his way.</P>
<P>The Great Sage led the Tang Priest and the others slowly up Vulture
 Peak. Within a couple of miles they reached a river of mighty rolling
 waves some three miles wide. There was no sign of anyone anywhere
 around.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said Sanzang with alarm, &#8220;we have come the wrong way. I
 wonder if the Great Immortal misdirected us. This river is so wide and
 the waves so big, and there are no boats to be seen. How are we to
 cross it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He didn't send us the wrong way,&#8221; replied Monkey with a smile. &#8220;Look
 over there. That's a bridge, isn't it? Once we're over that we'll have
 completed the true achievement.&#8221; When the venerable elder and the
 others went closer to look they saw a tablet beside it on which were
 written the words CLOUDTOUCHING CROSSING. Now this bridge was only a
 single log. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>From afar it seemed to span the void like a beam of jade;</P>
<P>Seen closer, the bridge was but a withered spar crossing the water.</P>
<P>To bind a river and frame the sea is easier</P>
<P>Than walking along the trunk of a single tree.</P>
<P>The glow of a myriad rainbows spread out all around;</P>
<P>A thousand lengths of fine white silk stretched to the edge of the
 sky.</P>
<P>It was narrow, slippery and hard to cross,</P>
<P>Unless one was a god who could walk on coloured clouds.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said Sanzang in fear and trembling, &#8220;no mortal man could
 cross that bridge. Let us look elsewhere to find the way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But this is the way,&#8221; replied Monkey with a smile, &#8220;this is the
 way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Nobody's going to dare cross that even if it is the right way,&#8221; said
 Pig with alarm. &#8220;The river's so wide, and there are those terrible
 waves, and all there is is that narrow, slippery tree-trunk. We
 couldn't take a single step.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You all stand there while I go on it to show you,&#8221; replied Monkey.</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage strode forward and sprang on the single-trunk
 bridge. He quickly ran across to the other side, swaying as he went,
 and called out, &#8220;Come over, come over.&#8221; The Tang Priest waved in
 refusal, while Pig and Friar Sand bit their fingers and said, &#8220;It's
 much too hard.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey then ran back again from the far side and pulled at Pig. &#8220;Come
 with me, you idiot,&#8221; he said, &#8220;come with me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's too slippery, it's too slippery,&#8221; said Pig, lying down on the
 ground. &#8220;I could never cross it. Please spare me that and let me cross
 by wind and mist.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey held him down as he replied, &#8220;This is no place for you to be
 allowed to go riding wind and mist. You can only become a Buddha by
 crossing this bridge.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;I'll never make it. Honestly, I can't walk
 across.&#8221;</P>
<P>As the two of them were pulling at each other and fighting, Friar
 Sand went over to talk them round. Only then did they let go of each
 other. Sanzang then looked round to see a man poling a boat towards
 them from downriver and shouting, &#8220;Ferry! Come aboard.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop fooling around, disciples,&#8221; said a delighted venerable elder.
 &#8220;There is a ferry-boat coming.&#8221; The other three sprang to their feet
 and all watched together as the boat drew closer. It was a bottomless
 craft.</P>
<P>Monkey had already spotted with the golden pupils in his fiery eyes
 that this was the Welcoming Lord Buddha, who is also known as
 Ratnadhvaja, the Royal Buddha of Brightness, but instead of giving this
 away he just kept calling, &#8220;Over here, punt, over here.&#8221;</P>
<P>A moment later the ferryman had punted his boat up to the bank and
 was again shouting, &#8220;Ferry! Come aboard!&#8221; Sanzang was once more alarmed
 at the sight. &#8220;Your boat has no bottom,&#8221; he said, &#8220;so however could you
 ferry anyone across?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This boat of mine,&#8221; the Buddha said,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Has been famous since Chaos was first divided,</P>
<P>And been punted by me without any changes.</P>
<P>It is stable in wind and stable in waves,</P>
<P>Enjoying great peace with no start and no end.</P>
<P>Untouched by the six types of dust, it returns to the One,</P>
<P>Carries on calmly through all kinds of calamity.</P>
<P>Hard it is for a bottomless boat to cross the oceans,</P>
<P>But since ancient times it has ferried all creatures.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Great Sage Monkey put his hands together in front of his chest
 and thanked him with the words, &#8220;I am grateful to you for your
 generosity in coming to welcome my master. Step aboard, Master. That
 boat of his may have no bottom, but it's stable, and won't capsize even
 in wind and waves.&#8221; The venerable elder was still very doubtful, but
 Monkey seized him by the arms and pushed him forward. Unable to keep on
 his feet, the master tumbled into the water, where the ferryman grabbed
 hold of him at once and stood him on the boat. The master shook his
 clothes and stamped his feet, complaining about Monkey, who led Friar
 Sand and Pig to stand on board bringing the luggage and the horse with
 them.</P>
<P>Gently and strongly the Buddha pushed off, at which a corpse came
 floating downstream, to the horror of the venerable elder. &#8220;Don't be
 frightened, Master,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;That's you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's you, it's you,&#8221; said Pig. Friar Sand clapped his hands as he
 said, &#8220;It's you, it's you!&#8221;</P>
<P>The boatman gave a call, then also put in, too, &#8220;It's you!
 Congratulations! Congratulations!&#8221; The three of them all joined in
 these congratulations as the ferryman punted the boat quickly and
 steadily over the immortal Cloud-touching Crossing. Sanzang turned
 around and sprang lightly ashore on the opposite bank. There is a poem
 about this that goes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the womb-born flesh and body of blood is cast aside,</P>
<P>The primal spirit finds kinship and love.</P>
<P>On this morning of actions completed and Buddhahood attained</P>
<P>The thirty-six kinds of dust from the past are washed away.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This was indeed what is meant by great wisdom, the boundless dharma
 of crossing to the other bank. When the four of them climbed the bank
 and looked back the bottomless boat had already disappeared, goodness
 knew where. Only when Brother Monkey explained that it had been the
 Welcoming Buddha did Sanzang find enlightenment At once he turned round
 to thank his three disciples.</P>
<P>&#8220;Let's not exchange thanks,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;We've helped each other.
 You saved us three, Master, and showed us the way to win merit so as to
 complete the true achievement. And we have protected you, Master,
 holding to the faith and helping you happily to cast off your mortal
 body. Master, look at the magnificent scenery ahead. Flowers, grasses,
 pines and bamboo, as well as phoenixes, cranes and deer. Compare it
 with those places where evil beings created illusions through
 transformation. Ask yourself which is beautiful and good, and which
 ugly and evil.&#8221; Sanzang was full of expressions of gratitude. All of
 them were now light of body and cheerful as they walked up Vulture
 Peak. Soon the ancient Thunder Monastery could be seen:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Its rooftops touched the heavens,</P>
<P>Its roots joined with the Sumeru range.</P>
<P>Amazing peaks spread out in serried rank;</P>
<P>Craggy rocks formed interlocking shapes.</P>
<P>Under the hanging scar were wonderful plants and flowers;</P>
<P>Beside the winding path grew magic mushrooms and orchids.</P>
<P>Immortal apes were picking the fruit of the peach trees,</P>
<P>Like gold amid burning flames;</P>
<P>White cranes perched in the branches of the pines</P>
<P>As if they were jade creatures amid smoke.</P>
<P>Coloured phoenixes in pairs,</P>
<P>Green phoenixes two by two.</P>
<P>The pairs of coloured phoenixes</P>
<P>Brought blessings on the world as they called to the sun;</P>
<P>The green phoenixes two by two</P>
<P>Danced in the wind, a rare and wonderful sight.</P>
<P>On the gleaming golden tiles were figures of mandarin ducks;</P>
<P>The brilliantly patterned bricks were set with agate.</P>
<P>To East and West</P>
<P>Were flowers of palaces and pearls of gateways;</P>
<P>To North and South</P>
<P>Were endless precious pavilions and high buildings.</P>
<P>The Devaraja Hall streamed with coloured light;</P>
<P>Purple flames rose before the Lokapalas Chamber.</P>
<P>Stupas stood out,</P>
<P>And fragrant were the blossoms of the udumbara tree.</P>
<P>Truly this was a place so fine it might have come from heaven,</P>
<P>Where the days seemed long under leisurely clouds.</P>
<P>Away from the mortal world, all fates came to an end;</P>
<P>All kalpas were complete within the Dharma hall.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As master and disciples walked freely and at their ease up to the
 summit of Vulture Peak lay people could be seen under the green pines,
 and pious men and women amid the jade-coloured cypresses. The venerable
 elder bowed to them politely, whereupon all the lay men and women,
 monks and nuns all hastened to put their hands together and say to him,
 &#8220;Do not bow to us, holy monk. Come back and talk with us when you have
 seen Sakyamuni.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's a bit early for that,&#8221; replied Monkey with a grin. &#8220;Let's go
 and worship the boss.&#8221;</P>
<P>The venerable elder waved his arms and performed a ritual dance as he
 followed Monkey straight to the gates of the Thunder Monastery, where
 four great vajrapanis greeted them with the words, &#8220;Have you arrived
 now, holy monk?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Sanzang replied with a bow, &#8220;Your disciple Xuanzang has
 arrived.&#8221; Having given this reply he was about to go in through the
 gateway.</P>
<P>&#8220;Please wait for a moment, holy monk,&#8221; the vajrapanis said. &#8220;Let us
 report before you come in.&#8221; The vajrapanis sent a report of the Tang
 Priest's arrival to the four great vajrapanis on the middle gates, who
 in turn reported it to the inner gates, inside which were divine monks
 making offerings.</P>
<P>As soon as they heard of the Tang Priest's arrival they all hurried
 to the Mahavira Hall, where they announced to the Tathagata Sakyamuni
 Buddha, &#8220;The holy monk from the Tang Court has arrived at your noble
 monastery to fetch the scriptures.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Lord Buddha was very pleased. He called together his Eight
 Bodhisattvas, Four Vajrapanis, Five Hundred Arhats, Three Thousand
 Protectors, Eleven Heavenly Shiners and Eighteen Guardians, who drew
 themselves up in two lines and passed on the Buddha's command summoning
 the Tang Priest to enter. Thus it was that the invitation was sent down
 from one level to the next: &#8220;Let the holy monk come in.&#8221; Observing the
 requirements of ritual, the Tang Priest went in through the gate with
 Wukong and Wujing, who were leading the horse and carrying the luggage.
 Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In the past he had struggled to fulfil his commission</P>
<P>After leaving the emperor at the steps of the throne.</P>
<P>At dawn he had climbed mountains in mist and in dew;</P>
<P>At dusk he had slept on rocks amid the clouds.</P>
<P>He had carried his stick across three thousand rivers,</P>
<P>And climbed up countless crags with his monastic staff.</P>
<P>His every thought had been set on the true achievement,</P>
<P>And today he was finally to see the Tathagata.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As the four of them arrived in front of the Mahavira Hall they all
 prostrated themselves and kowtowed to the Tathagata, then to their left
 and right. After they had each completed three rounds of Worship they
 then knelt before the Buddha to present their passport. When the
 Tathagata had read it carefully he handed it back to Sanzang, who bowed
 his head low and reported, &#8220;Your disciple Xuanzang has made the long
 journey to your precious monastery at the command of the Great Tang
 emperor to beg for the true scriptures that will save all living
 beings. I implore the Lord Buddha in his goodness to grant them at once
 so that I may return to my country.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Tathagata then opened his compassionate mouth and in the great
 mercy of his heart said to Sanzang, &#8220;Your Eastern land is in the
 Southern Continent of Jambu. As the sky is lofty there, the soil deep,
 its products many, and the people multitudinous there is much
 covetous-ness, murder, debauchery, lying, deception and dishonesty.
 They do not follow the Buddhist teaching, do not turn towards good
 destinies, and do not honour the sun, moon and stars or value the five
 grains. They are not loyal, filial, righteous or kind. In the delusion
 of their hearts they mislead themselves, cheating on weights and
 measures, taking life and killing animals, thus creating such boundless
 evil karma and such a superabundance of sin and evil that they bring
 the catastrophe of hell on themselves. That is why they must fall for
 ever into the dark underworld to suffer the torments of being hammered,
 smashed, ground and pounded, or are reborn as animals. Many of them
 take the shape of furry, horned creatures to pay back the debts they
 owe from earlier lives and feed others with their own flesh. It is for
 such reasons that some fall into the Avici Hell, from which they never
 emerge to be reborn. Although Confucius established the doctrine of
 benevolence, righteousness, correct behavior and wisdom, and although
 successive emperors have applied the penalties of imprisonment, exile
 strangulation and beheading, none of this affected those stupid,
 benighted, self-indulgent and unrestrained people. Why? I have Three
 Stores of scriptures that offer deliverance from suffering and release
 from disaster. Of these Three Stores one is the Store of Dharma that
 deals with Heaven; one is the Store of Sastras that deal with the
 Earth, and one is the Store of Sutras that can save ghosts. There are
 thirty-five scriptures altogether, in 15,144 scrolls. These are indeed
 the path to the truth, the gateway to goodness. They include everything
 about the astronomy, geography, personalities, birds beasts trees,
 flowers, objects of use and human affairs of the world's four
 continents. Now that you have come from afar I would present them all
 to you to take away with you, but the people of your country are stupid
 and coarse. They are slanderers of the truth who cannot understand the
 mysteries of our teachings. Ananda, Kasyapa,&#8221; he called, &#8220;take the four
 of them to the foot of the jewel tower and give them a vegetarian meal.
 After the meal open up the pavilion, select a few rolls from each of
 the thirty-five scriptures in my Three Stores, and tell them to
 propagate these scriptures in the East, where they may eternally grant
 their great goodness.&#8221;</P>
<P>Acting on the orders of the Buddha the two arhats then led the four
 pilgrims to the bottom of the tower, where no end of rare and wonderful
 jewels and treasures were set out. Here the divinities who made
 offerings set out a vegetarian banquet, with immortal food, immortal
 delicacies, immortal tea, immortal fruit, and every kind of culinary
 delight not to be found in the mortal world. Master and disciples bowed
 their heads to the ground in thanks for the Buddha's kindness and
 proceeded to eat to their hearts' content. Indeed</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Precious flames and golden light dazzled the eye,</P>
<P>While the rare incense and delicacies were marvelously fine.</P>
<P>The thousand-storied golden pavilion was infinitely lovely,</P>
<P>And pure sounded immortals' music on the ear.</P>
<P>Meatless food and magic flowers of the sort that are rare on earth,</P>
<P>Fragrant teas and exotic dishes that give eternal life.</P>
<P>After a long period of enduring a thousand kinds of suffering,</P>
<P>Today comes the glorious happiness of the Way completed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This was a piece of good fortune for Pig, and a great, benefit to
 Friar Sand as they ate their fill of the food in the Buddha's land that
 gave eternal life and new flesh and bones for old. The two arhats kept
 the four of them company till the meal was over, after which they went
 to the treasure pavilion, where the doors were opened for them to go in
 and look. Over this all was a thousandfold aura of coloured light and
 auspicious vapors, while brilliant mists and clouds of good omen wafted
 all around. All over the scripture shelves and on the outside of the
 cases were pasted red labels on which were neatly written the titles of
 the scriptures. They were the</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Nirvana sutra 748 rolls</P>
<P>Bodhisattva sutra 1,021 rolls</P>
<P>Akasagarbha sutra 400 rolls</P>

<P>Ratna-prabhava sutra 1,280 rolls</P>
<P>Original Pavilion sutra 850 rolls</P>
<P>Principal vinaya sutra 200 rolls</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Ananda and Kasyapa led the Tang Priest to read the titles of all the
 scriptures.</P>
<P>&#8220;You have come here from the East, holy monk,&#8221; they said to him.
 &#8220;Have you brought us any presents? Hand them over right now, then we
 can give you the scriptures.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Sanzang heard this he said, &#8220;Your disciple Xuanzang has come a
 very long way, and I did not bring any with me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's very fine,&#8221; the two arhats said with a laugh. &#8220;If we hand the
 scriptures over for nothing, they'll be passed down through the ages
 and our successors will have to starve to death.&#8221; Monkey could not
 stand hearing them talking tough like this and refusing to hand the
 scriptures over, so he shouted, &#8220;Let's go and report them to the
 Tathagata, Master. We'll get him to give me the scriptures himself.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Shut up!&#8221; said Kasyapa. &#8220;Where do you think you are, acting up like
 this? Come here and take the scriptures.&#8221; Pig and Friar Sand, who were
 keeping their own tempers under control, calmed Monkey down. They
 turned back to accept the scriptures, which were packed one by one into
 the luggage. Some of it was put on the horse's back, and the rest tied
 up as two carrying-pole loads that Pig and Friar Sand shouldered. They
 all then returned to the Buddha's throne, kowtowed, thanked the
 Tathagata and went straight out. They bowed twice to every Buddha and
 every Bodhisattva they met. When they reached the main entrance they
 bowed to the bhiksus, the bhiksunis, the laymen and the laywomen,
 taking their leave of each one. Then they hurried back down the
 mountain.</P>
<P>The story tells not of them but of the Ancient Buddha Dipamkara, who
 had been quietly listening in the library when the scriptures were
 handed over. He understood perfectly well that Ananda and Kasyapa had
 handed over wordless scriptures. &#8220;Those stupid monks from the East
 didn't realize that those were wordless scriptures,&#8221; he thought with a
 smile to himself. &#8220;The holy monks journey across all those mountains
 and rivers will be a complete waste. Who is in attendance here?&#8221; he
 called, and the arhat Suklavira stepped forward. &#8220;Use your divine
 might,&#8221; Dipamkara instructed him, &#8220;and go after the Tang Priest like a
 shooting star. Take the wordless scriptures from him and tell him to
 come back to fetch the true scriptures.&#8221; The arhat Suklavira then flew
 off on a storm wind that roared away from the Thunder Monastery as he
 gave a great display of his divine might. That splendid wind really was</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A warrior from the Buddha's presence,</P>
<P>Greater than the two wind gods of the Xun quarter.</P>
<P>The angry roars from his divine orifices</P>
<P>Were more powerful by far than the puffs of a young girl.</P>
<P>This wind made</P>
<P>Fish and dragons lose their dens,</P>
<P>While the waves flowed backwards in rivers and seas.</P>
<P>Black apes could not present the fruit they carried;</P>
<P>Yellow cranes turned back to the clouds as they sought their nests.</P>
<P>Ugly rang the song of the red phoenix;</P>
<P>Raucous were the calls of the multicolored pheasants.</P>
<P>The branches of hoary pines were broken</P>
<P>As the flowers of the udumbara blew away.</P>
<P>Every cane of green bamboo bowed low;</P>
<P>All the blooms of golden lotus swayed.</P>
<P>The sound of the bell was carried a thousand miles</P>
<P>While the chanting of sutras flew lightly up the ravines.</P>
<P>Ruined was the beauty of flowers under the crag;</P>
<P>The tender shoots of plants were laid low by the path</P>
<P>The brilliant phoenixes could hardly spread their wings;</P>
<P>White deer hid beneath the cliffs.</P>
<P>The heavens were heavy with fragrance</P>
<P>As the clear wind blew right through the clouds.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Tang Priest was walking along when he smelt the fragrant wind,
 but he paid no attention to it, taking it for an auspicious sign of the
 Lord Buddha. Then a noise could be heard as a hand reached down from
 midair to lift the scriptures lightly off the horse's back, which gave
 Sanzang such a shock that he beat his chest and howled aloud. Pig
 scrambled along in pursuit, Friar Sand guarded the carrying-poles
 loaded with scriptures, and Brother Monkey flew after the arhat. Seeing
 that Monkey had almost caught up with him, and frightened that the
 merciless cudgel would make no bones about wounding him badly, the
 arhat tore the bundle of scriptures to shreds and flung it into the
 dust. When Monkey saw the bundle falling in pieces that were being
 scattered by the fragrant wind he stopped chasing the arhat and brought
 his cloud down to look after the scriptures. The arhat Suklavira put
 the wind and the clouds away, then went back to report to Dipamkara.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Pig, who was also in pursuit, saw the scriptures falling he
 helped Monkey to collect them up and carry them back to the Tang
 Priest. &#8220;Disciples,&#8221; the Tang Priest exclaimed, tears pouring from his
 eyes, &#8220;even in this world of bliss evil demons cheat people.&#8221; After
 gathering up the scattered scriptures in his arms Friar Sand opened one
 of them up and saw that it was as white as snow: not a word was written
 on it.</P>
<P>Quickly he handed it to Sanzang with the remark, &#8220;There's nothing in
 this scroll, Master.&#8221; Monkey opened out another scroll to find that it
 had nothing written in it either. Pig opened another and it too had
 nothing in it.</P>
<P>&#8220;Open them all for us to examine,&#8221; said Sanzang. Every single scroll
 was blank paper.</P>
<P>&#8220;We Easterners really do have no luck,&#8221; he said, sighing and
 groaning. &#8220;What point is there in fetching wordless scriptures like
 these? How could I ever face the Tang emperor? I will have no way of
 avoiding execution for the crime of lying to my sovereign.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey, who already understood what had happened, then said to the
 Tang Priest, &#8220;Say no more, Master. Ananda and Kasyapa gave us these
 scrolls of blank paper because we hadn't got any presents to give them
 when they asked for them. Let's go back, report them to the Tathagata
 and get them accused of extortion.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's right,&#8221; shouted Pig, &#8220;that's right. Let's report them.&#8221; The
 four of them then hurried up the mountain again, and after a few steps
 they were rushing back to the Thunder Monastery.</P>
<P>Before long they were once more outside the gates of the monastery,
 where everyone raised their clasped hands in greeting. &#8220;Have you holy
 monks come to exchange your scriptures?&#8221; they asked with smiles.
 Sanzang nodded and expressed his thanks. The vajrapanis did not block
 them, but let them go straight in to the Mahavira Hall.</P>
<P>&#8220;Tathagata,&#8221; yelled Monkey, &#8220;our master and the rest of us have had
 to put up with endless monsters, demons, troubles and hardships to get
 here from the East to worship you. You gave the orders for the
 scriptures to be handed over, but Ananda and Kasyapa didn't do so
 because they were trying to extort things from us. They conspired and
 deliberately let us take away blank paper versions without a single
 word written on them. But what's the point in taking those? I beg you
 to have them punished, Tathagata.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop yelling,&#8221; replied the Lord Buddha with a smile. &#8220;I already know
 that they asked you for presents. But the scriptures cannot be casually
 passed on. Nor can they be taken away for nothing. In the past bhiksus
 and holy monks went down the mountain and recited these scriptures to
 the family of the elder Zhao in the land of Sravasti. This ensured
 peace and safety for the living and deliverance for the dead members of
 the family. All that was asked for was three bushels and three pecks of
 granular gold. I said they had sold the scriptures too cheap, so I saw
 to it that Zhao's sons and grandsons would be poor. You were given
 blank texts because you came here to fetch them empty-handed. The blank
 texts are true, wordless scriptures, and they really are good. But as
 you living beings in the East are so deluded and have not achieved
 enlightenment we'll have to give you these ones instead. Ananda,
 Kasyapa,&#8221; he called, &#8220;fetch the true scriptures with words at once.
 Choose a few rolls from each title to give them, then come back here
 and tell me how many.&#8221;</P>
<P>The two arhats then led the four pilgrims to the foot of the library
 building and once again asked the Tang Priest for a present. Having
 nothing else to offer, he ordered friar Sand to bring out the begging
 bowl of purple gold and presented it with both hands. &#8220;Your disciple is
 poor and has come a very long way,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I did not bring any
 presents with me. This bowl was given to me by the Tang emperor with
 his own hands to beg for food with on my journey. I now offer it to you
 as a token of my heartfelt feelings. I beg you arhats not to despise it
 but to keep it. When I return to my court I shall report this to the
 Tang emperor, who will certainly reward you richly. I only ask you to
 give me the true scriptures that have words to save me from failing in
 my imperial mission and making this long, hard journey for nothing.&#8221;</P>
<P>Ananda accepted the bowl with no more than a hint of a smile. The
 warriors guarding the precious library building, the kitchen staff
 responsible for the spices and the arhats in charge of the library
 rubbed each other's faces, patted each other's backs, flicked each
 other with their fingers and pulled faces.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disgraceful,&#8221; they all said with grins, &#8220;disgraceful. Demanding
 presents from the pilgrims who've come to fetch the scriptures!&#8221; A
 moment later Ananda was frowning with embarrassment but still holding
 the bowl and not letting go. Only then did Kasyapa go into the library
 to check the scriptures through one by one and give them to Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciples,&#8221; called Sanzang, &#8220;take a good look at them, not like last
 time.&#8221; The three of them took the rolls and examined them one by one.
 All had words. 5,048 rolls were handed over, the total in a single
 store. They were neatly packed up and put on the horse, and those left
 over were made into a carrying-pole load for Pig to take. Friar Sand
 carried their own luggage, and as Brother Monkey led the horse the Tang
 Priest took his staff, pushed his Vairocana mitre into position, shook
 his brocade cassock, and went happily into the presence of the
 Tathagata. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sweet taste the True Scriptures of the Great Store,</P>
<P>Created fine and majestic by the Tathagata.</P>
<P>Remember what Xuanzang suffered to climb this mountain:</P>
<P>Ananda's greed was something ridiculous.</P>
<P>What they did not notice at first Dipamkara helped them to see;</P>
<P>Later the scriptures were real and they then found peace.</P>
<P>Successful now, they would take the scriptures to the East;</P>
<P>Where all could be refreshed by their life-giving richness.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Ananda and Kasyapa led the Tang Priest to see the Tathagata, who
 ascended his lotus throne and directed the two great arhats
 Dragon-queller and Tiger-subduer to strike the cloud-ringing stone
 chimes that summoned all the Three Thousand Buddhas, Three Thousand
 Protectors, Eight Vajrapanis, Four Bodhisattvas, Five Hundred Arhats,
 Eight Hundred Bhiksus, the host of laymen, bhiksunis, laywomen, and the
 greater and lesser honoured ones and holy monks of every cave, every
 heaven, the blessed lands and the magic mountains. Those who were
 supposed to sit were asked to ascend their precious thrones, and those
 who were supposed to stand stood on either side. All of a sudden
 heavenly music rang out from afar and magical sounds wafted around. The
 air was full of countless beams of auspicious light and of aura upon
 aura as all the Buddhas gathered together to pay their respects to the
 Tathagata.</P>
<P>&#8220;How many rolls of scripture have you given them, Ananda and
 Kasyapa?&#8221; the Tathagata asked. &#8220;Please tell me the numbers one by one.&#8221;</P>
<P>The two arhats then reported, &#8220;We are now handing over for the Tang
 court the</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Nirvana sutra&#8212;400 rolls</P>
<P>Bodhisattva sutra&#8212;360 rolls</P>
<P>Akasagarbha sutra&#8212;20 rolls</P>
<P>Surangama sutra&#8212;30 rolls</P>
<P>Collection of sutras on the meaning of grace&#8212;40 rolls</P>
<P>Determination sutra&#8212;40 rolls</P>
<P>Ratnagarbha sutra&#8212;20 rolls</P>
<P>Avatamsaka sutra&#8212;81 rolls</P>
<P>Sutra on Worshipping Bhutatathata&#8212;30 rolls</P>
<P>Mahaprajnaparamita sutra&#8212;600 rolls</P>
<P>Mahaprabhasa sutra&#8212;50 rolls</P>
<P>Adbhuta-dharma sutras&#8212;550 rolls</P>
<P>Vimalakirti sutra&#8212;30 rolls</P>
<P>The Three Sastras&#8212;42 rolls</P>
<P>Diamond sutra&#8212;1 rolls</P>
<P>Saddharma sastra&#8212;20 rolls</P>
<P>Buddhacaritakavya sutra&#8212;116 rolls</P>

<P>Precious Eternity sutra&#8212;170 rolls</P>
<P>Sutra on the Western Heaven&#8212;30 rolls</P>
<P>Samghika sutra&#8212;110 rolls</P>
<P>Samyukta-Buddhadesa sutra&#8212;1,638 rolls</P>
<P>Mahayana-sraddhotpadasa sastra&#8212;50 rolls</P>
<P>Great Wisdom sutra&#8212;90 rolls</P>

<P>Vynaptimatra-tasiddhi sastra&#8212;10 rolls</P>
<P>Abhidharma-kosa sastra&#8212;10 rolls</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>From the thirty-five scriptures in all of the stores we have selected
 5,048 rolls to give to the holy monk. These will be kept and handed
 down in Tang. They have now all been packed neatly and put on the horse
 or made into carrying-pole loads. The pilgrims are only waiting to
 express their thanks.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang and his three followers then tethered the horse, put down the
 loads, joined their hands in front of their chests and bowed in
 worship.</P>
<P>&#8220;The achievement of these scriptures is immeasurable,&#8221; the Tathagata
 said to the Tang Priest, &#8220;Although they are the source of foreknowledge
 and reflection for my school they are truly the origin of all Three
 Schools. If they reach your Southern Continent of Jambudvipa they must
 not be treated with disrespect when they are shown to all living
 beings. Nobody who has not bathed, avoided eating meat and observed the
 prohibitions may open the rolls. Treasure them. Honour them. They
 include the esoteric mysteries of the way of immortality and wonderful
 methods for discovering all transformations.&#8221; Kowtowing in thanks,
 Sanzang faith fully accepted these instructions and determined to carry
 them out, did three more circuits of homage round the Lord Buddha then
 with dutiful and sincere obedience accepted the scriptures and went out
 with them through the third of the monastery gates, where he thanked
 all the holy beings one by one again. Of him we will say no more.</P>
<P>After sending the Tang Priest on his way the Tathagata dissolved the
 assembly that had been called to pass on the scriptures. The
 Bodhisattva Guanyin then stepped forward from the side, put her hands
 together and submitted to the lord Buddha, &#8220;It has been fourteen years
 from the time when your disciple went to the East that year to find the
 man who would fetch the scriptures to his success today. That makes
 5,040 days. May the World-honoured One allow the holy monks to go back
 East from the West within eight days, so as to complete the number of
 rolls in one store, and then your disciple may report his mission as
 completed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What you say is quite right,&#8221; replied the Tathagata with delight.
 &#8220;You are permitted to report the completion of your mission.&#8221; With that
 he instructed the Eight Vajrapanis, &#8220;You are to use your divine might
 to escort the holy monks back to the East, where they will hand the
 true scriptures over to be kept there. After escorting the holy monks
 back, you may return to the West. This must be done within eight days
 in order to match the number of rolls in one store. There must be no
 disobedience or delay.&#8221; The vajrapanis caught up with the Tang Priest.
 &#8220;Come with us, scripture-fetchers,&#8221; they called; and the Tang Priest
 and the others became light and strong as they floated up on clouds
 after the vajrapanis. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Nature revealed and mind made clear, they visited the Buddha;</P>
<P>Actions complete and all achieved, they flew aloft.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you do not know how they passed on the scriptures after returning
 to the East, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<P>The story goes on to tell how the Eight Vajrapanis escorted the Tang
 Priest back to their country, but we will not go into that now.</P>
<P>Outside the gates the Protectors of the Four Quarters and the Centre,
 the Four Duty Gods, the Six Dings, the Six Jias and the Guardians of
 the Faith went up to the Bodhisattva Guanyin and said, &#8220;We, your
 disciples, have given secret help to the holy monk in obedience to your
 dharma command, Bodhisattva. Now that they have fulfilled their deeds
 and you have reported your mission accomplished to the Lord Buddha, we
 would like to report the completion of our mission.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Permission granted.&#8221; The Bodhisattva replied with delight,
 &#8220;permission granted.&#8221; The Bodhisattva then went on to ask, &#8220;What were
 the thoughts and actions of the Tang Priest and his three disciples on
 their journey?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They really were pious and determined,&#8221; the deities all replied, &#8220;as
 we are sure will not have escaped your profound perception. But the
 Tang Priest's sufferings truly beggar description. Your disciples have
 made a careful record of the disasters and hardships that he has
 endured on his journey. This is the account of his ordeals.&#8221; The
 Bodhisattva read it through from the beginning, and this is what was
 written in it:</P>

<P>Casting of the body at the Lingyun Crossing was the eightieth ordeal;</P>
<P>The journey was one of 36,000 miles,</P>
<P>And the ordeals of the holy monk are all clearly recorded.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Casting her eyes over the record, the Bodhisattva quickly said, &#8220;In
 the Buddha's school 'nine nines' are needed before one can come to the
 truth. The eighty ordeals that the holy monk has endured are one short
 of the full number. &#8220;Go after the vajrapanis,&#8221; she ordered a protector,
 &#8220;and tell them to create another ordeal.&#8221; The protector headed East by
 cloud as soon as he was given this order, and after a day and a night
 he caught up with the Eight Vajrapanis. &#8220;It's like this, you see,&#8221; he
 said, whispering in their ears in explanation, adding, &#8220;so you must do
 as the Bodhisattva commands and not disobey.&#8221; When the Eight Vajrapanis
 heard this they stopped the wind with a swishing sound and dropped the
 four of them to the ground, horse, scriptures and all. Oh dear! It was
 a case of</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Way of reaching the truth through the nine nines is hard;</P>
<P>Hold fast to your determination to stand at the mysterious pass.</P>
<P>Only through rigorous effort can the demons be repelled;</P>
<P>Perseverance is essential to the true Dharma's return.</P>
<P>Do not mistake the scriptures for something easily won;</P>
<P>Of many a kind were the hardships endured by the holy monk.</P>
<P>The marvellous union has always been hard to achieve:</P>
<P>The slightest mistake and the elixir will not be made.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As his feet touched common ground Sanzang felt alarmed. &#8220;Marvellous,&#8221;
 said Pig, roaring with laughter, &#8220;just marvellous! It's a case of more
 haste less speed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It really is marvellous,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;They're giving us a rest
 here after going so fast.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As the saying goes,&#8221; remarked the Great Sage, &#8220;'Wait ten days on a
 sandbank, then cross nine in a single day.'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop arguing, you three,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;Find out which way we have
 come and where we are.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We're here!&#8221; said Friar Sand after looking all around, &#8220;We're here!
 Listen to the water, Master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;From the sound of the water I suppose it must be your family home,&#8221;
 observed Brother Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;His home is the River of Flowing Sands,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;No, it's not that,&#8221; replied Friar Sand. &#8220;It's the River of Heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Take a careful look at the other side, disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang, at
 which Monkey sprang into the air, shaded his eyes with his hand, and
 took a careful look around. &#8220;Master,&#8221; he said after coming down again,
 &#8220;this is the West bank of the River of Heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I remember now,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;On the East bank there is Chen
 Family Village. When we came here the other year they were so grateful
 to us for rescuing their son and daughter that they wanted to build a
 boat to take us across, but the White Soft-shelled Turtle carried us
 over. As I recall, there was no sign of human life anywhere on the West
 bank. Whatever are we to do now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They say that common mortals can be sinners,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;but the
 vajrapanis who serve the Buddha in person are too. The Buddha ordered
 them to bring us back East, so why have they dropped us half way home?
 We're stuck here now. How ever are we going to get over?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop complaining, brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;Our master has found
 the Way. He cast off his mortal body at the Cloud-touching Crossing, so
 he won't possibly fall into the water now. Our big brother and we two
 can all do levitation magic, so we can carry the master across.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey laughed to himself under his breath as he replied, &#8220;We can't
 do it, we can't do it.&#8221; Why do you think he said that they couldn't do
 it? If he had been prepared to use his divine powers and give away the
 secret of flying then master and disciples would have been able to
 cross a thousand rivers. But he understood that as the Tang Priest had
 not yet completed the nine nines he was fated to undergo another
 ordeal, which was why he had been held up here.</P>
<P>Talking as they walked slowly along, master and disciples headed
 straight to the river-bank, where all of a sudden they heard someone
 calling, &#8220;This way, Tang Priest, this way!&#8221; They were all surprised,
 and when they looked up there was no sign of anyone around, and no boat
 either.</P>
<P>There was only a big, white, scabby-headed soft-shelled turtle
 raising its head by the bank and calling, &#8220;Master, I have been waiting
 for you all these years. Why have you only just come back?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We troubled you in the past, old turtle,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile,
 &#8220;and this year we meet again.&#8221; Sanzang, Pig and Friar Sand were all
 delighted.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you really do want to look after us, come ashore,&#8221; Monkey said,
 at which the turtle climbed out of the river with a bound. Monkey had
 the horse tied to the turtle with Pig squatting behind the horse's
 tail. The Tang Priest stood to the left of the horse's neck and Friar
 Sand to its right, while Monkey stood with one foot on the turtle's
 neck and the other on his head.</P>
<P>&#8220;Take it easy and take it steady,&#8221; he said. The turtle strode across
 the water just as if his four feet were walking on flat land, carrying
 the master and his three disciples, five of them altogether including
 the horse, straight back to the Eastern bank. This was Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The mystery of the Dharma within the unique sect:</P>
<P>When the demons are all defeated man and heaven are made known.</P>
<P>Only now can the original face be seen,</P>
<P>And the causes of the one body all be complete.</P>
<P>Hold to the Three Vehicles to come and go at will;</P>
<P>After the elixir's nine transformations you may do what you like.</P>
<P>Carry your bundle, let your staff fly, and understand the
 inexpressible;</P>
<P>Lucky they were on their return to meet the Ancient Turtle.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Carrying them on his back, the Ancient Soft-shelled Turtle walked
 across the waves for the best part of a day. It was nearly evening
 when, as they approached the East bank, he suddenly asked, &#8220;Venerable
 master, some years ago I begged you when you reached the West and saw
 our Tathagata Buddha to ask him when I would be converted and how long
 I would live.&#8221;</P>
<P>Now ever since the venerable elder had reached the Western Heaven,
 bathed in the Jade Truth Temple, cast off his mortal body at the
 Cloud-touching Crossing and walked up the Vulture Peak, his heart had
 been set only on worshipping the Buddha; and when he met all the
 Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, holy monks and others his whole mind had been
 devoted to fetching the scriptures. He had given no attention to
 anything else, and so had not asked about how long the Ancient Turtle
 would live. Having nothing he could say, and not daring to lie to or
 deceive the turtle, Sanzang was quiet for a long time and gave no
 reply. When the turtle realized that Sanzang had not asked the
 questions on his behalf he gave a shake of his head and submerged with
 a loud splash, dropping the four of them, horse, scriptures and all,
 into the water.</P>
<P>Oh dear! But luckily the Tang Priest had cast off his mortal body and
 achieved the Way. If he had still been as he had before he would have
 sunk to the bottom. It was also lucky that the white horse was a
 dragon, that Pig and Friar Sand could swim, and that Brother Monkey
 gave a smiling and magnificent display of his great magic powers as he
 lifted the Tang Priest out of the water and up the East bank. The only
 thing was that the bundles of scriptures, the clothes and the saddle
 were all soaked.</P>
<P>Master and disciples had climbed up the bank to get themselves sorted
 out when a sudden fierce wind blew up, the sky turned dark, and amid
 thunder and lightning stones and sand flew all around. This is what
 could be seen:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A wind</P>
<P>Throwing heaven and earth into chaos;</P>
<P>Thunder</P>
<P>Rocking mountains and rivers;</P>
<P>Lightning</P>
<P>Flying like fire through the clouds;</P>
<P>Mists</P>
<P>Covering all of the earth.</P>
<P>The wind howled;</P>
<P>Loud roared the thunder.</P>
<P>The lightning streaked red,</P>
<P>While clouds blocked out the moon and the stars.</P>
<P>The wind-blown dust drove into the face,</P>
<P>And tigers and leopards hid in terror.</P>
<P>The lightning flashes set birds cawing,</P>
<P>And tress all vanished in the spreading mists.</P>
<P>The wind whipped up the waves of the River of Heaven;</P>
<P>The thunder terrified the fish and dragons in the River of Heaven;</P>
<P>The lightning lit up the whole of River of Heaven;</P>
<P>The mists enshrouded in darkness the banks of the River of Heaven.</P>
<P>Splendid wind!</P>
<P>Mountains toppled; pines and bamboo fell.</P>
<P>Splendid thunder!</P>
<P>Its majesty alarmed insects and spread terror.</P>
<P>Splendid lightning!</P>
<P>It moved across the sky and lit up the wilds like golden snakes.</P>
<P>Splendid mist!</P>
<P>Darkening the whole of space, obscuring the nine heavens.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This alarmed Sanzang, who pressed down on the bundles of scriptures,
 while Friar Sand held down their carrying-pole and Pig clung to the
 white horse. Monkey, however, swung his iron cudgel around with both
 hands as he kept guard to both right and left.</P>
<P>Now the wind, mist, thunder and lightning were all signals made by
 evil demons who wanted to steal the scriptures that had been fetched.
 They tried all night to grab them until the dawn; only then did they
 stop.</P>
<P>The venerable elder, whose clothes were all soaking wet, shivered and
 shook as he said, &#8220;How did all this start, Wukong?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; Brother Monkey replied, snorting with fury, &#8220;you don't
 understand the inner truth. By escorting you to fetch these scriptures
 we have won the great achievement of heaven and earth. You will enjoy
 perpetual youth, and your dharma body will never decay. This is
 something heaven and earth can't stand for, and the demons and gods
 detest. They wanted to come and steal them in the darkness. But because
 the scriptures were soaked through and your true dharma body was
 holding them down, the thunder could not bombard them, the lightning
 could not illuminate them and the mist could not obscure them. It was
 also because I whirled my iron cudgel around to make its pure Positive
 nature protect them. Since dawn the Positive has been in the ascendant
 again, which is why they can't take them now.&#8221;</P>
<P>Only then did Sanzang, Pig and Friar Sand realize what had happened
 and all express unbounded thanks. A little later, when the sun was
 shining from high in the sky, they took the scriptures to the top of a
 high cliff, opened the bundles and put them out to dry. The rocks on
 which the scriptures were dried in the sun remain there to this day.
 Then they spread their clothes and shoes out to dry beside the cliff
 while they stood there, sat down, or leapt around. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The pure Positive body was happy in the sun,</P>
<P>When Negative demons dared not use their might.</P>
<P>Even when water is dominant the true scriptures will win,</P>
<P>Not fearing wind or thunder, lightning, mist or light.</P>
<P>After this clarification they come to the true perception;</P>
<P>From now on they will reach the immortals' land in peace.</P>
<P>On the rocks where the scriptures were dried their traces still
 remain;</P>
<P>Never again will any demons come back to this place.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As the four of them were checking through the scriptures and drying
 them in the sun one by one some fishermen who were passing the river
 bank lifted up their heads and saw them there.</P>
<P>One of the fishermen recognized them and said, &#8220;Venerable teachers,
 didn't you cross this river the other year when you were on your way to
 the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;that's right. Where are you from? How did you
 know who we are?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We're from Chen Village,&#8221; the fisherman replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;How far is Chen Village from here?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's seven miles South from this gulch,&#8221; the fisherman said.</P>
<P>&#8220;Let's take the scriptures to Chen Village and dry them there,&#8221; said
 Pig. &#8220;There's somewhere we can stay there, and we'll be able to get
 something to eat. Besides, we can get their family to wash our clothes.
 That'll be best, won't it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We will not go there,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;When we have dried everything
 here we can pack up and find our way back.&#8221;</P>
<P>The fishermen, who passed the gulch to the South, happened to meet
 Chen Cheng. &#8220;You two old gentlemen,&#8221; they called, &#8220;the teachers who
 went to be sacrificed instead of your children the other year have come
 back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where did you see them?&#8221; Chen Cheng asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Drying their scriptures in the sun on the rocks,&#8221; the fishermen
 replied.</P>
<P>Chen Cheng then took several of his tenants across the gulch, saw the
 pilgrims, and hurried towards them to kneel and say, &#8220;My lords, now
 that you are coming back with your scriptures, your achievement
 completed and your deeds done, why don't you come to my house? Why are
 you hanging around here? Won't you please come straight to the house?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We'll go with you when we've dried our scriptures in the sun,&#8221;
 Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;How did your scriptures and clothes all get wet, my lords?&#8221; Chen
 Cheng asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The other year the White soft-shelled Turtle kindly carried us West
 across the river,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;and this year he carried us across
 it Eastwards. We were approaching the bank when he put some questions
 to me about the enquiries he had asked me to make with the Lord Buddha
 about how long he would live. Now I never made this enquiry, so he
 soaked us all in the water. That was how they got wet.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang then told the whole story in all its details, and as Chen
 Cheng was so sincere in pressing his invitation Sanzang could do
 nothing but pack up the scriptures. As it was not realized that the
 ends of several rolls of the<I> Buddhacaritakavya sutra</I> had stuck
 to the rock when wet, the ends were torn off, which is why the<I>
 Buddhacaritakavya sutra</I> is incomplete to this day and there are
 still traces of writing on the rocks where the scriptures were dried in
 the sun.</P>
<P>&#8220;We were careless,&#8221; Sanzang said with remorse. &#8220;We did not pay enough
 attention.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're wrong,&#8221; said Monkey with a laugh, &#8220;you're wrong. Heaven and
 earth are incomplete and this scripture used to be complete. Now it's
 been soaked and torn to fulfil the mystery of incompleteness. This is
 not something that could have been achieved through human effort.&#8221; When
 master and disciples had finished packing the surras they returned with
 Chen Chang to his village.</P>
<P>In the village one person told ten, ten told a hundred, and a hundred
 a thousand, till all of them, young and old, came out to welcome and
 see the pilgrims. As soon as Chen Qing heard of it he had an incense
 table set out to greet them in front of the gates; he also ordered
 drummers and players of wind instruments to perform. A moment later the
 travelers arrived and were welcomed and taken inside. Chen Qing led out
 his whole household to greet them with bows and thank them for their
 earlier kindness in saving their son and daughter. Tea and a vegetarian
 meal were then ordered; but since receiving the immortal food and
 immortal delicacies of the Lord Buddha and casting off his mortal body
 to become a Buddha, Sanzang had lost all desire for mortals' food. As
 the two old men's urgings were so insistent, he took some of the food
 as a mark of gratitude.</P>
<P>The Great Sage Monkey had never been one to eat cooked food, so he
 said, &#8220;That will be enough.&#8221;</P>
<P>Friar Sand did not eat either, and even Pig was not the Pig he used
 to be: he soon put his bowl down.</P>
<P>&#8220;Aren't you eating any more either, idiot?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I don't know why,&#8221; Pig said, &#8220;but my stomach's gone weak all of a
 sudden.&#8221; The vegetarian banquet was then cleared away as the old men
 asked about how they had fetched the scriptures. Sanzang then gave them
 a detailed account that started with the bath in the Jade Truth Temple
 and the lightening of their bodies at Cloud-touching Crossing and went
 on to tell how they had seen the Tathagata at Thunder Monastery, been
 feasted at the jeweled tower, given the scriptures in the precious
 library&#8212;wordless scriptures at first because when the two arhats had
 demanded presents they had refused them&#8212;had gone back to pay their
 respects to the Tathagata again to be given the number of rolls in a
 single store, had been plunged into the water by the White Soft-shelled
 Turtle, and nearly had the scriptures stolen in the darkness by evil
 spirits. After telling all this Sanzang took his leave.</P>
<P>But the whole family of the two old men was not at all willing to let
 them go. &#8220;We have been under a great debt to you for saving our
 children that we have not yet been able to repay,&#8221; they said. &#8220;We have
 built a Temple of Deliverance where incense has been burned to you ever
 since without ceasing.&#8221; Then they called out the children in whose
 place Monkey and Pig had gone to be sacrificed, Chen Guan-given and Pan
 of Gold, to kowtow in thanks and ask them into the shrine to take a
 look. Sanzang then put the bundles of scriptures in front of the hall
 of their house and read them one roll of the<I> Precious Eternity
 sutra.</I> Then they went to the temple, where the Chens had set out
 delicacies. Before the pilgrims could sit down another group of people
 came to invite them to another meal, and before they could pick up
 their chopsticks yet another group came with a third invitation. This
 went on and on without end, so that they had no chance to eat properly.
 Sanzang, who dared not decline the invitations, had to make gestures of
 eating. The shrine was indeed most handsomely built:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The gateway was thickly painted in red</P>
<P>Thanks to the generous donors.</P>
<P>A tower rose there</P>
<P>Where houses with a pair of cloisters had now been built.</P>
<P>Red were the doors</P>
<P>And the Seven Treasures were finely carved.</P>
<P>Incense floated up to the clouds;</P>
<P>Pure light filled the vault of space.</P>
<P>Some tender cypress saplings were still being watered;</P>
<P>A number of pine trees did not yet form a grove.</P>
<P>Living waters met one in front</P>
<P>Where the waves of the River of Heaven were rolling;</P>
<P>High cliffs rose behind</P>
<P>Where range upon range of mountains joined the earth dragon.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Sanzang has seen everything he climbed the high tower, where
 statues of the four pilgrims had been placed. &#8220;Looks just like you,
 brother,&#8221; said pig, tugging at Monkey, when he saw them.</P>
<P>&#8220;Second brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;Your statue's just like you too.
 The only thing is that the master's is too good-looking.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It is very good,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;it is very good.&#8221; They then came
 downstairs, where people were still waiting, and urged them to eat the
 vegetarian food that was set out in the hall and in the cloisters
 behind it.</P>
<P>&#8220;What happened to the Great King's Temple that used to be here?&#8221;
 Brother Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;It was demolished that year,&#8221; the old men replied. &#8220;My lords, we
 have had good harvests every year since this monastery was established,
 thanks to your lordships' blessed protection.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That was heaven's gift,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile, &#8220;nothing to do
 with us. But after we have gone this time I guarantee that the families
 in your village will have many sons and grandsons, flourishing
 livestock, wind and rain at the right time year in and year out, and
 rain and wind year out and year in at the right time.&#8221; The people all
 kowtowed in thanks.</P>
<P>What could then be seen were a countless number of people lined up
 behind each other to offer fruit and other vegetarian food. &#8220;I'll be
 blowed,&#8221; said Pig with a laugh. &#8220;In the old days, when I could eat,
 nobody ever asked me to do so ten times over. But now, when I can't,
 one family won't wait for another to finish before offering me food.&#8221;</P>
<P>Although he was feeling full he did get going a little and ate eight
 or nine meatless dishes; and despite having an injured stomach he also
 downed twenty or thirty steamed breadrolls. When they were all full,
 more people came with further invitations. &#8220;Grateful though I am for
 your great affection,&#8221; Sanzang said, &#8220;I do not deserve it. I hope that
 we may be allowed to rest tonight. Tomorrow morning we will accept some
 more.&#8221;</P>
<P>It was now late at night. Sanzang, who was guarding the true
 scriptures and would not leave them for a moment, sat in meditation at
 the foot of the tower to keep a vigil. As the third watch of the night
 approached he said quietly, &#8220;Wukong, the people here know that we have
 found the Way and completed our undertaking. As the old saying goes,
 'The true adept does not show his face; who shows his face is no true
 adept.' I am afraid that if we tarry too long here that we may fail in
 our main enterprise.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What you say is right, Master,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Let's slip quietly
 away in the middle of the night while they're all sound asleep.&#8221; Pig
 too understood, Friar Sand comprehended very clearly, and the white
 horse also knew what he meant. So they got up, quietly loaded the
 packs, shouldered the poles, and carried the things out along the
 cloister. When they reached the main gates and found them locked Monkey
 used unlocking magic to open the inner gates and the main gates. They
 followed the path East, only to hear the Eight Vajrapanis calling from
 mid-air. &#8220;Come with us, escapers.&#8221; The venerable elder then smelt
 incense as he rose up into the air. This was indeed a case of:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the elixir is formed one sees the original face;</P>
<P>When the body is strong one can then visit one's sovereign.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you do not know how he saw the Tang emperor, listen to the
 explanation in the next installment.</P>

<P></P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="1_0_101">Chapter 100</A></H3>
<P>The Journey Back to the East Is Made</P>
<P>The Five Immortals Achieve Nirvana</P>
</B>
<P>We will tell not of how the four travelers escaped and rose on the
 wind with the vajrapanis, but of the many people in the Temple of
 Deliverance in Chen Village. After they rose at dawn to prepare more
 fruit and delicacies to offer they came to the ground floor of the
 tower and found the Tang Priest gone. Some asked questions and others
 searched. They were all thrown into panic and did not know what to do.</P>
<P>&#8220;We've let those living Buddhas all get clean away,&#8221; they lamented as
 their howls rose to the skies. As there was nothing else they could do
 about it they carried all the food they had prepared to the ground
 floor of the tower as offerings and burned imitation paper money. From
 then on four major sacrifices and twenty-four minor sacrifices were
 held every year. In addition people praying for cures or safety,
 seeking marriages, making vows, and seeking wealth or sons came at
 every hour of every day to bum incense and make offerings. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Incense smoked in the golden burner for a thousand years;</P>
<P>The light burned in the lamps of jade through eternity.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We will say no more of this, but tell of how the Eight Vajrapanis
 used a second fragrant wind to carry the four pilgrims off again. Some
 days later they reached the East, and Chang'an came gradually into
 view. Now after seeing the Tang Priest off from the city on the twelfth
 day of the ninth month in the thirteenth year of<I> Then Guan</I> the
 Emperor Taizong had in the sixteenth year sent officials of his
 Department of Works to build a Watching For the Scriptures Tower
 outside the city of Chang'an to receive the scriptures. Here Taizong
 went in person every year. It so happened that on the very day the
 emperor went to the tower the Western sky was filled with auspicious
 light and gusts of scented wind.</P>
<P>&#8220;Holy monk,&#8221; the vajrapanis said, stopping in mid air, &#8220;this is the
 city of Chang'an. We cannot come down as the people here are too
 clever: we are afraid that they might give away what we look like. The
 Great Sage Monkey and the other two gentlemen cannot go there either.
 You must go there yourself to hand the scriptures to your monarch then
 come back here. We will be waiting for you up in the clouds ready to go
 to report back on your mission.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Although what you respected gentlemen say is right,&#8221; replied the
 Great Sage, &#8220;how could my master possibly shoulder the pole for
 carrying the scriptures? And how could he lead this horse? We'll have
 to take him there. May I trouble you to wait a moment up in the air? We
 wouldn't dare keep you waiting.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The other day the Bodhisattva Guanyin informed the Tathagata,&#8221; the
 vajrapanis replied, &#8220;that the return journey would take only eight
 days, so as to make up the number of rolls of scriptures in the
 Tripitaka. We have already spent over four days, and we are worried
 that Pig will be so greedy for blessings and honors that he will make
 us overrun the time limit.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The master's a Buddha now,&#8221; Pig replied with a smile, &#8220;and I want to
 become one too. So why should I want to be greedy? Cheeky great fools!
 Wait here while we hand the scriptures over, then we'll come back to
 return with you.&#8221; The idiot then shouldered a pole while Friar Sand
 held the horse and Brother Monkey led the holy monk as they brought
 their cloud down to land beside the Watching For the Scriptures Tower.</P>
<P>When Taizong and his officials all saw this they came down to greet
 the travelers with the words, &#8220;You are back, Imperial Younger Brother.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Tang Priest fell to the ground in a kowtow, only to be helped
 back to his feet by Taizong, who asked, &#8220;Who are these three?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They are disciples I took on along the way,&#8221; Sanzang replied.
 Taizong was delighted.</P>
<P>&#8220;Harness the horses to our imperial carriage,&#8221; he ordered his aides,
 &#8220;and invite the Imperial Younger Brother to mount his steed and return
 to the palace with us.&#8221; The Tang Priest thanked him and mounted his
 horse. The Great Sage followed closely behind, whirling his golden
 cudgel. Pig and Friar Sand led the horse and shouldered the pole as
 they followed the emperor back to Chang'an. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In that year of peace and rising prosperity</P>
<P>Civil and military officials are calm and magnificent.</P>
<P>At a land and water mass the clergy displayed the dharma;</P>
<P>The monarch commands his ministers in the throne hall of the palace.</P>
<P>A passport was given to Tang Sanzang;</P>
<P>The primal cause of the scriptures has been matched to the Five</P>
<P>Elements.</P>
<P>Through painful tempering all monsters have been destroyed;</P>
<P>Now he returns in triumph to the capital.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Tang Priest and his three disciples followed the imperial
 carriage back to the palace. Everybody in the capital knew that the
 pilgrim who had gone to fetch the scriptures had now returned.</P>
<P>When the monks, young and old, of the Hongfu Monastery in Chang'an
 where the Tang Priest used to live saw that the tops of a number of
 pine trees were all leaning towards the East they exclaimed in
 astonishment, &#8220;Odd, very odd! There's been no wind today, so why are
 the tops of these trees all bent?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Fetch our vestments at once,&#8221; said one of them who was a former
 disciple of Sanzang. &#8220;The master who went to fetch the scriptures is
 back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221; the other monks all asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;When the master left many years ago,&#8221; the former disciple replied,
 &#8220;he said that when the branches and tops of the pines turned East
 three, four, six or seven years after he had gone he would be back. My
 master speaks with the holy voice of a Buddha: that is how I know.&#8221;
 They quickly put on their habits and went out.</P>
<P>By the time they reached the Western street, messengers had arrived
 to say, &#8220;The pilgrim who went for the scriptures has just returned, and
 His Majesty is bringing him into the city.&#8221; As soon as they heard this
 the monks all hurried over to meet him. When they saw the imperial
 carriage they dared not come close, but followed it to the palace
 gates, where the Tang Priest dismounted and went inside with his
 disciples.</P>
<P>The Tang Priest stood at the foot of the steps to the throne hall
 with the dragon horse, the load of sutras, Monkey, Pig and Friar Sand.
 Emperor Taizong then summoned the Younger Brother to enter the throne
 hall and invited him to sit down, which the Tang Priest did with
 thanks. He then had the scriptures carried up. Monkey and the others
 unpacked the scrolls, which the officials in personal attendance handed
 to the emperor.</P>
<P>&#8220;How many scriptures are there?&#8221; the emperor asked. &#8220;And how did you
 fetch them?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When your clerical subject reached Vulture Peak and saw the Lord
 Buddha,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;he told the arhats Ananda and Kasyapa to
 take us first to a precious tower where we were given meatless food,
 then to the library, where we were handed the scriptures. The arhats
 demanded presents, but as we had not brought any we had none to give.
 Then they gave us the scriptures. When we had thanked the Buddha for
 his goodness and were travelling East the scriptures were snatched away
 by a demonic gale. Luckily my disciples were able to recover them by
 using magic powers, but they had been blown all over the place. On
 opening them out to look at them we found that they were all blank,
 wordless versions. We were so shocked that we went back to report to
 the Buddha and plead for the real ones. What the Lord Buddha said was,
 'When these scriptures were composed, bhiksus and holy monks went down
 the mountain and recited them to the family of the elder Zhao in the
 land of Sravasti. This ensured peace and safety for the living and
 deliverance for the dead members of the family. All that was asked for
 was three bushels and three pecks of granular gold. I thought that they
 sold the scriptures too cheap, so I saw to it that Zhao's sons and
 grandsons would be poor.' When we realized that the two arhats were
 demanding a present and that the Lord Buddha knew all about it we had
 no choice but to give them our begging bowl of purple gold. Only then
 did they hand over the true scriptures with words. There are
 thirty-five of them, and a number of rolls from each of them was
 selected to be given us, making a total of rolls. This corresponds to
 the number of rolls in a single Store.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this Taizong was more delighted than ever. &#8220;Let the Protocol
 Office arrange a thanksgiving banquet in the Eastern hall,&#8221; he ordered,
 at which he suddenly saw the three disciples standing at the foot of
 the steps, looking very strange indeed. &#8220;Are your distinguished
 disciples foreigners?&#8221; he asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;My senior disciple's surname is Sun,&#8221; the venerable elder replied
 with a bow, &#8220;his Buddhist name is Wukong, and I also call him Sun the
 Novice. He originally came from the Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain
 of Flowers and Fruit in the country of Aolai in the Eastern Continent
 of Divine Body. For making great havoc in the palaces of heaven five
 hundred years ago he was crashed by the Lord Buddha in a stone cell in
 the Double Boundary Mountain on the Western frontier. After the
 Bodhisattva Guanyin persuaded him to mend his ways he accepted
 conversion, so when I arrived there I delivered him. I am greatly
 indebted to him for my protection. My second disciple Zhu has the
 Buddhist name Wuneng, and I also call him Pig. He came from the Cloud
 Pathway Cave on the Mountain of Blessing, and was a monster in Gao
 Village in the land of Stubet until he was converted by the Bodhisattva
 and subdued by Wukong. He has made great efforts, carrying the load all
 along the way, and been very useful in crossing rivers. My third
 disciple's surname is Sha and his Buddhist name Wujing. He used to be a
 monster in the Rowing Sands River. He too was converted by the
 Bodhisattva and now believes in the Buddhist faith. The horse is not
 the one that my sovereign gave me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How is that?&#8221; Taizong asked. &#8220;Its markings are the same.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When your subject was going to cross the waters of the Eagle's
 Sorrow Gorge by Coiled Snake Mountain my original horse was devoured by
 this one,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;Sun the Novice obliged me by having the
 Bodhisattva asked about the horse's background. It was originally the
 son of the Dragon King of the Western Sea who had been sent there
 because of an offence. He too, was saved by the Bodhisattva, who told
 him to work for me and turned him into a horse with the same markings
 as the original one. He has been very helpful in climbing mountains,
 crossing ridges, fording rivers and negotiating difficult country. On
 the outward journey I rode him, and he carried the scriptures on the
 way back: I have depended greatly on his efforts.&#8221;</P>
<P>Taizong was full of boundless praise on learning this. &#8220;How long in
 fact was your journey to the far West?&#8221; he asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I remember the Bodhisattva saying that it was 36,000 miles,&#8221; Sanzang
 replied, &#8220;but I kept no record of the distances along the way. All I
 know is that we experienced fourteen winters and summers. Every day
 there was a mountain or a ridge. The woods were big and the rivers
 wide. I also met several kings who inspected and stamped my passport.
 Disciples,&#8221; he ordered, &#8220;fetch the passport and hand it to His
 Majesty.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Taizong examined it he saw that it had been issued on the
 twelfth day of the ninth month of the thirteenth year of<I> Zhen Guan.</I>
 &#8220;You did indeed make a long and protracted journey,&#8221; he observed with a
 touch of a smile. &#8220;It is now the twenty-seventh year of<I> Zhen Guan.&#8221;</I>
 On the passport were the seals of the monarchs of Elephantia, Wuji,
 Tarrycart, the Womanland of Western Liang, Jisai, Purpuria, Leonia,
 Bhiksuland and Dharmadestructia; as well as the seals of the chief
 officials of Fengxian, Yuhua and Jinping. When Taizong had read through
 the passport he put it away.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Soon the officials in personal attendance on the emperor came to
 invite them to go to the banquet, whereupon Taizong led Sanzang by the
 hand out of the throne hall, asking, &#8220;Do your distinguished disciples
 know how to behave themselves?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My disciples were all demons from mountain villages and from the
 wilderness,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;so they do not understand the etiquette
 of the sacred court of China. I beg you to forgive them for any
 offences, Your Majesty.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We won't blame them,&#8221; Taizong said with a smile, &#8220;we won't blame
 them. They are all invited to come with us to the banquet in the
 Eastern pavilion.&#8221; Thanking him once again, Sanzang called his three
 disciples, and they all went to the Eastern pavilion to look. This was
 indeed the great land of China, no ordinary place. Just look;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Coloured silks hung from the gates,</P>
<P>Red carpets were spread on the floor.</P>
<P>Heavy, rare fragrances,</P>
<P>Fresh and exotic foods.</P>
<P>Amber cups,</P>
<P>Glazed dishes,</P>
<P>Set with gold and nephrite;</P>
<P>Plates of yellow gold,</P>
<P>White jade bowls,</P>
<P>Inlaid with patterns.</P>
<P>Tender braised turnips,</P>
<P>Sugar-dredged taros,</P>
<P>Wonderful sweet mushrooms,</P>
<P>Fine fresh seaweed,</P>
<P>Several servings of bamboo shoots with ginger,</P>
<P>A number of rounds of mallows with honey,</P>
<P>Wheat gluten with leaves of the tree of heaven,</P>
<P>Tree fungus and thin strips of beancurd,</P>
<P>Agar and aster,</P>
<P>Noodles with ferns and dried rose-petals,</P>
<P>Peppers stewed with radish,</P>
<P>Melon shredded with mustard.</P>
<P>The dishes of vegetables were fine enough,</P>
<P>But the rare and wonderful fruit was outstanding:</P>
<P>Walnuts and persimmon cakes,</P>
<P>Longans and lichees,</P>
<P>Chestnuts from Xuanzhou and Shandong jujubes,</P>
<P>Gingko fruit from South of the Yangtse and hare-head pears,</P>
<P>Hazelnuts, pine nuts and lotus seeds, all big as grapes,</P>
<P>Torreya nuts and melon seeds the size of water chestnuts,</P>
<P>Olives and wild apples,</P>
<P>Pippins and crabs,</P>
<P>Lotus root and arrowhead,</P>
<P>Crisp plums and red baybfenies.</P>
<P>Nothing was missing,</P>
<P>All was complete.</P>
<P>There were steamed honey pastries and other confections,</P>
<P>Best wines and fragrant tea and things out of the ordinary.</P>
<P>Words could not describe the countless delicacies:</P>
<P>The great land of China was not Western barbary.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The master and his three disciples, together with the civil and
 military officials, stood to left and right as Emperor Taizong took his
 seat in the middle. There was singing, dancing and instrumental music,
 and all was ordered and solemn as the celebration lasted for the rest
 of the day. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The monarch's banquet was finer than those of ancient Tang and Yu;</P>
<P>Great was the blessing of the true scriptures obtained.</P>
<P>This was a story to be told with glory for ever:</P>
<P>The light of the Buddha shines throughout the imperial capital.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>That evening they thanked the emperor for his kindness, after which
 Taizong returned to the living quarters of the palace and the officials
 went home. The Tang Priest went back with his followers to the Hongfu
 Monastery, where the monks welcomed his with kowtows.</P>
<P>No sooner had he gone in through the gates than the monks reported,
 &#8220;Master, these tree-tops all suddenly leaned East this morning. As we
 remembered what you had said we went out of the city to meet you, and
 you had indeed come.&#8221; Overcome with delight, the venerable elder then
 entered the abbot's lodgings. This time Pig neither shouted for tea and
 food nor made a row. Brother Monkey and Friar Sand also both behaved
 well. As the achievement was now complete they were naturally peaceful.
 At nightfall they went to bed.</P>
<P>Early the next morning Taizong announced to his officials at his dawn
 audience, &#8220;When we thought of the most profound and great achievement
 of our Younger Brother that we have no way of rewarding we were unable
 to sleep all night. We managed to draft a few colloquial sentences with
 which to express our thanks, but could not write them out. Officials of
 the Secretariat,&#8221; he ordered, &#8220;write them all down while we recite them
 to you.&#8221; This is the text he dictated:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>It is known that Heaven and Earth have their forms as a demonstration
 of how they provide the cover and support in which life is contained,
 whereas the four seasons are invisible, hiding the cold and heat with
 which they transform all creatures. Thus it is that by examining Heaven
 and looking at the Earth even the stupid can know about their origins,
 but few are the wise who can exhaust the numbers of the Negative and
 the Positive. Heaven and Earth, which are enveloped by the Negative and
 Positive, are easily understood because of their images, but the
 Negative and Positive are hard to fathom because they are formless. If
 images are clear and can be grasped even the stupid will not be
 confused; if forms are hidden and invisible even the wise will be at a
 loss.</P>
<P>The way of the Buddha honors emptiness, rides on the mystery and
 controls silence, yet saves all beings and dominates all regions. When
 it raises up the numinous there is nothing higher; when it represses
 its own divine strength there is nothing lower. When it is big it
 extends throughout the cosmos; when tiny it can be contained in a
 fraction of an inch. It does not die and it is not born; it endures a
 thousand aeons and is eternal. Half hidden and half manifest, it
 controls all blessings and makes them exist for ever. Mysterious is the
 wonderful Way; none of those who follow it know its limits. Silent is
 the flow of the Dharma: of those who grasp it none finds its source. So
 how can mortal fools in their stupidity follow it without doubts or
 delusion?</P>
<P>The great teaching arose in the West. Later a wondrous dream came to
 the Han court, spreading its brilliance and charity to the East. In
 ancient times, when the Buddha's forms and traces were shared around,
 they converted people before word could be spread abroad. In the age
 when they were sometimes visible and sometimes invisible, the people
 looked up to them and followed them. But later the image was obscures
 and nirvana was reached, it moved away and left the world, the golden
 countenance was hidden away and no longer radiated its brilliance in
 the three thousand worlds. Pictures of the lovely image were made,
 vainly trying to show the Buddha's thirty-two holy marks. Thereafter
 his subtle words were widely propagated, rescuing birds on the three
 roads of life; the teachings he left behind were spread afar, guiding
 all living beings along the ten stages of development. The Buddha has
 scriptures that can be divided into the Greater and Lesser Vehicles.
 There is also magic, the art of spreading mistakes and making right
 into wrong.</P>
<P>Now our priest Xuanzang, the Master of the Law, is the leader of the
 Dharma faith. In his youth he was so careful and perceptive that he
 soon became aware of the value of the three voids. As he grew up the
 clarity of his spirit embraced the four kinds of patience in his
 conduct. Not even a pine tree in a wind or the moon reflected in water
 could be compared with his purity; immortals' dew and bright pearls are
 no match for his lustrous splendor. His wisdom encompasses all without
 encumbrance; his spirit fathoms the formless. Rising far above the six
 impurities, he extends his fragrance through a thousand ages. When he
 concentrated his mind on the inner sphere he grieved at the torments
 suffered by the true Dharma; when he settled his thoughts on the gate
 of mystery he was distressed by the distortion of the profound
 writings. He longed to put them back into order so that the teachings
 of the past could be propagated again; and to root out apocryphal
 texts, enabling the true ones to stay in circulation so as to open the
 way for later scholars. That is why he lifted up his heart towards the
 Pure Land, and made a Dharma journey to the West, braving the dangers
 of distant lands as he walked alone, trusting to his staff. When the
 snow whirled around at dawn the land would disappear in a moment; and
 when the dust started to fly at evening the sky was blotted out. He
 advanced through the mists across a thousand leagues of mountains and
 rivers, making his way forward through the frosts and rains of a
 hundred changes of season. With great single-mindedness and making
 light of his efforts he longed deeply to reach his goal. He wandered
 around the West for fourteen years, visiting every one of those exotic
 countries in his search for the true teaching. He visited the Twin
 Trees and the Eight Rivers, savoring the Way and braving the wind. In
 Deer Park and on Vulture Peak he gazed upon wonders and marvels. He
 received the good word from ancient sages and the true teaching from
 superior worthies, probing deep within the wonderful gates, and
 exhausting the mysteries. The Way of the Three Vehicles and the Six
 Disciplines gallop across the field of his heart; a hundred cases of
 texts belonging to one Store roll like waves in the sea of his
 eloquence. Infinitely many are the countries he has visited; and vast
 the number of the scriptures he has collected.</P>
<P>He has obtained 5,048 rolls of all thirty-five of the essential texts
 of the Great Vehicle to be translated and made known in China so that
 the wonderful cause may be promoted. The clouds of mercy he has drawn
 from the far West will shed their Dharma rain here in the East. The
 holy teachings that had been incomplete are now complete once more; the
 common folk who had sinned are brought back to blessings. The searing
 flames of fire have been damped down, and all have been saved from the
 ways of delusion; the muddied waves in the water of wisdom have been
 made clear once more as all gather on the other bank. From this it can
 be learned that the evil fall because of their karma, while the good
 rise because of their destiny. The origins of these rises and falls lie
 in one's own actions. This can be compared with a cassia growing on a
 high mountain, where only clouds and dew can nourish its blossom, or a
 lotus emerging from green waters, its leaves unsullied by flying dust.
 It is not that the lotus is pure by nature and the cassia unsullied:
 they are good because one attaches itself to what is lofty, where mean
 and trivial things cannot encumber it, while the other depends on what
 is clean, where filth cannot dirty it. Now if plants that know nothing
 can become good by building themselves up through goodness, how much
 the more so should conscientious people achieve blessing through
 blessed cause and effect. It is now to be hoped that the true
 scriptures will be propagated as endlessly as the alternation of sun
 and moon; and that this blessing will extend for ever, eternal like
 heaven and earth.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As soon as this had been written out the holy monk, who was waiting
 outside the palace gates to express his thanks, was summoned. The
 moment he heard the summons, Sanzang hurried and performed the ritual
 of kowtows. Taizong then invited him into the throne room and handed
 him the document, Sanzang read it through, prostrated himself once more
 in thanks, and submitted this memorial: &#8220;Your Majesty's writing is both
 lofty and in the ancient style; it is reasoned, profound and subtle.
 But I do not know what its title is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What we drafted orally last night,&#8221; Taizong replied, &#8220;We would call
 a 'Preface to the Holy Teaching'. Would that be acceptable?&#8221; The
 venerable elder kowtowed and expressed his thanks at great length.</P>
<P>Taizong then said, &#8220;Our talent makes us ashamed by comparison with
 what is recorded on jade tablets; our words are not worthy of what is
 inscribed on metal or stone. As for the Inner Scriptures, we are even
 more ignorant of them. The text we drafted orally is truly a base and
 clumsy composition that sullies golden tablets with brush and ink, and
 is like placing pebbles in a forest of pearls. When we reflect on it we
 are filled with embarrassment. It is most unworthy of merit; we have
 put you to the trouble of thanking us for nothing.&#8221;</P>
<P>The officials all expressed their congratulations and kowtowed before
 the imperial text on the holy teaching, which was going to be published
 everywhere in the capital and the provinces.</P>
<P>&#8220;Would you be willing to recite some of the true scriptures for us,
 Younger Brother?&#8221; Taizong asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;if true scriptures are to be
 recited it must be done in the Buddha's ground. A throne hall is no
 place for the recital of scriptures.&#8221;</P>
<P>Taizong was most pleased to accept this. &#8220;Which is the purest
 monastery in the city of Chang'an?&#8221; he asked his officers it
 attendance, at which the Academician Xiao Yu slipped forward from his
 rank to memorialize, &#8220;The Monastery of the Wild Goose Stupa in the city
 is the purest of them all.&#8221;</P>
<P>Taizong then ordered his officials, &#8220;Each of you is reverently to
 bring a few rolls of the true scriptures and accompany us to the
 Monastery of the Wild Goose Stupa, where we shall invite our younger
 brother to preach on the scriptures.&#8221; The officials, all carrying some
 rolls of the scriptures, went with Taizong to the monastery, where a
 high platform was erected and everything was neatly set out.</P>
<P>&#8220;Pig, Friar Sand,&#8221; the venerable elder commanded, &#8220;bring the dragon
 horse with you and put the luggage in order. Monkey will stay beside
 me.&#8221; He then addressed the emperor, saying, &#8220;If Your Majesty wishes to
 spread the true scriptures throughout the world copies must be made
 before they can be published. The original texts must be stored as
 great treasures. They may not be shown any disrespect or be defiled.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Younger Brother,&#8221; replied Taizong with a smile, &#8220;what you say is
 very correct, very correct.&#8221; He then ordered the officials of the
 Hanlin Academy and the Palace Secretariat to copy out the true
 scriptures and had another monastery, the Copying Monastery, founded to
 the East of the city wall.</P>
<P>The venerable elder mounted the platform with several scriptures in
 his hands. He was just about to begin reciting them when scented
 breezes began to waft around and the Eight Great Vajrapanis appeared in
 mid-air to shout aloud, &#8220;Scripture-reciter, put those scriptures down
 and come back to the West with us.&#8221; Monkey and the other two, who were
 standing below Sanzang, all rose up above the ground together with the
 white horse. Sanzang put the scriptures down and also rose up to the
 ninth level of clouds, then went away with them through the air.
 Taizong and his officials were all so alarmed that they kowtowed to the
 sky. This was indeed a case of</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The holy monk long strove to fetch the scriptures;</P>
<P>For fourteen years across the West he strayed.</P>
<P>He journeyed hard and met with much disaster;</P>
<P>By mountains and by rivers long delayed.</P>
<P>Completing eight times nine and one nine more,</P>
<P>His deeds filled worlds in numbers beyond measure.</P>
<P>He went back to his country taking sutras</P>
<P>That people in the East will always treasure.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Taizong and all the officials had finished worshipping, eminent
 monks were selected to prepare a great Land and Sea Mass in the
 Monastery of the Wild Goose Stupa at which the true scriptures of the
 Great Store would be recited, and by which all evil-doing ghosts in the
 underworld would be saved, and goodness would spread all around. We
 will not describe how copies were made of the scriptures and published
 throughout the empire.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story tells instead how the Eight Vajrapanis led the venerable
 elder, his three disciples and the horse, all five of them back to
 Vulture Peak. The journey to Chang'an and back had taken eight days.
 Just when all the deities of Vulture Peak were listening to the Buddha
 preaching, the Eight Vajrapanis led master and disciples in.</P>
<P>&#8220;In obedience to the golden command,&#8221; they reported to the Tathagata,
 &#8220;your disciples have carried the holy monks back to the land of Tang,
 where they handed the scriptures over. We have now come to report our
 mission completed.&#8221; The Tang Priest and his disciples were then told to
 step forward and be given their jobs.</P>
<P>&#8220;Holy Monk,&#8221; the Tathagata said, &#8220;in an earlier life you were my
 second disciple, and called Master Golden Cicada. But because you would
 not listen to my sermon on the Dharma and had no respect for my great
 teaching I demoted your soul to be reborn in the East. Now, happily,
 you have come over to the faith and rely on our support; and in
 following our teaching your achievement in fetching the true scriptures
 has been very great. Your reward will be to be promoted to high office
 as the Candana-punya Buddha. Sun Wukong, when you made great havoc in
 the palaces of heaven I had to use powerful magic to crush you under
 the Five Elements Mountain until, happily, your heaven-sent punishment
 was completed and you were converted to the Sakyamuni's faith. It was
 also fortunate that you suppressed your evil side and gave play to your
 good side as you won glory by defeating monsters and demons along the
 journey. All that was begun has now been completed and you too will be
 rewarded with high office as the Victorious Fighting Buddha. Zhu
 Wuneng; you used to be a water god in the River of Heaven as Marshal
 Tian Peng. Because of your drunken flirtation with an immortal maiden
 at the Peach Banquet you were sent down to be born in the lower world
 as a beast. From your love of the human body you sinned in the Cloud
 Pathway Cave on the Mount of Blessing before your conversion to the
 great faith and entry into our Buddhist sect. You guarded the holy monk
 on his journey, but your heart is still unregenerate, and you are not
 yet purged of your lust. But as you won merit by carrying the luggage
 you will be rewarded with promotion as the Altar Cleanser.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They've both been made Buddhas,&#8221; Pig shouted, &#8220;so why am I only the
 Altar Cleanser?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Because you have a voracious appetite, a lazy body and a huge
 belly,&#8221; the Tathagata replied. &#8220;Now very many people in the world's
 four continents believe in our teachings. I will ask you to clean up
 the altars after all Buddhist services: your post is of a rank that
 provides plenty to eat. What is wrong with that?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Sha Wujing, you used to be the Curtain-lifting General until you
 were banished to the lower world for smashing a crystal bowl at a Peach
 Banquet. You fell into the River of Flowing Sands where you sinned by
 killing and eating people, until, thank goodness, you were converted to
 our teaching, sincerely relied on our support, and won merit by
 protecting the holy monk and leading the horse up the mountain. Your
 reward will be elevation to high office as the Golden Arhat.&#8221;</P>
<P>Then he said to the white horse. &#8220;You were originally the son of
 Guangjin, the Dragon King of the Western Ocean. Because you disobeyed
 your father you were punished for being unfilial until you too were
 converted to the Dharma and to our faith. Every day you carried the
 holy monk to the West, and after that you carried the holy scriptures
 back to the East. For these achievements you will be rewarded by being
 made a Heavenly Dragon of the Eight Classes of Being.&#8221;</P>
<P>The venerable elder and his three disciples all kowtowed to express
 their thanks, and the horse showed its gratitude too. A protector was
 then ordered to take the horse straight down to the Dragon-transforming
 Pool by the precipice at the back of Vulture Peak and push him into the
 pool. At once the horse stretched itself out, shed all its hair, and
 acquired horns. Golden scales grew all over its body and a silver beard
 sprouted on its cheeks and chin. Then, shining all over with auspicious
 aura and with clouds of good omen in every claw, it flew up from the
 Dragon-transforming Pool to coil itself around the Heaven-supporting
 Winged Column. All the Buddhas expressed their admiration for the
 Tathagata's great magic.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; Monkey said to the Tang Priest, &#8220;now that I've become a
 Buddha just like you, surely I don't have to go on wearing this golden
 band. Do you plan to say any more Band-tightening Spells to tighten it
 round my head? Say a Band-loosening Spell as quickly as you can, take
 it off, and smash it to smithereens. Don't let that Bodhisattva or
 whatever she is make life miserable for anyone else with it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It was because you were so uncontrollable in those days that this
 magic was needed to keep you in order.&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;Now that you
 are a Buddha it can of course go. There is no reason for it to stay on
 your head any longer. Feel there now.&#8221; When Monkey raised his hands to
 feel he found that it had indeed gone. The Candana-punya Buddha, the
 Victorious Fighting Buddha, the Altar Cleanser and the Golden Arhat had
 all completed the true achievement and reached their proper places. The
 heavenly dragon horse had also come back to its true self. There is a
 poem to prove this that goes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>All of reality turns to dust;</P>
<P>When the four appearances combine the body is renewed.</P>
<P>The substance of the Five Elements is all void;</P>
<P>Forget about the passing fame of fiends.</P>
<P>With Candana-punya comes the great awakening;</P>
<P>When duties are completed they escape from suffering.</P>
<P>Great is the blessing of scriptures spread abroad;</P>
<P>Within the only gate five sages dwell on high.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the five holy ones had taken their places all the Buddhas,
 Bodhisattvas, holy monks, arhats, protectors, bhiksus, lay people,
 deities and immortals from every cave and every mountain, great gods,
 Ding and Jia gods, duty gods, guardians, local deities, and all
 teachers and immortals who had achieved the Way&#8212;all of whom had
 originally come to hear the preaching&#8212;resumed their own places. Just
 look at it:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The coloured mists surround the Vulture Peak;</P>
<P>Auspicious clouds are massed in the world of bliss.</P>
<P>Golden dragons lie at peace,</P>
<P>Jade tigers all are quiet.</P>
<P>Black hares come and go at will;</P>
<P>Tortoises and snakes coil all around.</P>
<P>Phoenixes red and green are in high spirits;</P>
<P>Happy the dark apes and white deer.</P>
<P>Throughout the year amazing flowers bloom;</P>
<P>Immortal fruit grows in all four seasons.</P>
<P>Lofty pine and ancient juniper,</P>
<P>Blue-green cypress and slender bamboo.</P>
<P>Plums of every color, in blossom or in fruit,</P>
<P>Eternal peaches, sometimes ripe and sometimes new.</P>
<P>A thousand kinds of fruit and flower vie in beauty;</P>
<P>All of the sky is filled with auspicious mists.</P>
<P>They all put their hands together in front of their chests in
 salutation and recited together:</P>
<P>&#8220;Homage to the ancient Dipamkara Buddha.</P>
<P>Homage to Bhaisajya-guru-vaiduryaprabhasa Buddha.</P>

<P>To adorn the Pure Land of the Buddha.</P>
<P>Above we can repay the fourfold kindness,</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Here ends the<I> Journey to the West.</I></P>
