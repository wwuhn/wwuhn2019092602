<P>A Devilish Blizzard Makes the Snow Whirl</P>
<P>The Monk Who Seeks to Worship Buddha Walks on Ice</P>
</div>
<P>The story tells how the believers in Chen Village noisily carried Monkey and Pig with pork, mutton, beef and wine straight to the Temple of Miraculous Response, where they set them all out with the young boy and girl in the most prominent place. Monkey looked around and saw that the offertory tables were covered with fragrant flowers and wax candles. In front of him was a tablet on which were inscribed in letters of gold, GREAT KING OF MIRACULOUS RESPONSE. There were no statues of any other gods. When the believers had set everything out properly they all kowtowed and made this prayer:</P>
<P>&#8220;Great King, our lord, at this hour of this day of this month of this year Chen Cheng, the master of the sacrifice, and all the other faithful of different ages beg to offer in accordance with annual custom the little boy Chen Guan-given, the little girl Pan of Gold, pork, mutton, beef and wine for the delectation of the Great King. We beg you to give us the right amounts of wind and rain and to grant a good harvest for all our crops.&#8221; After praying they burnt paper horses and all went home.</P>
<P>When they had all gone Pig said to Monkey, &#8220;Let's go home.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where's your home?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Let's go back to old Chen's place for a sleep,&#8221; Pig replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;You're talking nonsense again, idiot,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;You've made them a promise and now you've got to fulfil their wish.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're the idiot, not me, despite what you've always saying,&#8221; replied Pig. &#8220;Why don't we just take him for a ride. You can't be serious about us being sacrificed for them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Always finish what you begin,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;We'll only be able to tidy this business up if we stay here till the Great King comes to eat us up. Otherwise we'll make him cause disasters, which would be terrible.&#8221;</P>
<P>As they were talking they heard the howling of a wind outside. &#8220;This is terrible,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;What made the wind come?&#8221; &#8221;</P>
<P>Shut up,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;while I cope.&#8221; A moment later an evil creature came in through the temple doors. Look at him:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Gold armor, golden helmet, shining bright;</P>
<P>Red clouds enfold the jade belt at his waist.</P>
<P>His eyes were gleaming like the stars at night,</P>
<P>His teeth resembled those on a pair of saws.</P>
<P>Under his feet wafted sunset clouds;</P>
<P>Warm and scented were the mists all around.</P>
<P>Cold blew the negative winds as he walked;</P>
<P>Heavy lay the air of death where he stood.</P>
<P>He was just like an officer guarding an emperor,</P>
<P>Or a god at the gateway protecting a monastery.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The monster stood blocking the entrance to the temple and asked, &#8220;Who is making the sacrifice this year?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Thank you for asking,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;This year the village heads are the family of Chen Cheng and Chen Qing.&#8221; This reply struck the monster as very odd.</P>
<P>&#8220;That boy has a lot of courage,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;and he's a good talker too. Usually the children who are offered say nothing the first time I ask them a question and are frightened out of their wits the second time. Before I've even grabbed them in my hand they are already dead. So why's this boy today so good at answering?&#8221;</P>
<P>Instead of seizing him the monster asked another question: &#8220;What is your name, boy?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My name is Chen Guan-given, and the girl is called Pan of Gold.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;According to the old custom of this sacrifice I should eat you first,&#8221; said the monster.</P>
<P>&#8220;I have no objection,&#8221; said Brother Monkey. &#8220;Enjoy your meal.&#8221;</P>
<P>Hearing this the monster was once more afraid to grab Monkey, so instead he blocked the doorway and shouted, &#8220;I'll have none of your answering back. Usually I eat the boy first, but this year I shall start with the girl.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Better to follow the old custom,&#8221; said Pig in a panic. &#8220;Don't break with tradition.&#8221;</P>
<P>Without any more discussion the monster made a grab for Pig, who leapt down, turned back into himself, and struck at the monster's hand with his rake. The monster pulled his hand back and fled. All that could be heard was a mighty clang. &#8220;I've smashed his armor,&#8221; exclaimed Pig.</P>
<P>Monkey, who had resumed his own true form as well, looked, saw two fish scales the size of an ice dish, and gave a shout of &#8220;After him!&#8221;</P>
<P>The two of them sprang up into the air, where the monster, who had come unarmed to his feast, asked them from a cloud, &#8220;Where are you from, monks, and why have you come here to bully me, spoil my offerings, and ruin my reputation?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What you don't realize, damned monster,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;is that we are disciples of the holy priest Sanzang from Great Tang in the East who has been sent by his emperor to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven. We were spending last night at the Chen household when were told that an evil spirit pretending to be Miraculous Response demands the sacrifice of a boy and a girl every year. In our mercy we decided to save life and capture you, damned monster. You'd better make a full and true confession at once. How long have you been here calling yourself 'Great King,' and at two a year how many little boys and girls have you eaten? Given me a full account and return them to me if you want your life spared.&#8221; At that the monster fled, avoiding another blow that Pig struck at him with his rake. He turned into a wild wind and went straight into the River of Heaven.</P>
<P>&#8220;No need to chase him,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'm sure the monster's a river creature. We'll have to work out a way of catching him and getting the master across the river tomorrow.&#8221; Pig accepted this suggestion and went straight back to the temple, from where he carried the offerings of pork, mutton and wine, tables and all, back to the Chen house. The Tang Priest, Friar Sand and the Chen brothers were waiting for news in the hall when they saw Monkey and Pig burst in and put all the pork, mutton and other offerings in the courtyard.</P>
<P>&#8220;What happened in the sacrifice, Wukong?&#8221; Sanzang asked Monkey, who related how he had told the monster who he was and chased him into the river, to the immense delight of the two old gentlemen, who ordered that the side rooms were to be swept out and furnished with beds. Here the master and his disciples were invited to spend the night.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Having escaped with his life back to the river the monster sat brooding silently in his palace while his river clansmen asked him, &#8220;Why are you so upset this year, Your Majesty? Usually you are very happy when you come back from eating your sacrifice.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In ordinary years I bring you back some left-overs after the sacrifice,&#8221; said the monster, &#8220;but I did not even have anything to eat myself today. My luck was out. I met enemies who all but killed me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Who, Your Majesty?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciples of a holy priest from Great Tang in the East who is going to the Western Heaven to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures. They had turned themselves into a boy and a girl and were sitting in my temple. When they turned back into themselves they almost killed me. I've long heard people tell of Tang Sanzang, a holy man who has cultivated his conduct for ten lifetimes: one piece of his flesh will make you immortal. But I never expected he would have disciples such as those. He's ruined my reputation and stopped them worshipping me any more. I wish I could capture that Tang Priest, but I don't think I can.&#8221;</P>
<P>From among the watery tribe there slipped forward a female mandarin fish in patterned clothes. She advanced with small, respectful steps towards the monster, bowing frequently as she said, &#8220;Your Majesty, there will be no problem about catching the Tang Priest. But if you do capture him will you reward me with a feast?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you have a plan we shall combine our efforts to catch the Tang Priest,&#8221; the monster said. &#8220;I shall take you as my sworn sister, and we shall eat his flesh together.&#8221;</P>
<P>The mandarin fish bowed in thanks then said, &#8220;I have long known that Your Majesty has the powers to call up wind and rain, or to throw rivers and sea into turmoil. But can you make it snow?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the monster replied. &#8220;As you can make it snow,&#8221; the mandarin fish continued, &#8220;can you also cause cold and make ice?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm even better at that,&#8221; the monster said. The fish then clapped her hands with delight and said, &#8220;In that case it will be very, very easy.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Will you tell me this very easy way of succeeding?&#8221; the monster asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty must lose no time,&#8221; the fish replied. &#8220;It's now the third watch, about midnight. You must make magic to cause a cold wind and a heavy fall of snow at once. The River of Heaven must be frozen solid. Those of us who are good at transformations will make ourselves look like people and appear at the end of the track with packs on our backs, carrying umbrellas and luggage poles and pushing carts. We shall walk across the ice in an endless stream. That Tang Priest is so impatient to fetch the scriptures that when he sees all those people walking along he's bound to want to cross the ice himself. All Your Majesty needs to do is to sit quietly in the middle of the river until you hear his footsteps, then crack the ice apart so that he and his disciples all fall into the water. They'll all be caught in one package.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Marvellous, marvellous,&#8221; exclaimed the monster, who was utterly delighted at the suggestion. He left his watery palace and went up into the sky, where he caused winds and snow, and made it so cold that the river froze.</P>
<P>The Tang Priest and his three disciples slept in the Chen house. Shortly before dawn they all began to feel very cold in their bedding. Pig was shivering, unable to get back to sleep, so he called, &#8220;Brother, it's cold.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Idiot,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you've got no sense of how to behave. Monks are not affected by summer or winter. You shouldn't mind the cold.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;it really is cold. Look:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Double quilts now give no warmth,</P>
<P>Hands put in sleeves find only ice.</P>
<P>Strands of frost grow from withered leaves,</P>
<P>Frozen bells hang from frozen pines.</P>
<P>The cold is so intense the earth splits open;</P>
<P>The water in the pond is a solid block.</P>
<P>No old man can be seen in the fisherman's boat;</P>
<P>No monk is to be met with in the mountain temple.</P>
<P>The woodman wishes he could gather more fuel;</P>
<P>The prince is glad to pile more charcoal on the flames.</P>
<P>Travelers' beards are turned to iron;</P>
<P>The poet's brush is water-chestnut hard.</P>
<P>Even a fur jacket now seems too thin;</P>
<P>A marten coat feels much too light.</P>
<P>The monk on his hassock is frozen rigid;</P>
<P>Behind the paper screen the traveler is scared.</P>
<P>Even in many a layer of bedding</P>
<P>One shivers and shakes from top to toe.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As neither master nor disciples could sleep they rose and dressed. When they opened the door to look outside they saw to their astonishment a vast expanse of white. It was snowing. &#8220;No wonder we were so cold,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;if it's been snowing so heavily.&#8221; When the four of them looked they saw that it was a splendid fall:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Dark masses of cloud,</P>
<P>Chilling, dreary mists.</P>
<P>Under dark masses of cloud</P>
<P>The North wind howls cold;</P>
<P>Through chilling, dreary mists</P>
<P>A heavy snowfall blankets the ground.</P>
<P>Indeed:</P>
<P>The six-sided snowflakes</P>
<P>Are flying jewels;</P>
<P>In the great forest</P>
<P>Jade hangs from every tree.</P>
<P>First like flour, then like salt.</P>
<P>The white parrot loses its whiteness,</P>
<P>The crane's feathers no longer stand out.</P>
<P>It adds to the waters of a thousand rivers,</P>
<P>Outdoes the plum-trees in the Southeast.</P>
<P>As if three million dragons of jade were defeated,</P>
<P>The sky is filled with fragments of armor and scales.</P>
<P>Here you will not find Dongguo's soleless sandals,</P>
<P>The bed where Yuan An froze to death,</P>
<P>The place where Sun Kang studied in the snow's reflected light,</P>
<P>The boat that Wang Ziyou took one snowy night,</P>
<P>Wang Gong's cloak,</P>
<P>Or the rug that Su Wu had to eat.</P>
<P>All you will see are village houses set like inlaid silver,</P>
<P>Three thousand miles of jade-like river and hills.</P>
<P>What splendid snow,</P>
<P>Sprinkling the bridge with willow catkins,</P>
<P>Covering the cottage with pear blossom.</P>
<P>When the bridge is sprinkled with willow catkins,</P>
<P>The fisherman beside it dons his cape of straw;</P>
<P>When the cottage is covered with pear blossom</P>
<P>The old man inside bums his firewood.</P>
<P>The traveler is hard put to it to buy a drink;</P>
<P>The slave cannot find the plum blossom for which be is sent.</P>
<P>The heavy fall of snow takes off the butterfly's wings,</P>
<P>The howling blizzard strips the goose of its feathers.</P>
<P>Rolling drifts are blown by the winds;</P>
<P>Layer upon layer hides the road.</P>
<P>Freezing gusts come through the curtains,</P>
<P>A chilly wind blows into the bed.</P>
<P>This is Heaven's promise of a good harvest,</P>
<P>Good news that is cause for celebration.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The snow was falling in abundance like fragments of jade or cotton wool. When master and disciples had sighed in admiration of it for a long time the two old Chen brothers told two servants to sweep a way through the snow and two more to bring the monks hot water with which to wash their faces. A little later boiling hot tea, cheesecakes and a charcoal stove were all carried out to the side room, where master and disciple sat around them.</P>
<P>&#8220;Venerable benefactor,&#8221; the Tang Priest asked, &#8220;could you tell me if you distinguish between the seasons of the year here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This may be a remote place,&#8221; said the old man, &#8220;and our customs and people may be different from those in your distinguished land, but our crops and animals grow under the same sky, so of course we distinguish between the four seasons.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case why is there such heavy snow today, and why is it so cold?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Although it has been August,&#8221; the old man replied, &#8220;the frost last night marked the beginning of September. We generally have frost and snow here in September.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That is different from the East,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;We have frost and snow in the winter.&#8221;</P>
<P>As they were talking servants came in with tables and invited them to take some porridge. By the time they had finished eating the snow was heavier than ever and before long it lay two feet deep. Sanzang began to weep with anxiety.</P>
<P>&#8220;Please don't worry so,&#8221; said old Mr. Chen, &#8220;and don't be upset because the snow is deep. We have plenty of grain here, enough to feed you venerable gentlemen for half a lifetime.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You do not know why I am suffering, benefactor,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;When all those years ago His Majesty the Tang Emperor graciously commanded me to make this journey and escorted me in person by carriage to the frontier pass he offered me a parting meal with his own hands, asking me when I would be back. I did not realize how many difficult mountains and rivers would lie in my way, so I casually replied that I could be back with the scriptures in three years. It is now already seven or eight years since I left and I have yet to gaze on the face of the Buddha. I am worried that I have exceeded His Majesty's time limit and afraid of all the evil monsters and other vicious creatures ahead. Today I have had the good fortune to stay in your great mansion, and last night my disciples were able to thank you by doing you a small favour. I was hoping to ask for a boat to ferry us across the river, never expecting that Heaven would send this heavy fall of snow. Now the roads are blocked and I do not know when I shall complete my mission and return home.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do not worry, sir,&#8221; said old Mr. Chen. &#8220;Most of the time for your journey has already passed. You will only have to wait here a few days for the skies to clear and the ice to melt, then we will spend everything we have to see you across the river.&#8221;</P>
<P>A servant then came in to invite them to breakfast, which they ate in the main hall, followed not long afterwards by lunch. Sanzang felt embarrassed by all this lavish hospitality, so he said repeatedly, &#8220;As you are being so kind as to let us stay we must insist on eating more ordinary fare.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Venerable sir,&#8221; Mr. Chen replied, &#8220;we are so grateful for having the children saved from the sacrifice that we could not thank you enough even if we gave you banquets every day.&#8221;</P>
<P>After this the snow stopped and people began to move around. Seeing how unhappy Sanzang was, old Mr. Chen had the garden swept and a fire made in a brazier, then invited them to the snow-cave to cheer themselves up by enjoying the snow view.</P>
<P>&#8220;What a silly idea,&#8221; laughed Pig. &#8220;Spring is the time for enjoying gardens. It's much too cold in all this snow, and anyhow there's nothing to be seen now.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't know anything, you idiot,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Snowscapes are very peaceful and elegant. It will be a pleasure to see them and it will make the master feel better too.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's right, that's right,&#8221; said old Mr. Chen. The visitors were then taken into the garden and this is what they saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Although it was autumn</P>
<P>The scenery was winter's.</P>
<P>Jade stamens formed on the hoary pine,</P>
<P>Silvery flowers hung from the dying willow.</P>
<P>Powder was piled on the lichen by the steps,</P>
<P>Jeweled shoots sprang from the bamboo at the window.</P>
<P>The craggy mountain tops,</P>
<P>The fishpond.</P>
<P>On the craggy mountain tops</P>
<P>The sharp and pointed peaks were like jade bamboo.</P>
<P>In the fishpond</P>
<P>The clear and living water now was ice,</P>
<P>Gone was the beauty of the lotus by the bank;</P>
<P>The rose of Sharon's delicate fronds hung low.</P>
<P>The autumn begonia</P>
<P>Was weighed right down;</P>
<P>The winter plum</P>
<P>Was just putting out new growth.</P>
<P>The Peony Pavilion,</P>
<P>The Pomegranate Pavilion,</P>
<P>The Osmanthus Pavilion,</P>
<P>All piled deep in goose-down;</P>
<P>The Place for Forgetting Cares,</P>
<P>The Place for Entertaining Visitors,</P>
<P>The Place for Recreation,</P>
<P>All covered as if with butterflies' wings.</P>
<P>The yellow chrysanthemums by the fence were woven of jade and gold;</P>
<P>A few maples were dappled white and red.</P>
<P>Many a courtyard was too cold to enter:</P>
<P>The sight of the snow-cave made one feel like ice.</P>
<P>Here was set a brazier of bronze,</P>
<P>With heads of animals and legs like elephants,</P>
<P>Where a toasting-hot fire of charcoal burnt,</P>
<P>And some lacquered armchairs</P>
<P>With cushions of tigerskin</P>
<P>And screens of paper set all around for warmth.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On the walls were hung ancient paintings by famous artists, showing:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Seven Worthies going out through the pass,</P>
<P>A solitary fisherman on a cold river,</P>
<P>Amid a landscape of snowy peaks and mountains.</P>
<P>Su Wu eating his rug,</P>
<P>Breaking off plum branches to meet the envoys,</P>
<P>And writing in the cold of a frozen forest.</P>
<P>There was no end of</P>
<P>Houses near a river pavilion where fish can be bought,</P>
<P>Mountain tracks buried in snow where no wine is on sale.</P>
<P>Were it big enough to live in</P>
<P>Who would need to go to magical Penghu?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After they had admired the scenery for a long time they sat down in the snow-cave and told the elderly neighbors about their mission to fetch the scriptures. When they had drunk the fragrant tea old Mr. Chen said, &#8220;Venerable gentlemen, may I offer you some wine?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As a monk I do not drink,&#8221; replied Sanzang, &#8220;but my disciples may drink a few cups.&#8221; The old man was delighted.</P>
<P>&#8220;Bring vegetarian food,&#8221; he ordered, &#8220;and warm some wine to keep the cold out of these gentlemen.&#8221; Servants then carried out tables that were set round the brazier. They all drank several cups with the two elderly neighbors, then everything was tidied away.</P>
<P>By now it was getting late, and the visitors were invited back into the hall for an evening meal. They could hear passers-by in the street saying, &#8220;Oh! It's cold today. The River of Heaven is frozen solid.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's terrible,&#8221; said Sanzang to Brother Monkey. &#8220;The river's frozen.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In a sudden cold snap like this I think that only the shallow water near the bank can have frozen,&#8221; said old Mr. Chen. Then another passer-by said, &#8220;The whole 250 miles of it are frozen as smooth as a mirror, and some people are setting out across it from where the road ends.&#8221; Hearing that people were walking across, Sanzang wanted to go out and take a look. &#8220;Do not be in such a hurry, venerable sir,&#8221; said old Mr. Chen. &#8220;It's late now. Wait till morning.&#8221; He then said good-bye to the two elderly neighbors, and after supper the visitors slept in the side room once more.</P>
<P>Pig rose at dawn and said, &#8220;Brother, it was even colder last night. I think the river really must have frozen solid.&#8221; Sanzang went to the door, bowed low to Heaven, and prayed, &#8220;All you gods who protect the teachings, on my journey West I have faithfully worshipped the Buddha and crossed many a river and mountain with great suffering and never a word of complaint. I am deeply grateful for Heaven's help in bringing me this far, and I also give most humble thanks that the river has now frozen. When I bring the scriptures back I shall report all this to the Tang Emperor and reward you sincerely.&#8221; When he had finished his prayer he told Friar Sand to saddle the horse so that they could cross the river while it was frozen. &#8220;Please do not be in such a hurry,&#8221; said old Mr. Chen. &#8220;Stay here a few more days until the ice has melted and I shall arrange for a boat to carry you across.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I don't know whether we should go or stay,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;You can't rely on what people say, and you can only believe what you see with your own eyes. I'll saddle the horse and you can take a look for yourself.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;A good suggestion,&#8221; said old Mr. Chen. &#8220;Servants,&#8221; he ordered, &#8220;saddle six of our horses, but not the Tang Priest's horse.&#8221;</P>
<P>Then with six young pages in attendance they went in line to the bank of the river to look. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The snow is piled up like mountains,</P>
<P>When the clouds disappear the dawn is bright.</P>
<P>A thousand pinnacles soar above the ice-locked pass;</P>
<P>Frozen rivers and lakes are completely smooth.</P>
<P>The North wind chills to the bone,</P>
<P>The slippery ice is bitterly cold.</P>
<P>The fish stay by the plants in the pond,</P>
<P>The wild birds linger in the stubble.</P>
<P>Beyond the frontier fingers are lost to frostbite;</P>
<P>The boatman on the river breaks his teeth with shivering.</P>
<P>Snakes' stomachs split,</P>
<P>Birds' legs break:</P>
<P>The ice forms mountains thousands of feet high.</P>
<P>The flowing silver stops in ten thousand valleys;</P>
<P>Cold is the river's liquid jade.</P>
<P>The East produces frozen silkworms,</P>
<P>And mice make their holes in the Northern ice.</P>
<P>Wang Xiang lay on the ice to melt it</P>
<P>And caught a carp for his mother to eat.</P>
<P>When the Emperor Guangwu crossed the river</P>
<P>A bridge of ice formed overnight for him.</P>
<P>Many are the layers of ice on the pond,</P>
<P>And the deep pool is frozen solid.</P>
<P>There are no more waves on the mighty River of Heaven;</P>
<P>The gleaming ice stretches out as hard as a road.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Sanzang and his party reached the bank of the river they reined in their horses to look and saw that there really were people setting out from where the road reached the bank. &#8220;Benefactor,&#8221; asked Sanzang, &#8220;where are those people going to across the ice?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;On the other side of the river,&#8221; said old Mr. Chen, &#8220;is the Womanland of Western Liang. Those people are all traders. What costs a hundred cash on this side can be worth ten thousand over there and vice versa, and it's because such big profits can be made for such a small expenditure that people risk their lives to go there. Normally they form groups of five to a dozen or so and sail across, but now that the river has frozen over they are prepared to walk over at mortal peril.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Fame and profit are what make the world go round,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;They are risking their lives for profit, and my disciples loyally obey orders for the sake of fame: there's not much to choose between them.&#8221; He then told Monkey to go back to their benefactors' house, pack the luggage, and bridle and saddle the horse so that they could head West while the ice held. Monkey agreed with a chuckle.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;there's a saying that goes, 'For a thousand days you need a thousand pints of rice.' Now that we are staying at the Chen house why don't we wait here a few days longer till the skies have cleared and the ice melted then get a boat to take us across? Rushing like this will only lead to trouble.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wujing,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;how can you be so stupid? If it were March and the weather were warming up every day we could wait for it to thaw. But now it is September and it is getting cooler very day, so it would be absurd to wait for the thaw. It would set our journey a long time back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop all that idle chatter,&#8221; said Pig, jumping down from his horse. &#8220;I'm going to find out how thick the ice is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You idiot,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you could test the depth of the water the other evening by throwing a stone into it, but you could never do that now that the ice is so thick.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What you don't understand, brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;is that I can hit it with my rake. If I smash through it, it's too thin for us to walk on; but if I don't move it at all that'll show it's thick enough for us to cross.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What you say is right,&#8221; observed Sanzang. The idiot hitched up his clothes, strode to the edge of the river, raised his rake with both hands, and brought it down with all his might. There was a hollow thump as nine white scars appeared on the ice. His hand had been painfully jarred.</P>
<P>&#8220;We can go,&#8221; said the idiot with a grin, &#8220;we can go. It's frozen solid right down to the bottom.&#8221;</P>
<P>The news delighted Sanzang, who took them all back to the Chen house and told them to prepare to travel. Seeing that repeated pleas were not going to make their visitors stay the two old men gave them some dry cooked grain, buns and steamed bread. The whole household kowtowed to the monks in respect then carried out a tray of silver and gold pieces and knelt before them. &#8220;We are so grateful to you gentlemen for saving the lives of our children that we would like to offer you this towards the cost of a meal on the journey.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang shook his head and waved his hand as he refused to accept it. &#8220;I am a monk,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and what would I want with money? I would never be able to produce it on the journey. We have to beg for what we eat. The food you have given us will be plenty.&#8221; When the old men repeatedly implored them to accept it Monkey took just under half an ounce of it between his fingers that he handed to Sanzang with the words, &#8220;Master, accept this offering so as not to be ungrateful to the two old gentlemen.&#8221;</P>
<P>Only then did they take their leave. Once the horse's hoofs slipped on the ice at the edge of the river, so that Sanzang almost fell of.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's hard going, Master,&#8221; said Friar Sand.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;Ask old Mr. Chen for some rice straw.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What for?&#8221; Brother Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;You wouldn't know,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;If you wrap rice straw round the horse's hoofs it won't slip and the master won't fall off.&#8221; When old Mr. Chen heard this from the bank he at once sent someone back to fetch a bundle of rice straw from the house, then invited Sanzang to dismount while Pig wrapped the straw round the horse's hoofs, after which they set out across the ice.</P>
<P>When they had taken their leave of the old Chen brothers and gone a mile or so from the bank Pig handed the nine-ringed monastic staff to Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; he said, &#8220;hold this staff sticking out sideways as you ride.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You idiot,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you're trying another dirty trick. You're meant to be carrying the staff, so why are you giving it to the master to carry?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've never walked across ice,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;so you wouldn't know that there are always crevasses. Step on one and you'll go in. If you don't have something like a carrying-pole sticking out sideways then you'll fall into the water and have no more chance of climbing out that if you were in a big pot with a lid on it. You've got to have a prop like this to be safe.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This idiot must have years of experience of walking on ice,&#8221; thought Monkey, smiling to himself, and they took Pig's advice: the venerable elder held his monastic staff sideways, Monkey his iron cudgel, Friar Sand his demon-quelling staff and Pig, who had the luggage on a carrying-pole over his shoulder, held his rake sideways at waist height. Thus master and disciples pressed ahead without worry until nightfall, when they ate some of their dry rations. Not daring to delay, they hurried on over the ice that glistened and reflected the light of the moon and the stars across its white expanses. The horse never rested for a moment nor did master and disciples close their eyes as they kept going all night. They ate some more dry rations at dawn and pressed on towards the West.</P>
<P>As they were walking they heard a loud creaking noise from under the ice which so frightened the white horse that it almost fell over. &#8220;Disciples,&#8221; asked Sanzang with horror, &#8220;what was that noise?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The river has frozen so solid that it's made the earth rumble,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;Or perhaps the river's frozen right to the bottom here in the middle.&#8221; Half reassured but still half terrified, Sanzang whipped the horse forward and they carried on.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Since coming back to his watery palace the evil monster had been waiting under the ice with all his spirits for a long time. As soon as he heard the horse's hoofs he used his magic to make the ice burst noisily open, giving Monkey such a fright that he sprang up into mid-air. The other three and the white horse sank into the water, where the evil monster captured Sanzang and took him back to his underwater palace with all his spirits.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where is my sister the mandarin fish?&#8221; he shouted stridently, at which she came forward, did obeisance, and said, &#8220;Your Majesty, I am not worthy to be your sister.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you say such a thing, good sister?&#8221; the monster replied. &#8220;Once a word is spoken a four-horse chariot can't bring it back. I said that if I caught the Tang Priest by following your plan I would take you as my sworn sister. Today your plan has proved itself to have been a superb one and the Tang Priest has been caught. I could not possibly go back on my word. Little ones,&#8221; he ordered his underlings, &#8220;bring a table, whet a sharp knife, open this monk up, cut out his heart, skin him, and slice up his flesh. I also want music played while I share him with my sister and we both obtain eternal life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; said the mandarin fish, &#8220;don't eat him yet. His disciples may make trouble if they come here searching for him. It would be better to wait a couple of days until we know those damned wretches won't come looking for him before we cut him up. Then Your Majesty will sit in the place of honour while we, your kinsfolk, play music, sing and dance around you and wait on you; and you will be able to take your pleasure at your ease. Wouldn't that be best?&#8221; The monster accepted the suggestion and had Sanzang stored away in a six-foot-long stone chest behind the palace.</P>
<P>Pig and Friar Sand meanwhile recovered the luggage in the river, loaded it on the back of the white horse, and swam up through the waves as they parted the waters. When Monkey saw them from up in the air he asked, &#8220;Where's the master?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He's not the Tang Priest now,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;He's the Drowned Priest. We can't find him anywhere, so let's go back ashore and decide what to do.&#8221; Now Pig was a mortal incarnation of Marshal Tian Peng who had once commanded eighty thousand sailors on the Heavenly River in the sky, Friar Sand had come from the Flowing Sands River, and the white horse was the grandson of the Dragon King of the Western Ocean, so they were all good swimmers. With the Great Sage showing them the way from mid-air they were soon back at the Eastern bank, where they dried and brushed the horse and wrung out their clothes.</P>
<P>Monkey then landed his cloud, and they went back together to the Chen household, where a messenger had already reported that only three of the four venerable gentlemen who were going to fetch the scriptures were now returning. The two aged brothers hurried outside to meet them.</P>
<P>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; they said, seeing their wet clothes, &#8220;we tried so hard to persuade you to stay longer, and look what has come of your refusal. Where is the venerable Tang Priest?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He isn't the Tang Priest any more,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;He's the Drowned Priest.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Alas, alas,&#8221; said the aged brothers, bursting into tears. &#8220;We said that you should wait until the snow had melted and we could send you all across in a boat, but he refused to agree, and now he's dead.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Old men,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;don't upset yourselves over your friend. I can assure you that the master will not die. I'm certain that the Great King of Miraculous Response has captured him by magic. So stop worrying, have our clothes washed and starched, our passport dried out, and the white horse fed. My brothers and I will find the damned creature, rescue the master, and wipe this evil monster out. Then he'll give you village no more trouble and you will, I hope, have a safe and peaceful future.&#8221; Old Mr. Chen, greatly encouraged to hear this, ordered a vegetarian meal to be provided.</P>
<P>The three brothers ate their fill, handed the horse and the luggage over to the care of the Chen household, got their weapons ready, and hurried off to find their master and catch the monster. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The true nature was harmed by treading on the ice;</P>
<P>How could they be complete without the Cinnabar?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you do not know how they rescued the Tang Priest listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>魔弄寒风飘大雪</p>
<p>僧思拜佛履层冰</p>
</div>
<p>话说陈家庄众信人等，将猪羊牲醴与行者八戒，喧喧嚷嚷，直抬至灵感庙里排下，将童男女设在上首。行者回头，看见那供桌上香花蜡烛，正面一个金字牌位，上写灵感大王之神，更无别的神象。众信摆列停当，一齐朝上叩头道：“大王爷爷，今年今月今日今时，陈家庄祭主陈澄等众信，年甲不齐，谨遵年例，供献童男一名陈关保，童女一名陈一秤金，猪羊牲醴如数，奉上大王享用，保祐风调雨顺，五谷丰登。”祝罢，烧了纸马，各回本宅不题。</p>

<p>那八戒见人散了，对行者道：“我们家去罢。”行者道：“你家在那里？”八戒道：“往老陈家睡觉去。”行者道：“呆子又乱谈了，既允了他，须与他了这愿心才是哩。”八戒道：“你倒不是呆子，反说我是呆子！只哄他耍耍便罢，怎么就与他祭赛，当起真来！”行者道：“莫胡说，为人为彻，一定等那大王来吃了，才是个全始全终；不然，又教他降灾贻害，反为不美。”正说间，只听得呼呼风响。八戒道：“不好了！风响是那话儿来了！”行者只叫：“莫言语，等我答应。”顷刻间，庙门外来了一个妖邪，你看他怎生模样：金甲金盔灿烂新，腰缠宝带绕红云。眼如晚出明星皎，牙似重排锯齿分。足下烟霞飘荡荡，身边雾霭暖熏熏。行时阵阵阴风冷，立处层层煞气温。却似卷帘扶驾将，犹如镇寺大门神。那怪物拦住庙门问道：“今年祭祀的是那家？”行者笑吟吟的答道：“承下问，庄头是陈澄、陈清家。”那怪闻答，心中疑似道：“这童男胆大，言谈伶俐，常来供养受用的，问一声不言语，再问声，唬了魂，用手去捉，已是死人。怎么今日这童男善能应对？”怪物不敢来拿，又问：“童男女叫甚名字？”行者笑道：“童男陈关保，童女一秤金。”怪物道：“这祭赛乃上年旧规，如今供献我，当吃你。”行者道：“不敢抗拒，请自在受用。”怪物听说，又不敢动手，拦住门喝道：“你莫顶嘴！我常年先吃童男，今年倒要先吃童女！”八戒慌了道：“大王还照旧罢，不要吃坏例子。”</p>

<p>那怪不容分说，放开手，就捉八戒。呆子扑的跳下来，现了本相，掣钉钯，劈手一筑，那怪物缩了手，往前就走，只听得当的一声响。八戒道：“筑破甲了！”行者也现本相看处，原来是冰盘大小两个鱼鳞，喝声“赶上！”二人跳到空中。那怪物因来赴会，不曾带得兵器，空手在云端里问道：“你是那方和尚，到此欺人，破了我的香火，坏了我的名声！”行者道：“这泼物原来不知，我等乃东土大唐圣僧三藏奉钦差西天取经之徒弟。昨因夜寓陈家，闻有邪魔，假号灵感，年年要童男女祭赛，是我等慈悲，拯救生灵，捉你这泼物！趁早实实供来！一年吃两个童男女，你在这里称了几年大王，吃了多少男女？一个个算还我，饶你死罪！”那怪闻言就走，被八戒又一钉钯，未曾打着，他化一阵狂风，钻入通天河内。行者道：“不消赶他了，这怪想是河中之物。且待明日设法拿他，送我师父过河。”八戒依言，径回庙里，把那猪羊祭醴，连桌面一齐搬到陈家。此时唐长老、沙和尚共陈家兄弟，正在厅中候信，忽见他二人将猪羊等物都丢在天井里。三藏迎来问道：“悟空，祭赛之事何如？”行者将那称名赶怪钻入河中之事，说了一遍，二老十分欢喜，即命打扫厢房，安排床铺，请他师徒就寝不题。</p>

<p>却说那怪得命，回归水内，坐在宫中，默默无言，水中大小眷族问题：“大王每年享祭，回来欢喜，怎么今日烦恼？”那怪道：“常年享毕，还带些余物与汝等受用，今日连我也不曾吃得。造化低，撞着一个对头，几乎伤了性命。”众水族问：“大王，是那个？”那怪道：“是一个东土大唐圣僧的徒弟，往西天拜佛求经者，假变男女，坐在庙里。我被他现出本相，险些儿伤了性命。一向闻得人讲：唐三藏乃十世修行好人，但得吃他一块肉延寿长生。不期他手下有这般徒弟，我被他坏了名声，破了香火，有心要捉唐僧，只怕不得能彀。”那水族中，闪上一个斑衣鳜婆，对怪物跬跬拜拜笑道：“大王，要捉唐僧，有何难处！但不知捉住他，可赏我些酒肉？”那怪道：“你若有谋，合同用力，捉了唐僧，与你拜为兄妹，共席享之。”鳜婆拜谢了道：“久知大王有呼风唤雨之神通，搅海翻江之势力，不知可会降雪？”那怪道：“会降。”又道：“既会降雪，不知可会作冷结冰？”那怪道：</p>

<p>“更会！”鳜婆鼓掌笑道：“如此极易！极易！”那怪道：“你且将极易之功，讲来我听。”鳜婆道：“今夜有三更天气，大王不必迟疑，趁早作法，起一阵寒风，下一阵大雪，把通天河尽皆冻结。</p>

<p>着我等善变化者，变作几个人形，在于路口，背包持伞，担担推车，不住的在冰上行走。那唐僧取经之心甚急，看见如此人行，断然踏冰而渡。大王稳坐河心，待他脚踪响处，迸裂寒冰，连他那徒弟们一齐坠落水中，一鼓可得也！”那怪闻言。满心欢喜道：“甚妙！甚妙！”即出水府，踏长空兴风作雪，结冷凝冻成冰不题。</p>

<p>却说唐长老师徒四人歇在陈家，将近天晓，师徒们衾寒枕冷。八戒咳歌打战睡不得，叫道：“师兄，冷啊！”行者道：“你这呆子，忒不长俊！出家人寒暑不侵，怎么怕冷？”三藏道：“徒弟，果然冷。你看，就是那重衾无暖气，袖手似揣冰。此时败叶垂霜蕊，苍松挂冻铃。地裂因寒甚，池平为水凝。渔舟不见叟，山寺怎逢僧？樵子愁柴少，王孙喜炭增。征人须似铁，诗客笔如菱。皮袄犹嫌薄，貂裘尚恨轻。蒲团僵老衲，纸帐旅魂惊。绣被重裀褥，浑身战抖铃。”师徒们都睡不得，爬起来穿了衣服，开门看处，呀！外面白茫茫的，原来下雪哩！行者道：“怪道你们害冷哩，却是这般大雪！”四人眼同观看，好雪！但见那：彤云密布，惨雾重浸。彤云密布，朔风凛凛号空；惨雾重浸，大雪纷纷盖地。真个是六出花，片片飞琼；千林树，株株带玉。须臾积粉，顷刻成盐。白鹦歌失素，皓鹤羽毛同。平添吴楚千江水，压倒东南几树梅。却便似战退玉龙三百万，果然如败鳞残甲满天飞。那里得东郭履，袁安卧，孙康映读；更不见子猷舟，王恭币，苏武餐毡。但只是几家村舍如银砌，万里江山似玉团。好雪！</p>

<p>柳絮漫桥，梨花盖舍。柳絮漫桥，桥边渔叟挂蓑衣；梨花盖舍，舍下野翁煨榾柮。客子难沽酒，苍头苦觅梅。洒洒潇潇裁蝶翘，飘飘荡荡剪鹅衣。团团滚滚随风势，迭迭层层道路迷。阵阵寒威穿小幕，飕飕冷气透幽帏。丰年祥瑞从天降，堪贺人间好事宜。那场雪，纷纷洒洒，果如剪玉飞绵。师徒们叹玩多时，只见陈家老者，着两个僮仆，扫开道路，又两个送出热汤洗面。须臾又送滚茶乳饼，又抬出炭火，俱到厢房，师徒们叙坐。长老问道：“老施主，贵处时令，不知可分春夏秋冬？”陈老笑道：“此间虽是僻地，但只风俗人物与上国不同，至于诸凡谷苗牲畜，都是同天共日，岂有不分四时之理？”三藏道：“既分四时，怎么如今就有这般大雪，这般寒冷？”陈老道：“此时虽是七月，昨日已交白露，就是八月节了。我这里常年八月间就有霜雪。”三藏道：“甚比我东土不同，我那里交冬节方有之。”</p>

<p>正话间，又见僮仆来安桌子，请吃粥。粥罢之后，雪比早间又大，须臾平地有二尺来深。三藏心焦垂泪，陈老道：“老爷放心，莫见雪深忧虑。我舍下颇有几石粮食，供养得老爷们半生。”三藏道：“老施主不知贫僧之苦。我当年蒙圣恩赐了旨意，摆大驾亲送出关，唐王御手擎杯奉饯，问道几时可回？贫僧不知有山川之险，顺口回奏，只消三年，可取经回国。自别后，今已七八个年头，还未见佛面，恐违了钦限，又怕的是妖魔凶狠，所以焦虑。今日有缘得寓潭府，昨夜愚徒们略施小惠报答，实指望求一船只渡河。不期天降大雪，道路迷漫，不知几时才得功成回故土也！”陈老道：“老爷放心，正是多的日子过了，那里在这几日？且待天晴，化了冰，老拙倾家费产，必处置送老爷过河。”只见一僮又请进早斋。到厅上吃毕，叙不多时，又午斋相继而进。三藏见品物丰盛，再四不安道：“既蒙见留，只可以家常相待。”陈老道：“老爷，感蒙替祭救命之恩，虽逐日设筵奉款，也难酬难谢。”</p>

<p>此后大雪方住，就有人行走。陈老见三藏不快，又打扫花园，大盆架火，请去雪洞里闲耍散闷。八戒笑道：“那老儿忒没算计！春二三月好赏花园，这等大雪又冷，赏玩何物！”行者道：</p>

<p>“呆子不知事！雪景自然幽静，一则游赏，二来与师父宽怀。”陈老道：“正是，正是。”遂此邀请到园，但见：景值三秋，风光如腊。苍松结玉蕊，衰柳挂银花。阶下玉苔堆粉屑，窗前翠竹吐琼芽。巧石山头，养鱼池内。巧石山头，削削尖峰排玉笋；养鱼池内，清清活水作冰盘。临岸芙蓉娇色浅，傍崖木槿嫩枝垂。秋海棠，全然压倒；腊梅树，聊发新枝。牡丹亭、海榴亭、丹桂亭，亭亭尽鹅毛堆积；放怀处、款客处、遣兴处，处处皆蝶翅铺漫。</p>

<p>两篱黄菊玉绡金，几树丹枫红间白。无数闲庭冷难到，且观雪洞冷如冰。那里边放一个兽面象足铜火盆，热烘烘炭火才生；</p>

<p>那上下有几张虎皮搭苫漆交椅，软温温纸窗铺设。四壁上挂几轴名公古画，却是那七贤过关，寒江独钓，迭嶂层峦团雪景；苏武餐毡，折梅逢使，琼林玉树写寒文。说不尽那家近水亭鱼易买，雪迷山径酒难沽。真个可堪容膝处，算来何用访蓬壶？众人观玩良久，就于雪洞里坐下，对邻叟道取经之事，又捧香茶饮毕。陈老问：列位老爷，可饮酒么？”三藏道：“贫僧不饮，小徒略饮几杯素酒。”陈老大喜，即命：“取素果品，炖暖酒，与列位汤寒。”那僮仆即抬桌围炉，与两个邻叟各饮了几杯，收了家火。</p>

<p>不觉天色将晚，又仍请到厅上晚斋，只听得街上行人都说：“好冷天啊！把通天河冻住了！”三藏闻言道：“悟空，冻住河，我们怎生是好？”陈老道：“乍寒乍冷，想是近河边浅水处冻结。”那行人道：“把八百里都冻的似镜面一般，路口上有人走哩！”三藏听说有人走，就要去看。陈老道：“老爷莫忙，今日晚了，明日去看。”遂此别却邻叟，又晚斋毕，依然歇在厢房。</p>

<p>及次日天晓，八戒起来道：“师兄，今夜更冷，想必河冻住也。”三藏迎着门，朝天礼拜道：“众位护教大神，弟子一向西来，虔心拜佛，苦历山川，更无一声报怨。今至于此，感得皇天祐助，结冻河水，弟子空心权谢，待得经回，奏上唐皇，竭诚酬答。”礼拜毕，遂教悟净背马，趁冰过河。陈老又道：“莫忙，待几日雪融冰解，老拙这里办船相送。”沙僧道：“就行也不是话，再住也不是话，口说无凭，耳闻不如眼见。我背了马，且请师父亲去看看。”陈老道：“言之有理。”教：“小的们，快去背我们六匹马来！且莫背唐僧老爷马。”就有六个小价跟随，一行人径往河边来看，真个是，雪积如山耸，云收破晓晴。寒凝楚塞千峰瘦，冰结江湖一片平。朔风凛凛，滑冻棱棱。池鱼偎密藻，野鸟恋枯槎。塞外征夫俱坠指，江头梢子乱敲牙。裂蛇腹，断鸟足，果然冰山千百尺。万壑冷浮银，一川寒浸玉。东方自信出僵蚕，北地果然有鼠窟。王祥卧，光武渡，一夜溪桥连底固。曲沼结棱层，深渊重迭沍。通天阔水更无波，皎洁冰漫如陆路。三藏与一行人到了河边，勒马观看，真个那路口上有人行走。三藏问道：“施主，那些人上冰往那里去？”陈老道：“河那边乃西梁女国，这起人都是做买卖的。我这边百钱之物，到那边可值万钱；那边百钱之物，到这边亦可值万钱。利重本轻，所以人不顾生死而去。常年家有五七人一船，或十数人一船，飘洋而过。见如今河道冻住，故舍命而步行也。”三藏道：“世间事惟名利最重。似他为利的，舍死忘生，我弟子奉旨全忠，也只是为名，与他能差几何！”教：“悟空，快回施主家，收拾行囊，叩背马匹，趁此层冰，早奔西方去也。”行者笑吟吟答应。沙僧道：“师父啊，常言道，千日吃了千升米。今已托赖陈府上，且再住几日，待天晴化冻，办船而过，忙中恐有错也。”三藏道：“悟净，怎么这等愚见！若是正二月，一日暖似一日，可以待得冻解。此时乃八月，一日冷似一日，如何可便望解冻！却不又误了半载行程？”</p>

<p>八戒跳下马来：“你们且休讲闲口，等老猪试看有多少厚薄。”</p>

<p>行者道：“呆子，前夜试水，能去抛石，如今冰冻重漫，怎生试得？”八戒道：“师兄不知，等我举钉钯筑他一下。假若筑破，就是冰薄，且不敢行；若筑不动，便是冰厚，如何不行？”三藏道：</p>

<p>“正是，说得有理。”那呆子撩衣拽步，走上河边，双手举钯，尽力一筑，只听扑的一声，筑了九个白迹，手也振得生疼。呆子笑道：“去得！去得！连底都锢住了。”</p>

<p>三藏闻言，十分欢喜，与众同回陈家，只教收拾走路。那两个老者苦留不住，只得安排些干粮烘炒，做些烧饼馍馍相送。</p>

<p>一家子磕头礼拜，又捧出一盘子散碎金银，跪在面前道：“多蒙老爷活子之恩，聊表途中一饭之敬。”三藏摆手摇头，只是不受道：“贫僧出家人，财帛何用？就途中也不敢取出。只是以化斋度日为正事，收了干粮足矣。”二老又再三央求，行者用指尖儿捻了一小块，约有四五钱重，递与唐僧道：“师父，也只当些衬钱，莫教空负二老之意。”遂此相向而别，径至河边冰上，那马蹄滑了一滑，险些儿把三藏跌下马来。沙僧道：“师父，难行！”</p>

<p>八戒道：“且住！问陈老官讨个稻草来我用。”行者道：“要稻草何用？”八戒道：“你那里得知，要稻草包着马蹄方才不滑，免教跌下师父来也。”陈老在岸上听言，急命人家中取一束稻草，却请唐僧上岸下马。八戒将草包裹马足，然后踏冰而行。</p>

<p>别陈老离河边，行有三四里远近，八戒把九环锡杖递与唐僧道：“师父，你横此在马上。”行者道：“这呆子奸诈！锡杖原是你挑的，如何又叫师父拿着？”八戒道：“你不曾走过冰凌，不晓得。凡是冰冻之上，必有凌眼，倘或躧着凌眼，脱将下去，若没横担之物，骨都的落水，就如一个大锅盖盖住，如何钻得上来！</p>

<p>须是如此架住方可。”行者暗笑道：“这呆子倒是个积年走冰的！”果然都依了他。长老横担着锡杖，行者横担着铁棒，沙僧横担着降妖宝杖，八戒肩挑着行李，腰横着钉钯，师徒们放心前进。这一直行到天晚，吃了些干粮，却又不敢久停，对着星月光华，观的冰冻上亮灼灼、白茫茫，只情奔走，果然是马不停蹄，师徒们莫能合眼，走了一夜。天明又吃些干粮，望西又进。</p>

<p>正行时，只听得冰底下扑喇喇一声响喨，险些儿唬倒了白马。</p>

<p>三藏大惊道：“徒弟呀！怎么这般响喨？”八戒道：“这河忒也冻得结实，地凌响了，或者这半中间连底通锢住了也。”三藏闻言，又惊又喜，策马前进，趱行不题。</p>

<p>却说那妖邪自从回归水府，引众精在于冰下。等候多时，只听得马蹄响处，他在底下弄个神通，滑喇的迸开冰冻，慌得孙大圣跳上空中，早把那白马落于水内，三人尽皆脱下。那妖邪将三藏捉住，引群精径回水府，厉声高叫：“鳜妹何在？”老鳜婆迎门施礼道：“大王，不敢不敢！”妖邪道：“贤妹何出此言！一言既出，驷马难追。原说听从汝计，捉了唐僧，与你拜为兄妹。</p>

<p>今日果成妙计，捉了唐僧，就好味了前言？”教：“小的们，抬过案桌，磨快刀来，把这和尚剖腹剜心，剥皮剐肉，一壁厢响动乐器，与贤妹共而食之，延寿长生也。”鳜婆道：“大王，且休吃他，恐他徒弟们寻来吵闹。且宁耐两日，让那厮不来寻，然后剖开，请大王上坐，众眷族环列，吹弹歌舞，奉上大王，从容自在享用，却不好也？”那怪依言，把唐僧藏于宫后，使一个六尺长的石匣，盖在中间不题。</p>

<p>却说八戒、沙僧在水里捞着行囊，放在白马身上驮了，分开水路，涌浪翻波，负水而出，只见行者在半空中看见，问道：</p>

<p>“师父何在？”八戒道：“师父姓陈，名到底了，如今没处找寻，且上岸再作区处。”原来八戒本是天蓬元帅临凡，他当年掌管天河八万水兵大众，沙和尚是流沙河内出身，白马本是西海龙孙：故此能知水性。大圣在空中指引，须臾回转东崖，晒刷了马匹，靦掠了衣裳，大圣云头按落，一同到于陈家庄上。早有人报与二老道：“四个取经的老爷，如今只剩了三个来也。”兄弟即忙接出门外，果见衣裳还湿，道：“老爷们，我等那般苦留，却不肯住，只要这样方休。怎么不见三藏老爷？”八戒道：“不叫做三藏了，改名叫做陈到底也。”二老垂泪道：“可怜！可怜！我说等雪融备船相送，坚执不从，致令丧了性命！”行者道：“老儿，莫替古人耽忧，我师父管他不死长命。老孙知道，决然是那灵感大王弄法算计去了。你且放心，与我们浆浆衣服，晒晒关文，取草料喂着白马，等我弟兄寻着那厮，救出师父，索性剪草除根，替你一庄人除了后患，庶几永永得安生也。”陈老闻言，满心欢喜，即命安排斋供。兄弟三人，饱餐一顿，将马匹行囊交与陈家看守，各整兵器，径赴道边寻师擒怪。正是：误踏层冰伤本性，大丹脱漏怎周全？毕竟不知怎么救得唐僧，且听下回分解。</p>
