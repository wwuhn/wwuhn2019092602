<P>The Boy Fools with Transformations, Disturbing the Dhyana Heart</P>
<P>Ape and Horse Return with a Knife; the Mother of Wood Is Empty</P>
</div>
<P>The story goes on to tell how the Great Sage Monkey and his two fellow-disciples landed their clouds and went straight into the palace. Here monarch, ministers, queen and prince bowed to them in thanks, a group at a time, and Monkey told everyone the story of how Manjusri had recovered the demon. They all knelt and bowed to the ground repeatedly.</P>
<P>Amid all the congratulations the gatekeeper came to report, &#8220;My lord, there are four more monks at the gates.&#8221; This news threw Pig into a panic.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; he said, &#8220;has the fiend used his magic to make a false Manjusri to fool us? Perhaps he's turned into a monk now for another battle of wits with us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; said Monkey, ordering that they be summoned inside.</P>
<P>The civil and military officials passed on the order and the monks were sent in. Monkey saw that they were monks from the Precious Wood Monastery bringing the king's crown, jade belt, yellow ochre robe and no-worry shoes.</P>
<P>&#8220;Splendid,&#8221; said Monkey with delight, &#8220;splendid.&#8221; He then asked the lay brothers to step forward, and made the king take off his monastic headcloth and put on his crown, remove his cotton habit and don his robe of yellow ochre, replace his silk belt with the jade belt, and kick off his monastic sandals for his no-worry shoes. Monkey then told the crown prince to fetch the white jade scepter for his father to hold, and invited the king to enter the throne-hall to rule once more.</P>
<P>As the old saying has it, &#8220;The court cannot be without a monarch for a single day.&#8221; The king refused to sit on the throne, but knelt in the middle of the steps weeping and saying, &#8220;Now that you have brought me back to life after I was dead for three years, Master, I can't possibly go on acting as king. Please ask your master to be king. It will be enough for me to take my wives and children to live as a commoner outside the city.&#8221; Sanzang absolutely refused to take the throne, his heart being utterly set on worshipping the Buddha and fetching the scriptures.</P>
<P>The king then offered the throne to Monkey, who said with a laugh, &#8220;I tell you frankly, gentlemen, if I'd wanted to be a king I could have been the king of every country on earth. But we're all used to being monks now&#8212;it's an easy life. If I were a king I'd have to grow my hair and I wouldn't be able to sleep at dusk or when the drum is beaten for the fifth watch. Whenever there was a report from the frontier I'd be worried, and I'd be distressed and helpless at reports of famine and disaster. I'd never get used to it. No, you go back to being a king, and I'll carry on and win merit as a monk.&#8221;</P>
<P>No matter how hard the king tried to refuse he finally had to enter the throne-hall, sit facing South on the throne, and call himself king. He issued a general amnesty, sent the monks of the Precious Wood Monastery back with rich presents, and opened up the Eastern hall of the palace to give a banquet for the Tang Priest. He also sent for painters to paint portraits of the Tang patriarch and his three disciples to hang in the throne hall.</P>
<P>Now that they had restored the country to peace the master and his disciples did not want to stay long; they were eager to take their leave of the king and carry on towards the West. The king, his queen and consorts, the crown prince and the ministers presented the country's greatest treasures as well as gold, silver, silk and satin to the patriarch as tokens of their thanks.</P>
<P>Sanzang accepted none of these gifts but only the return of his passport and urged Monkey and the other two to saddle the horse up and be on their way as soon as possible. The king was most upset. He ordered the state carriage brought out and invited the Tang Priest to ride in it. The two groups of civil and military officials led the way, while the king, his queen and consorts, and the crown prince pushed the wheels of the carriage. Only when they had passed through the outer walls of the city did Sanzang get down from the dragon carriage to take his leave of them all.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said the king, &#8220;please visit our country on your way back after collecting the scriptures in the Western Heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I hear and obey,&#8221; replied Sanzang. The king then returned with his ministers, weeping. The Tang Priest and his three disciples made their way along a twisting road, single-minded in their determination to worship at the Vulture Peak. By now autumn was just giving way to winter.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Bare stand the woods as frost carves out red leaves;</P>
<P>Ample the yellow millet ripened after rain.</P>
<P>Sun-warmed plum trees blossom in the dawn;</P>
<P>Cold sounds the bamboo shaken by the wind.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Master and disciples had now left the kingdom of Wuji. Resting at night and travelling by day, they had been going for the best part of a month when they saw a mountain in front of them that touched the sky and blotted out the sun. Sanzang was alarmed. Reining in the horse he called urgently for Monkey, who asked, &#8220;What are your orders, Master?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do you see that big mountain in front of us?&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;It's so sheer that I'm sure there must be evil creatures lurking on it to catch us, so be on your guard.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Just keep going and don't worry,&#8221; said Monkey with a laugh. &#8220;I'll protect you.&#8221; With that the venerable elder relaxed and spurred his horse on. When they reached the craggy mountain they saw that it was indeed precipitous:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Is it high?</P>
<P>It touches the azure firmament.</P>
<P>It is deep?</P>
<P>Its chasms open down to hell.</P>
<P>Before the mountain white clouds always billow.</P>
<P>Swirling black mists,</P>
<P>Red-blossoming plums, emerald bamboo,</P>
<P>Green cypresses and bluish pines.</P>
<P>Behind the mountain is a lofty soul-gripping pillar,</P>
<P>Concealing the fantastic caves of monsters.</P>
<P>Springs flow from the caves with cheerful voice,</P>
<P>And down ravines that twist and wind.</P>
<P>Apes swing from the sky to offer fruit;</P>
<P>Stags carry many-branching antlers,</P>
<P>While river deer shyly watch the strangers.</P>
<P>At duck the tigers climb to seek their dens;</P>
<P>Dragons emerge at dawn from out of the waters.</P>
<P>A sudden mighty roar at a cave's mouth</P>
<P>Sends birds noisily aloft with fright.</P>
<P>See how the woodland beasts skulk off.</P>
<P>At the sight of all these birds and beasts</P>
<P>The human heart beats hard in terror.</P>
<P>Spacious as halls are the caves,</P>
<P>All lined up along the peaks;</P>
<P>The granite rocks are coloured like pieces of jade;</P>
<P>Mist covers all as if with greenish gauze.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Master and disciples were already frightened enough when a red cloud emerged from a fold in the mountain and rose straight up into the sky, where it formed a ball of fire. Monkey was horrified. As he went to take a closer look he pushed the master's leg to get him off the horse and said, &#8220;Brothers, stay here. An evil spirit's coming.&#8221; In their alarm Pig grabbed his iron rake and Friar Sand his staff as they stood guard on either side of the Tang Priest.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Here the story divides into two. The red light was indeed from an evil spirit who had heard tell some years earlier that a Tang Priest from the East, a reincarnation of the Venerable Golden Cicada and a holy man who had cultivated his conduct through ten successive lives, was going to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures. Anyone who ate a piece of his flesh would live as long as heaven and earth. The evil spirit had been longing day in and day out for him to arrive, and now he was here. As the evil spirit looked at them from mid-air he saw the three disciples ready for action as they guarded the Tang Priest on his horse. The spirit was full of admiration.</P>
<P>&#8220;Now there's a monk for you,&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;I can just make out a fat, white-faced monk riding a horse. That must be the holy Tang Priest. But why is he surrounded by those three hideous monks? They've all clenched their fists, their sleeves are rolled up, and they're armed. They look as if they're ready for a fight. I wonder if any of them is sharp-eyed enough to see what I am? Looking the way that I do I haven't a hope of eating the Tang Priest's flesh.&#8221;</P>
<P>After he had been arguing it over for some time he said to himself, &#8220;If I try swooping down to grab him I won't get anywhere near him. I'll only get him if I trick him through cunning. Once I've hoodwinked him I can think of some crafty scheme that's bound to catch him. So I'll go down and try a few games with him.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid evil monster then dispersed his red light and brought his cloud down to land on the mountainside, where he turned himself with a shake of his body into a naughty boy of six, stark naked, tied hand and foot to the top of a pine tree, and shouting, &#8220;Help, help!&#8221;</P>
<P>When the Great Sage Monkey looked up again and saw that the red cloud and the fire had completely disappeared he told the master to remount and be on his way again.</P>
<P>&#8220;But you said an evil spirit was here; I don't dare move,&#8221; replied Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;Just now I saw a red cloud rise up from the ground,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;and turn into a ball of fire in mid-air. It was certainly an evil spirit. As the fire and the cloud have now gone I think it must just have been passing by and wasn't going to do us any harm. Let's go.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You make it sound all very convincing,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;but who ever heard of an evil spirit that just passed by?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You wouldn't know,&#8221; replied Monkey. &#8220;If the demon king of some mountain cave has invited the spirits from all the other caves in the mountains to a banquet, then the spirits from all around would be heading there. They'd be much more interested in the feast than in doing anyone any harm. That must have been a passing spirit.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang was only half-convinced, but he remounted and continued along the path up the mountain. On his way he heard a shout of &#8220;Help!&#8221; and said to his disciple with shock, &#8220;Disciple, what's that cheer in the middle of these mountains?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You just keep going, Master,&#8221; said Monkey, coming up to him. &#8220;Stop worrying about chairs, whether they're carried by people or mules, or whether they're open-topped or litters. Even if there were a chair here there'd be nobody to carry it for you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm not talking about chairs for carrying but about cheers,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;I know,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;but it's no concern of yours. You just keep going.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang did as he was told and whipped his horse forward. About a quarter of a mile later he heard another shout of &#8220;Help!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that's no goblin or demon shouting. If it were there'd be no echo. Listen to those shouts, one after another. I'm sure it's someone in trouble. We must go to the rescue.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;let's have a bit less of that compassion until we've crossed the mountain. Then you can be as compassionate as you like. This is an evil place. You must have heard how things can become spirits just as creepers attach themselves to trees. Most of them are no trouble, but there's one kind of python that's developed its powers for so long that it's become a spirit. It's got an amazing knowledge of the names people had as children. If you don't reply when it calls your name out from the undergrowth or from a mountain hollow you'll be fine; but if you answer a single word it'll grab your soul and will surely come and kill you the next night. Move! If you get away you can thank you lucky stars, as the saying goes. Whatever you do, ignore it.&#8221;</P>
<P>The venerable elder still had no choice but to obey and whip his horse on. &#8220;I don't know where that damned monster is,&#8221; thought Monkey. &#8220;He just keeps on shouting. I'll have to use separating magic to keep him and the master apart.&#8221; The splendid Great Sage then called Friar Sand to him and said, &#8220;Lead the horse on slowly while I take a piss.&#8221; Watch Monkey as he lets the Tang Priest get several paces ahead, says a spell to move mountains and make land shrink, and points behind him with his cudgel. Once master and disciples were over the peak they would have left this demon behind. He then hurried to catch up with the Tang Priest and press on up the mountain. But Sanzang heard another cry of &#8220;Help!&#8221; from the other side of the mountain.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that poor person is very unlucky to have missed us. We've passed him now. Can't you hear him shouting on the other side of the mountain?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If he's around he must still be on this side,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;It's just that the wind has changed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Never you mind about whether the wind has changed or not,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Keep moving.&#8221; From then on they all stopped talking and wished they could step over the mountain with a single stride.</P>
<P>The story switches back to the evil spirit, whose three or four shouts had found no response. &#8220;I've been waiting for the Tang Priest here,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;and I saw that he was only about a mile away. I wonder why he's still not here after all this time. He must have taken a short cut.&#8221; He then braced himself, slipped out of his bonds, and went up into the air again in his red light to take another look. He did not notice when the Great Sage looked up at him, recognized him as an evil spirit, and pushed the Tang Priest by his foot off the horse once more. &#8220;Brothers,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;be very careful. The evil spirit's coming back.&#8221; Again Pig and Friar Sand placed themselves on either side of the Tang Priest to protect him with their rake and staff.</P>
<P>The spirit was full of praise for all this as he noticed it from mid-air: &#8220;What fine monks! I saw the fat, white-faced one on the horse before: why have the other three hidden him? I'd better take a closer look to find out. I'll have to get rid of the sharp-eyed one first before I can catch the Tang Priest. Otherwise I'll have</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Wasted my worry without any gain,</P>
<P>Been to that trouble, and yet all in vain.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Once more he brought the cloud down, made the same transformation that he had the previous time, and waited at the top of a pine tree. This time he was only a few hundred yards away from them.</P>
<P>When the Great Sage Sun looked up yet again and saw that the red cloud had dispersed he once more asked the master to remount and press on. &#8220;But you told me the evil spirit was back,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;so why do you want me to keep going?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It was another passing one, and it won't dare try to harm us,&#8221; Monkey replied. At this the venerable elder lost his temper.</P>
<P>&#8220;Damned monkey. You keep trying to make a fool of me. When there really are evil monsters you say there's no problem, but in a quiet, peaceful place like this you keep giving me terrible frights by shouting about evil spirits. If I were to fall and injure myself I would certainly not forgive you. It's outrageous.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be cross with me, Master,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Even if you did hurt a hand or a foot in a fall it could be cured easy enough. But if an evil spirit got you I wouldn't know where to look for you.&#8221; Sanzang, who was by now in a raging fury, was only dissuaded from saying the Band-tightening Spell by Friar Sand's entreaties. Yet again he remounted to carry on with his journey.</P>
<P>He was not even settled in the saddle when he heard another call of &#8220;Help, master!&#8221; He looked up to see a little boy hanging naked in a tree. Reining in his horse he started to abuse Monkey again: &#8220;You damned scoundrel, ape. There's not a shred of kindness in you. All you can think of is wickedness and murder. I told you it was a human voice, but you kept yelling over and over again that it was a monster. Can't you see the boy in the tree?&#8221; As the master was so angry Monkey sneaked a glance at him and saw what sort of expression he was wearing. Then he bowed his head and made no reply, firstly because there was nothing he could do, and secondly because he was afraid that the master might say the spell.</P>
<P>When the Tang Priest reached the foot of the tree he pointed at the boy with his riding crop and asked, &#8220;Who are your parents? Why are you hanging up there? Tell me and I will save you.&#8221; Oh dear! He was truly an evil spirit to make himself look like that, but the master only had mortal, fleshly eyes and could not see what he was.</P>
<P>The evil spirit put on even more of an act on hearing these question. &#8220;Master,&#8221; he called, tears pouring down, &#8220;I live in the village by Withered Pine Ravine to the West of the mountain. My grandfather was known as Millionaire Hong because he had such a huge fortune. He died a long time ago and left everything to my father. Nowadays we throw our money around and we're not nearly as rich any more. That's why my father's called Hundred Thousand Hong. All he likes doing is making friends with all the big shots around and lending his gold and silver out at interest. But they were crooks who swindled him out of the lot, and he lost both capital and interest. My father swore never to lend out another penny. Then the people who borrowed from him became so desperate with poverty that they formed a gang. They attacked us in broad daylight with fire and weapons, stole all our goods, and killed my father. Because my mother is so beautiful they carried her off to be the bandit chief's woman. She couldn't bear to leave me behind, so she hid me in her clothes and went weeping and trembling with the bandits. When they got to this mountain the bandits wanted to kill me. They only spared me from the sword because of my mother's desperate pleas. Instead they tied me to this tree to die of cold and hunger. I don't know where the bandits have taken my mother. I've been hanging up here for three days and nights, and you're the first people to come past. I must have earned merit in a previous life to have met you in this one, Master. If in your great compassion you can rescue me and take me home I'd gladly sell myself into slavery in order to repay you. I won't forget what you've done for me even when I'm buried.&#8221;</P>
<P>Taking all this for the truth, Sanzang told Pig to undo the ropes and bring the boy down. The idiot, not realizing who he was, was just about to start doing it. This was more than Monkey could bear.</P>
<P>&#8220;Damned beast,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;there's someone here who can see what you are. Cut out all that nonsense, and stop trying to fool us. If all your family's goods have been stolen, your father has been murdered and your mother kidnapped, then who are we going to hand you to after we rescue you? What sort of reward will you give us? It doesn't hang together. It's a pack of lies.&#8221;</P>
<P>This frightened the evil spirit, who realized now that Monkey was an able opponent and was keeping an eye on him. So he trembled and wept as he continued, &#8220;Although I've lost both my parents and all my family's goods I've still got all our land and my other relations.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What relations?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;My other grandfather lives to the South of the mountain,&#8221; the evil spirit replied, &#8220;and my aunt's home is North of the ridge. Li the Fourth from the head of the ravine is married to my aunt, and Hong the Third in the woods is a distant uncle. I've also got cousins living around the village. If the venerable master will save me and take me back to the village and my relations I'll tell them all about the venerable master's kindness in rescuing me. I'll mortgage or sell some land, and reward you richly.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this Pig blocked Monkey's way and said, &#8220;Brother, you can't interrogate a little boy like that. He told you that the bandits only took his moveable goods&#8212;how could they have possibly taken his houses and land? If he tells his relations all about it the most we'll eat will be an acre and a half's worth, no matter how big our appetites are. Let's save him.&#8221; All the idiot could think about was his stomach. He did not care at all whether he was acting wisely as he cut through the ropes with his monk's knife and let the demon down from the tree. The demon then kept kowtowing and weeping copiously in front of the Tang Priest's horse. The tenderhearted priest said, &#8220;Come up on the horse, boy, and I'll carry you with me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said the boy, &#8220;my hands and feet are numb after hanging by them for so long, and my back is hurting too. Besides, we villagers don't know how to ride.&#8221; The Tang Priest then told Pig to carry the evil spirit, who stole a quick look at Pig and said, &#8220;Master, my skin is so tender after being frozen that I couldn't bear to have this gentleman carrying me. His long snout, big ears and the bristles on the back of his head would stick into me something terrible.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Friar Sand,&#8221; said the Tang Priest, &#8220;you carry him.&#8221;</P>
<P>The boy then took a glance at Friar Sand and said, &#8220;Master, when the bandits raided our house they gave me a terrible fright. They were all made up like actors, wore false beards, and carried sticks and swords. The sight of that evil-looking reverend gentleman scares the wits out of me. I wouldn't dare let him carry me.&#8221; The Tang Priest then told Monkey to carry the boy, to which Monkey agreed with a chuckle. The monster concealed his delight as he docilely let Monkey carry him. Monkey pulled him over to the side of the path and tried him for weight.</P>
<P>The boy was only about three pounds ten ounces heavy. &#8220;Damn you, you demon,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you die today. How dare you try your tricks on me! I know that you're one of those.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm the son of a good family who's had the bad luck to meet with disaster,&#8221; protested the demon. &#8220;What do you mean by calling me 'one of those?'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you're the son of a good family,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;then why are your bones so light?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have very small bones,&#8221; said the demon.</P>
<P>&#8220;How old are you?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Six this year,&#8221; the demon replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;You still ought to put on at least a pound a year,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile. &#8220;You should weigh at least six pounds: how come you're less than four?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I wasn't breastfed as a baby,&#8221; said the demon.</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well then,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;I'll carry you. But mind you warn me if you need to piss or shit.&#8221; Sanzang then pressed ahead with Pig and Friar Sand while Monkey brought up the rear with the demon on his back. They carried on towards the West, as this poem proves:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>High fiendish dangers face high virtue;</P>
<P>The stillness of meditation gives rise to evil spirits.</P>
<P>When the Heart Lord is upright and takes the middle way,</P>
<P>Wood's mother foolishly treads the wrong path.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Thought-horse silently nurses desires,</P>
<P>The Yellow Wife wordlessly worries and grieves.</P>
<P>When the stranger prospers he rejoices in vain;</P>
<P>From just this place must one vanish.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As the Great Sage Monkey carried the evil spirit he felt very resentful of the Tang Priest for not realizing how hard the going was for him. &#8220;It would be bad enough to cross these high mountains empty-handed, but he has to make me carry someone else too. Even if this wretch is a good boy and not an evil spirit, he's lost his parents and I don't know who I should take him to. Best thing would be to dash him to the ground and finish him off.&#8221;</P>
<P>The demon knew what Monkey was thinking, so he drew in four deep breaths from all around then blew them out again on Monkey's back, which made Monkey feel he weighed a thousand pounds.</P>
<P>&#8220;You're using extra-weight magic to weigh me down, my lad,&#8221; laughed Monkey. This made the monster afraid that Monkey was going to kill him, so he got his spirit out of his body and sprang up into the ninth layer of cloud. Now that Monkey was finding the load on his back even heavier he grabbed the boy and smashed him so hard against a rock by the path that the boy's body looked like minced pork. Then, just to make sure that the boy would give no more trouble, Monkey tore off all four of his limbs and ripped them into little pieces that he scattered on both sides of the path.</P>
<P>At this the demon, who was watching from mid-air, could hold back his fiery temper no longer. &#8220;This ape of a monk is thoroughly vicious,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Evil spirit wanting to kill your master I may be, but I've not yet laid my hands on him. How could you butcher me so atrociously? If I hadn't anticipated and got my spirit out you'd have slaughtered me in cold blood. I'm going to catch the Tang Priest here and now. If I delay any longer, he will become too clever.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid evil spirit then conjured up a whirlwind in mid-air. It was a terrible one that sent stones and dust flying. What a splendid wind:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The bowling whirlwind carried a stench over clouds and water;</P>
<P>The sun and moon were blacked out by its pall.</P>
<P>The trees along the ridge were soon uprooted;</P>
<P>The flowering plums were flattened, trunks and all.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sand-blinded travelers could barely walk along;</P>
<P>The paths were blocked by many a crashing rock.</P>
<P>Its swirling mass made all the earth seem dark;</P>
<P>The mountain creatures screamed and howled from shock.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>It blew so hard that Sanzang could barely stay on his horse, Pig could not look straight ahead, and Friar Sand had to bend and cover his face. Realizing that this was a devil's wind, the Great Sage rushed forward to catch them up, but the demon had already scooped the Tang Priest up in his wind. Sanzang had disappeared without a trace. Nobody could tell where he had been taken or where to start looking for him.</P>
<P>Before long the wind fell and the sun was shining again. Monkey went up and saw that the white dragon horse was trembling and neighing. The luggage had been thrown into the path, Pig was hiding under a crag and whimpering, and Friar Sand was squatting howling on the mountainside.</P>
<P>&#8220;Pig!&#8221; shouted Monkey, and recognizing his voice the idiot looked up to see that the storm was over.</P>
<P>He climbed to his feet, grabbed hold of Monkey, and said, &#8220;What a wind.&#8221;</P>
<P>Friar Sand came forward too and said, &#8220;That was a twister, brother. But where's the master?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The wind blew so hard,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;that we all had to hide our heads, close our eyes and take cover. The master lay down on the horse's back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But where's he gone now?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;He must have been blown away by the wind as if he were made of rushes,&#8221; replied Friar Sand.</P>
<P>&#8220;Well, brothers, we might as well split up here and now,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;the sooner the better. It would be a very good idea if we all went our separate ways. This journey to the Western Heaven is endless. We'll never get there.&#8221; Hearing them saying this made Friar Sand shudder and turn numb.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brothers, what terrible things to say,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We all committed crimes in our earlier lives and were converted by the Bodhisattva Guanyin who administered the vows to us and gave us our Buddhist names. We all adopted the Buddhist faith and volunteered to protect the Tang Priest on his journey to the West to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures. This is how we are going to atone for our crimes. If we give up here and talk about going our separate ways we'll fail to do the good deeds the Bodhisattva asked of us and we'll disgrace ourselves. People will jeer at us and say that we've got no staying power.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right, brother,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;But why wouldn't the master do as he was told? My fiery eyes and golden pupils can tell good from evil. The whirlwind just now was caused by the boy who was hanging in the tree. I could see he was an evil spirit, but neither of you nor the master could. He thought the boy was the son of a good family and made me carry him. Just when I'd decided to get rid of him he used his magic to make himself heavier and weigh me right down, so I smashed him to bits. I reckon he must have used his powers to escape from his body, call up the whirlwind and carry the master off. If only the master hadn't always ignored my advice. That's why I was so discouraged and said that we ought to split up. I accept your sincere advice, brother, but I don't know what to do. What do you suggest, Pig?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What I said just now was nonsense,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;I was talking off the top of my head. Of course we shouldn't split up. Brother, we'll just have to do as Friar Sand says, find the monster and save our master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, brother,&#8221; said Monkey cheerfully, his anger now gone, &#8220;let's all pull together. Get the baggage and the horse ready, and we'll go up the mountain to find the demon and save our master.&#8221;</P>
<P>The three of them pulled themselves up the mountainside and across ravines with the help of creepers, covering about twenty miles without finding any trace of the demon. The mountain was completely without birds and beasts, but there was many a tall pine. By now Monkey was really anxious, so he sprang up on a craggy peak, shouted, &#8220;Change!&#8221; and gave himself three heads and six arms, so that he looked just as he had when he made havoc in Heaven. Then he shook his gold-banded cudgel so that there were three of that too. With much whacking and thwacking he lashed out wildly to the East and to the West, clearing paths both ways.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is terrible, brother,&#8221; said Pig to Friar Sand. &#8220;Monkey'll never find the master this way&#8212;he's just in a furious temper.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey's lashing about flushed out a whole crowd of poverty-stricken local gods dressed in rags and tatters, with no seats to their breeches or legs to their trousers. They all knelt on the mountain slope and said, &#8220;Great Sage, we mountain gods and local deities pay our respects.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why are there so many of you?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; they replied, kowtowing, &#8220;this mountain is known as Mount Hao. It measures two hundred miles around. As there is a mountain god and a local deity every three miles or so that makes thirty mountain gods and thirty local deities. We heard yesterday that you were coming, Great Sage, but we have been late greeting you because we could not all assemble quickly enough. That is why the Great Sage has been so angry. We beg him to forgive us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll let you off this time,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;but I've got something to ask you: how many evil spirits are there on this mountain?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Just one, lord and master,&#8221; they replied, &#8220;but he's really beggared us. We get hardly any incense or paper offerings burnt for us now, and no food or blood at all. We have to go hungry and naked. How many evil spirits could we possibly support?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Which side of the mountain does he live on?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Neither,&#8221; they said. &#8220;In the middle of the mountain there's a ravine called the Withered Pine Ravine, and beside it there's a cave called the Fire-cloud Cave. In the cave lives a demon king who has tremendous magic powers. He's always capturing us mountain gods and local deities to tend his kitchen fire and watch his door, or to make us carry bells and shout to clear the way for him at night. And the little devils expect us to make regular payments to them too.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You are all gods from the spirit world, so where can you get money from?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;We haven't any,&#8221; the gods replied, &#8220;we have to muster all of us spirits morning and evening to catch a few deer, and if we haven't anything to offer, they'll come to tear down our shrines and take off our own clothes. He's made life impossible for us. We beg and beseech you to rid us of this monster and save all the spirits of these mountains.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As he controls you and you are always going to his cave you must know where he's from and what he's called,&#8221; said Brother Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;When we tell you we're sure you will have heard of him, Great Sage,&#8221; they replied. &#8220;He's the son of the Bull Demon King by Raksasi. He cultivated his conduct for three hundred years in the Fiery Mountains and developed True Samadhi Fire. His powers are tremendous. The Bull Demon King sent him here to hold this mountain. His name is Red Boy, and his title is Boy Sage King.&#8221;</P>
<P>This was good news for Monkey, who dismissed the local deities and mountain gods, resumed his original form, and jumped down from the peak. &#8220;Relax, brothers,&#8221; he said to Pig and Friar Sand, &#8220;no need to worry any more. The master won't possibly be killed. The evil spirit is a relation of mine.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop lying, brother,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;This is the Western Continent of Cattle-gift, and you come from the Eastern Continent of Superior Body. They're a very long way apart, with thousands of mountains and rivers between them, to say nothing of a couple of oceans. So how could he possibly be a relation of yours?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The crowd that turned up just now were the local deities and mountain gods from round here. When I asked them for some background on the demon they told me he is Red Boy, the son of the Bull Demon King by Raksasi, and he's also known as the Boy Sage King. When I made havoc in Heaven five hundred years ago I visited all the famous mountains and people of distinction in the world. The Bull Demon King took me as his seventh sworn younger brother. There were six demon kings altogether, and the only reason why I was prepared to call the Bull Demon King my elder brother was because I was a bit smaller than him. So as this devil is the Bull Demon King's son and I know his father, I'm his uncle. That means he couldn't possibly harm my master. I must be off straight away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But, brother,&#8221; said Pig with a laugh, &#8220;three years without paying a visit and relations are no longer relations, as the saying goes. You haven't seen him for five or six hundred years. You haven't even had a drink together or invited him over on holidays. There's no way he'll still treat you as a relation.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a way to judge people,&#8221; said Brother Monkey. &#8220;As another saying goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Every piece of duckweed floats down to the sea;</P>
<P>People will always meet each other somewhere.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Even if he doesn't regard me as a relation any more, at any rate he won't harm the master. I don't expect him to treat me to a slap-up meal, but he's bound to give me the Tang Priest back in one piece.&#8221; The three brother-disciples, their minds once more turned to pious thoughts, led the white horse loaded with the luggage along the path.</P>
<P>Without caring whether it was day or night they had covered some forty miles when they saw a pine woods through which a stream flowed in a twisting ravine. The water was green and pure, and at the head of the ravine was a stone bridge leading to a cave. &#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;I'm sure the evil spirit must live in that rock-face over there. Let's have a council of war to decide who looks after the luggage and the horse and who comes with me to subdue the demon.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;I'm no good at hanging around. I'll come with you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Fine,&#8221; said Monkey, continuing, &#8220;Friar Sand, hide the horse and the luggage deep in the woods and guard them carefully while we two go there to look for the master.&#8221; Friar Sand did as he was told, while Monkey and Pig went fully armed to the cave. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The vicious fire of a raw child won;</P>
<P>Mind-ape and Mother of Wood both helped.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know whether things turned out for good or for ill, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>婴儿戏化禅心乱</p>
<p>猿马刀归木母空</p>
</div>
<p>却说那孙大圣兄弟三人，按下云头，径至朝内，只见那君臣储后，几班儿拜接谢恩。行者将菩萨降魔收怪的那一节，陈诉与他君臣听了，一个个顶礼不尽。正都在贺喜之间，又听得黄门官来奏：“主公，外面又有四个和尚来也。”八戒慌了道：“哥哥，莫是妖精弄法，假捏文殊菩萨哄了我等，却又变作和尚，来与我们斗智哩？”行者道：“岂有此理！”即命宣进来看。众文武传令，着他进来。行者看时，原来是那宝林寺僧人，捧着那冲天冠、碧玉带、赭黄袍、无忧履进得来也。行者大喜道：“来得好！来得好！”且教道人过来，摘下包巾，戴上冲天冠；脱了布衣，穿上赭黄袍；解了绦子，系上碧玉带；褪了僧鞋，登上无忧履。教太子拿出白玉圭来，与他执在手里，早请上殿称孤，正是自古道：“朝廷不可一日无君。”那皇帝那里肯坐，哭啼啼跪在阶心道：“我已死三年，今蒙师父救我回生，怎么又敢妄自称尊？请那一位师父为君，我情愿领妻子城外为民足矣。”那三藏那里肯受，一心只是要拜佛求经。又请行者，行者笑道：“不瞒列位说，老孙若肯做皇帝，天下万国九州皇帝，都做遍了。只是我们做惯了和尚，是这般懒散。若做了皇帝，就要留头长发，黄昏不睡，五鼓不眠，听有边报，心神不安；见有灾荒，忧愁无奈。</p>

<p>我们怎么弄得惯？你还做你的皇帝，我还做我的和尚，修功行去也。”那国王苦让不过，只得上了宝殿，南面称孤，大赦天下，封赠了宝林寺僧人回去。却才开东阁，筵宴唐僧，一壁厢传旨宣召丹青，写下唐师徒四位喜容，供养在金銮殿上。</p>

<p>那师徒们安了邦国，不肯久停，欲辞王驾投西。那皇帝与三宫妃后、太子诸臣，将镇国的宝贝，金银缎帛，献与师父酬恩。那三藏分毫不受，只是倒换关文，催悟空等背马早行。那国王甚不过意，摆整朝銮驾请唐僧上坐，着两班文武引导，他与三宫妃后并太子一家儿，捧毂推轮，送出城廓，却才下龙辇，与众相别。国王道：“师父啊，到西天经回之日，是必还到寡人界内一顾。”三藏道：“弟子领命。”那皇帝阁泪汪汪，遂与众臣回去了。</p>

<p>那唐僧一行四僧，上了羊肠大路，一心里专拜灵山。正值秋尽冬初时节，但见霜凋红叶林林瘦，雨熟黄粱处处盈。日暖岭梅开晓色，风摇山竹动寒声。师徒们离了乌鸡国，夜住晓行，将半月有余，忽又见一座高山，真个是摩天碍日。三藏马上心惊，急兜缰忙呼行者。行者道：“师父有何吩咐？”三藏道：“你看前面又有大山峻岭，须要仔细堤防，恐一时又有邪物来侵我也。”行者笑道：“只管走路，莫再多心，老孙自有防护。”那长老只得宽怀，加鞭策马，奔至山岩，果然也十分险峻。但见得：高不高，顶上接青霄；深不深，涧中如地府。山前常见骨都都白云，扢腾腾黑雾。红梅翠竹，绿柏青松。山后有千万丈挟魂灵台，台后有古古怪怪藏魔洞，洞中有叮叮狢狢滴水泉，泉下更有弯弯曲曲流水涧。又见那跳天搠地献果猿，丫丫叉叉带角鹿，呢呢痴痴看人獐。至晚巴山寻穴虎，待晓翻波出水龙。登得洞门唿喇的响，惊得飞禽扑鲁的起，看那林中走兽鞠律律的行。见此一伙禽和兽，吓得人心扢磴磴惊。堂倒洞堂堂倒洞，洞堂当倒洞当仙。青石染成千块玉，碧纱笼罩万堆烟。师徒们正当悚惧，又只见那山凹里有一朵红云，直冒到九霄空内，结聚了一团火气。行者大惊，走近前，把唐僧搊着脚，推下马来，叫：“兄弟们，不要走了，妖怪来矣。”慌得个八戒急掣钉钯，沙僧忙轮宝杖，把唐僧围护在当中。</p>

<p>话分两头。却说红光里，真是个妖精。他数年前，闻得人讲：“东土唐僧往西天取经，乃是金蝉长老转生，十世修行的好人。有人吃他一块肉，延生长寿，与天地同休。”他朝朝在山间等候，不期今日到了。他在那半空里，正然观看，只见三个徒弟，把唐僧围护在马上，各各准备。这精灵夸赞不尽道：“好和尚！我才看着一个白面胖和尚骑了马，真是那唐朝圣僧，却怎么被三个丑和尚护持住了！一个个伸拳敛袖，各执兵器，似乎要与人打的一般。噫！不知是那个有眼力的，想应认得我了，似此模样，莫想得那唐僧的肉吃。”沉吟半晌，以心问心的自家商量道：“若要倚势而擒，莫能得近；或者以善迷他，却到得手。</p>

<p>但哄得他心迷惑，待我在善内生机，断然拿了。且下去戏他一戏。”好妖怪，即散红光，按云头落下，去那山坡里，摇身一变，变作七岁顽童，赤条条的，身上无衣，将麻绳捆了手足，高吊在那松树梢头，口口声声，只叫“救人！救人！”</p>

<p>却说那孙大圣忽抬头再看处，只见那红云散尽，火气全无，便叫：“师父，请上马走路。”唐僧道：“你说妖怪来了，怎么又敢走路？”行者道：“我才然间，见一朵红云从地而起，到空中结做一团火气，断然是妖精。这一会红云散了，想是个过路的妖精，不敢伤人，我们去耶！”八戒笑道：“师兄说话最巧，妖精又有个甚么过路的？”行者道：“你那里知道，若是那山那洞的魔王设宴，邀请那诸山各洞之精赴会，却就有东南西北四路的精灵都来赴会，故此他只有心赴会，无意伤人。此乃过路之妖精也。”三藏闻言，也似信不信的，只得攀鞍在马，顺路奔山前进。正行时，只听得叫声“救人！”长老大惊道：“徒弟呀，这半山中，是那里甚么人叫？”行者上前道：“师父只管走路，莫缠甚么人轿骡轿，明轿睡轿。这所在，就有轿，也没个人抬你。”唐僧道：“不是扛抬之轿，乃是叫唤之叫。”行者笑道：“我晓得，莫管闲事，且走路。”</p>

<p>三藏依言，策马又进，行不上一里之遥，又听得叫声“救人！”长老道：“徒弟，这个叫声，不是鬼魅妖邪；若是鬼魅妖邪，但有出声，无有回声。你听他叫一声，又叫一声，想必是个有难之人，我们可去救他一救。”行者道：“师父，今日且把这慈悲心略收起收起，待过了此山，再发慈悲罢。这去处凶多吉少，你知道那倚草附木之说，是物可以成精。诸般还可，只有一般蟒蛇，但修得年远日深，成了精魅，善能知人小名儿。他若在草科里，或山凹中，叫人一声，人不答应还可；若答应一声，他就把人元神绰去，当夜跟来，断然伤人性命。且走！且走！古人云，脱得去，谢神明，切不可听他。”长老只得依他，又加鞭催马而去，行者心中暗想：“这泼怪不知在那里，只管叫阿叫的。等我老孙送他一个卯酉星法，教他两不见面。”好大圣，叫沙和尚前来：“拢着马，慢慢走着，让老孙解解手。”你看他让唐僧先行几步，却念个咒语，使个移山缩地之法，把金箍棒往后一指，他师徒过此峰头，往前走了，却把那怪物撇下，他再拽开步，赶上唐僧，一路奔山。只见那三藏又听得那山背后叫声“救人！”长老道：“徒弟呀，那有难的人，大没缘法，不曾得遇着我们。我们走过他了，你听他在山后叫哩。”八戒道：“在便还在山前，只是如今风转了也。”行者道：“管他甚么转风不转风，且走路。”因此，遂都无言语，恨不得一步插过此山，不题话下。</p>

<p>却说那妖精在山坡里，连叫了三四声，更无人到，他心中思量道：“我等唐僧在此，望见他离不上三里，却怎么这半晌还不到？想是抄下路去了。”他抖一抖身躯，脱了绳索，又纵红光，上空再看。不觉孙大圣仰面回观，识得是妖怪，又把唐僧撮着脚推下马来道：“兄弟们，仔细！仔细！那妖精又来也！”慌得那八戒、沙僧各持兵刀，将唐僧又围护在中间。那精灵见了，在半空中称羡不已道：“好和尚！我才见那白面和尚坐在马上，却怎么又被他三人藏了？这一去见面方知。先把那有眼力的弄倒了，方才捉得唐僧。不然啊，徒费心机难获物，枉劳情兴总成空。”却又按下云头，恰似前番变化，高吊在松树山头等候，这番却不上半里之地。</p>

<p>却说那孙大圣抬头再看，只见那红云又散，复请师父上马前行。三藏道：“你说妖精又来，如何又请走路？”行者道：“这还是个过路的妖精，不敢惹我们。”长老又怀怒道：“这个泼猴，十分弄我！正当有妖魔处，却说无事；似这般清平之所，却又恐吓我，不时的嚷道有甚妖精。虚多实少，不管轻重，将我搊着脚，捽下马来，如今却解说甚么过路的妖精。假若跌伤了我，却也过意不去！这等，这等！”行者道：“师父莫怪，若是跌伤了你的手足，却还好医治；若是被妖精捞了去，却何处跟寻？”三藏大怒，哏哏的，要念《紧箍儿咒》，却是沙僧苦劝，只得上马又行。</p>

<p>还未曾坐得稳，只听又叫“师父救人啊！”长老抬头看时，原来是个小孩童，赤条条的，吊在那树上，兜住缰，便骂行者道：“这泼猴多大惫懒！全无有一些儿善良之意，心心只是要撒泼行凶哩！我那般说叫唤的是个人声，他就千言万语只嚷是妖怪！你看那树上吊的不是个人么？”大圣见师父怪下来了，却又觌面看见模样，一则做不得手脚，二来又怕念《紧箍儿咒》，低着头，再也不敢回言，让唐僧到了树下。那长老将鞭梢指着问道：“你是那家孩儿？因有甚事，吊在此间？说与我，好救你。”噫！分明他是个精灵，变化得这等，那师父却是个肉眼凡胎，不能相识。</p>

<p>那妖魔见他下问，越弄虚头，眼中噙泪，叫道：“师父呀，山西去有一条枯松涧，涧那边有一庄村，我是那里人家。我祖公公姓红，只因广积金银，家私巨万，混名唤做红百万。年老归世已久，家产遗与我父。近来人事奢侈，家私渐废，改名唤做红十万，专一结交四路豪杰，将金银借放，希图利息。怎知那无籍之人，设骗了去啊，本利无归。我父发了洪誓，分文不借。那借金银人，身贫无计，结成凶党，明火执杖，白日杀上我门，将我财帛尽情劫掳，把我父亲杀了，见我母亲有些颜色，拐将去做甚么压寨夫人。那时节，我母亲舍不得我，把我抱在怀里，哭哀哀，战兢兢，跟随贼寇，不期到此山中，又要杀我，多亏我母亲哀告，免教我刀下身亡，却将绳子吊我在树上，只教冻饿而死，那些贼将我母亲不知掠往那里去了。我在此已吊三日三夜，更没一个人来行走。不知那世里修积，今生得遇老师父，若肯舍大慈悲，救我一命回家，就典身卖命，也酬谢师恩，致使黄沙盖面，更不敢忘也。”三藏闻言，认了真实，就教八戒解放绳索，救他下来。那呆子也不识人，便要上前动手，行者在旁，忍不住喝了一声道：“那泼物！有认得你的在这里哩！莫要只管架空捣鬼，说谎哄人！你既家私被劫，父被贼伤，母被人掳，救你去交与谁人？你将何物与我作谢？这谎脱节了耶！”那怪闻言，心中害怕，就知大圣是个能人，暗将他放在心上，却又战战兢兢，滴泪而言曰：“师父，虽然我父母空亡，家财尽绝，还有些田产未动，亲戚皆存。”行者道：“你有甚么亲戚？”妖怪道：“我外公家在山南，姑娘住居岭北。涧头李四，是我姨夫；林内红三，是我族伯。还有堂叔堂兄都住在本庄左右。老师父若肯救我，到了庄上，见了诸亲，将老师父拯救之恩，一一对众言说，典卖些田产，重重酬谢也。”八戒听说，扛住行者道：“哥哥，这等一个小孩子家，你只管盘诘他怎的！他说得是，强盗只打劫他些浮财，莫成连房屋田产也劫得去？若与他亲戚们说了，我们纵有广大食肠，也吃不了他十亩田价。救他下来罢。”呆子只是想着吃食，那里管甚么好歹，使戒刀挑断绳索，放下怪来。那怪对唐僧马下，泪汪汪只情磕头。长老心慈，便叫：“孩儿，你上马来，我带你去。”那怪道：“师父啊，我手脚都吊麻了，腰胯疼痛，一则是乡下人家，不惯骑马。”唐僧叫八戒驮着，那妖怪抹了一眼道：“师父，我的皮肤都冻熟了，不敢要这位师父驮。他的嘴长耳大，脑后鬃硬，搠得我慌。”唐僧道：“教沙和尚驮着。”那怪也抹了一眼道：“师父，那些贼来打劫我家时，一个个都搽了花脸，带假胡子，拿刀弄杖的。我被他唬怕了，见这位晦气脸的师父，一发没了魂了，也不敢要他驮。”唐僧教孙行者驮着，行者呵呵笑道：“我驮！我驮！”那怪物暗自欢喜，顺顺当当的要行者驮他。行者把他扯在路旁边，试了一试，只好有三斤十来两重。</p>

<p>行者笑道：“你这个泼怪物，今日该死了，怎么在老孙面前捣鬼！我认得你是个那话儿呵。”妖怪道：“师父，我是好人家儿女，不幸遭此大难，我怎么是个甚么那话儿？”行者道：“你既是好人家儿女，怎么这等骨头轻？”妖怪道：“我骨格儿小。”行者道：“你今年几岁了？”那怪道：“我七岁了。”行者笑道：“一岁长一斤，也该七斤，你怎么不满四斤重么？”那怪道：“我小时失乳。”行者说：“也罢，我驮着你，若要尿尿把把，须和我说。”三藏才与八戒、沙僧前走，行者背着孩儿随后，一行径投西去。有诗为证，诗曰：道德高隆魔障高，禅机本静静生妖。心君正直行中道，木母痴顽躧外趫。意马不言怀爱欲，黄婆无语自忧焦。客邪得志空欢喜，毕竟还从正处消。孙大圣驮着妖魔，心中埋怨唐僧，不知艰苦，“行此险峻山场，空身也难走，却教老孙驮人。</p>

<p>这厮莫说他是妖怪，就是好人，他没了父母，不知将他驮与何人，倒不如掼杀他罢。”那怪物却早知觉了，便就使个神通，往四下里吸了四口气，吹在行者背上，便觉重有千斤。行者笑道：“我儿啊，你弄重身法压我老爷哩！”那怪闻言，恐怕大圣伤他，却就解尸，出了元神，跳将起去，佇立在九霄空里，这行者背上越重了。猴王发怒，抓过他来，往那路旁边赖石头上滑辣的一掼，将尸骸掼得象个肉饼一般，还恐他又无礼，索性将四肢扯下，丢在路两边，俱粉碎了。</p>

<p>那物在空中，明明看着，忍不住心头火起道：“这猴和尚，十分惫懒！就作我是个妖魔，要害你师父，却还不曾见怎么下手哩，你怎么就把我这等伤损！早是我有算计，出神走了，不然，是无故伤生也。若不趁此时拿了唐僧，再让一番，越教他停留长智。”好怪物，就在半空里弄了一阵旋风，呼的一声响亮，走石扬沙，诚然凶狠。好风：淘淘怒卷水云腥，黑气腾腾闭日明。岭树连根通拔尽，野梅带干悉皆平。黄沙迷目人难走，怪石伤残路怎平。滚滚团团平地暗，遍山禽兽发哮声。刮得那三藏马上难存，八戒不敢仰视，沙僧低头掩面。孙大圣情知是怪物弄风，急纵步来赶时，那怪已骋风头，将唐僧摄去了，无踪无影，不知摄向何方，无处跟寻。</p>

<p>一时间，风声暂息，日色光明。行者上前观看，只见白龙马战兢兢发喊声嘶，行李担丢在路下，八戒伏于崖下呻吟，沙僧蹲在坡前叫唤。行者喊：“八戒！”那呆子听见是行者的声音，却抬头看时，狂风已静，爬起来，扯住行者道：“哥哥，好大风啊！”</p>

<p>沙僧却也上前道：“哥哥，这是一阵旋风。”又问：“师父在那里？”八戒道：“风来得紧，我们都藏头遮眼，各自躲风，师父也伏在马上的。”行者道：“如今却往那里去了？”沙僧道：“是个灯草做的，想被一风卷去也。”行者道：“兄弟们，我等自此就该散了！”八戒道：“正是，趁早散了，各寻头路，多少是好。那西天路无穷无尽，几时能到得！”沙僧闻言，打了一个失惊，浑身麻木道：“师兄，你都说的是那里话。我等因为前生有罪，感蒙观世音菩萨劝化，与我们摩顶受戒，改换法名，皈依佛果，情愿保护唐僧上西方拜佛求经，将功折罪。今日到此，一旦俱休，说出这等各寻头路的话来，可不违了菩萨的善果，坏了自己的德行，惹人耻笑，说我们有始无终也！”行者道：“兄弟，你说的也是，奈何师父不听人说，我老孙火眼金睛，认得好歹，才然这风，是那树上吊的孩儿弄的。我认得他是个妖精，你们不识，那师父也不识，认作是好人家儿女，教我驮着他走。是老孙算计要摆布他，他就弄个重身法压我。是我把他掼得粉碎，他想是又使解尸之法，弄阵旋风，把我师父摄去也。因此上怪他每每不听我说。故我意懒心灰，说各人散了。既是贤弟有此诚意，教老孙进退两难。八戒，你端的要怎的处？”八戒道：“我才自失口乱说了几句，其实也不该散。哥哥，没及奈何，还信沙弟之言，去寻那妖怪救师父去。”行者却回嗔作喜道：“兄弟们，还要来结同心，收拾了行李马匹，上山找寻怪物，搭救师父去。”三个人附葛扳藤，寻坡转涧，行经有五七十里，却也没个音信，那山上飞禽走兽全无，老柏乔松常见。孙大圣着实心焦，将身一纵，跳上那巅险峰头，喝一声叫“变！”变作三头六臂，似那大闹天宫的本象，将金箍棒，幌一幌，变作三根金箍棒，劈哩扑辣的，往东打一路，往西打一路，两边不住的乱打。八戒见了道：“沙和尚，不好了，师兄是寻不着师父，恼出气心风来了。”</p>

<p>那行者打了一会，打出一伙穷神来，都披一片，挂一片，裩无裆，裤无口的，跪在山前，叫：“大圣，山神土地来见。”行者道：“怎么就有许多山神土地？”众神叩头道：“上告大圣，此山唤做六百里钻头号山。我等是十里一山神，十里一土地，共该三十名山神，三十名土地。昨日已此闻大圣来了，只因一时会不齐，故此接迟，致令大圣发怒，万望恕罪。”行者道：“我且饶你罪名。我问你：这山上有多少妖精？”众神道：“爷爷呀，只有得一个妖精，把我们头也摩光了，弄得我们少香没纸，血食全无，一个个衣不充身，食不充口，还吃得有多少妖精哩！”行者道：“这妖精在山前住，是山后住？”众神道：“他也不在山前山后。这山中有一条涧，叫做枯松涧，涧边有一座洞，叫做火云洞，那洞里有一个魔王，神通广大，常常的把我们山神土地拿了去，烧火顶门，黑夜与他提铃喝号。小妖儿又讨甚么常例钱。”行者道：“汝等乃是阴鬼之仙，有何钱钞？”众神道：“正是没钱与他，只得捉几个山獐野鹿，早晚间打点群精；若是没物相送，就要来拆庙宇，剥衣裳，搅得我等不得安生！万望大圣与我等剿除此怪，拯救山上生灵。”行者道：“你等既受他节制，常在他洞下，可知他是那里妖精，叫做甚么名字？”众神道：“说起他来，或者大圣也知道。他是牛魔王的儿子，罗刹女养的。他曾在火焰山修行了三百年，炼成三昧真火，却也神通广大。牛魔王使他来镇守号山，乳名叫做红孩儿，号叫做圣婴大王。”行者闻言满心欢喜，喝退了土地山神，却现了本象，跳下峰头，对八戒沙僧道：“兄弟们放心，再不须思念，师父决不伤生，妖精与老孙有亲。”八戒笑道：“哥哥，莫要说谎。你在东胜神洲，他这里是西牛贺洲，路程遥远，隔着万水千山，海洋也有两道，怎的与你有亲？”行者道：“刚才这伙人都是本境土地山神。我问他妖怪的原因，他道是牛魔王的儿子，罗刹女养的，名字唤做红孩儿，号圣婴大王。想我老孙五百年前大闹天宫时，遍游天下名山，寻访大地豪杰，那牛魔王曾与老孙结七弟兄。一般五六个魔王，止有老孙生得小巧，故此把牛魔王称为大哥。这妖精是牛魔王的儿子，我与他父亲相识，若论将起来，还是他老叔哩，他怎敢害我师父？我们趁早去来。”沙和尚笑道：“哥啊，常言道：三年不上门，当亲也不亲哩。你与他相别五六百年，又不曾往还杯酒，又没有个节礼相邀，他那里与你认甚么亲耶？”</p>

<p>行者道：“你怎么这等量人！常言道，一叶浮萍归大海，为人何处不相逢！纵然他不认亲，好道也不伤我师父。不望他相留酒席，必定也还我个囫囵唐僧。”三兄弟各办虔心，牵着白马，马上驮着行李，找大路一直前进。无分昼夜，行了百十里远近，忽见一松林，林中有一条曲涧，涧下有碧澄澄的活水飞流，那涧梢头有一座石板桥，通着那厢洞府。行者道：“兄弟，你看那壁厢有石崖磷磷，想必是妖精住处了。我等从众商议，那个管看守行李马匹，那个肯跟我过去降妖？”八戒道：“哥哥，老猪没甚坐性，我随你去罢。”行者道：“好！好！”教沙僧：“将马匹行李俱潜在树林深处，小心守护，待我两个上门去寻师父耶。”那沙僧依命，八戒相随，与行者各持兵器前来。正是：未炼婴儿邪火胜，心猿木母共扶持。毕竟不知这一去吉凶何如，且听下回分解。
