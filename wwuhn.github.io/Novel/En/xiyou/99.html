<div class="title">
<P>When the Ape and the Horse Are Tamed They Cast Off Their Husks</P>
<P>When All the Deeds Have Been Done Reality Is Seen</P>
</div>
<P>The story told how after coming back to life Mr. Kou once more arranged for parasols, banners, drummers, musicians, Buddhist monks, Taoist priests, his friends and his relations to see Sanzang off again. But instead of describing this we will tell of the Tang Priest and his three disciples taking the main road. The West was indeed a land of the Buddha, unlike anywhere else. They saw precious flowers, rare grasses, ancient cypresses and hoary pines. In all the places they passed through every family was pious and fed monks. Under every mountain people cultivated their conduct; in all the forests travelers recited sutras Master and disciples took shelter each night and set out at dawn, till six or seven days later a mass of high buildings and splendid halls suddenly came into view. Truly they were:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Thrusting a hundred feet into the heavens,</P>
<P>Touching the Milky Way in the sky.</P>
<P>Lower your head and see the setting sun;</P>
<P>Put out your hand and pluck a shooting star.</P>
<P>The spacious windows enclose the cosmos;</P>
<P>The towering roofbeams join up with the clouds.</P>
<P>Yellow cranes bring letters as the autumn trees grow old;</P>
<P>Coloured phoenix epistles come in the fresh evening breeze.</P>
<P>These are sacred and precious palaces and gates,</P>
<P>Jeweled, intricate buildings and courtyards.</P>
<P>In the holy halls the Way is discussed;</P>
<P>Sutras are transmitted throughout the universe.</P>
<P>The flowers are beautiful as they turn towards the spring;</P>
<P>Green are the pine trees in the rain.</P>
<P>Purple fungus and immortals' fruits ever flourish;</P>
<P>All beings respond as red phoenixes soar.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sanzang raised his whip and pointed with it as he said, &#8220;What a fine place, Wukong.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;when you were in those delusive places where you saw false images of Buddhas you insisted on prostrating yourself in front of them. But today, when you've reached the real place where there is the true image of the Buddha, you won't even dismount. What do you mean by it?&#8221; No sooner did he hear this than Sanzang sprang straight out of the saddle and went to the gateway.</P>
<P>A young lay brother who stood to one side of the monastery gateway called out, &#8220;You must be the people from the East who have come to fetch the scriptures.&#8221; The venerable elder quickly straightened his clothes and raised his head to look around. He saw that the boy was</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Wearing clothes of golden brocade,</P>
<P>Waving a jade-handled whisk.</P>
<P>Wearing clothes of golden brocade</P>
<P>He feasted in pavilions by the Jasper Pool;</P>
<P>Waving a jade-handled whisk</P>
<P>He dusted the steps of the purple palaces.</P>
<P>At his side hung an immortal's tablet;</P>
<P>And on his feet were sandals.</P>
<P>He was a true winged adept,</P>
<P>Elegant and remarkable.</P>
<P>Having won immortality he lived in a wonderful land,</P>
<P>Cultivating eternal life and escaping from worldly dust.</P>
<P>The holy priest did not recognize the stranger on Vulture Peak,</P>
<P>The Gold-crested Immortal of yesteryear.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Great Sage Monkey did, however, recognize him. &#8220;Master,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;this is the Great Gold-crested Immortal who lives at the Jade Truth Temple at the foot of Vulture Peak. He is here to greet us.&#8221; Only then did Sanzang realize who he was and step forward to salute him.</P>
<P>&#8220;You have finally arrived here this year,&#8221; replied the Great Immortal with a smile. &#8220;I was fooled by the Bodhisattva Guanyin. Ten years ago she went to the East at the Buddha's command to find the Pilgrim who would fetch the scriptures. She told me then he would be here within two or three years. I have been waiting for years on end with no news of you at all. I never thought that it would be this year before we met.&#8221;</P>
<P>Putting his hands together in front of his chest, Sanzang replied, &#8220;I am very grateful to you for your kindness, Great Immortal, very grateful.&#8221; Sanzang and his three disciples led the horse and carried the baggage with them into the Taoist temple, where they were introduced to all the Great Immortals there. Tea and a vegetarian meal were then ordered, and the Taoist boys were told to heat scented water for the holy monks to bathe in before climbing to the Buddha land. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When achievements are complete it is right to bathe;</P>
<P>The fundamental nature has been trained into innate truth.</P>
<P>Many thousand troubles and today:</P>
<P>The nine prohibitions and triple surrender lead to renewal.</P>
<P>The monsters all done with, they climb to the Buddha land;</P>
<P>With disasters ended they see the Sramana.</P>
<P>Dirt and filth now washed away, they are wholly pure;</P>
<P>Returning to the fundamental, their bodies are imperishable.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>By the time master and disciples had bathed the day was drawing to a close. They spent the night in the Jade Truth Temple.</P>
<P>The next morning the Tang Priest changed into his brocade cassock, put on his Vairocana mitre and grasped his monastic staff in his hand to climb the steps of the main hall and take his leave of the Great Immortal. &#8220;Yesterday you were in rags,&#8221; the Great Immortal said with a smile, &#8220;but today you are dressed in splendor. I can see from your appearance that you are indeed a son of the Buddha.&#8221; Sanzang then bowed in farewell.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wait a moment,&#8221; the Great Immortal said. &#8220;I will see you off.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no need for you to see us off,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;I know the way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What you know,&#8221; said the Great Immortal, &#8220;is the way by cloud. The holy monk has never gone by cloud. He must go by the overland way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right,&#8221; replied Monkey. &#8220;Although I've been here several times I've always come and gone by cloud. I've never come here on foot. If there's an overland route I'll trouble you to see us along it. My master is very serious about worshipping the Buddha, so I'd be very grateful if you could hurry up about it.&#8221; The Great Immortal chuckled as he took the Tang Priest by hand and led the Incense to the gate of the Dharma. The way led not out by the temple's front entrance but through the main hall and out through the back gate.</P>
<P>Pointing towards Vulture Peak, the Great Immortal said, &#8220;Holy monk, do you see the auspicious light of many colours and the richly textured aura in the sky? That is the summit of Vulture Peak, the holy territory of the Lord Buddha.&#8221; As soon as he saw it the Tang Priest bowed low.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Brother Monkey with a smile, &#8220;we haven't got to the place for bowing yet. As the saying goes, 'The mountain may be in view, but your horse will collapse before you get there.' We're still quite a long way from the place, so why start bowing now? If you bow all the way from here to the top, however many times will you have to hit your head on the ground?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Holy monk,&#8221; said the Great Immortal, &#8220;You, the Great Sage, Marshal Tian Peng, and the Curtain-raising General have now reached the blessed land and seen Vulture Peak. I am going back now.&#8221; Sanzang took his leave of the Great Immortal and continued on his way.</P>
<P>The Great Sage led the Tang Priest and the others slowly up Vulture Peak. Within a couple of miles they reached a river of mighty rolling waves some three miles wide. There was no sign of anyone anywhere around.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said Sanzang with alarm, &#8220;we have come the wrong way. I wonder if the Great Immortal misdirected us. This river is so wide and the waves so big, and there are no boats to be seen. How are we to cross it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He didn't send us the wrong way,&#8221; replied Monkey with a smile. &#8220;Look over there. That's a bridge, isn't it? Once we're over that we'll have completed the true achievement.&#8221; When the venerable elder and the others went closer to look they saw a tablet beside it on which were written the words CLOUDTOUCHING CROSSING. Now this bridge was only a single log. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>From afar it seemed to span the void like a beam of jade;</P>
<P>Seen closer, the bridge was but a withered spar crossing the water.</P>
<P>To bind a river and frame the sea is easier</P>
<P>Than walking along the trunk of a single tree.</P>
<P>The glow of a myriad rainbows spread out all around;</P>
<P>A thousand lengths of fine white silk stretched to the edge of the sky.</P>
<P>It was narrow, slippery and hard to cross,</P>
<P>Unless one was a god who could walk on coloured clouds.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said Sanzang in fear and trembling, &#8220;no mortal man could cross that bridge. Let us look elsewhere to find the way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But this is the way,&#8221; replied Monkey with a smile, &#8220;this is the way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Nobody's going to dare cross that even if it is the right way,&#8221; said Pig with alarm. &#8220;The river's so wide, and there are those terrible waves, and all there is is that narrow, slippery tree-trunk. We couldn't take a single step.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You all stand there while I go on it to show you,&#8221; replied Monkey.</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage strode forward and sprang on the single-trunk bridge. He quickly ran across to the other side, swaying as he went, and called out, &#8220;Come over, come over.&#8221; The Tang Priest waved in refusal, while Pig and Friar Sand bit their fingers and said, &#8220;It's much too hard.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey then ran back again from the far side and pulled at Pig. &#8220;Come with me, you idiot,&#8221; he said, &#8220;come with me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's too slippery, it's too slippery,&#8221; said Pig, lying down on the ground. &#8220;I could never cross it. Please spare me that and let me cross by wind and mist.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey held him down as he replied, &#8220;This is no place for you to be allowed to go riding wind and mist. You can only become a Buddha by crossing this bridge.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;I'll never make it. Honestly, I can't walk across.&#8221;</P>
<P>As the two of them were pulling at each other and fighting, Friar Sand went over to talk them round. Only then did they let go of each other. Sanzang then looked round to see a man poling a boat towards them from downriver and shouting, &#8220;Ferry! Come aboard.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop fooling around, disciples,&#8221; said a delighted venerable elder. &#8220;There is a ferry-boat coming.&#8221; The other three sprang to their feet and all watched together as the boat drew closer. It was a bottomless craft.</P>
<P>Monkey had already spotted with the golden pupils in his fiery eyes that this was the Welcoming Lord Buddha, who is also known as Ratnadhvaja, the Royal Buddha of Brightness, but instead of giving this away he just kept calling, &#8220;Over here, punt, over here.&#8221;</P>
<P>A moment later the ferryman had punted his boat up to the bank and was again shouting, &#8220;Ferry! Come aboard!&#8221; Sanzang was once more alarmed at the sight. &#8220;Your boat has no bottom,&#8221; he said, &#8220;so however could you ferry anyone across?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This boat of mine,&#8221; the Buddha said,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Has been famous since Chaos was first divided,</P>
<P>And been punted by me without any changes.</P>
<P>It is stable in wind and stable in waves,</P>
<P>Enjoying great peace with no start and no end.</P>
<P>Untouched by the six types of dust, it returns to the One,</P>
<P>Carries on calmly through all kinds of calamity.</P>
<P>Hard it is for a bottomless boat to cross the oceans,</P>
<P>But since ancient times it has ferried all creatures.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Great Sage Monkey put his hands together in front of his chest and thanked him with the words, &#8220;I am grateful to you for your generosity in coming to welcome my master. Step aboard, Master. That boat of his may have no bottom, but it's stable, and won't capsize even in wind and waves.&#8221; The venerable elder was still very doubtful, but Monkey seized him by the arms and pushed him forward. Unable to keep on his feet, the master tumbled into the water, where the ferryman grabbed hold of him at once and stood him on the boat. The master shook his clothes and stamped his feet, complaining about Monkey, who led Friar Sand and Pig to stand on board bringing the luggage and the horse with them.</P>
<P>Gently and strongly the Buddha pushed off, at which a corpse came floating downstream, to the horror of the venerable elder. &#8220;Don't be frightened, Master,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;That's you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's you, it's you,&#8221; said Pig. Friar Sand clapped his hands as he said, &#8220;It's you, it's you!&#8221;</P>
<P>The boatman gave a call, then also put in, too, &#8220;It's you! Congratulations! Congratulations!&#8221; The three of them all joined in these congratulations as the ferryman punted the boat quickly and steadily over the immortal Cloud-touching Crossing. Sanzang turned around and sprang lightly ashore on the opposite bank. There is a poem about this that goes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the womb-born flesh and body of blood is cast aside,</P>
<P>The primal spirit finds kinship and love.</P>
<P>On this morning of actions completed and Buddhahood attained</P>
<P>The thirty-six kinds of dust from the past are washed away.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This was indeed what is meant by great wisdom, the boundless dharma of crossing to the other bank. When the four of them climbed the bank and looked back the bottomless boat had already disappeared, goodness knew where. Only when Brother Monkey explained that it had been the Welcoming Buddha did Sanzang find enlightenment At once he turned round to thank his three disciples.</P>
<P>&#8220;Let's not exchange thanks,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;We've helped each other. You saved us three, Master, and showed us the way to win merit so as to complete the true achievement. And we have protected you, Master, holding to the faith and helping you happily to cast off your mortal body. Master, look at the magnificent scenery ahead. Flowers, grasses, pines and bamboo, as well as phoenixes, cranes and deer. Compare it with those places where evil beings created illusions through transformation. Ask yourself which is beautiful and good, and which ugly and evil.&#8221; Sanzang was full of expressions of gratitude. All of them were now light of body and cheerful as they walked up Vulture Peak. Soon the ancient Thunder Monastery could be seen:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Its rooftops touched the heavens,</P>
<P>Its roots joined with the Sumeru range.</P>
<P>Amazing peaks spread out in serried rank;</P>
<P>Craggy rocks formed interlocking shapes.</P>
<P>Under the hanging scar were wonderful plants and flowers;</P>
<P>Beside the winding path grew magic mushrooms and orchids.</P>
<P>Immortal apes were picking the fruit of the peach trees,</P>
<P>Like gold amid burning flames;</P>
<P>White cranes perched in the branches of the pines</P>
<P>As if they were jade creatures amid smoke.</P>
<P>Coloured phoenixes in pairs,</P>
<P>Green phoenixes two by two.</P>
<P>The pairs of coloured phoenixes</P>
<P>Brought blessings on the world as they called to the sun;</P>
<P>The green phoenixes two by two</P>
<P>Danced in the wind, a rare and wonderful sight.</P>
<P>On the gleaming golden tiles were figures of mandarin ducks;</P>
<P>The brilliantly patterned bricks were set with agate.</P>
<P>To East and West</P>
<P>Were flowers of palaces and pearls of gateways;</P>
<P>To North and South</P>
<P>Were endless precious pavilions and high buildings.</P>
<P>The Devaraja Hall streamed with coloured light;</P>
<P>Purple flames rose before the Lokapalas Chamber.</P>
<P>Stupas stood out,</P>
<P>And fragrant were the blossoms of the udumbara tree.</P>
<P>Truly this was a place so fine it might have come from heaven,</P>
<P>Where the days seemed long under leisurely clouds.</P>
<P>Away from the mortal world, all fates came to an end;</P>
<P>All kalpas were complete within the Dharma hall.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As master and disciples walked freely and at their ease up to the summit of Vulture Peak lay people could be seen under the green pines, and pious men and women amid the jade-coloured cypresses. The venerable elder bowed to them politely, whereupon all the lay men and women, monks and nuns all hastened to put their hands together and say to him, &#8220;Do not bow to us, holy monk. Come back and talk with us when you have seen Sakyamuni.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's a bit early for that,&#8221; replied Monkey with a grin. &#8220;Let's go and worship the boss.&#8221;</P>
<P>The venerable elder waved his arms and performed a ritual dance as he followed Monkey straight to the gates of the Thunder Monastery, where four great vajrapanis greeted them with the words, &#8220;Have you arrived now, holy monk?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Sanzang replied with a bow, &#8220;Your disciple Xuanzang has arrived.&#8221; Having given this reply he was about to go in through the gateway.</P>
<P>&#8220;Please wait for a moment, holy monk,&#8221; the vajrapanis said. &#8220;Let us report before you come in.&#8221; The vajrapanis sent a report of the Tang Priest's arrival to the four great vajrapanis on the middle gates, who in turn reported it to the inner gates, inside which were divine monks making offerings.</P>
<P>As soon as they heard of the Tang Priest's arrival they all hurried to the Mahavira Hall, where they announced to the Tathagata Sakyamuni Buddha, &#8220;The holy monk from the Tang Court has arrived at your noble monastery to fetch the scriptures.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Lord Buddha was very pleased. He called together his Eight Bodhisattvas, Four Vajrapanis, Five Hundred Arhats, Three Thousand Protectors, Eleven Heavenly Shiners and Eighteen Guardians, who drew themselves up in two lines and passed on the Buddha's command summoning the Tang Priest to enter. Thus it was that the invitation was sent down from one level to the next: &#8220;Let the holy monk come in.&#8221; Observing the requirements of ritual, the Tang Priest went in through the gate with Wukong and Wujing, who were leading the horse and carrying the luggage. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In the past he had struggled to fulfil his commission</P>
<P>After leaving the emperor at the steps of the throne.</P>
<P>At dawn he had climbed mountains in mist and in dew;</P>
<P>At dusk he had slept on rocks amid the clouds.</P>
<P>He had carried his stick across three thousand rivers,</P>
<P>And climbed up countless crags with his monastic staff.</P>
<P>His every thought had been set on the true achievement,</P>
<P>And today he was finally to see the Tathagata.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As the four of them arrived in front of the Mahavira Hall they all prostrated themselves and kowtowed to the Tathagata, then to their left and right. After they had each completed three rounds of Worship they then knelt before the Buddha to present their passport. When the Tathagata had read it carefully he handed it back to Sanzang, who bowed his head low and reported, &#8220;Your disciple Xuanzang has made the long journey to your precious monastery at the command of the Great Tang emperor to beg for the true scriptures that will save all living beings. I implore the Lord Buddha in his goodness to grant them at once so that I may return to my country.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Tathagata then opened his compassionate mouth and in the great mercy of his heart said to Sanzang, &#8220;Your Eastern land is in the Southern Continent of Jambu. As the sky is lofty there, the soil deep, its products many, and the people multitudinous there is much covetous-ness, murder, debauchery, lying, deception and dishonesty. They do not follow the Buddhist teaching, do not turn towards good destinies, and do not honour the sun, moon and stars or value the five grains. They are not loyal, filial, righteous or kind. In the delusion of their hearts they mislead themselves, cheating on weights and measures, taking life and killing animals, thus creating such boundless evil karma and such a superabundance of sin and evil that they bring the catastrophe of hell on themselves. That is why they must fall for ever into the dark underworld to suffer the torments of being hammered, smashed, ground and pounded, or are reborn as animals. Many of them take the shape of furry, horned creatures to pay back the debts they owe from earlier lives and feed others with their own flesh. It is for such reasons that some fall into the Avici Hell, from which they never emerge to be reborn. Although Confucius established the doctrine of benevolence, righteousness, correct behavior and wisdom, and although successive emperors have applied the penalties of imprisonment, exile strangulation and beheading, none of this affected those stupid, benighted, self-indulgent and unrestrained people. Why? I have Three Stores of scriptures that offer deliverance from suffering and release from disaster. Of these Three Stores one is the Store of Dharma that deals with Heaven; one is the Store of Sastras that deal with the Earth, and one is the Store of Sutras that can save ghosts. There are thirty-five scriptures altogether, in 15,144 scrolls. These are indeed the path to the truth, the gateway to goodness. They include everything about the astronomy, geography, personalities, birds beasts trees, flowers, objects of use and human affairs of the world's four continents. Now that you have come from afar I would present them all to you to take away with you, but the people of your country are stupid and coarse. They are slanderers of the truth who cannot understand the mysteries of our teachings. Ananda, Kasyapa,&#8221; he called, &#8220;take the four of them to the foot of the jewel tower and give them a vegetarian meal. After the meal open up the pavilion, select a few rolls from each of the thirty-five scriptures in my Three Stores, and tell them to propagate these scriptures in the East, where they may eternally grant their great goodness.&#8221;</P>
<P>Acting on the orders of the Buddha the two arhats then led the four pilgrims to the bottom of the tower, where no end of rare and wonderful jewels and treasures were set out. Here the divinities who made offerings set out a vegetarian banquet, with immortal food, immortal delicacies, immortal tea, immortal fruit, and every kind of culinary delight not to be found in the mortal world. Master and disciples bowed their heads to the ground in thanks for the Buddha's kindness and proceeded to eat to their hearts' content. Indeed</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Precious flames and golden light dazzled the eye,</P>
<P>While the rare incense and delicacies were marvelously fine.</P>
<P>The thousand-storied golden pavilion was infinitely lovely,</P>
<P>And pure sounded immortals' music on the ear.</P>
<P>Meatless food and magic flowers of the sort that are rare on earth,</P>
<P>Fragrant teas and exotic dishes that give eternal life.</P>
<P>After a long period of enduring a thousand kinds of suffering,</P>
<P>Today comes the glorious happiness of the Way completed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This was a piece of good fortune for Pig, and a great, benefit to Friar Sand as they ate their fill of the food in the Buddha's land that gave eternal life and new flesh and bones for old. The two arhats kept the four of them company till the meal was over, after which they went to the treasure pavilion, where the doors were opened for them to go in and look. Over this all was a thousandfold aura of coloured light and auspicious vapors, while brilliant mists and clouds of good omen wafted all around. All over the scripture shelves and on the outside of the cases were pasted red labels on which were neatly written the titles of the scriptures. They were the</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Ananda and Kasyapa led the Tang Priest to read the titles of all the scriptures.</P>
<P>&#8220;You have come here from the East, holy monk,&#8221; they said to him. &#8220;Have you brought us any presents? Hand them over right now, then we can give you the scriptures.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Sanzang heard this he said, &#8220;Your disciple Xuanzang has come a very long way, and I did not bring any with me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's very fine,&#8221; the two arhats said with a laugh. &#8220;If we hand the scriptures over for nothing, they'll be passed down through the ages and our successors will have to starve to death.&#8221; Monkey could not stand hearing them talking tough like this and refusing to hand the scriptures over, so he shouted, &#8220;Let's go and report them to the Tathagata, Master. We'll get him to give me the scriptures himself.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Shut up!&#8221; said Kasyapa. &#8220;Where do you think you are, acting up like this? Come here and take the scriptures.&#8221; Pig and Friar Sand, who were keeping their own tempers under control, calmed Monkey down. They turned back to accept the scriptures, which were packed one by one into the luggage. Some of it was put on the horse's back, and the rest tied up as two carrying-pole loads that Pig and Friar Sand shouldered. They all then returned to the Buddha's throne, kowtowed, thanked the Tathagata and went straight out. They bowed twice to every Buddha and every Bodhisattva they met. When they reached the main entrance they bowed to the bhiksus, the bhiksunis, the laymen and the laywomen, taking their leave of each one. Then they hurried back down the mountain.</P>
<P>The story tells not of them but of the Ancient Buddha Dipamkara, who had been quietly listening in the library when the scriptures were handed over. He understood perfectly well that Ananda and Kasyapa had handed over wordless scriptures. &#8220;Those stupid monks from the East didn't realize that those were wordless scriptures,&#8221; he thought with a smile to himself. &#8220;The holy monks journey across all those mountains and rivers will be a complete waste. Who is in attendance here?&#8221; he called, and the arhat Suklavira stepped forward. &#8220;Use your divine might,&#8221; Dipamkara instructed him, &#8220;and go after the Tang Priest like a shooting star. Take the wordless scriptures from him and tell him to come back to fetch the true scriptures.&#8221; The arhat Suklavira then flew off on a storm wind that roared away from the Thunder Monastery as he gave a great display of his divine might. That splendid wind really was</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A warrior from the Buddha's presence,</P>
<P>Greater than the two wind gods of the Xun quarter.</P>
<P>The angry roars from his divine orifices</P>
<P>Were more powerful by far than the puffs of a young girl.</P>
<P>This wind made</P>
<P>Fish and dragons lose their dens,</P>
<P>While the waves flowed backwards in rivers and seas.</P>
<P>Black apes could not present the fruit they carried;</P>
<P>Yellow cranes turned back to the clouds as they sought their nests.</P>
<P>Ugly rang the song of the red phoenix;</P>
<P>Raucous were the calls of the multicolored pheasants.</P>
<P>The branches of hoary pines were broken</P>
<P>As the flowers of the udumbara blew away.</P>
<P>Every cane of green bamboo bowed low;</P>
<P>All the blooms of golden lotus swayed.</P>
<P>The sound of the bell was carried a thousand miles</P>
<P>While the chanting of sutras flew lightly up the ravines.</P>
<P>Ruined was the beauty of flowers under the crag;</P>
<P>The tender shoots of plants were laid low by the path</P>
<P>The brilliant phoenixes could hardly spread their wings;</P>
<P>White deer hid beneath the cliffs.</P>
<P>The heavens were heavy with fragrance</P>
<P>As the clear wind blew right through the clouds.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Tang Priest was walking along when he smelt the fragrant wind, but he paid no attention to it, taking it for an auspicious sign of the Lord Buddha. Then a noise could be heard as a hand reached down from midair to lift the scriptures lightly off the horse's back, which gave Sanzang such a shock that he beat his chest and howled aloud. Pig scrambled along in pursuit, Friar Sand guarded the carrying-poles loaded with scriptures, and Brother Monkey flew after the arhat. Seeing that Monkey had almost caught up with him, and frightened that the merciless cudgel would make no bones about wounding him badly, the arhat tore the bundle of scriptures to shreds and flung it into the dust. When Monkey saw the bundle falling in pieces that were being scattered by the fragrant wind he stopped chasing the arhat and brought his cloud down to look after the scriptures. The arhat Suklavira put the wind and the clouds away, then went back to report to Dipamkara.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Pig, who was also in pursuit, saw the scriptures falling he helped Monkey to collect them up and carry them back to the Tang Priest. &#8220;Disciples,&#8221; the Tang Priest exclaimed, tears pouring from his eyes, &#8220;even in this world of bliss evil demons cheat people.&#8221; After gathering up the scattered scriptures in his arms Friar Sand opened one of them up and saw that it was as white as snow: not a word was written on it.</P>
<P>Quickly he handed it to Sanzang with the remark, &#8220;There's nothing in this scroll, Master.&#8221; Monkey opened out another scroll to find that it had nothing written in it either. Pig opened another and it too had nothing in it.</P>
<P>&#8220;Open them all for us to examine,&#8221; said Sanzang. Every single scroll was blank paper.</P>
<P>&#8220;We Easterners really do have no luck,&#8221; he said, sighing and groaning. &#8220;What point is there in fetching wordless scriptures like these? How could I ever face the Tang emperor? I will have no way of avoiding execution for the crime of lying to my sovereign.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey, who already understood what had happened, then said to the Tang Priest, &#8220;Say no more, Master. Ananda and Kasyapa gave us these scrolls of blank paper because we hadn't got any presents to give them when they asked for them. Let's go back, report them to the Tathagata and get them accused of extortion.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's right,&#8221; shouted Pig, &#8220;that's right. Let's report them.&#8221; The four of them then hurried up the mountain again, and after a few steps they were rushing back to the Thunder Monastery.</P>
<P>Before long they were once more outside the gates of the monastery, where everyone raised their clasped hands in greeting. &#8220;Have you holy monks come to exchange your scriptures?&#8221; they asked with smiles. Sanzang nodded and expressed his thanks. The vajrapanis did not block them, but let them go straight in to the Mahavira Hall.</P>
<P>&#8220;Tathagata,&#8221; yelled Monkey, &#8220;our master and the rest of us have had to put up with endless monsters, demons, troubles and hardships to get here from the East to worship you. You gave the orders for the scriptures to be handed over, but Ananda and Kasyapa didn't do so because they were trying to extort things from us. They conspired and deliberately let us take away blank paper versions without a single word written on them. But what's the point in taking those? I beg you to have them punished, Tathagata.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop yelling,&#8221; replied the Lord Buddha with a smile. &#8220;I already know that they asked you for presents. But the scriptures cannot be casually passed on. Nor can they be taken away for nothing. In the past bhiksus and holy monks went down the mountain and recited these scriptures to the family of the elder Zhao in the land of Sravasti. This ensured peace and safety for the living and deliverance for the dead members of the family. All that was asked for was three bushels and three pecks of granular gold. I said they had sold the scriptures too cheap, so I saw to it that Zhao's sons and grandsons would be poor. You were given blank texts because you came here to fetch them empty-handed. The blank texts are true, wordless scriptures, and they really are good. But as you living beings in the East are so deluded and have not achieved enlightenment we'll have to give you these ones instead. Ananda, Kasyapa,&#8221; he called, &#8220;fetch the true scriptures with words at once. Choose a few rolls from each title to give them, then come back here and tell me how many.&#8221;</P>
<P>The two arhats then led the four pilgrims to the foot of the library building and once again asked the Tang Priest for a present. Having nothing else to offer, he ordered friar Sand to bring out the begging bowl of purple gold and presented it with both hands. &#8220;Your disciple is poor and has come a very long way,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I did not bring any presents with me. This bowl was given to me by the Tang emperor with his own hands to beg for food with on my journey. I now offer it to you as a token of my heartfelt feelings. I beg you arhats not to despise it but to keep it. When I return to my court I shall report this to the Tang emperor, who will certainly reward you richly. I only ask you to give me the true scriptures that have words to save me from failing in my imperial mission and making this long, hard journey for nothing.&#8221;</P>
<P>Ananda accepted the bowl with no more than a hint of a smile. The warriors guarding the precious library building, the kitchen staff responsible for the spices and the arhats in charge of the library rubbed each other's faces, patted each other's backs, flicked each other with their fingers and pulled faces.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disgraceful,&#8221; they all said with grins, &#8220;disgraceful. Demanding presents from the pilgrims who've come to fetch the scriptures!&#8221; A moment later Ananda was frowning with embarrassment but still holding the bowl and not letting go. Only then did Kasyapa go into the library to check the scriptures through one by one and give them to Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciples,&#8221; called Sanzang, &#8220;take a good look at them, not like last time.&#8221; The three of them took the rolls and examined them one by one. All had words. 5,048 rolls were handed over, the total in a single store. They were neatly packed up and put on the horse, and those left over were made into a carrying-pole load for Pig to take. Friar Sand carried their own luggage, and as Brother Monkey led the horse the Tang Priest took his staff, pushed his Vairocana mitre into position, shook his brocade cassock, and went happily into the presence of the Tathagata. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sweet taste the True Scriptures of the Great Store,</P>
<P>Created fine and majestic by the Tathagata.</P>
<P>Remember what Xuanzang suffered to climb this mountain:</P>
<P>Ananda's greed was something ridiculous.</P>
<P>What they did not notice at first Dipamkara helped them to see;</P>
<P>Later the scriptures were real and they then found peace.</P>
<P>Successful now, they would take the scriptures to the East;</P>
<P>Where all could be refreshed by their life-giving richness.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Ananda and Kasyapa led the Tang Priest to see the Tathagata, who ascended his lotus throne and directed the two great arhats Dragon-queller and Tiger-subduer to strike the cloud-ringing stone chimes that summoned all the Three Thousand Buddhas, Three Thousand Protectors, Eight Vajrapanis, Four Bodhisattvas, Five Hundred Arhats, Eight Hundred Bhiksus, the host of laymen, bhiksunis, laywomen, and the greater and lesser honoured ones and holy monks of every cave, every heaven, the blessed lands and the magic mountains. Those who were supposed to sit were asked to ascend their precious thrones, and those who were supposed to stand stood on either side. All of a sudden heavenly music rang out from afar and magical sounds wafted around. The air was full of countless beams of auspicious light and of aura upon aura as all the Buddhas gathered together to pay their respects to the Tathagata.</P>
<P>&#8220;How many rolls of scripture have you given them, Ananda and Kasyapa?&#8221; the Tathagata asked. &#8220;Please tell me the numbers one by one.&#8221;</P>
<P>The two arhats then reported, &#8220;We are now handing over for the Tang court the</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Nirvana sutra&#8212;400 rolls</P>
<P>Bodhisattva sutra&#8212;360 rolls</P>
<P>Akasagarbha sutra&#8212;20 rolls</P>
<P>Surangama sutra&#8212;30 rolls</P>
<P>Collection of sutras on the meaning of grace&#8212;40 rolls</P>
<P>Determination sutra&#8212;40 rolls</P>
<P>Ratnagarbha sutra&#8212;20 rolls</P>
<P>Avatamsaka sutra&#8212;81 rolls</P>
<P>Sutra on Worshipping Bhutatathata&#8212;30 rolls</P>
<P>Mahaprajnaparamita sutra&#8212;600 rolls</P>
<P>Mahaprabhasa sutra&#8212;50 rolls</P>
<P>Adbhuta-dharma sutras&#8212;550 rolls</P>
<P>Vimalakirti sutra&#8212;30 rolls</P>
<P>The Three Sastras&#8212;42 rolls</P>
<P>Diamond sutra&#8212;1 rolls</P>
<P>Saddharma sastra&#8212;20 rolls</P>
<P>Buddhacaritakavya sutra&#8212;116 rolls</P>
<P>Pancanaga sutra&#8212;20 rolls</P>
<P>Bodhisattva-vinaya sutra&#8212;60 rolls</P>
<P>Mahasamnipata sutras&#8212;30 rolls</P>
<P>Makara sutra&#8212;140 rolls</P>
<P>Saddharma-pundarika sutra&#8212;10 rolls</P>
<P>Yoga sutra&#8212;30 rolls</P>
<P>Precious Eternity sutra&#8212;170 rolls</P>
<P>Sutra on the Western Heaven&#8212;30 rolls</P>
<P>Samghika sutra&#8212;110 rolls</P>
<P>Samyukta-Buddhadesa sutra&#8212;1,638 rolls</P>
<P>Mahayana-sraddhotpadasa sastra&#8212;50 rolls</P>
<P>Great Wisdom sutra&#8212;90 rolls</P>
<P>Ratna-prabhava sutra&#8212;140 rolls</P>
<P>Original Pavilion sutra&#8212;56 rolls</P>
<P>Principal vinaya sutra&#8212;10 rolls</P>
<P>Mahamayuri-vidyarajni sutra&#8212;14 rolls</P>
<P>Vynaptimatra-tasiddhi sastra&#8212;10 rolls</P>
<P>Abhidharma-kosa sastra&#8212;10 rolls</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>From the thirty-five scriptures in all of the stores we have selected 5,048 rolls to give to the holy monk. These will be kept and handed down in Tang. They have now all been packed neatly and put on the horse or made into carrying-pole loads. The pilgrims are only waiting to express their thanks.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang and his three followers then tethered the horse, put down the loads, joined their hands in front of their chests and bowed in worship.</P>
<P>&#8220;The achievement of these scriptures is immeasurable,&#8221; the Tathagata said to the Tang Priest, &#8220;Although they are the source of foreknowledge and reflection for my school they are truly the origin of all Three Schools. If they reach your Southern Continent of Jambudvipa they must not be treated with disrespect when they are shown to all living beings. Nobody who has not bathed, avoided eating meat and observed the prohibitions may open the rolls. Treasure them. Honour them. They include the esoteric mysteries of the way of immortality and wonderful methods for discovering all transformations.&#8221; Kowtowing in thanks, Sanzang faith fully accepted these instructions and determined to carry them out, did three more circuits of homage round the Lord Buddha then with dutiful and sincere obedience accepted the scriptures and went out with them through the third of the monastery gates, where he thanked all the holy beings one by one again. Of him we will say no more.</P>
<P>After sending the Tang Priest on his way the Tathagata dissolved the assembly that had been called to pass on the scriptures. The Bodhisattva Guanyin then stepped forward from the side, put her hands together and submitted to the lord Buddha, &#8220;It has been fourteen years from the time when your disciple went to the East that year to find the man who would fetch the scriptures to his success today. That makes 5,040 days. May the World-honoured One allow the holy monks to go back East from the West within eight days, so as to complete the number of rolls in one store, and then your disciple may report his mission as completed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What you say is quite right,&#8221; replied the Tathagata with delight. &#8220;You are permitted to report the completion of your mission.&#8221; With that he instructed the Eight Vajrapanis, &#8220;You are to use your divine might to escort the holy monks back to the East, where they will hand the true scriptures over to be kept there. After escorting the holy monks back, you may return to the West. This must be done within eight days in order to match the number of rolls in one store. There must be no disobedience or delay.&#8221; The vajrapanis caught up with the Tang Priest. &#8220;Come with us, scripture-fetchers,&#8221; they called; and the Tang Priest and the others became light and strong as they floated up on clouds after the vajrapanis. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Nature revealed and mind made clear, they visited the Buddha;</P>
<P>Actions complete and all achieved, they flew aloft.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you do not know how they passed on the scriptures after returning to the East, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>猿熟马驯方脱壳</p>
<p>功成行满见真如</p>
</div>
<p>话表寇员外既得回生，复整理了幢幡鼓乐，僧道亲友，依旧送行不题。却说唐僧四众，上了大路，果然西方佛地，与他处不同。见了些琪花、瑶草、古柏、苍松，所过地方，家家向善，户户斋僧，每逢山下人修行，又见林间客诵经。师徒们夜宿晓行，又经有六七日，忽见一带高楼，几层杰阁，真个是冲天百尺，耸汉凌空。低头观落日，引手摘飞星。豁达窗轩吞宇宙，嵯峨栋宇接云屏，黄鹤信来秋树老，彩鸾书到晚风清。此乃是灵宫宝阙，琳馆珠庭。真堂谈道，宇宙传经。花向春来美，松临雨过青。</p>

<p>紫芝仙果年年秀，丹凤仪翔万感灵。三藏举鞭遥指道：“悟空，好去处耶！”行者道：“师父，你在那假境界假佛象处，倒强要下拜；今日到了这真境界真佛象处，倒还不下马，是怎的说？”三藏闻言，慌得翻身跳下来，已到了那楼阁门首。只见一个道童，斜立山门之前叫道：“那来的莫非东土取经人么？”长老急整衣，抬头观看，见他身披锦衣，手摇玉塵。身披锦衣，宝阁瑶池常赴宴；手摇玉塵，丹台紫府每挥尘。肘悬仙箓，足踏履鞋。飘然真羽士，秀丽实奇哉。炼就长生居胜境，修成永寿脱尘埃。圣僧不识灵山客，当年金顶大仙来。孙大圣认得他，即叫：“师父，此乃是灵山脚下玉真观金顶大仙，他来接我们哩。”三藏方才醒悟，进前施礼。大仙笑道：“圣僧今年才到，我被观音菩萨哄了。他十年前领佛金旨，向东土寻取经人，原说二三年就到我处。我年年等候，渺无消息，不意今年才相逢也。”三藏合掌道：</p>

<p>“有劳大仙盛意，感激！感激！”遂此四众牵马挑担，同入观里，却又与大仙一一相见。即命看茶摆斋，又叫小童儿烧香汤与圣僧沐浴了，好登佛地。正是那：功满行完宜沐浴，炼驯本性合天真。千辛万苦今方息，九戒三皈始自新。魔尽果然登佛地，灾消故得见沙门。洗尘涤垢全无染，反本还原不坏身。师徒们沐浴了，不觉天色将晚，就于玉真观安歇。</p>

<p>次早，唐僧换了衣服，披上锦襕袈裟，戴了毗卢帽，手持锡杖，登堂拜辞大仙。大仙笑道：“昨日褴缕，今日鲜明，观此相真佛子也。”三藏拜别就行，大仙道；“且住，等我送你。”行者道：“不必你送，老孙认得路。大仙道：“你认得的是云路。圣僧还未登云路，当从本路而行。”行者道：“这个讲得是，老孙虽走了几遭，只是云来云去，实不曾踏着此地。既有本路，还烦你送送，我师父拜佛心重，幸勿迟疑。那大仙笑吟吟，携着唐僧手，接引旃坛上法门。原来这条路不出山门，就自观宇中堂穿出后门便是。大仙指着灵山道：“圣僧，你看那半天中有祥光五色，瑞蔼千重的，就是灵鹫高峰，佛祖之圣境也。”唐僧见了就拜，行者笑道：“师父，还不到拜处哩。常言道望山走倒马，离此镇还有许远，如何就拜！若拜到顶上，得多少头磕是？”大仙道：</p>

<p>“圣僧，你与大圣、天蓬、卷帘四位，已此到于福地，望见灵山，我回去也。”三藏遂拜辞而去。</p>

<p>大圣引着唐僧等，徐徐缓步，登了灵山，不上五六里，见了一道活水，滚浪飞流，约有八九里宽阔，四无人迹。三藏心惊道：“悟空，这路来得差了，敢莫大仙错指了？此水这般宽阔，这般汹涌，又不见舟楫，如何可渡？”行者笑道：“不差！你看那壁厢不是一座大桥？要从那桥上行过去，方成正果哩。”长老等又近前看时，桥边有一扁，扁上有凌云渡三字，原来是一根独木桥。正是：远看横空如玉栋，近观断水一枯槎。维河架海还容易，独木单梁人怎蹅！万丈虹霓平卧影，千寻白练接天涯。十分细滑浑难渡，除是神仙步彩霞。三藏心惊胆战道：“悟空，这桥不是人走的，我们别寻路径去来。”行者笑道：“正是路！正是路！八戒慌了道：“这是路，那个敢走？水面又宽，波浪又涌，独独一根木头，又细又滑，怎生动脚？”行者道：“你都站下，等老孙走个儿你看。”好大圣，拽开步跳上独木桥，摇摇摆摆，须臾跑将过去，在那边招呼道：“过来！过来！”唐僧摇手，八戒沙僧咬指道：“难！难！难！”行者又从那边跑过来，拉着八戒道：“呆子，跟我走，跟我走！”那八戒卧倒在地道：“滑！滑！滑！走不得！你饶我罢！让我驾风雾过去！”行者按住道：“这是甚么去处，许你驾风雾？必须从此桥上走过，方可成佛。”八戒道：“哥啊，佛做不成也罢，实是走不得！”</p>

<p>他两个在那桥边，滚滚爬爬，扯扯拉拉的耍斗。沙僧走去劝解，才撒脱了手。三藏回头，忽见那下溜中有一人撑一只船来，叫道：“上渡！上渡！”长老大喜道：“徒弟，休得乱顽。那里有只渡船儿来了。”他三个跳起来站定，同眼观看，那船儿来得至近，原来是一只无底的船儿。行者火眼金睛，早已认得是接引佛祖，又称为南无宝幢光王佛。行者却不题破，只管叫：“这里来！撑拢来！”霎时撑近岸边，又叫：“上渡！上渡！”三藏见了，又心惊道：“你这无底的破船儿，如何渡人？”佛祖道：“我这船鸿蒙初判有声名，幸我撑来不变更。有浪有风还自稳，无终无始乐升平。六尘不染能归一，万劫安然自在行。无底船儿难过海，今来古往渡群生。”孙大圣合掌称谢道：“承盛意接引吾师。</p>

<p>师父，上船去，他这船儿虽是无底，却稳；纵有风浪，也不得翻。”长老还自惊疑，行者叉着膊子，往上一推。那师父踏不住脚，毂辘的跌在水里，早被撑船人一把扯起，站在船上。师父还抖衣服，垛鞋脚，抱怨行者。行者却引沙僧八戒，牵马挑担，也上了船，都立在舟旱舟唐之上。那佛祖轻轻用力撑开，只见上溜头泱下一个死尸。长老见了大惊，行者笑道：“师父莫怕，那个原来是你。”八戒也道：“是你是你！”沙僧拍着手也道：“是你是你！”那撑船的打着号子也说：“那是你！可贺可贺！”</p>

<p>他们三人，也一齐声相和。撑着船，不一时稳稳当当的过了凌云仙渡。三藏才转身，轻轻的跳上彼岸。有诗为证，诗曰：</p>

<p>脱却胎胞骨肉身，相亲相爱是元神。今朝行满方成佛，洗净当年六六尘。此诚所谓广大智慧，登彼岸无极之法。四众上岸回头，连无底船儿却不知去向，行者方说是接引佛祖。三藏方才省悟，急转身，反谢了三个徒弟，行者道：“两不相谢，彼此皆扶持也。我等亏师父解脱，借门路修功，幸成了正果；师父也赖我等保护，秉教伽持，喜脱了凡胎。师父，你看这面前花草松篁，鸾凤鹤鹿之胜境，比那妖邪显化之处，孰美孰恶？何善何凶？”</p>

<p>三藏称谢不已。一个个身轻体快，步上灵山，早见那雷音古刹：</p>

<p>顶摩霄汉中，根接须弥脉。巧峰排列，怪石参差。悬崖下瑶草琪花，曲径旁紫芝香蕙。仙猿摘果入桃林，却似火烧金；白鹤牺松立枝头，浑如烟捧玉。彩凤双双，青鸾对对。彩凤双双，向日一鸣天下瑞；青鸾对对，迎风耀舞世间稀。又见那黄森森金瓦迭鸳鸯，明幌幌花砖铺玛瑙。东一行，西一行，尽都是蕊宫珠阙；南一带，北一带，看不了宝阁珍楼。天王殿上放霞光，护法堂前喷紫焰。浮屠塔显，优钵花香、正是地胜疑天别，云闲觉昼长。红尘不到诸缘尽，万劫无亏大法堂。师徒们逍逍遥遥，走上灵山之巅，又见青松林下列优婆，翠柏丛中排善士。长老就便施礼，慌得那优婆塞、优婆夷、比丘僧、比丘尼合掌道：“圣僧且休行礼，待见了牟尼，却来相叙。行者笑道：“早哩！早哩！且去拜上位者。”</p>

<p>那长老手舞足蹈，随着行者，直至雷音寺山门之外。那厢有四大金刚迎住道：“圣僧来耶？”三藏躬身道：“是弟子玄奘到了。”答毕就欲进门，金刚道：“圣僧少待，容禀过再进。”那金刚着一个转山门报与二门上四大金刚，说唐僧到了；二门上又传入三门上，说唐僧到了；三山门内原是打供的神僧，闻得唐僧到时，急至大雄殿下，报与如来至尊释迦牟尼文佛说：“唐朝圣僧到于宝山取经来了。”佛爷爷大喜，即召聚八菩萨、四金刚、五百阿罗、三千揭谛、十一大曜、十八伽蓝，两行排列，却传金旨，召唐僧进。那里边，一层一节，钦依佛旨，叫：“圣僧进来。”</p>

<p>这唐僧循规蹈矩，同悟空、悟能、悟净，牵马挑担，径入山门。正是：当年奋志奉钦差，领牒辞王出玉阶。清晓登山迎雾露，黄昏枕石卧云霾。挑禅远步三千水，飞锡长行万里崖。念念在心求正果，今朝始得见如来。</p>

<p>四众到大雄宝殿殿前，对如来倒身下拜。拜罢，又向左右再拜。各各三匝已遍，复向佛祖长跪，将通关文牒奉上，如来一一看了，还递与三藏。三藏俯囱作礼，启上道：“弟子玄奘，奉东土大唐皇帝旨意，遥诣宝山，拜求真经，以济众生。望我佛祖垂恩，早赐回国。”如来方开怜悯之口，大发慈悲之心，对三藏言曰：“你那东土乃南赡部洲，只因天高地厚，物广人稠，多贪多杀，多淫多诳，多欺多诈；不遵佛教，不向善缘，不敬三光，不重五谷；不忠不孝，不义不仁，瞒心昧己，大斗小秤，害命杀牲。造下无边之孽，罪盈恶满，致有地狱之灾，所以永堕幽冥，受那许多碓捣磨舂之苦，变化畜类。有那许多披毛顶角之形，将身还债，将肉饲人。其永堕阿鼻，不得超升者，皆此之故也。虽有孔氏在彼立下仁义礼智之教，帝王相继，治有徒流绞斩之刑，其如愚昧不明，放纵无忌之辈何耶！我今有经三藏，可以超脱苦恼，解释灾愆。三藏：有法一藏，谈天；有论一藏，说地；有经一藏，度鬼。共计三十五部，该一万五千一百四十四卷。真是修真之径，正善之门，凡天下四大部洲之天文、地理、人物、鸟兽、花木、器用、人事，无般不载。汝等远来，待要全付与汝取去，但那方之人，愚蠢村强，毁谤真言，不识我沙门之奥旨。”叫：“阿傩、伽叶，你两个引他四众，到珍楼之下，先将斋食待他。斋罢，开了宝阁，将我那三藏经中三十五部之内，各检几卷与他，教他传流东土，永注洪恩。”二尊者即奉佛旨，将他四众领至楼下，看不尽那奇珍异宝，摆列无穷。只见那设供的诸神，铺排斋宴，并皆是仙品、仙肴、仙茶、仙果，珍馐百味，与凡世不同。师徒们顶礼了佛恩，随心享用，其实是：宝焰金光映目明，异香奇品更微精。千层金阁无穷丽，一派仙音入耳清。素味仙花人罕见，香茶异食得长生。向来受尽千般苦，今日荣华喜道成。</p>

<p>这番造化了八戒，便宜了沙僧，佛祖处正寿长生，脱胎换骨之馔，尽着他受用。二尊者陪奉四众餐毕，却入宝阁，开门登看。那厢有霞光瑞气，笼罩千重；彩雾祥云，遮漫万道。经柜上，宝箧外，都贴了红签，楷书着经卷名目。乃是：《涅槃经》一部，七百四十八卷；《菩萨经》一部，一千二十一卷；《虚空藏经》一部，四百卷；《首楞严经》一部，一百一十卷；《恩意经大集》一部，五十卷；《决定经》一部，一百四十卷；《宝藏经》一部，四十五卷；《华严经》一部，五百卷；《礼真如经》一部，九十卷；《大般若经》一部，九百一十六卷；《大光明经》一部，三百卷；《未曾有经》一部，一千一百一十卷；《维摩经》一部，一百七十卷；《三论别经》一部，二百七十卷；《金刚经》一部，一百卷；《正法论经》一部，一百二十卷；《佛本行经》一部，八百卷；《五龙经》一部，三十二卷；《菩萨戒经》一部，一百一十六卷；《大集经》一部，一百三十卷；《摩竭经》一部，三百五十卷；《法华经》一部，一百卷；《瑜伽经》一部，一百卷；《宝常经》一部，二百二十卷；《西天论经》一部，一百三十卷；《僧祇经》一部，一百五十七卷；《佛国杂经》一部，一千九百五十卷；《起信论经》一部，一千卷；《大智度经》一部，一千八十卷；《宝威经》一部，一千二百八十卷；《本阁经》一部，八百五十卷；《正律文经》一部，二百卷；《大孔雀经》一部，二百二十卷；《维识论经》一部，一百卷；《具舍论经》一部，二百卷。阿傩、伽叶引唐僧看遍经名，对唐僧道：“圣僧东土到此，有些甚么人事送我们？快拿出来，好传经与你去。三藏闻言道：“弟子玄奘，来路迢遥，不曾备得。”二尊者笑道：</p>

<p>“好，好，好！白手传经继世，后人当饿死矣！”行者见他讲口扭捏，不肯传经，他忍不住叫噪道：“师父，我们去告如来，教他自家来把经与老孙也。”阿傩道：“莫嚷！此是甚么去处，你还撒野放刁！到这边来接着经。”八戒沙僧耐住了性子，劝住了行者，转身来接。一卷卷收在包里，驮在马上，又捆了两担，八戒与沙僧挑着，却来宝座前叩头，谢了如来，一直出门。逢一位佛祖，拜两拜；见一尊菩萨，拜两拜。又到大门，拜了比丘僧、尼，优婆夷、塞，一一相辞，下山奔路不题。</p>

<p>却说那宝阁上有一尊燃灯古佛，他在阁上，暗暗的听着那传经之事，心中甚明，原是阿傩、伽叶将无字之经传去，却自笑云：东土众僧愚迷，不识无字之经，却不枉费了圣僧这场跋涉？</p>

<p>问：“座边有谁在此？”只见白雄尊者闪出。古佛吩咐道：“你可作起神威，飞星赶上唐僧，把那无字之经夺了，教他再来求取有字真经。”白雄尊者，即驾狂风，滚离了雷音寺山门之外，大作神威。那阵好风，真个是：佛前勇士，不比巽二风神。仙窍怒号，远赛吹嘘少女。这一阵，鱼龙皆失穴，江海逆波涛。玄猿捧果难来献，黄鹤回云找旧巢。丹凤清音鸣不美，锦鸡喔运叫声嘈。青松枝折，优钵花飘。翠竹竿竿倒，金莲朵朵摇。钟声远送三千里，经韵轻飞万壑高。崖下奇花残美色，路旁瑶草偃鲜苗。彩鸾难舞翅，白鹿躲山崖。荡荡异香漫宇宙，清清风气彻云霄。那唐长老正行间，忽闻香风滚滚，只道是佛祖之祯祥，未曾提防。又闻得响一声，半空中伸下一只手来，将马驮的经，轻轻抢去，唬得个三藏捶胸叫唤，八戒滚地来追，沙和尚护守着经担，孙行者急赶去如飞。那白雄尊者，见行者赶得将近，恐他棍头上没眼，一时间不分好歹，打伤身体，即将经包捽碎，抛落尘埃。行者见经包破落，又被香风吹得飘零，却就按下云头，顾经不去追赶。那白雄尊者收风敛雾，回报古佛不题。</p>

<p>八戒去追赶，见经本落下，遂与行者收拾背着，来见唐僧。</p>

<p>唐僧满眼垂泪道：“徒弟呀！这个极乐世界，也还有凶魔欺害哩！”沙僧接了抱着的散经，打开看时，原来雪白，并无半点字迹，慌忙递与三藏道：“师父，这一卷没字。”行者又打开一卷看时，也无字。八戒打开一卷，也无字。三藏叫：“通打开来看看。”</p>

<p>卷卷俱是白纸。长老短叹长吁的道：“我东土人果是没福！似这般无字的空本，取去何用？怎么敢见唐王！诳君之罪，诚不容诛也！”行者早已知之，对唐僧道：“师父，不消说了，这就是阿傩、伽叶那厮，问我要人事没有，故将此白纸本子与我们来了。快回去告在如来之前，问他掯财作弊之罪。”八戒嚷道：“正是！正是！告他去来！”四众急急回山，无好步，忙忙又转上雷音。不多时，到于山门之外，众皆拱手相迎，笑道：“圣僧是换经来的？”三藏点头称谢。众金刚也不阻挡，让他进去，直至大雄殿前。行者嚷道：“如来！我师徒们受了万蜇千魔，千辛万苦，自东土拜到此处，蒙如来吩咐传经，被阿傩、伽叶掯财不遂，通同作弊，故意将无字的白纸本儿教我们拿去，我们拿他去何用！望如来敕治！”佛祖笑道：“你且休嚷，他两个问你要人事之情，我已知矣。但只是经不可轻传，亦不可以空取，向时众比丘圣僧下山，曾将此经在舍卫国赵长者家与他诵了一遍，保他家生者安全，亡者超脱，只讨得他三斗三升米粒黄金回来，我还说他们忒卖贱了，教后代儿孙没钱使用。你如今空手来取，是以传了白本。白本者，乃无字真经，倒也是好的。因你那东土众生，愚迷不悟，只可以此传之耳。”即叫：“阿傩、伽叶，快将有字的真经，每部中各检几卷与他，来此报数。”</p>

<p>二尊者复领四众，到珍楼宝阁之下，仍问唐僧要些人事。</p>

<p>三藏无物奉承，即命沙僧取出紫金钵盂，双手奉上道：“弟子委是穷寒路遥，不曾备得人事。这钵盂乃唐王亲手所赐，教弟子持此，沿路化斋。今特奉上，聊表寸心，万望尊者不鄙轻亵，将此收下，待回朝奏上唐王，定有厚谢。只是以有字真经赐下，庶不孤钦差之意，远涉之劳也。”那阿傩接了，但微微而笑。被那些管珍楼的力士，管香积的庖丁，看阁的尊者，你抹他脸，我扑他背，弹指的，扭唇的，一个个笑道：“不羞！不羞！需索取经的人事！”须臾把脸皮都羞皱了，只是拿着钵盂不放。伽叶却才进阁检经，一一查与三藏，三藏却叫：“徒弟们，你们都好生看看，莫似前番。”他三人接一卷，看一卷，却都是有字的。传了五千零四十八卷，乃一藏之数，收拾齐整驮在马上，剩下的还装了一担，八戒挑着。自己行囊，沙僧挑着。行者牵了马，唐僧拿了锡杖，按一按毗卢帽，抖一抖锦袈裟，才喜喜欢欢，到我佛如来之前、正是那：大藏真经滋味甜，如来造就甚精严。须知玄奘登山苦，可笑阿傩却爱钱。先次未详亏古佛，后来真实始安然。至今得意传东土，大众均将雨露沾。</p>

<p>阿傩、伽叶引唐僧来见如来，如来高升莲座，指令降龙、伏虎二大罗汉敲响云磬，遍请三千诸佛、三千揭谛、八金刚、四菩萨、五百尊罗汉、八百比丘僧、大众优婆塞、比丘尼、优婆夷，各天各洞，福地灵山，大小尊者圣僧，该坐的请登宝座，该立的侍立两旁。一时间，天乐遥闻，仙音嘹喨，满空中祥光迭迭，瑞气重重，诸佛毕集，参见了如来。如来问：“阿傩、伽叶，传了多少经卷与他？可一一报数。”二尊者即开报：“现付去唐朝《涅槃经》四百卷，《菩萨经》三百六十卷，《虚空藏经》二十卷，《首楞严经》三十卷，《恩意经大集》四十卷，《决定经》四十卷，《宝藏经》二十卷，《华严经》八十一卷，《礼真如经》三十卷，《大般若经》六百卷，《金光明品经》五十卷，《未曾有经》五百五十卷，《维摩经》三十卷，《三论别经》四十二卷，《金刚经》一卷，《正法论经》二十卷，《佛本行经》一百一十六卷，《五龙经》二十卷，《菩萨戒经》六十卷，《大集经》三十卷，《摩竭经》一百四十卷，《法华经》十卷，《瑜伽经》三十卷，《宝常经》一百七十卷，《西天论经》三十卷，《僧祇经》一百一十卷，《佛国杂经》一千六百三十八卷，《起信论经》五十卷，《大智度经》九十卷；《宝威经》一百四十卷，《本阁经》五十六卷，《正律文经》十卷，《大孔雀经》十四卷，《维识论经》十卷，《具舍论经》十卷。在藏总经，共三十五部，各部中检出五千零四十八卷，与东土圣僧传留在唐。现俱收拾整顿于人马驮担之上，专等谢恩。”</p>

<p>三藏四众拴了马，歇了担，一个个合掌躬身，朝上礼拜。如来对唐僧言曰：“此经功德，不可称量，虽为我门之龟鉴，实乃三教之源流。若到你那南赡部洲，示与一切众生，不可轻慢，非沐浴斋戒，不可开卷，宝之重之！盖此内有成仙了道之奥妙，有发明万化之奇方也。”三藏叩头谢恩，信受奉行，依然对佛祖遍礼三匝，承谨归诚，领经而去。去到三山门，一一又谢了众圣不题。</p>

<p>如来因打发唐僧去后，才散了传经之会。旁又闪上观世音菩萨合掌启佛祖道：“弟子当年领金旨向东土寻取经之人，今已成功，共计得一十四年，乃五千零四十日，还少八日，不合藏数。望我世尊，早赐圣僧回东转西，须在八日之内，庶完藏数，准弟子缴还金旨。”如来大喜道：“所言甚当，准缴金旨。”即叫八大金刚吩咐道：“汝等快使神威，驾送圣僧回东，把真经传留，即引圣僧西回、须在八日之内，以完一藏之数，勿得迟违。”</p>

<p>金刚随即赶上唐僧，叫道：“取经的，跟我来！”唐僧等俱身轻体健，荡荡飘飘，随着金刚，驾云而起。这才是：见性明心参佛祖，功完行满即飞升。毕竟不知回东土怎生传授，且听下回分解。</p>
