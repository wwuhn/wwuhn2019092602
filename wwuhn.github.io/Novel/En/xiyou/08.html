<div class="poet">
<P>If you try to ask about the dhyana</P>
<P>Or investigate the innumerable</P>
<P>You will waste your life and achieve nothing.</P>
<P>Polishing bricks to make mirrors,</P>
<P>Or piling up snow to turn it into grain&#8212;</P>
<P>However many years have you wasted like that?</P><br />

<P>A hair can contain an ocean,</P>
<P>A mustard-seed can hold a mountain,</P>
<P>And the golden Kasyapa only smiles.</P>
<P>When you are awakened you will surpass the Ten Stages and the Three Vehicles,</P>
<P>And stop the four kinds of birth and the six types of reincarnation.</P><br />

<P>Who has ever heard, before the cliff of thoughts extinguished,</P>
<P>Under the tree that has no shadow,</P>
<P>The sound of the cuckoo in a spring dawn?</P>
<P>The path by the Cao Stream is dangerous,</P>
<P>The Vulture Peak is high in the clouds:</P>
<P>Here the voice of the ancients was a mystery.</P><br />

<P>On a cliff ten thousand feet high</P>
<P>Five-leaved lotuses bloom</P>
<P>As scent coils round the shutters of the old palace.</P>
<P>At that time</P>
<P>Your knowledge smashes all the currents of thought;</P>
<P>The Dragon King and the Three Treasures can be seen.</P>

<P>This lyric poem is set to the tune<I> Su Wu Man.</I> Our story goes on to how our Buddha, the Tathagata, left the Jade Emperor and went back to the Thunder Monastery, where he saw the three thousand Buddhas, five hundred Arhats, eight great Vajrapanis and countless Bodhisattvas standing under the pairs of sala trees at the foot of the Vulture Peak, all holding banners, canopies, jewels and magical flowers. The Tathagata brought his propitious cloud to a halt and addressed them thus:</p>

<P>When he had spoken a sacred light filled the sky with forty-two rainbows that linked North and South together. All who saw them bowed, and a moment later the Buddha gathered together some felicitous cloud and climbed to the supreme Lotus Throne, where he seated himself in majesty.</P>
<P>Then the three thousand Buddhas, the five hundred Arhats, the eight Vajrapanis and the four Bodhisattvas came forward to bow to him with their hands together and ask, &#8220;Who was it who wrecked the Heavenly Palace and ruined the Peach Banquet?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The wretch was a monkey fiend born on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit,&#8221; the Buddha replied, &#8220;whose towering crimes would beggar description. None of the heavenly generals were able to subdue him, and when Lord Lao Zi refined him with fire after Erlang had captured him, he was unharmed. When I went there he was in the middle of the thunder generals, giving a great display of his martial prowess and his spirit. I stopped the fighting and asked him what it was all about. He said that he had divine powers, was able to do transformations, and could ride a somersault cloud for thirty-six thousand miles at a single jump. I made a wager with him that he could not jump out of my hand, then grabbed him, turned my fingers into the Five Elements Mountain, and sealed him under it. The Jade Emperor opened wide the golden gates of the Jade Palace, and invited me to be the guest of honour at a Banquet to Celebrate Peace in Heaven he gave to thank me. After that I took my leave of him and came back here.&#8221; They were all delighted by the news and they congratulated him effusively, after which they withdrew group by group, each to go about his duties as all rejoiced in the divine truth. Indeed:</p>

<P>One day, as the Buddha dwelt in the Thunder Monastery on the Vulture Peak, he called together all the other Buddhas, Arhats, guardian deities, Bodhisattvas, Vajrapanis, monks and nuns and said, &#8220;As we are beyond time, I don't know how long it has been since the crafty ape was subdued and Heaven pacified, but by earthly reckoning it must be about five hundred years. As today is a fine early autumn day and I have a precious bowl filled with a hundred kinds of rare flowers and a thousand varieties of exotic fruit, what would you say to our having an Ullambana Feast?&#8221; They all put their hands together and performed the reverence of going round him three times in acceptance. The Buddha then ordered Ananda to hold the bowl of flowers and fruit while Kasyapa laid them out. The hosts were moved to gratitude, which they expressed in verse.</P>

<P>When the Buddha had finished his sermon he said to the host, &#8220;I have observed that the morality of the living creatures of the four continents varies. In the Eastern Continent of Superior Body they worship Heaven and Earth, their minds are livery and they are even-tempered. In the Northern Kuru Continent they are given to killing living things, but they only do it to feed themselves; they are stupid and lazy by nature, but they do not trample much on others. Our Western Continent of Cattle-gift has people who neither covet nor kill. They nourish the vital essence and submerge the spirit; and although they produce no saints of the highest order, they all live to a ripe old age. But in the Southern Jambu Continent they are greedy and lecherous and delight in the sufferings of others; they go in for a great deal of killing and quarrelling. That continent can with truth be called a vicious field of tongues and mouths, an evil sea of disputation. I now have Three Stores of True Scriptures with which they can be persuaded to be good.&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing this, all the Bodhisattvas put their hands together in submission, then went forward to ask, &#8220;What Three Stores of True Scriptures does the Tathagata have?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have one store of the Vinaya, the law, which is about Heaven; one of Sastras, expositions which are concerned with Earth; and one of Sutras, or scriptures, which save ghosts. The Three Stores consist of fifteen thousand one hundred and forty-four scrolls in thirty-five classes. They are the scriptures for cultivating the truth, and the gate to real goodness. I want to send them to the Eastern lands because it is intolerable that the beings of that quarter should all be such stupid wretches who slander and defame the true word, do not understand the gist of my Law, and have lapsed from the orthodox Yogacara Sect. How am I to find one with the magic powers to go to the East, choose a worthy believer and bid him make the arduous crossing of a thousand mountain and ten thousand rivers in search of the scriptures until he finally comes to this abode of mine to receive them? When he does come they will be sent to the East for ever to convert all living beings, which will be a blessing as big as a mountain, a cause for congratulation as deep as the sea. Is anyone willing to go and find him?&#8221;</P>
<P>The Bodhisattva Guanyin went up to the lotus throne, and after going round the Buddha three times by way of salutation she said, &#8220;Your untalented disciple wishes to go to the East to find a man to come and fetch the scriptures.&#8221; All present raised their heads to look at the Bodhisattva:</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>如来讲罢，对众言曰：“我观四大部洲，众生善恶，各方不一。东胜神洲者，敬天礼地，心爽气平；北巨芦洲者，虽好杀生，只因糊口，性拙情疏，无多作践；我西牛贺洲者，不贪不杀，养气潜灵，虽无上真，人人固寿；但那南赡部洲者，贪淫乐祸，多杀多争，正所谓口舌凶场，是非恶海。我今有三藏真经，可以劝人为善。”诸菩萨闻言，合掌皈依，向佛前问曰：“如来有那三藏真经？”如来曰：“我有《法》一藏，谈天；《论》一藏，说地；经一藏，度鬼。三藏共计三十五部，该一万五千一百四十四卷，乃是修真之经，正善之门。我待要送上东土，叵耐那方众生愚蠢，毁谤真言，不识我法门之旨要，怠慢了瑜迦之正宗。怎么得一个有法力的，去东土寻一个善信，教他苦历千山，远经万水，到我处求取真经，永传东土，劝化众生，却乃是个山大的福缘，海深的善庆。谁肯去走一遭来？”当有观音菩萨，行近莲台，礼佛三匝道：“弟子不才，愿上东土寻一个取经人来也。”诸众抬头观看，那菩萨——</p>

<P>The Buddha was very pleased to see her.</P>
<P>&#8220;No one but the venerable Guanyin, whose divine powers are so great, will do for this mission,&#8221; he said.</P>
<P>&#8220;What instructions have you for your disciple as she goes to the East?&#8221; Guanyin asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;You must watch the route all the way,&#8221; said the Buddha. &#8220;You may not go via the Milky Way, but if necessary you may have a little cloud or mist. As you cross mountains and rivers you must note the distances carefully to enable you to give full instructions to the man who will come to fetch the scriptures. But that true believer will, I'm afraid, have a difficult journey, so I shall give you five treasures for him.&#8221; The Buddha ordered Ananda and Kasyapa to bring out a brocade cassock and a nine-ringed monk's staff.</P>
<P>&#8220;Give this cassock and staff to him who will come to fetch the scriptures: they are for him to use. If he is determined to come here, he can avoid the Wheel of Reincarnation by wearing this cassock, and he will be free from evil if he carries this staff.&#8221; The Bodhisattva bowed and took them. The Buddha then produced three bands.</P>
<P>&#8220;These precious things are called 'tight bands,'&#8220; he told the Bodhisattva as he handed them to her. &#8220;Although all three of them look the same, they have different uses. I also have three Band-Tightening Spells. If you meet any devils with great magic powers on your journey you should persuade them to reform and become the disciples of the pilgrim who will come to fetch the scriptures. If they do not do is they are told these bands should be put on their heads, where they will of themselves take root in the flesh. If the appropriate spell for each one is recited the victim's eyes will bulge, his head will ache, and his forehead will split open. He will thus be certainly induced to adopt our religion.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>如来见了，心中大喜道：“别个是也去不得，须是观音尊者，神通广大，方可去得。”菩萨道：“弟子此去东土，有甚言语吩咐？”如来道：“这一去，要踏看路道，不许在霄汉中行，须是要半云半雾：目过山水，谨记程途远近之数，叮咛那取经人。但恐善信难行，我与你五件宝贝。”即命阿傩、迦叶，取出锦蝠袈裟一领，九环锡杖一根，对菩萨言曰：“这袈裟、锡杖，可与那取经人亲用。若肯坚心来此，穿我的袈裟，免堕轮回；持我的锡杖，不遭毒害。”这菩萨皈依拜领。如来又取出三个箍儿，递与菩萨道：“此宝唤做紧箍儿。虽是一样三个，但只是用各不同，我有金紧禁的咒语三篇。假若路上撞见神通广大的妖魔，你须是劝他学好，跟那取经人做个徒弟。他若不伏使唤，可将此箍儿与他戴在头上，自然见肉生根。各依所用的咒语念一念，眼胀头痛，脑门皆裂，管教他入我门来。”</p>

<P>When he finished speaking the Bodhisattva bowed eagerly and withdrew. She told Huian the Novice to accompany her, and he took his iron staff weighing a thousand pounds with him so that he could as a demon-quelling strongman for the Bodhisattva. The Bodhisattva wrapped the cassock up in a bundle and gave it to him to carry. She then put the golden bands away safely and went down the Vulture Peak with the staff in her hand. This journey was to have consequences:</p>

<P>When the Bodhisattva reached the foot of the mountain the Gold-headed Immortal of the Jade Truth Temple stopped her at the temple gate and invited her to take some tea. But she dared not stop for long, and so she said, &#8220;I have been given a sacred command by the Tathagata to go to the East and find a man who will come to fetch the scriptures.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When will he arrive?&#8221; the Immortal asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;It is not definite,&#8221; the Bodhisattva replied, &#8220;but he will probably reach here in two or three years' time.&#8221; She took her leave of the Immortal and as she traveled amid cloud and mist she estimated the distances. There are some verses to prove it:</p>

<P>When the pair of them had fought several dozen rounds inconclusively the ogre blocked his opponent's iron staff and asked, &#8220;Where are you from, monk, that you dare to take me on?&#8221;</P>

How dare you stand in our way?&#8221; The ogre then realized who he was.</p>
<P>&#8220;I remember,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you used to cultivate your conduct with Guanyin of the Southern Sea in the Purple Bamboo Grove. Why have you come here?&#8221;</P>

<P>When the ogre heard this he chanted &#8220;na-a-aw&#8221; several times to show his respect, withdrew his pole and let Moksa seize it. Then he bowed to Guanyin and said, &#8220;Forgive me, Bodhisattva, and listen to what I have to tell you. I am not a demon, but the Curtain Raising General who used to stand in attendance by the imperial chariot in the Hall of Miraculous Mist. Just because I accidentally smashed a crystal dish at a Peach Banquet the Jade Emperor had me given eight hundred strokes of the rod, exiled me to the lower world, and made me look like this. And on top of it all every seven days he sends a flying sword here to stab my chest over a hundred times before it goes back again. It's agony. I get so unbearably cold and hungry that I have to emerge from the waves every two or three days to devour a traveler. I never thought that in my ignorance I would insult the merciful Bodhisattva today.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You were exiled here for a crime against Heaven, but now you are deepening your guilt by harming living beings. I am now going to the East on the Buddha's orders to find the man who will fetch the scriptures. Why don't you become one of us and ensure yourself good retribution in future by accompanying the pilgrim as a disciple and ascending to the Western Heaven to pay homage to the Buddha and seek the scriptures? I will see to it that the flying sword stops coming to pierce you, and when you are successful you will be forgiven your crimes and your old job will be given back to you. What do you think of that?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am willing to return to the truth,&#8221; the ogre replied, then went closer as he continued, &#8220;Bodhisattva, I have lost count of the number of people I have eaten here, and I have even devoured some pilgrims who were trying to fetch scriptures. I throw the heads of all my victims into the river, and they all sink to the bottom as not even goose-down will float on this water. But the skeletons of those nine pilgrims floated and would not sink. I was so impressed by this that I threaded them together with rope and play with them in my spare time. But I am afraid that the man who is to fetch the scriptures may not get this far, which would wreck my future.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Of course he'll get here,&#8221; the Bodhisattva replied. &#8220;You should hang those skeletons from your head and wait for him. They will come in useful.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; the ogre said, &#8220;I shall await your instructions.&#8221; The Bodhisattva then laid her hands on his head and administered the monastic rules to him, chose for him the surname Sha (&#8220;Sand&quot;) and gave him the Buddhist name of Wujing (&#8220;Awakened to Purity&quot;). Then he entered monkish life and took the Bodhisattva across the river. He washed his heart, cleansed his thoughts, and stopped killing living creatures. All he did now was to wait for the pilgrim who would come to fetch the scriptures.</p>

<p>怪物闻言，连声喏喏，收了宝杖，让木叉揪了去，见观音纳头下拜，告道：“菩萨，恕我之罪，待我诉告。我不是妖邪，我是灵霄殿下侍銮舆的卷帘大将。只因在蟠桃会上，失手打碎了玻璃盏，玉帝把我打了八百，贬下界来，变得这般模样。又教七日一次，将飞剑来穿我胸胁百余下方回，故此这般苦恼。没奈何，饥寒难忍，三二日间，出波涛寻一个行人食用。不期今日无知，冲撞了大慈菩萨。”菩萨道：“你在天有罪，既贬下来，今又这等伤生，正所谓罪上加罪。我今领了佛旨，上东土寻取经人。你何不入我门来，皈依善果，跟那取经人做个徒弟，上西天拜佛求经？我教飞剑不来穿你。那时节功成免罪，复你本职，心下如何？”那怪道：“我愿皈正果。”又向前道：“菩萨，我在此间吃人无数，向来有几次取经人来，都被我吃了。凡吃的人头，抛落流沙，竟沉水底。这个水，鹅毛也不能浮。惟有九个取经人的骷髅，浮在水面，再不能沉。我以为异物，将索儿穿在一处，闲时拿来顽耍。这去，但恐取经人不得到此，却不是反误了我的前程也？”菩萨曰：“岂有不到之理？你可将骷髅儿挂在头项下，等候取经人，自有用处。”怪物道：“既然如此，愿领教诲。”菩萨方与他摩顶受戒，指沙为姓，就姓了沙，起个法名，叫做个沙悟净。当时入了沙门，送菩萨过了河，他洗心涤虑，再不伤生，专等取经人。</p>

<P>&#8220;I'll get you, you stinking, flesh-eyed mortal,&#8221; replied Moksa. &#8220;I am a disciple of the Bodhisattva of the Southern Sea, and this lotus was thrown down by her. Don't you know that?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;By the Bodhisattva of the Southern Sea do you mean Guanyin Who Eliminates the Three Calamities and Saves from the Eight Disasters?&#8221; the monster asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Who else could I mean?&#8221; retorted Moksa. The monster threw down his rake, bowed to him, and asked, &#8220;Where is the Bodhisattva, elder brother? May I trouble you to introduce me?&#8221; Moksa looked up and pointed.</P>
<P>&#8220;There she is,&#8221; he said.

How dare you block my way?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm neither a wild boar nor a pig,&#8221; the monster replied. &#8220;I used to be Marshal Tian Peng in the Milky Way. Because I took some wine to seduce the moon maiden, the Jade Emperor sentenced me to two thousand hammer blows and exile in the mortal world. My spirit had to find a womb to occupy, but I lost my way and entered the womb of a sow. That's why I look like this. I ate up my sow mother, drove all the other pigs away, and seized this mountain, where I keep myself by eating people. I never meant to offend you, Bodhisattva. Save me, save me, I beg you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What is this mountain called?&#8221; the Bodhisattva asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's called the Mount of Blessing, and the cave in it is called the Cloud Pathway Cave. Second Sister Luan, who used to live there, saw that I knew how to fight and asked me to be the head of her household as her husband, but she died within a year and all her property became mine. As the days lengthened into years I found that I had no way of supporting myself, so I had to eat people to keep myself going as I had done before. Forgive me my sins, I beg of you, Bodhisattva.&#8221;</p>

<P>&#8220;There is an old saying,&#8221; the Bodhisattva replied, &#8220;that goes, 'If you want to have a future, don't do anything with no future in it?' You broke the law in the upper world, and since then your vicious nature has not been reformed. You have further sinned by taking life, so this surely means that you will be doubly punished.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Future!&#8221; said the monster angrily. &#8220;According to you I should have lived on air! As the saying goes, 'By the government's law you're beaten to death, and by the Buddha's law you starve to death.' Clear off! Clear off! If you don't I'll capture this pilgrim and eat this plump and tender old woman. I don't give a hoot if it's double sinning, triple sinning, or sinning a thousand or ten thousand times over.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;'If a man wishes to be good, Heaven will certainly allow him to be,'&#8220; said the Bodhisattva. &#8220;If you are prepared to submit to the truth, there are of course, ways to feed yourself. There are the five kinds of food-grains, and they are sufficient to assuage hunger, so why eat people to keep alive?&#8221;</P>
<P>When the monster heard these words it was as if he awoke from a dream, and he said to the Bodhisattva, &#8220;I would love to reform, but isn't it true that 'a sinner against Heaven has nowhere to pray to?'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm going to the East on the orders of the Buddha to find the man who will fetch the scriptures,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;You can be a disciple of his and make this journey to the Western Heaven; thus you will gain merit and atone for your crimes, and I will see to it that you are freed from disaster.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll go with him, I'll go with him,&#8221; the monster said over and over again. The Bodhisattva then laid her hands on his head and he accepted the monastic rules. She gave him the surname Zhu (&#8220;Pig&quot;) because of his appearance, and gave him the Buddhist name Zhu Wuneng (&#8220;Pig Awakened to Power&quot;). She ordered him to adhere to the truth and eat only vegetarian food, cutting out the five pungent vegetables as well as the three forbidden things; wild goose, dog and fish. He was now to wait single-mindedly for the pilgrim who would come to fetch the scriptures.</p>

<p>菩萨道：“古人云，若要有前程，莫做没前程。你既上界违法，今又不改凶心，伤生造孽，却不是二罪俱罚？”那怪道：“前程前程，若依你，教我嗑风！常言道，依着官法打杀，依着佛法饿杀。去也，去也！还不如捉个行人，肥腻腻的吃他家娘！管什么二罪三罪，千罪万罪！”菩萨道：“人有善愿，天必从之。汝若肯归依正果，自有养身之处。世有五谷，尽能济饥，为何吃人度日？”怪物闻言，似梦方觉，向菩萨施礼道：“我欲从正，奈何获罪于天，无所祷也！”菩萨道：“我领了佛旨，上东土寻取经人。你可跟他做个徒弟，往西天走一遭来，将功折罪，管教你脱离灾瘴。”那怪满口道：“愿随，愿随！”菩萨才与他摩顶受戒，指身为姓，就姓了猪，替他起了法名，就叫做猪悟能。遂此领命归真，持斋把素，断绝了五荤三厌，专候那取经人。</p>

<P>&#8220;Which dragon are you?&#8221; the Bodhisattva asked as she went up to him. &#8220;And why are you undergoing punishment here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am the son of Ao Run, the Dragon King of the Western Sea. Because I burnt up the bright pearls in the palace, my father reported me to the court of Heaven as a rebel. The Jade Emperor had me hung up in mid-air and given three hundred strokes, and I am to be executed any day now. I beg you to save me, Bodhisattva.&#8221;</P>
<P>When she heard his plea the Bodhisattva went in through the Southern Gates of Heaven with Moksa. Here they were met by the Heavenly Teachers Qiu and Zhang, who asked them, &#8220;Where are you going?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I would like an audience with the Jade Emperor.&#8221; The two Heavenly Teachers hurried in to announce her, and the Jade Emperor came out of his palace to receive her. The Bodhisattva went forward to greet him and said, &#8220;On my way to the East on the orders of the Buddha to find the man to fetch the scriptures, I met a wicked dragon suspended in mid-air.. I have come here especially to ask you to spare his life and give him to me so that I can teach him to serve the pilgrim with his legs.&#8221; On hearing this the Jade Emperor issued a decree pardoning him, and he sent a heavenly general to release him and give him to the Bodhisattva. The Bodhisattva thanked him for his generosity and left. The young dragon kowtowed to show how grateful he was for having his life spared, and he obediently did what the Bodhisattva told him to. She took him to a deep ravine, where he was to wait until the pilgrim came. When that happened he was to turn into a white horse and achieve merit by going to the Western Heaven. On receiving his orders the young dragon hid himself.</p>

<p>菩萨却与木叉，辞了悟能，半兴云雾前来。正走处，只见空中有一条玉龙叫唤，菩萨近前问曰：“你是何龙，在此受罪？”那龙道：“我是西海龙王敖闰之子，因纵火烧了殿上明珠，我父王表奏天庭，告了忤逆。玉帝把我吊在空中，打了三百，不日遭诛。望菩萨搭救搭救。”观音闻言，即与木叉撞上南天门里，早有邱、张二天师接着，问道：“何往？”菩萨道：“贫僧要见玉帝一面。”二天师即忙上奏，玉帝遂下殿迎接。菩萨上前礼毕道：“贫僧领佛旨上东土寻取经人，路遇孽龙悬吊，特来启奏，饶他性命，赐与贫僧，教他与取经人做个脚力。”玉帝闻言，即传旨赦宥，差天将解放，送与菩萨，菩萨谢恩而出。这小龙叩头谢活命之恩，听从菩萨使唤。菩萨把他送在深涧之中，只等取经人来，变做白马，上西方立功。小龙领命潜身不题。</p>

<P>The Bodhisattva led Moksa the Novice across this mountain, and they hurried on towards the East. Before they had gone much further they suddenly saw ten thousand beams of golden light and a thousand wisps of propitious vapour.</P>
<P>&#8220;Teacher,&#8221; said Moksa, &#8220;the place where all the light is coming from is the Five Elements Mountain, where the Tathagata's restriction order is posted.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This must be cause that Great Sage Equaling Heaven who wrecked the Peach Banquet and threw the Heavenly Palace into chaos is imprisoned there.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's right,&#8221; Moksa replied, and teacher and pupil climbed the mountain together to look at the paper. On it were written the true words<I> Om mani padme bum,</I> and when the Bodhisattva saw them she sighed deeply and composed a poem that went:</p>

<P>The conversation between teacher and disciple had disturbed the Great Sage, who shouted from under the roots of the mountain, &#8220;Who's that up there?&#8221; When she heard this the Bodhisattva hurried down the mountain to visit him. At the foot of the mountainside the local gods, the mountain gods and the heavenly generals who were guarding the Great Sage all bowed to the Bodhisattva in greeting and took her to the Great Sage. She saw that he was pressed down inside a stone box, so that he could speak but could not move his body.</P>
<P>&#8220;Monkey,&#8221; the Bodhisattva said, &#8220;do you know who I am?&#8221; The Great Sage opened wide his fiery eyes with their golden pupils, nodded his head and shouted at the top of his voice, &#8220;Of course I recognize you. You, thank goodness, are the All-Compassionate. All-Merciful Deliverer from Suffering, the Bodhisattva Guanyin from Potaraka Island in the Southern Sea. You're a very welcome visitor. Every day here seems like a year, and nobody I know has ever come to see me. Where have you come from?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have received a mandate from the Buddha to go to the East and find the man who will fetch the scriptures,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;and as I was passing this way I decided to come over and see you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The Buddha fooled me and crushed me under this mountain&#8212;I haven't been able to stretch myself for five hundred years. I desperately hope that you will be obliging enough to rescue me, Bodhisattva.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You wretch,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;you have such an appalling criminal record that I'm afraid you'd only make more trouble if I got you out.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have already repented,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and hope that you will show me the road I should follow. I want to cultivate my conduct.&#8221; Indeed:</p>

<p>师徒们正说话处，早惊动了那大圣。大圣在山根下高叫道：“是那个在山上吟诗，揭我的短哩？”菩萨闻言，径下山来寻看，只见那石崖之下，有土地、山神、监押大圣的天将，都来拜接了菩萨，引至那大圣面前。看时，他原来压于石匣之中，口能言，身不能动。菩萨道：“姓孙的，你认得我么？”大圣睁开火眼金睛，点着头儿高叫道：“我怎么不认得你，你好的是那南海普陀落伽山救苦救难大慈大悲南无观世音菩萨。承看顾，承看顾！我在此度日如年，更无一个相知的来看我一看。你从那里来也？”菩萨道：“我奉佛旨，上东土寻取经人去，从此经过，特留残步看你。”大圣道：“如来哄了我，把我压在此山，五百余年了，不能展挣。万望菩萨方便一二，救我老孙一救！”菩萨道：“你这厮罪业弥深，救你出来，恐你又生祸害，反为不美。”大圣道：“我已知悔了，但愿大慈悲指条门路，情愿修行。”这才是——</p>

<P>The Bodhisattva was delighted to hear what he had to say.</P>
<P>&#8220;The sacred scriptures say,&#8221; she replied, '&#8220;If one's words are good, they will meet with a response from even a thousand miles away; if they are bad, they will be opposed from the same distance.' If this is your state of mind, then wait while I go to the East to find the man who will fetch the scriptures; I'll tell him to rescue you. You can be his disciple, observe and uphold the faith, enter our Buddha's religion, and cultivate good retribution for yourself in the future. What do you say to that?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll go, I'll go,&#8221; the Great Sage repeated over and over again.</P>
<P>&#8220;As you have reformed,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I'll give you a Buddhist name.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've already got a name. It's Sun Wukong.&#8221; The Bodhisattva, very pleased, said, &#8220;I made two converts earlier, and their names both contained Wu ('Awakened'). There's no need to give you any further instructions, so I'll be off.&#8221; The Great Sage, now aware of his own Buddha-nature, was converted to the Buddha's religion; and the Bodhisattva devotedly continued her search for a saintly monk.</p>

<P>After leaving that place she and Huian carried straight on to the East, and before long they reached Chang'an, the capital of the Great Tang. Putting away their mists and clouds, teacher and pupil turned themselves into a pair of scabby itinerant monks and went inside the city of Chang'an. It was already dark, and beside the great market street they saw a shrine to a local tutelary god and went in. The local god was thrown into confusion at the sight of them, and the devil soldiers quaked with terror; they knew that she was a Bodhisattva, and kowtowed to her in greeting. The local god then scurried off to tell the City God, the Lord of the Alter, and the gods of all the other shrines in Chang'an. When they knew that the Bodhisattva had come they all went to report to her and said, &#8220;Bodhisattva, please forgive us for our crime in being late to welcome you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You mustn't let a whisper of this get out,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I have come here on a decree from the Buddha to find someone to fetch the scriptures. I shall be borrowing your temple for a few days while I find this true monk, and then I shall go back.&#8221; All the gods returned to their own shrines, and they took the local god to stay in the temple of the City God. Teacher and disciple disguised their true appearances. If you don't know whom they found to fetch the scriptures, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>他与木叉离了此处，一直东来，不一日就到了长安大唐国。敛雾收云，师徒们变作两个疥癞游僧，入长安城里，早不觉天晚。行至大市街旁，见一座土地神祠，二人径入，唬得那土地心慌，鬼兵胆战，知是菩萨，叩头接入。那土地又急跑报与城隍、社令，及满长安各庙神祗，都知是菩萨，参见告道：“菩萨，恕众神接迟之罪。”菩萨道：“汝等切不可走漏一毫消息，我奉佛旨，特来此处寻访取经人。借你庙宇，权住几日，待访着真僧即回。”众神各归本处，把个土地赶在城隍庙里暂住，他师徒们隐遁真形。毕竟不知寻出那个取经人来，且听下回分解。
