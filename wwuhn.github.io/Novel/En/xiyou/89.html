<P>When the Dhyana Reaches Yuhua a Display of Magic Is Given</P>
<P>The Mind-Ape and the Mother of Wood Take Their Own Disciples</P>
</div>
<P>The story tells how after happily taking their leave of the marquis the Tang Priest turned to Monkey as he rode and said, &#8220;Worthy disciple, this good result was even better than rescuing the babies in Bhiksuland, and it was all your achievement.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In Bhiksuland you only saved 1,111 little boys,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;That's no comparison with this heavy, soaking rain that's saved tens of thousands of lives. I've been quietly admiring my big brother's magical powers that extend right up to the heavens, as well as his mercy that covers the whole earth.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Merciful and good our big brother may be,&#8221; said Pig with a laugh, &#8220;but it's just a show of being kind. Inside he's a troublemaker. When he's with me he treats me like dirt.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When have I ever treated you like dirt?&#8221; Monkey protested. &#8220;Often enough,&#8221; replied Pig. &#8220;You're always seeing to it that I get tied up, hung up, boiled and steamed. After being so kind to all those tens of thousands of people in Fengxian you should have stayed there for half a year and let me have a few more good filling meals. Why did you have to be sending us on our way?&#8221;</P>
<P>When the venerable elder heard this he shouted, &#8220;You idiot! Can you think of nothing but your greed? Stop quarrelling and be on your way.&#8221; Daring say no more, Pig thrust out his snout, shouldered the luggage, and followed the master and his fellow disciples along the road, laughing loudly.</P>
<P>Time moved as fast as a shuttle, and soon it was late autumn. What could be seen was,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The end of ripples on the waters,</P>
<P>The mountains' bones looking lean.</P>
<P>Red leaves fly around,</P>
<P>In the time of yellowing flowers.</P>
<P>Under the clear and frosty sky the nights seem longer;</P>
<P>The moon shines white through the windows.</P>
<P>Many the household fires in the evening light;</P>
<P>The water gleams cold all over the lake.</P>
<P>The clover fern is now white,</P>
<P>While knotweed blooms red.</P>
<P>Mandarins are green and oranges yellow;</P>
<P>Willows are withering and the millet is ripe.</P>
<P>Beside the desolate village wild geese land among the reeds;</P>
<P>Cocks call by the country inn while the beans are harvested.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the four of them had been travelling for a long time they saw the towering shape of a city wall. &#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said Sanzang, waving his riding-crop, &#8220;you can see there's another city there. I wonder where it is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Neither of us have ever been here before,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;so how could I know? Let's go ahead and ask.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before the words were out of his mouth an old man appeared from among some trees. He was leaning on a stick, lightly dressed with coconut sandals on his feet and had a sash round his waist. The Tang Priest hastily dismounted and went over to greet the old man.</P>
<P>Returning his greeting as he leaned on his stick, the old man asked, &#8220;Where are you from, reverend sir?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am a poor monk sent by the Tang court in the East to worship the Buddha in the Thunder Monastery and fetch the scriptures,&#8221; the Tang Priest replied, putting his hands together in front of his chest. &#8220;Now that I have come to this distinguished place I wonder which city it is that I can see in the distance, and I would ask you, venerable benefactor, to inform me.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the old man heard this he replied, &#8220;Enlightened master of the dhyana, this humble place of ours is Yuhua County in one of the prefectures of India. The lord of our city is a member of the king of India's royal family who has been made prince of Yuhua. He is a very worthy prince who respects both Buddhist and Taoist clergy and cares deeply for the common people. If you go to see him he will certainly treat you with great respect.&#8221; Sanzang thanked the old man, who went off through the woods.</P>
<P>Sanzang then turned back to tell his disciples what had happened. The three of them were happily going to help the master back on his horse when Sanzang said, &#8220;It's not far. There is no need to ride.&#8221; The four of them then walked to a street beside the city wall to take a look. This was an area where traders lived; it was crowded with people and business was good. The people looked and sounded no different from those of China. &#8220;Be careful, disciples,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;On no account must you act wild.&#8221;</P>
<P>At that Pig bowed his head and Friar Sand covered his face, leaving only Monkey to support the master. On both sides of the road people were crowding in to look at them, shouting, &#8220;We only have eminent monks who subdue dragons and tigers here. We've never seen monks who subdue pigs and monkeys before.&#8221; This was more than Pig could stand.</P>
<P>Thrusting his snout at them he said, &#8220;Have you ever seen a monk in all your life who subdued the king of the pigs?&#8221; This gave all the people in the street so bad a fright that they fell back on both sides of them stumbling and tripping over, trying to get away.</P>
<P>&#8220;Put that snout away at once, you idiot,&#8221; said Monkey with a grin, &#8220;and don't try to make yourself look pretty. Just pay attention while you're crossing the bridge.&#8221; The idiot lowered his head and kept grinning. Once over the drawbridge they entered the city, where the main roads were bustling and prosperous with bars and houses of entertainment. It was indeed a city in a divine region, and there is a poem to prove it that goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>An eternally iron-strong city like splendid brocade,</P>
<P>Full of fresh color, lying next to a river near mountains,</P>
<P>Connected by boat with lakes for the movement of goods.</P>
<P>A thousand wine-shops await behind curtains.</P>
<P>Everywhere smoke rises from towering buildings;</P>
<P>Each morning the lanes are filled with the hubbub of traders.</P>
<P>The look of the city was much like Chang'an:</P>
<P>Cock-crows and the barking of dogs were all just the same.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have heard tell of the foreigners in the West,&#8221; Sanzang thought with secret delight, &#8220;but I have never come here before. On close examination it is no different from our Great Tang. This must be what is meant by paradise.&#8221; When he learned that a bushel of hulled rice cost only four tenths of an ounce of silver and a pound of sesame oil only eight thousandths of an ounce of silver he realized that this truly was a place where crops grew in abundance.</P>
<P>After walking for quite a long time they reached the prince of Yuhua's palace. On either side of the palace gates were the office of the remembrancer, the law courts, the prince's kitchens and the government hostel.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciples,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;here is the palace. Wait while I go inside for the prince to inspect our passport and let us on our way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We can't very well stand at the gates while you go in, Master,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;Can you not see 'Government Hostel' written over that gateway?&#8221; Sanzang asked. &#8220;Go and sit there and see if you can buy some fodder for the horse. If the prince offers me a meal when I have my audience with him I will send for you to share it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Go on in, Master, and don't worry,&#8221; said Brother Monkey. &#8220;I can cope.&#8221; Friar Sand carried the luggage into the hostel, where the staff were so alarmed by their hideous faces that they did not dare ask them any questions or send them away but could only invite them to sit down.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the master changed his habit and hat and went straight into the prince's palace with the passport in his hands. Soon he was met by a protocol officer who asked, &#8220;Where are you from, reverend sir?&#8221;</P>

<P>&#8220;I am a monk sent by the Great Tang in the East to worship the Lord Buddha and fetch the scriptures in the Great Thunder Monastery,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;Now that I have reached this distinguished place I would like to have my passport inspected and returned, which is why I have come to seek an audience with His Royal Highness.&#8221; The protocol officer passed this on, and as the prince was indeed an enlightened one he sent for Sanzang at once.</P>
<P>Sanzang bowed in greeting before the prince's hall, and the prince invited him into the hall to sit down. When the prince read the passport that Sanzang handed him and saw the seals and signatures from so many countries on it he signed it himself, folded it up and put it on his table. &#8220;Venerable Teacher of the Nation,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you have passed through many countries on your way here from Great Tang. How long has your journey taken?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have kept no record of the distance,&#8221; Sanzang said, &#8220;but some years ago the Boddhisattva Guanyin appeared to me and left an address in verse in which it was said that the road would be sixty thousand miles long. I have already seen fourteen winters and summers on my journey.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That means fourteen years,&#8221; the prince replied. &#8220;I should imagine that there were many delays along the way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It would be hard to tell of them all,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;There were thousands of monsters and I don't know how much suffering to be endured before I could reach here.&#8221; The prince was so pleased with his visitor that he ordered his kitchens to prepare a vegetarian meal for him.</P>
<P>&#8220;I wish to inform Your Royal Highness that I have three disciples,&#8221; Sanzang said. &#8220;As they are waiting outside I will not be able to delay our journey by accepting the meal.&#8221; The prince then ordered his aides to go straight out to invite the venerable elder's three disciples into the palace to share the meal.</P>
<P>When the aides went out with this invitation they said, &#8220;We can't see them, we can't see them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There are three hideous monks sitting in the hostel,&#8221; one of their staff said. &#8220;Must be them.&#8221;</P>
<P>The aides and their staff then went to the hostel, where they asked the people in charge, &#8220;Which are the disciples of the monk from Great Tang who's going to fetch the scriptures? His Royal Highness has invited them to a meal.&#8221;</P>
<P>As soon as Pig, who was sitting there snoozing, heard the word &#8220;meal&quot; he could not help jumping up and saying, &#8220;We are, we are,&#8221; at the sight of which the palace aides' souls flew from their bodies as they shivered and said, &#8220;A pig demon! A pig demon!&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he seized hold of Pig and said, &#8220;Act a bit more civilized, brother, and don't be so wild.&#8221; When the officials saw Monkey they all said, &#8220;A monkey spirit! A monkey spirit!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no need to be frightened,&#8221; said Friar Sand, raising his hands together in polite greeting. &#8220;We're all disciples of the Tang Priest.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;A stove god, a stove god,&#8221; was the officials' reaction to the sight of him. Monkey then told Pig to lead the horse and Friar Sand to shoulder the carrying-pole as they followed the officials' staff into the prince of Yuhua's palace. The aides went ahead to announce them.</P>
<P>When the prince looked up and saw how ugly they were he too was frightened. &#8220;Do not be alarmed, Your Royal Highness,&#8221; said Sanzang, putting his hands together in front of his chest. &#8220;Although my rough disciples are ugly they have good hearts.&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig intoned a noise of respect and said, &#8220;How do you do?&#8221; This made the prince feel even more alarmed.</P>
<P>&#8220;All my rough disciples are from the wilds and the mountains and they do not know how to behave,&#8221; Sanzang explained, &#8220;so please forgive them.&#8221; Overcoming his fear, the prince told the superintendent of his kitchens to take the monks to eat in the Gauze Pavilion.</P>
<P>Sanzang thanked the prince, came down from the hall to proceed to the pavilion with his disciples, then grumbled at Pig, &#8220;You idiot,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you've not a shred of manners. If you had kept your mouth shut that would have been fine, but why did you have to be so coarse? That one remark from you was enough to knock a mountain over.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I did better by not making a respectful chant,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;and I saved a bit of my breath too.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You didn't even intone the chant properly,&#8221; said Friar Sand to Pig. &#8220;First of all, you stuck your snout out and roared.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It makes me hopping mad,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;The other day the master told me that the polite thing when I met someone was to say, 'How do you do?' I do it today and you tell me it's wrong. How do you want me to behave?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I told you to say, 'How do you do?' when you meet people,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;but not to make such a fool of yourself when you meet a prince. As the saying goes, things, like people, come in grades. Why can't you see the differences of social rank?&#8221; While he was still making these remarks the superintendent of the kitchens led servants in to set out tables and chairs and serve the vegetarian feast. Then the monks stopped talking and started eating their meal.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the prince withdrew from the palace hall to his living quarters his three sons noticed his pallor and asked, &#8220;What has given you such a fright today, Father?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;A most remarkable monk has arrived,&#8221; the prince replied. &#8220;He has been sent by the Great Tang in the East to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures, and he came to present his passport. When I invited him to take a meal he told me that he had some disciples outside the palace, so I asked them in. When they came in a moment later they didn't kowtow to me but just said, 'How do you do?' That was upsetting enough. Then when I looked at them I saw that they were all as ugly as demons, which gave me quite a shock. That's why I'm looking pale.&#8221;</P>
<P>Now the three young princes were no ordinary boys. They were all fond of the martial arts, so they stretched out their hands, rolled up their sleeves and said, &#8220;They must be evil spirits from the mountains disguised as humans. Wait while we fetch our weapons and take a look at them.&#8221;</P>
<P>Splendid young princes! The eldest wielded a brow-high rod, the second a nine-toothed rake and the third a black-painted cudgel, and the three of them strode with great valour and spirit out of the palace, shouting, &#8220;What's this about monks fetching scriptures? Where are they?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Young prince,&#8221; replied the superintendent of the kitchens and the others on their knees, &#8220;they're eating in the Gauze Pavilion.&#8221;</P>
<P>The young princes then charged straight in without stopping to think as they shouted, &#8220;Are you men or monsters? Tell us at once and we'll spare your lives.&#8221;</P>
<P>This gave Sanzang such a fright that he turned pale, dropped his bowl, bowed to them and replied, &#8220;I have come from Great Tang to fetch the scriptures. I am a man, not a monster.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You look human enough,&#8221; the princes said, &#8220;but the three ugly ones are definitely monsters.&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig kept eating and ignored them, while Friar Sand and Monkey bowed and said, &#8220;We're all human. Our faces may be ugly but our hearts are good, and despite our clumsy bodies we have good natures. Where are you three from, and why are you shooting your mouths off so wildly?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;These three gentlemen are His Royal Highness's sons,&#8221; explained the superintendent of the kitchens and the others who were standing at the side of the pavilion.</P>
<P>&#8220;Well, Your Highnesses,&#8221; said Pig, throwing down his bowl, &#8220;what are you carrying those weapons for? Do you want a fight with us?&#8221;</P>
<P>The second prince strode forward wielding his rake in both hands to strike at Pig, which made him say with a chuckle, &#8220;That rake of yours is only fit to be the grandson of my one.&#8221; With that he stripped down, pulled his own rake out from his belt and swung it, making ten thousand beams of golden light, then went through some movements, leaving a thousand strands of auspicious vapor. The second prince was so terrified that his hands went weak and his muscles turned numb and he lost the nerve for any more showing off.</P>
<P>When Monkey saw that the oldest of the young princes was leaping about with a brow-high rod he brought his own gold-banded cudgel out from his ear and shook it to make it as thick as a bowl and twelve or thirteen feet long. Ramming it into the ground, he made a hole about three feet deep in which it stood upright, then said with a smile, &#8220;I'm giving you this cudgel.&#8221;</P>
<P>As soon as the prince heard this he threw his own rod down and went to take the cudgel, but though he pulled at it with all his strength he couldn't move it by as much as a hair's breath. Then he straightened himself up and shook it, but it was as if it had taken root. At this the third prince started acting wild, moving into the attack with his black-painted cudgel. Friar Sand dodged the blow, then brought out his own demon-quelling staff, and as he fingered it brilliant light and glowing, coloured clouds came from it, leaving the superintendent of the kitchens and the rest of them wide-eyed and speechless. The three young princes then kowtowed, saying, &#8220;Divine teachers, divine teachers, we mere mortals failed to recognize you. We beg you to give us a display of your powers.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey went up to them, effortlessly picked up his cudgel and said, &#8220;It's too cramped here for me to do my stuff. I'm jumping up into the auto play around and give you something to see.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage went whistling up by somersault and stood on an auspicious cloud of many colours up in mid-air about three hundred feet above the ground. Then he moved up and down and spun to left and right as he performed a Canopy from Which Flowers Are Scattered and a Twisting Dragon with his gold-banded club. At first both he and the cudgel moved like flowers being added to brocade, but later he could no longer be seen as the whole sky was filled with the whirling cudgel.</P>
<P>As he roared his approval from down below Pig could not keep still, and with a great shout of &#8220;I'm going to have a bit of fun too!&#8221; the splendid idiot rode a breeze up into the air and started swinging his rake. He went three times up, four times down, five times to the left, six times to the right, seven times forwards and eight times backwards as he ran through all the movements he knew, filling the air with a noise like a howling gale.</P>
<P>Just when he had warmed up Friar Sand said to Sanzang, &#8220;Master, let me go up and give a show too.&#8221; Springing up into the air with both feet, the splendid monk whirled his club through the air, which glittered with golden light. Wielding his demon-subduing cudgel he performed a Red Phoenix Facing the Sun and a Hungry Tiger Seizing Its Prey, attacking hard and defending with time to spare as he turned for a sudden forward thrust. The three brother disciples all gave a most imposing display of their magical powers. This was indeed</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>An image of the dhyana, no common sight;</P>
<P>The causation of the Great Way filling all of space.</P>
<P>Metal and wood fill the dharma-world with their might;</P>
<P>A pinch of elixir produces perfect unity.</P>
<P>The quality of these magic warriors is often displayed;</P>
<P>The splendor of their weapons is widely revered.</P>
<P>Lofty though India is,</P>
<P>The princes of Yuhua now return to the central truth.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This all so terrified the three young princes that they fell to their knees in the dust; and all the staff in the Gauze Pavilion, high and low, together with the senior prince in his palace, all the soldiers, civilians, men and women, Buddhist monks and nuns, Taoist clergy, lay people&#8212;everyone in fact&#8212;all invoked the Buddha, kowtowed, held sticks of incense and worshipped. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>All the monks were converted at the sight of the true images,</P>
<P>Bringing blessings to mankind and the joys of peace.</P>
<P>From here the achievement was won on the road to enlightenment;</P>
<P>All joined in meditation and worshipped the Buddha.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the three of them had given a display of their heroic powers they brought their auspicious clouds down to land, put their weapons away, joined their hands together in homage to the Tang Priest, thanked him and took their seats again.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The three young princes hurried back into the palace to report to their father, &#8220;A most wonderful thing has happened, Father. Today has been a tremendous success. Did you see the performance in the sky just now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When I saw the coloured clouds glowing in the sky a little while back I, your mother and everyone else in the inner palace burned incense and worshipped,&#8221; the prince, their father, replied. &#8220;I don't know where the gods or immortals who had gathered there were from.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They weren't gods and immortals from somewhere else,&#8221; the young princes said. &#8220;They were the three hideous disciples of the monk who's going to fetch the scriptures. One of them uses a gold-banded iron cudgel, one a nine-toothed take, and one a demon-quelling staff, all exactly the same as our three weapons. When we asked them to give us a display they said it was too cramped down here to be able to manage, so they'd go up into the sky to give us a show. Then they all went up on clouds, filling the sky with auspicious clouds and vapors. They only came down a moment ago, and they're now sitting in the Gauze Pavilion. We are all very taken with them and we'd like to make them our teachers and learn their skills to protect the country with. This really will be an enormous achievement. I wonder what Your Majesty thinks.&#8221; When the prince, their father, heard this he was convinced and agreed.</P>
<P>Father and sons then went straight to the Gauze Pavilion, going on foot instead of by carriage, and without any parasols. The four travelers had by now packed up their luggage and were just about to go to the palace to thank the prince for the meal and start out on their journey again when they saw the prince of Yuhua and his sons come into the pavilion and prostrate themselves before them. The venerable elder hurriedly rose and prostrated himself to return the courtesy, while Monkey and the rest of them moved aside with a hint of a mocking grin. When the kowtowing was over the four travelers were happy to go into the palace on being invited to do so and take seats of honour.</P>
<P>Then the senior prince got up and said, &#8220;Tang Master, there is one thing I would like to ask of you, but I do not know whether your three illustrious disciples will grant it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My disciples will obey any instruction that Your Royal Highness gives them,&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;When I first saw you gentlemen,&#8221; said the prince, &#8220;I took you for pilgrim monks from distant Tang, and because I am a mere mortal with fleshly eyes I treated you in a most offhand way. It was only when I saw Teacher Sun, Teacher Zhu and Teacher Sand whirling around in the sky that I realized you are immortals and Buddhas. My three wretched sons have been fond of the martial arts all their lives and they now wish most sincerely to be accepted as your disciples and learn some of your skills. I beg that in the greatness of your hearts you will agree to be the salvation of my boys. I will certainly reward you with all the wealth of the city.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Brother Monkey heard this he could not restrain himself from replying with a chuckle, &#8220;You really don't understand, Your Royal Highness. As monks we'd love to have disciples, and your fine sons have their hearts set on goodness. But you mustn't talk about material benefits. As long as they can get on with us we'll look after them.&#8221; This delighted the prince, who ordered a great banquet in the main hall of the palace. It was amazing: no sooner had he issued his order than everything was there. This is what could be seen:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Fluttering silken decorations,</P>
<P>Darkly fragrant incense smoke.</P>
<P>Gold-inlaid tables hung with knotted silks,</P>
<P>Dazzling the eyes;</P>
<P>Lacquered chairs with cushions of brocade,</P>
<P>Making them even more splendid.</P>
<P>Fresh fruit,</P>
<P>Fragrant tea.</P>
<P>Three or four courses of pure confectioneries,</P>
<P>One or two servings of rich and pure breadrolls.</P>
<P>The crisp steamed honeycakes were even finer;</P>
<P>The deep-fried sweets were truly delicious.</P>
<P>There were jugs of mild rice-wine,</P>
<P>Better than nectar when poured;</P>
<P>Servings of Yangxian tea that is fit for immortals,</P>
<P>More fragrant than cassia when held in the hands.</P>
<P>Every possible dish is provided;</P>
<P>All that is offered is outstanding.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Meanwhile there was singing, dancing, instrumental music, acrobatics and opera to entertain them. Master, disciples, the prince and his sons all had a day of delight, and after night fell unnoticed they dispersed. The princes then had beds and curtains set up in the pavilion and invited their teachers to turn in for the night; early the next morning they would piously burn incense and call on them again to ask them to teach their martial skills. These orders were obeyed, and hot, scented water was brought in for the travelers to bath in, after which everyone went to bed. At that time</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The birds perched high in the trees and all was silent;</P>
<P>The poet came down from his couch to end his chanting.</P>
<P>The light of the Milky Way now filled the sky,</P>
<P>And the grass grew thicker along the overgrown path.</P>
<P>The bang of a washing stick came from another courtyard;</P>
<P>The distant mountains and passes made one long for home.</P>
<P>The chirp of crickets expressed people's feelings,</P>
<P>Chirruping at the bedside interrupted one's dreams.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>That describes the night. Early the next morning the prince and his three sons came to call on the venerable elder again. The previous day they had greeted each other with the etiquette appropriate to a prince, but today's greetings were those appropriate to teachers.</P>
<P>The three young princes kowtowed to Monkey, Pig and Friar Sand, then asked with bows, &#8220;Will you let your disciples have a look at your weapons, honoured teachers?&#8221; As soon as Pig heard this request he happily brought out his iron rake and threw it on the ground, while Friar Sand tossed his staff against the wall. The second and third young princes sprang to their feet to pick them up, but they might just as well have been dragonflies trying to shake a stone pillar: they both strained themselves till they were red in the face without moving the weapons in the slightest. When their elder brother saw this he said, &#8220;Don't waste your efforts, brothers. Our teachers' weapons are all magical ones. Goodness only knows how heavy they are.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My rake's not all that heavy,&#8221; said Pig with a smile. &#8220;It only weighs a couple of tons&#8212;5,048 pounds including the handle.&#8221;</P>
<P>The third prince then asked Friar Sand how heavy his staff was. &#8220;It's 5,048 pounds too,&#8221; replied Friar Sand with a smile.</P>
<P>The oldest of the young princes then asked Brother Monkey to let him see the gold-banded cudgel. Monkey produced the needle from his ear, shook it in the wind to make it as thick as a rice bowl, and stood it upright in the ground in front of him, to the consternation and alarm of all the princes and officials. The three young princes then kowtowed again and said, &#8220;Teacher Zhu and Teacher Sand carry their weapons under their clothes where they can get them out. Why do you take yours out of your ear, Teacher Sun? How do you make it grow in the wind?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You wouldn't realize that this isn't some mere mortal object,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;When chaos was first parted the iron was cast:</P>
<P>Yu the Great had the work done himself.</P>
<P>When he unified the depths of rivers, lakes and seas</P>
<P>This cudgel served as a measuring rod.</P>
<P>In the prosperity after mountains and seas had been ordered</P>
<P>It floated to the gates of the Eastern Ocean.</P>
<P>Over the years it gave off a coloured glow,</P>
<P>Learned to shrink and to grow and shine with pure light.</P>
<P>It was my destiny to recover this rod</P>
<P>Which endlessly changes when I say the spell.</P>
<P>When I tell it to grow it fills the universe,</P>
<P>But it can be as tiny as a needle's eye.</P>
<P>It's known as As-You-Will and called gold-banded;</P>
<P>In Heaven and on Earth it is quite unique.</P>
<P>Its weight is thirteen thousand and five hundred pounds;</P>
<P>Whether thick or fine it can bring life or death.</P>
<P>Once it helped me make havoc in Heaven,</P>
<P>And took part when I attacked the Underworld.</P>
<P>It always succeeds in subduing dragons and tigers,</P>
<P>Everywhere wipes out monsters and ogres.</P>
<P>If it points up the sun goes dark;</P>
<P>Heaven, earth, gods, devils, all are afraid.</P>
<P>Passed on by magic since the birth of time,</P>
<P>This is no ordinary piece of iron.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the young princes had heard this they all started kowtowing endlessly, bowing over and over again as they earnestly begged for instruction.</P>
<P>&#8220;Which fighting skills do the three of you want to learn?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The one of us who uses a rod wants to learn that,&#8221; the young princes replied, &#8220;the one who fights with a rake wants to learn the rake, and the staff man wants to learn the staff.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Teaching would be easy enough,&#8221; replied Monkey with a smile, &#8220;except that you're all too weak to be able to use our weapons, so you won't be able to master them. 'A badly-drawn tiger only looks like a dog.' As they used to say in the old days, 'If the teaching isn't strict it shows the teacher is idle; if the student doesn't learn it's his own fault.' If you're really sincere you'd better burn incense and bow to Heaven and Earth. I'll give you some magic strength before teaching you how to fight.&#8221;</P>
<P>The three young princes were very pleased to hear him say this, and they at once carried in an incense table themselves, washed their hands, lit incense sticks and bowed to Heaven. This done, they asked their teachers to instruct them.</P>
<P>Monkey stepped down and said to the Tang Priest with a bow, &#8220;Please forgive your disciple, honoured Master. Ever since in your goodness you rescued me at the Double Boundary Mountain and I became a Buddhist all those years ago we've been travelling West. Although I've never done very much to repay your kindness I have crossed plenty of rivers and mountains and done everything I possibly could. Now that we've come to this land of the Buddha and had the good fortune of meeting these three young princes, they've taken us as their teachers of martial arts. As our pupils they'd be your pupils' pupils, so I ask you respectfully, Master, to allow us to instruct them.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang was delighted, and when Pig and Friar Sand saw Monkey bowing to him they kowtowed too and said, &#8220;Master, we're stupid and too awkward with words to be able to explain things properly. Please take your dharma seat and let each of us take a pupil. It'll be fun, and something to remind us of our journey West.&#8221; Sanzang was happy to agree.</P>
<P>Monkey then took the three young princes into a quiet room behind the pavilion where he drew a star-chart of the Dipper and told them to prostrate themselves inside it while they shut their eyes and settled their spirits. Meanwhile he silently said the words of the spell, recited a mantra, and blew magic breath into the hearts of the three of them. He put their primal spirits back into their original home, taught them magical spells, gave each of them immense strength, applied the right heat, and performed a magic that replaced their old bodies and bones with new ones. After the heat circulated in a roundabout way through their bodies the three young princes came to, stood up, rubbed their faces, summoned up their spirits, and all found that they were much stronger. The eldest of them could pick up the gold-banded cudgel, the second could swing the nine-toothed rake, and the third could raise the demon-quelling staff.</P>
<P>When the king saw this he was beside himself with delight, and arranged another vegetarian feast for the Tang Priest and his three disciples. In front of the banquet each of the princes was taught his own skill: the one who was learning the rod practised with the rod, the one who was learning the rake practised with the rake, and the one who was learning the staff practised with the staff. Though the young princes did manage a few turns and movements it took a lot of effort, and going through a series of movements left them gasping for breath, so that they could not go on. Besides this, the weapons they were using had the power of transformation, so that as the princes advanced, retreated, attacked and lifted the weapons shrunk, grew and went through amazing changes by themselves. But the princes were, after all, only mortals, and were unable to keep up with the speed of their weapons. Later that day the banquet came to an end.</P>
<P>The next day the three princes came back once more to express their thanks and say, &#8220;We are very grateful to you, divine teachers, for giving us this strength, but when we try to spin your divine weapons around we can only move them with great difficulty. We would like to get smiths to make lighter copies of them, but we don't know whether you would agree to that, Teachers.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Great, great,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;That's the way to talk. You ought to have your own made because you can't use our weapons, and anyhow we need them to protect the Dharma and beat monsters.&#8221; The princes then sent for smiths who bought ten thousand pounds of iron and steel, set up a workshop with a furnace in the front courtyard of the prince's palace, and began to cast the weapons. On the first day the steel was made, and on the second Monkey and the other two were asked to bring out their gold-banded cudgel, nine-toothed rake and demon-quelling staff and put them under the matting shelter to be copied. The work went on by night and day without stopping.</P>
<P>These weapons were the treasures they always carried with them that they could not be parted from for a moment. Normally they hid them about their persons. Now the weapons were protected by coloured light, so that when they were put in the yard of the workshop for several days many beams of radiance reached up to the heavens, while every kind of auspicious vapor blanketed the earth. That night an evil spirit, who was sitting out on a night watch in a cave called Tigermouth Cave on a mountain called Mount Leopard Head that was only some twenty-five miles from the city, noticed the glow and the auspicious vapors.</P>
<P>Going up on his cloud to investigate he saw that the light came from the city, whereupon he brought his cloud down and went closer for a better look. Discovering that the light was coming from the weapons, he thought with delight and desire, &#8220;What wonderful weapons, what splendid treasures. I wonder whose they are and why they've been left here. This must be my lucky chance. I'll take them, I'll take them.&#8221; His covetousness now moved, he created a mighty wind, scooped up all three weapons and took them back to his cave. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Not for one moment must the Way be left;</P>
<P>What can be left is not the true Way.</P>
<P>Cultivation and trance will both be in vain</P>
<P>When divine arms have been taken away.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you do not know how these weapons were found, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>禅到玉华施法会</p>
<p>心猿木母授门人</p>
</div>
<p>话说唐僧喜喜欢欢别了郡侯，在马上向行者道：“贤徒，这一场善果，真胜似比丘国搭救儿童，皆尔之功也。”沙僧道：“比丘国只救得一千一百一十一个小儿，怎似这场大雨，滂沱浸润，活彀者万万千千性命！弟子也暗自称赞大师兄的法力通天，慈恩盖地也。”八戒笑道：“哥的恩也有，善也有，却只是外施仁义，内包祸心。但与老猪走，就要作践人。”行者道：“我在那里作践你？”八戒道：“也彀了！也彀了！常照顾我捆，照顾我吊，照顾我煮，照顾我蒸！今在凤仙郡施了恩惠与万万之人，就该住上半年，带挈我吃几顿自在饱饭，却只管催趱行路！”长老闻言，喝道：“这个呆子，怎么只思量掳嘴！快走路，再莫斗口！”</p>

<p>八戒不敢言，掬掬嘴，挑着行囊，打着哈哈，师徒们奔上大路。</p>

<p>此时光景如梭，又值深秋之候，但见：水痕收，山骨瘦。红叶纷飞，黄花时候。霜晴觉夜长，月白穿窗透。家家烟火夕阳多，处处湖光寒水溜。白蘋香，红蓼茂。桔绿橙黄，柳衰谷秀。荒村雁落碎芦花，野店鸡声收菽豆。四众行彀多时，又见城垣影影，长老举鞭遥指叫：“悟空，你看那里又有一座城池，却不知是甚去处。”行者道：“你我俱未曾到，何以知之？且行至边前问人。”</p>

<p>说不了，忽见树丛里走出一个老者，手持竹杖，身着轻衣，足踏一对棕鞋，腰束一条扁带，慌得唐僧滚鞍下马，上前道个问讯。</p>

<p>那老者扶杖还礼道：“长老那方来的？”唐僧合掌道：“贫僧东土唐朝差往雷音拜佛求经者，今至宝方，遥望城垣，不知是甚去处，特问老施主指教。”那老者闻言，口称：“有道禅师，我这敝处，乃天竺国下郡，地名玉华县。县中城主，就是天竺皇帝之宗室，封为玉华王。此王甚贤，专敬僧道，重爱黎民。老禅师若去相见，必有重敬。”三藏谢了，那老者径穿树林而去。</p>

<p>三藏才转身对徒弟备言前事。他三人欣喜，扶师父上马。</p>

<p>三藏道：“没多路，不须乘马。”四众遂步至城边街道观看。原来那关厢人家，做买做卖的，人烟凑集，生意亦甚茂盛。观其声音相貌，与中华无异。三藏吩咐：“徒弟们谨慎，切不可放肆。那八戒低了头，沙僧掩着脸，惟孙行者搀着师父。两边人都来争看，齐声叫道：“我这里只有降龙伏虎的高僧，不曾见降猪伏猴的和尚。”八戒忍不住，把嘴一掬道：“你们可曾看见降猪王的和尚。”唬得满街上人跌跌睮睮，都往两边闪过。行者笑道：“呆子，快藏了嘴，莫装扮，仔细脚下过桥。”那呆子低着头，只是笑。过了吊桥，入城门内，又见那大街上酒楼歌馆，热闹繁华，果然是神州都邑。有诗为证，诗曰：锦城铁瓮万年坚，临水依山色色鲜。百货通湖船入市，千家沽酒店垂帘。楼台处处人烟广，巷陌朝朝客贾喧。不亚长安风景好，鸡鸣犬吠亦般般。三藏心中暗喜道：“人言西域诸番，更不曾到此。细观此景，与我大唐何异！所为极乐世界，诚此之谓也。”又听得人说，白米四钱一石，麻油八厘一斤，真是五谷丰登之处。行彀多时，方到玉华王府，府门左右有长史府、审理厅、典膳所、待客馆。三藏道：“徒弟，此间是府，等我进去，朝王验牒而行。”八戒道：“师父进去，我们可好在衙门前站立？”三藏道：“你不看这门上是待客馆三字！你们都去那里坐下，看有草料，买些喂马。我见了王，倘或赐斋，便来唤你等同享。”行者道：“师父放心前去，老孙自当理会。”那沙僧把行李挑至馆中。馆中有看馆的人役，见他们面貌丑陋，也不敢问他，也不敢教他出去，只得让他坐下不题。</p>

<p>却说老师父换了衣帽，拿了关文，径至王府前，早见引礼官迎着问道：“长老何来？”三藏道：“东土大唐差来大雷音拜佛祖求经之僧，今到贵地，欲倒换关文，特来朝参千岁。”引礼官即为传奏，那王子果然贤达，即传旨召进。三藏至殿下施礼，王子即请上殿赐坐。三藏将关文献上，王子看了，又见有各国印信手押，也就欣然将宝印了，押了花字，收折在案。问道：“国师长老，自你那大唐至此，历遍诸邦，共有几多路程？”三藏道：</p>

<p>“贫僧也未记程途。但先年蒙观音菩萨在我王御前显身，曾留了颂子，言西方十万八千里。贫僧在路，已经过一十四遍寒暑矣。”王子笑道：“十四遍寒暑，即十四年了。想是途中有甚耽搁。”三藏道：“一言难尽！万蛰千魔，也不知受了多少苦楚，才到得宝方！”那王子十分欢喜。即着典膳官备素斋管待。三藏：</p>

<p>“启上殿下，贫僧有三个小徒，在外等候，不敢领斋，但恐迟误行程。”王子教：“当殿官，快去请长老三位徒弟，进府同斋。”当殿官随出外相请，都道：“未曾见，未曾见。”有跟随的人道：“待客馆中坐着三个丑貌和尚，想必是也。”当殿官同众至馆中，即问看馆的道：“那个是大唐取经僧的高徒？我主有旨，请吃斋也。”八戒正坐打盹，听见一个斋字，忍不住跳起身来答道：“我们是！我们是！”当殿官一见了，魂飞魄丧，都战战的道：“是个猪魈！猪魈！”行者听见，一把扯住八戒道：“兄弟，放斯文些，莫撒村野。”那众官见了行者，又道：“是个猴精！猴精！”沙僧拱手道：“列位休得惊恐。我三人都是唐僧的徒弟。”众官见了，又道：“灶君！灶君！”孙行者即教八戒牵马，沙僧挑担，同众入玉华王府。当殿官先入启知，那王子举目见那等丑恶，却也心中害怕。三藏合掌道：“千岁放心，顽徒虽是貌丑，却都心良。”八戒朝上唱个喏道：“贫僧问讯了。”王子愈觉心惊。三藏道：“顽徒都是山野中收来的，不会行礼，万望赦罪。”王子奈着惊恐，教典膳官请众僧官去暴纱亭吃斋，三藏谢了恩，辞王下殿，同至亭内，埋怨八戒道：“你这夯货，全不知一毫礼体！索性不开口，便也罢了，怎么那般粗鲁！一句话，足足冲倒泰山！”行者笑道：“还是我不唱喏的好，也省些力气。”沙僧道：“他唱喏又不等齐，预先就抒着个嘴吆喝。”八戒道：“活淘气！活淘气！师父前日教我，见人打个问讯儿是礼。今日打问讯，又说不好，教我怎的干么！”三藏道：“我教你见了人打个问讯，不曾教你见王子就此歪缠！常言道，物有几等物，人有几等人，如何不分个贵贱？”正说处，见那典膳官带领人役，调开桌椅，摆上斋来，师徒们却不言语，各各吃斋。</p>

<p>却说那王子退殿进宫，宫中有三个小王子，见他面容改色，即问道：“父王今日为何有此惊恐？”王子道：“适才有东土大唐差来拜佛取经的一个和尚，倒换关文，却一表非凡。我留他吃斋，他说有徒弟在府前，我即命请。少时进来，见我不行大礼，打个问讯，我已不快。及抬头看时，一个个丑似妖魔，心中不觉惊骇，故此面容改色。”原来那三个小王子比众不同，一个个好武好强，便就伸拳掳袖道：“莫敢是那山里走来的妖精，假装人象，待我们拿兵器出去看来！”好王子，大的个拿一条齐眉棍，第二个轮一把九齿钯，第三个使一根乌油黑棒子，雄纠纠、气昂昂的走出王府，吆喝道：“甚么取经的和尚！在那里？”时有典膳官员人等跪下道：“小王，他们在这暴纱亭吃斋哩。”小王子不分好歹，闯将进去，喝道：“汝等是人是怪，快早说来，饶你性命！”唬得三藏面容失色，丢下饭碗，躬着身道：“贫僧乃唐朝来取经者，人也，非怪也。”小王子道：“你便还象个人，那三个丑的，断然是怪！”八戒只管吃饭不睬。沙僧与行者欠身道：“我等俱是人，面虽丑而心良，身虽夯而性善。汝三个却是何来，却这样海口轻狂？”旁有典膳等官道：“三位是我王之子小殿下。”</p>

<p>八戒丢了碗道：“小殿下，各拿兵器怎么？莫是要与我们打哩？”</p>

<p>二王子掣开步，双手舞钯，便要打八戒。八戒嘻嘻笑道：“你那钯只好与我这钯做孙子罢了！”即揭衣，腰间取出钯来，幌一幌，金光万道，丢了解数，有瑞气千条，把个王子唬得手软筋麻，不敢舞弄。行者见大的个使一条齐眉棍，跳阿跳的，即耳朵里取出金箍棒来，幌一幌，碗来粗细，有丈二三长短，着地下一捣，捣了有三尺深浅，竖在那里，笑道：“我把这棍子送你罢！”</p>

<p>那王子听言，即丢了自己棍，去取那棒，双手尽气力一拔，莫想得动分毫，再又端一端，摇一摇，就如生根一般。第三个撒起莽性，使乌油杆棒来打，被沙僧一手劈开，取出降妖宝杖，拈一拈，艳艳光生，纷纷霞亮，唬得那典膳等官，一个个呆呆挣挣，口不能言。三个小王子一齐下拜道：“神师！神师！我等凡人不识，万望施展一番，我等好拜授也。”行者走近前，轻轻的把棒拿将起来道：“这里窄狭，不好展手，等我跳在空中，耍一路儿你们看看。”好大圣，唿哨一声，将筋斗一纵，两只脚踏着五色祥云，起在半空，离地约有三百步高下，把金箍棒丢开个撒花盖顶，黄龙转身，一上一下，左旋右转。起初时人与棒似锦上添花，次后来不见人，只见一天棒滚。八戒在底下喝声采，也忍不住手脚，厉声喊道：“等老猪也去耍耍来！”好呆子，驾起风头，也到半空，丢开钯，上三下四，左五右六，前七后八，满身解数，只听得呼呼风响。正使到热闹处，沙僧对长老道：“师父，也等老沙去操演操演。”好和尚，双着脚一跳，轮着杖，也起在空中，只见那锐气氤氲，金光缥缈，双手使降妖杖丢一个丹凤朝阳，饿虎扑食，紧迎慢挡，捷转忙撺。弟兄三个即展神通，都在那半空中一齐扬威耀武。这才是：真禅景象不凡同，大道缘由满太空。金木施威盈法界，刀圭展转合圆通。神兵精锐随时显，丹器花生到处崇。天竺虽高还戒性，玉华王子总归中。唬得那三个小王子，跪在尘埃。暴纱亭大小人员，并王府里老王子，满城中军民男女，僧尼道俗，一应人等，家家念佛磕头，户户拈香礼拜。果然是：见象归真度众僧，人间作福享清平。从今果正菩提路，尽是参禅拜佛人。他三个各逞雄才，使了一路，按下祥云，把兵器收了，到唐僧面前问讯，谢了师恩，各各坐下不题。</p>

<p>那三个小王子急回宫里，告奏老王道：“父王万千之喜！今有莫大之功也！适才可曾看见半空中舞弄么？”老王道：“我才见半空霞彩，就于宫院内同你母亲等众焚香启拜，更不知是那里神仙降聚也。”小王子道：“不是那里神仙，就是那取经僧三个丑徒弟。一个使金箍铁棒，一个使九齿钉钯，一个使降妖宝杖，把我三个的兵器，比的通没有分毫。我们教他使一路，他嫌地上窄狭，不好支吾，等我起在空中，使一路你看。他就各驾云头，满空中祥云缥缈，瑞气氤氲。才然落下，都坐在暴纱亭里。</p>

<p>做儿的十分欢喜，欲要拜他为师，学他手段，保护我邦，此诚莫大之功！不知父王以为何如？”老王闻言，信心从愿。</p>

<p>当时父子四人，不摆驾，不张盖，步行到暴纱亭。他四众收拾行李，欲进府谢斋，辞王起行，偶见玉华王父子上亭来倒身下拜，慌得长老舒身，扑地还礼，行者等闪过旁边，微微冷笑。</p>

<p>众拜毕，请四众进府堂上坐。四众欣然而入，老王起身道：“唐老师父，孤有一事奉求，不知三位高徒，可能容否？”三藏道：</p>

<p>“但凭千岁吩咐，小徒不敢不从。”老王道：“孤先见列位时，只以为唐朝远来行脚僧，其实肉眼凡胎，多致轻亵。适见孙师、猪师、沙师起舞在空，方知是仙是佛。孤三个犬子，一生好弄武艺，今谨发虔心，欲拜为门徒，学些武艺。万望老师开天地之心，普运慈舟，传度小儿，必以倾城之资奉谢。”行者闻言忍不住呵呵笑道：“你这殿下，好不会事！我等出家人，巴不得要传几个徒弟。你令郎既有从善之心，切不可说起分毫之利，但只以情相处，足为爱也。”王子听言，十分欢喜，随命大排筵宴，就于本府正堂摆列。噫！一声旨意，即刻俱完。但见那：结彩飘飖，香烟馥郁。戗金桌子挂绞绡，幌人眼目；彩漆椅儿铺锦绣，添座风光。树果新鲜，茶汤香喷。三五道闲食清甜，一两餐馒头丰洁。蒸酥蜜煎更奇哉，油札糖浇真美矣。有几瓶香糯素酒，斟出来，赛过琼浆；献几番阳羡仙茶，捧到手，香欺丹桂。般般品品皆齐备，色色行行尽出奇。一壁厢叫承应的歌舞吹弹，撮弄演戏。他师徒们并王父子，尽乐一日。不觉天晚，散了酒席，又叫即于暴纱亭铺设床帏，请师安宿，待明早竭诚焚香，再拜求传武艺。众皆听从，即备香汤，请师沐浴，众却归寝。此时那：</p>

<p>众鸟高栖万簌沉，诗人下榻罢哦吟。银河光显天弥亮，野径荒凉草更深。砧杵叮咚敲别院，关山杳窎动乡心。寒蛩声朗知人意，呖呖床头破梦魂。</p>

<p>一宵晚景题过，明早，那老王父子，又来相见这长老。昨日相见，还是王礼，今日就行师礼。那三个小王子对行者、八戒、沙僧当面叩头，拜问道：“尊师之兵器，还借出与弟子们看看。”</p>

<p>八戒闻言，欣然取出钉钯，抛在地下。沙僧将宝杖抛出，倚在墙边。二王子与三王子跳起去便拿，就如蜻蜓撼石柱，一个个挣得红头赤脸，莫想拿动半分毫。大王子见了，叫道：“兄弟，莫费力了。师父的兵器，俱是神兵，不知有多少重哩！”八戒笑道：</p>

<p>“我的钯也没多重，只有一藏之数，连柄五千零四十八斤。”三王子问沙僧道：“师父宝杖多重？”沙僧笑道：“也是五千零四十八斤。”大王子求行者的金箍棒看。行者去耳朵里取出一个针儿来，迎风幌一幌，就有碗来粗细，直直的竖立面前。那王父子都皆悚惧，众官员个个心惊。三个小王子礼拜道：“猪师、沙师之兵，俱随身带在衣下，即可取之。孙师为何自耳中取出？见风即长，何也？”行者笑道：“你不知我这棒不是凡间等闲可有者。这棒是：鸿蒙初判陶镕铁，大禹神人亲所设。湖海江河浅共深，曾将此棒知之切。开山治水太平时，流落东洋镇海阙。日久年深放彩霞，能消能长能光洁。老孙有分取将来，变化无方随口诀。要大弥于宇宙间，要小却似针儿节。棒名如意号金箍，天上人间称一绝。重该一万三千五百斤，或粗或细能生灭。也曾助我闹天宫，也曾随我攻地阙。伏虎降龙处处通，炼魔荡怪方方彻。举头一指太阳昏，天地鬼神皆胆怯。混沌仙传到至今，原来不是凡间铁。”那王子听言，个个顶礼不尽。三个向前重重拜礼，虔心求授，行者道：“你三人不知学那般武艺。”王子道：</p>

<p>“愿使棍的就学棍，惯使钯的就学钯，爱用杖的就学杖。”行者笑道：“教便也容易，只是你等无力量，使不得我们的兵器，恐学之不精，如画虎不成反类狗也。古人云，教训不严师之惰，学问无成子之罪。汝等既有诚心，可去焚香来拜了天地，我先传你些神力，然后可授武艺。”三个小王子闻言，满心欢喜，即便亲抬香案，沐手焚香，朝天礼拜。拜毕请师传法，行者转下身来，对唐僧行礼道：“告尊师，恕弟子之罪。自当年在两界山蒙师父大德救脱弟子，秉教沙门，一向西来，虽不曾重报师恩，却也曾渡水登山，竭尽心力。今来佛国之乡，幸遇贤王三子，投拜我等，欲学武艺。彼既为我等之徒弟，即为我师之徒孙也。谨禀过我师，庶好传授。”三藏十分大喜。八戒、沙僧见行者行礼，也那转身朝三藏磕头道：“师父，我等愚鲁，拙口钝腮，不会说话，望师父高坐法位，也让我两个各招个徒弟耍耍，也是西方路上之忆念。”三藏俱欣然允之。</p>

<p>行者才教三个王子就于暴纱亭后，静室之间，画了罡斗，教三人都俯伏在内，一个个瞑目宁神。这里却暗暗念动真言，诵动咒语，将仙气吹入他三人心腹之中，把元神收归本舍，传与口诀，各授得万千之膂力，运添了火候，却象个脱胎换骨之法。运遍了子午周天，那三个小王子，方才苏醒，一齐爬将起来，抹抹脸，精神抖擞，一个个骨壮筋强：大王子就拿得金箍棒，二王子就轮得九齿钯，三王子就举得降妖杖。老王见了欢喜不胜，又排素宴，启谢他师徒四众。就在筵前各传各授：学棍的演棍，学钯的演钯，学杖的演杖。虽然打几个转身，丢几般解数，终是有些着力，走一路，便喘气嘘嘘，不能耐久；盖他那兵器都有变化，其进退攻扬，随消随长，皆有变化自然之妙，此等终是凡夫，岂能以遽及也？当日散了筵宴。</p>

<p>次日，三个王子又来称谢道：“感蒙神师授赐了膂力，纵然轮得师的神器，只是转换艰难。意欲命工匠依师神器式样，减削斤两，打造一般，未知师父肯容否？”八戒道：“好！好！好！说得象话。我们的器械，一则你们使不得，二则我们要护法降魔，正该另造另造。”王子又随宣召铁匠，买办钢铁万斤，就于王府内前院搭厂，支炉铸造。先一日将钢铁炼熟，次日请行者三人将金箍棒、九齿钯、降妖杖，都取出放在篷厂之间，看样造作，遂此昼夜不收。</p>

<p>噫！这兵器原是他们随身之宝，一刻不可离者，各藏在身，自有许多光彩护体。今放在厂院中几日，那霞光有万道冲天，瑞气有千般罩地。其夜有一妖精，离城只有七十里远近，山唤豹头山，洞唤虎口洞，夜坐之间，忽见霞光瑞气，即驾云头而看。原是州城之光彩，他按下云来近前观看，乃是这三般兵器放光。妖精又喜又爱道：“好宝贝！好宝贝！这是甚人用的，今放在此？也是我的缘法，拿了去呀！拿了去呀！”他爱心一动，弄起威风，将三般兵器，一股收之，径转本洞。正是那：道不须臾离，可离非道也。神兵尽落空，枉费参修者。毕竟不知怎生寻得这兵器，且听下回分解。</p>
