<P>Sanzang's Way Is Blocked at the Fiery Mountains</P>
<P>Monkey First Tries to Borrow the Plantain Fan</P>
</div>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The many species are at root the same;</P>
<P>All flows into the boundless sea.</P>
<P>Every thought and worry is in vain;</P>
<P>All types and forms together blend.</P>
<P>When the achievement is complete</P>
<P>Great will be the full and shining dharma.</P>
<P>Do not allow your differences to divide:</P>
<P>Keep everything together.</P>
<P>Gather all into the elixir furnace,</P>
<P>Refine it till it is red as darkest gold.</P>
<P>Then in its brilliance and beauty</P>
<P>On dragons it may ride at will.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story tells how Sanzang took back Brother Monkey as the Bodhisattva had instructed him and headed towards the Western Heaven, united in heart with Pig and Friar Sand. They were no longer in two minds, and the ape and the horse were firmly under control. Time shot by like an arrow; days and nights alternated with the speed of a shuttle. After the scorching heat of summer they were now in the frosts of late autumn. What they saw was:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The sparse clouds blown away by the wild West wind,</P>
<P>Cranes calling in the distant hills amid the frosty woods.</P>
<P>This is a chilly time</P>
<P>When mountain rivers seem longer than ever.</P>
<P>The swan returns through the Northern frontier passes;</P>
<P>Migrating birds go back to their Southern fields.</P>
<P>The traveler feels lonely on the road;</P>
<P>Monastic robes do not keep out the cold.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As master and disciples pressed ahead they began to feel hotter and hotter in the warm air. &#8220;It is autumn now, so why is it getting hotter again?&#8221; Sanzang asked, reining in his horse.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't know,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;There's a country in the West, Sihali, where the sun sets. People call it 'the end of the sky'. At about six o'clock every evening the king sends people on the city walls to band drums and blow bugles to cover the sound of the sea boiling. That's because when the fire of the sun falls into the Western Ocean there's a great seething noise like something burning being plunged into water. If they didn't cover the noise with their drums and bugles the shock would kill all the little children in the city. That's where I think we are&#8212;the place where the sun sets.&#8221; When the Great Sage heard this he could not help laughing.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't talk such nonsense, you idiot. We're a long way from Sihali yet. The way our master keeps dithering and changing his mind we won't get there in three lifetimes, even if we go on from childhood to old age, then to childhood again, and then to another old age and a third childhood.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Tell me then, brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;if this isn't where the sun sets why's it so scorching hot?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The seasons must be out of joint,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;I expect they're following summer rituals here although it's autumn.&#8221; Just as the three disciples were arguing they saw a farm by the side of the road. It had a red tiled roof, red brick walls, and red painted doors, windows and furniture. It was red everywhere.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said Sanzang, dismounting, &#8220;go to that house and find out why it's so burning hot.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Great Sage put his gold-banded cudgel away, neatened his clothes, and swaggered along the road like a fine gentleman. When he reached the gate to have a look an old man suddenly appeared from inside. This is what he looked like:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He wore a robe of hemp-cloth,</P>
<P>Not quite brown or red,</P>
<P>A sunhat of woven bamboo,</P>
<P>In between black and green.</P>
<P>The knobby stick in his hand</P>
<P>Was neither crooked nor straight.</P>
<P>His long boots of leather</P>
<P>Were not new, but not yet old.</P>
<P>His face was the color of copper,</P>
<P>His beard bleached white like yarn.</P>
<P>Long eyebrows shaded his jade-blue eyes</P>
<P>And his smile showed golden teeth.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The old man had a shock when he looked up to see Monkey. &#8220;Where are you from, you freak?&#8221; he asked, steadying himself on his stick. &#8220;What are you doing at my gate?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Venerable patron,&#8221; replied Monkey with a bow, &#8220;don't be afraid. I'm no freak. My master and we three disciples have been sent by the Great Tang emperor in the East to fetch the scriptures from the West. As we've now reached your residence I have come to ask you why it's so boiling hot here and what this place is called.&#8221;</P>
<P>Only then did the old man stop feeling worried and reply with a smile, &#8220;Please don't take offence, reverend sir. My old eyes are rather dim and I failed to recognize your distinguished self.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no need to be so polite,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Which road is your master on?&#8221; the old man asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;That's him, standing on the main road due South,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Ask him over, ask him over,&#8221; the old man replied, to Monkey's pleasure. Monkey waved to them, and Sanzang came over with Pig and Friar Sand leading the white horse and carrying the luggage. They all bowed to the old man.</P>
<P>The old man was at the same time delighted by Sanzang's fine appearance and alarmed by Pig's and Friar Sand's remarkable ugliness. Inviting them in, he told the younger members of the family to bring tea and cook a meal. Hearing all this Sanzang rose to his feet to thank the old man and ask, &#8220;Could you tell me, sir, why it has turned so hot again although it is autumn now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;These are the Fiery Mountains,&#8221; the old man replied. &#8220;We don't have springs or autumns here. It's hot all the year round.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are the mountains?&#8221; Sanzang asked. &#8220;Do they block the way to the West?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's impossible to get to the West,&#8221; the old man replied. &#8220;The mountains are about twenty miles from here. You have to cross them to get to the West, but they're over 250 miles of flame. Not a blade of grass can grow anywhere around. Even if you had a skull of bronze and a body of iron you would melt trying to cross them.&#8221; This answer made Sanzang turn pale with horror; he dared not to ask any more questions.</P>
<P>Just then a young man pushing a red barrow stopped by the gate, shouting, &#8220;Cakes! Cakes!&#8221; The Great Sage pulled out one of his hairs and turned it into a copper coin with which he bought a cake off the young man. The man accepted the money and without a worry he lifted the cover off his barrow to release a cloud of hot steam, took out a cake and passed it to Monkey. When Monkey took it in his hand it was as hot as a burning coal or a red-hot nail in a furnace.</P>
<P>Just look at him as he keeps tossing the cake from one hand to another shouting, &#8220;It's hot, it's hot, I can't eat it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you can't stand heat don't come here,&#8221; the young man replied. &#8220;It's always this hot here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't understand at all, my lad,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;As the saying goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If it's never too cold and it's never too hot</P>
<P>The five kinds of grain will be harvested not.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;If it's so hot here how do you get the flour to make your cakes?&#8221; To this the young man said,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;You ask me where we can obtain the flour for the pan:</P>
<P>Politely we request it from Immortal Iron Fan.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;What can you tell me about this immortal?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The immortal has a plantain fan,&#8221; the young man replied. &#8220;If you ask it to, the fan puts out the fire at the first wave, makes a wind blow at the second wave, and brings rain at the third wave. That is how we can sow and reap the crops to support ourselves. Without it nothing would be able to grow.&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing this Monkey rushed back inside, gave the cakes to Sanzang, and said, &#8220;Don't worry, Master: Don't get upset about what's going to happen the year after next. East these cakes up and I'll tell you all about it.&#8221; Sanzang took the cakes and said to the old man, &#8220;Please have a cake, sir.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I could not possibly eat one of your cakes before we've offered you any of our tea and food,&#8221; the old man replied. &#8220;Sir,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;there's no need to give us food or tea. But could you tell me where the Iron Fan Immortal lives?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you want to know about the immortal for?&#8221; the old man asked. &#8220;The cake-seller told me just now that the immortal has a plantain fan,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;If you borrow it the first wave puts the fire out, the second raises a wind and the third brings rain. That's why you're able to sow and reap the crops to support yourselves. I want to go to ask the immortal to come so we can put out the flames on the Fiery Mountains and cross them. And you'll be able to sow, reap and live in peace.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's a nice idea,&#8221; said the old man, &#8220;but as you have no presents the immortal wouldn't come.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What sort of presents would be wanted?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Every ten years,&#8221; the old man replied, &#8220;we go to visit the immortal. We take four pigs and four sheep, all decorated with flowers and red ribbons, delicious fruit in season, chickens, geese and the best wine. We bathe ourselves and go very reverently to pay a respectful visit to the mountain and ask the immortal to leave the cave and come here to perform magic.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where is this mountain?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;What's it called? How far is it from here? I'm going there to ask for the fan.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It lies Southwest of here,&#8221; the old man said, &#8220;and it's called Mount Turquoise Cloud. When we believers go to worship at the magic mountain the journey takes us a month as it's about 485 miles altogether.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No problem,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I can be there and back in no time.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wait a minute,&#8221; said the old man. &#8220;Have something to eat and drink first, and we'll get some provisions ready for the journey. You'll need two people to go with you. Nobody lives along the way and there are many wolves and tigers. It'll take you many a day to get there. You must be serious about it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No need,&#8221; said Monkey with a laugh, &#8220;no need. I'm off.&#8221; As soon as he had said that he disappeared.</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord!&#8221; the old man said in astonishment. &#8220;He's a god who can ride clouds.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We shall say no more of how the family redoubled their offerings to the Tang Priest, but tell of Monkey, who arrived at Mount Turquoise Cloud in an instant, brought his auspicious light to a stop and started looking for the entrance to the cave. He heard the sound of an axe and saw a woodcutter felling a tree in the forest on the mountainside. Hurrying forward, Monkey heard him saying.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;I recognize the ancient woods amid the clouds;</P>
<P>The path is overgrown; the hillside steep.</P>
<P>From Western hills I see the morning rain;</P>
<P>Returning to the South the ford's too deep.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Going closer to the woodman Monkey said, &#8220;Greetings, woodman.&#8221; Putting down his axe the woodcutter returned his courtesy and asked him where he was going. &#8220;May I ask if this is Mount Turquoise Cloud?&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the woodcutter replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where is the Iron Fan Immortal's Plantain Cave?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;There's a Plantain Cave here,&#8221; the woodcutter replied, &#8220;but no Iron Fan Immortal, only a Princess Iron Fan. She's also called Raksasi.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They say the immortal has a plantain fan that can put out the flames of the Fiery Mountains. Is that her?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; the woodman said. &#8220;She's a sage and she has this treasure that puts out fire. Because she protects the people who live over yonder they call her the Iron Fan Immortal. We have no need of her here, so we just call her Raksasi. She's the wife of the Bull Demon King.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey went pale with shock at the news. &#8220;Another person who's got it in for me,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;When I subdued the Red Boy the other year he said this bitch was his mother. When I met the Red Boy's uncle at Childfree Cave on Mount Offspring Dissolved he refused me the water and wanted revenge. Now I'm up against his parents. How am I ever going to borrow the fan?&#8221;</P>
<P>Seeing Monkey deep in thought and sighing endlessly, the woodcutter said with a smile, &#8220;Venerable sir, you're a man of religion. You shouldn't have any worries. Just follow this path East and you'll be at the Plantain Cave within a couple of miles.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll be frank with you, woodcutter,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'm the senior disciple of the Tang Priest who has been sent by the Tang emperor in the East to go to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven. The other year I had words with Raksasi's son Red Boy at the Fire-cloud Cave, and I'm afraid that Raksasi may refuse to let me have the fan because she's still nursing a grudge. That's why I'm worried.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;A real man knows how to play it by ear,&#8221; the woodcutter replied. &#8220;Just ask for the fan. Forget about your old quarrel. I'm sure you'll be able to borrow it.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey made a respectful chant and said, &#8220;Thank you very much for your advice. I'm off.&#8221;</P>
<P>Brother Monkey then took his leave of the woodcutter and went straight to the mouth of the Plantain Cave. Both doors were tightly shut, and the scenery outside was magnificent. It was a splendid place. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The rocks were the hones of the mountain,</P>
<P>And also the spirit of the earth.</P>
<P>Clouds at sunset held night rain,</P>
<P>And mosses lent the freshness of their green.</P>
<P>The towering peaks outdid those of Penglai;</P>
<P>The fragrant calm was like a magic island's.</P>
<P>Wild cranes were perching in the lofty pines</P>
<P>While warblers sang in the weeping willows.</P>
<P>This was indeed an ancient site,</P>
<P>The home of immortals for ten thousand years.</P>
<P>The resplendent phoenix sang in the parasol trees</P>
<P>While azure dragons hid in the running waters.</P>
<P>Vines hung over the winding paths,</P>
<P>And creepers covered the steps of stone.</P>
<P>Apes on the cliffs screeched to welcome the rising moon;</P>
<P>In tall trees birds sang for joy at the clear blue sky.</P>
<P>The groves of bamboo were as cool as if it had rained;</P>
<P>The flowers along the path were embroidered velvet.</P>
<P>At times a cloud of white would blow from a distant peak;</P>
<P>It had no single form as it drifted in the wind.</P>
<P>&#8220;Open up, Brother Bull,&#8221; Monkey shouted as he went up to the doors. They opened with a creak, and out came a young girl carrying a flower basket in her hand and hoe over her shoulder. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Though clad in rags and dressed in no fine array,</P>
<P>Her face was full of spirit, her heart set on the Way.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey went up to her with his hands together in front of his chest and said, &#8220;Would you kindly tell the princess that I'm a monk going to the West to fetch the scriptures. I'm here to beg the loan of her plantain fan as we can't get across the Fiery Mountains.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What monastery are you from,&#8221; the girl asked, &#8220;and what is your name? Please tell me so that I can announce you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm from the East,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and my name is Sun Wukong.&#8221;</P>
<P>The girl went back into the cave, knelt to the princess, and said, &#8220;Your Highness, there's a monk from the East called Sun Wukong outside who would like to see you to ask for the loan of the plantain fan to cross the Fiery Mountains.&#8221; The name Sun Wukong was like a pinch of salt thrown into a flame, or oil poured on a fire. Her face went bright red and evil anger flared up in her heart.</P>
<P>&#8220;So that damned monkey's here at last,&#8221; she said with hatred. &#8220;Girl,&#8221; she shouted, &#8220;fetch me my armor and my weapons.&#8221; She then put on her armor, tied her pair of blue-tipped swords at her waist, fastened it all firmly, and went out. Monkey slipped over to the entrance to see what she looked like and this is what he saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A flowered kerchief tied around her head,</P>
<P>A cloud-patterned robe of quilted brocade.</P>
<P>A belt of two tiger sinews round her waist,</P>
<P>Revealing a skirt of embroidered silk.</P>
<P>Her shoes like phoenix beaks were but three inches long;</P>
<P>Her trousers in dragon-beard style were adorned with gold.</P>
<P>Brandishing her swords she gave out angry shouts;</P>
<P>She looked as lethal as the goddess of the moon.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where's Sun Wukong?&#8221; Raksasi shouted as she came out of her cave.</P>
<P>Monkey stepped forward, bowed, and replied, &#8220;Monkey offers his respectful greetings, sister-in-law.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm no sister-in-law of yours,&#8221; she shouted angrily, &#8220;and I'll have no greetings from you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your worthy husband the Bull Demon King was once my sworn brother,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;There were seven of us altogether. As I learn that you are my brother Bull's good lady, of course I must call you sister-in-law.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Damned ape,&#8221; said Raksasi, &#8220;if you're my husband's sworn brother why did you have to do that terrible thing to our boy?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Who is your son?&#8221; Monkey asked, as if he did not know.</P>
<P>&#8220;He's the Red Boy, the Boy Sage King of the Fire-cloud Cave by Withered Pine Ravine on Mount Hao,&#8221; Raksasi replied. &#8220;You ruined him, and now you've come to our door to pay with your life. We've been longing to get our revenge on you but didn't know where to find you. You'll get no mercy from me.&#8221;</P>
<P>Putting on the broadest of smiles, Monkey replied, &#8220;You haven't gone into it thoroughly enough, sister-in-law. You've no reason to be so angry with me Your good son had captured my master and would have steamed or boiled him if the Bodhisattva hadn't taken the boy as his disciple and rescued my master. He's now the page Sudhana on the Bodhisattva's island and he's accepted the pursuit of the true reward from her. He is now beyond life and death and above filth and purity. He will live as long as heaven, earth, the sun and the moon. But far from thanking me for saving his life you're getting angry at me. That's wrong of you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You smooth-tongued ape,&#8221; Raksasi snapped back. &#8220;My boy may be alive, but when is he ever going to come here? When am I going to see him again?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It'll be easy for you to see your son again,&#8221; Monkey replied, still smiling. &#8220;Just lend me the fan to put the fires out. When I've taken my master across the mountains I'll go to the Bodhisattava's place in the Southern Ocean and ask him to come here to see you and give your fan back. No problem. Then you'll be able to see that he's completely unharmed. If he'd been wounded at all you'd have had every right to be angry with me. But he's as handsome as ever. You ought to be thanking me.&#8221;</P>
<P>To this Raksasi's reply was: &#8220;Shut up, ape fiend! Stick your head out for me to hack with my sword. If you can stand the pain I'll lend you the plantain fan. If you can't you'll be going straight down to Hell to see King Yama.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey then clasped his hands together in front of him and replied with a smile, &#8220;Enough said, sister-in-law. I'll stretch my bald head out and you can take as many hacks as you like until you're exhausted. But you must lend me the fan.&#8221; With no more argument Raksasi swung both of her swords around and brought them down with loud thunks a dozen or more times on Monkey's head. He was not bothered at all. Raksasi was so frightened by this that she turned to run away.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you going, sister-in-law?&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;Hurry up and lend me that fan.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My treasure isn't something to be lent out casually,&#8221; Raksasi replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;if you refuse now you'll just have to try a taste of your brother-in-law's cudgel.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Monkey King held on to her with one hand while pulling his cudgel out from his ear with the other. With one wave it became as thick as a ricebowl. Raksasi broke free from his grip and raised her swords to strike back at him. Monkey started swinging his cudgel to hit her with and the fight began in front of Mount Turquoise Cloud. All talk of kinship was forgotten and their minds full of hatred alone. It was a fine battle:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The woman had worked hard to make herself a monster;</P>
<P>She loathed the ape and would avenge her son.</P>
<P>Although Monkey was seething with fury,</P>
<P>He would have made concessions for his master's sake.</P>
<P>First he had asked to borrow the plantain fan,</P>
<P>Being patient and gentle, not fierce.</P>
<P>In ignorance Raksasi hacked with her sword,</P>
<P>While Monkey decided to speak of kinship.</P>
<P>Women should never fight with men,</P>
<P>For men are harder and can crush them.</P>
<P>Terrible was the gold-banded cudgel,</P>
<P>Fine were the movements of the blue frost-bladed sword,</P>
<P>With blows to face and head,</P>
<P>As both of them grimly refused to yield.</P>
<P>Blocking to left and right they used their martial skill;</P>
<P>Great was the cunning with which they stood or fell back.</P>
<P>Just when they both were beginning to enjoy themselves</P>
<P>The sun set in the Western sky before they noticed.</P>
<P>Raksasi made ghosts and deities feel small</P>
<P>With many a wave of her true magic fan.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Raksasi and Monkey fought it out till evening. As Monkey's cudgel struck so hard and his technique was so flawless she realized that she would never be able to beat him. She brought out her plantain fan and with a single wave blew Monkey right out of sight. There was no way he could stand his ground. With that she went back to her cave in triumph.</P>
<P>The Great Sage was thrown around in the air, unable to come down to earth or find any refuge. He was like a dead leaf in a whirlwind or a fallen blossom carried along by a torrent.</P>
<P>Only after a whole night's buffeting did he manage to land on a mountain the next morning and hold on hard to a rock by putting both arms round it. He needed a long time to calm himself and take a good look around before he realized that he was on Little Mount Sumeru.</P>
<P>&#8220;What a terrible woman,&#8221; he said to himself with a deep sigh. &#8220;How ever did she get me here? I remember coming here once to ask the Bodhisattva Lingji to subdue the Yellow Wind Monster and rescue my master. The Yellow Wind Ridge is over a thousand miles South of here, so as I've been blown back from the West I must have come thousands and thousands of miles. I'll go down and find out some more from the Bodhisattva Lingji before I go back.&#8221;</P>
<P>Just as he was making his mind up he heard a resounding gong, so he hurried down the mountain and straight to the dhyana monastery. The lay brother on the gate recognized Monkey and went in to announce, &#8220;The hairy-faced Great Sage who asked the Bodhisattva to subdue the Yellow Wind Monster some years back is here again.&#8221;</P>
<P>Realizing that this must be Sun Wukong, the Bodhisattva hurried down from his throne to greet him and lead him inside with the words, &#8220;Allow me to congratulate you. I suppose you have fetched the scriptures now.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It'll be a long time yet,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;a long time.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But why are you visiting my mountain if you have yet to reach the Thunder Monastery?&#8221; the Bodhisattva asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Since in your great kindness you subdued the Yellow Wind Monster for me some years ago,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;goodness only knows how much we've suffered on our journey. Now we are at the Fiery Mountains, but we can't cross them. When I asked the local people they told me about an Iron Fan Immortal who had an iron fan that could put the fires out. I went to visit the immortal, only to discover that she's the wife of the Bull Demon King and the Red Boy's mother. I told her that her son is now Guanyin Bodhisattva's page, but she has it in for me because she can't see him. She refused to lend me her fan and fought me. When she realized that my cudgel was too much for her she waved her fan and sent me hurling through the air till I landed here. That's why I've come blundering into your monastery to ask the way back. How far is it from here to the Fiery Mountains?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The woman is called Raksasi, or Princess Iron Fan,&#8221; replied Lingji with a smile. &#8220;That plantain fan of hers is a miraculous treasure formed by heaven and earth behind Mount Kunlun ever since primal chaos was first separated. This leaf is the very essence of the negative Yin principle, which is why it can put out fire. If she fans somebody with it he'll be blown 27,000 miles before that negative wind drops. But this mountain of mine is only some 17,000 miles from the Fiery Mountains. You must have stopped here because you have the power to delay clouds, Great Sage. No ordinary mortal would have been able to stop.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;She's terrible,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;How ever is my master going to get across those mountains?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry, Great Sage,&#8221; Lingji replied. &#8220;The Tang Priest is fated to succeed on this journey with you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you tell?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;Many years age when the Tathagata gave me his instructions,&#8221; Lingji replied, &#8220;he presented me with a Wind-fixing Pill and a Flying Dragon Staff. The Flying Dragon Staff was used to subdue the Yellow Wind Monster, but I haven't yet tried out the Wind-fixing Pill and I'll give it to you today. It'll stop the fan from being able to move you. You'll just have to ask to get it and put the fire out with it. You'll have an instant success.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey bowed deeply and expressed profound thanks. The Bodhisattva then produced a brocade bag from his sleeve and took out of it the Wind-fixing Pill. This he gave to Monkey to sew up securely inside the lapel of his tunic. &#8220;I won't detain you here any longer,&#8221; Lingji said as he saw Monkey out through doors. &#8220;Head Northwest and that will get you to Raksasi's mountain.&#8221;</P>
<P>Taking his leave of Lingji Monkey rode his somersault cloud straight back to Mount Turquoise Cloud and was there in a moment. &#8220;Open up, open up!&#8221; he shouted, hammering on the doors with his iron cudgel. &#8220;Monkey's here to borrow the fan.&#8221;</P>
<P>This so alarmed the servant girl inside the doors that she ran back and reported, &#8220;Your Highness, he's here to borrow the fan again.&#8221; The news frightened Raksasi, who thought, &#8220;That damned monkey really has got some powers. If I fan anyone else with my treasure they go 27,000 miles before stopping. How can he be back so soon after being blown away? This time I'll fan him two or three times and he'll never be able to find his way back here.&#8221;</P>
<P>She sprang to her feet, tied all her armor firmly on, and went out of the cave with her swords in her hands shouting, &#8220;Sun the Novice, aren't you afraid of me? Why have you come back here to get yourself killed?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be so stingy, sister-in-law,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile. &#8220;You've got to lend me it. I'll bring it back as soon as I've escorted the Tang Priest across the Fiery Mountains. I give you my word as a gentleman. I'm not the sort of low creature who borrows things but doesn't give them back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Damned macaque,&#8221; Raksasi shouted back. &#8220;You're outrageous, and you understand nothing. I've got to avenge the loss of my son, so how could I possibly be prepared to lend you my fan? Clear off if you don't want a taste of my sword.&#8221; The Great Sage, not at all afraid, struck back at her hands with his iron cudgel, and the two of them fought six or seven rounds. By then Raksasi's arms were becoming too tired to wield the swords, while Brother Monkey was feeling strong and fighting well. Seeing that the balance of the fight was tilting against her, Raksasi took out the fan and fanned it once in Monkey's direction.</P>
<P>He stood unmoved, put his iron cudgel away, and said with a chuckle, &#8220;This time it's different. Fan as much as you like. If I move an inch I'm no man.&#8221; She fanned twice more and still he did not move. By now she was so alarmed that she put her pride and joy away at once, went straight back into the cave, and shut the doors firmly.</P>
<P>When Monkey saw this he used magic. He tore the lapel of his tunic open, put the Wind-fixing Pill in his mouth, shook himself, turned into the tiniest of insects, and squeezed in through the crack between the doors, where he saw Raksasi shouting, &#8220;I'm thirsty, I'm thirsty. Quick, bring me some tea.&#8221; The servant girl who attended her fetched a pot of the best tea and poured a large cup of it so noisily that the surface was frothy. Monkey was delighted. With a quiet buzz of his wings he flew under the froth. Raksasi was so parched that she drained the tea in two gulps.</P>
<P>Once inside her stomach Monkey reverted to his own form and shouted at the top of his voice, &#8220;Sister-in-law, lend me the fan.&#8221;</P>
<P>Raksasi went pale with shock. &#8220;Little ones,&#8221; she called to her underlings, &#8220;are the front doors shut?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; they all said.</P>
<P>&#8220;If the doors are shut then how can Sun the Novice be inside the cave and shouting?&#8221; she asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;He's shouting from inside you,&#8221; the servant girl replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you playing your conjuring tricks, Sun the Novice?&#8221; Raksasi asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I've never been able to do conjuring tricks in all my life,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;My magic and my powers are all real. I'm fooling around in your own in-sides, good sister-in-law. I've just seen your lungs and your liver. I know you're very hungry and thirsty, so I'll give you a bowlful to quench your thirst.&#8221; With that he stamped his foot, giving Raksasi an unbearable cramp in her stomach that left her sitting groaning on the floor. &#8220;Don't try to say no, sister-in-law,&#8221; Monkey then said. &#8220;I'm giving you a pastry in case you're hungry.&#8221; He butted upwards, causing such a violent heart pain that she could only roll around on the ground, her face sallow and her lips white from agony.</P>
<P>&#8220;Spare me, brother-in-law, spare me,&#8221; was all she could say.</P>
<P>Only then did Monkey stop hitting and kicking. &#8220;So you call me brother-in-law now, do you?&#8221; he said. &#8220;I'll spare your life for my brother Bull's sake. Get me the fan, and quick.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You shall have it, brother-in-law, you shall have it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Come out and get it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Fetch it and show it to me,&#8221; Monkey said. She told the servant girl to fetch a plantain fan and stand holding it beside her. Monkey poked his head up her throat to see it and said, &#8220;As I'm sparing your life, sister-in-law, I won't smash my way out under your ribs. I'll come out through your mouth. Open wide three times.&#8221; With that Raksasi opened her mouth and Monkey turned back into the tiny insect to fly out and alight on the fan. Not realizing what had happened Raksasi went on to open her mouth twice more.</P>
<P>&#8220;Come out, brother-in-law,&#8221; she said.</P>
<P>Monkey turned back into himself, took the fan and said, &#8220;Here I am. Thanks for the loan.&#8221; With that he strode forward while the underlings opened the doors to let him out of the cave.</P>
<P>The Great Sage then turned his cloud around and headed back East. A moment later he had landed the cloud and was standing by the red brick wall. Pig was very pleased indeed to see him. &#8220;Master,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Monkey's here! He's back!&#8221; Sanzang went out with the old man of the farm and Friar Sand to greet him, and they all went back inside.</P>
<P>Propping the fan against the wall, Monkey asked, &#8220;Tell me sir, is this the fan?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; the old man said.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is a great achievement, disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;Fetching this treasure must have cost you a great deal of trouble.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No trouble at all,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Do you know who that Iron Fan Immortal is? She's Raksasi, the wife of the Bull Demon King and the Red Boy's mother. Her other name is Princess Iron Fan. I found her outside her cave and asked to borrow the fan, but all she could talk of were her old grudges. She took a few cuts at me with her swords, but when I gave her a bit of a scare with the cudgel she fanned me with the fan and blew me all the way to Little Mount Sumeru. I was lucky enough to be able to see the Bodhisattva Lingji who gave me a tablet that stops winds and showed me the way back to Mount Turquoise Cloud. Then I saw Raksasi again, but this time her fan did not move me an inch, so she went back into her cave and I turned into a tiny insect to fly back in after her. When the damned woman-asked for some tea I slipped in under the froth at the top, got inside her, and started giving her a few punches and kicks. She couldn't take the pain. She kept saying, 'Spare me, brother-in-law, spare me.' As she agreed to lend me the fan I spared her life and took the fan. I'll give it back to her after we've crossed the Fiery Mountains.&#8221; When Sanzang heard this he was extremely grateful.</P>
<P>Master and disciples then took their leave of the old man and traveled about fifteen miles West. The heat was becoming unbearable. &#8220;The soles of my feet are being roasted,&#8221; Friar Sand complained.</P>
<P>&#8220;My trotters are getting burnt and it hurts,&#8221; said Pig. The horse was going much faster than usual too. The ground was so hot that they could not stop, but every step was painful.</P>
<P>&#8220;Please dismount, Master,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;and brothers, stay here while I use the fan to put the fire out. When the wind and the rain come the ground will be a lot cooler and we'll be able to get across the mountains.&#8221; He then raised the fan and fanned it hard once in the direction of the fire: tongues of flame rose above the mountains. He fanned again, and they were a hundred times as high. He fanned a third time, and now they were a couple of miles high and beginning to burn him. Monkey fled, but not before two patches of fur had been burnt away. He ran straight back to the Tang Priest and said, &#8220;Hurry back, hurry back, the flames are coming.&#8221;</P>
<P>The master remounted and headed back East with Pig and Friar Sand some seven miles before stopping and asking, &#8220;What happened, Wukong?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's the wrong one,&#8221; Monkey said, flinging the fan down, &#8220;it's the wrong one. The damned woman fooled me.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Sanzang heard this he frowned and felt thoroughly depressed. &#8220;What are we to do?&#8221; he sobbed, the tears flowing freely down his cheeks.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;why did you come back in such a mad rush and send us back here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The first time I fanned there were flames,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;the second time the fire got fiercer, and the third time the flames were a couple of miles high. If I hadn't run fast all my fur would have been burnt off.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But you're always telling us that you can't be hurt by thunder and lightning and that fire can't burn you,&#8221; said Pig with a laugh. &#8220;How come you're afraid of fire now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Idiot,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you don't understand anything. The other times I was ready: that's why I wasn't hurt. Today I didn't make any flame-avoiding spells or use magic to defend myself. That's why two patches of my fur were singed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If the fire's so fierce and there's no other way to the West what are we going to do?&#8221; Friar Sand asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;We'll just have to find somewhere where there isn't any fire,&#8221; Pig replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Which way will that be?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;East, North or South: there's no fire those ways,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;But which way are the scriptures?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Only in the West,&#8221; Pig replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;I only want to go where the scriptures are,&#8221; Sanzang said.</P>
<P>&#8220;We're well and truly struck,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;Where there are scriptures there's fire, and where there's no fire there are no scriptures.&#8221;</P>
<P>While master and disciples were talking this nonsense they heard someone call, &#8220;Don't get upset, Great Sage. Come and have some vegetarian food before you take your discussions any further.&#8221; The four of them looked round to see an old man wearing a cloak that floated in the wind and a hat the shape of a half moon. In his hand he held a dragon-headed stick, and on his legs were boots of iron. With him was a demon with the beak of an eagle and the cheeks of a fish carrying on his head a copper bowl full of steamed buns, millet cakes, cooked millet and rice.</P>
<P>The old man bowed to them on the road to the West and said, &#8220;I am the local god of the Fiery Mountains. As I know that you are escorting this holy monk, Great Sage, and can't go any further I have brought this meal as an offering.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Eating doesn't matter,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;When are these fires going to be put out so that my master can cross the mountains?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you want to put the fires out you must first ask Raksasi to lend you the plantain fan,&#8221; the local god said. Monkey went to the side of the path, picked the fan up, and said, &#8220;This is it, isn't it? The more I fan the flames the more fiercely they burn. Why?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Because it's not the real one,&#8221; said the local deity with a laugh when he looked at it. &#8220;She fooled you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Then how am I to get the real one?&#8221; Monkey said.</P>
<P>The local god bowed again and had a slight smile on his face as he replied, &#8220;If you want to borrow the real plantain fan you will have to ask the Strongarm King.&#8221;</P>
<P>If you don't know all about the Strongarm King listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>唐三藏路阻火焰山</p>
<p>孙行者一调芭蕉扇</p>
</div>
<p>若干种性本来同，海纳无穷。千思万虑终成妄，般般色色和融。有日功完行满，圆明法性高隆。休教差别走西东，紧锁牢靴。收来安放丹炉内，炼得金乌一样红。朗朗辉辉娇艳，任教出入乘龙。话表三藏遵菩萨教旨，收了行者，与八戒沙僧剪断二心，锁鑨猿马，同心戮力，赶奔西天。说不尽光阴似箭，日月如梭，历过了夏月炎天，却又值三秋霜景，但见那：薄云断绝西风紧，鹤鸣远岫霜林锦。光景正苍凉，山长水更长。征鸿来北塞，玄鸟归南陌。客路怯孤单，衲衣容易寒。师徒四众，进前行处，渐觉热气蒸人。三藏勒马道：“如今正是秋天，却怎返有热气？”八戒道：“原来不知，西方路上有个斯哈哩国，乃日落之处，俗呼为天尽头。若到申酉时，国王差人上城，擂鼓吹角，混杂海沸之严。日乃太阳真火，落于西海之间，如火淬水，接声滚沸；若无鼓角之声混耳，即振杀城中小儿。此地热气蒸人，想必到日落之处也。”大圣听说，忍不住笑道：“呆子莫乱谈！若论斯哈哩国，正好早哩。似师父朝三暮二的，这等担阁，就从小至老，老了又小，老小三生，也还不到。”八戒道：“哥啊，据你说，不是日落之处，为何这等酷热？”沙僧道：“想是天时不正，秋行夏令故也。”他三个正都争讲，只见那路旁有座庄院，乃是红瓦盖的房舍，红砖砌的垣墙，红油门扇，红漆板榻，一片都是红的。三藏下马道：“悟空，你去那人家问个消息，看那炎热之故何也。”</p>

<p>大圣收了金箍棒，整肃衣裳，扭捏作个斯文气象，绰下大路，径至门前观看。那门里忽然走出一个老者，但见他：穿一领黄不黄、红不红的葛布深衣，戴一顶青不青、皂不皂的篾丝凉帽。手中拄一根弯不弯、直不直、暴节竹杖，足下踏一双新不新、旧不旧、搫靸靴鞋。面似红铜，须如白练。两道寿眉遮碧眼，一张吮口露金牙。那老者猛抬头，看见行者，吃了一惊，拄着竹杖，喝道：“你是那里来的怪人？在我这门首何干？”行者答礼道：“老施主，休怕我，我不是甚么怪人，贫僧是东土大唐钦差上西方求经者。师徒四人，适至宝方，见天气蒸热，一则不解其故，二来不地知名，特拜问指教一二。”那老者却才放心，笑云：</p>

<p>“长老勿罪，我老汉一时眼花，不识尊颜。”行者道：“不敢。”老者又问：“令师在那条路上？”行者道：“那南首大路上立的不是！”老者教：“请来，请来。”行者欢喜，把手一招，三藏即同八戒、沙僧，牵白马，挑行李近前，都对老者作礼。老者见三藏丰姿标致，八戒沙僧相貌奇稀，又惊又喜，只得请入里坐，教小的们看茶，一壁厢办饭。三藏闻言，起身称谢道：“敢问公公，贵处遇秋，何返炎热？”老者道：“敝地唤做火焰山，无春无秋，四季皆热。”三藏道：“火焰山却在那边？可阻西去之路，老者道：“西方却去不得。那山离此有六十里远，正是西方必由之路，却有八百里火焰，四周围寸草不生。若过得山，就是铜脑盖，铁身躯，也要化成汁哩。”三藏闻言，大惊失色，不敢再问。</p>

<p>只见门外一个少年男子，推一辆红车儿，住在门旁，叫声“卖糕！”大圣拔根毫毛，变个铜钱，问那人买糕。那人接了钱，不论好歹，揭开车儿上衣裹，热气腾腾，拿出一块糕递与行者。</p>

<p>行者托在手中，好似火盆里的灼炭，煤炉内的红钉。你看他左手倒在右手，右手换在左手，只道：“热热热！难吃难吃！”那男子笑道：“怕热莫来这里，这里是这等热。”行者道：“你这汉子好不明理，常言道，不冷不热，五谷不结。他这等热得很，你这糕粉，自何而来？”那人道：“若知糕粉米，敬求铁扇仙。”行者道：“铁扇仙怎的？”那人道：“铁扇仙有柄芭蕉扇。求得来，一扇息火，二扇生风，三扇下雨，我们就布种，及时收割，故得五谷养生。不然，诚寸草不能生也。”行者闻言，急抽身走入里面，将糕递与三藏道：“师父放心，且莫隔年焦着，吃了糕，我与你说。”长老接糕在手，向本宅老者道：“公公请糕。”老者道：“我家的茶饭未奉，敢吃你糕？”行者笑道：“老人家，茶饭倒不必赐，我问你：铁扇仙在那里住？”老者道：“你问他怎的？”行者道：“适才那卖糕人说，此仙有柄芭蕉扇，求将来，一扇息火，二扇生风，三扇下雨，你这方布种收割，才得五谷养生。我欲寻他讨来扇息火焰山过去，且使这方依时收种，得安生也。”老者道：“固有此说。你们却无礼物，恐那圣贤不肯来也。”三藏道：</p>

<p>“他要甚礼物？”老者道：“我这里人家，十年拜求一度。四猪四羊，花红表里，异香时果，鸡鹅美酒，沐浴虔诚，拜到那仙山，请他出洞，至此施为。”行者道：“那山坐落何处？唤甚地名？有几多里数？等我问他要扇子去。”老者道：“那山在西南方，名唤翠云山。山中有一仙洞，名唤芭蕉洞。我这里众信人等去拜仙山，往回要走一月，计有一千四百五六十里。”行者笑道：“不打紧，就去就来。”那老者道：“且住，吃些茶饭，办些干粮，须得两人做伴。那路上没有人家，又多狼虎，非一日可到，莫当耍子。”行者笑道：“不用不用，我去也！”说一声，忽然不见。那老者慌张道：“爷爷呀！原来是腾云驾雾的神人也！”</p>

<p>且不说这家子供奉唐僧加倍，却说那行者霎时径到翠云山，按住祥光，正自找寻洞口，忽然闻得丁丁之声，乃是山林内一个樵夫伐木。行者即趋步至前，又闻得他道：“云际依依认旧林，断崖荒草路难寻。西山望见朝来雨，南涧归时渡处深。”行者近前作礼道：“樵哥，问讯了。”那樵子撇了柯斧，答礼道：“长老何往？”行者道：“敢问樵哥，这可是翠云山？”樵子道：“正是。”行者道：“有个铁扇仙的芭蕉洞，在何处？”樵子笑道：“这芭蕉洞虽有，却无个铁扇仙，只有个铁扇公主，又名罗刹女。”</p>

<p>行者道：“人言他有一柄芭蕉扇，能熄得火焰山，敢是他么？”樵子道：“正是正是，这圣贤有这件宝贝，善能熄火，保护那方人家，故此称为铁扇仙。我这里人家用不着他，只知他叫做罗刹女，乃大力牛魔王妻也。”行者闻言，大惊失色，心中暗想道：</p>

<p>“又是冤家了！当年伏了红孩儿，说是这厮养的。前在那解阳山破儿洞遇他叔子，尚且不肯与水，要作报仇之意，今又遇他父母，怎生借得这扇子耶？”樵子见行者沉思默虑，嗟叹不已，便笑道：“长老，你出家人，有何忧疑？这条小路儿向东去，不上五六里，就是芭蕉洞，休得心焦。”行者道：“不瞒樵哥说，我是东土唐朝差往西天求经的唐僧大徒弟。前年在火云洞，曾与罗刹之子红孩儿有些言语，但恐罗刹怀仇不与，故生忧疑。”樵子道：“大丈夫鉴貌辨色，只以求扇为名，莫认往时之溲话，管情借得。”行者闻言，深深唱个大喏道：“谢樵哥教诲，我去也。”</p>

<p>遂别了樵夫，径至芭蕉洞口，但见那两扇门紧闭牢关，洞外风光秀丽。好去处！正是那：山以石为骨，石作土之精。烟霞含宿润，苔藓助新青。嵯峨势耸欺蓬岛，幽静花香若海瀛。几树乔松栖野鹤，数株衰柳语山莺。诚然是千年古迹，万载仙踪。</p>

<p>碧梧鸣彩凤，活水隐苍龙。曲径荜萝垂挂，石梯藤葛攀笼。猿啸翠岩忻月上，鸟啼高树喜晴空。两林竹荫凉如雨，一径花浓没绣绒。时见白云来远岫，略无定体漫随风。行者上前叫：“牛大哥，开门！开门！”呀的一声，洞门开了，里边走出一个毛儿女，手中提着花篮，肩上担着锄子，真个是一身蓝缕无妆饰，满面精神有道心。行者上前迎着，合掌道：“女童，累你转报公主一声。我本是取经的和尚，在西方路上，难过火焰山，特来拜借芭蕉扇一用。”那毛女道：“你是那寺里和尚？叫甚名字？我好与你通报。”行者道：“我是东土来的，叫做孙悟空和尚。”</p>

<p>那毛女即便回身，转于洞内，对罗刹跪下道：“奶奶，洞门外有个东土来的孙悟空和尚，要见奶奶，拜求芭蕉扇，过火焰山一用。”那罗刹听见孙悟空三字，便以撮盐入火，火上浇油；</p>

<p>骨都都红生脸上，恶狠狠怒发心头，口中骂道：“这泼猴！今日来了！”叫：“丫鬟，取披挂，拿兵器来！”随即取了披挂，拿两口青锋宝剑，整束出来。行者在洞外闪过，偷看怎生打扮，只见他：头裹团花手帕，身穿纳锦云袍。腰间双束虎筋绦，微露绣裙偏绡。凤嘴弓鞋三寸，龙须膝裤金销。手提宝剑怒声高，凶比月婆容貌。那罗刹出门，高叫道：“孙悟空何在？”行者上前，躬身施礼道：“嫂嫂，老孙在此奉揖。”罗刹咄的一声道：“谁是你的嫂嫂！那个要你奉揖！”行者道：“尊府牛魔王，当初曾与老孙结义，乃七兄弟之亲。今闻公主是牛大哥令正，安得不以嫂嫂称之！”罗刹道：“你这泼猴！既有兄弟之亲，如何坑陷我子？”行者佯问道：“令郎是谁？”罗刹道：“我儿是号山枯松涧火云洞圣婴大王红孩儿，被你倾了。我们正没处寻你报仇，你今上门纳命，我肯饶你！”行者满脸陪笑道：“嫂嫂原来不察理，错怪了老孙。你令郎因是捉了师父，要蒸要煮，幸亏了观音菩萨收他去，救出我师。他如今现在菩萨处做善财童子，实受了菩萨正果，不生不灭，不垢不净，与天地同寿，日月同庚。你倒不谢老孙保命之恩，返怪老孙，是何道理！”罗刹道：“你这个巧嘴的泼猴！</p>

<p>我那儿虽不伤命，再怎生得到我的跟前，几时能见一面？”行者笑道：“嫂嫂要见令郎，有何难处？你且把扇子借我，扇息了火，送我师父过去，我就到南海菩萨处请他来见你，就送扇子还你，有何不可！那时节，你看他可曾损伤一毫？如有些须之伤，你也怪得有理，如比旧时标致，还当谢我。”罗刹道：“泼猴，少要饶舌！伸过头来，等我砍上几剑！若受得疼痛，就借扇子与你；若忍耐不得，教你早见阎君！”行者叉手向前，笑道：“嫂嫂切莫多言，老孙伸着光头，任尊意砍上多少，但没气力便罢，是必借扇子用用。”那罗刹不容分说，双手轮剑，照行者头上乒乒乓乓，砍有十数下，这行者全不认真。罗刹害怕，回头要走，行者道：“嫂嫂，那里去？快借我使使！”那罗刹道：“我的宝贝原不轻借。”行者道：“既不肯借，吃你老叔一棒！”好猴王，一只手扯住，一只手去耳内掣出棒来，幌一幌，有碗来粗细。那罗刹挣脱手，举剑来迎，行者随又轮棒便打。两个在翠云山前，不论亲情，却只讲仇隙。这一场好杀：裙钗本是修成怪，为子怀仇恨泼猴。行者虽然生狠怒，因师路阻让娥流。先言拜借芭蕉扇，不展骁雄耐性柔。罗刹无知轮剑砍，猴王有意说亲由。女流怎与男儿斗，到底男刚压女流。这个金箍铁棒多凶猛，那个霜刃青锋甚紧稠。劈面打，照头丢，恨苦相持不罢休。左挡右遮施武艺，前迎后架骋奇谋。却才斗到沉酣处，不觉西方坠日头。罗刹忙将真扇了，一扇挥动鬼神愁！那罗刹女与行者相持到晚，见行者棒重，却又解数周密，料斗他不过，即便取出芭蕉扇，幌一幌，一扇阴风，把行者扇得无影无形，莫想收留得住。这罗刹得胜回归。</p>

<p>那大圣飘飘荡荡，左沉不能落地，右坠不得存身，就如旋风翻败叶，流水淌残花，滚了一夜，直至天明，方才落在一座山上，双手抱住一块峰石。定性良久，仔细观看，却才认得是小须弥山。大圣长叹一声道：“好利害妇人！怎么就把老孙送到这里来了？我当年曾记得在此处告求灵吉菩萨降黄风怪救我师父。那黄风岭至此直南上有三千余里，今在西路转来，乃东南方隅，不知有几万里。等我下去问灵吉菩萨一个消息，好回旧路。”正踌躇间，又听得钟声响亮，急下山坡，径至禅院。那门前道人认得行者的形容，即入里面报道：“前年来请菩萨去降黄风怪的那个毛脸大圣又来了。”菩萨知是悟空，连忙下宝座相迎，入内施礼道：“恭喜！取经来耶？”悟空答道：“正好未到！早哩早哩！”灵吉道：“既未曾得到雷音，何以回顾荒山？”行者道：</p>

<p>“自上年蒙盛情降了黄风怪，一路上不知历过多少苦楚。今到火焰山，不能前进，询问土人，说有个铁扇仙芭蕉扇，扇得火灭，老孙特去寻访，原来那仙是牛魔王的妻，红孩儿的母。他说我把他儿子做了观音菩萨的童子，不得常见，跟我为仇，不肯借扇，与我争斗。他见我的棒重难撑，遂将扇子把我一扇，扇得我悠悠荡荡，直至于此，方才落住。故此轻造禅院，问个归路，此处到火焰山，不知有多少里数？”灵吉笑道：“那妇人唤名罗刹女，又叫做铁扇公主。他的那芭蕉扇本是昆仑山后，自混沌开辟以来，天地产成的一个灵宝，乃太阳之精叶，故能灭火气。</p>

<p>假若扇着人，要飘八万四千里，方息阴风。我这山到火焰山，只有五万余里，此还是大圣有留云之能，故止住了。若是凡人，正好不得住也。”行者道：“利害利害！我师父却怎生得度那方？”</p>

<p>灵吉道：“大圣放心，此一来，也是唐僧的缘法，合教大圣成功。”行者道：“怎见成功？”灵吉道：“我当年受如来教旨，赐我一粒定风丹，一柄飞龙杖。飞龙杖已降了风魔，这定风丹尚未曾见用，如今送了大圣，管教那厮扇你不动，你却要了扇子，扇息火，却不就立此功也？”行者低头作礼，感谢不尽。那菩萨即于衣袖中取出一个锦袋儿，将那一粒定风丹与行者安在衣领里边，将针线紧紧缝了，送行者出门道：“不及留款，往西北上去，就是罗刹的山场也。”</p>

<p>行者辞了灵吉，驾筋斗云，径返翠云山，顷刻而至，使铁棒打着洞门叫道：“开门！开门！老孙来借扇子使使哩！”慌得那门里女童即忙来报：“奶奶，借扇子的又来了！”罗刹闻言，心中悚惧道：“这泼猴真有本事！我的宝贝扇着人，要去八万四千里方能停止，他怎么才吹去就回来也？这番等我一连扇他两三扇，教他找不着归路！”急纵身，结束整齐，双手提剑，走出门来道：“孙行者！你不怕我，又来寻死！”行者笑道：“嫂嫂勿得悭吝，是必借我使使。保得唐僧过山，就送还你。我是个志诚有余的君子，不是那借物不还的小人。”罗刹又骂道：“泼猢狲！好没道理，没分晓！夺子之仇，尚未报得：借扇之意，岂得如心！你不要走！吃我老娘一剑！”大圣公然不惧，使铁棒劈手相迎。他两个往往来来，战经五七回合，罗刹女手软难轮，孙行者身强善敌。他见事势不谐，即取扇子，望行者扇了一扇，行者巍然不动。行者收了铁棒，笑吟吟的道：“这番不比那番！任你怎么搧来，老孙若动一动，就不算汉子！”那罗刹又搧两搧。果然不动。</p>

<p>罗刹慌了，急收宝贝，转回走入洞里，将门紧紧关上。</p>

<p>行者见他闭了门，却就弄个手段，拆开衣领，把定风丹噙在口中，摇身一变，变作一个蟭蟟虫儿，从他门隙处钻进。只见罗刹叫道：“渴了！渴了！快拿茶来！”近侍女童，即将香茶一壶，沙沙的满斟一碗，冲起茶沫漕漕。行者见了欢喜，嘤的一翅，飞在茶沫之下。那罗刹渴极，接过茶，两三气都喝了。行者已到他肚腹之内，现原身厉声高叫道：“嫂嫂，借扇子我使使！”罗刹大惊失色，叫：“小的们，关了前门否？”俱说：“关了。”他又说：</p>

<p>“既关了门，孙行者如何在家里叫唤？”女童道：“在你身上叫哩。”罗刹道：“孙行者，你在那里弄术哩？”行者道：“老孙一生不会弄术，都是些真手段，实本事，已在尊嫂尊腹之内耍子，已见其肺肝矣。我知你也饥渴了，我先送你个坐碗儿解渴！”却就把脚往下一登。那罗刹小腹之中，疼痛难禁，坐于地下叫苦。行者道：“嫂嫂休得推辞，我再送你个点心充饥！”又把头往上一顶。那罗刹心痛难禁，只在地上打滚，疼得他面黄唇白，只叫“孙叔叔饶命！”行者却才收了手脚道：“你才认得叔叔么？我看牛大哥情上，且饶你性命，快将扇子拿来我使使。”罗刹道：“叔叔，有扇！有扇！你出来拿了去！”行者道：“拿扇子我看了出来。”罗刹即叫女童拿一柄芭蕉扇，执在旁边。行者探到喉咙之上见了道：“嫂嫂，我既饶你性命，不在腰肋之下搠个窟窿出来，还自口出。你把口张三张儿。”那罗刹果张开口。行者还作个蟭蟟虫，先飞出来，丁在芭蕉扇上。那罗刹不知，连张三次，叫：“叔叔出来罢。”行者化原身，拿了扇子，叫道：“我在此间不是？谢借了！谢借了！”拽开步，往前便走，小的们连忙开了门，放他出洞。</p>

<p>这大圣拨转云头，径回东路，霎时按落云头，立在红砖壁下。八戒见了欢喜道：“师父，师兄来了！来了！”三藏即与本庄老者同沙僧出门接着，同至舍内。把芭蕉扇靠在旁边道：“老官儿，可是这个扇子？”老者道：“正是！正是！”唐僧喜道：“贤徒有莫大之功，求此宝贝，甚劳苦了。”行者道：“劳苦倒也不说。那铁扇仙，你道是谁？那厮原来是牛魔王的妻，红孩儿的母，名唤罗刹女，又唤铁扇公主。我寻到洞外借扇，他就与我讲起仇隙，把我砍了几剑。是我使棒吓他，他就把扇子扇了我一下，飘飘荡荡，直刮到小须弥山。幸见灵吉菩萨，送了我一粒定风丹，指与归路，复至翠云山。又见罗刹女，罗刹女又使扇子，搧我不动，他就回洞。是老孙变作一个蟭蟟虫，飞入洞去。那厮正讨茶吃，是我又钻在茶沫之下，到他肚里，做起手脚。他疼痛难禁，不住口的叫我做叔叔饶命，情愿将扇借与我，我却饶了他，拿将扇来，待过了火焰山，仍送还他。”三藏闻言，感谢不尽，师徒们俱拜辞老者。</p>

<p>一路西来，约行有四十里远近，渐渐酷热蒸人。沙僧只叫：</p>

<p>“脚底烙得慌！”八戒又道：“爪子烫得痛！”马比寻常又快，只因地热难停，十分难进。行者道：“师父且请下马，兄弟们莫走，等我搧息了火，待风雨之后，地土冷些，再过山去。”行者果举扇，径至火边，尽力一扇，那山上火光烘烘腾起，再一扇，更着百倍，又一扇，那火足有千丈之高，渐渐烧着身体。行者急回，已将两股毫毛烧净，径跑至唐僧面前叫：“快回去，快回去！火来了，火来了！”那师父爬上马，与八戒沙僧，复东来有二十余里，方才歇下道：“悟空，如何了呀！”行者丢下扇子道：“不停当！不停当！被那厮哄了！”三藏听说，愁促眉尖，闷添心上，止不住两泪交流，只道：“怎生是好！”八戒道：“哥哥，你急急忙忙叫回去是怎么说？”行者道：“我将扇子搧了一下，火光烘烘；第二扇，火气愈盛；第三扇，火头飞有千丈之高。若是跑得不快，把毫毛都烧尽矣！”八戒笑道：“你常说雷打不伤，火烧不损，如今何又怕火？”行者道：“你这呆子，全不知事！那时节用心防备，故此不伤；今日只为搧息火光，不曾捻避火诀，又未使护身法，所以把两股毫毛烧了。”沙僧道：“似这般火盛，无路通西，怎生是好？”八戒道：“只拣无火处走便罢。”三藏道：“那方无火？”八戒道：“东方南方北方俱无火。”又问：“那方有经？”八戒道：“西方有经。”三藏道：“我只欲往有经处去哩！”沙僧道：“有经处有火，无火处无经，诚是进退两难！”师徒们正自胡谈乱讲，只听得有人叫道：“大圣不须烦恼，且来吃些斋饭再议。”四众回看时，见一老人，身披飘风氅，头顶偃月冠，手持龙头杖，只踏铁靿靴，后带着一个雕嘴鱼腮鬼，鬼头上顶着一个铜盆，盆内有些蒸饼糕糜，黄粮米饭，在于西路下躬身道：“我本是火焰山土地，知大圣保护圣僧，不能前进，特献一斋。”行者道：“吃斋小可，这火光几时灭得，让我师父过去？”土地道：“要灭火光，须求罗刹女借芭蕉扇。”行者去路旁拾起扇子道：“这不是？那火光越扇越着，何也？”土地看了，笑道：“此扇不是真的，被他哄了。”行者道：“如何方得真的？”那土地又控背躬身微微笑道：</p>

<p>“若还要借真蕉扇，须是寻求大力王。”毕竟不知大力王有甚缘故，且听下回分解。</p>
