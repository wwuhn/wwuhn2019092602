<P>On Flat-Top Mountain the Duty God Delivers a Message</P>
<P>In Lotus Flower Cave Pig Runs into Trouble</P>
</div>
<P>The story tells how after Monkey had rejoined the Tang Priest the four of them headed West, united in their shared determination. The king of Elephantia had escorted them beyond his capital to thank them for bringing back his daughter. From there they traveled on, eating when hungry and drinking when thirsty, moving by day and resting at night. By now it was spring.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A light breeze ruffled the silky green catkins of willows,</P>
<P>And the view was splendid.</P>
<P>The season encouraged the birds to sing;</P>
<P>The flowers bloomed in the warm sun,</P>
<P>Making the whole world fragrant.</P>
<P>A pair of swallows came to the tree in the courtyard;</P>
<P>Now was the time to enjoy the spring.</P>
<P>Amid the world's red dust and the city's streets,</P>
<P>Light silks were worn to the sound of lute and pipe,</P>
<P>As flower vied and the cup was passed around.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Master and disciples were enjoying their journey when they saw a mountain blocking their way. &#8220;Be careful, disciples,&#8221; said the Tang Priest. &#8220;I'm worried that tigers and wolves may prevent us from crossing that high mountain ahead.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As a man of religion,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you shouldn't say that sort of thing. Don't you remember what the<I> Heart Sutra</I> the Rook's Nest Hermit taught you says&#8212;'If one relies on the prajna-paramita, he is free in his mind, he has no fear, is rid of dreamlike thoughts of unreality and enjoys ultimate Nirvana.' All you have to do is</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>'Wipe the dust off your mind,</P>
<P>Wash out the dirt from your ear.</P>
<P>Without the most terrible suffering</P>
<P>You cannot be a great man.'</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>There's no need to be so glum. With me here you'll come to no harm even if the sky falls down, so why be scared of wolves and tigers?&#8221; The Tang Priest reined in his horse and replied:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;When I left Chang'an on imperial orders,</P>
<P>I was determined to worship the Buddha in the West,</P>
<P>Where his golden image shines in the sacred land,</P>
<P>And the jade hair gleams in the pagoda.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;I shall search the nameless rivers of the world,</P>
<P>And climb all unknown mountain ranges.</P>
<P>I long to cross the mighty, misty waves;</P>
<P>But when, O when, will I find my rest?&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he chuckled and said, &#8220;You'll have no difficulty in that. When you've completed your mission all your destinies will be over and all your dharmas will be empty, so of course you'll be able to rest then.&#8221; This cheered up Sanzang, who gave his dragon-horse the rein and urged it forward. As they climbed the mountain they found it truly craggy and precipitous.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Towering peaks,</P>
<P>Tapering pinnacles.</P>
<P>Down in the deep and winding stream,</P>
<P>Beside the solitary cliff.</P>
<P>Down in the deep and winding stream,</P>
<P>You can hear the serpents playing and splashing in the water;</P>
<P>Beside the solitary cliff,</P>
<P>Amid the trees on the precipice, tigers whisk their tails.</P>
<P>Look up,</P>
<P>And the blue sky is high above the peaks;</P>
<P>Turn round,</P>
<P>And the heavens join the deeps in the valley.</P>
<P>Climbing it</P>
<P>Is like ascending a ladder;</P>
<P>Descending</P>
<P>Is like going into a pit.</P>
<P>This is indeed a weird and craggy ridge,</P>
<P>A wall of tapering cliffs.</P>
<P>On the craggy ridge,</P>
<P>The medicine-gatherer moves in fear;</P>
<P>On the sheer rock-face</P>
<P>The firewood-collector cannot take a step.</P>
<P>Wild goats and horses all run free</P>
<P>And many are the hares and mountain oxen.</P>
<P>The mountain is so high it blots out sun and stars;</P>
<P>One often meets evil monsters and gray wolves.</P>
<P>The path is hard to follow and difficult for the horse:</P>
<P>How will they ever see the Buddha at the Thunder Monastery?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As Sanzang reined in his horse to look at the mountain he saw that they had reached a most difficult spot. There was a wood-gatherer standing on the green, grassy slope, and this was what he looked like:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On his head a battered blue felt hat,</P>
<P>On his body a black woolen tunic.</P>
<P>The battered felt hat</P>
<P>That kept off sun and cloud was a strange sight;</P>
<P>In his black woolen tunic</P>
<P>He was amazingly happy and carefree.</P>
<P>The steel axe in his hand had been sharpened till it shone;</P>
<P>He cut dry wood and made it into bundles.</P>
<P>Spring hung from his carrying-pole,</P>
<P>And he was happy throughout the four seasons.</P>
<P>His appearance was relaxed,</P>
<P>And his mind free from anxiety.</P>
<P>He had accepted his lot throughout his life;</P>
<P>Fame and disgrace never bothered him on this mountain.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The wood-gatherer</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Was cutting down dead wood upon the slope</P>
<P>When he saw the monk approaching from the East.</P>
<P>Giving his axe a rest, he came out of the tress,</P>
<P>And, climbing fast, soon scaled the rock-face.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop here for a moment on your journey West,&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;I must warn you that there is a pack of vicious ogres and fierce wolves on this mountain. They eat travelers from the East who are heading West.&#8221;</P>
<P>The news terrified Sanzang out of his wits. Trembling in the saddle, he turned round sharply and called for his disciples.</P>
<P>&#8220;Did you hear what the woodman said?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;There are ogres and wolves on this mountain. Do any of you dare ask him for more details?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry, Master,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;I'll find out from him.&#8221;</P>
<P>Brother Monkey hurried up the mountain, and addressing the woodman as &#8220;Elder Brother&#8221; he asked all about it. &#8220;Why have you come here, venerable sir?&#8221; asked the woodman, returning his greeting.</P>
<P>&#8220;To tell you the truth, elder brother,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;We have come from the East and are heading West to fetch the scriptures. That's my master on the horse. He's a bit timid, so when you told him about the ogres and wolves he sent me to ask you about them. How long have they been here? Are they experts or just beginners? Please tell me about them. Then I can make the gods of the mountain and the local deities march them off.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this the woodman threw back his head and roared with laughter. &#8220;You really are a mad monk,&#8221; he said.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm not mad,&#8221; replied Monkey, &#8220;I'm talking sense.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you're talking sense,&#8221; said the woodman, &#8220;then how can you say you'll have them marched off?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You must be related to them,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;putting on those airs and blocking our way to talk that nonsense to us. If you're not related to them you're either a neighbour or a friend of theirs.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is too much, mad monk,&#8221; said the woodcutter with another laugh. &#8220;The warning I've come specially to give you is meant well. I tell you to be on your guard all the time as you travel along, but you're holding me responsible for all those demons. Never mind whether I happen to know what these demons do. How could you possibly have them marched off even if I did know. Where would you send them?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If they were sky monsters,&#8221; replied Monkey, &#8220;I'd send them to the Jade Emperor, and if they were earth monsters I'd send them to the Earth Palace. Western ones would go to die Buddha and Eastern ones to the Sage. I'd send Northerners to the True Martial God of the North and Southerners to the Fire God. Dragon spirits would go to the Lord of the Seas and demons to King Yama. They all have somewhere to go. I know the people in all those places, so I'd only need to write out an order for the monsters to be sent there at the double the very same night.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You mad monk,&#8221; said the woodcutter with a mocking laugh, &#8220;you may have traveled in the clouds and learned a little magic, but even if you can expel evil spirits and bind demons you've never come up against such vicious fiends.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What's so vicious about them?&#8221; asked Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;This mountain is about two hundred miles across,&#8221; said the woodcutter, &#8220;and it's called Flat-top Mountain. There is a cave in it called the Lotus Flower Cave where two devil chieftains live. They are so determined to capture monks that they've drawn pictures of them and found out the name of the man they want to eat&#8212;the Tang Priest. You'll be all right provided you come from anywhere but Tang. But if you're from there, don't carry on.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The land of Tang,&#8221; replied Monkey, &#8220;is precisely where we're from.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Then they'll eat you,&#8221; said the woodcutter.</P>
<P>&#8220;We're in luck,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;we're in luck. The only thing is that I don't know how they're going to eat us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How do you want them to eat you?&#8221; the woodcutter asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;If they eat my head first,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;that will be fine. But if they start with my feet, I'll suffer.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What difference does it make whether they start with your head or feet?&#8221; the woodcutter asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;You have no experience of it,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;If they start with my head, they'll have it off with one bite and I'll be dead. Whether they fry me, saute me, or stew me I won't feel the slightest pain. But if they start from my feet they can chew my ankles, crunch up my legs, and eat their way up to my waist with me still alive and in agony. It would be going through torment in small installments. That's why I'd suffer.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They've been there for a long time, monk,&#8221; said the woodcutter, &#8220;and the moment they get you they'll tie you up, pop you in the steamer, and eat you whole.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Even better,&#8221; said Monkey with a grin, &#8220;even better. That won't be at all painful; it'll just be a bit hot and close.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is nothing to joke about, monk,&#8221; said the woodcutter. &#8220;Those monsters have five treasures that they carry about with them, and their magic powers are enormous. Even if you're one of the jade pillars of the heavens or one of the golden beams that support the sea you may well have to pass out in order to get the Tang Priest through.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How often?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Three or four times,&#8221; replied the woodcutter.</P>
<P>&#8220;That's nothing,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;nothing at all. We all pass out seven or eight hundred times a year, so it will be easy to pass out three or four times more and then we'll be able to get through.&#8221;</P>
<P>The fearless Great Sage, whose one thought was to protect the Tang Priest, left the woodcutter and hurried back. When he reached the horse standing on the mountainside he said, &#8220;It's nothing much, Master. It's true that there are a few evil spirits here, but the local people only worry about them because they are timid. With me here there's no need for you to be afraid of them, so let's be on our way again.&#8221; Sanzang was relieved to hear this, and he followed Monkey's lead.</P>
<P>As they traveled along they realized that woodcutter had disappeared some time back. &#8220;Why can't we see the woodcutter who gave us the message?&#8221; asked Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;What lousy luck,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;We would have to meet a ghost in broad daylight.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He must have gone into the forest to look for some more firewood,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'll take a look.&#8221; Opening wide his fiery eyes with their golden pupils, the splendid Great Sage searched the mountain, but no sign of the woodcutter was to be seen. Then he looked up into the clouds and saw the Duty God of the Day there. He sprang up there himself and cursed him for a hairy devil several times before saying, &#8220;Why didn't you tell me straight instead of transforming yourself and putting on that act for me?&#8221;</P>
<P>The Duty God bowed to him anxiously and said, &#8220;Please forgive me for being so late with the warning. Those monsters really have enormous magic powers and can perform all kinds of transformations. You'll need all your skill and cunning to protect your master. You won't possibly reach the Western Heaven if you are at all slack.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey dismissed the Duty God. He was feeling worried as he landed his cloud and went up the mountainside until he found Sanzang, Pig and Friar Sand pressing ahead. &#8220;If I tell the master straight what the Duty God said,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;the master won't be able to face up to it and will start crying. But if I don't tell him and keep him in the dark he won't know how things stand, and it'll be a great nuisance for me if he gets captured by monsters. I'd better go and see Pig. I can send him ahead to fight the monster. If he wins, that will be something to his credit. If he can't do it and gets captured by the monster, I can go and rescue him, which will give me a chance to show what I can do and make myself famous.&#8221; As he made these calculations he wondered whether Pig would try to slip out of it and be protected by Sanzang. He decided he would have to force him into doing it.</P>
<P>The Great Sage resorted to a trick. He rubbed his eyes till they watered, then went up to the master. When Pig saw him he said to Friar Sand, &#8220;Put your carrying-pole down and unpack the luggage. We two will split it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean, split it?&#8221; asked Friar Sand.</P>
<P>&#8220;Divide it,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;You can go back to the River of Flowing Sands to be a monster, and I'll go back to Gao Village to see my wife. We can sell the white horse to buy the wood for the coffin the master will be needing when he grows old. Then we can break up instead of going on to the Western Heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Sanzang heard this he said, &#8220;How can you talk such nonsense in the middle of the journey?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Who's talking nonsense? I'll say it again,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;Can't you see that Monkey's coming back in tears? He's a real tough guy who isn't afraid of going down into the earth or up into the sky, or of being cut, burnt, or even being boiled in oil, so if he comes along deep in gloom and with the tears streaming down his face there must be monsters and wolves on this craggy mountain that softies like us could never get past.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop that nonsense,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;I'll ask him what he has to say. Tell me straight,&#8221; he said to Monkey, &#8220;what is bothering you. Why are you crying? Are you trying to frighten us?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The person who gave us the message just now,&#8221; replied Monkey, &#8220;was the Duty God of the Day. He said that the evil spirits here are so ferocious that it will be hard to get through; besides, we'll never be able to make our way across these steep mountains. Let's go another day.&#8221;</P>
<P>Trembling with fear at this news, Sanzang tugged at Monkey's tigerskin kilt and said, &#8220;Why these thoughts of turning back when we've already done half the journey?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's not that I'm wavering,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;but we'd be no match for so many monsters. 'A lump of iron in the furnace can only make a few nails.'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;it would be very difficult by yourself. As the military classic says, 'few are no match for many'. But I also have Pig and Friar Sand for you to deploy as your subordinates. Make a joint effort to clear the path and take me over the mountain. Then you will receive your just reward.&#8221;</P>
<P>As Brother Monkey's little show had only wrung these words out of his master, he wiped away his tears and said, &#8220;Pig will have to do two things I tell him to if you're to have even one chance in three of crossing the mountain as you want to, Master. If he won't do these two things for me you'll have no hope at all.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; Pig said, &#8220;if we can't cross the mountain, let's disband. Leave me out of this.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;ask your brother what he wants you to do.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you want me to do, brother?&#8221; the idiot asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Look after the master and patrol the mountains,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;But looking after the master means staying put,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;and patrolling means moving. You can't ask me to stay put for a bit then move for a bit. I can't do both at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm not asking you to do them both,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;I just want you to do one of them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's much easier,&#8221; said Pig with a smile, &#8220;though I don't know what you mean by looking after the master or by patrolling the mountains. Tell me what you want, then I can do the one that suits me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Looking after the master,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;means that if he wants to go for a stroll you must support him, and if he wants to eat you must beg some food for him. If he's hungry you'll be beaten. If he looks at all sallow you'll be beaten. If he's any thinner you'll be beaten.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's very difficult,&#8221; said Pig with alarm. &#8220;There's nothing to looking after him or holding him up&#8212;even carrying him would be easy enough. But if he sends me to beg for food in a village the people on this path to the West won't realize that I'm a monk going to fetch the scriptures. They'll think that I'm a growing wild boar come down from the mountains. A crowd of men with forks, rakes and brooms will surround me, capture me, slaughter me, and salt me down for the New Year celebrations. That would be the end of me, wouldn't it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Then you can patrol the mountains,&#8221; said Brother Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;What would that involve?&#8221; asked Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;You would have to go into these mountains,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;to find out how many monsters there are, and all about the mountains, and what the monsters' caves are like, so that we can go across it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Nothing to it,&#8221; replied Pig. &#8220;I'll patrol the mountains.&#8221; The idiot hitched up his tunic, grasped his rake, and proudly struck deep into the mountains. His spirits were high as he hurried along the path.</P>
<P>Monkey could not hold back an unkind laugh. &#8220;Wretched ape,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;you haven't a shred of affection for your brothers, only jealousy. You trick him into patrolling the mountain with your cunning words, and then you laugh at him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm not laughing at him,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;My laugh means something. Just you see&#8212;he won't patrol the mountains or dare to visit any monsters. He'll hide up somewhere for a while then make up some story to fool us with.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How do you know so much about him?&#8221; asked Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's what I reckon he'll do,&#8221; replied Monkey &#8220;and if you don't believe me I'll go and take a look at him. I can help him subdue any demons and find out at the same time how sincere is his wish to see the Buddha.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very good,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;very good. But don't you go making a fool of him.&#8221; Monkey assented, and as he hurried up the mountainside he turned himself into the tiniest of insects with a shake of his body. He now looked very neat and small:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On his delicate wings he could lightly dance in the breeze;</P>
<P>His slim waist was as fine as a needle.</P>
<P>As he darted through the reeds or passed under flowers</P>
<P>He was faster than a shooting star.</P>
<P>Bright were his eyes,</P>
<P>Delicate his voice.</P>
<P>Of all insects he was the smallest,</P>
<P>Slim and elegant, but deeply clever.</P>
<P>If he were resting in the woods on a day off,</P>
<P>You would never see him,</P>
<P>And a thousand eyes could never find him.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He flew off, soon caught up with Pig, and perched on a bristle behind his ear; but Pig walked on, unaware that he was carrying a passenger. After two or three miles Pig dropped his rake, turned back to look at the Tang Priest, and began to curse at him, gesticulating widely.</P>
<P>&#8220;Soft-headed old monk,&#8221; he said, &#8220;vicious Monkey, and weak-minded Friar Sand. They're all enjoying themselves back there while they fool me into walking off here. We're all going to fetch the scriptures and we all want our reward, so why should I be the one to reconnoiter these mountains? Hm! If they know there are monsters around we should hide up for a while. But that's not even half good enough for them. They have to send me off by myself to find them. What lousy luck. I'll go and have a sleep somewhere. When I go back I can give him some kind of vague answer and say I've reconnoitered the mountains. That'll pay them back.&#8221;</P>
<P>Feeling pleased with himself for the moment Pig grasped his rake and set off. When he saw a reddish grassy slope in a mountain hollow he went straight to it, made himself a bed with the help of his rake, and lay down to sleep, saying as he stretched himself out, &#8220;This is the life. Not even Monkey can be as comfortable as I am.&#8221; Monkey, of course, had heard every word form behind his ear, and he could not resist the temptation to fly round and tease him. He shook himself and turned into a woodpecker.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>His sharp iron beak was coloured red,</P>
<P>His green-blue feathers were glistening bright.</P>
<P>His steel claws were as sharp as nails,</P>
<P>And when hungry he broke the forest silence.</P>
<P>Dry and rotten timber was what he loved;</P>
<P>He hated lone and sturdy old trees.</P>
<P>His round eyes and flicking tail made him a lively creature,</P>
<P>And pleasant was the sound of his tapping.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This bird was neither too big nor too small, and would have weighed only two or three ounces. Its beak was copper-red, its legs were iron-black, and it came flying down with a swish of its wings.</P>
<P>When it pecked at the lip of Pig, who was sleeping with his head down, the idiot scrambled to his feet and shouted, &#8220;A monster, a monster! It jabbed me with its spear. My mouth's hurting terribly.&#8221; As he felt it with his hand he made the blood flow.</P>
<P>&#8220;Dammit,&#8221; he said, &#8220;nothing especially good has happened to me, so what's this lucky red doing on my lips?&#8221; At the sight of his bloody hand he started to look wildly about himself, muttering on the while, and when he saw nothing he said, &#8220;There's no monster here, so how did I get jabbed?&#8221; Then he looked up and saw a woodpecker flying above him.</P>
<P>&#8220;The wretch,&#8221; he said, gnashing his teeth, &#8220;it's bad enough being put upon by Monkey, but now you're getting at me. I suppose you didn't realize I was human and thought my snout was a black, rotten old tree full of insects. You pecked me to find yourself some. I'll have to tuck my snout into my clothes.&#8221; With that the idiot went back to sleep.</P>
<P>Monkey flew down again and pecked him behind the ear, at which the idiot leapt up again and said, &#8220;This damned bird is really going for me. It must have a nest full of eggs or chicks here and be attacking me to stop me taking it. Very well then, I won't sleep here.&#8221; He picked up his rake and left the red grassy slope to continue on his way.</P>
<P>Monkey, beside himself with delight, thought, &#8220;Even with his eyes wide open the blockhead can't recognize one of his own people.&#8221;</P>
<P>With a shake the splendid Great Sage turned himself back into a tiny insect and perched himself behind Pig's ear. Another mile or so deeper into the mountains there were three square granite boulders the size of tables in a hollow. Pig put down his rake and chanted a &#8220;re-e-er&#8221; to them.</P>
<P>&#8220;The idiot,&#8221; grinned Monkey to himself, &#8220;those boulders aren't human. They can't talk or return his greeting. He's wasting his time being polite to them.&#8221; In fact the idiot was pretending that they were Sanzang, Friar Sand and Monkey, and practicing his speech to them.</P>
<P>&#8220;When I go back,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if the master asks me about monsters, I'll say that there are some here. When he asks what sort of mountain this is he'll think I'm talking nonsense if I say it's made of mud or earth or tin or copper or flour or paper or simply painted. I'll say it's a mountain made of rock, and if he asks about the caves I'll say there is a stone cave. What about the gates? I'll say they're iron-plated and studded. When he asks how deep the cave is I'll say it has three sections, one behind another. If he really interrogates me and wants to know how many studs there are in the gates I'll say I was too excited to notice. Now I've got my story off pat I'll be able to make a fool of Monkey.&#8221;</P>
<P>His story now concocted, he headed back along the path, dragging his rake behind him, little knowing that Monkey had heard everything behind his ear and flown off ahead when he started back. Monkey resumed his real form to see his master, who said, &#8220;Ah, here you are. Why hasn't Pig come back?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He's still cooking up his story,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;he'll be here soon.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How could that stupid fool, whose ears cover his eyes, ever make up a story?&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;You must be the one who is lying.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're covering up for him, master,&#8221; replied Monkey. &#8220;I heard it all from his own mouth.&#8221; He told Sanzang how Pig had been sleeping in the grass when he was woken up with a woodpeckers' peck, how he had expressed his homage to the boulders, and how he had concocted a story about the mountains being made of rock with a stone cave that had iron-plated gates and monsters living in it. It was not long before the idiot approached. He was going through his story again, his head bowed low, to make sure that he did not forget it when Monkey shouted, &#8220;Hey, idiot, what are you reciting?&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig pricked up his ears, looked around, and said, &#8220;I'm back.&#8221;</P>
<P>He fell to his knees and was picked up by Sanzang, who said, &#8220;You look exhausted, disciple.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am,&#8221; replied Pig. &#8220;With all that walking and climbing I'm completely whacked.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Are there monsters?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;there certainly are. There's a whole pile of them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What sort of send-off did they give you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They called me Ancestor Pig and Grandfather Pig, gave me noodle soup and vegetarian dishes, talked to me, and sent me back over the mountain with drums and banners,&#8221; Pig replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;This must be some dream you had while you were asleep in the grass,&#8221; said Monkey, so frightening the idiot that he shrank two inches.</P>
<P>&#8220;Lord Monkey,&#8221; he said, &#8220;however did you know I had a sleep?&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey went up to him, grabbed hold of him, and said, &#8220;Come here, I've something to ask you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Ask me if you must,&#8221; said the idiot, now shaking with fright, &#8220;but why do you have to grab me like that?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What sort of mountain was it?&#8221; asked Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;A mountain of rock,&#8221; replied Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;What sort of cave?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stone.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What sort of gates?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Iron-plated.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How deep?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There were three sections.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No need to say more,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;I remember the rest. I'll say it all for you to make sure that the master believes it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Cheek!&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;You've not been there, so you can't possibly know what to say for me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;'If he wants to know how many studs there are in the gates I'll say I was too excited to notice.' Isn't that right?&#8221; said Monkey. The panic-stricken idiot fell to his knees again as Monkey continued, &#8220;You chanted homage to those boulders and talked to them as if they were us three, didn't you? Then you said, 'Now I've got this story off pat I'll be able to make a fool of Monkey,' didn't you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; pleaded the idiot, now kowtowing desperately, &#8220;you couldn't have heard all that while I was patrolling the mountains.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll get you, you chaff-guzzling moron,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;sleeping when you'd been told to patrol the mountains. If the woodpecker hadn't pecked you awake you'd still be asleep now. When you'd been woken up you concocted this pack of lies that might have ruined our whole journey. Stretch your ankle out and I'll give you five strokes of my cudgel to teach you a lesson.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;A mere touch from that murderous cudgel,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;would break my skin, and the feel of it would crack my sinews. Five blows would kill me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you didn't want to be beaten,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;why did you lie?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I only did it once,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;and I'll never do it again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As it was only once I'll give you three.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;half a blow would be the death of me.&#8221; The idiot's only recourse was to cling to Sanzang and beg him to put in a good word for him.</P>
<P>&#8220;When Monkey told me you were concocting lies,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;I did not believe him, yet now you clearly deserve a beating. But as there are so few of you to serve me as we cross these mountains, you had better let him off, Monkey, until we are on the other side.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As the old saw goes,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;'to obey parental instructions is great filial piety.' As the master tells me not to beat you I'll let you off. Go and reconnoiter again. I'll show you no mercy if you lie or mess things up this time.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot rose to his feet and went off again. As he hurried along the path he suspected at every step that Monkey was following in some form or other, so he thought everything he saw might be Monkey. When after two or three miles a tiger came bounding up from the mountainside he raised his rake and said, &#8220;Come to see whether I'm lying, brother? This time I'm not.&#8221;</P>
<P>Further along a strong mountain wind blew a dead tree down and sent it tumbling towards him, at which he stamped, beat his chest and said, &#8220;What a way to treat me, brother. I said I wouldn't lie, but you go and turn yourself into a tree to attack me.&#8221;</P>
<P>A little later he saw a white-necked crow cawing in front of him. &#8220;You're shameless, brother,&#8221; he said, &#8220;shameless. I meant it when I said I wouldn't lie, so why've you turned into a crow? Come to listen to me?&#8221; In fact Monkey was not following him this time, and Pig's crazed suspicions that Monkey was there wherever he went were the product of his own imagination. We will leave the idiot with his frights for the time being.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In this Flat-top Mountain there was a Lotus Flower Cave where there dwelt two fiends, the Senior King Gold Horn and the Junior King Silver Horn. Gold Horn sat in his chair of office and said to Silver Horn, &#8220;It's a long time since we patrolled the mountain.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;A fortnight,&#8221; replied Silver Horn.</P>
<P>&#8220;You should make a patrol today,&#8221; said Gold Horn.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why today?&#8221; asked Silver Horn.</P>
<P>&#8220;You can't have heard the news,&#8221; said Gold Horn, &#8220;that the Tang Priest, the younger brother of the Tang Emperor in the East, has been sent to worship the Buddha in the West. He has three followers called Sun the Novice, Pig and Friar Sand, so with their horse there are five of them in all. Find them and bring them to me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If we want to eat some humans,&#8221; said Silver Horn, &#8220;we can catch a few anywhere. Why not let this monk go wherever he's going?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't realize,&#8221; replied Gold Horn, &#8220;that when I left Heaven a few years back I heard that the Tang Priest was a mortal incarnation of the Venerable Golden Cicada, and a holy man who had pursued goodness for ten lives and lost not a drop of his original essence. Anyone who eats his flesh will live forever.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you can live for ever by eating his flesh,&#8221; said Silver Horn, &#8220;we won't have to bother with meditation, winning merit, refinish elixirs, or matching the male and female. All we need do is eat him. I'm off to fetch him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're too impatient, brother,&#8221; said Gold Horn. &#8220;Don't be in such a hurry. It would be wrong to rush out and catch some monk who isn't the Tang Priest. I remember what he looks like and I once drew pictures of him and his disciples. Take them with you and check any monks you meet against them.&#8221; He went on to tell him all their names, and when Silver Horn had their pictures and knew their names he went out of the cave, mustered thirty underlings, and left to patrol the mountain.</P>
<P>Pig's luck was out. He walked straight into the gang of monsters who blocked his way and said, &#8220;Who are you? Where are you from?&#8221; The idiot looked up, lifted his ears from over his eyes, and saw to his horror that they were evil ogres.</P>
<P>&#8220;If I say I'm a pilgrim,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;they'll catch me. I'll say I'm just a traveler.&#8221; The junior demon reported to the king that he was a traveler. Among the thirty junior demons there were some who had recognized him and some who had not, and one of these who had recognized him remembered Silver Horn being given his instructions.</P>
<P>He said, &#8220;This monk looks like Pig in the picture, Your Majesty.&#8221;</P>
<P>Silver Horn had the picture hung up, which made Pig think with horror, &#8220;No wonder I'm in such low spirits these days&#8212;they've got my spirit here.&#8221;</P>
<P>As the junior devils held it up with their spears, Silver Horn pointed at it and said, &#8220;The one on the white horse is the Tang Priest, and the hairy-faced one is Sun the Novice.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;City god,&#8221; thought Pig, &#8220;you can leave me out. I'll offer you the triple sacrifice and 24 cups of pure wine...&#8221;</P>
<P>He muttered prayers as the devil continued, &#8220;The tall dark one is Friar Sand, and that's Pig with a long snout and big ears.&#8221; At the mention of himself Pig tucked his snout into his clothes.</P>
<P>&#8220;Bring your snout out, monk,&#8221; said the monster.</P>
<P>&#8220;I was born like this,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;so I can't bring it out.&#8221; The monster ordered the junior devils to pull it out with hooks, at which Pig hastily thrust it out and said, &#8220;I just feel shy about it. Here it is. Look at it if you must, but don't hook it.&#8221;</P>
<P>Recognizing Pig, the monster raised his sword and hacked at him. Pig parried him with his rake and said, &#8220;Behave yourself, my lad, and take this.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You took your vows quite late,&#8221; said the monster with a smile.</P>
<P>&#8220;Clever boy,&#8221; replied Pig, &#8220;but how did you know?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;From the way you handle that rake,&#8221; the monster said, &#8220;you used it to level up the ground in a vegetable garden. You must have stolen it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't know this rake, my boy,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;It's not the sort used in ground-leveling:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Its teeth are like a dragon's claws,</P>
<P>Flecked with gold in tigerish shapes.</P>
<P>Against a foe it blows a freezing wind,</P>
<P>And in a battle it shoots out flame.</P>
<P>It brushes away obstacles in the Tang Priest's path,</P>
<P>Capturing devils on the way to the Western Heaven.</P>
<P>When whirled, its vapors obscure the sun and moon,</P>
<P>And its black clouds darken the stars.</P>
<P>When it flattens Mount Tai the tigers tremble;</P>
<P>Dragons are frightened when it overturns the ocean.</P>
<P>Even if you have some tricks, you monster,</P>
<P>One blow from this rake will leave nine bloody holes.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This made the monster more determined that ever, and with his Seven-starred Sword he battled thorough twenty inconclusive rounds with Pig on the mountain. Pig fought back with deadly fury, and at the sight of him pricking up his ears, spewing out saliva, and waving his rake with grunts and shouts, the frightened demon turned round to bring all his underlings into the battle beside him.</P>
<P>Had he been fighting only the one enemy, Pig would have done fine, but when all the little devils rushed him he lost control, could no longer put up any resistance, and fled in defeat. As he was not paying attention to the uneven path he tripped over a creeper and fell over. He was just picking himself up and starting off again when a junior demon who was lying there tugged at his ankle and brought him tumbling down like a dog eating muck. A crowd of demons seized him and carried him back to the cave, holding him by the bristles, ears, legs and tail. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A single demon is hard enough to destroy;</P>
<P>Countless disasters can barely be averted.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know whether Pig lived or not, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>	</div>

<p>平顶山功曹传信</p>
<p>莲花洞木母逢灾</p>
</div>
<p>话说唐僧复得了孙行者，师徒们一心同体，共诣西方。自宝象国救了公主，承君臣送出城西，说不尽沿路饥餐渴饮。夜住晓行。却又值三春景候，那时节：轻风吹柳绿如丝，佳景最堪题。时催鸟语，暖烘花发，遍地芳菲。海棠庭院来双燕，正是赏春时。红尘紫陌，绮罗弦管，斗草传卮。师徒们正行赏间，又见一山挡路。唐僧道：“徒弟们仔细，前遇山高，恐有虎狼阻挡。”</p>

<p>行者道：“师父，出家人莫说在家话。你记得那乌巢和尚的《心经》云心无挂碍，无挂碍，方无恐怖，远离颠倒梦想之言？但只是扫除心上垢，洗净耳边尘。不受苦中苦，难为人上人。你莫生忧虑，但有老孙，就是塌下天来，可保无事。怕甚么虎狼！”长老勒回马道：“我当年奉旨出长安，只忆西来拜佛颜。舍利国中金象彩，浮屠塔里玉毫斑。寻穷天下无名水，历遍人间不到山。</p>

<p>逐逐烟波重迭迭，几时能彀此身闲？”行者闻说，笑呵呵道：“师要身闲，有何难事？若功成之后，万缘都罢，诸法皆空。那时节，自然而然，却不是身闲也？”长老闻言，只得乐以忘忧。放辔催银駔，兜缰趱玉龙。师徒们上得山来，十分险峻，真个嵯峨好山：巍巍峻岭，削削尖峰。湾环深涧下，孤峻陡崖边。湾环深涧下，只听得唿喇喇戏水蟒翻身；孤峻陡崖边，但见那崒嵂嵂出林虎剪尾。往上看，峦头突兀透青霄；回眼观，壑下深沉邻碧落。上高来，似梯似凳；下低行，如堑如坑。真个是古怪巅峰岭，果然是连尖削壁崖。巅峰岭上，采药人寻思怕走：削壁崖前，打柴夫寸步难行。胡羊野马乱撺梭，狡兔山牛如布阵。山高蔽日遮星斗，时逢妖兽与苍狼。草径迷漫难进马，怎得雷音见佛王？</p>

<p>长老勒马观山，正在难行之处。只见那绿莎坡上，佇立着一个樵夫。你道他怎生打扮：头戴一顶老蓝毡笠，身穿一领毛皂衲衣。老蓝毡笠，遮烟盖日果稀奇；毛皂衲衣，乐以忘忧真罕见。</p>

<p>手持钢斧快磨明，刀伐干柴收束紧。担头春色，幽然四序融融；</p>

<p>身外闲情，常是三星淡淡。到老只于随分过，有何荣辱暂关山？</p>

<p>那樵子正在坡前伐朽柴，忽逢长老自东来。停柯住斧出林外，趋步将身上石崖，对长老厉声高叫道：“那西进的长老！暂停片时。我有一言奉告：此山有一伙毒魔狠怪，专吃你东来西去的人哩。”长老闻言，魂飞魄散，战兢兢坐不稳雕鞍，急回头，忙呼徒弟道：“你听那樵夫报道此山有毒魔狠怪，谁敢去细问他一问？”行者道：“师父放心，等老孙去问他一个端的。”</p>

<p>好行者，拽开步，径上山来，对樵子叫声“大哥”，道个问讯。樵夫答礼道：“长老啊，你们有何缘故来此？”行者道：“不瞒大哥说，我们是东土差来西天取经的，那马上是我的师父，他有些胆小。适蒙见教，说有甚么毒魔狠怪，故此我来奉问一声：</p>

<p>那魔是几年之魔，怪是几年之怪？还是个把势，还是个雏儿？烦大哥老实说说，我好着山神土地递解他起身。”樵子闻言，仰天大笑道：“你原来是个风和尚。”行者道：“我不风啊，这是老实话。”樵子道：“你说是老实，便怎敢说把他递解起身？”行者道：“你这等长他那威风，胡言乱语的拦路报信，莫不是与他有亲？</p>

<p>不亲必邻，不邻必友。”樵子笑道：“你这个风泼和尚，忒没道理。我倒是好意，特来报与你们，教你们走路时，早晚间防备，你倒转赖在我身上。且莫说我不晓得妖魔出处，就晓得啊，你敢把他怎么的递解？解往何处？”行者道：“若是天魔，解与玉帝；若是土魔，解与土府。西方的归佛，东方的归圣。北方的解与真武，南方的解与火德。是蛟精解与海主，是鬼祟解与阎王，各有地头方向。我老孙到处里人熟，发一张批文，把他连夜解着飞跑。”那樵子止不住呵呵冷笑道：“你这个风泼和尚，想是在方上云游，学了些书符咒水的法术，只可驱邪缚鬼，还不曾撞见这等狠毒的怪哩。”行者道：“怎见他狠毒？”樵子道：“此山径过有六百里远近，名唤平顶山。山中有一洞，名唤莲花洞。洞里有两个魔头，他画影图形，要捉和尚；抄名访姓，要吃唐僧。</p>

<p>你若别处来的还好，但犯了一个唐字儿，莫想去得去得！”行者道：“我们正是唐朝来的。”樵子道：“他正要吃你们哩。”行者道：“造化！造化！但不知他怎的样吃哩？”樵子道：“你要他怎的吃？”行者道：“若是先吃头，还好耍子；若是先吃脚，就难为了。”樵子道：“先吃头怎么说？先吃脚怎么说？”行者道：“你还不曾经着哩。若是先吃头，一口将他咬下，我已死了，凭他怎么煎炒熬煮，我也不知疼痛；若是先吃脚，他啃了孤拐，嚼了腿亭，吃到腰截骨，我还急忙不死，却不是零零碎碎受苦？此所以难为也。”樵子道：“和尚，他那里有这许多工夫？只是把你拿住，捆在笼里，囫囵蒸吃了。”行者笑道：“这个更好！更好！疼倒不忍疼，只是受些闷气罢了。”樵子道：“和尚不要调嘴。那妖怪随身有五件宝贝，神通极大极广。就是擎天的玉柱，架海的金梁，若保得唐朝和尚去，也须要发发昏是。”行者道：“发几个昏么？”樵子道：“要发三四个昏是。”行者道：“不打紧，不打紧。</p>

<p>我们一年，常发七八百个昏儿，这三四个昏儿易得发，发发儿就过去了。”</p>

<p>好大圣，全然无惧，一心只是要保唐僧，捽脱樵夫，拽步而转，径至山坡马头前道：“师父，没甚大事。有便有个把妖精儿，只是这里人胆小，放他在心上。有我哩，怕他怎的？走路！走路！”长老见说，只得放怀随行。正行处，早不见了那樵夫。长老道：“那报信的樵子如何就不见了？”八戒道：“我们造化低，撞见日里鬼了。”行者道：“想是他钻进林子里寻柴去了。等我看看来。”好大圣，睁开火眼金睛，漫山越岭的望处，却无踪迹。</p>

<p>忽抬头往云端里一看，看见是日值功曹，他就纵云赶上，骂了几声毛鬼，道：“你怎么有话不来直说，却那般变化了，演样老孙？”慌得那功曹施礼道：“大圣，报信来迟，勿罪，勿罪。那怪果然神通广大，变化多端。只看你腾那乖巧，运动神机，仔细保你师父；假若怠慢了些儿，西天路莫想去得。”</p>

<p>行者闻言，把功曹叱退，切切在心，按云头，径来山上。只见长老与八戒、沙僧，簇拥前进，他却暗想：“我若把功曹的言语实实告诵师父，师父他不济事，必就哭了；假若不与他实说，梦着头，带着他走，常言道乍入芦圩，不知深浅。倘或被妖魔捞去，却不又要老孙费心？且等我照顾八戒一照顾，先着他出头与那怪打一仗看。若是打得过他，就算他一功；若是没手段，被怪拿去，等老孙再去救他不迟，却好显我本事出名。”正自家计较，以心问心道：“只恐八戒躲懒便不肯出头，师父又有些护短，等老孙羁勒他羁勒。”好大圣，你看他弄个虚头，把眼揉了一揉，揉出些泪来，迎着师父，往前径走。八戒看见，连忙叫：“沙和尚，歇下担子，拿出行李来，我两个分了罢！”沙僧道：“二哥，分怎的？”八戒道：“分了罢！你往流沙河还做妖怪，老猪往高老庄上盼盼浑家。把白马卖了，买口棺木，与师父送老，大家散火，还往西天去哩？”长老在马上听见，道：“这个夯货！正走路，怎么又胡说了？”八戒道：“你儿子便胡说！你不看见孙行者那里哭将来了？他是个钻天入地、斧砍火烧、下油锅都不怕的好汉，如今戴了个愁帽，泪汪汪的哭来，必是那山险峻，妖怪凶狠。似我们这样软弱的人儿，怎么去得？”长老道：“你且休胡谈，待我问他一声，看是怎么说话。”问道：“悟空，有甚话当面计较，你怎么自家烦恼？这般样个哭包脸，是虎唬我也！”行者道：“师父啊，刚才那个报信的，是日值功曹。他说妖精凶狠，此处难行，果然的山高路峻，不能前进，改日再去罢。”长老闻言，恐惶悚惧，扯住他虎皮裙子道：“徒弟呀，我们三停路已走了停半，因何说退悔之言？”行者道：“我没个不尽心的，但只恐魔多力弱，行势孤单。纵然是块铁，下炉能打得几根钉？”长老道：“徒弟啊，你也说得是，果然一个人也难。兵书云，寡不可敌众。</p>

<p>我这里还有八戒沙僧，都是徒弟，凭你调度使用，或为护将帮手，协力同心，扫清山径，领我过山，却不都还了正果？”那行者这一场扭捏，只逗出长老这几句话来，他揾了泪道：“师父啊，若要过得此山，须是猪八戒依得我两件事儿，才有三分去得；</p>

<p>假若不依我言，替不得我手，半分儿也莫想过去。”八戒道：“师兄不去，就散火罢，不要攀我。”长老道：“徒弟，且问你师兄，看他教你做甚么。”呆子真个对行者说道：“哥哥，你教我做甚事？”行者道：“第一件是看师父，第二件是去巡山。”八戒道：“看师父是坐，巡山去是走。终不然教我坐一会又走，走一会又坐，两处怎么顾盼得来？”行者道：“不是教你两件齐干，只是领了一件便罢。”八戒又笑道：“这等也好计较。但不知看师父是怎样，巡山是怎样，你先与我讲讲，等我依个相应些儿的去干罢。”行者道：“看师父啊：师父去出恭，你伺候；师父要走路，你扶持；师父要吃斋，你化斋。若他饿了些儿，你该打；黄了些儿脸皮，你该打；瘦了些儿形骸，你该打。”八戒慌了道：“这个难！</p>

<p>难！难！伺候扶持，通不打紧，就是不离身驮着，也还容易；假若教我去乡下化斋，他这西方路上，不识我是取经的和尚，只道是那山里走出来的一个半壮不壮的健猪，伙上许多人，叉钯扫帚，把老猪围倒，拿家去宰了，腌着过年，这个却不就遭瘟了？”行者道：“巡山去罢。”八戒道：“巡山便怎么样儿？”行者道：“就入此山，打听有多少妖怪，是甚么山，是甚么洞，我们好过去。”八戒道：“这个小可，老猪去巡山罢。”那呆子就撒起衣裙，挺着钉钯，雄纠纠，径入深山；气昂昂，奔上大路。</p>

<p>行者在旁，忍不住嘻嘻冷笑。长老骂道：“你这个泼猴！兄弟们全无爱怜之意，常怀嫉妒之心。你做出这样獐智，巧言令色，撮弄他去甚么巡山，却又在这里笑他！”行者道：“不是笑他，我这笑中有味。你看猪八戒这一去，决不巡山，也不敢见妖怪，不知往那里去躲闪半会，捏一个谎来，哄我们也。”长老道：“你怎么就晓得他？”行者道：“我估出他是这等，不信，等我跟他去看看，听他一听，一则帮副他手段降妖，二来看他可有个诚心拜佛。”长老道：“好好好，你却莫去捉弄他。”行者应诺了，径直赶上山坡，摇身一变，变作个蟭蟟虫儿。其实变得轻巧，但见他：翅薄舞风不用力，腰尖细小如针。穿蒲抹草过花阴，疾似流星还甚。眼睛明映映，声气渺喑喑。昆虫之类惟他小，亭亭款款机深。几番闲日歇幽林，一身浑不见，千眼莫能寻。嘤的一翅飞将去，赶上八戒，钉在他耳朵后面鬃根底下。那呆子只管走路，怎知道身上有人，行有七八里路，把钉钯撇下，吊转头来，望着唐僧，指手画脚的骂道：“你罢软的老和尚，捉掐的弼马温，面弱的沙和尚！他都在那里自在，捉弄我老猪来跄路！大家取经，都要望成正果，偏是教我来巡甚么山！哈哈哈！晓得有妖怪，躲着些儿走。还不彀一半，却教我去寻他，这等晦气哩！我往那里睡觉去，睡一觉回去，含含糊糊的答应他，只说是巡了山，就了其帐也。”那呆子一时间侥幸，搴着钯又走。只见山凹里一弯红草坡，他一头钻得进去，使钉钯扑个地铺，毂辘的睡下，把腰伸了一伸，道声“快活！就是那弼马温，也不得象我这般自在！”原来行者在他耳根后，句句儿听着哩，忍不住，飞将起来，又捉弄他一捉弄。又摇身一变，变作个啄木虫儿，但见：铁嘴尖尖红溜，翠翎艳艳光明。一双钢爪利如钉，腹馁何妨林静。最爱枯槎朽烂，偏嫌老树伶仃。圜睛决尾性丢灵，辟剥之声堪听。</p>

<p>这虫鹥不大不小的，上秤称，只有二三两重，红铜嘴，黑铁脚，刷剌的一翅飞下来。那八戒丢倒头，正睡着了，被他照嘴唇上扢揸的一下。那呆子慌得爬将起来，口里乱嚷道：“有妖怪！</p>

<p>有妖怪！把我戳了一枪去了！嘴上好不疼呀！”伸手摸摸，泱出血来了，他道：“蹭蹬啊！我又没甚喜事，怎么嘴上挂了红耶？”</p>

<p>他看着这血手，口里絮絮叨叨的两边乱看，却不见动静，道：“无甚妖怪，怎么戳我一枪么？”忽抬头往上看时，原来是个啄木虫，在半空中飞哩。呆子咬牙骂道：“这个亡人！弼马温欺负我罢了，你也来欺负我！我晓得了，他一定不认我是个人，只把我嘴当一段黑朽枯烂的树，内中生了虫，寻虫儿吃的，将我啄了这一下也，等我把嘴揣在怀里睡罢。”那呆子毂辘的依然睡倒，行者又飞来，着耳根后又啄了一下。呆子慌得爬起来道：“这个亡人，却打搅得我狠！想必这里是他的窠巢，生蛋布雏，怕我占了，故此这般打搅。罢！罢！罢！不睡他了！”搴着钯，径出红草坡，找路又走。可不喜坏了孙行者，笑倒个美猴王，行者道：“这夯货大睁着两个眼，连自家人也认不得！”好大圣，摇身又一变，还变做个蟭蟟虫，钉在他耳朵后面，不离他身上。那呆子入深山，又行有四五里，只见山凹中有桌面大的四四方方三块青石头。呆子放下钯，对石头唱个大喏。行者暗笑道：“这呆子！石头又不是人，又不会说话，又不会还礼的，唱他喏怎的，可不是个瞎帐？”原来那呆子把石头当着唐僧沙僧行者三人，朝着他演习哩。他道：“我这回去，见了师父，若问有妖怪，就说有妖怪。他问甚么山，我若说是泥捏的，土做的，锡打的，铜铸的，面蒸的，纸糊的，笔画的，他们见说我呆哩，若讲这话，一发说呆了，我只说是石头山。他问甚么洞，也只说是石头洞。</p>

<p>他问甚么门，却说是钉钉的铁叶门。他问里边有多远，只说入内有三层。十分再搜寻，问门上钉子多少，只说老猪心忙记不真。此间编造停当，哄那弼马温去！”</p>

<p>那呆子捏合了，拖着钯，径回本路，怎知行者在耳朵后，一一听得明白。行者见他回来，即腾两翅预先回去，现原身见了师父。师父道：“悟空，你来了，悟能怎不见回？”行者笑道：“他在那里编谎哩，就待来也。”长老道：“他两个耳朵盖着眼，愚拙之人也，他会编甚么谎？又是你捏合甚么鬼话赖他哩。”行者道：“师父，你只是这等护短，这是有对问的话。”把他那钻在草里睡觉，被啄木虫叮醒，朝石头唱喏，编造甚么石头山、石头洞、铁叶门、有妖精的话，预先说了。说毕，不多时，那呆子走将来，又怕忘了那谎，低着头口里温习。被行者喝了一声道：“呆子！念甚么哩？”八戒掀起耳朵来看看道：“我到了地头了！”那呆子上前跪倒，长老搀起道：“徒弟，辛苦啊。”八戒道：“正是。</p>

<p>走路的人，爬山的人，第一辛苦了。”长老道：“可有妖怪么？”八戒道：“有妖怪！有妖怪！一堆妖怪哩！”长老道：“怎么打发你来？”八戒说：“他叫我做猪祖宗，猪外公，安排些粉汤素食，教我吃了一顿，说道，摆旗鼓送我们过山哩。”行者道：“想是在草里睡着了，说得是梦话？”呆子闻言，就吓得矮了三寸道：“爷爷呀！我睡他怎么晓得？”行者上前，一把揪住道：“你过来，等我问你。”呆子又慌了，战战兢兢的道：“问便罢了，揪扯怎的？”行者道：“是甚么山？”八戒道：“是石头山。”“甚么洞？”道：“是石头洞。”“甚么门？”道：“是钉钉铁叶门。”“里边有多远？”道：“入内是三层。”行者道：“你不消说了，后半截我记得真。恐师父不信，我替你说了罢。”八戒道：“嘴脸！你又不曾去，你晓得那些儿，要替我说？”行者笑道：“门上钉子有多少，只说老猪心忙记不真。可是么？”那呆子即慌忙跪倒。行者道：“朝着石头唱喏，当做我三人，对他一问一答，可是么？又说，等我编得谎儿停当，哄那弼马温去！可是么？”那呆子连忙只是磕头道：“师兄，我去巡山，你莫成跟我去听的？”行者骂道：“我把你个馕糠的夯货！这般要紧的所在，教你去巡山，你却去睡觉！不是啄木虫叮你醒来，你还在那里睡哩。及叮醒，又编这样大谎，可不误了大事？你快伸过孤拐来，打五棍记心！”八戒慌了道：“那个哭丧棒重，擦一擦儿皮塌，挽一挽儿筋伤，若打五下，就是死了！”</p>

<p>行者道：“你怕打，却怎么扯谎？”八戒道：“哥哥呀，只是这一遭儿，以后再不敢了。”行者道：“一遭便打三棍罢。”八戒道：“爷爷呀，半棍儿也禁不得！”呆子没计奈何，扯住师父道：“你替我说个方便儿。”长老道：“悟空说你编谎，我还不信。今果如此，其实该打。但如今过山少人使唤，悟空，你且饶他，待过了山再打罢。”行者道：“古人云，顺父母言情，呼为大孝。师父说不打，我就且饶你。你再去与他巡山，若再说谎误事，我定一下也不饶你！”那呆子只得爬起来奔上大路又去。你看他疑心生暗鬼，步步只疑是行者变化了跟住他，故见一物，即疑是行者。走有七八里，见一只老虎，从山坡上跑过，他也不怕，举着钉钯道：“师兄来听说谎的，这遭不编了。”又走处，那山风来得甚猛，呼的一声，把颗枯木刮倒，滚至面前，他又跌脚捶胸的道：“哥啊！</p>

<p>这是怎的起！一行说不敢编谎罢了，又变甚么树来打人！”又走向前，只见一个白颈老鸦，当头喳喳的连叫几声，他又道：“哥哥，不羞！不羞！我说不编就不编了，只管又变着老鸦怎的？你来听么？”原来这一番行者却不曾跟他去，他那里却自惊自怪，乱疑乱猜，故无往而不疑是行者随他身也。呆子惊疑且不题。</p>

<p>却说那山叫做平顶山，那洞叫做莲花洞。洞里两妖：一唤金角大王，一唤银角大王。金角正坐，对银角说：“兄弟，我们多少时不巡山了？”银角道：“有半个月了。”金角道：“兄弟，你今日与我去巡巡。”银角道：“今日巡山怎的？”金角道：“你不知，近闻得东土唐朝差个御弟唐僧往西方拜佛，一行四众，叫做孙行者、猪八戒、沙和尚，连马五口。你看他在那处，与我把他拿来。”银角道：“我们要吃人，那里不捞几个？这和尚到得那里，让他去罢。”金角道：“你不晓得。我当年出天界，尝闻得人言：</p>

<p>唐僧乃金蝉长老临凡，十世修行的好人，一点元阳未泄，有人吃他肉，延寿长生哩。”银角道：“若是吃了他肉就可以延寿长生，我们打甚么坐，立甚么功，炼甚么龙与虎，配甚么雌与雄？</p>

<p>只该吃他去了。等我去拿他来。”金角道：“兄弟，你有些性急，且莫忙着。你若走出门，不管好歹，但是和尚就拿将来，假如不是唐僧，却也不当人子？我记得他的模样，曾将他师徒画了一个影，图了一个形，你可拿去。但遇着和尚，以此照验照验。”又将某人是某名字，一一说了。银角得了图像，知道姓名，即出洞，点起三十名小怪，便来山上巡逻。</p>

<p>却说八戒运拙，正行处，可可的撞见群魔，当面挡住道：“那来的甚么人？”呆子才抬起头来，掀着耳朵，看见是些妖魔，他就慌了，心中暗道：“我若说是取经的和尚，他就捞了去，只是说走路的。”小妖回报道：“大王，是走路的。”那三十名小怪，中间有认得的，有不认得的，旁边有听着指点说话的，道：“大王，这个和尚，象这图中猪八戒模样。”叫挂起影神图来，八戒看见，大惊道：“怪道这些时没精神哩！原来是他把我的影神传将来也！”小妖用枪挑着，银角用手指道：“这骑白马的是唐僧，这毛脸的是孙行者。”八戒听见道：“城隍，没我便也罢了，猪头三牲，清醮二十四分。”口里唠叨，只管许愿。那怪又道：“这黑长的是沙和尚，这长嘴大耳的是猪八戒。”呆子听见说他，慌得把个嘴揣在怀里藏了。那怪叫：“和尚，伸出嘴来！”八戒道：“胎里病，伸不出来。”那怪令小妖使钩子钩出来。八戒慌得把个嘴伸出道：“小家形罢了，这不是？你要看便就看，钩怎的？”那怪认得是八戒，掣出宝刀，上前就砍。这呆子举钉钯按住道：“我的儿，休无礼！看钯！”那怪笑道：“这和尚是半路出家的。”八戒道：“好儿子！有些灵性！你怎么就晓得老爷是半路出家的？”</p>

<p>那怪道：“你会使这钯，一定是在人家园圃中筑地，把他这钯偷将来也。”八戒道：“我的儿，你那里认得老爷这钯。我不比那筑地之钯，这是：巨齿铸来如龙爪，渗金妆就似虎形。若逢对敌寒风洒，但遇相持火焰生。能替唐僧消障碍，西天路上捉妖精。轮动烟霞遮日月，使起昏云暗斗星。筑倒泰山老虎怕，掀翻大海老龙惊。饶你这妖有手段，一钯九个血窟窿！”那怪闻言，那里肯让，使七星剑，丢开解数，与八戒一往一来，在山中赌斗，有二十回合，不分胜负。八戒发起狠来，舍死的相迎。那怪见他捽耳朵，喷粘涎，舞钉钯，口里吆吆喝喝的，也尽有些悚惧，即回头招呼小怪，一齐动手。若是一个打一个，其实还好。他见那些小妖齐上，慌了手脚，遮架不住，败了阵，回头就跑。原来是道路不平，未曾细看，忽被蓏萝藤绊了个踉跄。挣起来正走，又被个小妖，睡倒在地，扳着他脚跟，扑的又跌了个狗吃屎，被一群赶上按住，抓鬃毛，揪耳朵，扯着脚，拉着尾，扛扛抬抬，擒进洞去。咦！正是：一身魔发难消灭，万种灾生不易除。毕竟不知猪八戒性命如何，且听下回分解。</p>
