<P>The Four Seas and Thousand Mountains All Submit</P>
<P style="font-size:90%">In the Ninth Hell the Tenth Category Is Struck Off the Register</P>
</div>
<P>We have related how the Handsome Monkey King returned home in glory, bringing a large sword he had captured when he killed the Demon King of Confusion. From then on they practiced the military arts every day. He asked the little monkeys to cut down bamboo to make spears, carve swords out of wood, and learn to use banners and whistles. They learned to advance and retreat, and build a camp with a stockade round it. They spent a lot of time playing at this.</P>
<P>Once Sun Wukong was sitting in his seat of meditation when he wondered: &#8220;What would happen to us if our games were taken for the real thing? What if it alarmed some human monarch or gave offence to some king of birds or beasts? They might say that we were having military training for a rebellion, and attack us with their armies. You would be no match for them with your bamboo spears and wooden swords. We must have really sharp swords and halberds. What are we to do about it?&#8221;</P>
<P>When the monkeys heard this they all said with alarm, &#8220;Your Majesty has great foresight, but there's nowhere we can get them.&#8221; When it was the turn of four older monkeys to speak&#8212;two bare-bottomed apes and two gibbons&#8212;they came forward and said, &#8220;Your Majesty, if you want sharp weapons they can be very easily obtained.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How could it be easy?&#8221; asked Sun Wukong.</P>
<P>&#8220;To the East of our mountain,&#8221; they replied, &#8220;there is a lake some seventy miles wide that is the boundary of the country of Aolai. That country has a princely capital, and huge numbers of soldiers and civilians live in the city. It must have workshops for gold, silver, bronze and iron. If you went there, Your Majesty, you could either buy arms or get them made; then you could train us to use them in the defense of our mountain. This would give us long-term security.&#8221; Sun Wukong was delighted with the suggestion.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wait here while I go there,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>却说美猴王荣归故里，自剿了混世魔王，夺了一口大刀，逐日操演武艺，教小猴砍竹为标，削木为刀，治旗幡，打哨子，一进一退，安营下寨，顽耍多时。忽然静坐处思想道：“我等在此恐作耍成真，或惊动人王，或有禽王、兽王认此犯头，说我们操兵造反，兴师来相杀，汝等都是竹竿木刀，如何对敌？须得锋利剑戟方可。如今奈何？”众猴闻说，个个惊恐道：“大王所见甚长，只是无处可取。”正说间，转上四个老猴，两个是赤尻马猴，两个是通背猿猴，走在面前道：“大王，若要治锋利器械，甚是容易。”悟空道：“怎见容易？”四猴道：“我们这山，向东去有二百里水面，那厢乃傲来国界。那国界中有一王位，满城中军民无数，必有金银铜铁等匠作。大王若去那里，或买或造些兵器，教演我等，守护山场，诚所谓保泰长久之机也。”悟空闻说，满心欢喜道：“汝等在此顽耍，待我去来。”</p>

<P>Splendid Monkey King! He leapt on to his somersault cloud, crossed the seventy miles of lake, and saw that on the other side there was indeed a city wall, a moat, streets, markets, ten thousand houses, a thousand gates, and people coming and going in the sunlight.</P>
<P>&#8220;There must be ready-made weapons here,&#8221; Sun Wukong thought, &#8220;and getting a few by magic would be much better than buying them.&#8221; So he made a magic with his fist and said the words of the spell, sucked in some air from the Southeast, and blew it hard out again. It turned into a terrifying gale carrying sand and stones with it.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>好猴王，即纵筋斗云，霎时间过了二百里水面。果然那厢有座城池，六街三市，万户千门，来来往往，人都在光天化日之下。悟空心中想道：“这里定有现成的兵器，我待下去买他几件，还不如使个神通觅他几件倒好。”他就捻起诀来，念动咒语，向巽地上吸一口气，呼的吹将去，便是一阵狂风，飞沙走石，好惊人也——</p>

<P>Where the storm blew, the prince of Aolai fled in terror, and gates and doors were shut in the streets and markets. Nobody dared to move outside. Sun Wukong landed his cloud and rushed straight through the gates of the palace to the arsenal and the military stores, opened the doors, and saw countless weapons: swords, pikes, sabres, halberds, battleaxes, bills, scimitars, maces, tridents, clubs, bows, crossbows, forks, and spears were all there.</P>
<P>At the sight of them he said happily, &#8220;How many of these could I carry by myself? I'd better use the magic for dividing up my body.&#8221;</P>
<P>Splendid Monkey King. He plucked a hair from his body, chewed it up, spat it out, made the magic with his fist, said the words of the spell, and shouted &#8220;Change!&#8221; It turned into hundreds and thousands of little monkeys, who rushed wildly about grabbing weapons. The strong ones took six or seven each and the weaker ones two or three, and between them they removed the lot. He climbed back up on the clouds, called up a gale by magic, and took all the little monkeys home with him.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>风起处，惊散了那傲来国君王，三市六街，都慌得关门闭户，无人敢走。悟空才按下云头，径闯入朝门里，直寻到兵器馆武库中，打开门扇看时，那里面无数器械，刀枪剑戟，斧钺毛镰，鞭钯挝简，弓弩叉矛，件件俱备。一见甚喜道：“我一人能拿几何？还使个分身法搬将去罢。”好猴王，即拔一把毫毛，入口嚼烂，喷将出去，念动咒语，叫声：“变！”变做千百个小猴，都乱搬乱抢，有力的拿五七件，力小的拿三二件，尽数搬个罄净。径踏云头，弄个摄法，唤转狂风，带领小猴，俱回本处。</p>

<P>The monkeys big and small of the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit were playing outside the gates of the cave when they heard the wind. At the sight of countless monkey spirits flying through the air they fled and hid. A moment later the Handsome Monkey King landed his cloud, put away his mists, shook himself, replaced his hair, and threw all the weapons into a pile beside the mountain.</P>
<P>&#8220;Children,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;come and get your weapons.&#8221; When the monkey masses looked they saw Sun Wukong standing by himself on some level ground, and they all rushed over to him to kowtow and asked what had happened. Sun Wukong told them the whole story of how he had raised the gale and taken the weapons. After all the monkeys had thanked him they snatched sabres, grabbed swords, seized battleaxes, fought for pikes, drew bows, stretched crossbows, shouted, yelled, and so amused themselves for the rest of the day.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>却说那花果山大小猴儿，正在那洞门外顽耍，忽听得风声响处，见半空中，丫丫叉叉无边无岸的猴精，唬得都乱跑乱躲。少时，美猴王按落云头，收了云雾，将身一抖，收了毫毛，将兵器都乱堆在山前，叫道：“小的们，都来领兵器！”众猴看时，只见悟空独立在平阳之地，俱跑来叩头问故。悟空将前使狂风、搬兵器一应事说了一遍。众猴称谢毕，都去抢刀夺剑，挝斧争枪，扯弓扳弩，吆吆喝喝，耍了一日。</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<P>The next day they paraded as usual. Sun Wukong assembled all the monkey host, and they numbered over forty-seven thousand. This had alarmed all the strange beasts of the mountain&#8212;wolves, monsters, tigers, leopards, deer, muntjacs, river-deer, foxes, wild cats, badgers, raccoons, lions, elephants, horses, orangutans, bears, stags, wild boar, mountain cattle, antelopes, rhinoceroses, little dogs, huge dogs. The kings of various kinds of monsters, seventy-two in all, all came to pay homage to the Monkey King. They offered tribute every year and attended court in each of the four seasons. They also took part in drill and paid their seasonal grain levies. Everything was so orderly that the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit was as secure as an iron bucket or a wall of bronze. The kings of the monsters sent gongs, drums, coloured flags, helmets, and armour in great abundance, and every day there were military exercises.</P>
<P>One day, amid all this success, the Handsome Monkey King suddenly said to the other monkeys, &#8220;You are now expert in the bow and crossbow, and highly skilled in other weapons; but this sword of mine is too clumsy for my liking. What shall I do about it?&#8221;</P>
<P>The four veteran monkeys came forward and submitted a suggestion: &#8220;Your Majesty is an Immortal, so mortals' weapons are not good enough for you. We wonder if Your Majesty is able to travel underwater.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Since hearing the Way,&#8221; Sun Wukong replied, &#8220;I have mastered the seventy-two earthly transformations. My somersault cloud has outstanding magical powers. I know how to conceal myself and vanish. I can make spells and end them. I can reach the sky and find my way into the earth. I can travel under the sun or moon without leaving a shadow or go through metal or stone freely. I can't be drowned by water or burned by fire. There's nowhere I cannot go.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If Your Majesty has these magical powers, the stream under our iron bridge leads to the Dragon palace of the Eastern Sea. If you are willing to go down there, go and find the Dragon King and ask him for whatever weapon it is you want. Wouldn't that suit you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wait till I get back,&#8221; was Sun Wukong's delighted reply.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>次日，依旧排营。悟空会聚群猴，计有四万七千余口。早惊动满山怪兽，都是些狼虫虎豹、騃麂獐犭巴、狐狸獾狢、狮象狻猊、猩猩熊鹿、野豕山牛、羚羊青兕、狡儿神獒各样妖王，共有七十二洞，都来参拜猴王为尊。每年献贡，四时点卯。也有随班操演的，也有随节征粮的。齐齐整整，把一座花果山造得似铁桶金城。各路妖王，又有进金鼓，进彩旗，进盔甲的，纷纷攘攘，日逐家习舞兴师。美猴王正喜间，忽对众说道：“汝等弓弩熟谙，兵器精通，奈我这口刀着实榔槺，不遂我意，奈何？”四老猴上前启奏道：“大王乃是仙圣，凡兵是不堪用，但不知大王水里可能去得？”悟空道：“我自闻道之后，有七十二般地煞变化之功，筋斗云有莫大的神通，善能隐身遁身，起法摄法，上天有路，入地有门，步日月无影，入金石无碍，水不能溺，火不能焚。那些儿去不得？”四猴道：“大王既有此神通，我们这铁板桥下，水通东海龙宫。大王若肯下去，寻着老龙王，问他要件什么兵器，却不趁心？”悟空闻言甚喜道：“等我去来。”</p>

<P>Splendid Monkey King. He leapt to the end of the bridge and made a spell with his fist to ward off the water. Then he dived into the waves and split the waters to make way for himself till he reached the bed of the Eastern Sea. On his journey he saw a yaksha demon who was patrolling the sea.</P>
<P>The yaksha barred his way and asked, &#8220;What sage or divinity are you, pushing the waters aside like that? Please tell me so that I can make a report and have you properly received.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am the Heaven-born Sage Sun Wukong from the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit, and your old Dragon King's close neighbour. How is it you don't know me?&#8221;</P>
<P>When the yaksha heard this he hurried back to the crystal palace and reported, &#8220;Your Majesty, Sun Wukong, the Heaven-born Sage from the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit who says he is your neighbour, is coming to your palace.&#8221; Ao Guang, the Old Dragon King of the Eastern Sea, leapt to his feet and went out to meet Sun Wukong with his dragon sons and grandsons, his prawn soldiers, and his crab generals.</P>
<P>&#8220;Come in, exalted Immortal,&#8221; he said, taking Sun Wukong into the palace where they introduced themselves, seated him in the place of honour, and offered him tea. Then the Dragon King asked him, &#8220;Exalted Immortal, when did you find the Way, and what magic arts did you acquire?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;After my birth,&#8221; said Sun Wukong, &#8220;I renounced the world and cultivated my conduct, and thus obtained an immortal and indestructible body. Recently I have trained my sons and grandsons to guard our cave, but unfortunately I have not yet found my self a weapon. I have long heard that my illustrious neighbour enjoys the delights of a jade palace with gate-towers of cowry, and I was sure that you must have some magic weapons to spare, so I have come especially to beg one of you.&#8221;</P>
<P>Not wishing to refuse this request, the Dragon King sent Commander Perch to fetch a large sword and offer it to Sun Wukong.</P>
<P>&#8220;I don't know how to use a sword,&#8221; said Sun Wukong, &#8220;so could I ask you to give me something else?&#8221; The Old Dragon King then sent Colonel Mackerel and Guard Commander Eel to fetch a nine-pronged spear.</P>
<P>Sun Wukong leapt down from his seat, took it, tried it out, then flung it down, saying, &#8220;It's too light, far too light; and it doesn't suit me. I beg you to give me another.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Dragon King smiled as he said, &#8220;Exalted Immortal, don't you see that this weighs three thousand six hundred pounds?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It doesn't suit me, it doesn't suit me at all,&#8221; protested Sun Wukong.</P>
<P>The Dragon King, feeling frightened now, ordered Provincial Commander Bream and Garrison Commander Carp to bring out a patterned heavenly halberd for warding off spells that weighed seven thousand two hundred pounds.</P>
<P>As soon as he saw it Sun Wukong bounded forward to take it. He tried a few postures and thrusts with it then stuck it in the ground between them. &#8220;Still too light, far too light.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Dragon King, now really terrified, said, &#8220;Exalted Immortal, that halberd is the heaviest weapon in my palace.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As the old saying goes,&#8221; said Sun Wukong with a grin, &#8220;'Never think the dragon king has no treasures.' Have another look, and if you find anything satisfying I'll give you a good price for it.&#8221;</p>
<P>&#8220;I really have nothing else,&#8221; the Dragon King replied.</P>

</div>

<div class="right">
<p>好猴王，跳至桥头，使一个闭水法，捻着诀，扑的钻入波中，分开水路，径入东洋海底。正行间，忽见一个巡海的夜叉，挡住问道：“那推水来的，是何神圣？说个明白，好通报迎接。”悟空道：“吾乃花果山天生圣人孙悟空，是你老龙王的紧邻，为何不识？”那夜叉听说，急转水晶宫传报道：“大王，外面有个花果山天生圣人孙悟空，口称是大王紧邻，将到宫也。”东海龙王敖广即忙起身，与龙子龙孙、虾兵蟹将出宫迎道：“上仙请进，请进！”直至宫里相见，上坐献茶毕，问道：“上仙几时得道，授何仙术？”悟空道：“我自生身之后，出家修行，得一个无生无灭之体。近因教演儿孙，守护山洞，奈何没件兵器。久闻贤邻享乐瑶宫贝阙，必有多余神器，特来告求一件。”龙王见说，不好推辞，即着鳜都司取出一把大捍刀奉上。悟空道：“老孙不会使刀，乞另赐一件。”龙王又着鲌太尉，领鳝力士，抬出一捍九股叉来。悟空跳下来，接在手中，使了一路，放下道：“轻，轻，轻！又不趁手！再乞另赐一件。”龙王笑道：“上仙，你不曾看这叉，有三千六百斤重哩！”悟空道：“不趁手，不趁手！”龙王心中恐惧，又着鯾提督、鲤总兵抬出一柄画杆方天戟。那戟有七千二百斤重。悟空见了，跑近前接在手中，丢几个架子，撒两个解数，插在中间道：“也还轻，轻，轻！”老龙王一发害怕道：“上仙，我宫中只有这根戟重，再没什么兵器了。”悟空笑道：“古人云，愁海龙王没宝哩！你再去寻寻看。若有可意的，一一奉价。”龙王道：“委的再无。”</p>

<P>As he was speaking, his dragon wife and dragon daughters came in from the back of the palace and said, &#8220;Your Majesty, by the look of him this sage must be really somebody. The piece of miraculous iron that anchors the Milkey Way in place has been shining with a lovely rosy glow for the last few days, and creating a most auspicious atmosphere. Perhaps it has started to shine to greet this sage.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That piece of miraculous iron is one of the nails that Yu the Great used to fix the depths of rivers and seas when he brought the waters under control,&#8221; said the Dragon King. &#8220;What use could it be?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Never mind whether it's useful or not,&#8221; his wife replied. &#8220;Just give it to him and let him do with it as he pleases. At least you'll get him out of the palace.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Dragon King did as she suggested and described the piece of iron to Sun Wukong, who said, &#8220;Bring it out and let me see.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It can't be moved. You will have to go and look at it yourself, exalted Immortal.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where is it? Take me there,&#8221; said Sun Wukong.</P>
<P>The Dragon King took him into the middle of the sea treasury, where all of a sudden they could see ten thousand rays of golden light. Pointing at it, the Dragon King said, &#8220;That's it, where all the light is coming from.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sun Wukong hitched up his clothes and went to give it a feel. He found that it was an iron pillar about as thick as a measure for a peck of grain and some twenty feet long. Seizing it with both hands he said, &#8220;It's too thick and too long. If it were a bit shorter and thinner it would do.&#8221; As soon as these words were out of his mouth this precious piece of iron became several feet shorter and a few inches thinner.</P>
<P>Sun Wukong tossed it in his hands, remarking that it would be even better if it were thinner still. The precious iron thereupon became even thinner. Sun Wukong was taking it out of the sea treasury to have a look at it when he saw that it had two gold bands round it, while the middle part was made of black iron. There was a line of inlaid writing near the bands which said that it was the AS-YOU-WILL COLD-BANDED CUDGEL: WEIGHT 13,500 POUNDS.</P>
<P>Sun Wukong was delighted, though he did not show it. &#8220;I think that this little darling will do whatever I want.&#8221; As he walked along he weighed it in his hand and said reflectively, &#8220;If it were even smaller still it would be perfect.&#8221; By the time he had taken it outside it was twenty feet long and as thick as a rice bowl.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>正说处，后面闪过龙婆、龙女道：“大王，观看此圣，决非小可。我们这海藏中那一块天河定底的神珍铁，这几日霞光艳艳，瑞气腾腾，敢莫是该出现遇此圣也？”龙王道：“那是大禹治水之时，定江海浅深的一个定子，是一块神铁，能中何用？”龙婆道：“莫管他用不用，且送与他，凭他怎么改造，送出宫门便了。”老龙王依言，尽向悟空说了。悟空道：“拿出来我看。”龙王摇手道：“扛不动，抬不动！须上仙亲去看看。”悟空道：“在何处？你引我去。”龙王果引导至海藏中间，忽见金光万道。龙王指定道：“那放光的便是。”悟空撩衣上前，摸了一把，乃是一根铁柱子，约有斗来粗，二丈有余长。他尽力两手挝过道：“忒粗忒长些，再短细些方可用。”说毕，那宝贝就短了几尺，细了一围。悟空又颠一颠道：“再细些更好。”那宝贝真个又细了几分。悟空十分欢喜，拿出海藏看时，原来两头是两个金箍，中间乃一段乌铁，紧挨箍有镌成的一行字，唤做“如意金箍棒一万三千五百斤”。心中暗喜道：“想必这宝贝如人意！”一边走，一边心思口念，手颠着道：“再短细些更妙！”拿出外面，只有丈二长短，碗口粗细。</p>

<P>Watch him as he uses his magical powers to try a few routines with it, whirling all round the crystal palace. The Old Dragon King was trembling with fright, and the little dragons were scared out of their wits. Terrapins, freshwater turtles, seawater turtles and alligators drew in their heads, while fish, shrimps, lobsters and giant turtles hid their faces.</P>
<P>Holding his treasure in his hands, Sun Wukong sat down in the main hall of the palace of crystal and said with a smile to the Dragon King, &#8220;Many thanks, worthy neighbour, for your great generosity.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Old Dragon King humbly acknowledged his thanks, and Sun Wukong went on, &#8220;This piece of iron will be very useful, but there is one more thing I want to ask.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What might that be, exalted Immortal?&#8221; asked the Dragon King.</P>
<P>&#8220;If I hadn't got this cudgel, that would be the end of the matter, but as I have got it the problem is that I don't have-the clothes to go with it. What are we to do about it? If you have any armour here, I'd be most obliged if you gave me a suit.&#8221; The Dragon King said he had not any.</P>
<P>&#8220;'A guest should not have to trouble two hosts,'&#8220; said Sun Wukong. &#8220;I won't leave without one.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please try some other sea, exalted Immortal&#8212;you may find one there.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;'It's better to stay in one house than to visit three.' I beg and implore you to give me a suit.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I really don't have one,&#8221; replied the Dragon King. &#8220;If I had I would present it to you.&#8221;</P>

<P>&#8220;If you really haven't, then I'll try this cudgel out on you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't hit me, exalted Immortal, don't hit me,&#8221; pleaded the Dragon King in terror. &#8220;Let me see whether my brothers have one that they could give you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where do your brothers live?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They are Ao Qin, the Dragon King of the Southern Sea, Ao Shun, the Dragon King of the Northern Sea, and Ao Run, the Dragon King of the Southern Sea.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm damned if I'm going there: as the saying goes, 'Two in the pocket is better than three owing.' So be a good chap and give me one.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There is no need for you to go, lofty Immortal,&#8221; the Dragon King replied, &#8220;I have an iron drum and a bronze bell. In an emergency we strike them to bring my brothers here in an instant.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said Sun Wukong, &#8220;hurry up and sound them.&#8221; And indeed an alligator general struck the bell while a terrapin marshal beat the drum. </p>

<p>你看他弄神通，丢开解数，打转水晶宫里，唬得老龙王胆战心惊，小龙子魂飞魄散，龟鳖鼋鼍皆缩颈，鱼虾鳌蟹尽藏头。悟空将宝贝执在手中，坐在水晶宫殿上，对龙王笑道：“多谢贤邻厚意。”龙王道：“不敢，不敢！”悟空道：“这块铁虽然好用，还有一说。”龙王道：“上仙还有甚说？”悟空道：“当时若无此铁，倒也罢了，如今手中既拿着他，身上更无衣服相趁，奈何？你这里若有披挂，索性送我一副，一总奉谢。”龙王道：“这个却是没有。”悟空道：“一客不犯二主，若没有，我也定不出此门。”龙王道：“烦上仙再转一海，或者有之。”悟空又道：“走三家不如坐一家，千万告求一副。”龙王道：“委的没有，如有即当奉承。”悟空道：“真个没有，就和你试试此铁！”龙王慌了道：“上仙，切莫动手，切莫动手！待我看舍弟处可有，当送一副。”悟空道：“令弟何在？”龙王道：“舍弟乃南海龙王敖钦、北海龙王敖顺、西海龙王敖闰是也。”悟空道：“我老孙不去，不去！俗语谓赊三不敌见二，只望你随高就低的送一副便了。”老龙道：“不须上仙去。我这里有一面铁鼓，一口金钟，凡有紧急事，擂得鼓响，撞得钟鸣，舍弟们就顷刻而至。”悟空道：“既是如此，快些去擂鼓撞钟！”真个那鼍将便去撞钟，鳖帅即来擂鼓。</p>

<p>The sound of the bell and the drum startled the other three dragon kings, who had arrived and were waiting together outside within the instant.</p>
<P>One of them, Ao Qin, said, &#8220;Elder Brother, what's up? Why the drum and the bell?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It hurts me to tell you, brother,&#8221; the Old Dragon King replied. &#8220;There's this so-called heaven-born sage from the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit who came here this morning saying that I was his neighbour, then demanded a weapon. I offered him a steel-pronged spear but he said it was too small, and a patterned halberd that he said was too light. Then he picked up the miraculous iron that fastens the Milky Way and tried a few movements with it. Now he's sitting in the palace and demanding a suit of armour, but we haven't got one. That's why I used the bell and the drum to call you here. You three must have some armour. Please give him a suit, then we can get rid of him.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Ao Qin heard this he said in a fury, &#8220;To arms, brothers. Arrest the criminal.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No! No! It's out of the question,&#8221; said the Old Dragon King. &#8220;If that iron cudgel of his gets you you're done for, if it hits you die, if it comes close your skin is broken, and if it so much as brushes against you your sinews are smashed.&#8221;</P>

<P>Ao Run, the Dragon King of the Western Sea, said, &#8220;Second brother, you must not attack him. Instead we should put a suit of armour together for him, then send him away. We can send a memorial about it to Heaven, then Heaven will of course punish him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right,&#8221; said Ao Shun, the Dragon King of the Northern Sea. &#8220;I have a pair of lotus-root cloud-walking shoes.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've brought a suit of golden chain mail,&#8221; said Ao Run, the Dragon King of the Western Sea.</P>
<P>&#8220;And I have a phoenix-winged purple gold helmet,&#8221; added Ao Qin, the Dragon King of the Southern Sea. The Old Dragon King was very pleased, and he brought them into the palace to meet Sun Wukong and present the equipment to him.</P>
<P>Sun Wukong put on the golden helmet and the armour and the cloud-walking shoes, then charged out, waving his cudgel and saying to the dragons, &#8220;My apologies for disturbing you.&#8221; The four Dragon Kings were most indignant, but we will not go into their discussions on the protest they sent to Heaven.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>少时，钟鼓响处，果然惊动那三海龙王。须臾来到，一齐在外面会着。敖钦道：“大哥，有甚紧事，擂鼓撞钟？”老龙道：“贤弟，不好说！有一个花果山什么天生圣人，早间来认我做邻居，后要求一件兵器，献钢叉嫌小，奉画戟嫌轻，将一块天河定底神珍铁，自己拿出手，丢了些解数。如今坐在宫中，又要索什么披挂。我处无有，故响钟鸣鼓，请贤弟来。你们可有什么披挂，送他一副，打发出门去罢了。”敖钦闻言，大怒道：“我兄弟们点起兵，拿他不是！”老龙道：“莫说拿，莫说拿！那块铁，挽着些儿就死，磕着些儿就亡，挨挨儿皮破，擦擦儿筋伤！”西海龙王敖闰说：“二哥不可与他动手，且只凑副披挂与他，打发他出了门，启表奏上上天，天自诛也。”北海龙王敖顺道：“说的是。我这里有一双藕丝步云履哩。”西海龙王敖闰道：“我带了一副锁子黄金甲哩。”南海龙王敖钦道：“我有一顶凤翅紫金冠哩。”老龙大喜，引入水晶宫相见了，以此奉上。悟空将金冠、金甲、云履都穿戴停当，使动如意棒，一路打出去，对众龙道：“聒噪，聒噪！”四海龙王甚是不平，一边商议进表上奏不题。</p>

<P>Watch the Monkey King as he parts the waters and goes straight back to the iron bridge, where the four senior apes can be seen waiting for him at the head of the monkey host. Sun Wukong suddenly leapt out of the waves without a drop of water on him and gleaming with gold.</P>
<P>As he came across the bridge the monkeys were so astonished that they fell to their knees and said, &#8220;How splendid you look, Your Majesty, how splendid.&#8221; Sun Wukong, his face lit up with youthful vigor, climbed up to his throne, thrust his cudgel into the ground in their midst. The foolish monkeys all tried to grab this treasure, but it was as futile as a dragonfly trying to shake an iron tree: they were unable to move it in the slightest.</P>
<P>Biting their fingers and sticking out their tongues they said, &#8220;Grandpa, it's so heavy, how can you possibly lift it?&#8221;</P>
<P>Sun Wukong went over, lifted it with one hand, and laughed as he said to them, &#8220;Everything has its rightful owner. This little treasure has been lying in the sea treasury for goodness knows how many thousands of years, but it just happened to start shining this year. The Dragon King thought it was just a piece of ordinary iron, and said it was the miraculous treasure that holds the bed of the Milky Way in place. None of his men could move it, so he had to ask me to go and fetch it myself. It was more than twenty feet long then, and as thick as a peck-measure. When I picked it up I felt that it was too big, and it shrank till it was several times as small. I told it to get even smaller, and it did that too; then I told it to get smaller still, and it got many times smaller again. I hurried out into the light of day to look at it, and I saw that there was an inscription on it that read 'AS-YOU-WILL GOLD-BANDED CUDGEL: WEIGHT 13,500 POUNDS'. Stand aside, and I'll make it change again.&#8221;</P>
<P>Holding his treasure in his hand he said, &#8220;Shrink, shrink, shrink,&#8221; and it became as small as an embroidery needle, tiny enough to be hidden in his ear.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; the monkeys cried out in astonishment, &#8220;bring it out and play with it again.&#8221;</P>

<P>So the Monkey King brought it out of his ear again, laid it on the palm of his hand, and said, &#8220;Grow, grow, grow.&#8221; It became as thick as a peck again and twenty feet long. Now that he was really enjoying himself he bounded over the bridge and went out of the cave. Clasping his treasure he used some of his heaven and earth magic, bowed, and shouted, &#8220;Grow.&#8221;</P>
<P>He became a hundred thousand feet tall; his head was as big as a mountain, his waist like a range of hills, his eyes flashed like lightning, his mouth seemed to be a bowl of blood, and his teeth were as swords and halberds; the cudgel in his hands reached up to the Thirty-third Heaven and down to the Eighteenth Hell. The tigers, leopards and wolves, the beasts of the mountain, and the seventy-two monster kings all kowtowed and bowed in terror, trembling so much that they went out of their minds. A moment later he reverted to his proper size, turned his treasure into an embroidery needle, hid it in his ear, and went back to the cave. The panic-stricken kings of the monsters all came to offer their congratulations.</p>

<div class="right">
<p>你看这猴王，分开水道，径回铁板桥头，撺将上来，只见四个老猴，领着众猴，都在桥边等候。忽然见悟空跳出波外，身上更无一点水湿，金灿灿的，走上桥来。唬得众猴一齐跪下道：“大王，好华彩耶，好华彩耶！”悟空满面春风，高登宝座，将铁棒竖在当中。这些猴不知好歹，都来拿那宝贝，却便似蜻蜓撼铁树，分毫也不能禁动，一个个咬指伸舌道：“爷爷呀！这般重，亏你怎的拿来也！”悟空近前，舒开手一把挝起，对众笑道：“物各有主。这宝贝镇于海藏中，也不知几千百年，可可的今岁放光。龙王只认做是块黑铁，又唤做天河镇底神珍。那厮每都扛抬不动，请我亲去拿之。那时此宝有二丈多长，斗来粗细；被我挝他一把，意思嫌大，他就小了许多；再教小些，他又小了许多；再教小些，他又小了许多。急对天光看处，上有一行字，乃‘如意金箍棒一万三千五百斤’。你都站开，等我再叫他变一变着。”他将那宝贝颠在手中，叫：“小，小，小！”即时就小做一个绣花针儿相似，可以缮在耳朵里面藏下。众猴骇然叫道：“大王！还拿出来耍耍！”猴王真个去耳朵里拿出，托放掌上叫：“大，大，大！”即又大做斗来粗细，二丈长短。他弄到欢喜处，跳上桥，走出洞外，将宝贝擅在手中，使一个法天象地的神通，把腰一躬，叫声：“长！”他就长的高万丈，头如泰山，腰如峻岭，眼如闪电，口似血盆，牙如剑戟。手中那棒，上抵三十三天，下至十八层地狱，把些虎豹狼虫，满山群怪，七十二洞妖王，都唬得磕头礼拜，战兢兢魄散魂飞，霎时收了法象，将宝贝还变做个绣花针儿，藏在耳内，复归洞府，慌得那各洞妖王，都来参贺。</p>

<P>There was a great display of banners and drums, and the air resounded to the sound of gongs and bells. Rare delicacies were set out in great quantities, cups brimmed with coconut toddy and the wine of the grape, and the Monkey King feasted and drank with his people for a long time. Then training went on as before.</P>
<P>The Monkey King named the four senior apes as his four Stalwart Generals: he named the two bare-bottomed apes Marshal Ma and Marshal Liu, and called the two gibbons General Beng and General Ba. He entrusted the stockade, questions of discipline and rewards to these four. Thus freed from cares, he mounted the clouds and rode the mists, wandering round the four seas and enjoying the thousand mountains. He practiced his martial arts, visited many a hero, used his magical powers, and made a wide and distinguished circle of friends. He met with six sworn brothers of his: the Bull Demon King, the Salamander Demon King, the Roc Demon King, the Camel King, the Macaque King, and the Lion King. With him included they made seven. For days on end they talked about politics and war, passed round the goblet, strummed, sang, piped, danced, went off on days out together, and enjoyed themselves in every possible way. A journey of thousands of miles seemed to them to be no more than a walk in the courtyard. It could be said that they traveled a thousand miles in the time it takes to nod one's head, and covered three hundred with a twist of the waist.</p>

<P>One day he instructed his four Stalwart Generals to arrange a feast for the six other kings. Oxen and horses were slaughtered, sacrifices were made to Heaven and Earth, and the assembled monsters danced, sang, and drank themselves blotto. When he had seen the six kings out and tipped his senior and junior officials Sun Wukong lay himself down under the shade of the pines beside the bridge and was asleep in an instant. The four Stalwart Generals made the others stand round and guard him, and they all kept their voices down.</P>
<P>In his sleep the Handsome Monkey King saw two men approach him with a piece of paper in their hands on which was written &#8220;Sun Wukong.&#8221; Without allowing any explanations they tied up his soul and dragged it staggering along till they reached a city wall. The Monkey King, who was gradually recovering from his drunken stupor, looked up and saw an iron plate on the wall on which was inscribed WORLD OF DARKNESS in large letters.</P>
<P>In a flash of realization he said, &#8220;The World of Darkness is where King Yama lives. Why have I come here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your life in the world above is due to end now,&#8221; his escorts said, &#8220;and we were ordered to fetch you.&#8221;</P>
<P>To this the Monkey King replied, &#8220;I have gone beyond the Three Worlds, and I am no longer subject to the Five Elements. I don't come under King Yama's jurisdiction. How dare you grab me, you idiots?&#8221; But the fetchers of the dead just went on tugging at him, determined to drag him inside.</P>
<P>The Monkey King lost his temper, pulled his treasure out of his ear, and gave it a shake. It became as thick as a rice bowl. It only took a slight movement of his arm to smash the two fetchers of the dead to pulp. He untied his bonds, loosed his hands, and charged into the city whirling his cudgel, so terrifying the ox-headed and horse-faced devils that they fled in all directions for cover.</P>
<P>All the devil soldiers rushed to the Senluo Palace and reported, &#8220;Your Majesty, disaster, disaster! A hairy-faced thunder-god is attacking us out there.&#8221;</p>

<div class="right">
<p>一日，在本洞分付四健将安排筵宴，请六王赴饮，杀牛宰马，祭天享地，着众怪跳舞欢歌，俱吃得酩酊大醉。送六王出去，却又赏牜劳大小头目，尚在铁板桥边松阴之下，霎时间睡着。四健将领众围护，不敢高声。只见那美猴王睡里见两人拿一张批文，上有“孙悟空”三字，走近身，不容分说，套上绳就把美猴王的魂灵儿索了去，踉踉跄跄，直带到一座城边。猴王渐觉酒醒，忽抬头观看，那城上有一铁牌，牌上有三个大字，乃“幽冥界”。美猴王顿然醒悟道：“幽冥界乃阎王所居，何为到此？”那两人道：“你今阳寿该终，我两人领批，勾你来也。”猴王听说，道：“我老孙超出三界外，不在五行中，已不伏他管辖，怎么朦胧，又敢来勾我？”那两个勾死人只管扯扯拉拉，定要拖他进去。那猴王恼起性来，耳朵中掣出宝贝，幌一幌，碗来粗细，略举手，把两个勾死人打为肉酱。自解其索，丢开手，轮着棒，打入城中。唬得那牛头鬼东躲西藏，马面鬼南奔北跑，众鬼卒奔上森罗殿，报着：“大王，祸事，祸事！外面一个毛脸雷公，打将来了！”</p>

<P>Stricken by panic, the Ten Kings who sit in the ten palaces, judging the criminal cases of the dead, hurriedly straightened their clothing and went out to look. When they saw his ferocious expression they lined up in order and shouted at the tops of their voices, &#8220;Please tell us your name, exalted Immortal.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you don't know who I am,&#8221; replied the Monkey King, &#8220;then why did you send men to bring me here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We wouldn't dare do such a thing. The messengers must have made a mistake.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am Sun Wukong, the Heaven-born sage of the Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. What are your posts?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We are the ten kings.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Tell me your names at once if you don't want a bashing.&#8221;</P>
<P>To this the ten kings replied, &#8220;We are the King of Qinguang, the King of Chujiang, King Songdi, King Wuguan, King Yama, King Impartial, the King of Mount Tai, the Metropolitan King, the King of Biancheng, and the King of the Ever-turning Wheel.&#8221;</P>

<P>To this Sun Wukong replied, &#8220;You are all kings, and have esoteric understanding, so why don't you know any better? I, Sun Wukong, have cultivated the Way of Immortality and will live as long as Heaven. I've soared beyond the Three Worlds and leapt outside the Five Elements, so why did you send your men to get me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please don't be angry, lofty Immortal,&#8221; the ten kings said. &#8220;Many people in the world share the same name, so perhaps the fetchers of the dead went to the wrong place.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Nonsense, nonsense. As the saying goes, 'The magistrate may be wrong and the sergeant may be wrong, but the man who comes to get you is never wrong.' Go and get the Register of Life and Death for me to see.&#8221; The Ten Kings invited him to come into the palace and look through it.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>慌得那十代冥王急整衣来看，见他相貌凶恶，即排下班次，应声高叫道：“上仙留名，上仙留名！”猴王道：“你既认不得我，怎么差人来勾我？”十王道：“不敢，不敢！想是差人差了。”猴王道：“我本是花果山水帘洞天生圣人孙悟空。你等是什么官位？”十王躬身道：“我等是阴间天子十代冥王。”悟空道：“快报名来，免打！”十王道：“我等是秦广王、楚江王、宋帝王、仵官王、阎罗王、平等王、泰山王、都市王、卞城王、转轮王。”悟空道：“汝等既登王位，乃灵显感应之类，为何不知好歹？我老孙修仙了道，与天齐寿，超升三界之外，跳出五行之中，为何着人拘我？”十王道：“上仙息怒。普天下同名同姓者多，敢是那勾死人错走了也？”悟空道：“胡说，胡说！常言道，官差吏差，来人不差。你快取生死簿子来我看！”十王闻言，即请上殿查看。</p>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<P>Sun Wukong went into the Senluo Palace with his club in his hand, and sat down in the middle of the hall facing South. The Ten Kings then ordered the presiding judge to fetch the register, and the judge hastened to his office and brought out five or six documents and ten registers. He looked through them all one by one, but could not find Sun Wukong's name in the sections devoted to hairless creatures, hairy creatures, feathered creatures, insects, or scaly creatures. Then he looked through the monkey section. Now although monkeys looked like men, they were not entered under the humans; although they were like the hairless creatures, they did not live within their boundaries; although they were like running animals, they were not under the jurisdiction of the unicorn; and although they were like birds, they were not ruled by the phoenix. There was another register, and Sun Wukong looked through this one himself. Under &#8220;Soul No. 1350&#8221; was the name of Sun Wukong, the Heaven-born stone monkey, who was destined to live to the age of 342 and die a good death.</P>
<P>&#8220;I won't write down any number of years,&#8221; said Sun Wukong. &#8220;I'll just erase my name and be done with it. Bring me a brush.&#8221; The judge hastily handed him a brush and thick, black ink.</P>
<P>Sun Wukong took the register, crossed out all the names in the monkey section, and threw it on the floor with the words, &#8220;The account's closed. That's an end of it. We won't come under your control any longer.&#8221; Then he cudgeled his way out of the World of Darkness. The Ten Kings dared not go near him, and they all went to the Azure Cloud Palace to bow in homage to the Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha and discuss the report they would send up to Heaven. But we will not go into this.</p>

<div class="right">
<p>悟空执着如意棒，径登森罗殿上，正中间南面坐下。十王即命掌案的判官取出文簿来查。那判官不敢怠慢，便到司房里，捧出五六簿文书并十类簿子，逐一查看。皞虫、毛虫、羽虫、昆虫、鳞介之属，俱无他名。又看到猴属之类，原来这猴似人相，不入人名；似甗虫，不居国界；似走兽，不伏麒麟管；似飞禽，不受凤凰辖。另有个簿子，悟空亲自检阅，直到那魂字一千三百五十号上，方注着孙悟空名字，乃天产石猴，该寿三百四十二岁，善终。悟空道：“我也不记寿数几何，且只消了名字便罢，取笔过来！”那判官慌忙捧笔，饱掭浓墨。悟空拿过簿子，把猴属之类，但有名者一概勾之。螟下簿子道：“了帐，了帐！今番不伏你管了！”一路棒打出幽冥界。那十王不敢相近，都去翠云宫，同拜地藏王菩萨，商量启表，奏闻上天，不在话下。</p>

<P>After charging out through the city wall the Monkey King tripped over a clump of grass, tried to regain his balance, and woke up with a start. It had all been a dream. As he stretched himself he heard his four Stalwart Generals and the other monkeys saying, &#8220;Your Majesty, time to wake up. You drank too much and slept all night.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Never mind about my sleeping. I dreamt that two men came for me. They dragged me to the city-wall of the World of Darkness, where I came round. I showed them my magic powers and went yelling all the way to the Senluo Palace, where I had an argument with those Ten Kings and looked through the Register of Life and Death of us. Wherever there was mention of your names in the register, I crossed them out. We won't come under the jurisdiction of those idiots any more.&#8221;</P>
<P>All the monkeys kowtowed to him in gratitude. The reason why from that time on so many mountain monkeys have never grown old is that their names are not on the books of the officials of the Underworld. When the Handsome Monkey King had finished telling his story, the four Stalwart Generals informed the other monster kings, who all came to offer their felicitations. A few days later his six sworn brothers also came to congratulate him, and all were delighted to hear how he had struck the names off the books. We will not describe the daily feasts that followed.</p>

<p>这猴王打出城中，忽然绊着一个草纥繨，跌了个蝤踵，猛的醒来，乃是南柯一梦。才觉伸腰，只闻得四健将与众猴高叫道：“大王，吃了多少酒，睡这一夜还不醒来？”悟空道：“醒还小可，我梦见两个人来此勾我，把我带到幽冥界城门之外，却才醒悟。是我显神通，直嚷到森罗殿，与那十王争吵，将我们的生死簿子看了，但有我等名号，俱是我勾了，都不伏那厮所辖也。”众猴磕头礼谢。自此，山猴多有不老者，以阴司无名故也。美猴王言毕前事，四健将报知各洞妖王，都来贺喜。不几日，六个义兄弟，又来拜贺，一闻销名之故，又个个欢喜，每日聚乐不题。</p>

<P>the Humble Dragon of the Eastern Sea of the Eastern Continent of Superior Body in the Nether Watery Regions</P>
<P>Reports to the Jade Emperor of the Azure Vault of Heaven</P>


<P>Recently one Sun Wukong, an immortal fiend born on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit now living in the Water Curtain Cave, bullied this humble dragon and occupied my watery house by force. He demanded a weapon by displaying magical prowess; he insisted on having armour by showing off his evil powers. He terrified the watery tribe and made the tortoises and alligators flee in terror. The dragon of the Southern Sea trembled, the dragon of the Western Sea was made miserable, the dragon of the Northern Sea had to hang his head and come in submission, and I, your subject Ao Guang, humbled myself before him. We had to present him with a miraculous iron cudgel, a golden phoenix-winged helmet, a suit of chain mail, and a pair of cloud-walking shoes; and we escorted him out politely.</P>
<P>He continued to show off his martial arts and magic powers, and all he had to say for himself was, &#8220;My apologies for disturbing you.&#8221; There is truly no match for him, and he is uncontrollable. Your subject now presents this memorial, and respectfully awaits your sage decision. I humbly beg that heavenly soldiers be sent to arrest this evil demon, so that the sea and the mountains may be at peace, and the ocean may enjoy tranquillity.</p>

<P>When the Jade Emperor had read this through he ordered, &#8220;Let the Dragon God return to the Sea; we shall send generals to arrest the demon.&#8221; The Old Dragon King bowed till his head touched the floor and took his leave.</P>
<P>Then the Venerable Immortal Ge, a heavenly teacher, reported, &#8220;Your Majesty, the King of Qinguang, one of the ministers of the Underworld, has come with a memorial from the Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha.&#8221; A jade girl messenger took the memorial, which the Jade Emperor read through. It ran:</p>

<p>圣帝览毕，传旨：“着龙神回海，朕即遣将擒拿。”老龙王顿首谢去。下面又有葛仙翁天师启奏道：“万岁，有冥司秦广王赍奉幽冥教主地藏王菩萨表文进上。”旁有传言玉女，接上表文，玉皇亦从头看过。表曰：</p>

<P>The regions of darkness are the negative part of the Earth. Heaven contains gods while the Earth has devils; Positive and Negative are in a constant cycle. Birds and beasts are born and die; male and female alternate. Life is created and change takes place; male and female are conceived and born; this is the order of nature, and it cannot be changed. Now the evil spirit, the Heaven-born monkey of the Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit, is presently giving full rein to his wicked nature, committing murders, and refusing to submit to discipline. He killed the devil messengers of the Ninth Hell with his magic, and he terrified the Ten Benevolent Kings of the Underworld with his power. He made an uproar in the Senluo Palace and crossed some names out by force. He has made the race of monkeys completely uncontrollable, and given eternal life to the macaques. He has annulled the law of transmigration and brought them beyond birth and death. I, impoverished monk that I am, importune the might of Heaven by presenting this memorial. I prostrate myself to beg that Heavenly soldiers be despatched to subdue this fiend, bring the positive and Negative back into order, and give lasting security to the Underworld.</P>

<P>His Celestial Majesty then asked all his civil and military officials, &#8220;When was this monkey demon born? What is his origin, that he should have such powers?&#8221;</P>
<P>Before he had finished speaking, Thousand-mile Eye and Wind-accompanying Ear came forward from the ranks of officials and said, &#8220;This demon monkey is the stone monkey who was born of heaven three hundred years ago. At the time nobody paid any attention to him, and we do not know where he refined himself and became an Immortal in recent years, so that he has been able to make the tigers and dragons submit to him and to strike his name off the register of the dead.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Which divine general shall be sent down to capture him?&#8221; asked the Jade Emperor, and before he had finished speaking the Great White Planet<SUP></SUP> stepped forward, bowed down, and submitted, &#8220;All beings in the upper worlds that have nine apertures can become Immortals. This monkey has a body that was created by Heaven and Earth and conceived by the sun and moon. His head touches they sky and his feet stand on the earth; he drinks the dew and eats the mist. How does he differ from humans, if he has succeeded in cultivating the way of immortality and can subdue dragons and tigers? I beg Your Majesty to remember your life-giving mercy and hand down a sage edict of amnesty and enlistment, summoning him to this upper world and inscribing his name on the list of officeholders, thus keeping him here under control. If he obeys Your Majesty's heavenly commands, he can later be promoted; and if he disobeys, he can be arrested. This will both avoid military operations and be a way of winning over an Immortal.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Jade Emperor, delighted with the suggestion, ordered that it should be put into effect. He told the Wenqu Star Officer to compose the edict, and commanded the Great White planet to persuade the monkey to accept the amnesty.</p>

<p>大天尊宣众文武仙卿，问曰：“这妖猴是几年产育，何代出身，却就这般有道？”一言未已，班中闪出千里眼、顺风耳道：“这猴乃三百年前天产石猴。当时不以为然，不知这几年在何方修炼成仙，降龙伏虎，强销死籍也。”玉帝道：“那路神将下界收伏？”言未已，班中闪出太白长庚星俯伏启奏道：“上圣三界中，凡有九窍者，皆可修仙。奈此猴乃天地育成之体，日月孕就之身，他也顶天履地，服露餐霞，今既修成仙道，有降龙伏虎之能，与人何以异哉？臣启陛下，可念生化之慈恩，降一道招安圣旨，把他宣来上界，授他一个大小官职，与他籍名在箓，拘束此间。若受天命，后再升赏；若违天命，就此擒拿。一则不动众劳师，二则收仙有道也。”玉帝闻言甚喜，道：“依卿所奏。”即着文曲星官修诏，着太白金星招安。</p>

<P>The Great White Planet left Heaven by the Southern Gate, and brought his propitious cloud down by the Water Curtain Cave, where he said to the little monkeys, &#8220;I am an envoy from Heaven, and I am carrying a divine edict inviting your great king to the upper world. Go and tell him at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>The little monkeys outside conveyed the message by relays into the depths of the cave: &#8220;Your Majesty, there's an old man outside carrying a document on his back. He says he's an envoy from Heaven with an invitation for you.&#8221; The Handsome Monkey King was delighted.</P>
<P>He said, &#8220;I'd been thinking of going up to Heaven to have a look round for the past couple of days, and now a heavenly envoy has come to invite me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Ask him in at once,&#8221; he shouted, hastily straightening his clothes and going out to meet the envoy.</P>
<P>The Planet came straight in, stood facing the South, and said, &#8220;I am the Great White Planet of the West, and I have come down to earth with an Edict of Amnesty and enlistment from the Jade Emperor to invite you to Heaven to be given office as an Immortal.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am very grateful to you, venerable Planet, for condescending to come here,&#8221; replied Sun Wukong with a smile; then he told his subjects to prepare a feast to entertain the visitor.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm afraid I can't delay,&#8221; replied the Planet, &#8220;as I am carrying a divine edict, so may I ask Your Majesty to come back with me now? We can talk at leisure after your glorious elevation.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Thank you for coming,&#8221; said Sun Wukong. &#8220;I'm sorry you couldn't take some refreshments before leaving.&#8221; Then he called for his four Stalwart Generals and ordered them, &#8220;Give my sons and grandsons a thorough training. When I've had a look round in Heaven, I'll take you all to live with me up there.&#8221; The four Stalwart Generals accepted their orders, and the Monkey King made his cloud carry him up above the clouds. He was</P>


<P>Raised to a high-ranking heavenly office,</P>
<P>Listed among the courtiers in the clouds.</P>


<P>If you don't know what office he was given, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>金星领了旨，出南天门外，按下祥云，直至花果山水帘洞，对众小猴道：“我乃天差天使，有圣旨在此，请你大王上界。快快报知！”洞外小猴，一层层传至洞天深处，道：“大王，外面有一老人，背着一角文书，言是上天差来的天使，有圣旨请你也。”美猴王听得大喜道：“我这两日正思量要上天走走，却就有天使来请。”叫：“快请进来！”猴王急整衣冠，门外迎接。金星径入当中，面南立定道：“我是西方太白金星，奉玉帝招安圣旨下界，请你上天，拜受仙箓。”悟空笑道：“多谢老星降临。”教：“小的们！安排筵宴款待。”金星道：“圣旨在身，不敢久留，就请大王同往，待荣迁之后，再从容叙也。”悟空道：“承光顾，空退，空退！”即唤四健将，分付：“谨慎教演儿孙，待我上天去看看路，却好带你们上去同居住也。”四健将领诺。这猴王与金星纵起云头，升在空霄之上。正是那：高迁上品天仙位，名列云班宝箓中。毕竟不知授个什么官爵，且听下回分解。</p>
