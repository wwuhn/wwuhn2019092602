<P>The Dhyana Master Conceives after Eating a Meal</P>
<P>The Yellow-Wife Brings Waster to Remove a Devil Foetus</P>
</div>
<P>Eight hundred kinds of virtue must be cultivated,</P>
<P>Three thousand good deeds must be secretly performed.</P>
<P>Do not distinguish objects from self, or friend from foe:</P>
<P>That conforms with the teaching of the Western Heaven.</P>
<P>The rhinoceros demon feared no weapons;</P>
<P>No blame attached to the failure of water and fire.</P>
<P>Lord Lao Zi subdued him and took him to Heaven,</P>
<P>Turning the buffalo round with a smile.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story goes on to tell who was calling by the wayside. The mountain god and local deity of Mount Jindou came out carrying a bowl of purple gold. &#8220;Holy monk,&#8221; they said, &#8220;this bowl of rice was begged by the Great Sage Monkey from a pious household. You fell into the clutches of an evil demon because you would not heed good advice, putting the Great Sage to endless trouble before he was finally able to free you today. Please eat this food before continuing on your way, and do not be ungrateful for the Great Sage's respect and sense of duty.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am very grateful to you, disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;and I cannot find words to express all my thanks. If I had realized before that I should not step out of the circle I would never have been in such danger of being killed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I tell you frankly, Master,&#8221; said Brother Monkey, &#8220;that because you did not trust the ring I drew you ended up the victim of someone else's ring. It caused so much trouble and suffering. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean about another ring?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;It was all your fault, you evil-tongued cretin, for getting the master into that terrible danger,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I had to turn heaven and earth upside down to fetch heavenly soldiers, water, fire, and even the Buddha's cinnabar sand, all of which was caught by his gleaming white ring. It was only because the Buddha gave a hint to the arhats who told me where the demon had come from that I could fetch Lord Lao Zi to subdue him. He was a water-buffalo turned demon.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Good disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang with infinite gratitude when he heard this, &#8220;after this experience I shall definitely take your advice in future.&#8221; The four of them then ate the steaming food. &#8220;Why is this rice still hot after such a long time?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;I heated it up myself when I knew that the Great Sage had succeeded,&#8221; replied the local deity on his knees. The food was soon eaten, after which they put the bowl away and took their leave of the local deity and the mountain god. The master remounted and they crossed the high mountain. Their minds freed from worries, they returned to true perception; dining on the wind and sleeping in the dew they continued to the West. When they had been travelling for a long time it was once again early spring. They heard</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The soft call of swallows,</P>
<P>The beauty of orioles.</P>
<P>The soft call of swallows tiring their fragrant voices;</P>
<P>The beauty of orioles and their frequent song.</P>
<P>The land is covered with flowers like brocade,</P>
<P>The emerald-green hills seem piled with cushions.</P>
<P>Fruit forms on the greengage trees on the ridge,</P>
<P>While an ancient cypress holds a cloud before the scar.</P>
<P>Pale is the misty light on the fertile plain;</P>
<P>Warm sands are bathed in the glow of sunset.</P>
<P>Orchards and trees now break into blossom;</P>
<P>Willows grow new shoots as the spring returns.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As they were walking along they came to a little river in which the water flowed cool, pure and deep. When he reined in his horse for a better look the Tang Priest could make out some of the roof of a thatched cottage under the green shade of willows. &#8220;That must be a ferryman's house,&#8221; said Monkey, pointing at the cottage. &#8220;It looks likely enough,&#8221; replied Sanzang, &#8220;but I would not like to be too sure as I cannot see any boat.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Ferryman!&#8221; yelled Pig at the top of his voice, putting the luggage down. &#8220;Bring the boat over.&#8221; After a number of these shouts a rowing boat came creaking out from under the willows and was soon near their bank. When they looked carefully this is what they saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Short oars dividing the waves,</P>
<P>Lightly skimming on the water.</P>
<P>The hull is painted in many colours,</P>
<P>Enclosing a full hold.</P>
<P>Iron chains are neatly coiled in the bows,</P>
<P>And bright is the tiller in the stern.</P>
<P>Although the skiff is only as light as a reed</P>
<P>It is the equal of an ocean-going vessel.</P>
<P>It may have no ivory mast or silken rigging,</P>
<P>But it does have cassia oars and a sternpost of pine.</P>
<P>Indeed this is no ship for mighty voyages,</P>
<P>Just a ferry fit to cross a single stream,</P>
<P>Coming and going between the river's banks,</P>
<P>Never leaving the ancient crossing place.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The boat was soon at the bank, &#8220;This way to cross the river,&#8221; called the boatman. Urging the horse forward for a closer look, Sanzang saw that the boatman looked like this:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A head wrapped in a toweling cloth,</P>
<P>Feet in black shoes of silk.</P>
<P>Many a patch on cotton-padded tunic and trousers,</P>
<P>And around the waist was a much-stitched cotton apron.</P>
<P>Horny skin on the hands, and muscles hard,</P>
<P>Eyes dim, a wrinkled brow, and an aged face.</P>
<P>But the voice was a melodious as an oriole's song;</P>
<P>At a closer look she was clearly an old woman.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do you do the ferrying?&#8221; asked Monkey, approaching the boat.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the woman replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why isn't the ferryman here?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;Why has he left it to his wife to pole the boat?&#8221;</P>
<P>The woman smiled and said nothing as she put the gangplank into position. Friar Sand carried the luggage aboard while Monkey helped the master on then followed himself. Pig led the horse on, after which the plank was stowed. The woman pushed off and quickly rowed them across the river.</P>
<P>When they were on the Western bank Sanzang told Friar Sang to open one of the bundles and take out some coins to give her. The ferry woman did not argue about the amount, but moored the boat by its painter to a stake beside the water and went back into her cottage chuckling.</P>
<P>As he was thirsty and the water was so clear Sanzang said to Pig, &#8220;Get the bowl and fetch me some water to drink.&#8221; Pig did as he was told and handed the water to his master, who drank only about a third of it, leaving two-thirds for the idiot to snatch and down in a single draft before helping the master back on his horse.</P>
<P>Master and disciples had been going less than an hour on the road West when Sanzang started to groan, &#8220;My stomach's hurting.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've got the bellyache too,&#8221; said Pig, who was behind him.</P>
<P>&#8220;It must be because you drank cold water,&#8221; said Friar Sand, only to be interrupted by groans of &#8220;It's agony!&#8221; from his master and Pig. The two of them were in unbearable pain and their abdomens were gradually swelling. When they felt with their hands there was something like a lump of flesh and blood moving and jerking around incessantly. Sanzang was feeling very unsteady when he noticed two bundles of straw hanging from the top of a tree in a village by the road.</P>
<P>&#8220;That's good, Master,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;There's a wineshop there. I'll go and beg you some hot water and find out if anyone sells medicine there and will let you have some medicine to ease your pain.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang was very pleased with the suggestion, so he whipped the white horse forward and was soon at the gates of the village, where he dismounted. An old woman was sitting on a bundle of straw outside the gates twisting hempen thread. Monkey went up to her, put his hands together in front of his chest in greeting, and said, &#8220;We monks have come from the Great Tang in the East. My master is the Tang Emperor's younger brother, and he has a stomachache because he drank some water from a river.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Which river did you drink from?&#8221; asked the old woman, laughing aloud.</P>
<P>&#8220;From the clear river to the East of here,&#8221; replied Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;What a laugh,&#8221; chuckled the old woman, &#8220;what a laugh! Come inside and I'll explain.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey supported Sanzang while Friar Sand helped pig into the thatched cottage where they sat down. The two of them were groaning in agony from their protruding bellies, their faces sallow and their foreheads creased with frowns. &#8220;Please boil some water for my master, missus,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;He must have it, and I'll be very grateful.&#8221;</P>
<P>Instead of doing this she went into the back of the house, still chuckling, and called, &#8220;Come and see, come and see!&#8221; There was a slap of sandals inside as two or three middle-aged women came out to stare at Sanzang with grins across their faces. This made Monkey so angry that he shouted and bared his teeth at them, sending them all scurrying and stumbling inside in terror.</P>
<P>Monkey went after them, grabbed the old woman, and said, &#8220;Boil some water this minute and I'll spare your life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; said the old woman, &#8220;hot water won't be any use. I can't do anything to help those two with their bellyaches. If you let me go I'll tell you all about it.&#8221; When Monkey released her she continued, &#8220;This is the Womanland of Western Liang. All of us in this country are female, and there isn't a man among us, which is why we were so pleased to see you. It's terrible that the reverend father has drank from that river, which is called the Motherhood River. There is a Male-welcoming Post Station outside our capital with a Pregnancy-revealing Spring. In this country we only dare drink of the river's water when we reach the age of twenty. After drinking it we feel the stomach pains of pregnancy. Three days later we go to the Pregnancy-revealing Spring at the Male-welcoming Post Station. If we see a double reflection in the waters we give birth to a child. Because your master has drunk from the Motherhood River he's pregnant. He's going to have a baby soon. What will a hot drink do to help that?&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang went pale with shock at the news.</P>
<P>&#8220;What am I to do, disciple?&#8221; he asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm going to have a child, but I'm a man,&#8221; said Pig, writhing around in his agony. &#8220;Where will the child come out? How am I to give birth to it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As the old saying goes, a melon falls when it's ripe,&#8221; replied Monkey with a laugh. &#8220;When the time comes a hole will open under your ribs for it to be born through.&#8221;</P>
<P>This conversation made Pig shake with fear, and the pain was more than he could bear. &#8220;I can't take any more,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I can't take any more. I'm dying, I'm dying.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop fidgeting, brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand with a grin, &#8220;stop fidgeting or else you'll get the umbilical cord in a twist and be ill before the birth.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot's panic was now worse than ever as with tears in his eyes he held on to Monkey and said, &#8220;Brother, ask the old lady where there are midwives with a gentle touch and send for some. The pains are coming very close to each other now. They must be labor pains. It'll be very soon now.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If they're labor pains, brother, you'd better stop writhing about if you don't want your waters to break,&#8221; said Friar Sand, still grinning.</P>
<P>&#8220;My good lady,&#8221; groaned Sanzang, &#8220;are there any doctors round here? Send one of my disciples to buy some medicine that will make me abort.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Medicine won't be any use,&#8221; said the old woman. &#8220;There's a Miscarriage Spring in Childfree Cave in Mount Offspring Dissolved on the road due South from here. To end your pregnancy you must drink the water of that spring. But the spring water cannot be had now as a Taoist called the As-you-will Immortal came here the other year and changed the Childfree Cave to the Hermitage of Immortals. He's hoarding the waters of Miscarriage Spring, which he won't give away. Anyone who wants water must take him rich gifts. You have to offer mutton, wine and fruit, and be very reverent indeed before you can get a bowl of the water from him. You travelling monks couldn't possibly afford to do all that, so you'll just have to let fate take its course and have the babies when your time comes.&#8221; Monkey, who was very pleased to learn all this, then asked how far it was to Mount Offspring Dissolved. &#8220;Ten miles,&#8221; the old woman replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Fine,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;You can stop worrying, Master. I'll go and get you some of the water.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Look after the master properly,&#8221; said the splendid Great Sage in his parting instructions to Friar Sand, &#8220;and if the people here try to bully him use your old trick of pulling a face to scare them till I get back with the water.&#8221;</P>
<P>Friar Sand was preparing to do as he was told when the old woman came out with a big earthenware bowl that she gave to Monkey. &#8220;Take this and fetch as much as you can,&#8221; she said, &#8220;so that we can keep some for emergencies.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey left the thatched cottage with the bowl in his hands and was off on his cloud, at which the old woman bowed to the sky and said, &#8220;That monk can ride on clouds, my lord.&#8221; Then she went inside and called the other women out to kowtow to the Tang Priest. They started calling him &#8220;arhat&#8221; and &#8220;Bodhisattva,&#8221; boiled water and prepared a meal to offer him.</P>
<P>Monkey's somersault cloud soon brought him within sight of a mountain that blocked his cloud, so he brought it down to gaze at the superb mountain. He saw</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A brocade of subtle blossoms,</P>
<P>Wild flowers spreading a green carpet,</P>
<P>Streams running into each other,</P>
<P>Brooks and clouds both at their ease.</P>
<P>Dense grow the creepers in many a valley,</P>
<P>And trees are packed close on a distant ridge.</P>
<P>While songbirds call wild geese fly over,</P>
<P>Deer drink, and gibbons climb.</P>
<P>The green line of peaks stands like a screen;</P>
<P>The blue rock face is shaped like a topknot.</P>
<P>It is hard to reach it across the drifting sands;</P>
<P>None could tire of watching the waterfall.</P>
<P>Taoist boys roam in search of herbs;</P>
<P>Foresters return with loads of firewood.</P>
<P>It is a worthy rival to Mount Tiantai,</P>
<P>And better than the threefold Huashan summit.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As the Great Sage was looking at the mountain he saw a farmhouse on its Northern slope from where the barking of dogs could be heard. The Great Sage went straight down the mountainside to the farm, which was indeed a splendid place:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A bridge across a lively stream,</P>
<P>A cottage sheltered by the hill,</P>
<P>Dogs barking by the broken fence,</P>
<P>A recluse who comes and goes at will.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey was soon at the gate, where he saw an old Taoist sitting on a green cushion. Putting down the earthenware bowl, Monkey went forward to greet him. The Taoist returned his greeting with a bow from where he sat and asked, &#8220;Where have you come from? What business brings you here to this hermitage?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have been sent by the emperor of the Great Tang in the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven,&#8221; Brother Monkey replied. &#8220;My master's belly is unbearably painful and swollen because he drank some of the water of the Motherhood River. When we asked the local people they said it was because he is pregnant, and that there is no cure for this apart from the Miscarriage Spring in Childfree Cave in Mount Offspring Dissolved. So I have come especially to pay my respects to the As-you-will Immortal and beg him for some of the spring water with which to save my master. Could you be so kind as to show me the way?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This was Childfree Cave,&#8221; said the Taoist with a smile, &#8220;but now it's called the Hermitage of Immortals. I am none other than the senior disciple of my master the As-you-will Immortal. Tell me your name and I will announce you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am the senior disciple of the Patriarch Tang Sanzang,&#8221; said Monkey politely, &#8220;and my name is Sun Wukong.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are your presents, your wine and your offerings?&#8221; the Taoist asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm only a passing itinerant monk,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;so I haven't been able to arrange them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Fool!&#8221; said the Taoist with a laugh. &#8220;My master controls the spring and never gives any thing away for nothing. You'd better go and fetch your offerings if you want me to announce you, or else go away and forget about it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;People will do more as a favour than on the emperor's command,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Go and tell him my name and he's bound to do me this favour. He might even give me the whole spring.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Taoist went in to report all this to the immortal, who was playing his<I> qin</I> zither, and waited till he had finished before saying, &#8220;Master, there's a Buddhist monk outside who says he's Sun Wukong, the senior disciple of Tang Sanzang. He is asking for some of the water of the Miscarriage Spring to save his master with.&#8221; Had the immortal not been told this the matter would have ended there, but at the name of Sun Wukong anger surged up from his heart and evil grew from his gall. He sprang to his feet, stepped down from the low table on which he was playing the<I> qin,</I> changed from his informal clothes into his Taoist robes, and rushed out through the gates of his hermitage with his As-You-Will hook in his hands. &#8220;Where is Sun Wukong?&#8221; he shouted, and Monkey turned to see that he looked like this:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On his head was a star-crown of many colours,</P>
<P>And his magic robe was red with threads of gold.</P>
<P>The cloud-shoes on his feet were thickly embroidered;</P>
<P>The jade belt at his waist was delicately worked.</P>
<P>His wave-treading hosiery was of brocade,</P>
<P>And glimpses showed of a silk velvet underskirt.</P>
<P>He held a golden As-You-Will hook,</P>
<P>Long-handled with a base shaped like a dragon.</P>
<P>Bright were his phoenix eyes, and lotus-like his brows;</P>
<P>Steel-sharp were his teeth, and his lips bright crimson.</P>
<P>He looked more evil still than Marshal Wen</P>
<P>Although he wore a different kind of dress.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Monkey saw him he put his hands together and said, &#8220;My name, sir, is Sun Wukong.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Are you really Sun Wukong,&#8221; said the Taoist master with a smile, &#8220;or are you just pretending to be?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a thing to ask, sir! As the saying goes, a gentleman never changes his name whether he's travelling or staying at home.<I> I</I> am indeed Sun Wukong. Why should<I> I</I> want to pretend?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do you know who<I> I</I> am?&#8221; the Taoist master asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I've been converted to the Buddhist faith and follow Buddhist teachings,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;I've grown distant from the friends of my child hood on this long journey and I haven't visited any. I'm afraid I don't quite recognize you. I only know your name because the people in the village West of Motherhood River told me that you are the As-you-will Immortal.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're busy on your journey, and I am busy cultivating my true arts,&#8221; the Taoist replied, &#8220;so why have you come to see me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Because my master is pregnant and has a belly ache after mistakenly drinking water from the Motherhood River,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I've come to your immortal abode to beg you for a bowl of water from the Miscarriage Spring with which to deliver him from his agony.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Is your master Tang Sanzang?&#8221; asked the Taoist with an angry glare.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said Brother Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Did you ever meet the Boy Sage King?&#8221; asked the Taoist, gnashing his teeth with hatred.</P>
<P>&#8220;That was the title of the demon Red Boy in the Fire-cloud Cave by Withered Pine Ravine on Mount Hao,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Why are you asking about him, immortal?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He is my nephew,&#8221; the immortal replied. &#8220;I am the brother of the Bull Demon King. He wrote me a letter telling me how Sun Wukong, the vicious senior disciple of Tang Sanzang, destroyed the boy. It was my great regret that I had no way of taking revenge on you here, but now you've come to my door begging for water.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You are mistaken, sir,&#8221; said Monkey, putting on a smile. &#8220;Your respected elder brother used to be a friend of mine, and we were two of seven sworn brothers in my youth. The only reason I did not come to pay my respects earlier was because I did not know your address. Your good nephew has done very well. He's now serving the Bodhisattva Guanyin as the page Sudhana. He's much better off than the rest of us, so why be so angry with me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Damned ape!&#8221; shouted the Taoist master. &#8220;How dare you argue like that? Is my nephew better off as a slave than he was when he enjoyed the delights of being a king? Learn to behave yourself, and try a taste of my hook.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey parried with his iron cudgel and said, &#8220;Don't talk about fighting. Give me some of the spring water instead.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Vicious ape,&#8221; the Taoist master said again, &#8220;you don't know whether you want to live or die. If you can hold out against me for three rounds I'll give you your water, but if you can't I shall avenge my nephew by cutting you up and stewing you in soy sauce.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll get you, you impudent and evil creature,&#8221; replied the Great Sage. &#8220;If you want a fight try my cudgel.&#8221; The Taoist master blocked it with his hook, and the two of them fought a fine battle by the Hermitage of Immortals.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The holy monk conceived after drinking from a river,</P>
<P>So Monkey went to call on the As-you-will Immortal,</P>
<P>Not knowing that the Taoist was in fact a monster,</P>
<P>Who had used his powers to seize the Miscarriage Spring.</P>
<P>When he met Monkey old hatreds were revived:</P>
<P>They were locked in struggle and neither would yield.</P>
<P>As they talked on he became ever angrier,</P>
<P>Evilly determined to have his revenge.</P>
<P>One came for water to save his master's life,</P>
<P>Which the other would not give for his nephew's sake.</P>
<P>More lethal than a scorpion was the as-out-will hook,</P>
<P>While the gold-banded cudgel struck like a dragon,</P>
<P>The cudgel kept thrusting savagely at the chest,</P>
<P>While the hook made subtle cuts to the legs.</P>
<P>Grievous were the wounds where the cudgel fell,</P>
<P>And the hook rose from the shoulders to strike at the head.</P>
<P>The cudgel swung round the waist</P>
<P>Like a hawk after a sparrow;</P>
<P>The hook struck thrice at the head</P>
<P>Like a mantis catching a cicada.</P>
<P>They came and went as they struggled for mastery,</P>
<P>The ebb and flow of battle taking them forward and back.</P>
<P>There was nothing to choose between cudgel and hook;</P>
<P>Neither contender emerged as the victor.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After the Taoist master had fought over ten rounds with the Great Sage but was no match for him Monkey struck at the head with more ferocity than ever, his cudgel's blows falling like a stream of shooting stars. Completely exhausted, the Taoist master fled down the mountainside trailing his As-You-Will hook behind him.</P>
<P>Instead of pursuing him Monkey went to the hermitage in search of water, only to find that the other Taoist had already fastened the gates. Holding the earthenware bowl in his hands he went straight up to the gates, kicked through them with all his strength, and rushed in. The Taoist disciple was crouching behind the well's railings. The Great Sage shouted at him, raised his cudgel, and was about to kill him when the Taoist fled into the back. Monkey had just fetched a bucket and was on the point of filling it with spring water from the well when the master came up behind him, caught his feet with the hook, and sent him sprawling on the ground. The Great Sage pulled himself to his feet and started hitting back with his cudgel. The Taoist master swerved aside and said, wielding the hook, &#8220;We'll see if you can steal the water from my well.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Come here,&#8221; shouted Monkey, &#8220;come here. I'll get you, you evil creature, and I'll beat you to death.&#8221; The Taoist master did not go for Monkey but just stood guard over the well, preventing him from drawing any water, Seeing that he was not moving, Monkey whirled his cudgel round and round with his left hand and in his right took the bucket, which he sent noisily down the well on the rope. The Taoist master came back to the attack with his hook. Monkey, unable to hold him off one-handed, was tripped round his legs again and sent sprawling, dropping the bucket and rope down the well.</P>
<P>&#8220;What a way to behave,&#8221; remarked the Great Sage, getting back on his feet and taking his cudgel in both hands to lash wildly back. Once again the Taoist master fled, unable to face him. The Great Sage still wanted to draw some water but now he had no bucket and was also worried that he might be tripped by the hook again. &#8220;I'd better get someone to help me,&#8221; he thought.</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage turned his cloud round, went straight back to the cottage door, and shouted, &#8220;Friar Sand.&#8221; When Sanzang and Pig, who were groaning and moaning in agony, heard his shout they said with relief, &#8220;Friar Sand, Wukong's back.&#8221;</P>
<P>Friar Sand opened the door as quickly as he could, asking, &#8220;Have you got the water, brother?&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey came in and told them what had happened Sanzang said with tears in his eyes, &#8220;What are we to do, disciple?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've come to take Brother Sand back to the hermitage with me,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;He'll fetch the water to save you while I fight that damned Taoist.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If both you healthy ones go and abandon us invalids who will look after us?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry, venerable arhat,&#8221; said the old woman who was standing beside them. &#8220;You won't need your disciples. We can look after you. We were very kind to you when you first came, and now that we have seen how that Bodhisattva can travel by cloud we know that you are arhats and Bodhisattvas. We could never possibly harm you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You women,&#8221; snorted Monkey, &#8220;you wouldn't dare hurt anyone.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't know your luck, my lord,&#8221; the old woman replied with a smile. &#8220;If you'd gone to any other house you'd never have come out in one piece.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; Pig groaned.</P>
<P>&#8220;All of us in this family are getting on,&#8221; the old woman replied, &#8220;and desire doesn't bother us any more, which is why we didn't harm you. If you'd gone to another household with women of different ages the younger ones would never have let you go. They'd have forced you to sleep with them, and if you'd refused they'd have murdered you and cut all the flesh off your bodies to put in perfume bags.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case I'd have been safe,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;The others smell lovely, just right for a perfume bag, but I'm a stinking boar and any flesh cut off me would stink too. I'd come to no harm.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop boasting,&#8221; said Brother Monkey with a smile, &#8220;and save your strength for the delivery.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Fetch the water as soon as you can. Don't waste any time,&#8221; the old woman said.</P>
<P>&#8220;Do you have a well-bucket on a rope I could borrow?&#8221; Monkey asked. The old woman went out to the back and brought in a bucket on a rope as well as a spare coil of rope that she handed to Friar Sand. &#8220;Take both ropes in case the well is so deep you need them,&#8221; she said.</P>
<P>Friar Sand took the bucket and the ropes, left the cottage with Monkey, and flew off on the same cloud. It took them less than an hour to reach Mount Offspring Dissolved, where they landed directly outside the gates of the hermitage. &#8220;Take the bucket and the ropes,&#8221; Monkey told Friar Sand, &#8220;and hide over there. Let me challenge him to battle. When the fight's going good and strong sneak in, fetch the water, and take it back.&#8221; Friar Sand accepted his orders.</P>
<P>Brandishing his iron cudgel the Great Sage Sun went up to the gates and shouted, &#8220;Open up! Open up!&#8221;</P>
<P>When the gate-keeper saw him he hurried inside to report, &#8220;Master, Sun Wukong's here again. The Taoist master was furiously angry.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That evil ape is utterly impossible. I've long heard of his powers and now I know what they really are. That cudgel of his is unbeatable.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said the other Taoist, &#8220;his powers may be great, but you're as good as he is. You are a match for him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He beat me the last two times,&#8221; said the master.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the other, &#8220;but that was just because he went for you with such fury. You tripped him up with your hook twice when he was trying to draw water, so that leveled the score, didn't it? He had to run away. If he's back now it must be because he's had to. I expect Sanzang's been complaining too much as his pregnancy's so far advanced. I'm sure that he's feeling resentful of his master. You're absolutely bound to win this time, master.&#8221;</P>
<P>This pleased the Taoist immortal and made him feel very cheerful as he went out through the doors. His face was wreathed in smiles, his manner imposing, and his hook in his hands. &#8220;Wicked ape, what are you back here for?&#8221; he shouted.</P>
<P>&#8220;Just to fetch some water,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's my well,&#8221; said the immortal, &#8220;and even if you were a king or a minister you'd still have to made me presents and offer mutton and wine before I gave you any. On top of that you're my enemy. How dare you come here empty-handed expecting water?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do you refuse to give me any?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the immortal, &#8220;I won't.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Vicious and evil beast,&#8221; Monkey yelled, &#8220;if you won't give me the water, take this!&#8221; He dropped his guard to strike hard with his cudgel at the immortal's head. The immortal dodged the blow and struck back with his hook. It was an even finer combat than the previous one.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The gold-banded cudgel,</P>
<P>The As-You-Will hook,</P>
<P>And two fighters filled with hatred and anger.</P>
<P>The flying sand and stones darkened earth and sky;</P>
<P>The clouds of dust and dirt made sun and moon seem sad.</P>
<P>The Great Sage was fetching water to save his master;</P>
<P>That the evil immortal refused for his nephew's sake.</P>
<P>Both sides fought with equal vigor</P>
<P>In their battle that allowed no rest.</P>
<P>They struggled for victory with tight-clenched jaws,</P>
<P>Gritting their teeth as they strove to win.</P>
<P>With growing skill</P>
<P>And ever-greater vigor</P>
<P>They breathed out clouds to frighten gods and ghosts.</P>
<P>Noisily rang the clash of their weapons</P>
<P>As their battle cries shook the mountains and hills.</P>
<P>They were a whirlwind wrecking a forest,</P>
<P>A pair of murderous fighting bulls.</P>
<P>As the battle went on the Great Sage felt happier</P>
<P>And the Taoist immortal had ever more energy.</P>
<P>Each was determined to carry on the fight;</P>
<P>Neither would give up till the issue was resolved.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The two of them leapt around in their fight from the gates of the hermitage to the mountain slope. It was a long and bitter struggle.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Friar Sand rushed in through the gates with the bucket in his hand the Taoist disciple blocked his way and asked, &#8220;Who do you think you are, coming to steal our water?&#8221; Friar Sand put down his bucket and ropes, brought out his demon-quelling staff, and struck at the Taoist's head by way of an answer. Because the Taoist could not move out of the way fast enough the blow broke his arm and he fell to the ground, straggling to escape.</P>
<P>&#8220;I was going to kill you, you evil beast,&#8221; roared Friar Sand, &#8220;but seeing as you're human I feel sorry for you and I'll let you go. Now let me get my water.&#8221; The Taoist crawled to the back of the hermitage thanking heaven and earth for his escape. Friar Sand then filled his bucket with water from the well, went out through the gates, rose up on his cloud, and called to Monkey, &#8220;I've got the water, brother. Spare him now, spare him.&#8221;</P>
<P>Hearing this, Monkey held the hook at bay with his cudgel and said, &#8220;Listen to what I have to say. I was going to wipe all of you out, but you've broken no laws and your brother the Bull Demon King is a friend of mine. The first time I came you tripped me up with your hook a couple of times and I couldn't get the water. I lured you out to fight me so that my fellow disciple could get some water. If I'd used my full powers I'd have killed several of you, never mind just one As-you-will Immortal. But it's better to spare life than to take it, so I'll let you live a few more years. Never ever try extortion on anyone who comes here for the water again.&#8221;</P>
<P>The evil and foolish immortal moved and tried to hook Monkey once more, but Monkey avoided the hook, rushed at him, and shouted, &#8220;Don't move!&#8221; The helpless immortal fell head first to the ground and was unable to get up. The Great Sage picked up his As-You-Will hook, snapped it in two, then broke the two pieces into four, and threw them to the ground. &#8220;Damned beast,&#8221; he said, &#8220;are you going to try any more nonsense?&#8221; The trembling immortal had to bear his humiliation in silence, and the laughing Great Sage rose up on his cloud. There is a poem that testifies to this. It goes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When true lead is melted it yields a true liquid;</P>
<P>If the true liquid is mixed right, true mercury hardens.</P>
<P>True mercury and true lead have no feminine quality;</P>
<P>Magic cinnabar and herbs are the elixir of immortality.</P>
<P>When a child is recklessly formed and a pregnancy results</P>
<P>The mother of earth succeeds without any effort.</P>
<P>Heresy is pushed over and orthodoxy honoured;</P>
<P>The heart's lord succeeds and returns in smiles.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Great Sage set off his cloud and caught up with Friar Sand. They were very pleased to be returning with the magical water as they brought their cloud down at the cottage to find Pig leaning against the door and groaning with his big belly sticking out. &#8220;Idiot,&#8221; said Monkey, stealing up on him, &#8220;when did you get yourself pregnant?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop teasing me,&#8221; said the idiot in desperation.</P>
<P>&#8220;Did you fetch the water?&#8221; Monkey was going to keep the joke up but Friar Sand then arrived to report with a smile, &#8220;Here's the water.&#8221;</P>
<P>Despite his agony Sanzang managed to lean forward in a kind of bow as he said, &#8220;Disciples, I'm very grateful to you.&#8221; The old woman was pleased too, and the whole household came in to bow and say, &#8220;Bodhisattvas, this is wonderful, wonderful.&#8221; She fetched a drinking bowl of decorated porcelain, half filled it with the water, and handed it to Sanzang with the words, &#8220;Venerable sir, please drink it very slowly. One mouthful will be enough to end the pregnancy.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I won't need a bowl,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;I'll drink the lot, bucket, rope and all.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Venerable sir,&#8221; the woman said, &#8220;don't give me such a terrible fright. If you drank the whole bucketful it would dissolve all your insides.&#8221; This gave the idiot such a fright that he behaved himself and drank only half a bowlful too.</P>
<P>Within less time than it takes to eat a meal the two of them were in agony: their intestines felt as if they were being wrung out and gave several loud rumbles. After that the idiot could contain himself no longer; he emptied his bowels and his bladder. The Tang Priest, also unable to contain himself, wanted to go to the lavatory.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Brother Monkey, &#8220;you mustn't go anywhere you might be in a draft, If you catch a cold you may get milk fever.&#8221; The woman then brought in two latrine buckets for the pair of them. When they had both used them several times the pain stopped and their stomachs gradually started to resume their normal size as the extra flesh and blood in them was dissolved.</P>
<P>The woman then cooked them some plain rice porridge to settle their stomachs. &#8220;Lady,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;my stomach's very strong, and it doesn't need settling. Boil me some water for a bath before I eat my porridge.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You mustn't have a bath, brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;Washing in he first month after childbirth can make you ill.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That wasn't childbirth,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;just a miscarriage: nothing to worry about. I want a bath to clean up.&#8221; The woman then boiled some water for them to wash their hands and feet. The Tang Priest could only manage two bowls of porridge while Pig downed a dozen or so and still wanted more.</P>
<P>&#8220;Idiot,&#8221; said Monkey with a laugh, &#8220;don't eat so much. It wouldn't look pretty at all if you got a big belly like a sandbag.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No problem,&#8221; said pig, &#8220;no problem. I'm not a sow, so I don't need to worry about that.&#8221; The women then went out to cook him some more rice.</P>
<P>&#8220;Will you give me the rest of the water?&#8221; the old woman asked the Tang Priest.</P>
<P>&#8220;Have you had enough of the water?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;My stomach's stopped hurting,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;and I'm sure the pregnancy's completely finished. As I'm fine now I don't need any more.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As they're both better now we'll give you the water,&#8221; said Monkey. The woman thanked him and buried the water in a glazed jar behind the house.</P>
<P>&#8220;That jar of water will be enough to pay for my coffin,&#8221; she told the rest of her family, who were all delighted. A vegetarian meal was prepared, tables and chairs were set out, and the monks dined. They took their time over the meal then retired for the night.</P>
<P>The next morning they thanked the old woman and her family and left the cottage. Sanzang mounted the horse, Friar Sand shouldered the luggage, the Great Sage Monkey led the way, and Pig held the bridle. This had been a case of</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Rinsing away the evil and leaving the body pure,</P>
<P>Dissolving the mortal foetus to restore the natural self.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know what else happened in that country listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>禅主吞餐怀鬼孕</p>
<p>黄婆运水解邪胎</p>
</div>
<p>德行要修八百，阴功须积三千。均平物我与亲冤，始合西天本愿。魔兕刀兵不怯，空劳水火无愆。老君降伏却朝天，笑把青牛牵转。话说那大路旁叫唤者谁？乃金皘山山神土地，捧着紫金钵盂叫道：“圣僧啊，这钵盂饭是孙大圣向好处化来的。</p>

<p>因你等不听良言，误入妖魔之手，致令大圣劳苦万端，今日方救得出。且来吃了饭，再去走路，莫孤负孙大圣一片恭孝之心也。”三藏道：“徒弟，万分亏你！言谢不尽！早知不出圈痕，那有此杀身之害。”行者道：“不瞒师父说，只因你不信我的圈子，却教你受别人的圈子。多少苦楚，可叹！可叹！”八戒道：“怎么又有个圈子。”行者道：“都是你这孽嘴孽舌的夯货，弄师父遭此一场大难！着老孙翻天覆地，请天兵水火与佛祖丹砂，尽被他使一个白森森的圈子套去。如来暗示了罗汉，对老孙说出那妖的根原，才请老君来收伏，却是个青牛作怪。”三藏闻言，感激不尽道：“贤徒，今番经此，下次定然听你吩咐。”遂此四人分吃那饭，那饭热气腾腾的。行者道：“这饭多时了，却怎么还热？”土地跪下道：“是小神知大圣功完，才自热来伺候。”须臾饭毕，收拾了钵盂，辞了土地山神。</p>

<p>那师父才攀鞍上马，过了高山。正是涤虑洗心皈正觉，餐风宿水向西行。行彀多时，又值早春天气，听了些“紫燕呢喃，黄鹂睍睆。紫燕呢喃香嘴困，黄鹂襕睆巧音频。满地落红如布锦，遍山发翠似堆茵。岭上青梅结豆，崖前古柏留云。野润烟光淡，沙暄日色曛。几处园林花放蕊，阳回大地柳芽新。正行处，忽遇一道小河，澄澄清水，湛湛寒波。唐长老勒过马观看，远见河那边有柳阴垂碧，微露着茅屋几椽。行者遥指那厢道：</p>

<p>“那里人家，一定是摆渡的。”三藏道：“我见那厢也似这般，却不见船只，未敢开言。”八戒旋下行李，厉声高叫道：“摆渡的！</p>

<p>撑船过来！”连叫几遍，只见那柳阴里面，咿咿哑哑的，撑出一只船儿。不多时，相近这岸。师徒们仔细看了那船儿，真个是：</p>

<p>短棹分波，轻桡泛浪。瞰堂油漆彩，艎板满平仓。船头上铁缆盘窝，船后边舵楼明亮。虽然是一苇之航，也不亚泛湖浮海。纵无锦缆牙樯，实有松桩桂楫。固不如万里神舟，真可渡一河之隔。往来只在两崖边，出入不离古渡口。那船儿须臾顶岸，有梢子叫云：“过河的，这里去。”三藏纵马近前看处，那梢子怎生模样：头裹锦绒帕，足踏皂丝鞋。身穿百纳绵裆袄，腰束千针裙布衫。手腕皮粗筋力硬，眼花眉皱面容衰。声音娇细如莺啭，近观乃是老裙钗。行者近于船边道：“你是摆渡的？”那妇人道：</p>

<p>“是。”行者道：“梢公如何不在，却着梢婆撑船？”妇人微笑不答，用手拖上跳板。沙和尚将行李挑上去，行者扶着师父上跳，然后顺过船来，八戒牵上白马，收了跳板。那妇人撑开船，摇动桨，顷刻间过了河。</p>

<p>身登西岸，长老教沙僧解开包，取几文钱钞与他。妇人更不争多寡，将缆拴在傍水的桩上，笑嘻嘻径入庄屋里去了。三藏见那水清，一时口渴，便着八戒：“取钵盂，舀些水来我吃。”</p>

<p>那呆子道：“我也正要些儿吃哩。”即取钵盂，舀了一钵，递与师父。师父吃了有一少半，还剩了多半，呆子接来，一气饮干，却伏侍三藏上马。师徒们找路西行，不上半个时辰，那长老在马上呻吟道：“腹痛！”八戒随后道：“我也有些腹痛。”沙僧道：“想是吃冷水了？”说未毕，师父声唤道：“疼的紧！”八戒也道：“疼得紧！”他两个疼痛难禁，渐渐肚子大了。用手摸时，似有血团肉块，不住的骨冗骨冗乱动。三藏正不稳便，忽然见那路旁有一村舍，树梢头挑着两个草把。行者道：“师父，好了，那厢是个卖酒的人家。我们且去化他些热汤与你吃，就问可有卖药的，讨贴药，与你治治腹痛。”三藏闻言甚喜，却打白马，不一时，到了村舍门口下马。但只见那门儿外有一个老婆婆，端坐在草墩上绩麻。行者上前，打个问讯道：“婆婆，贫僧是东土大唐来的，我师父乃唐朝御弟。因为过河吃了河水，觉肚腹疼痛。”那婆婆喜哈哈的道：“你们在那边河里吃水来？”行者道：“是在此东边清水河吃的。”那婆婆欣欣的笑道：“好耍子！好耍子！你都进来，我与你说。”</p>

<p>行者即搀唐僧，沙僧即扶八戒，两人声声唤唤，腆着肚子，一个个只疼得面黄眉皱，入草舍坐下，行者只叫：“婆婆，是必烧些热汤与我师父，我们谢你。”那婆婆且不烧汤，笑唏唏跑走后边叫道：“你们来看！你们来看！”那里面，蹼烤蹼踏的，又走出两三个半老不老的妇人，都来望着唐僧洒笑。行者大怒，喝了一声，把牙一嗟，唬得那一家子跌跌蹡蹡，往后就走。行者上前，扯住那老婆子道：“快早烧汤，我饶了你！”那婆子战兢兢的道：“爷爷呀，我烧汤也不济事，也治不得他两个肚疼。你放了我，等我说。”行者放了他，他说：“我这里乃是西梁女国。我们这一国尽是女人，更无男子，故此见了你们欢喜。你师父吃的那水不好了，那条河唤做子母河，我那国王城外，还有一座迎阳馆驿，驿门外有一个照胎泉。我这里人，但得年登二十岁以上，方敢去吃那河里水。吃水之后，便觉腹痛有胎。至三日之后，到那迎阳馆照胎水边照去。若照得有了双影，便就降生孩儿。你师吃了子母河水，以此成了胎气，也不日要生孩子，热汤怎么治得？”三藏闻言，大惊失色道：“徒弟啊！似此怎了？”八戒扭腰撒胯的哼道：“爷爷呀！要生孩子，我们却是男身！那里开得产门？如何脱得出来。”行者笑道：“古人云，瓜熟自落，若到那个时节，一定从胁下裂个窟窿，钻出来也。”八戒见说，战兢兢忍不得疼痛道：“罢了罢了！死了死了！”沙僧笑道：“二哥，莫扭莫扭！只怕错了养儿肠，弄做个胎前病。”那呆子越发慌了，眼中噙泪。扯着行者道：“哥哥！你问这婆婆，看那里有手轻的稳婆，预先寻下几个，这半会一阵阵的动荡得紧，想是摧阵疼。</p>

<p>快了！快了！”沙僧又笑道：“二哥，既知摧阵疼，不要扭动，只恐挤破浆泡耳。”三藏哼着道：“婆婆啊，你这里可有医家？教我徒弟去买一贴堕胎药吃了，打下胎来罢。”那婆子道：“就有药也不济事。只是我们这正南街上有一座解阳山，山中有一个破儿洞，洞里有一眼落胎泉。须得那井里水吃一口，方才解了胎气。</p>

<p>却如今取不得水了，向年来了一个道人，称名如意真仙，把那破儿洞改作聚仙庵，护住落胎泉水，不肯善赐与人。但欲求水者，须要花红表礼，羊酒果盘，志诚奉献，只拜求得他一碗儿水哩。你们这行脚僧，怎么得许多钱财买办？但只可挨命，待时而生产罢了。”行者闻得此言，满心欢喜道：“婆婆，你这里到那解阳山有几多路程？”婆婆道：“有三十里。”行者道：“好了！好了！师父放心，待老孙取些水来你吃。”好大圣，吩咐沙僧道：</p>

<p>“你好仔细看着师父，若这家子无礼，侵哄师父，你拿出旧时手段来，装吓虎唬他，等我取水去。”沙僧依命，只见那婆子端出一个大瓦钵来，递与行者道：“拿这钵头儿去，是必多取些来，与我们留着用急。”行者真个接了瓦钵，出草舍，纵云而去。那婆子才望空礼拜道：“爷爷呀！这和尚会驾云！”才进去叫出那几个妇人来，对唐僧磕头礼拜，都称为罗汉菩萨，一壁厢烧汤办饭，供奉唐僧不题。</p>

<p>却说那孙大圣筋斗云起，少顷间见一座山头，阻住云角，即按云光，睁睛看处，好山！但见那：幽花摆锦，野草铺蓝。涧水相连落，溪云一样闲。重重谷壑藤萝密，远远峰峦树木蘩。鸟啼雁过，鹿饮猿攀。翠岱如屏嶂，青崖似髻鬟。尘埃滚滚真难到，泉石涓涓不厌看。每见仙童采药去，常逢樵了负薪还。果然不亚天台景，胜似三峰西华山！这大圣正然观看那山不尽，又只见背阴处，有一所庄院，忽闻得犬吠之声。大圣下山，径至庄所，却也好个去处，看那：小桥通活水，茅舍倚青山。村犬汪篱落，幽人自往还。</p>

<p>不时来至门首，见一个老道人，盘坐在绿茵之上，大圣放下瓦钵，近前道问讯，那道人欠身还礼道：“那方来者？至小庵有何勾当？”行者道：“贫僧乃东土大唐钦差西天取经者。因我师父误饮了子母河之水，如今腹疼肿胀难禁。问及土人，说是结成胎气，无方可治。访得解阳山破儿洞有落胎泉可以消得胎气，故此特来拜见如意真仙，求些泉水，搭救师父，累烦老道指引指引。”那道人笑道：“此间就是破儿洞，今改为聚仙庵了。我却不是别人，即是如意真仙老爷的大徒弟。你叫做甚么名字？</p>

<p>待我好与你通报。”行者道：“我是唐三藏法师的大徒弟，贱名孙悟空。”那道人问曰：“你的花红酒礼，都在那里？”行者道：</p>

<p>“我是个过路的挂搭僧，不曾办得来。”道人笑道：“你好痴呀！</p>

<p>我老师父护住山泉，并不曾白送与人。你回去办将礼来，我好通报，不然请回，莫想莫想！”行者道：“人情大似圣旨，你去说我老孙的名字，他必然做个人情，或者连井都送我也。”</p>

<p>那道人闻此言，只得进去通报，却见那真仙抚琴，只待他琴终，方才说道：“师父，外面有个和尚，口称是唐三藏大徒弟孙悟空，欲求落胎泉水，救他师父。”那真仙不听说便罢，一听得说个悟空名字，却就怒从心上起，恶向胆边生，急起身，下了琴床，脱了素服，换上道衣，取一把如意钩子，跳出庵门，叫道：</p>

<p>“孙悟空何在？”行者转头，观见那真仙打扮：头戴星冠飞彩艳，身穿金缕法衣红。足下云鞋堆锦绣，腰间宝带绕玲珑。一双纳锦凌波袜，半露裙襕闪绣绒。手拿如意金钩子，鐏利杆长若蟒龙。凤眼光明眉菂竖，钢牙尖利口翻红。额下髯飘如烈火，鬓边赤发短蓬松。形容恶似温元帅，争奈衣冠不一同。行者见了，合掌作礼道：“贫僧便是孙悟空。”那先生笑道：“你真个是孙悟空，却是假名托姓者？”行者道：“你看先生说话，常言道，君子行不更名，坐不改姓。我便是悟空，岂有假托之理？”先生道：</p>

<p>“你可认得我么？”行者道：“我因归正释门，秉诚僧教，这一向登山涉水，把我那幼时的朋友也都疏失，未及拜访，少识尊颜。|奇+_+书*_*网|</p>

<p>适间问道子母河西乡人家，言及先生乃如意真仙，故此知之。”</p>


<p>那先生道：“你走你的路，我修我的真，你来访我怎的？”行者道：“因我师父误饮了子母河水，腹疼成胎，特来仙府，拜求一碗落胎泉水，救解师难也。”那先生怒目道：“你师父可是唐三藏么？”行者道：“正是，正是。”先生咬牙恨道：“你们可曾会着一个圣婴大王么？”行者道：“他是号山枯松涧火云洞红孩儿妖怪的绰号，真仙问他怎的？”先生道：“是我之舍侄，我乃牛魔王的兄弟。前者家兄处有信来报我，称说唐三藏的大徒弟孙悟空惫懒，将他害了。我这里正没处寻你报仇，你倒来寻我，还要甚么水哩！”行者陪笑道：“先生差了，你令兄也曾与我做朋友，幼年间也曾拜七弟兄，但只是不知先生尊府，有失拜望。如今令侄得了好处，现随着观音菩萨，做了善财童子，我等尚且不如，怎么反怪我也？”先生喝道：“这泼猢狲！还弄巧舌！我舍侄还是自在为王好，还是与人为奴好？不得无礼！吃我这一钩！”大圣使铁棒架住道：“先生莫说打的话，且与些泉水去也。”那先生骂道：“泼猢狲！不知死活！如若三合敌得我，与你水去；敌不去，只把你剁为肉酱，方与我侄子报仇。”大圣骂道：“我把你不识起倒的孽障！既要打，走上来看棍！”那先生如意钩劈手相还。二人在聚仙庵好杀：圣僧误食成胎水，行者来寻如意仙。那晓真仙原是怪，倚强护住落胎泉。及至相逢讲仇隙，争持决不遂如然。言来语去成僝僽，意恶情凶要报冤。这一个因师伤命来求水，那一个为侄亡身不与泉。如意钩强如蝎毒，金箍棒狠似龙巅。当胸乱刺施威猛，着脚斜钩展妙玄。阴手棍丢伤处重，过肩钩起近头鞭。锁腰一棍鹰持雀，压顶三钩蜋捕蝉。往往来来争胜败，返返复复两回还。钩挛棒打无前后，不见输赢在那边。那先生与大圣战经十数合，敌不得大圣。这大圣越加猛烈，一条棒似滚滚流星，着头乱打，先生败了筋力，倒拖着如意钩，往山上走了。</p>

<p>大圣不去赶他，却来庵内寻水，那个道人早把庵门关了。</p>

<p>大圣拿着瓦钵，赶至门前，尽力气一脚，踢破庵门，闯将进去，见那道人伏在井栏上，被大圣喝了一声，举棒要打，那道人往后跑了。却才寻出吊桶来，正自打水，又被那先生赶到前边，使如意钩子把大圣钩着脚一跌，跌了个嘴哏地。大圣爬起来，使铁棒就打，他却闪在旁边，执着钩子道：“看你可取得我的水去！”大圣骂道：“你上来！你上来！我把你这个孽障，直打杀你！”那先生也不上前拒敌，只是禁住了，不许大圣打水。大圣见他不动，却使左手轮着铁棒，右手使吊桶，将索子才突鲁鲁的放下。他又来使钩。大圣一只手撑持不得，又被他一钩钩着脚，扯了个躘踵，连井索通跌下井去了。大圣道：“这厮却是无礼！”爬起来，双手轮棒，没头没脸的打将上去。那先生依然走了，不敢迎敌。大圣又要去取水，奈何没有吊桶，又恐怕来钩扯，心中暗暗想道：“且去叫个帮手来！”</p>

<p>好大圣，拨转云头，径至村舍门首叫一声：“沙和尚。”那里边三藏忍痛呻吟，猪八戒哼声不绝，听得叫唤，二人欢喜道：</p>

<p>“沙僧啊，悟空来也。”沙僧连忙出门接着道：“大哥，取水来了？”大圣进门，对唐僧备言前事，三藏滴泪道：“徒弟啊，似此怎了？”大圣道：“我来叫沙兄弟与我同去，到那庵边，等老孙和那厮敌斗，教沙僧乘便取水来救你。”三藏道：“你两个没病的都去了，丢下我两个有病的，教谁伏侍？”那个老婆婆在旁道：</p>

<p>“老罗汉只管放心，不须要你徒弟，我家自然看顾伏侍你。你们早间到时，我等实有爱怜之意，却才见这位菩萨云来雾去，方知你是罗汉菩萨。我家决不敢复害你。”行者咄的一声道：“汝等女流之辈，敢伤那个？”老婆子笑道：“爷爷呀，还是你们有造化，来到我家！若到第二家，你们也不得囫囵了！”八戒哼哼的道：“不得囫囵，是怎么的？”婆婆道：“我一家儿四五口，都是有几岁年纪的，把那风月事尽皆休了，故此不肯伤你。若还到第二家，老小众大，那年小之人，那个肯放过你去！就要与你交合。假如不从，就要害你性命，把你们身上肉，都割了去做香袋儿哩。”八戒道：“若这等，我决无伤。他们都是香喷喷的，好做香袋；我是个臊猪，就割了肉去，也是臊的，故此可以无伤。”行者笑道：“你不要说嘴，省些力气，好生产也。”那婆婆道：“不必迟疑，快求水去。”行者道：“你家可有吊桶？借个使使。”那婆子即往后边取出一个吊桶，又窝了一条索子，递与沙僧。沙僧道：</p>

<p>“带两条索子去，恐一时井深要用。”沙僧接了桶索，即随大圣出了村舍，一同驾云而去。那消半个时辰，却到解阳山界，按下云头，径至庵外。大圣吩咐沙僧道：“你将桶索拿了，且在一边躲着，等老孙出头索战。你待我两人交战正浓之时，你乘机进去，取水就走。”沙僧谨依言命。</p>

<p>孙大圣掣了铁棒，近门高叫：“开门！开门！”那守门的看见，急入里通报道：“师父，那孙悟空又来了也。”那先生心中大怒道：“这泼猴老大无状！一向闻他有些手段，果然今日方知，他那条棒真是难敌。”道人道：“师父，他的手段虽高，你亦不亚与他，正是个对手。”先生道：“前面两回，被他赢了。”道人道：</p>

<p>“前两回虽赢，不过是一猛之性；后面两次打水之时，被师父钩他两跌，却不是相比肩也？先既无奈而去，今又复来，必然是三藏胎成身重，埋怨得紧，不得已而来也，决有慢他师之心。管取我师决胜无疑。”真仙闻言，喜孜孜满怀春意，笑盈盈一阵威风，挺如意钩子，走出门来喝道：“泼猢狲！你又来作甚？”大圣道：“我来只是取水”。真仙道：“泉水乃吾家之井，凭是帝王宰相，也须表礼羊酒来求，方才仅与些须。况你又是我的仇人，擅敢白手来取？”大圣道，“真个不与？”真仙道：“不与，不与！”大圣骂道：“泼孽障！既不与水，看棍！”丢一个架子，抢个满怀，不容说，着头便打。那真仙侧身躲过，使钩子急架相还。这一场比前更胜，好杀：金箍棒，如意钩，二人奋怒各怀仇。飞砂走石乾坤暗，播土扬尘日月愁。大圣救师来取水，妖仙为侄不容求。</p>

<p>两家齐努力，一处赌安休。咬牙争胜负，切齿定刚柔。添机见，越抖擞，喷云嗳雾鬼神愁。朴朴兵兵钩棒响，喊声哮吼振山丘。</p>

<p>狂风滚滚催林木，杀气纷纷过斗牛。大圣愈争愈喜悦，真仙越打越绸缪。有心有意相争战，不定存亡不罢休。他两个在庵门外交手，跳跳舞舞的，斗到山坡之下，恨苦相持不题。</p>

<p>却说那沙和尚提着吊桶，闯进门去，只见那道人在井边挡住道：“你是甚人，敢来取水！”沙僧放下吊桶，取出降妖宝杖，不对话，着头便打。那道人躲闪不及，把左臂膊打折，道人倒在地下挣命。沙僧骂道：“我要打杀你这孽畜，怎奈你是个人身！</p>

<p>我还怜你，饶你去罢！让我打水！”那道人叫天叫地的，爬到后面去了。沙僧却才将吊桶向井中满满的打了一吊桶水，走出庵门，驾起云雾，望着行者喊道：“大哥，我已取了水去也！饶他罢！饶他罢！”大圣听得，方才使铁棒支住钩子道：“你听老孙说，我本待斩尽杀绝，争奈你不曾犯法，二来看你令兄牛魔王的情上。先头来，我被钩了两下，未得水去。才然来，我是个调虎离山计，哄你出来争战，却着我师弟取水去了。老孙若肯拿出本事来打你，莫说你是一个甚么如意真仙，就是再有几个，也打死了。正是打死不如放生，且饶你教你活几年耳，已后再有取水者，切不可勒掯他。”那妖仙不识好歹，演一演，就来钩脚，被大圣闪过钩头，赶上前，喝声：“休走！”那妖仙措手不及，推了一个蹼辣，挣扎不起。大圣夺过如意钩来，折为两段，总拿着又一抉，抉作四段，掷之于地道：“泼孽畜！再敢无礼么？”那妖仙战战兢兢，忍辱无言，这大圣笑呵呵，驾云而起。有诗为证，诗曰：真铅若炼须真水，真水调和真汞干。真汞真铅无母气，灵砂灵药是仙丹。婴儿枉结成胎象，土母施功不费难。推倒旁门宗正教，心君得意笑容还。大圣纵着祥光，赶上沙僧，得了真水，喜喜欢欢，回于本处，按下云头，径来村舍，只见猪八戒腆着肚子，倚在门枋上哼哩。行者悄悄上前道：“呆子，几时占房的？”呆子慌了道：“哥哥莫取笑，可曾有水来么？”行者还要耍他，沙僧随后就到，笑道：“水来了！水来了！”三藏忍痛欠身道：“徒弟啊，累了你们也！”那婆婆却也欢喜，几口儿都出礼拜道：“菩萨呀，却是难得！难得！”即忙取个花磁盏子，舀了半盏儿，递与三藏道：“老师父，细细的吃，只消一口，就解了胎气。”八戒道：“我不用盏子，连吊桶等我喝了罢。”那婆子道：</p>

<p>“老爷爷，唬杀人罢了！若吃了这吊桶水，好道连肠子肚子都化尽了！”吓得呆子不敢胡为，也只吃了半盏。那里有顿饭之时，他两个腹中绞痛，只听毂辘毂辘三五阵肠鸣。肠鸣之后，那呆子忍不住，大小便齐流，唐僧也忍不住要往静处解手。行者道：</p>

<p>“师父啊，切莫出风地里去。怕人子，一时冒了风，弄做个产后之疾。”那婆婆即取两个净桶来，教他两个方便。须臾间，各行了几遍，才觉住了疼痛，渐渐的销了肿胀，化了那血团肉块。那婆婆家又煎些白米粥与他补虚，八戒道：“婆婆，我的身子实落，不用补虚。且烧些汤水与我洗个澡，却好吃粥。”沙僧道：</p>

<p>“哥哥，洗不得澡，坐月子的人弄了水浆致病。”八戒道：“我又不曾大生，左右只是个小产，怕他怎的？洗洗儿干净。”真个那婆子烧些汤与他两个净了手脚。唐僧才吃两盏儿粥汤，八戒就吃了十数碗，还只要添。行者笑道：“夯货！少吃些！莫弄做个沙包肚，不象模样。”八戒道：“没事！没事！我又不是母猪，怕他做甚？”那家子真个又去收拾煮饭。</p>

<p>老婆婆对唐僧道：“老师父，把这水赐了我罢。”行者道：</p>

<p>“呆子，不吃水了？”八戒道：“我的肚腹也不疼了，胎气想是已行散了，洒然无事，又吃水何为？”行者道：“既是他两个都好了，将水送你家罢。”那婆婆谢了行者，将余剩之水，装于瓦罐之中，埋在后边地下，对众老小道：“这罐水，彀我的棺材本也！”众老小无不欢喜，整顿斋饭，调开桌凳，唐僧们吃了斋。消消停停，将息了一宿。次日天明，师徒们谢了婆婆家，出离村舍。唐三藏攀鞍上马。沙和尚挑着行囊。孙大圣前边引路，猪八戒拢了缰绳，这里才是洗净口孽身干净，销化凡胎体自然。</p>

<p>毕竟不知到国界中还有甚么理会，且听下回分解。</p>
