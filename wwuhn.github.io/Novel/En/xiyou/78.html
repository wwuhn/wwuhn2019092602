<P>The Demon Host Mistreats the Fundamental Nature</P>
<P>The One Body Pays His Respects to the Buddha</P>
</div>
<P>We will tell now not of the sufferings of the venerable Tang Elder but of the three demon chiefs in strenuous combat with the Great Sage and his two brother disciples in the low hills to the East outside the city. It was indeed a good hard battle, like an iron brush against a copper pan:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Six types of body, six types of weapon,</P>
<P>Six physical forms, six feelings.</P>
<P>The six evils arise from the six sense organs and the six desires;</P>
<P>The six gates to nirvana and the six ways of rebirth are struggling for victory.</P>
<P>In the thirty-six divine palaces spring comes of itself;</P>
<P>The six times six forms do not want to be named.</P>
<P>This one holding a gold-banded cudgel</P>
<P>Performs a thousand movements;</P>
<P>That one wielding a heaven-square halberd</P>
<P>Is exceptional in every way.</P>
<P>Pig is even more ferocious with his rake;</P>
<P>The second demon's spear-play is superb and effective.</P>
<P>There is nothing commonplace about young Friar Sand's staff</P>
<P>As he tries to inflict a blow that is fatal;</P>
<P>Sharp is the senior demon's saber</P>
<P>Which he raises without mercy.</P>
<P>These three are the true priest's invincible escorts;</P>
<P>The other three are evil and rebellious spirits.</P>
<P>At first the fight is not so bad,</P>
<P>But later it becomes more murderous.</P>
<P>All six weapons rise up by magic</P>
<P>To twist and turn in the clouds above.</P>
<P>They belch out in an instant clouds that darken the sky,</P>
<P>And the only sounds to be heard are roars and bellows.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After the six of them had been fighting for a long time evening was drawing in, and as the wind was also bringing clouds it became dark very quickly. Pig was finding it harder and harder to see as his big ears were covering his eyelids. His hands and feet were besides too slow for him to be able to hold off his opponent, so he fled from the fight, dragging his rake behind him. The senior demon chief took a swing at him with his sword that almost killed him. Luckily Pig moved his head out of the way, so that the blade only cut off a few of his bristles. The monster then caught up with Pig, opened his jaws, picked Pig up by the collar, carried him into the city and threw him to the junior demons to tie up and take to the throne hall. The senior demon chief then rose back into the air by cloud to help the other two.</P>
<P>Seeing that things were going badly Friar Sand feinted with his staff and turned to flee only to be caught, hands and all, when the second demon unraveled his trunk and noisily wrapped it round him. The demon took him too into the city, ordering the junior demons to tie him up in the palace before rising up into the sky again to tell the others how to catch Monkey. Seeing that both his brother disciples had been captured Monkey realized that it was going to be impossible for him to hold out single-handed. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A couple of fists can defeat a good hand,</P>
<P>But cannot a competent foursome withstand.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>With a shout Brother Monkey pushed the three demons' weapons aside, set off his somersault cloud and fled. When the third demon chief saw Monkey ride off by somersault he shook himself, resumed his real form, spread his wings and caught up with the Great Sage. You may well ask how the demon could possibly catch up with him. When Monkey made havoc in heaven all that time ago a hundred thousand heavenly soldiers had failed to capture him. Because he could cover 36,000 miles in a single somersault of his cloud, none of the gods had been able to catch up with him. But this evil spirit could cover 30,000 miles with one beat of his wings, so that with two beats he caught up with Monkey and seized him. Monkey could not get out of the demon's talons no matter how hard he struggled or how desperately he longed to escape. Even when he used his transformation magic he still could not move. If he made himself grow the demon opened his grip but still held firmly to him; and if he shrank the demon tightened his clutch. The demon took him back inside the city, released his talons, dropped him into the dust, and told the fiendish hordes to tie him up and put him with Pig and Friar Sand. The senior and the second demon chiefs both came out to greet the third chief, who went back up into the throne hall with them. Alas! This time they were not tying Monkey up but sending him on his way.</P>
<P>It was now the second watch of the night, and after all the demons had exchanged greetings the Tang Priest was pushed out of the throne hall. When he suddenly caught sight in the lamplight of his three disciples all lying tied up on the ground the venerable master leaned down beside Brother Monkey and said through his tears, &#8220;Disciple, when we meet with trouble you normally go off and use your magic powers to subdue the monsters causing it. Now that you too have been captured can I survive, poor monk that I am?&#8221; As soon as Pig and Friar Sand heard their master's distress they too began to howl together.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry, Master,&#8221; said Monkey with a hint of a smile, &#8220;and don't cry, brothers. No matter what they do they won't be able to hurt us. When the demon chiefs have settled and are asleep we can be on our way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're just making trouble again, brother,&#8221; replied Pig. &#8220;We're trussed up with hempen ropes. If we do manage to work them a bit loose they spurt water on them to shrink them again. You might be too skinny to notice, but fat old me's having a terrible time. If you don't believe me take a look at my arms. The rope's cut two inches deep into them. I'd never get away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Never mind hempen ropes,&#8221; said Monkey with a laugh, &#8220;even if they were coconut cables as thick as a rice-bowl they'd be no more than an autumn breeze to me. What's there to make a fuss about?&#8221;</P>
<P>As master and disciples were talking the senior demon could be heard saying, &#8220;Third brother, you really are strong and wise. Your plan to capture the Tang Priest was brilliant and it worked.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Little ones,&#8221; he called, &#8220;Five of you carry water, seven scrub the pans, ten get the fire burning and twenty fetch the iron steamer. When we've steamed the four monks tender for my brothers and me to enjoy we'll give you juniors a piece so that you can all live for ever.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, trembling, when he this, &#8220;listen. That evil spirit's planning to steam and eat us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be afraid,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'm going to find out whether he's an evil spirit still wet behind the ears or an old hand.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand, sobbing, &#8220;don't talk so big. We're next door to the king of Hell. How can you talk about whether he's wet behind the ears or an old hand at a time like this?&#8221; The words were not all out of his mouth before the second demon chief was heard to say, &#8220;Pig won't steam well.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Amitabha Buddha!&#8221; said Pig with delight. &#8220;I wonder who's building up good karma by saying I won't steam well.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If he won't steam well,&#8221; the third chief said, &#8220;skin him before steaming him.&#8221; This panicked Pig, who screamed at the top of his voice, &#8220;Don't skin me. I may be coarse but I'll go tender if you boil me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If he won't steam well,&#8221; the senior demon chief said, &#8220;put him on the bottom tray of the steamer.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry, Pig,&#8221; said Monkey with a laugh, &#8220;he's wet behind the ears. He's no old hand.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you tell?&#8221; Friar Sand asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Generally speaking you should start from the top when steaming,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Whatever's hardest to steam should be put on the top tray. Add a bit of extra fuel to the fire, get up a good steam and it'll be done. But put it at the bottom and lower the steam and you won't get the steam up even if you cook it for six months. He must be wet behind the ears if he says that Pig should be put on the bottom tray because he's hard to cook.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;if he followed your advice I'd be slaughtered alive. When he can't see the steam rising he'll take the lid off, turn me over and make the fire burn hotter. I'll be cooked on both sides and half done in the middle.&#8221;</P>
<P>As they were talking a junior devil came in to report that the water was boiling. The senior chief ordered that the monks be carried in, and all the demons acted together to carry Pig to the lowest shelf of the steamer and Friar Sand to the second shelf.</P>
<P>Guessing that they would be coming for him next Brother Monkey freed himself and said, &#8220;This lamplight is just right for some action.&#8221; He then pulled out a hair, blew on it with magic breath, called, &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned it into another Monkey he tied up with the hempen rope while extracting his real self in spirit form to spring into mid-air, look down and watch. Not realizing his deception, the crowd of demons picked up the false Monkey they saw and carried him to the third tray of the steamer, near the top. Only then did they drag the Tang Priest to the ground, tie him up, and put him into the fourth tray. As the dry firewood was stacked up a fierce fire blazed.</P>
<P>&#8220;My Pig and Friar Sand can stand a couple of boilings,&#8221; sighed the Great Sage up in the clouds, &#8220;but that master of mine will be cooked tender as soon as the water boils. If I can't save him by magic he'll be dead in next to no time.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage made a hand-spell in mid-air, said the magic words &#8220;<I>Om</I> the blue pure dharma world; true is the eternal beneficence of Heaven,&#8221; and summoned the Dragon King of the Northern Ocean to him.</P>
<P>A black cloud appeared among the other clouds, and from it there came at once an answering shout, &#8220;Ao Shun, the humble dragon of the Northern Ocean, kowtows in homage.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Arise, arise,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I would not have ventured to trouble you for nothing. I've now got this far with my master the Tang Priest. He's been captured by vicious monsters and put into an iron steamer to be cooked. Go and protect him for me and don't let the steam harm him.&#8221; The dragon king at once turned himself into a cold wind that blew underneath the cooking pot and coiled around to shield it from all the heat of the fire. Thus were the three of them saved from death.</P>
<P>As the third watch was drawing to an end the senior demon chief announced a decision. &#8220;My men,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we have worn out brains and brawn to capture the Tang Priest and his three disciples. Because of the trouble we went to in escorting them we have not slept for four days and nights. I don't think that they'll be able to escape now that they're tied up and being steamed. You are all to guard them carefully. Ten of your junior devils are to take it in turns to keep the fires burning while we withdraw to our living quarters for a little rest. By the fifth watch, when it's about to get light, they're bound to be cooked tender. Have some garlic paste, salt and vinegar ready and wake us up; then we'll be able to eat them with a good appetite.&#8221; The devils did as they had been ordered while the three demon chiefs returned to their sleeping chambers.</P>
<P>Up in the clouds Brother Monkey clearly heard these instructions being given, so he brought his cloud down. As there was no sound of voices from inside the steamer he thought, &#8220;The fire is blazing away and they must be feeling hot. Why aren't they afraid? Why aren't they saying anything? Hmm... Could they have been steamed to death? Let me go closer and listen.&#8221; The splendid Great Sage shook himself as he stood on his cloud and turned into a black fly. As he alighted on the outside of the iron steamer's trays to listen he heard Pig saying inside, &#8220;What lousy luck! What lousy luck! I wonder whether we're being closed-steamed or open-steamed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean by 'closed' and 'open,' brother?&#8221; Friar Sand asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Closed steaming is when they cover the steamer and open steaming is when they don't,&#8221; Pig replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciples,&#8221; said Sanzang from the top tray, &#8220;the cover is off.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We're in luck!&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;We won't be killed tonight. We're being open-steamed.&#8221; Having heard all three of them talking Monkey realized that they were still alive, so he flew away, fetched the iron steamer lid and placed it lightly on the steamer.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciples,&#8221; exclaimed Sanzang in alarm, &#8220;they've covered us up.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's done it,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;That means closed steaming. We're bound to die tonight.&#8221; Friar Sand and the venerable elder started to sob.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't cry,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;A new shift of cooks has come on duty.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you tell?&#8221; Friar Sand asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I was delighted at first when they carried me here,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;I've got a bit of a feverish chill and I wanted warming up. But all we're getting at the moment is cold air. Hey! Mr. Cook, sir! What are you making such a fuss about putting more firewood on for? Am I asking for what's yours?&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he could not help laughing to himself. &#8220;Stupid clod,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;Being cold is bearable. If it got hot you'd be dead. The secret will get out if he goes on talking. I'd better rescue him.... No! I'd have to turn back into myself to rescue them, and if I did that the ten cooks would see me and start shouting. That would disturb the old monsters and I'd be put to a lot more trouble. I'll have to use some magic on the cooks first.&#8221; Then a memory came back to him.</P>
<P>&#8220;When I was the Great Sage in the old days I once played a guessing game with the Heavenly King Lokapala at the Northern Gate of Heaven and won some of his sleep insects off him. I've got a few left I can use on them.&#8221; He felt around his waist inside his belt and found that he had twelve of them left.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll give them ten and keep two to breed from,&#8221; Monkey thought. Then he threw the insects into the ten junior devils' faces, where the insects went up their nostrils, so that they all started feeling drowsy, lay down and went to sleep. One of them, however, who was holding a fire-fork slept very fitfully, kept rubbing his head and face, pinching his nose and continuously sneezing. &#8220;That so-and-so knows a trick or two,&#8221; thought Monkey. &#8220;I'll have to give him a double dose.&#8221; He threw one of his remaining insects into the demon's face.</P>
<P>&#8220;With two insects the left one can go in when the right one comes out and vice versa,&#8221; Monkey thought. &#8220;That should keep him quiet.&#8221; With that the junior demon gave two or three big yawns, stretched himself, dropped the fork and slumped down, fast asleep. He did not get up again.</P>
<P>&#8220;What marvellous magic; it really works,&#8221; said Monkey, turning back into himself. Then he went close to the steamer and called, &#8220;Master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Rescue me, Wukong,&#8221; said the Tang Priest when he heard him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Is that you calling to us from outside?&#8221; Friar Sand asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;If I weren't out here would you prefer me to be suffering in there with you?&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;you slipped off and left us to carry the can. We're being closed-steamed in here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop yelling, idiot,&#8221; said Monkey with a laugh. &#8220;I'm here to rescue you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;if you're going to rescue us do it properly. Don't get us put back in here for another steaming.&#8221; Monkey then took the lid off, freed the master, shook the hair of his that he had turned into an imitation Monkey and put it back on his body, then released Friar Sand and Pig, taking one tray at a time. As soon as he was untied, the idiot wanted to run away.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be in such a hurry!&#8221; said Monkey, who recited the words of a spell that released the dragon before going on to say to Pig, &#8220;We've still got high mountains and steep ridges ahead of us on our way to the Western Heaven. The going's too heavy for the master&#8212;he isn't a strong walker. Wait till I've fetched the horse.&#8221;</P>
<P>Watch him as with light step he goes to the throne hall, where he saw that all the demons young and old were asleep. He undid the rope attached to the horse's reins, being even more careful not to alarm him. Now the horse was a dragon horse, so had Monkey been a stranger he would have given him a couple of flying kicks and whinnied. But Monkey had kept horses and held the office of Protector of the Horses, and this horse was besides their own. That was why the animal neither reared nor whinnied. Monkey led the horse very quietly over, tightened the girth and got everything ready before inviting his master to mount. Trembling and shaking, the Tang Priest did so. He too wanted to go.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't you be in such a hurry either,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;There'll be plenty more kings along our journey West and we'll need our passport if we're to get there. What other identity papers do we have? I'm going back to find the luggage.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I remember that when we came in the monsters put the luggage to the left of the throne hall,&#8221; said the Tang Priest. &#8220;The loads must still be there.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Understood,&#8221; said Monkey, who sprang off at once to search for it by the throne hall. When he suddenly saw shimmering lights of many colours Brother Monkey knew that they came from the luggage. How did he know? Because the light came from the night-shining pearl on the Tang Priest's cassock. He rushed towards it and found that their load was unopened, so he took it out and gave it to Friar Sand to carry. While Pig guided the horse, the Great Sage took the lead.</P>
<P>They were hurrying to go straight out through the main Southern gate when they heard the noise of watchmen's clappers and bells. They found the gates locked and paper seals over the locks.</P>
<P>&#8220;How are we going to get out if the place is so closely guarded?&#8221; Monkey wondered.</P>
<P>&#8220;Let's get out the back door,&#8221; said Pig. With Monkey leading the way they rushed straight to the back gates.</P>
<P>&#8220;I can hear clappers and bells outside the back gates as well, and they're sealed too,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;What are we to do? If it weren't for the Tang Priest's mortal body it wouldn't bother us three: we could get away by cloud and wind. But the Tang Priest hasn't escaped from the Three Worlds and is still confined within the Five Elements. All his bones are the unclean ones he got from his mother and father. He can't lift himself into the air and he'll never get away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No time for talking now, brother,&#8221; said Pig: &#8220;Let's go somewhere where there aren't any bells, clappers or guards, lift the master up and climb over the wall.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That won't do,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;We could lift him over now because we've got to, but you've got such a big mouth you'd tell people everywhere when we're taking the scriptures back that we're the sort of monks who sneak over people's walls.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But we can't bother about behaving properly now,&#8221; replied Pig. &#8220;We've got to save our skins.&#8221; Monkey had no choice but to do as he suggested, so they went up to wall and worked out how to climb over.</P>
<P>Oh dear! Things would have to work out this way: Sanzang was not yet free of his unlucky star. The three demon chiefs who had been fast asleep in their living quarters suddenly awoke and, fearing that the Tang Priest had escaped, got up, threw on their clothes and hurried to the throne hall of the palace.</P>
<P>&#8220;How many times has the Tang Priest been steamed?&#8221; they asked. The junior devils who were looking after the fires were all so soundly asleep because the sleep insects were in them that not even blows could wake them up.</P>
<P>The chiefs woke up some others who were not on duty, who answered rashly, &#8220;Ss...ss...seven times.&#8221; Then they rushed over to the steamer to see the steamer trays lying scattered on the floor and the cooks still asleep.</P>
<P>In their alarm they rushed back to report, &#8220;Your Majesties, th...th...they've escaped.&#8221;</P>
<P>The three demon chiefs came out of the throne hall to take a close look around the cauldron. They saw that the steamer trays were indeed scattered on the floor, the water was stonecold and the fire completely out. The cooks supposed to be tending the fire were still so fast asleep that they were snoring noisily.</P>
<P>The fiends were all so shocked that they all shouted, &#8220;Catch the Tang Priest! At once! Catch the Tang Priest!&#8221; Their yells woke up the demons senior and junior all around. They rushed in a crowd to the main front gates carrying their swords and spears.</P>
<P>Seeing that the sealed locks had not been touched and that the night watchmen were still sounding their clappers and bells they asked the watchman, &#8220;Which way did the Tang Priest go?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Nobody's come out,&#8221; the watchmen all replied. They hurried to the back gates of the palace, only to find that the seals, locks, clappers and bells were the same as at the front. With a great commotion they grabbed lanterns and torches, making the sky red and the place as bright as day. The four of them were clearly lit up as they climbed over the wall.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where do you think you're going?&#8221; the senior demon chief shouted, running towards them and so terrifying the reverend gentleman that the muscles in his legs turned soft and numb and he fell off the wall to be captured by the senior demon. The second demon chief seized Friar Sand and the third knocked Pig over and captured him. The other demons took the luggage and the white horse. Only Monkey escaped.</P>
<P>&#8220;May Heaven kill him,&#8221; Pig grumbled under his breath about Monkey. &#8220;I said that if he was going to rescue us he ought to do a thorough job of it. As it is we're going to be put back in the steamer for another steaming.&#8221;</P>
<P>The monsters took the Tang Priest into the throne hall but did not steam him again. The second demon chief ordered that Pig was to be tied to one of the columns supporting the eaves in front of the hall and the third chief had Friar Sand tied to one of the columns holding up the eaves at the back. The senior chief clung to the Tang Priest and would not let go of him.</P>
<P>&#8220;What are you holding him for, elder brother?&#8221; the third demon asked. &#8220;Surely you're not going to eat him alive. That wouldn't be at all interesting. He's no ordinary idiot to be gobbled up just to fill your stomach. He's a rare delicacy from a superior country. We should keep him till we have some free time one rainy day, then bring him out to be carefully cooked and enjoyed with drinking games and fine music.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;A very good suggestion, brother,&#8221; replied the senior demon with a smile, &#8220;but Sun the Novice would come and steal him again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In our palace we have a Brocade Fragrance Pavilion,&#8221; said the third demon, &#8220;and in the pavilion is an iron chest. I think we should put the Tang Priest into the chest, shut up the pavilion, put out a rumour that we have already eaten him half raw and get all the junior devils in the city talking about it. That Sun the Novice is bound to come back to find out what's happening, and when he hears this he'll be so miserably disappointed that he'll go away. If he doesn't come to make trouble for another four or five days we can bring the Tang Priest out to enjoy at our leisure. What do you think?&#8221;</P>
<P>The senior and second demon chiefs were both delighted. &#8220;Yes, yes, you're right, brother,&#8221; they said. That very night the poor Tang Priest was taken inside the palace, put into the chest and locked up in the pavilion. We will not tell how the rumour was spread and became the talk of the town.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Instead the story tells how Monkey escaped that night by cloud, unable to look after the Tang Priest. He went straight to Lion Cave where he wiped out all the tens of thousands of junior demons with his cudgel to his complete satisfaction. By the time he had hurried back to the city the sun was rising in the East. He did not dare challenge the demons to battle because</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>No thread can be spun from a single strand;</P>
<P>Nobody can clap with a single hand.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>So he brought his cloud down, shook himself, turned himself into a junior demon and slipped in through the gates to collect news in the streets and back alleys. &#8220;The Tang Priest was eaten raw by the senior king during the night,&#8221; was what all the people in the city were saying wherever he went. This made Brother Monkey really anxious. When he went to look at the throne hall in the palace he saw that there were many spirits constantly coming and going. They were wearing leather and metal helmets and yellow cotton tunics. In their hands they held red lacquered staves, and ivory passes hung at their waists.</P>
<P>&#8220;These must be evil spirits who are allowed in the inner quarters of the palace,&#8221; thought Monkey. &#8220;I'll turn myself into one, go in and see what I can find out.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage then made himself identical to the demons and slipped in through the inner gates of the palace. As he was walking along he saw Pig tied to one of the columns of the throne hall, groaning.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wuneng,&#8221; Monkey said, going up to him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Is that you, brother?&#8221; asked the idiot, recognizing his voice. &#8220;Save me!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll save you,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Do you know where the master is?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He's done for,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;The evil spirits ate him raw last night.&#8221; At this Monkey burst into sobs and the tears gushed out like water from a spring.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't cry, brother,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;I've only heard the junior devils gossiping. I didn't see it with my own eyes. Don't waste any more time. Go on and find out more.&#8221; Only then did Monkey dry his tears and go to search in the inner part of the palace.</P>
<P>Noticing Friar Sand tied to a column at the back of the palace he went up to him, felt his chest and said, &#8220;Wujing.&#8221;</P>
<P>Friar Sand also recognized his voice and said, &#8220;Brother, is that you here in disguise? Save me! Save me!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Saving you will be easy,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;but do you know where the master is?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother!&#8221; said Friar Sand in tears. &#8220;The evil spirits couldn't even wait to steam the master. They've eaten him raw.&#8221;</P>
<P>Now that both of them had told him the same story the Great Sage was cut to the heart. Instead of rescuing Pig and Friar Sand he sprang straight up into the sky and went to the mountain East of the city, where he landed his cloud and let himself weep aloud.</P>
<P>&#8220;Poor Master,&#8221; he said:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;I fought against heaven, was caught in its net,</P>
<P>Till you came along and delivered me, Master.</P>
<P>It became my ambition to worship the Buddha;</P>
<P>I strove to eliminate fiendish disaster.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;I never imagined that now you'd be murdered</P>
<P>And I would have failed on your journey to keep you.</P>
<P>The lands of the West were too good for your fate.</P>
<P>Your life's at an end: in what way can I help you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Deep in misery, Monkey said to himself, &#8220;It's all the fault of our Buddha, the Tathagata, who had nothing better to do in his paradise than make the three stores of scriptures. If he really wanted to convert people to be good he ought to have sent them to the East himself. Then they would have been passed on for ever. But he couldn't bring himself to part with them. He had to make us go to fetch them. Who'd ever have thought that after all the trouble of crossing a thousand mountains the master would lose his life here today? Oh well! I'll ride my somersault cloud to see the Tathagata Buddha and tell him what's happened. If he's willing to give me the scriptures to deliver to the East then the good achievement will be propagated and we'll be able to fulfil our vow. If he won't give me them I'll get him to recite the Band-loosening Spell. Then I can take the band off, return it to him and go back to my own cave to play the king and enjoy myself again.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage jumped to his feet and went straight to India on his somersault cloud. In less than a couple of hours he could see the Vulture Peak in the near distance, and an instant later he had landed his cloud and was heading straight for the foot of the peak. He looked up and saw the four vajrapanis blocking his way and asking him where he was going.</P>
<P>&#8220;There's something I want to see the Tathagata about,&#8221; Monkey replied with a bow.</P>
<P>Next he was faced by the Vajrapani Yongzhu, the indestructible king of Golden Glow Ridge on Mount Kunlun, who shouted, &#8220;Macaque, you're an outrage! When the Bull Demon King was giving you such terrible trouble we all helped you, but now you've come to see us today you're showing no manners at all. If you're here on business you should submit a memorial first and wait till you're summoned before going any further. This isn't like the Southern Gate of Heaven, where you can come and go as you please. Clear off! Out of the way!&#8221;</P>
<P>Being told off like this when he was feeling so depressed drove Monkey into thundering roars of fury, and his uncontrollable shouts and yells soon disturbed the Tathagata.</P>
<P>The Tathagata Buddha was sitting on his nine-level lotus throne expounding the sutras to his eighteen arhats when he said, &#8220;Sun Wukong is here. You must all go out to receive him.&#8221; In obedience to the Buddha's command the arhats went out in two columns with their banners and canopies.</P>
<P>&#8220;Great Sage Sun,&#8221; they said in greeting, &#8220;the Tathagata has commanded us to summon you to his presence.&#8221; Only then did the four vajrapanis at the monastery gates step aside to let Monkey enter. The arhats led him to the foot of the lotus throne, where he went down to kowtow on seeing the Tathagata. He was sobbing and weeping.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said the Buddha, &#8220;what makes you weep so miserably?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your disciple has often received the grace of your instruction,&#8221; Brother Monkey replied, &#8220;and has committed himself to the school of Lord Buddha. Since being converted to the true achievement I have taken the Tang Priest as my master and been protecting him on our journey. No words could describe what we have suffered. We have now reached the city of Leonia near Lion Cave on Lion Mountain where three vicious monsters, the Lion King, the Elephant King and the Great Roc, seized my master. All of us disciples of his were in a very bad way too, tied up and put in a steamer to suffer the agony of fire and boiling water. Fortunately I was able to get away and summon a dragon king to save the others. But we could not escape our evil star: the master and the others were recaptured when I was trying to sneak them out last night. When I went back into the city this morning to find out what had happened I learned that those utterly evil and ferocious monsters ate my master raw during the night. Nothing is left of his flesh and bones. On top of that my fellow-disciples Wuneng and Wujing are tied up there and will soon be dead too. I'm desperate. That's why your disciple has come to visit the Tathagata. I beg you in your great compassion to recite the Band-loosening Spell so that I can take the band off my head and give it back to you. Let your disciple go back to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit and enjoy himself.&#8221; Before he had finished saying this the tears welled up again. There was no end to his howls of misery.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't upset yourself so, Wukong,&#8221; said the Tathagata with a smile. &#8220;You can't beat those evil spirits. Their magical powers are more than you can handle. That is why you are so unhappy.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey knelt below the Buddha and beat his breast as he replied, &#8220;Truly, Tathagata, I made havoc in Heaven all those years ago and was called Great Sage. Never in all my life had I been beaten before I met these vicious monsters.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop being so sorry for yourself,&#8221; said the Tathagata. &#8220;I know those evil spirits.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Tathagata!&#8221; Monkey suddenly blurted out. &#8220;They say those evil spirits are relations of yours.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wicked macaque!&#8221; said the Tathagata. &#8220;How could an evil spirit be any relation of mine?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If they're not relations of yours how come you know them?&#8221; retorted Monkey with a grin.</P>
<P>&#8220;I know them because I see them with my all-seeing eyes,&#8221; the Buddha replied. &#8220;The senior demon and the second demon have masters. Ananda, Kasyapa, come here. One of you is to take a cloud to Mount Wutai and the other to Mount Emei. Summon Manjusri and Samantabhadra to come and see me.&#8221; The two arhats left at once as they had been commanded. &#8220;They are the masters of the senior and the second demon chiefs. But the third demon does have some connection with me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;On his mother's or his father's side?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;When the primal chaos was first separated the heavens opened up in the hour of the rat and the earth at the hour of the ox,&#8221; the Buddha replied. &#8220;Mankind was born at the tiger hour. Then heaven and earth came together again and all living creatures were born, including beasts that walk and birds that fly. The unicorn is the most senior of the beasts that walk and the phoenix is the most senior of the birds that fly. When the phoenixes combined their essential spirit they gave birth to the peafowl and the Great Roc. When the peafowl came into the world she was the most evil of creatures and a man-eater. She could devour all the people for fifteen miles around in a single mouthful. When I was cultivating my sixteen-foot golden body on the peak of the snowy mountain she swallowed me as well. I went down into her belly. I wanted to escape through her backside, but for fear of soiling my body I cut my way out through her backbone and climbed Vulture Peak. I would have killed her, but all the Buddha host dissuaded me: to kill the peahen would have been like killing my own mother. So I kept her at my assembly on Vulture Peak and appointed her as the Buddha-mother, the Great Illustrious Peahen Queen Bodhisattva. The Great Roc was born of the same mother as she was. That is why we are relations of a kind.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he said with a smile, &#8220;By that line of argument, Tathagata, you're the evil spirit's nephew.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I shall have to go and subdue that demon in person,&#8221; the Tathagata said. Monkey kowtowed as he respectfully replied, &#8220;I beg you to condescend to grant us your illustrious presence.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Tathagata then came down from his lotus throne and went out through the monastery gates with all the Buddha host just as Ananda and Kasyapa arrived bringing Manjusri and Samantabhadra. These two Bodhisattvas bowed to the Tathagata, who asked them, &#8220;How long have your animals been away from your mountains, Bodhisattvas?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Seven days,&#8221; said Manjusri.</P>
<P>&#8220;A mere seven days on your mountains is several thousand years in the mortal world,&#8221; the Tathagata replied. &#8220;Goodness knows how many living beings they have destroyed there. Come with me to recapture them at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>The two Bodhisattvas traveled at the Buddha's left and right hand as they flew through the air with the host. This is what could be seen:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The shimmering clouds of blessing parted for Lord Buddha</P>
<P>As in his great compassion he came down from his shrine.</P>
<P>He taught the truth about all beings since creation,</P>
<P>Explaining how everything had been transformed in time.</P>
<P>Before him went five hundred holy arhats;</P>
<P>Behind him were three thousand guardians of the faith.</P>
<P>Ananda and Kasyapa were both in close attendance;</P>
<P>Samantabhadra and Manjusri came to conquer monsters.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Great Sage had been granted this favour and succeeded in bringing the Lord Buddha and his host with him. It was not long before the city was in sight. &#8220;Tathagata,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;that's Leonia, where the black vapors are coming from.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You go down into the city first,&#8221; said the Tathagata, &#8220;and start a fight with the evil spirits. Do not win. You must lose and come back up. Leave it to us to recapture them.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Great Sage then brought his cloud straight down to land on the city wall, where he stood on the battlements and shouted abusively, &#8220;Evil beasts! Come out and fight me at once!&#8221; This caused such consternation among the junior demons in the towers on the wall that they jumped straight down into the city to report, &#8220;Your Majesties, Sun the Novice is on the wall, challenging us to battle.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That ape hasn't been here for two or three days,&#8221; the senior demon replied. &#8220;Now he's back challenging us to battle. Can he have fetched some reinforcements?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He's nothing to be scared of,&#8221; said the third demon chief. &#8220;Let's all go and have a look.&#8221; The three chieftains, all carrying their weapons, hurried up on the wall where they saw Monkey. Without a word they raised their weapons and thrust at him. Monkey held them off by swinging his iron cudgel. When they had fought seven or eight rounds Monkey feigned defeat and fled.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where do you think you're going?&#8221; the demon king asked with a mighty shout, and with a somersault Monkey sprang up into mid-air. The three spirits went after him on clouds, but Monkey slipped aside and disappeared completely in the Lord Buddha's golden aura.</P>
<P>All that could be seen were the images of the Three Buddhas of Past, Future and Present, the five hundred arhats and the three thousand Protectors of the Faith who spread all around, encircling the three demon kings so closely that not even a drop of water could leak through.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is terrible, my brother,&#8221; said the senior demon chief, lashing out wildly, &#8220;that ape is a really sharp operator. How did he manage to bring my master here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be afraid, elder brother,&#8221; said the third demon. &#8220;If we all charge together we can cut down the Tathagata with our swords and spears and seize his Thunder Monastery.&#8221; The demons, who had no sense of proper behavior, really did raise their swords to charge forward, hacking wildly.</P>
<P>Manjusri and Samantabhadra recited the words of a spell and shouted, &#8220;Won't you repent now, evil beasts? What else do you hope for?&#8221; The senior and the second demon chiefs gave up the struggle, threw down their weapons, rolled and reverted to their true images. The two Bodhisattvas threw their lotus thrones on the demons' backs and flew over to sit on them. The two demons then gave up and submitted.</P>
<P>Now that the blue lion and the white elephant had been captured only the third evil monster was still unsubdued. Spreading its wings it dropped its heaven-square halberd and rose straight up to try to catch the Monkey King with a swing of its sharp talons, but as the Great Sage was biding in the golden aura the demon dared get nowhere near him. When the<I></I> Tathagata realized what it was trying to do he made his golden aura flash and shook his head, the supreme meditator in the wind, to turn the creature into a bright red lump of bloody meat. The evil spirit seized it with a flourish of its sharp talons, whereupon the Lord Buddha pointed upwards with his hand, destroying the muscles in the monster's wings. It could not fly or get away from the top of the Buddha's head, and it reverted to its true appearance as a golden-winged vulture.</P>
<P>Opening its beak it said to the Buddha, &#8220;Tathagata, why did you use your great dharma powers to catch me like this?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You have been doing much evil here,&#8221; the Tathagata replied. &#8220;Come with me and you will win credit for a good deed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You eat vegetarian food in great poverty and suffering at your place,&#8221; the evil spirit replied, &#8220;but here I can eat human flesh and live in no end of luxury. If you kill me by starvation you'll be guilty of a sin.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In the four continents I control countless living beings who worship me,&#8221; the Buddha replied, &#8220;and whenever they are going to perform a service to me I shall tell them to make a sacrifice to you first.&#8221; The Great Roc would have escaped and got away if it could. As it was he had no choice but to accept conversion.</P>
<P>Only then did Monkey emerge to kowtow to the Tathagata and say, &#8220;Lord Buddha, today you have captured the evil spirits and removed a great bane, but my master is dead.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this the Great Roc said bitterly as it ground its teeth, &#8220;Damned ape! Why did you have to bring these ferocious men here to persecute me? I never ate that old monk of yours. He's in the Brocade Fragrance Pavilion now, isn't he?&#8221; When Monkey heard this he quickly kowtowed to thank the Lord Buddha. Not daring to release the Great Roc, the Buddha made him into a guardian of the dharma in his brilliant halo then led his host back to his monastery on their clouds. Monkey landed his cloud and went straight into the city, where there was not a single junior demon left. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A snake cannot move without its head;</P>
<P>A bird cannot fly without its wings.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>They had all fled for their lives when they saw the Buddha capturing their evil kings.</P>
<P>Monkey then freed Pig and Friar Sand, found the luggage and the horse, and said to his fellow-disciples, &#8220;The master hasn't been eaten. Come with me.&#8221; He took the two of them straight into the inner compound where they found the Brocade Fragrance Pavilion. Opening the door and looking inside they saw an iron trunk from which could be heard the sound of Sanzang weeping.</P>
<P>Friar Sand used his demon-quelling staff to open the iron cage over the chest and raise its lid. &#8220;Master,&#8221; he called.</P>
<P>At the sight of them Sanzang wept aloud and said, &#8220;Disciples, how were the demons beaten? How did you manage to find me here?&#8221; Monkey told him all the details of what had happened from beginning to end and Sanzang expressed boundless gratitude. Then master and disciples found some rice in the palace and ate their fill of it before packing their things and leaving the city along the main road West. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Only a true man can find the true scriptures;</P>
<P>The will's shouts and the heart's labors are in vain.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know when on this journey they were to see the Tathagata listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>群魔欺本性</p>
<p>一体拜真如</p>
</div>
<p>且不言唐长老困苦，却说那三个魔头齐心竭力，与大圣兄弟三人，在城东半山内努力争持。这一场，正是那铁刷帚刷铜锅，家家挺硬。好杀：六般体相六般兵，六样形骸六样情。六恶六根缘六欲，六门六道赌输赢。三十六宫春自在，六六形色恨有名。这一个金箍棒，千般解数；那一个方天戟，百样峥嵘。八戒钉钯凶更猛，二怪长枪俊又能。小沙僧宝杖非凡，有心打死；</p>

<p>老魔头钢刀快利，举手无情。这三个是护卫真僧无敌将，那三个是乱法欺君泼野精。起初犹可，向后弥凶。六枚都使升空法，云端里面各翻腾。一时间吐雾喷云天地暗，哮哮吼吼只闻声。</p>

<p>他六个斗罢多时，渐渐天晚。却又是风雾漫漫，霎时间，就黑暗了。原来八戒耳大，盖着眼皮，越发昏蒙，手脚慢，又遮架不住，拖着钯，败阵就走，被老魔举刀砍去，几乎伤命，幸躲过头脑，被口刀削断几根鬃毛，赶上张开口咬着领头，拿入城中，丢与小怪，捆在金銮殿。老妖又驾云，起在半空助力。沙和尚见事不谐，虚幌着宝杖，顾本身回头便走，被二怪捽开鼻子，响一声，连手卷住，拿到城里，也叫小妖捆在殿下，却又腾空去叫拿行者。行者见两个兄弟遭擒，他自家独力难撑，正是好手不敌双拳，双拳难敌四手。他喊一声，把棍子隔开三个妖魔的兵器，纵筋斗驾云走了。三怪见行者驾筋斗时，即抖抖身，现了本象，扇开两翅，赶上大圣。你道他怎能赶上？当时如行者闹天宫，十万天兵也拿他不住者，以他会驾筋斗云，一去有十万八千里路，所以诸神不能赶上。这妖精搧一翅就有九万里，两搧就赶过了，所以被他一把挝住，拿在手中，左右挣挫不得。欲思要走，莫能逃脱，即使变化法遁法，又往来难行：变大些儿，他就放松了挝住；变小些儿，他又揝紧了挝住。复拿了径回城内，放了手，捽下尘埃，吩咐群妖，也照八戒、沙僧捆在一处。那老魔、二魔俱下来迎接。三个魔头，同上宝殿。噫！这一番倒不是捆住行者，分明是与他送行。</p>

<p>此时有二更时候，众怪一齐相见毕，把唐僧推下殿来。那长老于灯光前，忽见三个徒弟都捆在地下，老师父伏于行者身边，哭道：“徒弟啊！常时逢难，你却在外运用神通，到那里取救降魔，今番你亦遭擒，我贫僧怎么得命！”八戒、沙僧听见师父这般苦楚，便也一齐放声痛哭。行者微微笑道：“师父放心，兄弟莫哭！凭他怎的，决然无伤。等那老魔安静了，我们走路。”</p>

<p>八戒道：“哥啊，又来捣鬼了！麻绳捆住，松些儿还着水喷，想你这瘦人儿不觉，我这胖的遭瘟哩！不信，你看两膊上，入肉已有二寸，如何脱身？”行者笑道：“莫说是麻绳捆的，就是碗粗的棕缆，只也当秋风过耳，何足罕哉！”师徒们正说处，只闻得那老魔道：“三贤弟有力量，有智谋，果成妙计，拿将唐僧来了！”叫：</p>

<p>“小的们，着五个打水，七个刷锅，十个烧火，二十个抬出铁笼来，把那四个和尚蒸熟，我兄弟们受用，各散一块儿与小的们吃，也教他个个长生。”八戒听见，战兢兢的道：“哥哥，你听，那妖精计较要蒸我们吃哩！”行者道：“不要怕，等我看他是维儿妖精，是把势妖精。”沙和尚哭道：“哥呀！且不要说宽话，如今已与阎王隔壁哩，且讲甚么雏儿把势！”说不了，又听得二怪说：“猪八戒不好蒸。”八戒欢喜道：“阿弥陀佛，是那个积阴骘的，说我不好蒸？”三怪道：“不好蒸，剥了皮蒸。”八戒慌了，厉声喊道：“不要剥皮！粗自粗，汤响就烂了！”老怪道：“不好蒸的，安在底下一格。”行者笑道：“八戒莫怕，是雏儿，不是把势。”沙僧道：“怎么认得？”行者道：“大凡蒸东西，都从上边起。</p>

<p>不好蒸的，安在上头一格，多烧把火，圆了气，就好了；若安在底下，一住了气，就烧半年也是不得气上的。他说八戒不好蒸，安在底下，不是雏儿是甚的！”八戒道：“哥啊，依你说，就活活的弄杀人了！他打紧见不上气，抬开了，把我翻转过来，再烧起火，弄得我两边俱熟，中间不夹生了？”正讲时，又见小妖来报：</p>

<p>“汤滚了。”老怪传令叫抬。众妖一齐上手，将八戒抬在底下一格，沙僧抬在二格。行者估着来抬他，他就脱身道：“此灯光前好做手脚！”拔下一根毫毛，吹口仙气，叫声“变！”即变做一个行者，捆了麻绳，将真身出神，跳在半空里，低头看着。那群妖那知真假，见人就抬，把个“假行者”抬在上三格；才将唐僧揪翻倒捆住，抬上第四格。干柴架起，烈火气焰腾腾。大圣在云端里嗟叹道：“我那八戒沙僧，还捱得两滚，我那师父，只消一滚就烂。若不用法救他，顷刻丧矣！”好行者，在空中捻着诀，念一声“唵蓝净法界，乾元亨利贞”的咒语，拘唤得北海龙王早至。只见那云端里一朵乌云，应声高叫道：“北海小龙敖顺叩头。”行者道：“请起！请起！无事不敢相烦，今与唐师父到此，被毒魔拿住，上铁笼蒸哩。你去与我护持护持，莫教蒸坏了。”</p>

<p>龙王随即将身变作一阵冷风，吹入锅下，盘旋围护，更没火气烧锅。他三人方不损命。</p>

<p>将有三更尽时，只闻得老魔发放道：“手下的，我等用计劳形，拿了唐僧四众，又因相送辛苦，四昼夜未曾得睡。今已捆在笼里，料应难脱，汝等用心看守，着十个小妖轮流烧火，让我们退宫，略略安寝。到五更天色将明，必然烂了，可安排下蒜泥盐醋，请我们起来，空心受用。”众妖各各遵命，三个魔头却各转寝宫而去。行者在云端里，明明听着这等吩咐，却低下云头，不听见笼里人声。他想着：“火气上腾，必然也热，他们怎么不怕，又无言语？哼喷！莫敢是蒸死了？等我近前再听。”好大圣，踏着云，摇身一变，变作一个黑苍蝇儿，钉在铁笼格外听时，只闻得八戒在里面道：“晦气，晦气！不知是闷气蒸，又不知是出气蒸哩。”沙僧道：“二哥，怎么叫做闷气、出气？”八戒道：“闷气蒸是盖了笼头，出气蒸不盖。”三藏在浮上一层应声道：“徒弟，不曾盖。”八戒道：“造化！今夜还不得死！这是出气蒸了！”行者听得他三人都说话，未曾伤命，便就飞了去，把个铁笼盖，轻轻儿盖上。三藏慌了道：“徒弟！盖上了！”八戒道：“罢了！这个是闷气蒸，今夜必是死了！”沙僧与长老嘤嘤的啼哭。八戒道：</p>

<p>“且不要哭，这一会烧火的换了班了。”沙僧道：“你怎么知道？”</p>

<p>八戒道：“早先抬上来时，正合我意：我有些儿寒湿气的病，要他腾腾。这会子反冷气上来了。咦！烧火的长官，添上些柴便怎的？要了你的哩！”行者听见，忍不住暗笑道：“这个夯货！冷还好捱，若热就要伤命。再说两遭，一定走了风了，快早救他。</p>

<p>且住！要救他须是要现本相。假如现了，这十个烧火的看见，一齐乱喊，惊动老怪，却不又费事？等我先送他个法儿。”忽想起：“我当初做大圣时，曾在北天门与护国天王猜枚耍子，赢得他瞌睡虫儿，还有几个，送了他罢。”即往腰间顺带里摸摸，还有十二个。“送他十个，还留两个做种。”即将虫儿抛了去，散在十个小妖脸上，钻入鼻孔，渐渐打盹，都睡倒了。只有一个拿火叉的，睡不稳，揉头搓脸，把鼻子左捏右捏，不住的打喷嚏。行者道：“这厮晓得勾当了，我再与他个双掭灯。”又将一个虫儿抛在他脸上。“两个虫儿，左进右出，右出左进，谅有一个安住。”那小妖两三个大呵欠，把腰伸一伸，丢了火叉，也扑的睡倒，再不翻身。</p>

<p>行者道：“这法儿真是妙而且灵！”即现原身，走近前叫声“师父。”唐僧听见道：“悟空，救我啊！”沙僧道：“哥哥，你在外面叫哩？”行者道：“我不在外面，好和你们在里边受罪？”八戒道：“哥啊，溜撒的溜了，我们都是顶缸的，在此受闷气哩！”行者笑道：“呆子莫嚷，我来救你。”八戒道：“哥啊，救便要脱根救，莫又要复蒸笼。”行者却揭开笼头，解了师父，将假变的毫毛，抖了一抖，收上身来，又一层层放了沙僧，放了八戒。那呆子才解了，巴不得就要跑。行者道：“莫忙！莫忙！”却又念声咒语，发放了龙神，才对八戒道：“我们这去到西天，还有高山峻岭，师父没脚力难行，等我还将马来。！你看他轻手轻脚，走到金銮殿下，见那些大小群妖俱睡熟了，却解了缰绳，更不惊动。</p>

<p>那马原是龙马，若是生人飞踢两脚，便嘶几声，行者曾养过马，授弼马温之官，又是自家一伙，所以不跳不叫。悄悄的牵来，束紧了肚带，扣备停当，请师父上马。长老战兢兢的骑上，也就要走，行者道：“也且莫忙，我们西去还有国王，须要关文，方才去得，不然，将甚执照？等我还去寻行李来。”唐僧道：“我记得进门时，众怪将行李放在金殿左手下，担儿也在那一边。”行者道：“我晓得了。”即抽身跳在宝殿寻时，忽见光彩飘飖。行者知是行李，怎么就知？以唐僧的锦襕袈裟上有夜明珠，故此放光。</p>

<p>急到前，见担儿原封未动，连忙拿下去，付与沙僧挑着。八戒牵着马，他引了路，径奔正阳门。只听得梆铃乱响，门上有锁，锁上贴了封皮。行者道：“这等防守，如何去得？”八戒道：“后门里去罢。”行者引路径奔后门：“后宰门外，也有梆铃之声，门上也有封锁，却怎生是好？我这一番，若不为唐僧是个凡体，我三人不管怎的，也驾云弄风走了。只为唐僧未超三界外，见在五行中，一身都是父母浊骨，所以不得升驾难逃。”八戒道：“哥哥，不消商量，我们到那没梆铃不防卫处，撮着师父爬过墙去罢。”</p>

<p>行者笑道：“这个不好。此时无奈，撮他过去；到取经回来，你这呆子口敞，延地里就对人说，我们是爬墙头的和尚了。”八戒道：“此时也顾不得行检，且逃命去罢。”行者也没奈何，只得依他，到那净墙边，算计爬出。</p>

<p>噫！有这般事！也是三藏灾星未脱。那三个魔头，在宫中正睡，忽然惊觉。说走了唐僧，一个个披衣忙起，急登宝殿，问曰：“唐僧蒸了几滚了？”那些烧火的小妖已是有睡魔虫，都睡着了，就是打也莫想打得一个醒来。其余没执事的，惊醒几个，冒冒失失的答应道：“七……七……七……七滚了！”急跑近锅边，只见笼格子乱丢在地下，烧火的还都睡着，慌得又来报道：</p>

<p>“大王，走……走……走……走了！”三个魔头都下殿，近锅前仔细看时，果见那笼格子乱丢在地下，汤锅尽冷，火脚俱无，那烧火的俱呼呼鼾睡如泥。慌得众怪一齐呐喊，都叫：“快拿唐僧！快拿唐僧！”这一片喊声振起，把些前前后后、大大小小妖精，都惊起来。刀枪簇拥，至正阳门下，见那封锁不动，梆铃不绝，问外边巡夜的道：“唐僧从那里走了？”俱道：“不曾走出人来。”急赶至后宰门，封锁梆铃，一如前门。复乱抢抢的，灯笼火把，焙天通红，就如白日，却明明的照见他四众爬墙哩！老魔赶近，喝声：“那里走！”那长老唬得脚软筋麻，跌下墙来，被老魔拿住。二魔捉了沙僧，三魔擒倒八戒，众妖抢了行李白马，只是走了行者。那八戒口里口国口国哝哝的报怨行者道：“天杀的”我说要救便脱根救，如今却又复笼蒸了！”众魔把唐僧擒至殿上，却不蒸了。二怪吩咐把八戒绑在殿前檐柱上，三怪吩咐把沙僧绑在殿后檐柱上，惟老魔把唐僧抱住不放。三怪道：“大哥，你抱住他怎的？终不然就活吃？却也没些趣味。此物比不得那愚夫俗子，拿了可以当饭。此是上邦稀奇之物，必须待天阴闲暇之时，拿他出来，整制精洁，猜枚行令，细吹细打的吃方可。”</p>

<p>老魔笑道：“贤弟之言虽当，但孙行者又要来偷哩。”三魔道：</p>

<p>“我这皇宫里面有一座锦香亭子，亭子内有一个铁柜。依着我，把唐僧藏在柜里，关了亭子，却传出谣言，说唐僧已被我们夹生吃了。令小妖满城讲说，那行者必然来探听消息，若听见这话，他必死心塌地而去。待三五日不来搅扰，却拿出来，慢慢受用，如何？”老怪二怪俱大喜道：“是，是，是！兄弟说得有理！”可怜把个唐僧连夜拿将进去，藏在柜中，闭了亭子。传出谣言，满城里都乱讲不题。</p>

<p>却说行者自夜半顾不得唐僧，驾云走脱，径至狮驼洞里，一路棍，把那万数小妖，尽情剿绝。急回来，东方日出，到城边，不敢叫战，正是单丝不线，孤掌难鸣。他落下云头，摇身一变，变作个小妖儿，演入门里，大街小巷，缉访消息。满城里俱道：</p>

<p>“唐僧被大王夹生儿连夜吃了。”前前后后，都是这等说。行者着实心焦，行至金銮殿前观看，那里边有许多精灵，都戴着皮金帽子，穿着黄布直身，手拿着红漆棍，腰挂象牙牌，一往一来，不住的乱走。行者暗想道：“此必是穿宫的妖怪。就变做这个模样，进去打听打听。”好大圣，果然变得一般无二，混入金门。正走处，只见八戒绑在殿前柱上哼哩。行者近前叫声“悟能。”那呆子认得声音，道：“师兄，你来了？救我一救！”行者道：</p>

<p>“我救你，你可知师父在那里？”八戒道：“师父没了，昨夜被妖精夹生儿吃了。”行者闻言，忽失声泪似泉涌。八戒道：“哥哥莫哭，我也是听得小妖乱讲，未曾眼见。你休误了，再去寻问寻问。”这行者却才收泪，又往里面找寻。忽见沙僧绑在后檐柱上，即近前摸着他胸脯子叫道：“悟净。”沙僧也识得声音，道：</p>

<p>“师兄，你变化进来了？救我！救我！”行者道：“救你容易，你可知师父在那里？”沙僧滴泪道：“哥啊！师父被妖精等不得蒸，就夹生儿吃了！”大圣听得两个言语相同，心如刀搅，泪似水流，急纵身望空跳起，且不救八戒沙僧，回至城东山上，按落云头，放声大哭，叫道：“师父啊！恨我欺天困网罗，师来救我脱沉疴。</p>

<p>潜心笃志同参佛，努力修身共炼魔。岂料今朝遭蜇害，不能保你上婆娑。西方胜境无缘到，气散魂消怎奈何！”行者凄凄惨惨的，自思自忖，以心问心道：“这都是我佛如来坐在那极乐之境，没得事干，弄了那三藏之经！若果有心劝善，理当送上东土，却不是个万古流传？只是舍不得送去，却教我等来取。怎知道苦历千山，今朝到此丧命！罢！罢！罢！老孙且驾个筋斗云，去见如来，备言前事。若肯把经与我送上东土，一则传扬善果，二则了我等心愿；若不肯与我，教他把松箍儿咒念念，退下这个箍子，交还与他，老孙还归本洞，称王道寡，耍子儿去罢。”</p>

<p>好大圣，急翻身驾起筋斗云，径投天竺。那里消一个时辰，早望见灵山不远。须臾间，按落云头，直至鹫峰之下，忽抬头，见四大金刚挡住道：“那里走？”行者施礼道：“有事要见如来。”</p>

<p>当头又有昆仑山金霞岭不坏尊王永住金刚喝道：“这泼猴甚是粗狂！前者大困牛魔，我等为汝努力，今日面见，全不为礼！有事且待先奏，奉召方行。这里比南天门不同，教你进去出来，两边乱走！咄！还不靠开！”那大圣正是烦恼处，又遭此抢白，气得哮吼如雷，忍不住大呼小叫，早惊动如来。如来佛祖正端坐在九品宝莲台上，与十八尊轮世的阿罗汉讲经，即开口道：“孙悟空来了，汝等出去接待接待。”大众阿罗，遵佛旨，两路幢幡宝盖，即出山门应声道：“孙大圣，如来有旨相唤哩。”那山门口四大金刚却才闪开路，让行者前进。众阿罗引至宝莲台下，见如来倒身下拜，两泪悲啼。如来道：“悟空，有何事这等悲啼？”</p>

<p>行者道：“弟子屡蒙教训之恩，托庇在佛爷爷之门下，自归正果，保护唐僧，拜为师范，一路上苦不可言！今至狮驼山狮驼洞狮驼城，有三个毒魔，乃狮王、象王、大鹏，把我师父捉将去，连弟子一概遭迍，都捆在蒸笼里，受汤火之灾。幸弟子脱逃，唤龙王救免。是夜偷出师等，不料灾星难脱，复又擒回。及至天明，入城打听，叵耐那魔十分狠毒，万样骁勇，把师父连夜夹生吃了，如今骨肉无存。又况师弟悟能悟净见绑在那厢，不久，性命亦皆倾矣。弟子没及奈何，特地到此参拜如来。望大慈悲，将松箍咒儿念念，退下我这头上箍儿，交还如来，放我弟子回花果山宽闲耍子去罢！”说未了，泪如泉涌，悲声不绝。如来笑道：</p>

<p>“悟空少得烦恼。那妖精神通广大，你胜不得他，所以这等心痛。”行者跪在下面，捶着胸膛道：“不瞒如来说，弟子当年闹天宫，称大圣，自为人以来，不曾吃亏，今番却遭这毒魔之手！”如来闻言道：“你且休恨，那妖精我认得他。”行者猛然失声道：</p>

<p>“如来！我听见人讲说，那妖精与你有亲哩。”如来道：“这个刁猢狲！怎么个妖精与我有亲？”行者笑道：“不与你有亲，如何认得？”如来道：“我慧眼观之，故此认得。那老怪与二怪有主。”叫阿傩迦叶来：“你两个分头驾云，去五台山、峨眉山宣文殊、普贤来见。”二尊者即奉旨而去。如来道：“这是老魔、二怪之主。</p>

<p>但那三怪，说将起来，也是与我有些亲处。”行者道：“亲是父党？母党？”如来道：“自那混沌分时，天开于子，地辟于丑，人生于寅，天地再交合，万物尽皆生。万物有走兽飞禽，走兽以麒麟为之长，飞禽以凤凰为之长。那凤凰又得交合之气，育生孔雀、大鹏。孔雀出世之时最恶，能吃人，四十五里路把人一口吸之。</p>

<p>我在雪山顶上，修成丈六金身，早被他也把我吸下肚去。我欲从他便门而出，恐污真身，是我剖开他脊背，跨上灵山。欲伤他命，当被诸佛劝解，伤孔雀如伤我母，故此留他在灵山会上，封他做佛母孔雀大明王菩萨。大鹏与他是一母所生，故此有些亲处。”行者闻言笑道：“如来，若这般比论，你还是妖精的外甥哩。”如来道：“那怪须是我去，方可收得。”行者叩头，启上如来：“千万望玉趾一降！”</p>

<p>如来即下莲台，同诸佛众，径出山门，又见阿傩、迦叶引文殊、普贤来见。二菩萨对佛礼拜，如来道：“菩萨之兽，下山多少时了？”文殊道：“七日了。”如来道：“山中方七日，世上几千年。</p>

<p>不知在那厢伤了多少生灵，快随我收他去。”二菩萨相随左右，同众飞空。只见那：满天缥缈瑞云分，我佛慈悲降法门。明示开天生物理，细言辟地化身文。面前五百阿罗汉，脑后三千揭谛神。迦叶阿傩随左右，普文菩萨殄妖氛。大圣有此人情，请得佛祖与众前来，不多时，早望见城池。行者报道：“如来，那放黑气的乃是狮驼国也。”如来道：“你先下去，到那城中与妖精交战，许败不许胜。败上来，我自收他。”大圣即按云头，径至城上，脚踏着垛儿骂道：“泼孽畜！快出来与老孙交战！”慌得那城楼上小妖急跳下城中报道：“大王，孙行者在城上叫战哩。”老妖道：“这猴儿两三日不来，今朝却又叫战，莫不是请了些救兵来耶？”三怪道：“怕他怎的！我们都去看来。”三个魔头各持兵器赶上城来，见了行者更不打话，举兵器一齐乱刺，行者轮铁棒掣手相迎。斗经七八回合，行者佯输而走。那妖王喊声大振，叫道：“那里走！”大圣筋斗一纵，跳上半空，三个精即驾云来赶。行者将身一闪，藏在佛爷爷金光影里，全然不见。只见那过去、未来、见在的三尊佛像与五百阿罗汉、三千揭谛神，布散左右，把那三个妖王围住，水泄不通。老魔慌了手脚，叫道：“兄弟，不好了！那猴子真是个地里鬼！那里请得个主人公来也！”</p>

<p>三魔道：“大哥休得悚惧，我们一齐上前，使枪刀搠倒如来，夺他那雷音宝刹！”这魔头不识起倒，真个举刀上前乱砍，却被文殊、普贤，念动真言喝道：“这孽畜还不皈正，更待怎生！”唬得老怪、二怪，不敢撑持，丢了兵器，打个滚，现了本相。二菩萨将莲花台抛在那怪的脊背上，飞身跨坐，二怪遂泯耳皈依。</p>

<p>二菩萨既收了青狮、白象，只有那第三个妖魔不伏，腾开翅，丢了方天戟，扶摇直上，轮利爪要刁捉猴王。原来大圣藏在光中，他怎敢近？如来情知此意，即闪金光，把那鹊巢贯顶之头，迎风一幌，变做鲜红的一块血肉。妖精轮利爪刁他一下，被佛爷把手往上一指，那妖翅膊上鞦了筋。飞不去，只在佛顶上，不能远遁，现了本相，乃是一个大鹏金翅雕，即开口对佛应声叫道：“如来，你怎么使大法力困住我也？”如来道：“你在此处多生孽障，跟我去，有进益之功。”妖精道：“你那里持斋把素，极贫极苦；我这里吃人肉，受用无穷！你若饿坏了我，你有罪愆。”如来道：“我管四大部洲，无数众生瞻仰，凡做好事，我教他先祭汝口。”那大鹏欲脱难脱，要走怎走？是以没奈何，只得皈依。行者方才转出，向如来叩头道：“佛爷，你今收了妖精，除了大害，只是没了我师父也。”大鹏咬着牙恨道：“泼猴头！寻这等狠人困我！你那老和尚几曾吃他？如今在那锦香亭铁柜里不是？”行者闻言，忙叩头谢了佛祖。佛祖不敢松放了大鹏，也只教他在光焰上做个护法，引众回云，径归宝刹。</p>

<p>行者却按落云头，直入城里。那城里一个小妖儿也没有了，正是蛇无头而不行，鸟无翅而不飞。他见佛祖收了妖王，各自逃生而去。行者才解救了八戒、沙僧，寻着行李马匹，与他二人说：“师父不曾吃，都跟我来。”引他两个径入内院，找着锦香亭，打开门看，内有一个铁柜，只听得三藏有啼哭之声。沙僧使降妖杖打开铁锁，揭开柜盖，叫声：“师父！”三藏见了，放声大哭道：“徒弟啊！怎生降得妖魔？如何得到此寻着我也？”行者把上项事，从头至尾，细陈了一遍，三藏感谢不尽。师徒们在那宫殿里寻了些米粮，安排些茶饭，饱吃一餐，收拾出城，找大路投西而去。正是：真经必得真人取，意嚷心劳总是虚。毕竟这一去，不知几时得面如来，且听下回分解。</p>
