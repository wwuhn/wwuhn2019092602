<P>Evil in the Heart's Centre Crosses</P>
<P>the Backbone Pass</P>
</div>
<P>There is a poem that goes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>They travel West escaping dangers to seek the scriptures;</P>
<P>Nor can they stop at all the famous mountains.</P>
<P>They press on night and day, starting crows and hares;</P>
<P>The seasons turn amid falling blossom and bird-song.</P>
<P>In the dust under one's eyes are three thousand worlds;</P>
<P>Four hundred prefectures rest on the head of a staff.</P>
<P>Sleeping in dew and dining on wind they climb the purple slope;</P>
<P>Never knowing when they will be able to start back.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story tells how after the dragon prince had subdued the demon and the God of the Black River had divided the waters, master and disciples crossed the Black River and took the main trail West. They faced wind and snow, and traveled under the moon and the stars. After they had been going for a long time it was early spring again.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The sun returns;</P>
<P>All comes back to life.</P>
<P>The sun returns;</P>
<P>Beauty fills the sky like an opened scroll.</P>
<P>All comes hack to life,</P>
<P>As flowers cover the earth with embroidered cushions.</P>
<P>A few snowflakes of plum blossom remain,</P>
<P>While the wheat spreads like a sea of cloud.</P>

<P>In the gentle thaw the mountain spring now flows,</P>

<P>The new shoots grow and cover the burnt-out stubble.</P>
<P>Tai Hao governs the East,</P>
<P>The Wood God rules the dawn.</P>
<P>Above the fragrance and the warming breeze</P>
<P>The clouds disperse and the sun shines anew.</P>
<P>Willows spread their green beside the path,</P>
<P>Enriching rain brings spring to all that lives.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Master and disciples were ambling along enjoying the view when all of a sudden they heard a mighty shout like a war-cry from a thousand throats. Sanzang was terrified. He reined in his horse, unable to take another step forward. &#8220;Wukong,&#8221; he said, looking back at him, &#8220;where is that noise from?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It sounded like an earthquake or a landslide,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;Or thunder,&#8221; said Friar Sand.</P>
<P>&#8220;Or people shouting and horses neighing,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;You're all wrong,&#8221; laughed Monkey. &#8220;Just wait a moment while I go and take a look.&#8221;</P>
<P>Splendid Monkey. With one bound he was on a cloud and up in the air looking all around. In the distance he could make out a walled city, and when he went close he could see that it had a haze of auspicious light over it with no sign of any evil emanations. &#8220;It's a good place,&#8221; he sighed to himself, &#8220;but why was there that terrible noise? I can't see war banners or spears there, and there's no sound of cannon. So why was there a noise like shouting and neighing?&#8221;</P>
<P>Just as he was debating all this with himself he noticed a big crowd of Buddhist monks on a sandbank outside the city gates, pulling a cart. The noise that had startle Sanzang was them all shouting. &#8220;King Powerful Bodhisattva.&#8221;</P>
<P>When he slowly lowered his cloud for a better look he saw that the cart was loaded with kiln bricks, tiles, wood and adobe bricks. Above the sandbank was a high ridge, along the top of which ran a narrow track between two great gates. Below the gates the paths all went straight down the steep sides of the ridge: the cart could not possibly be pulled up there. Although the weather was so mild and pleasant the monks were all dressed in rags and looked thoroughly poverty-stricken.</P>
<P>&#8220;I suppose they must be building a monastery,&#8221; thought Monkey, &#8220;and are having to do the work themselves because it's harvest-time here and they can't hire any labor.&#8221; He was still not sure when he saw two young Taoist priests come swaggering out through the city gates. Just see how they were dressed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Star crowns on their heads,</P>
<P>Brocade and embroidered clothes.</P>
<P>The star crowns on their heads shine bright,</P>
<P>The brocade and embroidered clothes float like sunset clouds.</P>
<P>On their feet are cloud-treading shoes,</P>
<P>Round their waists are silken belts.</P>
<P>Handsome and clever faces, round as the moon;</P>
<P>Bodies as elegant as the immortals in Heaven.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The approach of the Taoists made the Buddhist monks all shake with fear as they redoubled their efforts and pulled harder than ever at the cart.</P>
<P>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; thought Monkey as he realized what was up. &#8220;The monks must be scared of the Taoists. Why else would they be pulling so hard? I've heard people tell of a place on the way to the West where they believe in Taoism and persecute Buddhist monks. This must be it. I was going to report back to the master, but he'll be angry with me if I don't discover what it's all about. He'll say that a clever chap like me ought to be able to find out the truth. I'll go down and ask what's happening so I can tell the master.&#8221;</P>
<P>But whom was he to ask? The splendid Great Sage shook himself and turned into the likeness of a wandering Quanzhen Taoist with a food basket over his left arm as he beat on a bamboo drum and sang Taoist songs. Monkey walked towards the city gates and bowed in greeting to the two Taoists, saying, &#8220;Humble greetings, elders in the Way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you from, sir?&#8221; the Taoists asked, returning his greeting.</P>
<P>&#8220;I wander and roam from the corners of the sea to the edge of the sky,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;I am here today to beg from some pious household. Could you two elders tell me which streets and which alleys in this city love the Way and its followers? I would like to beg for some food.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a depressing way to talk, sir,&#8221; said one of the Taoist priests with a laugh.</P>
<P>&#8220;What's so depressing about it?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Isn't it depressing that you want to beg for food?&#8221; asked the priest.</P>
<P>&#8220;But we men of religion have to live by begging,&#8221; said Brother Monkey. If we don't, we can't buy our food.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Taoist priest laughed again and replied, &#8220;You're a stranger here and you don't know about our city. Here it's not just the civil and military officials, the rich and the elderly who love the Way and its followers. Young and old, men and women alike, everyone offers us food when they see us. But all that is hardly worth mentioning. By far the most important thing is that His Majesty the king is a devout lover of the Way and its followers.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm young,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;and I'm a stranger from far away. I didn't know that. Could I trouble you two elders to do a fellow-believer a favour? Tell me more about what this place is called and how the king shows his love for the Way and its worthies.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This country is called Tarrycart,&#8221; the Taoist priest replied, &#8220;and His Majesty is close to us.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he said with a chuckle, &#8220;Can it be that a Taoist priest is monarch?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;For twenty years there was a drought here, and not a drop of rain fell. Nothing could grow. Everyone&#8212;king, ministers, commoners, the high and the humble&#8212;all bathed, burnt incense and prayed to Heaven for rain. When they were in really desperate straits three immortals were sent from Heaven to save all living beings.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Which three?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Our masters,&#8221; the Taoist priest replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;May I ask their titles?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;Our senior master is the Great Immortal Tiger Power,&#8221; the Taoist replied, &#8220;our second master is the Great Immortal Deer Power, and the third master is the Great Immortal Antelope Power.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What sort of magic can your three masters perform?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;They can summon up wind and rain with a flick of the hand,&#8221; the Taoist said, &#8220;and change water into oil or stone into gold as easily as turning around. Their magic arts enable them to control the creation of heaven and earth, or to alter the positions of the stars. Our king and his ministers treat them with great respect and they are now relations of ours.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your king is very fortunate,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;As the saying goes, magic moves ruler and minister alike. If your masters have those powers and the king treats them as his relations they must have been very good to him. Oh dear! I don't suppose that a poor Taoist like myself is fated to meet your venerable masters.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No, problem about meeting them,&#8221; said the Taoist. &#8220;We two are his favorite disciples. Besides, our masters are such lovers of the Way and its followers that they only need to hear the word 'Way' to come right outside to welcome a visitor. For us to take you in there would be as easy as blowing away ashes.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey chanted a deep and respectful &#8220;re-e-er&#8221; and then said, &#8220;I would be very grateful for an introduction. Let's go in.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wait a moment,&#8221; said the Taoist. &#8220;You sit here while we finish the jobs we have to do, then we'll go in together.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Priests ought to be completely free and unconstrained,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;What jobs do you have to do?&#8221;</P>
<P>The Taoist pointed toward the Buddhist monks on the sandbank and said, &#8220;They're working for us, and we have to call the roll to make sure they don't start slacking.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You elders have got it wrong,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile. &#8220;We Buddhist and Taoist monks are all men of religion. They shouldn't be working for us and answering roll-calls.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You wouldn't know that when we were all praying for ram the year the Buddhists were on one side praying to Buddha while we were on the other side praying to the Great Bear. We both asked the court for grain, but the Buddhists turned out to be useless. They got no results by reciting their sutras and didn't help in the least. It was our masters who came along, called up wind and rain, and saved the people from their distress. The king was so angry with those useless Buddhists that he had their monasteries torn down and their Buddha-statues smashed. He revoked their ordination licenses and refused to let them go home. Instead he gave them to us to work for us as slaves. They do all our cooking and cleaning and they look after our gates. Because our residence out here hasn't been finished yet we've made the Buddhists drag the bricks, tiles and timber here to do the building for us. We two have been sent here to keep an eye on them and make sure they don't start slacking.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he held on to them and said through his tears, &#8220;I said I wasn't fated to meet your masters and I was right.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why won't you meet them?&#8221; the Taoist asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I have come here on my wanderings for two reasons,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;One is to make a living, and the other is to find a relation.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What relation?&#8221; the Taoist asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I have an uncle,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;who left home to have his head shaved and become a Buddhist monk when he was very young. During a famine years ago he went away to beg. He hasn't been back since, and I'm looking for him out of a sense of duty to our forebears. I expect he's been detained here and can't escape, but there's no way of knowing. If I could just have a look for him and see him I'd be able to go into town with you after that.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No problem,&#8221; said the Taoist. &#8220;We'll sit here while you go down to the sand and check them over for us. Just make sure there are five hundred of them. See if your uncle is among them. If he is, we'll release him as you're a fellow Taoist. Then we can go into town together.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey was very grateful indeed. He bowed to them with his hands raised and headed straight for the sandbank, playing his bamboo drum. Once he was through the two sets of gates and had gone down the ridge the monks all knelt and kowtowed to him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; one of the monks said, &#8220;we're not slacking. Every one of the five hundred of us is here and all pulling that cart.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this Monkey smiled to himself and thought with a grin he did not show, &#8220;Those Taoists have got them so scared that they're even frightened of an imitation Taoist like me. If I were a real Taoist they'd die of fright.&#8221;</P>
<P>Then Monkey said aloud with a wave of his hands, &#8220;Don't kneel, and don't be afraid. I'm not the supervisor. I'm here to look for a relation.&#8221; Once they heard him talk about looking for a relation, the monks all crowded round, craning forward, coughing and making other noises in their eagerness to be picked out.</P>
<P>&#8220;Who's his relation?&#8221; they all wondered. Monkey looked them all over for a while then started chuckling aloud.</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; the monk said, &#8220;if you can't find your relation among us, what is there to laugh about?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do you know why I'm laughing?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;It's because all you monks are failures. You were born under unlucky stars. Your parents were only prepared to let you become monks because you brought them bad luck or because you were destined to have no sisters. Why ever are you working for Taoists like slaves instead of honoring the Three Treasures, respecting the Buddha's Dharma, reading sutras and performing ceremonies of repentance?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You put us to shame, my lord,&#8221; the monk replied. &#8220;You must be a stranger here, sir, who doesn't understand the situation.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Indeed I am,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and indeed I don't.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Our king,&#8221; said the Buddhist monk in tears, &#8220;is prejudiced and unreasonable. He only likes the followers of Lao Zi, and he hates us Buddhists.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Because three immortals came here to call up wind and rain,&#8221; the monk replied. &#8220;They ruined everything for us and won the king's confidence. He has destroyed our monasteries, revoked our ordination licenses, and refused to let us return to our homes. And the form of forced labor he imposed on us was to give us to the immortals to work for them. It's unbearably hard. When you come here, wandering Taoist, you will only have to call on the king to be richly rewarded. But any Buddhist monk who comes, whether from around here or from far away, is arrested and put to work for the immortals.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I suppose the Taoists must use some magic powers to worm their way into the king's confidence,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Calling up winds and rain is small-time magic used by unorthodox sects, and hardly enough to win a king's heart.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They can refine mercury from cinnabar, sit in meditation, turn water into oil, and change stones into gold,&#8221; the monk replied. &#8220;They have now built a Temple of the Three Pure Ones where they read scriptures and perform ceremonies to heaven and earth night and day to obtain eternal life for His Majesty. That is why the king's heart has been moved.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So it's like that, is it?&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;You may all go now.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But, my lord, we can't get away,&#8221; the monk replied. &#8220;The immortals persuaded the king to have pictures of monks painted, and these have been sent to be displayed in every ward and by every river. Tarrycart is a big country, but in every city, prefecture, county town, village, hamlet, inn and market-place there hangs a picture of Buddhist monks with this notice on it in the king's own handwriting:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Any official who captures a monk will be promoted three grades. Any commoner not holding office who captures a monk will receive a reward of fifty ounces of silver.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>That's why we can't escape. It's not just us Buddhist monks. Anyone who's had a short haircut or who's bald or whose hair is thinning finds it hard not to get arrested. Agents and policemen are everywhere. There's no way we can possibly escape. We have no choice: we can only suffer here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case you'd all better die,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; said the Buddhist monk, &#8220;many of us have already. There were over two thousand of us altogether, both us local monks and those arrested from elsewhere. Six or seven hundred of us have died and about the same number have killed themselves because they could not bear the pain, the searing heat, the bitter cold, or the local conditions. We five hundred are the only survivors.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How have you managed to stay alive?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The rope broke when we tried to hang ourselves, or it did not even hurt when we tried to slit our own throats, or we floated and did not drown when we jumped into the river, or the poison we took didn't harm us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're all very lucky then,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Heaven has given each of you perpetual life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; said the monk, &#8220;you've left one word out. It's a perpetual life sentence. For our three meals every day all we get is a thin gruel of brown rice. At night we have to sleep on the sandbank in the open. Luckily spirits come to protect us when we close our eyes.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I expect you see ghosts because you're so exhausted,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the Buddhist monk. &#8220;They're the Six Dings, the Six Jias, and the Guardians of the Faith. But they can only protect us at night, except when they come to save the life of any of us who is on the point of death.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's very wrong of the spirits,&#8221; said Brother Monkey. &#8220;They shouldn't be protecting you like that. They should let you die and be reborn in the Western Heaven as soon as possible.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They come to us in our dreams,&#8221; said the monk, &#8220;and give us advice like, 'Don't try to die. Hole out till a holy priest comes from the East, and arhat who will go to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures. He has a disciple of immense magical powers, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven. He has a good and loyal heart, he rights wrongs, he saves those in distress and he helps widows and orphans. Wait till he shows his divine powers, wipes out the Taoist priests, and restores our Dhyana faith to its proper respect.'&#8221;</P>
<P>This pleased Monkey, though he did not show it as he thought,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Whoever said that Monkey had no powers to his name?</P>
<P>Before I even got here gods and spirits spread my fame.&#8221;</P>
<P>He then hurried off, taking his leave of the monks and beating his bamboo drum as he headed for the city gates to see the Taoist priests again. &#8220;Which of them is your respected uncle?&#8221; they asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;All five hundred of them are my relations,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you possibly have so many?&#8221; they asked again.</P>
<P>&#8220;A hundred were my neighbors who lived to the left of us,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and another hundred lived to the right. A hundred are my father's kin, and a hundred are related to my mother. The last hundred are my own friends and acquaintances. If you are willing to release them all, I'll go into the city with you; but if you won't, I won't.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You must be off your head, talking such nonsense,&#8221; the Taoist priests replied. &#8220;All those Buddhist monks were presented to us by His Majesty. Even if we released just one or two of them we'd have to cover up by handing in sick notes for them to our masters then filling out death certificates. We couldn't possibly release the whole lot of them. It would be outrageous, quite outrageous. We'd have no servants and the king would be very angry with us. The ward head is always sending officials to check up, and sometimes the king even comes to count them himself. We couldn't possibly let them go.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You couldn't?&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; the priests replied. By the time he had asked this and been given the same answer three times he was in a terrible rage. He produced his iron cudgel from his ear, created a spell with his hands, made it as thick as a rice bowl, swung it, and brought it down on the Taoists' faces. The poor Taoists</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Fell to the ground with their blood gushing out and their heads split open,</P>
<P>Wounds that were gaping wide, brains scattered everywhere, both necks broken.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the Buddhist monks faraway on the strand saw Monkey kill the two Taoists they abandoned their cart and came running over saying, &#8220;This is awful, this is awful. You've killed the king's relations.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Who are the king's relations?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>The monks fenced him in with their earth-moving baskets and said, &#8220;Their masters don't have to greet the king when they enter the throne hall or take leave of him when they go. The king addresses them as 'Elder Brother Teacher'. Why did you have to come here to get us into this terrible trouble. It was nothing to do with you that their disciples came to supervise the work. What's to become of us now that they've been killed? We'll have to take you into town to report their deaths.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do stop that yelling, gentlemen,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile. &#8220;I'm not really a wandering Quanzhen Taoist. I'm here to rescue you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But by killing them you've only made things worse for us,&#8221; they said. &#8220;How can you say you're here to rescue us?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm Sun Wukong the Novice,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;the disciple of the holy priest from the Great Tang, and I've come here specially to save you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No, you're not,&#8221; the monk said. &#8220;We know what that great lord looks like.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But how could you?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;You've never met him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We've seen an old man in a dream who told us he was the Great White Planet. He told us what Sun the Novice, or Monkey, looks like so that we wouldn't confuse him with anyone else.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How did the Planet describe him to you?&#8221; Monkey asked him.</P>
<P>To this the Buddhist monk replied, &#8220;He told us that the Great Sage has</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A brow that seems split open, two flashing of eyes of gold,</P>
<P>A head that's round, a hairy face, and sunken cheeks, we're told.</P>
<P>Out of a pointed muzzle sharp little teeth protrude;</P>
<P>He looks much like a thunder god, and his Conduct's very crude.</P>
<P>He wields a cudgel of iron with ends banded in gold</P>
<P>With which he smashed the Heavenly gates as a rebel in times of old.</P>
<P>Now he has seen the light of the faith he's escorting his master,</P>
<P>And saves whoever he can from death and disaster.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey was both angry and pleased to hear this. He was pleased that his fame had been spread, but thought angrily, &#8220;That old rascal, telling these ordinary mortals what I really look like.&#8221;</P>
<P>Then he found himself speaking aloud and saying, &#8220;Gentlemen, you're quite right that I'm not Sun the Novice. I'm only a servant of his who's come here to fool around and practice making trouble. But Sun the Novice is coming&#8212;look over there!&#8221; He pointed East, tricking all the monks into turning away while he resumed his true appearance.</P>
<P>Only then did they realize who he really was, and fell to the ground to kowtow and say, &#8220;My lord, because we have only mortal eyes we failed to recognize you in your disguise. We beg you to go into the city, subdue evil, and save and avenge us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Come with me then,&#8221; said Monkey, and the monks followed him closely.</P>
<P>The Great Sage went straight to the sandbank and used magic to make the cart go through the two gates and along the ridge then lift itself right up and smash itself to smithereens. The bricks, tiles and timber all went tumbling down the slope. &#8220;Scatter,&#8221; he told the monks, &#8220;and keep away from me until I've seen the king and wiped out those Taoists tomorrow.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But, my lord,&#8221; the Buddhist monk said, &#8220;we dare not go far. We're frightened of being arrested by officials and brought back here to be flogged and punished in other ways. It would only make things worse for us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case I'll give you some magical protection,&#8221; said Monkey. The splendid Great Sage then pulled out a handful of hairs and chewed them into little pieces, one of which he gave to each of the monks. &#8220;Keep it inside the nail of your third finger, bunch you fingers together, and just keep walking,&#8221; he told them. &#8220;Nothing will happen unless somebody tries to arrest you. If anyone does, clench your fist and shout, 'Great Sage Equaling Heaven.' Then I'll come and protect you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But, my lord,&#8221; the monk said, &#8220;what if you're far away and out of sight? What if you don't come when we call? Whatever shall we do?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry yourselves,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'll keep you completely safe even if I'm thousands of miles away.&#8221;</P>
<P>One of the bolder spirits among the monks clenched his fist and said &#8220;Great Sage Equaling Heaven&#8221; under his breath. A figure like a thunder god holding an iron cudgel appeared before him, so terrifying that not even a huge army would not have dared to approach him. Then over a hundred of the monks called out, and over a hundred Great Sages appeared to protect them.</P>
<P>&#8220;Truly a miracle, my lord,&#8221; the monks all said, kowtowing.</P>
<P>Monkey then told them to say &#8220;Quiet&#8221; for their protectors to disappear again. They then all said &#8220;Quiet,&#8221; and the pieces of hair were once more tucked behind their fingernails. Only then were the monks all happy to disperse and make their escapes.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't go too far,&#8221; said Brother Monkey, &#8220;and keep your ears open for news of me. If a notice is issued recalling Buddhist monks, come to the city and return my hair.&#8221; The five hundred monks then scattered in all directions; some went away and some stayed where they were.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story switches back to Sanzang, who gave up waiting beside the track for Monkey to report back and told Pig to lead the horse Westward. They met monks hurrying away, and when they were close to the city wall they found Monkey with a dozen or so monks who had not yet gone. &#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said Sanzang, reining in his horse, &#8220;why did it take you so long to get back from investigating that noise?&#8221; Monkey led the dozen or so monks in performing obeisances before Sanzang's horse and then told him everything that happened. Sanzang was horrified: &#8220;What are we to do if that's the way it is?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please don't worry, my lord,&#8221; said the dozen or so monks. &#8220;His Honour the Great Sage Monkey is a god down from Heaven whose divine powers are tremendous. He will most certainly be able to protect you. We are monks from the Deep Wisdom Monastery, a royal foundation in the city. Because our monastery was founded by the great-grandfather of the present king and there is a statue of him there, the monastery has not been demolished, although all the others in the city, big and small alike, have been torn down. We would like to invite you to come straight into town to stay in our humble monastery. The Great Sage Monkey is bound to find some way of coping at court tomorrow morning.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Very well then, let us go into the city without further delay.&#8221;</P>
<P>The venerable elder then dismounted and went on foot to the city gate. The sun was setting in the West as they crossed the drawbridge and went in through the triple gates. People in the streets turned away when they saw the monks of the Deep Wisdom Monastery leading a horse and carrying luggage. When they reached the monastery gates the travelers saw a large sign over them reading DEEP WISDOM MONASTERY: FOUNDED BY ROYAL COMMAND.</P>
<P>The monks pushed the gates open and led them through the Hall of the Vajrapanis before opening the doors of the main hall of the monastery. Sanzang covered himself with his cassock and worshipped the Buddha before entering.</P>
<P>&#8220;Steward!&#8221; the monks called, and an old monk came out who kowtowed to Monkey the moment he saw him.</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord, are you really here?&#8221; he said.</P>
<P>&#8220;Do you know which lord I am, bowing like that?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I can see that you are Lord Sun, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven,&#8221; the old monk replied. &#8220;We see you in our dreams every night; the Great White Planet is always coming in them to tell us that we will only be saved when you arrive. Now that I have beheld your distinguished countenance I know that it is the same as in our dreams. I am glad you are here so soon, my lord. Had you been a day or two later we would all have become ghosts by then.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please get up,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Things will be sorted out tomorrow.&#8221; The monks then laid on a vegetarian meal for the master and his disciples and tidied up the abbot's lodgings for them to stay in. They settled down for the night.</P>
<P>A little before midnight Monkey, who had too much on his mind to go to sleep, heard music outside, got up quietly, dressed, and sprang into the air to look around. To the South he saw lamps and candles burning bright, and when he brought his cloud lower for a close look he saw that in the Temple of the Three Pure Ones the Taoists were performing a star ritual. What he saw was</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The high hall of the sanctum,</P>
<P>The true holy shrine.</P>
<P>The high hall of the sanctum</P>
<P>Was as majestic as Penghu's magic isle;</P>
<P>The true holy shrine</P>
<P>Was mysteriously pure like the Huale Temple.</P>
<P>On either side the Taoist priests played pan-pipes</P>
<P>While the celebrant in the center held a tablet of jade.</P>
<P>They explained The Elimination of Disaster</P>
<P>And preached on The Way and its Power.</P>
<P>When the dust-raising dance was over the talismans were issued;</P>
<P>After making divine petition all lay down in respect.</P>
<P>When the water had been blessed and the spirits summoned,</P>
<P>The fluttering flames of the candles rose up to the sky.</P>
<P>When the Pole Star was located and the Dipper paced out,</P>
<P>Clouds of fragrant incense filled the void.</P>
<P>Fresh food was offered on the votive tables,</P>
<P>And a rich repast of meatless food laid out.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In front of the hall hung a pair of yellow brocade vertical scrolls on which were embroidered these words:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>May winds and rains come as they should;</P>
<P>We pray for the boundless power of the Heavenly Honoured Ones.</P>
<P>May rivers and seas be pure and peaceful;</P>
<P>We beg for many a year of life for His Majesty.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey saw three old Taoists wearing their religious robes; he took them to be the Great Immortals Tiger Power, Deer Power and Antelope Power. Standing below them to either side were a crowd of seven or eight hundred Taoists holding drums, bells, incense and divine petitions. Monkey was delighted.</P>
<P>&#8220;I had meant to go down and fool around with them by myself,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;but one strand of silk can't make a thread, and one hand can't clap. I think I'll go back and do Friar Sand and Pig a good turn by letting them join in the game with me.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey then landed his auspicious cloud and went straight into the abbot's lodgings, where he found Pig and Friar Sand sleeping top to toe. Monkey first called Friar Sand, who woke up and said, &#8220;Aren't you asleep yet, brother?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Get up,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;We're going to have a good feed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Whatever sort of good feed can I have in the middle of the night when my throat's dried out and my eyes are all bleary?&#8221; Friar Sand asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;There's the Temple of the Three Pure Ones in this city where the Taoist priests are holding a service,&#8221; Brother Monkey replied. &#8220;The Hall of the Three Pure Ones is full of offerings: steamed buns as big as a bucket, cakes that must weight fifty or sixty pounds apiece, any amount of rice, and fresh fruit too. Let's go and have some.&#8221;</P>
<P>The talk of all this good food was enough to wake Pig up. &#8220;Won't you take me too, brother?&#8221; he asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you want a feed,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;keep your voice down and don't wake the master. Come with me.&#8221;</P>
<P>The two of them dressed, slipped outside, and leapt up by cloud with Monkey. As soon as the idiot saw the lights he wanted to attack, but Monkey held him back and said, &#8220;Steady on. We'll go down when they've all gone.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But their recitations are only just warming up,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;They won't want to go.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll do some magic that will send them packing,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage said the words and made the hand movements of a spell, drew in a breath from the quarter of the wind, and blew a gale so terrible that as it tore into the Hall of the Three Pure Ones it knocked down all the vases, candlesticks, and offerings on the walls and put out all the lamps. The Taoists all shook with terror.</P>
<P>&#8220;You had better go, disciples,&#8221; said the Great Immortal Tiger Power. &#8220;This divine wind has blown out all the lamps and the incense, so you should all go back to bed. Get up early tomorrow morning and recite some more scriptures to make the numbers up.&#8221; The Taoists then did indeed all withdraw.</P>
<P>Monkey then led Pig and Friar Sand to land their clouds, and they charged straight into the Hall of the Three Pure Ones. The idiot grabbed some food, not caring whether it was cooked or raw, and was just about to eat it when Monkey raised his iron cudgel to hit him. Pig pulled back his hand and said, &#8220;You're going to hit me before I've even tasted anything.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't act so low,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;You must pay your respects and sit down before eating.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're shameless,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;You steal food and expect me to pay my respects too. What would I have had to do if we'd been properly invited?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do you know who the three Bodhisattvas sitting up there are?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;Can't you recognize the Three Pure Ones themselves?&#8221; asked Pig. &#8220;How could you possibly think they are Bodhisattvas?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What about those Three Pure Ones?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;Oh well,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;the one in the middle is the Original Celestial Pure One, the one on the left is the Precious Pure One, and the one on the right is the Supreme Lord Lao Zi.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We've got to make ourselves look like them before we can eat in safety,&#8221; said Monkey. The delicious smells of the offerings were making the idiot desperate with hunger, so he climbed on the pedestal of the statue and knocked Lord Lao Zi off it with one shove of his snout.</P>
<P>&#8220;You've sat here for long enough, old man,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It's my turn now.&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig turned himself into the Supreme Lord Lao Zi, Monkey turned himself into the Original Celestial Pure One, and Friar Sand into the Precious Pure One. When the statues had all been pushed over and the three of them were sitting up there Pig grabbed a big steamed bun.</P>
<P>&#8220;Not so fast,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;But brother,&#8221; protested Pig, &#8220;we've already made ourselves look like them. What are we waiting for?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;eating is much less important than not giving ourselves away. If one of the Taoists got up early to hit the bell or sweep the floor and tripped over a piece of one of the statues we've knocked over the news would be out. You'd better hide them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But where?&#8221; asked Pig. &#8220;I'm a stranger here and I don't know my way around.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When we came in,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;there was a little pair of double doors to the right with an awful stench coming out of them. It must be the place where the five kinds of grain prepare for reincarnation. Put them in there.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot really did have some brute strength. When he leapt down he put the three statues over his shoulders and carried them out. On kicking those doors open he found that it was in fact a big lavatory.</P>
<P>&#8220;That Protector of the Horses certainly knows how to talk,&#8221; he said with a laugh. &#8220;He even made up a fancy Taoist name for the shithouse&#8212;'the place where the five kinds of grain prepare for reincarnation.'&#8220; Before tipping in the three statues he was carrying he mumbled a prayer:</P>
<P>&#8220;Three Pure Ones, Three Pure Ones, hear my prayer. We have come here from afar to wipe out evil spirits. We wish to enjoy your offerings but there was nowhere we could sit. So we've had to borrow your pedestals for a while. You have been sitting there long enough, and now you can go into the cesspit. Normally you have no end of things to eat, and you are pure Taoists. But today you'll have to taste some filth and be stinking Heavenly Honoured Ones.&#8221;</P>
<P>His prayer said, he threw them in with a great splash that covered half his tunic with evil-smelling liquid. When he went hack into the hall Monkey asked him, &#8220;Did you hide them properly?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I hid them well enough,&#8221; the idiot replied, &#8220;but I splashed some of that filthy water on my clothes. I hope the stench doesn't make you feel sick.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; laughed Monkey, &#8220;come and eat now. But you'll have to clean up before we go outside.&#8221; The idiot turned himself back into Lord Lao Zi and the three of them sat down to eat their fill. First they ate the steamed bread, and then they went on to the assorted cold dishes, the rice, the pastries, the buns, the biscuits, the pancakes, the doughnuts, and the steamed pies. They ate whatever they felt like, not caring whether it was hot or cold. Now Monkey was not much of a one for cooked food, so he just ate some fruit to keep the other two company. They cleaned everything up like shooting stars chasing the moon or a wind sweeping the clouds away. When there was nothing else left to eat they did not go, but stayed there chatting and entertaining themselves while they digested the meal.</P>
<P>What a thing to have done! There was a young Taoist priest who had just gone to bed in his dormitory by the Eastern cloister when he suddenly got up. &#8220;I left my handbell in the hall,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;and if I lose it my master will be angry with me tomorrow.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You go to sleep,&#8221; he said to other priest who shared his bed, &#8220;while I go to look for it.&#8221; He was in such a hurry that he did not put his underclothes back on but just pulled on his tunic and went straight to the main hall to look for his bell. He groped all around till he found it and was about to turn and leave when to his consternation he heard the sound of breathing. As he fled in alarm he tripped on a lichee stone and crashed to the ground, smashing his bell to pieces with a tremendous clang. Pig could not help roaring with laughter at this, which terrified the young Taoist out of his wits.</P>
<P>He staggered to the abbots lodgings, knocked on the doors and said, &#8220;Masters, disaster.&#8221;</P>
<P>The three senior Taoist were not yet in bed, so they opened the doors and asked, &#8220;What disaster?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'd lost my bell,&#8221; said the young Taoist, shivering and shaking, &#8220;and was looking for it in the hall when I heard a loud laugh that all but scared me to death.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Fetch lanterns,&#8221; said the senior Taoists on hearing this, &#8220;and see what evil creature it is.&#8221; This order was passed on to the priests, young and old, in both cloisters, who all got up, lit lamps, and went to the main hall to look.</P>
<P>If you don't know what they found, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>法身元运逢车力</p>
<p>心正妖邪度脊关</p>
</div>
<p>诗曰：求经脱障向西游，无数名山不尽休。兔走乌飞催昼夜，鸟啼花落自春秋。微尘眼底三千界，锡杖头边四百州。宿水餐风登紫陌，未期何日是回头。话说唐三藏幸亏龙子降妖，黑水河神开路，师徒们过了黑水河，找大路一直西来。真个是迎风冒雪，戴月披星，行彀多时，又值早春天气，但见三阳转运，万物生辉。三阳转运，满天明媚开图画；万物生辉，遍地芳菲设绣茵。梅残数点雪，麦涨一川云。渐开冰解山泉溜，尽放萌芽没烧痕。正是那太昊乘震，勾芒御辰，花香风气暖，云淡日光新。道旁杨柳舒青眼，膏雨滋生万象春。师徒们在路上游观景色，缓马而行，忽听得一声吆喝，好便似千万人呐喊之声。唐三藏心中害怕，兜住马不能前进，急回头道：悟空，是那里这等响振？”八戒道：“好一似地裂山崩。”沙僧道：“也就如雷声霹雳。”三藏道：“还是人喊马嘶。”孙行者笑道：“你们都猜不着，且住，待老孙看是何如。”</p>

<p>好行者，将身一纵，踏云光起在空中，睁眼观看，远见一座城池。又近觑，倒也祥光隐隐，不见甚么凶气纷纷。行者暗自沉吟道：“好去处！如何有响声振耳？那城中又无旌旗闪灼，戈戟光明，又不是炮声响振，何以若人马喧哗？”正议间，只见那城门外，有一块沙滩空地，攒簇了许多和尚，在那里扯车儿哩。</p>

<p>原来是一齐着力打号，齐喊“大力王菩萨”，所以惊动唐僧。行者渐渐按下云头来看处，呀！那车子装的都是砖瓦木植土坯之类；滩头上坡坂最高，又有一道夹脊小路，两座大关，关下之路都是直立壁陡之崖，那车儿怎么拽得上去？虽是天色和暖，那些人却也衣衫蓝缕，看此象十分窘迫。行者心疑道：“想是修盖寺院。他这里五谷丰登，寻不出杂工人来，所以这和尚亲自努力。”正自猜疑未定，只见那城门里，摇摇摆摆，走出两个少年道士来。你看他怎生打扮，但见他：头戴星冠，身披锦绣。头戴星冠光耀耀，身披锦绣彩霞飘。足踏云头履，腰系熟丝绦。面如满月多聪俊，形似瑶天仙客娇。那些和尚见道士来，一个个心惊胆战，加倍着力，恨苦的拽那车子。行者就晓得了：“咦！想必这和尚们怕那道士。不然啊，怎么这等着力拽扯？我曾听得人言，西方路上，有个敬道灭僧之处，断乎此间是也。我待要回报师父，奈何事不明白，返惹他怪，敢道这等一个伶俐之人，就不能探个实信？且等下去问得明白，好回师父话。</p>

<p>你道他来问谁？好大圣，按落云头，去郡城脚下，摇身一变，变做个游方的云水全真，左臂上挂着一个水火篮儿，手敲着渔鼓，口唱着道情词，近城门，迎着两个道士，当面躬身道：</p>

<p>“道长，贫道起手。”那道士还礼道：“先生那里来的？”行者道：</p>

<p>“我弟子云游于海角，浪荡在天涯；今朝来此处，欲募善人家。</p>

<p>动问二位道长，这城中那条街上好道？那个巷里好贤？我贫道好去化些斋吃。”那道士笑道：“你这先生，怎么说这等败兴的话？”行者道：“何为败兴？”道士道：“你要化些斋吃，却不是败兴？”行者道：“出家人以乞化为由，却不化斋吃，怎生有钱买？”</p>

<p>道士笑道：“你是远方来的，不知我这城中之事。我这城中，且休说文武官员好道，富民长者爱贤，大男小女见我等拜请奉斋，这般都不须挂齿，头一等就是万岁君王好道爱贤。”行者道：“我贫道一则年幼，二则是远方乍来，实是不知。烦二位道长将这里地名、君王好道爱贤之事，细说一遍，足见同道之情。”道士说：“此城名唤车迟国，宝殿上君王与我们有亲。”行者闻言呵呵笑道：“想是道士做了皇帝？”他道：“不是。只因这二十年前，民遭亢旱，天无点雨，地绝谷苗，不论君臣黎庶，大小人家，家家沐浴焚香，户户拜天求雨。正都在倒悬捱命之处，忽然天降下三个仙长来，俯救生灵。”行者问道：“是那三个仙长？”道士说：“便是我家师父。”行者道：“尊师甚号？”道士云：</p>

<p>“我大师父，号做虎力大仙；二师父，鹿力大仙；三师父，羊力大仙。”行者问曰：“三位尊师，有多少法力？”道士云：“我那师父，呼风唤雨，只在翻掌之间，指水为油，点石成金，却如转身之易。所以有这般法力，能夺天地之造化，换星斗之玄微，君臣相敬，与我们结为亲也。”行者道：“这皇帝十分造化。常言道，术动公卿。老师父有这般手段，结了亲，其实不亏他。噫，不知我贫道可有星星缘法，得见那老师父一面哩？”道士笑曰：“你要见我师父。有何难处！我两个是他靠胸贴肉的徒弟，我师父却又好道爱贤，只听见说个道字，就也接出大门。若是我两个引进你，乃吹灰之力。”行者深深的唱个大喏道：“多承举荐，就此进去罢。”道士说：“且少待片时，你在这里坐下，等我两个把公事干了来，和你进去。”行者道：“出家人无拘无束，自由自在，有甚公干？”道士用手指定那沙滩上僧人：“他做的是我家生活，恐他躲懒，我们去点他一卯就来。’行者笑道：“道长差了！</p>

<p>僧道之辈都是出家人，为何他替我们做活，伏我们点卯？”道士云：“你不知道，因当年求雨之时，僧人在一边拜佛，道士在一边告斗，都请朝廷的粮饷；谁知那和尚不中用，空念空经，不能济事。后来我师父一到，唤雨呼风，拔济了万民涂炭。却才恼了朝廷，说那和尚无用，拆了他的山门，毁了他的佛像，追了他的度牒，不放他回乡，御赐与我们家做活，就当小厮一般。我家里烧火的也是他，扫地的也是他，顶门的也是他。因为后边还有住房，未曾完备，着这和尚来拽砖瓦，拖木植，起盖房宇。只恐他贪顽躲懒，不肯拽车，所以着我两个去查点查点。”行者闻言。扯住道士滴泪道：“我说我无缘，真个无缘，不得见老师父尊面！”道士云：“如何不得见面？”行者道：“我贫道在方上云游，一则是为性命，二则也为寻亲。”道士问：“你有甚么亲？”行者道：“我有一个叔父，自幼出家，削发为僧，向日年程饥馑，也来外面求乞。这几年不见回家，我念祖上之恩，特来顺便寻访，想必是羁迟在此等地方，不能脱身，未可知也。我怎的寻着他见一面，才可与你进城？”道士云：“这般却是容易。我两个且坐下，即烦你去沙滩上替我一查，只点头目有五百名数目便罢，看内中那个是你令叔。果若有呀，我们看道中情分，放他去了，却与你进城好么？”</p>

<p>行者顶谢不尽，长揖一声，别了道士，敲着渔鼓，径往沙滩之上。过了双关，转下夹脊，那和尚一齐跪下磕头道：“爷爷，我等不曾躲懒，五百名半个不少，都在此扯车哩。”行者看见，暗笑道：“这些和尚，被道士打怕了，见我这假道士就这般悚惧，若是个真道士，好道也活不成了。”行者又摇手道：“不要跪，休怕。我不是监工的，我来此是寻亲的。”众僧们听说认亲，就把他圈子阵围将上来，一个个出头露面，咳嗽打响，巴不得要认出去。道：“不知那个是他亲哩。”行者认了一会，呵呵笑将起来，众僧道：“老爷不认亲，如何发笑？”行者道：“你们知我笑甚么？笑你这些和尚全不长俊！父母生下你来，皆因命犯华盖，妨爷克娘，或是不招姊妹，才把你舍断了出家。你怎的不遵三宝，不敬佛法，不去看经拜忏，却怎么与道士佣工，作奴婢使唤？”众僧道：“老爷，你来羞我们哩！你老人家想是个外边来的，不知我这里利害。”行者道：“果是外方来的，其实不知你这里有甚利害。”众僧滴泪道：“我们这一国君王，偏心无道，只喜得是老爷等辈，恼的是我们佛子。”行者道：“为何来？”众僧道：</p>

<p>“只因呼风唤雨，三个仙长来此处，灭了我等，哄信君王，把我们寺拆了，度牒追了，不放归乡，亦不许补役当差，赐与那仙长家使用，苦楚难当！但有个游方道者至此，即请拜王领赏；若是和尚来，不分远近，就拿来与仙长家佣工。”行者道：“想必那道士还有甚么巧法术，诱了君王？若只是呼风唤雨，也都是旁门小法术耳，安能动得君心？”众僧道：“他会抟砂炼汞，打坐存神，点水为油，点石成金。如今兴盖三清观宇，对天地昼夜看经忏悔，祈君王万年不老，所以就把君心惑动了。”行者道：“原来这般，你们都走了便罢。”众僧道：“老爷，走不脱！那仙长奏准君王，把我们画了影身图，四下里长川张挂。他这车迟国地界也宽，各府州县乡村店集之方，都有一张和尚图，上面是御笔亲题。若有官职的，拿得一个和尚，高升三级；无官职的，拿得一个和尚，就赏白银五十两，所以走不脱。且莫说是和尚，就是剪鬃、秃子、毛稀的，都也难逃。四下里快手又多，缉事的又广，凭你怎么也是难脱。我们没奈何，只得在此苦捱。”行者道：“既然如此，你们死了便罢。”众僧道：“老爷，有死的。到处捉来与本处和尚，也共有二千余众，到此熬不得苦楚，受不得爊煎，忍不得寒冷，服不得水土，死了有六七百，自尽了有七八百，只有我这五百个不得死。”行者道：“怎么不得死？”众僧道：“悬梁绳断，刀刎不疼，投河的飘起不沉，服药的身安不损。”行者道：</p>

<p>“你却造化，天赐汝等长寿哩！”众僧道：“老爷呀，你少了一个字儿，是长受罪哩！我等日食三餐，乃是糙米熬得稀粥，到晚就在沙滩上冒露安身，才合眼就有神人拥护。”行者道：“想是累苦了，见鬼么？”众僧道：“不是鬼，乃是六丁六甲、护教伽蓝，但至夜就来保护。但有要死的，就保着，不教他死。”行者道：“这些神却也没理，只该教你们早死早升天，却来保护怎的？”众僧道：“他在梦寐中劝解我们，教不要寻死，且苦捱着，等那东土大唐圣僧往西天取经的罗汉。他手下有个徒弟，乃齐天大圣，神通广大，专秉忠良之心，与人间报不平之事，济困扶危，恤孤念寡。只等他来显神通，灭了道士，还敬你们沙门禅教哩。”</p>

<p>行者闻得此言，心中暗笑道：“莫说老孙无手段，预先神圣早传名。”他急抽身，敲着渔鼓，别了众僧，径来城门口见了道士。那道士迎着道：“先生，那一位是令亲？”行者道：“五百个都与我有亲。”两个道士笑道：“你怎么就有许多亲？”行者道：“一百个是我左邻，一百个是我右舍，一百个是我父党，一百个是我母党，一百个是我交契。你若肯把这五百人都放了，我便与你进去；不放，我不去了。”道士云：“你想有些风病，一时间就胡说了。那些和尚，乃国王御赐，若放一二名，还要在师父处递了病状，然后补个死状，才了得哩。怎么说都放了？此理不通！</p>

<p>不通！且不要说我家没人使唤，就是朝廷也要怪。他那里长要差官查勘，或时御驾也亲来点札，怎么敢放？”行者道：“不放么？”道士说：“不放！”行者连问三声，就怒将起来，把耳朵里铁棒取出，迎风捻了一捻，就碗来粗细，幌了一幌，照道士脸上一刮，可怜就打得头破血流身倒地，皮开颈折脑浆倾！那滩上僧人远远望见他打杀了两个道士，丢了车儿，跑将上来道：“不好了！不好了！打杀皇亲了！”行者道：“那个是皇亲？”众僧把他簸箕阵围了，道：“他师父上殿不参王，下殿不辞主，朝廷常称做国师兄长先生。你怎么到这里闯祸？他徒弟出来监工，与你无干，你怎么把他来打死？那仙长不说是你来打杀，只说是来此监工，我们害了他性命，我等怎了？且与你进城去，会了人命出来。”行者笑道：“列位休嚷，我不是云水全真，我是来救你们的。”众僧道：“你倒打杀人，害了我们，添了担儿，如何是救我们的？”行者道：“我是大唐圣僧徒弟孙悟空行者，特特来此救你们性命。”众僧道：“不是！不是！那老爷我们认得他。”行者道：“又不曾会他，如何认得？”众僧道：“我们梦中尝见一个老者，自言太白金星，常教诲我等，说那孙行者的模样莫教错认了。”行者道：“他和你怎么说来？”众僧道：“他说那大圣：磕额金睛幌亮，圆头毛脸无腮。咨牙尖嘴性情乖，貌比雷公古怪。惯使金箍铁棒，曾将天阙攻开。如今皈正保僧来，专救人间灾害。”行者闻言，又嗔又喜，喜道替老孙传名！嗔道那老贼惫懒，把我的元身都说与这伙凡人！忽失声道：“列位诚然认我不是孙行者，我是孙行者的门人，来此处学闯祸耍子的。那里不是孙行者来了？”用手向东一指，哄得众僧回头，他却现了本相，众僧们方才认得，一个个倒身下拜道：“爷爷！我等凡胎肉眼，不知是爷爷显化。望爷爷与我们雪恨消灾，早进城降邪从正也！”行者道：“你们且跟我来。”众僧紧随左右。</p>

<p>那大圣径至沙滩上，使个神通，将车儿拽过两关，穿过夹脊，提起来，捽得粉碎，把那些砖瓦木植，尽抛下坡坂，喝教众僧：“散！莫在我手脚边，等我明日见这皇帝，灭那道士！”众僧道：“爷爷呀，我等不敢远走，但恐在官人拿住解来，却又吃打发赎，返又生灾。”行者道：“既如此，我与你个护身法儿。”好大圣，把毫毛拔了一把，嚼得粉碎，每一个和尚与他一截，都教他：“捻在无名指甲里，捻着拳头，只情走路。无人敢拿你便罢；</p>

<p>若有人拿你，攒紧了拳头，叫一声齐天大圣，我就来护你。”众僧道：“爷爷，倘若去得远了，看不见你，叫你不应，怎么是好？”</p>

<p>行者道：“你只管放心，就是万里之遥，可保全无事。”众僧有胆量大的，捻着拳头，悄悄的叫声“齐天大圣！”只见一个雷公站在面前，手执铁棒，就是千军万马，也不能近身。此时有百十众齐叫，足有百十个大圣护持，众僧叩头道：“爷爷！果然灵显！”</p>

<p>行者又吩咐：“叫声寂字，还你收了。”真个是叫声“寂！”依然还是毫毛在那指甲缝里。众和尚却才欢喜逃生，一齐而散。行者道：“不可十分远遁，听我城中消息。但有招僧榜出，就进城还我毫毛也。”五百个和尚，东的东，西的西，走的走，立的立，四散不题。</p>

<p>却说那唐僧在路旁，等不得行者回话，教猪八戒引马投西，遇着些僧人奔走，将近城边，见行者还与十数个未散的和尚在那里。三藏勒马道：“悟空，你怎么来打听个响声，许久不回？”行者引了十数个和尚，对唐僧马前施礼，将上项事说了一遍。三藏大惊道：“这般啊，我们怎了？”那十数个和尚道：“老爷放心，孙大圣爷爷乃天神降的，神通广大，定保老爷无虞。我等是这城里敕建智渊寺内僧人。因这寺是先王太祖御造的，现有先王太祖神象在内，未曾拆毁，城中寺院，大小尽皆拆了。我等请老爷赶早进城，到我荒山安下。待明日早朝，孙大圣必有处置。”行者道：“汝等说得是。也罢，趁早进城去来。”那长老却才下马，行到城门之下，此时已太阳西坠。过吊桥，进了三层门里，街上人见智渊寺的和尚牵马挑包，尽皆回避。正行时，却到山门前，但见那门上高悬着一面金字大匾，乃敕建智渊寺。众僧推开门，穿过金刚殿，把正殿门开了。唐僧取袈裟披起，拜毕金身，方入。众僧叫：“看家的！”老和尚走出来，看见行者就拜道，“爷爷！你来了？”行者道：“你认得我是那个爷爷，就是这等呼拜？”那和尚道：“我认得你是齐天大圣孙爷爷，我们夜夜梦中见你。太白金星常常来托梦，说道只等你来，我们才得性命。</p>

<p>今日果见尊颜与梦中无异。爷爷呀，喜得早来！再迟一两日，我等已俱做鬼矣！”行者笑道：“请起请起，明日就有分晓。”众僧安排了斋饭，他师徒们吃了，打扫乾净方丈，安寝一宿。</p>

<p>二更时候，孙大圣心中有事，偏睡不着，只听那里吹打，悄悄的爬起来，穿了衣服，跳在空中观看，原来是正南上灯烛荧煌。低下云头仔细再看，却是三清观道士禳星哩。但见那灵区高殿，福地真堂。灵区高殿，巍巍壮似蓬壶景；福地真堂，隐隐清如化乐宫。两边道士奏笙簧，正面高公擎玉简。宣理《消灾忏》，开讲《道德经》。扬尘几度尽传符，表白一番皆俯伏。咒水发檄，烛焰飘摇冲上界；查罡布斗，香烟馥郁透清霄。案头有供献新鲜，桌上有斋筵丰盛。殿门前挂一联黄绫织锦的对句，绣着二十二个大字，云：“雨顺风调，愿祝天尊无量法；河清海晏，祈求万岁有余年。”行者见三个老道士，披了法衣，想是那虎力、鹿力、羊力大仙。下面有七八百个散众，司鼓司钟，侍香表白，尽都侍立两边。行者暗自喜道：“我欲下去与他混一混，奈何单丝不线，孤掌难鸣，且回去照顾八戒沙僧，一同来耍耍。”</p>

<p>按落祥云，径至方丈中，原来八戒与沙僧通脚睡着。行者先叫悟净，沙和尚醒来道：“哥哥，你还不曾睡哩？”行者道：“你且起来，我和你受用些来。”沙僧道：“半夜三更，口枯眼涩，有甚受用？”行者道：“这城里果有一座三清观。观里道士们修蘸，三清殿上有许多供养：馒头足有斗大，烧果有五六十斤一个，衬饭无数，果品新鲜。和你受用去来！”那猪八戒睡梦里听见说吃好东西就醒了，道：“哥哥，就不带挈我些儿？”行者道：“兄弟，你要吃东西，不要大呼小叫，惊醒了师父，都跟我来。”他两个套上衣服，悄悄的走出门前，随行者踏了云头，跳将起去。那呆子看见灯光，就要下手，行者扯住道：“且休忙，待他散了，方可下去。”八戒道：“他才念到兴头上，却怎么肯散？”行者道：</p>

<p>“等我弄个法儿，他就散了。”好大圣，捻着诀，念个咒语，往巽地上吸一口气，呼的吹去，便是一阵狂风，径直卷进那三清殿上，把他些花瓶烛台，四壁上悬挂的功德，一齐刮倒，遂而灯火无光。众道士心惊胆战，虎力大仙道：“徒弟们且散，这阵神风所过，吹灭了灯烛香花，各人归寝，明朝早起，多念几卷经文补数。”众道士果各退回。</p>

<p>这行者却引八戒沙僧，按落云头，闯上三清殿。呆子不论生熟，拿过烧果来，张口就啃，行者掣铁棒，着手便打。八戒缩手躲过道：“还不曾尝着甚么滋味，就打！”行者道：“莫要小家子行，且叙礼坐下受用。”八戒道：“不羞！偷东西吃，还要叙礼！</p>

<p>若是请将来，却要如何？”行者道：“这上面坐的是甚么菩萨？”</p>

<p>八戒笑道：“三清也认不得，却认做甚么菩萨！”行者道：“那三清？”八戒道：“中间的是元始天尊，左边的是灵宝道君，右边的是太上老君。”行者道：“都要变得这般模样，才吃得安稳哩。”</p>

<p>那呆子急了，闻得那香喷喷供养要吃，爬上高台，把老君一嘴拱下去道：“老官儿，你也坐得彀了，让我老猪坐坐。”八戒变做太上老君，行者变做元始天尊，沙僧变作灵宝道君，把原象都推下去。及坐下时，八戒就抢大馒头吃，行者道：“莫忙哩！”八戒道：“哥哥，变得如此，还不吃等甚？”行者道：“兄弟呀，吃东西事小，泄漏天机事大。这圣象都推在地下，倘有起早的道士来撞钟扫地，或绊一个根头，却不走漏消息？你把他藏过一边来。”八戒道：“此处路生，摸门不着，却那里藏他？”行者道：“我才进来时，那右手下有一重小门儿，那里面秽气畜人，想必是个五谷轮回之所。你把他送在那里去罢。”这呆子有些夯力量，跳下来，把三个圣像拿在肩膊上，扛将出来。到那厢，用脚登开门看时，原来是个大东厕，笑道：“这个弼马温着然会弄嘴弄舌！把个毛坑也与他起个道号，叫做甚么五谷轮回之所！”那呆子扛在肩上且不丢了去，口里啯啯哝哝的祷道：“三清三清，我说你听：远方到此，惯灭妖精，欲享供养，无处安宁。借你坐位，略略少停。你等坐久，也且暂下毛坑。你平日家受用无穷，做个清净道士；今日里不免享些秽物，也做个受臭气的天尊！”祝罢，烹的望里一捽，灒了半衣襟臭水，走上殿来。行者道：“可藏得好么？”八戒道：“藏便藏得好；只是灒起些水来，污了衣服，有些腌脏臭气，你休恶心。”行者笑道：“也罢，你且来受用，但不知可得个干净身子出门哩。”那呆子还变做老君。三人坐下，尽情受用，先吃了大馒头，后吃簇盘、衬饭、点心、拖炉、饼锭、油煠、蒸酥，那里管甚么冷热，任情吃起。原来孙行者不大吃烟火食，只吃几个果子，陪他两个。那一顿如流星赶月，风卷残云，吃得罄尽，已此没得吃了，还不走路，且在那里闲讲消食耍子。</p>

<p>噫！有这般事！原来那东廊下有一个小道士才睡下，忽然起来道：“我的手铃儿忘记在殿上，若失落了，明日师父见责。”</p>

<p>与那同睡者道，“你睡着，等我寻去。”急忙中不穿底衣。止扯一领直裰，径到正殿中寻铃。摸来摸去，铃儿摸着了，正欲回头，只听得有呼吸之声，道士害怕。急拽步往外走时，不知怎的，躧着一个荔枝核子，扑的滑了一跌，狢的一声，把个铃儿跌得粉碎。猪八戒忍不住呵呵大笑出来，把个小道士唬走了三魂，惊回了七魄，一步一跌，撞到后方丈外，打着门叫：“师公！不好了！祸事了！”三个老道士还未曾睡，即开门问：“有甚祸事？”他战战兢兢道：“弟子忘失了手铃儿，因去殿上寻铃，只听得有人呵呵大笑，险些儿唬杀我也！”老道士闻言即叫：“掌灯来！看是甚么邪物？”一声传令，惊动那两廊的道士，大大小小，都爬起来点灯着火，往正殿上观看。不知端的何如，且听下回分解。</p>
