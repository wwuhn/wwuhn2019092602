<P>In the Almsgiver's Garden Antiquity and Causes Are Discussed</P>
<P>In the Court of India the King Meets the Monks</P>
</div>
<P>When thoughts arise there surely will be desire,</P>
<P>Longing is certain to lead one to disaster.</P>
<P>Why should intelligence distinguish the three ranks of nobility?</P>
<P>When conduct is complete it naturally returns to the primal sea.</P>
<P>Whether you become an immortal or a Buddha,</P>
<P>All must be arranged from within.</P>
<P>In absolute purity, with all dust removed,</P>
<P>All will be achieved and one will rise to heaven.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story tells how when Sanzang and his disciples were nowhere to be seen at dawn the monks in the Clouds of Compassion Monastery all said, &#8220;We couldn't keep them, we couldn't say goodbye to them, and we weren't able to ask them for anything. We've let those living Bodhisattvas slip clean away.&#8221;</P>
<P>As they were talking, some of the great families from the Southern outskirts of the city came in with invitations, at which the monks clapped their hands in regret and said, &#8220;We were caught off our guard last night: they all rode off by cloud.&#8221; Everyone then kowtowed to heaven in gratitude. The news was spread to all the officials in the city, who told the great families to prepare the five kinds of sacrificial animal, flowers and fruit to offer to the shrines in thanksgiving.</P>
<P>The story tells how the Tang Priest and his three disciples fed on the wind and slept in the open, travelling uneventfully for the best part of a month. One day they suddenly saw a high mountain. &#8220;Disciples,&#8221; said the Tang Priest in fear, &#8220;the ridge in front of us is very steep. You must be very careful.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As our journey has brought us so close to the land of the Buddha there will definitely be nothing evil here,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Don't worry, Master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; the Tang Priest replied, &#8220;although we are not far from the Buddha's land the monks told us in the monastery the other and they didn't know how much further after that.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Have you forgotten the<I> Heart Sutra</I> that the Rook's Nest Hermit taught you again, Master?&#8221; asked Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;The<I> Prajna-paramita Heart Sutra</I> is constantly with me, like my habit and begging bowl,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;There has not been a day ever since the Rook's Nest Hermit taught it to me that I have not recited it. I have never forgotten it for a moment. I can even recite it backwards. How could I possibly forget it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You can only recite it, Master,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;You never asked the hermit to explain it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Ape!&#8221; retorted Sanzang. &#8220;How can you say I don't understand it? Do you understand it then?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;I do.&#8221;</P>
<P>After that neither Sanzang nor Monkey made another sound. This had Pig falling about with laughter, while Friar Sand was hurting himself, he was so amused.</P>
<P>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;We all started out in life as monsters. We're not Dhyana monks who've heard the sutras being explained or Buddhist priests who've been taught the dharma. He's pretending, just putting on an act. How can you say you understand? Well then, why aren't you saying anything? We're listening. Please explain.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Second brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;leave him be. Big brother's only talking big like that to keep the master going. What he knows about is how to use a cudgel. What does he know about explaining sutras?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop talking such nonsense, Wuneng and Wujing,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;Wukong understands the wordless language. That is true explanation.&#8221;</P>
<P>As master and disciples talked they did indeed cover a long distance, leaving the ridge behind them. They saw a big monastery beside the road. &#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;There's a monastery ahead. Just look at it.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>It's neither too big nor too small,</P>
<P>But has green glazed tiles;</P>
<P>Neither too new nor too old,</P>
<P>And with a red wall.</P>
<P>Leaning canopies of azure pines can just be seen:</P>
<P>Who knows how many thousand years old they are?</P>
<P>Listen to the murmur of the waters in the channel,</P>
<P>Cut from the mountain untold dynasties ago.</P>
<P>Above the gates is written,</P>
<P>'Spread Gold Dhyana Monastery';</P>
<P>The tablet is inscribed,</P>
<P>'Ancient relic.'&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey saw that it was called the Spread Gold Dhyana Monastery, and Pig said so too. '&#8220;Spread Gold,'&#8220; Sanzang wondered as he sat on his horse, &#8220;'Spread Gold' ...Can we be in the country of Sravasti?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is very remarkable, Master,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;In all the years I've been with you you've never known the way before, but you seem to know it now.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;I have often read in the scriptures about the Buddha being in the Jetavana garden in the city of Sravasti. The Venerable Almsgiver Sudatta tried to buy it from the prince as a place to ask the Buddha to preach in. The prince refused to sell the garden, and said he would only part with it if it were covered with gold. When the Venerable Almsgiver heard this he had gold bricks made with which he covered the whole garden to buy it. Then he invited the Buddha to preach on the dharma. I am sure that the name Spread Gold Monastery must refer to that story.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We're in luck,&#8221; said Pig with a smile, &#8220;If that story's true we can find ourselves one of those bricks as a present to give people.&#8221; Everybody laughed, after which Sanzang dismounted.</P>
<P>As they went in through the monastery gates they saw people carrying loads with shoulder-poles or on their backs, pushing carts, or sitting in loaded carts. Others were sleeping or talking. The sight of the master, who was so handsome, and his three hideous disciples rather frightened them, so they drew back to make way.</P>
<P>Worried that his disciples would provoke trouble, Sanzang kept saying, &#8220;Behave yourselves! Behave yourselves!&#8221; They were all very restrained. As they went round the Vajra Hall a Dhyana monk of most unworldly appearance came out to meet them:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A face like a shining full moon,</P>
<P>A body like a bodhi tree.</P>
<P>The wind blew through the sleeve round his staff,</P>
<P>As his sandals trod the stony path.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Sanzang extended a monastic greeting to him the monk returned his courtesy and asked, &#8220;Where are you from, teacher?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am Chen Xuanzang,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;sent to the Western Heaven at the command of the Great Tang emperor in the East to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures. As my journey brings me here I am paying you this hasty visit to request a night's shelter before continuing on my way tomorrow.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This monastery of ours is one that receives people from all quarters,&#8221; the monk replied. &#8220;Everyone is welcome to visit, and we would be especially happy to provide for so holy a monk from the East as your reverend self.&#8221; Sanzang thanked him and called to his three disciples to come with him as they crossed the cloister and refectory and went to the abbot's lodgings. When they had exchanged courtesies they sat down as befits host and guests. Monkey and the other two sat down as well, their hands at their sides.</P>
<P>The story tells how, on learning that monks from Great Tang in the East who were going to fetch the scriptures had arrived, all in the monastery, young and old alike, whether permanent inmates, itinerant monks, elders or novices came to see them. After tea had been drunk a vegetarian meal was brought in. While Sanzang was still saying the grace before the meal Pig in his impatience had already grabbed and wolfed down steamed buns, vegetarian dishes and soup noodles. In the crowded abbot's lodgings those who knew better were admiring Sanzang's majestic bearing, while those who enjoyed fun watched Pig eat.</P>
<P>When Friar Sand cast his eyes around and saw what was happening he gave Pig a discreet pinch and muttered, &#8220;Behave yourself!&#8221;</P>
<P>At this Pig started a desperate howl of, &#8220;All this 'behave yourself, behave yourself!' I'm starving!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't understand, brother,&#8221; Friar Sand replied with a smile. &#8220;When it comes to the belly, all the well-behaved people in the world are exactly the same as we two.&#8221; Only then did Pig stop eating. After Sanzang had said the grace for the end of the meal the attendants cleared the tables and Sanzang expressed his thanks.</P>
<P>When the monks asked about why they had come from the East, Sanzang's conversation turned to ancient sites and he asked them about the name Spread Gold Monastery.</P>
<P>&#8220;This used to be the Monastery of the Venerable Almsgiver in the country of Sravasti,&#8221; the monks answered. &#8220;It was also known as the Jetavana and its name was changed to its present one after the Venerable Almsgiver covered the ground with gold bricks, in those days the Venerable Almsgiver used to live in the country of Sravasti, and our monastery was his Jetavana, which is why it was renamed the Almsgiver's Spread Gold Monastery. The site of the Jetavana is at the back of the monastery. Whenever there has been a torrential rainstorm in recent years, small pieces of gold and silver have been washed out, and some people are lucky enough to pick them up.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So the story is a true one,&#8221; said Sanzang, going on to ask, &#8220;Why did I see so many travelling merchants with horses, mules, carts and carrying-poles resting here when I came in through the gates of your monastery?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This mountain is called Mount Hundredfoot,&#8221; the monks replied. &#8220;We used to live in peace and prosperity here, but with the cyclic progression of the natural forces a number of centipede spirits have for some inexplicable reason appeared. They attack people on the roads and though nobody gets killed people don't dare to travel. At the foot of the mountain there's a Cock-crow Pass that people only dare to cross after cock-crow. As all these strangers arrived late they are worried that it would not be safe and are putting up here tonight. They'll set out at cock-crow.&#8221; As master and disciples were talking a vegetarian meal was brought in that they ate.</P>
<P>Sanzang and Monkey were strolling in the light of the rising half moon when a lay brother came to announce, &#8220;Our ancient master would like to meet the gentlemen from China.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang at once turned to see an ancient monk holding a bamboo cane who came forward to greet him and ask, &#8220;Are you the teacher come from China?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You do me too great an honour,&#8221; Sanzang replied, returning his greeting. The old monk was full of admiration for him, asking how old he was.</P>
<P>&#8220;I have wasted forty-five years,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;May I ask how old you are?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Just one sixty-year cycle older than you, teacher,&#8221; the other answered.</P>
<P>&#8220;Then you're a hundred and five this year,&#8221; Brother Monkey said. &#8220;How old do you think I am?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Teacher,&#8221; the old monk replied, &#8220;your appearance seems so ancient and your spirit so pure that I could not tell in a hurry, especially by moonlight with my poor eyes.&#8221; After talking for a while they walked to the back cloister for a look round.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where is the site of the Almsgiver's Garden that you mentioned just now?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Outside the back gate,&#8221; the other replied. On the order being given for the back gate to be opened immediately, all that could be seen was the ruined base of a stone wall. Putting his hands together, Sanzang sighed and said,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;I think of the benefactor Sudatta</P>
<P>Who gave his treasures to help the needy</P>
<P>The fame of Jetavana long endures;</P>
<P>Where is he now with the enlightened arhat?&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After a leisurely stroll enjoying the moonlight they sat down for a while on a terrace, where they heard the sound of sobbing. As Sanzang listened with a still heart he could hear that the weeper was grieving because her parents did not know of her suffering. This moved him to sorrow, and he found himself in tears as he turned to the monks and asked, &#8220;Who is it being so sad, and where?&#8221; On hearing this question the ancient monk sent all the others away to prepare tea, and when nobody else was around he kowtowed to the Tang Priest and Brother Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Venerable abbot,&#8221; said Sanzang, helping him to his feet again, &#8220;why do you pay me this courtesy?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As I am over a hundred,&#8221; the ancient monk replied, &#8220;I do know a little of the ways of the world; and in between periods of meditation and stillness I have seen some things. I know a certain amount about you, my lord, and your disciples, and you are not like other people. The only teachers here who would be able to analyze this most painful business are you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Tell me what it's all about,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;A year ago today,&#8221; the ancient monk replied, &#8220;I was concentrating my mind on the nature of the moon when I suddenly heard a gust of wind and the sound of someone grieving. I got out of bed, went into the Jetavana and saw a beautiful girl there. 'Whose daughter are you?' I asked her. 'Why are you here?' 'I am a princess, the daughter of the king of India,' the girl replied. 'The wind blew me here when I was looking at the flowers by moonlight.' I locked her up in an empty room that I bricked up like a prison cell, just leaving a gap in the door big enough to pass a bowl through. That day I told the other monks that she was an evil spirit I had captured. But as we monks are compassionate I couldn't kill her, and every day she is given two meals of simple food and drink to keep her alive. The girl is clever enough to understand what I mean, and to prevent herself from being sullied by the other monks she has pretended to be deranged and slept in her own piss and shit. During the day she talks nonsense or just sits there in silence, but in the still of the night she cries because she misses her parents. I've been into the city several times to make enquiries about the princesses, but not a single one is missing. So I have put her under stronger locks, and I am even more determined not to let her go. Now that you have come here, teacher, I beg you to go to the capital and use your dharma powers to find out the truth. You will thus be able both to rescue the good and display your magical powers.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Sanzang and Monkey heard this they noted it very carefully. As they were talking two junior monks came in to invite them to take tea and go to bed, so they went back inside.</P>
<P>Back in the abbot's lodgings Pig and Friar Sand were grumbling, &#8220;We'll have to be on our way at cock-crow tomorrow, so why aren't you in bed yet?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What's that you're saying, idiot?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Go to bed,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;Why are you admiring the blooming scenery this late?&#8221; At this the ancient monk left them, and the Tang Priest went to bed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sweet dreams of flowers in the moonlit silence;</P>
<P>Warm breezes coming through the window gauze.</P>
<P>As water drips in the clepsydra to fill three sections,</P>
<P>The Milky Way shines on the splendors of the palace.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>They had not slept long that night when they heard the cocks crowing. The traders in front of the monastery all got up noisily and prepared their breakfast by lamplight. The venerable elder woke up Pig and Friar Sand to bridle the horse and pack up, while Monkey called for lamps to be lit. The monks of the monastery, who were up already, set out tea, soup and snacks, and waited on them. Pig ate a plate of steamed buns with delight then took the luggage and the horse outside while Sanzang and Brother Monkey took their leave of all the monks.</P>
<P>&#8220;Please don't forget about that very tragic business,&#8221; said the ancient monk.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll give it all my attention,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;all my attention. Once I'm in the city I'll be able to find out the truth from what I hear and see.&#8221; They traders noisily set off together. By the last watch of the night they were through Cockcrow Pass, and by ten in the morning the walls of the city were in sight. It was indeed a powerful city as strong as an iron cauldron, the heavenly capital of a divine region. The city</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Was a crouching tiger or a coiled dragon on high ground,</P>
<P>Colorful with its phoenix towers and unicorn halls.</P>
<P>The waters of the royal moat encircled it like a belt;</P>
<P>In his mountainside paradise were many a monument.</P>
<P>The morning sun lit up banners by the high-way;</P>
<P>The spring wind carried the sound of pipes and drums across the bridges.</P>
<P>The wise king was dressed in robes and crown,</P>
<P>The crops were abundant and the splendor manifest.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>That day they reached the streets of the Eastern market, where the traders all put up at inns. As Sanzang and his disciples were walking in the city they came to a government hostel and went inside. The hostel manager went to report to the hostel superintendent that there were four strange-looking monks outside who had arrived with a white horse. On being told about the horse the superintendent realized that they must be on an official mission, so he went out to welcome them.</P>
<P>&#8220;I have been sent by the Tang court in the East to the Great Thunder Monastery on Vulture Peak to see the Buddha and seek the scriptures,&#8221; Sanzang replied with a bow. &#8220;I have a passport to present at court for inspection. I would be grateful if I could spend the night in Your Excellency's distinguished hostel. I will be on my way when my business has been done.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This hostel has been established to entertain envoys and travelers,&#8221; the superintendent replied, returning his bow, &#8220;so it is only right that we should entertain you. Please come in, please come in.&#8221;</P>
<P>A delighted Sanzang invited his disciples to come in to meet the superintendent, who was quietly appalled by their hideous faces. He did not know whether they were men or demons, so he trembled as he saw to tea and a vegetarian meal for them. Noticing his fright, Sanzang said, &#8220;Don't be afraid, Your Excellency. My three disciples look hideous, but they are good at heart. As the saying goes, the faces are ugly but the men are kind. There's nothing to be afraid of about them.&#8221;</P>
<P>The hostel superintendent's worries were eased when he heard this. &#8220;Where is your Tang court, Teacher of the Nation?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In the land of China in the continent of Jambu,&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;When did you leave home?&#8221; was the next question.</P>
<P>&#8220;In the thirteenth year of<I> Zhenguan,</I> fourteen years ago,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;I had to cross thousands of rivers and mountains&#8212;it was very hard&#8212;to arrive here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You are a holy monk,&#8221; the hostel superintendent said.</P>
<P>&#8220;How old is your exalted dynasty?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is the great land of India,&#8221; the superintendent replied, &#8220;and the dynasty has endured for over five hundred years since our High Ancestor. Our reigning sovereign, who is a lover of landscapes and flowers, is known as the Happy Emperor. His reign-period is called<I> Jingyan</I> and is now in its twenty-eighth year.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I would like to have an audience with His Majesty today to have the passport inspected and returned,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;When does he hold court?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Splendid,&#8221; the superintendent said, &#8220;absolutely splendid. Today is the twentieth birthday of Her Royal Highness, the king's daughter. A decorated tower has been built at the crossroads, where the princess is going to throw down an embroidered ball to let heaven decide who her husband it to be. Today is a very lively one, and I believe that His Majesty will not yet have finished his morning audience. This would be a good time to go if you wish to have your passport inspected and returned.&#8221; Sanzang was just about to set happily off when the meal was brought in, so he ate it with the superintendent, Monkey and the other two.</P>
<P>By now it was past midday, and Sanzang said, &#8220;I had better be going.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll escort you, Master,&#8221; said Brother Monkey. &#8220;Me too,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;No, don't, brother,&#8221; put in Friar Sand. &#8220;Your face is nothing much to look at, so there's no point in your going to look impressive outside the palace gates. Best let our big brother go,&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wujing is right,&#8221; Sanzang commented. &#8220;The idiot is coarse and stupid. Wukong is more clever and subtle.&#8221; The idiot thrust his snout out and said, &#8220;Apart from you, Master, there's not much to choose between our three faces.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang then put on his cassock. Monkey took the passport case had accompanied him. In the streets everyone&#8212;gentleman, peasant; artisan, trader, scholar, pen-pusher, dim-wit, or common man&#8212;was exclaiming, &#8220;Let's go and see the embroidered ball being thrown.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang stood beside the road and said to Monkey, &#8220;People, clothes, buildings, language and speech here are all the same as in our Great Tang. I remember that my late mother married after throwing an embroidered ball to make the match she was destined for, and they have that custom here too.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What about us going to take a look too?&#8221; asked Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;We are not wearing the right clothes for the occasion. We might arouse suspicion.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you've forgotten what the ancient monk in the Spread Gold Monastery told us. We could find out whether she is genuine or not while we're taking a good look at the decorated tower. With all this bustle and activity the king is bound to be going to hear the princess's good news. He won't bother with court business. Let's go.&#8221; On hearing this Sanzang did indeed go with Monkey. All kinds of people were there to watch the throwing of the embroidered ball. Oh dear! Little did they know that by going they were like a fisherman casting his hook and line and catching himself trouble.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story now explains that two years earlier the king of India had taken his queen, consorts and daughter into the royal garden to enjoy a moonlit night because he so loved landscapes and flowers. This had provoked an evil spirit, who had carried the princess off and turned herself into the girl's double. When she learned that the Tang Priest was coming at this time, day, month and year the evil spirit had used the wealth of the kingdom to build the decorated tower in the hope of winning him as her mate and absorbing his true masculine primal essence to make herself a superior immortal of the Great Monad.</P>
<P>At the third mark of the noonday hour, when Sanzang and Monkey had joined in the crowd and were approaching the tower, the princess lit some incense and prayed to heaven and earth. She was surrounded by five or six dozen exquisitely made-up beauties who were attending her and holding her embroidered ball for her. The tower had many windows on all sides. As the princess looked around she saw the Tang Priest approaching, so she took the embroidered ball and threw it with her own hands at the Tang Priest's head. It knocked his Vairocana mitre askew, giving him such a start that he immediately reached with both hands to steady the ball, which rolled down his sleeve.</P>
<P>At once there were great shouts from everyone on the tower of, &#8220;She's hit a monk! She's hit a monk!&#8221;</P>
<P>Oh dear! All the travelling merchants at the crossroads pushed and shouted as they rushed to grab the embroidered ball, to be met by Monkey with a shout and bared teeth as he bent forward then grew to the majestic height of thirty feet. The hideous face he made gave them all such a fright that they collapsed and crawled about, not daring to come closer. A moment later they had all scattered and Monkey resumed his true form.</P>
<P>The maids, palace beauties and senior and junior eunuchs who had been in the tower all camp up to the Tang Priest, kowtowed to him and said, &#8220;Your Highness, we beg you to come to the palace to be congratulated.&#8221; Sanzang was quick to return their greetings and help them all back to their feet.</P>
<P>He then turned back to grumble at Monkey, &#8220;Ape! You've been trying to make a fool of me again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It was your head the embroidered ball landed on,&#8221; Monkey replied with a laugh, &#8220;and your sleeve it rolled into. Nothing to do with me, so what are you moaning at me for?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What are we going to do?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop worrying, Master,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;While you go to the palace to see the king I'll go back to the hostel to tell Pig and Friar Sand to wait. If the princess doesn't want you, that'll be that. You submit the passport and we can be on our way. If the princess insists on marriage you must say to the king, 'Please send for my disciples so that I can take my leave of them.' When we three are summoned to court I'll be able to tell whether the princess is real or an impostor. This is the trick called 'subduing a demon through marriage.'&#8220; The Tang Priest had nothing to say as Monkey turned away and went back to the hostel.</P>
<P>The venerable elder was hustled by the palace beauties and the rest of them to the foot of the tower, from where the princess came down to support him with her jade hand as they both entered the royal carriage. The retinue formed a procession to return to the palace gates.</P>
<P>The eunuch gate-officer at once reported to the king, &#8220;Your Majesty, Her Royal Highness the princess is outside the Meridional Gate, holding a monk's arm and waiting to be summoned. I expect she hit him with her embroidered ball.&#8221;</P>
<P>The king was most displeased to hear this, and wanted to have the monk driven away, but as he did not know what the princess had in mind he restrained his feelings and summoned them in. The princess and the Tang Priest came in to stand beneath the throne hall. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Man and future wife both hailed the king aloud;</P>
<P>Good and ill together with deep respect kowtowed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When this ceremonial had been performed they were called into the throne hall, where the king began by asking, &#8220;Where are you from, monk? Did our daughter hit you with her ball?&#8221;</P>
<P>The Tang Priest prostrated himself to reply, &#8220;I have been sent by the emperor of Great Tang in the continent of Jambu to the Western Heaven to worship the Buddha and seek the scriptures in the Great Thunder Monastery. As I carry a passport for this long journey I was coming to present it for inspection at Your Majesty's dawn audience when I passed a decorated tower at a crossroads, never imagining that Her Royal Highness the princess would throw an embroidered ball that would hit me on the head. As I am a monk and belong to a different faith I could not possibly marry your exquisite daughter, so I beg you to spare me the death penalty and return the passport. Then I can be on my way and soon reach Vulture Peak, see the Buddha, ask for the scriptures and return to my own country, where Your Majesty's divine mercy will be for ever recorded.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So you are a holy monk from the East,&#8221; the king replied. &#8220;Indeed, 'a thread can draw together a fated match across a thousand miles.' Our princess has reached the age of nineteen and is still unmarried, and as the hour, day, month and year are all now auspicious a decorated tower was set up for her to choose a good husband by throwing the ball from it. You just happened to be hit by it, and although this does not please us we would like to know the princess's views.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty my father,&#8221; the princess replied, kowtowing, &#8220;as the saying goes, 'Marry a cockerel and follow a cockerel; marry a dog and follow a dog.' I swore a vow beforehand, made the ball and told heaven, earth and the gods that heaven would choose as my husband the man my ball hit. As the ball hit the holy monk today this must have been fated ever since an earlier incarnation, which is why we met today. I would never dare to change my mind. I ask you to take him as your son-in-law.&#8221;</P>
<P>Only then was the king happy, and he commanded the chief royal astrologer to choose a day. While organizing the trousseau the king issued proclamations to the world. When Sanzang heard this, so far from thanking the king for his kindness, he pleaded, &#8220;Forgive me, forgive me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're most unreasonable, monk,&#8221; the king replied. &#8220;We offer you a nation's wealth to be our son-in-law. Why won't you stay here and enjoy yourself? All you can think about is fetching the scriptures. If you go on refusing we will have the palace guards take you out and behead you.&#8221;</P>
<P>The venerable elder was so frightened by this that his soul left his body as he kowtowed, trembling, and submitted, &#8220;I am grateful for Your Majesty's heavenly grace, but there are four of us monks travelling West. I have three disciples outside. If I am now to be taken as your son-in-law I beg you to summon them inside as I have not yet taken my leave of them. Then you can return the passport and let them go at once, so that they will not fail in the purpose of their journey to the West.&#8221;</P>
<P>The king approved this request, asking, &#8220;Where are your disciples?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In the government hostel for foreigners,&#8221; Sanzang replied, and officers were at once sent to fetch the holy monk's disciples to receive the passport and be on their way, leaving the holy monk there to be the princess's husband. The venerable elder could only rise to his feet and stand in attendance.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>For the Great Elixir not to leak away the Triple Completeness is needed;</P>
<P>Blame an evil fate if the ascetic way is hard.</P>
<P>The Way is in the sage traditions; cultivation depends on the self;</P>
<P>Goodness is accumulated by people, but blessings come from Heaven.</P>
<P>Do not give play to the six sense-organs and their many desires;</P>
<P>Open up the single nature, original and primary.</P>
<P>When there are no attachments or thoughts, purity comes of itself;</P>
<P>Strive for liberation and achieve transcendence.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We will say no more of how officers were sent to the hostel to fetch Sanzang's three disciples.</P>
<P>Instead the story tells how Monkey, after taking his leave of Sanzang at the foot of the decorated tower, went happily back to the hostel, laughing aloud as he walked. &#8220;Why are you laughing so cheerfully, brother,&#8221; Pig and Friar Sand asked as they greeted him, &#8220;and why's the master disappeared?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The master has found happiness,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;What happiness?&#8221; Pig asked. &#8220;He hasn't reached the end of the journey, he hasn't seen the Buddha and he hasn't fetched the scriptures.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The master and I only got as far as the foot of a decorated tower at the crossroads,&#8221; Brother Monkey replied. &#8220;Just then the king's daughter hit the master with an embroidered ball, so he was hustled by palace beauties, pretty girls and eunuchs to the front of the tower, where he climbed into a carriage to go to the palace with the princess. He's been invited to become the king's son-in-law. Isn't that something to be cheerful about?&#8221;</P>
<P>When Pig heard this he stamped, beat his chest and said, &#8220;If I'd known beforehand, I'd have gone too. It was all Friar Sand's fault for making trouble. I'd have run straight to the foot of the decorated tower, the embroidered ball would have hit me first time, and the princess would have taken me for her husband. That would have been marvellous, terrific. I'm handsome and good-looking: I'd have been just the man. We'd all have been in luck and have had a good time. It'd have been real fun.&#8221;</P>
<P>Friar Sand went up to Pig, rubbed his face and said, &#8220;Shameless, you're shameless! That's a handsome mug, I must say. You're like the man who bought an old donkey for three-tenths of an ounce of silver and boasted that he'd be able to ride it. If she'd hit you first time she wouldn't have wanted to wait till tonight before burning spells to get rid of you. Do you think she'd have let trouble like you into the palace?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're being very disagreeable, you blacky,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;Ugly I may be, but I've got class. As the old saying goes, 'When skin and flesh are coarse, the bones may yet be strong: everyone is good at something.'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop talking nonsense, idiot,&#8221; Monkey retorted, &#8220;and pack the baggage. I expect the master will get anxious and send for us, so we must be ready to go to protect him at court.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're wrong again, brother,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;If the master's become the king's son-in-law and gone to take his pleasure with the king's daughter, he won't be climbing any more mountains, or tramping along the road, or running into demons and monsters. So what'll he want you to protect him from? He's old enough to know what happens under the bedcovers. He won't need you to hold him up.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey grabbed Pig by the ear, swung his fist, and said abusively, &#8220;You're as dirty-minded as ever, you cretin! How dare you talk such nonsense!&#8221;</P>
<P>While they were in the middle of their quarrel the hostel superintendent came to report, &#8220;His Majesty has sent an official here with a request for you three holy monks to present yourselves.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What's he really asking us to go for?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The senior holy monk had the good fortune to be hit by the princess's golden ball and be taken as her husband,&#8221; the superintendent replied, &#8220;which is why the official has come with invitations for you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where is the official?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;Send him in.&#8221;</P>
<P>The official then bowed in greeting to Monkey, after which he did not dare look straight at Monkey as he muttered to himself, &#8220;Is it a ghost? a monster? a thunder god? a yaksha?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why are you mumbling instead of saying whatever you have to say, official?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>Trembling with terror, the official raised the royal edict with both hands as his words came tumbling out in confusion: &#8220;Her Royal Highness&#8212;invitation&#8212;meet her new relations&#8212;Her Royal Highness&#8212;meet her relations&#8212;invitation....&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We've got no torture equipment here and we're not going to beat you,&#8221; Pig said, &#8220;so don't be frightened and take your time telling us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do you think he's scared you're going to beat him?&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;What he's scared of is your ugly mug. Get the carrying-pole load packed up at once. We're taking the horse and going to court to see the master and talk things over.&#8221; Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>One you meet on a narrow path is hard to avoid;</P>
<P>Determination can turn love to hatred.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you do not know what was said when they met the king, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>给孤园问古谈因</p>
<p>天竺国朝王遇偶</p>
</div>
<p>起念断然有爱，留情必定生灾。灵明何事辨三台？行满自归元海。不论成仙成佛，须从个里安排。清清净净绝尘埃，果正飞升上界。却说寺僧，天明不见了三藏师徒，都道：“不曾留得，不曾别得，不曾求告得，清清的把个活菩萨放得走了！”正说处，只见南关厢有几个大户来请，众僧扑掌道：“昨晚不曾防御，今夜都驾云去了。”众人齐望空拜谢。此言一讲，满城中官员人等，尽皆知之，叫此大户人家，俱治办五牲花果，往生祠祭献酬恩不题。</p>

<p>却说唐僧四众，餐风宿水，一路平宁，行有半个多月。忽一日，见座高山，唐僧又悚惧道：“徒弟，那前面山岭峻峭，是必小心！”行者笑道：“这边路上将近佛地，断乎无甚妖邪，师父放怀勿虑。”唐僧道：“徒弟，虽然佛地不远。但前日那寺僧说，到天竺国都下有二千里，还不知是有多少路哩。”行者道：“师父，你好是又把乌巢禅师《心经》忘记了也？”三藏道：“《般若心经》是我随身衣钵。自那乌巢禅师教后，那一日不念，那一时得忘？颠倒也念得来，怎会忘得！”行者道：“师父只是念得，不曾求那师父解得。”三藏说：“猴头！怎又说我不曾解得！你解得么？”行者道：“我解得，我解得。”自此，三藏、行者再不作声。旁边笑倒一个八戒，喜坏一个沙僧，说道：“嘴脸！替我一般的做妖精出身，又不是那里禅和子，听过讲经，那里应佛僧，也曾见过说法？弄虚头，找架子，说甚么晓得，解得！怎么就不作声？听讲！</p>

<p>请解！”沙僧说：“二哥，你也信他。大哥扯长话，哄师父走路。他晓得弄棒罢了，他那里晓得讲经！”三藏道：“悟能悟净，休要乱说，悟空解得是无言语文字，乃是真解。”</p>

<p>他师徒们正说话间，却倒也走过许多路程，离了几个山冈，路旁早见一座大寺。三藏道：“悟空，前面是座寺啊，你看那寺，倒也不小不大，却也是琉璃碧瓦；半新半旧，却也是八字红墙。隐隐见苍松偃盖，也不知是几千百年间故物到于今；潺潺听流水鸣弦，也不道是那朝代时分开山留得在。山门上，大书着布金禅寺；悬扁上，留题着上古遗迹。”行者看得是布金禅寺，八戒也道是布金禅寺，三藏在马上沉思道：“布金，布金，这莫不是舍卫国界了么？”八戒道：“师父，奇啊！我跟师父几年，再不曾见识得路，今日也识得路了。”三藏说道：“不是，我常看经诵典，说是佛在舍卫城祇树给孤园。这园说是给孤独长者问太子买了，请佛讲经。太子说：‘我这园不卖。他若要买我的时，除非黄金满布园地。’给孤独长者听说，随以黄金为砖，布满园地，才买得太子祇园，才请得世尊说法。我想这布金寺莫非就是这个故事？”八戒笑道：“造化！若是就是这个故事，我们也去摸他块把砖儿送人。”大家又笑了一会，三藏才下得马来。</p>

<p>进得山门，只见山门下挑担的，背包的，推车的，整车坐下；也有睡的去睡，讲的去讲。忽见他们师徒四众，俊的又俊，丑的又丑，大家有些害怕，却也就让开些路儿。三藏生怕惹事，口中不住只叫：“斯文！斯文！”这时节，却也大家收敛。转过金刚殿后，早有一位禅僧走出，却也威仪不俗。真是：面如满月光，身似菩提树。拥锡袖飘风，芒鞋石头路。三藏见了问讯。那僧即忙还礼道：“师从何来？”三藏道：“弟子陈玄奘，奉东土大唐皇帝之旨，差往西天拜佛求经。路过宝方，造次奉谒，便求借一宿，明日就行。”那僧道：“荒山十方常住，都可随喜，况长老东土神僧，但得供养，幸甚。”三藏谢了，随即唤他三人同行，过了回廊香积，径入方丈。相见礼毕，分宾主坐定，行者三人，亦垂手坐了。</p>

<p>话说这时寺中听说到了东土大唐取经僧人，寺中若大若小，不问长住、挂榻、长老、行童，一一都来参见。茶罢，摆上斋供。这时长老还正开斋念偈，八戒早是要紧，馒头、素食、粉汤一搅直下。这时方丈却也人多，有知识的赞说三藏威仪，好耍子的都看八戒吃饭。却说沙僧眼溜，看见头底，暗把八戒捏了一把，说道：“斯文！”八戒着忙，急的叫将起来，说道：“斯文斯文！肚里空空！”沙僧笑道：“二哥，你不晓的，天下多少斯文，若论起肚子里来，正替你我一般哩。”八戒方才肯住。三藏念了结斋，左右彻了席面，三藏称谢。</p>

<p>寺僧问起东土来因，三藏说到古迹，才问布金寺名之由。</p>

<p>那僧答曰：“这寺原是舍卫国给孤独园寺，又名祇园。因是给孤独长者请佛讲经，金砖布地，又易今名。我这寺一望之前，乃是舍卫国，那时给孤独长者正在舍卫国居住。我荒山原是长者之祇园，因此遂名给孤布金寺，寺后边还有祇园基址。近年间，若遇时雨滂沱，还淋出金银珠儿，有造化的，每每拾着。”三藏道：</p>

<p>“话不虚传果是真！”又问道：“才进宝山，见门下两廊有许多骡马车担的行商，为何在此歇宿？”众僧道：“我这山唤做百脚山。</p>

<p>先年且是太平，近因天气循环，不知怎的，生几个蜈蚣精，常在路下伤人。虽不至于伤命，其实人不敢走。山下有一座关，唤做鸡鸣关，但到鸡鸣之时，才敢过去。那些客人因到晚了，惟恐不便，权借荒山一宿，等鸡鸣后便行。”三藏道：“我们也等鸡鸣后去罢。”师徒们正说处，又见拿上斋来，却与唐僧等吃毕。此时上弦月皎，三藏与行者步月闲行，又见个道人来报道：“我们老师爷要见见中华人物。”三藏急转身，见一个老和尚，手持竹杖，向前作礼道：“此位就是中华来的师父？”三藏答礼道：“不敢。”老僧称赞不已。因问：“老师高寿？”三藏道：“虚度四十五年矣，敢问老院主尊寿？”老僧笑道：“比老师痴长一花甲也。”</p>

<p>行者道：“今年是一百零五岁了，你看我有多少年纪？”老僧道：</p>

<p>“师家貌古神清，况月夜眼花，急看不出来。”叙了一会，又向后廊看看。三藏道：“才说给孤园基址，果在何处？”老僧道：“后门外就是。”快教开门，但见是一块空地，还有些碎石迭的墙脚。</p>

<p>三藏合掌叹曰：“忆昔檀那须达多，曾将金宝济贫疴。祇园千古留名在，长者何方伴觉罗？”</p>

<p>他都玩着月，缓缓而行，行近后门外，至台上又坐了一坐。</p>

<p>忽闻得有啼哭之声，三藏静心诚听，哭的是爷娘不知苦痛之言。他就感触心酸，不觉泪堕，回问众僧道：“是甚人在何处悲切？”老僧见问，即命众僧先回去煎茶，见无人方才对唐僧行者下拜。三藏搀起道：“老院主，为何行此礼？”老僧道：“弟子年岁百余，略通人事。每于禅静之间，也曾见过几番景象。若老爷师徒，弟子聊知一二，与他人不同。若言悲切之事，非这位师家，明辨不得。”行者道：“你且说是甚事？”老僧道：“旧年今日，弟子正明性月之时，忽闻一阵风响，就有悲怨之声。弟子下榻，到祇园基上看处，乃是一个美貌端正之女。我问他：‘你是谁家女子？为甚到于此地？’那女子道：‘我是天竺国国王的公主。因为月下观花，被风刮来的。’我将他锁在一间敝空房里，将那房砌作个监房模样，门上止留一小孔，仅递得碗过。当日与众僧传道，是个妖邪，被我捆了，但我僧家乃慈悲之人，不肯伤他性命。每日与他两顿粗茶粗饭，吃着度命。那女子也聪明，即解吾意，恐为众僧点污，就装风作怪，尿里眠，屎里卧。白日家说胡话，呆呆邓邓的；到夜静处，却思量父母啼哭。我几番家进城乞化打探公主之事，全然无损。故此坚收紧锁，更不放出。今幸老师来国，万望到了国中，广施法力，辨明辨明，一则救拔良善，二则昭显神通也。”三藏与行者听罢，切切在心。正说处，只见两个小和尚请吃茶安置，遂而回去。</p>

<p>八戒与沙僧在方丈中，突突哝哝的道：“明日要鸡鸣走路，此时还不来睡！”行者道：“呆子又说甚么？”八戒道：“睡了罢，这等夜深，还看甚么景致。”因此，老僧散去，唐僧就寝。正是那：人静月沉花梦悄，暖风微透壁窝纱。铜壶点点看三汲，银汉明明照九华。</p>

<p>当夜睡还未久，即听鸡鸣，那前边行商烘烘皆起，引灯造饭。这长老也唤醒八戒沙僧扣马收拾，行者叫点灯来。那寺僧已先起来，安排茶汤点心，在后候敬。八戒欢喜，吃了一盘馍馍，把行李马匹牵出。三藏、行者对众辞谢，老僧又向行者道：</p>

<p>“悲切之事，在心在心！”行者笑道：“谨领谨领！我到城中，自能聆音而察理，见貌而辨色也。”那伙行商，哄哄嚷嚷的，也一同上了大路，将有寅时，过了鸡鸣关。至巳时，方见城垣，真是铁瓮金城，神洲天府。那城：虎踞龙蟠形势高，凤楼麟阁彩光摇。</p>

<p>御沟流水如环带，福地依山插锦标。晓日旌旗明辇路，春风箫鼓遍溪桥。国王有道衣冠胜，五谷丰登显俊豪。</p>

<p>当日入于东市街，众商各投旅店。他师徒们进城，正走处，有一个会同馆驿，三藏等径入驿内。那驿内管事的，即报驿丞道：“外面有四个异样的和尚，牵一匹白马进来了。”驿丞听说有马，就知是官差的，出厅迎迓。三藏施礼道：“贫僧是东土唐朝钦差灵山大雷音见佛求经的，随身有关文，入朝照验。借大人高衙一歇，事毕就行。”驿丞答礼道：“此衙门原设待使客之处，理当款迓，请进，请进。”三藏喜悦，教徒弟们都来相见。那驿丞看见嘴脸丑陋，暗自心惊，不知是人是鬼，战兢兢的，只得看茶，摆斋。三藏见他惊怕，道：“大人勿惊，我等三个徒弟，相貌虽丑，心地俱良，俗谓山恶人善，何以惧为！”驿丞闻言，方才定了心性问道：“国师，唐朝在于何方？”三藏道：“在南赡部洲中华之地。”又问：“几时离家？”三藏道：“贞观十三年，今已历过十四载，苦经了些万水千山，方到此处。”驿丞道：“神僧！神僧！”三藏问道：“上国天年几何？”驿丞道：“我敝处乃大天竺国，自太祖太宗传到今，已五百余年。现在位的爷爷，爱山水花卉，号做怡宗皇帝，改元靖宴，今已二十八年了。”三藏道：“今日贫僧要去见驾倒换关文，不知可得遇朝？”驿丞道：“好！好！</p>

<p>正好！近因国王的公主娘娘，年登二十青春，正在十字街头，高结彩楼，抛打绣球，撞天婚招驸马。今日正当热闹之际，想我国王爷爷还未退期，若欲倒换关文，趁此时好去。”三藏欣然要走，只见摆上斋来，遂与驿丞、行者等吃了。</p>

<p>时已过午，三藏道：“我好去了。”行者道：“我保师父去。”</p>

<p>八戒道：“我去。”沙僧道：“二哥罢么，你的嘴脸不见怎的，莫到朝门外装胖，还教大哥去。”三藏道：“悟净说得好，呆子粗夯，悟空还有些细腻。”那呆子掬着嘴道：“除了师父，我三个的嘴脸也差不多儿。”三藏却穿了袈裟，行者拿了引袋同去。只见街坊上，士农工商，文人墨客，愚夫俗子，齐咳咳都道：“看抛绣球去也！”三藏立于道旁对行者道：“他这里人物衣冠，宫室器用，言语谈吐，也与我大唐一般。我想着我俗家先母也是抛打绣球遇旧姻缘，结了夫妇。此处亦有此等风俗。”行者道：“我们也去看看如何？”三藏道：“不可！不可！你我服色不便，恐有嫌疑。”</p>

<p>行者道：“师父，你忘了那给孤布金寺老僧之言：一则去看彩楼，二则去辨真假。似这般忙忙的，那皇帝必听公主之喜报，那里视朝理事？且去去来！”三藏听说，真与行者相随，见各项人等俱在那里看打绣球。呀！那知此去，却是渔翁抛下钩和线，从今钓出是非来。</p>

<p>话表那个天竺国王，因爱山水花卉，前年带后妃、公主在御花园月夜赏玩，惹动一个妖邪，把真公主摄去，他却变做一个假公主。知得唐僧今年今月今日今时到此，他假借国家之富，搭起彩楼，欲招唐僧为偶，采取元阳真气，以成太乙上仙。</p>

<p>正当午时三刻，三藏与行者杂入人丛，行近楼下，那公主才拈香焚起，祝告天地。左右有五七十胭娇绣女，近侍的捧着绣球。</p>

<p>那楼八窗玲珑，公主转睛观看，见唐僧来得至近，将绣球取过来，亲手抛在唐僧头上。唐僧着了一惊，把个毗卢帽子打歪，双手忙扶着那球，那球毂辘的滚在他衣袖之内。那楼上齐声发喊道：“打着个和尚了！打着个和尚了！”噫！十字街头，那些客商人等，济济哄哄，都来奔抢绣球，被行者喝一声，把牙傞一傞，把腰躬一躬，长了有三丈高，使个神威，弄出丑脸，唬得些人跌跌爬爬，不敢相近。霎时人散，行者还现了本象。那楼上绣女宫娥并大小太监，都来对唐僧下拜道：“贵人！贵人！请入朝堂贺喜。”三藏急还礼，扶起众人，回头埋怨行者道：“你这猴头，又是撮弄我也！”行者笑道：“绣球儿打在你头上，滚在你袖里，干我何事？埋怨怎么？”三藏道：“似此怎生区处？”行者道：“师父，你且放心。便入朝见驾，我回驿报与八戒沙僧等候。若是公主不招你便罢，倒换了关文就行；如必欲招你，你对国王说，召我徒弟来，我要吩咐他一声。那时召我三个入朝，我其间自能辨别真假。此是倚婚降怪之计。”唐僧无已从言，行者转身回驿。</p>

<p>那长老被众宫娥等撮拥至楼前。公主下楼，玉手相搀，同登宝辇，摆开仪从，回转朝门。早有黄门官先奏道：“万岁，公主娘娘搀着一个和尚，想是绣球打着，现在午门外候旨。”那国王见说，心甚不喜，意欲赶退，又不知公主之意何如，只得含情宣入。公主与唐僧遂至金銮殿下，正是一对夫妻呼万岁，两门邪正拜千秋。礼毕，又宣至殿上，开言问道：“僧人何来，遇朕女抛球得中？”唐僧俯伏奏道：“贫僧乃南赡部洲大唐皇帝差往西天大雷音寺拜佛求经的，因有长路关文，特来朝王倒换。路过十字街彩楼之下，不期公主娘娘抛绣球，打在贫僧头上。贫僧是出家异教之人，怎敢与玉叶金枝为偶！万望赦贫僧死罪，倒换关文，打发早赴灵山，见佛求经，回我国土，永注陛下之天恩也！”国王道：“你乃东土圣僧，正是千里姻缘使线牵。寡人公主，今登二十岁未婚，因择今日年月日时俱利，所以结彩楼抛绣球，以求佳偶。可可的你来抛着，朕虽不喜，却不知公主之意如何。”那公主叩头道：“父王，常言嫁鸡逐鸡，嫁犬逐犬。女有誓愿在先，结了这球，告奏天地神明，撞天婚抛打。今日打着圣僧，即是前世之缘，遂得今生之遇，岂敢更移！愿招他为驸马。”</p>

<p>国王方喜，即宣钦天监正台官选择日期，一壁厢收拾妆奁，又出旨晓谕天下。三藏闻言，更不谢恩，只教“放赦！放赦！”国王道：“这和尚甚不通理。朕以一国之富，招你做驸马，为何不在此停用，念念只要取经！再若推辞，教锦衣官校推出斩了！”长老唬得魂不附体，只得战兢兢叩头启奏道：“感蒙陛下天恩，但贫僧一行四众，还有三个徒弟在外，今当领纳，只是不曾吩咐得一言，万望召他到此，倒换关文，教他早去，不误了西来之意。”国王遂准奏道：“你徒弟在何处？”三藏道：“都在会同馆驿。”随即差官召圣僧徒弟领关文西去，留圣僧在此为驸马，长老只得起身侍立。有诗为证：大丹不漏要三全，苦行难成恨恶缘。道在圣传修在己，善由人积福由天。休逞六根多贪欲，顿开一性本来原。无爱无思自清净，管教解脱得超然。当时差官至会同馆驿，宣召唐僧徒弟不题。</p>

<p>却说行者自彩楼下别了唐僧，走两步，笑两声，喜喜欢欢的回驿。八戒沙僧迎着道：“哥哥，你怎么那般喜笑？师父如何不见？”行者道：“师父喜了。”八戒道：“还未到地头，又不曾见佛取得经回，是何来之喜？”行者笑道：“我与师父只走至十字街彩楼之下，可可的被当朝公主抛绣球打中了师父，师父被些宫娥、彩女、太监推拥至楼前，同公主坐辇入朝，招为驸马，此非喜而何？”八戒听说，跌脚捶胸道：“早知我去好来！都是那沙僧惫懒！你不阻我啊，我径奔彩楼之下，一绣球打着我老猪，那公主招了我，却不美哉，妙哉！俊刮标致，停当，大家造化耍子儿，何等有趣！”沙僧上前，把他脸上一抹道：“不羞！不羞！好个嘴巴骨子！三钱银子买了老驴，自夸骑得！要是一绣球打着你，就连夜烧退送纸也还道迟了，敢惹你这晦气进门！”八戒道：“你这黑子不知趣！丑自丑，还有些风味。自古道，皮肉粗糙，骨格坚强，各有一得可取。”行者道：“呆子莫胡谈！且收拾行李。但恐师父着了急，来叫我们，却好进朝保护他。”八戒道：</p>

<p>“哥哥又说差了。师父做了驸马，到宫中与皇帝的女儿交欢，又不是爬山蹱路，遇怪逢魔，要你保护他怎的！他那样一把子年纪，岂不知被窝里之事，要你去扶揝？”行者一把揪住耳朵，轮拳骂道：“你这个淫心不断的夯货！说那甚胡话！”正吵闹间，只见驿丞来报道：“圣上有旨，差官来请三位神僧。”八戒道：“端的请我们为何？”驿丞道：“老神僧幸遇公主娘娘，打中绣球，招为驸马，故此差官来请。”行者道：“差官在那里？教他进来。”那官看行者施礼。礼毕，不敢仰视，只管暗念诵道：“是鬼，是怪？</p>

<p>是雷公，夜叉？”行者道：“那官儿，有话不说，为何沉吟？”那官儿慌得战战兢兢的，双手举着圣旨，口里乱道：“我公主有请会亲，我主公会亲有请！”八戒道：“我这里没刑具，不打你，你慢慢说，不要怕。”行者道：“莫成道怕你打？怕你那脸哩！快收拾挑担牵马进朝，见师父议事去也！”这正是：路逢狭道难回避，定教恩爱反为仇。毕竟不知见了国王有何话说，且听下回分解。</p>
