<P>On the Mountain of Infinite Longevity a Great Immortal Entertains an Old Friend</P>
<P>In the Wuzhuang Temple Monkey Steals Manfruit</P>
	</div>



<P>The three of them went into the wood and saw the idiot tied up under a tree, yelling and howling in unbearable pain. Monkey went over to him and said with a laugh, &#8220;What a son-in-law! So late, and you still haven't got up to thank your mother-in-law or come to tell the good news to the master. Why are you still playing around here? Where's your mother-in-law? Where's your wife? You make a fine, strapped-up, well-beaten son-in-law!&#8221;</P>
<P>The blockhead, burning with humiliation at being thus mocked, gritted his teeth to stop himself howling in his agony. Friar Sand was overcome with pity when he saw him, and putting down the luggage he went over and untied him. The idiot kowtowed to him in gratitude. He was suffering terrible remorse. There is a poem to the tune<I> The Moon in the West River to</I> prove it:</P>


<P>Sex is a sword that wounds the body;</P>
<P>Whoever lusts for it will suffer.</P>
<P>A pretty girl of sixteen</P>
<P>Is far more dangerous than a yaksha demon.</P>


<P>There is only one Origin,</P>
<P>And there are no extra profits to staff in the sack.</P>
<P>Better store all your capital away,</P>
<P>Guard it well, and don't squander it.</P>


<P>Pig used a pinch of earth to represent burning incense and bowed in worship to Heaven.</P>
<P>&#8220;Did you recognize the Bodhisattva?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I was lying here in a faint and my eyes were seeing stars, so I couldn't tell who it was.&#8221; Monkey handed him the piece of paper, and when he saw the divine message, Pig was more ashamed than ever.</P>
<P>&#8220;You're very lucky,&#8221; said Friar Sand with a laugh, &#8220;you've got four Bodhisattvas as your relations now.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please don't talk about it,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;I really don't deserve to be human. I'll never misbehave again in future, and I even if the effort breaks my bones, I'll rub my shoulder and carry our master's luggage to the West.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's more like it,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>Monkey then led his master along the main road. After they had been going for a long time, walking and resting, they saw a high mountain blocking their way. &#8220;Disciples,&#8221; said Sanzang as he reined in the horse and stopped giving it the whip, &#8220;we must be very careful on that mountain. I'm afraid there may be fiends and demons on it who will attack us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;With us three followers,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you needn't fear demons.&#8221; Sanzang, his worries ended, pressed forward. The mountain was certainly a fine one:</P>


<P>The mountain was very high</P>
<P>And craggy was its majesty.</P>
<P>Its roots joined the Kunlun range,</P>
<P>Its summit touched the Milky Way.</P>
<P>White crane came to perch in its locust and cypress trees,</P>
<P>Dark apes hung upside-down from its creepers.</P>
<P>When the sun shone bright on its forests,</P>
<P>It was enveloped in red haze;</P>
<P>When winds sprang from dark valleys,</P>
<P>Coloured clouds scudded across the sky.</P>
<P>Hidden birds called in the green bamboo,</P>
<P>Pheasants fought among the wild flowers.</P>
<P>Thousand-year peaks,</P>
<P>Five-blessing peaks,</P>
<P>Lotus peaks,</P>
<P>Majestically reflecting a delicate light;</P>
<P>Ten thousand year rocks,</P>
<P>Tiger-tooth rocks,</P>
<P>Three Heavens rocks,</P>
<P>Wreathed in subtle and auspicious vapours.</P>
<P>Luxuriant grass in front of the cliff,</P>
<P>The scent of plum blossom on the ridge.</P>
<P>Dense grew the jungle of thorns,</P>
<P>Pure and pale were the orchids.</P>
<P>Deep in the woods the birds gathered round the phoenix;</P>
<P>In an ancient cave a unicorn was chief of the animals.</P>
<P>A delightful stream in a gully</P>
<P>Twisted and turned as it wandered around;</P>
<P>Endless peaks</P>
<P>Coiled about in layer upon layer.</P>
<P>Then there were the green locust trees,</P>
<P>Mottled bamboo,</P>
<P>And bluish pines,</P>
<P>That had been competing in splendour for a thousand years.</P>
<P>White plum blossom,</P>
<P>Red peach,</P>
<P>And emerald willows</P>
<P>Were brilliant as they vied in beauty during spring.</P>
<P>Dragons called and tigers roared,</P>
<P>Cranes danced and apes howled.</P>
<P>Deer emerged from the flowers,</P>
<P>Pheasants sang to the sun.</P>
<P>This was a land of blessing, an Immortals' mountain,</P>
<P>Just like Penglai or Langyuan.</P>
<P>Flowers opened and withered on the mountain top,</P>
<P>Clouds came and went above the peaks along the ridge.</P>


<P>&#8220;Disciples,&#8221; said Sanzang with delight as he sat on his horse, &#8220;I've crossed many mountains on my journey West, and they were all steep and rocky, but none of them could be compared to the extraordinarily beautiful scenery here. If this isn't far from the Thunder Monastery, we had better put ourselves in a solemn and reverent mood to meet the Buddha.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's early days yet,&#8221; said Monkey with a laugh. &#8220;That's not an easy place to get to.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How far are we from Thunder Monastery, elder brother?&#8221; asked Friar Sand.</P>
<P>&#8220;Thirty-six thousand miles,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and we haven't covered a tenth of it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How many years will it take us to get there?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;You two younger brothers of mine could manage it in ten days or so, and I could go there fifty times over in a single day and still be back before sunset. But for our master it doesn't bear thinking about.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Tell me, Monkey! how long will it take?&#8221; asked Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you went from childhood to old age,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;and from old age back to childhood again, and you did it a thousand times over, you'd still find it hard to get there. But if you see your true nature, are determined to be sincere, and always remember to turn your head back to enlightenment, then you will have reached Vulture Peak.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Even if this isn't the Thunder Monastery,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;good people must live amid such fine scenery as this.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Quite right,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;there couldn't be any evil creatures here. This must be the home of holy monks or Immortals. Let's look around here and take our time over it.&#8221;</P>
<P>This mountain was called the Mountain of Infinite Longevity, and there was a Taoist temple on it called the Wuzhuang Temple. In this temple lived an Immortal whose Taoist name was Zhen Yuan Zi. He was also known as Conjoint Lord of the Age. The temple had a rare treasure, a miraculous tree that had been formed when primeval chaos was first being divided, before the separation of Heaven and Earth. In the four great continents of the world, only the Western Continent of Cattle-gift's Wuzhuang Temple had this treasure that was known as &#8220;Grass-returning Cinnabar&#8221; or &#8220;manfruit.&#8221; It took three thousand years to blossom, three thousand years to form the fruit, and another three thousand years for the fruit to ripen, so that very nearly ten thousand years had to pass before the fruit could be eaten. Only thirty fruit were formed each ten thousand years, and they were shaped just like a newborn baby, complete with limbs and sense organs. Anyone whose destiny permitted him to smell one would live for three hundred and sixty years, and if you ate one you would live for forty-seven thousand years.</P>
<P>That day the Great Immortal Zhen Yuan had received an invitation from the Original Celestial Jade Pure One inviting him to the Miluo Palace in the Heaven of Supreme Purity to hear a lecture on the Product of Undifferentiated Unity. The Immortals who had studied under this great Immortal were too numerous to count, and he now had forty-eight disciples who had all attained to the full truth of the Way. That day, the Great Immortal took forty-six of them with him to hear the lecture in the upper world, leaving the two youngest, Pure Wind and Bright Moon, to look after the temple. Pure Wind was 1,320 years old, and Bright Moon had just turned 1,200.</P>
<P>The Great Immortal gave his instructions to the two boys: &#8220;As I must obey the summons of the Original Celestial Jade Pure One and go to the Miluo Palace to hear a lecture, you two will have to look after the temple carefully. An old friend of mine will be coming this way before long, and you must entertain him very well indeed. You can pick two manfruits for him as a token of our old friendship.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Who is this old friend of yours, master?&#8221; the boys asked. &#8220;Please tell us who he is so that we can entertain him properly.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He is a priest sent by the Tang Emperor in the East,&#8221; the Great Immortal replied, &#8220;and he is known as Sanzang. He is the monk going to worship the Buddha and ask for the scriptures in the Western Heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Confucius said, 'Don't have anything to do with people of a different way,'&#8220; replied the boys with smiles. &#8220;Ours is the esoteric sect of the Great Monad, so why ever are you friends with that Buddhist monk?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You are not aware,&#8221; the Great Immortal replied, &#8220;that he is a reincarnation of the Golden Cicada, the second disciple of the Tathagata Buddha, that ancient sage of the West. I made his acquaintance at an Ullambana assembly where he gave me tea with his own hands. As this disciple of the Buddha paid me such an honour, I regard him as an old friend.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the two Immortal boys heard this, they accepted their master's orders. Just as he was on the point of setting out, the Great Immortal gave them some more instructions: &#8220;There are a limited number of those manfruits. You must only give two, and not one more.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When the garden was opened we all shared two,&#8221; said the boys, &#8220;and there are twenty-eight now left on the tree. We won't use more than two.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Although the Tang Priest is an old friend of mine,&#8221; said the Great Immortal, &#8220;you must be on your guard against his ruffian followers, and you mustn't let them know about the manfruit.&#8221; The Great Immortal then flew up to Heaven with the rest of his disciples.</P>
<P>The Tang Priest and his three followers, meanwhile, were enjoying themselves strolling on the mountain when they noticed some tall buildings rising above a bamboo grove. &#8220;What do you think that is?&#8221; Sanzang asked Monkey, who replied, &#8220;It's either a Taoist temple or a Buddhist one. Let's go over and find out.&#8221; It did not take them long to reach the gate, and they saw</P>


<P>A cool pine-covered slope,</P>
<P>A tranquil path through the bamboo.</P>
<P>White cranes brought floating clouds,</P>
<P>Monkeys and apes offered fruit.</P>
<P>Before the gate was a wide pool, and the shadows of the trees were long;</P>
<P>In the cracks of the rocks grew moss.</P>
<P>Many a purple hall was massed together;</P>
<P>A red aura enveloped the lofty towers.</P>
<P>It certainly was a blessed place,</P>
<P>A cloud cave on Penglai.</P>
<P>In its pure emptiness little happened;</P>
<P>Its stillness gave birth to thoughts of the Way.</P>
<P>Green birds often brought letters from the Queen Mother;</P>
<P>Purple pheasants carried the classics of Lord Lao Zi.</P>
<P>There was a majestic air of the Way and its Power&#8212;</P>
<P>It was indeed a divine Immortal's home.</P>


<P>Sanzang dismounted and saw that there was a stone tablet outside the gate on which was inscribed in large letters:</P>


<P>BLESSED LAND OF THE MOUNTAIN OF INFINITE LONGEVITY</P>
<P>CAVE HEAVEN OF THE WUZHUANG TEMPLE</P>


<P>&#8220;You were right,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;it is a Taoist temple.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Good people must live in this temple,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;set as it is in such fresh, light scenery. Let's go in and have a look round. When we go back to the East at the end of our journey, this will be one of the finest sights we'll have seen.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Well spoken,&#8221; said Monkey, and they all went in. On the next gate was pasted the couplet:</P>
<P>&#8220;Residence of Divine Immortals Who Never Grow Old;</P>
<P>Home of Taoists as Ancient as Heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This Taoist tries to intimidate people by talking big,&#8221; said Monkey with a laugh. &#8220;When I wrecked the Heavenly Palace five hundred years ago I never saw anything like that over the gate of the Supreme Lord Lao Zi.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Never mind him,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;Let's go in. This Taoist may well be quite a decent bloke.&#8221;</P>
<P>As they went through the second gate they saw two boys come scurrying out. This is what they looked like:</P>


<P>Pure bones, lively spirits, pretty faces,</P>
<P>And hair tied in childish tufts.</P>
<P>Their Taoist robes naturally wreathed in mist,</P>
<P>The sleeves of their feather clothes were floating in the wind.</P>


<P>Their jade belts were tied with dragon-head knots,</P>
<P>Their grass sandals lightly fastened with silk.</P>
<P>In their elegance they were unlike common mortals&#8212;</P>
<P>The Taoist boys Pure Wind and Bright Moon.</P>


<P>The two boys bowed and came out to greet them. &#8220;We are sorry we did not welcome you properly, venerable master,&#8221; they said. &#8220;Please sit down.&#8221; Sanzang was delighted, and he accompanied the two boys up to the main hall of the temple, which faced South. There was a patterned lattice window that let through the light on top of the door that the boys pushed open. They asked the Tang Priest to come in, and he saw two huge words executed in many colours hanging on the wall&#8212;Heaven and Earth. There was an incense table of red carved lacquer on which stood a pair of golden censers and a supply of incense.</P>
<P>Sanzang went over to the table and put a pinch of incense in the censers with his left hand while performing triple reverences. Then he turned round to the boys and said, &#8220;This temple is a home of Immortals in the Western Continent, so why don't you worship the Three Pure Ones, the Four Emperors, and all the ministers of Heaven? Why do you burn incense to the two words 'Heaven' and 'Earth?'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;To be frank with you, venerable teacher,&#8221; the boys replied with smiles, &#8220;it's quite right to worship the top word, 'Heaven,' but the bottom one, 'Earth,' gets no incense from us. Our teacher only put them up to ingratiate himself.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How does he ingratiate himself?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The Three Pure Ones and the Four Emperors are our teacher's friends,&#8221; the boys replied, &#8220;the Nine Bright Shiners are his juniors, and the Constellations are his underlings.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he collapsed with laughter, and Pig asked him, &#8220;What are you laughing at?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They say that I get up to no good, but these Taoist boys really tell whoppers.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where is your teacher?&#8221; Sanzang asked them.</P>
<P>&#8220;He had an invitation from the Original Celestial Jade Pure One and has gone to the Palace in the Heaven of Supreme Purity to hear a lecture on the Product of Undifferentiated Unity, so he's not at home.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this Monkey could not help roaring, &#8220;Stinking Taoist boys, you don't know who you're talking to. You play your dirty tricks in front of our faces and pretend to be oh-so-innocent. What Heavenly Immortal of the Great Monad lives in the Miluo Palace? Who invited your cow's hoof of a master to a lecture?&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang was worried that now he had lost his temper the boys would answer back and spark off a disastrous fight, so he said, &#8220;Don't quarrel with them, Wukong. We'll be going in a minute, so we obviously need have nothing to do with them. Besides, as the saying goes, 'egrets don't eat egret flesh'. Their master isn't here anyway, so there would be no point in wrecking the place. Go and graze the horse outside the gate. Friar Sand, you look after the luggage, and tell Pig to take some rice from our bundles and use their kitchen to make our meal. When we go we shall give them a few coppers for the firewood. All do as I've told you and leave me here to rest. When we have eaten we shall be on our way again.&#8221; The three of them went off to do their jobs.</P>
<P>Bright Moon and Pure Wind were meanwhile quietly praising Sanzang to each other: &#8220;What a splendid monk. He is indeed the beloved sage of the West in mortal form, and his true nature is not at all befuddled. The master told us to entertain him and give him some manfruit as a token of their old friendship, and he also warned us to be on our guard against those hooligans of his. They have murderous-looking faces and coarse natures. Thank goodness he sent them away, because if they were still with him, we wouldn't be able to give him the manfruit.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We don't yet know whether this monk is our master's old friend or not,&#8221; said Pure Wind. &#8220;We'd better ask him to make sure.&#8221; The two of them then went over to Sanzang and said, &#8220;May we ask you, venerable master, whether you are the Sanzang of the Great Tang who is going to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, I am,&#8221; said Sanzang, returning their bows. &#8220;How did you know who I was?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Our master told us before he went,&#8221; they replied, &#8220;to go out to meet you long before you got here, but as you came faster than we expected we failed to do so. Please sit down, teacher, while we fetch you some tea.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am honoured,&#8221; said Sanzang. Bright Moon hurried out and came back with a cup of fragrant tea for him.</P>
<P>When Sanzang had drunk the tea, Pure Wind said to Bright Moon, &#8220;We must do as our teacher told us and fetch the fruit.&#8221;</P>
<P>The two boys left Sanzang and went to their room, where one of them picked up a golden rod and the other a red dish, on which he put many a silk handkerchief as cushioning. They went into the manfruit orchard, where Pure Wind climbed the tree and tapped the fruit with the golden rod while Bright Moon waited below to catch them in the dish.</P>
<P>They only took a few moments to knock down and catch a couple, which they took to the front hall to offer to Sanzang with the words, &#8220;This temple of ours is on a remote and desolate mountain, master Sanzang, and there is no local delicacy we can offer you except these two pieces of fruit. We hope they will quench your thirst.&#8221;</P>
<P>At the sight of the manfruit the monk recoiled some three feet, shaking with horror. &#8220;Goodness me!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;How could you be so reduced to starvation in this year of plenty as to eat human flesh? And how could I possibly quench my thirst with a newborn baby?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This monk has developed eyes of flesh and a mortal body in the battlefield of mouths and tongues and the sea of disputation,&#8221; thought Pure Wind, &#8220;and he can't recognize the treasures of this home of Immortals.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Venerable master,&#8221; said Bright Moon, &#8220;this is what is called 'manfruit,' and there is no reason why you should not eat one.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Nonsense, nonsense,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;They were conceived by their fathers and mothers and had to go through no end of suffering before they were born. How can you treat them as fruit when they haven't been alive for three days yet?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They really and truly grew on a tree,&#8221; said Pure Wind.</P>
<P>&#8220;Stuff and rubbish,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;Babies don't grow on trees. Take them away, you inhuman beasts.&#8221;</P>
<P>As he refused absolutely to eat them, the two boys had to take the dish away and go back to their room. This fruit was rather difficult to handle, and did not keep for long without becoming hard and inedible, so the boys sat on their beds and ate one each.</P>
<P>Oh dear! What a thing to happen! There was only a wall separating their room from the kitchen, where their whispering could be clearly heard. Pig was in there cooking the rice when he heard them talk as they fetched the golden rod and the red dish. Later he heard them saying that the Tang Priest had not recognized the manfruit, which was why they took them back to their room to eat.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'd love to try one, but I don't know how,&#8221; thought Pig, unable to prevent his mouth from watering. Too stupid to do anything about it himself, he had to wait until he could talk it over with Brother Monkey. He had now lost all interest in stoking the stove as he stood in front of it, constantly poking his head outside the kitchen to look for Monkey. Before long Monkey appeared leading the horse, which he tethered to a locust tree. As he came round to the back, the blockhead waved frantically to him and said, &#8220;Come here, come here.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey turned round, came to the kitchen door, and said, &#8220;What are you yelling for, idiot? Not enough food for you? Let the old monk eat his fill, then we two can go to the next big house that lies ahead and beg for some more.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;it's not that. Do you know that there's a treasure in this temple?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What treasure?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I can't describe it because you've never seen it,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;and if I gave it to you, you wouldn't know what it was.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't try to make a fool of me, idiot,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;When I studied the Way of Immortality five hundred years ago I traveled on my cloud to the comers of the ocean and the edge of the sky. I've seen everything.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Have you seen manfruit then?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;No, I haven't,&#8221; said Monkey with astonishment. &#8220;But I've heard that manfruit is Grass-returning Cinnabar, and that anyone who eats it lives to a great old age. Where can we get some?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Here,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;Those boys gave two to our master, but that old monk didn't know what they were and thought they were newborn babies. He wouldn't eat them. Those boys are disgraceful&#8212;instead of giving them to us as they should have done they sneaked off into their room and had one each, gobble, gobble, gobble&#8212;I was drooling. I wish I knew how I could try one. Surely you've got some dodge for getting into the orchard and pinching a few for us to taste. You have, haven't you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Easy,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'll go in and pick some.&#8221;</P>
<P>As he rushed out Pig grabbed him and said, &#8220;I heard them saying in their room that they needed a golden rod to knock them down with. You must do this very carefully&#8212;nobody must know about it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I know, I know,&#8221; replied Monkey.</P>
<P>The Great Sage made himself invisible and slipped into the boys' room, only to find that after eating the fruit they had gone to the front hall, where they were talking to Sanzang. Monkey looked all around the room for the golden rod until he saw a two-foot length of gold hanging from the window lattice. It was about as thick as a finger. At the bottom was a lump like a bulb of garlic, and at the top was a hole through which was fastened a green silk tassel. &#8220;So this must be what they call the golden rod,&#8221; he thought as he took it down. He left the room and pushed open a pair of gates at the back. Goodness! He saw a garden</P>


<P>With red, jeweled balconies</P>
<P>And a twisting artificial hill.</P>
<P>Rare flowers try to outshine the sun,</P>
<P>The bamboo attempts to be bluer than the sky.</P>
<P>Outside the Floating Cup Pavilion</P>
<P>A curve of willows hangs like mist;</P>
<P>Before the Platform to Admire the Moon</P>
<P>Clumps of lofty pines make splashes of indigo.</P>
<P>Bright, bright red,</P>
<P>The pomegranate thicket;</P>
<P>Deep, deep green,</P>
<P>The cushions of grass.</P>
<P>Richly blue</P>
<P>Were the jade-coloured orchids;</P>
<P>Rushing and powerful</P>
<P>The water in the stream.</P>
<P>Crimson cassia blazed beside golden wells and wutong trees.</P>
<P>Brocade-rich locust trees flanked red balconies and steps.</P>
<P>There was peach blossom in pink and white,</P>
<P>Yellow and fragrant chrysanthemums that have seen nine autumns.</P>
<P>Trellises of raspberries</P>
<P>Flourish by the peony pavilion;</P>
<P>Banks of hibiscus</P>
<P>Lead to beds of tree-peonies.</P>
<P>There is no end of noble bamboos that have held out against frost.</P>
<P>Or lordly pines that defy the snows.</P>
<P>Then there are nests of cranes and houses for deer,</P>
<P>Square ponds and round pools,</P>
<P>Spring water like fragments of jade,</P>
<P>Golden heaps of flowers.</P>
<P>The North wind bursts the white plum blossom open.</P>
<P>When spring comes, it touches the crab-apple with red.</P>
<P>It can be rightly called the most splendid view on Earth,</P>
<P>The finest garden in the West.</P>


<P>Before Monkey had time to take all of this in he saw another gate. When he pushed it open he saw</P>


<P>Vegetables for each of the four seasons&#8212;</P>
<P>Spinach, celery, beetroot, ginger, and kelp,</P>
<P>Bamboo shoots, sweet potato, melons, oblong gourd and wild rice stem,</P>
<P>Onions, garlic, coriander, scallion and shallots,</P>
<P>Lettuce, artemisia, and bitter alisma,</P>
<P>Gourds and aubergines that must be planted,</P>
<P>Rutabaga, turnips, docks,</P>
<P>Red amaranth, green cabbage, and purple mustard-plant.</P>


<P>&#8220;So they're Taoists who grow their own food,&#8221; thought Monkey, smiling to himself. When he had crossed the vegetable garden he saw yet another gate, and when he opened it there was a huge tree in front of him with fragrant branches and shade-giving green leaves shaped rather like those of plantains. The tree was about a thousand feet high, and its trunk was some seventy or eighty feet round. Monkey leant against it and looked up, and on a branch that was pointing South he saw a manfruit, which really did look just like a newborn child. The stem came from its bottom, and as it hung from the branch its hands and feet waved wildly around and it shook its head. Monkey was thoroughly delighted, and he thought in admiration, &#8220;What a splendid thing&#8212;a real rarity, a real rarity.&#8221; And with that thought he went shooting up the tree.</P>
<P>Now there is nothing that monkeys are better at than climbing trees to steal fruit, and one blow from the golden rod sent the manfruit tumbling down. He jumped down to fetch it, but it was nowhere to be seen. He searched the grass all around, but could find not a trace of it. &#8220;That's odd,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;very odd indeed. It must be able to use its feet&#8212;but even then it won't be able to get past the wall. No, I've got it. The local deity of this garden has hidden it away to stop me stealing it.&#8221;</P>
<P>He made some finger magic and uttered the sacred sound &#8220;<I>Om</I>,&#8221; which forced the garden deity to come forward, bow and say, &#8220;You summoned me, Great Sage. What are your orders?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Surely you know,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;that I am the most famous criminal on earth. When I stole the sacred peaches, the imperial wine, and the elixir of immortality some years ago, nobody dared to try and take a cut. How comes it that when I take some fruit today you pinch my very first one? This fruit grows on a tree, and the birds of the air must have their share of it, so what harm will be done if I eat one? Why did you snatch it the moment it fell down?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; the deity replied, &#8220;don't be angry with me. These treasures belong to the Immortals of the Earth, and I am a ghost Immortal, so I would never dare take one. I've never even had the good fortune to smell one.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you didn't take it, why did it disappear the moment I knocked it down from the tree?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;You may know that these treasures give eternal life, Great Sage,&#8221; the deity replied, &#8220;but you don't know about their origin.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where do they come from, then?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;These treasures,&#8221; the deity replied, &#8220;take three thousand years to blossom, another three thousand to form, and three thousand more to ripen. In almost ten thousand years only thirty grow. Anyone lucky enough to smell one will live for three hundred and sixty years, and if you eat one you will live to be forty-seven thousand. These fruit fear only the Five Elements.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean, 'fear only the Five Elements?'&#8220; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;If they meet metal,&#8221; the deity said, &#8220;they fall; if they meet wood they rot; if they meet water they dissolve; if they meet fire they are burnt; and if they meet earth they go into it. If you tap them you have to use a golden rod, otherwise they won't drop; and when you knock them down you must catch them in a bowl padded with silk handkerchiefs. If they come in contact with wooden utensils they rot, and even if you eat one it won't make you live any longer. When you eat them you must do so off porcelain, and they should be cooked in clear water. If they come in contact with fire they become charred and useless, and they go into any earth they touch. When you knocked one to the ground just now it went straight in, and as the earth here will now live for forty-seven thousand years you wouldn't be able to make any impression on it even with a steel drill: it's much harder than wrought iron. But if a man eats one he wins long life. Try hitting the ground if you don't believe me.&#8221; Monkey raised his gold-ringed cudgel and brought it down on the ground. There was a loud noise as the cudgel sprang back. The ground was unmarked.</P>
<P>&#8220;So you're right,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you're right. This cudgel of mine can smash rocks to powder and even leave its mark on wrought iron, but this time it did no damage at all. This means that I was wrong to blame you. You may go back now.&#8221; At this the local deity went back to his shrine.</P>
<P>The Great Sage now had a plan. He climbed the tree and then held the rod in one hand while he undid the lapel of his cloth tunic and made it into a kind of pouch. He pushed the leaves and branches aside and knocked down three manfruits, which he caught in his tunic. He jumped out of the tree and went straight to the kitchen, where a smiling Pig asked him if he had got any. &#8220;This is the stuff, isn't it?&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I was able to get some. We mustn't leave Friar Sand in the dark, so give him a shout.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Come here, Friar Sand,&#8221; Pig called, waving his hand. Friar Sand put the luggage down, hurried into the kitchen, and asked, &#8220;Why did you call me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do you know what these are?&#8221; Monkey asked, opening his tunic. &#8220;Manfruits,&#8221; said Friar Sand as soon as he saw them. &#8220;Good,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you know what they are. Where have you eaten them?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've never eaten them,&#8221; Friar Sand replied, &#8220;but when I was the Curtain-lifting General in the old days I used to escort the imperial carriage to the Peach Banquets, and I saw some that Immortals from over the seas brought as birthday presents for the Queen Mother. I've certainly seen them, but I've never tasted one. Please give me a bit to try.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No need to ask,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;We're having one each.&#8221;</P>
<P>So each of them had one manfruit to eat. Pig had both an enormous appetite and an enormous mouth, and had, moreover, been suffering pangs of hunger ever since hearing the Taoist boys eating. So the moment he saw the fruit he grabbed one, opened his mouth, and gulped it down whole; then he put on an innocent expression and shamelessly asked the other two what they were eating. &#8220;Manfruit,&#8221; Friar Sand replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;What does it taste like?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Ignore him, Friar Sand,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;He's already eaten his, and he's no business to ask you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;I ate mine too fast. I didn't nibble it delicately and taste the flavour like you two. I don't even know if it had a stone or not as I gulped it straight down. You should finish what you've started: you've whetted my appetite, so you ought to get me another to eat slowly.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're never satisfied,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;These things aren't like rice or flour&#8212;you can't go stuffing yourself full of them. Only thirty grow in every ten thousand years, so we can think ourselves very lucky indeed to have a whole one each. Come off it, Pig, you've had enough.&#8221; He got up, slipped into the Taoist boys' room with the golden rod, and put it back without letting himself be seen through the window. He paid no more attention to Pig, who went on grumbling.</P>
<P>Before long the Taoist boys were back in their room, and they heard Pig moaning, &#8220;I didn't enjoy my manfruit; I wish I could have another.&#8221; Pure Wind's suspicion were aroused, and he said to Bright Moon, &#8220;Did you hear that long-snouted monk saying he wished he could have another manfruit? Our master told us when he went that we were to be careful of those gangsters and not let them steal our treasures.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is terrible, terrible,&#8221; said Bright Moon. &#8220;What's the golden rod doing on the floor? We'd better go into the garden and take a look around.&#8221; The two of them hurried out and found the garden gates open.</P>
<P>&#8220;We shut this gate,&#8221; said Pure Wind, &#8220;so why is it open?&#8221; They rushed round the flower garden, found the vegetable garden gate open too, and tore into the manfruit garden. They leant on the tree and looked up into it to count the fruit, but however often they added the number up, it always came to twenty-two.</P>
<P>&#8220;Can you do arithmetic?&#8221; Bright Moon asked, and Pure Wind replied, &#8220;Yes. Tell me the figures.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There were originally thirty manfruits,&#8221; said Bright Moon. &#8220;When our master opened the garden two were divided up and eaten, which left twenty-eight. Just now we knocked two down to give the Tang Priest, which left twenty-six. But there are only twenty-two now, which means that we're four short. It goes without saying that those bad men must have stolen them. Let's go and tell that Tang Priest what we think of him.&#8221;</P>
<P>The two of them went from the garden to the front hall, where they pointed at Sanzang and poured the most filthy and stinking abuse on him, calling him &#8220;baldy&#8221; this and &#8220;baldy&#8221; that. It was more than Sanzang could stand, so he said, &#8220;What are you making all this fuss about, Immortal boys? Please stop. I wouldn't mind you being a bit offhand with me, but you can't talk in this outrageous way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Are you deaf?&#8221; Pure Wind asked. &#8220;We're not talking a foreign language, and you can understand us perfectly well. You've stolen our manfruit, and you've no right to forbid us to mention it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What does manfruit look like?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's what we offered you just now and you said looked like babies.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Amitabha Buddha!&#8221; Sanzang exclaimed. &#8220;I shook with terror at the very sight of them&#8212;I couldn't possibly steal one. Even if I were being racked by the most terrible greed, I could never commit the crime of eating one of those. What do you mean by making so unjust an accusation?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Although you didn't eat any,&#8221; said Pure Wind, &#8220;those underlings of yours stole and ate some.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Even if they did, you shouldn't shout like that. Wait till I've questioned them. If they stole some, I'll see that they make it up to you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Make it up?&#8221; said Bright Moon. &#8220;They are things that money can't buy.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Well then,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;if money won't buy them, 'decent behavior is worth a thousand pieces of gold,' as the saying goes. I'll make them apologize to you, and that will be that. Besides, we still don't know whether they did it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Of course they did,&#8221; retorted Bright Moon. &#8220;They're still quarrelling in there because they were divided unfairly.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Come here, disciples,&#8221; called Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;We've had it,&#8221; said Friar Sand when he heard Sanzang calling. &#8220;The game's up. Our master is calling us and the young Taoists are swearing and cursing. The cat must be out of the bag.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How disgraceful,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;all that fuss about some food. But if we confess it, they'll say it was stealing food; the best thing is not to admit it at all.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Quite right, quite right, we'll cover it up,&#8221; said Pig, and three of them went from the kitchen to the hall.</P>
<P>If you don't know how they denied it, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>万寿山大仙留故友</p>
<p>五庄观行者窃人参</p>
</div>
<p>却说那三人穿林入里，只见那呆子绷在树上，声声叫喊，痛苦难禁。行者上前笑道：“好女婿呀！这早晚还不起来谢亲，又不到师父处报喜，还在这里卖解儿耍子哩！咄！你娘呢？你老婆呢？好个绷巴吊拷的女婿呀！”那呆子见他来抢白着羞，咬着牙，忍着疼，不敢叫喊。沙僧见了老大不忍，放下行李，上前解了绳索救下。呆子对他们只是磕头礼拜，其实羞耻难当，有《西江月》为证：色乃伤身之剑，贪之必定遭殃。佳人二八好容妆，更比夜叉凶壮。只有一个原本，再无微利添囊。好将资本谨收藏，坚守休教放荡。那八戒撮土焚香，望空礼拜。行者道：</p>

<p>“你可认得那些菩萨么？”八戒道：“我已此晕倒昏迷，眼花撩乱，那认得是谁？”行者把那简帖儿递与八戒，八戒见了是颂子，更加惭愧。沙僧笑道：“二哥有这般好处哩，感得四位菩萨来与你做亲！”八戒道：“兄弟再莫题起，不当人子了！从今后，再也不敢妄为。就是累折骨头，也只是摩肩压担，随师父西域去也。”三藏道：“既如此说才是。”</p>

<p>行者遂领师父上了大路。在路餐风宿水，行罢多时，忽见有高山挡路，三藏勒马停鞭道：“徒弟，前面一山，必须仔细，恐有妖魔作耗，侵害吾党。”行者道：“马前但有我等三人，怕甚妖魔？”因此，长老安心前进。只见那座山，真是好山：高山峻极，大势峥嵘。根接昆仑脉，顶摩霄汉中。白鹤每来栖桧柏，玄猿时复挂藤萝。日映晴林，迭迭千条红雾绕；风生阴壑，飘飘万道彩云飞。幽鸟乱啼青竹里，锦鸡齐斗野花间。只见那千年峰、五福峰、芙蓉峰，巍巍凛凛放毫光；万岁石、虎牙石、三尖石，突突磷磷生瑞气。崖前草秀，岭上梅香。荆棘密森森，芝兰清淡淡。深林鹰凤聚千禽，古洞麒麟辖万兽。涧水有情，曲曲弯弯多绕顾；峰峦不断，重重迭迭自周回。又见那绿的槐，斑的竹，青的松，依依千载斗秾华；白的李、红的桃，翠的柳，灼灼三春争艳丽。龙吟虎啸，鹤舞猿啼。麋鹿从花出，青鸾对日鸣。乃是仙山真福地，蓬莱阆苑只如然。又见些花开花谢山头景，云去云来岭上峰。三藏在马上欢喜道：“徒弟，我一向西来，经历许多山水，都是那嵯峨险峻之处，更不似此山好景，果然的幽趣非常。若是相近雷音不远路，我们好整肃端严见世尊。”行者笑道：“早哩！早哩！正好不得到哩！”沙僧道：“师兄，我们到雷音有多少远？”行者道：“十万八千里，十停中还不曾走了一停哩。”八戒道：“哥啊，要走几年才得到？”行者道：“这些路，若论二位贤弟，便十来日也可到；若论我走，一日也好走五十遭，还见日色；若论师父走，莫想！莫想！”唐僧道：“悟空，你说得几时方可到？”行者道：“你自小时走到老，老了再小，老小千番也还难。只要你见性志诚，念念回首处，即是灵山。”沙僧道：“师兄，此间虽不是雷音，观此景致，必有个好人居止。”行者道：“此言却当。这里决无邪祟，一定是个圣僧仙辈之乡，我们游玩慢行。”不题。</p>

<p>却说这座山名唤万寿山，山中有一座观，名唤五庄观，观里有一尊仙，道号镇元子，混名与世同君。那观里出一般异宝，乃是混沌初分，鸿蒙始判，天地未开之际，产成这颗灵根。盖天下四大部洲，惟西牛贺洲五庄观出此，唤名草还丹，又名人参果。三千年一开花，三千年一结果，再三千年才得熟，短头一万年方得吃。似这万年，只结得三十个果子。果子的模样，就如三朝未满的小孩相似，四肢俱全，五官咸备。人若有缘，得那果子闻了一闻，就活三百六十岁；吃一个，就活四万七千年。</p>

<p>当日镇元大仙得元始天尊的筒帖，邀他到上清天上弥罗宫中听讲混元道果。大仙门下出的散仙，也不计其数，见如今还有四十八个徒弟，都是得道的全真。当日带领四十六个上界去听讲，留下两个绝小的看家：一个唤做清风，一个唤做明月。</p>

<p>清风只有一千三百二十岁，明月才交一千二百岁。镇元子吩咐二童道：“不可违了大天尊的简帖，要往弥罗宫听讲，你两个在家仔细。不日有一个故人从此经过，却莫怠慢了他，可将我人参果打两个与他吃，权表旧日之情。”二童道：“师父的故人是谁？望说与弟子，好接待。”大仙道：“他是东土大唐驾下的圣僧，道号三藏，今往西天拜佛求经的和尚。”二童笑道：“孔子云，道不同，不相为谋。我等是太乙玄门，怎么与那和尚做甚相识！”大仙道：“你那里得知。那和尚乃金蝉子转生，西方圣老如来佛第二个徒弟。五百年前，我与他在兰盆会上相识，他曾亲手传茶，佛子敬我，故此是为故人也。”二仙童闻言，谨遵师命。</p>

<p>那大仙临行，又叮咛嘱咐道：“我那果子有数，只许与他两个，不得多费。”清风道：“开园时，大众共吃了两个，还有二十八个在树，不敢多费。”大仙道：“唐三藏虽是故人，须要防备他手下人罗唣，不可惊动他知。”二童领命讫，那大仙承众徒弟飞升，径朝天界。</p>

<p>却说唐僧四众在山游玩，忽抬头见那松篁一簇，楼阁数层。唐僧道：“悟空，你看那里是甚么去处？”行者看了道：“那所在，不是观宇，定是寺院。我们走动些，到那厢方知端的。”不一时，来于门首观看，见那松坡冷淡，竹径清幽。往来白鹤送浮云，上下猿猴时献果。那门前池宽树影长，石裂苔花破。宫殿森罗紫极高，楼台缥缈丹霞堕。真个是福地灵区，蓬莱云洞。清虚人事少，寂静道心生。青鸟每传王母信，紫鸾常寄老君经。看不尽那巍巍道德之风，果然漠漠神仙之宅。三藏离鞍下马，又见那山门左边有一通碑，碑上有十个大字，乃是“万寿山福地，五庄观洞天”。长老道：“徒弟，真个是一座观宇。”沙僧道：“师父，观此景鲜明，观里必有好人居住。我们进去看看，若行满东回，此间也是一景。”行者道：“说得好。”遂都一齐进去，又见那二门上有一对春联：长生不老神仙府，与天同寿道人家。行者笑道：“这道士说大话唬人。我老孙五百年前大闹天宫时，在那太上老君门首，也不曾见有此话说。”八戒道：“且莫管他，进去进去，或者这道士有些德行，未可知也。”</p>

<p>及至二层门里，只见那里面急急忙忙，走出两个小童儿来。看他怎生打扮：骨清神爽容颜丽，顶结丫髻短发鬅。道服自然襟绕雾，羽衣偏是袖飘风。环绦紧束龙头结，芒履轻缠蚕口绒。丰采异常非俗辈，正是那清风明月二仙童。那童子控背躬身，出来迎接道：“老师父，失迎，请坐。”长老欢喜，遂与二童子上了正殿观看。原来是向南的五间大殿，都是上明下暗的雕花格子。那仙童推开格子，请唐僧入殿，只见那壁中间挂着五彩装成的“天地”二大字，设一张朱红雕漆的香几，几上有一副黄金炉瓶，炉边有方便整香。</p>

<p>唐僧上前，以左手拈香注炉，三匝礼拜，拜毕回头道：“仙童，你五庄观真是西方仙界，何不供养三清、四帝、罗天诸宰，只将天地二字侍奉香火？”童子笑道：“不瞒老师说，这两个字，上头的，礼上还当；下边的，还受不得我们的香火。是家师父谄佞出来的。”三藏道：“何为谄佞？”童子道：“三清是家师的朋友，四帝是家师的故人，九曜是家师的晚辈，元辰是家师的下宾。”那行者闻言，就笑得打跌，八戒道：“哥啊，你笑怎的？”行者道：“只讲老孙会捣鬼，原来这道童会捆风！”三藏道：“令师何在？”童子道：“家师元始天尊降简请到上清天弥罗宫听讲混元道果去了，不在家。”行者闻言，忍不住喝了一声道：“这个臊道童！人也不认得，你在那个面前捣鬼，扯甚么空心架子！那弥罗宫有谁是太乙天仙？请你这泼牛蹄子去讲甚么！”三藏见他发怒，恐怕那童子回言，斗起祸来，便道：“悟空，且休争竞，我们既进来就出去，显得没了方情。常言道，鹭鸶不吃鹭鸶肉。</p>

<p>他师既是不在，搅扰他做甚？你去山门前放马，沙僧看守行李，教八戒解包袱，取些米粮，借他锅灶，做顿饭吃，待临行，送他几文柴钱便罢了。各依执事，让我在此歇息歇息，饭毕就行。”</p>

<p>他三人果各依执事而去。</p>

<p>那明月、清风，暗自夸称不尽道：“好和尚！真个是西方爱圣临凡，真元不昧。师父命我们接待唐僧，将人参果与他吃，以表故旧之情，又教防着他手下人罗唣。果然那三个嘴脸凶顽，性情粗糙，幸得就把他们调开了。若在边前，却不与他人参果见面。”清风道：“兄弟，还不知那和尚可是师父的故人，问他一问看，莫要错了。”二童子又上前道：“启问老师可是大唐往西天取经的唐三藏？”长老回礼道：“贫僧就是，仙童为何知我贱名？”童子道：“我师临行，曾吩咐教弟子远接。不期车驾来促，有失迎迓。老师请坐，待弟子办茶来奉。”三藏道：“不敢。”那明月急转本房，取一杯香茶，献与长老。茶毕，清风道：“兄弟，不可违了师命，我和你去取果子来。”</p>

<p>二童别了三藏，同到房中，一个拿了金击子，一个拿了丹盘，又多将丝帕垫着盘底，径到人参园内。那清风爬上树去，使金击子敲果；明月在树下，以丹盘等接。须臾敲下两个果来，接在盘中，径至前殿奉献道：“唐师父，我五庄观土僻山荒，无物可奉，土仪素果二枚，权为解渴。”那长老见了，战战兢兢，远离三尺道：“善哉！善哉！今岁倒也年丰时稔，怎么这观里作荒吃人？这个是三朝未满的孩童，如何与我解渴？”清风暗道：“这和尚在那口舌场中，是非海里，弄得眼肉胎凡，不识我仙家异宝。”明月上前道：“老师，此物叫做人参果，吃一个儿不妨。”三藏道：“胡说！胡说！他那父母怀胎，不知受了多少苦楚，方生下未及三日，怎么就把他拿来当果子？”清风道：“实是树上结的。”长老道：“乱谈！乱谈！树上又会结出人来？拿过去，不当人子！”那两个童儿，见千推万阻不吃，只得拿着盘子，转回本房。那果子却也跷蹊，久放不得，若放多时即僵了，不中吃。二人到于房中，一家一个，坐在床边上，只情吃起。</p>

<p>噫！原来有这般事哩！他那道房，与那厨房紧紧的间壁，这边悄悄的言语，那边即便听见。八戒正在厨房里做饭，先前听见说取金击子，拿丹盘，他已在心；又听见他说唐僧不认得是人参果，即拿在房里自吃，口里忍不住流涎道：“怎得一个儿尝新！”自家身子又狼犺，不能彀得动，只等行者来，与他计较。</p>

<p>他在那锅门前，更无心烧火，不时的伸头探脑，出来观看。不多时，见行者牵将马来，拴在槐树上，径往后走，那呆子用手乱招道：“这里来！这里来！”行者转身到于厨声门首道：“呆子，你嚷甚的？想是饭不彀吃，且让老和尚吃饱，我们前边大人家，再化吃去罢。”八戒道：“你进来，不是饭少。这观里有一件宝贝，你可晓得？”行者道：“甚么宝贝？”八戒笑道：“说与你，你不曾见；</p>

<p>拿与你，你不认得。”行者道：“这呆子笑话我老孙。老孙五百年前，因访仙道时，也曾云游在海角天涯，那般儿不曾见？”八戒道：“哥啊，人参果你曾见么？”行者惊道：“这个真不曾见。但只常闻得人说，人参果乃是草还丹，人吃了极能延寿。如今那里有得？”八戒道：“他这里有。那童子拿两个与师父吃，那老和尚不认得，道是三朝未满的孩儿，不曾敢吃。那童子老大惫懒，师父既不吃，便该让我们，他就瞒着我们，才自在这隔壁房里，一家一个，啯啅啯啅的吃了出去，就急得我口里水泱。怎么得一个儿尝新？我想你有些溜撒，去他那园子里偷几个来尝尝，如何？”行者道：“这个容易，老孙去手到擒来。”急抽身，往前就走，八戒一把扯住道：“哥啊，我听得他在这房里说，要拿甚么金击子去打哩。须是干得停当，不可走露风声。”行者道：“我晓得，我晓得。”</p>

<p>那大圣使一个隐身法，闪进道房看时，原来那两个道童，吃了果子，上殿与唐僧说话，不在房里。行者四下里观看，看有甚么金击子，但只见窗棂上挂着一条赤金：有二尺长短，有指头粗细；底下是一个蒜疙疸的头子；上边有眼，系着一根绿绒绳儿。他道：“想必就是此物叫做金击子。”他却取下来，出了道房，径入后边去，推开两扇门，抬头观看，呀！却是一座花园！但见：朱栏宝槛，曲砌峰山。奇花与丽日争妍，翠竹共青天斗碧。</p>

<p>流杯亭外，一弯绿柳似拖烟；赏月台前，数簇乔松如泼靛。红拂拂，锦巢榴；绿依依，绣墩草。青茸茸，碧砂兰；攸荡荡，临溪水。</p>

<p>丹桂映金井梧桐，锦槐傍朱栏玉砌。有或红或白千叶桃，有或香或黄九秋菊。荼蘼架，映着牡丹亭；木槿台，相连芍药圃。看不尽傲霜君子竹，欺雪大夫松。更有那鹤庄鹿宅，方沼圆池；泉流碎玉，地萼堆金。朔风触绽梅花白，春来点破海棠红。诚所谓人间第一仙景，西方魁首花丛。那行者观看不尽，又见一层门，推开看处，却是一座菜园：布种四时蔬菜，菠芹莙荙姜苔。</p>

<p>笋薯瓜瓠茭白，葱蒜芫荽韭薤。窝蕖童蒿苦荬，葫芦茄子须栽。</p>

<p>蔓菁萝卜羊头埋，红苋青菘紫芥。行者笑道：“他也是个自种自吃的道士。”走过菜园，又见一层门。推开看处，呀！只见那正中间有根大树，真个是青枝馥郁，绿叶阴森，那叶儿却似芭蕉模样，直上去有千尺余高，根下有七八丈围圆。那行者倚在树下往上一看，只见向南的枝上，露出一个人参果，真个象孩儿一般。原来尾间上是个扢蒂，看他丁在枝头，手脚乱动，点头幌脑，风过处似乎有声。行者欢喜不尽，暗自夸称道：“好东西呀！</p>

<p>果然罕见！果然罕见！”他倚着树，飕的一声，撺将上去。</p>

<p>那猴子原来第一会爬树偷果子。他把金击子敲了一下，那果子扑的落将下来。他也随跳下来跟寻，寂然不见，四下里草中找寻，更无踪影。行者道：“跷蹊！跷蹊！想是有脚的会走，就走也跳不出墙去。我知道了，想是花园中土地不许老孙偷他果子，他收了去也。”他就捻着诀，念一口“唵”字咒，拘得那花园土地前来，对行者施礼道：“大圣，呼唤小神，有何吩咐？”行者道：“你不知老孙是盖天下有名的贼头。我当年偷蟠桃、盗御酒、窃灵丹，也不曾有人敢与我分用，怎么今日偷他一个果子，你就抽了我的头分去了！这果子是树上结的，空中过鸟也该有分，老孙就吃他一个，有何大害？怎么刚打下来，你就捞了去？”</p>

<p>土地道：“大圣，错怪了小神也。这宝贝乃是地仙之物，小神是个鬼仙，怎么敢拿去？就是闻也无福闻闻。”行者道：“你既不曾拿去，如何打下来就不见了？”土地道：“大圣只知这宝贝延寿，更不知他的出处哩。”行者道：“有甚出处？”土地道：“这宝贝三千年一开花，三千年一结果，再三千年方得成熟。短头一万年，只结得三十个。有缘的，闻一闻，就活三百六十岁；吃一个，就活四万七千年。却是只与五行相畏。”行者道：“怎么与五行相畏？”土地道：“这果子遇金而落，遇木而枯，遇水而化，遇火而焦，遇土而入。敲时必用金器，方得下来。打下来，却将盘儿用丝帕衬垫方可；若受些木器，就枯了，就吃也不得延寿。吃他须用磁器，清水化开食用，遇火即焦而无用。遇土而入者，大圣方才打落地上，他即钻下土去了。这个土有四万七千年，就是钢钻钻他也钻不动些须，比生铁也还硬三四分，人若吃了，所以长生。大圣不信时，可把这地下打打儿看。”行者即掣金箍棒筑了一下，响一声迸起棒来，土上更无痕迹。行者道：“果然！果然！我这棍，打石头如粉碎，撞生铁也有痕，怎么这一下打不伤些儿？这等说，我却错怪了你了，你回去罢。”那土地即回本庙去讫。</p>

<p>大圣却有算计：爬上树，一只手使击子，一只手将锦布直裰的襟儿扯起来，做个兜子等住，他却串枝分叶，敲了三个果，兜在襟中，跳下树，一直前来，径到厨房里去。那八戒笑道：“哥哥，可有么？”行者道：“这不是？老孙的手到擒来。这个果子，也莫背了沙僧，可叫他一声。”八戒即招手叫道：“悟净，你来。”</p>

<p>那沙僧撇下行李，跑进厨房道：“哥哥，叫我怎的？”行者放开衣兜道：“兄弟，你看这个是甚的东西？”沙僧见了道：“是人参果。”行者道：“好啊！你倒认得，你曾在那里吃过的？”沙僧道：</p>

<p>“小弟虽不曾吃，但旧时做卷帘大将，扶侍鸾舆赴蟠桃宴，尝见海外诸仙将此果与王母上寿。见便曾见，却未曾吃。哥哥，可与我些儿尝尝？”行者道：“不消讲，兄弟们一家一个。”他三人将三个果各各受用。那八戒食肠大，口又大，一则是听见童子吃时，便觉馋虫拱动，却才见了果子，拿过来，张开口，毂辘的囫囵吞咽下肚，却白着眼胡赖，向行者、沙僧道：“你两个吃的是甚么？”沙僧道：“人参果。”八戒道：“甚么味道？”行者道：“悟净，不要睬他！你倒先吃了，又来问谁？”八戒道：“哥哥，吃的忙了些，不象你们细嚼细咽，尝出些滋味。我也不知有核无核，就吞下去了。哥啊，为人为彻。已经调动我这馋虫，再去弄个儿来，老猪细细的吃吃。”行者道：“兄弟，你好不知止足这个东西，比不得那米食面食，撞着尽饱。象这一万年只结得三十个，我们吃他这一个，也是大有缘法，不等小可。罢罢罢！彀了！”</p>

<p>他欠起身来，把一个金击子，瞒窗眼儿，丢进他道房里，竟不睬他。</p>

<p>那呆子只管絮絮叨叨的唧哝，不期那两个道童复进房来取茶去献，只听得八戒还嚷甚么“人参果吃得不快活，再得一个儿吃吃才好。”清风听见心疑道：“明月，你听那长嘴和尚讲人参果还要个吃吃。师父别时叮咛，教防他手下人罗唣，莫敢是他偷了我们宝贝么？”明月回头道：“哥耶，不好了！不好了！</p>

<p>金击子如何落在地下？我们去园里看看来！”他两个急急忙忙的走去，只见花园开了，清风道：“这门是我关的，如何开了？”</p>

<p>又急转过花园，只见菜园门也开了。忙入人参园里，倚在树下，望上查数；颠倒来往，只得二十二个。明月道：“你可会算帐？”</p>

<p>清风道：“我会，你说将来。”明月道：“果子原是三十个。师父开园，分吃了两个，还有二十八个；适才打两个与唐僧吃，还有二十六个；如今止剩得二十二个，却不少了四个？不消讲，不消讲，定是那伙恶人偷了，我们只骂唐僧去来。”两个出了园门，径来殿上，指着唐僧，秃前秃后，秽语污言不绝口的乱骂；贼头鼠脑，臭短臊长，没好气的胡嚷。唐僧听不过道：“仙童啊，你闹的是甚么？消停些儿，有话慢说不妨，不要胡说散道的。”清风说：“你的耳聋？我是蛮话，你不省得？你偷吃了人参果，怎么不容我说。”唐僧道：“人参果怎么模样？”明月道：“才拿来与你吃，你说象孩童的不是？”唐僧道：“阿弥陀佛！那东西一见，我就心惊胆战，还敢偷他吃哩！就是害了馋痞，也不敢干这贼事。</p>

<p>不要错怪了人。”清风道：“你虽不曾吃，还有手下人要偷吃的哩。”三藏道：“这等也说得是，你且莫嚷，等我问他们看。果若是偷了，教他赔你。”明月道：“赔呀！就有钱那里去买？”三藏道：“纵有钱没处买呵，常言道，仁义值千金。教他陪你个礼，便罢了。也还不知是他不是他哩。”明月道：“怎的不是他？他那里分不均，还在那里嚷哩。”三藏叫声：“徒弟，且都来。”沙僧听见道：“不好了！决撒了！老师父叫我们，小道童胡厮骂，不是旧话儿走了风，却是甚的？”行者道：“活羞杀人！这个不过是饮食之类。若说出来，就是我们偷嘴了，只是莫认。”八戒道：“正是，正是，昧了罢。”他三人只得出了厨房，走上殿去。咦！毕竟不知怎么与他抵赖，且听下回分解。</p>
