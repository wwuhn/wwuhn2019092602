<P>Pig Fights a Great Battle in the Flowing Sands River</P>
<P>Moksa Obeys the Dharma and Wins Friar Sand Over</P>
	</div>




<P>The story tells how the Tang Priest and his two disciples escaped from their troubles and pressed forward. Before long they had crossed the Yellow Wind Ridge and were heading West across a plain. The time passed rapidly, and summer gave way to autumn. Cold cicadas sang in moulting willow trees, and the Great Fire Star sank below the Western horizon. As they were travelling one day they saw the mighty waves of a great river, boiling and raging. &#8220;Disciple,&#8221; called out Sanzang from his horse, &#8220;do you see that broad river in front of us? Why are there no boats on it, and how are we going to get across?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Those are really terrible waves,&#8221; said Pig when he saw the river, &#8220;and there aren't any boats to ferry us over.&#8221; Monkey sprang into the sky, shaded his eyes with his hand, and looked. &#8220;Master,&#8221; he said with horror, &#8220;we're in big trouble here. I can cross a river like this with a twist of my waist, but I'm afraid you'll never be able to cross it in ten thousand years.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How wide is it, then?&#8221; Sanzang asked. &#8220;I can't see the other bank from here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;About three hundred miles,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;How can you be so sure of the distance, brother?&#8221; Pig asked. &#8220;These eyes of mine can see what's happening three hundred and fifty miles away in daytime,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;When I took a look from up in the air just now I couldn't make out the length of the river, but I could see that it was a good three hundred and fifty miles wide.&#8221; Depressed and worried, Sanzang reined in his horse and noticed a stone tablet beside the river. The three of them went to look at it, and they saw the words FLOWING SANDS RIVER inscribed on it in the ancient curly style. On the base of the tablet were four lines in the standard script:</P>


<P>&#8220;Three hundred miles of flowing sands,</P>
<P>Three thousand fathoms of weak water,</P>
<P>On which a goose feather will not float,</P>
<P>And the flower of a reed will sink.&#8221;</P>


<P>As the three of them were looking at this tablet they heard the waves make a roar like a collapsing mountain as a most hideous evil spirit emerged from the water:</P>


<P>A head of matted hair, as red as fire,</P>
<P>A pair of staring eyes, gleaming like lamps.</P>
<P>An indigo face, neither black nor green,</P>
<P>A dragon's voice like drums or thunder.</P>


<P>On his body a cloak of yellow goose-down,</P>
<P>Tied at the waist with white creeper.</P>
<P>Nine skulls hung around his neck,</P>
<P>And in his hands was an enormous staff.</P>


<P>The monster came to the bank in a whirlwind and rushed straight at the Tang Priest. Monkey picked Sanzang up at once, turned, and made off up the high bank. Pig dropped his carrying-pole, grabbed his rake, and struck at the evil spirit, who parried the blow with his staff. Each of them showed his prowess on the banks of the Flowing Sands River, and it was a fine battle:</P>


<P>The nine-pronged rake,</P>
<P>And the ogre-quelling staff:</P>
<P>Two men fighting on the banks of the river.</P>
<P>One was the great commander Tian Peng</P>
<P>The other the banished Curtain-lifting General.</P>
<P>They used to meet in the Hall of Miraculous Mist,</P>
<P>But now they were locked in ferocious combat.</P>
<P>The rake had dug deep into clawed dragons,</P>
<P>The staff had defeated tusked elephants.</P>
<P>When either was held defensively, it was rock-solid;</P>
<P>In attack they cut into the wind.</P>
<P>While one clawed at head and face,</P>
<P>The other never panicked or left an opening.</P>
<P>One was the man-eating monster of the Flowing Sands River,</P>
<P>The other was a believer, a general cultivating his conduct.</P>


<P>The pair of them battled on for twenty rounds, but neither emerged as the victor. The Great Sage, who was holding on to the horse and looking after the luggage after carrying the Tang Priest to safety, became worked up into such a fury at the sight of Pig and the monster fighting that he ground his teeth and clenched his fists.</P>
<P>When he could hold himself back no longer, he pulled out his cudgel and said, &#8220;Master, you sit here and don't be afraid. I'm going to play with him.&#8221; Ignoring Sanzang's pleas for him to stay, he whistled, jumped down to the side of the river, and found that the fight between Pig and the ogre was at its height. Brother Monkey swung his cudgel and aimed it at the ogre's head, but the ogre made a lightning turn and plunged straight into the river. Pig was hopping mad.</P>
<P>&#8220;Nobody asked you to come, elder brother,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That ogre was tiring and he could hardly fend my rake off. With few more rounds I would have captured him, but you gave him such a fright that he ran away, damn it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile, &#8220;I must tell you frankly that the sight of you fighting so beautifully gave me an uncontrollable itch. I haven't used my cudgel for a whole month since we came down the mountain after dealing with the Yellow Wind Monster&#8212;I just had to join in the fun. How was I to know that the monster wouldn't want to play and was going to run away?&#8221;</P>
<P>The two of them then clasped hands and went back talking and laughing to see Sanzang, who asked, &#8220;Did you catch the ogre?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;he couldn't take any more and dived back into the water.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He has lived here for a long time, disciple,&#8221; Sanzang said, &#8220;and must know the shallows and deeps here. We must have a water expert to lead us across this vast expanse of weak water that has no boats.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;as the saying goes, 'What's near cinnabar goes red, and what's next to ink turns black.' As that ogre lives here he must be a water expert, so if we catch him we shouldn't kill him&#8212;we should make him take you across, master, before finishing him off.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no time to lose, brother,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;You go and catch him while I look after the master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is something I can't talk big about,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile. &#8220;I'm not all that good at underwater stuff. Even to walk underwater I have to make a magic hand movement and recite a water-repelling spell before I can move. The only other way I can get about there is by turning myself into a fish, a shrimp, a crab or a turtle. I can manage any strange and wonderful magic on a mountain or in the clouds that you can do, but when it comes to underwater business, I'm useless.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When I was the commander of the Milky Way, the heavenly river, in the old days,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;I had a force of eighty thousand sailors, so I know a bit about water. But I'm afraid that he might have generations of clansmen down there, and that would be too much for me. And if they got me, we'd be in a real mess.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You go into the water and start a fight with him there,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Don't fight hard, and don't win. You must lose and lure him out, then I can finish him off for you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well then, I'll be off,&#8221; said Pig. After stripping off his brocade tunic and removing his shoes he swung his rake in both hands and made his way into the water, where the tricks he had learned years back enabled him to go through the waves to the river-bed, across which he advanced.</P>
<P>The ogre had now recovered his breath after his earlier defeat, and when he heard someone pushing the waters aside he leapt to his feet to look. Seeing that it was Pig brandishing his rake, the monster raised his staff and shouted at him, &#8220;Where do you think you're going, monk? Watch out, and take this.&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig warded off the blow with his rake and replied. &#8220;Who are you, evil spirit, and why are you blocking the way?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You may not realize who I am,&#8221; the monster replied, &#8220;but I'm no fiend, demon, ghost or monster, and I don't lack a name either.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you're not a fiend, a demon, or a monster, then why do you live here taking life? Tell me your name truthfully and I'll spare you life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I,&#8221; the monster replied,</P>


<P>&#8220;Have had a divine essence since childhood,</P>
<P>And have wandered all over heaven and earth.</P>
<P>I have won glory among the heroes of the world,</P>
<P>And brave knights have taken me as their model.</P>


<P>I traveled at will over countries and continents,</P>
<P>Going where I liked in lakes and seas,</P>
<P>To study the Way I went to the edge of the heavens,</P>
<P>And I roamed the wastes in search of teachers.</P>


<P>In those days I had a cassock and an alms-bowl,</P>
<P>And I kept my mind and spirit well controlled.</P>
<P>I traveled the earth by cloud some dozen times,</P>
<P>Visiting everywhere on a hundred journeys.</P>


<P>The Immortal I finally managed to find</P>
<P>Led me along the great and shining Way.</P>
<P>First I gathered mercury and lead,</P>
<P>Then I let go of the Mother of Wood and Metal's Father.</P>


<P>The kidney-water behind my brow entered my mouth,</P>
<P>And the liver-fire in my windpipes entered my heart.</P>
<P>With three thousand accomplishment won,</P>
<P>I bowed to the heavenly countenance;</P>


<P>Piously I worshipped him in his glory.</P>
<P>The Great Jade Emperor then promoted me</P>
<P>To be the General Who Lifts the Curtain.</P>
<P>I was honoured within the Southern Gate of Heaven,</P>


<P>Supreme before the Hall of Miraculous Mist.</P>
<P>At my waist was hung the tiger tally,</P>
<P>In my hand I held my demon-quelling staff.</P>
<P>My golden helmet shone like sunlight,</P>


<P>On my body gleamed a suit of armour.</P>
<P>I led the escort for the Emperor's carriage,</P>
<P>Always took precedence when he entered or left court.</P>
<P>But then the Queen Mother gathered the peaches</P>


<P>And invited all the generals to feast at the Jade Pool.</P>
<P>I carelessly smashed some jade and crystal,</P>
<P>To the horror of all of the heavenly gods.</P>
<P>The Jade Emperor in his terrible fury</P>


<P>Put his hands together and fumed to the vice-premier.</P>
<P>My hat and armour were removed, and I was stripped of office,</P>
<P>Then marched to the place of execution.</P>
<P>Then, to my good fortune, the great Bare-foot Immortal</P>


<P>Stepped forward to ask for my reprieve.</P>
<P>Death was commuted; I was allowed to live</P>
<P>In exile on the East bank of the Flowing Sands River.</P>
<P>When well-fed I sleep in the river waters;</P>


<P>When hungry I burst through the waves in search of food.</P>
<P>If a woodcutter meets me his life is finished&#8212;</P>
<P>No fisherman sees me and survives.</P>
<P>In one way and another I've eaten many a man,</P>


<P>Cloaked as I am in an aura of death.</P>
<P>As you've dared to come to make trouble at my gates</P>
<P>My belly has something to look forward to today.</P>
<P>No matter if you're coarse and don't taste good,</P>
<P>When I've caught you I can cut you up for salted mince.&#8221;</P>


<P>Pig was extremely angry to hear this, and he replied, &#8220;You're completely blind, wretch. I can catch bubbles in my fingers, so how dare you say that I'm so coarse you'll cut me up for salted mince? So you take me to be a very well-cured side of ham! Don't be impudent&#8212;take a dose of this rake.&#8221; When the monster saw the rake coming at him he did a &#8220;phoenix nod&#8221; to avoid it. The two of them fought their way up to the surface of the water, where each of them trod on the waves as they struggled in a combat that was even fiercer than their previous one.</P>


<P>The Curtain-lifting General,</P>
<P>And Marshal Tian Peng;</P>
<P>Each gave a splendid show of magic powers.</P>
<P>The ogre-quelling staff wheels around the head,</P>
<P>The nine-pronged rake is swift in the hand.</P>
<P>As they leap on the waves, they shake hills and rivers,</P>
<P>Darkening the world as they push the waters aside,</P>
<P>As terrible as the Disaster Star striking banners and pendants,</P>
<P>As frightening as lifting the canopy off the Death Star.</P>
<P>One was the loyal defender of the Tang Priest,</P>
<P>The other, a criminal, was an ogre of the waters.</P>
<P>Where the rake struck it left nine scars;</P>
<P>When the staff smote, all the souls were scattered.</P>
<P>Cheerfully fighting for all they were worth,</P>
<P>They put all their hearts into the combat.</P>
<P>Although he is only a pilgrim fetching scriptures</P>
<P>His unrestrained anger bursts against the sky.</P>
<P>Such was the chaos that the fishes lost their scales,</P>
<P>While the soft shells of terrapins were crushed;</P>
<P>Red prawns and purple crabs all lost their lives,</P>
<P>And all the gods of the water palace prayed to heaven.</P>
<P>The only sound was the thunder of crashing waves;</P>
<P>Sun and moon were dark, to the horror of earth and sky.</P>


<P>They battled on for four hours, but the issue was still undecided. It was as if a brass pan was fighting an iron brush, or a jade chime was competing with a golden bell.</P>
<P>The Great Sage, who was standing beside the Tang Priest to guard him, watched the fight on the water with longing, unable to do anything. Then Pig feinted with his rake, pretended to be beaten, and made for the Eastern bank with the ogre rushing after him. When he had almost reached the bank, Monkey could hold himself back no longer. Abandoning his master, he sprang down to the river's edge with his cudgel in his hand and took a swing at the ogre's head. Not daring to face him, the monster went straight back into the river. &#8220;Protector of the Horses,&#8221; Pig shouted, &#8220;you impatient ape. You should have taken it a bit more slowly and waited till I'd drawn him up to high ground, and then cut him off from the river-bank. Then he wouldn't have been able to go back and we'd have caught him. But now he's gone back in, he'll never come out again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't shout, idiot,&#8221; Monkey said with a smile, &#8220;don't shout. Let's go back and see our master.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Pig reached the top of the bank with Monkey, Sanzang bowed to him and said, &#8220;You've had a tough time, disciple.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I wouldn't say that,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;But if we'd captured that evil spirit and made him take you across the river, that would have been the perfect solution.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How did your battle with the evil spirit go?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;He's as good as me,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;When I pretended to be beaten in the fight he chased me to the river's edge; but then he saw elder brother waving his cudgel, so he ran away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So what are we going to do?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Relax, master,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;there's no need to worry. It's getting late, so you'd better sit on the bank while I go and beg some food. When you've eaten that you can go to sleep, and we can decide what to do tomorrow morning.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Good idea,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;Be as quick as you can.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey leapt up on his cloud, went due North to a house where he begged some food, and came back to give it to his master. Seeing him come back so soon, Sanzang said to him, &#8220;Monkey, let's go to the house where you begged this food and ask them how to cross this river. That would be better than having to fight this ogre.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But that house is a long way away,&#8221; laughed Monkey. &#8220;It's about two thousand miles from here. What would be the point in asking them about this river? They wouldn't know anything about it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're telling tall stories again,&#8221; Pig said. &#8220;If it's two thousand miles away, how did you get there and back so fast?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You wouldn't know, of course,&#8221; Brother Monkey replied, &#8220;that my somersault cloud can cover thirty-six thousand miles with a single bound. To do a mere two-thousand-mile return journey takes only a couple of nods and a bow&#8212;there's nothing to it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If it's so easy, brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;you should carry the master on your back, take him across with just a couple of nods and a bow, and save us all the trouble of fighting the monster.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You can ride clouds, can't you?&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Why don't you carry the master across?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The master's mortal flesh and bones are heavier than Mount Tai,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;So although I can ride clouds I could never lift him. Nothing but your somersault will do the trick.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My somersault is the same as cloud-riding.&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;except that it takes you further. I'm no more able to carry him than you are. As the old saying goes, 'Mount Tai is as easy to move as a mustard seed, but a mortal cannot be dragged away from the earthly dust.' When that other poisonous monster of a fiend made a magic wind I could only move the master by dragging and tugging him along the ground. Of course. I can do tricks like that, and all those other ones like making myself invisible or shrinking land. But although our master cannot escape from the sea of suffering he wants to go to a foreign land, so he finds every inch of the way heavy going. All we can do is escort him and see that he comes to no harm. We can't undergo all that suffering on his behalf, nor can we fetch the scriptures for him. Even if we went ahead to see the Buddha, he wouldn't give the scriptures to you or me. After all, if we could get them that easily, we'd have nothing to do.&#8221; The idiot accepted everything Monkey said, then they ate some plain rice without any vegetables, after which the three of them went to sleep on the Eastern bank of the Flowing Sands River.</P>
<P>&#8220;Monkey,&#8221; said Sanzang the next morning, &#8220;what are we going to do about it today?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's nothing for it but to send Pig back under the water,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;You're making me go underwater because you want to stay dry, brother,&#8221; Pig protested. &#8220;I won't be impatient this time,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;I'll let you lure him out onto the bank and then I'll cut him off from the river. That way we'll be bound to catch him.&#8221;</P>
<P>Dear Pig rubbed his face, summoned up his energy, took his rake in both hands, went down to the river, and parted the waters as he went back to the monster's lair once more. The ogre, who had only just woken up, turned to see what was happening the moment he heard the waters being pushed apart. Observing that a rake-wielding Pig was upon him, he sprang to his feet to stop him, shouting, &#8220;Not so fast, not so fast. Take this.&#8221; Pig blocked the blow from the staff with his rake and said, &#8220;What do you mean by telling your ancestor to 'take this' from that mourner's staff of yours?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You know nothing, you wretch,&#8221; the monster replied, continuing:</P>


<P>&#8220;Great is the fame of this staff of mine,</P>
<P>Made from a Sala tree on the moon.</P>
<P>Wu Gang cut down a branch of it,</P>
<P>For Lu Ban to work with his unrivalled skill.</P>


<P>A strip of gold goes right through its heart,</P>
<P>And it is set with countless pearls.</P>
<P>It is a precious staff, fine for subduing fiends;</P>
<P>It could quell all demons when it guarded the Heavenly Palace.</P>


<P>When I was commissioned as High General</P>
<P>The Jade Emperor gave it me to use.</P>
<P>It can be any length I wish,</P>
<P>Thick or thin, responding to my will.</P>


<P>It protected the Emperor at Peach Banquets,</P>
<P>Attended at court in the upper world.</P>
<P>When I was at the palace, it met all the sages,</P>
<P>When I lifted the curtain, it greeted the Immortals.</P>


<P>I nurtured it and made it a divine weapon&#8212;</P>
<P>This is no ordinary earthly arm.</P>
<P>When I was sent down from Heaven in exile</P>
<P>I roamed at will throughout the world.</P>


<P>I do not need to boast about this staff,</P>
<P>Unmatched by any spear or saber in the world.</P>
<P>Look at that rusty rake of yours,</P>
<P>Only good for farming or growing vegetables.&#8221;</P>


<P>&#8220;I'll give you the beating you deserve, damn you,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;Never mind about vegetable-growing&#8212;one swipe from it and you'll have nowhere left to put ointment, because your blood will be pouring out from nine holes. Even if it doesn't kill you, you'll have tetanus for the rest of your days.&#8221; The ogre dropped his defensive posture and fought with Pig from the river-bed to the surface of the water. This battle was fiercer than the earlier ones:</P>


<P>The precious staff whirled,</P>
<P>The deadly rake struck,</P>
<P>And no word passed between the two foes.</P>
<P>Because the Mother of Wood conquered the Medicine Measure</P>
<P>The pair of them had to fight each other twice.</P>
<P>With no victory,</P>
<P>And no defeat,</P>
<P>The waves were overturned and knew no peace.</P>
<P>How could the one hold back his anger?</P>
<P>How could the other bear his humiliation?</P>
<P>As the staff parried the rake's blows, they showed their prowess;</P>
<P>Each was most vicious as the Flowing Sands River rolled.</P>
<P>Towering rage,</P>
<P>Strenuous efforts,</P>
<P>All because Sanzang wanted to go West.</P>
<P>The rake was thoroughly murderous,</P>
<P>The staff was wielded with experience.</P>
<P>Pig grabbed his enemy, trying to drag him ashore,</P>
<P>While the other in torn tried to pull Pig under water.</P>
<P>The thunderous noise disturbed fish and dragons;</P>
<P>Gods and ghosts lay low as the sky was darkened.</P>


<P>The battle went on for thirty rounds, but neither emerged victorious. Pig feigned defeat once again, and fled trailing his rake behind him. The ogre charged through the waves after him as far as the bank, when Pig shouted at him, &#8220;I'll get you, you damned ogre. Come up on this higher ground where we can fight with dry land under our feet.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're trying to lure me up there, damn you,&#8221; the monster replied, &#8220;for your mate to come and get me. Come back and fight in the water.&#8221; The fiend, who had more sense than to go up the bank again, stood at the river's edge, shouting it out with Pig.</P>
<P>When Monkey saw that the monster was not coming up on the bank he seethed with frustration at not being able to catch him. &#8220;Master,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you sit here while I do a 'Hungry Eagle Falling on Its Prey' on him.&#8221; He somersaulted into mid-air, then plummeted down to catch the ogre, who heard the noise of a wind as he was yelling at Pig, turned immediately, and saw Monkey descending from the clouds. He put his staff away, plunged into the water with a splash, and was seen no more. &#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Monkey to Pig as he landed on the bank, &#8220;the monster's made a smooth getaway. Whatever are we to do if he won't come on to the bank again?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's impossible,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;We'll never be able to beat him. Even if I put everything I've got into it, I can only hold my own against him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Let's go and see the master,&#8221; Monkey said.</P>
<P>The two of them climbed the bank and told the Tang Priest about the difficulty of capturing the ogre. &#8220;It's so hard,&#8221; said Sanzang, tears streaming down his cheeks. &#8220;However are we going to cross?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No need to worry, master,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;The monster is lurking deep down on the river-bed, where it's very hard to move around. You stay here and look after the master, Pig, and don't fight with the ogre again. I'm going to the Southern Sea.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What for?&#8221; Pig asked. &#8220;This whole business of fetching the scriptures was started by the Bodhisattva Guanyin, and it was she who converted us. Now we are stuck here at the Flowing Sands River nobody but she can sort this one out. With her help we'll be in a stronger position to fight that monster.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;and when you're there, please thank her for converting me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you're going to ask the Bodhisattva to come,&#8221; Sanzang said, &#8220;don't waste a moment, and be back as quickly as possible.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey then somersaulted off on his cloud towards the Southern Sea, and before an hour was up he saw Potaraka Island. An instant later he landed outside the Purple Bamboo Grove, where the twenty-four devas came forward to greet him with the words, &#8220;Why have you come, Great Sage?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Because my master is in trouble,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;I have come for an audience with the Bodhisattva.&#8221; The deva on duty that day asked Monkey to sit down while he went in to report, whereupon he went into the Tide Cave to announce that Sun Wukong was seeking an audience on business. The Bodhisattva was leaning on a balcony looking at the blossoms in the Precious Lotus Pool with the Dragon Princess Peng Zhu when she heard the news. She went back in her cloudy majesty, opening the door and summoning Monkey to her presence. The Great Sage greeted her with grave reverence.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why aren't you looking after the Tang Priest,&#8221; she asked, &#8220;and why have you come to see me.?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My master won a new disciple at Gao Village, Bodhisattva,&#8221; Brother Monkey reported. &#8220;He's called Zhu Bajie and also has the Buddhist name Wuneng thanks to you. We have now reached the Flowing Sands River after crossing the Yellow Wind Ridge, but it's a thousand miles of Ruo River and my master cannot cross it. On top of this there's an evil monster in the river who's a great fighter, and although our Pig had three great battles with him on the surface of the water, he couldn't beat the ogre, who is still blocking our way and preventing my master from crossing. This is why I've come to see you and ask you in your mercy to help him across.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You have revealed your conceit once again, you ape,&#8221; said the Bodhisattva. &#8220;Why didn't you tell the monster that you were protecting the Tang Priest?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We wanted to catch him,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and make him take our master across the river. As I'm not up to much in the water, Pig was the only one who could find the ogre's den and did all the talking. I expect he never mentioned fetching the scriptures.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The ogre of the Flowing Sands River is the mortal incarnation of the Great Curtain-lifting General,&#8221; said Guanyin, &#8220;and is a believer whom I converted myself and instructed to protect those who would be coming to fetch the scriptures. If you had told him that you had come from the East to fetch the scriptures, so far from fighting you, he would certainly have joined you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But the craven monster is now skulking in the river, too frightened to come out,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;so how are we to make him join us, and how is my master to cross the weak water?&#8221;</P>
<P>The Bodhisattva sent for her disciple Huian and produced a red bottle-gourd from her sleeve. &#8220;Take this gourd,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and go with Sun Wukong to the Flowing Sands River. Shout 'Wujing'&#8212;'Awakened to Purity'&#8212;and he'll come out. First take him to submit to the Tang Priest, and then make him thread his nine skulls on a string like the Sacred Palaces. If he puts this gourd in the middle of them, it will make a dharma boat to ferry the Tang Priest across the river.&#8221; In obedience to the Bodhisattva's command, Huian and the Great Sage took the gourd with them from the Tide Cave and the Purple Bamboo Grove. There are some lines to describe it:</P>


<P>The Five Elements were combined with the heavenly Immortal,</P>
<P>Recognizing their master of the old days.</P>
<P>They have been sufficiently refined to achieve great things;</P>
<P>When true and false are distinguished, origins are seen.</P>
<P>When Metal joins Nature, like joins like;</P>
<P>When Wood seeks the Passions, both are lost.</P>
<P>When the two Earths achieve nirvana,</P>
<P>Fire and Water will combine, and worldly dust be no more.</P>


<P>A little later the pair of them brought their clouds down to land on the bank of the Flowing Sands River. Recognizing Huian as Moksa the Novice, Pig led his master forward to meet him. When Moksa had exchanged courtesies with Sanzang, he greeted Pig.</P>
<P>Then Pig said, &#8220;Thanks to Your Holiness's instruction, I was able to meet the Bodhisattva, and since then I have obeyed the Buddhist law and had the pleasure of becoming a monk. As I have been travelling since then, I've been too busy to go and thank you. Please forgive me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be so longwinded,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Let's go and call to that wretch.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Call to whom?&#8221; asked Sanzang. &#8220;I saw the Bodhisattva,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;and told her what had happened. She said that the ogre of the Flowing Sands River is the mortal incarnation of the Great Curtain-lifting General, who was thrown down to this river as a monster because of a crime he had committed in Heaven. He has been converted by the Bodhisattva and has vowed to go to the Western Heaven with you. If we'd told him we were going to fetch the scriptures, there would have been none of this bitter fighting. The Bodhisattva has now sent Moksa to give this gourd to that fellow to make a dharma boat that will ferry you across.&#8221; Sanzang bowed in reverence to the Bodhisattva many times when he heard it, and also bowed to Moksa with the words, &#8220;Please do this as quickly as you can, Your Holiness.&#8221; Moksa then went by cloud and stood over the river with the gourd in his hands.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wujing, Wujing,&#8221; he shouted at the top of his voice, &#8220;the pilgrims who are going to fetch the scriptures have been here for a long time. Why haven't you submitted to them?&#8221;</P>
<P>The ogre, who had gone back to the river-bed for fear of the Monkey King, was resting in his den when he heard his Buddhist name being called and realized that this was a message from the Bodhisattva Guanyin. On hearing that the pilgrims were there, his fears of being attacked melted away, and he pushed his head up through the waves to see that it was Moksa the Novice. Look at him as he bows to Moksa, his face wreathed in smiles. &#8220;I'm sorry I did not welcome you properly, Your Holiness,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Where is the Bodhisattva?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;She didn't come,&#8221; Moksa replied. &#8220;She sent me to tell you to be the Tang Priest's disciple. You are to take the nine skulls you wear round your neck, arrange them with this gourd in the pattern of the Nine Sacred Palaces, and make a dharma boat to ferry him across this weak water.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where is the pilgrim?&#8221; Wujing asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;There he is, sitting on the bank,&#8221; said Moksa, pointing at Sanzang.</P>
<P>Wujing then noticed Pig and said, &#8220;I don't know where that bloody creature is from, but he fought with me for two whole days and never said a word about fetching scriptures. And as for this one,&#8221; he added, noticing Monkey, &#8220;he's that one's accomplice and a real terror. I'm not going with them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That one is Zhu Bajie, and this one is Brother Monkey. They are both disciples of the Tang Priest who have been converted by the Bodhisattva, so you have nothing to fear from them. Let me present you to the Tang Priest.&#8221; Wujing put away his staff, straightened his yellow brocade tunic, jumped ashore, knelt before the Tang Priest, and said, &#8220;Master, your disciple's eyes have no pupils in them&#8212;I beg you to forgive me for attacking your followers instead of recognizing who they were.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You pustule,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;why did you fight me instead of submitting? What did you mean by it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You can't blame him, brother,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;We didn't tell him our names or even mention fetching the scriptures.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do you believe in our teachings with all your heart?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I was converted by the Bodhisattva,&#8221; Wujing replied, &#8220;and she gave me this river's name as a surname and called me by the Buddhist name of Sha Wujing, or Sand Awakened to Purity, so of course I must follow you, master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;bring the razor over, Monkey, and cut his hair off.&#8221; The Great Sage obediently shaved the monster's head, who then bowed to Sanzang, Monkey, and Pig with appropriate degrees of reverence. When Sanzang saw him do this just like a real monk he gave him another name&#8212;Friar Sand.</P>
<P>&#8220;Now that you have entered the faith,&#8221; said Moksa, &#8220;there's no need to waste time talking. Make that dharma boat at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>Friar Sand took the skulls from round his neck without delay and tied them into the pattern of the Nine Palaces with the Bodhisattva's gourd in the middle. Then he asked Sanzang to board it, and Sanzang found when he sat on it that it was as stable as a small dinghy. Pig and Friar San supported him to left and right, while Monkey led the dragon horse through the clouds behind him, and Moksa stood above him on guard. Sanzang thus made a calm and windless crossing of the weak water of the Flowing Sands River. He moved with the speed of an arrow, and it was not long before he climbed ashore on the other side. He was neither wet nor muddy, and his hands and feet were completely dry. Thus it was that master and disciples trod on dry land again without any trouble. Moksa then landed his cloud, and took back the gourd. The nine skulls changed into nine gusts of wind and disappeared. Sanzang bowed to Moksa to thank him and worshipped the Bodhisattva, after which</P>


<P>Moksa returned to the Eastern Ocean,</P>
<P>While Sanzang remounted and headed West.</P>


<P>If you don't know when they won their reward and fetched the scriptures, listen to the explanation in the next chapter.</P>

<p>八戒大战流沙河</p>
<p>木叉奉法收悟净</p>
</div>
<p>话说唐僧师徒三众，脱难前来，不一日，行过了八百黄风岭，进西却是一脉平阳之地。光阴迅速，历夏经秋，见了些寒蝉鸣败柳，大火向西流。正行处，只见一道大水狂澜，浑波涌浪。</p>

<p>三藏在马上忙呼道：“徒弟，你看那前边水势宽阔，怎不见船只行走，我们从那里过去？”八戒见了道：“果是狂澜，无舟可渡。”</p>

<p>那行者跳在空中，用手搭凉篷而看，他也心惊道：“师父啊，真个是难，真个是难！这条河若论老孙去呵，只消把腰儿扭一扭，就过去了；若师父，诚千分难渡，万载难行。”三藏道：“我这里一望无边，端的有多少宽阔？”行者道：“径过有八百里远近。”</p>

<p>八戒道：“哥哥怎的定得个远近之数？”行者道：“不瞒贤弟说，老孙这双眼，白日里常看得千里路上的吉凶。却才在空中看出：此河上下不知多远，但只见这径过足有八百里。”长老忧嗟烦恼，兜回马，忽见岸上有一通石碑。三众齐来看时，见上有三个篆字，乃流沙河，腹上有小小的四行真字云：“八百流沙界，三千弱水深。鹅毛飘不起，芦花定底沉。”师徒们正看碑文，只听得那浪涌如山，波翻若岭，河当中滑辣的钻出一个妖精，十分凶丑：一头红焰发蓬松，两只圆睛亮似灯。不黑不青蓝靛脸，如雷如鼓老龙声。身披一领鹅黄氅，腰束双攒露白藤。项下骷髅悬九个，手持宝杖甚峥嵘。那怪一个旋风，奔上岸来，径抢唐僧，慌得行者把师父抱住，急登高岸，回身走脱。那八戒放下担子，掣出铁钯，望妖精便筑，那怪使宝杖架住。他两个在流沙河岸，各逞英雄。这一场好斗：九齿钯，降妖杖，二人相敌河岸上。</p>

<p>这个是总督大天蓬，那个是谪下卷帘将。昔年曾会在灵霄，今日争持赌猛壮。这一个钯去探爪龙，那一个杖架磨牙象。伸开大四平，钻入迎风戗。这个没头没脸抓，那个无乱无空放。一个是久占流沙界吃人精，一个是秉教迦持修行将。他两个来来往往，战经二十回合，不分胜负。</p>

<p>那大圣护了唐僧，牵着马，守定行李，见八戒与那怪交战，就恨得咬牙切齿，擦掌磨拳，忍不住要去打他，掣出棒来道：</p>

<p>“师父，你坐着，莫怕。等老孙和他耍耍儿来。”那师父苦留不住。他打个唿哨，跳到前边。原来那怪与八戒正战到好处，难解难分，被行者轮起铁棒，望那怪着头一下，那怪急转身，慌忙躲过，径钻入流沙河里。气得个八戒乱跳道：“哥啊！谁着你来的！那怪渐渐手慢，难架我钯，再不上三五合，我就擒住他了！</p>

<p>他见你凶险，败阵而逃，怎生是好！”行者笑道：“兄弟，实不瞒你说，自从降了黄风怪，下山来，这个把月不曾耍棍，我见你和他战的甜美，我就忍不住脚痒，故就跳将来耍耍的。那知那怪不识耍，就走了。”</p>

<p>他两个搀着手，说说笑笑，转回见了唐僧。唐僧道：“可曾捉得妖怪？”行者道：“那妖怪不奈战，败回钻入水去也。”三藏道：“徒弟，这怪久住于此，他知道浅深。似这般无边的弱水，又没了舟楫，须是得个知水性的，引领引领才好哩。”行者道：“正是这等说。常言道，近朱者赤，近墨者黑。那怪在此，断知水性。</p>

<p>我们如今拿住他，且不要打杀，只教他送师父过河，再做理会。”八戒道：“哥哥不必迟疑，让你先去拿他，等老猪看守师父。”行者笑道：“贤弟呀，这桩儿我不敢说嘴。水里勾当，老孙不大十分熟。若是空走，还要捻诀，又念念避水咒，方才走得。</p>

<p>不然，就要变化做甚么鱼虾蟹鳖之类，我才去得。若论赌手段，凭你在高山云里，干甚么蹊跷异样事儿，老孙都会，只是水里的买卖，有些儿榔杭。”八戒道：“老猪当年总督天河，掌管了八万水兵大众，倒学得知些水性，却只怕那水里有甚么眷族老小，七窝八代的都来，我就弄他不过，一时不被他捞去耶？”行者道：“你若到他水中与他交战，却不要恋战，许败不许胜，把他引将出来，等老孙下手助你。”八戒道：“言得是，我去耶。”说声去，就剥了青锦直裰，脱了鞋，双手舞钯，分开水路，使出那当年的旧手段，跃浪翻波，撞将进去，径至水底之下，往前正走。</p>

<p>却说那怪败了阵回，方才喘定，又听得有人推得水响，忽起身观看，原来是八戒执了钯推水。那怪举杖当面高呼道：“那和尚那里走！仔细看打！”八戒使钯架住道：“你是个甚么妖精，敢在此间挡路？”那妖道：“你是也不认得我。我不是那妖魔鬼怪，也不是少姓无名。”八戒道：“你既不是邪妖鬼怪，却怎生在此伤生？你端的甚么姓名，实实说来，我饶你性命。”那怪道：</p>

<p>“我自小生来神气壮，乾坤万里曾游荡。英雄天下显威名，豪杰人家做模样。万国九州任我行，五湖四海从吾撞。皆因学道荡天涯，只为寻师游地旷。常年衣钵谨随身，每日心神不可放。沿地云游数十遭，到处闲行百余趟。因此才得遇真人，引开大道金光亮。先将婴儿姹女收，后把木母金公放。明堂肾水入华池，重楼肝火投心脏。三千功满拜天颜，志心朝礼明华向。玉皇大帝便加升，亲口封为卷帘将。南天门里我为尊，灵霄殿前吾称上。腰间悬挂虎头牌，手中执定降妖杖。头顶金盔晃日光，身披铠甲明霞亮。往来护驾我当先，出入随朝予在上。只因王母降蟠桃，设宴瑶池邀众将。失手打破玉玻璃，天神个个魂飞丧。</p>

<p>玉皇即便怒生嗔，却令掌朝左辅相：卸冠脱甲摘官衔，将身推在杀场上。多亏赤脚大天仙，越班启奏将吾放。饶死回生不典刑，遭贬流沙东岸上。饱时困卧此山中，饿去翻波寻食饷。樵子逢吾命不存，渔翁见我身皆丧。来来往往吃人多，翻翻复复伤生瘴。你敢行凶到我门，今日肚皮有所望。莫言粗糙不堪尝，拿住消停剁鲊酱！”八戒闻言大怒，骂道：“你这泼物，全没一些儿眼色！我老猪还掐出水沫儿来哩，你怎敢说我粗糙，要剁鲊酱！看起来，你把我认做个老走硝哩。休得无礼！吃你祖宗这一钯！”那怪见钯来，使一个凤点头躲过。两个在水中打出水面，各人踏浪登波。这一场赌斗，比前不同，你看那：卷帘将，天蓬帅，各显神通真可爱。那个降妖宝杖着头轮，这个九齿钉钯随手快。跃浪振山川，推波昏世界。凶如太岁撞幛幡，恶似丧门掀宝盖。这一个赤心凛凛保唐僧，那一个犯罪滔滔为水怪。</p>

<p>钯抓一下九条痕，杖打之时魂魄败。努力喜相持，用心要赌赛。</p>

<p>算来只为取经人，怒气冲天不忍耐。搅得那鯾鲌鲤鳜退鲜鳞，龟鳖鼋鼍伤嫩盖；红虾紫蟹命皆亡，水府诸神朝上拜。只听得波翻浪滚似雷轰，日月无光天地怪。二人整斗有两个时辰，不分胜败。这才是铜盆逢铁帚，玉磬对金钟。</p>

<p>却说那大圣保着唐僧，立于左右，眼巴巴的望着他两个在水上争持，只是他不好动手。只见那八戒虚幌一钯，佯输诈败，转回头往东岸上走。那怪随后赶来，将近到了岸边，这行者忍耐不住，撇了师父，掣铁棒，跳到河边，望妖精劈头就打。那妖物不敢相迎，飕的又钻入河内。八戒嚷道：“你这弼马温，真是个急猴子！你再缓缓些儿，等我哄他到了高处，你却阻住河边，教他不能回首呵，却不拿住他也！他这进去，几时又肯出来？”</p>

<p>行者笑道：“呆子，莫嚷！莫嚷！我们且回去见师父去来。”八戒却同行者到高岸上，见了三藏。三藏欠身道：“徒弟辛苦呀。”八戒道：“且不说辛苦，只是降了妖精，送得你过河，方是万全之策。”三藏道：“你才与妖精交战何如？”八戒道：“那妖的手段，与老猪是个对手。正战处，使一个诈败，他才赶到岸上。见师兄举着棍子，他就跑了。”三藏道：“如此怎生奈何？”行者道：</p>

<p>“师父放心，且莫焦恼。如今天色又晚，且坐在这崖次之下，待老孙去化些斋饭来，你吃了睡去，待明日再处。”八戒道：“说得是，你快去快来。”行者急纵云跳起去，正到直北下人家化了一钵素斋，回献师父。师父见他来得甚快，便叫：“悟空，我们去化斋的人家，求问他一个过河之策，不强似与这怪争持？”行者笑道：“这家子远得很哩！相去有五七千里之路。他那里得知水性？问他何益？”八戒道：“哥哥又来扯谎了。五七千里路，你怎么这等去来得快？”行者道：“你那里晓得，老孙的觔斗云，一纵有十万八千里。象这五七千路，只消把头点上两点，把腰躬上一躬，就是个往回，有何难哉！”八戒道：“哥啊，既是这般容易，你把师父背着，只消点点头，躬躬腰，跳过去罢了，何必苦苦的与他厮战？”行者道：“你不会驾云？你把师父驮过去不是？”八戒道：“师父的骨肉凡胎，重似泰山，我这驾云的，怎称得起？须是你的觔斗方可。”行者道：“我的觔斗，好道也是驾云，只是去的有远近些儿。你是驮不动，我却如何驮得动？自古道，遣泰山轻如芥子，携凡夫难脱红尘。象这泼魔毒怪，使摄法，弄风头，却是扯扯拉拉，就地而行，不能带得空中而去。象那样法儿，老孙也会使会弄。还有那隐身法、缩地法，老孙件件皆知。</p>

<p>但只是师父要穷历异邦，不能彀超脱苦海，所以寸步难行也。</p>

<p>我和你只做得个拥护，保得他身在命在，替不得这些苦恼，也取不得经来，就是有能先去见了佛，那佛也不肯把经善与你我。正叫做若将容易得，便作等闲看。”那呆子闻言，喏喏听受。</p>

<p>遂吃了些无菜的素食，师徒们歇在流沙河东崖次之下。</p>

<p>次早，三藏道：“悟空，今日怎生区处？”行者道：“没甚区处，还须八戒下水。”八戒道：“哥哥，你要图干净，只作成我下水。”行者道：“贤弟，这番我再不急性了，只让你引他上来，我拦住河沿，不让他回去，务要将他擒了。”好八戒，抹抹脸，抖擞精神，双手拿钯到河沿，分开水路，依然又下至窝巢。那怪方才睡醒，忽听推得水响，急回头睁睛看看，见八戒执钯下至，他跳出来，当头阻住，喝道：“慢来！慢来！看杖！”八戒举钯架住道：</p>

<p>“你是个甚么哭丧杖，叫你祖宗看杖！”那怪道：“你这厮甚不晓得哩！我这宝杖原来名誉大，本是月里梭罗派。吴刚伐下一枝来，鲁班制造工夫盖。里边一条金趁心，外边万道珠丝玠。名称宝杖善降妖，永镇灵霄能伏怪。只因官拜大将军，玉皇赐我随身带。或长或短任吾心，要细要粗凭意态。也曾护驾宴蟠桃，也曾随朝居上界。值殿曾经众圣参，卷帘曾见诸仙拜。养成灵性一神兵，不是人间凡器械。自从遭贬下天门，任意纵横游海外。不当大胆自称夸，天下枪刀难比赛。看你那个锈钉钯，只好锄田与筑菜！”八戒笑道：“我把你少打的泼物！且莫管甚么筑菜，只怕荡了一下儿，教你没处贴膏药，九个眼子一齐流血！</p>

<p>纵然不死，也是个到老的破伤风！”那怪丢开架子，在那水底下，与八戒依然打出水面。这一番斗，比前果更不同，你看他：</p>

<p>宝杖轮，钉钯筑，言语不通非眷属。只因木母克刀圭，致令两下相战触。没输赢，无反复，翻波淘浪不和睦。这个怒气怎含容？</p>

<p>那个伤心难忍辱。钯来杖架逞英雄，水滚流沙能恶毒。气昂昂，劳碌碌，多因三藏朝西域。钉钯老大凶，宝杖十分熟。这个揪住要往岸上拖，那个抓来就将水里沃。声如霹雳动鱼龙，云暗天昏神鬼伏。这一场，来来往往，斗经三十回合，不见强弱。八戒又使个佯输计，拖了钯走。那怪随后又赶来，拥波捉浪，赶至崖边。八戒骂道：“我把你这个泼怪！你上来！这高处，脚踏实地好打！”那妖骂道：“你这厮哄我上去，又教那帮手来哩。你下来，还在水里相斗。”原来那妖乖了，再不肯上岸，只在河沿与八戒闹吵。</p>

<p>却说行者见他不肯上岸，急得他心焦性爆，恨不得一把捉来。行者道：“师父！你自坐下，等我与他个饿鹰雕食。”就纵筋斗，跳在半空，刷的落下来，要抓那妖。那妖正与八戒嚷闹，忽听得风响，急回头，见是行者落下云来，却又收了那杖，一头淬下水，隐迹潜踪，渺然不见。行者伫立岸上，对八戒说：“兄弟呀，这妖也弄得滑了。他再不肯上岸，如之奈何？”八戒道：“难！</p>

<p>难！难！战不胜他，就把吃奶的气力也使尽了，只绷得个手平。”</p>

<p>行者道：“且见师父去。”</p>

<p>二人又到高岸，见了唐僧，备言难捉。那长老满眼下泪道：</p>

<p>“似此艰难，怎生得渡！”行者道：“师父莫要烦恼。这怪深潜水底，其实难行。八戒，你只在此保守师父，再莫与他厮斗，等老孙往南海走走去来。”八戒道：“哥呵，你去南海何干？”行者道：</p>

<p>“这取经的勾当，原是观音菩萨；及脱解我等，也是观音菩萨。</p>

<p>今日路阻流沙河，不能前进，不得他，怎生处治？等我去请他，还强如和这妖精相斗。”八戒道：“也是，也是。师兄，你去时，千万与我上复一声：向日多承指教。”三藏道：“悟空，若是去请菩萨，却也不必迟疑，快去赶来。”</p>

<p>行者即纵筋斗云，径上南海。咦！那消半个时辰，早望见普陀山境。须臾间坠下筋斗，到紫竹林外，又只见那二十四路诸天，上前迎着道：“大圣何来？”行者道：“我师有难，特来谒见菩萨。”诸天道：“请坐，容报。”那轮日的诸天，径至潮音洞口报道：“孙悟空有事朝见。”菩萨正与捧珠龙女在宝莲池畔扶栏看花，闻报，即转云岩，开门唤入。大圣端肃皈依参拜，菩萨问曰：</p>

<p>“你怎么不保唐僧？为甚事又来见我？”行者启上道：“菩萨，我师父前在高老庄，又收了一个徒弟，唤名猪八戒，多蒙菩萨又赐法讳悟能。才行过黄风岭，今至八百里流沙河，乃是弱水三千，师父已是难渡。河中又有个妖怪，武艺高强，甚亏了悟能与他水面上大战三次，只是不能取胜，被他拦阻，不能渡河。因此特告菩萨，望垂怜悯。济渡他一济渡。”菩萨道：“你这猴子，又逞自满，不肯说出保唐僧的话来么？”行者道：“我们只是要拿住他，教他送我师父渡河。水里事，我又弄不得精细，只是悟能寻着他窝巢，与他打话，想是不曾说出取经的勾当。”菩萨道：</p>

<p>“那流沙河的妖怪，乃是卷帘大将临凡，也是我劝化的善信，教他保护取经之辈。你若肯说出是东土取经人呵，他决不与你争持，断然归顺矣。”行者道：“那怪如今怯战，不肯上崖，只在水里潜踪，如何得他归顺？我师如何得渡弱水？”</p>

<p>菩萨即唤惠岸，袖中取出一个红葫芦儿，吩咐道：“你可将此葫芦，同孙悟空到流沙河水面上，只叫悟净，他就出来了。先要引他归依了唐僧，然后把他那九个骷髅穿在一处，按九宫布列，却把这葫芦安在当中，就是法船一只，能渡唐僧过流沙河界。”惠岸闻言，谨遵师命，当时与大圣捧葫芦出了潮音洞，奉法旨辞了紫竹林。有诗为证，诗曰：五行匹配合天真，认得从前旧主人。炼已立基为妙用，辨明邪正见原因。金来归性还同类，木去求情共复沦。二土全功成寂寞，调和水火没纤尘。</p>

<p>他两个不多时按落云头，早来到流沙河岸。猪八戒认得是木叉行者，引师父上前迎接。那木叉与三藏礼毕，又与八戒相见。八戒道：“向蒙尊者指示，得见菩萨，我老猪果遵法教，今喜拜了沙门。这一向在途中奔碌，未及致谢，恕罪恕罪。”行者道：</p>

<p>“且莫叙阔，我们叫唤那厮去来。”三藏道：“叫谁？”行者道：“老孙见菩萨，备陈前事。菩萨说：这流沙河的妖怪，乃是卷帘大将临凡，因为在天有罪，堕落此河，忘形作怪。他曾被菩萨劝化，愿归师父往西天去的。但是我们不曾说出取经的事情，故此苦苦争斗。菩萨今差木叉，将此葫芦，要与这厮结作法船，渡你过去哩。”三藏闻言，顶礼不尽，对木叉作礼道：“万望尊者作速一行。”那木叉捧定葫芦，半云半雾，径到了流沙河水面上，厉声高叫道：“悟净！悟净！取经人在此久矣，你怎么还不归顺！”却说那怪惧怕猴王，回于水底，正在窝中歇息，只听得叫他法名，情知是观音菩萨；又闻得说“取经人在此”，他也不惧斧钺，急翻波伸出头来，又认得是木叉行者。你看他笑盈盈，上前作礼道：“尊者失迎，菩萨今在何处？”木叉道：“我师未来，先差我来吩咐你早跟唐僧做个徒弟。叫把你项下挂的骷髅与这个葫芦，按九宫结做一只法船，渡他过此弱水。”悟净道：“取经人却在那里？”木叉用手指道：“那东岸上坐的不是？”悟净看见了八戒道：“他不知是那里来的个泼物，与我整斗了这两日，何曾言着一个取经的字儿？”又看见行者，道：“这个主子，是他的帮手，好不利害！我不去了。”木叉道：“那是猪八戒，这是孙行者，俱是唐僧的徒弟，俱是菩萨劝化的，怕他怎的？我且和你见唐僧去。”那悟净才收了宝杖，整一整黄锦直裰，跳上岸来，对唐僧双膝跪下道：“师父，弟子有眼无珠，不认得师父的尊容，多有冲撞，万望恕罪。”八戒道：“你这脓包，怎的早不皈依，只管要与我打？是何说话！”行者笑道：“兄弟，你莫怪他，还是我们不曾说出取经的事样与姓名耳。”长老道：“你果肯诚心皈依吾教么？”悟净道：“弟子向蒙菩萨教化，指河为姓，与我起了法名，唤做沙悟净，岂有不从师父之理！”三藏道：“既如此，”叫：“悟空，取戒刀来，与他落了发。”大圣依言，即将戒刀与他剃了头。</p>

<p>又来拜了三藏，拜了行者与八戒，分了大小。三藏见他行礼，真象个和尚家风，故又叫他做沙和尚。木叉道：“既秉了迦持，不必叙烦，早与作法船去来。”那悟净不敢怠慢，即将颈项下挂的骷髅取下，用索子结作九宫，把菩萨葫芦安在当中，请师父下岸。那长老遂登法船，坐于上面，果然稳似轻舟。左有八戒扶持，右有悟净捧托，孙行者在后面牵了龙马半云半雾相跟，头直上又有木叉拥护，那师父才飘然稳渡流沙河界，浪静风平过弱河。真个也如飞似箭，不多时，身登彼岸，得脱洪波，又不拖泥带水，幸喜脚干手燥，清净无为，师徒们脚踏实地。那木叉按祥云，收了葫芦，又只见那骷髅一时解化作九股阴风，寂然不见。三藏拜谢了木叉，顶礼了菩萨。正是木叉径回东洋海，三藏上马却投西。毕竟不知几时才得正果求经，且听下回分解。
