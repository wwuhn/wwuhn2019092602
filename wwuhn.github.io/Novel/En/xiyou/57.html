<P>The Spirit Goes Wild and Wipes Out the Bandits</P>
<P>The Way in Confusion Sends the Mind-Ape Away</P>
</div>
<P>As the poem goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The heart that is empty of all things is said to be pure,</P>
<P>In utter placidity not giving rise to a thought.</P>
<P>The ape and the horse must be tethered, not left to run wild;</P>
<P>The spirit must always be cautious, not seeking for glory.</P>
<P>Wake up to Three Vehicles, wipe out the Six Bandits,</P>
<P>And all human destinies then become clear.</P>
<P>Extinguish the evil of sex and rise to enjoy</P>
<P>The pleasures of paradise that can be found in the West.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story tells how Tang Sanzang bit on the bullet, straggled with all his powers to preserve the purity of his body and was rescued from the Pipa Cave when Monkey and the others killed the scorpion spirit. There is nothing to tell about the next stage of their journey, and it was soon summer again. What they saw was</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Fragrant winds carrying the scent of wild orchids,</P>
<P>New bamboo cool as the skies clear after rain;</P>
<P>No travelers to pick artemisia on the hillside,</P>
<P>And the fragrant flowers of cattails filling the streams.</P>
<P>Bees are bewitched by pomegranates' beauty,</P>
<P>While siskins delight in the willow trees' shade.</P>
<P>How can the wayfarers offer dumplings to Qu Yuan?</P>
<P>Dragon boats should be mourning his death in the river.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Master and disciples were just enjoying the early summer scenery as they spent the day of the Dragonboat Festival without being able to celebrate it when a high mountain rose in front of them to block their way forward. Sanzang reined in his horse and turned back to say, &#8220;Be careful, Wukong: I'm worried that there may be demons on that mountain ahead.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry, Master,&#8221; said Brother Monkey. &#8220;We are all faithful believers. I'm not scared of demons.&#8221; This reply pleased the venerable elder greatly, who</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Whipped on his noble charger,</P>
<P>Gave the dragon steed his head.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Before long they were above a rock-face on the mountain, and when they raised their heads to look around this is what they saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Cypress and pine that touch the azure heavens,</P>
<P>Creepers climbing up hazels on the cliffs.</P>
<P>A hundred thousand feet high,</P>
<P>A thousand sheer-cut strata.</P>
<P>A hundred thousand feet high are the towering pinnacles;</P>
<P>A thousand sheer-cut strata of the chasm's sides.</P>
<P>Mosses and liverwort cover damp rocks,</P>
<P>Locust and juniper form a great forest.</P>
<P>Deep in the forest</P>
<P>Birds are heard unseen,</P>
<P>Singing their songs with beautiful voices.</P>
<P>The water in the brook is a torrent of jade;</P>
<P>The fallen blooms by the path are piles of gold.</P>
<P>The mountain is steep,</P>
<P>The going is hard,</P>
<P>And hardly a pace is on level ground.</P>
<P>Foxes and David's deer come in twos;</P>
<P>White stage and black gibbons greet one in pairs.</P>
<P>The bowl of the tiger fills one with terror;</P>
<P>The call of the crane resounds through the sky.</P>
<P>Plum and red apricot provide one with food;</P>
<P>No names can be put to the many wild flowers.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After climbing the mountain slowly for a long time the four of them crossed the summit, and on the Western slopes they saw a stretch of level sunlit ground. Pig put on a great show of energy, telling Friar Sand to carry the luggage while he raised his rake in both hands and tried to drive the horse ahead. But the horse was not afraid of him and carried on at the same slow pace despite all the noises he made to speed it up.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why are you trying to make the horse go faster, brother?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;Let it walk slowly at its own speed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's getting late,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;and I'm hungry after that day on the mountain. We'd better get a move on and find a house to beg some food from.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case let me speed him up,&#8221; said Monkey waving his gold-banded cudgel and shouting, at which the horse slipped its halter and started to gallop along the track with the speed of an arrow. Do you wonder why the horse was afraid of Monkey but not of Pig? It was because five hundred years earlier Monkey had been given a post in the Imperial Stables in the Daluo Heaven as Protector of the Horses; the name has been passed on right till the present day, which is why all horses are still afraid of monkeys. The venerable elder could not keep hold of the reins: he simply held tight to the saddle and gave the horse its head as it galloped six or seven miles towards some farm land before slowing down to a walk.</P>
<P>As Sanzang was riding along he heard a gong being struck as over thirty men armed with spears, swords and staves emerged from both sides of the track to block his way and say, &#8220;Where do you think you're going, monk?&#8221; This made the Tang Priest shake with fright so badly that he lost his seat and fell off the horse.</P>
<P>&#8220;Spare my life, Your Majesty,&#8221; he pleaded as he squatted in the undergrowth by the path, &#8220;Spare my life.&#8221;</P>
<P>The two chiefs of the gang then said, &#8220;We're not going to kill you. Just give us your money.&#8221; Only then did the venerable elder realize that they were bandits. As he raised his head to look at them this is what he saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>One's blue face and protruding fangs were worse than an evil god's:</P>
<P>The other's bulging eyes were like the Star of Death.</P>
<P>The red hair at their temples seemed ablaze;</P>
<P>Their brownish bristles were as sharp as needles.</P>
<P>Both wore berets of tiger skin.</P>
<P>And kilts of marten fur.</P>
<P>One carried a cudgel with wolf-tooth spikes,</P>
<P>The other a rope of knotted rattan.</P>
<P>They were no less terrible than mountain tigers,</P>
<P>And just as frightening as dragons from the waters.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On seeing how murderous they looked Sanzang could only rise to his feet, put his hands together before his chest, and say, &#8220;Your Majesties, I have been sent by the Tang emperor in the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven. It has been many years since I left Chang'an and all my travelling money was finished long ago. We monks may only support ourselves by begging&#8212;we don't have any money. I beg you, Your Majesties, to show charity and allow me to pass.&#8221; The two bandit chiefs led their men forward and said, &#8220;We here are tigers. The only reason we stop travelers on the main roads is to get rich. Charity doesn't come into it. If you've got no money, take your clothes off and give us that white horse, then we'll let you go on your way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Amitabha Buddha!&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;This habit of mine was begged piece by piece, a bit of cloth from one family and a needle from another. If you take it you will be killing me. If you act as tough guys in this life you'll be reborn as animals in the next.&#8221;</P>
<P>One of the bandit chiefs was so infuriated by this remark that he started to wave his cudgel about and went up to Sanzang to strike him. Unable to speak, Sanzang could only think, &#8220;Poor man, you may think you've got a cudgel: wait till you find out about my disciple's.&#8221; The bandit was in no mood for argument as he raised his cudgel and started to lay about Sanzang. Sanzang, who in all his life had never told a lie, in this desperate crisis had to make one up now: &#8220;Don't hit me, Your Majesties. I have a young disciple following behind me who'll be here soon. He has several ounces of silver that he'll give to you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't hurt the monk,&#8221; said one of the bandit chiefs. &#8220;Tie him up.&#8221; The crowd of bandits then fell upon him, roped him up, and suspended him high from a tree.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The three disaster-bringing spirits were still following behind. Pig was chuckling aloud as he said, &#8220;The master's been going very fast. I don't know where he's waiting for us.&#8221; Then he saw Sanzang in the tree and said, &#8220;Just look at the master, He could have just waited if he'd wanted to, but he was in such high spirits he had to climb a tree and make a swing out of creepers.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop talking nonsense,&#8221; said Monkey when he saw what had happened. &#8220;The master's been hung up there, hasn't he? You two wait for a moment while I go up and look around.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage then rushed up the slope to look around and saw the bandits. &#8220;I'm in luck,&#8221; he thought with glee, &#8220;I'm in luck. Business has brought itself to my front door.&#8221; With that he turned round, shook himself, and turned into a trim little novice of only sixteen wearing a black habit and carrying a bundle wrapped in blue cotton cloth on his shoulder. Then he stepped out until he was by the master and called, &#8220;Master, what's been happening? Who are these wicked people?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Rescue me, disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;and stop asking so many questions.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What's it all about?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;These highwaymen blocked my way and demanded money,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;As I don't have any they hung me up here. I'm waiting for you to work something out. If you can't you'll just have to give them the horse.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're hopeless, Master,&#8221; laughed Monkey. &#8220;Of all the monks in the world there can be few as soft as you. When the Tang Emperor Taizong sent you to worship the Buddha in the Western Heaven he never told you to give that dragon horse away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Whatever was I to do when they hung me up here and were hitting me as they demanded things?&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;What did you say to them?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I was so desperate when they beat me that I had no choice: I had to tell them about you,&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you're useless. Why ever did you squeal on me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I told them that you were carrying some money,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;I only did it in desperation to stop them beating me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Great,&#8221; said Brother Monkey, &#8220;great. Thanks for the recommendation. That just how to squeal on me. You can do that seventy or eighty times a month if you like, and I'll do more business than ever.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the bandits saw Monkey talking to his master they spread out to surround them and said, &#8220;Little monk, get out the money your master told us you're carrying inside your belt and we'll spare your life. But if you even try to say no, you're dead.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't shout, gentlemen,&#8221; said Monkey, putting his bundle down. &#8220;I've got some money in here, but not much&#8212;only twenty horseshoe ingots of gold and twenty or thirty ingots of frosted silver, not counting the smaller pieces. If you want it I'll get the whole packet out as long as you don't hit my master. As the ancient book has it, 'Virtue is the root, and wealth is only the tip of the branch'. This is just the tip of the branch. We men of religion can always find a place to beg. When we meet a benefactor who feeds monks there'll be plenty of money and clothes for us. We don't need much at all. As soon as you've let my master down I'll give you it all.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the bandits heard this they were delighted, and they all said, &#8220;The old monk is stingy, but this little monk is very generous. Let him down.&#8221; Now that his life had been spared the venerable elder leapt on the horse and galloped back the way he had come, making good use of the whip and not giving Monkey another thought.</P>
<P>&#8220;You've gone the wrong way,&#8221; Monkey called out in alarm, then picked up his bundle and started to run after him, only to find his way blocked by the bandits.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where do you think you're going?&#8221; they asked. &#8220;Give us your money or we'll have to torture you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Now we're on that subject,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;we'll have to split the money three ways.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're a bit of a rascal, aren't you, little monk?&#8221; said one of the bandit chiefs. &#8220;You want to keep something without letting your master know. All right then. Bring it all out and we'll have a look at it. If there's a lot we'll let you keep a bit to buy fruit with on the side.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's not what I mean at all, brother,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I haven't got any money. What I mean is that you've got to give me a cut of the gold and silver you two have stolen from other people.&#8221;</P>
<P>This infuriated the bandit chief, who shouted abusively, &#8220;You're asking for it, little monk. Wanting ours instead of giving us yours! Stay where you are and take this.&#8221; He lifted his knotted rattan cane and brought it down on Monkey's head six or seven times.</P>
<P>Monkey pretended not to notice, and his face was wreathed in smiles as he said, &#8220;Brother, if you can only hit me like that you could still be hitting me at the end of next spring and you wouldn't really have hit me at all.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You have a very hard head,&#8221; exclaimed the shocked bandit.</P>
<P>&#8220;No, no, you overpraise me: I just get by with it,&#8221; Monkey replied. With that the discussion was cut short as two or three of the bandits rushed at Monkey and started lashing out at him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Keep your tempers, gentlemen,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;while I get it out.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage then felt in his ear and pulled out an embroidery needle. &#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we monks really don't carry money with us. All I can give you is this needle.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What lousy luck,&#8221; said one of the bandits. &#8220;We've let the rich monk go and kept this bald donkey who's not got a penny to his name. I suppose you do tailoring. A needle's no use to us.&#8221; On hearing that they did not want it Monkey held the needle in<I></I> his hand, waved it, and turned it into a cudgel as thick as a rice bowl.</P>
<P>&#8220;Young you may be, little monk,&#8221; said the terrified bandits, &#8220;but you certainly have some magical powers.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey then thrust the cudgel into the ground and said, &#8220;If any of you gentlemen can move it it's yours.&#8221; The two bandit chiefs rushed up to grab it, but they could no more move it than a dragonfly can move a stone pillar: it did not shift a fraction of an inch. How could those bandits have known that the gold-banded As-You-Will cudgel had been weighed on the scales of Heaven at 13,500 pounds? Then Monkey stepped forward, lifted it effortlessly, spun it in a writhing python movement, pointed it at the robbers and said, &#8220;You're all out of luck: you've met Monkey.&#8221;</P>
<P>The bandit chief rushed at him again and hit him another fifty or sixty times. &#8220;Your hands must be getting tired,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Let me hit you one now, but don't think this is the real thing.&#8221; Watch him as he swings his cudgel, shakes it, and makes it as thick as the top of a well and seventy or eighty feet long. A single blow of it struck one bandit chief to the ground. He bit the dust and said no more.</P>
<P>&#8220;You're pretty cheek there, baldy,&#8221; said the other bandit chief abusively. &#8220;You've got no money, and now you've killed one of us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Just a moment,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile. &#8220;I'm going to kill every one of you and wipe you all out.&#8221; With another swing of his cudgel he killed the other bandit chief, at which all their men threw down their spears and clubs and scattered in terror, fleeing for their lives.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Tang Priest galloped Eastwards until Pig and Friar Sand stopped him and asked, &#8220;Where are you going, Master? This is the wrong way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciples,&#8221; said Sanzang, reining in his horse, &#8220;go back and tell your brother to be merciful with that cudgel of his and not kill all the bandits.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop here, Master,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;I'll go.&#8221; The idiot ran straight back along the path, shouting at the top of his voice, &#8220;Brother, the master says you're not to kill them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Have I killed anyone?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where have the bandits all gone?&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;They've all run away apart from the two chiefs. They're asleep here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You pox-ridden pair,&#8221; said Pig, addressing them, &#8220;no doubt you had a hard night of it and were so exhausted that you had to choose this of all places to sleep.&#8221; Walking closer to them he went on, &#8220;You're like me: you sleep with your mouths open and dribble.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's because I smashed the beancurd out of them with my cudgel,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;But people don't have beancurd in their heads,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;I beat their brains out,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>The moment he heard Monkey say that the idiot turned and rushed straight back to say to the Tang Priest, &#8220;He's scattered them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Splendid, splendid,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;Which way did they go?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He hit them so hard he laid them out,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;They can't go anywhere.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Then what do you mean by scattering them?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;He killed them,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;If that isn't scattering their band, what else is it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How did he hit them?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;He hit two big holes in their heads,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;Open the bundle,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;Take out a few coins, and buy some ointment somewhere to put on their wounds.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're not being at all sensible, Master,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;There's only any point in putting ointment on the wounds of people who are still alive. Why put it on gaping holes in people who are already dead?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Has he really killed them?&#8221; said Sanzang, losing his temper and beginning to mutter abusive remarks about monkeys and macaques as he turned the horse round and rode back with Friar Sand and Pig to where the dead men lay covered with gore, their heads pointing down the mountainside.</P>
<P>The sight was too much for the venerable elder. &#8220;Dig a grave for them with your rake and bury them,&#8221; he told Pig, &#8220;while I say the<I> Burial Sutra</I> for them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're giving the job to the wrong man, Master,&#8221; complained Pig. &#8220;Monkey killed them, so Monkey ought to bury them. Why make me do the digging?&#8221;</P>
<P>Brother Monkey, who was already in a very bad mood after being told off by the master, shouted at Pig, &#8220;Hooligan! Moron! Bury them at once. I'll hit you if you waste any more time.&#8221; This so alarmed the idiot that he started digging with his rake. When he was three feet down he came to a layer of stones that the prongs of his rake could not shift, so he threw the rake aside and rooted about with his snout. In the softer earth he could get two and a half feet down with one push and five feet with two. He then buried the two bodies and piled up a tombmound above them.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;fetch some incense and candles so that I can pray for them and recite sutras.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You understand nothing,&#8221; Monkey retorted, pouting. &#8220;We're in the middle of the mountains with no village or inn for miles around. Where do you expect me to get candles and incense? There's nowhere I could buy them even if I had the money.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Out of my way, ape,&#8221; said Sanzang with fury, &#8220;I am going to scatter earth on the tomb, burn incense and pray.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sanzang dismounted sadly by the tomb in the wild;</P>
<P>The holy monk prayed by the desolate grave.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>These were the words of his invocation:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I bow to you tough guys and ask you to hear my prayer. I am from the land of Tang in the East. At the command of Emperor Taizong I was going to the West to fetch the scriptures when I met you gentlemen here. I do not know what province, prefecture and county you came from to form your band in the mountains here. I spoke to you kindly and pleaded earnestly, but you paid no heed as you repaid good with wrath. Then you encountered Sun the Novice, who killed you with his cudgel. Out of consideration for your bodies left lying in the open I had them buried and a mound piled over them. I broke off some bamboo to serve instead of incense and candles; although they give no light, they come from a sincere heart. Only stones can I offer in place of food: they have no flavor, but they are given in honest faith. When you reach the Underworld to lodge your complaint and look for the roots of your misfortune, remember that his surname is Sun and mine is Chen: they are different. Know who it was who wronged you, just as you would know a debtor, and do not bring a case against the monk who is going to fetch the scriptures.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've shuffled off all the blame,&#8221; said Pig with a laugh. &#8220;We two weren't there either when Monkey killed them.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang then picked up another pinch of earth and prayed again. &#8220;Tough guys, when you bring your case you must only indict Sun the Novice. It was nothing to do with Pig or Friar Sand.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he could not help laughing as he replied, &#8220;Master, you've got no finer feelings at all. Goodness knows what efforts I've been to so that you can fetch your scriptures, but now that I've killed those two bandits you tell them to go and bring a case against me. It's true that I did kill them, but it was only for you. If you hadn't set out to fetch the scriptures and I hadn't become your disciple I'd never have come here and killed them. I'm damned if I don't invoke them, too.&#8221;</P>
<P>He took his iron cudgel, pounded the grave three times, and said, &#8220;Listen to me, pox-ridden bandits. You hit me seven or eight times, then seven or eight times again; you didn't hurt me or even tickle me at all, but you did make me lose my temper. One misunderstanding led to another and I killed you. You can bring a case against me wherever you like&#8212;I'm not scared. The Jade Emperor knows me. The Heavenly Kings do as I say. The Twenty-eight Constellations are afraid of me. The Nine Bright Shiners, the star lords, are scared of me. The city gods of counties and prefectures kneel to me; the God of the Eastern Peak Who Is Equal to Heaven is terrified of me. The Ten Kings of the Underworld used to be my servants. The Five Fierce Gods were once my juniors. The five Commanders of the Three Worlds and the Officers of the Ten Directions are all my very good friends. So go and bring your case wherever you like.&#8221;</P>
<P>Hearing Monkey speak in this most unpleasant way was another shock for Sanzang. &#8220;Disciple,&#8221; he said, &#8220;my prayer was only intended to teach you to spare life and become good and kind. Why do you have to take this all so seriously?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is not something to fool around with, Master,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;We must find somewhere for the night as soon as we can.&#8221; The master had no choice but to hold in his anger and remount.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>With the Great Sage Sun feeling disgruntled and Pig and Friar Sand also suffering from jealousy, master and disciples were only getting on together on the surface: underneath there was hostility. As they carried along their road Westwards a farmhouse came into sight to the North of the track. Pointing at it with the whip Sanzang told them that this was the place where they would find somewhere to spend the night.</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Pig, and they went up to the farm to look at it. It was a fine sight:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Wild flowers on the paths,</P>
<P>Trees shading the doorways.</P>
<P>A mountain stream fell down a distant cliff;</P>
<P>Wheat and mallows grew in the fields.</P>
<P>The reeds moistened by dew were beds for the gulls;</P>
<P>Poplars in the wind were perches for weary birds.</P>
<P>Among blue cypress the pine's green was a rival;</P>
<P>Red rush competed with knotweed in fragrance.</P>
<P>Village dogs barked,</P>
<P>The cocks crowed at dusk,</P>
<P>Well-fed cattle and sheep were led back by boys.</P>
<P>Under clouds of smoke from the stoves the millet was cooked;</P>
<P>Now it was evening in the hill farm.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As the venerable elder went closer an old man came out through the gateway of the farm, noticed Sanzang, and greeted him. &#8220;Where have you come from, monk?&#8221; he asked, to which Sanzang replied, &#8220;I have been sent from the Great Tang in the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven. As I am passing this way and it is getting late I have come to beg a night's lodging from you, benefactor.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It is a very long way indeed from your distinguished country to here,&#8221; the old man replied with a smile, &#8220;so how did you manage to cross so many rivers and climb so many mountains to get here by yourself?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have three disciples who have come with me,&#8221; Sanzang said. &#8220;Where are they?&#8221; the old man asked. &#8220;There they are, standing by the road,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>The old man looked up and was so appalled by their hideous faces that on the instant he turned to run back inside, only to be held back by Sanzang, who said, &#8220;Benefactor, I beg you in your mercy to let us spend the night here.&#8221;</P>
<P>The old man was shivering, barely able to open his mouth, shaking his head and waving his arms around as he said, &#8220;Th...th... th...they're not human. They're e...e...evil spirits.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be afraid, benefactor,&#8221; said Sanzang, putting on a smile. &#8220;They just grew ugly. They're not evil spirits.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But my lord,&#8221; said the old man, &#8220;one's raksha demon, one's a horse-faced devil, and one's a thunder god.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this last remark he shouted at the top of his voice, &#8220;The thunder gods are my grandsons, the rakshas are my great-grandsons, and the horse-faced devils are my great-great-grandsons.&#8221;</P>
<P>This sent the old man's souls flying as he paled and wanted to go in. Sanzang held him up as they went into the thatched main room of the house, and said with a forced smile, &#8220;Don't be afraid of him. They are all rough like that. They don't know how to speak properly.&#8221;</P>
<P>As he was making his explanations a woman came out from the back holding a child of four or five by the hand. &#8220;What has given you such a fright, sir?&#8221; she asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Bring some tea, wife,&#8221; he said, and the woman let go of the child's hand and fetched two cups of tea from the inside. When the tea had been drunk Sanzang stepped down from his seat to greet her and explain, &#8220;I have been sent by Great Tang in the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven. I had just arrived here and was asking for a night's lodging in your distinguished mansion when the sight of my three disciples' ugly faces gave the old gentleman rather a fright.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If the sight of ugly faces gives you such a scare how would you cope if you saw a tiger or a wolf?&#8221; the woman said.</P>
<P>&#8220;Their ugliness I could take, wife,&#8221; the old man replied. &#8220;What terrified me was the way they spoke. When I said they were like a raksha, a horse-faced devil and a thunder god one of them shouted that thunder gods were his grandsons, rakshas his great-grandsons, and horse-faced devils his great-great-grandsons. That was what really terrified me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No need to be frightened,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;no need. The one like a thunder god is my senior disciple Sun Wukong. The one like a horse-faced devil is my second disciple Zhu Wuneng, or Pig. And the one like a raksha is my third disciple Sha Wujing, or Friar Sand. Although they are ugly they are all faithful Buddhists who believe in the true achievement. They are not evil monsters or vicious demons. They are nothing to be afraid of.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the old man and his wife heard who Sanzang was and were told that the disciples were all devout Buddhists their nerves were finally somewhat calmed, and they told Sanzang to invite them in. The venerable elder went to the door to call them over, then told them, &#8220;The old gentleman was really appalled by the sight of you just now. When you go in to see him now you must all be on your best behavior and be very polite to him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm handsome and cultured,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;not rough and noisy like my brothers,&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If it weren't for your long snout, big ears and ugly face you'd be a very good-looking man,&#8221; laughed Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop quarrelling,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;This is hardly the place for a beauty contest. Get inside!&#8221;</P>
<P>With that they carried the luggage and led the horse in, entered the main room, made a respectful call of greeting, and sat down. The good and able wife took the child out and gave orders for rice to be cooked and a vegetarian meal prepared. When master and disciples had eaten it the night was drawing in, so a lamp was fetched and they sat talking in the main room. Only then did Sanzang ask his host's surname.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yang,&#8221; the old man replied, and on being asked his age said he was seventy-three.</P>
<P>&#8220;How many sons do you have?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Only one,&#8221; the old man replied. &#8220;It was my grandson that my wife brought in just now.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Won't you ask your son in? I would like to greet him,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;He's not worth your courtesy, the wretch,&#8221; the old man replied. &#8220;I was fated to raise a worthless son, and he isn't at home now.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where does he make his living?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>The old man nodded and sighed as he replied, &#8220;It's sad story. I would be very happy if he were willing to make an honest living, but his mind is set on evil and he won't work at farming. All he wants to do is to rob houses, hold up travelers, burn and kill. His cronies are all worse than foxes and dogs. He went away five days ago and he hasn't come back.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang did not dare to breathe a word when he heard this, but he thought, &#8220;Perhaps he was one of the ones Wukong killed.&#8221; Feeling very uneasy, he bowed as he sat there. &#8220;Oh dear,&#8221; he said, &#8220;oh dear. How could such good parents have so wicked a son?&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey went up to the old man and said, &#8220;What do you want a rotten son like that for? He's a murderer and a rapist, and he'll get both of you into trouble too. Let me find him and kill him for you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I wish I could be rid of him,&#8221; said the old man, &#8220;but if I did I have no other son. Evil though he is I'll need him to bury me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop meddling in things that are none of your business, brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand and Pig. &#8220;We're not the government. What's it to us if his son's a bad lot? Benefactor, could you give us a bundle of straw to spread out and sleep on over there? We'll be on our way tomorrow morning.&#8221; The old man rose to his feet and sent Friar Sand to take two bundles of rice straw to the yard at the back, where they were to spend the night in a thatched shed. Monkey led the horse and Pig carried the luggage as they took their master to the shed and slept the night there, where we shall leave them.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Now old Mr. Yang's son was indeed one of the bandits who had fled for their lives after Monkey killed their two chiefs on the mountainside the previous morning. Late that night, in the small hours, a group of them gathered together again and knocked at the front gate. Hearing the noise the old man pulled some clothes over his shoulders and said, &#8220;Wife, those damned bandits are here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Then open the gate and let them in,&#8221; she replied. Only then did he open up, and what he saw was a crowd of bandits shouting, &#8220;We're starving, we're staving.&#8221; Old Mr. Yang's son rushed in, and made his wife get up to cook some rice. As there was no firewood in the kitchen he went into the yard to fetch some.</P>
<P>Back in the kitchen he asked his wife, &#8220;Where did the white horse in the yard come from?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There are some monks from the East who are going to get scriptures,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;They asked to stay here last night. Your parents treated them to supper and put them up in the thatched shed.&#8221;</P>
<P>The news made the bandit clap his hands with glee as he came out of the hall saying, &#8220;What a piece of luck, brothers, what a piece of luck. Our enemies are right here in my own home.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What enemies?&#8221; the others all asked.</P>
<P>:The monks who killed our chiefs came here for the night,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;and they're asleep in the shed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Lovely,&#8221; said the other bandits. &#8220;Let's get those bald-headed donkeys. We can chop them all up and pickle them in soy sauce. We'll have their things and their horse and be avenging the chiefs into the bargain.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Take it easy,&#8221; said Yang the bandit. &#8220;You lot go and sharpen your swords while we cook the rice. Let's all have a good feed before we do them in.&#8221; Whereupon the bandits sharpened their swords and their spears.</P>
<P>The old man had heard all this, so he crept stealthily round to the back to tell the Tang Priest and his disciples, &#8220;That evil son of mine has brought the gang here. They know you're here and they want to murder you. Knowing how far you've come I couldn't bear to see you murdered, so please pack your bags as fast as you can. I'll let you out through the back gate.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang, now shivering with fright, kowtowed to the old man in thanks then told Pig to lead the horse while Friar Sand shouldered the carrying pole and Monkey took the nine-ringed monastic staff. The old man opened the back gate to let them out then made his way quietly back to the front to go to bed.</P>
<P>By the time the bandits had sharpened their weapons and eaten a good meal it was the fifth watch and almost dawn. They crowded into the backyard to find their intended victims gone. Quickly lighting lamps and fires they made a long search but could find no traces of them anywhere except that the back gate was open. &#8220;They've got away out the back,&#8221; they all exclaimed. &#8220;After them! Catch them!&#8221;</P>
<P>They all rushed along as fast as arrows, and when the sun rose in the East they finally saw Sanzang, who looked back when he heard shouts and saw a crowd of twenty or thirty men armed with spears and swords coming after him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciples,&#8221; he called, &#8220;the bandits have caught up with us. Whatever shall we do?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'll finish them off.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said Sanzang, reining in his horse, &#8220;you're not to hurt them. Just scare them off.&#8221;</P>
<P>Not a blind bit of notice did Monkey take of this as he swung his cudgel and turned to face them. &#8220;Where do you gentlemen think you're going?&#8221; he asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Bloody baldies,&#8221; they shouted back abusively, ringing Monkey in a circle, &#8220;give us back our chiefs.&#8221; When they started thrusting and hacking at him with their spears and swords the Great Sage whirled his cudgel once around, made it as thick as a ricebowl, and scattered the lot of them. Those who took the full impact of it were killed outright; glancing blows broke bones, and even a touch left an open wound. A few of the nimbler ones managed a getaway, but the slower ones all had to pay their respects to King Yama in the Underworld.</P>
<P>At the sight of so many people being struck down a panic-stricken Sanzang made his horse gallop West as fast as it could, with Pig and Friar Sand rushing along beside. &#8220;Which of you is old Yang's boy?&#8221; Monkey asked the wounded bandits who were still alive.</P>
<P>&#8220;The one in yellow, my lord,&#8221; they groaned.</P>
<P>Monkey went over, took his sword from him, and sliced off his head. Holding the gory head in his hand he put his cudgel away and caught up with the Tang Priest by cloud. &#8220;Master,&#8221; he said, waving the head in front of the horse, &#8220;here's the head of old Yang's wicked son.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang, pale with horror, fell out of the saddle. &#8220;Evil macaque,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you will be the death of me, terrifying me like that. Take it away at once.&#8221; Pig kicked the head to the side of the path and buried it with his rake.</P>
<P>&#8220;Do get up, Master,&#8221; said Friar Sand, putting down the carrying pole and supporting the Tang Priest. Pulling himself together as he sat there on the ground the venerable elder started to recite the Band-tightening Spell. Monkey's skull was squeezed so tight that his face and ears turned bright red, his eyes bulged and his head ached. &#8220;Stop! Stop!&#8221; he pleaded, rolling around in agony, but even when Sanzang had said it a dozen times or more he still carried on.</P>
<P>In his unbearable agony Monkey turned somersaults and stood on his head, screaming, &#8220;Forgive me, Master. Say what you have to say. Stop, stop!&#8221; Only then did Sanzang stop reciting the spell.</P>
<P>&#8220;I've nothing to say to you,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I don't want you with me any more. Go back.&#8221; Kowtowing despite his pain, Monkey asked, &#8220;Master, why are you sending me away?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wicked ape,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;you're too much of a murderer to fetch scriptures. I gave it to you yesterday for your cruelty in killing the two bandit chiefs on the mountainside. When we reached the old gentleman's house late yesterday evening he gave us a meal and a night's lodging, and we only got away with our lives because he helped us to escape through the back gate. Even though his son was a bad lot that was none of our business, and it was wrong of you to cut off his head, to say nothing of all the other lives you destroyed. Goodness knows how much you have damaged the harmony of heaven and earth. Despite my repeated advice there is not a shred of goodness in you. I do not need yon at all. Clear off at once if you don't want me to say the spell again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't say it, don't say it,&#8221; pleaded Monkey in terror, &#8220;I'm going.&#8221; No sooner had the words left his mouth than he disappeared without a trace on his somersault cloud. Alas!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the mind is full of murder,</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cinnabar cannot be treated.</P>
<P>If the spirit is in disorder,</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Way stays uncompleted.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know where the Great Sage had gone listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>神狂诛草寇</p>
<p>道昧放心猿</p>
</div>
<p>诗曰：灵台无物谓之清，寂寂全无一念生。猿马牢收休放荡，精神谨慎莫峥嵘。除六贼，悟三乘，万缘都罢自分明。色邪永灭超真界，坐享西方极乐城。话说唐三藏咬钉嚼铁，以死命留得一个不坏之身，感蒙行者等打死蝎子精，救出琵琶洞。一路无词，又早是朱明时节，但见那：熏风时送野兰香，濯雨才晴新竹凉。艾叶满山无客采，蒲花盈涧自争芳。海榴娇艳游蜂喜，溪柳阴浓黄雀狂。长路那能包角黍，龙舟应吊汨罗江。他师徒们行赏端阳之景，虚度中天之节，忽又见一座高山阻路。长老勒马回头叫道：“悟空，前面有山，恐又生妖怪，是必谨防。”行者等道：“师父放心，我等皈命投诚，怕甚妖怪！”长老闻言甚喜，加鞭催骏马，放辔趱蛟龙。须臾上了山崖，举头观看，真个是：顶巅松柏接云青，石壁荆榛挂野藤。万丈崔巍，千层悬削。</p>

<p>万丈崔巍峰岭峻，千层悬削壑崖深。苍苔碧藓铺阴石，古桧高槐结大林。林深处，听幽禽，巧声襕睆实堪吟。涧内水流如泻玉，路旁花落似堆金。山势恶，不堪行，十步全无半步平。狐狸糜鹿成双遇，白鹿玄猿作对迎。忽闻虎啸惊人胆，鹤鸣振耳透天庭。黄梅红杏堪供食，野草闲花不识名。</p>

<p>四众进山，缓行良久，过了山头，下西坡，乃是一段平阳之地。猪八戒卖弄精神，教沙和尚挑着担子，他双手举钯，上前赶马。那马更不惧他，凭那呆子嗒笞笞的赶，只是缓行不紧。行者道：“兄弟，你赶他怎的？让他慢慢走罢了。”八戒道：“天色将晚，自上山行了这一日，肚里饿了，大家走动些，寻个人家化些斋吃。”行者闻言道：“既如此，等我教他快走。”把金箍棒幌一幌，喝了一声，那马溜了缰，如飞似箭，顺平路往前去了。你说马不怕八戒，只怕行者何也？行者五百年前曾受玉帝封在大罗天御马监养马，官名弼马温，故此传留至今，是马皆惧猴子。那长老挽不住缰口，只扳紧着鞍桥，让他放了一路辔头，有二十里向开田地，方才缓步而行。</p>

<p>正走处，忽听得一棒锣声，路两边闪出三十多人，一个个枪刀棍棒，拦住路口道：“和尚！那里走！”唬得个唐僧战兢兢，坐不稳，跌下马来，蹲在路旁草科里，只叫：“大王饶命！大王饶命！”那为头的两个大汉道：“不打你，只是有盘缠留下。”长老方才省悟，知他是伙强人，却欠身抬头观看，但见他：一个青脸獠牙欺太岁，一个暴睛圆眼赛丧门。鬓边红发如飘火，颔下黄须似插针。他两个头戴虎皮花磕脑，腰系貂裘彩战裙。一个手中执着狼牙棒，一个肩上横担扢挞藤。果然不亚巴山虎，真个犹如出水龙。三藏见他这般凶恶，只得走起来，合掌当胸道：</p>

<p>“大王，贫僧是东土唐王差往西天取经者，自别了长安，年深日久，就有些盘缠也使尽了。出家人专以乞化为由，那得个财帛？</p>

<p>万望大王方便方便，让贫僧过去罢！”那两个贼帅众向前道：</p>

<p>“我们在这里起一片虎心，截住要路，专要些财帛，甚么方便方便？你果无财帛，快早脱下衣服，留下白马，放你过去！”三藏道：“阿弥陀佛！贫僧这件衣服，是东家化布，西家化针，零零碎碎化来的。你若剥去，可不害杀我也？只是这世里做得好汉，那世里变畜生哩！”那贼闻言大怒，掣大棍，上前就打。这长老口内不言，心中暗想道：“可怜！你只说你的棍子，还不知我徒弟的棍子哩！”那贼那容分说，举着棒，没头没脸的打来。长老一生不会说谎，遇着这急难处，没奈何，只得打个诳语道：“二位大王，且莫动手，我有个小徒弟，在后面就到。他身上有几两银子，把与你罢。”那贼道：“这和尚是也吃不得亏，且捆起来。”</p>

<p>众娄罗一齐下手，把一条绳捆了，高高吊在树上。</p>

<p>却说三个撞祸精，随后赶来。八戒呵呵大笑道：“师父去得好快，不知在那里等我们哩。”忽见长老在树上，他又说：“你看师父，等便罢了，却又有这般心肠，爬上树去，扯着藤儿打秋千耍子哩！”行者见了道：“呆子，莫乱谈。师父吊在那里不是？你两个慢来，等我去看看。”好大圣，急登高坡细看，认得是伙强人，心中暗喜道：“造化！造化！买卖上门了！”即转步，摇身一变，变做个干干净净的小和尚，穿一领缁衣，年纪只有二八，肩上背着一个蓝布包袱，拽开步，来到前边，叫道：“师父，这是怎么说话？这都是些甚么歹人？”三藏道：“徒弟呀，还不救我一救，还问甚的？”行者道：“是干甚勾当的？”三藏道：“这一伙拦路的，把我拦住，要买路钱。因身边无物，遂把我吊在这里，只等你来计较计较，不然，把这匹马送与他罢。”行者闻言笑道：</p>

<p>“师父不济，天下也有和尚，似你这样皮松的却少。唐太宗差你往西天见佛，谁教你把这龙马送人？”三藏道：“徒弟呀，似这等吊起来，打着要，怎生是好？”行者道：“你怎么与他说来？”三藏道：“他打的我急了，没奈何，把你供出来也。”行者道：“师父，你好没搭撒，你供我怎的？”三藏道：“我说你身边有些盘缠，且教道莫打我，是一时救难的话儿。”行者道：“好！好！好！承你抬举，正是这样供。若肯一个月供得七八十遭，老孙越有买卖。”</p>

<p>那伙贼见行者与他师父讲话，撒开势，围将上来道：“小和尚，你师父说你腰里有盘缠，趁早拿出来，饶你们性命！若道半个不字，就都送了你的残生！”行者放下包袱道：“列位长官，不要嚷。盘缠有些在此包袱，不多，只有马蹄金二十来锭，粉面银二三十锭，散碎的未曾见数。要时就连包儿拿去，切莫打我师父。古书云，德者本也，财者末也，此是末事。我等出家人，自有化处。若遇着个斋僧的长者，衬钱也有，衣服也有，能用几何？只望放下我师父来，我就一并奉承。”那伙贼闻言，都甚欢喜道：“这老和尚悭吝，这小和尚倒还慷慨。”教：“放下来。”那长老得了性命，跳上马，顾不得行者，操着鞭，一直跑回旧路。</p>

<p>行者忙叫道：“走错路了。”提着包袱，就要追去。那伙贼拦住道：“那里走？将盘缠留下，免得动刑！”行者笑道：“说开，盘缠须三分分之。”那贼头道：“这小和尚忒乖，就要瞒着他师父留起些儿。也罢，拿出来看。若多时，也分些与你背地里买果子吃。”行者道：“哥呀，不是这等说。我那里有甚盘缠？说你两个打劫别人的金银，是必分些与我。”那贼闻言大怒，骂道：“这和尚不知死活！你倒不肯与我，返回我要！不要走！看打！”轮起一条扢挞藤棍，照行者光头上打了七八下。行者只当不知，且满面陪笑道：“哥呀，若是这等打，就打到来年打罢春，也是不当真的。”那贼大惊道：“这和尚好硬头！”行者笑道：“不敢不敢，承过奖了，也将就看得过。”那贼那容分说，两三个一齐乱打，行者道：“列位息怒，等我拿出来。”好大圣，耳中摸一摸，拔出一个绣花针儿道：“列位，我出家人，果然不曾带得盘缠，只这个针儿送你罢。”那贼道：“晦气呀！把一个富贵和尚放了，却拿住这个穷秃驴！你好道会做裁缝？我要针做甚的？”行者听说不要，就拈在手中，幌了一幌，变作碗来粗细的一条棍子。那贼害怕道：“这和尚生得小，倒会弄术法儿。”行者将棍子插在地下道：“列位拿得动，就送你罢。”两个贼上前抢夺，可怜就如蜻蜓撼石柱，莫想弄动半分毫。这条棍本是如意金箍棒，天秤称的，一万三千五百斤重，那伙贼怎么知得？大圣走上前，轻轻的拿起，丢一个蟒翻身拗步势，指着强人道：“你都造化低，遇着我老孙了！”那贼上前来，又打了五六十下。行者笑道：“你也打得手困了，且让老孙打一棒儿，却休当真。”你看他展开棍子，幌一幌，有井栏粗细，七八丈长短，荡的一棍，把一个打倒在地，嘴唇揞土，再不做声。那一个开言骂道：“这秃厮老大无礼！盘缠没有，转伤我一个人！”行者笑道：“且消停，且消停！待我一个个打来，一发教你断了根罢！”荡的又一棍，把第二个又打死了，唬得那众娄罗撇枪弃棍，四路逃生而走。</p>

<p>却说唐僧骑着马，往东正跑，八戒、沙僧拦住道：“师父往那里去？错走路了。”长老兜马道：“徒弟啊，趁早去与你师兄说，教他棍下留情，莫要打杀那些强盗。”八戒道：“师父住下，等我去来。”呆子一路跑到前边，厉声高叫道：“哥哥，师父教你莫打人哩。”行者道：“兄弟，那曾打人？”八戒道：“那强盗往那里去了？”行者道：“别个都散了，只是两个头儿在这里睡觉哩。”八戒笑道：“你两个遭瘟的，好道是熬了夜，这般辛苦，不往别处睡，却睡在此处！”呆子行到身边，看看道：“倒与我是一起的，干净张着口睡，淌出些粘涎来了。”行者道：“是老孙一棍子打出豆腐来了。”八戒道：“人头上又有豆腐？”行者道：“打出脑子来了！”八戒听说打出脑子来，慌忙跑转去，对唐僧道：“散了伙也！”三藏道：“善哉！善哉！往那条路上去了？”八戒道：</p>

<p>“打也打得直了脚，又会往那里去走哩！”三藏道：“你怎么说散伙？”八戒道：“打杀了，不是散伙是甚的？”三藏问：“打的怎么模样？”八戒道：“头上打了两个大窟窿。”三藏教：“解开包，取几文衬钱，快去那里讨两个膏药与他两个贴贴。”八戒笑道：</p>

<p>“师父好没正经，膏药只好贴得活人的疮肿，那里好贴得死人的窟窿？”三藏道：“真打死了？”就恼起来，口里不住的絮絮叨叨，猢狲长，猴子短，兜转马，与沙僧、八戒至死人前，见那血淋淋的，倒卧山坡之下。</p>

<p>这长老甚不忍见，即着八戒：“快使钉钯，筑个坑子埋了，我与他念卷倒头经。”八戒道：“师父左使了人也。行者打杀人，还该教他去烧埋，怎么教老猪做土工？”行者被师父骂恼了，喝着八戒道：“泼懒夯货！趁早儿去埋！迟了些儿，就是一棍！”呆子慌了，往山坡下筑了有三尺深，下面都是石脚石根，扛住钯齿，呆子丢了钯，便把嘴拱，拱到软处，一嘴有二尺五，两嘴有五尺深，把两个贼尸埋了，盘作一个坟堆。三藏叫：“悟空，取香烛来，待我祷祝，好念经。”行者努着嘴道：“好不知趣！这半山之中，前不巴村，后不着店，那讨香烛？就有钱也无处去买。”三藏恨恨的道：“猴头过去！等我撮土焚香祷告。”这是三藏离鞍悲野冢，圣僧善念祝荒坟，祝云：“拜惟好汉，听祷原因：念我弟子，东土唐人。奉太宗皇帝旨意，上西方求取经文。适来此地，逢尔多人，不知是何府、何州、何县，都在此山内结党成群。我以好话，哀告殷勤。尔等不听，返善生嗔。却遭行者，棍下伤身。</p>

<p>切念尸骸暴露，吾随掩土盘坟。折青竹为香烛，无光彩，有心勤；取顽石作施食，无滋味，有诚真。你到森罗殿下兴词，倒树寻根，他姓孙，我姓陈，各居异姓。冤有头，债有主，切莫告我取经僧人。”八戒笑道：“师父推了干净，他打时却也没有我们两个。”三藏真个又撮土祷告道：“好汉告状，只告行者，也不干八戒、沙僧之事。”大圣闻言，忍不住笑道：“师父，你老人家忒没情义。为你取经，我费了多少殷勤劳苦，如今打死这两个毛贼，你倒教他去告老孙。虽是我动手打，却也只是为你。你不往西天取经，我不与你做徒弟，怎么会来这里，会打杀人！索性等我祝他一祝。”攥着铁棒，望那坟上捣了三下，道：“遭瘟的强盗，你听着！我被你前七八棍，后七八棍，打得我不疼不痒的，触恼了性子，一差二误，将你打死了，尽你到那里去告，我老孙实是不怕：玉帝认得我，天王随得我；二十八宿惧我，九曜星官怕我；府县城隍跪我，东岳天齐怖我；十代阎君曾与我为仆从，五路猖神曾与我当后生；不论三界五司，十方诸宰，都与我情深面熟，随你那里去告！”三藏见说出这般恶话，却又心惊道：“徒弟呀，我这祷祝是教你体好生之德，为良善之人，你怎么就认真起来？”行者道：“师父，这不是好耍子的勾当，且和你赶早寻宿去。”那长老只得怀嗔上马。</p>

<p>孙大圣有不睦之心，八戒、沙僧亦有嫉妒之意，师徒都面是背非，依大路向西正走，忽见路北下有一座庄院。三藏用鞭指定道：“我们到那里借宿去。”八戒道：“正是。”遂行至庄舍边下马。看时，却也好个住场，但见：野花盈径，杂树遮扉。远岸流山水，平畦种麦葵。蒹葭露润轻鸥宿，杨柳风微倦鸟栖。青柏间松争翠碧，红蓬映蓼斗芳菲。村犬吠，晚鸡啼，牛羊食饱牧童归。爨烟结雾黄粱熟，正是山家入暮时。长老向前，忽见那村舍门里走出一个老者，即与相见，道了问讯。那老者问道：</p>

<p>“僧家从那里来？”三藏道：“贫僧乃东土大唐钦差往西天求经者。适路过宝方，天色将晚，特来檀府告宿一宵。”老者笑道：</p>

<p>“你贵处到我这里，程途迢递，怎么涉水登山，独自到此？”三藏道：“贫僧还有三个徒弟同来。”老者问：“高徒何在？”三藏用手指道：“那大路旁立的便是。”老者猛抬头，看见他们面貌丑陋，急回身往里就走，被三藏扯住道：“老施主，千万慈悲，告借一宿！”老者战兢兢钳口难言，摇着头，摆着手道：“不不不不象人模样！是是是几个妖精！”三藏陪笑道：“施主切休恐惧，我徒弟生得是这等相貌，不是妖精！”老者道：“爷爷呀，一个夜叉，一个马面，一个雷公！”行者闻言，厉声高叫道：“雷公是我孙子，夜叉是我重孙，马面是我玄孙哩！”那老者听见，魄散魂飞，面容失色，只要进去。三藏搀住他，同到草堂，陪笑道：“老施主，不要怕他。他都是这等粗鲁，不会说话。”</p>

<p>正劝解处，只见后面走出一个婆婆，携着五六岁的一个小孩儿，道：“爷爷，为何这般惊恐？”老者才叫：“妈妈，看茶来。”</p>

<p>那婆婆真个丢了孩儿，入里面捧出二锺茶来。茶罢，三藏却转下来，对婆婆作礼道：“贫僧是东土大唐差往西天取经的，才到贵处，拜求尊府借宿，因是我三个徒弟貌丑，老家长见了虚惊也。”婆婆道：“见貌丑的就这等虚惊，若见了老虎豺狼，却怎么好？”老者道：“妈妈呀，人面丑陋还可，只是言语一发吓人。我说他象夜叉马面雷公，他吆喝道，雷公是他孙子，夜叉是他重孙，马面是他玄孙。我听此言，故然悚惧。”唐僧道：“不是不是，象雷公的是我大徒孙悟空，象马面的是我二徒猪悟能，象夜叉的是我三徒沙悟净。他们虽是丑陋，却也秉教沙门，皈依善果，不是甚么恶魔毒怪，怕他怎么！”公婆两个，闻说他名号皈正沙门之言，却才定性回惊，教：“请来，请来。”长老出门叫来，又吩咐道：“适才这老者甚恶你等，今进去相见，切勿抗礼，各要尊重些。”八戒道：“我俊秀，我斯文，不比师兄撒泼。”行者笑道：</p>

<p>“不是嘴长，耳大、脸丑，便也是一个好男子。”沙僧道：“莫争讲，这里不是那抓乖弄俏之处，且进去！且进去！”</p>

<p>遂此把行囊马匹，都到草堂上，齐同唱了个喏，坐定。那妈妈儿贤慧，即便携转小儿，咐吩煮饭，安排一顿素斋，他师徒吃了。渐渐晚了，又掌起灯来，都在草堂上闲叙。长老才问：“施主高姓？”老者道：“姓杨。”又问年纪。老者道：“七十四岁。”又问：“几位令郎？”老者道：“止得一个，适才妈妈携的是小孙。”</p>

<p>长老：“请令郎相见拜揖。”老者道：“那厮不中拜。老拙命苦，养不着他，如今不在家了。”三藏道：“何方生理？”老者点头而叹：</p>

<p>“可怜！可怜！若肯何方生理，是吾之幸也！那厮专生恶念，不务本等，专好打家截道，杀人放火！相交的都是些狐群狗党！自五日之前出去，至今未回。”三藏闻说，不敢言喘，心中暗想道：</p>

<p>“或者悟空打杀的就是也。”长老神思不安，欠身道：“善哉！善哉！如此贤父母，何生恶逆儿！”行者近前道：“老官儿，似这等不良不肖、奸盗邪淫之子，连累父母，要他何用！等我替你寻他来打杀了罢。”老者道：“我待也要送了他，奈何再无以次人丁，纵是不才，一定还留他与老汉掩土。”沙僧与八戒笑道：“师兄，莫管闲事，你我不是官府。他家不肖，与我何干！且告施主，见赐一束草儿，在那厢打铺睡觉，天明走路。”老者即起身，着沙僧到后园里拿两个稻草，教他们在园中草团瓢内安歇。行者牵了马，八戒挑了行李，同长老俱到团瓢内安歇不题。</p>

<p>却说那伙贼内果有老杨的儿子。自天早在山前被行者打死两个贼首，他们都四散逃生，约摸到四更时候，又结坐一伙，在门前打门。老者听得门响，即披衣道：“妈妈，那厮们来也。”</p>

<p>妈妈道：“既来，你去开门，放他来家。”老者方才开门，只见那一伙贼都嚷道：“饿了！饿了！”这老杨的儿子忙入里面，叫起他妻来，打米煮饭。却厨下无柴，往后园里拿柴到厨房里，问妻道：“后园里白马是那里的？”其妻道：“是东土取经的和尚，昨晚至此借宿，公公婆婆管待他一顿晚斋，教他在草团瓢内睡哩。”那厮闻言，走出草堂，拍手打掌笑道：“兄弟们，造化！造化！冤家在我家里也！”众贼道：“那个冤家？”那厮道：“却是打死我们头儿的和尚，来我家借宿，现睡在草团瓢里。”众贼道：</p>

<p>“却好！却好！拿住这些秃驴，一个个剁成肉酱，一则得那行囊白马，二来与我们头儿报仇！”那厮道：“且莫忙，你们且去磨刀。等我煮饭熟了，大家吃饱些，一齐下手。”真个那些贼磨刀的磨刀，磨枪的磨枪。那老儿听得此言，悄悄的走到后园，叫起唐僧四位道：“那厮领众来了，知得汝等在此，意欲图害，我老拙念你远来，不忍伤害，快早收拾行李，我送你往后门出去罢！”三藏听说，战兢兢的叩头谢了老者，即唤八戒牵马，沙僧挑担，行者拿了九环锡杖。老者开后门，放他去了，依旧悄悄的来前睡下。</p>

<p>却说那厮们磨快了刀枪，吃饱了饭食，时已五更天气，一齐来到园中看处，却不见了。即忙点灯着火，寻彀多时，四无踪迹，但见后门开着，都道：“从后门走了！走了！”发一声喊，“赶将上拿来。”一个个如飞似箭，直赶到东方日出，却才望见唐僧。那长老忽听得喊声，回头观看，后面有二三十人，枪刀簇簇而来，便叫：“徒弟啊，贼兵追至，怎生奈何！”行者道：“放心！放心！老孙了他去来！”三藏勒马道：“悟空，切莫伤人，只吓退他便罢。”行者那肯听信，急掣棒回首相迎道：“列位那里去？”众贼骂道：“秃厮无礼！还我大王的命来！”那厮们圈子阵把行者围在中间，举枪刀乱砍乱搠。这大圣把金箍棒幌一幌，碗来粗细，把那伙贼打得星落云散，汤着的就死，挽着的就亡；搕着的骨折，擦着的皮伤，乖些的跑脱几个，痴些的都见阎王！</p>

<p>三藏在马上，见打倒许多人，慌的放马奔西。猪八戒与沙和尚，紧随鞭镫而去。行者问那不死带伤的贼人道：“那个是那杨老儿的儿子？”那贼哼哼的告道：“爷爷，那穿黄的是！”行者上前，夺过刀来，把个穿黄的割下头来，血淋淋提在手中，收了铁棒，拽开云步，赶到唐僧马前，提着头道：“师父，这是杨老儿的逆子，被老孙取将首级来也。”三藏见了，大惊失色，慌得跌下马来，骂道：“这泼猢狲唬杀我也！快拿过！快拿过！”八戒上前，将人头一脚踢下路旁，使钉钯筑些土盖了。沙僧放下担子，搀着唐僧道：“师父请起。”那长老在地下正了性，心中念起《紧箍儿咒》来，把个行者勒得耳红面赤，眼胀头昏，在地下打滚，只教：“莫念！莫念！”那长老念彀有十余遍，还不住口。行者翻筋斗，竖蜻蜓，疼痛难禁，只叫：“师父饶我罪罢！有话便说，莫念！莫念！”三藏却才住口道：“没话说，我不要你跟了，你回去罢！”行者忍疼磕头道：“师父，怎的就赶我去耶？”三藏道：“你这泼猴，凶恶太甚，不是个取经之人。昨日在山坡下，打死那两个贼头，我已怪你不仁。及晚了到老者之家，蒙他赐斋借宿，又蒙他开后门放我等逃了性命，虽然他的儿子不肖，与我无干，也不该就枭他首，况又杀死多人，坏了多少生命，伤了天地多少和气。屡次劝你，更无一毫善念，要你何为！快走！快走！免得又念真言！”行者害怕，只教：“莫念，莫念！我去也！”说声去，一路筋斗云，无影无踪，遂不见了。咦！这正是：心有凶狂丹不熟，神无定位道难成。毕竟不知那大圣投向何方，且听下回分解。</p>
