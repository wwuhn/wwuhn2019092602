<P>The Mind-Ape Returns to Truth</P>
<P>The Six Bandits Disappear Without Trace</P>

<div class="poet">
<P>Buddha is the mind, the mind is Buddha,</P>
<P>Mind and Buddha have always needed things.</P>
<P>When you know that there are no things and no mind</P>
<P>Then you are a Buddha with a true mind and a Dharma body.</P>


<P>A Dharma-bodied Buddha has no form;</P>
<P>A single divine light contains the ten thousand images.</P>
<P>The bodiless body is the true body.</P>
<P>The imageless image is the real image.</P>


<P>It is not material, not empty, and not non-empty;</P>
<P>It does not come or go, nor does it return.</P>
<P>It is not different nor the same, it neither is nor isn't.</P>
<P>It can't be thrown away or caught, nor seen or heard.</P>


<P>The inner and outer divine light are everywhere the same;</P>
<P>A Buddha-kingdom can be found in a grain of sand.</P>
<P>A grain of sand can hold a thousand worlds;</P>
<P>In a single body and mind, all dharmas are the same.</P>


<P>For wisdom, the secret of no-mind is essential,</P>
<P>To be unsullied and unobstructed is to be pure of karma.</P>
<P>When you do no good and do no evil,</P>
<P>You become a Kasyapa Buddha.</P>

<p>佛即心兮心即佛，心佛从来皆要物。</p>
<p>若知无物又无心，便是真如法身佛。</p>

<p>法身佛，没模样，一颗圆光涵万象。</p>
<p>无体之体即真体，无相之相即实相。</p>

<p>非色非空非不空，不来不向不回向。</p>
<p>无异无同无有无，难舍难取难听望。</p>

<p>内外灵光到处同，一佛国在一沙中。</p>

<P>The terror-stricken Liu Boqin and Sanzang then heard another shout of &#8220;My master's come.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That must be the old monkey who lives in a stone cell under this mountain shouting,&#8221; said the servants.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said the high warden.</P>
<P>&#8220;What old monkey?&#8221; asked Sanzang, and the high warden replied, &#8220;This mountain used to be called Five Elements Mountain, and its name was only changed to Double Boundary Mountain when our Great Tang Emperor fought his Western campaign to pacify the country. I once heard an old man say that in the days when Wang Mang usurped the Han throne, Heaven sent down this mountain and crushed a monkey under it. This monkey doesn't mind heat or cold and neither eats nor drinks. He's guarded by a local tutelary god who gives him iron pellets when he's hungry and molten copper when he's thirsty. Although he's been there since ancient times, he hasn't died of cold or hunger. It must have been him shouting; there's nothing for you to be afraid of, venerable sir. Let's go down and have a look.&#8221; Sanzang had to follow him, leading his horse down the mountain.</P>
<P>A mile or two later they saw that there really was a monkey poking out his head out of a stone cell, and making desperate gestures with his outstretched hands as he shouted, &#8220;Master, why didn't you come before? Thank goodness you're here, thank goodness. If you get me out of here I guarantee that you'll reach the Western Heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>Do you know what the venerable monk saw when he went forward for a closer look?</P>

<div class="right">
<p>却说那刘伯钦与唐三藏惊惊慌慌，又闻得叫声师父来也。众家僮道：“这叫的必是那山脚下石匣中老猿。”太保道：“是他，是他！”三藏问：“是什么老猿？”太保道：“这山旧名五行山，因我大唐王征西定国，改名两界山。先年间曾闻得老人家说：‘王莽篡汉之时，天降此山，下压着一个神猴，不怕寒暑，不吃饮食，自有土神监押，教他饥餐铁丸，渴饮铜汁。自昔到今，冻饿不死。’这叫必定是他。长老莫怕，我们下山去看来。”三藏只得依从，牵马下山。行不数里，只见那石匣之间，果有一猴，露着头，伸着手，乱招手道：“师父，你怎么此时才来？来得好，来得好！救我出来，我保你上西天去也！”这长老近前细看，你道他是怎生模样——</p>

<P>High warden Liu showed great courage in going up to him, pulling away the grass that was growing beside his temples and the sedge under his chin, and asking, &#8220;What have you got to say?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've got nothing to say,&#8221; the monkey replied. &#8220;You just tell that monk to come over here while I ask him a question.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What question do you want to ask me?&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;Are you the fellow sent to the Western Heaven by the Emperor of the East to fetch the scriptures?&#8221; asked the monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, I am,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;Why do you ask?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am the Great Sage Equaling Heaven who wrecked the Heavenly Palace five hundred years ago. The Lord Buddha put me under this mountain for my criminal insubordination. Some time ago the Bodhisattva Guanyin went to the East on the Buddha's orders to find someone who could fetch the scriptures. When I asked her to save me she told me that I was to give up evil-doing, return to the Buddha's Law, and do all I could to protect the traveler when he went to the Western Paradise to worship Buddha and fetch the scriptures; she said that there'll something in it for me when that's done. Ever since then I've been waiting day and night with eager anticipation for you to come and save me, Master. I swear to protect you on your way to fetch the scriptures and to be your disciple.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang, delighted to hear this, said, &#8220;Although you now have these splendid intentions and wish to become a monk thanks to the teaching of the Bodhisattva, I've no axe or chisel, so how am I to get you out?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no need for axes or chisels. As long as you're willing to save me, I can get myself out,&#8221; the monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm willing to save you,&#8221; Sanzang said, &#8220;but how are you going to get out?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;On the top of this mountain there is a detention order by the Tathagata Buddha written in letters of gold. If you climb the mountain and tear it off, I'll be straight out.&#8221; Accepting his suggestion, Sanzang turned round to ask Liu Boqin if he would go up the mountain with him.</P>

<P>&#8220;I don't know whether he's telling the truth or not,&#8221; said Boqin, at which the monkey shouted at the top of his voice, &#8220;It's true. I wouldn't dare lie about that.&#8221;</P>
<P>So Liu Boqin told his servants to lead the horse while he helped Sanzang up the mountain. By hanging on to creepers they managed to reach the summit, where they saw a myriad beams of golden light and a thousand wisps of propitious vapour coming from a large, square rock on which was pasted a paper seal bearing the golden words<I> Om mani padme hum.</I> Sanzang went up and knelt down before the rock, then read the golden words and bowed his head to the ground a number of times.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>这太保诚然胆大，走上前来，与他拔去了鬓边草，颔下莎，问道：“你有什么说话？”那猴道：“我没话说，教那个师父上来，我问他一问。”三藏道：“你问我什么？”那猴道：“你可是东土大王差往西天取经去的么？”三藏道：“我正是，你问怎么？”那猴道：“我是五百年前大闹天宫的齐天大圣，只因犯了诳上之罪，被佛祖压于此处。前者有个观音菩萨，领佛旨意，上东土寻取经人。我教他救我一救，他劝我再莫行凶，归依佛法，尽殷勤保护取经人，往西方拜佛，功成后自有好处。故此昼夜提心，晨昏吊胆，只等师父来救我脱身。我愿保你取经，与你做个徒弟。”三藏闻言，满心欢喜道：“你虽有此善心，又蒙菩萨教诲，愿入沙门，只是我又没斧凿，如何救得你出？”那猴道：“不用斧凿，你但肯救我，我自出来也。”三藏道：“我自救你，你怎得出来？”那猴道：“这山顶上有我佛如来的金字压帖。你只上山去将帖儿揭起，我就出来了。”三藏依言，回头央浼刘伯钦道：“太保啊，我与你上山走一遭。”伯钦道：“不知真假何如！”那猴高叫道：“是真！决不敢虚谬！”伯钦只得呼唤家僮，牵了马匹。他却扶着三藏，复上高山，攀藤附葛，只行到那极巅之处，果然见金光万道，瑞气千条，有块四方大石，石上贴着一封皮，却是“唵嘛呢叭嵒牜”六个金字。</p>

<P>He looked to the West and prayed, &#8220;I am the believer Chen Xuanzang sent on imperial orders to fetch the scriptures. If I am fated to have a disciple, may I be able to tear off the golden words and release the divine monkey to come with me to the Vulture Peak. If I am not fated to have a disciple, and this monkey is an evil monster who has deceived me and will do me no good, then may I be unable to remove it.&#8221; When he had prayed he bowed again, after which he went up and gently tore the paper seal off.</P>
<P>A scented wind blew in his face and carried the paper up into the sky as a voice called, &#8220;I am the Great Sage's guard. Now that his sufferings are over I am going back to see the Tathagata and hand in this seal.&#8221;</P>
<P>The startled Sanzang, Liu Boqin, and the rest of them all bowed to Heaven, then went down the mountain to the stone cell, where they said to the monkey, &#8220;The restriction order has been torn off, so you can come out.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>三藏近前跪下，朝石头，看着金字，拜了几拜，望西祷祝道：“弟子陈玄奘，特奉旨意求经，果有徒弟之分，揭得金字，救出神猴，同证灵山。若无徒弟之分，此辈是个凶顽怪物，哄赚弟子，不成吉庆，便揭不得起。”祝罢，又拜。拜毕，上前将六个金字轻轻揭下。只闻得一阵香风，劈手把压帖儿刮在空中，叫道：“吾乃监押大圣者。今日他的难满，吾等回见如来，缴此封皮去也。”吓得个三藏与伯钦一行人，望空礼拜。径下高山，又至石匣边，对那猴道：“揭了压帖矣，你出来么。”</p>
</div>

</div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<P>The delighted monkey said, &#8220;Master, please stand well clear so that I don't give you a fright when I come out.&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing this Liu Boqin took Sanzang and the rest of them to the East, and when they had covered some two or three miles they heard the monkey shout, &#8220;Further, further!&#8221; So Sanzang went much further until he was off the mountain. Then there was a great noise as the mountain split open.</P>
<P>As they were all shaking with terror, the monkey appeared kneeling stark naked in front of Sanzang's horse and saying, &#8220;Master, I'm out.&#8221; He bowed four times to Sanzang, then jumped up, addressed Liu Boqin with a respectful noise, and said, &#8220;Thank you, elder brother, for escorting my master, and thank you too for weeding the grass off my face.&#8221; He then picked up the luggage and put it on the horse's back. At the sight of him the horse felt so weak and trembling that it could not stay on its feet. Because the monkey had once been the Protector of the Horses and looked after the dragon steeds of Heaven, and mortal horses were terrified at the very sight of him.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>那猴欢喜，叫道：“师父，你请走开些，我好出来，莫惊了你。”伯钦听说，领着三藏，一行人回东即走。走了五七里远近，又听得那猴高叫道：“再走，再走！”三藏又行了许远，下了山，只闻得一声响亮，真个是地裂山崩。众人尽皆悚惧，只见那猴早到了三藏的马前，赤淋淋跪下，道声：“师父，我出来也！”对三藏拜了四拜，急起身，与伯钦唱个大喏道：“有劳大哥送我师父，又承大哥替我脸上薅草。”谢毕，就去收拾行李，扣背马匹。那马见了他，腰软蹄矬，战兢兢的立站不住。盖因那猴原是弼马温，在天上看养龙马的，有些法则，故此凡马见他害怕。</p>
</div>

</div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<P>Seeing that his intentions were indeed good and that he really was now a Buddhist, Sanzang asked him what was his surname.</P>
<P>&#8220;My surname's Sun,&#8221; replied the Monkey King.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll give you a Buddhist name that I can call you by,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no need to trouble yourself,&#8221; said the Monkey King, &#8220;I've already got one: Sun Wukong&#8212;Monkey Awakened to Emptiness.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's just right for our sect,&#8221; exclaimed the monk. &#8220;As you look so much like a young novice, I'll give you another name and call you Brother Monkey. Is that all right?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes, yes,&#8221; said Sun Wukong, and from then on he was also called Brother Monkey, or Sun the Novice.</P>
<P>When he saw that Brother Monkey was determined to go, the high warden turned to Sanzang, chanted a noise of respect and said, &#8220;It's splendid that you have got so good a disciple, venerable sir. He'll certainly make the journey. I must now take my leave.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang bowed to him in thanks, saying, &#8220;I have brought you a long way, and am deeply indebted to you. When you return home please convey my respects to your venerable mother and your wife; I caused them a lot of trouble, and hope that I shall be able to come and thank them on my return.&#8221; Boqin returned his bow, and with that they parted.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>三藏见他意思，实有好心，真个象沙门中的人物，便叫：“徒弟啊，你姓什么？”猴王道：“我姓孙。”三藏道：“我与你起个法名，却好呼唤。”猴王道：“不劳师父盛意，我原有个法名，叫做孙悟空。”三藏欢喜道：“也正合我们的宗派。你这个模样，就象那小头陀一般，我再与你起个混名，称为行者，好么？”悟空道：“好，好，好！”自此时又称为孙行者。那伯钦见孙行者一心收拾要行，却转身对三藏唱个喏道：“长老，你幸此间收得个好徒，甚喜甚喜，此人果然去得。我却告回。”三藏躬身作礼相谢道：“多有拖步，感激不胜。回府多多致意令堂老夫人，令荆夫人，贫僧在府多扰，容回时踵谢。”伯钦回礼，遂此两下分别。</p>
</div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<P>Brother Monkey asked Sanzang to mount the horse while he ambled ahead, stark naked, carrying the luggage on his back. Before long they were over the Double Boundary Mountain.</P>
<P>Suddenly a ferocious tiger rushed at them, roaring and lashing about with its tail. Sanzang on his horse was terrified. Brother Monkey, who was standing beside the path, put down the luggage and said happily, &#8220;Don't be scared, master, it's just bringing me my clothes.&#8221; He pulled a needle out of his ear and shook it in the wind, turning it into an iron cudgel as thick as a bowl.</P>
<P>&#8220;I haven't used this little treasure in over five hundred years,&#8221; he said, holding it in his hand. &#8220;Today I'm bringing it out to get myself some clothes to wear.&#8221;</P>
<P>Just watch as he rushes at the tiger, shouting, &#8220;Where d'you think you're going, wretch?&#8221; The tiger crouched in the dust, not daring to move, as the cudgel smashed into its head.</P>
<P>Thousands of drops of red brain and many a pearly piece of tooth flew everywhere, so terrifying Sanzang that he fell out of the saddle, biting on his finger and crying, &#8220;Heavens, the high warden had to fight for ages before killing the striped tiger the other day, but this Sun Wukong has smashed a tiger to pull with a single blow. He really is a tough's tough.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>却说那孙行者请三藏上马，他在前边，背着行李，赤条条，拐步而行。不多时，过了两界山，忽然见一只猛虎，咆哮剪尾而来，三藏在马上惊心。行者在路旁欢喜道：“师父莫怕他，他是送衣服与我的。”放下行李，耳朵里拔出一个针儿，迎着风，幌一幌，原来是个碗来粗细一条铁棒。他拿在手中，笑道：“这宝贝，五百余年不曾用着他，今日拿出来挣件衣服儿穿穿。”你看他拽开步，迎着猛虎，道声：“业畜，那里去！”那只虎蹲着身，伏在尘埃，动也不敢动动。却被他照头一棒，就打的脑浆迸万点桃红，牙齿喷几珠玉块，唬得那陈玄奘滚鞍落马，咬指道声：“天哪，天哪！刘太保前日打的斑斓虎，还与他斗了半日。今日孙悟空不用争持，把这虎一棒打得稀烂，正是强中更有强中手！”</p>
</div>

</div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<P>&#8220;Sit down for a moment, master, while I strip the clothes off him to wear on the journey,&#8221; said Brother Monkey as he dragged the tiger over.</P>
<P>&#8220;But he hasn't got any clothes,&#8221; Sanzang protested.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't bother yourself about it, I know how to cope.&#8221; The splendid Monkey King pulled a hair from his body, breathed some magic breath on it, and said &#8220;Change!,&#8221; on which it turned into a pointed knife shaped like a cow's ear. Cutting into the skin on the tiger's belly, he took it all off in a single stroke, chopped off the head and claws, then held up the square hide to get an idea of its size.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's on the big side,&#8221; he said, &#8220;so I could make two kilts out of it,&#8221; and with these words he took his knife and cut it in two. One piece he put away, and the other he wrapped round his waist to cover the lower half of his body and tied firmly with a creeper he pulled down from beside the path.</P>
<P>&#8220;Let's go on, master, let's go on,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The sewing can wait till we reach a house where we can borrow a needle and thread.&#8221; He pinched his iron cudgel to make it as small as a needle again, put it back in his ear, took the luggage on his back, and asked Sanzang to mount the horse.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>行者拖将虎来道：“师父略坐一坐，等我脱下他的衣服来，穿了走路。”三藏道：“他那里有甚衣服？”行者道：“师父莫管我，我自有处置。”好猴王，把毫毛拔下一根，吹口仙气，叫：“变！”变作一把牛耳尖刀，从那虎腹上挑开皮，往下一剥，剥下个囫囵皮来，剁去了爪甲，割下头来，割个四四方方一块虎皮，提起来，量了一量道：“阔了些儿，一幅可作两幅。”拿过刀来，又裁为两幅。收起一幅，把一幅围在腰间，路旁揪了一条葛藤，紧紧束定，遮了下体道：“师父，且去，且去！到了人家，借些针线，再缝不迟。”他把条铁棒，捻一捻，依旧象个针儿，收在耳里，背着行李，请师父上马。</p>
</div>

</div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<P>As the two of them went along the venerable monk asked from the horse's back, &#8220;Wukong, why has the iron cudgel you used to kill the tiger disappeared?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What you don't know, master,&#8221; replied Brother Monkey with a laugh, &#8220;is that I got it from the dragon palace of the Eastern Sea, and that it's called the Magic Iron to Hold the Bed of the Milky Way in Place or 'As-You-Will Gold-Banded Cudgel'. When I raised my great rebellion against the Heavenly Palace in the old days it served me well. It can change into anything and be whatever size I want it to be. Just now I turned it into an embroidery needle and put it away in my ear. I only take it out when I need it.&#8221;</P>
<P>Concealing his delight at hearing this, Sanzang went on to ask, &#8220;Why didn't that tiger move when it saw you? Why on earth did it let you hit it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I can tell you in all truthfulness, master, that not just tigers but even dragons have to be on their best behavior when they meet me. I know a few tricks for putting them in their place and have the power to make rivers run backwards and stir up the seas. I can tell what things are really like from appearances alone, and sort out the truth behind what is said. When I want to make myself big I measure myself against the universe, and when I shrink I can be held on a downy hair. There's no limit to the transformations I can perform, and nobody can tell when I'm going to vanish or when I'm going to reappear. There was nothing wonderful about skinning that tiger. Wait till I show you a thing or two.&#8221; This took a great load off Sanzang's mind, and he whipped his horse on. As master and disciple went along their way talking together, the sun was sinking in the West, and they saw:</P>

</div>

<div class="right">
<p>两个前进，长老在马上问道：“悟空，你才打虎的铁棒，如何不见？”行者笑道：“师父，你不晓得。我这棍，本是东洋大海龙宫里得来的，唤做天河镇底神珍铁，又唤做如意金箍棒。当年大反天宫，甚是亏他。随身变化，要大就大，要小就小。刚才变做一个绣花针儿模样，收在耳内矣。但用时，方可取出。”三藏闻言暗喜。又问道：“方才那只虎见了你，怎么就不动动，让自在打他，何说？”悟空道：“不瞒师父说，莫道是只虎，就是一条龙，见了我也不敢无礼。我老孙，颇有降龙伏虎的手段，翻江搅海的神通，见貌辨色，聆音察理，大之则量于宇宙，小之则摄于毫毛！变化无端，隐显莫测。剥这个虎皮，何为稀罕？见到那疑难处，看展本事么！”三藏闻得此言，愈加放怀无虑，策马前行。师徒两个走着路，说着话，不觉得太阳星坠。但见——</p>

<P>&#8220;You must hurry up, master, as it's late,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;There must be a house in that clump of trees over there, so let's get there as soon as possible to settle down for the night.&#8221; Sanzang whipped on his horse and galloped to the house, where he dismounted.</P>
<P>Brother Monkey put down the luggage, went up to the gate, and shouted, &#8220;Open up, open up.&#8221; An old man came out, leaning on a bamboo stick, and the gate creaked as he opened it. At the sight of Monkey's ugly face and the tiger-skin wrapped around him, which made him look like the god of thunder, the old man was so terrified that his legs turned to jelly and his body went numb.</P>
<P>&#8220;A devil.... A devil,&#8221; he muttered deliriously.</P>
<P>Sanzang went up to support him, saying, &#8220;Don't be afraid, aged benefactor. He's no devil, he's my disciple.&#8221; When the old man looked up and saw Sanzang's pure face he felt steady on his feet at once, and he asked what monastery Sanzang was from, and why had he brought that evil-looking creature to his house.</P>
<P>&#8220;I come from the Tang Court,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;and I am going to the Western Heaven to visit the Buddha and ask for the scriptures. As we were passing this way at nightfall we came to your mansion, good benefactor, to ask for a night's lodging. We shall be off before dawn tomorrow. I very much hope that you will be able to help us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You may be a Tang man,&#8221; the old fellow replied, &#8220;but that ugly brute certainly isn't.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've got no eyes in your head, you silly old man,&#8221; shrieked Brother Monkey. &#8220;He's my master and I'm his disciple. I'm no Tang man or Spike man, I'm the Great Sage Equaling Heaven. Some of the people who live in this house must know me, and I've seen you before.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where've you seen me?&#8221; the old man asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Didn't you gather firewood in front of my face and pick wild vegetables from my cheeks when you were a child?&#8221; said Sun Wukong.</P>
<P>&#8220;Rubbish,&#8221; retorted the old man.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where did you live and where did I live when I was supposed to gather firewood and wild vegetables in front of your face?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's you who's talking rubbish, my child,&#8221; replied Sun Wukong. &#8220;You don't know who I am, but I'm the Great Sage from the stone cell under the Double Boundary Mountain. Take another look and see if you can recognize me now.&#8221; The old man at last realized who he was and said, &#8220;I suppose you do look a bit like him, but however did you get out?&#8221; Sun Wukong told him the whole story of how the Bodhisattva had converted him and told him to wait till the Tang Priest came to take off the seal and release him. The old man went down on his knees and bowed his head, inviting the Tang Priest inside and calling his wife and children to come and meet him; they were all very happy when they heard what had happened.</P>
<P>When they had drunk tea he asked Sun Wukong, &#8220;How old are you, Great Sage?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How old are you, then?&#8221; said Sun Wukong.</P>
<P>&#8220;In my senile way I have reached a hundred and thirty.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Then you could be my remote descendant,&#8221; said Brother Monkey. &#8220;I can't remember when I was born, but I spent over five hundred years under that mountain.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;True, true,&#8221; remarked the old man, &#8220;I remember my grandfather saying that this mountain fell from heaven to crush a magical monkey, and you weren't able to get out before now. When I saw you in my childhood, grass grew on your head and there was mud on your face, so I wasn't afraid of you. But now that the mud and grass have gone you look thinner, and the tiger-skin round your waist makes you as near a devil as makes no difference.&#8221;</p>

<p>行者道：“师父走动些，天色晚了。那壁厢树木森森，想必是人家庄院，我们赶早投宿去来。”三藏果策马而行，径奔人家，到了庄院前下马。行者撇了行李，走上前，叫声：“开门，开门！”那里面有一老者，扶筇而出，唿喇的开了门，看见行者这般恶相，腰系着一块虎皮，好似个雷公模样，唬得脚软身麻，口出谵语道：“鬼来了，鬼来了！”三藏近前搀住叫道：“老施主，休怕。他是我贫僧的徒弟，不是鬼怪。”老者抬头，见了三藏的面貌清奇，方然立定，问道：“你是那寺里来的和尚，带这恶人上我门来？”三藏道：“我贫僧是唐朝来的，往西天拜佛求经，适路过此间，天晚，特造檀府借宿一宵，明早不犯天光就行。万望方便一二。”老者道：“你虽是个唐人，那个恶的却非唐人。”悟空厉声高呼道：“你这个老儿全没眼色！唐人是我师父，我是他徒弟！我也不是甚糖人蜜人，我是齐天大圣。你们这里人家，也有认得我的，我也曾见你来。”那老者道：“你在那里见我？”悟空道：“你小时不曾在我面前扒柴？不曾在我脸上挑菜？”老者道：“这厮胡说！你在那里住？我在那里住？我来你面前扒柴挑菜！”悟空道：“我儿子便胡说！你是认不得我了，我本是这两界山石匣中的大圣。你再认认看。”老者方才省悟道：“你倒有些象他，但你是怎么得出来的？”悟空将菩萨劝善、令我等待唐僧揭帖脱身之事，对那老者细说了一遍。老者却才下拜，将唐僧请到里面，即唤老妻与儿女都来相见，具言前事，个个欣喜。又命看茶，茶罢，问悟空道：“大圣啊，你也有年纪了？”悟空道：“你今年几岁了？”老者道：“我痴长一百三十岁了。”行者道：“还是我重子重孙哩！我那生身的年纪，我不记得是几时，但只在这山脚下，已五百余年了。”老者道：“是有，是有。我曾记得祖公公说，此山乃从天降下，就压了一个神猴。只到如今，你才脱体。我那小时见你，是你头上有草，脸上有泥，还不怕你。如今脸上无了泥，头上无了草，却象瘦了些，腰间又苫了一块大虎皮，与鬼怪能差多少？”</p>

<P>This conversation made everyone roar with laughter, and as he was a kind old man he had a vegetarian meal set out. When the meal was over Sanzang asked him his surname.</P>
<P>&#8220;Chen,&#8221; the old man replied. On hearing this, Sanzang raised his hands in greeting and said, &#8220;Venerable benefactor, you are of the same clan as myself.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; protested Brother Monkey, &#8220;You're called Tang, aren't you, so how can you belong to the same clan as him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My secular surname is Chen, and I am from Juxian Village, Hongnong Prefecture, Haizhou, in the Tang Empire. My Buddhist name is Chen Xuanzang. But as our Great Tang Emperor Taizong called me his younger brother and gave me the surname Tang, I am known as the Tang Priest.&#8221; The old fellow was delighted to hear that they shared a surname.</P>
<P>&#8220;Chen, old fellow,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;I'm afraid this will be putting your family out, but I haven't washed for over five hundred years, so could you go and boil up some water for me and my master to have a bath before we set out again? Thank you.&#8221; The old man gave instructions for water to be boiled and a tub brought, and he lit the lamp.</P>
<P>When master and disciple had bathed they sat down by the lamp, and Brother Monkey asked once more, &#8220;Old Chen, there's another thing I'd like to ask you: could you lend me a needle and thread?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, of course,&#8221; the old man replied, sending his wife to fetch them and then handing them to Monkey. Monkey's sharp eyes had observed his master take off a short white cotton tunic, which he did not put on again, so Monkey grabbed it and put it on himself. Then he took off his tiger skin, joined it up with a pleat, wrapped it round his waist again, tied it with a creeper, went up to his master, and asked, &#8220;How would you say these clothes compared with what I was wearing before?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Splendid, splendid,&#8221; replied Sanzang, &#8220;it makes you look quite like a real monk. If you don't mind cast-offs,&#8221; he added, &#8220;you can go on wearing that tunic.&#8221; Sun Wukong chanted a &#8220;na-a-aw&#8221; of obedience and thanked him, then went off to find some hay for the horse. When all the jobs were finished, master and disciple went to bed.</p>

<p>一家儿听得这般话说，都呵呵大笑。这老儿颇贤，即令安排斋饭。饭后，悟空道：“你家姓甚？”老者道：“舍下姓陈。”三藏闻言，即下来起手道：“老施主，与贫僧是华宗。”行者道：“师父，你是唐姓，怎的和他是华宗？”三藏道：“我俗家也姓陈，乃是唐朝海州弘农郡聚贤庄人氏。我的法名叫做陈玄奘。只因我大唐太宗皇帝赐我做御弟三藏，指唐为姓，故名唐僧也。”那老者见说同姓，又十分欢喜。行者道：“老陈，左右打搅你家。我有五百多年不洗澡了，你可去烧些汤来，与我师徒们洗浴洗浴，一发临行谢你。”那老儿即令烧汤拿盆，掌上灯火。师徒浴罢，坐在灯前，行者道：“老陈，还有一事累你，有针线借我用用。”那老儿道：“有，有，有。”即教妈妈取针线来，递与行者。行者又有眼色，见师父洗浴，脱下一件白布短小直裰未穿，他即扯过来披在身上，却将那虎皮脱下，联接一处，打一个马面样的折子，围在腰间，勒了藤条，走到师父面前道：“老孙今日这等打扮，比昨日如何？”三藏道：“好，好，好！这等样，才象个行者。”三藏道：“徒弟，你不嫌残旧，那件直裰儿，你就穿了罢。”悟空唱个喏道：“承赐，承赐！”他又去寻些草料喂了马。此时各各事毕，师徒与那老儿，亦各归寝。</p>

<P>Early the next morning Sun Wukong woke up and asked his master to set out. Sanzang dressed and told Monkey to pack the bedding and the rest of the luggage. They were just on the point of leaving when the old man appeared. He had prepared hot water for washing as well as breakfast. After breakfast they set out, Sanzang riding the horse and Brother Monkey leading. They ate when they were hungry and drank when they were thirsty, travelling by day and resting by night. Thus they went on until they realized it was early winter.</P>

<P>When master and disciple had been travelling for a long time they heard a whistle from beside the path, and six men rushed out with spears, swords, cutlasses, and strongbows.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where do you think you're going, monk?&#8221; they roared. &#8220;If you give us your horse and luggage we'll spare your life.&#8221; Sanzang fell from his horse, scared out of his wits and unable to utter a word. Brother Monkey helped him to his feet and said, &#8220;Don't worry, master, it's nothing serious. They're come to bring us some clothes and our travelling expenses.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Are you deaf, Wukong?&#8221; the other asked. &#8220;They told us to give them our horse and luggage, so how can you ask them for clothes and money?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You look after the clothes, the luggage and the horse while I go and have a bash at them. We'll see what happens.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;A good hand is no match for two fists,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;and a pair of fists is no match for four hands. They are six big men against little you, all by yourself. You can't possibly have the nerve to fight them.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>师徒们正走多时，忽见路旁唿哨一声，闯出六个人来，各执长枪短剑，利刃强弓，大咤一声道：“那和尚，那里走！赶早留下马匹，放下行李，饶你性命过去！”唬得那三藏魂飞魄散，跌下马来，不能言语。行者用手扶起道：“师父放心，没些儿事，这都是送衣服送盘缠与我们的。”三藏道：“悟空，你想有些耳闭？他说教我们留马匹、行李，你倒问他要什么衣服、盘缠？”行者道：“你管守着衣服、行李、马匹，待老孙与他争持一场，看是何如。”三藏道：“好手不敌双拳，双拳不如四手。他那里六条大汉，你这般小小的一个人儿，怎么敢与他争持？”</p>

<P>The brave Brother Monkey did not stop to argue. Instead he stepped forward, folded his arms across his chest, bowed to the six bandits and said, &#8220;Why are you gentlemen obstructing our way?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We are mighty robber kings, benevolent lords of the mountain. We have been very famous for a long time, although you don't seem to have heard of us. If you abandon your things at once, we'll let you go on your way; but if there's even a hint of a 'no' from you, we'll turn your flesh into mincemeat and your bones into powder.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I too am a hereditary robber king, and have ruled a mountain for many years, but I've never heard of you gentlemen.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Since you don't know our names, I'll tell them to you: Eye-seeing Happiness, Ear-hearing Anger, Nose-smelling Love, Tongue-tasting Thought, Mind-born Desire, and Body-based Sorrow.&#8221; Sun Wukong laughed at them. &#8220;You're just a bunch of small-time crooks. You can't see that I'm your lord and master although I'm a monk, and you have the effrontery to get in our way. Bring out all the jewels you've stolen, and the seven of us can share them out equally. I'll let you off with that.&#8221;</P>
<P>This made the bandits happy, angry, loving, thoughtful, desirous, and sorrowful respectively, and they all charged him, yelling, &#8220;You've got a nerve, monk. You've got nothing to put in the kitty, but you want to share our stuff.&#8221; Waving their spears and swords they rushed him, hacking wildly at his face. Seventy or eighty blows crashed down on him, but he simply stood in the middle of them, ignoring everything.</P>
<P>&#8220;What a monk!&#8221; the bandits said. &#8220;He's a real tough nut.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I think we've seen enough of that,&#8221; said Brother Monkey with a smile. &#8220;Your hands must be tired after all that bashing. Now it's my turn to bring out my needle for a bit of fun.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This monk must have been an acupuncturist,&#8221; said the bandits. &#8220;There's nothing wrong with us. Why is he talking about needles?&#8221;</P>
<P>Taking the embroidery needle from his ear, Brother Monkey shook it in the wind, at which it became an iron cudgel as thick as a ricebowl. With this in his hand he said, &#8220;Stick around while I try my cudgel out.&#8221; The terrified bandits tried to flee in all directions, but Monkey raced after them, caught them all up, and killed every one of them. Then he stripped the clothes off them, took their money, and went back with his face wreathed in smiles.</P>
<P>&#8220;Let's go, master; I've wiped those bandits out,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>行者的胆量原大，那容分说，走上前来，叉手当胸，对那六个人施礼道：“列位有什么缘故，阻我贫僧的去路？”那人道：“我等是剪径的大王，行好心的山主。大名久播，你量不知，早早的留下东西，放你过去。若道半个不字，教你碎尸粉骨！”行者道：“我也是祖传的大王，积年的山主，却不曾闻得列位有甚大名。”那人道：“你是不知，我说与你听：一个唤做眼看喜，一个唤做耳听怒，一个唤做鼻嗅爱，一个唤作舌尝思，一个唤作意见欲，一个唤作身本忧。”悟空笑道：“原来是六个毛贼！你却不认得我这出家人是你的主人公，你倒来挡路。把那打劫的珍宝拿出来，我与你作七分儿均分，饶了你罢！”那贼闻言，喜的喜，怒的怒，爱的爱，思的思，欲的欲，忧的忧，一齐上前乱嚷道：“这和尚无礼！你的东西全然没有，转来和我等要分东西！”他轮枪舞剑，一拥前来，照行者劈头乱砍，乒乒乓乓，砍有七八十下。悟空停立中间，只当不知。那贼道：“好和尚！真个的头硬！”行者笑道：“将就看得过罢了！你们也打得手困了，却该老孙取出个针儿来耍耍。”那贼道：“这和尚是一个行针灸的郎中变的。我们又无病症，说什么动针的话！”行者伸手去耳朵里拔出一根绣花针儿，迎风一幌，却是一条铁棒，足有碗来粗细，拿在手中道：“不要走！也让老孙打一棍儿试试手！”唬得这六个贼四散逃走，被他拽开步，团团赶上，一个个尽皆打死。剥了他的衣服，夺了他的盘缠，笑吟吟走将来道：“师父请行，那贼已被老孙剿了。”</p>

<P>&#8220;Even though they were highwaymen, you're really asking for trouble,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;Even if they had been arrested and handed over to the authorities, they wouldn't have been sentenced to death. You may know a few tricks, but it would be better if you'd simply driven them away. Why did you have to kill them all? Even taking a man's life by accident is enough to stop someone from becoming a monk. A person who enters the religious life Spares the ants when he sweeps the floor, Covers the lamps to save the moth.</P>

<P>What business did you have to slaughter the lot of them, without caring which of them were the guilty and which were innocent? You haven't a shred of compassion or goodness in you. This time it happened in the wilds, where nobody will be able to trace the crime. Say someone offended you in a city and you turned murderous there. Say you killed and wounded people when you went berserk with that club of yours. I myself would be involved even though I'm quite innocent.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But if I hadn't killed them, they'd have killed you, master,&#8221; protested Sun Wukong.</P>
<P>&#8220;I am a man of religion, and I would rather die than commit murder,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;If I'd died, there'd only have been me dead, but you killed six of them, which was an absolute outrage. If the case were taken to court, you couldn't talk your way out of this even if the judge were your own father.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;To tell you the truth, master, I don't know how many people I killed when I was the monster who ruled the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit,&#8221; said Sun Wukong, &#8220;but if I'd acted your way I'd never have become the Great Sage Equaling Heaven.&#8221;</P>

<P>&#8220;It was precisely because you acted with such tyrannical cruelty among mortals and committed the most desperate crimes against Heaven that you got into trouble five hundred years ago,&#8221; retorted Sanzang. &#8220;But now you have entered the faith, you'll never reach the Western Heaven and never become a monk if you don't give up your taste for murder. You're too evil, too evil.&#8221;</p>

<p>三藏道：“你十分撞祸！他虽是剪径的强徒，就是拿到官司，也不该死罪。你纵有手段，只可退他去便了，怎么就都打死？这却是无故伤人的性命，如何做得和尚？出家人扫地恐伤蝼蚁命，爱惜飞蛾纱罩灯。你怎么不分皂白，一顿打死？全无一点慈悲好善之心！早还是山野中无人查考，若到城市，倘有人一时冲撞了你，你也行凶，执着棍子，乱打伤人，我可做得白客，怎能脱身？”悟空道：“师父，我若不打死他，他却要打死你哩。”三藏道：“我这出家人，宁死决不敢行凶。我就死，也只是一身，你却杀了他六人，如何理说？此事若告到官，就是你老子做官，也说不过去。”行者道：“不瞒师父说，我老孙五百年前，据花果山称王为怪的时节，也不知打死多少人。假似你说这般到官，倒也得些状告是。”三藏道：“只因你没收没管，暴横人间，欺天诳上，才受这五百年前之难。今既入了沙门，若是还象当时行凶，一味伤生，去不得西天，做不得和尚。忒恶，忒恶！”</p>

<P>Monkey, who had never let himself be put upon, flared up at Sanzang's endless nagging.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you say that I'll never become a monk and won't ever reach the Western Heaven, then stop going on at me like that. I'm going back.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before Sanzang could reply, Monkey leapt up in a fury, shouting, &#8220;I'm off.&#8221; Sanzang looked up quickly, but he was already out of sight. All that could be heard was a whistling sound coming from the East. Left on his own, the Priest nodded and sighed to himself with great sadness and indignation.</P>
<P>&#8220;The incorrigible wretch,&#8221; he reflected. &#8220;Fancy disappearing and going back home like that just because I gave him a bit of a telling-off. So that's that. I must be fated to have no disciples or followers. I couldn't find him now even if I wanted to, and he wouldn't answer if I called him. I must be on my way.&#8221; So he had to strive with all his might to reach the West, looking after himself with nobody to help.</p>

<p>原来这猴子一生受不得人气，他见三藏只管绪绪叨叨，按不住心头火发道：“你既是这等，说我做不得和尚，上不得西天，不必恁般绪浩恶我，我回去便了！”那三藏却不曾答应，他就使一个性子，将身一纵，说一声：“老孙去也！”三藏急抬头，早已不见，只闻得呼的一声，回东而去。撇得那长老孤孤零零，点头自叹，悲怨不已，道：“这厮，这等不受教诲！我但说他几句，他怎么就无形无影的，径回去了？罢，罢，罢！也是我命里不该招徒弟，进人口！如今欲寻他无处寻，欲叫他叫不应，去来，去来！”正是舍身拚命归西去，莫倚旁人自主张。</p>

<P>Sanzang had no choice but to gather up the luggage and tie it on the horse. He did not ride now. Instead, holding his monastic staff in one hand and leading the horse by the reins with the other, he made his lonely way to the West. Before he had been travelling for long he saw an old woman on the mountain path in front of him. She was holding an embroidered robe, and a patterned hat was resting upon it. As she came towards him he hurriedly pulled the horse to the side of the path to make room for her to pass.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you from, venerable monk,&#8221; the old woman asked, &#8220;travelling all alone and by yourself?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have been sent by the great King of the East to go to the West to visit the Buddha and ask him for the True Scriptures,&#8221; he replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;The Buddha of the West lives in the Great Thunder Monastery in the land of India, thirty-six thousand miles away from here. You'll never get there, just you and your horse, without a companion or disciple.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I did have a disciple, but his nature was so evil that he would not accept a little reproof I administered to him and disappeared into the blue,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;I have here an embroidered tunic and a hat inset with golden patterns that used to be my son's,&#8221; the woman said, &#8220;but he died after being a monk for only three days. I've just been to his monastery to mourn him and say farewell to his master, and I was taking this tunic and this hat home to remember the boy by. But as you have a disciple, venerable monk, I'll give them to you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Thank you very much for your great generosity, but as my disciple has already gone, I couldn't accept them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where has he gone?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;All I heard was a whistling sound as he went back to the East.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My home isn't far to the East from here,&#8221; she said, &#8220;so I expect he's gone there. I've also got a spell called<I> True Words to Calm the Mind,</I> or the Band-tightening Spell. You must learn it in secret, and be sure to keep it to yourself. Never leak it to anyone. I'll go and catch up with him and send him back to you, and you can give him that tunic and hat to wear. If he's disobedient again, all you have to do is recite the spell quietly. That will stop him committing any more murders or running away again.&#8221;</p>

<p>那长老只得收拾行李，捎在马上，也不骑马，一只手拄着锡杖，一只手揪着缰绳，凄凄凉凉，往西前进。行不多时，只见山路前面，有一个年高的老母，捧一件绵衣，绵衣上有一顶花帽。三藏见他来得至近，慌忙牵马，立于右侧让行。那老母问道：“你是那里来的长老，孤孤凄凄独行于此？”三藏道：“弟子乃东土大唐奉圣旨往西天拜活佛求真经者。”老母道：“西方佛乃大雷音寺天竺国界，此去有十万八千里路。你这等单人独马，又无个伴侣，又无个徒弟，你如何去得！”三藏道：“弟子日前收得一个徒弟，他性泼凶顽，是我说了他几句，他不受教，遂渺然而去也。”老母道：“我有这一领绵布直裰，一顶嵌金花帽，原是我儿子用的。他只做了三日和尚，不幸命短身亡。我才去他寺里，哭了一场，辞了他师父，将这两件衣帽拿来，做个忆念。长老啊，你既有徒弟，我把这衣帽送了你罢。”三藏道：“承老母盛赐，但只是我徒弟已走了，不敢领受。”老母道：“他那厢去了？”三藏道：“我听得呼的一声，他回东去了。”老母道：“东边不远，就是我家，想必往我家去了。我那里还有一篇咒儿，唤做定心真言，又名做紧箍儿咒。你可暗暗的念熟，牢记心头，再莫泄漏一人知道。我去赶上他，叫他还来跟你，你却将此衣帽与他穿戴。他若不服你使唤，你就默念此咒，他再不敢行凶，也再不敢去了。”三藏闻言，低头拜谢。</p>

<P>Sanzang bowed low to thank her, at which she changed into a beam of golden light and returned to the East. He realized in his heart that it must have been the Bodhisattva Guanyin who had given him the spell, so he took a pinch of earth as if he were burning incense and bowed in worship to the East most reverently. Then he put the tunic and hat in his pack, sat down beside the path, and recited the<I> True Words to Calm the Mind</I> over and over again until he knew them thoroughly, and had committed them to his memory.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>那老母化一道金光，回东而去。三藏情知是观音菩萨授此真言，急忙撮土焚香，望东恳恳礼拜。拜罢，收了衣帽，藏在包袱中间，却坐于路旁，诵习那定心真言。来回念了几遍，念得烂熟，牢记心胸不题。</p>

<P>Let us turn to Sun Wukong, who after leaving his master went straight back to the Eastern Ocean on his somersault cloud. Putting his cloud away, he parted the waters and went straight to the undersea palace of crystal. His approach had alarmed the dragon king, who came out to welcome him and took him into the palace, where they sat down.</P>
<P>When they had exchanged courtesies the dragon king said, &#8220;I'm sorry that I failed to come and congratulate you on the end of your sufferings, Great Sage. I take it that you are returning to your old cave to put your immortal mountain back in order.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's what I wanted to do,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;But I've become a monk instead.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;A monk? How?&#8221; the dragon king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The Bodhisattva of the Southern Sea converted me. She taught me to work for a good reward later by going to the West with the Tang Priest from the East, visiting the Buddha, and becoming a monk. And my name has been changed to Brother Monkey.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Congratulations, congratulations,&#8221; said the dragon king. &#8220;You've turned over a new leaf and decided to be good. But in that case why have you come back to the East instead of going West?&#8221; Monkey laughed.</P>
<P>&#8220;Because that Tang Priest doesn't understand human nature. He started nagging away at me about a few small-time highwaymen I killed, and said that everything about me was wrong. You know how I can't stand people going on at me, so I left him to come home to my mountain. I looked in on you first to ask for a cup of tea.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Delighted to oblige,&#8221; said the dragon king, and his dragon sons and grandsons came in with some fragrant tea which they presented to Monkey.</p>

<p>却说那悟空别了师父，一筋斗云，径转东洋大海。按住云头，分开水道，径至水晶宫前。早惊动龙王出来迎接，接至宫里坐下。礼毕，龙王道：“近闻得大圣难满，失贺！想必是重整仙山，复归古洞矣。”悟空道：“我也有此心性，只是又做了和尚了。”龙王道：“做甚和尚？”行者道：“我亏了南海菩萨劝善，教我正果，随东土唐僧，上西方拜佛，皈依沙门，又唤为行者了。”龙王道：“这等真是可贺，可贺！这才叫做改邪归正，惩创善心。既如此，怎么不西去，复东回何也？”行者笑道：“那是唐僧不识人性。有几个毛贼剪径，是我将他打死，唐僧就绪绪叨叨，说了我若干的不是。你想老孙，可是受得闷气的？是我撇了他，欲回本山。故此先来望你一望，求钟茶吃。”龙王道：“承降，承降！”当时龙子龙孙即捧香茶来献。</p>

<P>When he had drunk his tea, Monkey looked round and saw a picture called, &#8220;Presenting the Shoe at the Yi Bridge&#8221; hanging on the wall behind him.</P>
<P>&#8220;What's that a view of?&#8221; asked Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;You wouldn't know about it because it happened after your time,&#8221; the dragon king replied. &#8220;It's called 'Presenting the Shoe Three Times at the Yi Bridge.'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What's all that about?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The Immortal is Lord Yellow Stone, and the boy is Zhang Liang, who lived in Han times,&#8221; the dragon king replied. &#8220;Lord Yellow Stone was sitting on the bridge when suddenly he dropped one of his shoes under it and told Zhang Liang to fetch it for him. The boy Zhang Liang did so at once, and knelt down to present it to him. Lord Yellow Stone did this three times, and because Zhang Liang never showed a trace of arrogance or disrespect, Lord Yellow Stone was touched by his diligence. One night he gave Zhang Liang some heavenly books and told him to support the Han cause. Later he won victories hundreds of miles away through his calculations within the walls of his tent. When peace came he resigned his office and went back to roam on his mountain with Master Red Pine and achieve the Way of Immortality through enlightenment. Great Sage, if you don't protect the Tang Priest with all your might, and if you reject his instruction, then you might as well stop trying to win yourself a good later reward, because it will mean you're only an evil Immoral after all.&#8221; Monkey hummed and hawed, but said nothing.</P>
<P>&#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; said the dragon king, &#8220;you must make your mind up. Don't ruin your future for the sake of any easy life now.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Enough said. I'll go back and look after him,&#8221; replied Sun Wukong. The dragon king was delighted.</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case I shan't keep you. I ask you in your mercy not to leave your master waiting for long.&#8221; Being thus pressed to go, Monkey left the sea palace, mounted his cloud, and took leave of the dragon king.</p>

<p>茶毕，行者回头一看，见后壁上挂著一幅“圯桥进履”的画儿。行者道：“这是什么景致？”龙王道：“大圣在先，此事在后，故你不认得。这叫做圯桥三进履。”行者道：“怎的是三进履？”龙王道：“此仙乃是黄石公，此子乃是汉世张良。石公坐在圯桥上，忽然失履于桥下，遂唤张良取来。此子即忙取来，跪献于前。如此三度，张良略无一毫倨傲怠慢之心，石公遂爱他勤谨，夜授天书，着他扶汉。后果然运筹帷幄之中，决胜千里之外。太平后，弃职归山，从赤松子游，悟成仙道。大圣，你若不保唐僧，不尽勤劳，不受教诲，到底是个妖仙，休想得成正果。”悟空闻言，沉吟半晌不语。龙王道：“大圣自当裁处，不可图自在，误了前程。”悟空道：“莫多话，老孙还去保他便了。”龙王欣喜道：“既如此，不敢久留，请大圣早发慈悲，莫要疏久了你师父。”行者见他催促请行，急耸身，出离海藏，驾着云，别了龙王。</p>

<P>On his way he met the Bodhisattva Guanyin. &#8220;What are you doing here, Sun Wukong?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Why did you reject the Tang Priest's teaching and stop protecting him?&#8221; Brother Monkey frantically bowed to her from his cloud and replied, &#8220;As you had predicted, Bodhisattva, a monk came from the Tang Empire who took off the seal, rescued me, and made me his disciple. I ran away from him because he thought I was wicked and incorrigible, but now I'm going back to protect him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Hurry up then, and don't have any more wicked thoughts.&#8221; With that they each went their separate ways.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>正走，却遇着南海菩萨。菩萨道：“孙悟空，你怎么不受教诲，不保唐僧，来此处何干？”慌得个行者在云端里施礼道：“向蒙菩萨善言，果有唐朝僧到，揭了压帖，救了我命，跟他做了徒弟。他却怪我凶顽，我才闪了他一闪，如今就去保他也。”菩萨道：“赶早去，莫错过了念头。”言毕各回。</p>

<P>A moment later Monkey saw the Tang Priest sitting gloomily beside the path. He went up to him and said, &#8220;Why aren't you travelling, master? What are you still here for?&#8221; Sanzang looked up.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where have you been?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;I couldn't move without you, so I had to sit here and wait till you came back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I went to visit the Old Dragon King of the Eastern Sea to ask him for some tea,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple, a religious man shouldn't tell lies. How can you say that you went to drink tea at the dragon king's place when you haven't been gone two hours?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I can tell you quite truthfully,&#8221; replied Monkey with a smile, &#8220;that with my somersault cloud I can cover thirty-six thousand miles in a single bound. That's how I got there and back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When I spoke to you a little severely you resented it and went off in a huff,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;It was all right for a clever person like you&#8212;you begged yourself some tea. But I couldn't go, and had to stay here hungry. You ought to be sorry for me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you're hungry, master, I'll go and beg you some food,&#8221; suggested Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;No need,&#8221; his master replied, &#8220;there are still some dry provisions in my bundle that the high warden's mother gave me. Take that bowl and fetch some water. When we've eaten some of it we can be on our way.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>这行者，须臾间看见唐僧在路旁闷坐。他上前道：“师父！怎么不走路？还在此做甚？”三藏抬头道：“你往那里去来？教我行又不敢行，动又不敢动，只管在此等你。”行者道：“我往东洋大海老龙王家讨茶吃吃。”三藏道：“徒弟啊，出家人不要说谎。你离了我，没多一个时辰，就说到龙王家吃茶？”行者笑道：“不瞒师父说，我会驾筋斗云，一个筋斗有十万八千里路，故此得即去即来。”三藏道：“我略略的言语重了些儿，你就怪我，使个性子丢了我去。象你这有本事的，讨得茶吃；象我这去不得的，只管在此忍饿，你也过意不去呀！”行者道：“师父，你若饿了，我便去与你化些斋吃。”三藏道：“不用化斋。我那包袱里，还有些干粮，是刘太保母亲送的，你去拿钵盂寻些水来，等我吃些儿走路罢。”</p>
</div>

</div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<P>Opening the bundle, Brother Monkey found some scones made of coarse flour, which he took out and gave to his master. He also noticed the dazzling brocade tunic and the hat with inlaid golden patterns.</P>
<P>&#8220;Did you bring this tunic and hat with you from the East?&#8221; he asked. Sanzang had to make something up on the spot.</P>
<P>&#8220;I used to wear them when I was young. With that hat on you can recite scriptures without ever having been taught them, and if you wear that tunic you can perform the rituals without any practice.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Dear master, please let me wear them,&#8221; Monkey pleaded.</P>
<P>&#8220;I don't know whether they'll fit you, but if you can get them on, you can wear them.&#8221; Monkey took off the old white tunic, put the brocade one on instead, and found that it was a perfect fit. Then he put the hat on his head. As soon as he had the hat on, Sanzang stopped eating and silently recited the Band-tightening Spell.</P>
<P>&#8220;My head aches, my head aches,&#8221; cried Brother Monkey, but his master went on and recited the spell several times more. Monkey, now rolling in agony, tore the hat to shreds, and Sanzang stopped reciting the spell for fear he would break the golden band. The moment the spell stopped the pain finished. Reaching up to feel his head, Monkey found something like a golden wire clamped so tightly around it that he could not wrench or snap it off. It had already taken root there. He took the needle out of his ear, forced it inside the band, and pulled wildly at it. Sanzang, again frightened that he would snap it, started to recite the spell once more. The pain was so bad this time that Monkey stood on his head, turned somersaults, and went red in the face and ears. His eyes were popping and his body went numb. Seeing the state he was in, Sanzang had to stop, and the pain stopped again too.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;What a curse you put on me to give me a headache like that.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I didn't put a curse on you, I recited the Band-tightening Spell,&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Say it again and see what happens,&#8221; said Monkey, and when Sanzang did as he asked, Monkey's head ached again. &#8220;Stop, stop,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;the moment you started reciting it my head ached. Why did you do it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Will you accept my instruction now?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Will you misbehave again in future?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I certainly won't,&#8221; said Monkey.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>行者去解开包袱，在那包裹中间见有几个粗面烧饼，拿出来递与师父。又见那光艳艳的一领绵布直裰，一顶嵌金花帽，行者道：“这衣帽是东土带来的？”三藏就顺口儿答应道：“是我小时穿戴的。这帽子若戴了，不用教经，就会念经；这衣服若穿了，不用演礼，就会行礼。”行者道：“好师父，把与我穿戴了罢。”三藏道：“只怕长短不一，你若穿得，就穿了罢。”行者遂脱下旧白布直裰，将绵布直裰穿上，也就是比量着身体裁的一般，把帽儿戴上。三藏见他戴上帽子，就不吃干粮，却默默的念那紧箍咒一遍。行者叫道：“头痛，头痛！”那师父不住的又念了几遍，把个行者痛得打滚，抓破了嵌金的花帽。三藏又恐怕扯断金箍，住了口不念。不念时，他就不痛了。伸手去头上摸摸，似一条金线儿模样，紧紧的勒在上面，取不下，揪不断，已此生了根了。他就耳里取出针儿来，插入箍里，往外乱捎。三藏又恐怕他捎断了，口中又念起来。他依旧生痛，痛得竖蜻蜓，翻筋斗，耳红面赤，眼胀身麻。那师父见他这等，又不忍不舍，复住了口，他的头又不痛了。行者道：“我这头，原来是师父咒我的。”三藏道：“我念得是紧箍经，何曾咒你？”行者道：“你再念念看。”三藏真个又念，行者真个又痛，只教：“莫念，莫念！念动我就痛了！这是怎么说？”三藏道：“你今番可听我教诲了？”行者道：“听教了！”“你再可无礼了？”行者道：“不敢了！”</p></div>

<P>Although he had made this verbal promise, he was still nurturing evil thoughts, and he shook his needle in the wind till it was as thick as a ricebowl. He turned on the Tang Priest, and was on the point of finishing him off when the terrified Sanzang recited the spell two or three more times.</P>
<P>The monkey dropped his cudgel and fell to the ground, unable to raise his arm, &#8220;Master,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;I've seen the light. Stop saying the spell, please stop.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How could you have the perfidy to try to kill me?&#8221; asked Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'd never have dared,&#8221; said Brother Monkey, adding, &#8220;who taught you that spell, master?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;An old lady I met just now,&#8221; replied Sanzang. Monkey exploded with rage.</P>
<P>&#8220;Tell me no more,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I'm sure and certain the old woman was that Guanyin. How could she do this to me? Just you wait. I'm going to the Southern Sea to kill her.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As she taught me this spell,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;she's bound to know it herself. If you go after her and she recites it, that will be the end of you.&#8221; Seeing the force of his argument, Monkey changed his mind and gave up the idea of going. He knelt down and pleaded pitifully, &#8220;Master, she's used this to force me to go with you to the West. I shan't go to make trouble for her, and you must recite scriptures instead of saying that spell all the time. I promise to protect you, and I shall always be true to this vow.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case you'd better help me back on the horse,&#8221; Sanzang replied. Monkey, who had been plunged into despair, summoned up his spirits, tightened the belt round his brocade tunic, got the horse ready, gathered up the luggage, and hurried off towards the West. If you want to know what other stories there are about the journey, then listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>他口里虽然答应，心上还怀不善，把那针儿幌一幌，碗来粗细，望唐僧就欲下手，慌得长老口中又念了两三遍，这猴子跌倒在地，丢了铁棒，不能举手，只教：“师父！我晓得了！再莫念，再莫念！”三藏道：“你怎么欺心，就敢打我？”行者道：“我不曾敢打，我问师父，你这法儿是谁教你的？”三藏道：“是适间一个老母传授我的。”行者大怒道：“不消讲了！这个老母，坐定是那个观世音！他怎么那等害我！等我上南海打他去！”三藏道：“此法既是他授与我，他必然先晓得了。你若寻他，他念起来，你却不是死了？”行者见说得有理，真个不敢动身，只得回心，跪下哀告道：“师父！这是他奈何我的法儿，教我随你西去。我也不去惹他，你也莫当常言，只管念诵。我愿保你，再无退悔之意了。”三藏道：“既如此，伏侍我上马去也。”那行者才死心塌地，抖擞精神，束一束绵布直裰，扣背马匹，收拾行李，奔西而进。毕竟这一去，后面又有甚话说，且听下回分解。
