<P>After they had been going for a long time they reached the Wheel of the Six Paths of Being. Some people were soaring in the clouds, wearing cloaks of rosy mist. Others were being given office with golden insignia to hang from their waists. Monks and nuns, clergy and lay people, beasts of the field and birds of the air, ghosts and devils&#8212;all were pouring under the wheel and each was going along his allotted path.</P>
<P>&#8220;What's all this about?&#8221; asked the Tang Emperor.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty is a man of deep understanding,&#8221; the judge replied. &#8220;You must be sure to remember all this and tell the living about it. It is called the Wheel of the Six Paths of Being. Those who have done good deeds rise on the Path of the Immortals; those who have been loyal are reborn on the Path of Honour; those who have done their duty to their parents lead their next life on the Path of Happiness; those who have been just return to life on the Path of Man; those who have accumulated merit are reborn on the Path of Wealth; and the evildoers fall down into the Path of Devils.&#8221; On hearing this the Tang Emperor nodded and said with a sigh:</P>

<P>The judge took Taizong straight to the Gate of Rebirth on the Path of Honour, bowed to him and said, &#8220;Your Majesty, this is the way out, where I shall have to take my leave and go back. Marshal Zhu will escort you for the next stage of your journey.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have made you come an awfully long way, sir,&#8221; said the Tang Emperor as he thanked him.</P>
<P>&#8220;When Your Majesty returns to the world of the living you absolutely must hold a Great Mass to enable those forlorn ghosts to be reborn,&#8221; replied the judge. &#8220;Don't on any account forget, as there can only be peace on Earth if there are no vengeance-seeking ghosts in the underworld. Every single wrong will have to be corrected. Teach all people to be good, and then you will be able to assure the continuity of your line and the eternal security of your empire.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Tang Emperor agreed to each of his proposals and took leave of him, then went through the gates with Marshal Zhu. Seeing a fine horse standing ready and saddled inside the gates, the marshal asked Taizong to mount it with the help of his assistants. The horse was as swift as an arrow, and it was soon at the banks of the River Wei, where a pair of golden carp could be seen sporting in the water. Taizong, captivated at the sight, pulled in his horse's reins and gazed at them.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; the marshal said, &#8220;please keep moving. We have to enter the city early.&#8221; But all the Tang Emperor wanted to do was to look. As he would not move on the marshal grabbed him by the feet and shouted, &#8220;Get moving. What are you waiting for?&#8221; as he pushed him off his horse and into the River Wei with a splash. Taizong was now free of the underworld and back in the world of the living.</p>

<p>判官送唐王直至那超生贵道门，拜呼唐王道：“陛下呵，此间乃出头之处，小判告回，着朱太尉再送一程。”唐王谢道：“有劳先生远做。”判官道：“陛下到阳间，千万做个水陆大会，超度那无主的冤魂，切勿忘了。若是阴司里无报怨之声，阳世间方得享太平之庆。凡百不善之处，俱可一一改过，普谕世人为善，管教你后代绵长，江山永固。”唐王一一准奏，辞了崔判官，随着朱太尉，同入门来。那太尉见门里有一匹海骝马，鞍韂齐备，急请唐王上马，太尉左右扶持。马行如箭，早到了渭水河边，只见那水面上有一对金色鲤鱼在河里翻波跳斗。唐王见了心喜，兜马贪看不舍，太尉道：“陛下，趱动些，趁早赶时辰进城去也。”那唐王只管贪看，不肯前行，被太尉撮着脚，高呼道：“还不走，等甚！”扑的一声，望那渭河推下马去，却就脱了阴司，径回阳世。</p>

<P>The civil and military officials of the Tang court, Xu Maogong, Qin Shubao, Yuchi Jingde, Duan Zhixian, Ma Sanbao, Cheng Yaojin, Gao Shilian, Li Shiji, Fang Xuanling, Du Ruhui, Xiao Yu, Fu Yi, Zhang Daoyuan, Zhang Shiheng, Wang Gui and the others, as well as the empresses, imperial consorts and concubines, and pages were all in the White Tiger Hall. They were discussing whether to issue an edict of mourning to inform the world so that the heir could be put on the throne.</P>
<P>Wei Zheng was saying, &#8220;Gentlemen, stop this discussion. We must not do that. If the country is alarmed, anything might happen. If we wait for another day our master is bound to come back to life.&#8221; Xu Jingzong stepped forward from the lower ranks and protested, &#8220;Minister Wei is talking nonsense. As the old saying goes, 'split water can't be picked up and the dead can't come back to life.' What business have you to be spreading confusion with these groundless claims?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Mr. Xu,&#8221; Wei Zheng replied, &#8220;I can say truthfully that I have been given instruction in the magic arts since childhood and my predictions are extremely accurate. I can assure you that I have saved His Majesty from death.&#8221;</P>
<P>As they were arguing they heard loud shouts of &#8220;You're drowning me, you're drowning me,&#8221; coming from the coffin. The civil officials and the generals were struck with terror; the empresses and consorts shivered. Every one of them had</P>

<P>All the palace women fled, as not one of them dared to approach the imperial coffin. Luckily the upright Xu Maogong, the trusty Wei Zheng, the brave Qin Shubao, and the ferocious Yuchi Jingde went forward to put their hands on the coffin and shouted, &#8220;What is it that worries Your Majesty and makes you speak to us? Tell us, and do not haunt us and scare the royal family.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;His Majesty is not haunting us,&#8221; Wei Zheng said. &#8220;His Majesty has come back to life. Bring tools at once.&#8221; They opened the coffin and found Taizong sitting up inside and still shouting, &#8220;You're drowning me. Save me, someone.&#8221; Xu Maogong and the others helped him to his feet and said, &#8220;There is nothing to fear as you come round, Your Majesty. We are all here to protect you.&#8221; The Tang Emperor then opened his eyes and said, &#8220;We have been having an awful time: after escaping from the evil demons of the underworld, we were drowned.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Relax, Your Majesty, there is nothing to fear. How could you have drowned?&#8221; the ministers said. &#8220;We were riding along the banks of the River Wei and watching to fishes playing when that deceitful Marshal Zhu pushed us off the horse and made us fall into the river, where we all but drowned.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty still has something of the ghost about you,&#8221; said Wei Zheng, and he ordered the Imperial Medical Academy to send medicinal potions to settle the spirit and calm the soul at once; he also sent for some thin gruel. After one or two doses of the medicine the Emperor returned to normal and regained full consciousness. The Tang Emperor had been dead for three days and nights before returning to rule the world of the living once more. There is a poem to prove it:</P>

<p>此时众宫人走得精光，那个敢近灵扶柩。多亏了正直的徐茂功，理烈的魏丞相，有胆量的秦琼，忒猛撞的敬德，上前来扶着棺材，叫道：“陛下有什么放不下心处，说与我等，不要弄鬼，惊骇了眷族。”魏征道：“不是弄鬼，此乃陛下还魂也。快取器械来！”打开棺盖，果见太宗坐在里面，还叫“淹死我了！是谁救捞？”茂功等上前扶起道：“陛下苏醒莫怕，臣等都在此护驾哩。”唐王方才开眼道：“朕适才好苦，躲过阴司恶鬼难，又遭水面丧身灾。”众臣道：“陛下宽心勿惧，有甚水灾来？”唐王道：“朕骑着马，正行至渭水河边，见双头鱼戏，被朱太尉欺心，将朕推下马来，跌落河中，几乎淹死。”魏征道：“陛下鬼气尚未解。”急着太医院进安神定魄汤药，又安排粥膳。连服一二次，方才反本还原，知得人事。一计唐王死去，已三昼夜，复回阳间为君。诗曰：</p>

<P>As it was evening by then the ministers asked the Emperor to go to bed, and they all dispersed.</P>
<P>The next day they all took off their mourning garments and put colorful clothes back on. Wearing red robes and black hats, and with their golden seals of office hanging from purple ribbons at their waists, they stood outside the gates of the court awaiting the summons. As for Taizong, after taking the medicine to settle his spirit and calm his soul and drinking some thin gruel he was helped to his bedroom by his ministers.

<P>The Tang Emperor entered the throne hall, and when the two groups of civil and military officials had finished acclaiming him they divided into sections according to their ranks. When they heard the decree, &#8220;Let all those with business step forward from their sections and submit memorials, and let those with no business retire,&#8221; Xu Maogong, Wei Zheng, Wang Gui, Du Ruhui, Fang Xuanling, Yuan Tiangang, Li Chunfeng, Xu Jingzong and others stepped forward on the Eastern side; and on the Western side Yin Kaishan, Liu Hongji, Ma Sanbao, Duan Zhixian, Cheng Yaojin, Qin Shubao, Yuchi Jingde, Xue Rengui and others stepped forward also.</P>

<P>They advanced together, bowed low before the white jade steps, and asked in a memorial, &#8220;Why did it take Your Majesty so long to awake from your dream the other day?&#8221;</P>
<P>To this Taizong replied, &#8220;The other day we took Wei Zheng's letter and felt our soul leaving the palace. The horsemen of the Imperial Guard asked us to go hunting with them, and as we were going along the men and their horses all vanished. His Late Majesty and our dead brothers appeared and started to shout at us in a quarrelsome way. Things were getting very awkward when we saw a man in a black hat and gown who turned out to be the judge Cui Jue. When he had shouted at my dead brothers and driven them away we gave him Wei Zheng's letter. As he was reading it some servants in black holding banners led us in and took us to the Senluo Palace, where the Ten Kings of Hell were all sitting. They said that the dragon of the River Jing had falsely accused us of deliberately killing him after we had promised to save him, so we gave them a full account of what we told you about before. They said that the case had now been settled between the three orders, and ordered that the Registers of Birth and Death be brought at once so that they could see how long we were due to live. Judge Cui handed up the register, and they saw in it that we were due to reign for thirty-three years, which meant that we had another twenty years of life in front of us. They told Marshal Zhu and Judge Cui to escort us back. We took our leave of the Ten Kings and promised to send them some pumpkins and fruit as a mark of our thanks. After leaving the Senluo Palace we saw in the underworld how the disloyal, the unfilial, those who do not observe the rules of propriety, wasters of foodgrains, bullies, cheats, those who use false measures, adulterers, robbers, hypocrites, deceivers, debauchees, swindlers and the like undergo the agonies of being ground, burnt, pounded and sliced, and suffer the torments of being fried, boiled, hung in mid-air, and skinned. There were tens of thousands of them, far more than our eyes could take in. Then we went through the City of the Unjustly Slain where there were countless ghosts of the wrongly killed, and all of them, the chieftains of the sixty-four groups of rebels and the spirits of the seventy-two bands of rebels, blocking our way. Luckily Judge Cui acted as our guarantor and lent us one of the hoards of gold and silver of a Mr. Xiang of Henan, with which we were able to buy them off and continue on our way. Judge Cui told us that when we returned to the world of the living we had an inescapable obligation to hold a Great Mass to enable all those forlorn ghosts to be reborn, and with these instructions he took his leave. When I came out under the Wheel of the Six Paths of Being Marshal Zhu invited us to mount a horse. This horse seemed to fly to the banks of the River Wei, where I saw a pair of fish sporting in the water. Just as we were enjoying this sight the marshal grabbed our legs and tipped us into the water, and with that we returned to life.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the ministers had heard this they all congratulated him and they compiled a record of it; and all the prefectures and counties of the empire sent in memorials of felicitation.</p>

<P>Taizong issued a decree of amnesty for all the convicted criminals in the empire and ordered inquiries into the cases of all those held in jail on serious charges. The inspectors submitted to the throne the names of more than four hundred criminals who had been sentenced by the Ministry of Punishments to beheading or strangulation, and Taizong gave them a stay of execution, allowing them to go home to see their families and give their property to their relations; on the same day the following year they were to report to the authorities for their sentences to be carried out. The criminals thanked him for his mercy and withdrew. He also issued a notice about charity for orphans and released three thousand women of all ages from the palace to be married to members of the army.

<P>From then on everyone in the country did good deeds. Another notice was issued calling for a worthy man to take pumpkins to the underworld, and at the same time Yuchi Jingde, the Duke of E, was sent to Kaifeng in Henan to visit Xiang Liang and pay him back a hoard of jewels and a hoard of gold and silver. Some days after the notice had been issued a worthy man called Liu Quan from Junzhou came forward to deliver the pumpkins. He came from a family worth ten thousand strings of cash. When his wife Li Cuilian had taken a gold pin from her hair to give as an offering to a monk at the gate, Liu Quan had cursed her for being a loose wife who would not stay in the women's quarters. Li Cuilian, bitterly resenting this, had hanged herself, leaving a little boy and girl who had been crying night and day ever since. Liu Quan, unable to bear it any longer, wanted only to end his own life and abandon his family and his children. For this reason he had volunteered to deliver the pumpkins in death and came to the Tang Emperor with the imperial notice in his hand. The Emperor ordered him to go to the Golden Pavilion, where he was to put a pair of pumpkins on his head and some gold in his sleeve and drink poison.</p>

<p>自此时，盖天下无一人不行善者。一壁厢又出招贤榜，招人进瓜果到阴司里去；一壁厢将宝藏库金银一库，差鄂国公胡敬德上河南开封府，访相良还债。榜张数日，有一赴命进瓜果的贤者，本是均州人，姓刘名全，家有万贯之资。只因妻李翠莲在门首拔金钗斋僧，刘全骂了他几句，说他不遵妇道，擅出闺门。李氏忍气不过，自缢而死。撇下一双儿女年幼，昼夜悲啼。刘全又不忍见，无奈，遂舍了性命，弃了家缘，撇了儿女，情愿以死进瓜，将皇榜揭了，来见唐王。王传旨意，教他去金亭馆里，头顶一对南瓜，袖带黄钱，口噙药物。</p>

<P>Liu Quan drank the poison and died. In an instant his soul appeared at the Devil Gate with the pumpkins on his head. The demon officer at the gate asked, &#8220;Who are you, and how did you come here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have come on the orders of Emperor Taizong of the Great Tang to present some pumpkins to the Ten Kings of Hell.&#8221; The officer was only too pleased to let him in, and he went straight to the Senluo Palace, and when he was given audience with the Kings of Hell he presented the pumpkins to them and said, &#8220;I have brought these pumpkins a great distance in obedience to the decree of the Tang Emperor, who wishes to thank Your Majesties for their great mercy to him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How splendid of the Tang Emperor to be as good as his word,&#8221; exclaimed the ten delighted kings as they accepted the pumpkins. Then they asked him what he was called and where he was from.</P>
<P>&#8220;I am a commoner of the city of Junzhou,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;and my name is Liu Quan. As my wife Miss Li hanged herself and left a boy and a girl with nobody to look after them I wanted to abandon my family and children by giving my life for my country, so I brought this offering of pumpkins on behalf of my sovereign, who wanted to thank Your Majesties for your great mercy.&#8221; On hearing this the Ten Kings ordered a search for Liu Quan's wife, Miss Li. The devil messengers soon brought her to the Senluo Palace, outside which Liu Quan was reunited with her. They thanked the Ten Kings for their kindness and told them about the harsh words that had been spoken. On consulting the Registers of Birth and Death, the kings found that they were fated to become Immortals, so they ordered demon officers to take them back at once. The demon officers, however, asked in a report, &#8220;As Li Cuilian has been dead for some time her body has perished, so what is her soul to be attached to?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Li Yuying, the sister of the Tang Emperor, is due to die a sudden death today,&#8221; said the Kings of Hell, &#8220;so we can borrow her body to put Li Cuilian's soul back into.&#8221; On receiving this order the demon officers took Liu Quan and his wife out of the underworld to be brought back to life. If you don't know how they returned to life, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>
<!--电子版以上来自11章-->

<P>When the devil officers left the underworld with Liu Quan and his wife, a dark and whirling wind blew them straight to the great capital Chang'an, where Liu Quan's soul was sent to the Golden Pavilion and Li Cuilian's to an inner courtyard of the palace, where Princess Yuying could be seen walking slowing beside some moss under the shade of some blossoming trees. Suddenly the devil officers struck her full in the chest and knocked her over; they snatched the soul from her living body and put Li Cuilian's soul into the body in its place. With that they returned to the underworld.</p>

<P>When the palace serving-women saw her drop dead they rushed to the throne hall to report to the three empresses that Her Royal Highness the Princess had dropped dead. The shocked empresses passed the news on to Taizong who sighed and said, &#8220;We can well believe it. When we asked the Ten Lords of Hell if young and old in our palace would all be well, they replied that they would all be well except that our younger sister was going to die suddenly. How true that was.&#8221;</P>
<P>He and everyone else in the palace went with great sorrow to look at her lying under the trees, only to see that she was breathing very lightly.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't wail,&#8221; the Tang Emperor said, &#8220;don't wail; it might alarm her.&#8221; Then he raised her head with his own hand and said, &#8220;Wake up, sister, wake up.&#8221;</P>
<P>All of a sudden the princess sat up and called out, &#8220;Don't go so fast, husband. Wait for me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Sister, we're waiting for you here,&#8221; said the Emperor.</P>
<P>The princess lifted her head, opened her eyes, and looked at him. &#8220;Who are you?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;How dare you put your hands on us?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's your august brother, royal sister,&#8221; replied Taizong.</P>
<P>&#8220;I've got nothing to do with august brothers and royal sisters,&#8221; said the princess. &#8220;My maiden name is Li, and my full name is Li Cuilian. My husband is Liu Quan, and we both come from Junzhou. When I gave a gold hairpin to a monk at the gate three months ago my husband said harsh words to me about leaving the women's quarters and not behaving as a good wife should. It made me so angry and upset that I hanged myself from a beam with a white silk sash, leaving a boy and a girl who cried all night and all day. As my husband was commissioned by the Tang Emperor to go to he underworld to deliver some pumpkins, the Kings of Hell took pity on us and let the two of us come back to life. He went ahead, but I lagged behind. When I tried to catch him up I tripped. You are all quite shameless to be mauling me like this. I don't even know your names.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We think that Her Royal Highness is delirious after passing out when she fell,&#8221; said Taizong to the palace women. He sent an order to the Medical Academy for some medicinal potions, and helped Yuying into the palace.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>却说宫院中的大小侍婢，见玉英跌死，急走金銮殿，报与三宫皇后道：“宫主娘娘跌死也！”皇后大惊，随报太宗，太宗闻言点头叹曰：“此事信有之也。朕曾问十代阎君：‘老幼安乎？”他道：‘俱安，但恐御妹寿促。’果中其言。”合宫人都来悲切，尽到花阴下看时，只见那宫主微微有气。唐王道：“莫哭，莫哭！休惊了他。”遂上前将御手扶起头来，叫道：“御妹苏醒苏醒。”那宫主忽的翻身，叫：“丈夫慢行，等我一等！”太宗道：“御妹，是我等在此。”宫主抬头睁眼观看道：“你是谁人，敢来扯我？”太宗道：“是你皇兄、皇嫂。”宫主道：“我那里得个什么皇兄、皇嫂！我娘家姓李，我的乳名唤做李翠莲，我丈夫姓刘名全，两口儿都是均州人氏。因为我三个月前，拔金钗在门首斋僧，我丈夫怪我擅出内门，不遵妇道，骂了我几句，是我气塞胸堂，将白绫带悬梁缢死，撇下一双儿女，昼夜悲啼。今因我丈夫被唐王钦差，赴阴司进瓜果，阎王怜悯，放我夫妻回来。他在前走，因我来迟，赶不上他，我绊了一跌。你等无礼！不知姓名，怎敢扯我！”太宗闻言，与众宫人道：“想是御妹跌昏了，胡说哩。”传旨教太医院进汤药，将玉英扶入宫中。</p>

<div class="left"
<P>When the Tang Emperor was back in his throne-hall, one of his aides came rushing in to report, &#8220;Your Majesty, Liu Quan, the man who delivered the pumpkins, is awaiting your summons outside the palace gates.&#8221; The startled Taizong immediately sent for Liu Quan, who prostrated himself before the vermilion steps of the throne.</P>
<P>&#8220;What happened when you presented the pumpkins?&#8221; asked the Tang Emperor.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your subject went straight to the Devil Gate with the pumpkins on my head. I was taken to the Senluo Palace where I saw the Ten Kings of Hell, to whom I presented the pumpkins, explaining how very grateful my emperor was. The Kings of Hell were very pleased. They bowed in Your Majesty's honour and said, 'How splendid of the Tang Emperor to be as good as his word.'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What did you see in the underworld?&#8221; asked the Emperor.</P>
<P>&#8220;I did not go very far there so I did not see much. But when the kings asked me where I was from and what I was called, I told them all about how I had volunteered to leave my family and my children to deliver the pumpkins because my wife had hanged herself. They immediately ordered demon officers to bring my wife, and we were reunited outside the Senluo Palace. Meanwhile they inspected the Registers of Births and Deaths and saw that my wife and I were both due to become Immortals, so they sent devil officers to bring us back. I went ahead with my wife following behind, and although I was fortunate enough to come back to life, I don't know where her soul has been put.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What did the Kings of Hell say to you about your wife?&#8221; asked the astonished Emperor.</P>
<P>&#8220;They didn't say anything,&#8221; replied Liu Quan, &#8220;but I heard a demon officer say, 'As Li Cuilian has been dead for some time her body has decomposed.' To this the Kings of Hell said, 'Li Yuying of the Tang house is due to die today, so we can borrow her body to put Li Cuilian's soul back into.' As I don't know where this Tang house is or where she lives, I haven't been able to go and look for her yet.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Tang Emperor, who was now very pleased, said to his officials, &#8220;When we were leaving the Kings of Hell, we asked them about our family. They said all its members would be well except for my sister. She collapsed and died under the shade of some blossoming trees, and when we hurried over to support her she came to, shouting 'Don't go so fast, husband. Wait for me.' We thought at the time that she was just talking deliriously after passing out, but when we asked her to tell us more her story tallied precisely with Liu Quan's.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If Her Royal Highness died suddenly and came to shortly afterwards talking like this, then it means that Liu Quan's wife must have borrowed her body to come back to life,&#8221; said Wei Zheng. &#8220;Things like this do happen. The princess should be asked to come out so that we can hear what she says.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We have just ordered the Imperial Medical Academy to send some medicine, so we don't know whether it will be possible,&#8221; said the Tang Emperor, who then sent a consort into the palace to ask her to come out. The princess, meanwhile, was shouting wildly inside the palace, &#8220;I'm taking none of your medicine. This isn't my home. My home is a simple tiled house, not like this jaundiced, yellow place with its flashy doors. Let me out, let me out.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>唐王当殿，忽有当驾官奏道：“万岁，今有进瓜果人刘全还魂，在朝门外等旨。”唐王大惊，急传旨将刘全召进，俯伏丹墀。太宗问道：“进瓜果之事何如？”刘全道：“臣顶瓜果，径至鬼门关，引上森罗殿，见了那十代阎君，将瓜果奉上，备言我王殷勤致谢之意。阎君甚喜，多多拜上我王道：‘真是个有信有德的太宗皇帝’！”唐王道：“你在阴司见些什么来？”刘全道：“臣不曾远行，没见甚的，只闻得阎王问臣乡贯、姓名。臣将弃家舍子、因妻缢死、愿来进瓜之事，说了一遍，他急差鬼使，引过我妻，就在森罗殿下相会。一壁厢又检看死生文簿，说我夫妻都有登仙之寿，便差鬼使送回。臣在前走，我妻后行，幸得还魂。但不知妻投何所。”唐王惊问道：“那阎王可曾说你妻什么？”刘全道：“阎王不曾说什么，只听得鬼使说：‘李翠莲归阴日久，尸首无存。’阎王道：‘唐御妹李玉英今该促死，教翠莲即借玉英尸还魂去罢。’臣不知唐御妹是甚地方，家居何处，我还未曾得去找寻哩。”唐王闻奏，满心欢喜，当对多官道：“朕别阎君，曾问宫中之事，他言老幼俱安，但恐御妹寿促。却才御妹玉英，花阴下跌死，朕急扶看，须臾苏醒，口叫‘丈夫慢行，等我一等！’朕只道是他跌昏了胡言。又问他详细，他说的话，与刘全一般。”魏征奏道：“御妹偶尔寿促，少苏醒即说此言，此是刘全妻借尸还魂之事。此事也有，可请宫主出来，看他有甚话说。”唐王道：“朕才命太医院去进药，不知何如。”便教妃嫔入宫去请。那宫主在里面乱嚷道：“我吃什么药？这里那是我家！我家是清凉瓦屋，不象这个害黄病的房子，花狸狐哨的门扇！放我出去，放我出去！”</p>

<P>Four of five women officials and two or three eunuchs appeared while she was shouting and helped her go straight to the throne hall, where the Tang Emperor asked, &#8220;Would you recognize your husband if you saw him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a thing to ask! We've been married since we were children, and I've given him a son and a daughter, so of course I'd recognize him.&#8221; The Emperor told his attendants to help her down and she went down from the throne hall. As soon as she saw Liu Quan in front of the white jade steps she seized hold of him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Husband!&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;where did you go? Why didn't you wait for me? I tripped over, and all these shameless people surrounded me and shouted at me. Wasn't that shocking?&#8221; Although Liu Quan could hear that it was his wife talking, she looked like somebody else, so he did not dare to recognize her as his wife.</P>
<P>&#8220;Indeed,&#8221; said the Emperor,</P>
<P>&#8220;Sometimes mountains collapse and the earth yawns open,</P>
<P>But few men will shorten their lives to die for another.&#8221;</P>

<P>As he was a good and wise monarch he gave all of the princess' dressing-cases, clothes and jewelry to Liu Quan as if they were a dowry, presented him with an edict freeing him from labor service for life, and told him to take the princess home with him. Husband and wife thanked him before the steps and returned home very happily. There is a poem to prove it:</P>

</div>

<div class="right">
<p>正嚷处，只见四五个女官，两三个太监，扶着他，直至殿上。唐王道：“你可认得你丈夫么？”玉英道：“说那里话，我两个从小儿的结发夫妻，与他生男育女，怎的不认得？”唐王叫内官搀他下去。那宫主下了宝殿，直至白玉阶前，见了刘全，一把扯住道：“丈夫，你往那里去，就不等我一等！我跌了一跤，被那些没道理的人围住我嚷，这是怎的说！”那刘全听他说的话是妻之言，观其人非妻之面，不敢相认。唐王道：“这正是山崩地裂有人见，捉生替死却难逢！”好一个有道的君王，即将御妹的妆奁、衣物、首饰，尽赏赐了刘全，就如陪嫁一般，又赐与他永免差徭的御旨，着他带领御妹回去。他夫妻两个，便在阶前谢了恩，欢欢喜喜还乡。有诗为证：</p>

<P>The story turns to Lord Yuchi, who went to Kaifeng in Henan with a hoard of gold and silver for Xiang Liang, who made a living by selling water and dealing in black pots and earthenware vessels with his wife, whose maiden name was Zhang, at the gate of their house. When they made some money they were content to keep enough for their daily expenses, giving the rest as alms to monks or using it to buy paper ingots of gold and silver, which they assigned to various hoards in the underworld and burnt. That was why they were now to be so well rewarded. Although he was only a pious pauper in this world, he owned mountains of jade and gold in the other one. When Lord Yuchi brought them the gold and silver, Mr. and Mrs. Xiang were terrified out of their wits. Apart from his lordship there were also officials from the local government office, and horses and carriages were packed tight outside their humble cottage. The two of them fell to their knees dumbfounded and began to kowtow.</P>
<P>&#8220;Please rise,&#8221; said Lord Yuchi. &#8220;Although I am merely an imperial commissioner, I bring gold and silver from His Majesty to return to you.&#8221; Shivering and shaking Xiang Liang replied, &#8220;I've lent out no silver or gold, so how could I dare to accept this mysterious wealth?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I know that your are a poor man,&#8221; said Lord Yuchi, &#8220;but you have given monks everything they need and bought paper ingots of gold and silver which you have assigned to the underworld and burnt, thus accumulating large sums of money down there. When His Majesty the Emperor Taizong was dead for three days before returning to life he borrowed one of your hoards of gold and silver down there, which he is now repaying to you in full. Please check it through so that I can go back and report that I have carried out my instructions.&#8221; Xiang Liang and his wife just went on bowing to Heaven and refused to take the gold and silver.</P>
<P>&#8220;If humble folk like ourselves took all this gold and silver it'd soon be the death of us. Although we have burned some paper and assigned it to various stores, it was a secret. Anyhow, what proof is there that His Majesty&#8212;may he live for ten thousand years&#8212;borrowed gold and silver down there? We refuse to accept it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The Emperor said that Judge Cui was his guarantor when he borrowed your money, and this can be verified, so please accept it,&#8221; replied Lord Yuchi.</P>
<P>&#8220;I would sooner die than do so,&#8221; said Xiang Liang.</P>
<P>Seeing how earnestly he refused Lord Yuchi had to send a man back with a detailed report to the throne. On reading this report that Xiang Liang had refused to accept the gold and silver, Taizong said, &#8220;He really is a pious old fellow.&#8221; He sent orders to Yuchi Jingde that he was to build a temple in his name, erect a shrine to him, and invite monks to do good deeds on his behalf: this would be as good as paying him back the gold and silver. On the day this decree reached him Yuchi Jingde turned towards the palace to thank the Emperor, and read it aloud for all to hear. Then he bought fifty mu of land at a place inside the city that would not be in the way from either the civil or the military point of view, and here work was begun on a monastery to be called The Imperially Founded Xiang Quo Monastery. To its left was erected a shrine to Mr. and Mrs. Xiang with an inscribed tablet that read &#8220;Built under the supervision of Lord Yuchi.&#8221; This is the present Great Xiang Guo Monastery.</p>

<P>When he was informed that work had been completed Taizong was very pleased, and assembling the multitude of officials he issued a notice summoning monks to come and hold a Great Mass for the rebirth of those lonely souls in the underworld. As the notice traveled throughout the empire the local officials everywhere recommended holy and venerable monks to go to Chang'an for the service. By the end of the month many monks had arrived in Chang'an from all over the empire. The Emperor issued a decree ordering Fu Yi, the Deputy Annalist, to select some venerable monks to perform Buddhist ceremonies. On hearing this command Fu Yi sent up a memorial requesting a ban on the building of pagodas and saying that there was no Buddha. It read:</p>

<P>By the Law of the West there are no distinctions between ruler and subject or between father and son; the Three Paths and the Six Roads are used to deceive the foolish; past sins are chased away to filch future blessings; and Sanskrit prayers are recited in attempts to avoid retribution. Now birth, death and the length of life are in fact decided by nature; and punishments, virtue, power and blessings come from the lord of men. But these days vulgar believers distort the truth and say that they all come from Buddha. In the time of the Five Emperors and Three Kings of antiquity this Buddha did not exist, yet rulers were enlightened, subjects were loyal, and prosperity lasted for many a long year. When foreign gods were first established in the time of Emperor Ming of the Han Dynasty, sramanas from the West began to propagate their religion. This is in reality a foreign encroachment on China, and it does not merit belief.</p>

<p>西域之法，无君臣父子，以三途六道，蒙诱愚蠢，追既往之罪，窥将来之福，口诵梵言，以图偷免。且生死寿夭，本诸自然；刑德威福，系之人主。今闻俗徒矫托，皆云由佛。自五帝三王，未有佛法，君明臣忠，年祚长久。至汉明帝始立胡神，然惟西域桑门，自传其教，实乃夷犯中国，不足为信。</p>

<P>When he had heard this read to him Taizong tossed it to his other officials for debate. The minister Xiao Yu stepped forward from the ranks, kowtowed and said, &#8220;The Buddha's law has flourished for several dynasties, and by spreading good and preventing evil it gives unseen help to the state; there is no reason why it would be abolished. Buddha was a sage. Those who deny sages are lawless. I request that he be severely punished.&#8221; Fu Yi argued with Xiao Yu, pointing out that correct behavior was derived from serving one's parents and one's sovereign, whereas the Buddha turned his back on his parents, resisting the Son of Heaven although he was but a commoner, and rebelling against his mother and father with the body that they gave him. Xiao Yu had not been born in an empty mulberry tree, but he honoured a religion that denied fathers; this indeed proved that he who had no sense of filial piety denied his father.</P>
<P>All Xiao Yu did was to put his hands together and say, &#8220;Hell must have been made for men such as him.&#8221; Taizong sent for the High Chamberlain Zhang Daoyuan and the Head of the Secretariat Zhang Shiheng to ask them how effectively Buddhist ritual obtained blessings.</P>
<P>&#8220;The Buddha dwells in purity, benevolence and mercy,&#8221; the two officers replied, &#8220;and the True Result is Buddha-emptiness. Emperor Wu of the Northern Zhou Dynasty placed the Three Teachings in an order. The Chan Master Dahui wrote a poem in praise of the distant and mysterious. If the masses support monks, anything can happen. The Five Patriarchs came down to their mothers' wombs, and Bodhidharma appeared. From remotest antiquity everyone has said that the Three Teachings are highly venerable and cannot be destroyed or abolished. We humbly beg Your Majesty to give us his perceptive ruling.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your submission makes sense,&#8221; said the delighted Taizong. &#8220;If anyone else makes further comments, he will be punished.&#8221; He then ordered Wei Zheng, Xiao Yu and Zhang Daoyuan to invite all the monks and select one of great virtue to be Master of Ceremonies. They all bowed to thank him and withdrew. From then on there was a new law: anyone who injured a monk or slandered the Buddha would lose his arm.</p>

<p>太宗闻言，遂将此表掷付群臣议之。时有宰相萧星，出班俯囟奏曰：“佛法兴自屡朝，弘善遏恶，冥助国家，理无废弃。佛，圣人也。非圣者无法，请置严刑。”傅奕与萧星论辨，言礼本于事亲事君，而佛背亲出家，以匹夫抗天子，以继体悖所亲，萧星不生于空桑，乃遵无父之教，正所谓非孝者无亲。萧星但合掌曰：“地狱之设，正为是人。”太宗召太仆卿张道源、中书令张士衡，问佛事营福，其应何如。二臣对曰：“佛在清净仁恕，果正佛空。周武帝以三教分次：大慧禅师有赞幽远，历众供养而无不显；五祖投胎，达摩现象。自古以来，皆云三教至尊而不可毁，不可废。伏乞陛下圣鉴明裁。”太宗甚喜道：“卿之言合理。再有所陈者，罪之。”遂着魏征与萧星、张道源，邀请诸佛，选举一名有大德行者作坛主，设建道场，众皆顿首谢恩而退。自此时出了法律：但有毁僧谤佛者，断其臂。</p>

<P>The next day the three court officials assembled all the monks at the altar among rivers and hills, and they went through them all one by one. From among them they chose a venerable and virtuous monk. Do you know who he was?</P>

<p>次日，三位朝臣，聚众僧，在那山川坛里，逐一从头查选，内中选得一名有德行的高僧。你道他是谁人——</p>

<P>Fully versed in the basic mystery, his title was Golden Cicada;</P>

<P>From the moment he entered the womb he met with evil,</P>
<P>Before he left it he encountered a gang of villains.</P>

<P>That day the Reverend Xuanzang was chosen from among all the monks. He had been a monk from infancy, and ever since birth he had eaten vegetarian food and observed the prohibitions. His maternal grandfather was an imperial commander, Yin Kaishan. His father Chen Guangrui had come top in the Palace Examination and had been appointed a grand secretary in the Imperial Library. Xuanzang, however, had no interest in honour and glory, and his only joy was to cultivate Nirvana. Investigation revealed that his origins were good and his virtue great; of the thousand sutras and ten thousand holy books there was not a single one that he did not know; he could sing every Buddhist chant and knew all the religious music. The three officials took him to the imperial presence, where they danced and stirred up the dust. When they had bowed they reported, &#8220;Your subject Xiao Yu and the rest of us have chosen a venerable monk called Chen Xuanzang in obedience to the imperial decree.&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing his name Taizong thought deeply for a long time and then asked, &#8220;Is that the Xuanzang who is the son of Grand Secretary Chen Guangrui?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your subject is he,&#8221; replied Xuanzang with a kowtow.</P>
<P>&#8220;Then you were indeed well chosen,&#8221; said the Emperor with satisfaction. &#8220;You are indeed a monk of virtuous conduct of a mind devoted to meditation. I give you the offices of Left Controller of the Clergy, Right Controller of the Clergy, and Hierarch of the Empire.&#8221; Xuanzang kowtowed to express his thanks and accepted the appointments. The Emperor then gave him a multicolored golden cassock and a Vairocana miter, telling him to be sure he conscientiously continued to visit enlightened monks, and giving him the position at the top of the hierarchy. He gave him a decree in writing ordering him to go to the Huasheng Temple to pick a propitious day and hour on which to begin the recitations of the scriptures.</p>

<p>当日对众举出玄奘法师。这个人自幼为僧，出娘胎，就持斋受戒。他外公见是当朝一路总管殷开山，他父亲陈光蕊，中状元，官拜文渊殿大学士。一心不爱荣华，只喜修持寂灭。查得他根源又好，德行又高。千经万典，无所不通；佛号仙音，无般不会。当时三位引至御前，扬尘舞蹈，拜罢奏曰：“臣星等蒙圣旨，选得高僧一名陈玄奘。”太宗闻其名，沉思良久道：“可是学士陈光蕊之儿玄奘否？”江流儿叩头曰：“臣正是。”太宗喜道：“果然举之不错，诚为有德行有禅心的和尚。朕赐你左僧纲、右僧纲、天下大阐都僧纲之职。”玄奘顿首谢恩，受了大阐官爵。又赐五彩织金袈裟一件，毗卢帽一顶。教他用心再拜明僧，排次庠黎班首，书办旨意，前赴化生寺，择定吉日良时，开演经法。</p>

<P>Xuanzang bowed, took the decree, and went to the Huasheng Temple where he assembled many monks, had meditation benches made, prepared for the mass, and chose the music. He selected a total of twelve hundred high and humble monks of enlightenment, who he divided into an upper, a middle and a lower hall. All the holy objects were neatly arranged before all the Buddhas. The third day of the ninth month of that year was chosen an auspicious day on which to start the seven times seven days of the Great Land and Water Mass. This was all reported to the throne, and at the appointed time Taizong, the high civil and military officials, and the royal family went to the service to burn incense and listen to the preaching.

<p>玄奘再拜领旨而出，遂到化生寺里，聚集多僧，打造禅榻，装修功德，整理音乐。选得大小明僧共计一千二百名，分派上中下三堂。诸所佛前，物件皆齐，头头有次。选到本年九月初三日，黄道良辰，开启做七七四十九日水陆大会。即具表申奏，太宗及文武国戚皇亲，俱至期赴会，拈香听讲。毕竟不知圣意如何，且听下回分解。	</div>
