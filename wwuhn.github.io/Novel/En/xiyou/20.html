<P>In the Cloud Pathway Cave Sun Wukong Wins over Zhu Bajie</P>
<P>On Pagoda Mountain Xuanzang Receives<I> the Heart Sutra</I></P>
	</div>

<P>The monster shot forward as a stream of sparks, with the Great Sage behind him on his coloured cloud. As he was racing along, Monkey saw a tall mountain appear in front of them. Here the monster put himself together again by reassembling the sparks, rushed into a cave, and came out with a nine-pronged rake in his hand to do battle.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wretch,&#8221; shouted Monkey, &#8220;where are you from? How do you know my name, you evil demon? What powers have you got? Tell me honestly, and I'll spare your life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't know what I can do,&#8221; the monster replied. &#8220;Come a little nearer and stand still while I tell you:</P>


<P>I was born stupid,</P>
<P>An idler and a slacker.</P>
<P>I never nourished my nature or cultivated the truth,</P>
<P>But spent my time in primal ignorance.</P>
<P>Then I happened to meet a true Immortal,</P>
<P>Who sat down with me and chatted about the weather,</P>
<P>Advised me to reform and not to sink among mortals,</P>
<P>For taking life was a heinous sin.</P>
<P>One day, when my life came to an end,</P>
<P>It would be too late to regret the punishments in store.</P>
<P>His words moved me to seek reform,</P>
<P>And my heart longed for miraculous spells.</P>
<P>I was lucky enough to have him as my teacher;</P>
<P>He showed me the gates of Heaven and Earth.</P>
<P>He taught me the Nine Changes and the Great Return of Cinnabar,</P>
<P>As we worked by night and day with never a break.</P>
<P>It reached up to the Mud Ball Palace in my head,</P>
<P>And down to the Bubbling Spring in my feet.</P>
<P>The circulating magic liquid reached the Flowery Pool under my tongue,</P>
<P>And the Cinnabar Field in my abdomen was given extra warmth.</P>
<P>The Babe, lead, and the Girl, mercury, were married,</P>
<P>And combining together, they divided into sun and moon.</P>
<P>The Dragon and the Tiger were harmonized,</P>
<P>The Sacred Tortoise drank the Golden Crow's blood.</P>
<P>The Three Flowers gathered at the top and returned to the root.</P>
<P>The Five Essences faced the Origin and flowed in all directions.</P>
<P>When their work was done, I could fly,</P>
<P>And the Immortals of Heaven came in pairs to greet me.</P>
<P>Coloured clouds grew beneath my feet,</P>
<P>As I faced Heavenly Palace gates with a body light and strong.</P>
<P>The Jade Emperor gave a banquet for all the Immortals,</P>
<P>And all lined up according to their grades.</P>
<P>I was made Field Marshal in charge of the Milky Way,</P>
<P>Commanding all the sailors on that river in the sky.</P>
<P>When the Queen Mother gave a Peach Banquet,</P>
<P>She invited many guests to the Jade Pool.</P>
<P>As drunkenness clouded my mind that day,</P>
<P>I lurched and staggered around.</P>
<P>As I charged in drunken pride into the Cool Broad Palace</P>
<P>I was greeted by an exquisite immortal maiden.</P>
<P>At the sight of her beauty my soul was captivated,</P>
<P>And I could not repress my mortal passions of old.</P>
<P>Losing all sense of rank and dignity,</P>
<P>I seized the beauty and asked her to sleep with me.</P>
<P>Three times, four times she refused,</P>
<P>Dodging and trying to hide in her distress.</P>
<P>Great was the courage of my lust, and I roared like thunder,</P>
<P>All but shaking down the gates of heaven.</P>
<P>The Miraculous Inspecting Officer reported to the Jade Emperor,</P>
<P>And from that day I was doomed.</P>
<P>The Cool Broad Palace was closely surrounded.</P>
<P>I could neither advance nor retreat: escape was impossible.</P>
<P>Then I was arrested by the gods,</P>
<P>But as I was still drunk I was not scared.</P>
<P>I was marched to the Hall of Miraculous Mist to see the Jade Emperor,</P>
<P>And, after questioning, sentenced to death.</P>
<P>Luckily the Great White Planet</P>
<P>Stepped forward, bowed low, and interceded.</P>
<P>My sentence was commuted to two thousand strokes of the heavy rod,</P>
<P>Which tore my flesh and all but smashed my bones.</P>
<P>I was released alive and expelled from Heaven,</P>
<P>So I tried to make a living on the Mount of Blessing.</P>
<P>For my sins I was reborn from the wrong womb,</P>
<P>And now I am known as Iron-haired Pig.&#8221;</P>


<P>&#8220;So you are an earthly reincarnation of Marshal Tian Peng,&#8221; said Brother Monkey when he heard this. &#8220;No wonder you knew my name.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Ha,&#8221; the monster snorted angrily. &#8220;Your insane rebellion caused trouble for very many of us, Protector of the Horses. Have you come here to throw your weight around again? I'll teach you some manners. Take this!&#8221; Monkey was in no mood to spare him after this, and he struck at the monster's head with his cudgel. The pair of them fought a magnificent midnight battle on that mountainside:</P>


<P>Monkey's golden pupils flashed with lightning;</P>
<P>The monster's glaring eyes sparked silver.</P>
<P>One disgorged coloured mist,</P>
<P>The other breathed out red clouds.</P>
<P>The red clouds lit up the night;</P>
<P>The coloured mists illuminated the darkness.</P>
<P>A gold-banded cudgel,</P>
<P>A nine-toothed rake,</P>
<P>And two splendid heroes.</P>
<P>One a Great Sage down among the mortals,</P>
<P>The other a marshal banished from Heaven.</P>
<P>One had been stripped of his honors and become a monster,</P>
<P>The other had been saved when he took service with a priest.</P>
<P>When the rake attacked, it was like a dragon stretching its claws;</P>
<P>The cudgel blocked it as nimbly as a phoenix flying through flowers.</P>


<P>Pig said,</P>


<P>&#8220;In wrecking my marriage your crime is as great as parricide.&#8221;</P>


<P>Monkey replied,</P>


<P>&#8220;You deserve to be arrested for raping that young girl.&#8221;</P>


<P>Amid these exchanges</P>
<P>And wild shouts,</P>
<P>The cudgel and the rake crossed and clashed.</P>
<P>They fought each other till the day began to dawn,</P>
<P>And the monster's arms were tired right out.</P>


<P>They fought from the second watch of the night until the sky began to grow light in the East. The monster, no longer able to resist his enemy, broke away and fled, turning himself into a hurricane again. He went straight back to his cave, shut the gates behind him, and did not come out. Monkey saw a stone tablet outside the cave on which was inscribed CLOUD PATHWAY CAVE. The monster did not come out again and it was now broad daylight, so Monkey thought that as his master might be waiting for him he had better go back to see him. He could come back later to catch the monster. He gave his cloud a kick and was back in Old Gao Village in an instant.</P>
<P>Sanzang, meanwhile, had been talking all night with the elders about things ancient and modern, and had not slept a wink. Just as he was beginning to think that Brother Monkey would not come back, Monkey appeared in the courtyard, put away his iron club, straightened his clothes, and entered the main room.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master, I'm here,&#8221; he announced, giving the old men such a surprise that they all fell to their knees and thanked him for his efforts.</P>
<P>&#8220;You've been out all night, Monkey,&#8221; Sanzang said. &#8220;Where did you catch that evil spirit?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He's no common or garden ghost, master,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and he isn't an ordinary wild animal turned monster. He is Marshal Tian Peng, who was exiled to the mortal world. As he was placed in the wrong womb he has a face like a wild boar, but he's still kept his original divine nature. He says that he takes his name from his looks and is called Zhu Ganglie, Iron-haired Pig. I was going to kill him in the building at the back, but he turned into a hurricane and fled. When I struck at this wind, he changed into sparks, went straight back to his cave, came out with a nine-pronged rake, and fought me all night. He broke off the engagement in terror as the dawn broke and shut himself in his cave. I was going to smash down the gates and have it out with him, but then it occurred to me that you might be worried after waiting for me so long, so I came back to put you in the picture first.&#8221;</P>
<P>After Monkey had made his report, Squire Gao came up and knelt before him saying, &#8220;Venerable sir, I'm afraid that although you've chased him away, he'll come back after you've gone; so this is no real solution. Please, I beg of you, catch him for me and exterminate him to prevent trouble later. I promise you that I shall not be remiss if you do this for me, and there will, of course, be rich rewards. I shall write a deed, witnessed by my relations and friends, giving you half of my property and my land. Please, please eradicate this evil weed and save the honour of the family.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've got no sense of what's proper, old man,&#8221; replied Monkey with a grin. &#8220;He told me that although he may have put away a lot of your rice and tea, he's also done you a lot of good. You've piled up a lot of wealth in the past few years, all thanks to his efforts. He says he hasn't been eating your food in idleness, and wants to know why you're trying to have him exorcised. He maintains that he is a heavenly Immortal come down to earth who has been working for your family and has never harmed your daughter. I would say that he is a very fitting son-in-law for you, who does your family's name no harm. You really ought to keep him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Venerable sir,&#8221; the old man replied, &#8220;he may never have done anything wicked, but it does our reputation no good to have a son-in-law like him. Whether he does anything or not, people say that the Gaos have asked a monster to marry into the family, and I simply can't bear to hear a thing like that.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Go and have it out with him, and then we'll see what to do,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll try a trick on him this time,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;I guarantee to bring him back this time for you to look at. But don't be angry with him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Old Gao,&#8221; he continued, addressing the old man, &#8220;look after my master well. I'm off.&#8221;</P>
<P>By the time the words were out of his mouth, he had disappeared. He leapt up the mountain and smashed the gates of the cave to splinters with a single blow of his cudgel, shouting, &#8220;Come out and fight Monkey, you chaff-guzzling moron.&#8221; The monster, who had been snoring inside, heard the gates being smashed and the insulting &#8220;chaff-guzzling moron,&#8221; and went wild with fury.</P>
<P>Seizing his rake and summoning up his spirit, he rushed out and shrieked, &#8220;You shameless Protector of the Horses. What have I ever done to you to make you smash down my gates? You'd better take a look at the statute book: there's the death penalty for breaking and entering.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You fool,&#8221; laughed Monkey, &#8220;I've got a very good justification for smashing your gates&#8212;you abducted a girl by force, without matchmakers or witnesses, and without giving proper presents or observing the right ceremonies. You're a fine one to talk about who deserves to have his head cut off.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop talking such nonsense and see how this rake of mine strikes you,&#8221; the monster replied.</P>
<P>Blocking the blow with his cudgel, Monkey retorted, &#8220;Is that the rake you used when you were tilling the fields and growing vegetables for the Gaos as their hired hand? What's so wonderful about it that I should be afraid of you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't realize that it's no ordinary weapon,&#8221; the monster replied. &#8220;You'd better listen while I tell you about it:</P>


<P>This was refined from divine ice-iron,</P>
<P>Polished till it gleamed dazzling white,</P>
<P>Hammered by Lord Lao Zi himself,</P>
<P>While Ying Huo fed the fire with coal-dust.</P>
<P>The Five Emperors of the Five Regions applied their minds to it,</P>
<P>The Six Dings and Six jias went to great efforts.</P>
<P>They made nine teeth of jade,</P>
<P>Cast a pair of golden rings to hang beneath them,</P>
<P>Decorated the body with the Six Bright Shiners and the Five planets,</P>
<P>Designed it in accordance with the Four Seasons and the Eight Divisions.</P>
<P>The length of top and bottom match Heaven and Earth.</P>
<P>Positive and Negative were to left and right, dividing the sun and moon.</P>
<P>The Six Divine Generals of the Oracular Lines are there, following the Heavenly Code;</P>
<P>The constellations of the Eight Trigrams are set out in order.</P>
<P>It was named the Supremely Precious Gold-imbued Rake,</P>
<P>And served to guard the gates of the Jade Emperor's palace.</P>
<P>As I had become a great Immortal,</P>
<P>I now enjoyed eternal life,</P>
<P>And was commissioned as Marshal Tian Peng,</P>
<P>With this rake to mark my imperial office.</P>
<P>When I raise it, fire and light stream forth;</P>
<P>When I lower it, a snowy blizzard blows.</P>
<P>It terrifies the Heavenly Generals,</P>
<P>And makes the King of Hell too quake with fear.</P>
<P>There is no other weapon matching it on Earth,</P>
<P>Nor iron to rival it throughout the world.</P>
<P>It changes into anything I like,</P>
<P>And leaps about whenever I say the spell.</P>
<P>For many a year I've carried it around,</P>
<P>Keeping it with me every single day.</P>
<P>I will not put it down even to eat,</P>
<P>Nor do I when I sleep at night.</P>
<P>I took it with me to the Peach Banquet,</P>
<P>And carried it into the celestial court.</P>
<P>When I sinned my sin in drunken pride,</P>
<P>I used it to force compliance with my evil will.</P>
<P>When Heaven sent me down to the mortal dust,</P>
<P>I committed all kinds of wickedness down here.</P>
<P>I used to devour people in this cave,</P>
<P>Until I fell in love and married in Gao Village.</P>
<P>This rake has plunged beneath the sea to stir up dragons,</P>
<P>And climbed high mountains to smash up tigers' dens.</P>
<P>No other blade is worth a mention</P>
<P>Besides my rake, the sharpest weapon ever.</P>
<P>To win a fight with it requires no effort;</P>
<P>Of course it always brings me glory.</P>
<P>Even if you have an iron brain in a brazen head and a body of steel,</P>
<P>This rake will scatter your souls and send your spirit flying.&#8221;</P>


<P>Monkey put his cudgel away and replied, &#8220;Stop shooting your mouth off, you idiot. I'm now sticking my head out for you to hit. Let's see you scatter my souls and send my spirits flying.&#8221; The monster raised his rake and brought it down with all his might, but although flames leapt forth, it did not even scratch Monkey's scalp.</P>
<P>The monster's arms and legs turned to jelly with fright as he exclaimed, &#8220;What a head, what a head.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You wouldn't know,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;When I was captured by the Little Sage for wrecking the Heavenly Palace, stealing the pills of immortality and the heavenly peaches, and filching the imperial wine, I was marched to a place outside the Dipper and Bull Palace, where all the gods of Heaven hacked at me with axes, hit me with maces, cut at me with swords, stabbed at me with daggers, tried to burn me with lightning, and pounded me with thunder; but none of it hurt me in the slightest. Then I was taken off by the Great High Lord Lao and put in the Eight Trigrams Furnace, where I was refined with divine fire, so that my eyes are now fiery, my pupils golden, my head brazen, and my shoulders of iron. If you don't believe me, try a few more blows to see whether you can hurt me or not.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I remember you, you baboon,&#8221; the monster replied. &#8220;When you made trouble in Heaven, you lived in the Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit in the land of Aolai in the Continent of Divine Victory. I haven't heard of you for a very long time. What brings you here, and why are you bullying me in front of my own gates? Surely my father-in-law didn't go all that way to ask you to come here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;he didn't. I have turned away from evil and been converted to good. I have given up Taoism and become a Buddhist. I am protecting the Patriarch Sanzang, the younger brother of the Great Tang Emperor, on his journey to the Western Heaven to visit the Buddha and ask for the scriptures. We happened to ask for a night's lodging when we came to Gao Village, and in the course of our conversation Old Gao asked me to rescue his daughter and capture you, you chaff-guzzling moron.&#8221;</P>
<P>The monster dropped his rake to the ground, chanted a respectful &#8220;na-a-aw,&#8221; and said, &#8220;Where's this pilgrim? Please take me to meet him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you want to see him for?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Guanyin converted me and told me to obey the monastic rules and eat vegetarian food here till I could go with that pilgrim, the one who's going to the Western Heaven to worship the Buddha and ask for the scriptures. I'll be able to make up for my sins through this good deed, and win a good reward. I've been waiting for him for years, but there's been no news of him till now. If you're a disciple of his, why didn't you say something about fetching the scriptures before, instead of making this vicious attack on me in my own home?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This had better not be a trick to soften me up and make me let you get away,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;If you really want to protect the Tang Priest and you aren't trying to kid me, then you'd better make a vow to Heaven, and I'll take you to meet my master.&#8221; The monster fell to his knees with a thud, and kowtowed to the sky so often that he looked like a rice pestle.</P>
<P>&#8220;Amitabha Buddha,&#8221; he cried out, &#8220;if I'm not completely sincere, cut me up into ten thousand bits for breaking the laws of Heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>After hearing him swear this oath, Monkey said, &#8220;Very well then, now light a brand and burn this place of yours out. If you do that, I'll take you.&#8221; The monster piled up some reeds and brambles, lit a brand, and set the Cloud Pathway Cave on fire; it burned as well as a brick kiln that has got out of control. &#8220;I've no second thoughts,&#8221; he said, &#8220;so please take me to see him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Give me that rake of yours,&#8221; Monkey ordered, and the monster obediently handed it over. Monkey then plucked out a hair, blew on it with magic breath, and shouted, &#8220;Change!&#8221; It turned into three lengths of hempen rope, with which he bound the monster's hands behind his back; the monster docilely put his hands there and let Monkey tie him up. Then Monkey seized him by the ear and led him off with the words, &#8220;Quick march.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Take it easy,&#8221; the monster pleaded. &#8220;You're pulling so hard you're hurting my ear.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Can't be done,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Can't show you any favours. As the old saying has it, 'even a good pig must be handled roughly.' Wait until you've seen my master. If you really are sincere, you'll be released then.&#8221; The two of them went back through cloud and mist to Gao Village, and there is a poem to prove it:</P>


<P>The Golden Vajra is stronger than Wood,</P>
<P>The Mind Ape could bring the Wooden Dragon to submission.</P>
<P>When Metal obeyed and Wood was tamed they were at one;</P>
<P>When Wood was loving and Metal kind they worked together.</P>
<P>One host and one guest with nothing to keep them apart,</P>
<P>With the three in harmony they had a mysterious power.</P>
<P>Nature and feelings both rejoiced as they joined in the Supreme Principle;</P>
<P>They both promised without reservation to go to the West.</P>


<P>In a moment they were back at the village. Holding the monster's rake in one hand and twisting his ear with the other, he said, &#8220;Do you know who that is sitting up straight in the main hall? It's my master.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Old Gao and all his friends and relations saw Monkey coming, tugging the bound monster by his ear, they all came into the courtyard and said happily, &#8220;Venerable sir, this is the son-in-law all right.&#8221; The monster went forward, fell to his knees, and kowtowed to Sanzang with his hands behind his back.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;Your disciple failed to welcome you. Had I known, master, that you were staying in my father-in-law's house, I'd have come to greet you and do homage, and I'd have been saved all this agony.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How did you make him submit and come to pay homage?&#8221; Sanzang asked Monkey.</P>
<P>Monkey then let the monster go, hit him with the handle of the rake, and yelled, &#8220;Tell him, fool.&#8221; The monster then told Sanzang all about how he had been converted by the Bodhisattva.</P>
<P>Sanzang was so pleased that he asked Squire Gao for an incense table to be brought, which was done at once. Sanzang then washed his hands, burnt incense, bowed low to the South, and said, &#8220;Thanks be to the Bodhisattva for her divine grace.&#8221; The elders also burnt incense and bowed low in worship. When this was done, Sanzang took the seat of honour in the hall and told Monkey to untie the monster. Monkey shook himself to take his hairs back, and the ropes untied themselves. The monster bowed to Sanzang once more and vowed to go to the West with him. Then he bowed to Monkey as his elder brother because he had joined first, addressing him as &#8220;elder brother&#8221; from then on. &#8220;If you wish to earn a good reward by going with me as my disciple, I'll give you a Buddhist name to call you by.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;When the Bodhisattva laid her hands upon my head and told me to obey the prohibitions, she gave me a Buddhist name&#8212;Zhu Wuneng, Pig Awakened to Power.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wonderful, wonderful,&#8221; said Brother Monkey with a smile, &#8220;I'm called Wukong, Awakened to Emptiness, and you're called Awakened to Power. That makes us members of the same sect in the Buddhist faith.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;I have been instructed by the Bodhisattva and I never eat the five stinking foods and the three forbidden meats&#8212;wild goose, dog, and snakehead. I've eaten vegetarian food in my father-in-law's house and never touched the stinking foods; but now that I have met you, master, I'm freed from these restrictions.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You are not,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;You are not to eat the five stinking foods and the three forbidden meats, and I'm giving you another name: Eight Prohibitions, or Bajie.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I shall obey my master's command,&#8221; the moron happily replied, and from then on he was known as Zhu Bajie, or Eight Prohibitions Pig.</P>
<P>Squire Gao was happier than ever to see that he had turned from evil to good, and he ordered his servants to set out banquet with which to thank the Tang Priest. Pig went over to Squire Gao, tugged at his coat, and said, &#8220;Sir, may my wife come out and pay her respects to these two gentlemen?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Monkey with a laugh. &#8220;You've entered the church now and become a monk. Don't ever talk about a wife again. Only Taoist priests can have families&#8212;we Buddhist monks never marry. Let's all sit down and eat a vegetarian meal, then we can set off early tomorrow morning on our journey to the West.&#8221; Squire Gao had the table and chairs set out and asked Sanzang take the seat of honour. Monkey and Pig sat on his left and right, and all the relations sat below them. Squire Gao opened a pot of wine, from which he filled a cup and poured a libation to Heaven and Earth before handing it to Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;Frankly, sir,&#8221; Sanzang said, &#8220;I have been a vegetarian from the womb, and have not consumed strong-flavoured food since my earliest childhood.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Venerable master, I know that you are a vegetarian,&#8221; Squire Gao replied, &#8220;which is why I haven't pressed any meat or strong-flavoured food upon you. But this wine is made from vegetable matter, so a cup of it will do no harm.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I don't drink either,&#8221; Sanzang explained, &#8220;as alcohol is the first of the prohibitions of the priesthood.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; pig hastily interjected, &#8220;I may be a vegetarian, but I haven't given up liquor.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;And although I haven't strong head for the stuff and can't finish a whole jar of it, I haven't given it up either,&#8221; Monkey added.</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case you two had better drink some; but don't get drunk and ruin everything,&#8221; said Sanzang. The pair of them then took the first cup, after which everyone sat down again as the vegetarian dishes were brought in. Words could not describe the flowing cups, the well-filled dishes, and the splendid food.</P>
<P>When master and disciples had eaten, Squire Gao brought pieces of gold and silver to the weight of two hundred ounces on a red lacquer tray and offered them to the three pilgrims to help with the expenses of their journey. Then he produced three brocade-collared gowns that could serve as overcoats. &#8220;We are mendicant monks,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;Who beg for our food in the villages and other places through which we pass, so we could not possibly accept gold, silver, or cloth.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey then marched up and grabbed a handful of the money. Then he addressed the young man Gao Cai. &#8220;Yesterday,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I troubled you to lead my master here, and today he has recruited another disciple, but we have been unable to show our gratitude. So take these pieces of gold and silver as your fee for guiding us, and buy yourself a pair of straw sandals. If you have any more evil spirits in future, and you help us again, we'll be able to show even more appreciation.&#8221; The young man Gao Cai took the gold and silver, then kowtowed to express his thanks.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you won't take gold or silver,&#8221; Squire Gao said, &#8220;please be good enough to accept these rough clothes as a mark of our gratitude.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If we monks accepted a single thread, we would have to atone for it for a thousand ages,&#8221; replied Sanzang. &#8220;It will suffice if we take the pancakes and fruit that we haven't eaten with us as provisions for the journey.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master, elder brother,&#8221; said Pig, who was standing beside them, &#8220;it's all right for you two to refuse them, but I was a son-in-law in this family for several years, and I deserves three bushels of grain to take with me. On yes, father-in-law, my tunic was torn by elder brother yesterday and my shoes have split, so please give me a black brocade cassock and a good pair of new shoes.&#8221; Old Squire Gao, who could scarcely refuse this request, gave him the new shoes and a tunic in exchange for his old ones.</P>
<P>Pig swaggered over to Old Gao, chanted a &#8220;na-a-aw&#8221; of respect, and said, &#8220;Please inform my mother-in-law, my sisters-in-law, my brothers-in-law, and my uncles that I have become a monk today, and ask them to excuse me for not saying good-bye to them in person. Father-in-law, look after my wife well. If we don't get the scriptures, I'll go back to lay life and work for you as a son-in-law again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Moron,&#8221; shouted Monkey, &#8220;stop talking nonsense.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm doing nothing of the sort,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;I am thinking that if things go wrong I'd be wasting my time as a monk, and my wife's marriage would have been ruined, both for nothing.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Enough of your idle chatter,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;let's be on our way at once.&#8221; Their luggage was hung from a carrying-pole on pig's shoulders. When the white horse was saddled, Sanzang mounted it, and Monkey led the way with his iron cudgel over his shoulder. Thus the three of them left Squire Gao, his relations, and his friends, and headed West. There is a pome to prove it that goes:</P>


<P>The trees tower above the misty earth</P>
<P>As the Tang disciples of Buddha toil and suffer.</P>
<P>When hungry, they beg their food from a thousand homes;</P>
<P>When cold they wear cloaks with a thousand patches.</P>
<P>Do not allow the Thought-horse to run wild,</P>
<P>And don't let the stubborn Mind-ape howl at will.</P>
<P>With passions stilled and one's nature firm, all destinies are in harmony;</P>
<P>When the full moon of contemplation is reached, you will be pure.</P>


<P>After travelling peacefully Westwards for a month, the three of them left the territory of Stubet and saw a mountain soaring up above their heads. Sanzang stopped whipping his horse on, reined him in, and said, &#8220;Monkey, Monkey, that's a high mountain in front of us, so please go and reconnoiter it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No need,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;It's called Pagoda Mountain, and there's a Rook's Nest Hermit who cultivates his conduct on it. I've met him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What does he do?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;He has some powers,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;He once invited me to cultivate my conduct with him, but I didn't go.&#8221; As master and disciples talked they were soon on the mountain. It was a splendid mountain at that:</P>


<P>South of it were blue pines and verdant locust trees,</P>
<P>To the North were green willows and red peach-blossom.</P>
<P>Cawing noisily,</P>
<P>The wild birds talked to each other;</P>
<P>Soaring gracefully,</P>
<P>The cranes flew together.</P>
<P>Rich in fragrance</P>
<P>Were the thousands of different flowers;</P>
<P>Softly dark</P>
<P>Were the endless kinds of herbs.</P>
<P>In the gullies were bubbling green streams,</P>
<P>The crags were wreathed in auspicious cloud.</P>
<P>It was indeed a scene of rare and elegant beauty.</P>
<P>Lonely, where no man came or went.</P>


<P>As the master surveyed the scene from his horse he noticed a grass hut in front of a fragrant locust tree. To the left of it were David's-deer with flowers in their mouths, and to the right were monkeys holding offerings of fruit, while phoenixes of many colours wheeled around the top of the tree, in which cranes and golden pheasants had gathered. Pig pointed and said, &#8220;That's the Rook's Nest Hermit.&#8221; Sanzang gave his horse the rein, whipped it on, and went straight to the foot of the tree.</P>
<P>When the hermit saw the three of them coming he jumped down from his bird's nest. Sanzang dismounted and bowed to him, and only then the hermit reply, helping him up, &#8220;Please arise, holy priest. I'm sorry I did not welcome you properly.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Greetings, venerable hermit,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;Aren't you the Iron-haired Pig from the Mount of Blessing? How have you had the great good fortune of travelling with a holy monk?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Last year,&#8221; replied Pig, &#8220;I was converted by the Bodhisattva Guanyin, and I swore that I'd go with him as his disciple.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wonderful, wonderful,&#8221; exclaimed the delighted hermit, who then pointed at Monkey and asked, &#8220;Who is this gentleman?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Old hermit,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;how is it that you know him but didn't recognize me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please excuse my ignorance,&#8221; the hermit replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;He is Sun Wukong, the senior of my disciples,&#8221; explained Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;I apologize for my discourtesy,&#8221; said the hermit.</P>
<P>Sanzang bowed again and asked him the way to the Great Thunder Monastery in the Western Heaven. &#8220;Far away,&#8221; the other replied, &#8220;far away. The journey is a long one and there are many tigers and leopards along the way. It will be difficult.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How far is it?&#8221; asked Sanzang with great interest. &#8220;Although the journey is a long one,&#8221; the hermit replied, &#8220;you are bound to get there in the end. But there will be evil influences that you'll find hard to dispel. I have a<I> Heart Sutra,</I> a total of 270 words in 54 sentences, and if you recite it when you encounter evil influences you will come to no harm.&#8221; Sanzang prostrated himself on the ground and begged the hermit to tell him it, and the hermit recited it to him. It went:</P>


<P>When the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara was meditating on the profound prajna-paramita, he perceived that all the five aggregates are void and empty, and he was thereupon freed from all sufferings and calamities. Sariputra, matter is not different from voidness and voidness is not different from matter: matter is voidness and voidness is matter. Such is also the case with sensation, perception, discrimination and consciousness. Sariputra, all these things are void in nature, having neither beginning nor end, being neither pure nor impure, and having neither increase nor decrease. Therefore, in voidness there is not matter, no sensation, no perception, no discrimination and no consciousness; there is no eye, no ear, no nose, no tongue, no body and no mind; there is no sight, no sound, no smell, no taste, no touch and no mental process; there is no category of eye nor is there a category of consciousness; no ignorance nor the cessation of ignorance; no old age and death, nor the cessation of old age and death; there is no suffering, no causes of suffering, no cessation of suffering, and no way leading go the cessation of suffering; and there is no wisdom, nor anything to be gained. As nothing is to be gained, a Bodhisattva depending on prajna-paramita becomes free in his mind, and as he is free in his mind he has no fear and is rid of dreamlike thoughts of unreality and enjoys ultimate Nirvana. By mean of prajna-paramita, all Buddhas of the past, the present and the future realize anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Therefore, we know prajna-paramita is a great, divine spell, a great enlightening spell, a supreme spell, and a spell without a parallel, that can do away with all sufferings without fail. Thus we recite the Prajna-paramita Spell and say: Gate, gate, paragate, parasamgate, bodhi, svaha!</P>


<P>As the Patriarch from the Tang had already the origins of enlightenment inside himself, he was able to remember the<I> Heart Sutra</I> after only one hearing, and it has been passed on down to this very day. This sutra is the kernel of the cultivation of the truth, and it is the gateway to becoming a Buddha. When the hermit had recited it, he started to rise up to his crow's nest by cloud, but Sanzang tugged at him and said that he wanted to know about the way to the Western Heaven. To this the hermit replied with a smile:</P>


<P>&#8220;The journey will not be difficult,</P>
<P>If you try to follow my instructions.</P>
<P>There will be a thousand mountains, a thousand deep rivers.</P>
<P>Many evil miasmas, and many a devil.</P>
<P>If you reach the edge of the sky</P>
<P>Do not worry or be afraid.</P>
<P>If you come to Precipitous Cliff</P>
<P>Walk with your feet placed sideways.</P>
<P>Be careful in the Black Pine Forest,</P>
<P>Where many an evil fox may block your path.</P>
<P>The capital cities will be full of spirits,</P>
<P>And demon kings will live in the mountains.</P>
<P>Tigers will sit in the music rooms,</P>
<P>Wolves will be in charge of the accounts.</P>
<P>Lions and elephants will all be kings,</P>
<P>With tigers and leopards for ministers.</P>
<P>A wild boar will carry your luggage,</P>
<P>A water monster will lead the way.</P>
<P>A very old stone monkey</P>
<P>Has no cause to be angry.</P>
<P>Ask those friends of yours&#8212;</P>
<P>They know the way to the West.&#8221;</P>


<P>Monkey smiled bitterly and said, &#8220;Let's go. No need to ask him; you can ask me.&#8221; Sanzang did not understand what he meant. The hermit changed himself into a beam of golden light and went up to his nest, while the venerable Sanzang bowed to him in gratitude. Monkey, now furiously angry, raised his iron cudgel and was just going up to wreck the place when ten thousand lotus flowers appeared, protected by a thousand miraculous mists. Brother Monkey, you are strong enough to stir up the ocean or turn a river upside-down; but don't even dream of touching a twig of that nest! When Sanzang saw what he was going to do, he grabbed hold of him and said, &#8220;Wukong, what do you mean by trying to wreck this Bodhisattva's nest?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He insulted us two disciples,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;He did not insult you,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;He was talking about the way to the Western Heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You wouldn't be able to understand,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;When he said, 'A wild boar will carry your luggage,' he was insulting Pig; and 'A very old stone monkey' was an insult to me. You didn't get his meaning, of course.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be angry,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;That hermit knows about the past and the future as well. We don't yet know whether his talk about a water monster leading the way will come true or not. Let him off.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey saw the lotus blossoms and the miraculous mists draw in round the nest, and could but ask his master to mount the horse and go down the mountain to the West. On this journey,</P>


<P>Although they knew blessings rare on earth,</P>
<P>There was many a demon and disaster in the hill.</P>


<P>If you don't know what lay in store for them, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>云栈洞悟空收八戒</p>
<p>浮屠山玄奘受心经</p>
</div>
<p>却说那怪的火光前走，这大圣的彩霞随跟。正行处，忽见一座高山，那怪把红光结聚，现了本相，撞入洞里，取出一柄九齿钉钯来战。行者喝一声道：“泼怪！你是那里来的邪魔？怎么知道我老孙的名号？你有甚么本事，实实供来，饶你性命！”</p>

<p>那怪道：“是你也不知我的手段！上前来站稳着，我说与你听：</p>

<p>我自小生来心性拙，贪闲爱懒无休歇。不曾养性与修真，混沌迷心熬日月。忽然闲里遇真仙，就把寒温坐下说。劝我回心莫堕凡，伤生造下无边孽。有朝大限命终时，八难三途悔不喋。听言意转要修行，闻语心回求妙诀。有缘立地拜为师，指示天关并地阙。得传九转大还丹，工夫昼夜无时辍。上至顶门泥丸宫，下至脚板涌泉穴。周流肾水入华池，丹田补得温温热。婴儿姹女配阴阳，铅汞相投分日月。离龙坎虎用调和，灵龟吸尽金乌血。三花聚顶得归根，五气朝元通透彻。功圆行满却飞升，天仙对对来迎接。朗然足下彩云生，身轻体健朝金阙。玉皇设宴会群仙，各分品级排班列。敕封元帅管天河，总督水兵称宪节。</p>

<p>只因王母会蟠桃，开宴瑶池邀众客。那时酒醉意昏沉，东倒西歪乱撒泼。逞雄撞入广寒宫，风流仙子来相接。见他容貌挟人魂，旧日凡心难得灭。全无上下失尊卑，扯住嫦娥要陪歇。再三再四不依从，东躲西藏心不悦。色胆如天叫似雷，险些震倒天关阙。纠察灵官奏玉皇，那日吾当命运拙。广寒围困不通风，进退无门难得脱。却被诸神拿住我，酒在心头还不怯。押赴灵霄见玉皇，依律问成该处决。多亏太白李金星，出班俯囟亲言说。改刑重责二千锤，肉绽皮开骨将折。放生遭贬出天关，福陵山下图家业。我因有罪错投胎，俗名唤做猪刚鬣。”行者闻言道：“你这厮原来是天蓬水神下界，怪道知我老孙名号。”那怪道声：哏！你这诳上的弼马温，当年撞那祸时，不知带累我等多少，今日又来此欺人！不要无礼，吃我一钯！”行者怎肯容情，举起棒，当头就打。他两个在那半山之中黑夜里赌斗。好杀：行者金睛似闪电，妖魔环眼似银花。这一个口喷彩雾，那一个气吐红霞。气吐红霞昏处亮，口喷彩雾夜光华。金箍棒，九齿钯，两个英雄实可夸：一个是大圣临凡世，一个是元帅降天涯。那个因失威仪成怪物，这个幸逃苦难拜僧家。钯去好似龙伸爪，棒迎浑若凤穿花。那个道你破人亲事如杀父！这个道你强奸幼女正该拿！闲言语，乱喧哗，往往来来棒架钯。看看战到天将晓，那妖精两膊觉酸麻。他两个自二更时分，直斗到东方发白。那怪不能迎敌，败阵而逃，依然又化狂风，径回洞里，把门紧闭，再不出头。行者在这洞门外看有一座石碣，上书“云栈洞”三字，见那怪不出，天又大明，心却思量：“恐师父等候，且回去见他一见，再来捉此怪不迟。”随踏云点一点，早到高老庄。</p>

<p>却说三藏与那诸老谈今论古，一夜无眠。正想行者不来，只见天井里，忽然站下行者。行者收藏铁棒，整衣上厅，叫道：</p>

<p>“师父，我来了。”慌得那诸老一齐下拜。谢道：“多劳！多劳！”</p>

<p>三藏问道：“悟空，你去这一夜，拿得妖精在那里？”行者道：“师父，那妖不是凡间的邪祟，也不是山间的怪兽。他本是天蓬元帅临凡，只因错投了胎，嘴脸象一个野猪模样，其实性灵尚存。</p>

<p>他说以相为姓，唤名猪刚鬣。是老孙从后宅里掣棒就打，他化一阵狂风走了。被老孙着风一棒，他就化道火光，径转他那本山洞里，取出一柄九齿钉钯，与老孙战了一夜。适才天色将明，他怯战而走，把洞门紧闭不出。老孙还要打开那门，与他见个好歹，恐师父在此疑虑盼望，故先来回个信息。”说罢，那老高上前跪下道：“长老，没及奈何，你虽赶得去了，他等你去后复来，却怎区处？索性累你与我拿住，除了根，才无后患。我老夫不敢怠慢，自有重谢：将这家财田地，凭众亲友写立文书，与长老平分。只是要剪草除根，莫教坏了我高门清德。”行者笑道：</p>

<p>“你这老儿不知分限。那怪也曾对我说，他虽是食肠大，吃了你家些茶饭，他与你干了许多好事。这几年挣了许多家资，皆是他之力量。他不曾白吃了你东西，问你祛他怎的。据他说，他是一个天神下界，替你巴家做活，又未曾害了你家女儿。想这等一个女婿，也门当户对，不怎么坏了家声，辱了行止，当真的留他也罢。”老高道：“长老，虽是不伤风化，但名声不甚好听。</p>

<p>动不动着人就说，高家招了一个妖怪女婿！这句话儿教人怎当？”三藏道：“悟空，你既是与他做了一场，一发与他做个竭绝，才见始终。”行者道：“我才试他一试耍子，此去一定拿来与你们看，且莫忧愁。”叫：“老高，你还好生管待我师父，我去也。”</p>

<p>说声去，就无形无影的，跳到他那山上，来到洞口，一顿铁棍，把两扇门打得粉碎，口里骂道：“那馕糠的夯货，快出来与老孙打么！”那怪王喘嘘嘘的睡在洞里，听见打得门响，又听见骂馕糠的夯货，他却恼怒难禁，只得拖着钯，抖擞精神，跑将出来，厉声骂道：“你这个弼马温，着实惫懒！与你有甚相干，你把我大门打破？你且去看看律条，打进大门而入，该个杂犯死罪哩！”行者笑道：“这个呆子！我就打了大门，还有个辨处。象你强占人家女子，又没个三媒六证，又无些茶红酒礼，该问个真犯斩罪哩！”那怪道：“且休闲讲，看老猪这钯！”行者使棒支住道：“你这钯可是与高老家做园工筑地种菜的？有何好处怕你！”那怪道：“你错认了！这钯岂是凡间之物？你且听我道来：</p>

<p>此是锻炼神冰铁，磨琢成工光皎洁。老君自己动钤锤，荧惑亲身添炭屑。五方五帝用心机，六丁六甲费周折。造成九齿玉垂牙，铸就双环金坠叶。身妆六曜排五星，体按四时依八节。短长上下定乾坤，左右阴阳分日月。六爻神将按天条，八卦星辰依斗列。名为上宝沁金钯，进与玉皇镇丹阙。因我修成大罗仙，为吾养就长生客。勅封元帅号天蓬，钦赐钉钯为御节。举起烈焰并毫光，落下猛风飘瑞雪。天曹神将尽皆惊，地府阎罗心胆怯。人间那有这般兵，世上更无此等铁。随身变化可心怀，任意翻腾依口诀。相携数载未曾离，伴我几年无日别。日食三餐并不丢，夜眠一宿浑无撇。也曾佩去赴蟠桃，也曾带他朝帝阙。</p>

<p>皆因仗酒却行凶，只为倚强便撒泼。上天贬我降凡尘，下世尽我作罪孽。石洞心邪曾吃人，高庄情喜婚姻结。这钯下海掀翻龙鼍窝，上山抓碎虎狼穴。诸般兵刃且休题，惟有吾当钯最切。</p>

<p>相持取胜有何难，赌斗求功不用说。何怕你铜头铁脑一身钢，钯到魂消神气泄！”行者闻言，收了铁棒道：“呆子不要说嘴！老孙把这头伸在那里，你且筑一下儿，看可能魂消气泄？”那怪真个举起钯，着气力筑将来，扑的一下，钻起钯的火光焰焰，更不曾筑动一些儿头皮。唬得他手麻脚软，道声“好头！好头！”行者道：“你是也不知。老孙因为闹天宫，偷了仙丹，盗了蟠桃，窃了御酒，被小圣二郎擒住，押在斗牛宫前，众天神把老孙斧剁锤敲，刀砍剑刺，火烧雷打，也不曾损动分毫。又被那太上老君拿了我去，放在八卦炉中，将神火锻炼，炼做个火眼金睛，铜头铁臂。不信，你再筑几下，看看疼与不疼？”那怪道：“你这猴子，我记得你闹天宫时，家住在东胜神洲傲来国花果山水帘洞里，到如今久不闻名，你怎么来到这里上门子欺我？莫敢是我丈人去那里请你来的？”行者道：“你丈人不曾去请我。因是老孙改邪归正，弃道从僧，保护一个东土大唐驾下御弟，叫做三藏法师，往西天拜佛求经，路过高庄借宿，那高老儿因话说起，就请我救他女儿，拿你这馕糠的夯货！”那怪一闻此言，丢了钉钯，唱个大喏道：“那取经人在那里？累烦你引见引见。”行者道：</p>

<p>“你要见他怎的？”那怪道：“我本是观世音菩萨劝善，受了他的戒行，这里持斋把素，教我跟随那取经人往西天拜佛求经，将功折罪，还得正果。教我等他，这几年不闻消息。今日既是你与他做了徒弟，何不早说取经之事，只倚凶强，上门打我？”行者道：“你莫诡诈欺心软我，欲为脱身之计。果然是要保护唐僧，略无虚假，你可朝天发誓，我才带你去见我师父。”那怪扑的跪下，望空似捣碓的一般，只管磕头道：“阿弥陀佛，南无佛，我若不是真心实意，还教我犯了天条，劈尸万段！”行者见他赌咒发愿，道：“既然如此，你点把火来烧了你这住处，我方带你去。”那怪真个搬些芦苇荆棘，点着一把火，将那云栈洞烧得象个破瓦窑，对行者道：我今已无挂碍了，你却引我去罢。”行者道：“你把钉钯与我拿着。”那怪就把钯递与行者。行者又拔了一根毫毛，吹口仙气，叫“变！”即变做一条三股麻绳，走过来，把手背绑剪了。那怪真个倒背着手，凭他怎么绑缚。却又揪着耳朵，拉着他，叫：“快走！快走！”那怪道：“轻着些儿！你的手重，揪得我耳根子疼。”行者道：“轻不成，顾你不得！常言道，善猪恶拿。只等见了我师父，果有真心，方才放你。”他两个半云半雾的，径转高家庄来。有诗为证：金性刚强能克木，心猿降得木龙归。金从木顺皆为一，木恋金仁总发挥。一主一宾无间隔，三交三合有玄微。性情并喜贞元聚，同证西方话不违。</p>

<p>顷刻间，到了庄前。行者拑着他的钯，揪着他的耳道：“你看那厅堂上端坐的是谁？乃吾师也。”那高氏诸亲友与老高，忽见行者把那怪背绑揪耳而来，一个个欣然迎到天井中，道声“长老！长老！他正是我家的女婿！”那怪走上前，双膝跪下，背着手对三藏叩头，高叫道：“师父，弟子失迎，早知是师父住在我丈人家，我就来拜接，怎么又受到许多波折？”三藏道：“悟空，你怎么降得他来拜我？”行者才放了手，拿钉钯柄儿打着，喝道：“呆子！你说么！”那怪把菩萨劝善事情，细陈了一遍。三藏大喜，便叫：“高太公，取个香案用用。”老高即忙抬出香案。</p>

<p>三藏净了手焚香，望南礼拜道：“多蒙菩萨圣恩！”那几个老儿也一齐添香礼拜。拜罢，三藏上厅高坐，教：“悟空放了他绳。”</p>

<p>行者才把身抖了一抖，收上身来，其缚自解。那怪从新礼拜三藏，愿随西去。又与行者拜了，以先进者为兄，遂称行者为师兄。三藏道：“既从吾善果，要做徒弟，我与你起个法名，早晚好呼唤。”他道：“师父，我是菩萨已与我摩顶受戒，起了法名，叫做猪悟能也。”三藏笑道：“好！好！你师兄叫做悟空，你叫做悟能，其实是我法门中的宗派。”悟能道：“师父，我受了菩萨戒行，断了五荤三厌，在我丈人家持斋把素，更不曾动荤。今日见了师父，我开了斋罢。”三藏道：“不可！不可！你既是不吃五荤三厌，我再与你起个别名，唤为八戒。”那呆子欢欢喜喜道：“谨遵师命。”因此又叫做猪八戒。</p>

<p>高老见这等去邪归正，更十分喜悦，遂命家僮安排筵宴，酬谢唐僧。八戒上前扯住老高道：“爷，请我拙荆出来拜见公公伯伯，如何？”行者笑道：“贤弟，你既入了沙门，做了和尚，从今后，再莫题起那拙荆的话说。世间只有个火居道士，那里有个火居的和尚？我们且来叙了坐次，吃顿斋饭，赶早儿往西天走路。”高老儿摆了桌席，请三藏上坐，行者与八戒，坐于左右两旁，诸亲下坐。高老把素酒开樽，满斟一杯，奠了天地，然后奉与三藏。三藏道：“不瞒太公说，贫僧是胎里素，自幼儿不吃荤。”老高道：“因知老师清素，不曾敢动荤。此酒也是素的，请一杯不妨。”三藏道：“也不敢用酒，酒是我僧家第一戒者。”悟能慌了道：“师父，我自持斋，却不曾断酒。”悟空道：“老孙虽量窄，吃不上坛把，却也不曾断酒。”三藏道：“既如此，你兄弟们吃些素酒也罢，只是不许醉饮误事。”遂而他两个接了头锺。各人俱照旧坐下，摆下素斋，说不尽那杯盘之盛，品物之丰。</p>

<p>师徒们宴罢，老高将一红漆丹盘，拿出二百两散碎金银，奉三位长老为途中之费；又将三领绵布褊衫，为上盖之衣。三藏道：“我们是行脚僧，遇庄化饭，逢处求斋，怎敢受金银财帛？”行者近前，轮开手，抓了一把，叫：“高才，昨日累你引我师父，今日招了一个徒弟，无物谢你，把这些碎金碎银，权作带领钱，拿了去买草鞋穿。以后但有妖精，多作成我几个，还有谢你处哩。”高才接了，叩头谢赏。老高又道：“师父们既不受金银，望将这粗衣笑纳，聊表寸心。”三藏又道：“我出家人，若受了一丝之贿，千劫难修。只是把席上吃不了的饼果，带些去做干粮足矣。”八戒在旁边道：“师父、师兄，你们不要便罢，我与他家做了这几年女婿，就是挂脚粮也该三石哩。丈人啊，我的直裰，昨晚被师兄扯破了，与我一件青锦袈裟，鞋子绽了，与我一双好新鞋子。”高老闻言，不敢不与，随买一双新鞋，将一领褊衫，换下旧时衣物。那八戒摇摇摆摆，对高老唱个喏道：“上复丈母、大姨、二姨并姨夫、姑舅诸亲：我今日去做和尚了，不及面辞，休怪。丈人啊，你还好生看待我浑家，只怕我们取不成经时，好来还俗，照旧与你做女婿过活。”行者喝道：“夯货，却莫胡说！”八戒道：“哥呵，不是胡说，只恐一时间有些儿差池，却不是和尚误了做，老婆误了娶，两下里都耽搁了？”三藏道：“少题闲话，我们赶早儿去来。”遂此收拾了一担行李，八戒担着；</p>

<p>背了白马，三藏骑着；行者肩担铁棒，前面引路。一行三众，辞别高老及众亲友，投西而去。有诗为证，诗曰：满地烟霞树色高，唐朝佛子苦劳劳。饥餐一钵千家饭，寒着千针一衲袍。意马胸头休放荡，心猿乖劣莫教嚎。情和性定诸缘合，月满金华是伐毛。</p>

<p>三众进西路途，有个月平稳。行过了乌斯藏界，猛抬头见一座高山。三藏停鞭勒马道：“悟空、悟能、前面山高，须索仔细，仔细。”八戒道：“没事。这山唤做浮屠山，山中有一个乌巢禅师，在此修行，老猪也曾会他。”三藏道：“他有些甚么勾当？”</p>

<p>八戒道：“他倒也有些道行。他曾劝我跟他修行，我不曾去罢了。”师徒们说着话，不多时，到了山上。好山！但见那：山南有青松碧桧，山北有绿柳红桃。闹聒聒，山禽对语；舞翩翩，仙鹤齐飞。香馥馥，诸花千样色；青冉冉，杂草万般奇。涧下有滔滔绿水，崖前有朵朵祥云。真个是景致非常幽雅处，寂然不见往来人。那师父在马上遥观，见香桧树前，有一柴草窝。左边有麋鹿衔花，右边有山猴献果。树梢头，有青鸾彩凤齐鸣，玄鹤锦鸡咸集。八戒指道：“那不是乌巢禅师！”三藏纵马加鞭，直至树下。</p>

<p>却说那禅师见他三众前来，即便离了巢穴，跳下树来。三藏下马奉拜，那禅师用手搀道：“圣僧请起，失迎，失迎。”八戒道：“老禅师，作揖了。”禅师惊问道：“你是福陵山猪刚鬣，怎么有此大缘，得与圣僧同行？”八戒道：“前年蒙观音菩萨劝善，愿随他做个徒弟。”禅师大喜道：“好，好，好！”又指定行者，问道：</p>

<p>“此位是谁？”行者笑道：“这老禅怎么认得他，倒不认得我？”禅师道：“因少识耳。”三藏道：“他是我的大徒弟孙悟空。”禅师陪笑道：“欠礼，欠礼。”三藏再拜，请问西天大雷音寺还在那里。</p>

<p>禅师道：“远哩！远哩！只是路多虎豹难行。”三藏殷勤致意，再回：“路途果有多远？”禅师道：“路途虽远，终须有到之日，却只是魔瘴难消。我有《多心经》一卷，凡五十四句，共计二百七十字。若遇魔瘴之处，但念此经，自无伤害。”三藏拜伏于地恳求，那禅师遂口诵传之。经云《摩诃般若波罗蜜多心经》：观自在菩萨，行深般若波罗蜜多，时照见五蕴皆空，度一切苦厄。舍利子，色不异空，空不异色；色即是空，空即是色。受想行识，亦复如是。舍利子，是诸法空相，不生不灭，不垢不净，不增不减。是故空中无色，无受想行识，无眼耳鼻舌身意，无色声香味触法，无眼界，乃至无意识界，无无明，亦无无明尽，乃至无老死，亦无老死尽。无苦寂灭道，无智亦无得。以无所得故，菩提萨。</p>

<p>依般若波罗蜜多故，心无挂碍，无挂碍故，无有恐怖。远离颠倒梦想，究竟涅槃，三世诸佛，依般若波罗蜜多故，得阿耨多罗三藐三菩提。故知般若波罗蜜多，是大神咒，是大明咒，是无上咒，是无等等咒，能除一切苦，真实不虚。故说般若波罗蜜多咒，即说咒曰：‘揭谛！揭谛！波罗揭谛！波罗僧揭谛！菩提萨婆诃！’”此时唐朝法师本有根源，耳闻一遍《多心经》，即能记忆，至今传世。此乃修真之总经，作佛之会门也。”</p>

<p>那禅师传了经文，踏云光，要上乌巢而去，被三藏又扯住奉告，定要问个西去的路程端的。那禅师笑云：“道路不难行，试听我吩咐：千山千水深，多瘴多魔处。若遇接天崖，放心休恐怖。行来摩耳岩，侧着脚踪步。仔细黑松林，妖狐多截路。精灵满国城，魔主盈山住。老虎坐琴堂，苍狼为主簿。狮象尽称王，虎豹皆作御。野猪挑担子，水怪前头遇。多年老石猴，那里怀嗔怒。你问那相识，他知西去路。”行者闻言，冷笑道：“我们去，不必问他，问我便了。”三藏还不解其意，那禅师化作金光，径上乌巢而去。长老往上拜谢，行者心中大怒，举铁棒望上乱捣，只见莲花生万朵，祥雾护千层。行者纵有搅海翻江力，莫想挽着乌巢一缕藤。三藏见了，扯住行者道：“悟空，”这样一个菩萨，你捣他窝巢怎的？”行者道：“他骂了我兄弟两个一场去了。”三藏道：“他讲的西天路径，何尝骂你？”行者道：“你那里晓得？他说野猪挑担子，是骂的八戒；多年老石猴，是骂的老孙。你怎么解得此意？”八戒道：“师兄息怒。这禅师也晓得过去未来之事，但看他水怪前头遇这句话，不知验否，饶他去罢。”行者见莲花祥雾，近那巢边，只得请师父上马，下山往西而去。那一去：管教清福人间少，致使灾魔山里多。毕竟不知前程端的如何，且听下回分解。</p>
