<P>The Seven Emotions Confuse the Basic in Gossamer Cave</P>
<P>At Filth-Cleansing Spring Pig Forgets Himself</P>
</div>
<P>The story tells how Sanzang took his leave of the king of Purpuria, got everything ready, saddled the horse and headed Westwards. They crossed many a mountain and river. Before they realized it autumn and winter were over and spring's brightness and charm were back. Master and disciples were enjoying the scenery as their way led them across the greenery when they suddenly noticed a building amid trees. Sanzang dismounted and stood beside the main track.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; Brother Monkey asked, &#8220;the road is easy and there is no evil about, so why have you stopped?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You aren't at all understanding, brother,&#8221; Pig said. &#8220;The master is feeling sleepy after being in the saddle for so long. You ought to let him come down and have a rest.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's not that,&#8221; Sanzang said. &#8220;I can see a house over there. I was thinking of going there myself to beg for some food.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a thing for the master to say,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile. &#8220;If you want some food I'll go and beg some for you. As the saying goes, 'Your teacher for a day is your father for the rest of your life.' It would be outrageous for me, your disciple, to sit here idly and let my master go begging.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no need to say that,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;Usually you three have to cross enormous distances as far as the eye can see to beg for our food. Today there's a house so close it's in shouting distance, so let me beg this time.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But, Master, you wouldn't know what to do,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;As the saying goes, when three people go travelling it's the youngest who does the rough jobs. You're the senior one and we're all only disciples. As the old book says, 'When there is a job to be done the disciple does it.' Let me go.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciples,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;the weather is good today. It's not at all like the times when you all have to go far away in wind and rain. Let me go to this house. Whether I get any food or not I shall soon be back and we shall be on our way.&#8221;</P>
<P>Friar Sand, who was standing beside them, smiled and said, &#8220;Stop arguing so much, brother. As the master has made his mind up you shouldn't disobey him. If you upset him he won't eat any of the food you are able to beg.&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig accepted this suggestion and brought out the begging bowl and a change of hat and cassock for the master, who went straight to the farm building to look at it. It really was a fine place. He could see:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A high-rising stone bridge,</P>
<P>Ancient trees growing close together.</P>
<P>Where the stone bridge rose high</P>
<P>A babbling brook joined a long stream;</P>
<P>Amid close-growing ancient trees</P>
<P>Hidden birds sang sweetly on the distant hill.</P>
<P>Across the bridge were several thatched houses</P>
<P>As pure and elegant as an immortal's hermitage.</P>
<P>There was also a thatched hut</P>
<P>So pure and white it would put a Taoist temple to shame.</P>
<P>Before the hut could be seen four beauties</P>
<P>All busily embroidering phoenix designs.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As there were no males but only these four girls to be seen the reverend gentleman did not dare go inside, but slipped back under the tall trees and stood stock still. He could see that each of the girls</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Were rock-hard in their ladylike propriety,</P>
<P>And happy as the spring in their orchid natures.</P>
<P>Red glows set off their tender cheeks;</P>
<P>Crimson make-up was spread on their lips.</P>
<P>Their moth brows were as fine as a crescent moon,</P>
<P>While their clouds of hair were piled up like cicada wings.</P>
<P>Had any of them stood among the flowers</P>
<P>Wandering bees would have taken them for blossoms.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He stood there for an hour. The silence was complete, unbroken by dog or cock. &#8220;If I'm not even capable of begging us a meal my disciples will laugh at me,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;If the master can't beg a meal, what hope do his disciples have of ever getting to see the Buddha?&#8221;</P>
<P>He did not know what to do, but it seemed wrong to stay there any longer, so he went back towards the bridge, only to notice a pavilion inside the compound of thatched cottages. In the pavilion three more girls were juggling a ball with their feet. Look at them. They were different from the other four:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Their turquoise sleeves are waving</P>
<P>And their embroidered skirts are swaying.</P>
<P>The waving turquoise sleeves</P>
<P>Cover their delicate jade bamboo-shoots of fingers,</P>
<P>The swaying embroidered skirts</P>
<P>Half show their tiny golden lotus feet.</P>
<P>Perfect are their faces and bodies,</P>
<P>Endless the movements of their slippered heels.</P>
<P>As they grab for the head they vary in height;</P>
<P>They pass the ball around most smoothly.</P>
<P>One turns around and kicks an &#8220;over-the-wall flower,&#8221;</P>
<P>Then does a backward somersault called &#8220;crossing the sea.&#8221;</P>
<P>After lightly taking a pass like a lump of clay</P>
<P>A single spear is hard pressed by a pair of sticks.</P>
<P>A shining pearl is put on the Buddha's head</P>
<P>And held between the tips of their fingers.</P>
<P>Skillfully they hold the ball as a narrow brick,</P>
<P>Twisting their feet in the sleeping fish position.</P>
<P>Their backs held level, they squat with bended knee;</P>
<P>Turning their necks they kick their heels in the air.</P>
<P>They can make benches fly around;</P>
<P>Very stylish are the capes upon their shoulders.</P>
<P>Their trouser-legs are bound with tapes to let them move,</P>
<P>While their necklaces swing as they sway.</P>
<P>They kick the ball like the Yellow River flowing backwards.</P>
<P>Or goldfish purchased on the beach.</P>
<P>When you mistake one of them for the leader</P>
<P>Another one turns to carry the ball away.</P>
<P>They all hold their calves so trimly in the air,</P>
<P>Pointing their toes to catch the ball.</P>
<P>They raise their heels to spin straw sandals,</P>
<P>Planting them upside-down and picking them up in a turn.</P>
<P>As they step back their shoulder-capes spread out</P>
<P>Fastened only with a hook.</P>
<P>The peddler's basket comes down long and low,</P>
<P>Then they grab for the goal.</P>
<P>At the really magnificent footwork.</P>
<P>All the beauties shout with admiration.</P>
<P>The silken clothes of all are soaked in sweat;</P>
<P>Feeling tired and relaxed they ended their game.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The description could go on and on. There is another poem that tells more:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Kicking the ball in the April weather,</P>
<P>Beauties blown along by the magical wind.</P>
<P>Sweat stained their powdered faces like dew on a flower;</P>
<P>The dust on their moth eyebrows was mist hiding willows.</P>
<P>Their turquoise sleeves hanging low covered jade fingers;</P>
<P>Trailing embroidered skirts showed golden lotus feet.</P>
<P>After kicking the ball many times they were charmingly tired;</P>
<P>Their hair was disheveled and their topknots askew.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After watching for a long time Sanzang could only go to the bridge and call loudly, &#8220;Bodhisattvas, fate brings me here as a poor monk to beg for the gift of some food.&#8221; As soon as the women heard him they cheerfully put aside their needlework and balls to come out smiling and giggling through the gates to greet him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Reverend sir,&#8221; they said, &#8220;we're sorry we didn't welcome you sooner. As you have come to our poor farm we couldn't possibly feed you on the path. Please come inside and sit down.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Sanzang heard this he thought, &#8220;Splendid, this is splendid. The West really is Buddha's land. If even these womenfolk are so diligent about feeding monks the men are bound to be pious followers of the Buddha.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang stepped forward to greet the women and followed them into the thatched cottages. As he passed the pavilion and looked he saw that on the other side of it there were no buildings. All that could be seen were:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Towering mountain-tops,</P>
<P>Distant ranges of the earth.</P>
<P>The towering mountain-tops touch the clouds;</P>
<P>The distant ranges of the earth lead to peaks in the ocean.</P>
<P>From the stone bridge by the gates</P>
<P>One looks on a stream that bends nine times;</P>
<P>The peach and plum trees in the orchard</P>
<P>Vie in abundance of blossom.</P>
<P>Creepers and vines hang from three or four trees;</P>
<P>The fragrance of orchids is spread by thousands of flowers.</P>
<P>From afar this retreat rivals Penglai's fairyland;</P>
<P>Seen from close to the mountain beats Tai and Hua.</P>
<P>This is truly a retreat for demon immortals,</P>
<P>An isolated house with no neighbors around.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>One woman came forward to push the stone gates open and invite the Tang Priest to come in and sit down. All he could do was go inside. When he looked up he saw that the tables and seats were all of stone, and the atmosphere was oppressively cold. This alarmed the venerable elder, who thought, &#8220;This is a thoroughly sinister place. I'm sure it's evil.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please sit down, venerable elder,&#8221; the women all said with simpering smiles. He had no choice but to sit down. A little later he found himself shuddering.</P>
<P>&#8220;What monastery are you from, reverend sir?&#8221; the women asked. &#8220;For what purpose are you collecting alms? Are you repairing roads and bridges, founding monasteries, worshipping at pagodas, or having Buddha statues made and sutras printed? Won't you show us your donation book?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am not a monk collecting donations,&#8221; the venerable elder replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you're not here to ask for charity then why are you here?&#8221; the women asked. &#8220;We have been sent by Great Tang in the East to the Thunder Monastery in the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;As our stomachs were empty when we happened to be passing this distinguished place I have come to beg a vegetarian meal from you in your kindness. After that we poor monks will be on our way again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Splendid, splendid,&#8221; the women all said. &#8220;As the saying goes, monks from afar most love to read the scriptures. Sisters! We must treat them well. Let's give them some vegetarian food as quickly as we can.&#8221;</P>
<P>While three of the women kept him company, talking about such matters as primary and secondary causation, the other four went into the kitchen, where they tucked up their clothes, rolled up their sleeves, fanned the fire and scrubbed the cooking pots. Do you know what it was they prepared? They were frying in human fat, and what they cooked was human flesh, stewed into black paste as if it were wheat gluten, and human brain cut out to fry like pieces of beancurd.</P>
<P>Then they placed the two dishes on a stone table and said to Sanzang, &#8220;Do eat. We were too rushed to prepare anything good, so please make do with this. It'll stave off the pangs of hunger. There will be some more dishes to follow.&#8221;</P>
<P>As soon as Sanzang used his nose and smelled the stench of flesh he would not eat, but bowed with his hands together be; re his chest and said, &#8220;Bodhisattvas, I have been a vegetarian since birth.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But this is vegetarian food, reverend sir,&#8221; the women all replied with smiles.</P>
<P>&#8220;Amitabha Buddha!&#8221; exclaimed Sanzang. &#8220;If as a monk I ate vegetarian food like that I would never have any hope of seeing the Buddha or fetching the surras.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Reverend sir,&#8221; the women said, &#8220;as a monk you shouldn't be so choosy about what you're given.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I never could be,&#8221; Sanzang said, &#8220;I never could be. I am under the orders of the Great Tang emperor to harm not even the tiniest life, to save all I see suffering, to put all the food-grain I am given into my mouth with my fingers, and to cover my body with the threads of silk that come my way. I would never dare pick and choose among my benefactors' gifts.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Even if you're not picking and choosing,&#8221; the women replied with smiles, &#8220;you do seem to have come here to complain. Please eat some of the food and don't mind if it's a little coarse and flavorless.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's not that I don't want to eat it,&#8221; Sanzang said, &#8220;it's that I'm afraid I'd be breaking my vows. I hope that you Bodhisattvas will remember that setting living beings free is better than keeping them with you and let me go on my way.&#8221;</P>
<P>As Sanzang struggled to get out the women blocked the gateway and refused to let him go. &#8220;Business bringing itself to our door!&#8221; they all said. &#8220;You've no more chance of getting away from here than of covering up a fart with your hands. Where do you think you're going?&#8221;</P>
<P>They were all quite skilled in the martial arts and quick movers too, and after they had grabbed Sanzang they dragged him like a sheep and threw him to the ground. Then they all held him down, tied him up, and suspended him from the rafters. There is a special name for the way they hung him up there: The Immortal Shows the Way. One hand was strung up by a rope so that it pointed forward. The other hand was fastened to his waist by another rope that was also holding him aloft, and his legs were both held up by a third rope behind him. The three ropes had him suspended from a beam with his back on top and his belly pointing down.</P>
<P>As Sanzang endured the agony and held back his tears he thought with bitter regret, &#8220;How evil my destiny is. I thought I was coming to beg for a vegetarian meal from good people. I never imagined I'd be falling into the fiery pit. Disciples! Rescue me as soon as you can if I am ever to see you again. If you don't get here within four hours I shall be dead.&#8221;</P>
<P>Despite his misery Sanzang kept a careful eye on the women. When they had him tied up securely and hanging there they started to remove their clothes. This alarmed the venerable elder, who thought, &#8220;They must be taking their clothes off because they are going to beat me. Perhaps they are going to eat me too.&#8221; The women only unbuttoned their gauze blouses, exposing their stomachs. Then each of them produced a silken rope about as thick as a duck egg from her navel. These they made move like bursting jade or flying silver as they fastened the gates of the farm.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We leave them and go back to Monkey, Pig and Friar Sand, who were all still waiting by the main road. While the other two were pasturing the horse and looking after the baggage Monkey was amusing himself by leaping from tree to tree and climbing around the branches as he picked leaves and looked for fruit. Suddenly he turned round and saw a sheet of light.</P>
<P>This so alarmed him that he jumped out of the tree with a shout of, &#8220;This is terrible! Terrible! The master's luck is out.&#8221; He pointed as he continued, &#8220;Look at the farm. What do you think?&#8221; When Pig and Friar Sand both looked they saw a sheet of something like snow but brighter and like silver but shinier.</P>
<P>&#8220;That's done it,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;that's done it. The master's run into evil spirits. We'd better go and rescue him straight away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop yelling, brother,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Neither of you can see just what's there. Wait while I go and take a look.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do be careful, brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand.</P>
<P>&#8220;I can cope,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage tightened his tigerskin kilt, pulled out his gold-banded cudgel and took a few strides forward to see that the silken ropes had formed something like a web with thousands of strands. When he felt it with his hands it was somewhat soft and sticky. Not knowing what it was, Monkey raised his cudgel and said, &#8220;Never mind thousands of strands. This cudgel could break through tens of thousands of them.&#8221;</P>
<P>He was just about to strike when he stopped to think, &#8220;If they were hard I could certainly smash them, but then soft ones would only be knocked flat, and if I alarm the demons and get caught myself that would be a disaster. I'd better make some enquiries before I do any hitting.&#8221;</P>
<P>Who do you think he asked? He made a spell with his hands, said the words of it and sent for an old local god, who ran round and round in his shrine just as if turning a mill. &#8220;Old man,&#8221; his wife asked, &#8220;what are you rushing round and round for? You must be having a fit.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't understand,&#8221; the local god replied. &#8220;There's a Great Sage Equaling Heaven here. I didn't go to meet him. But he's sending for me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Go and see him then,&#8221; his wife replied, &#8220;and that'll be that. Why charge round and round in here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But if I go and see him that cudgel of his hits very hard,&#8221; the local deity said. &#8220;He doesn't care what you're like&#8212;he just hits you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He won't possibly hit you when he sees how old you are,&#8221; his wife replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;He's been cadging free drinks all his life,&#8221; the local god said, &#8220;and he really loves hitting old people.&#8221;</P>
<P>After talking for a while with his wife the local god had no choice but to go outside and kneel shivering and shaking by the roadside, calling out, &#8220;Great Sage, the local deity kowtows to you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Get up,&#8221; Brother Monkey replied, &#8220;and stop pretending to be so keen. I'm not going to hit you. I'm just passing through. Tell me where this is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Which way have you come, Great Sage?&#8221; the local deity asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I've come from the East and I'm heading West,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Which mountain have you reached on your journey from the East?&#8221; the local deity asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;That ridge there,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Our baggage and the horse are there, aren't they?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That is Gossamer Ridge,&#8221; the local deity replied. &#8220;Under the ridge there's a cave called Gossamer Cave where seven evil spirits live.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Male or female ones?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;She-devils,&#8221; the local deity replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;How powerful is their magic?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm much too weak and insignificant to know that,&#8221; the local god replied. &#8220;All I can tell you is that a mile due South of here there is a natural hot spring called the Filth-cleansing Spring,&#8221; the local god said, &#8220;where the Seven Fairies from on high used to bathe. When the seven evil spirits settled here and took over the Filth-cleansing Spring the good spirits didn't try to fight them for it. They let the spirits have it for nothing. I reckon that if even good spirits from Heaven don't dare offend them the evil spirits must have tremendous powers.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What have they taken the spring over for?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Ever since taking the bathing pool over the monsters have been coming to bathe there three times a day,&#8221; the local god replied. &#8220;It's already after eleven. They'll be along at noon.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Go back now, local god,&#8221; Monkey said when he heard all this, &#8220;and wait while I capture them.&#8221; The old local god kowtowed to him and went back to his shrine all of a tremble.</P>
<P>The Great Sage then gave a solo display of his magical powers, shaking himself, turning into a fly, and landing on the tip of a blade of grass to wait beside the path. A little later he heard a rustling, hissing sound like that of silkworms eating leaves or an ocean tide coming in. In the time it takes to drink half a cup of tea the silken ropes had all gone, and the farm looked just the same as it had before. Then there was a creaking noise as the wicker gate opened and the seven women came out laughing and talking noisily. Monkey watched carefully from where he was hiding and saw them talking and laughing as they held each other by the hand and walked shoulder to shoulder across the bridge. They were real beauties:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Compare them with jade and they were more fragrant;</P>
<P>They were like flowers but able to talk.</P>
<P>Their willowy brows were like distant hills;</P>
<P>Sandalwood-scented mouths were bursting cherries.</P>
<P>Hair ornaments were of jade;</P>
<P>Golden lotus feet darted out under crimson skirts.</P>
<P>They were like the moon goddess come down to earth,</P>
<P>Immortal girls descending to the world.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;No wonder the master wanted to come begging for food,&#8221; thought Monkey with a laugh, &#8220;with all these lovelies here. If these seven beauties have captured him he won't be enough for a single meal for them. They couldn't make him last a couple of days. And if they take it in turns to have their way with him they'll kill him straight off. I'd better go and listen to what they're plotting.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage flew over with a high-pitched buzz and landed on the topknot of the woman who was walking in front. When she was over the bridge the women behind her caught up with her and called out, &#8220;Sister, let's have a bath before we steam the fat monk and eat him up.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;These monsters aren't at all economical,&#8221; Monkey smiled to himself. &#8220;They'd save a lot of firewood if they boiled him. Why steam him instead?&#8221; The women walked South, picking flowers and throwing grass at each other, and were soon at the bathing pool, where a very magnificent wall and gateway appeared, with fragrant flowers, among them a bed of orchids, growing all around. One of the women behind him stepped forward and with a whistling sound pushed the double gates open, revealing the pond of naturally hot water inside. As for this water,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When heaven and earth were first separated</P>
<P>There were ten suns in the sky</P>
<P>Till Yi, the fine archer,</P>
<P>Shot nine of the sun-crows down to the earth,</P>
<P>Leaving only one golden crow star,</P>
<P>The true fire of the sun.</P>
<P>The nine hot springs in heaven and earth</P>
<P>Are the other nine crows transformed.</P>
<P>These nine hot springs are</P>
<P>Cool Fragrance Spring,</P>
<P>Mountain-companions Spring</P>
<P>Warm Spring,</P>
<P>Donghe Spring,</P>
<P>Mount Huang Spring,</P>
<P>Xiao'an Spring,</P>
<P>Guangfen Spring,</P>
<P>Hot Water Spring,</P>
<P>And this Filth-cleansing Spring.</P>
<P>There is a poem about it that goes:</P>
<P>The same vital force runs in all four seasons;</P>
<P>Spring continues throughout the autumn.</P>
<P>The scalding water bubbles like a cauldron;</P>
<P>The snow-white waves are boiling hot.</P>
<P>If the waters are spread they help the crops to grow;</P>
<P>Left where they are they wash worldly dust away.</P>
<P>Little bubbles spread out like pearls,</P>
<P>Rolling ones rise like pieces of jade.</P>
<P>It is rich and smooth although not wine,</P>
<P>Clear, calm and naturally warm.</P>
<P>The whole place thrives on its air of good omen:</P>
<P>It brings good fortune and the natural truth.</P>
<P>When the beauties wash their flesh is smooth as ice;</P>
<P>As dirt is soaked away their jade-like bodies are made new.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The bathing pool was about fifty feet across, a hundred feet long and four feet deep. The water was pure and translucent, and from the bottom of it came up bubbles like rolling pearls or floating jade. In the four sides of the pool there were six or seven pipes through which the water flowed out, keeping warm even when it reached fields up to a mile away. Beside the pool was a three-roomed pavilion, next to the back wall of which stood an eight-legged bench. At each end of the pavilion was a clothes stand painted in coloured lacquers. All this secretly delighted Monkey, who flew straight to one of the stands and landed on it.</P>
<P>When the women saw how clear and warm the water was they wanted to bathe in it, so they all took their clothes off and hung them on the stands before going into the pool together. This is what Monkey saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>They undid the buttons on their clothes,</P>
<P>Loosened the knots in their gauzy sashes.</P>
<P>Silvery white were their creamy breasts,</P>
<P>Snowy their bodies that looked like jade.</P>
<P>Their arms and elbows were cool as ice,</P>
<P>And scented shoulders more lovely than if powdered.</P>
<P>Soft and supple the skin on their stomachs,</P>
<P>Glistening and clean their backs.</P>
<P>Their knees and wrists were rounded and soft;</P>
<P>Only three inches long were their golden lotus feet.</P>
<P>And as for what lay in between,</P>
<P>They showed a glimpse of the cave of pleasure.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The women all jumped into the water and enjoyed themselves as they frolicked in the waves. &#8220;If I wanted to hit them,&#8221; Monkey thought, &#8220;I'd only need to stir the water with my cudgel. It would be like pouring boiling water on a nest of mice: I could kill the lot of them. What a pity. If I hit them I'd kill them, but it wouldn't do my reputation any good. As they say, a real man doesn't fight women. It'd be hopeless if a man like me killed these girls. If I'm not going to hit them I'll have to make things difficult for them so that they can't move.&#8221; The splendid Great Sage made a spell with his hands, said the words of it, shook himself and turned into a hungry eagle.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>His feathers were like frost or snow,</P>
<P>His eyes like bright stars.</P>
<P>When evil foxes saw him their souls were scared out of them;</P>
<P>And crafty hares were struck with terror.</P>
<P>His steely claws were sharp as spear-points;</P>
<P>His air was both majestic and ferocious.</P>
<P>He used his talons to seize his food,</P>
<P>And was ready to catch his flying prey himself.</P>
<P>He could fly high and low across the chilly sky,</P>
<P>Swooping through clouds and on his quarry at will.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>With a whoosh of his wings he flew towards them, stretched his sharp talons to seize all seven sets of clothes that were hung on the stands and flew straight back to the ridge with them. Here he reverted to his own form to see Pig and Friar Sand.</P>
<P>Just look at the idiot as he comes up to Brother Monkey and says with a grin, &#8220;The master must have been taken to a pawnbroker's.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you tell?&#8221; asked Friar Sand.</P>
<P>&#8220;Can't you see all those clothes our brother's grabbed?&#8221; Pig replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;These are the evil spirits' clothes,&#8221; said Monkey, putting them down.</P>
<P>&#8220;How on earth did you get so many?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;There are seven outfits,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;How did you strip them so easily, and strip them naked at that?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I didn't have to strip them,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;This place is called Gossamer Ridge, and the farm is called Gossamer Gave. The seven she-devils who live there captured the master, hung him up in their cave and all went off to bathe in the Filth-cleansing Spring. It's a natural hot spring. Their plan was to have a bath then steam the master and eat him. I went there with them and watched them undress and get into the water. I wanted to hit them, but I was worried it would contaminate my cudgel and ruin my reputation so I didn't. I just turned myself into a hungry eagle and grabbed their clothes in my talons. Now they're all squatting in the water, too embarrassed to come out. Let's rescue the master and be on our way as quickly as we can.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; grinned Pig, &#8220;you always leave something undone. You could see that they were evil spirits, so why didn't you kill them first then rescue the master? Even if they're too embarrassed to come out now they'll certainly come out after nightfall. They're bound to have enough old clothes at home to be able to put on an outfit each and come after us. Even if they don't come after us they live here permanently and we'll have to come this way back after we've fetched the scriptures. As the saying goes, it's better to get into debt on a journey than to get into a fight. When they stop us and make a row they'll really have it in for us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So what do you suggest?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you ask me we should kill the demons then rescue the master,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;That's what's called cutting down weeds and digging them out by the roots.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm not going to hit them,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;If you want them hit go and do it yourself.&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig then summoned up his spirits and in high delight rushed straight there, his rake held aloft. As he suddenly pushed the gates open and looked inside he saw the seven women squatting in the water and wildly cursing the eagle.</P>
<P>&#8220;Feathery beast,&#8221; they were saying, &#8220;cat-headed monster. What the hell can we do now you've carried our clothes off?&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig could not help laughing as he said to them, &#8220;Bodhisattvas, carry on with your bath. Do you mind if I join you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You monk, you're disgrace,&#8221; the devils retorted angrily as they saw him. &#8220;We're laywomen and you're a man of religion. As the ancient book has it, 'From the age of seven boys and girls do not share the same mat.' You mustn't possibly bathe in the same pool as us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But the weather's so scorching hot I've got no choice,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;You'll have to make the best of it and let me take a wash. What do you have to show off all that book-learning about sharing mats for?&#8221;</P>
<P>With further argument the idiot dropped his rake, stripped off his cotton tunic and jumped in with a splash, to the fury of the demons who all rushed at him to hit him. Little did they realize how expert Pig was in the water. Once in the pool he shook himself and turned into a catfish spirit. The demons then tried to grab him but even when they caught him they could not get a firm grip. If they grabbed to the East he suddenly shot Westwards, and if they tried to grab him to the West he went East. The funny thing was that he kept wriggling around their crotches. The water was about chest-high, and after swimming around at the surface and then at the bottom of the pool for a while he had covered all of it and was panting and exhausted.</P>
<P>Only then did Pig jump out, turn back into himself, put his tunic back on, pick up his rake and shout, &#8220;Who am I then? You thought I was a catfish spirit!&#8221;</P>
<P>At the sight of him the demons all trembled with fright and said to Pig, &#8220;When you came here first you were a monk, then you turned into a catfish in the water and we couldn't catch you. Now you've dressed like that. Where have you come from? You must tell us your name.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Bloody demons, you really don't know who I am,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;I'm a disciple of the Venerable Tang Priest, who has been sent from Tang in the East to fetch the scriptures. My title is Marshal Tian Peng and I'm called Zhu Wuneng, or Pig. You've hung my master up in your cave and you're planning to steam him and eat him. Is my master just a meal for you to cook? Stretch your heads out at once. I'm going to smash you all with my rake and wipe the lot of you out.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this the demons were scared out of their wits. They fell to their knees in the water, kowtowed to him and said, &#8220;Please be kind, reverend sir. We were blind and we captured your master by mistake. Although we did hang him up we haven't tortured him. We beg you in your compassion to spare our lives. We'll gladly give you some money for the journey and send your master on his way to the Western Heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Cut that talk out,&#8221; said Pig, waving his hands. &#8220;It's quite right what they say: 'Once you've been tricked by a confectioner you won't believe sweet-talkers again.' I'm going to hit you with my rake, then we can all go our separate ways.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot was thoroughly rough and crude and wanted to show off his powers. He was unmoved by their fragrant feminine beauty. Raising his rake he charged them, lashing out wildly without caring what he was doing. The demons acted desperately. Forgetting about their modesty they cared only about saving their lives as covering their private parts with their hands they jumped out of the water and ran into the pavilion. Standing there they used magic to make thick silken ropes come out of their navels, filling the sky with a huge silken canopy under which Pig was caught. When the idiot looked up he could not see the sun in the heavens. He tried to run outside, but he could not lift his feet, which were tangled in silken ropes that covered the ground. When he tried to move his feet he tripped and staggered. He tried going left, but his head crashed to the ground, then tried going right and came a cropper. So he turned round as quickly as he could and kissed the dirt, got himself back on his feet, and collapsed head first once more. Goodness only knows how many times he stumbled and fell till his whole body was numb, his feet sore, his head aching and his eyes blurred. He could no longer even crawl, but lay groaning on the floor. Then the demons tied him up. They neither beat him up nor wounded him, but sprang outside to rush back to their cave, leaving the silken canopy to blot out the daylight.</P>
<P>When they reached the stone bridge they stopped and said the words of a spell. In an instant the silk canopy had been put away, and they all rushed stark naked into the cave, covering their private parts with their hands as they ran giggling past the Tang Priest.</P>
<P>Once inside their bedrooms carved out of the rock they put on old clothes and went straight to the back door of the cave, where they stood and called, &#8220;Where are you, children?&#8221;</P>
<P>Now each she-devil had a child, not one that she had borne, but an adopted child who had taken her as a mother. They were called Bee, Hornet, Cockroach, Spanish-fly, Grasshopper, Wax-insect and Dragonfly, for such they were. The evil spirits had spread their nets across the sky, caught these seven insects and been on the point of eating them. But as the old saying goes, &#8220;Birds have bird language and beasts have beast language.&#8221;</P>
<P>The insects had pleaded for their lives and volunteered to take the spirits as their own mothers. Ever since then they had gathered blossoms in the spring and summer flowers for the evil spirits, and as soon as they heard the shouts they appeared and asked, &#8220;What orders do you have for us, mothers?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Sons,&#8221; the demons replied, &#8220;this morning we made a mistake and provoked the monk from Tang. His disciples trapped us in the pool and disgraced us. We were almost killed. You must do your utmost. Go outside and drive them away. When you've beaten them come to your uncle's to meet us.&#8221; The she-devils then fled for their lives and went to the home of their teacher's senior disciple, where their wicked tongues were to give rise to more disasters, but of that we shall not now speak. Watch while the insects rub their fists in their hands and go out to confront their enemies.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Pig, meanwhile, whose head was spinning after falling over so often, looked up and suddenly saw that the silken canopy and ropes had all disappeared. Groping around he picked himself up, and despite his pain he made his way back the way he had come. As soon as he saw Monkey he grabbed him and said, &#8220;Brother, is my head bulging? Is my face all blue?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What happened to you?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Those damned creatures caught me under a silken net and tripped me up goodness knows how many times with silk ropes,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;My waist was twisted, my back felt broken and I couldn't move an inch. Then the silk canopy and the ropes all disappeared, so I could escape and come back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Forget about it,&#8221; said Friar Sand when he saw him, &#8220;forget about it. You asked for trouble. I'm sure the demons have all gone back to the cave to harm the master. We must go and rescue him straight away.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he set out at once as fast as he could and rushed back to the farm while Pig led the horse. Here the seven little devils could be seen standing on the bridge, blocking their way and saying, &#8220;Not so fast, not so fast. We're here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a joke!&#8221; said Pig when he saw them. &#8220;They're just a bunch of kids. They're only two foot five or six, well under three foot, and they can only weigh eight or nine pounds, not even ten.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; he shouted.</P>
<P>&#8220;We're the sons of the seven immortal ladies,&#8221; the little devils replied. &#8220;You've insulted our mothers, and now you've got the effrontery to attack us, you ignorant fools. Stay where you are, and watch out.&#8221; The splendid monsters then launched a wild onslaught on Pig, who was in a flaming temper after falling over so often. Seeing how tiny the insects were he lifted his rake to strike furious blows at them.</P>
<P>When the little devils saw how ferocious the idiot was they all reverted to their original forms, flew into the air and shouted, &#8220;Change!&#8221; In an instant each of them became ten, each ten became a hundred, each hundred became a thousand, and each thousand became ten thousand. Every one became a countless number. This is what could be seen:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The sky was full of wax-flies,</P>
<P>Dragonflies danced all over the land.</P>
<P>Bees and hornets went for the head,</P>
<P>Cockroaches jobbed at the eyes.</P>
<P>Spanish-flies bit before and behind,</P>
<P>While grasshoppers stung above and below.</P>
<P>His face was black and crawling with insects:</P>
<P>Even devils or deities would have been scared by their speed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig in alarm, &#8220;you can say what you like about it being easy to fetch the scriptures, but on this road to the West even the insects give you a bad time.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be afraid, brother,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Go for them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But they're flying into my head and my face and all over my body,&#8221; replied Pig. &#8220;They're at least ten layers deep and all stinging me. How can I go for them?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No problem,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;no problem. I know a trick.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Whatever it is, brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;use it right now. His shaven head has swollen up with those bites in no time at all.&#8221; The splendid Great Sage pulled out a handful of hairs, chewed them into little bits and blew them out, telling them to turn to golden eagles, falcons, hawks, white eagles, vultures, ospreys and sparrowhawks. &#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;what's that jargon about goldens and all that?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Something you don't know about,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Golden eagles, falcons, hawks, white eagles, vultures, ospreys and sparrowhawks are the seven birds of prey that my hairs turned into. That's because the she-devils' children are insects.&#8221; Because the birds were so good at catching insects they got one every time they opened their beaks, grabbed at them with their claws or struck them with their wings. They wiped all the insects out in an instant, leaving no trace of them in the sky. The ground was piled over a foot deep with their bodies.</P>
<P>Only then could the three brothers charge across the bridge and into the cave, where they found their master hanging groaning and sobbing in mid-air. &#8220;Master,&#8221; said Pig, going up to him, &#8220;are you hanging around here for fun? I don't know how many times I've had to fall over on your account.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Untie the master before we take this conversation any further,&#8221; said Friar Sand. Brother Monkey then snapped the ropes and set the master free, asking, &#8220;Where did the evil spirits go?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;All seven of them ran stark naked through to the back,&#8221; the Tang Priest replied. &#8220;They were calling for their sons.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;After them, brothers!&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Follow me!&#8221;</P>
<P>The three of them, each holding his weapon, went searching in the back garden, but no sign of them could be found. They looked for them without success under all the peach and plum trees. &#8220;They've gone,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;they've gone.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We can stop looking for them,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;I'm going to help the master away from here.&#8221; The three brothers then went back to the front, where they asked the Tang Priest to mount up. &#8220;You two help the master along the way,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;I'm going to smash these buildings to the ground with my rake. Then they'll have nowhere to live when they come back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Smashing the place would be too much effort,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;The best way to cut off their roots would be to find some firewood.&#8221; The splendid idiot then gathered some dead pine, broken-off bamboo, dried-out willow and withered creepers that he set alight. The roaring blaze destroyed everything. Only then did master and disciples feel easy enough to be on their way.</P>
<P>If you don't know what of good or evil the demons were to do to them, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>盘丝洞七情迷本</p>
<p>濯垢泉八戒忘形</p>
</div>
<p>话表三藏别了朱紫国王，整顿鞍马西进。行彀多少山原，历尽无穷水道，不觉的秋去冬残，又值春光明媚。师徒们正在路踏青玩景，忽见一座庵林，三藏滚鞍下马，站立大道之旁。行者问道：“师父，这条路平坦无邪，因何不走？”八戒道：“师兄好不通情！师父在马上坐得困了，也让他下来关关风是。”三藏道：“不是关风，我看那里是个人家，意欲自去化些斋吃。”行者笑道：“你看师父说的是那里话。你要吃斋，我自去化，俗语云一日为师，终身为父，岂有为弟子者高坐，教师父去化斋之理？”三藏道：“不是这等说。平日间一望无边无际，你们没远没近的去化斋，今日人家逼近，可以叫应，也让我去化一个来。”</p>

<p>八戒道：“师父没主张。常言道，三人出外，小的儿苦，你况是个父辈，我等俱是弟子。古书云，有事弟子服其劳，等我老猪去。”</p>

<p>三藏道：“徒弟啊，今日天气晴明，与那风雨之时不同。那时节，汝等必定远去，此个人家，等我去，有斋无斋，可以就回走路。”</p>

<p>沙僧在旁笑道：“师兄，不必多讲，师父的心性如此，不必违拗。</p>

<p>若恼了他，就化将斋来，他也不吃。”</p>

<p>八戒依言，即取出钵盂，与他换了衣帽。拽开步，直至那庄前观看，却也好座住场，但见：石桥高耸，古树森齐。石桥高耸，潺潺流水接长溪；古树森齐，聒聒幽禽鸣远岱。桥那边有数椽茅屋，清清雅雅若仙庵；又有那一座蓬窗，白白明明欺道院。窗前忽见四佳人，都在那里刺凤描鸾做针线。长老见那人家没个男儿，只有四个女子，不敢进去，将身立定，闪在乔林之下，只见那女子，一个个：闺心坚似石，兰性喜如春。娇脸红霞衬，朱唇绛脂匀。蛾眉横月小，蝉鬓迭云新。若到花间立，游蜂错认真。少停有半个时辰，一发静悄悄，鸡犬无声。自家思虑道：</p>

<p>“我若没本事化顿斋饭，也惹那徒弟笑我，敢道为师的化不出斋来，为徒的怎能去拜佛。”长老没计奈何，也带了几分不是，趋步上桥，又走了几步，只见那茅屋里面有一座木香亭子，亭子下又有三个女子在那里踢气球哩。你看那三个女子，比那四个又生得不同，但见那：飘扬翠袖，摇拽缃裙。飘扬翠袖，低笼着玉笋纤纤；摇拽缃裙，半露出金莲窄窄。形容体势十分全，动静脚跟千样躧。拿头过论有高低，张泛送来真又楷。转身踢个出墙花，退步翻成大过海。轻接一团泥，单枪急对拐。明珠上佛头，实捏来尖靴。窄砖偏会拿，卧鱼将脚跘。平腰折膝蹲，扭顶翘跟躧。扳凳能喧泛，披肩甚脱洒。绞裆任往来，锁项随摇摆。踢的是黄河水倒流，金鱼滩上买。那个错认是头儿，这个转身就打拐。端然捧上臁，周正尖来潠。提跟潠草鞋，倒插回头采。退步泛肩妆，钩儿只一歹。版篓下来长，便把夺门揣。踢到美心时，佳人齐喝采。一个个汗流粉腻透罗裳，兴懒情疏方叫海。</p>

<p>言不尽，又有诗为证，诗曰：蹴踘当场三月天，仙风吹下素婵娟。汗沾粉面花含露，尘染蛾眉柳带烟。翠袖低垂笼玉笋，缃裙斜拽露金莲。几回踢罢娇无力，云鬓蓬松宝髻偏。三藏看得时辰久了，只得走上桥头，应声高叫道：“女菩萨，贫僧这里随缘布施些儿斋吃。”那些女子听见，一个个喜喜欢欢抛了针线，撇了气球，都笑笑吟吟的接出门来道：“长老，失迎了，今到荒庄，决不敢拦路斋僧，请里面坐。”三藏闻言，心中暗道：“善哉，善哉！西方正是佛地！女流尚且注意斋僧，男子岂不虔心向佛？”长老向前问讯了，相随众女入茅屋，过木香亭看处，呀！</p>

<p>原来那里边没甚房廊，只见那：峦头高耸，地脉遥长。峦头高耸接云烟，地脉遥长通海岳。门近石桥，九曲九湾流水顾；园栽桃李，千株千颗斗秾华。藤薜挂悬三五树，芝兰香散万千花。远观洞府欺蓬岛，近睹山林压太华。正是妖仙寻隐处，更无邻舍独成家。有一女子上前，把石头门推开两扇，请唐僧里面坐。那长老只得进去，忽抬头看时，铺设的都是石桌、石凳，冷气阴阴。长老心惊，暗自思忖道：“这去处少吉多凶，断然不善。”众女子喜笑吟吟都道：“长老请坐。”长老没奈何，只得坐了，少时间，打个冷禁。众女子问道：“长老是何宝山？化甚么缘？还是修桥补路，建寺礼塔，还是造佛印经？请缘簿出来看看。”长老道：“我不是化缘的和尚。”女子道：“既不化缘，到此何干？”长老道：“我是东土大唐差去西天大雷音求经者。适过宝方，腹间饥馁，特造檀府，募化一斋，贫僧就行也。”众女子道：“好！好！</p>

<p>好！常言道，远来的和尚好看经。妹妹们！不可怠慢，快办斋来。”</p>

<p>此时有三个女子陪着，言来语去，论说些因缘。那四个到厨中撩衣敛袖，炊火刷锅。你道他安排的是些甚么东西？原来是人油炒炼，人肉煎熬，熬得黑糊充作面筋样子，剜的人脑煎作豆腐块片。两盘儿捧到石桌上放下，对长老道：“请了，仓卒间，不曾备得好斋，且将就吃些充腹，后面还有添换来也。”那长老闻了一闻，见那腥膻，不敢开口，欠身合掌道：“女菩萨，贫僧是胎里素。”众女子笑道：“长老，此是素的。”长老道：“阿弥陀佛！若象这等素的啊，我和尚吃了，莫想见得世尊，取得经卷。”众女子道：“长老，你出家人，切莫拣人布施。”长老道：“怎敢，怎敢！我和尚奉大唐旨意，一路西来，微生不损，见苦就救，遇谷粒手拈入口，逢丝缕联缀遮身，怎敢拣主布施！”众女子笑道：“长老虽不拣人布施，却只有些上门怪人。莫嫌粗淡，吃些儿罢。”长老道：“实是不敢吃，恐破了戒，望菩萨养生不若放生，放我和尚出去罢。”那长老挣着要走，那女子拦住门，怎么肯放，俱道：“上门的买卖，倒不好做！放了屁儿，却使手掩，你往那里去？”他一个个都会些武艺，手脚又活，把长老扯住，顺手牵羊，扑的掼倒在地。众人按住，将绳子捆了，悬梁高吊，这吊有个名色，叫做“仙人指路”。原来是一只手向前，牵丝吊起；</p>

<p>一只手拦腰捆住，将绳吊起，两只脚向后一条绳吊起，三条绳把长老吊在梁上，却是脊背朝上，肚皮朝下。那长老忍着疼，噙着泪，心中暗恨道：“我和尚这等命苦！只说是好人家化顿斋吃，岂知道落了火坑！徒弟啊！速来救我，还得见面，但迟两个时辰，我命休矣！”那长老虽然苦恼，却还留心看着那些女子。</p>

<p>那些女子把他吊得停当，便去脱剥衣服。长老心惊，暗自忖道：</p>

<p>“这一脱了衣服，是要打我的情了，或者夹生儿吃我的情也有哩。”原来那女子们只解了上身罗衫，露出肚腹，各显神通：一个个腰眼中冒出丝绳，有鸭蛋粗细，骨都都的，迸玉飞银，时下把庄门瞒了不题。</p>

<p>却说那行者、八戒、沙僧，都在大道之旁。他二人都放马看担，惟行者是个顽皮，他且跳树攀枝，摘叶寻果，忽回头，只见一片光亮，慌得跳下树来，吆喝道：“不好，不好！师父造化低了！”行者用手指道：“你看那庄院如何？”八戒沙僧共目视之，那一片如雪又亮如雪，似银又光似银。八戒道：“罢了罢了！师父遇着妖精了！我们快去救他也！”行者道：“贤弟莫嚷，你都不见怎的，等老孙去来。”沙僧道：“哥哥仔细。”行者道：“我自有处。”好大圣，束一束虎皮裙，掣出金箍棒，拽开脚，两三步跑到前边，看见那丝绳缠了有千百层厚，穿穿道道，却似经纬之势，用手按了一按，有些粘软沾人。行者更不知是甚么东西，他即举棒道：“这一棒，莫说是几千层，就有几万层，也打断了！”正欲打，又停住手道：“若是硬的便可打断，这个软的，只好打匾罢了。假如惊了他，缠住老孙，反为不美。等我且问他一问再打。”你道他问谁？即捻一个诀，念一个咒，拘得个土地老儿在庙里似推磨的一般乱转。土地婆儿道：“老儿，你转怎的？好道是羊儿风发了！”土地道：“你不知！你不知！有一个齐天大圣来了，我不曾接他，他那里拘我哩。”婆儿道：“你去见他便了，却如何在这里打转？”土地道：“若去见他，他那棍子好不重，他管你好歹就打哩！”婆儿道：“他见你这等老了，那里就打你？”</p>

<p>土地道：“他一生好吃没钱酒，偏打老年人。”两口儿讲一会，没奈何只得走出去，战兢兢的跪在路旁叫道：“大圣，当境土地叩头。”行者道：“你且起来，不要假忙，我且不打你，寄下在那里。</p>

<p>我问你，此间是甚地方？”土地道：“大圣从那厢来？”行者道：</p>

<p>“我自东土往西来的。”土地道：“大圣东来，可曾在那山岭上？”</p>

<p>行者道：“正在那山岭上，我们行李马匹还都歇在那岭上不是！”土地道：“那岭叫做盘丝岭，岭下有洞叫做盘丝洞，洞里有七个妖精。”行者道：“是男怪女怪？”土地道：“是女怪。”行者道：“他有多大神通？”土地道：“小神力薄威短，不知他有多大手段，只知那正南上，离此有三里之遥，有一座濯垢泉，乃天生的热水，原是上方七仙姑的浴池。自妖精到此居住，占了他的濯垢泉，仙姑更不曾与他争竞，平白地就让与他了。我见天仙不惹妖魔怪，必定精灵有大能。”行者道：“占了此泉何干？”土地道：“这怪占了浴池，一日三遭，出来洗澡。如今巳时已过，午时将来哑。”行者听言道：“土地，你且回去，等我自家拿他罢。”</p>

<p>那土地老儿磕了一个头，战兢兢的回本庙去了。</p>

<p>这大圣独显神通，摇身一变，变作个麻苍蝇儿，钉在路旁草梢上等待。须臾间，只听得呼呼吸吸之声，犹如蚕食叶，却似海生潮。只好有半盏茶时，丝绳皆尽，依然现出庄村，还象当初模样。又听得呀的一声，柴扉响处，里边笑语喧哗，走出七个女子。行者在暗中细看，见他一个个携手相搀，挨肩执袂，有说有笑的，走过桥来，果是标致。但见：比玉香尤胜，如花语更真。柳眉横远岫，檀口破樱唇。钗头翘翡翠，金莲闪绛裙。却似嫦娥临下界，仙子落凡尘。行者笑道：“怪不得我师父要来化斋，原来是这一般好处。这七个美人儿，假若留住我师父，要吃也不彀一顿吃，要用也不彀两日用，要动手轮流一摆布就是死了。</p>

<p>且等我去听他一听，看他怎的算计。”好大圣，嘤的一声，飞在那前面走的女子云髻上钉住。才过桥来，后边的走向前来呼道：“姐姐，我们洗了澡，来蒸那胖和尚吃去。”行者暗笑道：“这怪物好没算计！煮还省些柴，怎么转要蒸了吃！”那些女子采花斗草向南来，不多时，到了浴池。但见一座门墙，十分壮丽，遍地野花香艳艳，满旁兰蕙密森森。后面一个女子，走上前，唿哨的一声，把两扇门儿推开，那中间果有一塘热水。这水自开辟以来，太阳星原贞有十，后被羿善开弓，射落九乌坠地，止存金乌一星，乃太阳之真火也。天地有九处汤泉，俱是众乌所化。那九阳泉，乃香冷泉、伴山泉、温泉、东合泉、满山泉、孝安泉、广汾泉、汤泉，此泉乃濯垢泉。有诗为证，诗曰：一气无冬夏，三秋永注春。炎波如鼎沸，热浪似汤新。分溜滋禾稼，停流荡俗尘。</p>

<p>涓涓珠泪泛，滚滚玉团津。润滑原非酿，清平还自温。瑞祥本地秀，造化乃天真。佳人洗处冰肌滑，涤荡尘烦玉体新。那浴池约有五丈余阔，十丈多长，内有四尺深浅，但见水清彻底。底下水一似滚珠泛玉骨都都冒将上来，四面有六七个孔窍通流。</p>

<p>流去二三里之遥，淌到田里，还是温水。池上又有三间亭子，亭子中近后壁放着一张八只脚的板凳。两山头放着两个描金彩漆的衣架。行者暗中喜嘤嘤的，一翅飞在那衣架头上钉住。</p>

<p>那些女子见水又清又热，便要洗浴，即一齐脱了衣服，搭在衣架上。一齐下去，被行者看见：褪放纽扣儿，解开罗带结。</p>

<p>酥胸白似银，玉体浑如雪。肘膊赛凝胭，香肩疑粉捏。肚皮软又绵，脊背光还洁。膝腕半围团，金莲三寸窄。中间一段情，露出风流穴。那女子都跳下水去，一个个跃浪翻波，负水顽耍。行者道：“我若打他啊，只消把这棍子往池中一搅，就叫做滚汤泼老鼠，一窝儿都是死。可怜！可怜！打便打死他，只是低了老孙的名头。常言道，男不与女斗，我这般一个汉子，打杀这几个丫头，着实不济。不要打他，只送他一个绝后计，教他动不得身，出不得水，多少是好。”好大圣，捏着诀，念个咒，摇身一变，变作一个饿老鹰，但见：毛犹霜雪，眼若明星。妖狐见处魂皆丧，狡兔逢时胆尽惊。钢爪锋芒快，雄姿猛气横。会使老拳供口腹，不辞亲手逐飞腾。万里寒空随上下，穿云检物任他行。呼的一翅，飞向前，轮并利爪，把他那衣架上搭的七套衣服，尽情雕去，径转岭头，现出本相来见八戒、沙僧道：“你看。”那呆子迎着对沙僧笑道：“师父原来是典当铺里拿了去的。”沙僧道：</p>

<p>“怎见得？”八戒道：“你不见师兄把他些衣服都抢将来也？”行者放下道：“此是妖精穿的衣服。”八戒道：“怎么就有这许多？”</p>

<p>行者道：“七套。”八戒道：“如何这般剥得容易，又剥得干净？”</p>

<p>行者道：“那曾用剥。原来此处唤做盘丝岭，那庄村唤做盘丝洞。洞中有七个女怪，把我师父拿住，吊在洞里，都向濯垢泉去洗浴。那泉却是天地产成的一塘子热水。他都算计着洗了澡要把师父蒸吃。是我跟到那里，见他脱了衣服下水，我要打他，恐怕污了棍子，又怕低了名头，是以不曾动棍，只变做一个饿老鹰，雕了他的衣服。他都忍辱含羞，不敢出头，蹲在水中哩。</p>

<p>我等快去解下师父走路罢。”八戒笑道：“师兄，你凡干事，只要留根。既见妖精，如何不打杀他，却就去解师父！他如今纵然藏羞不出，到晚间必定出来。他家里还有旧衣服，穿上一套，来赶我们。纵然不赶，他久住在此，我们取了经，还从那条路回去。常言道，宁少路边钱，莫少路边拳。那时节，他拦住了吵闹，却不是个仇人也？”行者道：“凭你如何主张？”八戒道：“依我，先打杀了妖精，再去解放师父，此乃斩草除根之计。”行者道：</p>

<p>“我是不打他。你要打，你去打他。”</p>

<p>八戒抖擞精神，欢天喜地举着钉钯，拽开步，径直跑到那里。忽的推开门看时，只见那七个女子，蹲在水里，口中乱骂那鹰哩，道：“这个匾毛畜生！猫嚼头的亡人！把我们衣服都雕去了，教我们怎的动手！”八戒忍不住笑道：“女菩萨，在这里洗澡哩，也携带我和尚洗洗何如？”那怪见了作怒道：“你这和尚，十分无礼！我们是在家的女流，你是个出家的男子。古书云：七年男女不同席，你好和我们同塘洗澡？”八戒道：“天气炎热，没奈何，将就容我洗洗儿罢。那里调甚么书担儿，同席不同席！”</p>

<p>呆子不容说，丢了钉钯，脱了皂锦直裰，扑的跳下水来，那怪心中烦恼，一齐上前要打。不知八戒水势极熟，到水里摇身一变，变做一个鲇鱼精。那怪就都摸鱼，赶上拿他不住：东边摸，忽的又渍了西去；西边摸，忽的又渍了东去；滑扢虀的，只在那腿裆里乱钻。原来那水有搀胸之深，水上盘了一会，又盘在水底，都盘倒了，喘嘘嘘的，精神倦怠。八戒却才跳将上来，现了本相，穿了直裰，执着钉钯喝道：“我是那个？你把我当鲇鱼精哩！”那怪见了，心惊胆战对八戒道：“你先来是个和尚，到水里变作鲇鱼，及拿你不住，却又这般打扮，你端的是从何到此？是必留名。”八戒道：“这伙泼怪当真的不认得我！我是东土大唐取经的唐长老之徒弟，乃天蓬元帅悟能八戒是也。你把我师父吊在洞里，算计要蒸他受用！我的师父又好蒸吃？快早伸过头来，各筑一钯，教你断根！”那些妖闻此言，魂飞魄散，就在水中跪拜道：“望老爷方便方便！我等有眼无珠，误捉了你师父，虽然吊在那里，不曾敢加刑受苦。望慈悲饶了我的性命，情愿贴些盘费，送你师父往西天去也。”八戒摇头道：“莫说这话！俗语说得好，曾着卖糖君子哄，到今不信口甜人。是便筑一钯，各人走路！”呆子一味粗夯，显手段，那有怜香惜玉之心，举着钯，不分好歹，赶上前乱筑。那怪慌了手脚，那里顾甚么羞耻，只是性命要紧，随用手侮着羞处，跳出水来，都跑在亭子里站立，作出法来：脐孔中骨都都冒出丝绳，瞒天搭了个大丝篷，把八戒罩在当中。那呆子忽抬头，不见天日，即抽身往外便走，那里举得脚步！原来放了绊脚索，满地都是丝绳，动动脚，跌个躘踵：左边去，一个面磕地；右边去，一个倒栽葱；急转身，又跌了个嘴揾地；忙爬起，又跌了个竖蜻蜓。也不知跌了多少跟头，把个呆子跌得身麻脚软，头晕眼花，爬也爬不动，只睡在地下呻吟。那怪物却将他困住，也不打他，也不伤他，一个个跳出门来，将丝篷遮住天光，各回本洞。到了石桥上站下，念动真言，霎时间把丝篷收了，赤条条的，跑入洞里，侮着那话，从唐僧面前笑嘻嘻的跑过去。走入石房，取几件旧衣穿了，径至后门口立定叫：“孩儿们何在？”原来那妖精一个有一个儿子，却不是他养的，都是他结拜的干儿子。有名唤做蜜、蚂、蜍、班、蜢、蜡、蜻：蜜是蜜蜂，蚂是蚂蜂，蜍是蜍蜂，班是班毛，蜢是牛蜢，蜡是抹蜡，蜻是蜻蜓。原来那妖精幔天结网，掳住这七般虫蛭，却要吃他。古云禽有禽言，兽有兽语，当时这些虫哀告饶命，愿拜为母，遂此春采百花供怪物，夏寻诸卉孝妖精。忽闻一声呼唤，都到面前问：“母亲有何使令？”众怪道：“儿啊，早间我们错惹了唐朝来的和尚，才然被他徒弟拦在池里，出了多少丑，几乎丧了性命！</p>

<p>汝等努力，快出门前去退他一退。如得胜后，可到你舅舅家来会我。”那些怪既得逃生，往他师兄处，孽嘴生灾不题。你看这些虫蛭，一个个摩拳擦掌，出来迎敌。</p>

<p>却说八戒跌得昏头昏脑，猛抬头见丝篷丝索俱无，他才一步一探爬将起来，忍着疼找回原路，见了行者，用手扯住道：</p>

<p>“哥哥，我的头可肿、脸可青么？”行者道：“你怎的来？”八戒道：</p>

<p>“我被那厮将丝绳罩住，放了绊脚索，不知跌了多少跟头，跌得我腰拖背折，寸步难移。却才丝篷索子俱空，方得了性命回来也。”沙僧见了道：“罢了，罢了！你闯下祸来也！那怪一定往洞里去伤害师父、我等快去救他！”行者闻言急拽步便走，八戒牵着马急急来到庄前，但见那石桥上有七个小妖儿挡住道：“慢来，慢来！吾等在此！”行者看了道：“好笑！干净都是些小人儿！</p>

<p>长的也只有二尺五六寸，不满三尺；重的也只有八九斤，不满十斤。”喝道：“你是谁？”那怪道：“我乃七仙姑的儿子。你把我母亲欺辱了，还敢无知，打上我门！不要走！仔细！”好怪物！一个个手之舞之，足之蹈之，乱打将来。八戒见了生嗔，本是跌恼了的性子，又见那伙虫蛭小巧，就发狠举钯来筑。</p>

<p>那些怪见呆子凶猛，一个个现了本象，飞将起去，叫声“变！”须臾间，一个变十个，十个变百个，百个变千个，千个变万个，个个都变成无穷之数。只见：满天飞抹蜡，遍地舞蜻蜓。</p>

<p>蜜蚂追头额，蜍蜂扎眼睛。班毛前后咬，牛蜢上下叮。扑面漫漫黑，翛翛神鬼惊。八戒慌了道：“哥啊，只说经好取，西方路上，虫儿也欺负人哩！”行者道：“兄弟，不要怕，快上前打！”八戒道：“扑头扑脸，浑身上下，都叮有十数层厚，却怎么打？”行者道：“没事！没事！我自有手段！”沙僧道：“哥啊，有甚手段，快使出来罢！一会子光头上都叮肿了！”好大圣，拔了一把毫毛，嚼得粉碎，喷将出去，即变做些黄、麻、鴏、白、雕、鱼、鹞。八戒道：“师兄，又打甚么市语，黄啊、麻啊哩？”行者道：“你不知，黄是黄鹰，麻是麻鹰，鴏是鴏鹰，白是白鹰，雕是雕鹰，鱼是鱼鹰，鹞是鹞鹰。那妖精的儿子是七样虫，我的毫毛是七样鹰。”</p>

<p>鹰最能、虫，一嘴一个，爪打翅敲，须臾，打得罄尽，满空无迹，地积尺余。</p>

<p>三兄弟方才闯过桥去，径入洞里，只见老师父吊在那里哼哼的哭哩。八戒近前道：“师父，你是要来这里吊了耍子，不知作成我跌了多少跟头哩！”沙僧道：“且解下师父再说。”行者即将绳索挑断放下唐僧，都问道：“妖精那里去了？”唐僧道：“那七个怪都赤条条的往后边叫儿子去了。”行者道：“兄弟们，跟我来寻去。”三人各持兵器，往后园里寻处，不见踪迹。都到那桃李树上寻遍不见，八戒道：“去了！去了！”沙僧道：“不必寻他，等我扶师父去也。”弟兄们复来前面请唐僧上马道：“师父，下次化斋，还让我们去。”唐僧道：“徒弟呵，以后就是饿死，也再不自专了。”八戒道：“你们扶师父走着，等老猪一顿钯筑倒他这房子，教他来时没处安身。”行者笑道：“筑还费力，不若寻些柴来，与他个断根罢。”好呆子，寻了些朽松破竹，干柳枯藤，点上一把火，烘烘的都烧得干净。师徒却才放心前来。咦！毕竟这去，不知那怪的吉凶如何，且听下回分解。</p>
