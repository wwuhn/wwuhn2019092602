<P>False Faith Oppresses the True Dharma</P>
<P>The Sage Mind-Ape Eliminates Evil</P>
</div>
<P>The story tells how when the king saw that Monkey had the power to summon dragons and order gods about he put his seal on the passports and handed them to the Tang Priest, whom he allowed to continue on his journey West. The three Taoist masters were so terrified that they prostrated themselves in the Hall of Golden Bells and submitted a memorial to the king, who came down from his dragon throne, helped them to their feet with his own hand, and said, &#8220;Why are you performing this obeisance to me today?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; the Taoists replied, &#8220;we came here to help the country, protect the state and look after the people. We have toiled here for twenty years but now these Buddhist monks have put themselves ahead of us and ruined our reputation with a magic trick. Are you not insulting us by letting them off their death sentences just because of some rain? We implore you to keep their papers and allow us three brothers to challenge them to another competition. What do you think?&#8221;</P>
<P>The king of Tarrycart really was muddle-headed: when he heard advice from the East he inclined to the East, and when he was advised from the West he inclined to the West. &#8220;What sort of competition with them do you propose, Teachers of the Nation?&#8221; he asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;We would like to compete with them in sitting in meditation,&#8221; said the Great Immortal Tiger Power.</P>
<P>&#8220;The Teacher of the Nation must have made a mistake,&#8221; the king replied. &#8220;That monk comes from a sect that practices<I> dhyana</I> meditation. He must have mastered the art of meditation before his emperor sent him to fetch scriptures. Why would you want to compete with him at that?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The way we sit in meditation,&#8221; the Great Immortal replied, &#8220;is not the ordinary way. It has a special name: 'revealing one's holiness on a cloud ladder'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What does that mean?&#8221; the king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;A hundred tables are needed,&#8221; said the Great Immortal. &#8220;Fifty of them are piled one on top of each other to make the meditation platform. Once must mount it not by using one's hands or a ladder, but by riding a cloud to take one's seat on it and sit motionless for the agreed number of hours.&#8221;</P>
<P>Realizing that this was rather difficult he asked this question: &#8220;Monks, the Teacher of the Nation would like to compete with you in a way of sitting in meditation called 'revealing one's holiness on a cloud ladder'. Can any of you do that?&#8221; When Monkey heard this he kept silent and did not reply.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; asked Pig, &#8220;why aren't you saying anything?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll be honest with you,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;I can manage all sorts of tricks like kicking the sky into a well, stirring up the sea, turning rivers upside down, lifting mountains, chasing the moon away, and moving stars and constellations around. I'm not afraid of having my head chopped off, my brains sliced up, my entrails laid open, my heart cut out and being shifted about in other ways like that. But when it comes to sitting in meditation I'm beaten. I'm not a sitter by nature. Even if you chained me to an iron column I'd want to wriggle up and down. I'd never want to sit still.&#8221;</P>
<P>Then Sanzang cut in with, &#8220;I can sit in meditation.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's splendid,&#8221; said Monkey with delight, &#8220;splendid. But how long can you do it for?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When I was young,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;a monk of the Chan sect who came to my monastery taught the way of fastening one's being to the root, settling the nature, and fixing the spirit while on the boundary of life and death. I can sit for two or three years.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you're going to sit there for two or three years, Master,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;we can give up the idea of going to fetch the scriptures. You won't need to sit there for more than a few hours before coming down.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But I can't get up there, disciple,&#8221; Sanzang protested.</P>
<P>&#8220;Go forward and accept the challenge,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'll get you up there.&#8221;</P>
<P>The venerable elder put his hands together in front of his chest and said, &#8220;This humble monk can sit in meditation.&#8221; The king then ordered that the meditation platforms be built. The state had the resources to tear down mountains, and in less than an hour the two meditation platforms had been built, one to each side of the throne hall.</P>
<P>The Great Immortal Tiger Power then went down from the hall, stood in the middle of the steps, sprang into the air and went straight up on a cloud to the Western platform and set down. Monkey plucked out one of his hairs and turned it into a double of himself that stood below with Pig and Friar Sand while he made his real self into a coloured auspicious cloud that lifted the Tang Priest up through the air to take his seat on the Eastern platform.</P>
<P>Then he put the cloud away, turned into the tiniest of insects, flow into Pig's ear, and said, &#8220;Brother, keep a very close eye on the master and don't talk to my double.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I understand, I understand,&#8221; replied the idiot with a grin.</P>
<P>The Great Immortal Deer Power had been sitting on his embroidered cushion for a very long time watching the two of them sitting on their high platforms without either emerging as the winner. He decided to help his elder brother, so he plucked a hair from the back of his head, rolled it into a ball, and flicked it straight at the Tang Priest's head, where it turned into a huge bedbug that started biting the venerable elder. Sanzang first itched and then was in pain. When sitting in meditation movements of the hand are forbidden; if he moved his hand he would lose. The agony was soon unbearable, and he pulled his head down to scratch it against his collar.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is bad,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;The master's being driven mad by epilepsy.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;it's a migraine.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he said, &#8220;Our master is sincere and a gentleman. If he says he can sit in meditation he most certainly can. Gentlemen don't lie. You two shut up while I go up there for a look.&#8221; The splendid Monkey then flew with a buzz straight up to the Tang Priest's head, where he saw a bedbug the size of a bean biting the master. He immediately picked it off him then scratched and rubbed his head for him, so that the venerable elder did not itch or ache any more and sat up straight again.</P>
<P>&#8220;Monks have bald heads,&#8221; thought Brother Monkey, &#8220;and not even a louse could settle on one, let alone a bedbug. I think it must have been a trick by those Taoists to get the master killed. Hunh! Well, they haven't won yet, despite their cheating. I'll try a trick on them.&#8221; Monkey then flew up and landed on the head of one of the ceramic animals on the roof of the palace hall. He shook himself and turned into a poisonous centipede seven inches long that went straight for the Taoist and stung him in the nose. The Taoist could sit still no longer, and tumbling head over heels he fell off the platform and would probably have died had not the senior and junior officials saved him. The horrified king sent the royal tutor to take the Taoist to the Hall of Literary Splendor to comb his hair and clean himself up; meanwhile Monkey went up on his auspicious cloud to carry his victorious master down to before the steps of the throne hall.</P>
<P>The king ordered that Sanzang be allowed to leave the country, but the Great Immortal Deer Power made this submission: &#8220;Your Majesty, my elder brother has long suffered from rheumatism. The heavenly wind in that high place brought on a new attack of his illness, which was why the Buddhist monk won. Please keep him here so that I can compete with him at guessing objects through wooden boards?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What is guessing objects through wooden boards?&#8221; the king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;This humble Taoist has the power of knowing what is on the other side of a board,&#8221; Deer Power replied, &#8220;and I would like to see whether that Buddhist monk can too. If he is better at guessing than I am, let him go. But if he is not then I hope Your Majesty will decide what crime he is guilty of, avenge us brothers, and not allow our twenty years of protecting the country to be sullied.&#8221;</P>
<P>The king was so utterly muddle-headed that he accepted this malicious suggestion and ordered that a red lacquered chest be carried by the eunuchs of the royal household into the harem, where his queen was told to put one of her treasures inside. The chest was carried out and set in front of the steps of the throne hall a few moments later. &#8220;Your two faiths must each compete with your magical powers in guessing what treasure is in the chest,&#8221; he told the Buddhist and the Taoist.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; asked Sanzang, &#8220;how can I tell what is inside?&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey put his cloud away, turned himself back into the smallest of insects, landed on Sanzang's face and said, &#8220;Don't worry, master. I'll go and take a look.&#8221; The splendid Great Sage flew over to the chest, crawled under its legs, and saw a crack between the boards through which he squeezed inside. Here he saw a red lacquer tray in which was placed a set of court robes: a mountain, river and state jacket and a heaven, earth and land skirt. He picked them up, shook and crumpled them, bit the tip of his tongue, sprayed a mouthful of blood over them, called &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned them into a worn-out cloak into which he pissed before crawling out through the crack between the boards. He then flew back to the Tang Priest's ear and said, &#8220;Master, say that it's a worn-out cloak.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But he told me to guess what treasure is inside,&#8221; said the Tang Priest. &#8220;What sort of treasure is an old cloak?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Never mind about that,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Just make that guess.&#8221; The Tang Priest stepped forward and was just about to state his guess when Deer Power said, &#8220;I shall make the first guess. The chest contains a mountain, river and state jacket and a heaven, earth and land skirt.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the Tang Priest, &#8220;it does not. The chest contains a rotten cloak.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That monk is being outrageous,&#8221; said the king. &#8220;He has the effrontery to suggest that our country has no treasures by guessing that it contains a tattered old cloak. Execute him!&#8221;</P>
<P>The two groups of guards officers were just about to fall upon the Tang Priest when he called out desperately, &#8220;Your Majesty, spare me for a moment while the chest is opened for you to look inside. If there really is a treasure there I shall accept my punishment; but if there is not you would be doing me an injustice.&#8221; The king then ordered that the chest be opened, and when the officials in attendance on him opened it and lifted out the red tray he saw that there really was a putrid old cloak on it.</P>
<P>&#8220;Who put that there?&#8221; asked the king in a great fury.</P>
<P>The queen then slipped forward from behind the dragon throne to say, &#8220;My lord, I put the mountain, river and state jacket and the heaven, earth and land skirt inside myself. I don't know how they can have turned into that.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You may retire, good wife,&#8221; said the king. &#8220;I believe you. All the things used in the harem are of the finest silks and gauzes. We would never have anything like that.&#8221; He then ordered that the chest be carried up to him so that he could put a treasure inside it himself for another test.</P>
<P>The king then went into the harem, picked a peach as big as a bowl from the magic peach tree in the palace gardens, placed it in the chest and had it carried down for the two of them to guess what it was.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; said the Tang Priest, &#8220;I have to guess again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;I'll take another look.&#8221; Once more he buzzed over, went in through the same crack, and saw a peach that was just to his liking. He turned back into himself and ate the peach clean up as he sat in the chest, nibbling every single piece of it, including the damaged parts of the skin, and leaving the stone there when he turned back into the tiniest of insects and flew back to land on Sanzang's ear. &#8220;Master,&#8221; he said, &#8220;guess that it's a peach stone.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't make a fool of me, disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;If I hadn't spoken up fast just now I would have been executed. This time I must guess that it is something precious, and there is nothing precious about a peach stone.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be afraid,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;All that matters is winning.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before Sanzang could speak the Great Immortal Antelope Power said, &#8220;I shall make the first guess. It is a magic peach.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It is not a peach, only a peach stone,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;But we put the peach in there ourself,&#8221; said the king. &#8220;It could not possibly be only a stone. The Third Teacher of the Nation is right.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; put in Sanzang, &#8220;open the chest up and look.&#8221;</P>
<P>Once more the officials in attendance carried the chest up to be opened, lifted out the dish, and revealed only a stone with no skin or flesh, a sight that shocked the king.</P>
<P>&#8220;Teachers of the Nation,&#8221; he said, &#8220;stop competing with him and let him go. We put the magic peach in there with our own hands. If there is only a stone there now, who can have eaten it? He must have gods or demons helping him in secret.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Pig heard this he said to Friar Sand with a touch of a sarcastic grin, &#8220;The king doesn't realize that Monkey is an expert when it comes to eating peaches.&#8221;</P>
<P>As he was saying this the Great Immortal Tiger Power came back into the throne hall after combing his hair and washing himself in the Hall of Literary Splendor. &#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; he said, &#8220;this monk has the art of shifting and changing things. Have the chest brought up here. I will break his magic and have another divination contest with him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you want to guess now?&#8221; the king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Magic can change only things, not people,&#8221; said Tiger Power. &#8220;Hide this boy Taoist in the chest, and I guarantee that the monk will not be able to change him.&#8221; The boy got inside, the lid was put on, and the chest carried down.</P>
<P>&#8220;Guess what treasure is inside it this third time, monk,&#8221; the king said.</P>
<P>&#8220;Again!&#8221; exclaimed Sanzang, to which Monkey replied, &#8220;Wait while I take another look.&#8221; Once more he buzzed over and squeezed inside, this time to find a little boy inside.</P>
<P>Splendid Monkey knew what to do. How true it is that few in the world can do improvised transformations, and hardly any as skillfully as he. He shook himself, turned into the exact image of the old Taoist, went into the chest and said &#8220;Disciple.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where have you come from, master?&#8221; the boy asked him.</P>
<P>&#8220;I came by disappearing magic,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;What instructions do you have for me?&#8221; the boy asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The Buddhist monk saw you getting into the chest,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;and if he says that there's a young Taoist in here we'll have lost. I've come here to work out a plan with you. We'll shave your head and guess that you're a Buddhist monk.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do whatever you decide, master,&#8221; said the boy, &#8220;as long as we win. If we lose to him again our reputation will be ruined and the king will have no more respect for us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Come here, my boy, and if we win I'll reward you richly.&#8221; He then turned his gold-banded cudgel into a razor, put his arms firmly round the boy, and said, &#8220;Put up with the pain, there's a good boy, and don't make a sound while I shave your head.&#8221; In an instant he had shaved off the boy's hair, which he stuffed into a ball and hid in a corner of the chest. Then he put the razor away and stroked the boy's shaven pate saying, &#8220;Your head looks like a Buddhist monk's now, my boy, but your clothes are wrong. Take them off and I'll transform them for you.&#8221;</P>
<P>The boy took off his greenish-white cloud-patterned crane cloak with embroidered brocade hems. Monkey blew on it with a magic breath, called &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned it into a brown Buddhist monk's habit for the boy to put on. Monkey pulled out two more hairs and turned them into a wooden fish that he gave to the boy saying, &#8220;Listen carefully, disciple. Whatever happens don't come out when you hear a call of 'Taoist boy'. But when you hear someone say 'Buddhist monk,' lift the lid of the chest with your head, strike the wooden fish, and come out reciting a Buddhist surra. Do that and we will win.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But I can only recite the<I> Classic of the Three Officials, the Classic of the Dipper,</I> and the<I> Classic of Elimination of Disaster,&#8221;</I> said the boy, &#8220;I don't know any Buddhist scriptures.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Can you recite the name of a Buddha?&#8221; asked Monkey. &#8220;Anyone can recite 'Amitabha Buddha,'&#8220; the boy replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;That'll have to do then,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Recite the Buddha's name and save me the trouble of having to teach you a sutra. Remember what I've told you as I'm going now.&#8221; Monkey then turned back into the tiniest of insects, squeezed out, flew back to beside the Tang Priest's ear, and said, &#8220;Master, say that there's a Buddhist monk inside.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This time we are certain to win,&#8221; replied Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you be so sure?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The sutras teach us that there are three treasures,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;the Buddha, the Dharma and the Clergy; so a monk must count as a treasure.&#8221;</P>
<P>As Sanzang was saying this the Great Immortal Tiger Power said, &#8220;Your Majesty, this third time there is a Taoist boy inside.&#8221; Tiger Power called and called but the boy would not come out. Sanzang then put his hands together and said, &#8220;There is a monk inside.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's a monk inside the chest,&#8221; shouted Pig at the top of his voice, at which the boy raised the lid of the chest with his head and stepped out, beating his wooden fish and repeating the name of the Buddha. The civil and military officials were so delighted that they all cheered; while the terrified Taoists were at a loss for words.</P>
<P>&#8220;This monk is being helped by gods and demons,&#8221; said the king. &#8220;How else could he have got into the chest as a Taoist boy and stepped out as a Buddhist monk? Even if a barber had got in with him he could only have shaved his head; but he's wearing a well-fitting habit and repeating the Buddha's name too. Teachers of the Nation, you must let those monks go.&#8221;</P>
<P>To this the Great Immortal Tiger Power replied, &#8220;Your Majesty, this is a case of a chess-player meeting his match, or a general coming up against a master strategist. We would like to try the martial arts we learned as boys in the Zhongnan Mountains against him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What martial arts?&#8221; the king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;We three brothers all have some divine powers,&#8221; Tiger Power replied. &#8220;We can put our head back on when they have been cut off; open up our chests, cut out our hearts, and make ourselves whole again; and take a bath in boiling oil.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But those are all certain death,&#8221; exclaimed the king in horror. &#8220;We have these powers,&#8221; said Tiger Power, &#8220;which is why I can give you a clear undertaking that we will not give up until we have been allowed a tournament with him.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey had just turned himself back into the tiniest of insects and gone over to investigate when he heard all this. Reverting to his real form he roared with laughter and said, &#8220;What luck, what marvellous luck. Business has brought itself to my front door.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But those are all ways of getting yourself killed,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;How can you talk about business coming to your front door?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You still don't know my powers,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;But all the transformations you can do are more than enough,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;You can't have powers like that too.&#8221;</P>
<P>To this Monkey said,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Cut off my head and I'll still go on talking,</P>
<P>Lop off my arms and I'll sock you another.</P>
<P>Chop off my legs and I'll carry on walking,</P>
<P>Carve up my guts and I'll put them together.</P>
<P>&#8220;When anyone makes a meat dumpling</P>
<P>I take it and down it in one.</P>
<P>To bath in hot oil is really quite nice,</P>
<P>A warm tub that makes all the dirt gone.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Pig and Friar Sand heard this they roared with laughter. Monkey then stepped forward and said, &#8220;Your Majesty, this humble monk can be beheaded.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean, you can be beheaded?&#8221; the king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;When I was cultivating my conduct in the monastery many years ago,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;a dhyana monk who came there taught me a method of being beheaded. I don't know if it's any good, and I'd like to try it out today.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That monk is too young to have any sense,&#8221; said the king with a smile. &#8220;Having your head cut off isn't something that you can try out for I fun. Your head is the chief of the Six Positives, and when it's cut off you're dead.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; said the Great Immortal Tiger Power, &#8220;this is just the way I want him to act so that we can get our revenge on him.&#8221; Believing him, the foolish monarch ordered that a place for public execution be prepared.</P>
<P>As soon as the order was given, three thousand men of the royal guard were drawn up outside the palace gates. &#8220;The monk shall be beheaded first,&#8221; said the king. Monkey cheerfully agreed: &#8220;I'll go first, I'll go first.&#8221;</P>
<P>Then he put his hands together and shouted, &#8220;Teacher of the Nation, I hope you'll forgive my effrontery in going first.&#8221; Monkey then turned round and went outside.</P>
<P>&#8220;Be careful, disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang, catching hold of him as he passed, &#8220;this is no place for fooling about.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What's there to be afraid of?&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Stop holding me; let me go.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Great Sage went straight to the execution ground, where the executioners grabbed him and tied him up so that he was like a ball. When he was placed high on the earthen mound a shout of &#8220;Behead him!&#8221; was heard, and his head was cut off as the sword whistled down. The executioners then kicked it and sent it rolling thirty or forty paces away like a ripe watermelon. No blood came from Monkey's throat as a shout of &#8220;Come here, head&#8221; rose from his stomach.</P>
<P>The Great Immortal Tiger Power was so appalled by this display of magical skill that he said a spell and ordered the local deity, &#8220;Hold on to that head. When I've beaten this monk I shall request His Majesty to rebuild your little shrine as a big temple and replace your clay statue with a gold one.&#8221; Now the local deity was under Tiger Power's control because Tiger Power had the five-thunder magic, so he held Monkey's head down.</P>
<P>&#8220;Come here, head,&#8221; Monkey called again, but his head was no more able to move than if it had taken root there. Monkey was now feeling anxious, so he made a spell with his hands, burst out of the ropes that were binding him, and shouted, &#8220;Grow!&#8221; In a flash another head grew on his neck, so terrifying the executioners and the soldiers of the guard army that they all shivered and shook.</P>
<P>The officer supervising the executions rushed into the palace to report, &#8220;Your Majesty, when the little monk's head was cut off he grew another one.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So that's another trick our brother can do,&#8221; said Pig to Friar Sand with a mocking laugh.</P>
<P>&#8220;As he can do seventy-two transformations,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;he has seventy-two heads.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before he had finished saying this Monkey came back and called, &#8220;Master!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Was it painful, disciple?&#8221; asked a greatly relieved Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;No, it wasn't painful,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;it was fun.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; asked Pig, &#8220;do you need sword-wound ointment?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Feel if there is a scar,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>The idiot put out his hand and said with a smile of wide-eyed astonishment, &#8220;Fantastic. It's completely whole&#8212;there's not even a scar.&#8221;</P>
<P>While the brother-disciples were congratulating each other they heard the king calling on them to take their passport and saying, &#8220;We grant you a full pardon. Go at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We accept the passport, but we insist that the Teacher of the Nation must be beheaded too to see what happens,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Senior Teacher of the Nation,&#8221; said the king, &#8220;that monk's not going to let you off. You promised to beat him, and don't give me another fright this time.&#8221; Tiger Power then had to take his turn to go to be tied up like a ball by the executioners and have his head cut off with a flash of the blade and sent rolling over thirty paces when it was kicked away.</P>
<P>No blood came from his throat either, and he too called out, &#8220;Come here, head.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey instantly pulled out a hair, blew a magic breath on it, said, &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned it into a brown dog that ran across the execution ground, picking the Taoist's head up with its teeth and dropping it into the palace moat.</P>
<P>The Taoist shouted three times but did not get his head to come back. As he did not have Monkey's art of growing a new one the red blood started to gush noisily from his neck.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>No use were his powers to call up wind and rain;</P>
<P>He could not compete with the true immortal again.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A moment later his body collapsed into the dust, and everyone could see that he was really a headless yellow-haired tiger</P>
<P>The officer supervising the executions then came to report, &#8220;Your Majesty, the Senior Teacher of the Nation has had his head cut off and cannot grow a new one. He is lying dead in the dust and is now a headless yellow-haired tiger.&#8221; This announcement made the king turn pale with shock. He stared at the other two Taoist masters, his eyes not moving.</P>
<P>Deer Power then rose to his feet and said, &#8220;My elder brother's life is now over, but he was no tiger. That monk in his wickedness must have used some deception magic to turn my elder brother into a beast. I will never forgive him for this, and am resolved to compete with him in opening the stomach and cutting out the heart.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the king heard this he pulled himself together and said, &#8220;Little monk, the Second Teacher of the Nation wants another competition with you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I hadn't had a cooked meal for ages,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;until the other day I was given a meal at a vegetarian's house on our journey West. I ate rather a lot of steamed bread, and my stomach has been aching recently. I think I must have worms, so I'd be glad to borrow Your Majesty's sword, cut my stomach open, take out my innards, and give my spleen and my stomach a good clean-out before going to the Western Heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the king heard this he said, &#8220;Take him to the place of execution.&#8221; A whole crowd of people fell upon Monkey, took hold of him, and began dragging him there. Monkey pulled his hands free and said, &#8220;No need to grab hold of me. I can walk there myself. There's just one condition: my hands mustn't be tied up as I will need them to wash my innards.&#8221; The king then ordered that his hands be left free.</P>
<P>Monkey walked with a swagger straight to the execution ground, where he leant against the stake, undid his clothes, and exposed his stomach. The executioners tied ropes round his neck and his legs, then made a quick cut in his stomach with a knife shaped like a cow's ear. This made a hole into which Monkey thrust both his hands to open it further as he brought out his entrails. He spent a long time checking them over carefully before putting them all back inside. Then he bent over again, pinched the skin of his stomach together, breathed a magic breath on it, called out, &#8220;Grow!&#8221; and made it join up again.</P>
<P>The king was so shocked that he gave Monkey the passport with his own hands, saying, &#8220;Here is your passport. Please don't let me delay you holy monks on your journey West any longer.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Never mind the passport,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;but what about asking the Second Teacher of the Nation to be cut open?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is nothing to do with me,&#8221; the king said to Deer Power.</P>
<P>&#8220;You wanted a match with him, and now you must go ahead.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry,&#8221; said Deer Power. &#8220;I cannot possibly lose to him.&#8221;</P>
<P>Watch him as he swaggers like the Great Sage Monkey to the execution ground to be tied up by the executioners and have his stomach cut open with a whistle of the cow's-ear knife. He too took out his entrails and sorted them out with his own hands. Monkey meanwhile pulled out one of his hairs, blew on it with a magic breath, shouted, &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned it into a hungry eagle that spread its wings, stretched out its claws, swooped down, grabbed the Taoist's internal organs, heart, liver and all, and flew off nobody knew where to devour them. The Taoist was</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Left as an empty, eviscerated ghost,</P>
<P>With no entrails or stomach as he wanders around lost.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The executioners kicked the wooden stake down and dragged the body over to look at it. To their surprise they found it was that of a white-haired deer.</P>
<P>The officer supervising the executions came to make another shocked report: &#8220;The Second Teacher of the Nation has met with disaster. He died when his stomach was cut open and a hungry eagle carried off all his entrails and internal organs in its claws. He turns out to have been a white-haired deer.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How could he have been a deer?&#8221; asked the king in terror. To this the Great Immortal Antelope Power submitted the following reply: &#8220;How could my elder brother possibly look like an animal after his death? This is all the result of that monk using magic to ruin us. Let me avenge my elder brother.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What magic arts do you have at which you might beat him?&#8221; the king asked. &#8220;I will compete with him at bathing in boiling oil,&#8221; Antelope Power replied. The king then ordered that a great cauldron be brought out and filled with sesame oil for the two of them to have their competition.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm most grateful for your consideration,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I haven't had a bath for a very long time, and these last couple of days my skin has begun to itch. I need a good, hot soak.&#8221;</P>
<P>The officials in attendance on the king then set the cauldron of oil in position, built up a pile of dry firewood, set it burning fiercely, and heated the oil till it boiled and bubbled. Monkey was told to go in first. He put his hands together in front of his chest and said, &#8220;Is it to be a gentle bath or a rough one?&#8221; When the king asked him what they were, Monkey replied, &#8220;For a gentle bath you keep your clothes on, stretch your hands wide out, do a roll and come up again without getting your clothes at all dirty. If there is even a spot of oil on them you have lost. For a rough bath you need a clothes rack and a wash towel. You take your clothes off, jump in and somersault or do dragonfly-stands as you play around and wash yourself.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do you want to compete with him at gentle baths or rough ones?&#8221; the king asked Antelope Power. &#8220;If it is gentle baths,&#8221; said Antelope Power, &#8220;he might have treated his clothes with some drug that will keep the oil off. Let it be rough baths then.&#8221; Monkey then stepped forward and said, &#8220;Excuse my impertinence in always going first.&#8221; Watch him while he takes off his tunic and tigerskin kilt, jumps into the cauldron, and dives through the waves, enjoying himself as much as if he were swimming in water.</P>
<P>At the sight of this Pig bit his finger and said to Friar Sand, &#8220;We've underestimated that Monkey. I usually say nasty things about him as if he just liked fooling about. I never realized he had powers like this.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey saw the two of them whispering his praises to each other, he thought suspiciously, &#8220;The idiot's mocking me again. How true it is that the clever have to do all the work and the clumsy stay idle. Here's me leaping around like this while he's standing there at his ease. Right, then. I'll get him tied up in knots and give him a real scare.&#8221; In the middle of washing himself he made a great splash and plunged down to the bottom of the cauldron where he turned himself into a jujube stone. He did not come up again.</P>
<P>The officer supervising the executions went up to the king and reported, &#8220;Your Majesty, the little monk has been fried to death in the boiling oil.&#8221; The king in his delight ordered that the bones be fished out for him to see. The executioners fetched an iron strainer on a long handle with which they fished around in the cauldron, but its mesh was so coarse that Monkey, who was now as small as a nail, kept slipping through the holes in it and they could not fish him out. They then reported that the monk was so small and his bones so soft that they had been fried right away.</P>
<P>&#8220;Arrest the three monks,&#8221; the king ordered. The guard officers in attendance grabbed Pig first as he looked dangerous, pushed him down, and tied him up with his hands behind his back. Sanzang was so terrified that he shouted, &#8220;Your Majesty, grand this poor monk a couple of hours' reprieve. My disciple achieved countless good deeds after he was converted. Today he has died in the cauldron of boiling oil because he offended Your Majesty. Those who die first become gods, and I am not greedy to stay alive. Indeed, those in authority in the world look after the world's people. If Your Majesty tell me to die, your subject will not dare disobey. I only ask you in your mercy to grant me a bowl of cold gruel and three paper horses that I can place in front of the cauldron. I would like to burn the paper as a mark of my feeling for my disciple, and I will then be ready to go to my execution.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the King. &#8220;What a fine sense of honour these Chinese have.&#8221; He then ordered that some gruel and yellow paper be given to the Tang Priest, which was done.</P>
<P>Sanzang told Friar Sand to come with him as the two of them went to the foot of the steps while several guard officers dragged Pig by his ears to the cauldron. Sanzang said this invocation before the cauldron: &#8220;Disciple Sun Wukong,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Since being ordained and then joining our order</P>
<P>You cared for and guarded me travelling West.</P>
<P>We hoped to complete our great journey together.</P>
<P>Who would have thought you would here to go rest?</P>
<P>Your life's only aim was collecting the scriptures,</P>
<P>And even when dead on the Buddha you ponder.</P>
<P>Now far, far away you true spirit is waiting;</P>
<P>As a ghost will you climb to the temple of Thunder.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Pig when he heard this, &#8220;there's no need for an invocation like that. Friar Sand, fetch me some gruel and I'll make an invocation.&#8221; Then the idiot said, snorting with anger as he lay tied up on the ground,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Trouble-making monkey,</P>
<P>Ignorant Protector of the Horses.</P>
<P>The monkey deserved to die,</P>
<P>The Protector had to fry.</P>
<P>The Monkey found it too hot,</P>
<P>The Protector's had his lot.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Monkey at the bottom of the cauldron heard the idiot abusing him like that he could not restrain himself from turning back into himself, standing up in the cauldron, and saying, &#8220;Dreg-guzzling moron! Who do you think you're swearing at?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang on seeing him, &#8220;you gave me a terrible fright.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Big Brother's used to shamming dead,&#8221; said Friar Sand. The civil and military officials were thrown into such a panic that they went forward to report to the king.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty, the monk did not die. He has just stood up in the cauldron.&#8221; The officer supervising the executions was afraid that he would be in trouble for having earlier made a false report to the king, so he submitted a new one: &#8220;The monk did die, but as this is an ill-omened day he has come back as a ghost to haunt us.&#8221;</P>
<P>This made Monkey so angry that he sprang out of the cauldron, wiped the oil off himself, put on his clothes, pulled out his cudgel, and hit the supervisor of the executions so hard that his head turned to a meatball. &#8220;A ghost, indeed,&#8221; he said, giving the officers such a fright that they untied Pig, fell to their knees, and pleaded, &#8220;Forgive us, forgive us.&#8221; As the king came down from his dragon throne Monkey went into the hall, seized hold of him, and said, &#8220;Don't go, Your Majesty. Make the Third Teacher of the Nation get into the cauldron of oil now.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Third Teacher of the Nation,&#8221; said the king with much trembling, &#8220;you must get into the cauldron at once to save my life.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't let the monk hit me.&#8221; Antelope Power then went down from the throne hall and like Monkey took off his clothes, jumped into the oil, and went through the motions of washing himself.</P>
<P>Monkey let the king go, went up to the cauldron, and told those tending the fire to add more fuel. Then he put out his hand to feel and found to his astonishment that the bubbling oil was icy cold.</P>
<P>&#8220;It was boiling hot when I had my bath,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;but it's cold for his. I'm sure that one of the dragon kings must be protecting him.&#8221; He leap straight up into midair, said the magic word<I> &#8220;Om,&#8221;</I> and summoned the Dragon King of the Northern Ocean.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll get you, you horned worm, you loach with scales on,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;How dare you help the Taoist by protecting the bottom of the cauldron as a cold dragon and letting him beat me in this display of divine powers!&#8221;</P>
<P>The dragon king was so frightened that he kept making respectful noises as he replied, &#8220;I'd never have dared help him. There is more to this than you realize, Great Sage. That evil beast has strenuously cultivated his conduct, shaken off his original shell, and has only really kept his five-thunder magic. In all other respects he has taken the path of heresy and could never return to the true Way. This is the 'Great Opening-up' that he learned on Lesser Mount Mao. The other two have already had their powers defeated by you, Great Sage, and reverted to their true appearances. The cold dragon this one uses is one that he created for himself, but it is only a trick with which to fool common mortals: it could not deceive you, Great Sage. I shall now take that cold dragon under my control, and guarantee that his skin and bones will now be fried to a crisp.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Hurry up about it if you don't want a beating,&#8221; said Monkey, at which the dragon king changed into a fierce gust of wind that seized the cold dragon and carried it off to the sea.</P>
<P>Monkey now came down to earth and stood beside Sanzang, Pig and Friar Sand in front of the throne hall watching the Taoist struggling without success to climb out of the boiling oil. Then the Taoist slipped back into the cauldron, and in an instant his bones came apart as his skin was fried crisp and his flesh cooked tender.</P>
<P>The official supervising the executions came in again to report, &#8220;Your Majesty, the Third Teacher of the Nation has been deep-fried to death.&#8221; The tears gushed from the king's eyes as he struck the table by the throne and cried aloud,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Hard is the gaining of life and hard is its end;</P>
<P>Elixir never refine without true instruction.</P>
<P>Vainly the spirits are raced and water-spells made;</P>
<P>Pills that can make you immortal are only a fiction.</P>
<P>Nirvana can never be won by a mind in disorder;</P>
<P>Cunning is useless when all it can cause is destruction.</P>
<P>Had I been warned that all could so easily fail,</P>
<P>I'd have kept to the diet and chosen a life of inaction.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>There was no use in the golden touch and in making elixir;</P>
<P>Calling up wind and summoning rain all ended in failure.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you do not know how the master and his disciples continued, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>外道弄强欺正法</p>
<p>心猿显圣灭诸邪</p>
</div>
<p>话说那国王见孙行者有呼龙使圣之法，即将关文用了宝印，便要递与唐僧，放行西路。那三个道士，慌得拜倒在金銮殿上启奏，那皇帝即下龙位，御手忙搀道：“国师今日行此大礼，何也？”道士说：“陛下，我等至此匡扶社稷，保国安民，苦历二十年来，今日这和尚弄法力，抓了功去，败了我们声名，陛下以一场之雨，就恕杀人之罪，可不轻了我等也？望陛下且留住他的关文，让我兄弟与他再赌一赌，看是何如。”那国王着实昏乱，东说向东，西说向西，真个收了关文道：“国师，你怎么与他赌？”虎力大仙道：“我与他赌坐禅。”国王道：“国师差矣，那和尚乃禅教出身，必然先会禅机，才敢奉旨求经，你怎与他赌此？”大仙道：“我这坐禅，比常不同，有一异名，教做云梯显圣。”国王道：“何为云梯显圣？”大仙道：“要一百张桌子，五十张作一禅台，一张一张迭将起去，不许手攀而上，亦不用梯凳而登，各驾一朵云头，上台坐下，约定几个时辰不动。”国王见此有些难处，就便传旨问道：“那和尚，我国师要与你赌云梯显圣坐禅，那个会么？”行者闻言，沉吟不答。八戒道：“哥哥，怎么不言语？”行者道：“兄弟，实不瞒你说，若是踢天弄井，搅海翻江，担山赶月，换斗移星，诸般巧事，我都干得；就是砍头剁脑，剖腹剜心，异样腾那，却也不怕。但说坐禅我就输了，我那里有这坐性？你就把我锁在铁柱子上，我也要上下爬蹅，莫想坐得住。”三藏忽的开言道：“我会坐禅。”行者欢喜道：“却好却好！</p>

<p>可坐得多少时？”三藏道：“我幼年遇方上禅僧讲道，那性命根本上，定性存神，在死生关里，也坐二三个年头。”行者道：“师父若坐二三年，我们就不取经罢。多也不上二三个时辰，就下来了。”三藏道：“徒弟呀，却是不能上去。”行者道：“你上前答应，我送你上去。”那长老果然合掌当胸道：“贫僧会坐禅。”国王教传旨立禅台。国家有倒山之力，不消半个时辰，就设起两座台，在金銮殿左右。</p>

<p>那虎力大仙下殿，立于阶心，将身一纵，踏一朵席云，径上西边台上坐下。行者拔一根毫毛，变做假象，陪着八戒沙僧立于下面，他却作五色祥云，把唐僧撮起空中，径至东边台上坐下。他又敛祥光，变作一个蟭蟟虫，飞在八戒耳朵边道：“兄弟，仔细看着师父，再莫与老孙替身说话。”那呆子笑道：“理会得！</p>

<p>理会得！”却说那鹿力大仙在绣墩上坐看多时，他两个在高台上，不分胜负，这道士就助他师兄一功：将脑后短发，拔了一根，捻着一团，弹将上去，径至唐僧头上，变作一个大臭虫，咬住长老。那长老先前觉痒，然后觉疼。原来坐禅的不许动手，动手算输，一时间疼痛难禁，他缩着头，就着衣襟擦痒。八戒道：“不好了！师父羊儿风发了。”沙僧道：“不是，是头风发了。”</p>

<p>行者听见道：“我师父乃志诚君子，他说会坐禅，断然会坐，说不会，只是不会。君子家，岂有谬乎？你两个休言，等我上去看看。”好行者，嘤的一声，飞在唐僧头上，只见有豆粒大小一个臭虫叮他师父，慌忙用手捻下，替师父挠挠摸摸。那长老不疼不痒，端坐上面。行者暗想道：“和尚头光，虱子也安不得一个，如何有此臭虫？想是那道士弄的玄虚，害我师父。哈哈！枉自也不见输赢，等老孙去弄他一弄！”这行者飞将去，金殿兽头上落下，摇身一变，变作一条七寸长的蜈蚣，径来道士鼻凹里叮了一下。那道士坐不稳，一个筋斗翻将下去，几乎丧了性命，幸亏大小官员人多救起。国王大惊，即着当驾太师领他往文华殿里梳洗去了。行者仍驾祥云，将师父驮下阶前，已是长老得胜。</p>

<p>那国王只教放行，鹿力大仙又奏道：“陛下，我师兄原有暗风疾，因到了高处；冒了天风，旧疾举发，故令和尚得胜。且留下他，等我与他赌隔板猜枚。国王道：“怎么叫做隔板猜枚？”鹿力道：“贫道有隔板知物之法；看那和尚可能彀。他若猜得过我，让他出去；猜不着，凭陛下问拟罪名，雪我昆仲之恨，不污了二十年保国之恩也。”真个那国王十分昏乱，依此谗言。即传旨，将一朱红漆的柜子，命内官抬到宫殿，教娘娘放上件宝贝。</p>

<p>须臾抬出，放在白玉阶前，教僧道：“你两家各赌法力，猜那柜中是何宝贝。”三藏道：“徒弟，柜中之物，如何得知？”行者敛祥光，还变作蟭蟟虫，钉在唐僧头上道：“师父放心，等我去看看来。”好大圣，轻轻飞到柜上，爬在那柜脚之下，见有一条板缝儿。他钻将进去，见一个红漆丹盘，内放一套宫衣，乃是山河社稷袄，乾坤地理裙。用手拿起来，抖乱了，咬破舌尖上，一口血哨喷将去，叫声“变”！即变作一件破烂流丢一口钟，临行又撒上一泡臊溺，却还从板缝里钻出来，飞在唐僧耳朵上道：“师父，你只猜是破烂流丢一口钟。”三藏道：“他教猜宝贝哩，流丢是件甚宝贝？”行者道：“莫管他，只猜着便是。”唐僧进前一步正要猜，那鹿力大仙道：“我先猜，那柜里是山河社稷袄，乾坤地理裙。”唐僧道：“不是，不是，柜里是件破烂流丢一口钟。”国王道：“这和尚无礼！敢笑我国中无宝，猜甚么流丢一口钟！”</p>

<p>教：“拿了！”那两班校尉，就要动手，慌得唐僧合掌高呼：“陛下，且赦贫僧一时，待打开柜看。端的是宝，贫僧领罪；如不是宝，却不屈了贫僧也？”国王教打开看。当驾官即开了，捧出丹盘来看，果然是件破烂流丢一口钟。国王大怒道：“是谁放上此物？”龙座后面，闪上三宫皇后道：“我主，是梓童亲手放的山河社稷袄，乾坤地理裙，却不知怎么变成此物。”国王道：“御妻请退，寡人知之。宫中所用之物，无非是缎绢绫罗，那有此甚么流丢？”教：“抬上柜来，等朕亲藏一宝贝，再试如何。”</p>

<p>那皇帝即转后宫，把御花园里仙桃树上结得一个大桃子，有碗来大小，摘下放在柜内，又抬下叫猜。唐僧道：“徒弟啊，又来猜了。”行者道：“放心，等我再去看看。”又嘤的一声飞将去，还从板缝儿钻进去，见是一个桃子，正合他意，即现了原身，坐在柜里，将桃子一顿口啃得干干净净，连两边腮凹儿都啃净了，将核儿安在里面。仍变蟭蟟虫，飞将出去，钉在唐僧耳朵上道：“师父，只猜是个桃核子。”长老道：“徒弟啊，休要弄我。先前不是口快，几乎拿去典刑。这番须猜宝贝方好，桃核子是甚宝贝？”行者道：“休怕，只管赢他便了。”三藏正要开言，听得那羊力大仙道：“贫道先猜，是一颗仙桃。”三藏猜道：“不是桃，是个光桃核子。”那国王喝道：“是朕放的仙桃，如何是核？三国师猜着了。”三藏道：“陛下，打开来看就是。”当驾官又抬上去打开，捧出丹盘，果然是一个核子，皮肉俱无。国王见了，心惊道：</p>

<p>“国师，休与他赌斗了，让他去罢。寡人亲手藏的仙桃，如今只是一核子，是甚人吃了？想是有鬼神暗助他也。”八戒听说，与沙僧微微冷笑道：“还不知他是会吃桃子的积年哩！”</p>

<p>正话间，只见那虎力大仙从文华殿梳洗了，走上殿前：“陛下，这和尚有搬运抵物之术，抬上柜来，我破他术法，与他再猜。”国王道：“国师还要猜甚？”虎力道：“术法只抵得物件，却抵不得人身。将这道童藏在里面，管教他抵换不得。”这小童果藏在柜里，掩上柜盖，抬将下去，教：“那和尚再猜，这三番是甚宝贝。”三藏道：“又来了！”行者道：“等我再去看看。”嘤的又飞去，钻入里面，见是一个小童儿。好大圣，他却有见识，果然是腾那天下少，似这伶俐世间稀！他就摇身一变，变作个老道士一般容貌，进柜里叫声“徒弟。”童儿道：“师父，你从那里来的？”行者道：“我使遁法来的。”童儿道：“你来有么教诲？”行者道：“那和尚看见你进柜来了，他若猜个道童，却不又输了？是特来和你计较计较，剃了头，我们猜和尚罢。”童儿道：“但凭师父处治，只要我们赢他便了。若是再输与他，不但低了声名，又恐朝廷不敬重了。”行者道：“说得是。我儿过来，赢了他，我重重赏你。”将金箍棒就变作一把剃头刀，搂抱着那童儿，口里叫道：“乖乖，忍着疼，莫放声，等我与你剃头。”须臾剃下发来，窝作一团，塞在那柜脚纥络里，收了刀儿，摸着他的光头道：“我儿，头便象个和尚，只是衣裳不趁。脱下来，我与你变一变。”那道童穿的一领葱白色云头花绢绣锦沿边的鹤氅，真个脱下来，被行者吹一口仙气，叫“变！”即变做一件土黄色的直裰儿，与他穿了。却又拔下两根毫毛，变作一个木鱼儿，递在他手里道：</p>

<p>“徒弟，须听着，但叫道童，千万莫出去；若叫和尚，你就与我顶开柜盖，敲着木鱼，念一卷佛经钻出来，方得成功也。”童儿道：</p>

<p>“我只会念《三官经》、《北斗经》、《消灾经》，不会念佛家经。”行者道：“你可会念佛？”童儿道：“阿弥陀佛，那个不会念？”行者道：“也罢也罢，就念佛，省得我又教你。切记着，我去也。”还变蟭蟟虫，钻出去，飞在唐僧耳轮边道：“师父，你只猜是个和尚。”三藏道：“这番他准赢了。”行者道：“你怎么定得？”三藏道：“经上有云，佛、法、僧三宝。和尚却也是一宝。”正说处，只见那虎力大仙道：“陛下，第三番是个道童。”只管叫，他那里肯出来。三藏合掌道：“是个和尚。”八戒尽力高叫道：“柜里是个和尚！”那童儿忽的顶开柜盖，敲着木鱼，念着佛，钻出来。喜得那两班文武，齐声喝采：唬得那三个道士，拑口无言。国王道：</p>

<p>“这和尚是有鬼神辅佐！怎么道士入柜，就变做和尚？纵有待诏跟进去，也只剃得头便了，如何衣服也能趁体，口里又会念佛？国师啊！让他去罢！”</p>

<p>虎力大仙道：“陛下，左右是棋逢对手，将遇良材。贫道将锺南山幼时学的武艺，索性与他赌一赌。”国王道：“有甚么武艺？”虎力道：“弟兄三个，都有些神通。会砍下头来，又能安上；</p>

<p>剖腹剜心，还再长完；滚油锅里，又能洗澡。”国王大惊道：“此三事都是寻死之路！”虎力道：“我等有此法力，才敢出此朗言，断要与他赌个才休。”那国王叫道：“东土的和尚，我国师不肯放你，还要与你赌砍头剖腹，下滚油锅洗澡哩。”行者正变作蟭蟟虫，往来报事，忽听此言，即收了毫毛，现出本相，哈哈大笑道：“造化！造化！买卖上门了！”八戒道：“这三件都是丧性命的事，怎么说买卖上门？”行者道：“你还不知我的本事。”八戒道：“哥哥，你只象这等变化腾那也彀了，怎么还有这等本事？”</p>

<p>行者道：“我啊，砍下头来能说话，剁了臂膊打得人。扎去腿脚会走路，剖腹还平妙绝伦。就似人家包匾食，一捻一个就囫囵。</p>

<p>油锅洗澡更容易，只当温汤涤垢尘。”八戒沙僧闻言，呵呵大笑。行者上前道：“陛下，小和尚会砍头。”国王道：“你怎么会砍头？”行者道：“我当年在寺里修行，曾遇着一个方上禅和子，教我一个砍头法，不知好也不好，如今且试试新。”国王笑道：“那和尚年幼不知事，砍头那里好试新？头乃六阳之首，砍下即便死矣。”虎力道：“陛下，正要他如此，方才出得我们之气。”那昏君信他言语，即传旨，教设杀场。</p>

<p>一声传旨，即有羽林军三千，摆列朝门之外。国王教：“和尚先去砍头。”行者欣然应道：“我先去！我先去！”拱着手，高呼道：“国师，恕大胆占先了。”拽回头，往外就走。唐僧一把扯住道：“徒弟呀，仔细些，那里不是耍处。”行者道：“怕他怎的！撒了手，等我去来。”那大圣径至杀场里面，被刽子手挝住了，捆做一团，按在那土墩高处，只听喊一声“开刀！”飕的把个头砍将下来，又被刽子手一脚踢了去，好似滚西瓜一般，滚有三四十步远近。行者腔子中更不出血，只听得肚里叫声：“头来！”慌得鹿力大仙见有这般手段，即念咒语，教本坊土地神祇：“将人头扯住，待我赢了和尚，奏了国王，与你把小祠堂盖作大庙宇，泥塑像改作正金身。”原来那些土地神祇因他有五雷法，也服他使唤，暗中真个把行者头按住了。行者又叫声：“头来！”那头一似生根，莫想得动。行者心焦，捻着拳，挣了一挣，将捆的绳子就皆挣断，喝声：“长！”飕的腔子内长出一个头来。唬得那刽子手，个个心惊；羽林军，人人胆战。那监斩官急走入朝奏道：</p>

<p>“万岁，那小和尚砍了头，又长出一颗来了。”八戒冷笑道：“沙僧，那知哥哥还有这般手段。”沙僧道：“他有七十二般变化，就有七十二个头哩。”说不了，行者走来叫声“师父。”三藏大喜道：“徒弟，辛苦么？”行者道：“不辛苦，倒好耍子。”八戒道：“哥哥，可用刀疮药么？”行者道：“你是摸摸看，可有刀痕？”那呆子伸手一摸，就笑得呆呆睁睁道：“妙哉！妙哉！却也长得完全，截疤儿也没些儿！”</p>

<p>兄弟们正都欢喜，又听得国王叫领关文：“赦你无罪！快去！快去！”行者道：“关文虽领，必须国师也赴曹砍砍头，也当试新去来。”国王道：“大国师，那和尚也不肯放你哩。你与他赌胜，且莫唬了寡人。”虎力也只得去，被几个刽子手，也捆翻在地，幌一幌，把头砍下，一脚也踢将去，滚了有三十余步，他腔子里也不出血，也叫一声：“头来！”行者即忙拔下一根毫毛，吹口仙气，叫“变！”变作一条黄犬跑入场中，把那道士头一口衔来，径跑到御水河边丢下不题。却说那道士连叫三声，人头不到，怎似行者的手段，长不出来，腔子中骨都都红光迸出，可怜空有唤雨呼风法，怎比长生果正仙？须臾倒在尘埃，众人观看，乃是一只无头的黄毛虎。那监斩官又来奏：“万岁，大国师砍下头来，不能长出，死在尘埃，是一只无头的黄毛虎。”国王闻奏，大惊失色，目不转睛，看那两个道士。鹿力起身道：“我师兄已是命到禄绝了，如何是只黄虎！这都是那和尚惫懒，使的掩样法儿，将我师兄变作畜类！我今定不饶他，定要与他赌那剖腹剜心！”</p>

<p>国王听说，方才定性回神，又叫：“那和尚，二国师还要与你赌哩。”行者道：“小和尚久不吃烟火食，前日西来，忽遇斋公家劝饭，多吃了几个馍馍，这几日腹中作痛，想是生虫，正欲借陛下之刀，剖开肚皮，拿出脏腑，洗净脾胃，方好上西天见佛。”</p>

<p>国王听说，教：“拿他赴曹。”那许多人搀的搀，扯的扯。行者展脱手道：“不用人搀，自家走去。但一件，不许缚手，我好用手洗刷脏腑。”国王传旨，教：“莫绑他手。”行者摇摇摆摆，径至杀场，将身靠着大桩，解开衣带，露出肚腹。那刽子手将一条绳套在他膊项上，一条绳札住他腿足，把一口牛耳短刀，幌一幌，着肚皮下一割，搠个窟窿。这行者双手爬开肚腹，拿出肠脏来，一条条理彀多时，依然安在里面，照旧盘曲，捻着肚皮，吹口仙气，叫“长！”依然长合。国王大惊，将他那关文捧在手中道：“圣僧莫误西行，与你关文去罢。”行者笑道：“关文小可，也请二国师剖剖剜剜，何如？”国王对鹿力说：“这事不与寡人相干，是你要与他做对头的，请去，请去。”鹿力道：“宽心，料我决不输与他。”你看他也象孙大圣，摇摇摆摆，径入杀场，被刽子手套上绳，将牛耳短刀，唿喇的一声，割开肚腹，他也拿出肝肠，用手理弄。行者即拔一根毫毛，吹口仙气，叫“变！”即变作一只饿鹰，展开翅爪，飕的把他五脏心肝，尽情抓去，不知飞向何方受用。这道士弄做一个空腔破肚淋漓鬼，少脏无肠浪荡魂。那刽子手蹬倒大桩，拖尸来看，呀！原来是一只白毛角鹿！</p>

<p>慌得那监斩官又来奏道：“二国师晦气，正剖腹时，被一只饿鹰将脏腑肝肠都刁去了。死在那里，原身是个白毛角鹿也。”</p>

<p>国王害怕道：“怎么是个角鹿？”那羊力大仙又奏道：“我师兄既死，如何得现兽形？这都是那和尚弄术法坐害我等。等我与师兄报仇者。”国王道：“你有甚么法力赢他？”羊力道：“我与他赌下滚油锅洗澡。”国王便教取一口大锅，满着香油，教他两个赌去。行者道：“多承下顾，小和尚一向不曾洗澡，这两日皮肤燥痒，好歹荡荡去。”那当驾官果安下油锅，架起干柴，燃着烈火，将油烧滚，教和尚先下去。”行者合掌道：“不知文洗，武洗？”国王道：“文洗如何？武洗如何？”行者道：“文洗不脱衣服，似这般叉着手，下去打个滚，就起来，不许污坏了衣服，若有一点油腻算输。武洗要取一张衣架，一条手巾，脱了衣服，跳将下去，任意翻筋斗，竖蜻蜓，当耍子洗也。”国王对羊力说：“你要与他文洗，武洗？”羊力道：“文洗恐他衣服是药炼过的，隔油，武洗罢。”行者又上前道：“恕大胆，屡次占先了。”你看他脱了布直裰，褪了虎皮裙，将身一纵，跳在锅内，翻波斗浪，就似负水一般顽耍。八戒见了，咬着指头，对沙僧道：“我们也错看了这猴子了！平时间劖言讪语，斗他耍子，怎知他有这般真实本事！”</p>

<p>他两个唧唧哝哝，夸奖不尽。行者望见，心疑道：“那呆子笑我哩！正是巧者多劳拙者闲，老孙这般舞弄，他倒自在。等我作成他捆一绳，看他可怕。”正洗浴，打个水花，淬在油锅底上，变作个枣核钉儿，再也不起来了。那监斩官近前又奏：“万岁，小和尚被滚油烹死了。”国王大喜，教捞上骨骸来看。刽子手将一把铁笊篱，在油锅里捞，原来那笊篱眼稀，行者变得钉小，往往来来，从眼孔漏下去了，那里捞得着！又奏道：“和尚身微骨嫩，俱札化了。”国王教：“拿三个和尚下去！”两边校尉，见八戒面凶，先揪翻，把背心捆了，慌得三藏高叫：“陛下，赦贫僧一时。</p>

<p>我那个徒弟，自从归教，历历有功，今日冲撞国师，死在油锅之内，奈何先死者为神，我贫僧怎敢贪生！正是天下官员也管着天下百姓，陛下若教臣死，臣岂敢不死？只望宽恩，赐我半盏凉浆水饭，三张纸马，容到油锅边，烧此一陌纸，也表我师徒一念，那时再领罪也。”国王闻言道：“也是，那中华人多有义气。”</p>

<p>命取些浆饭、黄钱与他。果然取了，递与唐僧。唐僧教沙和尚同去，行至阶下，有几个校尉，把八戒揪着耳朵，拉在锅边，三藏对锅祝曰：“徒弟孙悟空！自从受戒拜禅林，护我西来恩爱深。指望同时成大道，何期今日你归阴！生前只为求经意，死后还存念佛心。万里英魂须等候，幽冥做鬼上雷音！”八戒听见道：“师父，不是这般祝了。沙和尚，你替我奠浆饭，等我祷。”那呆子捆在地下，气呼呼的道：“闯祸的泼猴子，无知的弼马温！</p>

<p>该死的泼猴子，油烹的弼马温！猴儿了帐，马温断根！”</p>

<p>孙行者在油锅底上听得那呆子乱骂，忍不住现了本相，赤淋淋的，站在油锅底道：“馕糟的夯货！你骂那个哩！”唐僧见了道：“徒弟，唬杀我也！”沙僧道：“大哥干净推佯死惯了！”慌得那两班文武，上前来奏道：“万岁，那和尚不曾死，又打油锅里钻出来了。”监斩官恐怕虚诳朝廷，却又奏道：“死是死了，只是日期犯凶，小和尚来显魂哩。”行者闻言大怒，跳出锅来，揩了油腻，穿上衣服，掣出棒，挝过监斩官，着头一下打做了肉团，道：“我显甚么魂哩！”唬得多官连忙解了八戒，跪地哀告：“恕罪！恕罪！”国王走下龙座。行者上殿扯住道：“陛下不要走，且教你三国师也下下油锅去。”那皇帝战战兢兢道：“三国师，你救朕之命，快下锅去，莫教和尚打我。”</p>

<p>羊力下殿，照依行者脱了衣服，跳下油锅，也那般支吾洗浴。行者放了国王，近油锅边，叫烧火的添柴，却伸手探了一把，呀！那滚油都冰冷，心中暗想道：“我洗时滚热，他洗时却冷。我晓得了，这不知是那个龙王，在此护持他哩。”急纵身跳在空中，念声“唵”字咒语，把那北海龙王唤来：“我把你这个带角的蚯蚓，有鳞的泥鳅！你怎么助道士冷龙护住锅底，教他显圣赢我！”唬得那龙王喏喏连声道：“敖顺不敢相助。大圣原来不知，这个孽畜苦修行了一场，脱得本壳，却只是五雷法真受，其余都躧了旁门，难归仙道。这个是他在小茅山学来的大开剥。那两个已是大圣破了他法，现了本相，这一个也是他自己炼的冷龙，只好哄瞒世俗之人耍子，怎瞒得大圣！小龙如今收了他冷龙，管教他骨碎皮焦，显什么手段。”行者道：“趁早收了，免打！”那龙王化一阵旋风，到油锅边，将冷龙捉下海去不题。</p>

<p>行者下来，与三藏、八戒、沙僧立在殿前，见那道士在滚油锅里打挣，爬不出来，滑了一跌，霎时间骨脱皮焦肉烂。监斩官又来奏道：“万岁，三国师煠化了也。”那国王满眼垂泪，手扑着御案，放声大哭道：“人身难得果然难，不遇真传莫炼丹。空有驱神咒水术，却无延寿保生丸。圆明混，怎涅槃，徒用心机命不安。早觉这般轻折挫，何如秘食稳居山！”这正是：点金炼汞成何济，唤雨呼风总是空！毕竟不知师徒们怎的维持，且听下回分解。</p>
