<P>The Power of Heterodoxy Oppresses the True Nature</P>
<P>The Mind-Ape Wins the Treasures and Beats the Demons</P>
</div>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Lucid the true nature; the Way explains itself;</P>
<P>With one turn one jumps out of the net.</P>
<P>To learn transformations is very hard indeed;</P>
<P>To become immortal is no common deed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Pure yields to foul and foul to pure as fate's wheel turns:</P>
<P>Break through the kalpas and travel freely.</P>
<P>Wander at will through countless billion years,</P>
<P>A spot of sacred light ever shining in the void.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This poem is an apt but indirect description of how wonderful the Great Sage's powers were. Now that he had won the demons' treasure and had it tucked into his sleeve he thought with delight, &#8220;The damned demon went to such a lot of trouble to capture me, but it was, as they say, like trying to fish the moon out of water. But for me to try to capture you would be like melting ice on a fire.&#8221;</P>
<P>Concealing the gourd about him he slipped outside, reverted to his own form, and shouted at the top of his voice, &#8220;Open up, you devils.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Who do you think you are, shouting like that?&#8221; asked the devils who were there.</P>
<P>&#8220;Tell your damned demon kings at once that Novice the Sun is here,&#8221; he replied.</P>
<P>The demons rushed in to report, &#8220;Your Majesties, there's a Novice the Sun or something at the doors.&#8221; The Senior King was shocked.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is terrible, brother,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We've stirred up a whole nest of them. Sun the Novice is tied up with the Dazzling Golden Cord, and the Novice Sun is inside the gourd, so how can there be a Novice the Sun as well? They must all be brothers and all have come.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry, brother,&#8221; the Junior King replied. &#8220;I can put a thousand people into my gourd, and at present I've only got the Novice Sun inside. No need to be afraid of Novice the Sun or whoever. I'm going out to take a look and put him inside too.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do be careful,&#8221; said the Senior Demon King.</P>
<P>Watch as the Junior King goes out through the doors with his gourd, as heroic and impressive as the previous time.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you from?&#8221; he shouted at the top of his voice, &#8220;and how dare you rant and roar here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't you know who I am?&#8221; Monkey said.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;My home is on the Mount of Flowers and Fruit;</P>
<P>Long have we lived in Water Curtain Cave.</P>
<P>For making havoc in the Heavenly Palace</P>
<P>For ages did I rest from war and strife.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Since my delivery from woe,</P>
<P>I've left the Way and now I serve a monk.</P>
<P>As a believer I go to Thunder Shrine</P>
<P>To seek the Scriptures and come back to Truth.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Now that I've met with you damned fiends,</P>
<P>All of my magic powers I've had to use.</P>
<P>Give back to us the priest who's come from Tang,</P>
<P>To travel West and visit the Lord Buddha.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The rival sides have fought for long enough:</P>
<P>Let all of us now live in peace together.</P>
<P>Don't make old Monkey lose his fiery temper,</P>
<P>For if he does he'll surely wipe you out&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Come here,&#8221; said the demon. &#8220;I won't hit you. I'll just call your name. Will you answer?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you call my name,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;I'll reply. But will you answer if I call your name?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If I call you,&#8221; said the demon, &#8220;I have a miraculous gourd that people can be packed into. But if you call me, what have you got?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've got a gourd too,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you have, then show me,&#8221; said the demon.</P>
<P>Monkey then produced the gourd from his sleeve and said, &#8220;Look, damned demon.&#8221; He flourished it then put it back in his sleeve in case the demon tried to snatch it.</P>
<P>The sight was a great shock to the demon. &#8220;Where did he get his gourd?&#8221; he wondered. &#8220;Why is it just like mine? Even gourds from the same vine are different sizes and shapes. But that one is identical.&#8221; He then shouted angrily at Monkey, &#8220;Novice the Sun, where did you get your gourd?&#8221;</P>
<P>As Monkey really did not know where it was from he answered with another question: &#8220;Where did you get yours?&#8221;</P>
<P>Not realizing that this was a trick Monkey had learned from experience, the demon told the true story from the beginning: &#8220;When Chaos was first divided and heaven separated from earth there was this Lord Lao Zi who took the name of the Goddess Nuwa to smelt a stone to mend the heavens and save the Continent of Jambu. When he put in the missing part of the Heavenly Palace he noticed a magic vine at the foot of Mount Kunlun on which this gold and red gourd was growing. It has been handed down from Lord Lao Zi to the present day.&#8221;</P>
<P>Hearing this, Monkey carried on in the same vein: &#8220;That's where my gourd came from too.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you tell?&#8221; the demon king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;When the pure and the coarse were first divided,&#8221; the Great Sage replied, &#8220;heaven was incomplete in the Northwest corner, and part of the earth was missing to the Southeast. So the Great Taoist Patriarch turned himself into Nuwa to mend the sky. As he passed Mount Kunlun there was a magic vine with two gourds growing on it. The one I've got is the male one, and yours is the female one.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Never mind about the sex,&#8221; said the demon. &#8220;It's only a real treasure if it can hold people inside.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Quite right,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;You try to put me inside first.&#8221;</P>
<P>The overjoyed demon sprang into mid-air with a bound, held out his gourd, and called, &#8220;Novice the Sun.&#8221; Without hesitation the Great Sage replied eight or nine times, but he was not sucked inside. The monster came down, stamping his feet, pounding his chest, and exclaiming, &#8220;Heavens! Who said that the world never changes? This treasure's scared of its old man! The female one hasn't the nerve to pack the male inside.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Put your gourd away now,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;It's my turn to call your name.&#8221; With a fast somersault he leapt up, turned his gourd upside-down with its mouth facing the demon, and called, &#8220;Great King Silver Horn.&#8221; The demon could not keep quiet; he had to answer, and he went whistling into the gourd. Monkey then attached a label reading:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>To the Great Lord Lao: to be dealt with urgently in accordance with the Statutes and Ordinances.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Well, my boy,&#8221; he thought with pleasure, &#8220;today you've tried something new.&#8221;</P>
<P>He landed his cloud, still carrying the gourd. His only thought was to rescue his master as he headed for the Lotus Flower Cave. The mountain path was most uneven, and he was besides bow-legged, so as he lurched along the gourd was shaken, making a continuous sloshing sound. Do you know why this was? The Great Sage's body had been so thoroughly tempered that he could not be putrefied in a hurry. The monster, on the other hand, though able to ride the clouds only had certain magical powers. His body was still essentially that of an ordinary mortal, which putrefied as soon as it went into the gourd.</P>
<P>Not believing that the demon had already turned to pus, Monkey joked, &#8220;I don't know whether that's piss or saliva, my lord, but I've played that game too. I won't take the cover off for another seven or eight days, by when you'll have turned to liquid. What's the hurry? What's so urgent? When I think how easily I escaped you deserve to be out of sight for a thousand years.&#8221; As he was carrying the gourd and talking like this he was back at the doors of the cave before he realized it. He shook the gourd, and it kept making that noise.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's like a fortune-telling tube that you shake a stick out of,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;I'll do one and see when the Master will be coming out.&#8221; Watch him as he shakes and shakes it, repeating over and over again the spell, &#8220;King Wen's Book of Changes, Confucius the Sage, Lady of the Peach Blossom, Master Ghostvalley.&#8221;</P>
<P>When they saw him the little devils in the cave said, &#8220;Disaster, Your Majesty. Novice the Sun has put his Junior Majesty in the gourd and is shaking it.&#8221; The news sent all the Senior King's souls flying and turned his bones and sinews soft.</P>
<P>He collapsed, howling aloud, &#8220;You and I sneaked out of the world above to be reborn among mortals, brother. Our hope was to share glory for ever as rulers of this cave. We never dreamt that this monk would kill you and part us.&#8221; All the devils in the cave wept and wailed.</P>
<P>The sound of all this howling was too much for Pig hanging from his beam. &#8220;Stop howling, demon,&#8221; he could not help himself shouting, &#8220;and listen to me. Sun the Novice who came first, the Novice Sun who came next, and Novice the Sun who came last all have the same name shuffled around, and they are all my fellow disciple. He can do seventy-two transformations. He got in here by changing, stole your treasure and put your brother inside it. Now that he's dead there's no need for all this misery. Have your cooking pots scrubbed clean and cook some gill mushrooms and button mushrooms, tea shoots, bamboo shoots, beancurd, gluten, tree-fungus, and vegetables. Then you can invite my master, my fellow-disciple and me down to say a<I> Life Sutra</I> for your brother.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I thought Pig was well-behaved,&#8221; roared the demon king in fury, &#8220;but he most certainly is not, mocking me like that.&#8221; He then called on the little devils, &#8220;Stop wailing, and let Pig down. Cook him till he's nice and tender, and when I've had made a good meal of him I'll go out and take my revenge on Sun the Novice.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wonderful,&#8221; grumbled Friar Sand at Pig. &#8220;I told you to keep your mouth shut. Your reward for blabbing will be to be cooked first.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot was quite frightened by now. A little devil standing beside him said, &#8220;Your Majesty, Pig will be hard to cook.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Thank heavens,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;Is this brother winning himself some merit? It's true I wouldn't cook well.&#8221;</P>
<P>Then another little devil said, &#8220;He'll cook if he's skinned first.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Pig in desperation, &#8220;I'll cook. My skin and bones may be coarse, but they'll boil tender. I'm done for! I'm done for.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before Pig had finished shouting a little devil came in from outside to report that Novice the Sun was there again and being very abusive.</P>
<P>&#8220;Damn him. He thinks we're completely useless,&#8221; exclaimed the Senior Demon King with horror. &#8220;Hang Pig up again,&#8221; he told the little demons, &#8220;and check what treasures we have left.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We still have three in the cave,&#8221; reported the steward devil.</P>
<P>&#8220;Which three?&#8221; the demon king asked. &#8220;The Seven-star Sword, the Plantain Fan, and the Pure Vase,&#8221; replied the steward.</P>
<P>&#8220;The vase is useless,&#8221; said the demon king. &#8220;All you used to need to do was to call someone's name and get a reply for them to be put inside. But now Sun the Novice has learned the words of the spell and put my brother in it. We won't need that&#8212;leave it here. Fetch me the sword and the fan at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>The steward immediately fetched them for the old demon, who tucked the fan inside the back of his collar and took the sword in his hand. Then he mustered all three hundred or more of his devils and drilled them in the use of spear, staff, rope and sword. The Senior Demon King then put on his helmet and breast plate, over which he threw a cloak of fiery red silk. The demons fell into battle formation, ready to capture the Great Sage Sun. The Great Sage meanwhile, now aware that the Junior Demon King had rotted down inside the gourd, tied it up very tight and fastened it to his belt, then prepared to fight, his gold-banded cudgel in his hand. The old demon, his red battle-flag unfurled behind him, leapt out through the doors of the cave. This was how he was dressed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Dazzling bright the tassels on his helmet,</P>
<P>Brilliantly coloured the belt at his waist.</P>
<P>The armor he wore was made of dragon scales,</P>
<P>Covered with a cloak of burning fire.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Lightning flashed from his glaring eyes,</P>
<P>Smoke curled up from his bristles of steel.</P>
<P>Lightly he lifted the Seven-star Sword,</P>
<P>His shoulders covered by the Plantain Fan.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He moved like clouds drifting from an island,</P>
<P>Sounded like thunderbolts shaking the mountains.</P>
<P>His mighty prowess would oppress Heaven's warriors</P>
<P>As he wrathfully led his devils from the cave.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He ordered the little devils into battle positions at once, then started hurling abuse: &#8220;Thoroughly ill-mannered ape. You've murdered my brother and ruined our fraternal love. You're utterly loathsome.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Detestable monster,&#8221; replied Monkey in kind. &#8220;You hang on to your devilish life for all you're worth, but how do you expect me to stand for my master, my fellow-disciples and horse all being hung up in your cave for no good reason at all? It's intolerable. Hand them over to me this moment and throw in some generous travelling expenses. Then I'll cheerfully be on my way and spare your rotten life.&#8221; With no more ado the demon lifted his sword and struck at Monkey's head, while Monkey raised his iron cudgel to meet him. It was a fine battle they fought outside the gates. Indeed!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Gold-Banded Cudgel and the Seven-star Sword,</P>
<P>Flashing like lightning as they meet.</P>
<P>The chill wind from them makes one cold,</P>
<P>While mighty banks of cloud blot out the ridges.</P>
<P>One, moved by brotherly love,</P>
<P>Would do no act of kindness;</P>
<P>The other, out to save the pilgrim,</P>
<P>Showed no touch of mercy.</P>
<P>The two sides seethed with equal hatred,</P>
<P>Each of them sharing the same loathing.</P>
<P>They fought so hard that</P>
<P>Heaven and earth were thrown into darkness,</P>
<P>Gods and demons were terrified,</P>
<P>The sun went pale in the dense smoke,</P>
<P>Dragons and tigers trembled.</P>
<P>One gnashed his teeth, as if filing nails of jade;</P>
<P>The other's glaring eyes burned with golden fire.</P>
<P>Moving to and fro they showed off their valour,</P>
<P>In an endless play of sword and cudgel.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the old demon had fought twenty rounds with Monkey and neither had emerged the victor he waved the scabbard of his sword and called all his little devils forward. Over three hundred of them all rushed up and surrounded Monkey. The splendid Great Sage, quite unperturbed, used his cudgel to strike and parry to either side, before and behind. The little devils all had great skill, and they fought their way ever closer to him, tying him up as if in a tangle of silk floss as they tugged at his waist and legs. They would not retreat. The Great Sage was so alarmed by this that he used extra-corporeal magic. Plucking a bunch of hairs from under his left ribs he chewed thew to pieces that he blew out with the shout, &#8220;Change!&#8221; Every piece turned into another Monkey. Just watch as the biggest ones wield cudgels, the short ones use their fists, and the tiniest ones, with no other way of attacking grabbed knuckles and sank their teeth into muscles.</P>
<P>The little devils were put to rout. &#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; they yelled, &#8220;it's going all wrong. We're in terrible trouble. The whole mountain and everywhere else is swarming with Sun the Novices.&#8221; Now that his little devils had been thrown back by the extra-corporeal magic the demon king was hard-pressed; rush around as he might, there was to escape for him.</P>
<P>In his alarm the demon took his precious sword in his left hand and reached behind his neck with right hand to bring out the Plantain Fan. Then he turned towards the fire-gods of the Southeast and the Constellation Ligong he waved the fan. At once flames shot out of the ground, for such was the power of that treasure. The monster was truly ruthless. He waved the fan seven or eight times, setting great fires burning heaven and earth. It was a fine blaze:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Not a heavenly fire,</P>
<P>Nor a fire in a furnace,</P>
<P>Nor a fire on the mountain,</P>
<P>Nor a fire under the pot.</P>
<P>But the miraculous fire that comes from the Five Elements.</P>
<P>The fan is no ordinary object,</P>
<P>Nor was it fashioned by human skill:</P>
<P>It is a treasure made when Chaos was first parted.</P>
<P>The fire caused by this fan</P>
<P>Shines and dazzles</P>
<P>Like red silk lightning;</P>
<P>Burns and blazes</P>
<P>Like crimson gauze sunsets.</P>
<P>Not a wisp of smoke,</P>
<P>Only a mountain covered in flame,</P>
<P>Turning the pines on its ridges into trees of fire,</P>
<P>And the cypresses by its crags into lanterns.</P>
<P>The beasts in their dens, fearful for their lives,</P>
<P>Rush hither and thither;</P>
<P>The birds in the woods, to save their feathers,</P>
<P>Fly far and high.</P>
<P>The magic fire that roars up to the sky,</P>
<P>Destroys the rocks, dries up the streams, and makes all red.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Great Sage trembled with fear at the sight of this evil fire. &#8220;This is terrible,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It may do me no harm, but I can't save those hairs of mine. If they are caught by the fire they'll burn the way hair does.&#8221;</P>
<P>So he shook himself and took the hair back on his body, leaving just one behind as a facsimile of himself. Then, to avoid disaster by fire, his real self somersaulted upwards, reciting a spell to ward off the fire, and escaped from the inferno. He went straight back to the Lotus Flower Cave in the hope of rescuing his master. He rushed to the cave doors, brought his cloud down to land, and found over a hundred little devils there with smashed heads, broken legs, and open wounds. They had all been wounded by his magical other selves and were now standing there howling in agony. At the sight of them the Great Sage could not restrain his evil and murderous nature; he laid into them, swinging his iron cudgel. The poor devils, who were the fruit of so much hard work to acquire human form, became so many pieces of worn and hairy hide once more.</P>
<P>Having wiped out all the little devils the Great Sage stormed into the cave to free his master. Seeing more dazzling flames inside he was struck by a thought that filled him with panic: &#8220;That's done it. The fire's come in through the back door. There's no way I'll be able to rescue the Master.&#8221; Terrified though he was, he looked more carefully and saw that it was not flames but a golden glow. Pulling himself together he looked inside and saw that the light came from a vase in &#8220;mutton-fat&#8221; jade.</P>
<P>&#8220;What a beauty,&#8221; he thought with glee. &#8220;That's the vase that shone on the mountain when those two little devils were carrying it. I took it off them, then the demon king found it when he searched me later. Now I see that it shines when they keep it here too.&#8221; Watch him as he takes such pleasure in stealing the vase that instead of rescuing his master he gets out of the cave as fast as he can. He was just outside when the demon king appeared from the South, brandishing his magic sword and the fan. Before the Great Sage could take evasive action the demon raised the sword and hacked at his face. But the Great Sage immediately soared into the air on a somersault cloud and disappeared without trace.</P>
<P>Back at the cave mouth the demon king was so distressed by the sight of the corpses of his spirits all over the place that he threw back his head and groaned, and could not help wailing loudly at the pain of it. This is proved by a poem that goes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Wicked the ape, and stubborn the evil horse,</P>
<P>That had their souls reborn in mortal form.</P>
<P>Because in their folly they left the halls of Heaven</P>
<P>They forgot themselves and landed in these hills.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Woeful the swan that loses the flock;</P>
<P>Tearful the demon soldiers whose race is destroyed.</P>
<P>When will their sin be done and their bonds released</P>
<P>So that they may return to their heavenly home?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Overcome with remorse, the Senior Demon King sobbed at every step as he went into the cave. Although all the objects and furniture were still in the cave it was silent and deserted. It made him even more lonely and depressed. He sat alone in the cave, slumped on the stone table, the sword leaning against it, and the fan behind his neck again. Thus he drifted into sleep. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Happiness braces the spirit;</P>
<P>Sorrow just sends you to sleep.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story goes on to tell how the Great Sage Sun turned his somersault cloud round and brought it to a stop in front of the mountain. As he wanted to rescue his master he fastened the vase securely at his waist and went back to the cave to reconnoiter. The doors were wide open, and the silence was unbroken, so he crept stealthily inside to find the old demon slumped against the stone table, fast asleep. The Plantain Fan stick out from his clothes at his shoulder, half covering the back of his head, and the Seven-star Sword was still leaning against the table. Monkey made his way forward very quietly, pulled the fan out, then turned and whooshed out. This was because the fan had rubbed against the monster's hair, waking him up. As soon as he looked up and saw that Monkey had stolen the fan he grabbed for his sword and went after him. By now Monkey was already outside the doors, the fan safely tucked in his belt and his iron cudgel in his hands as he met the monster's onslaught. It was a splendid fight.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The angry demon king,</P>
<P>Beside himself with fury,</P>
<P>Angry enough to swallow Monkey whole.</P>
<P>Unable to let off his rage,</P>
<P>Viciously he cursed the ape;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're always trying to fool with me.</P>
<P>You've killed so many of my people,</P>
<P>And you've taken away my treasures.</P>
<P>There'll be no mercy in this fight:</P>
<P>We'll see who's to survive.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Great Sage yelled back at the demon:</P>
<P>&#8220;You haven't a lick of sense.</P>
<P>For a beginner like you to fight against me</P>
<P>Would be like trying to smash a rock with eggs.&#8221;</P>
<P>The sword was met by the iron cudgel</P>
<P>As both sides fought without giving quarter.</P>
<P>In clash after clash they struggled for mastery,</P>
<P>Turning and twisting to show their skill in arms.</P>
<P>To rescue the pilgrim priest,</P>
<P>And visit the Buddha on Vulture Peak,</P>
<P>Metal and Fire would not yield to each other,</P>
<P>And the chaos of the elements destroyed their friendship.</P>
<P>As they showed their martial prowess and magic powers,</P>
<P>They sent stones and sand flying with their display of skill.</P>
<P>As they fought the sun was slowly setting;</P>
<P>The frightened demon was the first to quit.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After thirty or forty rounds of fighting against Monkey, by when the day was almost over, the demon king could hold out no longer and he broke away, defeated. He made off to the Southwest, heading for the Crushed Dragon Cave.</P>
<P>Monkey then brought his cloud down to land and rushed straight back into the Lotus Flower Cave, where he freed the Tang Priest, Pig, and Friar Sand. The three of them thanked Monkey for delivering them from dire peril, then asked where the demons had gone.</P>
<P>To this Monkey replied, &#8220;The Junior Demon King is inside the gourd, and I reckon he must have dissolved by now. I've just beaten the Senior King, and he's gone back to the Crushed Dragon Cave. As for the little devils from the cave, I killed half of them with my magical extra bodies, then wiped out the wounded survivors of the rout who came back here. That's how I was able to get in here to rescue you.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Tang Priest thanked him no end: &#8220;I'm so grateful to you for your great efforts, disciple.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're telling me it was a great effort,&#8221; laughed Monkey. &#8220;You lot only had to put up with the pain of being hung up, but I wasn't allowed to stand still for a moment. I was more rushed than a postal courier with an urgent message, having to charge around all over the place without stopping. I was only able to put the demons down because I stole their treasures.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Show us the gourd, brother,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;I think he must have dissolved by now.&#8221; Monkey took the vase from his belt and then produced the Dazzling Golden Cord and the fan before bringing the gourd out in his hands.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't look inside,&#8221; he said, &#8220;don't. When he put me in there I tricked him into taking the lid off and letting me get away by swilling saliva round in my mouth. We absolutely mustn't take the lid off in case he plays a trick on us and escapes too.&#8221; In their happiness master and disciples found the rice, noodles and vegetables in the cave, cleaned up the stove and cooking pots, and made themselves a vegetarian meal. When they were full they went to sleep in the cave. Nothing worth recounting happened that night, and before long the new day dawned.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Senior Demon King meanwhile had gone straight to the Crushed Dragon Mountain, where he called together all the she-devils and told them how his mother had been murdered, his brother put in the gourd, the devil soldiers all killed and the treasures stolen.</P>
<P>At this the she-devils all wept. After they had been wailing for a long time he said, &#8220;Try not to upset yourselves. I still have my Seven-star Sword, and I'm going to parade all you women soldiers behind the Crushed Dragon Mountain, where I'll borrow some troops from my relatives. My mind is made up: I'll capture Sun the Novice and have my revenge on him.&#8221;</P>
<P>The words were not out of his mouth before a little devil from outside the doors reported, &#8220;Your Majesty, your lord uncle from the other side of the mountains is here with soldiers.&#8221; At this news the Senior Demon King quickly put on white mourning garments and went out to greet him in person. This lord uncle was King Septimus Fox, the younger brother of the demon king's mother, and he had heard from devils of his who were out patrolling the mountains how Monkey had killed his sister then impersonated her to steal his nephew's treasures and was fighting him in the battle of Flat-top Mountain that same day. Septimus Fox was bringing over two hundred of his own devil troops to help in the battle when he called for news at his sister's place on the way. As soon as he stepped inside and saw the demon king in mourning for his mother the two of them started to weep aloud. After weeping for some time the demon king bowed to him and told him what had happened. In his anger Septimus told the demon king to change out of his mourning clothes, pick up his sword, call the roll of women soldiers and join forces with him. They then set off on winds and clouds towards the Northeast.</P>
<P>The Great Sage had just told Friar Sand to get the breakfast ready as they would set off straight after eating it when he heard the sound of a wind. Going outside to look he saw a host of demon soldiers approaching from the Southwest. This alarmed him, so he ran back in a hurry and shouted to Pig, &#8220;Brother, that evil spirit is back again with reinforcements.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang went pale with fright at the news. &#8220;Disciple,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;what can this mean?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry,&#8221; chuckled Monkey, &#8220;don't worry. Fetch me all their treasures.&#8221; The Great Sage then tucked the gourd and the vase in his belt, put the Dazzling Golden Cord in his sleeve, stuck the Plantain Fan behind his shoulder, and whirled the iron cudgel around with both his hands. Friar Sand he ordered to stay put inside the cave guarding the master, while he asked Pig to come outside with his rake to meet the enemy.</P>
<P>When the demons' line of battle was drawn up King Septimus Fox took command. He had a jade face and long whiskers, a brow of steel and ears like swords. His helmet was of refined gold, he wore chainmail armor and he held a heaven-square halberd.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll get you, you bold and impudent ape,&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;How dare you treat people so badly? You've stolen the treasures, wounded my relations, killed the demon soldiers, and to top it all occupied their cave palace. All of you stretch your heads out to be executed while I avenge my sister's family.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You hairy crowd, you misery-makers,&#8221; replied Monkey, &#8220;you can't realize what powers I have. Don't go&#8212;take this from my cudgel.&#8221; The monster twisted round to avoid the blow, then struck back at his head with the heaven-square halberd. The two of them fought three or four rounds on the mountain-top until the monster was too weak to continue. He fled from the field, followed by Monkey until he was blocked by the Senior Demon King. When these two had fought three more rounds Septimus Fox came back into the attack. Seeing this from where he was at the edge of the battle Pig brandished his nine-toothed rake to stop him. The battle went on undecided for a long time with each fighter blocked by another until the demon king called up all the demon troops to surround Pig.</P>
<P>Sanzang meanwhile was sitting in the cave hearing the shouts and the shaking of the ground. He told Friar Sand to go outside and see whether or not his brother was winning. Friar Sand raised his demon-quelling staff and charged out with a roar, putting the devilish horde to flight. Seeing that things were going badly, Septimus turned to flee, only to be caught a blow on the back from Pig's rake as Pig came after him. At this nine jets of blood gushed out of him, and the poor spirit's true being carried on ahead of him. When Pig grabbed him and tore off his clothes he saw that Septimus was in fact a fox spirit.</P>
<P>At the sight of his uncle being wounded the demon king broke away from Monkey and raised his sword to strike at Pig, who parried with his rake. While the two of them were fighting it out Friar Sand came up and struck at the demon king with his staff. This was more than the demon could cope with, so he set off on his wind and cloud, fleeing South with Pig and Friar Sand close on his heels. Seeing this the Great Sage at once went soaring up into the sky on his cloud. He brought out the vase to catch the old demon in.</P>
<P>&#8220;King Golden Horn,&#8221; he shouted, and the old demon, imagining that one of his defeated little devils was calling, turned to reply. Into the vase he whistled, and Monkey put on a label reading:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>To the Great Lord Lao: to be dealt with urgently in accordance with the Statutes and Ordinances.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Seven-star Sword fell to the ground, and it too was now Monkey's. &#8220;You've got the sword, brother,&#8221; said Pig as he came towards him, &#8220;but where's the evil spirit?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He's done for,&#8221; laughed Monkey. &#8220;I've got him in this vase.&#8221; Like Pig, Friar Sand was delighted when he heard.</P>
<P>Now that all the evil spirits had been wiped out the disciples went back into the cave to tell the good news to Sanzang: &#8220;The mountain has been cleaned up and the demons no longer exist. Please mount, Master, and we'll be on our way.&#8221; Sanzang was beside himself with joy. Master and disciples ate their breakfast, got their baggage and horse ready, and hurried on their way West.</P>
<P>As they were walking along a blind man suddenly appeared beside the path, went up to them, and seized Sanzang's horse.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you going, monk?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Give me back my treasures.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's done it,&#8221; said Pig with horror. &#8220;It's the old demon here to demand his treasures back.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey looked carefully and saw that it was the Supreme Lord Lao Zi he rushed up to him, greeted him and asked, &#8220;Where are you going, old fellow?&#8221;</P>
<P>The venerable elder at once rose up to his throne in the realm of jade, drew himself upright amid the nine mists and called, &#8220;Sun the Novice, give me back my treasures.&#8221; The Great Sage rose into the air and asked. &#8220;What treasures?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I use the gourd to keep cinnabar and the vase to hold water,&#8221; replied the Lord Lao. &#8220;The precious sword I use for refining demons, the fan for fanning my fire, and the cord for tying round my gown. One of those two demons was a servant boy who looked after my golden furnace, and the other a servant who looked after my silver furnace. They stole my treasures and came down to the mortal world. I could not find them anywhere. You have done a very good deed in capturing them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're very rude indeed, old fellow,&#8221; said the Great Sage. &#8220;You deserve to be charged with laxity for allowing members of your household to become evil spirits.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't blame the wrong person,&#8221; said Lord Lao. &#8220;It was nothing to do with me. It was the Bodhisattva from the sea who asked me for the loan of them three times, and sent them here to be turned into monsters to test whether your master and his disciples truly wanted to go to the West.&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing this the Great Sage thought, &#8220;That Bodhisattva is a terrible old liar. When she delivered me and told me to protect the Tang Priest on his journey to the West to fetch the scriptures I said that the journey would be tough and difficult. She promised to come and help me whenever things were really desperate. But so far from helping she's sent evil spirits to play me up and give me a hard time. The liar. She deserves to be an old maid all her life. If the old fellow hadn't come here himself I most certainly would not have given them back to him. But now that you've told me all this you'd better have them.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the Lord Lao had his five treasures back he took the stoppers out of the gourd and the vase and tipped out two wisps of immortal vapor. As he pointed at them they turned into his two servants of the gold and silver furnace who waited on him on either side. Then a myriad rays of coloured light appeared and they floated back to the Tushita Palace and drifted straight on up to the Daluo Heaven.</P>
<P>If you don't know what happened afterwards, or how the Great Sage Sun protected the Tang Priest, or when they reached the Western Heaven, listen to the explanations in the next installment.</P>

<p>外道施威欺正性</p>
<p>心猿获宝伏邪魔</p>
</div>
<p>“本性圆明道自通，翻身跳出网罗中。修成变化非容易，炼就长生岂俗同？清浊几番随运转，辟开数劫任西东。逍遥万亿年无计，一点神光永注空。”此诗暗合孙大圣的道妙。他自得了那魔真宝，笼在袖中，喜道：“泼魔苦苦用心拿我，诚所谓水中捞月；老孙若要擒你，就好似火上弄冰。”藏着葫芦，密密的溜出门外，现了本相，厉声高叫道：“精怪开门！”旁有小妖道：“你又是甚人，敢来吆喝？”行者道：“快报与你那老泼魔，吾乃行者孙来也。”那小妖急入里报道：“大王，门外有个甚么行者孙来了。”老魔大惊道：“贤弟，不好了！惹动他一窝风了！幌金绳现拴着孙行者，葫芦里现装着者行孙，怎么又有个甚么行者孙？</p>

<p>想是他几个兄弟都来了。”二魔道：兄长放心，我这葫芦装下一千人哩。我才装了者行孙一个，又怕那甚么行者孙！等我出去看看，一发装来。”老魔道：“兄弟仔细。”</p>

<p>你看那二魔拿着个假葫芦，还象前番雄纠纠、气昂昂走出门高呼道：“你是那里人氏，敢在此间吆喝？”行者道：“你认不得我？家居花果山，祖贯水帘洞。只为闹天宫，多时罢争竞。如今幸脱灾，弃道从僧用。秉教上雷音，求经归觉正。相逢野泼魔，却把神通弄。还我大唐僧，上西参佛圣。两家罢战争，各守平安境。休惹老孙焦，伤残老性命！”那魔道：“你且过来，我不与你相打，但我叫你一声，你敢应么？”行者笑道：“你叫我，我就应了；我若叫你，你可应么？”那魔道：“我叫你，是我有个宝贝葫芦，可以装人；你叫我，却有何物？”行者道：“我也有个葫芦儿。”那魔道：“既有，拿出来我看。”行者就于袖中取出葫芦道：“泼魔，你看！”幌一幌，复藏在袖中，恐他来抢。那魔见了大惊道：“他葫芦是那里来的？怎么就与我的一般？纵是一根藤上结的，也有个大小不同，偏正不一，却怎么一般无二？”他便正色叫道：“行者孙，你那葫芦是那里来的？”行者委的不知来历，接过口来就问他一句道：“你那葫芦是那里来的？”那魔不知是个见识，只道是句老实言语，就将根本从头说出道：“我这葫芦是混沌初分，天开地辟，有一位太上老祖，解化女娲之名，炼石补天，普救阎浮世界；补到乾宫夬地，见一座昆仑山脚下，有一缕仙藤，上结着这个紫金红葫芦，却便是老君留下到如今者。”大圣闻言，就绰了他口气道：“我的葫芦，也是那里来的。”</p>

<p>魔头道：“怎见得？”大圣道：“自清浊初开，天不满西北，地不满东南，太上道祖解化女娲，补完天缺，行至昆仑山下，有根仙藤，藤结有两个葫芦。我得一个是雄的，你那个却是雌的。”那怪道：“莫说雌雄，但只装得人的，就是好宝贝。”大圣道：“你也说得是，我就让你先装。”那怪甚喜，急纵身跳将起去，到空中执着葫芦，叫一声“行者孙。”大圣听得，却就不歇气连应了八九声，只是不能装去。那魔坠将下来，跌脚捶胸道：“天那！只说世情不改变哩！这样个宝贝也怕老公，雌见了雄，就不敢装了！”行者笑道：“你且收起，轮到老孙该叫你哩。”急纵筋斗，跳起去，将葫芦底儿朝天，口儿朝地，照定妖魔，叫声“银角大王”。那怪不敢闭口，只得应了一声，倏的装在里面，被行者贴上“太上老君急急如律令奉敕”的帖子，心中暗喜道：“我的儿，你今日也来试试新了！”</p>

<p>他就按落云头，拿着葫芦，心心念念，只是要救师父，又往莲花洞口而来。那山上都是些洼踏不平之路，况他又是个圈盘腿，拐呀拐的走着，摇的那葫芦里漷漷索索，响声不绝。你道他怎么便有响声？原来孙大圣是熬炼过的身体，急切化他不得，那怪虽也能腾云驾雾，不过是些法术，大端是凡胎未脱，到于宝贝里就化了。行者还不当他就化了，笑道：“我儿子啊，不知是撒尿耶，不知是漱口哩，这是老孙干过的买卖。不等到七八日，化成稀汁，我也不揭盖来看。忙怎的？有甚要紧？想着我出来的容易，就该千年不看才好！”他拿着葫芦说着话，不觉的到了洞口，把那葫芦摇摇，一发响了，他道：“这个象发课的筒子响，倒好发课。等老孙发一课，看师父甚么时才得出门。”你看他手里不住的摇，口里不住的念道：“周易文王、孔子圣人、桃花女先生、鬼谷子先生。”那洞里小妖看见道：“大王，祸事了！行者孙把二大王爷爷装在葫芦里发课哩！”那老魔闻得此言。唬得魂飞魄散，骨软筋麻，扑的跌倒在地，放声大哭道：“贤弟呀！我和你私离上界，转托尘凡，指望同享荣华，永为山洞之主。怎知为这和尚伤了你的性命，断吾手足之情！”满洞群妖，一齐痛哭。</p>

<p>猪八戒吊在梁上，听得他一家子齐哭，忍不住叫道：“妖精，你且莫哭，等老猪讲与你听。先来的孙行者，次来的者行孙，后来的行者孙，返复三字，都是我师兄一人。他有七十二变化，腾那进来，盗了宝贝，装了令弟。令弟已是死了，不必这等扛丧，快些儿刷净锅灶，办些香蕈、蘑菇、茶芽、竹笋、豆腐、面筋、木耳、蔬菜，请我师徒们下来，与你令弟念卷受生经。”那老魔闻言，心中大怒道：“只说猪八戒老实，原来甚不老实！他倒作笑话儿打觑我！”叫小妖：“且休举哀，把猪八戒解下来，蒸得稀烂，等我吃饱了，再去拿孙行者报仇。”沙僧埋怨八戒道：“好么！我说教你莫多话，多话的要先蒸吃哩！”那呆子也尽有几分悚惧。旁一小妖道：“大王，猪八戒不好蒸。”八戒道：“阿弥陀佛！是那位哥哥积阴德的？果是不好蒸。”又有一个妖道：“将他皮剥了，就好蒸。”八戒慌了道：“好蒸！好蒸！皮骨虽然粗糙，汤滚就烂，棬户！棬户！”正嚷处，只见前门外一个小妖报道：“行者孙又骂上门来了！”那老魔又大惊道：“这厮轻我无人！”</p>

<p>叫：“小的们，且把猪八戒照旧吊起，查一查还有几件宝贝。”管家的小妖道：“洞中还有三件宝贝哩。”老魔问：“是那三件？”管家的道：“还有七星剑、芭蕉扇与净瓶。”老魔道：“那瓶子不中用，原是叫人，人应了就装得，转把个口诀儿教了那孙行者，倒把自家兄弟装去了。不用他，放在家里，快将剑与扇子拿来。”</p>

<p>那管家的即将两件宝贝献与老魔。老魔将芭蕉扇插在后项衣领，把七星剑提在手中，又点起大小群妖，有三百多名，都教一个个拈枪弄棒，理索轮刀。这老魔却顶盔贯甲，罩一领赤焰焰的丝袍。群妖摆出阵去，要拿孙大圣。那孙大圣早已知二魔化在葫芦里面，却将他紧紧拴扣停当，撒在腰间，手持着金箍棒，准备厮杀。只见那老妖红旗招展，跳出门来。却怎生打扮？头上盔缨光焰焰，腰间带束彩霞鲜。身穿铠甲龙鳞砌，上罩红袍烈火然。圆眼睁开光掣电，钢须飘起乱飞烟。七星宝剑轻提手，芭蕉扇子半遮肩。行似流云离海岳，声如霹雳震山川。威风凛凛欺天将，怒帅群妖出洞前。那老魔急令小妖摆开阵势，骂道：“你这猴子十分无礼！害我兄弟，伤我手足，着然可恨！”行者骂道：“你这讨死的怪物！你一个妖精的性命舍不得，似我师父、师弟、连马四个生灵，平白的吊在洞里，我心何忍！情理何甘！</p>

<p>快快的送将出来还我，多多贴些盘费，喜喜欢欢打发老孙起身，还饶了你这个老妖的狗命！”那怪那容分说，举宝剑劈头就砍，这大圣使铁棒举手相迎。这一场在洞门外好杀！咦！金箍棒与七星剑，对撞霞光如闪电。悠悠冷气逼人寒，荡荡昏云遮岭堰。那个皆因手足情，些儿不放善；这个只为取经僧，毫厘不容缓。两家各恨一般仇，二处每怀生怒怨。只杀得天昏地暗鬼神惊，日淡烟浓龙虎战。这个咬牙锉玉钉，那个怒目飞金焰。一来一往逞英雄，不住翻腾棒与剑。这老魔与大圣战经二十回合，不分胜负，他把那剑梢一指，叫声“小妖齐来！”那三百余精，一齐拥上，把行者围在垓心。好大圣，公然无惧，使一条棒，左冲右撞，后抵前遮。那小妖都有手段，越打越上，一似绵絮缠身，搂腰扯腿，莫肯退后，大圣慌了，即使个身外身法，将左胁下毫毛，拔了一把，嚼碎喷去，喝声叫“变！”一根根都变做行者。你看他长的使棒，短的轮拳，再小的没处下手，抱着孤拐啃筋，把那小妖都打得星落云散，齐声喊道：“大王啊，事不谐矣！</p>

<p>难矣乎哉！满地盈山皆是孙行者了！”被这身外法把群妖打退，止撇得老魔围困中间，赶得东奔西走，出路无门。</p>

<p>那魔慌了，将左手擎着宝剑，右手伸于项后，取出芭蕉扇子，望东南丙丁火，正对离宫，唿喇的一扇子，搧将下来，只见那就地上，火光焰焰。原来这般宝贝，平白地搧出火来。那怪物着实无情：一连搧了七八扇子，熯天炽地，烈火飞腾。好火：</p>

<p>那火不是天上火，不是炉中火，也不是山头火，也不是灶底火，乃是五行中自然取出的一点灵光火。这扇也不是凡间常有之物，也不是人工造就之物，乃是自开辟混沌以来产成的珍宝之物。用此扇，搧此火、煌煌烨烨，就如电掣红绡；灼灼辉辉，却似霞飞绛绮。更无一缕青烟，尽是满山赤焰，只烧得岭上松翻成火树，崖前柏变作灯笼。那窝中走兽贪性命，西撞东奔；这林内飞禽惜羽毛，高飞远举。这场神火飘空燎，只烧得石烂溪干遍地红！大圣见此恶火，却也心惊胆颤，道声“不好了！我本身可处，毫毛不济，一落这火中，岂不真如燎毛之易？”将身一抖，遂将毫毛收上身来，只将一根变作假身子，避火逃灾，他的真身，捻着避火诀，纵筋斗，跳将起去，脱离了大火之中，径奔他莲花洞里，想着要救师父。急到门前，把云头按落，又见那洞门外有百十个小妖，都破头折脚，肉绽皮开，原来都是他分身法打伤了的，都在这里声声唤唤，忍疼而立。大圣见了，按不住恶性凶顽，轮起铁棒，一路打将进去。可怜把那苦炼人身的功果息，依然是块旧皮毛！</p>

<p>那大圣打绝了小妖，撞入洞里，要解师父，又见那内面有火光焰焰，唬得他手慌脚忙道：“罢了！罢了！这火从后门口烧起来，老孙却难救师父也！”正悚惧处，仔细看时，呀！原来不是火光，却是一道金光。他正了性，往里视之，乃羊脂玉净瓶放光，却自心中欢喜道：“好宝贝耶！这瓶子曾是那小妖拿在山上放光，老孙得了，不想那怪又复搜去。今日藏在这里，原来也放光。”你看他窃了这瓶子，喜喜欢欢，且不救师父，急抽身往洞外而走。才出门，只见那妖魔提着宝剑，拿着扇子，从南而来。</p>

<p>孙大圣回避不及，被那老魔举剑劈头就砍。大圣急纵筋斗云，跳将起去，无影无踪的逃了不题。</p>

<p>却说那怪到得门口，但见尸横满地，就是他手下的群精，慌得仰天长叹，止不住放声大哭道：“苦哉！痛哉！”有诗为证，诗曰：可恨猿乖马劣顽，灵胎转托降尘凡。只因错念离天阙，致使忘形落此山。鸿雁失群情切切，妖兵绝族泪潺潺。何时孽满开愆锁，返本还原上御关？那老魔惭惶不已，一步一声，哭入洞内，只见那什物家火俱在，只落得静悄悄，没个人形；悲切切，愈加凄惨。独自个坐在洞中，蹋伏在那石案之上，将宝剑斜倚案边，把扇子插于肩后，昏昏默默睡着了，这正是人逢喜事精神爽，闷上心来瞌睡多。</p>

<p>话说孙大圣拨转筋斗云，佇立山前，想着要救师父，把那净瓶儿牢扣腰间，径来洞口打探。见那门开两扇，静悄悄的不闻消耗，随即轻轻移步，潜入里边，只见那魔斜倚石案，呼呼睡着，芭蕉扇褪出肩衣，半盖着脑后，七星剑还斜倚案边，却被他轻轻的走上前拔了扇子，急回头，呼的一声跑将出去。原来这扇柄儿刮着那怪的头发，早惊醒他。抬头看时，是孙行者偷了，急慌忙执剑来赶。那大圣早已跳出门前，将扇子撒在腰间，双手轮开铁棒，与那魔抵敌。这一场好杀：恼坏泼妖王，怒发冲冠志。恨不过挝来囫囵吞，难解心头气。恶口骂猢狲：“你老大将人戏，伤我若干生，还来偷宝贝！这场决不容，定见存亡计！”大圣喝妖魔：“你好不知趣！徒弟要与老师争，累卵焉能击石碎？”</p>

<p>宝剑来，铁棒去，两家更不留仁义。一翻二复赌输赢，三转四回施武艺。盖为取经僧，灵山参佛位，致令金火不相投，五行拨乱伤和气。扬威耀武显神通，走石飞沙弄本事。交锋渐渐日将晡，魔头力怯先回避。那老魔与大圣战经三四十合，天将晚矣，抵敌不住，败下阵来，径往西南上，投奔压龙洞去不题。</p>

<p>这大圣才按落云头，闯入莲花洞里，解下唐僧与八戒、沙和尚来。他三人脱得灾危，谢了行者，却问：“妖魔那里去了？”</p>

<p>行者道：“二魔已装在葫芦里，想是这会子已化了；大魔才然一阵战败，往西南压龙山去讫。概洞小妖，被老孙分身法打死一半，还有些败残回的，又被老孙杀绝，方才得入此处，解放你们。”唐僧谢之不尽道：“徒弟啊，多亏你受了劳苦！”行者笑道：“诚然劳苦。你们还只是吊着受疼，我老孙再不曾住脚，比急递铺的铺兵还甚，反复里外，奔波无已。因是偷了他的宝贝，方能平退妖魔。”猪八戒道：“师兄，你把那葫芦儿拿出来与我们看看。只怕那二魔已化了也。”大圣先将净瓶解下，又将金绳与扇子取出，然后把葫芦儿拿在手道：“莫看莫看！他先曾装了老孙，被老孙漱口，哄得他扬开盖子，老孙方得走了。我等切莫揭盖，只怕他也会弄喧走了。”师徒们喜喜欢欢，将他那洞中的米面菜蔬寻出。烧刷了锅灶，安排些素斋吃了，饱餐一顿，安寝洞中。一夜无词，早又天晓。</p>

<p>却说那老魔径投压龙山，会聚了大小女怪，备言打杀母亲，装了兄弟，绝灭妖兵，偷骗宝贝之事，众女怪一齐大哭。哀痛多时道：“你等且休凄惨。我身边还有这口七星剑，欲会汝等女兵，都去压龙山后，会借外家亲戚，断要拿住那孙行者报仇。”说不了，有门外小妖报道：“大王，山后老舅爷帅领若干兵卒来也。”老魔闻言，急换了缟素孝服，躬身迎接。原来那老舅爷是他母亲之弟，名唤狐阿七大王，因闻得哨山的妖兵报道，他姐姐被孙行者打死，假变姐形，盗了外甥宝贝，连日在平顶山拒敌。他却帅本洞妖兵二百余名，特来助阵，故此先拢姐家问信。才进门，见老魔挂了孝服，二人大哭。哭久，老魔拜下，备言前事。那阿七大怒，即命老魔换了孝服，提了宝剑，尽点女妖，合同一处，纵风云，径投东北而来。</p>

<p>这大圣却教沙僧整顿早斋，吃了走路，忽听得风声，走出门看，乃是一伙妖兵，自西南上来。行者大惊，急抽身忙呼八戒道：“兄弟，妖精又请救兵来也。”三藏闻言，惊恐失色道：“徒弟，似此如何？”行者笑道：“放心！放心！”把他这宝贝都拿来与我。”大圣将葫芦、净瓶系在腰间，金绳笼于袖内，芭蕉扇插在肩后，双手轮着铁棒，教沙僧保守师父，稳坐洞中，着八戒执钉钯，同出洞外迎敌。那怪物摆开阵势，只见当头的是阿七大王。</p>

<p>他生的玉面长髯，钢眉刀耳，头戴金炼盔，身穿锁子甲，手执方天戟，高声骂道：“我把你个大胆的泼猴！怎敢这等欺人！偷了宝贝，伤了眷族，杀了神兵，又敢久占洞府！赶早儿一个个引颈受死，雪我姐家之仇！”行者骂道：“你这伙作死的毛团，不识你孙外公的手段！不要走！领吾一棒！”那怪物侧身躲过，使方天戟劈面相印。两个在山头一来一往，战经三四回合，那怪力软，败阵回走。行者赶来，却被老魔接住，又斗了三合，只见那狐阿七复转来攻。这壁厢八戒见了，急掣九齿钯挡住。一个抵一个，战经多时，不分胜败，那老魔喝了一声，众妖兵一齐围上。</p>

<p>却说那三藏坐在莲花洞里，听得喊声振地，便叫：“沙和尚，你出去看你师兄胜负如何。”沙僧果举降妖杖出来，喝一声，撞将出去，打退群妖。阿七见事势不利，回头就走，被八戒赶上，照背后一钯，就筑得九点鲜红往外冒，可怜一灵真性赴前程。急拖来剥了衣服看处，原来也是个狐狸精。那老魔见伤了他老舅，丢了行者，提宝剑，就劈八戒，八戒使钯架住。正赌斗间，沙僧撞近前来，举杖便打，那妖抵敌不住，纵风云往南逃走，八戒沙僧紧紧赶来。大圣见了，急纵云跳在空中，解下净瓶，罩定老魔，叫声“金角大王！”那怪只道是自家败残的小妖呼叫，就回头应了一声，飕的装将进去，被行者贴上“太上老君急急如律令奉敕”的帖子。只见那七星剑坠落尘埃，也归了行者。八戒迎着道：“哥哥，宝剑你得了，精怪何在？”行者笑道：了了！已装在我这瓶儿里也。”沙僧听说，与八戒十分欢喜。</p>

<p>当时通扫净诸邪，回至洞里，与三藏报喜道：“山已净，妖已无矣，请师父上马走路。”三藏喜不自胜。师徒们吃了早斋，收拾了行李马匹，奔西找路。正行处，猛见路旁闪出一个瞽者，走上前扯住三藏马，道：“和尚那里去？还我宝贝来！”八戒大惊道：“罢了！这是老妖来讨宝贝了！”行者仔细观看，原来是太上李老君，慌得近前施礼道：“老官儿，那里去？”那老祖急升玉局宝座，九霄空里佇立，叫：“孙行者，还我宝贝。”大圣起到空中道：“甚么宝贝？”老君道：“葫芦是我盛丹的，净瓶是我盛水的，宝剑是我炼魔的，扇子是我搧火的，绳子是我一根勒袍的带。</p>

<p>那两个怪：一个是我看金炉的童子，一个是我看银炉的童子，只因他偷了我的宝贝，走下界来，正无觅处，却是你今拿住，得了功绩。”大圣道：“你这老官儿，着实无礼，纵放家属为邪，该问个钤束不严的罪名。”老君道：“不干我事，不可错怪了人。此乃海上菩萨问我借了三次，送他在此托化妖魔，看你师徒可有真心往西去也。”大圣闻言，心中作念道：“这菩萨也老大惫懒！</p>

<p>当时解脱老孙，教保唐僧西去取经，我说路途艰涩难行，他曾许我到急难处亲来相救。如今反使精邪掯害，语言不的，该他一世无夫！若不是老官儿亲来，我决不与他。既是你这等说，拿去罢。”那老君收得五件宝贝，揭开葫芦与净瓶盖口，倒出两股仙气，用手一指，仍化为金、银二童子，相随左右。只见那霞光万道，咦！缥缈同归兜率院，逍遥直上大罗天。毕竟不知此后又有甚事，孙大圣怎生保护唐僧，几时得到西天，且听下回分解。</p>
