<P>The story goes on to tell how the Great Sage Equaling Heaven was escorted by the hosts of heavenly soldiers to the Demon-beheading Tower and tied to the Demon-subduing Pillar. They hacked at him with sabres, sliced at him with axes, lunged at him with spears and cut at him with swords, but they were unable to inflict a single wound on him. The Southern Dipper angrily ordered all the gods of the Department of Fire to set him alight and burn him up, but he would not ignite. He told the gods of the Department of Thunder to nail splinters of thunder into him, but however hard they tried they could not harm a hair of his body. The Strong-arm Demon King and the rest of them then reported this to the throne.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; they said, &#8220;this Great Sage has learned somewhere or other how to protect himself by magic. Although your subjects have hacked at him with sabres, sliced at him with axes, struck at him with thunder and tried to burn him with fire, we have not been able to harm a hair of his body. What are we to do?&#8221;</P>

<P>&#8220;How can we deal with a wretch like this?&#8221; the Jade Emperor asked, and the Lord Lao Zi replied to this in a memorial: &#8220;That monkey has eaten the peaches of immortality, drunk the imperial liquor, and stolen the pills of elixir. He swallowed those five gourds of pills of mine, fresh ones and mature ones alike. Now we have used the fire of samadhi on him, which has tempered his body and made it a diamond one that cannot be harmed. The best course would be to let me take him and put him in my Eight Trigrams Furnace, where I can refine out my elixir with the civil and martial fire and reduce him to ashes at the same time. The Jade Emperor then ordered the Six Dings and the Six Jias to untie him and hand him over to the Lord Lao Zi, who took him away in obedience to the imperial decree. At the same time the Jade Emperor summoned the Illustrious Sage Erlang to his presence and rewarded him with a hundred golden flowers, a hundred jars of imperial liquor, a hundred pills of elixir, rare jewels, lustrous pearls, brocade, embroidery, and other gifts to share with his sworn brothers. The True Lord Erlang thanked him for his bounty and returned to Guanjiangkou.</p>

<p>话表齐天大圣被众天兵押去斩妖台下，绑在降妖柱上，刀砍斧剁，枪刺剑刳，莫想伤及其身。南斗星奋令火部众神，放火煨烧，亦不能烧着。又着雷部众神，以雷屑钉打，越发不能伤损一毫。那大力鬼王与众启奏道：“万岁，这大圣不知是何处学得这护身之法，臣等用刀砍斧剁，雷打火烧，一毫不能伤损，却如之何？”玉帝闻言道：“这厮这等，这等，如何处治？”太上老君即奏道：“那猴吃了蟠桃，饮了御酒，又盗了仙丹。我那五壶丹，有生有熟，被他都吃在肚里，运用三昧火，锻成一块，所以浑做金钢之躯，急不能伤。不若与老道领去，放在八卦炉中，以文武火锻炼。炼出我的丹来，他身自为灰烬矣。”玉帝闻言，即教六丁、六甲将他解下，付与老君。老君领旨去讫，一壁厢宣二郎显圣，赏赐金花百朵，御酒百瓶，还丹百粒，异宝明珠，锦绣等件，教与义兄弟分享。真君谢恩，回灌江口不题。</p>

<P>When he reached the Tushita Palace, Lord Lao Zi had the Great Sage untied, took the hook from his collar-bone, pushed him into the Eight Trigrams Furnace, and ordered the priests in charge of it and the fire-boys to fan the fire up to refine him. Now this furnace was made up of the Eight Trigrams&#8212;<I>Qian, Kan, Gen, Zhen, Sun, Li, Kun,</I> and<I> Dui&#8212;</I>so he squeezed himself into the &#8220;Palace of<I> Sun,&#8221;</I> as<I> Sun</I> was the wind, and where there was wind there could be no fire. All that happened was that the wind stirred up the smoke, which made both his eyes red and left him somewhat blind with the illness called &#8220;fire eyes with golden pupils.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>那老君到兜率宫，将大圣解去绳索，放了穿琵琶骨之器，推入八卦炉中，命看炉的道人，架火的童子，将火扇起锻炼。原来那炉是乾、坎、艮、震、巽、离、坤、兑八卦。他即将身钻在巽宫位下。巽乃风也，有风则无火，只是风搅得烟来，把一双眼刍红了，弄做个老害病眼，故唤作“火眼金睛”。</p>
</div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<P>Time soon passed, and without him realizing it the seven times seven, or forty-nine, days had passed, and Lord Lao Zi's fire had reached the required temperature and burned for long enough. One day the furnace was opened for the elixir to be taken out. The Great Sage, who was shielding his eyes with both hands and wiping away his tears, heard a noise at the top of the furnace. He looked hard and saw daylight; and, unable to stand being in there a moment longer, leapt out of the furnace, kicked it over with a crash, and was off. In the ensuing chaos the fire-boys, the keepers of the furnace, the Dings and the Jias all tried to grab him, but he knocked them all down. He was like a white-browed tiger gone berserk, a single-horned dragon raving mad. Lord Lao Zi rushed up to seize him, but was thrown head over heels as the Great Sage freed himself. He took the As-You-Will cudgel from his ear, and shook it in the wind till it was thick as a bowl, and once more created total chaos in the Palace of Heaven, not caring in the least what he did. He laid about him to such effect that the Nine Bright Shiners shut their windows and doors, and not a sign was to be seen of the Four Heavenly Kings.</P>
<P>Marvellous monkey spirit! As the poem has it,</p>

<div class="right">

<p>真个光阴迅速，不觉七七四十九日，老君的火候俱全。忽一日，开炉取丹。那大圣双手侮着眼，正自揉搓流涕，只听得炉头声响，猛睁睛看见光明，他就忍不住将身一纵，跳出丹炉，唿喇一声，蹬倒八卦炉，往外就走。慌得那架火看炉与丁甲一班人来扯，被他一个个都放倒，好似癫痫的白额虎，风狂的独角龙。老君赶上抓一把，被他一扌卒，扌卒了个倒栽葱，脱身走了。即去耳中掣出如意棒，迎风幌一幌，碗来粗细，依然拿在手中，不分好歹，却又大乱天宫，打得那九曜星闭门闭户，四天王无影无形。好猴精！有诗为证。诗曰：</p>

<P>This time the Monkey King made no distinctions between high and humble as he laid about him to East and West with his iron club. Not a single god opposed him. He fought his way into the Hall of Universal Brightness outside the Hall of Miraculous Mist, where the Kingly Spirit Officer, the lieutenant of the Helpful Sage and True Lord, fortunately was on duty. When he saw the Great Sage charging around he took up his golden mace and went forward to resist him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you going, damned monkey?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;If you go wild you'll have me to deal with.&#8221; The Great Sage was not in a position to argue with him, so he raised his cudgel to strike him. The Spirit Officer lifted his mace and advanced to meet him. It was a fine fight:</p>

<P>As they fought together without either of them emerging as victor, the True Lord sent an officer with a message to the Thunder Palace ordering the thirty-six thunder generals to surround the Great Sage. Although they all fought with the utmost ferocity, the Great Sage was not in the least frightened, and parried and blocked to left and right with his As-You-Will cudgel, resisting his opponents in front and behind. Before long he found that the pressure was too great from the sabres, spears, swords, halberds, clubs, maces, claws-and-ropes, hammer, pole-axes, battle-axes, grabs, pennoned hooks, and moon-shaped bills of the thunder generals; so he shook himself and grew three heads and six arms. Then he shook his As-You-Will cudgel and changed it into three cudgels, and wielding the three cudgels in his six hands he flew round and round inside the encirclement like a spinning wheel. None of the thunder generals could get anywhere near him. Indeed,</p>

<P>Although the gods had the Great Sage cornered, they were unable to get near him. The noise of the shouting and the fighting had already alarmed the Jade Emperor, who ordered the Miracle Official Youyi to go to the West with the Helpful Sage and True Lord and ask the Buddha to subdue him.</p>

<P>When these two sages received the order they went to the wonderful land of the Miraculous Mountain, where they offered their greetings to the Four Vajrapanis and Eight Bodhisattvas before the Thunder Monastery and asked them to pass on their massage. The gods went to the foot of the lotus seat to inform the Tathagata, who invited the two sages to his presence. When the sages had performed the threefold obeisance to the Buddha they stood in attendance below the throne.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why has the Jade Emperor troubled you two sages to come here?&#8221; asked the Buddha.</P>
<P>&#8220;A monkey,&#8221; they reported, &#8220;who was born on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit, has used his magic powers to unite all the monkeys and throw the world into confusion. The Jade Emperor sent down an edict of amnesty and appointed him Protector of the Horses, but this was not good enough for him, so he left Heaven again. When heavenly King Li and Prince Nezha were unsuccessful in their attempt to capture him the Jade Emperor sent down another amnesty with his appointment as a 'Great Sage Equaling Heaven'. At first this appointment was purely nominal, but later he was told to look after the Peach Orchard. But he stole the peaches and then went to the Jade Pool where he stole the delicacies and the liquor and wrecked the banquet. In his drunkenness he staggered into the Tushita Palace, stole Lord Lao Zi's pills of immortality, and left Heaven again. The Jade Emperor sent a hundred thousand heavenly troops, but they were still unable to subdue him. Then Guanyin recommended the True Lord Erlang and his sworn brothers to go after the monkey, and he used many a transformation until he was finally able to capture the monkey after the Lord Lao Zi hit him with his Diamond Jade. The monkey was then taken to the imperial presence, and the order for his execution was given. But although he was hacked at with sabres, chopped at with axes, burned with fire, and struck with thunder, none of this did him any damage; so Lord Lao Zi requested permission to take him away and refine him with fire. But when the cauldron was opened after forty-nine days he jumped out of the Eight Trigrams Furnace, routed the heavenly troops, and went straight to the Hall of Universal Brightness in front of the Hall of Miraculous Mist. Here he has been stopped and engaged in fierce combat by the Kingly Spirit Officer, the lieutenant of the Helpful Sage and True Lord Erlang, thunder generals have been sent there to encircle him; but no one has been able to get close to him. In this crisis the Jade Emperor makes a special appeal to you, the Tathagata, to save his throne.&#8221;</p>
<P>On hearing this the Tathagata said to the assembled Bodhisattvas, &#8220;You stay here quietly in this dharma hall and behave yourselves in your seats of meditation while I go to deal with the demon and save the throne.&#8221;</P>

<P>Telling the Venerable Ananda and the Venerable Kasyapa to accompany him, the Tathagata left the Thunder Monastery and went straight to the gate of the Hall of Miraculous Mist, where his ears were shaken by the sound of shouting as the thirty-six thunder generals surrounded the Great Sage.

<P>&#8220;I am the Venerable Sakyamuni from the Western Land of Perfect Bliss,&#8221; replied the Buddha with a smile. &#8220;I have heard of your wild and boorish behavior, and of your repeated rebellions against Heaven, and I would like to know where you were born, when you found the Way, and why you have been so ferocious.&#8221;</P>

<P>The Buddha laughed mockingly.</P>
<P>&#8220;You wretch! You are only a monkey spirit and you have the effrontery to want to grab the throne of the Jade Emperor. He has trained himself since childhood, and suffered hardship for one thousand, seven hundred and fifty kalpas. Each kalpa is 129,600 years, so you can work out for yourself how long it has taken him to be able to enjoy this great and infinite Way. But you are a beast who has only just become a man for the first time. How dare you talk so big? You're not human, not even human! I'll shorten your life-span. Accept my teaching at once and stop talking such nonsense! Otherwise you'll be in for trouble and your life will very shortly be over; and that will be so much the worse for your original form too.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Although he has trained himself for a long time, ever since he was a child, he still has no right to occupy this place for ever,&#8221; the Great Sage said. &#8220;As the saying goes, 'Emperors are made by turn; next year it may be me.' If he can be persuaded to move out and make Heaven over to me, that'll be fine. But if he doesn't abdicate in my favour I'll most certainly make things hot for him, and he'll never know peace and quiet again.&#8221;</p>
<P>&#8220;What have you got, besides immortality and the ability to transform yourself, that gives you the nerve to try to seize the Heavenly Palace?&#8221; the Buddha asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I can do many tricks indeed,&#8221; the Great Sage replied. &#8220;I can perform seventy-two transformations, and I can preserve my youth for ten thousand kalpas. I can ride a somersault cloud that takes me thirty-six thousand miles at a single jump. So why shouldn't I sit on the throne of Heaven?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll have a wager with you then,&#8221; said the Buddha. &#8220;If you're clever enough to get out of my right hand with a single somersault, you will be the winner, and there will be no more need for weapons or fighting: I shall invite the Jade Emperor to come and live in the West and abdicate the Heavenly Palace to you. But if you can't get out of the palm of my hand you will have to go down to the world below as a devil and train yourself for several more kalpas before coming to argue about it again.&#8221;</p>

<p>佛祖听言，呵呵冷笑道：“你那厮乃是个猴子成精，焉敢欺心，要夺玉皇上帝尊位？他自幼修持，苦历过一千七百五十劫。每劫该十二万九千六百年。你算，他该多少年数，方能享受此无极大道？你那个初世为人的畜生，如何出此大言！不当人子，不当人子！折了你的寿算！趁早皈依，切莫胡说！但恐遭了毒手，性命顷刻而休，可惜了你的本来面目！”大圣道：“他虽年劫修长，也不应久占在此。常言道，皇帝轮流做，明年到我家。只教他搬出去，将天宫让与我，便罢了；若还不让，定要搅攘，永不清平！”佛祖道：“你除了长生变化之法，再有何能，敢占天宫胜境？”大圣道：“我的手段多哩！我有七十二般变化，万劫不老长生。会驾筋斗云，一纵十万八千里。如何坐不得天位？”佛祖道：“我与你打个赌赛：你若有本事，一筋斗打出我这右手掌中，算你赢，再不用动刀兵苦争战，就请玉帝到西方居住，把天宫让你；若不能打出手掌，你还下界为妖，再修几劫，却来争吵。”</p>

<P>When he heard this offer the Great Sage smiled to himself and thought, &#8220;This Buddha is a complete idiot. I can cover thirty-six thousand miles with a somersault, so how could I fail to jump out of the palm of his hand, which is less than a foot across?&#8221;</P>

<P>With this in his mind he asked eagerly, &#8220;Do you guarantee that yourself?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; the Buddha replied, and he stretched out his right hand, which seemed to be about the size of a lotus leaf. Putting away his As-You-Will cudgel, the Great Sage summoned up all his divine powers, jumped into the palm of the Buddha's hand, and said, &#8220;I'm off.&#8221; Watch him as he goes like a streak of light and disappears completely. The Buddha, who was watching him with his wise eyes, saw the Monkey King whirling forward like a windmill and not stopping until he saw five flesh-pink pillars topped by dark vapours.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is the end of the road,&#8221; he said, &#8220;so now I'll go back. The Buddha will be witness, and the Hall of Miraculous Mist will be mine.&#8221; Then he thought again, &#8220;Wait a moment. I'll leave my mark here to prove my case when I talk to the Buddha.&#8221; He pulled out a hair, breathed on it with his magic breath, and shouted &#8220;Change.&#8221; It turned into a writing brush dipped in ink, and with it he wrote THE GREAT SAGE EQUALING HEAVEN WAS HERE in big letters on the middle pillar. When that was done he put the hair back on, and, not standing on his dignity, made a pool of monkey piss at the foot of the pillar. Then he turned his somersault round and went back to where he had started from.</P>
<P>&#8220;I went, and now I'm back. Tell the Jade Emperor to hand the Heavenly Palace over to me,&#8221; he said, standing in the Buddha's palm.</P>
<P>&#8220;I've got you, you piss-spirit of a monkey,&#8221; roared the Buddha at him. &#8220;You never left the palm of my hand.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're wrong there,&#8221; the Great Sage replied. &#8220;I went to the farthest point of Heaven, where I saw five flesh-pink pillars topped by dark vapours. I left my mark there: do you dare come and see it with me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no need to go. Just look down.&#8221; The Great Sage looked down with his fire eyes with golden pupils to see the words &#8220;The Great Sage Equaling Heaven Was Here&#8221; written on the middle finger of the Buddha's right hand. The stink of monkey-piss rose from the fold at the bottom of the finger.</P>
<P>&#8220;What a thing to happen,&#8221; exclaimed the Great Sage in astonishment. &#8220;I wrote this on one of the pillars supporting the sky, so how can it be on his finger now? He must have used divination to know what I was going to do. I don't believe it. I refuse to believe it! I'll go there and come back again.&#8221;</p>

<p>那大圣闻言，暗笑道：“这如来十分好呆！我老孙一筋斗去十万八千里。他那手掌，方圆不满一尺，如何跳不出去？”急发声道：“既如此说，你可做得主张？”佛祖道：“做得，做得！”伸开右手，却似个荷叶大小。那大圣收了如意棒，抖擞神威，将身一纵，站在佛祖手心里，却道声：“我出去也！”你看他一路云光，无影无形去了。佛祖慧眼观看，见那猴王风车子一般相似不住，只管前进。大圣行时，忽见有五根肉红柱子，撑着一股青气。他道：“此间乃尽头路了。这番回去，如来作证，灵霄宫定是我坐也。”又思量说：“且住！等我留下些记号，方好与如来说话。”拔下一根毫毛，吹口仙气，叫：“变！”变作一管浓墨双毫笔，在那中间柱子上写一行大字云：“齐天大圣到此一游。”写毕，收了毫毛。又不庄尊，却在第一根柱子根下撒了一泡猴尿。翻转筋斗云，径回本处，站在如来掌内道：“我已去，今来了。你教玉帝让天宫与我。”如来骂道：“我把你这个尿精猴子！你正好不曾离了我掌哩！”大圣道：“你是不知。我去到天尽头，见五根肉红柱，撑着一股青气，我留个记在那里，你敢和我同去看么！”如来道：“不消去，你只自低头看看。”那大圣睁圆火眼金睛，低头看时，原来佛祖右手中指写着“齐天大圣到此一游”。大指丫里，还有些猴尿臊气，大圣吃了一惊道：“有这等事，有这等事！我将此字写在撑天柱子上，如何却在他手指上？莫非有个未卜先知的法术。我决不信，不信！等我再去来！”</p>

<P>The dear Great Sage hurriedly braced himself to jump, but the Buddha turned his hand over and pushed the Monkey King out through the Western Gate of Heaven.

<P>When he had eliminated the monkey fiend the Buddha told Ananda and Kasyapa to return with him to the Western paradise. At that moment Tian Peng and Tian You hurried out of the Hall of Miraculous Mist to say, &#8220;We beg the Tathagata to wait a moment as the Jade Emperor's chariot is coming.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Buddha turned round and looked up, and an instant later he saw an eight-splendour imperial chariot and a nine-shining jeweled canopy appear to the sound of strange and exquisite music, and the chanting of countless sacred verses. Precious flowers were scattered and incense was burned.</P>
<P>The Jade Emperor went straight up to the Buddha and said, &#8220;We are deeply indebted to the great Buddha's powers for wiping out the demon, and we hope that the Tathagata will spend a day here so that we may invite all the Immortals to a feast of thanksgiving.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Buddha did not dare refuse, so putting his hands together he replied, &#8220;This old monk only came here in obedience to Your Celestial Majesty's command. What magic powers can I pretend to? This was all due to the wonderful good fortune of Your Celestial Majesty and the other gods. How could I possibly allow you to thank me?&#8221;</P>
<P>The Jade Emperor then ordered all the gods of the Department of Thunder to split up and invite the Three Pure Ones, the Four Emperors, the Five Ancients, the Six Superintendents, the Seven Main Stars, the Eight Points of the Compass, the Nine Bright Shiners, the Ten Chiefs, the Thousand Immortals, and the Ten Thousand Sages to a banquet to thank the Buddha for his mercy. Then he ordered the Four Great Heavenly Teachers and the Nine Heavenly Maidens to open the golden gates of the jade capital, and Palace of the Great Mystery, and the Tong Yang Jade Palace, invite the Tathagata to take his seat on the Throne of the Seven Precious Things, arrange the places for all the different groups of guests, and set out the dragon liver, phoenix bone-marrow, jade liquor, and magic peaches.</p>

<P>The Buddha accepted this commission and said, &#8220;Since you want a name for it, we could call it the 'Banquet to Celebrate Peace in Heaven.'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Splendid, 'Banquet to Celebrate Peace in Heaven,' splendid,&#8221; exclaimed all the Immortals with one voice, and then they all sat down in their places, put flowers in their hair, and played the lyre. It was indeed a splendid banquet, and here are some verses to prove it:</p>

The Venerable Ananda took it through the gates of Heaven and pasted it firmly to a square boulder on the top of the Five Elements Mountain. When this was done the mountain sank roots and joined up all its seams. The Monkey King was still able to breathe and he could still stick his hands out and move them.

<div class="poet">
<P>His great power grew as he humbled the mighty,</P>
<P>He used his wicked talents to subdue tigers and dragons.</P>
<P>He stole the peaches and wine as he wandered round Heaven,</P>
<P>Was graciously given office in the Jade Capital.</P>
<br />


<P>When his wickedness went too far his body suffered,</P>
<P>But his roots of goodness were not severed, and his breath still rose.</P>
<P>He will escape from the hand of the Buddha,</P>
<P>And wait till the Tang produces a saintly monk.</p>

<div class="right"><div class="poet">
<p>伏逞豪强大势兴，降龙伏虎弄乖能。</P>
<P>偷桃偷酒游天府，受箓承恩在玉京。</p>
<br />

<p>恶贯满盈身受困，善根不绝气还升。</P>
<P>果然脱得如来手，且待唐朝出圣僧。</p>
