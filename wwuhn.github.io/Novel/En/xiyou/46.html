<P>In the Hall of the Three Pure Ones the Great Sage Leaves His Name</P>
<P>In the Kingdom of Tarrycart the Monkey King Shows His Powers</P>
</div>
<P>The story tells how the Great Sage Monkey pinched Friar Sand with his left hand and Pig with his right. The two of them realized what was happening and sat there on high, their heads bowed in silence, while the Taoists lit their lamps and shone them all around as they searched. The three of them looked just as if they really were made of clay covered with gold leaf.</P>
<P>&#8220;If no evildoers have been here,&#8221; said the Great Immortal Tiger Power, &#8220;how have the offerings all been eaten?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It looks as though people have eaten them,&#8221; said the Great Immortal Deer Power. &#8220;The fruit with skins has all been peeled and the stones have all been spat out of the stone fruit. But why can't we see anybody?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There is no need to be so suspicious, brother,&#8221; said the Great Immortal Antelope Power. &#8220;I think that the Heavenly Honoured Ones must have been moved by our reverence and respect in reciting scriptures and making readings day and night, and by the name of His Majesty. Evidently the Three Pure Lords came down to the mortal world to enjoy these offerings. I suggest that we should worship the Heavenly Honoured Ones before they fly away on their cranes. We should beg them for some holy water and golden elixir pills that we can present to His Majesty and thereby win credit for giving him immortality.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;A good idea,&#8221; said Tiger Power. &#8220;Let there be music and recitation, my disciples,&#8221; he ordered, &#8220;and bring me my ceremonial robes so that I may pace out the Dipper dance and pray for immortality for His Majesty.&#8221;</P>
<P>The young Taoists did as they were told and were soon neatly drawn up in two groups. At the sound of a stone chime they all began to recite in unison the<I> True Classic of the Way and Its Power of the Yellow Court.</I> Throwing his religious cloak over his shoulders, Tiger Power took his jade tablet in his hands, performed the ritual dance raising the dust before the statues, prostrated himself in respect, and submitted the following memorial to the Pure Ones:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;In fear and trembling I bow my head in submission. We your subjects promote the faith and long for your pure emptiness. We are suppressing the low vulgarity of Buddhist monks and gaining respect for the brilliance of the Way. A holy temple has been built by command of His Majesty the King. Many an offering has been set out, and the dragon banners hang high; candles burn all night, and incense smokes throughout the day. We worship with complete sincerity, respect and devotion. Now that you have honoured us with your presence we beseech you before you go away in your immortal chariots to grant us tablets of golden elixir and holy water that we may present to His Majesty to bring him life as long as the Southern Hills.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Pig felt most uncomfortable at all this, and he murmured under his breath to Monkey, &#8220;We shouldn't have stayed to be prayed to after eating the stuff. How are we going to answer their prayers?&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey gave him another pinch, opened his mouth, and called out, &#8220;Cease your worship, young immortals. We have just come from a Peach Banquet, so we did not bring any golden elixir or holy water today. We will present you with some another day.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the priests young and old heard the statue speaking they all twitched at their clothes and trembled as they said, &#8220;My lord, a living Heavenly Honoured One has come down to earth. Don't let him go. Whatever you do get him to give us a recipe for eternal life.&#8221;</P>
<P>Tiger Power then stepped forward, bowed again, and said, &#8220;Raising the dust while kowtowing in the sincerity of my heart, your humble servant dutifully worships the Three Pure Ones. Since coming to this country we have promoted the Way and suppressed the Buddhist clergy. His Majesty adores the Way and respectfully wishes to prolong his years, which is why we held this great service to heaven and recited scriptures all night. We are most fortunate that you Heavenly Honoured Ones have not disdained from descending in your holy chariots and have appeared in person. We beg you in your mercy to grant us the great boon of a little holy water to lengthen the lives of your disciples.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They must be desperate to get it, praying for it again,&#8221; muttered Friar Sand under his breath to Monkey, giving him a pinch.</P>
<P>&#8220;Then let's give them some,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;But where will we get it?&#8221; mumbled Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;Watch me,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;When I get some, you'll have some too.&#8221; The Taoists had by now finished playing their music.</P>
<P>&#8220;Young immortals,&#8221; said Brother Monkey, &#8220;there is no need to prostrate yourselves. I did not originally want to leave any holy water with you in case it destroyed your offspring of immortality, but there would be no difficulty at all about giving you some.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the Taoists heard this they all prostrated themselves, kowtowed and said, &#8220;We beg and implore the Heavenly Honoured One to grant your disciples some in recognition of the respectful devotion. We have widely taught the Way and its power and won the respect of the king for our sect of mystery.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well then,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;fetch a vessel.&#8221; The Taoists all once again kowtowed in thanks: Tiger Power, who liked to show off, carried in a great earthen jar that he placed in the hall. Deer Power put an earthenware dish on the table for offerings, and Antelope Power took the flowers out of a vase and put it between the other two containers.</P>
<P>&#8220;Withdraw from the hall, all of you,&#8221; ordered Monkey, &#8220;and screen us off. The secrets of Heaven must not be revealed. Then we can give you some holy water.&#8221; The priests then all prostrated themselves below the steps outside the hall and shut the doors.</P>
<P>Monkey then stood up, lifted his tiger-skin kilt, and filled the vase with stinking piss, to the delight of Pig, who said, &#8220;In all the years we've been brothers we've never done this before. I've just eaten, and you ask me to do such a thing.&#8221; The idiot then lifted his clothes and noisily filled the earthenware dish. The sound was like that of a torrent pouring down a mountainside. Friar Sand half filled the earthen jar.</P>
<P>Then they all straightened their clothes, sat down again, and said, &#8220;Come and receive the holy water, young immortals.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Taoist elders then pushed the screens aside and kowtowed in worship and gratitude. When the jar was carried out and put together with the vase and the dish they called, &#8220;Disciples, fetch me a cup to try some.&#8221; The younger Taoists fetched a teacup and handed it to the elders. The elder filled the cup, drained it, and made a show of wiping his mouth and smacking his lips.</P>
<P>&#8220;Is it good, brother?&#8221; asked Deer Power.</P>
<P>Pursing his lips together, the most senior of the elders said, &#8220;Not very. Tastes a bit off.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Let me have a taste,&#8221; said Antelope Power. When he had drunk a mouthful he said, &#8220;Tastes rather like pig's urine.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this from where he was sitting up there he realized that his plans had been foiled. &#8220;I'm going to play a trick just for the hell of it for them to remember me by.&#8221; Then he shouted:</P>
<P>&#8220;Oh, Way, Oh Way, what nonsense you imagine. What Three Pure Ones would ever descend to earth? Let me tell you our real names. We are Buddhist monks from the Great Tang, travelling West on imperial orders. Having nothing else to do this pleasant evening we decided to come down to your temple halls. We had eaten the offerings and were sitting here chatting when you started kowtowing to us and worshipping<B></B> us. How did you expect us to reply. What you've been drinking there<B></B> isn't holy water&#8212;it's our piss.&#8221;</P>
<P>Hearing this the Taoist priests shut the doors and started throwing rakes, brooms, tiles and stones wildly into the hall. Splendid Brother Monkey tucked Friar Sand under his left arm and Pig under his right, rushed out through the door and rode his cloud straight back to the abbot's lodgings in the Deep Wisdom Monastery. The three of them went back to bed without disturbing their master.</P>
<P>It was soon the third quarter of the fifth watch, when the king held his dawn court audience, at which the civil and military officials and the four hundred courtiers were all assembled under the crimson light of the silken lanterns and amid clouds of smoke from the incense burners.</P>
<P>At just this time the Tang Priest woke up and called, &#8220;Disciples, come with me when I go to show my passport and obtain an exit permit.&#8221; Monkey, Pig and Friar Sand got out of bed and into their clothes quickly, then stood waiting in attendance on the master.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; Monkey reported, &#8220;the king here trusts those Taoist priests. He promotes the Way and persecutes Buddhist monks. I'm afraid that if you say the wrong thing he'll refuse you an exit permit. We had better escort you to the palace.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Tang Priest was delighted with this suggestion. He put on his brocade cassock, Monkey took the passport, Pig carried the begging bowl and Friar Sand the monastic staff. The luggage and the horse were entrusted to the care of the monks of the Deep Wisdom Monastery. They went straight to the Tower of Five Phoenixes at the palace gate, where they bowed to the eunuch on duty and told him their names. They said that they were monks from Great Tang in the East on their way to fetch the scriptures who had come to show their papers and obtain an exit permit, and they asked him to pass the message on.</P>
<P>The officer of the gate went straight to the throne hall where he prostrated himself by the steps and reported, &#8220;There are four monks outside awaiting Your Majesty's command by the Tower of Five Phoenixes. They say they are from the Great Tang in the East and going to fetch scriptures.&#8221; To this the king replied, &#8220;Do they have to come looking for their deaths here? Can't they do it anywhere else? Why didn't the police capture them and bring them here under arrest?&#8221;</P>
<P>The king's tutor slipped forward to submit this memorial: &#8220;Great Tang in the East is in the Southern Continent of Jambu. It is known as the great land of China. It is over three thousand miles from here, and the way is beset with many a demon. These monks must have some magic powers if they dared to travel West. I beg You Majesty to receive these monks who have come from the far country of China, inspect their travel papers, and let them proceed. Then you will be preserving good relations with China.&#8221; The king approved this suggestion. The Tang Priest and his disciples were summoned to the throne hall, where they stood in a row before the steps and submitted their travel document to the king.</P>
<P>The king had just opened the document and started reading it when the eunuch gate officer came in to report again, &#8220;The three Teachers of the Nation are here.&#8221; This threw the king into such a fluster that he put the paper away, hurried down from the throne, told his attendants to fetch embroidered stools, and went out to meet the Taoist masters.</P>
<P>Sanzang and his disciples turned round to look and saw the three Great Immortals come majestically in, followed by a pair of page boys with their hair in bunches. They walked straight in while the civil and military officers all bowed low, not daring to look up.</P>
<P>As they entered the throne hall they did not deign to bow to the king, who asked them, &#8220;Teachers of the Nation, why have you honoured us with your presence although we have not yet invited you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have something to report,&#8221; the most senior of the Taoists replied. &#8220;Where are those four Buddhist monks from?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They have been sent from Great Tang in the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven,&#8221; the king replied, &#8220;and they are here to obtain an exit permit.&#8221; The three Taoists clapped their hands with delight at this news.</P>
<P>&#8220;We thought they had already gone, but they are still here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean, Teachers?&#8221; the king asked in astonishment. &#8220;They have only just come to report their names. I was on the point of handing them over to you to use as you will when my tutor made a very sensible suggestion. Out of consideration for the great distance they have come and also to preserve good relations with the land of China I sent for them a moment ago and was just examining their papers when you three Teachers raised this question. Have they offended or harmed you?&#8221;</P>
<P>To this the Taoist replied with a smile, &#8220;What Your Majesty does not yet know is that they arrived yesterday, killed two of our disciples outside the East Gate, released the five hundred captive Buddhist monks, smashed our cart, broke into our temple at night, destroyed the statues of the Three Pure Ones, and stole their offerings. We were so deceived by them that we though they were Heavenly Honoured Ones come down to earth and asked them for holy water and elixir pills to present to Your Majesty in the hope of securing eternal life for you. We never expected them to make fools of us by giving us urine. We each drank a mouthful to taste, but when we tried to capture them they escaped. If they are still here now it's a case of meeting your enemy on a narrow road.&#8221; All this made the king so angry that he ordered the execution of the four monks.</P>
<P>The Great Sage Monkey put his hands together and began to yell at the top of his voice, &#8220;Please hold back your thunderous wrath for a moment, Your Majesty, and allow us Buddhist monks to make our submission.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You have offended the Teachers of the Nation,&#8221; the king replied, &#8220;and what they say is always right.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He accuses me of coming here yesterday and killing two of his disciples,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;What witnesses does he have? Even if we admitted the killing you need only execute two of us monks to pay for their lives and you could release the other two to fetch the scriptures. He doesn't have any witnesses either for his accusations that I smashed their cart and freed the captive monks. Even if I had done, that wouldn't be a capital offence. To punish one more of us would be enough. When he says I destroyed the statues of the Three Pure Ones and made havoc in the Taoist temple he's deliberately trying to frame and murder me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why?&#8221; the king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;We are all from the East,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and have only just arrived here. We don't even know our way round the streets, so how could we possibly know what happened in his temple in the middle of the night? If we had given them some piss they should have arrested us on the spot. They shouldn't make up these terrible accusations now. There are any number of people in the world who give false names. He could not possibly tell that it was me. I hope Your Majesty will turn your wrath aside and have these charges properly investigated.&#8221; The king had been wild with fury before, but now that he had heard what Monkey had to say he could not make up his mind.</P>
<P>As the king was wondering what to do the eunuch gate officer came in once more to report, &#8220;Your Majesty, there is a crowd of village elders outside the gates awaiting your summons.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do they want?&#8221; the king asked, and ordered them to be sent in.</P>
<P>Thirty or forty of them were brought before the throne hall, where they kowtowed to the king and said, &#8220;Your Majesty, there has been no rain this spring and we fear a drought this summer. We have come here to submit a request to Your Majesty that you invite the Teachers of the Nation to pray for timely rain that will save the common people.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You may withdraw,&#8221; said the king. &#8220;There will be rain.&#8221; The elders thanked him for his mercy and withdrew. &#8220;Tang monks,&#8221; said the king, &#8220;do you know why we honour the Way and persecute Buddhist monks? When the Buddhist monks of this country prayed for rain some years ago they did not get a single drop. It was fortunate that Heaven sent down to us the Teachers of the Nation to bring help and deliverance. You have come from afar and offended the Teachers of the Nation, and you thoroughly deserve to be punished for it. If I spare you for the time being, will you enter a rainmaking competition with the Teachers of the Nation? If you can bring about a good fall of rain that saves the common people we shall pardon your crimes, return your paper, and let you go. If you fail you will all be taken to the place of execution and publicly executed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We humble monks know how to pray for things,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Hearing this, the king ordered that the altars be swept clean and sent for his carriage as he was going to watch the ritual from the Tower of Five Phoenixes. The officials then moved him in his carriage to the tower, where he was soon seated. The Tang Priest stood at the foot of the tower with Monkey, Friar Sand and Pig, while the three Taoist masters sat with the king in the tower. Before long an official galloped in to report, &#8220;Everything is ready at the altar. Will the Teacher of the Nation please come to the altar?&#8221;</P>
<P>The Great Immortal Tiger Power bowed to take his leave of the king and descended from the tower. Brother Monkey blocked his way and said, &#8220;Where are you going, sir?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;To the altar to pray for rain,&#8221; the immortal replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;You're being too arrogant,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Why don't you show some courtesy to us monks from far away? Oh well, 'a mighty dragon can't crush a snake in its lair.' You go first, but you'll have to explain to His Majesty.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Explain what?&#8221; the Great Immortal asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;If we both pray for rain at the altar,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;how will we know whether it's your rain or mine? It'll be hard to tell who should get the credit.&#8221; When the king heard this up on his tower he was discreetly delighted as he said, &#8220;That little monk talks sense.&#8221;</P>
<P>Friar Sand too hid a smile as he thought, &#8220;The king doesn't realize that Monkey hasn't even started showing how much sense he has in him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No explanations will be needed,&#8221; said the immortal. &#8220;Of course His Majesty will know whose the rain is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm sure he will,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;but we monks from far away have never met you before. If later on both sides made false claims that would be terrible. We must have it all sorted out before we start.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When I go to the altar,&#8221; said the Great Immortal, &#8220;this magic wand of mine will give the signal. When it first sounds, the wind will come. The second time the clouds will rise. The third time it will bring thunder and lightning. The fourth time it will rain. The fifth time the clouds will break up and the rain will finish.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Splendid,&#8221; said Monkey with a laugh. &#8220;I've never seen anything like that. Please go ahead.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Great Immortal then strode straight to the gates of the altar compound followed by Sanzang and his disciples. They looked up to see a raised terrace over thirty feet high. To the left and right of it were planted banners bearing the sign of the twenty-eight zodiacal constellations, and clouds of fragrant smoke rose from an incense-burner on a table set at the highest point on the altar. At each end of the table was a candle-holder with candles burning brightly. Beside the incense-burner was a golden tablet inscribed with the titles of the gods of thunder, and below the burner were five great vats all filled with clean water. Sprigs of willow floated on them, and on the willow was an iron plaque bearing the talisman of the Commander of Thunder. To the left and right of these were five stout posts on which were written the names of the five barbarian thunder heralds. By each post stood two Taoist priests ready to strike them with iron hammers. Behind the terrace many Taoist priests were writing things out, and in the middle of them was a stove for burning paper and some model figures representing the messengers who carried the charms and the local gods who supported the Taoist teachings.</P>
<P>The Great Immortal walked straight into the altar enclosure and without any show of modesty went straight up the altar mound and took his place. A young Taoist at his side handed him several yellow pieces of paper that had spells written on them and a precious sword. Holding the sword the Great Immortal recited a spell and burnt a spell on a candle. Two or three of the young Taoists standing below the altar mound passed him a model figure holding a spell and a written document, both of which he also lit and burnt. Then there was a loud report from the wand, and up in the sky the signs of a wind blowing up could be seen.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is bad,&#8221; muttered Pig. &#8220;The Taoist really has got some powers. He just had to sound his wand once to make the wind blow.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Keep quiet, brothers,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;and don't say anything else to me. Look after the master while I get busy.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage then plucked out one of his hairs, blew on it with magic breath, called &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned it into an imitation Monkey who stood by the Tang Priest while his true self escaped, rose up into the air and shouted, &#8220;Who's in charge of the wind?&#8221; This threw Granny Wind into such a fluster that she held her cloth bag closed while Young Master Xun tied the string round the mouth. They both came forward and bowed to him.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm protecting the holy priest from Tang on his journey to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;We're now having a rainmaking competition with an evil Taoist in the country of Tarrycart. Why are you helping him instead of me? If you put your wind away I'll let you off, but if there's even enough wind to move a whisker in that Taoist's beard I'll give you twenty strokes each with my iron cudgel.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We wouldn't dare help him,&#8221; said Granny Wind, and the wind then stopped.</P>
<P>In his impatience Pig started to yell wildly, &#8220;Give up, give up. You've sounded your wand and there's not a breath of wind. Come down now and let us go up.&#8221;</P>
<P>Once again the Taoist took his magic wand, burnt spells, and made a report with the wand. The sky filled with clouds.</P>
<P>&#8220;Who's spreading the clouds out?&#8221; the Great Sage asked up overhead. Boy Cloudpusher and Young Lord Mistspreader bowed to him. Once again Monkey explained what had happened; Cloudpusher and Mistspreader put the clouds away, and the sun shone brightly once more in a clear sky.</P>
<P>&#8220;This teacher has been fooling the king and hoodwinking the common people,&#8221; laughed Pig. &#8220;He doesn't really have any powers at all. His wand has sounded for the second time, and there's not a cloud to be seen.&#8221;</P>
<P>By now the Taoist was getting anxious. Leaning on his sword he let down his hair, said the words of a spell, and cracked his magic wand for the third time. From the Southern Gate of Heaven the Heavenly Lord Deng led Grandfather Thunder and Mother Lightning to bow to Monkey in mid-air. Monkey told them what had happened and asked, &#8220;Why are you being so dutiful? What sort of orders are they you're obeying?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That Taoist really does know the Five Laws of Thunder,&#8221; the Heavenly Lord Deng replied. &#8220;He issued the right document, burned the summons, and alarmed the Jade Emperor, who issued an edict to the offices of the Universal Honoured One of the Ninth Heaven Who Responds to the Primal with the Sound of Thunder. We are going on imperial orders to help Grandfather Thunder and Mother Lightning make rain.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case you'd better stay where you are and let me sort things out,&#8221; said Monkey; and indeed the thunder did not sound, nor did the lightning flash.</P>
<P>The Taoist was becoming more anxious than ever. He lit more incense-sticks, burnt charms, said incantations, and sounded his wand once more. The dragon kings of the four seas all gathered in mid-air. &#8220;Where are you going, Ao Guang?&#8221; Monkey asked. The four dragon kings Ao Guang, Ao Shun, Ao Qin and Ao Run came up and bowed to him.</P>
<P>He told them what had happened then said, &#8220;When I troubled you the other day you didn't succeed. I hope you will help me again today.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We hear and obey,&#8221; replied the dragon kings.</P>
<P>Monkey then thanked Ao Shun: &#8220;I am very grateful to your son for capturing the monster and saving my master the other day.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That wretch is being kept in chains in the sea,&#8221; the dragon king Ao Shun replied. &#8220;I have not ventured to deal with him on my own initiative, and I would like to ask you, Great Sage, to decide on his sentence.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Deal with him however you think fit,&#8221; replied Monkey. &#8220;Now I would like you to do me a good turn. That Taoist has now sounded his wand four times, so it's my turn to perform now. As I don't know how to use charms, burn talismans, or sound a magic wand I'll have to ask you gentlemen to help me out.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We would not dare disobey a command from the Great Sage,&#8221; Heavenly Lord Deng replied. &#8220;But we can only act when proper orders are given. Otherwise the thunder and the rain will happen at the wrong times, and the Great Sage will lose his credibility.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll give the signs with my cudgel,&#8221; said Monkey, to the horror of Grandfather Thunder, who protested, &#8220;But my lord, none of us can take your cudgel.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;I won't be hitting you with it. When I point up with it the first time I want wind.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We'll let the wind out,&#8221; promised Granny Wind and Young Master Xun.</P>
<P>&#8220;The second time I point up I want clouds.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We'll spread out the clouds,&#8221; said Cloudpusher and Mistspreader.</P>
<P>&#8220;The third time I point up with the cudgel I want thunder and lightning.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We shall obey, we shall obey,&#8221; said Grandfather Thunder and Mother Lightning.</P>
<P>&#8220;The fourth time I point up with the cudgel I want rain.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your orders will be carried out,&#8221; the dragon kings replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;And the fifth time I point up with the cudgel I want the sun shining in a clear sky. I won't have any disobedience or mistakes.&#8221;</P>
<P>Having given his orders Monkey brought his cloud down, shook his hair, and put it back on his body. None of those with mortal, fleshly eyes could see what had happened. Monkey then called out in a loud voice, &#8220;Please finish now, teacher. You have sounded your magic wand four times without producing any wind, clouds, thunder or rain. It's my turn now.&#8221; The Taoist could stay at the altar no longer; he had to come down and allow Monkey to take his place while he went with a long face to climb the tower to see the king. &#8220;Wait while I go up with him and hear what he has to say,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>He heard the king asking, &#8220;Why was there no wind or rain when you sounded your magic wand four times? We are listening most carefully.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The dragons are all out today,&#8221; the Taoist replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; yelled Monkey, &#8220;today the dragons are all in. It was just that the Teacher of the Nation's magic didn't work and he couldn't get them to come. Just watch how we Buddhist monks can make them come.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Climb to the altar then,&#8221; said the king. &#8220;We shall remain here and await rain.&#8221;</P>
<P>As soon as he received this command Brother Monkey hurried to the altar compound, tugged at the Tang Priest's clothes, and said, &#8220;Master, please climb the altar mound.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But I do not know how to pray for rain, disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;He's trying to murder you,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;If there's still no rain they'll bring firewood along and send you up in flames.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You may not know how to pray for rain,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;but you're good at reciting scriptures. I'll help you.&#8221; Only then did the venerable elder start to climb to the altar. When he reached the top he sat down with great dignity, settled his nature, brought his spirit under control, and quietly recited the<I> Prajna-paramita Heart Sutra.</I> As he sat there an official messenger galloped up to him to ask, &#8220;Monk, why aren't you sounding a magic wand or burning charms and summonses?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He doesn't need to,&#8221; Monkey shouted back. &#8220;We pray in stillness and silence.&#8221; The official returned to the king to report this reply.</P>
<P>When Monkey heard that his master had finished reciting the sutra he produced his cudgel from his ear, waved it in the breeze to make it about twelve feet long and as thick as a ricebowl, and pointed it towards the sky. As soon as Granny Wind saw it she opened her leather bag while Young Master Xun untied the rope round its mouth. There was then the howling of a wind that tore off tiles and sent bricks flying throughout the city. It was evidently a splendid wind, not at all like ordinary ones:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Willow were broken and flowers hurt,</P>
<P>Trees blown down in devastated woods.</P>
<P>The walls collapsed in halls of nine stories;</P>
<P>Beams and columns were shaken in the Five Phoenix Tower.</P>
<P>In the sky the red sun turned dark,</P>
<P>And the yellow dust of the earth began to fly.</P>
<P>The officers before the reviewing stand were scared;</P>
<P>Terror struck the civil officials in their hall.</P>
<P>The beauties of the harem had their hair blown untidy;</P>
<P>The royal consorts' coiffures were all ruined.</P>
<P>Tassels fell from the coronets of nobles;</P>
<P>The black silk hat of the premier took wing.</P>
<P>The king was too terrified to speak,</P>
<P>The eunuchs could not hand in their reports.</P>
<P>Senior officials stood in disorder,</P>
<P>High-level functionaries broke ranks.</P>
<P>Coloured pavilions and turquoise screens were ruined;</P>
<P>Green windows and crimson doors were wrecked.</P>
<P>Bricks and tiles flew from the throne hall;</P>
<P>In the Brocade Cloud Chamber doors leaned and partition were smashed.</P>
<P>Vicious indeed was this terrible gale,</P>
<P>Making hard for the king to see his sons,</P>
<P>And driving the people from streets and markets:</P>
<P>Every household firmly shut its doors.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Just as this gale was at its height Brother Monkey gave another display of his divine powers as he pointed his gold-banded cudgel up into the sky for the second time. What could then be seen was:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Boy Cloudpusher,</P>
<P>Young Lord Mistspreader.</P>
<P>The Boy Cloudpusher showed his divine magic,</P>
<P>Making great rocklike heaps that hung down from the sky;</P>
<P>Young Lord Mistspreader used his powers .</P>
<P>To cover the earth with thick, dense fog.</P>
<P>All was dark in the three markets;</P>
<P>Black were the six main streets of the city.</P>
<P>Leaving the sea together with the wind,</P>
<P>They appeared with the rain in the Kunlun Mountains,</P>
<P>Filled heaven and earth in an instant,</P>
<P>Immediately covered the mortal world.</P>
<P>All was reduced to obscurity</P>
<P>And the doors of the Five Phoenix Tower disappeared.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In an instant there was dense fog and thick clouds everywhere. Monkey then pointed his gold-banded cudgel into the air a third time, with alarming results:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Grandfather Thunder was angry,</P>
<P>Mother Lightning was furious.</P>
<P>Grandfather Thunder was angry</P>
<P>As he rode backwards on his fire beast down from Heaven;</P>
<P>Mother Lightning was furious</P>
<P>As she left her Dipper Palace lashing out with her golden snake.</P>
<P>The thunder crashed and roared,</P>
<P>Shaking the Iron Fork Mountain;</P>
<P>Brilliant flashes of red silk</P>
<P>Flew from the Eastern Ocean.</P>
<P>The noise rumbled like carts;</P>
<P>The flashes were like rice plants gleaming in the wind.</P>
<P>The spirit of all living shoots revived,</P>
<P>Many a sleeping insect came to life.</P>
<P>It terrified monarch and subject alike;</P>
<P>The sound made merchants nervously active.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The thunder roared with the noise of an earthquake or a landslide, so frightening the people in the city that they all burnt incense and imitation money. &#8220;Deng,&#8221; shouted Monkey familiarly, &#8220;make sure that you kill me a few more corrupt officials who twist the laws and disobedient sons who do not do their duty to their parents as an example to the people.&#8221; The thunder became louder than ever, and Monkey pointed his cudgel upwards for the fourth time.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The dragons gave their orders</P>
<P>And ram filled Heaven and earth,</P>
<P>As if the river in the sky was filling the heavenly gulf,</P>
<P>And as fast as clouds passing over the ocean's gates.</P>
<P>It pattered on the roof of the tower,</P>
<P>Splashed against the windows.</P>
<P>Now that the river in the sky had flooded,</P>
<P>White waves rolled along the streets.</P>
<P>They moved around like a dish being picked up,</P>
<P>Splashed like water being tipped from a bowl.</P>
<P>The lonely farm's houses were almost covered by the flood,</P>
<P>Which was nearly as high as the bridge across the river.</P>
<P>The mulberry fields indeed were turning into sea,</P>
<P>And dry land was under water in an instant.</P>
<P>This was the help the dragons gave,</P>
<P>As they lifted the Yangtse and poured the water down.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The rain started at about eight in the morning and lasted till around noon, by when all the streets inside and outside the capital of Tarrycart were running with water. The king then issued a command: &#8220;Enough rain has fallen now. If there is any more the growing crops will be drowned and it will be a disaster.&#8221;</P>
<P>The officer on duty at the foot of the Tower of Five Phoenixes whipped his horse and rode through the rain to say, &#8220;Holy monk, that is enough rain.&#8221; Hearing this, Monkey pointed his gold-banded cudgel towards the sky again, and at once the thunder stopped, the wind fell, the rain ceased and the clouds scattered.</P>
<P>The king was delighted, and all the civil and military officials said in admiration, &#8220;What a marvellous monk. How true it is that however good you are at something there's always somebody better. Our Teachers of the Nation are very effective at making rain, but when they ask for fine weather the drizzle goes on for hours before clearing up. However can this monk make the skies clear the moment he gives the word, so that the sun shines bright on the instant and there isn't a cloud to be seen for miles around?&#8221;</P>
<P>The king ordered that his carriage be taken back to the court, where he would return the Tang Priest's passport with an exit permit and allow him to go. Just when he was placing the royal seal on the document the three Taoists came in to stop him, saying, &#8220;Your Majesty, that rain was caused not by the monk but by our efforts.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But you told me earlier that it did not rain because the dragon kings were not at home,&#8221; said the king. &#8220;When the Buddhist monk went up to the altar and prayed in stillness and silence the rain came. How can you possibly try to take the credit from him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When I went to the altar, burnt the charms and summonses and sounded my magic wand,&#8221; the Great Immortal Tiger Power said, &#8220;the dragon kings would not have dared stay away. No doubt they had been called elsewhere, which was why the authorities in charge of wind, cloud, thunder and rain were all out. When they heard my order they hurried here, which happened to be just when I was coming down from the altar and he was going up to it. It was a coincidence that it rained then. Essentially it was I who summoned the dragons and made it rain. The credit can't possibly go to him.&#8221; In his confusion the king took this suggestion seriously and was once again unable to make up his mind.</P>
<P>Monkey took a step forward, put his hands together in front of his chest, and said, &#8220;Your Majesty, these heterodox magic tricks achieved nothing; the credit is neither his nor mine. But the dragon kings of the four seas are still in the sky here. I haven't sent them away, and they wouldn't dare leave on their own initiative. If the Teacher of the Nation can make the dragon kings appear he can take the credit.&#8221;</P>
<P>This delighted the king, who said, &#8220;In the twenty-three years we have been on the throne we have never seen what a live dragon looks like. You must both display your magic powers. Whoever can make them come, be he Taoist or Buddhist, will have the credit; and whoever fails will be punished.&#8221;</P>
<P>Of course that Taoists did not have the power. In the presence of the Great Sage the dragon kings would not have dared show their faces in response to a call from the Taoists. &#8220;We cannot do it,&#8221; said the Taoists. &#8220;You summon them.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Great Sage looked up to the sky and yelled at the top of his voice, &#8220;Where are you, Ao Guang? You and your brothers must show yourselves to me in your true forms.&#8221; On hearing this summons the dragon kings soon appeared in their true forms; writhing through the mist and clouds in the sky they danced through the air to the throne hall. This was what could be seen:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Flying transformations,</P>
<P>Coiling through the clouds.</P>
<P>Their jade claws hung like white hooks,</P>
<P>Their silver scales danced with the brightness of mirrors.</P>
<P>Vigor was in every strand of their floating white beards;</P>
<P>And their horns rose proud and full of purity.</P>
<P>Lofty were their foreheads,</P>
<P>Bright shone their round, round eyes.</P>
<P>None can predict their appearance;</P>
<P>Their flight is beyond appraisal.</P>
<P>But when the rain was prayed for, it fell,</P>
<P>And the skies cleared as soon as requested.</P>
<P>These were holy and magical dragons,</P>
<P>Surrounding the palace with numinous radiance.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The king burnt incense in his palace hall and the ministers bowed low in worship before the steps. &#8220;Now that your noble selves have granted us your presence we need detain you no longer,&#8221; said the king. &#8220;We shall have a thanksgiving mass said another day.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;All you gods may now go too,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;The king will have a thanksgiving mass said another day.&#8221; The dragon kings went straight back to their oceans, and the gods all returned to Heaven. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Great and boundless is the wonderful Dharma;</P>
<P>False faiths are smashed when its truth is revealed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know how evil was eliminated, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>三清观大圣留名</p>
<p>车迟国猴王显法</p>
</div>
<p>却说孙大圣左手把沙和尚捻一把，右手把猪八戒捻一把，他二人却就省悟，坐在高处，倥着脸，不言不语，凭那些道士点灯着火，前后照看，他三个就如泥塑金装一般模样。虎力大仙道：“没有歹人，如何把供献都吃了？”鹿力大仙道：“却象人吃的勾当，有皮的都剥了皮，有核的都吐出核，却怎么不见人形？”羊力大仙道：“师兄勿疑，想是我们虔心敬意，在此昼夜诵经，前后申文，又是朝廷名号，断然惊动天尊。想是三清爷爷圣驾降临，受用了这些供养。趁今仙从未返，鹤驾在斯，我等可拜告天尊，恳求些圣水金丹，进与陛下，却不是长生永寿，见我们的功果也？”虎力大仙道：“说的是。”教：“徒弟们动乐诵经！一壁厢取法衣来，等我步罡拜祷。”那些小道士俱遵命，两班儿摆列齐整，当的一声磬响，齐念一卷《黄庭道德真经》。虎力大仙披了法衣，擎着玉简，对面前舞蹈扬尘，拜伏于地，朝上启奏道：“诚惶诚恐，稽首归依。臣等兴教，仰望清虚。灭僧鄙俚，敬道光辉。敕修宝殿，御制庭闱。广陈供养，高挂龙旗。通宵秉烛，镇日香菲。一诚达上，寸敬虔归。今蒙降驾，未返仙车。望赐些金丹圣水，进与朝廷，寿比南山。”八戒闻言，心中忐忑，默对行者道：“这是我们的不是。吃了东西，且不走路，只等这般祷祝，却怎么答应？”行者又捻一把，忽地开口叫声：“晚辈小仙，且休拜祝，我等自蟠桃会上来的，不曾带得金丹圣水，待改日再来垂赐。”那些大小道士听见说出话来，一个个抖衣而战道：“爷爷呀！活天尊临凡，是必莫放，好歹求个长生的法儿！”</p>

<p>鹿力大仙上前，又拜云：“扬尘顿首，谨办丹诚。微臣归命，俯仰三清。自来此界，兴道除僧。国王心喜，敬重玄龄。罗天大醮，彻夜看经。幸天尊之不弃，降圣驾而临庭。俯求垂念，仰望恩荣。是必留些圣水，与弟子们延寿长生。”沙僧捻着行者，默默的道：“哥呀，要得紧，又来祷告了。”行者道：“与他些罢。”八戒寂寂道：“那里有得？”行者道：“你只看着我，我有时，你们也都有了。”那道士吹打已毕，行者开言道：“那晚辈小仙，不须拜伏。我欲不留些圣水与你们，恐灭了苗裔；若要与你，又忒容易了。”众道闻言，一齐俯伏叩头道：“万望天尊念弟子恭敬之意，千乞喜赐些须。我弟子广宣道德，奏国王普敬玄门。”行者道：</p>

<p>“既如此，取器皿来。”那道士一齐顿首谢恩。虎力大仙爱强，就抬一口大缸放在殿上；鹿力大仙端一砂盆安在供桌之上；羊力大仙把花瓶摘了花，移在中间。行者道：“你们都出殿前，掩上格子，不可泄了天机，好留与你些圣水。”众道一齐跪伏丹墀之下，掩了殿门。</p>

<p>那行者立将起来，掀着虎皮裙，撒了一花瓶臊溺。猪八戒见了欢喜道：“哥啊，我把你做这几年兄弟，只这些儿不曾弄我。我才吃了些东西，道要干这个事儿哩。”那呆子揭衣服，忽喇喇，就似吕梁洪倒下坂来，沙沙的溺了一砂盆，沙和尚却也撒了半缸，依旧整衣端坐在上道：“小仙领圣水。”那些道士，推开格子，磕头礼拜谢恩，抬出缸去，将那瓶盆总归一处，教：“徒弟，取个锺子来尝尝。”小道士即便拿了一个茶钟，递与老道士。道士舀出一锺来，喝下口去，只情抹唇咂嘴，鹿力大仙道：</p>

<p>“师兄好吃么？”老道士努着嘴道：“不甚好吃，有些酣郸之味。”</p>

<p>羊力大仙道：“等我尝尝。”也喝了一口，道：“有些猪溺臊气。”</p>

<p>行者坐在上面，听见说出这话儿来，已此识破了，道：“我弄个手段，索性留个名罢。”大叫云：“道号道号，你好胡思！那个三清，肯降凡基？吾将真姓，说与你知。大唐僧众，奉旨来西。良宵无事，下降宫闱。吃了供养，闲坐嬉嬉。蒙你叩拜，何以答之？</p>

<p>那里是甚么圣水，你们吃的都是我一溺之尿！”那道士闻得此言，拦住门，一齐动叉钯扫帚瓦块石头，没头没脸往里面乱打。</p>

<p>好行者，左手挟了沙僧，右手挟了八戒，闯出门，驾着祥光，径转智渊寺方丈，不敢惊动师父，三人又复睡下。</p>

<p>早是五鼓三点，那国王设朝，聚集两班文武，四百朝官，但见绛纱灯火光明，宝鼎香云叆叇。此时唐三藏醒来叫：“徒弟徒弟，伏侍我倒换关文去来。”行者与沙僧、八戒急起身，穿了衣服，侍立左右道：“上告师父，这昏君信着那些道士，兴道灭僧，恐言语差错，不肯倒换关文，我等护持师父，都进朝去也。”唐僧大喜，披了锦襕袈裟。行者带了通关文牒，教悟净捧着钵盂，悟能拿了锡杖，将行囊马匹，交与智渊寺僧看守，径到五凤楼前，对黄门官作礼，报了姓名，言是东土大唐取经的和尚来此倒换关文，烦为转奏。那阁门大使，进朝俯伏金阶奏曰：“外面有四个和尚，说是东土大唐取经的，欲来倒换关文，现在五凤楼前候旨。”国王闻奏道：“这和尚没处寻死，却来这里寻死！那巡捕官员，怎么不拿他解来？”旁边闪过当驾的太师，启奏道：</p>

<p>“东土大唐，乃南赡部洲，号曰中华大国，到此有万里之遥，路多妖怪。这和尚一定有些法力，方敢西来。望陛下看中华之远僧，且召来验牒放行，庶不失善缘之意。”国王准奏，把唐僧等宣至金銮殿下。师徒们排列阶前，捧关文递与国王。国王展开方看，又见黄门官来奏：“三位国师来也。”慌得国王收了关文，急下龙座，着近侍的设了绣墩，躬身迎接。三藏等回头观看，见那大仙，摇摇摆摆，后带着一双丫髻蓬头的小童儿，往里直进，两班官控背躬身，不敢仰视。他上了金銮殿，对国王径不行礼。</p>

<p>那国王道：“国师，朕未曾奉请，今日如何肯降？”老道士云：“有一事奉告，故来也。那四个和尚是那国来的？”国王道：“是东土大唐差去西天取经的，来此倒换关文。”那三道士鼓掌大笑道：</p>

<p>“我说他走了，原来还在这里！”国王惊道：“国师有何话说？他才来报了姓名，正欲拿送国师使用，怎奈当驾太师所奏有理，朕因看远来之意，不灭中华善缘，方才召入验牒。不期国师有此问，想是他冒犯尊颜，有得罪处也？”道士笑云：“陛下不知，他昨日来的，在东门外打杀了我两个徒弟，放了五百个囚僧，捽碎车辆，夜间闯进观来，把三清圣象毁坏，偷吃了御赐供养。</p>

<p>我等被他蒙蔽了，只道是天尊下降，求些圣水金丹，进与陛下，指望延寿长生；不期他遗些小便，哄瞒我等。我等各喝了一口，尝出滋味，正欲下手擒拿，他却走了。今日还在此间，正所谓冤家路儿窄也！”那国王闻言发怒，欲诛四众。孙大圣合掌开言，厉声高叫道：“陛下暂息雷霆之怒，容僧等启奏。”国王道：“你冲撞了国师，国师之言，岂有差谬！”行者道：“他说我昨日到城外打杀他两个徒弟，是谁知证？我等且屈认了，着两个和尚偿命，还放两个去取经。他又说我捽碎车辆，放了囚僧，此事亦无见证，料不该死，再着一个和尚领罪罢了。他说我毁了三清，闹了观宇，这又是栽害我也。”国王道：“怎见栽害？”行者道：“我僧乃东土之人，乍来此处，街道尚且不通，如何夜里就知他观中之事？既遗下小便，就该当时捉住，却这早晚坐名害人。天下假名托姓的无限，怎么就说是我？望陛下回嗔详察。”那国王本来昏乱，被行者说了一遍，他就决断不定。</p>

<p>正疑惑之间，又见黄门官来奏：“陛下，门外有许多乡老听宣。”国王道：“有何事干？”即命宣来。宣至殿前，有三四十名乡老朝上磕头道：“万岁，今年一春无雨，但恐夏月干荒，特来启奏，请那位国师爷爷祈一场甘雨，普济黎民。”国王道：“乡老且退，就有雨来也。”乡老谢恩而出。国王道：“唐朝僧众，朕敬道灭僧为何？只为当年求雨，我朝僧人更未尝求得一点；幸天降国师，拯援涂炭。你今远来，冒犯国师，本当即时问罪。姑且恕你，敢与我国师赌胜求雨么？若祈得一场甘雨，济度万民，朕即饶你罪名，倒换关文，放你西去。若赌不过，无雨，就将汝等推赴杀场典刑示众。”行者笑道：“小和尚也晓得些儿求祷。”国王见说，即命打扫坛场，一壁厢教：“摆驾，寡人亲上五凤楼观看。”当时多官摆驾，须臾上楼坐了。唐三藏随着行者、沙僧、八戒，侍立楼下，那三道士陪国王坐在楼上。少时间，一员官飞马来报：“坛场诸色皆备，请国师爷爷登坛。”</p>

<p>那虎力大仙，欠身拱手，辞了国王，径下楼来。行者向前拦住道：“先生那里去？”大仙道：“登坛祈雨。”行者道：“你也忒自重了，更不让我远乡之僧。也罢，这正是强龙不压地头蛇。先生先去，必须对君前讲开。”大仙道：“讲甚么？”行者道：“我与你都上坛祈雨，知雨是你的，是我的？不见是谁的功绩了。”国王在上听见，心中暗喜道：“那小和尚说话倒有些筋节。”沙僧听见，暗笑道：“不知一肚子筋节，还不曾拿出来哩！”大仙道：</p>

<p>“不消讲，陛下自然知之。”行者道：“虽然知之，奈我远来之僧，未曾与你相会。那时彼此混赖，不成勾当，须讲开方好行事。”</p>

<p>大仙道：“这一上坛，只看我的令牌为号：一声令牌响风来，二声响云起，三声响雷闪齐鸣，四声响雨至，五声响云散雨收。”</p>

<p>行者笑道：“妙啊！我僧是不曾见！请了！请了！”</p>

<p>大仙拽开步前进，三藏等随后，径到了坛门外。抬头观看，那里有一座高台，约有三丈多高。台左右插着二十八宿旗号，顶上放一张桌子，桌上有一个香炉，炉中香烟霭霭。两边有两只烛台，台上风烛煌煌。炉边靠着一个金牌，牌上镌的是雷神名号。底下有五个大缸，都注着满缸清水，水上浮着杨柳枝。杨柳枝上，托着一面铁牌，牌上书的是雷霆都司的符字。左右有五个大桩，桩上写着五方蛮雷使者的名录。每一桩边，立两个道士，各执铁锤，伺候着打桩。台后面有许多道士，在那里写作文书。正中间设一架纸炉，又有几个象生的人物，都是那执符使者、土地赞教之神。</p>

<p>那大仙走进去，更不谦逊，直上高台立定。旁边有个小道士，捧了几张黄纸书就的符字，一口宝剑，递与大仙。大仙执着宝剑，念声咒语，将一道符在烛上烧了。那底下两三个道士，拿过一个执符的象生，一道文书，亦点火焚之。那上面乒的一声令牌响，只见那半空里，悠悠的风色飘来，猪八戒口里作念道：</p>

<p>“不好了！不好了！这道士果然有本事！令牌响了一下，果然就刮风！”行者道：“兄弟悄悄的，你们再莫与我说话，只管护持师父，等我干事去来。”好大圣，拔下一根毫毛，吹口仙气，叫“变！”就变作一个“假行者”，立在唐僧手下。他的真身出了元神，赶到半空中，高叫：“那司风的是那个？”慌得那风婆婆捻住布袋，巽二郎札住口绳，上前施礼。行者道：“我保护唐朝圣僧西天取经，路过车迟国，与那妖道赌胜祈雨，你怎么不助老孙，反助那道士？我且饶你，把风收了。若有一些风儿，把那道士的胡子吹得动动，各打二十铁棒！”风婆婆道：“不敢不敢！”遂而没些风气。八戒忍不住乱嚷道：“那先儿请退！令牌已响，怎么不见一些风儿？你下来，让我们上去！”</p>

<p>那道士又执令牌，烧了符檄，扑的又打了一下，只见那空中云雾遮满。孙大圣又当头叫道：“布云的是那个？”慌得那推云童子、布雾郎君当面施礼。行者又将前事说了一遍，那云童、雾子也收了云雾，放出太阳星耀耀，一天万里更无云。八戒笑道：“这先儿只好哄这皇帝，搪塞黎民，全没些真实本事！令牌响了两下，如何又不见云生？”</p>

<p>那道士心中焦躁，仗宝剑，解散了头发，念着咒，烧了符，再一令牌打将下去，只见那南天门里，邓天君领着雷公电母到当空，迎着行者施礼。行者又将前项事说了一遍，道：“你们怎么来的志诚！是何法旨？”天君道：“那道士五雷法是个真的。他发了文书，烧了文檄，惊动玉帝，玉帝掷下旨意，径至九天应元雷声普化天尊府下。我等奉旨前来，助雷电下雨。”行者道：“既如此，且都住了，同候老孙行事。”果然雷也不鸣，电也不灼。</p>

<p>那道士愈加着忙，又添香、烧符、念咒、打下令牌。半空中，又有四海龙王，一齐拥至。行者当头喝道：“敖广！那里去？”那敖广、敖顺、敖钦、敖闰上前施礼。行者又将前项事说了一遍，道：“向日有劳，未曾成功；今日之事，望为助力。”龙王道：“遵命！遵命！”行者又谢了敖顺道：“前日亏令郎缚怪，搭救师父。”</p>

<p>龙王道：“那厮还锁在海中，未敢擅便，正欲请大圣发落。”行者道：“凭你怎么处治了罢，如今且助我一功。那道士四声令牌已毕，却轮到老孙下去干事了。但我不会发符烧檄，打甚令牌，你列位却要助我行行。”邓天君道：“大圣吩咐，谁敢不从！但只是得一个号令，方敢依令而行；不然，雷雨乱了，显得大圣无款也。”行者道：“我将棍子为号罢。”那雷公大惊道：“爷爷呀！我们怎吃得这棍子？”行者道：“不是打你们，但看我这棍子往上一指，就要刮风。”那风婆婆、巽二郎没口的答应道：“就放风！”</p>

<p>“棍子第二指，就要布云。”那推云童子、布雾郎君道：“就布云！</p>

<p>就布云！”“棍子第三指，就要雷鸣电灼。”那雷公、电母道：“奉承！奉承！”“棍子第四指，就要下雨。”那龙王道：“遵命！遵命！”</p>

<p>“棍子第五指，就要大日晴天，却莫违误。”吩咐已毕，遂按下云头，把毫毛一抖，收上身来。那些人肉眼凡胎，那里晓得？行者遂在旁边高叫道：“先生请了，四声令牌俱已响毕，更没有风云雷雨，该让我了。”那道士无奈，不敢久占，只得下了台让他，努着嘴，径往楼上见驾。行者道：“等我跟他去，看他说些甚的。”</p>

<p>只听得那国王问道：“寡人这里洗耳诚听，你那里四声令响，不见风雨，何也？”道士云：“今日龙神都不在家。”行者厉声道：</p>

<p>“陛下，龙神俱在家，只是这国师法不灵，请他不来。等和尚请来你看。”国王道：“即去登坛，寡人还在此候雨。”行者得旨，急抽身到坛所，扯着唐僧道：“师父请上台。”唐僧道：“徒弟，我却不会祈雨。”八戒笑道：“他害你了，若还没雨，拿上柴蓬，一把火了帐！”行者道：“你不会求雨，好的会念经，等我助你。”那长老才举步登坛，到上面端然坐下，定性归神，默念那《密多心经》。正坐处，忽见一员官，飞马来问：“那和尚，怎么不打令牌，不烧符檄？”行者高声答道：“不用！不用！我们是静功祈祷。”</p>

<p>那官去回奏不题。</p>

<p>行者听得老师父经文念尽，却去耳朵内取出铁棒，迎风幌了一幌，就有丈二长短，碗来粗细，将棍望空一指，那风婆婆见了，急忙扯开皮袋，巽二郎解放口绳：只听得呼呼风响，满城中揭瓦翻砖，扬砂走石。看起来，真个好风，却比那寻常之风不同也，但见：折柳伤花，摧林倒树。九重殿损壁崩墙，五凤楼摇梁撼柱。天边红日无光，地下黄砂有翅。演武厅前武将惊，会文阁内文官惧。三宫粉黛乱青丝，六院嫔妃蓬宝髻。侯伯金冠落绣缨，宰相乌纱飘展翅。当驾有言不敢谈，黄门执本无由递。金鱼玉带不依班，象简罗衫无品叙。彩阁翠屏尽损伤，绿窗朱户皆狼狈。金銮殿瓦走砖飞，锦云堂门歪槅碎。这阵狂风果是凶，刮得那君王父子难相会；六街三市没人踪，万户千门皆紧闭！</p>

<p>正是那狂风大作，孙行者又显神通，把金箍棒钻一钻，望空又一指，只见那：推云童子，布雾郎君。推云童子显神威，骨都都触石遮天；布雾郎君施法力，浓漠漠飞烟盖地。茫茫三市暗，冉冉六街昏。因风离海上，随雨出昆仑。顷刻漫天地，须臾蔽世尘。宛然如混沌，不见凤楼门。此时昏雾朦胧，浓云叆叇。孙行者又把金箍棒钻一钻，望空又一指，慌得那：雷公奋怒，电母生嗔。雷公奋怒，倒骑火兽下天关，电母生嗔，乱掣金蛇离斗府。唿喇喇施霹雳，振碎了铁叉山；淅沥沥闪红绡，飞出了东洋海。呼呼隐隐滚车声，烨烨煌煌飘稻米。万萌万物精神改，多少昆虫蛰已开。君臣楼上心惊骇，商贾闻声胆怯忙。那沉雷护闪，乒乒乓乓，一似那地裂山崩之势，唬得那满城人，户户焚香，家家化纸。孙行者高呼：“老邓！仔细替我看那贪赃坏法之官，忤逆不孝之子，多打死几个示众！”那雷越发振响起来。行者却又把铁棒望上一指，只见那：龙施号令，雨漫乾坤。势如银汉倾天堑，疾似云流过海门。楼头声滴滴，窗外响潇潇。天上银河泻，街前白浪滔。淙淙如瓮捡，滚滚似盆浇。孤庄将漫屋，野岸欲平桥。真个桑田变沧海，霎时陆岸滚波涛。神龙借此来相助，抬起长江望下浇。这场雨，自辰时下起，只下到午时前后，下得那车迟城，里里外外，水漫了街衢。那国王传旨道：“雨彀了！雨彀了！十分再多，又渰坏了禾苗，反为不美。”五凤楼下听事官策马冒雨来报：“圣僧，雨彀了。”行者闻言，将金箍棒往上又一指，只见霎时间，雷收风息，雨散云收。国王满心欢喜，文武尽皆称赞道：“好和尚！这正是强中更有强中手！就是我国师求雨虽灵，若要晴，细雨儿还下半日，便不清爽。怎么这和尚要晴就晴，顷刻间杲杲日出，万里就无云也？”</p>

<p>国王教回銮，倒换关文，打发唐僧过去。正用御宝时，又被那三个道士上前阻住道：“陛下，这场雨全非和尚之功，还是我道门之力。”国王道：“你才说龙王不在家，不曾有雨，他走上去，以静功祈祷，就雨下来，怎么又与他争功，何也？”虎力大仙道：“我上坛发了文书，烧了符檄，击了令牌，那龙王谁敢不来？</p>

<p>想是别方召请，风云雷雨五司俱不在，一闻我令，随赶而来，适遇着我下他上，一时撞着这个机会，所以就雨。从根算来，还是我请的龙下的雨，怎么算作他的功果？”那国王昏乱，听此言，却又疑惑未定。行者近前一步，合掌奏道：“陛下，这些旁门法术，也不成个功果，算不得我的他的。如今有四海龙王，现在空中，我僧未曾发放，他还不敢遽退。那国师若能叫得龙王现身，就算他的功劳。”国王大喜道：“寡人做了二十三年皇帝，更不曾看见活龙是怎么模样。你两家各显法力，不论僧道，但叫得来的，就是有功；叫不出的，有罪。”那道士怎么有那样本事？就叫，那龙王见大圣在此，也不敢出头。道士云：“我辈不能，你是叫来。”那大圣仰面朝空，厉声高叫：“敖广何在？弟兄们都现原身来看！”那龙王听唤，即忙现了本身。四条龙，在半空中度雾穿云，飞舞向金銮殿上，但见：飞腾变化，绕雾盘云。玉爪垂钩白，银鳞舞镜明。髯飘素练根根爽，角耸轩昂挺挺清。磕额崔巍，圆睛幌亮。隐显莫能测，飞扬不可评。祷雨随时布雨，求晴即便天晴。这才是有灵有圣真龙象，祥瑞缤纷绕殿庭。那国王在殿上焚香。众公卿在阶前礼拜。国王道：“有劳贵体降临，请回，寡人改日醮谢。”行者道：“列位众神各自归去，这国王改日醮谢哩。”那龙王径自归海，众神各各回天。这正是：广大无边真妙法，至真了性劈旁门。毕竟不知怎么除邪，且听下回分解。</p>
