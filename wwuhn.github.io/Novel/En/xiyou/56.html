<P>The Tang Priest Is Tempted with Sex<SUP></SUP> and Debauchery</P>
<P>Because His Nature Is Upright He Resists Unharmed</P>
</div>
<P>The story tells how the Great Sage and Pig were just about to use their magic to immobilize all the women when they suddenly heard the noise of a wind. Friar Sand, who was shouting, looked round at once to find the Tang Priest gone.</P>
<P>&#8220;Who's taken the master?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;A woman made a whirlwind and carried him off in it,&#8221; Friar Sand reported. At this news Monkey jumped up with a whoosh to stand on his cloud and shade his eyes as he looked all around. He saw the gray dust cloud of a whirlwind that was heading Northwest.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brothers,&#8221; he turned back to shout, &#8220;come straight up on your clouds. We're going after the master.&#8221; Pig and Friar Sand tied the luggage on the horse and both sprang noisily into the air.</P>
<P>All this gave such a fright to the queen of Western Liang and her subjects that they fell to their knees in the dust and said, &#8220;He is an arhat who has flown away in broad daylight. Do not be alarmed, Your Majesty. The Tang emperor's brother is a dhyana monk who has mastered the Way. We were too blind to see who this man of China really was, and we allowed ourselves all that longing for nothing. Please ride back to the palace in your carriage, Your Majesty.&#8221; The queen felt ashamed as she went back into her capital with her officials, and we shall say no more of them.</P>
<P>Monkey and the other two disciples meanwhile were riding their clouds through the air after the whirlwind. They chased it to a high mountain, where the gray dust settled and the wind fell, so that they did not know which way the demon had gone. The brothers brought their clouds down to land to search for the way. Suddenly they noticed a gleaming rock shaped like a screen. Leading the horse round behind it they found a pair of stone doors above which was written:</P>
<P>DEADLY FOE MOUNTAIN PIPA CAVE</P>
<P>In his ignorance Pig went up to the doors and was about to beat on them with his rake when Monkey rushed forward to stop him. &#8220;Don't be in such a hurry, brother,&#8221; he said. &#8220;After following the whirlwind we had to look around for a while before we found these doors. We don't know what's behind them. If they're the wrong doors we'd stir up trouble offending the wrong people, and we don't want to do that. You two take the horse round to the front of the rock screen and wait a moment. I'm going to take a look around and find out what's happening here. Then it'll be much easier to know what to do.&#8221;</P>
<P>Friar Sand liked this idea. &#8220;Splendid, splendid,&#8221; he said, &#8220;You've found the subtle solution when things were looking rough, the calm way out of the crisis.&#8221; The two of them then led the horse to the other side of the rock screen.</P>
<P>Monkey then showed his magic powers. Making a spell with his hands and saying the words he shook himself and turned into an exquisite bee. Just look at him:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Fine wings bending in the wind,</P>
<P>A narrow waist gleaming with the sun.</P>
<P>With his sweet mouth he searched for stamens,</P>
<P>While the sting in his tail killed toads.</P>
<P>Great was his achievement in making honey,</P>
<P>And he always entered the hive with courtesy.</P>
<P>Now be would use a brilliant plan</P>
<P>As he flew in under the eaves of the doorway.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey squeezed in through the crack between the outer doors then past the inner doors to see a female monster sitting in a flower pavilion with serving girls in brightly-coloured embroidered clothes and their hair sticking upwards in two bunches. They were all very pleased, but he could not hear what they were talking about. Monkey flew up to them very quietly, perched on the lattice of the pavilion, and cocked his ear to listen. He saw two women with their tangled hair tied in a bun carrying two piping hot dishes of food to the pavilion and saying, &#8220;Madam, this dish has steamed rolls with human flesh in them, and that one has vegetarian ones with sweet beanpaste fillings.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Little ones,&#8221; said the she-devil with a smile, &#8220;Bring the Tang emperor's brother out.&#8221; Some of the serving girls in embroidered clothes went to the room at the back to help the Tang Priest out. His face was sallow, his lips white, and his eyes red as the tears streamed down his face, &#8220;The master's been drugged,&#8221; thought Monkey with a silent sigh.</P>
<P>The she-devil went down from the pavilion and showed her ten fingers that were as delicate as spring onions as she grabbed hold of Sanzang and said, &#8220;Don't worry, emperor's brother. This may not be as rich and splendid as the palace in the Womanland of Western Liang, but it's peaceful and comfortable, and an ideal place for reciting the Buddha's name and reading the scriptures. With me as your companion we'll be able to live in harmony till we're a hundred.&#8221; Sanzang said nothing.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be upset,&#8221; the she-devil said. &#8220;I know that you had nothing to eat or to drink at your banquet in Womanland. Here are two dishes, one of meat and one of vegetarian food. Won't you take some to calm your nerves?&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang thought deeply: &#8220;If I say nothing and eat nothing, this she-devil may murder me. She is worse than the queen, who was at least human and knew how to behave. What am I to do? My disciples don't know that I'm a prisoner here. If I let her murder me I'll be throwing my life away for nothing.&#8221; Though he racked his brains he could find no other plan, so he pulled himself together and asked, &#8220;What is the meat dish and what is the vegetarian one?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The meat one is steamed rolls stuffed with human flesh, and the vegetarian one steamed rolls with sweet fillings,&#8221; the she-devil replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;I would like some of the vegetarian ones,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;Servant girls,&#8221; said the she-devil, &#8220;bring hot tea and give your master some vegetarian steamed rolls.&#8221; A servant girl then brought in a tray of tea that she set before the Tang Priest. The she-devil broke a vegetarian roll open and handed it to Sanzang, who offered a whole meat one to her. &#8220;Why won't you open it for me, emperor's brother?&#8221; the she-devil asked with a smile.</P>
<P>&#8220;I am a man of religion, so I would not dare to break meat food,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said the she-devil, &#8220;Why did you eat wedding cake at the Motherhood River, and why are you insisting on eating beanpaste now?&#8221;</P>
<P>To this Sanzang replied,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;When the river is high I'm carried away.</P>
<P>When bogged down I have to slow down.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey, who could hear from his perch in the lattice just how friendly their conversation was getting, started worrying that the master's true nature might become disturbed. It was more than he could bear, so he resumed his own appearance and brandished his cudgel with a shout of &#8220;Behave yourself, you evil beast.&#8221; When the she-devil saw him she spat out smoke and light that covered the pavilion and told her underlings to shut the Tang Priest away.</P>
<P>Then she seized her steel trident and leapt out through the door of the pavilion, shouting abusively, &#8220;Hooligan ape! How dare you sneak into my house to set your dirty eyes on me! Stay where you are and take this!&#8221; The Great Sage parried the lunge from her trident and fell back, fighting all the way.</P>
<P>When they came to the outside of the cave where Pig and Friar Sand were waiting, the sight of the hard-fought battle so alarmed Pig that he led the white horse over to Friar Sand and said, &#8220;Look after the horse and the luggage. I'm joining in.&#8221; The splendid idiot then raised his rake with both hands and rushed forward with a shout, &#8220;Stand back, brother, while I kill this vicious beast.&#8221; Seeing Pig coming the she-devil used another kind of magic to breathe fire out of her nose and smoke from her mouth as she shook herself and charged him with her trident flying and dancing. Goodness only knows how many hands she had as she somersaulted towards them, lashing out furiously. Monkey and Pig were both fought to a standstill.</P>
<P>&#8220;Sun Wukong,&#8221; said the she-devil, &#8220;you don't know when to keep your head down. I know who you are, but you don't recognize me. Even your Tathagata Buddha from the Thunder Monastery is afraid of me. Where do you think you two little wretches are going to get? Come here, all of you, and watch me beat every one of you.&#8221; It was a fine battle:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Great was the she-devil's prowess</P>
<P>As the Monkey King's anger rose.</P>
<P>Then Marshal Tian Peng joined in the fight,</P>
<P>Showing off wildly wielding his rake.</P>
<P>One was a many-handed mistress of the trident,</P>
<P>Surrounding herself with smoke and with light;</P>
<P>The other two were impatient and their weapons powerful,</P>
<P>As they stirred up many a cloud of mist.</P>
<P>The she-devil was fighting to win a mate,</P>
<P>But the monk would never lose his vital seed.</P>
<P>Ill-matched male and female fought it out,</P>
<P>Each showing heroism in the bitter struggle.</P>
<P>Calmly the female had built up her strength, longing for action;</P>
<P>The male was on guard in his love of pure stillness.</P>
<P>This made peace between them impossible</P>
<P>As trident fought for mastery with cudgel and rake.</P>
<P>Powerful was the cudgel,</P>
<P>Even stronger the rake,</P>
<P>But the she-devil's trident was a match for them both.</P>
<P>Nobody would yield on Deadly Foe Mountain;</P>
<P>No mercy was given outside Pipa Cave.</P>
<P>One was happy at the thought of the Tang Priest as a husband;</P>
<P>The other two were going with him to collect the scriptures.</P>
<P>Heaven and earth were alarmed by the battle,</P>
<P>Which darkened sun and moon and displaced all the stars.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the three of them had been fighting for a long time without anyone emerging as victor, the she-devil shook herself and used the sting in her tail to jab the Great Sage in the head. Monkey yelled in agony at the unbearable pain and fled, defeated. Seeing that things were going badly Pig withdrew too, dragging his rake behind him. The victorious she-devil put her steel trident away.</P>
<P>Monkey had his hands round his head and his face screwed up in agony as he shouted, &#8220;It's terrible, it's terrible.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, going up to him, &#8220;why did you run away howling in pain just when you were fighting so well?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's agony, agony,&#8221; groaned Brother Monkey, still holding his head.</P>
<P>&#8220;Is it an attack of your migraine?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; said Monkey, hopping around in pain.</P>
<P>&#8220;But I didn't see you get wounded,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;so how can your head be hurting?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's unbearable,&#8221; groaned Monkey. &#8220;Just when she saw that I was beginning to beat her trident she braced herself and jabbed me in the head. I don't know what weapon she used, but it's made my head ache so unbearably that I had to run away, beaten.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In quiet places you're always boasting that your head was tempered in the furnace,&#8221; said Pig with a laugh, &#8220;so why was that too much for you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Monkey, &#8220;after my head was refined I stole the magic peaches and immortal wine and Lord Lao Zi's golden elixir tablets. When I made havoc in Heaven the Jade Emperor ordered the Strongarm Demon King and the Twenty eight Constellations to take me to be beheaded at the Dipper and Bull Palace. The gods used their cutlasses, axes, hammers and swords on me, struck me with thunderbolts and burned me with fire. Then Lao Zi put me in his Eight Trigrams Furnace and refined me for forty-nine days. None of that harmed me at all. Goodness only knows what weapon that woman used to make my head hurt like this.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Put your hands down and let me have a look,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;Has it been cut open?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'd better go back to Western Liang to get you some ointment to put on it,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's not cut open or swollen; I don't need ointment,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; laughed Pig, &#8220;I wasn't at all ill when I was pregnant or after I lost the baby, but you've got a carbuncle on your forehead.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop teasing him, brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;It's getting late, our eldest brother's been wounded in the head, and we don't know whether the master is dead or alive. What on earth are we going to do?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The master's all right,&#8221; groaned Brother Monkey. &#8220;I flew in as a bee and saw the woman sitting in a flower pavilion. Before long two servant girls came in with two dishes of steamed rolls, one with fillings of human flesh and one with sweet fillings of beanpaste. She sent two other serving girls to help the master come out to eat something to soothe his nerves. She was talking about being his companion. At first he wouldn't reply or eat any of the rolls, but she was giving him so much sweet talk that he said he'd have a vegetarian one. Goodness knows why. The woman broke one open and gave it to him, and he passed her an unbroken meat one. 'Why won't you open it for me?' She asked, and he said, 'I am a man of religion, so I would not dare to break meat food.' Then she said, 'In that case, why did you eat wedding cake at the Motherhood River, and why are you eating sweet fillings now?' The master did not catch what she was driving at, and replied, 'When the river is high I'm carried away; when bogged down I have to slow down.' Listening to all this from the lattice I got worried that the master was going to forget himself, so I turned back into myself and hit at her with my cudgel. She used magic too, breathed out clouds, told them to shut the master away, and drove me out of the cave with her trident.&#8221;</P>
<P>Friar Sand bit his finger and said, &#8220;That low bitch must have followed us at some stage, she knows so much.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;From what you say,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;we mustn't rest. From dusk to the middle of the night we've got to keep going back and challenging her to fight. We'll have to yell and make such a din that she can't go to bed or have it off with our master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I can't go back,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;My head's hurting too badly.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We can't challenge her to battle,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;Our eldest brother's head is aching and our master is a true monk. He won't let the illusion of sex disturb his nature. Let's spend the light sitting somewhere under the mountain that's sheltered from the wind. Then we can build up our energy and think of something else in the morning.&#8221; The three brother disciples tethered the white horse and guarded the luggage as they spent the night resting under the slope of the mountain.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The she-devil then put aside thoughts of murder and started to wear a mile again as she said, &#8220;Little ones, shut the front and back doors tight.&#8221; Then she sent out two scouts to keep an eye on Monkey, and ordered them to report the moment any sound was heard at the door. &#8220;Maids,&#8221; she commanded, &#8220;tidy the bedroom and get it ready. Bring candles, burn incense, and ask the Tang emperor's brother in. I'm going to make love with him.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Tang Priest was then helped out from the back, while the she-devil, looking utterly bewitching, took him by the hand and said, &#8220;As the saying goes, pleasure's worth more than gold. You and I are going to have some fun as man and wife.&#8221;</P>
<P>The venerable elder clenched his teeth and let out not a sound. He would have preferred not to go with her but he was afraid she might kill him, so in fear and trembling he accompanied her into the bridal chamber, he was as if stupefied and dumb. He would not lift his head and look up, let alone catch sight of the bed and the curtains in the room, and even less did he see the intricately carved furniture or her hairstyle and clothing. He was deaf and indifferent when she spoke of her desire. He was indeed a fine monk:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>His eyes saw no evil beauty,</P>
<P>His ears heard no voluptuous words.</P>
<P>To him the brocade and the lovely face was dung,</P>
<P>The gold, the jewels and the beauty so much dirt.</P>
<P>The love of his life was contemplation;</P>
<P>He never took a step from Buddha land.</P>
<P>He did not care for female charms,</P>
<P>Knowing only how to nourish his true nature.</P>
<P>The she-devil</P>
<P>Was full of life</P>
<P>And unbounded desire.</P>
<P>The venerable monk</P>
<P>Seemed almost dead,</P>
<P>His mind fixed on meditation.</P>
<P>One was soft jade and warm fragrance;</P>
<P>The other was dead ash and withered wood.</P>
<P>One spread open the bridal sheets,</P>
<P>Full of voluptuousness;</P>
<P>The other fastened his tunic more tightly,</P>
<P>His heart ever true.</P>
<P>One longed to press her breasts against him and entwine their limbs</P>
<P>In rapturous union;</P>
<P>The other wanted only to sit facing the wall</P>
<P>Like the monk Bodhidharma.</P>
<P>The she-devil took off her clothes,</P>
<P>Displaying her smooth skin and fragrant body;</P>
<P>The Tang Priest pulled his robes together,</P>
<P>Covering the roughness of his hide and flesh.</P>
<P>The she-devil said,</P>
<P>&#8220;There is room on my pillow and under my sheet:</P>
<P>Why not come to bed?&#8221;</P>
<P>The Tang Priest replied,</P>
<P>&#8220;My head is shaven and I wear monk's robes:</P>
<P>I may not join you.&#8221;</P>
<P>She said, &#8220;I would like to be Liu Cuicui in the story.&#8221;</P>
<P>He replied, &#8220;But I am not like the Monk of the Moonlight.&#8221;</P>
<P>The she-devil said, &#8220;I am more lovely than Xi Shi herself.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Long was the king of Yue buried on her account,&#8221; the monk replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Do you remember the lines,&#8221; the she-devil asked,</P>
<P>&#8220;'I'm willing to die and be buried under flowers;</P>
<P>Even as a ghost shall I live and love?'&#8221;</P>
<P>To this the Tang Priest replied,</P>
<P>&#8220;My true masculinity is my great treasure;</P>
<P>I could not lightly give it to a bag of bones like you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The two of them kept up their battle of words till it was late in the night, and the Tang Priest's resolution was unmoved. The she-devil kept tugging at his clothes, refusing to let go of him, while the master kept up his resistance. The struggle went on till the middle of the night, when the she-devil finally lost her temper and called, &#8220;Bring rope, little ones.&#8221; Sadly she had her beloved man tied up like a dog and dragged outside to the portico. Then the silver lamps were blown out and everyone went to bed for the night.</P>
<P>Before they knew it the cocks had crowed three times. On the mountainside the Great Sage Monkey leaned forward and said, &#8220;This head of mine ached for a while, but now it doesn't hurt or feel numb. It's just a bit itchy.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If it's itchy then what about letting her jab it again for you?&#8221; said Pig with a grin.</P>
<P>&#8220;We've got to make her let him go,&#8221; said Monkey, spitting.</P>
<P>&#8220;'Let him go, let him go,'&#8220; mocked Pig. &#8220;I bet our master spent last night having a go.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop arguing, you two,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;It's light now. We've got to capture that demon as quickly as we can.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you stay here and look after the horse. Don't move. Pig, come with me.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot braced himself, tightened the belt round his black cotton tunic and went with Monkey as each of them leapt up to the top of the car and arrived beneath the stone screen, weapon in hand. &#8220;You stand here,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'm afraid that the she-devil may have harmed the master during the night, so wait while I go in and find out. If he was seduced by her into losing his primal masculinity and ruining his virtue then we'll all split up. But if he kept his spirit firm and his dhyana heart was unmoved we'll have to hold out till we've killed the she-devil and rescued the master. Then we can head West.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Idiot!&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;As the saying goes, can a dried fish be a cat's pillow? Even if she didn't succeed she'll have had a good grab at him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop talking such nonsense,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'm going to have a look.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage took his leave of Pig and went round the rock screen. Then he shook himself, turned back into a bee, and flew inside, where he saw two serving girls sound asleep with their heads pillowed on their watch-keepers' clappers and gongs. When he reached the flower pavilion he found that the devils were still asleep, exhausted after being up half the night, and not aware that it was dawn. Monkey then flew on to the back of the cave, where he could half hear Sanzang's voice. He looked up to see the master with his hands and feet all roped together under the portico. Landing lightly on Sanzang's head he said, &#8220;Master.&#8221;</P>
<P>Recognizing his voice, Sanzang said, &#8220;Is that you, Wukong. Rescue me!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Did you have a good time last night?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I would have died first,&#8221; Sanzang replied through clenched teeth.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yesterday it looked to me that she was in love with you,&#8221; Monkey continued, &#8220;so why has she been torturing you like this?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;She pestered me for half the night,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;but I never undid my clothes or even touched the bed. She only tied me up and left me here when she saw that I was not going to give in to her. Whatever happens you must rescue me so that I can go and fetch the scriptures.&#8221; By now their conversation had woken the she-devil up. Ferocious though she was she still could not bear to lose Sanzang.</P>
<P>As she woke up and sat up she heard him saying &#8220;fetch the scriptures,&#8221; rolled straight out of bed, and shrieked, &#8220;What do you want to<I></I> go and fetch scriptures for instead of being my husband?&#8221;</P>
<P>This alarmed Monkey, who left the master, spread his wings, flew out, turned back into himself, and shouted for Pig. The idiot came round the stone screen and asked, &#8220;Well? Did it happen?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; laughed Monkey, &#8220;it didn't. She kept pawing him but he wouldn't go along with her, so she lost her temper and tied him up. Just when he was telling me what had happened the fiend woke up and I had to rush out in a panic.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What did the master say?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;He told me that he never undid his clothes,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and never even touched the bed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's wonderful,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;He's a true monk. Let's go and save him.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot was too crude to bother with arguing: he lifted his rake and brought it down with all his might against the doors, smashing them to pieces. This gave the serving girls who were asleep with their heads pillowed on their watch-keepers' clappers and gongs such a fright that they ran to the inner doors shouting, &#8220;Open up! The two ugly men who came here last night have smashed the front doors down.&#8221;</P>
<P>The she-devil was just coming out of her bedroom when four or five serving girls came rushing in to report, &#8220;Madam, the two ugly men who were here yesterday have come back and smashed the front doors down.&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing this the she-devil ordered, &#8220;Little ones, boil water at once for me to wash and comb my hair.&#8221; Then she told them, &#8220;Carry the emperor's brother roped up as he is and lock him up in the back room. I'm going out to fight them.&#8221;</P>
<P>Out went the splendid monster, brandishing her<I></I> trident and shouting abusively, &#8220;Vicious ape! Dirty hog! Ignorant beast! How dare you come knocking down my doors!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Filthy whore,&#8221; Pig retaliated, &#8220;you tie our master up and then you have the nerve to talk tough like that. You tried to seduce our master into being your husband. Give him back now and we'll spare your life. If there's so much as a hint of a 'no' from you this rake of mine will smash your whole mountain down.&#8221;</P>
<P>The demon did not allow any more argument but summoned up her spirits and used the same magic as before to breathe out smoke and fire as she thrust at Pig with her steel trident. Swerving aside to avoid the blow, Pig struck back with his rake. When Monkey joined in to help him with his cudgel the she-devil used more magic to give herself endless pairs of hands with which to parry their weapons to left and to right. When they had fought four or five rounds the mystery weapon jabbed Pig in the lip, making him flee for his life, dragging his rake behind him and pressing a hand to his mouth. Monkey, who was also rather scared of her, feinted with his cudgel and fled in defeat too. The she-devil went back into her cave in victory, telling her underlings to build up a temporary outer barrier with rocks.</P>
<P>Friar Sand heard piggish groans as he was pasturing the horse and looked up to see Pig coming towards him with his hand on his face and moaning. &#8220;What's up?&#8221; Friar Sand asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's terrible, terrible,&#8221; the idiot groaned, &#8220;the pain, the pain.&#8221;</P>
<P>He was still complaining when Monkey turned up too, saying with a grin, &#8220;Idiot! Yesterday you wished me a carbuncle on my forehead, and today you've got one on your lip.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I can't bear it,&#8221; groaned Pig, &#8220;it's agony, it's excruciating.&#8221;</P>
<P>Just as the three of them were at a loss as to what to do an old woman came by with a green bamboo basket carrying wild vegetables from the hills to the South. &#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand to Monkey, &#8220;that woman's coming this way. I'll ask her who this evil spirit is and what weapon she has that causes such terrible wounds.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You stay here while I go and ask her,&#8221; Monkey said, and taking a quick look he saw that there was a halo of auspicious cloud directly above the old woman's head, and that fragrant mists were all around her.</P>
<P>Recognizing who it was, Monkey called out, &#8220;Come and kowtow, brothers. This lady is the Bodhisattva.&#8221; This so surprised them that Pig kowtowed despite his pain, Friar Sand bowed low as he held the horse, and Monkey fell to his knees and called, &#8220;I submit to The Merciful and Compassionate Deliverer from Suffering, the Miraculously Responding Bodhisattva Guanyin.&#8221;</P>
<P>Seeing that they had recognized her, the Bodhisattva rose up into midair on her auspicious cloud and appeared in her true form as the carrier of the fish basket. Going up into the sky with her, Monkey kowtowed and reported, &#8220;Bodhisattva, please forgive your disciple for failing to come to meet you. Because we were so busy trying to save the master we did not realize that you had come to see us. We are now up against a monster we can't beat, and we beseech you, Bodhisattva, to help us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;She is indeed a very terrible monster,&#8221; the Bodhisattva replied. &#8220;Her trident is really the two claws she was born with, and what causes such agonizing wounds is a sting in her tail called 'horse-killer poison'. She was originally a scorpion spirit who used to listen to the Buddha preaching the scriptures on the Thunder Monastery. When the Tathagata Buddha saw her and mistakenly tried to push her away with his hand she used her tail to sting him on his left thumb. The Buddha in his pain told one of the vajrapanis to arrest her and she is now here. You will have to ask someone else for help as I too have to keep my distance from her.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey then bowed again and said, &#8220;I beg the Bodhisattva for further instructions. Please tell your disciple whom I should go to see to ask for help.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Go to the Palace of Light inside the Eastern Gate of Heaven and look for the Star Officer of the Pleiades. He will be able to subdue her.&#8221; Having spoken she turned into a beam of golden light and went straight back to the Southern Ocean.</P>
<P>The Great Sage Monkey then brought down his cloud and said to Pig and Friar Sand, &#8220;Don't worry, brothers. Our master has a star to save him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where?&#8221; Friar Sand asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The Bodhisattva has just told me to ask the help of the Star Officer of the Pleiades,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;I'm off.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; groaned Pig, his hand still on his mouth, &#8220;please ask the star lord for some ointment to stop this pain.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't need any ointment,&#8221; laughed Monkey. &#8220;After a night's pain it'll get better, just as mine did last night.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop all that talk,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;and get there as fast as you can.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Monkey set off at once on his somersault cloud and was outside the Eastern Gate of Heaven in an instant. The Heavenly King Virudhaka suddenly appeared to greet him courteously and ask, &#8220;Where are you going, Great Sage?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I want to go to the Palace of Light to see the Star Lord of the Pleiades because the Tang Priest I'm escorting to the West to fetch the scriptures is being pestered by a devil,&#8221; Monkey said. Then the four marshals Tao, Zhang, Xin and Deng appeared to ask Monkey where he was going.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm looking for the Star Officer of the Pleiades to subdue a demon and rescue my master,&#8221; he said.</P>
<P>To this they answered, &#8220;The star officer has gone on an inspection to the Star-viewing Tower today at the Jade Emperor's command.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Is that true?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;We left the Dipper and Bull Palace with him,&#8221; Heavenly Lord Xin said, &#8220;and we would not dare lie about it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He has been gone for a long time,&#8221; Heavenly Lord Tao said, &#8220;so he may be back by now. Great Sage, you would do best to go to the Palace of Light first, and if he is not back, go on to the Star-viewing Tower.&#8221;</P>
<P>This delighted the Great Sage, who took his leave of them and went to the gate of the Palace of Light. Finding that the star officer was indeed not there he was just about to leave when he noticed a column of soldiers outside. Behind them was the star lord returning in his court dress sewn with golden thread. This is how he looked:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Five Peak pins in his hat gleamed gold;</P>
<P>The mountain and river tablet he held was of the finest jade.</P>
<P>The Seven Stars hung from his waist amid clouds and mist;</P>
<P>Bright were the rings of jade on his Eight-pole sash.</P>
<P>His pendants chimed with a rhythmical sound;</P>
<P>The wind rushing past made a noise like bells.</P>
<P>The Star Officer of the Pleiades came holding his kingfisher fan;</P>
<P>While clouds of heavenly incense filled the hall.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the soldiers in the front ranks saw Monkey standing outside the Palace of Light they hurried back to report, &#8220;My lord, the Great Sage Sun is here.&#8221; The star officer put away his clouds and tidied his court dress, then when the attendants carrying his insignia of office stood aside to left and right he stepped forward to greet Monkey courteously and ask, &#8220;Why are you here, Great Sage?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have come especially to pay my respects and beg you to rescue my master from disaster,&#8221; Brother Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;What disaster, and where?&#8221; the star officer asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;He is in the Pipa Cave on Deadly Foe Mountain in Western Liang,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;What evil monster is there in the cave that you should need to send for me?&#8221; asked the star officer.</P>
<P>&#8220;The Bodhisattva Guanyin appeared to us just now,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;and told us that she is a scorpion spirit. She specially mentioned you, sir, as the only person who would be able to control her. That is why I have come here to ask your help.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I would have preferred to submit a memorial to the Jade Emperor,&#8221; the star officer replied, &#8220;but as you have come here, Great Sage, and as I am much obliged to the Bodhisattva for recommending me I would not like to lose any more time. Excuse me if I don't offer you tea: let's go down to subdue the demon. I can report back to His Majesty on my return.&#8221;</P>
<P>At that the Great Sage went out with the star officer through the Eastern Gate of Heaven and straight back to Western Liang. Seeing Deadly Foe Mountain not far off, Monkey Pointed to it and said, &#8220;That's the mountain.&#8221; The star lord brought his cloud down and went with Monkey to the slope in front of the stone screen.</P>
<P>&#8220;Get up, brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand to Pig on seeing them. &#8220;Brother Monkey is back with the star officer.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Forgive me,&#8221; said the idiot, his hand still pressed over his mouth, &#8220;forgive me, but I'm too ill to pay you all the courtesies.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But you are one who cultivates his conduct,&#8221; the star lord said. &#8220;How can you be ill?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The she-devil jabbed me in the lip when I was fighting her,&#8221; Pig replied, and it still hurts.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Come here,&#8221; said the star lord, &#8220;and I'll cure it for you.&#8221;</P>
<P>Only then did the idiot put his hands down as he groaned, &#8220;Please, please cure it for me. I'll pay you well when it's better.&#8221; The star lord then touched his lip and blew on it, at which the pain stopped. A delighted Pig went down on his knees and kowtowed to the star lord. &#8220;Wonderful, wonderful,&#8221; he said.</P>
<P>&#8220;Will you touch my head too?&#8221; asked Monkey with a smile.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why?&#8221; the star lord asked. &#8220;You weren't jabbed with the poison.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I was yesterday,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;and it only stopped hurting after last night. It's still rather numb and itchy and may be bad again when the weather turns overcast, which is why I would like you to cure it.&#8221; The star officer then touched and blew on his head too, thus removing the remaining poison and stopping the numbness and itching.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said a wrathful Pig, &#8220;let's go and fight that vicious creature.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; the star lord said, &#8220;you two call her out so that I can put her in her place.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey and Pig leapt up the slope and went round the stone screen once more. Yelling insults the idiot used his hands like picks and hit with his rake to clear a way through the wall of stones that had been built outside the mouth of the cave. Once through these outer defenses he struck again with his rake to smash the inner doors to sawdust, giving the little devils behind them such a shock that they ran inside to report, &#8220;Madam, those two hideous men have smashed the inner doors now.&#8221; The she-devil had just had the Tang Priest untied and sent for some vegetarian breakfast for him when she heard the inner doors being smashed. Leaping out of her flower pavilion she thrust at Pig with her trident. He parried with his rake while Monkey joined in the fight from the side. The she-devil went right up to them and was just going to use her vicious trick when the two of them, who now knew what she was about, turned and fled.</P>
<P>As soon as the two of them were round the rock Monkey shorted, &#8220;Where are you, star lord?&#8221; The star lord stood up at once on the mountainside in his original form as a giant rooster with twin combs. When he raised his head he was six or seven feet tall, and as soon as he crowed the monster reverted to her true appearance as a scorpion spirit the size of a pipa mandolin. When the star officer crowed again the monster's whole body crumbled in death. There is a poem as evidence that goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>With fancy combs and a tasseled neck,</P>
<P>Hard claws, long spurs and angry eyes,</P>
<P>Nobly he leaps, complete in all his powers,</P>
<P>Towering majestic as three times he cries.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He is no common fowl who by a cottage crows</P>
<P>But a star down from the sky in all his glory.</P>
<P>Vainly the vicious scorpion took a human form:</P>
<P>Revealed now as herself she ends her story.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Pig went forward and said, one foot planted on the monster's back, &#8220;Evil beast, You won't be able to use your horse-killer poison this time.&#8221; The monster did not move, whereupon the idiot pounded her to mincemeat with his rake. The star lord gathered his golden light around him once more and rode away on his cloud. Monkey, Pig and Friar Sand all raised their clasped hands to Heaven in thanks.</P>
<P>&#8220;We have put you to much trouble,&#8221; they said. &#8220;We shall go to your palace to thank you another day.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the three of them had finished expressing their gratitude they bot the luggage and the horse ready and went into the cave, where the young and old serving girls were kneeling on either side saying, &#8220;My lords, we are not evil spirits but women from Western Liang who were carried off by the evil spirit. Your master is sitting in the scented room at the back crying.&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing this Monkey took a very careful look around, and seeing that there were indeed no more devilish vapors he went round to the back and called, &#8220;Master!&#8221; The Tang Priest was very pleased indeed to see them all there.</P>
<P>&#8220;Good disciples,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I have put you to such a lot of trouble. What has happened to that woman?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That damned female was really a scorpion,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;Luckily the Bodhisattva Guanyin told us what to do. Brother Monkey went to the palaces of Heaven to ask the Star Lord of the Pleiades to come down and defeat the demon. I've beaten her to pulp. That's why we dared to come right inside to see you, Master.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Tang Priest thanked them deeply. They then looked for some meat-free rice and noodles and laid on a meal for themselves that they ate. The kidnapped women were all taken down the mountain and shown the way back home. Then they lit a firebrand and burned down all the buildings there before helping the Tang Priest back on his horse and continuing along the main road West. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>They cut themselves off from worldly connections,</P>
<P>Turning away from the lures of desire.</P>
<P>By pushing right back the ocean of gold,</P>
<P>In their minds and their hearts their awareness was higher.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know how many years were to pass before they finally won their true achievement, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>色邪淫戏唐三藏</p>
<p>性正修持不坏身</p>
</div>
<p>却说孙大圣与猪八戒正要使法定那些妇女，忽闻得风响处，沙僧嚷闹，急回头时，不见了唐僧。行者道：“是甚人来抢师父去了？”沙僧道：“是一个女子，弄阵旋风，把师父摄了去也。”</p>

<p>行者闻言，唿哨跳在云端里，用手搭凉篷，四下里观看，只见一阵灰尘，风滚滚，往西北上去了，急回头叫道：“兄弟们，快驾云同我赶师父去来！”八戒与沙僧，即把行囊捎在马上，响一声，都跳在半空里去。慌得那西梁国君臣女辈，跪在尘埃，都道：</p>

<p>“是白日飞升的罗汉，我主不必惊疑。唐御弟也是个有道的禅僧，我们都有眼无珠，错认了中华男子，枉费了这场神思。请主公上辇回朝也。”女王自觉惭愧，多官都一齐回国不题。</p>

<p>却说孙大圣兄弟三人腾空踏雾，望着那阵旋风，一直赶来，前至一座高山，只见灰尘息静，风头散了，更不知怪向何方。兄弟们按落云雾，找路寻访，忽见一壁厢，青石光明，却似个屏风模样。三人牵着马转过石屏，石屏后有两扇石门，门上有六个大字，乃是“毒敌山琵琶洞”。八戒无知，上前就使钉钯筑门，行者急止住道：“兄弟莫忙，我们随旋风赶便赶到这里，寻了这会，方遇此门，又不知深浅如何。倘不是这个门儿，却不惹他见怪？你两个且牵了马，还转石屏前立等片时，待老孙进去打听打听，察个有无虚实，却好行事。”沙僧听说，大喜道：</p>

<p>“好！好！好！正是粗中有细，果然急处从宽。”他二人牵马回头。</p>

<p>孙大圣显个神通，捻着诀，念个咒语，摇身一变，变作蜜蜂儿，真个轻巧！你看他：翅薄随风软，腰轻映日纤。嘴甜曾觅蕊，尾利善降蟾。酿蜜功何浅，投衙礼自谦。如今施巧计，飞舞入门檐。行者自门瑕处钻将进去，飞过二层门里，只见正当中花亭子上端坐着一个女怪，左右列几个彩衣绣服、丫髻两揫的女童，都欢天喜地，正不知讲论甚么。这行者轻轻的飞上去，钉在那花亭格子上，侧耳才听，又见两个总角蓬头女子，捧两盘热腾腾的面食，上亭来道：“奶奶，一盘是人肉馅的荤馍馍，一盘是邓沙馅的素馍馍。”那女怪笑道：“小的们，搀出唐御弟来。”</p>

<p>几个彩衣绣服的女童，走向后房，把唐僧扶出。那师父面黄唇白，眼红泪滴，行者在暗中嗟叹道：“师父中毒了！”</p>

<p>那怪走下亭，露春葱十指纤纤，扯住长老道：“御弟宽心，我这里虽不是西梁女国的宫殿，不比富贵奢华，其实却也清闲自在，正好念佛看经。我与你做个道伴儿，真个是百岁和谐也。”三藏不语，那怪道：“且休烦恼。我知你在女国中赴宴之时，不曾进得饮食。这里荤素面饭两盘，凭你受用些儿压惊。”</p>

<p>三藏沉思默想道：“我待不说话，不吃东西，此怪比那女王不同，女王还是人身，行动以礼；此怪乃是妖神，恐为加害，奈何？</p>

<p>我三个徒弟，不知我困陷在于这里，倘或加害，却不枉丢性命？”以心问心，无计所奈，只得强打精神，开口道：“荤的何如？</p>

<p>素的何如？”女怪道：“荤的是人肉馅馍馍，素的是邓沙馅馍馍。”三藏道：“贫僧吃素。”那怪笑道：“女童，看热茶来，与你家长爷爷吃素馍馍。”一女童，果捧着香茶一盏，放在长老面前。</p>

<p>那怪将一个素馍馍劈破，递与三藏。三藏将个荤馍馍囫囵递与女怪。女怪笑道：“御弟，你怎么不劈破与我？”三藏合掌道：“我出家人，不敢破荤。”那女怪道：“你出家人不敢破荤，怎么前日在子母河边吃水高，今日又好吃邓沙馅？”三藏道：“水高船去急，沙陷马行迟。”行者在格子眼听着两个言语相攀，恐怕师父乱了真性，忍不住，现了本相，掣铁棒喝道：“孽畜无礼！”那女怪见了，口喷一道烟光，把花亭子罩住，教：“小的们，收了御弟！”他却拿一柄三股钢叉，跳出亭门，骂道：“泼猴惫懒！怎么敢私入吾家，偷窥我容貌！不要走！吃老娘一叉！”这大圣使铁棒架住，且战且退。</p>

<p>二人打出洞外，那八戒、沙僧，正在石屏前等候，忽见他两人争持，慌得八戒将白马牵过道：“沙僧，你只管看守行李马匹，等老猪去帮打帮打。”好呆子，双手举钯，赶上前叫道：“师兄靠后，让我打这泼贱！”那怪见八戒来，他又使个手段，呼了一声，鼻中出火，口内生烟，把身子抖了一抖，三股叉飞舞冲迎。那女怪也不知有几只手，没头没脸的滚将来。这行者与八戒，两边攻住。那怪道：“孙悟空，你好不识进退！我便认得你，你是不认得我。你那雷音寺里佛如来，也还怕我哩，量你这两个毛人，到得那里！都上来，一个个仔细看打！”这一场怎见得好战：女怪威风长，猴王气概兴。天蓬元帅争功绩，乱举钉钯要显能。那一个手多叉紧烟光绕，这两个性急兵强雾气腾。女怪只因求配偶，男僧怎肯泄元精！阴阳不对相持斗，各逞雄才恨苦争。阴静养荣思动动，阳收息卫爱清清。致令两处无和睦，叉钯铁棒赌输赢。这个棒有力，钯更能，女怪钢叉丁对丁。毒敌山前三不让，琵琶洞外两无情。那一个喜得唐僧谐凤侣，这两个必随长老取真经。惊天动地来相战，只杀得日月无光星斗更！三个斗罢多时，不分胜负。那女怪将身一纵，使出个倒马毒桩，不觉的把大圣头皮上扎了一下。行者叫声“苦啊！”忍耐不得，负痛败阵而走。八戒见事不谐，拖着钯彻身而退。那怪得了胜，收了钢叉。</p>

<p>行者抱头，皱眉苦面，叫声“利害！利害！”八戒到跟前问道：“哥哥，你怎么正战到好处，却就叫苦连天的走了？”行者抱着头，只叫：“疼！疼！疼！”沙僧道：“想是你头风发了？”行者跳道：“不是！不是！”八戒道：“哥哥，我不曾见你受伤，却头疼，何也？”行者哼哼的道：“了不得！了不得！我与他正然打处，他见我破了他的叉势，他就把身子一纵，不知是件甚么兵器，着我头上扎了一下，就这般头疼难禁，故此败了阵来。”八戒笑道：</p>

<p>“只这等静处常夸口，说你的头是修炼过的。却怎么就不禁这一下儿？”行者道：“正是，我这头自从修炼成真，盗食了蟠桃仙酒，老子金丹，大闹天宫时，又被玉帝差大力鬼王、二十八宿，押赴斗牛宫处处斩，那些神将使刀斧锤剑，雷打火烧，及老子把我安于八卦炉，锻炼四十九日，俱未伤损。今日不知这妇人用的是甚么兵器，把老孙头弄伤也！”沙僧道：“你放了手，等我看看。莫破了！”行者道：“不破！不破！”八戒道：“我去西梁国讨个膏药你贴贴。”行者道：“又不肿不破，怎么贴得膏药？”八戒笑道：“哥啊，我的胎前产后病倒不曾有，你倒弄了个脑门痈了。”沙僧道：“二哥且休取笑。如今天色晚矣，大哥伤了头，师父又不知死活，怎的是好！”行者哼道：“师父没事。我进去时，变作蜜蜂儿，飞入里面，见那妇人坐在花亭子上。少顷，两个丫鬟，捧两盘馍馍：一盘是人肉馅，荤的；一盘是邓沙馅，素的。又着两个女童扶师父出来吃一个压惊，又要与师父做甚么道伴儿。师父始初不与那妇人答话，也不吃馍馍，后见他甜言美语，不知怎么，就开口说话，却说吃素的。那妇人就将一个素的劈开递与师父，师父将个囫囵荤的递与那妇人。妇人道：‘怎不劈破？’师父道：‘出家人不敢破荤。’那妇人道：‘既不破荤，前日怎么在子母河边饮水高，今日又好吃邓沙馅？’师父不解其意，答他两句道：‘水高船去急，沙陷马行迟。’我在格子上听见，恐怕师父乱性，便就现了原身，掣棒就打。他也使神通，喷出烟雾，叫收了御弟，就轮钢叉，与老孙打出洞来也。”沙僧听说，咬指道：“这泼贱也不知从那里就随将我们来，把上项事都知道了！”八戒道：“这等说，便我们安歇不成？莫管甚么黄昏半夜，且去他门上索战，嚷嚷闹闹，搅他个不睡，莫教他捉弄了我师父。”行者道：“头疼，去不得！”沙僧道：“不须索战。一则师兄头痛，二来我师父是个真僧，决不以色空乱性，且就在山坡下，闭风处，坐这一夜，养养精神，待天明再作理会。”遂此三个弟兄，拴牢白马，守护行囊，就在坡下安歇不题。</p>

<p>却说那女怪放下凶恶之心，重整欢愉之色，叫：“小的们，把前后门都关紧了。”又使两个支更，防守行者，但听门响，即时通报。却又教：“女童，将卧房收拾齐整，掌烛焚香，请唐御弟来，我与他交欢。”遂把长老从后边搀出。那女怪弄出十分娇媚之态，携定唐僧道：“常言黄金未为贵，安乐值钱多。且和你做会夫妻儿，耍子去也。”这长老咬定牙关，声也不透。欲待不去，恐他生心害命，只得战兢兢，跟着他步入香房，却如痴如哑，那里抬头举目，更不曾看他房里是甚床铺幔帐，也不知有甚箱笼梳妆，那女怪说出的雨意云情，亦漠然无听。好和尚，真是那：</p>

<p>目不视恶色，耳不听淫声。他把这锦绣娇容如粪土，金珠美貌若灰尘。一生只爱参禅，半步不离佛地。那里会惜玉怜香，只晓得修真养性。那女怪，活泼泼，春意无边；这长老，死丁丁，禅机有在。一个似软玉温香，一个如死灰槁木。那一个，展鸳衾，淫兴浓浓；这一个，束褊衫，丹心耿耿。那个要贴胸交股和鸾凤，这个要画壁归山访达摩。女怪解衣，卖弄他肌香肤腻；唐僧敛衽，紧藏了糙肉粗皮。女怪道：“我枕剩衾闲何不睡？”唐僧道：“我头光服异怎相陪！”那个道：“我愿作前朝柳翠翠。”这个道：“贫僧不是月阇黎。”女怪道：“我美若西施还袅娜。”唐僧道：“我越王因此久埋尸。”女怪道：“御弟，你记得宁教花下死，做鬼也风流？”唐僧道：“我的真阳为至宝，怎肯轻与你这粉骷髅。”他两个散言碎语的，直斗到更深，唐长老全不动念。那女怪扯扯拉拉的不放，这师父只是老老成成的不肯。直缠到有半夜时候，把那怪弄得恼了，叫：“小的们，拿绳来！”可怜将一个心爱的人儿，一条绳，捆的象个猱狮模样，又教拖在房廊下去，却吹灭银灯，各归寝处。</p>

<p>一夜无词，不觉的鸡声三唱。那山坡下孙大圣欠身道：“我这头疼了一会，到如今也不疼不麻，只是有些作痒。”八戒笑道：“痒便再教他扎一下，何如？”行者啐了一口道：“放放放！”</p>

<p>八戒又笑道：“放放放！我师父这一夜倒浪浪浪！”沙僧道：“且莫斗口，天亮了，快赶早儿捉妖怪去。”行者道：“兄弟，你只管在此守马，休得动身。猪八戒跟我去。”那呆子抖擞精神，束一束皂锦直裰，相随行者，各带了兵器，跳上山崖，径至石屏之下。行者道：“你且立住，只怕这怪物夜里伤了师父，先等我进去打听打听。倘若被他哄了，丧了元阳，真个亏了德行，却就大家散火；若不乱性情，禅心未动，却好努力相持，打死精怪，救师西去。”八戒道：“你好痴哑！常言道，干鱼可好与猫儿作枕头？就不如此，就不如此，也要抓你儿把是！”行者道：“莫胡疑乱说，待我看去。”</p>

<p>好大圣，转石屏，别了八戒，摇身还变个蜜蜂儿，飞入门里，见那门里有两个丫鬟，头枕着梆铃，正然睡哩。却到花亭子观看，那妖精原来弄了半夜，都辛苦了，一个个都不知天晓，还睡着哩。行者飞来后面，隐隐的只听见唐僧声唤，忽抬头，见那步廊下四马攒蹄捆着师父。行者轻轻的钉在唐僧头上，叫：“师父。”唐僧认得声音，道：“悟空来了？快救我命！”行者道：“夜来好事如何？”三藏咬牙道：“我宁死也不肯如此！”行者道：“昨日我见他有相怜相爱之意，却怎么今日把你这般挫折？”三藏道：</p>

<p>“他把我缠了半夜，我衣不解带，身未沾床。他见我不肯相从，才捆我在此。你千万救我取经去也！”他师徒们正然问答，早惊醒了那个妖精。妖精虽是下狠，却还有流连不舍之意，一觉翻身，只听见“取经去也”一句，他就滚下床来，厉声高叫道：“好夫妻不做，却取甚么经去！”行者慌了，撇却师父，急展翅，飞将出去，现了本相，叫声“八戒。”那呆子转过石屏道：“那话儿成了否？”行者笑道：“不曾！不曾！老师父被他摩弄不从，恼了，捆在那里，正与我诉说前情，那怪惊醒了，我慌得出来也。”八戒道：“师父曾说甚来？”行者道：“他只说衣不解带，身未沾床。”八戒笑道：“好！好！好！还是个真和尚！我们救他去！”</p>

<p>呆子粗鲁，不容分说，举钉钯，望他那石头门上尽力气一钯，唿喇喇筑做几块。唬得那几个枕梆铃睡的丫环，跑至二层门外，叫声：“开门！前门被昨日那两个丑男人打破了！”那女怪正出房门，只见四五个丫鬟跑进去报道：“奶奶，昨日那两个丑男人又来把前门已打碎矣。”那怪闻言，即忙叫：“小的们！快烧汤洗面梳妆！”叫：“把御弟连绳抬在后房收了，等我打他去！”好妖精，走出来，举着三股叉骂道：“泼猴！野彘！老大无知！你怎敢打破我门！”八戒骂道：“滥淫贱货！你倒困陷我师父，返敢硬嘴！我师父是你哄将来做老公的，快快送出饶你！敢再说半个不字，老猪一顿钯，连山也筑倒你的！”那妖精那容分说，抖擞身躯，依前弄法，鼻口内喷烟冒火，举钢叉就刺八戒。八戒侧身躲过，着钯就筑，孙大圣使铁棒并力相帮。那怪又弄神通，也不知是几只手，左右遮拦，交锋三五个回合，不知是甚兵器，把八戒嘴唇上，也又扎了一下。那呆子拖着钯，侮着嘴，负痛逃生。</p>

<p>行者却也有些醋他，虚丢一棒，败阵而走。那妖精得胜而回，叫小的们搬石块垒迭了前门不题。</p>

<p>却说那沙和尚正在坡前放马，只听得那里猪哼，忽抬头，见八戒侮着嘴，哼将来。沙僧道：“怎的说？”呆子哼道：“了不得！了不得！疼疼疼！”说不了，行者也到跟前笑道：“好呆子啊！</p>

<p>昨日咒我是脑门痈，今日却也弄做个肿嘴瘟了！”八戒哼道：</p>

<p>“难忍难忍！疼得紧！利害，利害！”三人正然难处，只见一个老妈妈儿，左手提着一个青竹篮儿，自南山路上挑菜而来。沙僧道：“大哥，那妈妈来得近了，等我问他个信儿，看这个是甚妖精，是甚兵器，这般伤人。”行者道：“你且住，等老孙问他去来。”行者急睁睛看，只见头直上有祥云盖顶，左右有香雾笼身。行者认得，即叫：“兄弟们，还不来叩头！那妈妈是菩萨来也。”慌得猪八戒忍疼下拜，沙和尚牵马躬身，孙大圣合掌跪下，叫声“南无大慈大悲救苦救难灵感观世音菩萨。”那菩萨见他们认得元光，即踏祥云，起在半空，现了真象，原来是鱼篮之象。行者赶到空中，拜告道：“菩萨，恕弟子失迎之罪！我等努力救师，不知菩萨下降，今遇魔难难收，万望菩萨搭救搭救！”</p>

<p>菩萨道：“这妖精十分利害，他那三股叉是生成的两只钳脚。扎人痛者，是尾上一个钩子，唤做倒马毒。本身是个蝎子精。他前者在雷音寺听佛谈经，如来见了，不合用手推他一把，他就转过钩子，把如来左手中拇指上扎了一下，如来也疼难禁，即着金刚拿他，他却在这里。若要救得唐僧，除是别告一位方好，我也是近他不得。”行者再拜道：“望菩萨指示指示，别告那位去好，弟子即去请他也。”菩萨道：“你去东天门里光明宫告求昴日星官，方能降伏。”言罢，遂化作一道金光，径回南海。</p>

<p>孙大圣才按云头，对八戒沙僧道：“兄弟放心，师父有救星了。”沙僧道：“是那里救星？”行者道：“才然菩萨指示，教我告请昴日星官，老孙去来。”八戒侮着嘴哼道：“哥啊！就问星官讨些止疼的药饵来！”行者笑道：“不须用药，只似昨日疼过夜就好了。”沙僧道：“不必烦叙，快早去罢。”好行者，急忙驾筋斗云，须臾到东天门外。忽见增长天王当面作礼道：“大圣何往？”</p>

<p>行者道：“因保唐僧西方取经，路遇魔障缠身，要到光明宫见昴日星官走走。”忽又见陶张辛邓四大元帅，也问何往，行者道：</p>

<p>“要寻昴日星官去降妖救师。”四元帅道：“星官今早奉玉帝旨意，上观星台巡札去了。”行者道：“可有这话？”辛天君道：“小将等与他同下斗牛宫，岂敢说假？”陶天君道：“今已许久，或将回矣。大圣还先去光明宫，如未回，再去观星台可也。”大圣遂喜，即别他们，至光明宫门首，果是无人，复抽身就走，只见那壁厢有一行兵士摆列，后面星官来了。那星官还穿的是拜驾朝衣，一身金缕，但见他：冠簪五岳金光彩，笏执山河玉色琼。袍挂七星云叆叇，腰围八极宝环明。叮当珮响如敲韵，迅速风声似摆铃。翠羽扇开来昴宿，天香飘袭满门庭。</p>

<p>前行的兵士，看见行者立于光明宫外，急转身报道：“主公，孙大圣在这里也。”那星官敛云雾整束朝衣，停执事分开左右，上前作礼道：“大圣何来？”行者道：“专来拜烦救师父一难。”星官道：“何难？在何地方？”行者道：“在西梁国毒敌山琵琶洞。”星官道：“那山洞有甚妖怪，却来呼唤小神？”行者道：</p>

<p>“观音菩萨适才显化，说是一个蝎子精，特举先生方能治得，因此来请。”星官道：“本欲回奏玉帝，奈大圣至此，又感菩萨举荐，恐迟误事，小神不敢请献茶，且和你去降妖精，却再来回旨罢。”大圣闻言，即同出东天门，直至西梁国。望见毒敌山不远，行者指道：“此山便是。”星官按下云头，同行者至石屏前山坡之下。沙僧见了道：“二哥起来，大哥请得星官来了。”那呆子还侮着嘴道：“恕罪恕罪！有病在身，不能行礼。”星官道：“你是修行之人，何病之有？”八戒道：“早间与那妖精交战，被他着我唇上扎了一下，至今还疼呀。”星官道：“你上来，我与你医治医治。”呆子才放了手，口里哼哼喷喷道：“千万治治！待好了谢你。”那星官用手把嘴唇上摸了一摸，吹一口气，就不疼了。呆子欢喜下拜道：“妙啊！妙啊！”行者笑道：“烦星官也把我头上摸摸。”星官道：“你未遭毒，摸他何为？”行者道：“昨日也曾遭过，只是过了夜，才不疼，如今还有些麻痒，只恐发天阴，也烦治治。”星官真个也把头上摸了一摸，吹口气，也就解了余毒，不麻不痒了。八戒发狠道：“哥哥，去打那泼贱去！”星官道：“正是正是，你两个叫他出来，等我好降他。”</p>

<p>行者与八戒跳上山坡，又至石屏之后。呆子口里乱骂，手似捞钩，一顿钉钯，把那洞门外垒迭的石块爬开，闯至一层门，又一钉钯，将二门筑得粉碎。慌得那门里小妖飞报：“奶奶！那两个丑男人，又把二层门也打破了！”那怪正教解放唐僧，讨素茶饭与他吃哩，听见打破二门，即便跳出花亭子，轮叉来刺八戒。八戒使钉钯迎架，行者在旁，又使铁棒来打。那怪赶至身边，要下毒手，他两个识得方法，回头就走。那怪赶过石屏之后，行者叫声：“昴宿何在？”只见那星官立于山坡上，现出本相，原来是一只双冠子大公鸡，昂起头来，约有六七尺高，对着妖精叫一声，那怪即时就现了本象，是个琵琶来大小的蝎子精。星官再叫一声，那怪浑身酥软，死在坡前。有诗为证，诗曰：</p>

<p>花冠绣颈若团缨，爪硬距长目怒睛。踊跃雄威全五德，峥嵘壮势羡三鸣。岂如凡鸟啼茅屋，本是天星显圣名。毒蝎枉修人道行，还原反本见真形。八戒上前，一只脚躧住那怪的胸背道：</p>

<p>“孽畜！今番使不得倒马毒了！”那怪动也不动，被呆子一顿钉钯，捣作一团烂酱。那星官复聚金光，驾云而去。行者与八戒沙僧朝天拱谢道：“有累有累！改日赴宫拜酬。”三人谢毕，却才收拾行李马匹，都进洞里，见那大小丫环，两边跪下拜道：“爷爷，我们不是妖邪，都是西梁国女人，前者被这妖精摄来的。你师父在后边香房里坐着哭哩。”行者闻言，仔细观看，果然不见妖气，遂入后边叫道：“师父！”那唐僧见众齐来，十分欢喜道：</p>

<p>“贤徒，累及你们了！那妇人何如也？”八戒道：“那厮原是个大母蝎子。幸得观音菩萨指示，大哥去天宫里请得那昴日星官下降，把那厮收伏。才被老猪筑做个泥了，方敢深入于此，得见师父之面。”唐僧谢之不尽。又寻些素米、素面，安排了饮食，吃了一顿，把那些摄将来的女子赶下山，指与回家之路。点上一把火，把几间房宇，烧毁罄尽，请唐僧上马，找寻大路西行。正是：</p>

<p>割断尘缘离色相，推干金海悟禅心。毕竟不知几年上才得成真，且听下回分解。</p>
