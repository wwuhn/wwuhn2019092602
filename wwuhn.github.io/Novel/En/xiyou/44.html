<P>At the Black River a Monster Carries Off the Priest</P>
<P>The Dragon Prince of the West Captures an Alligator</P>
</div>
<P>The story tell how the Bodhisattva recited the spell several times before stopping. Only then did the evil spirit's agony cease. When he recovered, stood up and looked at himself he found that he had gold bands rounds his neck, hands and feet. They were painfully tight, and try as he would he could not move them at all. The treasures had already taken root in his flesh, and the more he rubbed them the more they hurt.</P>
<P>&#8220;There, there, little darling,&#8221; mocked Monkey. &#8220;The Bodhisattva's put a lucky amulet ring round your neck to make sure you grow up safely.&#8221;</P>
<P>This jibe infuriated the boy, who grabbed his spear once more and started lunging wildly at Monkey. Monkey nimbly avoided it and went behind the Bodhisattva, yelling, &#8220;Say the spell, say the spell.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Bodhisattva moistened her willow sprig with sweet dew, and flicked the ambrosial liquid at him with a call of &#8220;Together!&#8221; The boy dropped his spear and put his hands together in front of his chest, unable to pull them apart. The &#8220;Guanyin twist&#8221; that some people still have today is what he had. Only when he could not pick up his spear because his hands were inseparably joined did the boy appreciate the deep mystery of the power of the Dharma. He could do no other than lower his head in a kowtow.</P>
<P>The Bodhisattva then recited another true spell and turned her vase over to take back the whole seaful of water. Not half a drop was left behind. &#8220;Wukong,&#8221; she said to Monkey, &#8220;this demon has now surrendered. The only thing is that he still has some wild ideas. He will-only accept the Dharma after he has gone from here to Potaraka Island making a kowtow at every step of the journey. You must go straight back to the cave to rescue your master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As your disciple has put you to the trouble of this long journey,&#8221; said Monkey with a kowtow, &#8220;I should see you some of your way back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No need,&#8221; said the Bodhisattva. &#8220;I am worried for your master's life.&#8221; Brother Monkey then kowtowed to take his leave of her joyfully. The evil spirit was now converted to the True Achievement by Guanyin, who became his fifty-third religious teacher.</P>
<P>The story now turns from how the Bodhisattva won a page boy through her wisdom to Friar Sand, who had long been sitting in the woods waiting for Monkey. When Monkey did not come back he tied the luggage on the back of the horse, and leading it by its bridle with one hand and holding his demon-quelling staff in the other he went out of the pine woods to take a look to the South. Seeing Monkey returning in a very good mood, Friar Sand went up to him and said, &#8220;Brother, why has it taken you so long to get back from asking the Bodhisattva to come? I've been half dead from worry.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You must have been asleep and dreaming,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I've already brought her here and she has subdued the demon.&#8221; Monkey then told him all about the Bodhisattva's Dharma power. &#8220;Let's go and rescue the master,&#8221; said Friar Sand with delight.</P>
<P>The two of them then leapt across the ravine and rushed to the doors, where they tethered the horse. Then they charged in together, their weapons at the ready, and wiped out the devils. They let the leather bag down to release Pig, who thanked Monkey and asked, &#8220;Where's that evil spirit, brother? Just let me have a go at him with my rake; I want to get my own back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Let's find the master,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>The three of them went right to the back of the cave, where they found their master tied up stark naked and weeping in the rear courtyard. Friar Sand untied him while Monkey fetched his clothes to dress him. The three of them then knelt before him and said, &#8220;Master, you have suffered terribly.&#8221;</P>

<P>Sanzang thanked them and said, &#8220;Dear disciples, I have put you to great trouble. How was the demon subdued?&#8221; Monkey then told him how the Bodhisattva had been asked to come and had taken the boy as her page. (This is what people refer to nowadays when they talk about the page boy submitting to the Bodhisattva, and respecting her as his fifty-third teacher after visiting the Buddha on three occasions.)</P>
<P>Monkey told Friar Sand to collect all the valuables in the cave then find some rice to prepare a vegetarian meal for the master. The venerable elder owed his life entirely to the Great Sage Sun; and it was on the Handsome Monkey Spirit that he depended to fetch the scriptures. Master and disciples then left the cave. The horse was saddled up, and once they found the main trail they headed West with wholehearted determination.</P>
<P>One day when they had been travelling for over a month Sanzang heard the sound of a river. &#8220;Disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang in great alarm, &#8220;what river is that?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're much too much of a worrier, old Master,&#8221; laughed Monkey &#8220;ever to become a priest. Why should you alone among the four of us hear water? Have you forgotten your<I> Heart Sutra?&#8221;</I></P>
<P>&#8220;I was taught the fifty-four sentences and 270 words of that sutra on Pagoda Mountain by the Rook's Nest Hermit in person,&#8221; replied Sanzang. &#8220;I learned them by ear and I constantly repeat them to myself. Which sentence of it have I forgotten?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Brother Monkey, &#8220;you've forgotten the sentence, 'There is no sight, no sound, no smell, no taste, no touch and no mental process.' We men of religion should not look on beauty, hear music, smell sweet fragrances, or taste good flavors. We should not even notice whether we are hot or cold, and our minds should be free from delusion. This is the way to repel the Six Bandits that attack eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind. Because of your mission to fetch the scriptures you are constantly worrying. You are afraid of evil monsters because you cling to your body. When you ask for vegetarian food your tongue is moved. If you enjoy a pleasant aroma it stimulates your nose. Sounds startle your ears. By looking at things you fasten your eyes on them. If you will keep on inviting the Six Bandits in over and over again how can you ever expect to reach the Western Heaven and see the Buddha?&#8221;</P>
<P>At this Sanzang fell into deep and silent thought for a while, then said, &#8220;Disciple,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When many years ago from my emperor I was parted,</P>
<P>On endless days and nights of travelling I started.</P>
<P>In the mists upon the mountains my grass sandal were worn through;</P>
<P>Many ridges have I climbed in my rain-hat of bamboo.</P>
<P>How often have I sighed when the gibbons call at night?</P>
<P>I cannot bear to listen to birds chirping in the moonlight.</P>
<P>When will I achieve the three Samadhis, I implore,</P>
<P>And obtain the Tathagata's most wonderful Law?&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When he had heard this Monkey could not help clapping his hands and laughing aloud. &#8220;Master,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you're suffering terribly from homesickness. If you really want to achieve the three Samadhis it isn't all difficult. As the saying goes, 'At the right time the achievement completes itself.'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, looking back to him, &#8220;if we keep on coming up against such terrible demons we'll never succeed in a thousand years.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother Pig,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;you're as coarse-tongued as I am. Stop irritating Monkey: he might lose his temper. Just keep on carrying your load and one day we'll finally succeed.&#8221;</P>
<P>They walked on as they talked, and the horse's hoofs never rested until they came to a great black river stretching as far as the eye could see. When the four of them stood on the bank to take a close look they saw</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Wave upon turbid wave,</P>
<P>Eddies and muddy whirls.</P>
<P>Wave upon turbid wave churns up the dark waters,</P>
<P>Eddies and muddy whirls looking like grease.</P>
<P>From close up it does not reflect the human image;</P>
<P>For far around not a tree can be seen.</P>
<P>Rolling ink,</P>
<P>Seething ash.</P>
<P>Bubbles that rise are charcoal;</P>
<P>The flying foam is like shoveled coal-dust.</P>
<P>Cattle and sheep will not drink,</P>
<P>Magpie and crow avoid it.</P>
<P>Cattle and sheep will not drink its blackness;</P>
<P>Magpie and crow avoid its vast expanse.</P>
<P>Only the reeds by the bank grow as they should,</P>
<P>While the flowers and grass by the sandbank flourish green.</P>
<P>The world is full of rivers and lakes,</P>
<P>And many are its streams and marshes and springs,</P>
<P>But of all the places that people have seen in life,</P>
<P>The Black River of the West is not among them.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciples,&#8221; asked Sanzang as he dismounted, &#8220;why is this river so dark and turbid?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Someone's washed out an indigo dyeing-vat in it,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;No,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;somebody's been cleaning their inkstone in it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop making silly guesses, you two,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;and let's work out how we're going to get the master across.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'd have no problem crossing that river,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;I could ride a cloud or swim and be over it before you'd had time to eat a meal.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;And I could be across in an instant on a cloud or by walking on the water,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;It's easy enough for us,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;but the problem is the master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciples,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;how wide is this river?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Three or four miles,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;You three decide which of you will carry me across,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;Pig can carry you,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;It'd be hard,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;If I tried carrying him by cloud we wouldn't get three feet above the ground. As the saying goes, mortals are heavier than mountains. And if I tried to swim with him on my back we'd both drown.&#8221;</P>
<P>As they were talking on the bank a man appeared upstream rowing a little boat. &#8220;Disciples,&#8221; said Sanzang with delight, &#8220;here's a boat. Let's ask the boatman to take us across.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Boatman,&#8221; shouted Friar Sand, &#8220;ferry us over.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This isn't a ferry,&#8221; replied the man on the boat, &#8220;and I couldn't possibly ferry you over.&#8221; &#8220;'Helpfulness first, in Heaven and earth,'&#8220; said Friar Sand. &#8220;You may not be a ferryman, but we don't keep coming to pester you. We are Buddhists from the East sent by the emperor to fetch the scriptures. If you could have a little consideration and ferry us over we'd show you our gratitude.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this the boatman brought his craft over to the bank and said as he rested on his oars, &#8220;Masters, this boat's too small to take all of you over.&#8221; When Sanzang took a closer look he saw that the boat was carved from a single log with only enough room for two hollowed out in the middle.</P>
<P>&#8220;What shall we do?&#8221; Sanzang asked. &#8220;This boat can take us over in two trips,&#8221; said Friar Sand. At this Pig tried what he thought would be a clever way of saving himself some trouble and getting himself well in with the master. &#8220;Friar Sand,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you and Brother Monkey look after the luggage and the horse while I take the master over first. Then the man can come back for the horse. Brother Monkey can jump over the river.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Good idea,&#8221; nodded Monkey.</P>
<P>While the idiot supported the Tang Priest, the boatman pushed off and rowed straight into the main stream. Once they reached the middle there was a great roar as huge waves blotted out the heavens, and a terrible storm blew up. What a wind!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The skies were filled with angry clouds;</P>
<P>Towering black waves were whipped up in the river.</P>
<P>The flying sand from the river's banks was blotting out the sun;</P>
<P>All around the trees went down with cries that rose to heaven.</P>
<P>The churned-up rivers and seas struck terror into dragons,</P>
<P>While trees and flowers perished in the dust.</P>
<P>The blows were like the crash of thunder;</P>
<P>The mighty gusts all roared like hungry tigers.</P>
<P>Crabs, fish and prawns lay down to pray to heaven,</P>
<P>While birds and beasts were driven from their nests.</P>
<P>Disaster struck all boatmen on the lakes;</P>
<P>No human life was safe upon the seas.</P>
<P>The fisherman by the stream could barely hold his spear;</P>
<P>The river boatman could not punt his ferry.</P>
<P>Houses collapsed as bricks and tiles flew;</P>
<P>In the universal terror Mount Tai was shaken.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This wind was the work of the boatman, who was in fact a monster from the Black River. Watch as the Tang Priest and Pig plunge into the waters, boat and all. They disappeared without a trace, and nobody knew where they had been carried off to.</P>
<P>On the river bank Friar Sand and Monkey were desperate. &#8220;What are we to do?&#8221; they said. &#8220;The master keeps running into disaster. Now he's in trouble here at the Black River after escaping from the last demon and having a peaceful stretch of his journey.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Perhaps the boat capsized,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;let's look for him further downstream.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;it can't be that. If the boat had capsized Pig can swim and he'd certainly have saved the master and raised him above the water. I noticed there was something a bit wrong about the boatman just now, and I'm sure that he caused the wind and has taken the master down under the water.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why didn't you say so before?&#8221; asked Friar Sand. &#8220;Look after the horse and the luggage while I go to look for him in the water.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But the water doesn't look right either,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I don't think you'll be able to.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's nothing compared to the water in my Shifting Sands River,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;I can do it.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid monk took off his tunic, tied strips of cloth round his wrists and feet, and plunged into the waves with a great splash as he whirled his demon-quelling staff. As he strode through the waters he heard voices, so he drew aside to steal a look. He saw a pavilion, over the doors of which was written large PALACE OF THE GOD OF THE BLACK RIVER IN THE HENGYANG VALLEY.</P>
<P>He could hear a monster saying to himself as he sat there, &#8220;It's been hard work getting him, but this priest is a holy man who has cultivated his conduct for ten lives. One piece of his flesh is enough to make you immortal. I've waited for him long enough, and now my ambition has been fulfilled.&#8221;</P>
<P>Then he issued his orders: &#8220;Little ones, fetch the metal steamer at once, cook those two monks whole, then write an invitation and deliver it to my second uncle asking him over to eat them as a birthday feast.&#8221;</P>
<P>This was too much for Friar Sand's temper. He beat on the doors with his staff, yelling abusively, &#8220;Damned monsters, give me back my master the Tang Priest and my brother Pig this minute!&#8221; This gave the demons inside the doors such a fright that they ran in to report, &#8220;Disaster!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What disaster?&#8221; the old monster asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;There's a very sinister-looking monk outside beating at the outer doors and yelling for them.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this the monster sent for his armor, which the little demons brought in. When it was all properly tied on he went outside, holding his flail of steel pieces joined together by bamboo-shaped links. He was a vicious sight.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Round eyes gleamed fiery red in a square-cut face;</P>
<P>His blood-red lips were curled round an enormous mouth.</P>
<P>The whiskers of his beard were strands of wire;</P>
<P>The matted hair at his temples was cinnabar red.</P>
<P>He looked like the sinister Year Lord in his might,</P>
<P>With the angry face of furious thunder god.</P>
<P>The iron armor he wore was burnished with flowers,</P>
<P>And many a jewel was set in his golden helm.</P>
<P>Holding the flail of bamboo-shaped steel in his hand,</P>
<P>He stirred up a gale around him as he walked.</P>
<P>At birth he had been a creature of the waters,</P>
<P>But he left his native stream and turned to evil.</P>
<P>If you would like to know the true name of this spirit,</P>
<P>He used to be called the Little Alligator.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Who's that beating at my doors?&#8221; the demon roared.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll get you, you ignorant damned devil,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;Deceitful monster, disguising a yourself as a boatman and rowing over to snatch my master. Give him back at once and I'll spare your life.&#8221; The demon roared with laughter at this.</P>
<P>&#8220;Monk, you're throwing your life away,&#8221; said the monster. &#8220;Your master's mine now, and I'm going to steam him for a feast. Come here and see if you can beat me. If you can hold out for three rounds I'll give you your master back; but if you can't I'll cook you with him and you can forget all about going to the Western Heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>Friar Sand was now in a towering rage, and he swung at the monster's head with his staff, which the monster parried with his flail. The pair of them had a fine underwater battle:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The demon-quelling staff and the bamboo-link flail;</P>
<P>Two angry contenders fighting for mastery.</P>
<P>The millennial monster of the Black River,</P>
<P>And a former immortal from the Hall of Miraculous Mist.</P>
<P>One was greedy for Sanzang's flesh,</P>
<P>The other longed to save the Tang Priest's life.</P>
<P>As they fought beneath the waters</P>
<P>There was no way they both could succeed.</P>
<P>Frightened shrimps and fishes shook their heads and hid;</P>
<P>Crabs and turtles withdrew into their shells.</P>
<P>Then with a roll of drums the water palace demons</P>
<P>Joined in the fight and yelled before the gates.</P>
<P>The splendid monk, the true Friar Sand,</P>
<P>Stood all alone and let them see his might.</P>
<P>As they plunged through the waves no victor emerged;</P>
<P>Flail and staff were evenly matched.</P>
<P>All this was because the Tang Priest wanted</P>
<P>To visit the Buddha and fetch the scriptures.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When they had fought thirty rounds without result Friar Sand thought, &#8220;This monster is as good a fighter as I am. I'm not going to be able to beat him. I'll have to lure him out for Monkey to kill.&#8221; Friar Sand then pretended to drop his guard and took to his heels trailing his staff behind him.</P>
<P>But instead of chasing him the evil monster said, &#8220;Off you go then. I won't fight you any more. I'm going to write invitations for my guests.&#8221;</P>
<P>Friar Sand emerged from the waves snorting with fury. &#8220;Brother,&#8221; he said when he saw Monkey, &#8220;that monster's outrageous.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You were down a long time,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Is there an evil spirit? Did you find the master?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's a pavilion down there,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;with 'Palace of the God of the Black River in the Hengyang Valley' written over it. I hid there and listened to him talking. He told his underlings to wash the metal steamer ready to cook the master and Brother Pig and sent them to invite his uncle for a birthday feast. It made me so angry that I started beating at his doors. The monster came out with his flail of pieces of bamboo-shaped steel and fought me for ages. We must have gone thirty rounds without either of us coming out on top. I pretended to be beaten to lure him out here so that you could help me, but he was too clever to come after me. He went back in to write invitations, so I came out.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What sort of evil being is he?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;He looks a bit like a big soft-shelled turtle,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;If he's not one of those he's an alligator.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I wonder who his uncle is,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>Before the words were out of his mouth an old man emerged from a bend in the river, knelt at a great distance from them, and said, &#8220;The God of the Black River kowtows to the Great Sage.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Weren't you the evil spirit who rowed the boat?&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Trying to fool us again, are you?&#8221;</P>
<P>The old man wept and kowtowed as he replied, &#8220;I'm no monster, Great Sage. I'm the real god of this river. The evil spirit came here from the Western Ocean on a flood tide during the fifth month last year. He fought me, and as I'm so old I was no match for him, so he seized my Palace of the God of the Black River in the Hengyang Valley, and killed many of my watery tribe. I had to go to the sea to bring a case against him. But the Dragon King of the Western Sea is his uncle, so of course he threw my case out and told me to turn my palace over to the monster. I tried submitting a protest to Heaven, but I was too humble a river god to obtain an audience with the Jade Emperor. Now that you are here, Great Sage, I've come to pay my respects and submit to you. I beg you to avenge me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;From what you say the Dragon King of the Western Sea is in the wrong too,&#8221; said Brother Monkey. &#8220;Now that the monster has captured my master and my fellow-disciple, announced that he's going to steam them and invited his uncle, I've got to capture him. It's a good thing you came to tell me. Very well then, river god, you keep an eye on things with Friar Sand here while I go to the sea to arrest that dragon and make him capture the monster.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm very grateful, Great Sage,&#8221; said the river god.</P>
<P>Monkey went by somersault cloud straight to the Western Ocean, where he landed, made water-repelling magic with his hands, and parted the waves. He saw a black fish spirit who was carrying a golden invitation box shoot upstream like an arrow. Monkey met him head-on and smashed his skull open with a single blow of his iron cudgel, sending the poor spirit's brains flying and splitting his cheeks apart, and with a loud noise it emerged from the water. Monkey opened the box and found in it an invitation that read:</P>
<P>Your Excellency Second Uncle Ao,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Your nephew Tuo Jie bows in greeting and is deeply grateful for your kind regards. Today I have captured two priests from the East who are great rarities. Not daring to consume them myself, and remembering that your birthday is imminent, I have arranged a simple banquet to wish you eternal life. I beg that you honour me with your illustrious presence.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;That fellow has given me all the evidence I need for my case,&#8221; chuckled Monkey, tucking the invitation in his sleeve and carrying on his way. By then a yaksha patrolling the sea had noticed Monkey and rushed straight back to the crystal palace to report to the dragon king, &#8220;Lord Monkey, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven, is here.&#8221;</P>
<P>The dragon king Ao Shun led his watery tribe from the palace to welcome Monkey: &#8220;Great Sage, won't you come into my humble palace for a while and take a cup of tea?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've never had a single cup of your tea,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;but you've drunk my wine before now.&#8221;</P>
<P>To this the dragon king replied with a smile, &#8220;Great Sage, you have always been a faithful follower of the Buddha and have never touched meat or alcohol. You've never invited me to drinks.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You may never have been over for drinks, but you're already in trouble for being a boozer,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;How am I in trouble?&#8221; asked Ao Shun with horror. Monkey produced the invitation and handed it to the dragon king.</P>
<P>At the sight of this the dragon king was scared out of his wits. He fell to his knees in panic, kowtowed and said, &#8220;Forgive me, Great Sage. That awful boy is my younger sister's ninth son. My brother-in-law, her husband, sent the wrong amount of wind and cut down on the rain. A heavenly edict was sent to the human prime minister Wei Zheng, who beheaded him in a dream. I brought my sister here because she had nowhere else to live and bring the boy up. Two years ago a disease killed her, and as the boy was then homeless I sent him to nourish his nature and cultivate the truth in the Black River. I never imagined he'd commit such terrible sins, and now I'll send people to arrest him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How many fine sons did your sister have?&#8221; asked Monkey. &#8220;Are they all monsters?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Nine,&#8221; the dragon king replied. &#8220;The other eight have turned out well. The eldest is the Little Yellow Dragon, and he lives in the Huai River. The second is the Little Black Dragon who lives in the River Ji. The third is the Blue-backed Dragon who occupies the Yangtse. The Red-whiskered Dragon is the fourth son, and he holds the Yellow River. The fifth is the Vain-effort Dragon who looks after the bell for the Lord Buddha. Guardian Dragon is the sixth, and he sits guarding the roof of the Heavenly Palace. Respectful Dragon is the seventh; he holds up the winged column at the Jade Emperor's court. The eighth is Clam Dragon who lives with my eldest brother on Mount Tai. The youngest, Alligator Dragon, has had no particular duties since he is still young. He was only sent to the Black River to nourish his nature last year. He hasn't yet won himself any fame or been transferred and given a job elsewhere. I never expected that he would disobey me by offending you, Great Sage.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he laughed and said, &#8220;How many husbands has your sister had?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Only one,&#8221; Ao Shun replied, &#8220;the Dragon King of the Jing River. After his execution she lived here as a widow until she died of an illness the year before last.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How could one husband and one wife have had so many little bastards?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's as the saying goes, there are nine kinds of dragons born, and each one is different,&#8221; Ao Shun replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;I lost my patience just now,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;With this invitation as evidence I was going to submit a complaint to the Heavenly Court and charge you with conspiring with a monster to kidnap. But from what you tell me the wretch refused to follow your advice, so I'll let you off this time, partly out of respect for your elder brother and partly because that wretch is too young to know any better. Besides, you didn't know what was happening. But you must send someone at once to arrest him and rescue my master. Then we'll decide what to do.&#8221;</P>
<P>Ao Shun then told his son Mo'ang, &#8220;Take five hundred of our strongest prawn and fish soldiers to arrest and charge Alligator immediately. At the same time arrange a banquet as an apology to the Great Sage.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no need to worry so, Your Majesty,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I've already told you I'll let you off, so why bother with the banquet? But I would like to go with your son as my master has been wronged and my fellow-disciples are waiting for me.&#8221;</P>
<P>The dragon king tried hard to make him stay, but without success. Then a dragon maiden came in with tea, a cup of which Monkey drank standing up before taking his leave of the old dragon and leaving the Western Sea with Mo'ang and his troops. Soon they were back at the Black River, where Monkey said, &#8220;Catch the demon, Your Royal Highness, while I wait on the bank.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry, Great Sage,&#8221; said Mo'ang. &#8220;I'll arrest him show him to you, Great Sage, to sentence and punish, and return your master to you. Only then will I take him back to the ocean and see my father.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey took leave of him cheerfully, recited the water-repelling spell and made it with his hands, sprang out of the waves, and made straight for the East bank, where Friar Sand and the river god said, &#8220;When you went it was by air, so why have you come back from under the water?&#8221; Monkey told them all about how he had killed the fish spirit, taken the invitation, charged the dragon king, and brought soldiers back with the dragon prince. Friar Sand was very pleased, and they all stood on the bank waiting.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Prince Mo'ang sent a herald to the gates of the underwater palace to announce to the evil spirit, &#8220;Prince Mo'ang, son of the Old Dragon King of the Western Sea, is here.&#8221; This news aroused the suspicions of the evil spirit as he sat inside.</P>
<P>&#8220;I sent a black fish spirit with an invitation to my uncle some time ago,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;and I haven't had any answer yet. Why is my cousin here instead?&#8221;</P>
<P>As he was thinking, a little demon came in from a river patrol to report, &#8220;Your Majesty, there's a detachment of troops camped in the river West of the palace. Their banner says 'Young Marshal Mo'ang, Crown Prince and Son of the Dragon King of the Western Sea.'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That cousin of mine is outrageous,&#8221; said the monster. &#8220;Presumably my uncle couldn't come and sent him to the feast instead, but he didn't have to bring an army with him. Hmm. There must be something up.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Little ones,&#8221; he said, &#8220;get my armor and my steel flail ready in case things turn rough while I go out to greet him and see what's happening.&#8221; On hearing the orders all the devils rubbed their hands and got ready.</P>
<P>When the alligator came out he saw a whole force of sea soldiers camped there on the right:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Embroidered sashes and flying banners,</P>
<P>Coloured halberds brighter than the dawn,</P>
<P>Fine swords coldly gleaming,</P>
<P>Spears with many a handsome tassel,</P>
<P>Bows drawn back like the moon,</P>
<P>Arrows like teeth of wolves,</P>
<P>Dazzling broadswords,</P>
<P>Grit-hard maces.</P>
<P>There were whales, turtles, and clams,</P>
<P>Crabs, tortoises, fish and prawns,</P>
<P>All drawn up by size,</P>
<P>Their weapons as dense-packed as a field of hemp.</P>
<P>Unless ordered by a superior officer</P>
<P>None would dare advance upon them.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the alligator demon saw them he went straight to the gates of their camp and shouted at the top of his voice, &#8220;Cousin, I'm waiting for you here with an invitation.&#8221;</P>
<P>A conch patrolling the camp went straight to the commander's tent to report, &#8220;Your Royal Highness, Alligator Dragon is outside with an invitation.&#8221;</P>
<P>The prince felt the helmet on his head, tightened the jeweled belt round his waist, picked up a three-edged mace, and hurried out of the camp. &#8220;What invitation do you have for me?&#8221; he asked.</P>
<P>Alligator Dragon bowed and replied, &#8220;This morning I sent your father an invitation. No doubt he did not think it worth coming and sent you instead. But why did you have to bring an army with you? Why have you encamped here armed to the teeth?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What did you invite my father to?&#8221; the crown prince asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Since I have been living here as a result of his kindness I have not seen his illustrious countenance for a long time or done my duty by him,&#8221; the alligator replied. &#8220;Yesterday I caught a priest from the East who has, they say, cultivated his conduct for ten lives in succession. If you eat his body you can live much longer. I wanted to invite uncle to have a look at the priest before I cook him in the steamer as a birthday treat.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Complete and utter fool,&#8221; yelled the crown prince. &#8220;Do you know who that priest is?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He's a priest from the Tang who's going to fetch scriptures from the Western Heaven,&#8221; the demon replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;All you know is that he's a Tang priest,&#8221; said the crown prince. &#8220;What you don't realize is what powerful disciples he has.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He's got one long-snouted one called Pig who I've captured already and I'm going to steam with the Tang Priest,&#8221; the alligator demon replied. &#8220;There's another disciple called Friar Sand, a dusky fellow with a sinister face who fights with the quarterstaff. He came to my gates yesterday demanding his master. I came out at the head of my river troops and it didn't take me long to see him off with my steel flail. I don't see what's so powerful about him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You still haven't got the message,&#8221; the dragon prince replied. &#8220;His senior disciple is the Golden Immortal of the Supreme Ultimate, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven who made havoc in Heaven five hundred years ago. He's now escorting the Tang Priest on his way to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures in the Western Heaven. He was converted by the compassionate and merciful Bodhisattva Guanyin of Potaraka, who changed his name to Sun Wukong the Novice. Why ever did you have to bring this catastrophe on yourself? He came across a messenger of yours in our ocean, took the invitation, and went straight into our crystal palace to make things very awkward for my father and myself. He has us on a charge of conspiring with evil spirits to kidnap. You'd better bring the Tang Priest and Pig straight to the bank, hand them back to the Great Sage Monkey, and join me in making apologies to him if you want to keep alive. If you even hint at a 'no' you can forget about remaining here in one piece.&#8221;</P>
<P>This threw the alligator monster into a terrible rage. &#8220;My own cousin taking their side!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;You'd have me hand the Tang Priest over, but nothing comes that easy in this world. Just because you're scared of him it doesn't mean that I am. If he's really got such powers and he has the guts to go three rounds with me in front of my palace gates I'll give him his master back. If he's no match for me I'll capture him too and cook him with the others. And this time there'll be no guests or relations; I'll fasten the doors, my little ones will sing and dance for me, and I'll sit in the place of honour and have a fine old time bloody well eating them myself.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Damned devil,&#8221; the crown prince swore back at him, &#8220;you're a disgrace. Even if you're not going to regard the Great Sage Monkey as a worthy foe will you dare to fight me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;A tough guy is afraid of nobody,&#8221; the demon replied. He then called for his armor, at which a host of little devils came forward with his armor and his steel flail. The two of them were now glaring at each other and each wanted to play the hero. The orders were given, the drums rolled, and a fight ensued that was much harder than the one with Friar Sand. What could be seen were:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Dazzling banners,</P>
<P>Gleaming halberds.</P>
<P>The encampment was quickly broken up,</P>
<P>While the gates of the palace were opened wide.</P>
<P>Prince Mo'ang wielded his golden mace;</P>
<P>That alligator parried with his flail.</P>
<P>Fierce were the river soldiers as the cannon roared;</P>
<P>Wild were the ocean warriors as the gong was beaten.</P>
<P>Shrimp fought with shrimp,</P>
<P>And crab with crab.</P>
<P>Whales and giant turtles swallowed red carp;</P>
<P>Bream and carp set mollusks running.</P>
<P>The shark and mullet put the mackerel to flight;</P>
<P>The mussels all panicked when oysters captured clams.</P>
<P>The swordfish barbs were hard as iron rods;</P>
<P>The barracudas needles were sharper than spears.</P>
<P>Sturgeons chased the white eel;</P>
<P>Perch and herring seized the back pomfret.</P>
<P>The river was full of battling demons,</P>
<P>While both side's dragon warriors contended.</P>
<P>The long melee stirred up the waves,</P>
<P>And Crown Prince Mo'ang was better than a vajrapani,</P>
<P>As he roared and struck at the head with his mace,</P>
<P>Capturing the alligator who caused the trouble.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The prince pretended to drop his guard with his three-bladed mace. Not realizing that this was a trick, the evil spirit rushed him, whereupon the crown prince skillfully first struck him a blow with the mace on the right arm that made him stumble, caught up with him, then struck at his feet and set him sprawling.</P>
<P>The ocean soldiers rushed up, seized Alligator, tied both hands behind his back, put an iron chain through his collar bone, hauled him up on the bank, and took him to Monkey, where the prince reported, &#8220;Great Sage, I have arrested the alligator demon and am handing him over to you for judgement.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You disobedient wretch,&#8221; said Monkey when he and Friar Sand saw the demon, &#8220;your uncle sent you to live here, build up your nature, and look after yourself. Once you had made your name he was going to transfer you to duties somewhere else. Why did you have to seize the river god's home and become a bully? Why did you use deception to capture my master and my brother? I was going to hit you, but this cudgel of mine hits so hard that a mere touch of it would finish you off. Where have you put my master?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; replied the demon, kowtowing ceaselessly, &#8220;this humble alligator had never heard of your mighty name. But now I have been arrested by my cousin for my disobedience to him and for my flagrant offences against right. I am endlessly grateful to you, Great Sage, for sparing my life. Your master is still tied up in the water palace. If you would take off the chain and untie my hands I will return to the river and bring him back to you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; said Prince Mo'ang who was standing beside them, &#8220;he is a vicious and deceitful beast. If you were to release him he might have evil ideas.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I know where his place is,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;I'll find the master.&#8221;</P>
<P>He and the river god then leapt into the river and went straight to the doors of the water palace, which were wide open and not guarded by a single soldier. Inside the pavilion they saw the Tang Priest and Pig tied up stark naked. Friar Sand quickly untied the master while the river god released Pig. Next they each carried one up to the surface of the water and then to the bank.</P>
<P>Seeing the evil spirit roped and in chains there Pig raised his rake to strike him and said abusively, &#8220;Evil beast, take this from me.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey held him back, saying, &#8220;Spare his life, brother, out of consideration for Ao Shun and his son.&#8221;</P>
<P>Mo'ang then bowed and said, &#8220;Great Sage, I must not stay here any longer. As I have rescued your master I shall now take this wretch to see my father. You have spared him the death penalty, but my father will not let him off other kinds of punishment. When he has been sentenced he will be sent back to apologize to you again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well then,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;take him away. Give my respects to your father and tell him that I'll be back to thank him in person another time.&#8221; The prince then plunged into the water with his prisoner and took his ocean troops straight back to be Western Sea.</P>
<P>The God of the Black River then thanked Brother Monkey for the recovery of his water palace. &#8220;Disciple,&#8221; said the Tang Priest, &#8220;we're still on the Eastern bank. How are we going to get across this river?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry about that, my lord,&#8221; said the river god. &#8220;Please mount your horse and I will lead you across the river.&#8221; The master then rode his horse while Pig led it, Friar Sand carried the luggage, and Monkey supported Sanzang. The river god did water-stopping magic to hold the waters back. In an instant a broad road opened up where the waters had withdrawn; master and disciples crossed to the West bank, climbed it, thanked the river god, and continued on their way. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>To visit the West the priest they did save;</P>
<P>When the river was crossed there was never a wave.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know how they visited the Buddha and obtained the scriptures, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>黑河妖孽擒僧去</p>
<p>西洋龙子捉鼍回</p>
</div>
<p>却说那菩萨念了几遍，却才住口，那妖精就不疼了。又正性起身看处，颈项里与手足上都是金箍，勒得疼痛，便就除那箍儿时，莫想褪得动分毫，这宝贝已此是见肉生根，越抹越痛。</p>

<p>行者笑道：“我那乖乖，菩萨恐你养不大，与你戴个颈圈镯头哩。”那童子闻此言，又生烦恼，就此绰起枪来，望行者乱刺。行者急闪身，立在菩萨后面，叫：“念咒！念咒！”那菩萨将杨柳枝儿，蘸了一点甘露洒将去，叫声“合！”只见他丢了枪，一双手合掌当胸，再也不能开放，至今留了一个观音扭，即此意也。那童子开不得手，拿不得枪，方知是法力深微，没奈何，才纳头下拜。菩萨念动真言，把净瓶敧倒，将那一海水，依然收去，更无半点存留，对行者道：“悟空，这妖精已是降了，却只是野心不定，等我教他一步一拜，只拜到落伽山，方才收法。你如今快早去洞中，救你师父去来！”行者转身叩头道：“有劳菩萨远涉，弟子当送一程。”菩萨道：“你不消送，恐怕误了你师父性命。”行者闻言，欢喜叩别。那妖精早归了正果，五十三参，参拜观音，且不题善菩萨收了童子。</p>

<p>却说那沙僧久坐林间，盼望行者不到，将行李捎在马上，一只手执着降妖宝杖，一只手牵着缰绳，出松林向南观看。只见行者欣喜而来。沙僧迎着道：“哥哥，你怎么去请菩萨，此时才来！焦杀我也！”行者道：“你还做梦哩，老孙已请了菩萨，降了妖怪。”行者却将菩萨的法力，备陈了一遍。沙僧十分欢喜道：“救师父去也！”他两个才跳过涧去，撞到门前，拴下马匹，举兵器齐打入洞里，剿净了群妖，解下皮袋，放出八戒来。那呆子谢了行者道：“哥哥，那妖精在那里？等我去筑他几钯，出出气来！”行者道：“且寻师父去。”三人径至后边，只见师父赤条条捆在院中哭哩。沙僧连忙解绳，行者即取衣服穿上，三人跪在面前道：“师父吃苦了。”三藏谢道：“贤徒啊，多累你等，怎生降得妖魔也？”行者又将请菩萨、收童子之言，备陈一遍。三藏听得，即忙跪下，朝南礼拜。行者道：“不消谢他，转是我们与他作福，收了一个童子。”如今说童子拜观音，五十三参，参参见佛，即此是也。教沙僧将洞内宝物收了，且寻米粮，安排斋饭，管待了师父。那长老得性命全亏孙大圣，取真经只靠美猴精。</p>

<p>师徒们出洞来，攀鞍上马，找大路，笃志投西。</p>

<p>行经一个多月，忽听得水声振耳，三藏大惊道！徒弟呀，又是那里水声？”行者笑道：“你这老师父，忒也多疑，做不得和尚。我们一同四众，偏你听见甚么水声。你把那《多心经》又忘了也？”唐僧道：“多心经乃浮屠山乌巢禅师口授，共五十四句，二百七十个字。我当时耳传，至今常念，你知我忘了那句儿？”</p>

<p>行者道：“老师父，你忘了‘无眼耳鼻舌身意’。我等出家人，眼不视色，耳不听声，鼻不嗅香，舌不尝味，身不知寒暑，意不存妄想，如此谓之祛褪六贼。你如今为求经，念念在意，怕妖魔不肯舍身，要斋吃动舌，喜香甜嗅鼻，闻声音惊耳，睹事物凝眸，招来这六贼纷纷，怎生得西天见佛？”三藏闻言，默然沉虑道：</p>

<p>“徒弟啊，我一自当年别圣君，奔波昼夜甚殷勤。芒鞋踏破山头雾，竹笠冲开岭上云。夜静猿啼殊可叹，月明鸟噪不堪闻。何时满足三三行，得取如来妙法文？”行者听毕，忍不住鼓掌大笑道：“这师父原来只是思乡难息！若要那三三行满，有何难哉！</p>

<p>常言道，功到自然成哩。”八戒回头道：“哥啊，若照依这般魔障凶高，就走上一千年也不得成功！”沙僧道：“二哥，你和我一般，拙口钝腮，不要惹大哥热擦。且只捱肩磨担，终须有日成功也。”</p>

<p>师徒们正话间，脚走不停，马蹄正疾，见前面有一道黑水滔天，马不能进。四众停立岸边，仔细观看，但见那：层层浓浪，迭迭浑波，层层浓浪翻乌潦，迭迭浑波卷黑油。近观不照人身影，远望难寻树木形。滚滚一地墨，滔滔千里灰。水沫浮来如积炭，浪花飘起似翻煤。牛羊不饮，鸦鹊难飞。牛羊不饮嫌深黑，鸦鹊难飞怕渺弥。只是岸上芦蘋知节令，滩头花草斗青奇。</p>

<p>湖泊江河天下有，溪源泽洞世间多。人生皆有相逢处，谁见西方黑水河！唐僧下马道：“徒弟，这水怎么如此浑黑？”八戒道：</p>

<p>“是那家泼了靛缸了。”沙僧道：“不然，是谁家洗笔砚哩。”行者道：“你们且休胡猜乱道，且设法保师父过去。”八戒道：“这河若是老猪过去不难，或是驾了云头，或是下河负水，不消顿饭时，我就过去了。”沙僧道：“若教我老沙，也只消纵云躧水，顷刻而过。”行者道：“我等容易，只是师父难哩。”三藏道：“徒弟啊，这河有多少宽么？”八戒道：“约摸有十来里宽。”三藏道：</p>

<p>“你三个计较，着那个驮我过去罢。”行者道：“八戒驮得。”八戒道：“不好驮。若是驮着腾云，三尺也不能离地，常言道，背凡人重若丘山。若是驮着负水，转连我坠下水去了。”</p>

<p>师徒们在河边，正都商议，只见那上溜头，有一人棹下一只小船儿来。唐僧喜道：“徒弟，有船来了。叫他渡我们过去。”</p>

<p>沙僧厉声高叫道：棹船的，来渡人！来渡人！”船上人道：“我不是渡船，如何渡人？”沙僧道：“天上人间，方便第一。你虽不是渡船，我们也不是常来打搅你的。我等是东土钦差取经的佛子，你可方便方便，渡我们过去，谢你。”那人闻言，却把船儿棹近岸边，扶着桨道：“师父啊，我这船小，你们人多，怎能全渡？”</p>

<p>三藏近前看了，那船儿原来是一段木头刻的，中间只有一个舱口，只好坐下两个人。三藏道：“怎生是好？”沙僧道：“这般啊，两遭儿渡罢。”八戒就使心术，要躲懒讨乖，道：“悟净，你与大哥在这边看着行李马匹，等我保师父先过去，却再来渡马。教大哥跳过去罢。”行者点头道：“你说的是。”</p>

<p>那呆子扶着唐僧，那梢公撑开船，举棹冲流，一直而去。方才行到中间，只听得一声响喨，卷浪翻波，遮天迷目。那阵狂风十分利害！好风：当空一片炮云起，中溜千层黑浪高。两岸飞沙迷日色，四边树倒振天号。翻江搅海龙神怕，播土扬尘花木凋。呼呼响若春雷吼，阵阵凶如饿虎哮。蟹鳖鱼虾朝上拜，飞禽走兽失窝巢。五湖船户皆遭难，四海人家命不牢。溪内渔翁难把钩，河间梢子怎撑篙？揭瓦翻砖房屋倒，惊天动地泰山摇。</p>

<p>这阵风，原来就是那棹船人弄的，他本是黑水河中怪物。眼看着那唐僧与猪八戒，连船儿淬在水里，无影无形，不知摄了那方去也。</p>

<p>这岸上，沙僧与行者心慌道：“怎么好？老师父步步逢灾，才脱了魔障，幸得这一路平安，又遇着黑水迍邅！”沙僧道：“莫是翻了船，我们往下溜头找寻去。”行者道：“不是翻船。若翻船，八戒会水，他必然保师父负水而出。我才见那个棹船的有些不正气，想必就是这厮弄风，把师父拖下水去了。”沙僧闻言道：“哥哥何不早说，你看着马与行李，等我下水找寻去来。”行者道：“这水色不正，恐你不能去。”沙僧道：“这水比我那流沙河如何？去得！去得！”</p>

<p>好和尚，脱了褊衫，札抹了手脚，轮着降妖宝杖，扑的一声，分开水路，钻入波中，大踏步行将进去。正走处，只听得有人言语。沙僧闪在旁边，偷睛观看，那壁厢有一座亭台，台门外横封了八个大字，乃是“衡阳峪黑水河神府”。又听得那怪物坐在上面道：“一向辛苦，今日方能得物。这和尚乃十世修行的好人，但得吃他一块肉，便做长生不老人。我为他也等够多时，今朝却不负我志。”教：“小的们！快把铁笼抬出来，将这两个和尚囫囵蒸熟，具柬去请二舅爷来，与他暖寿。”沙僧闻言，按不住心头火起，掣宝杖，将门乱打，口中骂道：“那泼物，快送我唐僧师父与八戒师兄出来！”唬得那门内妖邪，急跑去报：“祸事了！”老怪问：“甚么祸事？”小妖道：“外面有一个晦气色脸的和尚，打着前门骂，要人哩！”那怪闻言，即唤取披挂。小妖抬出披挂，老妖结束整齐，手提一根竹节钢鞭，走出门来，真个是凶顽毒像。但见：方面圜睛霞彩亮，卷唇巨口血盆红。几根铁线稀髯摆，两鬓朱砂乱发蓬。形似显灵真太岁，貌如发怒狠雷公。身披铁甲团花灿，头戴金盔嵌宝浓。竹节钢鞭提手内，行时滚滚拽狂风。生来本是波中物，脱去原流变化凶。要问妖邪真姓字，前身唤做小鼍龙。那怪喝道：“是甚人在此打我门哩！”沙僧道：</p>

<p>“我把你个无知的泼怪！你怎么弄玄虚，变作梢公，架船将我师父摄来？快早送还，饶你性命！”那怪呵呵笑道：“这和尚不知死活！你师父是我拿了，如今要蒸熟了请人哩！你上来，与我见个雌雄！三合敌得我啊，还你师父；如三合敌不得，连你一发都蒸吃了，休想西天去也！”沙僧闻言大怒，轮宝杖，劈头就打。那怪举钢鞭，急架相迎。两个在水底下，这场好杀：降妖杖、竹节鞭，二人怒发各争先。一个是黑水河中千载怪，一个是灵霄殿外旧时仙。那个因贪三藏肉中吃，这个为保唐僧命可怜。都来水底相争斗，各要功成两不然。杀得虾鱼对对摇头躲，蟹鳖双双缩首潜。只听水府群妖齐擂鼓，门前众怪乱争喧。好个沙门真悟净，单身独力展威权！跃浪翻波无胜败，鞭迎杖架两牵连。</p>

<p>算来只为唐和尚，欲取真经拜佛天。他二人战经三十回合，不见高低。沙僧暗想道：“这怪物是我的对手，枉自不能取胜，且引他出去，教师兄打他。”这沙僧虚丢了个架子，拖着宝杖就走。那妖精更不赶来，道：“你去罢，我不与你斗了，我且具柬帖儿去请客哩。”</p>

<p>沙僧气呼呼跳出水来，见了行者道：“哥哥，这怪物无礼。”</p>

<p>行者问：“你下去许多时才出来，端的是甚妖邪？可曾寻见师父？”沙僧道：“他这里边，有一座亭台，台门外横书八个大字，唤做‘衡阳峪黑水河神府’。我闪在旁边，听着他在里面说话，教小的们刷洗铁笼，待要把师父与八戒蒸熟了，去请他舅爷来暖寿。是我发起怒来，就去打门。那怪物提一条竹节钢鞭走出来，与我斗了这半日，约有三十合，不分胜负。我却使个佯输法，要引他出来，着你助阵。那怪物乖得紧，他不来赶我，只要回去具柬请客，我才上来了。”行者道：“不知是个甚么妖邪？”</p>

<p>沙僧道：“那模样象一个大鳖；不然，便是个鼍龙也。”行者道：</p>

<p>“不知那个是他舅爷？”说不了，只见那下湾里走出一个老人，远远的跪下叫：“大圣，黑水河河神叩头。”行者道：“你莫是那棹船的妖邪，又来骗我么？”那老人磕头滴泪道：“大圣，我不是妖邪，我是这河内真神。那妖精旧年五月间，从西洋海趁大潮来于此处，就与小神交斗。奈我年迈身衰，敌他不过，把我坐的那衡阳峪黑水河神府，就占夺去住了，又伤了我许多水族。我却没奈何，径往海内告他。原来西海龙王是他的母舅，不准我的状子，教我让与他住。我欲启奏上天，奈何神微职小，不能得见玉帝。今闻得大圣到此，特来参拜投生，万望大圣与我出力报冤！”行者闻言道：“这等说，四海龙王都该有罪。他如今摄了我师父与师弟，扬言要蒸熟了，去请他舅爷暖寿，我正要拿他，幸得你来报信。这等啊，你陪着沙僧在此看守，等我去海中，先把那龙王捉来，教他擒此怪物。”河神道：“深感大圣大恩！”</p>

<p>行者即驾云，径至西洋大海，按筋斗，捻了避水诀，分开波浪。正然走处，撞见一个黑鱼精棒着一个浑金的请书匣儿，从下流头似箭如梭钻将上来，被行者扑个满面，掣铁棒分顶一下，可怜就打得脑浆迸出，腮骨查开，嗗都的一声飘出水面。他却揭开匣儿看处，里边有一张简帖，上写着：“愚甥鼍洁，顿首百拜，启上二舅爷敖老大人台下：向承佳惠，感感。今因获得二物，乃东土僧人，实为世间之罕物。甥不敢自用。因念舅爷圣诞在迩，特设菲筵，预祝千寿。万望车驾速临是荷！”行者笑道：</p>

<p>“这厮却把供状先递与老孙也！”正才袖了帖子，往前再行。早有一个探海的夜叉望见行者，急抽身撞上水晶宫报大王：“齐天大圣孙爷爷来了！”那龙王敖顺即领众水族出宫迎接道：“大圣，请入小宫少座，献茶。”行者道：“我还不曾吃你的茶，你倒先吃了我的酒也！”龙王笑道：“大圣一向皈依佛门，不动荤酒，却几时请我吃酒来？”行者道：“你便不曾去吃酒，只是惹下一个吃酒的罪名了。”敖顺大惊道：“小龙为何有罪？”行者袖中取出简帖儿，递与龙王。龙王见了，魂飞魄散，慌忙跪下叩头道：</p>

<p>“大圣恕罪！那厮是舍妹第九个儿子。因妹夫错行了风雨，刻减了雨数，被天曹降旨，着人曹官魏征丞相梦里斩了。舍妹无处安身，是小龙带他到此，恩养成人。前年不幸，舍妹疾故，惟他无方居住，我着他在黑水河养性修真，不期他作此恶孽，小龙即差人去擒他来也。”行者道：“你令妹共有几个贤郎？都在那里作怪？”龙王道：“舍妹有九个儿子。那八个都是好的。第一个小黄龙，见居淮渎；第二个小骊龙，见住济渎；第三个青背龙，占了江渎；第四个赤髯龙，镇守河渎；第五个徒劳龙，与佛祖司钟；第六个稳兽龙，与神官镇脊；第七个敬仲龙，与玉帝守擎天华表；第八个蜃龙，在大家兄处砥据太岳。此乃第九个鼍龙，因年幼无甚执事，自旧年才着他居黑水河养性，待成名，别迁调用，谁知他不遵吾旨，冲撞大圣也。”行者闻言笑道：“你妹妹有几个妹丈？”敖顺道：“只嫁得一个妹丈，乃泾河龙王。向年已此被斩，舍妹孀居于此，前年疾故了。”行者道：“一夫一妻，如何生这几个杂种？”敖顺道：“此正谓龙生九种，九种各别。”</p>

<p>行者道：“我才心中烦恼，欲将简帖为证，上奏天庭，问你个通同作怪，抢夺人口之罪。据你所言，是那厮不遵教诲，我且饶你这次：一则是看你昆玉分上，二来只该怪那厮年幼无知，你也不甚知情。你快差人擒来，救我师父！再作区处。”敖顺即唤太子摩昂：“快点五百虾鱼壮兵，将小鼍捉来问罪！”一壁厢安排酒席，与大圣陪礼。行者道：“龙王再勿多心，既讲开饶了你便罢，又何须办酒？我今须与你令郎同回：一则老师父遭愆，二则我师弟盼望。”那老龙苦留不住，又见龙女捧茶来献。行者立饮他一盏香茶，别了老龙，随与摩昂领兵，离了西海。早到黑水河中，行者道：“贤太子，好生捉怪，我上岸去也。”摩昂道：“大圣宽心，小龙子将他拿上来先见了大圣，惩治了他罪名，把师父送上来，才敢带回海内，见我家父。”行者欣然相别，捏了避水诀，跳出波津，径到了东边崖上。沙僧与那河神迎着道：“师兄，你去时从空而去，怎么回来却自河内而回？”行者把那打死鱼精，得简帖，见龙王，与太子同领兵来之事，备陈了一遍。沙僧十分欢喜。都立在岸边，候接师父不题。</p>

<p>却说那摩昂太子着介士先到他水府门前，报与妖怪道：</p>

<p>“西海老龙王太子摩昂来也。”那怪正坐，忽闻摩昂来，心中疑惑道：“我差黑鱼精投简帖拜请二舅爷，这早晚不见回话，怎么舅爷不来，却是表兄来耶？”正说间，只见那巡河的小怪又来报：“大王，河内有一枝兵，屯于水府之西，旗号上书着‘西海储君摩昂小帅’。”妖怪道：“这表兄却也狂妄：想是舅爷不得来，命他来赴宴，既是赴宴，如何又领兵劳士？咳！但恐其间有故。”</p>

<p>教：“小的们，将我的披挂钢鞭伺候，恐一时变暴，待我且出去迎他，看是何如。”众妖领命，一个个擦掌摩拳准备。</p>

<p>这鼍龙出得门来，真个见一枝海兵札营在右，只见：征旗飘绣带，画戟列明霞。宝剑凝光彩，长枪缨绕花。弓弯如月小，箭插似狼牙。大刀光灿灿，短棍硬沙沙。鲸鳌并蛤蚌，蟹鳖共鱼虾。大小齐齐摆，干戈似密麻。不是元戎令，谁敢乱爬喳！鼍怪见了，径至那营门前厉声高叫：“大表兄，小弟在此拱候，有请。”有一个巡营的螺螺急至中军帐：“报千岁殿下，外有鼍龙叫请哩。”太子按一按顶上金盔，束一束腰间宝带，手提一根三棱简，拽开步，跑出营去道：“你来请我怎么？”鼍龙进礼道：“小弟今早有简帖拜请舅爷，想是舅爷见弃，着表兄来的，兄长既来赴席，如何又劳师动众，不入水府，札营在此，又贯甲提兵，何也？”太子道：“你请舅爷做甚？”妖怪道：“小弟一向蒙恩赐居于此，久别尊颜，未得孝顺。昨日捉得一个东土僧人，我闻他是十世修行的元体，人吃了他，可以延寿，欲请舅爷看过，上铁笼蒸熟，与舅爷暖寿哩。”太子喝道：“你这厮十分懵懂！你道僧人是谁？”妖怪道：“他是唐朝来的僧人，往西天取经的和尚。”太子道：“你只知他是唐僧，不知他手下徒弟利害哩。”妖怪道：</p>

<p>“他有一个长嘴的和尚，唤做个猪八戒，我也把他捉住了，要与唐和尚一同蒸吃。还有一个徒弟，唤做沙和尚，乃是一条黑汉子，晦气色脸，使一根宝杖，昨日在这门外与我讨师父，被我帅出河兵，一顿钢鞭，战得他败阵逃生，也不见怎的利害。”太子道：“原来是你不知！他还有一个大徒弟，是五百年前大闹天宫上方太乙金仙齐天大圣，如今保护唐僧往西天拜佛求经，是普陀岩大慈大悲观音菩萨劝善，与他改名，唤做孙悟空行者。你怎么没得做，撞出这件祸来？他又在我海内遇着你的差人，夺了请帖，径入水晶宫，拿捏我父子们，有结连妖邪，抢夺人口之罪。你快把唐僧、八戒送上河边，交还了孙大圣，凭着我与他陪礼，你还好得性命，若有半个不字，休想得全生居于此也！”那怪鼍闻此言，心中大怒道：“我与你嫡亲的姑表，你倒反护他人？听你所言，就教把唐僧送出，天地间那里有这等容易事也！</p>

<p>你便怕他，莫成我也怕他？他若有手段，敢来我水府门前，与我交战三合，我才与他师父，若敌不过我，就连他也拿来，一齐蒸熟，也没甚么亲人，也不去请客，自家关了门，教小的们唱唱舞舞，我坐在上面，自自在在，吃他娘不是！”太子见说，开口骂道：“这泼邪果然无状！且不要教孙大圣与你对敌，你敢与我相持么？”那怪道：“要做好汉，怕甚么相持！”教：“取披挂！”呼唤一声，众小妖跟随左右，献上披挂，捧上钢鞭。他两个变了脸，各逞英雄；传号令，一齐擂鼓。这一场比与沙僧争斗，甚是不同，但见那：旌旗照耀，戈戟摇光。这壁厢营盘解散，那壁厢门户开张。摩昂太子提金简，鼍怪轮鞭急架偿。一声炮响河兵烈，三棒锣鸣海士狂。虾与虾争，蟹与蟹斗。鲸鳌吞赤鲤，鯾鲌起黄鱨。鲨鲻吃鮆鲭鱼走，牡蛎擒蛏蛤蚌慌，少扬刺硬如铁棍，鱑司针利似锋芒。鲆鱑追白蟮，鲈鲙捉乌鲳。一河水怪争高下，两处龙兵定弱强。混战多时波浪滚，摩昂太子赛金刚。喝声金简当头重，拿住妖鼍作怪王。这太子将三棱简闪了一个破绽，那妖精不知是诈，钻将进来，被他使个解数，把妖精右臂，只一简，打了个躘踵，赶上前，又一拍脚，跌倒在地。众海兵一拥上前，揪翻住，将绳子背绑了双手，将铁索穿了琵琶骨，拿上岸来，押至孙行者面前道：“大圣，小龙子捉住妖鼍，请大圣定夺。”</p>

<p>行者与沙僧见了道：“你这厮不遵旨令，你舅爷原着你在此居住，教你养性存身，待你名成之日，别有迁用。你怎么强占水神之宅，倚势行凶，欺心诳上，弄玄虚，骗我师父、师弟？我待要打你这一棒，奈何老孙这棒子甚重，略打打儿就了了性命。</p>

<p>你将我师父安在何处哩？”那怪叩头不住道：“大圣，小鼍不知大圣大名，却才逆了表兄，骋强背理，被表兄把我拿住。今见大圣，幸蒙大圣不杀之恩，感谢不尽。你师父还捆在那水府之间，望大圣解了我的铁索，放了我手，等我到河中送他出来。”摩昂在旁道：“大圣，这厮是个逆怪，他极奸诈，若放了他，恐生恶念。”沙和尚道：“我认得他那里，等我寻师父去。”他两个跳入水中，径至水府门前，那里门扇大开，更无一个小卒。直入亭台里面，见唐僧八戒，赤条条都捆在那里。沙僧即忙解了师父，河神亦随解了八戒，一家背着一个出水面，径至岸边。猪八戒见那妖精锁绑在侧，急掣钯上前就筑，口里骂道：“泼邪畜！你如今不吃我了？”行者扯住道：“兄弟，且饶他死罪罢，看敖顺贤父子之情。”摩昂进礼道：“大圣，小龙子不敢久停。既然救得你师父，我带这厮去见家父；虽大圣饶了他死罪，家父决不饶他活罪，定有发落处置，仍回复大圣谢罪。”行者道：“既如此，你领他去罢，多多拜上令尊，尚容面谢。”那太子押着那妖鼍，投水中，帅领海兵，径转西洋大海不题。</p>

<p>却说那黑水河神谢了行者道：“多蒙大圣复得水府之恩！”</p>

<p>唐僧道：“徒弟啊，如今还在东岸，如何渡此河也？”河神道：“老爷勿虑，且请上马，小神开路，引老爷过河。”那师父才骑了白马，八戒采着缰绳，沙和尚挑了行李，孙行者扶持左右，只见河神作起阻水的法术，将上流挡住。须臾下流撤干，开出一条大路。师徒们行过西边，谢了河神，登崖上路。这正是：禅僧有救来西域，彻地无波过黑河。毕竟不知怎生得拜佛求经，且听下回分解。</p>
