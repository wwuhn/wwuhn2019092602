<P>The master whipped on his horse and hurried straight to the temple gate with his disciple to have a look. They saw that it was indeed a monastery:</P>

<P>Coil a thousand wisps of red mist.</P>

<P>The two rows of pine and bamboo</P>

<P>The forest of locust and cypress trees</P>
<P>Has color and beauty.</P><br />

<P>See how high the drum and bell towers are,</P>
<P>How tall the pagoda.</P>
<P>In peaceful mediation the monks make firm their natures,</P>

<P>Sanzang dismounted, Monkey laid down his burden, and they were just on the point of going in when a crowd of monks came out. This is how they were dressed:</P>

<P>On their heads they wore hats pinned on the left,</P>
<P>On their bodies were clothes of purity.</P>
<P>Copper rings hung from their ears,</P>
<P>And silken belts were tied around their waists.</P>


<P>Slowly they walked on sandals of straw,</P>
<P>As they held wooden clappers in their hands.</P>
<P>With their mouths they were always chanting</P>
<P>Their devotion to the Wisdom.</P>

<P>When Sanzang saw them he stood respectfully beside the gate and greeted them. A monk hastily returned his greeting and apologized for not noticing them before.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you from?&#8221; he asked, &#8220;please come to the abbot's rooms and have some tea.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have been sent from the East on an imperial mission to worship the Buddha in the Thunder Monastery and ask for the scriptures,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;and as it is almost night we would like to ask for a night's lodging now that we are here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Come inside and sit down, come inside and sit down,&#8221; the monk said. When Sanzang told Monkey to lead the horse over, the monk was frightened at the sudden sight of him and asked, &#8220;What's that thing leading the horse?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Keep your voice down,&#8221; Sanzang urged, &#8220;keep your voice down. He has a quick temper, and if he hears you referring to him as 'that thing,' he'll be furious. He's my disciple.&#8221;</P></div>

<div class="right">
<p>三藏见了，侍立门旁，道个问讯，那和尚连忙答礼，笑道失瞻，问：“是那里来的？请入方丈献茶。”三藏道：“我弟子乃东土钦差，上雷音寺拜佛求经。至此处天色将晚，欲借上刹一宵。”那和尚道：“请进里坐，请进里坐。”三藏方唤行者牵马进来。那和尚忽见行者相貌，有些害怕，便问：“那牵马的是个甚么东西？”三藏道：“悄言！悄言！他的性急，若听见你说是甚么东西，他就恼了。他是我的徒弟。”</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<P>The monk shuddered and bit his finger as he remarked, &#8220;Fancy taking a monstrously ugly creature like that for a disciple.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He may not look it,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;but ugly as he is, he has his uses.&#8221;</P>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>那和尚打了个寒噤，咬着指头道：“这般一个丑头怪脑的，好招他做徒弟？”三藏道：“你看不出来哩，丑自丑，甚是有用。”</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<P>The monk had no choice but to go through the monastery gate with Sanzang and Monkey, and inside they saw the words CHAN MONASTERY OF GUANYIN written in large letters on the main hall. Sanzang was delighted.</P>
<P>&#8220;I have often been the grateful beneficiary of the Bodhisattva's divine mercy,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;but I have not yet been able to kowtow to her in thanks. To worship her in this monastery will be just as good as seeing her in person.&#8221; On hearing this, the monk, ordering a lay brother to open the doors, invited Sanzang to go in and worship. Monkey tethered the horse, put the luggage down, and went up into the hall with Sanzang, who prostrated himself and put his head on the floor before the golden statue. When the monk went to beat the drum, Monkey started striking the bell. Sanzang lay before the image, praying with all his heart, and when he had finished the monk stopped beating the drum. Monkey, however, was so engrossed in striking the bell, sometimes fast and sometimes slow, that he went on for a very long time.</P>
<P>&#8220;He's finished his devotions,&#8221; a lay brother said, &#8220;so what are you still beating the bell for?&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey threw down the bell hammer and said with a grin, &#8220;You're ignorant, aren't you? 'Whoever is a monk for a day strikes the bell for a day': that's me.&#8221; By then all the monks in the monastery, senior and junior, as well as the abbot and his assistant, had been so startled by the wild noises from the bell that they all came crowding out to ask what savage was making such a din with the bell and drum. Monkey jumped out and cursed them:
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>那和尚只得同三藏与行者进了山门。山门里。又见那正殿上书四个大字，是观音禅院。三藏又大喜道：“弟子屡感菩萨圣恩，未及叩谢。今遇禅院，就如见菩萨一般，甚好拜谢。”那和尚闻言，即命道人开了殿门，请三藏朝拜。那行者拴了马，丢了行李，同三藏上殿。三藏展背舒身，铺胸纳地，望金象叩头。那和尚便去打鼓，行者就去撞钟。三藏俯伏台前，倾心祷祝。祝拜已毕，那和尚住了鼓，行者还只管撞钟不歇，或紧或慢，撞了许久，那道人道：“拜已毕了，还撞钟怎么？”行者方丢了钟杵，笑道：“你那里晓得，我这是做一日和尚撞一日钟的。”此时却惊动那寺里大小僧人、上下房长老，听得钟声乱响，一齐拥出道：“那个野人在这里乱敲钟鼓？”行者跳将出来，咄的一声道：</p>

<div class="layout">

<p> &#8220;Your grandfather Sun Wukong was having some fun.&#8221;</P>
<P>All the monks collapsed with shock at the sight of him and said as they knelt on the ground, &#8220;Lord Thunder God, Lord Thunder God.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The Thunder God is my great grandson,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Get up, get up, you've nothing to fear. I'm a lord from the land of the Great Tang empire in the East.&#8221; The monks all bowed to him, and could not feel easy until Sanzang appeared.</P>
<P>&#8220;Please come and drink tea in my rooms,&#8221; said the abbot of the monastery. The horse was unloaded and led off, while they went round the main hall to a room at the back where they sat down according to their seniority.</P></div>

<div class="right">
<p>“是你孙外公撞了耍子的！”那些和尚一见了，唬得跌跌滚滚，都爬在地下道：“雷公爷爷！”行者道：“雷公是我的重孙儿哩！起来起来，不要怕，我们是东土大唐来的老爷。”众僧方才礼拜，见了三藏，都才放心不怕。内有本寺院主请道：“老爷们到后方丈中奉茶。”遂而解缰牵马，抬了行李，转过正殿，径入后房，序了坐次。</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<P>The abbot gave them tea and arranged for food to be brought, and after the meal it was still early. As Sanzang was expressing his thanks, two servant boys appeared behind them supporting an aged monk. This is what he looked like:</P>

<div class="right">
<p>那院主献了茶，又安排斋供。天光尚早，三藏称谢未毕，只见那后面有两个小童，搀着一个老僧出来。看他怎生打扮：</p>

<P>&#8220;The Patriarch has come,&#8221; the monks all said. Sanzang bowed low to him in greeting and said, &#8220;Your disciple pays his respects, venerable abbot.&#8221; The aged monk returned his greeting and they both sat down.</P>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>众僧道：“师祖来了。”三藏躬身施礼迎接道：“老院主，弟子拜揖。”那老僧还了礼，又各叙坐。</p>

<P>&#8220;Please forgive us for blundering into your monastery so rudely,&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't put it like that,&#8221; the aged monk said, going on to ask, &#8220;How long a journey is it from the Eastern lands to here?&#8221;</P>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>三藏道：“轻造宝山，不知好歹，恕罪恕罪！”老僧道：“不敢不敢！”因问：</p>

<P>&#8220;It was over sixteen hundred miles from Chang'an to the Double Boundary Mountain, where I took on this disciple,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;We traveled on together through the land of Kami, and as that took two months we must have covered getting on for another two thousand miles before reaching here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Over three thousand miles,&#8221; said the aged monk. &#8220;I have spent a life of piety and have never been outside the monastery gates, so you could really say that I have been 'looking at heaven from the bottom of a well,' and call mine a wasted life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How great is your age, venerable abbot?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;In my stupid way I have lived to be two hundred and seventy,&#8221; the old monk replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Then you're my ten-thousandth-great grandson,&#8221; put in Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Talk properly,&#8221; said Sanzang, glaring at him, &#8220;Don't be so disrespectful and rude.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How old are you, sir?&#8221; the aged monk asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I don't venture to mention it,&#8221; Monkey replied. The aged monk then thought that he must have been raving, so he put the matter out of his mind, said no more about it, and ordered tea to be brought for them. A young page brought in three<I> cloisonne</I> teacups on a jade tray the color of mutton fat, and another carried in a white alloy teapot from which he poured out three cups of fragrant tea. It had a better color than pomegranate blossom, and its aroma was finer than cassia. When Sanzang saw all this he was full of praise.</P>
<P>&#8220;What splendid things,&#8221; he said, &#8220;what splendid things. Wonderful tea in wonderful vessels.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They're not worth looking at,&#8221; the old monk replied. &#8220;After all, sir, you come from a superior and heavenly court, and have seen many rare things in your wide travels; so how can you give such exaggerated praise to things like that? What treasures did you bring with you from your superior country that I could have a look at?&#8221;</P>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>“老爷，东土到此，有多少路程？”三藏道：“出长安边界，有五千余里；过两界山，收了一个小徒，一路来，行过西番哈咇国，经两个月，又有五六千里，才到了贵处。”老僧道：“也有万里之遥了。我弟子虚度一生，山门也不曾出去，诚所谓坐井观天，樗朽之辈。”三藏又问：“老院主高寿几何？”老僧道：“痴长二百七十岁了。”行者听见道：“这还是我万代孙儿哩？”三藏瞅了他一眼道：“谨言！莫要不识高低冲撞人。”那和尚便问：老爷，你有多少年纪了？”行者道；“不敢说。”那老僧也只当一句疯话，便不介意，也不再回，只叫献茶。有一个小幸童，拿出一个羊脂玉的盘儿，有三个法蓝镶金的茶锺；又一童，提一把白铜壶儿，斟了三杯香茶。真个是色欺榴蕊艳，味胜桂花香。三藏见了，夸爱不尽道：“好物件！好物件！真是美食美器！”那老僧道：“污眼污眼！老爷乃天朝上国，广览奇珍，似这般器具，何足过奖？老爷自上邦来，可有甚么宝贝，借与弟子一观？”</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<P>&#8220;I'm afraid our Eastern land has no great treasures, and even if it did, I would have been unable to bring them on so long a journey.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; put in Monkey, who was sitting beside him, &#8220;isn't that cassock I saw in our bundle the other day a treasure? Why don't I take it out for him to see?&#8221; When the monks heard him mention the cassock, they smiled sinister smiles.</P>
<P>&#8220;What are you smiling at?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;We thought it was very funny when you said that a cassock was a treasure,&#8221; the abbot of the monastery replied. &#8220;A priest of my rank has two or three dozen, and our Patriarch, who has been a monk here for two hundred and fifty or sixty years, has seven or eight hundred.&#8221; He ordered them to be brought out and displayed. The old monk, who was also in on the game, told the lay brothers to open the store-rooms, while friars carried twelve chests out into the courtyard, and unlocked them. Then they set up clothes frames, put rope all around, shook the cassocks open one by one, and hung them up for Sanzang to see. Indeed, the whole building was full of brocade, and the four walls covered with silk.</P>
<P>Monkey examined them one by one and saw that some were made of brocade and some were embroidered with gold.</P>
<P>&#8220;Enough, enough, enough,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Put them away, put them away. I'll bring ours out for you to take a look at.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang drew Monkey aside and whispered to him, &#8220;Disciple, never try to compete with other people's wealth, you and I are alone in this foreign land, and I'm afraid that there may be trouble.&#8221;</P>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>三藏道：“可怜！我那东土，无甚宝贝，就有时，路程遥远，也不能带得。”行者在旁道：“师父，我前日在包袱里，曾见那领袈裟，不是件宝贝？拿与他看看如何？”众僧听说袈裟，一个个冷笑。行者道：“你笑怎的？”院主道：“老爷才说袈裟是件宝贝，言实可笑。若说袈裟，似我等辈者，不止二三十件；若论我师祖，在此处做了二百五六十年和尚，足有七八百件！”叫：“拿出来看看。”那老和尚，也是他一时卖弄，便叫道人开库房，头陀抬柜子，就抬出十二柜，放在天井中，开了锁，两边设下衣架，四围牵了绳子，将袈裟一件件抖开挂起，请三藏观看。果然是满堂绮绣，四壁绫罗！行者一一观之，都是些穿花纳锦，刺绣销金之物，笑道：“好，好，好，收起收起！把我们的也取出来看看。”三藏把行者扯住，悄悄的道：“徒弟，莫要与人斗富。你我是单身在外，只恐有错。”</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<P>&#8220;What trouble can come from letting him look at the cassock?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't understand,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;The ancients used to say, 'Don't let greedy and treacherous men see rare or amusing things.' If he lays his eyes on it, his mind will be disturbed, and if his mind is disturbed, he's bound to start scheming. If you were cautious, you would only have let him see it if he'd insisted; but as it is, this is no trifling matter, and may well be the end of us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry, don't worry,&#8221; said Brother Monkey, &#8220;I'll look after everything.&#8221; Watch as without another word of argument he rushes off and opens the bundle, which is already giving off a radiant glow. It still had two layers of oiled paper round it, and when he removed it to take out the cassock and shake it open the hall was bathed in red light and clouds of coloured vapours filled the courtyard. When the monks saw it their hearts were filled with delight and their mouths with praise. It really was a fine cassock.</P>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>行者道：“看看袈裟，有何差错？”三藏道：“你不曾理会得，古人有云，珍奇玩好之物，不可使见贪婪奸伪之人。倘若一经入目，必动其心；既动其心，必生其计。汝是个畏祸的，索之而必应其求可也；不然，则殒身灭命，皆起于此，事不小矣。”行者道：“放心放心！都在老孙身上！”你看他不由分说，急急的走了去，把个包袱解开，早有霞光迸迸，尚有两层油纸裹定，去了纸，取出袈裟！抖开时，红光满室，彩气盈庭。众僧见了，无一个不心欢口赞。真个好袈裟！上头有：</p>

<P>When the aged monk saw how rare a treasure it was, his heart was indeed disturbed. He went up to Sanzang and knelt before him. &#8220;My fate is indeed a wretched one,&#8221; he lamented, tears pouring down his cheeks. Sanzang helped him to his feet again and asked, &#8220;Why do you say that, venerable patriarch?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You have unfolded this treasure of yours, sir,&#8221; the aged monk replied, &#8220;when it is already evening, so that my eyes are too dim to see it clearly. That is why I say my fate is wretched.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Send for a candle and take another look,&#8221; Sanzang suggested.</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord, your precious cassock is already shining brightly, so I don't think I would see more distinctly even if a candle were lit,&#8221; replied the aged monk.</P>
<P>&#8220;How would you like to look at it then?&#8221; asked Sanzang.</P>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>那老和尚见了这般宝贝，果然动了奸心，走上前对三藏跪下，眼中垂泪道：“我弟子真是没缘！”三藏搀起道：“老院师有何话说？”他道：“老爷这件宝贝，方才展开，天色晚了，奈何眼目昏花，不能看得明白，岂不是无缘！”三藏教：“掌上灯来，让你再看。”那老僧道：“爷爷的宝贝，已是光亮，再点了灯，一发晃眼，莫想看得仔细。”行者道：“你要怎的看才好？”</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<P>&#8220;If, sir, you were in your mercy to set aside your fears and let me take it to my room to examine it closely during the night, I will return it to you in the morning to take to the West. What do you say to that?&#8221; This request startled Sanzang, who grumbled at Brother Monkey, &#8220;It's all your fault, all your fault.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He's nothing to be frightened of.&#8221; Monkey replied with a grin. &#8220;I'll pack it up and tell him to take it away to look at. If anything goes wrong, I'll be responsible.&#8221;</P>
<P>As there was nothing he could do to stop him, Sanzang handed the cassock to the old monk with the words, &#8220;I'll let you take it, but you must give it back to me tomorrow morning in the condition it's in now. I won't have you getting it at all dirty.&#8221;</P>
<P>The old monk gleefully told a page to take the cassock to his room, and instructed the other monks to sweep out the front meditation hall, move two rattan beds in, spread out the bedding on them, and invite the two gentlemen to spend the night there; he also arranged for them to be given breakfast and seen off the next morning. Then everyone went off to bed. Sanzang and his disciple shut the doors of the meditation hall and went to sleep.</P>

<p>老僧道：“老爷若是宽恩放心，教弟子拿到后房，细细的看一夜，明早送还老爷西去，不知尊意何如？”三藏听说，吃了一惊，埋怨行者道：“都是你！都是你！”行者笑道：“怕他怎的？等我包起来，教他拿了去看。但有疏虞，尽是老孙管整。”那三藏阻当不住，他把袈裟递与老僧道：“凭你看去，只是明早照旧还我，不得损污些须。”老僧喜喜欢欢，着幸童将袈裟拿进去，却吩咐众僧，将前面禅堂扫净，取两张藤床，安设铺盖，请二位老爷安歇；一壁厢又教安排明早斋送行，遂而各散。师徒们关了禅堂，睡下不题。</p>

<P>After the old monk had tricked them into giving him the cassock, he held it under the lamp in the back room as he wept and wailed over it. This so alarmed the monks that none of them dared go to sleep before he did. The young page, not knowing what to do, went to tell the other monks, &#8220;Grandad's still crying although it's getting on for eleven.&#8221; Two junior monks, who were among the old man's favorites, went over to ask him why he was crying.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm crying because my accursed fate won't allow me to see the Tang Priest's treasure,&#8221; he said; to which they replied, &#8220;Grandad, in your old age you have succeeded. His cassock is laid before you, and all you have to do is open your eyes and look. There's no need for tears.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But I can't look at it for long,&#8221; the aged monk answered. &#8220;I'm two hundred and seventy this year, and I've collected all those hundreds of cassocks for nothing. However am I to get hold of that one of his? However am I to become like the Tang priest?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master, you've got it all wrong,&#8221; the junior monks said. &#8220;The Tang Priest is a pilgrim far from home. You should be satisfied with your great seniority and wealth; why ever would you want to be a pilgrim like him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Although I live at home and enjoy my declining years, I've got no cassock like his to wear,&#8221; the aged monk replied. &#8220;If I could wear it for a day, I would close my eyes in peace. I'd be as happy as if I were a monk in my next life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What nonsense,&#8221; the junior monks said. &#8220;If you want to wear his cassock, there'll be no problem about that. We'll keep him for another day tomorrow, and you can wear it for another day. Or we can keep him for ten days and you can wear it for ten days. So why get so upset about it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Even if we kept him for a year,&#8221; the old monk replied, &#8220;I'd only be able to wear it for a year, which wouldn't bring me any glory. I'll still have to give it to him when he went: I can't keep him here for ever.&#8221;</P>

<p>却说那和尚把袈裟骗到手，拿在后房灯下，对袈裟号啕痛哭，慌得那本寺僧，不敢先睡。小幸童也不知为何，却去报与众僧道：“公公哭到二更时候，还不歇声。”有两个徒孙，是他心爱之人，上前问道：“师公，你哭怎的？”老僧道：“我哭无缘，看不得唐僧宝贝！”小和尚道：“公公年纪高大，发过了他的袈裟，放在你面前，你只消解开看便罢了，何须痛哭？”老僧道：“看的不长久。我今年二百七十岁，空挣了几百件袈裟，怎么得有他这一件？怎么得做个唐僧？”小和尚道：“师公差了。唐僧乃是离乡背井的一个行脚僧。你这等年高，享用也彀了，倒要象他做行脚僧，何也？”老僧道：“我虽是坐家自在，乐乎晚景，却不得他这袈裟穿穿。若教我穿得一日儿，就死也闭眼，也是我来阳世间为僧一场！”众僧道：“好没正经！你要穿他的，有何难处？</p><p>我们明日留他住一日，你就穿他一日，留他住十日，你就穿他十日便罢了。何苦这般痛哭？”老僧道：“纵然留他住了半载，也只穿得半载，到底也不得气长。他要去时只得与他去，怎生留得长远？”</p>

<P>As they were talking a young monk called Broad Wisdom spoke out. &#8220;Grandad,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if you want it for a long time, that's easy to arrange too.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What brilliant idea have you got, child?&#8221; the aged monk asked, cheering up.</P>
<P>&#8220;That Tang Priest and his disciple were so exhausted after their journey that they are both asleep by now,&#8221; Broad Wisdom replied. If we arm some strong monks with swords and spears to break into the meditation hall and kill them, they can be buried in the back garden, and nobody but us will be any the wiser. This way we get their white horse and their luggage as well as the cassock, which will become an heirloom of the monastery. We would be doing this for posterity.&#8221; The old monk was very pleased with this suggestion, and he wiped the tears from his eyes as he said, &#8220;Very good, very good, a marvellous plan.&#8221;</P>
<P>Another young monk called Broad Plans, a fellow-student of Broad Wisdom's, came froward and said, &#8220;This plan's no good. If we are to kill them, we'll have to keep a sharp eye on them. That old pale-faced one looks easy enough, but the hairy-faced one could be tricky; and if by any chance we fail to kill him, we'll be in deep trouble. I have a way that doesn't involve using weapons, but I don't know what you'll think of it.&#8221;</P>
</div>



<div class="right">
<p>正说话处，有一个小和尚名唤广智，出头道：“公公，要得长远也容易。”老僧闻言，就欢喜起来道：“我儿，你有甚么高见？”广智道：“那唐僧两个是走路的人，辛苦之甚，如今已睡着了。我们想几个有力量的，拿了枪刀，打开禅堂，将他杀了，把尸首埋在后园，只我一家知道，却又谋了他的白马、行囊，却把那袈裟留下，以为传家之宝，岂非子孙长久之计耶？”老和尚见说，满心欢喜，却才揩了眼泪道：“好！好！好！此计绝妙！”即便收拾枪刀。内中又有一个小和尚，名唤广谋，就是那广智的师弟，上前来道：“此计不妙。若要杀他，须要看看动静。那个白脸的似易，那个毛脸的似难。万一杀他不得，却不反招己祸？</p>

<P>&#8220;What do you suggest, my child?&#8221; the aged monk asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;In my humble opinion,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;we should assemble the head monks of all the cells, senior and junior, and get everyone to put a bundle of firewood outside the meditation hall. When it's set alight, those two will have no escape, and will be burnt to death together with their horse. Even if the people who live around this mountain see the blaze, they'll think that those two burnt down the mediation hall by carelessly starting a fire. This way they'll both be burnt to death and nobody will know how it happened. Then the cassock will become our monastery's treasure for ever.&#8221; All the monks present were pleased with this suggestion, exclaiming, &#8220;Great, great, great; an even better plan.&#8221; The head of every cell was told to bring firewood, a scheme that was to bring death to the venerable and aged monk, and reduce the Guanyin Monastery to ashes. Now there were seventy or eighty cells in the monastery, and over two hundred junior and senior monks. They shifted firewood all night, piled it up all round the meditation hall so that there was no way out, and prepared to set it alight.</P>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>我有一个不动刀枪之法，不知你尊意如何？”老僧道：“我儿，你有何法？”广谋道：“依小孙之见，如今唤聚东山大小房头，每人要干柴一束，舍了那三间禅堂，放起火来，教他欲走无门，连马一火焚之。就是山前山后人家看见，只说是他自不小心，走了火，将我禅堂都烧了。那两个和尚，却不都烧死？又好掩人耳目。袈裟岂不是我们传家之宝？”那些和尚闻言，无不欢喜，都道：“强！强！强！此计更妙！更妙！”遂教各房头搬柴来。唉！</p>

<p>这一计，正是弄得个高寿老僧该尽命，观音禅院化为尘！原来他那寺里，有七八十个房头，大小有二百余众。当夜一拥搬柴，把个禅堂前前后后四面围绕不通，安排放火不题。</p>

<P>Although Sanzang and he had gone to bed, the magical Monkey's spirit remained alert and his eyes half open even when he was asleep. His suspicions were aroused by the sound of people moving around outside and the rustling of firewood in the breeze. &#8220;Why can I hear footsteps in the still of the night?&#8221; he wondered. &#8220;Perhaps bandits are planning to murder us.&#8221; He leaped out of bed, and was on the point of opening the door to take a look when he remembered that this might disturb his master, so instead he used his miraculous powers to turn himself into a bee with a shake of his body.</P>

<P>He saw that the monks had piled firewood and straw all around the meditation hall and were setting it alight. Smiling to himself he thought, &#8220;So my master was right. This is their idea. They want to kill us and keep our cassock. I wish I could lay into them with my cudgel. If only I wasn't forbidden to use it, I could kill the lot of them; but the master would only be angry with me for murdering them. Too bad. I'll just have to take my chances as they come, and finish them off.&#8221;</P>

<P>The splendid Monkey leapt in through the Southern Gate of Heaven with a single somersault, startling the heavenly warriors Pang, Liu, Gou and Bi into bowing, and Ma, Zhao, Wen and Guan into bending low as they all said, &#8220;Oh no, oh no! The fellow who turned Heaven upside down is here again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no need to stand on courtesy or be alarmed, gentlemen,&#8221; said Monkey with a wave of his hand, &#8220;I've come to find the Broad-Visioned Heavenly King.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before the words were out of his mouth the Heavenly King was there and greeting Monkey with, &#8220;Haven't seen you for ages. I heard the other day that the Bodhisattva Guanyin came to see the Jade Emperor to borrow the four Duty Gods, the Six Dings and Jias and the Revealers of the Truth to look after the Tang Priest on his pilgrimage to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures. They were also saying that you were his disciple, so how is it that you have the spare time to come here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Let's cut the cackle,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;The Tang priest has run into some villains who have started a fire to burn him to death. It's very urgent, which is why I've come to ask you for the loan of your Anti-fire Cover to save him with. Fetch it at once; I'll bring it straight back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've got it all wrong,&#8221; the Heavenly King replied. &#8220;If villains are trying to burn him, you should rescue him with water. What do you need my Anti-fire Cover for?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't understand,&#8221; Monkey continued. &#8220;If I try to save him with water, he may still be hurt even if he isn't burnt up. I can only keep him free from injury if you lend me that cover; and with that it doesn't matter how much burning they do. Buck up, buck up! It may be too late already. Don't mess up what I've got to do down there.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You monkey,&#8221; said the Heavenly King with a laugh, &#8220;You're as wicked as ever, thinking only of yourself and never of others.&#8221;</P>

As he watched them starting the fire he kept on reciting a spell and blew some magic breath towards the Southwest, at which a wind arose and fanned the flames up into a wild and roaring blaze. What a fire!</P>

<P>When the fire broke out, all the animals and devils of the mountain were disturbed. Seven miles due South of the Guanyin Monastery was the Black Wind Mountain, on which there was a Black Wind Cave. In this cave a monster awoke and sat up. Seeing light streaming in through his window, he thought it must be dawn, but when he got up to take a better look he saw a fire blazing to the North.</P>
<P>&#8220;Blimey,&#8221; the monster exclaimed with astonishment, &#8220;those careless monks must have set the Guanyin Monastery on fire. I'd better go and help them.&#8221; The good monster leapt off on a cloud and went down below the smoke and flames that reached up to the sky. The front halls were all empty, and the fire was burning bright in the cloisters on either side. He rushed forward with long strides and was just calling for water when he noticed that the rooms at the back were not burning as there was someone on the roof keeping the wind away. The moment he realized this and rushed in to look, he saw a magic glow and propitious vapours coming from a black felt bundle on the table. On opening it he found it contained a brocade cassock that was a rare treasure of the Buddhist religion. His mind disturbed by the sight of this valuable object, he forgot about putting out the fire or calling for water and grabbed the cassock, which he made off with in the general confusion. Then he went straight back to his cave by cloud.</P>

<P>&#8220;I'm not such a rascal as to do a thing like that,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Honestly and truly, they started it. Of course, when I saw how vicious they were I didn't help put the blaze out. I helped them with a slight breeze instead.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Heavens! Heavens! When a fire starts you should bring water, not wind.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You must know the old saying&#8212;'If people didn't harm tigers, tigers wouldn't hurt people.' If they hadn't started a fire, I wouldn't have caused a wind.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where's the cassock? Don't say that it's been burnt too.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's all right; it hasn't been burnt. The abbots' cell where it was kept didn't catch fire.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I don't care what you say. If it's come to any harm, I'll recite that spell till it kills you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't do that,&#8221; pleaded Monkey desperately, &#8220;I promise to bring that cassock back to you. Wait while I fetch it for you, and then we'll be on our way.&#8221; With Sanzang leading the horse, and Monkey carrying the luggage, they went out of the meditation hall and straight to the abbot's lodgings at the back.</P>

<p>三藏才醒觉，翻身道：“正是。”穿了衣服，开门出来，忽抬头只见些倒壁红墙，不见了楼台殿宇，大惊道：“呀！怎么这殿宇俱无？都是红墙，何也？”行者道：“你还做梦哩！今夜走了火的。”三藏道：“我怎不知？”行者道：“是老孙护了禅堂，见师父浓睡，不曾惊动。”三藏道：“你有本事护了禅堂，如何就不救别房之火？”行者笑道：“好教师父得知。果然依你昨日之言，他爱上我们的袈裟，算计要烧杀我们。若不是老孙知觉，到如今皆成灰骨矣！”三藏闻言，害怕道：“是他们放的火么？”行者道：“不是他是谁？”三藏道：“莫不是怠慢了你，你干的这个勾当？”行者道：“老孙是这等惫懒之人，干这等不良之事？实实是他家放的。老孙见他心毒，果是不曾与他救火，只是与他略略助些风的。”三藏道：“天那！天那！火起时，只该助水，怎转助风？”行者道：“你可知古人云，人没伤虎心，虎没伤人意。他不弄火，我怎肯弄风？”三藏道：“袈裟何在？敢莫是烧坏了也？”行者道：“没事！没事！烧不坏！那放袈裟的方丈无火。”三藏恨道：“我不管你！但是有些儿伤损，我只把那话儿念动念动，你就是死了！”行者慌了道：“师父，莫念！莫念！管寻还你袈裟就是了。等我去拿来走路。”三藏才牵着马，行者挑了担，出了禅堂，径往后方丈去。</p>

<P>When the grief-stricken monks of the monastery suddenly saw master and disciple emerge with horse and luggage from the meditation hall they were terrified out of their wits, and screamed, &#8220;Their avenging ghosts have come to demand our lives.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean, avenging ghosts coming to demand your lives?&#8221; Monkey shouted. &#8220;Give us back our cassock at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>The monks all fell to their knees and kowtowed, saying, &#8220;Masters, wrongs are always avenged, and debts always have to be paid. If you want lives, it's nothing to do with us; It was the old monk and Broad Plans who cooked up the plot to kill you. Please don't punish us.&#8221;</P>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>却说那些和尚，正悲切间，忽的看见他师徒牵马挑担而来，唬得一个个魂飞魄散道：“冤魂索命来了！”行者喝道：“甚么冤魂索命？快还我袈裟来！”众僧一齐跪倒叩头道：“爷爷呀！冤有冤家，债有债主。要索命不干我们事，都是广谋与老和尚定计害你的，莫问我们讨命。”</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<P>Monkey snorted with anger and roared, &#8220;I'll get you, you damned animals. Who asked for anyone's life? Just bring out that cassock and we'll be on our way.&#8221;</P>
<P>Two brave men from among the monks said, &#8220;Masters, you were burnt to death in the meditation hall, and now you come back to ask for the cassock. Are you men or ghosts?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You cattle,&#8221; sneered Monkey, &#8220;there wasn't any fire. Go and look at the meditation hall and then we'll see what you have to say.&#8221; The monks rose to their feet, and when they went forward to look, they saw that there was not even the slightest trace of scorching on the door and the window-frames. The monks, now struck with fear, realized that Sanzang was a divine priest, and Monkey a guardian god.</P>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>行者咄的一声道：“我把你这些该死的畜生！那个问你讨甚么命！只拿袈裟来还我走路！”其间有两个胆量大的和尚道：“老爷，你们在禅堂里已烧死了，如今又来讨袈裟，端的还是人是鬼？”行者笑道：“这伙孽畜！那里有甚么火来？你去前面看看禅堂，再来说话！”众僧们爬起来往前观看，那禅堂外面的门窗槅扇，更不曾燎灼了半分。众人悚惧，才认得三藏是位神僧，行者是尊护法，一齐上前叩头道：</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<P>They all kowtowed to the pair of them and said, &#8220;Our eyes are blind. We failed to recognize saints sent down from Heaven. Your cassock is in the abbot's rooms at the back.&#8221; Sanzang went past a number of ruined walls and buildings, sighing endlessly, and saw that the abbot's rooms at the back had indeed not been burnt. The monks all rushed in shouting. &#8220;Grandad, the Tang priest is a saint, and instead of being burnt to death he's wrecked our home. Bring the cassock out at once and give it back to him.&#8221;</P>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>“我等有眼无珠，不识真人下界！你的袈裟在后面方丈中老师祖处哩。”三藏行过了三五层败壁破墙，嗟叹不已。只见方丈果然无火，众僧抢入里面，叫道：“公公！唐僧乃是神人，未曾烧死，如今反害了自己家当！趁早拿出袈裟，还他去也。”</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layout">

<P>Now the old monk had been unable to find the cassock, which coming on top of the destruction of the monastery had him distraught with worry. When the monks asked him for it, he was unable to reply. Seeing no way out of his quandary, he bent his head down and dashed it against the wall. He smashed his skull open and expired as his blood poured all over the floor. There are some verses about it:</P>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>原来这老和尚寻不见袈裟，又烧了本寺的房屋，正在万分烦恼焦燥之处，一闻此言，怎敢答应？因寻思无计，进退无方，拽开步，躬着腰，往那墙上着实撞了一头，可怜只撞得脑破血流魂魄散，咽喉气断染红沙！有诗为证，诗曰：</p>

<P>Alas that the aged monk in his folly</P>
<P>Lived so long a life for nothing.</P>
<P>He wanted the cassock as an heirloom for the monastery.</P>
<P>Forgetting that what is Buddha's is not as mortal things.</P>
<P>As he took the changeable for the eternal,</P>
<P>His sorry end was quite inevitable.</P>
<P>What use were Broad Wisdom and Broad Plans?</P>
<P>To harm others for gain always fails.</P>

<P>The other monks began to howl in desperation, &#8220;Our Patriarch has dashed his brains out, and we can't find the cassock, so whatever shall we do?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I think you've hidden it somewhere,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;Come out, all of you, and bring me all the registers. I'm going to check that you're all here.&#8221; The senior and junior abbots brought the two registers in which all the monks, novices, pages, and servants were registered. There were a total of two hundred and thirty names in them. Asking his master to sit in the place of honour, Monkey called out and marked off each of the names, making the monks open up their clothes for his inspection. When he had checked each one carefully there was no sign of the cassock. Then he searched carefully through all the boxes and baskets that had been saved from the flames, but again he could find no trace of it. </P>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>慌得个众僧哭道：“师公已撞杀了，又不见袈裟，怎生是好？”行者道：“想是汝等盗藏起也！都出来！开具花名手本，等老孙逐一查点！”那上下房的院主，将本寺和尚、头陀、幸童、道人尽行开具手本二张，大小人等，共计二百三十名。行者请师父高坐，他却一一从头唱名搜检，都要解放衣襟，分明点过，更无袈裟。又将那各房头搬抢出去的箱笼物件，从头细细寻遍，那里得有踪迹。</p>
</div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<P>Sanzang, now absolutely furious with Brother Monkey, started to recite the spell as he sat up high.Monkey fell to the ground in great agony, clutching his head and pleading, &#8220;Stop, stop, I swear to return the cassock to you.&#8221; The monks, trembling at the sight, begged him to stop, and only then did he shut his mouth and desist.</P>
<P>Monkey leapt to his feet, took his iron cudgel from behind his ear, and was going to hit the monks when Sanzang shouted, &#8220;You ape, aren't you afraid of another headache? Are you going to misbehave again? Don't move your hand or hurt anyone. I want you to question them again instead.&#8221;</P>
<P>The monks all kowtowed to him and entreated him most pitifully to spare their lives. &#8220;We've honestly not seen it. It's all that dead old bastard's fault. After he saw your cassock yesterday evening he cried till late into the night, not even wanting to look at it as he worked out a plan by which it could belong to the monastery for ever. He wanted to burn you to death, masters, but when the fire started, a gale wind blew up, and we were all busy trying to put the blaze out and move away what stuff we could. We don't know where the cassock went.&#8221;</P>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>三藏心中烦恼，懊恨行者不尽，却坐在上面念动那咒。行者扑的跌倒在地，抱着头，十分难禁，只教“莫念！莫念！管寻还了袈裟！”那众僧见了，一个个战兢兢的，上前跪下劝解，三藏才合口不念。行者一骨鲁跳起来，耳朵里掣出铁棒，要打那些和尚，被三藏喝住道：“这猴头！你头痛还不怕，还要无礼？休动手！且莫伤人！再与我审问一问！”众僧们磕头礼拜，哀告三藏道：“老爷饶命！我等委实的不曾看见。这都是那老死鬼的不是。他昨晚看着你的袈裟，只哭到更深时候，看也不曾敢看，思量要图长久，做个传家之宝，设计定策，要烧杀老爷。自火起之候，狂风大作，各人只顾救火，搬抢物件，更不知袈裟去向。”</p>

<P>Monkey went into the abbot's quarters at the back in a great rage and carried out the corpse of the old monk who had killed himself. When he stripped the body he found no treasures on it, so he dug up the floor of his room to a depth of three feet, again without finding a sign of the cassock. Monkey thought for a moment and then asked, &#8220;Are there any monsters turned spirits around here?&#8221;</P>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>行者大怒，走进方丈屋里，把那触死鬼尸首抬出，选剥了细看，浑身更无那件宝贝，就把个方丈掘地三尺，也无踪影。行者忖量半晌，问道：“你这里可有甚么妖怪成精么？”</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<P>&#8220;If you hadn't asked, sir, I'd never have imagined you wanted to know,&#8221; the abbot replied. &#8220;There is a mountain due South of here called the Black Wind Mountain, and in the Black Wind Cave-on it there lives a Great Black King. That old dead bastard of ours was always discussing the Way with him. There aren't any other evil spirits apart from him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How far is the mountain from here?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Only about seven miles,&#8221; the abbot replied. &#8220;It's the mountain you can see over there.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey smiled and said to Sanzang. &#8220;Don't worry, master, there's no need to ask any more questions. No doubt about it: it must have been stolen by that black monster.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But his place is seven miles from here, so how can you be sure it was him?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;You didn't see the fire last night,&#8221; Brother Monkey retorted. &#8220;The flames were leaping up hundreds of miles high, and the glow penetrated the triple heavens. You could have seen it seventy miles away, let alone seven. I'm convinced that he saw the glare and took the chance to slip over here quietly. When he saw that our cassock was a treasure, he must have stolen it in the confusion. Just wait while I go and find him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you go, who's going to protect me?&#8221; asked Sanzang.</P>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>院主道：“老爷不问，莫想得知。我这里正东南有座黑风山，黑风洞内有一个黑大王。我这老死鬼常与他讲道，他便是个妖精。别无甚物。”行者道：“那山离此有多远近？”院主道：“只有二十里，那望见山头的就是。”行者笑道：“师父放心，不须讲了，一定是那黑怪偷去无疑。”三藏道：“他那厢离此有二十里，如何就断得是他？”行者道：“你不曾见夜间那火，光腾万里，亮透三天，且休说二十里，就是二百里也照见了！坐定是他见火光焜耀，趁着机会，暗暗的来到这里，看见我们袈裟是件宝贝，必然趁哄掳去也。等老孙去寻他一寻。”三藏道：“你去了时，我却何倚？”</p>

<P>&#8220;Don't worry, gods are watching over you in secret, and in the visible sphere I'll make these monks serve you.&#8221; With that he called the community together and said, &#8220;I want some of you to go and bury that old ghost, and some of you to serve my master and look after our white horse.&#8221; The monks all assented obediently, and Monkey continued, &#8220;I won't have you agreeing glibly now but not waiting on them when I've gone. Those of you who look after my master must do so with pleasant expressions on your faces, and those who feed the horse must make sure he gets the right amount of hay and water. If there's the slightest mistake, I'll hit you like this.&#8221; He pulled out his cudgel, and smashed a fire-baked brick wall to smithereens; the shock from this shook down seven or eight more walls. At the sight of this the monks' bones turned to jelly, and they knelt down and kowtowed to him with tears pouring down their cheeks.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry, master, you can go&#8212;we'll look after him. We promise not to show any disrespect.&#8221; The splendid Monkey then went straight to the Black Wind Mountain with a leap of his somersault cloud to look for the cassock.</P>


<div class="poet">
<P>The Golden Cicada left the capital in search of the truth,</P>
<P>Leaning on his staff as he went to the distant West.</P>
<P>Along his route were tigers, leopards and wolves;</P>
<P>Few were the artisans, merchants, or scholars he met.</P>
<P>In a foreign land be encountered a stupid and covetous monk,</P>
<P>And depended entirely on the mighty Great Sage Equaling Heaven.</P>
<P>When fire and wind destroyed the monastery,</P>
<P>A black bear came one night to steal the silken cassock.</P>
</div>

<P>If you don't know whether the cassock was found on this journey or how things turned out, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

</div>

<div class="right">
<p>行者道：“这个放心，暗中自有神灵保护，明中等我叫那些和尚伏侍。”即唤众和尚过来道：“汝等着几个去埋那老鬼，着几个伏侍我师父，看守我白马！”众僧领诺。行者又道：“汝等莫顺口儿答应，等我去了，你就不来奉承。看师父的，要怡颜悦色；养白马的，要水草调匀。假有一毫儿差了，照依这个样棍，与你们看看！”他掣出棍子，照那火烧的砖墙扑的一下，把那墙打得粉碎，又震倒了有七八层墙。众僧见了，个个骨软身麻，跪着磕头滴泪道：“爷爷宽心前去，我等竭力虔心，供奉老爷，决不敢一毫怠慢！”好行者，急纵筋斗云，径上黑风山，寻找这袈裟。正是那：金禅求正出京畿，仗锡投西涉翠微。虎豹狼虫行处有，工商士客见时稀。路逢异国愚僧妒，全仗齐天大圣威。火发风生禅院废，黑熊夜盗锦襕衣。毕竟此去不知袈裟有无，吉凶如何，且听下回分解。
