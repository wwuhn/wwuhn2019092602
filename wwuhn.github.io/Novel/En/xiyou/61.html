<P>The Bull Demon King Gives Up the Fight to Go to a Feast</P>
<P>Monkey Tries the Second Time to Borrow the Plantain Fan</P>
</div>
<P>&#8220;The Strongarm King is the Bull Demon King,&#8221; the local god explained.</P>
<P>&#8220;Did he set these mountains ablaze and pretend they were the Fiery Mountains?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; the local god replied. &#8220;If you'll promise to forgive me for doing so, Great Sage, I'll speak frankly.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What's there to forgive?&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;Speak frankly.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You started this fire, Great Sage,&#8221; the local god replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;That's nonsense,&#8221; said Monkey angrily. &#8220;I wasn't here. Do you take me for an arsonist?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't realize who I am,&#8221; the local god said. &#8220;These mountains haven't always been here. When you made havoc in Heaven five hundred years ago and were captured by the Illustrious Sage Erlang you were escorted to Lord Lao Zi, put in the Eight Trigrams Furnace and refined. When the furnace was opened you kicked it over, and some of its bricks that still had fire in them fell here as the Fiery Mountains. I used to be one of the Taoist boys who looked after the furnace in the Tushita Palace, but Lord Lao Zi was so angry with me for failing in my duty that he sent me down to be the local god here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I was wondering why you were dressed like that,&#8221; said Pig forcefully, &#8220;you're a Taoist turned local god.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Tell me why I need to find the Strongarm King,&#8221; said Monkey, only half-convinced.</P>
<P>&#8220;He's Raksasi's husband,&#8221; the local god said. &#8220;He's abandoned her now and gone to live in the Cloud-touching Cave in Mount Thunder Piled. A fox king there who'd lived for ten thousand years died leaving an only daughter, Princess Jade, with property worth a million but nobody to manage it. Two years ago she visited the Bull Demon King and found out about his tremendous magical powers. She decided to give him her property if he'd come to live in her cave as her husband. So the Bull Demon King abandoned Raksasi and hasn't been back to see her for ages. If you can find him, Great Sage, and persuade him to come here you'll be able to borrow the real fan. First, you'll be able to blow the flames out to take your master across the mountains. Second, you'll put an end to this disastrous fire so that the land here can come back to life. And third, I'll be pardoned and allowed to go back to Heaven and return to live under Lord Lao Zi's command.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where is Mount Thunder Piled, and how far is it from here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Due South,&#8221; the local deity said, &#8220;and over a thousand miles.&#8221; Once he knew this Monkey told Friar Sand and Pig to look after the master and ordered the local god to stay with them. There was then a roaring like the wind as he disappeared.</P>
<P>In less than an hour he saw a high mountain that touched the sky. Bringing his cloud down he stood on the peak to look around, and this is what he saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Was it tall?</P>
<P>Its peak touched the azure sky.</P>
<P>Was it big?</P>
<P>Its roots went down to the Yellow Springs.</P>
<P>While the sun warmed the front of the mountain</P>
<P>The winds behind the ridge blew cold.</P>
<P>On the sun-warmed front of the mountain</P>
<P>The flowers and trees never knew what winter was;</P>
<P>In the cold winds behind the ridge</P>
<P>The ice and frost did not even melt in summer.</P>
<P>From a dragon pool a river flowed in gullies;</P>
<P>Flowers bloomed early by the tiger's cave in the crag.</P>
<P>The river split into a thousand jade streams;</P>
<P>The flowers bloomed together like brocade.</P>
<P>On the twisting ridge grew twisted trees;</P>
<P>Beside the knotted rocks were knotted pines.</P>
<P>Indeed there were</P>
<P>A high mountain,</P>
<P>Steep ridges,</P>
<P>Sheer precipices,</P>
<P>Fragrant flowers,</P>
<P>Fine fruit,</P>

<P>Red creepers,</P>
<P>Purple bamboo,</P>
<P>Green pines,</P>
<P>Turquoise willows.</P>
<P>It looked the same throughout the seasons;</P>
<P>Changeless forever, like a dragon.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After looking for a long time the Great Sage walked down from the towering peak to find his way through the mountain. Just when he was feeling bewildered a slender young woman came towards him holding a spray of fragrant orchid. The Great Sage slipped behind a grotesque rock and took a good look at her. This is what she was like:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A ravishing beauty to enchant a nation</P>
<P>Walking so slowly on her little lotus feet.</P>
<P>Her face was like Wang Qiang or the woman of Chu.</P>
<P>She was a talking flower,</P>
<P>Scented jade.</P>
<P>The hair was swept down from her coiffure like jade-blue crows;</P>
<P>The green of her eyes made one think of autumn floods.</P>
<P>Her silken skirt showed a glimpse of tiny feet;</P>
<P>From her turquoise sleeves came long and elegant wrists.</P>
<P>She would put anyone into the mood for love;</P>
<P>Red were her lips, and white her pearly teeth.</P>
<P>Her skin was as smooth and her brows as fine as the Jinjiang beauty;</P>
<P>She was more than a match for Wenjun or Xue Tao.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As the young woman slowly approached the rock the Great Sage bowed to her and said, &#8220;Where are you going, Bodhisattva?&#8221; Before he spoke she had not noticed him; but when she looked up and saw how hideous the Great Sage was she was petrified, unable to move forward or back.</P>
<P>All she could do was shiver and force herself to reply, &#8220;Where are you from? How dare you question me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If I tell her about fetching the scriptures and borrowing the fan,&#8221; the Great Sage thought, &#8220;this damn woman might be some relation of the Bull Demon King's. I'd better pretend to be some kinsman of the Bull Demon King come to invite him to a banquet.&#8221;</P>
<P>When he would not answer her questions the woman turned angry and shouted, &#8220;Who are you and how dare you question me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm from Mount Turquoise Cloud,&#8221; Monkey replied with a bow and a forced smile. &#8220;I don't know the way as it's my first time here. Could I ask you, Bodhisattva, if this is Mount Thunder Piled?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It is,&#8221; she replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where might I find the Cloud-touching Cave?&#8221; the Great Sage asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you want to find it for?&#8221; the woman asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I've been sent by Princess Iron Fan in the Plantain Cave on Mount Turquoise Cloud with an invitation for the Bull Demon King,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>The moment the woman heard him speak of Princess Iron Fan sending an invitation to the Bull Demon King she flared into a rage and went crimson from ear to ear.</P>
<P>&#8220;She ought to know better, the low bitch. It's less than two years since the Bull Demon King came here, and goodness only knows how much jewelry, gold, silver, fine silk and brocade I've given her since then. I send her firewood every year and rice every month. She's doing nicely thank you. So what's the shameless hussy doing, sending him an invitation?&#8221;</P>
<P>When the Great Sage heard this and realized that she was Princess Jade he deliberately pulled out his iron cudgel and shouted at her, &#8220;You're a damned bitch, using your wealth to buy the Bull Demon King. You could only get him to marry you for your money. You ought to be thoroughly ashamed of yourself instead of being so insulting.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this all of her souls sent flying, and she fled trembling with terror, stumbling and tripping over her shoes, while the Great Sage ran after her, shouting and roaring. Once they were out from under the shade of the pines they were at the entrance to the Cloud-touching Cave. She ran inside and the doors slammed shut behind her. Only then did Monkey put his cudgel away and take a good look:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A thick forest,</P>
<P>Sheer precipices,</P>
<P>Luxuriance of creepers,</P>
<P>Fragrance of orchids.</P>
<P>The spring washed over jade and through bamboo;</P>
<P>Grotesque and cunning rocks held precious stones.</P>
<P>The distant peaks were wreathed in mists;</P>
<P>Sun and moon lit up the cloudy crags.</P>
<P>Dragons howled, tigers roared,</P>
<P>Cranes called and warblers sang.</P>
<P>Fresh and lovely was its elegant peace,</P>
<P>And the scenery was radiant with precious flowers.</P>
<P>It was a match for Tiantai's magic caves,</P>
<P>And finer than the Peng and Ying islands in the sea.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We will say nothing of how Brother Monkey admired the view but tell how the young woman, dripping with sweat after running and her heart beating wildly from terror, went straight to the study where the Bull Demon King was quietly perusing a book on cinnabar alchemy. She threw herself into his arms feeling thoroughly put out, scratched and tugged at his face and ears, and howled aloud.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't upset yourself so, my lovely,&#8221; said the Bull Demon King, all smiles. &#8220;What do you want to tell me?&#8221;</P>
<P>She then began to prance and jump about in her fury as she said abusively, &#8220;You're killing me, damned monster.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What makes you say that?&#8221; he asked, all smiles.</P>
<P>&#8220;I brought you here to look after me and protect me because I'd lost my parents and people who'd been around all said that you were a tough guy,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But you're just another henpecked hack.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Bull Demon King took her in his arms and said, &#8220;How've I done you wrong, my lovely? Take your time and tell me about it. I'll make it up to you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I was taking a stroll among the flowers outside the cave just now picking orchids,&#8221; she said, &#8220;When a monk with a face like a thunder god rushed up to me and started bowing. I was so scared I couldn't move. When I calmed down enough to ask him who he was he said he'd been sent by that Princess Iron Fan with an invitation for you. I was so angry I had something to say about that, and he started abusing me and chased me with his cudgel. He'd have just about killed me with it if I hadn't run so fast. So you see, bringing you here was a disaster. It's killing me.&#8221; At this the Bull Demon King apologized to her very earnestly. It took a long time and many tender attentions from his before she finally calmed down.</P>
<P>&#8220;I tell you the truth, my lovely,&#8221; the demon king said forcefully. &#8220;The Plantain Cave may be rather out of the way, but it's a place of purity and elegance. That wife of mine has had the highest moral principles since childhood, and she's also an immortal who has attained the Way. She runs her household very strictly. There's not even a page there. She couldn't possibly have sent a monk with a face like a thunder god. I wonder what evil fiend he is. He must have used her name to come and see me. I'm going out to have a look.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid demon king strode out of the study and into the hall to put on his armor and take his iron cudgel. &#8220;Who are you, and why are you behaving so outrageously?&#8221; he shouted as he went out through the doors. Monkey, who was watching from one side, saw that he now looked quite different from the way he had five hundred years earlier.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>His wrought iron helmet shone like water or silver;</P>
<P>His golden armor was trimmed with silks and brocades.</P>
<P>The toes of his deerskin boots turned up; their soles were white.</P>
<P>The silken belt at his waist included three lion's tails.</P>
<P>His eyes were as bright as mirrors,</P>
<P>His brows as elegant as red rainbows,</P>
<P>His mouth like a bowl of blood,</P>
<P>His teeth a row of copper plates.</P>
<P>At his resounding roar the mountain gods took fright;</P>
<P>Evil ghosts were overawed by his majestic power.</P>
<P>His fame was known throughout the seas for raising chaos;</P>
<P>He was the Strongarm Demon King here in the West.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Great Sage then tidied his clothes, stepped forward, chanted a deep &#8220;re-e-er&#8221; of respect, and asked, &#8220;Can you still recognize me, eldest brother?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Are you Sun Wukong, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven?&#8221; the Bull Demon King replied, returning his bow.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;It's such a long time since last we met. I only got here to see you because I asked a woman some questions just now. I must congratulate you on how well everything is growing.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Cut that out,&#8221; the Bull Demon King shouted back. &#8220;I heard about you making havoc in Heaven and being crushed under the Five Elements Mountain by the Lord Buddha. Then you were released from your heavenly punishment to protect the Tang Priest on his way to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures in the Western Heaven. Why did you have to destroy my son, the Sage Boy Bullcalf? I'm very angry with you. Why are you here looking for me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please don't misjudge me, brother,&#8221; said the Great Sage with another bow. &#8220;Your good son captured my master and was going to eat him. I was no match for him. Luckily the Bodhisattva Guanyin rescued my master and converted your boy. He's now the page Sudhana. He's even taller than you. He lives in a temple of great bliss and enjoys eternal ease. There's nothing wrong with any of that, so why be angry with me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Smooth-tongued macaque,&#8221; retorted the Bull Demon King. &#8220;Even if you can talk your way out of having ruined my son, what do you mean by upsetting my beloved concubine and chasing her up to my doors?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I made a polite inquiry of the lady because I could not find you,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;I never realized she was your second wife, so when she was rude to me I acted rough. Please forgive me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well then,&#8221; the Bull Demon King said. &#8220;I'll let you off this time for the sake of our old friendship.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm very grateful indeed for your immense kindness,&#8221; the Great Sage replied. &#8220;But there is one thing I'd like to trouble you with. I hope you'll be able to help me out.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You macaque,&#8221; the Bull Demon King shouted at him, &#8220;you think you can get away with anything! I spare your life, but instead of making yourself scarce you have to keep pestering me. What do you mean by helping out?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Let me be honest with you,&#8221; the Great Sage replied. &#8220;I'm stuck at the Fiery Mountains on my journey escorting the Tang Priest, and we're not getting anywhere. The local people told me that your good lady Raksasi has a plantain fan. I tried to borrow it. I went to visit my sister-in-law, but she refused to lend it me, which is why I've come to see you. I beg you, brother, in the greatness of your heart to come with me to sister-in-law's place and borrow the fan for me so that I can blow out the fires and get my master across the mountains. Then I'll return it right away.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this the Bull Demon King's heart blazed with wrath. &#8220;You told me you knew how to behave,&#8221; he said, noisily gnashing his teeth of steel. &#8220;I suppose all this was not just to borrow the fan. I'm certain my wife has refused to lend it you because you've mistreated her. So that's why you came to see me. On top of that you send my beloved concubine fleeing in terror. As the saying goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>'Don't push around</P>
<P>Your best friend's wife,</P>
<P>Don't try to destroy</P>
<P>The joy of his life.'</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>You've been pushing my wife around and trying to destroy the concubine who's the joy of my life. It's an outrage. Take this!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you want to hit me, brother, I'm not afraid,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;All I want is the treasure. I beg you to lend it me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you can last out three rounds with me,&#8221; the Bull Demon King said, &#8220;I'll make my wife lend it to you. And if you can't I'll kill you and have my revenge.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Good idea, brother,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;I've been so lazy. I haven't been to see you for ages, and I don't know how your fighting powers now compare with the old days. Let's have a match with our cudgels.&#8221; The Bull Demon King was in no mood for further argument, and he hit at Monkey's head with his mace. Monkey hit back with his gold-banded cudgel. It was a splendid fight:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The gold-banded cudgel,</P>
<P>The rough iron mace,</P>
<P>Are no longer friends.</P>
<P>One said, &#8220;You destroyed my son, you macaque.&#8221;</P>
<P>The other, &#8220;Don't be angry: he has found the Way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How could you be so stupid as to come to my door?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am here to visit you with a special purpose.&#8221;</P>
<P>One wanted the fan to protect the Tang Priest;</P>
<P>The other was too mean to lend the plantain leaf.</P>
<P>Friendship was lost in the exchange of words;</P>
<P>In anger neither had any sense of brotherhood.</P>
<P>The Bull Demon King's mace moved like a dragon;</P>
<P>The Great Sage's cudgel sent gods and demons fleeing.</P>
<P>First they fought in front of the mountain,</P>
<P>Then they both rose on auspicious clouds.</P>
<P>They showed their great powers up in mid-air,</P>
<P>Doing wonderful movements in multi-coloured light.</P>
<P>The clash of their cudgels rocked the gates of Heaven;</P>
<P>They were too evenly matched for either to win.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Great Sage and the Bull Demon King fought over a hundred rounds without either emerging as the victor. Just as they were becoming locked in their struggle a voice called from the peak, &#8220;King Bull, my king sends his respects and invites you to honour him with your presence at a banquet.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this the Bull Demon King blocked the gold-banded cudgel with his iron mace and called out, &#8220;You stay here, macaque. I'm going to a friend's house for a meal. I'll be back.&#8221; With that he landed his cloud and went straight back into the cave.</P>
<P>&#8220;My lovely,&#8221; he said to Princess Jade, &#8220;the man you saw with a face like a thunder god is the macaque Sun Wukong. A bout with my mace has sent him packing: he won't be back. Stop worrying and enjoy yourself. I'm going to a Mend's place for some drinks.&#8221; He then took off his helmet and armor, donned a duck-green jacket of cut velvet, went outside and mounted his water-averting golden-eyed beast. Telling his underlings to look after the palace he headed Northwest in clouds and mist.</P>
<P>While the Great Sage watched all this from the peak he thought, &#8220;I wonder who the friend is and where he's gone for his banquet. I'll follow him.&#8221; Splendid Monkey then shook himself and turned into a clear breeze to follow him. He soon reached a mountain, but the Bull Demon King was nowhere to be seen. The Great Sage turned back into himself and started to search the mountain. He found a deep pool of pure water beside which was inscribed in large letters on a tablet of stone</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>RAGGED ROCK MOUNTAIN</P>
<P>GREEN WAVE POOL</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Old Bull must have gone into the water,&#8221; Monkey thought, &#8220;and underwater spirits are lesser dragons, dragon or fish spirits, or else turtle, tortoise or terrapin spirits. I'd better go down and have a look.&#8221;</P>
<P>Making a hand-spell and saying the magic words the splendid Great Sage shook himself, turned into a medium-sized crab weighing thirty-six pounds, jumped into the water with a splash, and went straight down to the bottom of the pool. He saw an ornamental arch of delicate tracery to which was tethered a water-averting golden-eyed beast. On the other side of the arch there was no more water. Monkey crawled through and took a careful look. From one side he heard music, and this is what he saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Cowry gateways to a palace red,</P>
<P>Like nothing else in the world.</P>
<P>The roof tiles were of yellow gold,</P>
<P>The door pivots of whitest jade.</P>
<P>The screens were of tortoise-shell,</P>
<P>The balustrades of coral and of pearl.</P>
<P>Auspicious clouds glowed all around the throne,</P>
<P>From the sky above right down to the ground.</P>
<P>This was not the palace of Heaven or the sea,</P>
<P>Although it more than rivaled an island paradise.</P>
<P>A banquet for host and guests was set in the lofty hall,</P>
<P>Where all the official wore their hats with pearls.</P>
<P>Jade girls were told to bring ivory bowls,</P>
<P>Exquisite beauties to play fine music.</P>
<P>The great whale sang,</P>
<P>Giant crabs danced,</P>
<P>Turtles played pipes and drums,</P>
<P>While pearls shone over the goblets and boaras.</P>
<P>Birdlike script adorned the turquoise screens,</P>
<P>While shrimp-whisker curtains hung along the corridors.</P>
<P>From the eight notes mingled came wonderful music</P>
<P>Whose tones rose up to the clouds above.</P>
<P>Green-headed singsong girls stroked zithers of jasper</P>
<P>While red-eyed dragonflies played jade flutes.</P>
<P>Mandarin fish carried dried venison in on their heads,</P>
<P>While dragon girls had the wings of golden pheasants in their hair.</P>
<P>What they ate were</P>
<P>The rarest delicacies of the heavenly kitchen;</P>
<P>What they drank were</P>
<P>The finest vintages of the purple palace.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Bull Demon King was sitting in the seat of honour with three or four lesser dragon spirits on either side. Facing him was an ancient dragon, surrounded by dragon sons, dragon grandsons, dragon wives and dragon daughters. Just as they were feasting and drinking the Great Sage Sun marched straight in, to be spotted by the ancient dragon, who ordered, &#8220;Arrest that vagrant crab.&#8221; The dragon sons and grandsons fell upon him and seized him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Spare me, spare me,&#8221; said Monkey, suddenly reverting to human speech.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you from, crab vagrant?&#8221; the ancient dragon asked. &#8220;How dare you come into my hall and behave in this disgraceful way in front of my distinguished guests? Tell me this moment if you want to be spared the death penalty.&#8221; The splendid Great Sage then made up a pack of lies to tell him:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Ever since coming to live in the lake</P>
<P>I've had to make my home in cliffs and caves.</P>
<P>Over the years I've learned to stretch myself out</P>
<P>So now I am known as the Sideways Man-at-arms.</P>
<P>Dragging my way through weeds and through mud,</P>
<P>I have never been taught correct social behavior.</P>
<P>If in my ignorance I have caused offence I beg</P>
<P>Your Majesty to show me mercy.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the spirits at the banquet heard this they all bowed to the ancient dragon and said, &#8220;This is the first time that the Sideways Man-at-arms has come to your palace of jasper, and he does not understand royal etiquette. We beg Your Excellency to spare him.&#8221;</P>
<P>The ancient dragon thanked the spirits and ordered, &#8220;Release the wretch. Put a beating on record against his name, and have him wait outside.&#8221; The Great Sage acknowledged his kindness then fled for his life till he reached the archway outside.</P>
<P>&#8220;That Bull Demon King is drinking for all he's worth in there,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;I'm not going to wait till the feast breaks up. And even if I did he still wouldn't lend me the fan. I'd do better to steal his golden-eyed beast and turn myself into a Bull Demon King. Then I can trick Raksasi into lending me the fan and I'll be able to escort my master across the mountains. That'll be best.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage then reverted to his original form, untied the golden-eyed beast, leapt into the carved saddle, and rode straight up from the bottom of the water. Once out of the pool he made himself look like the Bull Demon King. Whipping on the beast he set his cloud moving and was soon at the mouth of the Plantain Cave in Mount Turquoise Cloud.</P>
<P>&#8220;Open up!&#8221; he shouted, and at the sound of his voice the two servant girls inside the gates opened them for him.</P>
<P>Taking him for the Bull Demon King they went in to report, &#8220;Madam, His Majesty's come home.&#8221; At the news Raksasi quickly neatened her hair and hurried out on her little lotus feet to meet him. Climbing out of the saddle the Great Sage led the golden-eyed beast inside. He was bold enough to try to deceive the beauty, whose mortal eyes failed to see who he really was as she led him inside, hand in hand. The maids were told to prepare places and bring tea, and as the master was back the whole household tried its hardest.</P>
<P>The Great Sage and Raksasi were soon talking. &#8220;My good lady,&#8221; said the false Bull Demon King, &#8220;it's been a long time.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I hope that everything has gone well for Your Majesty,&#8221; Raksasi replied, going on to ask, &#8220;What wind brings you back to your abandoned wife now that you have married your new darling?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no question of having abandoned you,&#8221; the Great Sage replied with a smile. &#8220;It's just that I've been away a long time since Princess Jade invited me to her place. I'm kept very busy with domestic matters to deal with and friends to attend to. I hear that so-and-so Sun Wukong is very near the Fiery Mountains with the Tang Priest, and I'm worried that he might come and ask you to lend him the fan. I can't forgive him for destroying our son, I want my revenge. If he turns up, just send someone to tell me. When I get him we can cut his body up into ten thousand pieces as revenge for what we have suffered.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You Majesty,&#8221; replied Raksasi, in tears at what he had just said, &#8220;as the saying goes, 'A man with no woman is risking his wealth; a woman with no husband is risking her health.' That macaque practically killed me.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this the Great Sage pretended to fly into a terrible rage. &#8220;When did that bloody monkey go?&#8221; he swore.</P>
<P>&#8220;He hasn't gone yet,&#8221; Raksasi replied. &#8220;He was here yesterday to borrow the fan, and as he'd destroyed our boy I put my armor on and went out to cut him to bits with my swords. But he endured the pain, called me his sister-in-law, and said that you and he were once sworn brothers.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He was my seventh sworn brother five hundred years ago,&#8221; the Great Sage replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;He said not a word when I swore at him,&#8221; Raksasi continued, &#8220;and didn't strike back when I cut him. Finally I blew him away with the fan. Goodness only knows where he got some wind-fixing magic from, but this morning he was back shouting outside the door again, and the fan wouldn't move him no matter how hard I waved it. When I swung my swords around and went for him with them he wasn't being polite any more. I was so scared of the force of his cudgel I came back in here and had the doors tightly shut. Somehow or other he managed to get right into my belly and it practically killed me. I had to call him brother-in-law and lend him the fan before he'd go.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Great Sage put on a great show of beating his chest and saying, &#8220;How terrible, how terrible. You did wrong, wife. You should never have given that treasure to the macaque.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be angry, Your Majesty,&#8221; Raksasi replied. &#8220;I lent him a false fan and tricked him into going away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where's the real one?&#8221; the Great Sage asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;don't worry. It's safely put away.&#8221; She then told the serving girls to lay on wine and a feast to welcome him back. &#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; she then said, offering him a goblet of wine, &#8220;please don't forget the wife of your youth in the joy of your new marriage. Won't you drink this cup of wine from home?&#8221; The Great Sage had no choice but to accept the goblet and smile as he raised it.</P>
<P>&#8220;You drink first, wife,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I've left you looking after the home by yourself, good lady, for too long, while I've been busy with my other property. Let this be a gesture of my gratitude.&#8221;</P>
<P>Raksasi took the goblet back, lifted it again, and handed it to the king with the words, &#8220;As the old saying goes: The wife is the equal, but the husband is the father who supports her. You don't need to thank me.&#8221; It was only after more such politeness that the two of them sat down and began drinking. Not wanting to break his vow to avoid meat, the Great Sage only ate some fruit while he talked to her.</P>
<P>After they had each had several cups Raksasi was feeling a little drunk and rather sexy. She started to press herself against the Great Sage, stroking and pinching him. Taking him by the hand, she whispered tender words to him; leaning her shoulder against him, she spoke quietly and submissively. They shared the same cup of wine, drinking a mouthful each at a time, and she fed him fruit. The Great Sage pretended to go along with this and smile. He had no choice but to lean against her. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The hook to catch poetry,</P>
<P>The broom to sweep away sorrow,</P>
<P>The remover of all difficulties is wine.</P>
<P>The man, though virtuous, unbuttoned his lapel;</P>
<P>The woman forgot herself and began to laugh.</P>
<P>Her face had the complexion of a peach,</P>
<P>Her body swayed like a willow sapling.</P>
<P>Many a word came babbling from her mouth</P>
<P>As she pinched and nipped in her desire.</P>
<P>Sometimes she tugged at her hair,</P>
<P>Or waved her delicate fingers.</P>
<P>She often raised a foot</P>
<P>And twitched the sleeves of her clothes.</P>
<P>Her powdered neck sunk lower</P>
<P>And her fine waist started to wiggle.</P>
<P>She never stopped talking for a moment</P>
<P>As she opened gold buttons to half show her breasts.</P>
<P>In her cups she was like a landslide of jade,</P>
<P>And as she rubbed her bleary eyes she did not look at her best.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Watching her get drunk the Great Sage had kept his wits about him, and he tried to lead her on by saying, &#8220;Where have you put the real fan, wife? You must watch it very carefully all the time. I'm worried that Sun the Novice will trick it out of you with some of his many transformations.&#8221; At this Raksasi tittered, spat it out of her mouth, and handed it to the Great Sage. It was only the size of an apricot leaf.</P>
<P>&#8220;Here's the treasure,&#8221; she said.</P>
<P>The Great Sage took it but could not believe that it really was. &#8220;How could a tiny little thing like this blow a fire out?&#8221; he wondered. &#8220;It must be another fake.&#8221;</P>
<P>Seeing him looking at the treasure so deep in thought, Raksasi could not restrain herself from rubbing her powdered face against Monkey's and saying, &#8220;Put the treasure away and have another drink, darling. What are you looking so worried about?&#8221;</P>
<P>The Great Sage took the chance to slip in the question, &#8220;How could a little thing like this blow out 250 miles of fire?&#8221; She was now drunk enough to have no inhibitions about speaking the truth, so she told him how it was done: &#8220;Your Majesty, I expect you've been overdoing your pleasures day and night these last two years since you left me. That Princess Jade must have addled your brains if you can't even remember about your own treasure. You just have to pinch the seventh red silk thread with the thumb of your left hand and say,<I> 'Huixuhexixichuihu.'</I> Then it'll grow twelve feet long. It can do as many changes as you like. It could blow 250,000 miles of flame out with a single wave.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Great Sage committed all this very carefully to memory, put the fan in his mouth, rubbed his face and turned back into himself. &#8220;Raksasi!&#8221; he yelled at the top of his voice. &#8220;Have a careful look: I'm your brother-in-law. What a disgusting way you've been carrying on in with me, and for what a long time too. You're shameless, quite shameless.&#8221;</P>
<P>In her horror at realizing it was Sun Wukong she pushed the dining table over and fell into the dust, overcome with shame and screaming. &#8220;I'm so upset I could die, I could die.&#8221;</P>
<P>Not caring whether she was dead or alive, the Great Sage broke free and rushed straight out of the Plantain Cave. He was indeed not lusting after that female beauty, and glad to turn away with a smiling face. He sprang on his auspicious cloud that took him up to the top of the mountain, spat the fan out of his mouth, and tried the magic out. Pinching the seventh red tassel with the thumb of his left hand, he said<I> &#8220;Huixuhexixichuihu,&#8221;</I> and indeed it grew to be twelve feet long. On close examination he found it quite different from the false one he had borrowed before. It glittered with auspicious light and was surrounded by lucky vapors. Thirty-six threads of red silk formed a trellis pattern inside and out. But Brother Monkey had only asked how to make it grow and had not found out the spell for shrinking it. So he had to shoulder it as he went back by the way he had come.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the Bull Demon King's feast with all the spirits at the bottom of the Green Wave Pool ended he went outside to find that the water-averting golden-eyed beast was missing. The ancient dragon king called the spirits together to ask them, &#8220;Which of you untied and stole the Bull Demon King's golden-eyed beast?&#8221; The spirits all knelt down and replied, &#8220;We wouldn't dare steal it. We were all waiting, singing or playing at the banquet. None of us was out here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am sure that none of you palace musicians would have dared to take it,&#8221; the ancient dragon said. &#8220;Have any strangers been here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;A crab spirit was here not long ago during the banquet, and he was a stranger.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this the Bull King suddenly realized what had happened. &#8220;Say no more,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;When you sent your messenger with the invitation this morning there was a Sun Wukong there who'd come to ask to borrow my plantain fan as he couldn't get the Tang Priest he's escorting to fetch the scriptures across the Fiery Mountains. I refused. I was in the middle of a fight with him that neither of us was winning when I shook him off and came straight here to the banquet. That monkey's extremely quick and adaptable. I'm sure that the crab spirit was him here in disguise to do a bit of spying. He's stolen my beast to go and trick the plantain fan out of my wife.&#8221; This news made all the spirits shake with fright.</P>
<P>&#8220;Do you mean the Sun Wukong who made havoc in Heaven?&#8221; they asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the Bull Demon King replied. &#8220;If any of you gentlemen have any trouble on the road West keep your distance from him whatever you do.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But if all that's true, what about Your Majesty's steed?&#8221; the ancient dragon asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;No problem,&#8221; the Bull Demon King replied with a smile. &#8220;You gentlemen may all go home now while I go after him.&#8221;</P>
<P>With that he parted his way through the waters, sprang up from the bottom of the pool and rode a yellow cloud straight to the Plantain Cave on Mount Turquoise Cloud, where he heard Raksasi stamping her feet, beating her breast, howling and moaning. He pushed the doors open to see the water-averting golden-eyed beast tethered by them.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where did Sun Wukong go, wife?&#8221; the Bull Demon King said.</P>
<P>Seeing that the Bull Demon King was back, the serving girls all knelt down and said, &#8220;Are you home, Your Majesty?&#8221;</P>
<P>Raksasi grabbed hold of him, banged her head against his, and said abusively, &#8220;Damn and blast you, you careless fool. Why ever did you let that macaque steal the golden-eyed beast and turn himself into your double to come here and trick me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Which way did the macaque go?&#8221; the Bull Demon King asked, grinding his teeth in fury. Beating her breast Raksasi continued to pour out abuse: &#8220;The damn monkey tricked me out of my treasure, turned back into himself, and went. I'm so angry I could die.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do look after yourself, wife,&#8221; the Bull Demon King said, &#8220;and don't be so upset. When I've caught the macaque and taken the treasure off him I'll skin him, grind his bones to powder, and bring you his heart and liver. That'll make you feel better.&#8221; He then called for weapons.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty's weapons aren't here,&#8221; the serving girls replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Then bring your mistress' weapons,&#8221; the Bull Demon King replied. The servants brought her pair of blue-tipped swords, and the Bull Demon King took off the duck-green velvet jacket he had worn to the banquet and tied the little waistcoat he wore next to his skin more tightly. He then strode out of the Plantain Cave, a sword in each hand, and headed straight for the Fiery Mountains in pursuit of Monkey. It was a case of</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The man who forgot a kindness</P>
<P>Tricking a doting wife;</P>
<P>The fiery-tempered old demon</P>
<P>Meeting a mendicant monk.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know whether this journey was ill-fated or not, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>牛魔王罢战赴华筵</p>
<p>孙行者二调芭蕉扇</p>
</div>
<p>土地说：“大力王即牛魔王也。”行者道：“这山本是牛魔王放的火，假名火焰山？”土地道：“不是不是，大圣若肯赦小神之罪，方敢直言。”行者道：“你有何罪？直说无妨。”土地道：“这火原是大圣放的。”行者怒道：“我在那里，你这等乱谈！我可是放火之辈？”土地道：“是你也认不得我了。此间原无这座山，因大圣五百年前大闹天宫时，被显圣擒了，压赴老君，将大圣安于八卦炉内，煅炼之后开鼎，被你蹬倒丹炉，落了几个砖来，内有余火，到此处化为火焰山。我本是兜率宫守炉的道人，当被老君怪我失守，降下此间，就做了火焰山土地也。”猪八戒闻言恨道：“怪道你这等打扮！原来是道士变的土地！”行者半信不信道：“你且说，早寻大力王何故？’土地道：“大力王乃罗刹女丈夫。他这向撇了罗刹，现在积雷山摩云洞。有个万岁狐王，那狐王死了，遗下一个女儿，叫做玉面公主。那公主有百万家私，无人掌管，二年前，访着牛魔王神通广大，情愿倒陪家私，招赘为夫。那牛王弃了罗刹，久不回顾。若大圣寻着牛王，拜求来此，方借得真扇。一则扇息火焰，可保师父前进；二来永除火患，可保此地生灵；三者赦我归天，回缴老君法旨。”行者道：</p>

<p>“积雪山坐落何处？到彼有多少程途？”土地道：“在正南方。此间到彼，有三千余里。”行者闻言，即吩咐沙僧、八戒保护师父，又教土地，陪伴勿回，随即忽的一声，渺然不见。</p>

<p>那里消半个时辰，早见一座高山凌汉。按落云头，停立巅峰之上观看，真是好山：高不高，顶摩碧汉；大不大，根扎黄泉。</p>

<p>山前日暖，岭后风寒。山前日暖，有三冬草木无知；岭后风寒，见九夏冰霜不化。龙潭接涧水长流，虎穴依崖花放早。水流千派似飞琼，花放一心如布锦。湾环岭上湾环树，扢扠石外扢扠松。真个是高的山，峻的岭，陡的崖，深的涧，香的花，美的果，红的藤，紫的竹，青的松，翠的柳：八节四时颜不改，千年万古色如龙。大圣看彀多时，步下尖峰，入深山，找寻路径。正自没个消息，忽见松阴下，有一女子，手折了一枝香兰，袅袅娜娜而来。大圣闪在怪石之旁，定睛观看，那女子怎生模样：娇娇倾国色，缓缓步移莲。貌若王嫱，颜如楚女。如花解语，似玉生香。</p>

<p>高髻堆青軃碧鸦，双睛蘸绿横秋水。湘裙半露弓鞋小，翠袖微舒粉腕长。说甚么暮雨朝云，真个是朱唇皓齿。锦江滑腻蛾眉秀，赛过文君与薛涛。那女子渐渐走近石边，大圣躬身施礼，缓缓而言曰：“女菩萨何往？”那女子未曾观看，听得叫问，却自抬头，忽见大圣的相貌丑陋，老大心惊，欲退难退，欲行难行，只得战兢兢，勉强答道：“你是何方来者？敢在此间问谁？”大圣沉思道：“我若说出取经求扇之事，恐这厮与牛王有亲，且只以假亲托意，来请魔王之言而答方可。”那女子见他不语，变了颜色，怒声喝道：“你是何人，敢来问我！”大圣躬身陪笑道：“我是翠云山来的，初到贵处，不知路径。敢问菩萨，此间可是积雷山？”那女子道：“正是。”大圣道：“有个摩云洞，坐落何处？”那女子道：“你寻那洞做甚？”大圣道：“我是翠云山芭蕉洞铁扇公主央来请牛魔王的。”那女子一听铁扇公主请牛魔王之言，心中大怒，彻耳根子通红，泼口骂道：“这贱婢，着实无知！牛王自到我家，未及二载，也不知送了他多少珠翠金银，绫罗缎匹。年供柴，月供米，自自在在受用，还不识羞，又来请他怎的！”大圣闻言，情知是玉面公主，故意子掣出铁棒大喝一声道：“你这泼贱，将家私买住牛王，诚然是陪钱嫁汉！你倒不羞，却敢骂谁！”</p>

<p>那女子见了，唬得魄散魂飞，没好步乱躧金莲，战兢兢回头便走，这大圣吆吆喝喝，随后相跟。原来穿过松阴，就是摩云洞口，女子跑进去，扑的把门关了。大圣却收了铁棒，咳咳停步看时，好所在：树林森密，崖削崚嶒。薜萝阴冉冉，兰蕙味馨馨。流泉漱玉穿修竹，巧石知机带落英。烟霞笼远岫，日月照云屏。龙吟虎啸，鹤唳莺鸣。一片清幽真可爱，琪花瑶草景常明。不亚天台仙洞，胜如海上蓬瀛。</p>

<p>且不言行者这里观看景致，却说那女子跑得粉汗淋淋，唬得兰心吸吸，径入书房里面。原来牛魔王正在那里静玩丹书，这女子没好气倒在怀里，抓耳挠腮，放声大哭。牛王满面陪笑道：“美人，休得烦恼。有甚话说？”那女子跳天索地，口中骂道：</p>

<p>“泼魔害杀我也！”牛王笑道：“你为甚事骂我？”女子道：“我因父母无依，招你护身养命。江湖中说你是条好汉，你原来是个惧内的庸夫！”牛王闻说，将女子抱住道：“美人，我有那些不是处，你且慢慢说来，我与你陪礼。”女子道：“适才我在洞外闲步花阴，折兰采蕙，忽有一个毛脸雷公嘴的和尚，猛地前来施礼，把我吓了个呆挣。及定性问是何人，他说是铁扇公主央他来请牛魔王的。被我说了两句，他倒骂了我一场，将一根棍子，赶着我打。若不是走得快些，几乎被他打死！这不是招你为祸？害杀我也！”牛王闻言，却与他整容陪礼，温存良久，女子方才息气。魔王却发狠道：“美人在上，不敢相瞒，那芭蕉洞虽是僻静，却清幽自在。我山妻自幼修持，也是个得道的女仙，却是家门严谨，内无一尺之童，焉得有雷公嘴的男子央来，这想是那里来的怪妖，或者假绰名声，至此访我，等我出去看看。”好魔王，拽开步，出了书房，上大厅取了披挂，结束了，拿了一条混铁棍，出门高叫道：“是谁人在我这里无状？”行者在旁，见他那模样，与五百年前又大不同，只见；头上戴一顶水磨银亮熟铁盔，身上贯一副绒穿锦绣黄金甲，足下踏一双卷尖粉底麂皮靴，腰间束一条攒丝三股狮蛮带。一双眼光如明镜，两道眉艳似红霓。口若血盆，齿排铜板。吼声响震山神怕，行动威风恶鬼慌。</p>

<p>四海有名称混世，西方大力号魔王。这大圣整衣上前，深深的唱个大喏道：“长兄，还认得小弟么？”牛王答礼道：“你是齐天大圣孙悟空么？”大圣道：“正是，正是，一向久别未拜。适才到此问一女子，方得见兄，丰采果胜常，真可贺也！”牛王喝道：</p>

<p>“且休巧舌！我闻你闹了天宫，被佛祖降压在五行山下，近解脱天灾，保护唐僧西天见佛求经，怎么在号山枯松涧火云洞把我小儿牛圣婴害了？正在这里恼你，你却怎么又来寻我？”大圣作礼道：“长兄勿得误怪小弟。当时令郎捉住吾师，要食其肉，小弟近他不得，幸观音菩萨欲救我师，劝他归正。现今做了善财童子，比兄长还高，享极乐之门堂，受逍遥之永寿，有何不可，返怪我耶？”牛王骂道：“这个乖嘴的猢狲！害子之情，被你说过，你才欺我爱妾，打上我门何也？”大圣笑道：“我因拜谒长兄不见，向那女子拜问，不知就是二嫂嫂；因他骂了我几句，是小弟一时粗卤，惊了嫂嫂。望长兄宽恕宽恕！”牛王道：“既如此说，我看故旧之情，饶你去罢。”大圣道：“既蒙宽恩，感谢不尽，但尚有一事奉渎，万望周济周济。”牛王骂道：“这猢狲不识起倒！饶了你，倒还不走，反来缠我！甚么周济周济！”大圣道：</p>

<p>“实不瞒长兄，小弟因保唐僧西进，路阻火焰山，不能前进。询问土人，知尊嫂罗刹女有一柄芭蒲扇，欲求一用。昨到旧府，奉拜嫂嫂，嫂嫂坚执不借，是以特求长兄。望兄长开天地之心，同小弟到大嫂处一行，千万借扇扇灭火焰，保得唐僧过山，即时完璧。”牛王闻言，心如火发，咬响钢牙骂道：“你说你不无礼，你原来是借扇之故！一定先欺我山妻，山妻想是不肯，故来寻我！且又赶我爱妾！常言道，朋友妻，不可欺；朋友妾，不可灭。</p>

<p>你既欺我妻，又灭我妾，多大无礼？上来吃我一棍！”大圣道：</p>

<p>“哥要说打，弟也不惧，但求宝贝，是我真心，万乞借我使使！”</p>

<p>牛王道：“你若三合敌得我，我着山妻借你；如敌不过，打死你，与我雪恨！”大圣道：“哥说得是，小弟这一向疏懒，不曾与兄相会，不知这几年武艺比昔日如何，我兄弟们请演演棍看。”这牛王那容分说，掣混铁棍劈头就打。这大圣持金箍棒，随手相迎。</p>

<p>两个这场好斗：金箍棒，混铁棍，变脸不以朋友论。那个说：“正怪你这猢狲害子情！”这个说：“你令郎已得道休嗔恨！”那个说：“你无知怎敢上我门？”这个说：“我有因特地来相问。”一个要求扇子保唐僧，一个不借芭蕉忒鄙吝。语去言来失旧情，举家无义皆生忿。牛王棍起赛蛟龙，大圣棒迎神鬼遁。初时争斗在山前，后来齐驾祥云进。半空之内显神通，五彩光中施妙运。</p>

<p>两条棍响振天关，不见输赢皆傍寸。这大圣与那牛王斗经百十回合，不分胜负。正在难解难分之际，只听得山峰上有人叫道：</p>

<p>“牛爷爷，我大王多多拜上，幸赐早临，好安座也。”牛王闻说，使混铁棍支住金箍棒，叫道：“猢狲，你且住了，等我去一个朋友家赴会来者！”言毕，按下云头，径至洞里。对玉面公主道：</p>

<p>“美人，才那雷公嘴的男子乃孙悟空猢狲，被我一顿棍打走了，再不敢来，你放心耍子。我到一个朋友处吃酒去也。”他才卸了盔甲，穿一领鸦青剪绒袄子，走出门，跨上辟水金睛兽，着小的们看守门庭，半云半雾，一直向西北方而去。</p>

<p>大圣在高峰上看着，心中暗想道：“这老牛不知又结识了甚么朋友，往那里去赴会，等老孙跟他走走。”好行者，将身幌一幌，变作一阵清风赶上，随着同走。不多时，到了一座山中，那牛王寂然不见。大圣聚了原身，入山寻看，那山中有一面清水深潭，潭边有一座石碣，碣上有六个大字，乃乱石山碧波潭。</p>

<p>大圣暗想道：“老牛断然下水去了。水底之精，若不是蛟精，必是龙精鱼精，或是龟鳖鼋鼍之精，等老孙也下去看看。</p>

<p>好大圣，捻着诀，念个咒语，摇身一变，变作一个螃蟹，不大不小的，有三十六斤重，扑的跳在水中，径沉潭底。忽见一座玲珑剔透的牌楼，楼下拴着那个辟水金睛兽，进牌楼里面，却就没水。大圣爬进去，仔细看时，只见那壁厢一派音乐之声，但见：朱宫贝阙，与世不殊。黄金为屋瓦，白玉作门枢。屏开玳瑁甲，槛砌珊瑚珠。祥云瑞蔼辉莲座，上接三光下八衢。非是天宫并海藏，果然此处赛蓬壶。高堂设宴罗宾主，大小官员冠冕珠。忙呼玉女捧牙槃，催唤仙娥调律吕。长鲸鸣，巨蟹舞，鳖吹笙，鼍击鼓，骊颔之珠照樽俎。鸟篆之文列翠屏，虾须之帘挂廊庑。八音迭奏杂仙韶，宫商响彻遏云霄。青头鲈妓抚瑶瑟，红眼马郎品玉箫。鳜婆顶献香獐脯，龙女头簪金凤翘。吃的是，天厨八宝珍羞味；饮的是，紫府琼浆熟酝醪。那上面坐的是牛魔王，左右有三四个蛟精，前面坐着一个老龙精，两边乃龙子龙孙龙婆龙女。正在那里觥筹交错之际，孙大圣一直走将上去，被老龙看见，即命：“拿下那个野蟹来！”龙子龙孙一拥上前，把大圣拿住。大圣忽作人言，只叫：“饶命！饶命！”老龙道：</p>

<p>“你是那里来的野蟹？怎么敢上厅堂，在尊客之前，横行乱走？</p>

<p>快早供来，免汝死罪！”好大圣，假捏虚言，对众供道：“生自湖中为活，傍崖作窟权居。盖因日久得身舒，官受横行介士。踏草拖泥落索，从来未习行仪。不知法度冒王威，伏望尊慈恕罪！”座上众精闻言，都拱身对老龙作礼道：“蟹介士初入瑶宫，不知王礼，望尊公饶他去罢。”老龙称谢了。众精即教：“放了那厮，且记打，外面伺候。”大圣应了一声，往外逃命，径至牌楼之下，心中暗想道：“这牛王在此贪杯，那里等得他散？就是散了，也不肯借扇与我。不如偷了他的金睛兽，变做牛魔王，去哄那罗刹女，骗他扇子，送我师父过山为妙。”</p>

<p>好大圣，即现本象，将金睛兽解了缰绳，扑一把跨上雕鞍，径直骑出水底。到于潭外，将身变作牛王模样，打着兽，纵着云，不多时，已至翠云山芭蕉洞口，叫声“开门！”那洞门里有两个女童，闻得声音开了门，看见是牛魔王嘴脸，即入报：“奶奶，爷爷来家了。”那罗刹听言，忙整云鬟，急移莲步，出门迎接。这大圣下雕鞍，牵进金睛兽；弄大胆，诓骗女佳人。罗刹女肉眼，认他不出，即携手而入。着丫鬟设座看茶，一家子见是主公，无不敬谨。须臾间，叙及寒温。“牛王”道：“夫人久阔。”罗刹道：</p>

<p>“大王万福。”又云：“大王宠幸新婚，抛撇奴家，今日是那阵风儿吹你来的？’大圣笑道：“非敢抛撇，只因玉面公主招后，家事繁冗，朋友多顾，是以稽留在外，却也又治得一个家当了。”又道：“近闻悟空那厮保唐僧，将近火焰山界，恐他来问你借扇子。我恨那厮害子之仇未报，但来时，可差人报我，等我拿他，分尸万段，以雪我夫妻之恨。”罗刹闻言，滴泪告道：“大王，常言说，男儿无妇财无主，女子无夫身无主。我的性命，险些儿不着这猢狲害了！”大圣听得，故意发怒骂道：“那泼猴几时过去了？”罗刹道：“还未去，昨日到我这里借扇子，我因他害孩儿之故，披挂了轮宝剑出门，就砍那猢狲。他忍着疼，叫我做嫂嫂，说大王曾与他结义。”大圣道：“是五百年前曾拜为七兄弟。”罗刹道：“被我骂也不敢回言，砍也不敢动手，后被我一扇子扇去；不知在那里寻得个定风法儿，今早又在门外叫唤。是我又使扇扇，莫想得动。急轮剑砍时，他就不让我了。我怕他棒重，就走入洞里，紧关上门。不知他又从何处，钻在我肚腹之内，险被他害了性命！是我叫他几声叔叔，将扇与他去也。”大圣又假意捶胸道：“可惜可惜！夫人错了，怎么就把这宝贝与那猢狲？</p>

<p>恼杀我也！”罗刹笑道：“大王息怒。与他的是假扇，但哄他去了。”大圣问：“真扇在于何处？”罗刹道：“放心放心！我收着哩。”叫丫鬟整酒接风贺喜，遂擎杯奉上道：“大王，燕尔新婚，千万莫忘结发，且吃一杯乡中之水。”大圣不敢不接，只得笑吟吟，举觞在手道：“夫人先饱，我因图治外产，久别夫人，早晚蒙护守家门，权为酬谢。”罗刹复接杯斟起，递与大王道：“自古道，妻者齐也，夫乃养身之父，讲甚么谢。”两人谦谦讲讲，方才坐下巡酒。大圣不敢破荤，只吃几个果子，与他言言语语。</p>

<p>酒至数巡，罗刹觉有半酣，色情微动，就和孙大圣挨挨擦擦，搭搭拈拈，携着手，俏语温存，并着肩，低声俯就。将一杯酒，你喝一口，我喝一口，却又哺果。大圣假意虚情，相陪相笑，没奈何，也与他相倚相偎。果然是：钓诗钩，扫愁帚，破除万事无过酒。男儿立节放襟怀，女子忘情开笑口。面赤似夭桃，身摇如嫩柳。絮絮叨叨话语多，捻捻掐掐风情有。时见掠云鬟，又见轮尖手。几番常把脚儿跷，数次每将衣袖抖。粉项自然低，蛮腰渐觉扭。合欢言语不曾丢，酥胸半露松金钮。醉来真个玉山颓，饧眼摩娑几弄丑。大圣见他这等酣然，暗自留心，挑斗道：“夫人，真扇子你收在那里？早晚仔细。但恐孙行者变化多端，却又来骗去。”罗刹笑嘻嘻的，口中吐出，只有一个杏叶儿大小，递与大圣道：“这个不是宝贝？”大圣接在手中，却又不信，暗想着：“这些些儿，怎生扇得火灭？怕又是假的。”罗刹见他看着宝贝沉思，忍不住上前，将粉面揾在行者脸上，叫道：</p>

<p>“亲亲，你收了宝贝吃酒罢，只管出神想甚么哩？”大圣就趁脚儿跷问他一句道：“这般小小之物，如何扇得八百里火焰？”罗刹酒陶真性，无忌惮，就说出方法道：“大王，与你别了二载，你想是昼夜贪欢，被那玉面公主弄伤了神思，怎么自家的宝贝事情，也都忘了？只将左手大指头捻着那柄儿上第七缕红丝，念一声哃嘘呵吸嘻吹呼，即长一丈二尺长短。这宝贝变化无穷！</p>

<p>那怕他八万里火焰，可一扇而消也。”大圣闻言，切切记在心上，却把扇儿也噙在口里，把脸抹一抹，现了本象，厉声高叫道：“罗刹女！你看看我可是你亲老公！就把我缠了这许多丑勾当！不羞！不羞！”那女子一见是孙行者，慌得推倒桌席，跌落尘埃，羞愧无比，只叫“气杀我也！气杀我也！”</p>

<p>这大圣，不管他死活，捽脱手，拽大步，径出了芭蕉洞，正是无心贪美色，得意笑颜回。将身一纵，踏祥云，跳上高山，将扇子吐出来，演演方法。将左手大指头捻着那柄上第七缕红丝，念了一声哃嘘呵吸嘻吹呼，果然长了有一丈二尺长短。拿在手中，仔细看了又看，比前番假的果是不同，只见祥光幌幌，瑞气纷纷，上有三十六缕红丝，穿经度络，表里相联。原来行者只讨了个长的方法，不曾讨他个小的口诀，左右只是那等长短。没奈何，只得搴在肩上，找旧路而回不题。</p>

<p>却说那牛魔王在碧波潭底与众精散了筵席，出得门来，不见了辟水金睛兽。老龙王聚众精问道：“是谁偷放牛爷的金睛兽也？”众精跪下道：“没人敢偷，我等俱在筵前供酒捧盘，供唱奏乐，更无一人在前。”老龙道：“家乐儿断乎不敢，可曾有甚生人进来？”龙子龙孙道：“适才安座之时，有个蟹精到此，那个便是生人。”牛王闻说，顿然省悟道：“不消讲了！早间贤友着人邀我时，有个孙悟空保唐僧取经，路遇火焰山难过，曾问我求借芭蕉扇。我不曾与他，他和我赌斗一场，未分胜负，我却丢了他，径赴盛会。那猴子千般伶俐，万样机关，断乎是那厮变作蟹精，来此打探消息，偷了我兽，去山妻处骗了那一把芭蕉扇儿也！”众精见说，一个个胆战心惊，问道：“可是那大闹天宫的孙悟空么？”牛王道：“正是。列公若在西天路上，有不是处，切要躲避他些儿。”老龙道：“似这般说，大王的骏骑，却如之何？”牛王笑道：“不妨，不妨，列公各散，等我赶他去来。”遂而分开水路，跳出潭底，驾黄云，径至翠云山芭蕉洞，只听得罗刹女跌脚捶胸，大呼小叫，推开门，又见辟水金睛兽拴在下边，牛王高叫：“夫人，孙悟空那厢去了？”众女童看见牛魔，一齐跪下道：</p>

<p>“爷爷来了？”罗刹女扯住牛王，磕头撞脑，口里骂道：“泼老天杀的！怎样这般不谨慎，着那猢狲偷了金睛兽，变作你的模样，到此骗我！”牛王切齿道：“猢狲那厢去了？”罗刹捶着胸膛骂道：“那泼猴赚了我的宝贝，现出原身走了！气杀我也！”牛王道：“夫人保重，勿得心焦，等我赶上猢狲，夺了宝贝，剥了他皮，铿碎他骨，摆出他的心肝，与你出气！”叫：“拿兵器来！”女童道：“爷爷的兵器，不在这里。”牛王道：“拿你奶奶的兵器来罢！”侍婢将两把青锋宝剑捧出。牛王脱了那赴宴的鸦青绒袄，束一束贴身的小衣，双手绰剑，走出芭蕉洞，径奔火焰山上赶来。正是那：忘恩汉，骗了痴心妇；烈性魔，来近木叉人。毕竟不知此去吉凶如何，且听下回分解。
