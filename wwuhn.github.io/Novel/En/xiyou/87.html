<P>The Mother of Wood Lends His Might in Defeating the Ogre</P>
<P>The Metal Lord Uses His Magic to Wipe Out the Monster</P>
</div>
<P>The story tells how the Great Sage Monkey was leading the horse and carrying the baggage while he searched the whole mountain top, calling out for his master. Suddenly Pig came running up to him, puffing and panting, to ask, &#8220;Why are you shouting like that, brother?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The master's disappeared,&#8221; Brother Monkey replied. &#8220;Have you seen him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why did you have to play that trick on me when I was being a good monk with the Tang Priest?&#8221; Pig asked. &#8220;What was all that about me being commander of the vanguard? I had to fight for my life before I could beat that evil spirit and come back in one piece. You and Friar Sand were looking after the master, so why ask me about it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I don't blame you, brother,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Somehow or other your eyes must have gone blurred&#8212;you let the evil spirit get away and come back to catch the master again. When I went off to fight it I told Friar Sand to look after the master, and he's disappeared too.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I expect he's taken the master somewhere for a crap,&#8221; said Pig with a grin, but before he had finished speaking Friar Sand turned up.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where's the master, Friar Sand?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;You two must both be blind,&#8221; retorted Friar Sand, &#8220;letting the evil spirit escape to come back for the master. When I went to fight the evil spirit the master was left in the horse by himself.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this Monkey leapt with rage, shouting, &#8220;He's fooled me! He's fooled me!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How's he fooled you?&#8221; Friar Sand asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;It was a 'dividing the petals of the plum blossom' trick,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;to draw us three off so that he could make a blow for the heart and carry off the master. Whatever in the name of Heaven are we to do?&#8221;</P>
<P>He could not stop the tears from streaming down his cheeks, at which Pig said, &#8220;Don't cry. If you cry you're a pustule. He can't be far away. He must be on this mountain. Let's look for him.&#8221; The three of them had no better plan than to look for him on the mountain. When they had covered some six or seven miles they saw a cave palace at the foot of a beetling precipice:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Clean-cut pinnacles blocking the light,</P>
<P>Towering and grotesque-shaped rocks.</P>
<P>The fragrance of rate and wonderful flowers,</P>
<P>The beauty of red apricots and green peaches.</P>
<P>The ancient trees in front of the precipice,</P>
<P>Forty spans round, and with bark scarred by frost and rain;</P>
<P>The azure pines standing outside the gates,</P>
<P>Two thousand feet of green blue reaching up to the sky.</P>
<P>Pairs of wild cranes</P>
<P>That dance in the breeze at the mouth of the cave;</P>
<P>Mountain birds in couples</P>
<P>Chirping by day at the ends of the branches.</P>
<P>Clumps of yellow creepers like ropes,</P>
<P>Rows of misty willows with leaves like hanging gold.</P>
<P>Water fills the pools that are square;</P>
<P>All over the mountain are caves that are deep.</P>
<P>In the pools that are square</P>
<P>Dragons lie hidden with scales unchanged.</P>
<P>In the mountain's deep caves</P>
<P>Dwell ogres that long have been eaters of humans.</P>
<P>This can be matched with the lands of immortals,</P>
<P>A den where the winds and the vapors are stored.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Monkey saw this he took two or three paces forward, sprang towards the gates and saw that they were shut tight. Above them was a horizontal stone tablet on which was written in large letters</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>LINKED RING CAVE:</P>
<P>BROKEN RIDGE:</P>
<P>HIDDEN MISTS MOUNTAIN.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Strike, Pig,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;This is where the evil spirit lives. The master must be here.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this the idiot turned vicious, raised his rake, and brought it down on the gates with all his strength, smashing a big hole in them and shouting, &#8220;Ogre, send my master out at once if you don't want me to smash your gates down and finish the lot of you off.&#8221; At this the junior devils on the gates rushed back inside to report, &#8220;Disaster, Your Majesty.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What disaster?&#8221; the senior demon asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Someone's smashed a hole in the front gates and is yelling that he wants his master,&#8221; the junior devils replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;I wonder which one's come looking for him,&#8221; said the demon king in a state of great alarm.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be frightened,&#8221; said the commander of the vanguard. &#8220;Let me go out and take a look.&#8221; He hurried straight to the front gates, twisted his head to one side and craned to look through the hole that had been smashed in them. He saw someone with a long snout and big ears.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry, Your Majesty,&#8221; he turned round and shouted at the top of his voice, &#8220;it's Zhu Bajie. He's not up to much and he won't dare try any nonsense on us. If he does we can open the gates and drag him inside to put in the steamer too. The only one to worry about is that hairy-cheeked monk with a face like a thunder god.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig when he heard this from outside, &#8220;he's not scared of me but he is of you. The master's definitely inside. Come here quick.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Evil damned beast,&#8221; said Monkey abusively. &#8220;Your grandfather Monkey is here. Send my master out and I'll spare your life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is terrible, Your Majesty,&#8221; the commander of the vanguard reported. &#8220;Sun the Novice is here looking for him too.&#8221; At this the demon king started complaining, &#8220;It's all because of your 'petal-dividing' or whatever you called it. You've brought disaster on us. How is this going to end?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry, Your Majesty,&#8221; the commander of the vanguard replied, &#8220;and don't start grumbling yet. That Sun the Novice is a monkey of great breadth of spirit. Although he has such tremendous magical power he's partial to flattery. We'll take an imitation human head out to fool him with, say a few flattering things to him and tell him we've eaten his master already. If we can take him in, the Tang Priest will be ours to enjoy. If we can't we'll have to think again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But where are we to get an imitation human head?&#8221; the demon king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll see if I can make one,&#8221; the commander of the vanguard replied.</P>
<P>The splendid ogre then cut a piece of willow root with an axe of pure steel into the shape of a human head, spurted some human blood on it from his mouth to make it all sticky, and told a junior devil to take it to the gates on a lacquer tray, calling, &#8220;My Lord Great Sage, please overcome your anger and allow me to address you.&#8221;</P>
<P>Brother Monkey really was partial to being flattered, and when he heard himself being addressed as &#8220;My Lord Great Sage&#8221; he grabbed hold of Pig and said, &#8220;Don't hit him. Let's hear what he has to say.&#8221;</P>
<P>To this the junior devil with the tray replied, &#8220;When my king took your master into the cave the junior devils were naughty and behaved very badly. They gobbled and gnawed and grabbed and bit, and ate the whole of your master up except his head, which I have here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you've eaten him up, that's that,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Bring the head out and let me see whether it's real or false.&#8221; The junior devil threw the head out through the hole in the gates, a sight that started Pig howling and saying, &#8220;This is terrible. The master went in looking one way and he's come out looking like this.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Idiot,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;have a look and find out if it's real before you start crying.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're shameless,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;how could there ever be such a thing as a fake human head?&#8221;</P>
<P>'This one's a fake,&#8221; Brother Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you tell?&#8221; Pig asked. &#8220;When you throw a real human head it lands quietly,&#8221; Monkey explained, &#8220;but when you throw a fake it makes a loud noise like a pair of wooden clappers. If you don't believe me, I'll throw it for you. Listen!&#8221; He picked the head up and threw it against a rock, where it gave a hollow ring.</P>
<P>&#8220;It was loud, brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand.</P>
<P>&#8220;That means it's a fake,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'll make it turn back into its real self to show you.&#8221; Producing his gold-banded cudgel in a flash he hit the head open. When Pig looked he saw that it was a piece of willow root. This was too much for the idiot, who started talking abusively.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll get you, you hairy lot,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you may have hidden my master in your cave and fooled your ancestor Pig with a piece of willow root, but don't imagine that my master is just a willow-tree spirit in disguise.&#8221;</P>
<P>The junior devil who was holding the tray was thrown into such a panic by this that he ran shaking with fear back to report, &#8220;It's terrible, terrible, terrible.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What's so terribly terrible then?' the senior demon asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Zhu Bajie and Friar Sand were taken in, but Monkey's like an antique dealer&#8212;he really knows his stuff,&#8221; the junior demon replied. &#8220;He could tell it was an imitation head. If only we could give him a real human head he might go away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But how are we to get one?&#8221; the senior demon wondered, then continued, &#8220;Fetch a human head we haven't eaten yet from the flaying shed.&#8221; The devils then went to the shed and choose a fresh head, after which they gnawed all the skin off it till it was quite smooth and carried it out on a tray.</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord Great Sage,&#8221; the messenger said, &#8220;I am afraid it was a fake head last time. But this really is Lord Tang's head. Our king had kept it so as to bring good fortune to our cave, but now he's making a special offering of it.&#8221; He then threw the head out through the hole in the gates, it landed with a thud and rolled on the ground, gory with blood.</P>
<P>Seeing that this human head was a real one Monkey could not help starting to wail, in which he was joined by Pig and Friar Sand.</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop crying, brother,&#8221; said Pig, holding back his tears. &#8220;This is very hot weather, and the head will soon become putrid. I'm going to fetch and bury it while it's still fresh. We can cry for him afterwards.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right,&#8221; said Monkey, and the idiot cradled the head against his chest, not caring about the filth, as he hurried up the cliff till he found a South-facing spot where the winds and the natural forces were gathered. Here he hacked out a hole with his rake, buried the head, and piled a grave-mound over it. Only then did he say to Friar Sand, &#8220;You and big brother weep over him while I look for some offerings.&#8221;</P>
<P>Going down to the side of a gill, he broke off some willow branches and gathered a few pebbles. Taking them back up to the tomb, he planted the willow branches on either side and piled the pebbles in front of it. &#8220;What's all that about?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The willow branches are used instead of cypresses to shade the master's tomb for the time being,&#8221; Pig answered, &#8220;and the pebbles are offerings to him instead of cakes.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Cretin!&#8221; Monkey shouted. &#8220;He's already dead. What do you want to go offering him stones for?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Just to show what the living feel,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;and out of mourning and respect.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You'd better cut that nonsense out,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Tell Friar Sand to come here. He can guard the tomb and keep an eye on the horse and the luggage while we two go and smash the cave palace up, capture the monster and break his body into ten thousand bits. Then we'll have avenged the master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're absolutely right, big brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand through his tears. &#8220;You two be careful. I'll keep watch here.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Pig then took off his black brocade tunic, tied his undershirt tightly, picked up his rake and followed Monkey. The two of them rushed straight for the stone gates, and with no more ado they smashed them down and shouted with a yell that made the heavens shake, &#8220;Give us our Tang Priest back alive!&#8221; This sent the souls flying from all the devils old and young in the cave, who complained that the commander of the vanguard had wronged them. &#8220;How are we going to deal with these monks now they've fought their way in through the gates?&#8221; the demon king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The ancients used to say,&#8221; the commander of the vanguard replied, &#8220;'Put your hand in a basket of fish and it's bound to stink.' Now we're in this we've got to see it through. We'll just have to take our troops into battle with these monks.&#8221; When the demon heard this he had no alternative but to issue the order, &#8220;Stand together, my little ones. Bring your best weapons with you and come with me.&#8221; They then charged out through the entrance of the cave with a great war cry.</P>
<P>The Great Sage and Pig quickly fell back a few paces before they held the devilish onslaught on a piece of flat ground on the mountainside, shouting, &#8220;Who's your best-known boss? Who's the ogre who captured our master?&#8221;</P>
<P>The devils had now palisaded their position, over which a multicolored embroidered flag flew, and the demon king shouted straight back as he held the iron mace, &#8220;Damned monks! Don't you know who I am? I'm the Great King of the Southern Mountains, and I've been running wild here for hundreds of years. I've eaten your Tang Priest up. What are you going to do about it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've got a nerve, you hairy beast,&#8221; retorted Monkey abusively. &#8220;How old are you, daring to call yourself after the Southern Mountains? Lord Lao Zi was the ancestor who opened up heaven and earth, but even he sits on the right of the Supreme Pure One. The Tathagata Buddha is the Honoured One who rules the world, and he sits below the Great Roc. Confucius the Sage is the Honoured One of the Confucian School, and all he's called is Master. So how dare you call yourself Great King of the Southern Mountains and talk about running wild for several hundred years? Don't move, and take this from your grandfather's cudgel!&#8221;</P>
<P>The evil spirit twisted aside to avoid the cudgel, which he parried with his iron mace. &#8220;How dare you try to put me down like that, monkey-face,&#8221; said the monster, glaring furiously. &#8220;What kind of powers have you got, acting like a maniac at my gates.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll get you, you nameless beast,&#8221; replied Brother Monkey with a grin. &#8220;You evidently don't know who I am, so just stand there and make yourself brave while I tell you:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>My ancestral home is in the Eastern Continent,</P>
<P>Where heaven and earth nourished me for thousands of years.</P>
<P>On the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit was a magic stone egg;</P>
<P>When the egg broke open my roots were inside.</P>
<P>My birth was not like that of an ordinary being:</P>
<P>My body was formed when sun and moon mated.</P>
<P>1 cultivated myself with formidable effect;</P>
<P>Heaven gave me a perceptive and cinnabar head.</P>
<P>As the Great Sage I dwelt in the palace in the clouds,</P>
<P>Using my strength in a fight against the Dipper and Bull Palace.</P>
<P>A hundred thousand heavenly troops could get nowhere near me;</P>
<P>All the stars in the sky were easily subdued.</P>
<P>My fame resounds throughout the cosmos;</P>
<P>I know all about everything between earth and sky.</P>
<P>Since my conversion to Sakyamuni's teachings</P>
<P>1 have been helping my master on his journey to the West.</P>
<P>When I clear a path through mountains no one can stop me;</P>
<P>My skill at bridging rivers causes demons distress.</P>
<P>In forests I use my power to seize tigers and leopards;</P>
<P>I capture wild beasts bare-handed before sheer cliffs.</P>
<P>For the sake of the East's true achievement I have come to the Western Regions;</P>
<P>What evil monster will dare to show itself?</P>
<P>I hate the wicked beasts who have murdered my master;</P>
<P>Their lives will all be ended at this moment.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>These remarks both shocked and infuriated the ogre, who ground his teeth, sprang forward and struck at Brother Monkey with his iron mace. Monkey blocked it effortlessly with his cudgel and would have said some more to him when Pig, unable to restrain himself any longer, started swinging wildly at the demon king's commander of the vanguard. The commander of the vanguard led his whole force into action, and a hectic and splendid battle was fought on that piece of level ground on the mountainside:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The monk from the great and superior country in the East</P>
<P>Was going to fetch true scriptures from the Western Paradise.</P>
<P>The great leopard of the Southern mountains breathed out wind and clouds</P>
<P>To block their way through the mountains and show off his prowess.</P>
<P>With tricks</P>
<P>And deception</P>
<P>He had foolishly captured the priest from Great Tang.</P>
<P>Then he met Monkey with his tremendous powers</P>
<P>As well as the famous Zhu Bajie.</P>
<P>While the demons fought on level ground in the mountains</P>
<P>Dust clouds arose and darkened the sky.</P>
<P>Above the fray rose the junior devils' roars</P>
<P>As they thrust out wildly with spear and with sword.</P>
<P>On the other side the monks shouted back,</P>
<P>Fighting with rake and with cudgel together.</P>
<P>The Great Sage was a matchless hero,</P>
<P>And Pig in his perfection reveled in his strength.</P>
<P>The ancient ogre of the South,</P>
<P>And his vanguard commander</P>
<P>For the sake of a piece of the Tang Priest's flesh</P>
<P>Were prepared to throw their own lives away.</P>
<P>These two hated them for killing their master:</P>
<P>The other two were set on murder because of the Tang Priest.</P>
<P>The struggle long swayed to and fro,</P>
<P>The clashes and charges yielding no victor.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Monkey realized that the junior devils were fighting so hard that repeated attacks were failing to drive them back he used body-dividing magic, plucked out a bunch of hairs, chewed them up in his mouth, spat the pieces out, called &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned them all into his own doubles, each wielding a gold-banded cudgel and fighting his way into the cave from the outside. The one or two hundred junior devils, unable to cope with their attacks from all sides, all fled for their lives back into the cave. Monkey and Pig then fought their way back out through the enemy ranks from the inside. The evil spirits who had no sense tried to stand up to the rake and found themselves bleeding from nine wounds, or resisted the cudgel and had their flesh and bones beaten to paste. The Great King of the Southern Mountains was so alarmed that he fled for his life on his clouds and wind. The commander of the vanguard, who did not know how to do transformations, had already fallen to Monkey's club and been revealed as what he really was: an iron-backed gray wolf ogre.</P>
<P>Pig went up to him, turned him over by his leg, and said, &#8220;Goodness only knows how many piglets and lambs this so-and-so has eaten.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey meanwhile shook himself, put the hair back on his body and said, &#8220;No time to lose, idiot. After the demon king! Make him pay for the master's life.&#8221; Pig turned back, but all the little Monkeys had disappeared.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your magic bodies have all gone, brother,&#8221; he exclaimed.</P>
<P>&#8220;I've taken them back,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Splendid,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;splendid.&#8221; The two of them went back in triumph, feeling very pleased.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the senior demon escaped back to the cave he told his underlings to move rocks and earth to barricade the front gates. The surviving junior demons were all trembling with terror as they barricaded the entrance: they would not have dared to stick their heads out again now. Monkey led Pig to the gates and shouted without getting any response. Pig's rake made no impression when he struck them with it.</P>
<P>Realizing what had happened, Monkey said, &#8220;Don't waste your effort, Pig. They've barricaded the gates.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Then how are we going to avenge the master?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Let's go back to his grave and see Friar Sand,&#8221; Brother Monkey replied.</P>
<P>When they got back there they found Friar Sand still weeping, at which Pig became more miserable than ever, throwing down his rake, prostrating himself on the tomb mound and beating the ground with his hand as he howled, &#8220;Poor, poor Master. Master from so far away! I'll never see you again!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't distress yourself so, brother,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;The evil spirit may have barricaded his front gates, but he's bound to have a back entrance to go in and out through. You two wait here while I go and look for it.</P>
<P>&#8220;Do be careful, brother,&#8221; said Pig through his tears. &#8220;Don't get caught yourself too. We could never cope if we had to wail for the master then for you by turns. We'd make an awful mess of it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No problem,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I've got my ways of doing things.&#8221;</P>
<P>Putting his cudgel away the splendid Great Sage tightened his kilt, stepped out and went back over the mountain. On his way he heard the sound of flowing water. When he turned round to look he saw that there was a brook flowing down from above him, and beside the gill was a gate, to the left of which was a drainpipe from which red water was coming out.</P>
<P>&#8220;Goes without saying,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;That must be the back entrance. If I go as myself the junior demons may well recognize me when I open the door and see them. I'd better turn into a water snake to go in. No, hold on. If the master's spirit knows that I've turned into a water snake he'll be angry with me as a monk for turning into something so long drawn-out. I'd better turn into a little crab. No, that's no good either. The master would be cross with me for having too many legs for a monk.&#8221; So he turned into a water rat who slipped into the water with a soughing sound and went straight to the inner courtyard along the drainpipe. Here he thrust his head out for a look around and saw some junior devils setting out gobbets of human flesh to dry in a sunny spot.</P>
<P>&#8220;Heavens!&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;That must be what they can't finish from the master's flesh. No doubt they're drying it to save for a rainy day. If I turned back into myself now, went up to them and wiped them out with one swing of my cudgel I'd be making myself look brave but stupid. I'll do another change, go in to look for the senior devil, and find out what's what.&#8221; With that he jumped out of the drain, shook himself, and turned himself into a winged ant. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Weak and tiny and known as black colts,</P>
<P>They hide away for many a day till they have wings and can fly.</P>
<P>Casually crossing beside the bridge they draw up their ranks;</P>
<P>They enjoy battles of high strategy under the bed.</P>
<P>Because they know when rain is coming they block their holes</P>
<P>And build their mounds of dust that turn to ashes.</P>
<P>Light they are, and delicate and quick,</P>
<P>Rarely observed as they pass the wicker gate.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He spread his wings and flew straight into the inner hall, unseen and unheard. Here the senior demon could be seen sitting very angrily in the seat of honour, while a junior devil ran up from behind to report, &#8220;Many congratulations, Your Majesty.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What on?&#8221; the senior demon asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I was on lookout by the gill outside the back door just now,&#8221; the junior devil replied, &#8220;when suddenly I heard some loud wails. I rushed up to the top of the mountain to take a look and saw Zhu Bajie, Sun the Novice and Friar Sand all bowing to a grave and weeping bitterly. I think they must have taken that head for the Tang Priest's and buried it, piled up a grave mound and mourned for it.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey overheard this he said to himself with delight, &#8220;From what he's said they've still got the master here and haven't eaten him yet. I'll take a look around and find out if he's still alive, then have a word with him.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage then flew into the main hall and looked all around until he saw a very tiny doorway on one side of it. It was very firmly shut, and when he squeezed through the narrow gap between the doors he found himself in a big garden in which he could vaguely make out the sound of sobbing. Flying further inside he saw a clump of tall trees at the foot of which were tied two men. One of these was the Tang Priest. As soon as Monkey saw him he felt an itch in his heart that he could not scratch.</P>
<P>He could not help turning back into himself, going up to Sanzang and calling, &#8220;Master.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the Tang Priest saw who it was he started crying and saying, &#8220;Is that you, Wukong? Save me as quickly as you can, Wukong.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't keep saying my name, Master,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;There are people at the front and the secret may get out. As you're still alive I can rescue you. The ogres said they'd already eaten you and tricked me with an imitation human head. Now we're in a bitter struggle with them. There's no need to worry, Master. Just stick it out for a little longer till I've beaten the evil spirit, then I'll be able to rescue you.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Great Sage said the words of a spell, shook himself, turned into an ant again and flew back into the hall, where he landed on the main beam. From here he saw the surviving junior devils jostling and shouting. One of them sprang out from the crowd and said, &#8220;Your Majesty, now they know we've blocked the main gate and they won't be able to fight their way in they've given up hope. They've even made a tomb for the wrong head. They spent today mourning for him, and they'll do the same again tomorrow and the day after. I'm sure they'll go away after that. Once we find out that they've split up we can bring the Tang Priest out, chop him up into little bits, and fry him with aniseed. Then everyone will be able to eat a piece when he's steaming hot, and we'll all live forever.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this another junior devil clapped his hands together and said, &#8220;No, no, he'd taste much better steamed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Boiling him would save some firewood,&#8221; another put in.</P>
<P>&#8220;He's such a rare and wonderful thing,&#8221; said someone else, &#8220;that we ought to salt him down and take our time over eating him.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard all this from up among the beams he thought with fury, &#8220;What harm did my master ever do you? Why are you making these plans to eat him?&#8221; He pulled out a handful of hairs, chewed them up into little pieces, blew them lightly out of his mouth and silently recited the words of the spell that turned all the pieces into sleep insects. These he threw into the faces of all the devils, and the insects crawled up their noses, gradually making the devils feel sleepy. Before long the junior devils were all lying stretched out fast asleep. The demon king was the only one left fitfully awake as he kept rubbing his face and head, sneezing and pinching his nose.</P>
<P>&#8220;Perhaps he knows about how to cope with sleep insects,&#8221; Monkey thought. &#8220;I'd better give him a double dose.&#8221; He pulled out a hair, made two more sleep insects as before, and threw them into the demon's face to crawl up his nose, one up the left nostril and one up the right. The demon king jumped to his feet, stretched, yawned twice and fell fast asleep, breathing heavily.</P>
<P>Quietly delighted, Monkey then sprang down from the roof and turned back into himself. He produced his cudgel from his ear and waved it till it was the thickness of a duck egg, then with a loud bang broke down the side door, ran into the garden at the back and called out, &#8220;Master!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Untie me quick, disciple,&#8221; the venerable elder said. &#8220;Being roped up like this has been agony.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Be patient, Master,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;When I've killed the evil spirit I'll come and untie you.&#8221; He then hurried back into the hall, lifted his cudgel and was about to strike when he stopped and thought, &#8220;No, this is wrong. I ought to release the master before I kill the evil spirit.&#8221; He went back into the garden, where he changed his mind again: &#8220;No, I'll kill the monster first.&#8221; This happened two or three times till finally he came dancing back into the garden, where his master's grief turned to joy at the sight of him.</P>
<P>&#8220;You monkey,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I suppose it's because you're beside yourself with pleasure at seeing me still alive that you're dancing about like that.&#8221; Only then did Monkey go up to him, untie him, and help him walk away. The man tied to the other tree then called out, &#8220;Please save me too in your great mercy, my lord.&#8221;</P>
<P>The venerable elder stopped and said, &#8220;Untie him too, Wukong.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Who's he?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;He was captured and brought here a day before me,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;He's a woodcutter. He tells me his mother is very old and he is most worried about her. He is a very dutiful son. You must save him too.&#8221;</P>
<P>Doing as he was bid, Monkey untied the other man and took them both out through the back gate, up the scar and across the ravine. &#8220;Thank you for rescuing this man and me, worthy disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;Where are Wuneng and Wujing?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Mourning for you over there,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;Give them a shout.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang then shouted at the top of his voice, &#8220;Bajie! Bajie!&#8221; The idiot, who had been weeping so much that his head was spinning, wiped away the snot and tears to call, &#8220;Friar Sand, the master's come back as a ghost. That him calling, isn't it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Idiot,&#8221; shouted Monkey, going up to him, &#8220;that's no ghost. It's the master himself.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Friar Sand looked up and saw who it was he fell to his knees in front of Sanzang and said &#8220;Master, you've suffered terribly. How did big brother rescue you?&#8221; Monkey then told them everything that had happened.</P>
<P>When Pig heard all this he gnashed his teeth, unable to restrain himself from knocking the tomb mound over with one blow of his rake, digging out the head and smashing it to pulp &#8220;Why are you hitting it?&#8221; the Tang Priest asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;goodness only knows what kind of wretch he was, but we all mourned for him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It was thanks to him that I'm still alive,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;When you disciples attacked their gates and demanded me they took him out to fob you off with. Otherwise they would have killed me. I think we should bury him properly as a mark of our monastic respect.&#8221; When the idiot heard his master saying this he buried that bag of flesh and bone that had been beaten to a pulp and piled up a tomb mound over it.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Brother Monkey with a smile, &#8220;won't you sit here for a while while I go to wipe them out?&#8221; With that he leapt down the cliff, crossed the ravine, went into the cave and took the ropes with which the Tang Priest and the woodcutter had been hound into the hall, where he used them to truss together the arms and legs of the demon king, who was still asleep. He then lifted the demon up with his cudgel onto his shoulder and took him out by the back door.</P>
<P>&#8220;You like making things difficult for yourself, brother,&#8221; said Pig when he saw him coming from a distance. &#8220;Why don't you find another to balance him?&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey then set the demon king down in front of Pig, who raised his rake and was just about to hit him when Monkey said, &#8220;Wait a moment. We haven't captured the junior devils in the cave yet.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If there are any left,&#8221; Pig said, &#8220;take me in with you to smash them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Smashing them would be too much trouble,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;The best thing would be to find some firewood and wipe them out that way.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the woodcutter heard this he led Pig to a hollow to the East to find some broken ends of bamboo, pines that had lost their needles, hollow stumps of willows, creepers broken off from their roots, withered artemisia, old reeds, rushes and dead mulberry. They carried a lot of this into the back entrance, where Monkey set it alight and Pig fanned the flames with both ears. Then the Great Sage sprang up, shook himself and put the sleep-insect hairs back on his body. When the junior devils woke up they were all already on fire. Poor things! None of them had the faintest chance of surviving. When the whole cave was burnt right out the disciples went back to see the master.</P>
<P>When Sanzang saw that the senior demon had woken up and was shouting he called, &#8220;Disciples, the evil spirit has come round.&#8221; Pig went up and killed him with one blow of his rake, whereupon the ogre turned back into his real form as a leopard spirit with a coat patterned like mugwort flowers.</P>
<P>&#8220;Leopards with flower-patterned coats can eat tigers,&#8221; Monkey observed, &#8220;and this one could turn into a human too. Killing him has prevented a lot of serious trouble in future.&#8221; The venerable elder could not express his gratitude strongly enough, and he then mounted the saddle. &#8220;My home isn't far from here to the Southwest, sirs,&#8221; said the woodcutter. &#8220;I invite you to come there to meet my mother and accept my kowtows of thanks for saving my life. Then I'll see you gentlemen along your way.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang was happy to accept, and instead of riding he walked there with his three disciples and the woodcutter. After they had followed a winding path to the Southwest for a short distance this is what they saw.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Lichen growing across a stone-flagged path,</P>
<P>Wisteria joining across the wicker gate,</P>
<P>Chains of mountains on every side, And a wood full of singing birds.</P>
<P>A dense thicket of pine and bamboo,</P>
<P>Rare and wonderful flowers in profusion.</P>
<P>The place is remote and deep amid the clouds,</P>
<P>A thatched cottage with a bamboo fence.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>While they were still some distance away they could make out an old woman leaning on the wicker gate with tears streaming from her eyes, weeping and calling to heaven and earth for her son.</P>
<P>As soon as the woodcutter saw his mother he left the Tang Priest behind as he rushed straight to the gate, knelt down and said, &#8220;Mother, I'm back.&#8221;</P>
<P>Throwing her arms around him the woman said, &#8220;My boy, when you didn't come home for days on end I thought the mountain lord must have caught you and killed you. I've suffered terrible heartache. If you weren't killed why didn't you come back before? Where are your carrying-pole, ropes and axe?&#8221;</P>
<P>The woodcutter kowtowed as he replied, &#8220;Mother, the mountain lord did capture me and tie me to a tree. I was lucky to escape with my life, thanks to these gentlemen. They are arhats sent by the Tang court in the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven. This gentleman was captured by the mountain lord and tied to a tree as well. His three disciples have enormous magic powers. They killed the mountain lord with a single blow: he was a leopard with mugwort flower spots who had become a spirit. They burnt all the junior devils to death, untied the senior gentleman and then untied me too. I owe them a tremendous debt of gratitude: but for them your son would certainly be dead. Now that the mountain is completely safe I'll be able to walk around at night without any danger.&#8221;</P>
<P>After hearing this the old woman came forward to greet Sanzang and his disciples, kowtowing at every step. Then she led them in through the wicker gate to sit down in the thatched cottage. Mother and son next performed endless kowtows as expressions of their gratitude before hastily and in a fluster preparing them some vegetarian food as a mark of their thanks.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig to the woodcutter, &#8220;I know you're hard up here. Just put something simple together for us. Don't go to a lot of trouble and effort.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Quite frankly, sir,&#8221; the woodcutter replied, &#8220;we're very poor here. We don't have any gill fungus, button mushrooms, peppers or aniseed. All we can offer you gentlemen are some wild vegetables.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We're putting you to a lot of trouble,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;Be as quick as you can. We're starving.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It'll soon be ready,&#8221; the woodcutter replied, and before long a table and stools were set out and wiped clean, and several dishes of wild vegetables served:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Tender-scalded day lilies,</P>
<P>White lumps of pickled scallion,</P>
<P>Knotweed and purslane,</P>
<P>Shepherds purse and &#8220;goosegut blossom.&#8221;</P>
<P>The &#8220;swallows stay away&#8221; was delicious and tender;</P>
<P>The tiny fists of beansprouts were crisp and green.</P>
<P>Indigo heads boiled soft,</P>
<P>White-stewed &#8220;dog footprints,&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Cat's ears,&#8221;</P>
<P>Wild turnips,</P>
<P>All with tender and tasty gray noodles.</P>
<P>&#8220;Scissor shafts,&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Oxpool aid,&#8221;</P>
<P>Tipped in the pot with broom purslane.</P>
<P>Broken grain purslane,</P>
<P>And lettuce purslane,</P>
<P>All green, delicious and smooth.</P>
<P>&#8220;Birdflower&#8221; fried in oil,</P>
<P>Superb water-chestnuts,</P>
<P>Roots of reeds and wild-rice stems,</P>
<P>Four kinds of excellent water plants.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wheat-mother,&#8221;</P>
<P>Delicate and finely flavored;</P>
<P>&#8220;Raggedy patches&#8221;</P>
<P>You could never wear.</P>
<P>Under the bitter sesame bed runs a fence.</P>
<P>Sparrows wander around,</P>
<P>Macaques leave their footprints,</P>
<P>Eager to eat it all when fried and piping hot.</P>
<P>Sloping wormwood and green artemisia surround crown daisy chrysanthemums;</P>
<P>The moths fly around the buckwheat.</P>
<P>Bald &#8220;goat's ear,&#8221;</P>
<P>Wolfberry fruits,</P>
<P>That don't need oil when combined with dark indigo.</P>
<P>A meal of every kind of wild vegetable</P>
<P>As a mark of the woodcutter's reverent thanks.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When master and disciples had eaten their fill they packed up ready to start out again. Not daring to press them to stay, the woodcutter asked his mother to come out and bow to them in thanks again. He then kowtowed, fetched a club of jujube wood, fastened his clothes tight, and came out to see them on their way.</P>
<P>Friar Sand led the horse, Pig carried the shoulder-pole, and Monkey followed close behind them while the master put his hands together on the back of the horse and said, &#8220;Brother woodcutter, could you kindly lead us to the main track? We will take out leave of you there.&#8221; Together they then climbed high, went down slopes, skirted ravines and negotiated inclines. &#8220;Disciples,&#8221; said the venerable elder thoughtfully as he rode,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Since leaving my monarch to come to the West</P>
<P>I have made a long journey across a great distance.</P>
<P>At each river and mountain I have met with disaster,</P>
<P>Barely escaping from monsters and fiends.</P>
<P>My heart has been set on the Three Stores of scriptures,</P>
<P>And my every thought is of Heaven above.</P>
<P>When will my toil and my labor be ended?</P>
<P>When will I go home, my journey completed?&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the woodcutter heard Sanzang saying this he said, &#8220;Don't be so downhearted, sir. It's only some three hundred miles West along this road to India, the land of paradise.&#8221;</P>
<P>As soon as Sanzang heard this he dismounted and replied, &#8220;Thank you for bringing us so far. Now that we are on the main track, please go home now, brother woodcutter, and give our respects to your venerable mother. We poor monks have no way to reward you for the sumptuous meal you gave us just now except by reciting surras morning and evening to protect you and your mother and enable both of you to live to be a hundred.&#8221; The woodcutter took his leave of them and went back by the way he had came. Master and disciples then headed West together.</P>
<P>Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The ogre subdued and wrongs set to right, he escaped from his peril;</P>
<P>Having been shown this kindness he set out on his way with the greatest of care.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know how long it was till they reached the Western Heaven, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>木母助威征怪物</p>
<p>金公施法灭妖邪</p>
</div>
<p>话说孙大圣牵着马，挑着担，满山头寻叫师父，忽见猪八戒气呼呼的跑将来道：“哥哥，你喊怎的？”行者道：“师父不见了，你可曾看见？”八戒道：“我原来只跟唐僧做和尚的，你又捉弄我，教做甚么将军！我舍着命，与那妖精战了一会，得命回来。师父是你与沙僧看着的，反来问我？”行者道：“兄弟，我不怪你。你不知怎么眼花了，把妖精放回来拿师父。我去打那妖精，教沙和尚看着师父的，如今连沙和尚也不见了。”八戒笑道：“想是沙和尚带师父那里出恭去了。”说不了，只见沙僧来到。行者问道：“沙僧，师父那里去了？”沙僧道：“你两个眼都昏了，把妖精放将来拿师父，老沙去打那妖精的，师父自家在马上坐来。”行者气得暴跳道：“中他计了！中他计了！”沙僧道：</p>

<p>“中他甚么计？”行者道：“这是分瓣梅花计，把我弟兄们调开，他劈心里捞了师父去了。天天天！却怎么好！”止不住腮边泪滴。八戒道：“不要哭！一哭就脓包了！横竖不远，只在这座山上，我们寻去来。”</p>

<p>三人没计奈何，只得入山找寻，行了有二十里远近，只见那悬崖之下，有一座洞府：削峰掩映，怪石嵯峨。奇花瑶草馨香，红杏碧桃艳丽。崖前古树，霜皮溜雨四十围；门外苍松，黛色参天二千尺。双双野鹤，常来洞口舞清风；对对山禽，每向枝头啼白昼。簇簇黄藤如挂索，行行烟柳似垂金。方塘积水，深穴依山。方塘积水，隐穷鳞未变的蛟龙；深穴依山，住多年吃人的老怪。果然不亚神仙境，真是藏风聚气巢。行者见了，两三步跳到门前看处，那石门紧闭，门上横安着一块石版，石版上有八个大字，乃隐雾山折岳连环洞。行者道：“八戒，动手啊！此间乃妖精住处，师父必在他家也。”那呆子仗势行凶，举钉钯尽力筑将去，把他那石头门筑了一个大窟窿，叫道：“妖怪！快送出我师父来，免得钉钯筑倒门，一家子都是了帐！”守门的小妖急急跑入报道：“大王，闯出祸来了！”老怪道：“有甚祸？”小妖道：“门前有人把门打破，嚷道要师父哩！”老怪大惊道：“不知是那个寻将来也？”先锋道：“莫怕！等我出去看看。”那小妖奔至前门，从那打破的窟窿处，歪着头往外张，见是个长嘴大耳朵，即回头高叫：“大王莫怕他！这个是猪八戒，没甚本事，不敢无理。他若无理。开了门，拿他进来凑蒸。怕便只怕那毛脸雷公嘴的和尚。”八戒在外边听见道：“哥啊，他不怕我，只怕你哩。师父定在他家了，你快上前。”行者骂道：“泼孽畜！你孙外公在这里！送我师父出来，饶你命罢！”先锋道：“大王，不好了！</p>

<p>孙行者也寻将来了！”老怪报怨道：“都是你定的甚么分瓣分瓣，却惹得祸事临门！怎生结果？”先锋道“大王放心，且休埋怨。我记得孙行者是个宽洪海量的猴头，虽则他神通广大，却好奉承。我们拿个假人头出去哄他一哄，奉承他几句，只说他师父是我们吃了。若还哄得他去了，唐僧还是我们受用；哄不过再作理会。”老怪道：“那里得个假人头？”先锋道：“等我做一个儿看。”好妖怪，将一把衠钢刀斧，把柳树根砍做个人头模样，喷上些人血，糊糊涂涂的，着一个小怪，使漆盘儿拿至门下叫道：“大圣爷爷，息怒容禀。”孙行者果好奉承，听见叫声大圣爷爷，便就止住八戒：“且莫动手，看他有甚话说。”拿盘的小怪道：“你师父被我大王拿进洞来，洞里小妖村顽，不识好歹，这个来吞，那个来啃，抓的抓，咬的咬，把你师父吃了，只剩了一个头在这里也。”行者道：“既吃了便罢，只拿出人头来，我看是真是假。”那小怪从门窟里抛出那个头来，猪八戒见了就哭道：</p>

<p>“可怜啊！那们个师父进去，弄做这们个师父出来也！”行者道：</p>

<p>“呆子，你且认认是真是假，就哭！”八戒道：“不羞，人头有个真假的？”行者道：“这是个假人头。”八戒道：“怎认得是假？”行者道：“真人头抛出来，扑搭不响，假人头抛得象梆子声。你不信，等我抛了你听。”拿起来往石头上一掼，当的一声响亮。沙和尚道：“哥哥，响哩！”行者道：“响便是个假的，我教他现出本相来你看。”急掣金箍棒，扑的一下，打破了。八戒看时，乃是个柳树根。呆子忍不住骂起来道：“我把你这伙毛团！你将我师父藏在洞里，拿个柳树根哄你猪祖宗，莫成我师父是柳树精变的！”</p>

<p>慌得那拿盘的小怪，战兢兢跑去报道：“难难难！难难难！”</p>

<p>老妖道：“怎么有许多难？”小妖道：“猪八戒与沙和尚倒哄过了，孙行者却是个贩古董的——识货！识货！他就认得是个假人头。如今得个真人头与他，或者他就去了。”老怪道：“怎么得个真人头？我们那剥皮亭内有吃不了的人头选一个来。”众妖即至亭内拣了个新鲜的头，教啃净头皮，滑塔塔的，还使盘儿拿出，叫：“大圣爷爷，先前委是个假头。这个真正是唐老爷的头，我大王留了镇宅子的，今特献出来也。”扑通的把个人头又从门窟里抛出，血滴滴的乱滚。孙行者认得是个真人头，没奈何就哭，八戒沙僧也一齐放声大哭。八戒噙着泪道：“哥哥，且莫哭，天气不是好天气，恐一时弄臭了。等我拿将去，乘生气埋下再哭。”行者道：“也说得是。”那呆子不嫌秽污，把个头抱在怀里，跑上山崖。向阳处，寻了个藏风聚气的所在，取钉钯筑了一个坑，把头埋了，又筑起一个坟冢，才叫沙僧：“你与哥哥哭着，等我去寻些甚么供养供养。”他就走向涧边，攀几根大柳枝，拾几块鹅卵石，回至坟前，把柳枝儿插在左右，鹅卵石堆在面前。行者问道：“这是怎么说？”八戒道：“这柳枝权为松柏，与师父遮遮坟顶；这石子权当点心，与师父供养供养。”行者喝道：“夯货！人已死了，还将石子儿供他！”八戒道：“表表生人意，权为孝道心。”行者道：“且休胡弄！教沙僧在此：一则庐墓，二则看守行李马匹。我和你去打破他的洞府，拿住妖魔，碎尸万段，与师父报仇去来。”沙和尚滴泪道：“大哥言之极当。你两个着意，我在此处看守。”</p>

<p>好八戒，即脱了皂锦直裰，束一束着体小衣，举钯随着行者。二人努力向前，不容分辨，径自把他石门打破，喊声振天叫道：“还我活唐僧来耶！”那洞里大小群妖，一个个魂飞魄散，都报怨先锋的不是。老妖问先锋道：“这些和尚打进门来，却怎处治？”先锋道：“古人说得好，手插鱼篮，避不得腥。一不做，二不休，左右帅领家兵杀那和尚去来！”老怪闻言，无计可奈，真个传令，叫：“小的们，各要齐心，将精锐器械跟我去出征。”果然一齐呐喊，杀出洞门。这大圣与八戒，急退几步，到那山场平处，抵住群妖，喝道：“那个是出名的头儿？那个是拿我师父的妖怪？”那群妖扎下营盘，将一面锦绣花旗闪一闪，老怪持铁杵，应声高呼道：“那泼和尚，你认不得我？我乃南山大王，数百年放荡于此。你唐僧已是我拿吃了，你敢如何？”行者骂道：“这个大胆的毛团！你能有多少的年纪，敢称南山二字？李老君乃开天辟地之祖，尚坐于太清之右；佛如来是治世之尊，还坐于大鹏之下；孔圣人是儒教之尊，亦仅呼为夫子。你这个孽畜，敢称甚么南山大王，数百年之放荡！不要走！吃你外公老爷一棒！”那妖精侧身闪过，使杵抵住铁棒，睁圆眼问道：“你这嘴脸象个猴儿模样，敢将许多言语压我！你有甚么手段，在吾门下猖狂？”行者笑道：“我把你个无名的孽畜！是也不知老孙！你站住，硬着胆，且听我说：祖居东胜大神洲，天地包含几万秋。</p>

<p>花果山头仙石卵，卵开产化我根苗。生来不比凡胎类，圣体原从日月俦。本性自修非小可，天姿颖悟大丹头。官封大圣居云府，倚势行凶斗斗牛。十万神兵难近我，满天星宿易为收。名扬宇宙方方晓；智贯乾坤处处留。今幸皈依从释教，扶持长老向西游。逢山开路无人阻，遇水支桥有怪愁。林内施威擒虎豹，崖前复手捉貔貅。东方果正来西域，那个妖邪敢出头！孽畜伤师真可恨，管教时下命将休！”那怪闻言，又惊又恨。咬着牙，跳近前来，使铁杵望行者就打。行者轻轻的用棒架住，还要与他讲话，那八戒忍不住，掣钯乱筑那怪的先锋。先锋帅众齐来。这一场在山中平地处混战，真是好杀：东土大邦上国僧，西方极乐取真经。南山大豹喷风雾，路阻深山独显能。施巧计，弄乖伶，无知误捉大唐僧。相逢行者神通广，更遭八戒有声名。群妖混战山平处，尘土纷飞天不清。那阵上小妖呼哮，枪刀乱举；</p>

<p>这壁厢神僧叱喝，钯棒齐兴。大圣英雄无敌手，悟能精壮喜神生。南禺老怪，部下先锋，都为唐僧一块肉，致令舍死又亡生。</p>

<p>这两个因师性命成仇隙，那两个为要唐僧忒恶情。往来斗经多半会，冲冲撞撞没输赢。孙大圣见那些小妖勇猛，连打不退。即使个分身法，把毫毛拔下一把，嚼在口中，喷出去，叫声“变！”</p>

<p>都变做本身模样，一个使一条金箍棒，从前边往里打进。那一二百个小妖，顾前不能顾后，遮左不能遮右，一个个各自逃生，败走归洞。这行者与八戒，从阵里往外杀来。可怜那些不识俊的妖精，搪着钯，九孔血出；挽着棒，骨肉如泥！唬得那南山大王滚风生雾，得命逃回。那先锋不能变化，早被行者一棒打倒，现出本相，乃是个铁背苍狼怪。八戒上前扯着脚，翻过来看了道“这厮从小儿也不知偷了人家多少猪牙子、羊羔儿吃了！”行者将身一抖，收上毫毛道：“呆子！不可迟慢！快赶老怪，讨师父的命去来！”八戒回头，就不见那些小行者，道：“哥哥的法相儿都去了！”行者道：“我已收来也。”八戒道：“妙啊！妙啊！”两个喜喜欢欢，得胜而回。</p>

<p>却说那老怪逃了命回洞，吩咐小妖搬石块挑土，把前门堵了。那些得命的小妖，一个个战兢兢的，把门都堵了，再不敢出头。这行者引八戒，赶至门首吆喝，内无人答应。八戒使钯筑时，莫想得动。行者知之，道：“八戒，莫费气力，他把门已堵了。”八戒道：“堵了门，师仇怎报？”行者道：“且回，上墓前看看沙僧去。”二人复至本处，见沙僧还哭哩。八戒越发伤悲，丢了钯，伏在坟上，手扑着土哭道：“苦命的师父啊！远乡的师父啊！</p>

<p>那里再得见你耶！”行者道：“兄弟，且莫悲切。这妖精把前门堵了，一定有个后门出入。你两个只在此间，等我再去寻看。”八戒滴泪道：“哥啊！仔细着！莫连你也捞去了，我们不好哭得：</p>

<p>哭一声师父，哭一声师兄，就要哭得乱了。”行者道：“没事！我自有手段！”</p>

<p>好大圣，收了棒，束束裙，拽开步，转过山坡，忽听得潺潺水响，且回头看处，原来是涧中水响，上溜头冲泄下来。又见涧那边有座门儿，门左边有一个出水的暗沟，沟中流出红水来。</p>

<p>他道：“不消讲！那就是后门了。若要是原嘴脸，恐有小妖开门看见认得，等我变作个水蛇儿过去。且住！变水蛇恐师父的阴灵儿知道，怪我出家人变蛇缠长，变作个小螃蟹儿过去罢。也不好，恐师父怪我出家人脚多。”即做一个水老鼠，飕的一声撺过去，从那出水的沟中，钻至里面天井中。探着头儿观看，只见那向阳处有几个小妖，拿些人肉巴子，一块块的理着晒哩。行者道：“我的儿啊！那想是师父的肉，吃不了，晒干巴子防天阴的。我要现本相，赶上前，一棍子打杀，显得我有勇无谋，且再变化进去，寻那老怪，看是何如。”跳出沟，摇身又一变，变做个有翅的蚂蚁儿。真个是：力微身小号玄驹，日久藏修有翅飞。闲渡桥边排阵势，喜来床下斗仙机。善知雨至常封穴，垒积尘多遂作灰。巧巧轻轻能爽利，几番不觉过柴扉。他展开翅，无声无影，一直飞入中堂，只见那老怪烦烦恼恼正坐，有一个小妖从后面跳将来报道：“大王万千之喜！”老妖道：“喜从何来？”小妖道：“我才在后门外涧头上探看，忽听得有人大哭。即睮上峰头望望，原来是猪八戒、孙行者、沙和尚在那里拜坟痛哭。想是把那个人头认做唐僧的头葬下，睺作坟墓哭哩。”行者在暗中听说，心内欢喜道：“若出此言，我师父还藏在那里，未曾吃哩。</p>

<p>等我再去寻寻，看死活如何，再与他说话。”好大圣，飞在中堂，东张西看，见旁边有个小门儿，关得甚紧，即从门缝儿里钻去看时，原是个大园子，隐隐的听得悲声。径飞入深处，但见一丛大树，树底下绑着两个人，一人正是唐僧。行者见了，心痒难挠，忍不住现了本相，近前叫声“师父。”那长老认得，滴泪道：</p>

<p>“悟空，你来了？快救我一救！悟空！悟空！”行者道：“师父莫只管叫名字，面前有人，怕走了风讯。你既有命，我可救得你。</p>

<p>那怪只说已将你吃了，拿个假人头哄我，我们与他恨苦相持。</p>

<p>师父放心，且再熬熬儿，等我把那妖精弄倒，方好来解救。”</p>

<p>大圣念声咒语，却又摇身还变做个蚂蚁儿，复入中堂，丁在正梁之上。只见那些未伤命的小妖，簇簇攒攒，纷纷嚷嚷。内中忽跳出一个小妖告道：“大王，他们见堵了门，攻打不开，死心塌地，舍了唐僧，将假人头弄做个坟墓。今日哭一日，明日再哭一日，后日复了三，好道回去。打听得他们散了啊，把唐僧拿出来，碎劖碎剁，把些大料煎了，香喷喷的大家吃一块儿，也得个延年长寿。”又一个小妖拍着手道：“莫说莫说！还是蒸了吃的有味！”又一个说：“煮了吃，还省柴。”又一个道：“他本是个稀奇之物，还着些盐儿腌腌，吃得长久。”行者在那梁中听见，心中大怒道：“我师父与你有甚毒情，这般算计吃他！”即将毫毛拔了一把，口中嚼碎，轻轻吹出，暗念咒语，都教变做瞌睡虫儿，往那众妖脸上抛去。一个个钻入鼻中，小妖渐渐打盹，不一时，都睡倒了。只有那个老妖睡不稳，他两只手揉头搓脸，不住的打涕喷，捏鼻子。行者道：“莫是他晓得了？与他个双掭灯！”</p>

<p>又拔一根毫毛，依母儿做了，抛在他脸上，钻于鼻孔内。两个虫儿，一个从左进，一个从右入。那老妖睮起来，伸伸腰，打两个呵欠，呼呼的也睡倒了。行者暗喜，才跳下来，现出本相。耳朵里取出棒来，幌一幌，有鸭蛋粗细，当的一声，把旁门打破，跑至后园，高叫：“师父！”长老道：“徒弟，快来解解绳儿，绑坏我了！”行者道：“师父不要忙，等我打杀妖精，再来解你。”急抽身跑至中堂。正举棍要打，又滞住手道：“不好！等解了师父来打。”复至园中，又思量道：“等打了来救。”如此者两三番，却才跳跳舞舞的到园里。长老见了，悲中作喜道：“猴儿，想是看见我不曾伤命，所以欢喜得没是处，故这等作跳舞也？”行者才至前，将绳解了，挽着师父就走，又听得对面树上绑的人叫道：</p>

<p>“老爷舍大慈悲，也救我一命！”长老立定身，叫：“悟空，那个人也解他一解。”行者道：“他是甚么人？”长老道：“他比我先拿进一日。他是个樵子，说有母亲年老，甚是思想，倒是个尽孝的，一发连他都救了罢。”</p>

<p>行者依言，也解了绳索，一同带出后门，睮上石崖，过了陡涧。长老谢道：“贤徒，亏你教了他与我命！悟能悟净都在何处？”行者道：“他两个都在那里哭你哩，你可叫他一声。”长老果厉声高叫道：“八戒！八戒！”那呆子哭得昏头昏脑的，揩揩鼻涕眼泪道：“沙和尚，师父回家来显魂哩！在那里叫我们不是？”</p>

<p>行者上前喝了一声道：“夯货！显甚么魂？这不是师父来了？”</p>

<p>那沙僧抬头见了，忙忙跪在面前道：“师父，你受了多少苦啊！</p>

<p>哥哥怎生救得你来也？”行者把上项事说了一遍。八戒闻言，咬牙恨齿，忍不住举起钯把那坟冢，一顿筑倒，掘出那人头，一顿筑得稀烂。唐僧道：“你筑他为何？”八戒道“师父啊，不知他是那家的亡人，教我朝着他哭！”长老道：“亏他救了我命哩。你兄弟们打上他门，嚷着要我，想是拿他来搪塞，不然啊，就杀了我也。还把他埋一埋，见我们出家人之意。”那呆子听长老此言，遂将一包稀烂骨肉埋下，也劖起个坟墓。行者却笑道：“师父，你请略坐坐，等我剿除去来。”即又跳下石崖，过涧入洞，把那绑唐僧与樵子的绳索拿入中堂，那老妖还睡着了，即将他四马攒蹄捆倒，使金箍棒掬起来，握在肩上，径出后门。猪八戒远远的望见道：“哥哥好干这握头事！再寻一个儿趁头挑着不好？”</p>

<p>行者到跟前放下，八戒举钯就筑。行者道：“且住！洞里还有小妖怪，未拿哩。”八戒道：“哥啊，有便带我进去打他。”行者道：</p>

<p>“打又费工夫了，不若寻些柴，教他断根罢。”那樵子闻言，即引八戒去东凹里寻了些破梢竹、败叶松、空心柳、断根藤、黄蒿、老荻、芦苇、干桑，挑了若干，送入后门里。行者点上火，八戒两耳扇起风。那大圣将身跳上，抖一抖，收了瞌睡虫的毫毛。那些小妖及醒来，烟火齐着，可怜！莫想有半个得命。连洞府烧得精空，却回见师父。师父听见老妖方醒声唤，便叫：“徒弟，妖精醒了。”八戒上前一钯，把老怪筑死，现出本相，原来是个艾叶花皮豹子精。行者道：“花皮会吃老虎，如今又会变人，这顿打死，才绝了后患也！”长老谢之不尽，攀鞍上马。那樵子道：</p>

<p>“老爷，向西南去不远，就是舍下。请老爷到舍，见见家母，叩谢老爷活命之恩，送老爷上路。”长老欣然，遂不骑马，与樵子并四众同行，向西南迤逶前来，不多路，果见那：石径重漫苔藓，柴门篷络藤花。四面山光连接，一林鸟雀喧哗。密密松篁交翠，纷纷异卉奇葩。地僻云深之处，竹篱茅舍人家。远见一个老妪，倚着柴扉，眼泪汪汪的，儿天儿地的痛哭。这樵子看见是他母亲，丢了长老，急忙忙先跑到柴扉前，跪下叫道：“母亲！儿来也！”老妪一把抱住道：“儿啊！你这几日不来家，我只说是山主拿你去，害了性命，是我心疼难忍。你既不曾被害，何以今日才来？你绳担、柯斧俱在何处？”樵子叩头道：“母亲，儿已被山主拿去，绑在树上，实是难得性命，幸亏这几位老爷！这老爷是东土唐朝往西天取经的罗汉。那老爷倒也被山主拿去绑在树上，他那三位徒弟老爷，神通广大，把山主一顿打死，却是个艾叶花皮豹子精；概众小妖，俱尽烧死，却将那老老爷解下救出，连孩儿都解救出来，此诚天高地厚之恩！不是他们，孩儿也死无疑了。如今山上太平，孩儿彻夜行走，也无事矣。”那老妪听言，一步一拜，拜接长老四众，都入柴扉茅舍中坐下。娘儿两个磕头称谢不尽，慌慌忙忙的安排些素斋酬谢。八戒道：“樵哥，我，见你府上也寒薄，只可将就一饭，切莫费心大摆布。”樵子道“不瞒老爷说，我这山间实是寒薄，没甚么香蕈、蘑菰、川椒、大料，只是几品野菜奉献老爷，权表寸心。”八戒笑道：“聒噪聒噪，放快些儿就是，我们肚中饥了。”樵子道：“就有！就有！”果然不多时，展抹桌凳，摆将上来，果是几盘野菜。但见那：嫩焯黄花菜，酸虀白鼓丁。浮蔷马齿苋，江荠雁肠英。燕子不来香且嫩，芽儿拳小脆还青。烂煮马蓝头，白熝狗脚迹。猫耳朵，野落荜，灰条熟烂能中吃；剪刀股，牛塘利，倒灌窝螺操帚荠。碎米荠，莴菜荠，几品青香又滑腻。油炒乌英花，菱科甚可夸；蒲根菜并茭儿菜，四般近水实清华。看麦娘，娇且佳；破破纳，不穿他，苦麻台下藩篱架。雀儿绵单，猢狲脚迹，油灼灼煎来只好吃。斜蒿青蒿抱娘蒿，灯娥儿飞上板荞荞。羊耳秃，枸杞头，加上乌蓝不用油。几般野菜一餐饭，樵子虔心为谢酬。</p>

<p>师徒们饱餐一顿，收拾起程。那樵子不敢久留，请母亲出来，再拜再谢。樵子只是磕头，取了一条枣木棍，结束了衣裙，出门相送。沙僧牵马，八戒挑担，行者紧随左右，长老在马上拱手道：“樵哥，烦先引路，到大路上相别。”一齐登高下坂，转涧寻坡。长老在马上思量道：“徒弟啊！自从别主来西域，递递迢迢去路遥。水水山山灾不脱，妖妖怪怪命难逃。心心只为经三藏，念念仍求上九霄。碌碌劳劳何日了，几时行满转唐朝！”樵子闻言道：“老爷切莫忧思。这条大路，向西方不满千里，就是天竺国极乐之乡也。”长老闻言，鄱身下马道：“有劳远涉。既是大路，请樵哥回府，多多拜上令堂老安人：适间厚扰盛斋，贫僧无甚相谢，只是早晚诵经，保佑你母子平安，百年长寿。”那樵子喏喏相辞，复回本路，师徒遂一直投西。正是：降怪解冤离苦厄，受恩上路用心行。毕竟不知还有几日得到西天，且听下回分解。</p>
