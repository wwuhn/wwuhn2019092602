<P>The Heart's Master Prepares Medicine in the Night</P>
<P>The Monarch Discusses a Demon at the Banquet</P>
</div>
<P>The story tells how the Great Sage Sun went with the eunuchs in attendance on the king to the inner quarters of the palace and stood outside the doors of the royal bed-chamber. Handing the three golden threads to the eunuchs to take inside he gave them these instructions:</P>
<P>&#8220;Tell the queens and consorts of the inner palace or the eunuchs in personal attendance to fasten these threads to His Majesty's left wrist at the inch, the bar and the cubit, then pass them out of the window to me.&#8221; The eunuchs did as he said, asking the king to sit on his dragon bed while they fastened one end of the golden threads to the inch, the bar and the cubit and passed the other ends outside.</P>
<P>Monkey took these ends and first held the end of one between the thumb and the forefinger of his right hand and felt the pulse at the inch point. He held the next against his middle finger and felt the pulse at the bar, and then pressed his thumb against his third finger and felt the cubit pulse. Next he regulated his own breathing to examine the four functions, the five depressions, the seven exterior and eight interior symptoms, the nine tempers, the deep pulses within the floating ones and the floating ones within the deep ones. He thus determined the insufficiencies and excesses of the functioning of organs, then told the eunuchs to take the threads off the king's left wrist and fasten them to the same points on the right wrist. He felt the threads one by one with the fingers of his left hand.</P>
<P>With a shake he put the golden threads back on his body and shouted at the top of his voice, &#8220;Your Majesty, the inch pulse on your left wrist is strong and tense, the bar pulse is sluggish and tardy, and the cubit is hollow and deep. On your right wrist the inch is floating and slippery, the bar is slow and knotted, and the cubit is frequent and firm. The left inch being strong and tense means that you have an internal emptiness and pains in the heart. The left bar being sluggish and tardy shows that you sweat and that your muscles feel numb. The hollowness and depth of the cubit suggest red urine and bloody stools. The floating, slippery inch pulse on the right wrist shows internal accumulations and blocked channels. The bar being slow and knotted is from indigestion and retained drinking. The frequency and wiriness of the cubit shows a chronic opposition of irritable fullness and empty coldness. My diagnosis of Your Majesty's ailment is that you are suffering from alarm and worry. The condition is the one known as the 'pair of birds parted.'&#8221;</P>
<P>When the king heard this inside his chamber he was so delighted that his spirits revived and he shouted in reply, &#8220;You have understood my illness through your fingers. That is indeed my trouble. Please go out and fetch some medicine.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey walked slowly out of the inner palace, by when the eunuchs watching him had already given the news to everyone. When Monkey emerged a moment later the Tang Priest asked him how it had gone. &#8220;I made a diagnosis from his pulses,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;I now have to prepare the medicine for his condition.&#8221;</P>
<P>All the officials then came forward to ask, &#8220;Holy monk, reverend sir, what is the 'pair of birds parted' condition of which you spoke just now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's when a cock bird and a hen who were flying together are suddenly separated by a violent storm,&#8221; replied Monkey with a smile. &#8220;The hen misses the cock and the cock misses the hen. Isn't that 'a pair of birds parted?'&#8220; At this the officials all cried out over and over again in admiration. &#8220;He really is a holy monk! He really is a divine doctor!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You have diagnosed the condition,&#8221; said one of the fellows of the Royal College of Medicine, &#8220;but what drugs will you use to treat it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no need to stick to prescriptions,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'll choose the drugs when I see them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;According to the medical classic, &#8220;There are 808 varieties of medicine and 404 varieties of sickness,'&#8220; said the fellows of the Royal College of Medicine. &#8220;How can it be right to use all the medicines when one person does not have all the ailments? You can't just choose your drugs on sight.&#8221;</P>
<P>To this Monkey replied, &#8220;The ancients said, 'In preparing medicines do not stick rigidly to the formulae; use them as appropriate.' That's why I've asked for the full range of pharmaceutical materials so that I can make adjustments as I need to.&#8221;</P>
<P>The fellows of the Royal College could say no more to this, but went out through the palace gates and sent those of the college's staff who were on duty to tell all the pharmacies in the city, whether selling raw materials or prepared drugs, to send three pounds of each to Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is no place for preparing medicine,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;All the medicines and a set of pharmacist's utensils must be sent to the Hostel of Meeting and handed over to my two fellow disciples.&#8221; The fellows did as they were told. Three pounds of each of the 808 ingredients of medicine together with pharmacist's rollers, hand-mills, sieves, mortars, bowls, pestles and the like were all sent to the hostel, handed over and received.</P>
<P>Monkey went back into the throne hall and asked his master to return to the hostel with him while he prepared the medicine. Sanzang was just getting up to go when the king sent a command from the inner quarters that the Master of the Law was to stay behind and spend the night in the Hall of Literary Splendor; the next morning, after taking the medicine and recovering from his illness, the king would reward them, inspect the passport and send them on their way. Sanzang was horrified.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; he said, &#8220;he means to keep me here as a hostage. If he is cured he will be happy to send us on our way, but if the treatment fails my life is over. You must be very careful and pay full attention when preparing the medicine.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry, Master,&#8221; Monkey said with a smile, &#8220;Enjoy yourself here. I'm a superb doctor.&#8221;</P>
<P>Taking his leave of Sanzang and of all the officials the splendid Great Sage went straight back to the hostel where Pig welcomed him with a grin. &#8220;Brother,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I know what you're up to.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;If fetching the scriptures doesn't come off you'll be left without any capital to start up a business.&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;Now you've seen how prosperous this place is you're planning to open a chemist's shop here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't talk nonsense,&#8221; shouted Monkey. &#8220;When I've cured the king I'll use my success to leave the court and be on our way. I'm not going to be running a chemist's.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;if you're not opening a shop, why get three pounds of each of 808 different ingredients to treat one man? How much of it will you need? How many years will it take for him to finish the lot?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He'll never finish that much,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;The fellows of their Royal College of Medicine are a load of idiots. The only reason why I sent for so many ingredients was to baffle them and stop them knowing which ones I'm going to use. Then they won't be able to find out what my miraculous prescription is.&#8221;</P>
<P>As they were talking two of the hostel staff came in and fell to their knees before them to say, &#8220;We beg the holy monks and reverend gentlemen to partake of their evening repast.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This morning you treated us rather differently,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;so why go on your knees to invite us now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When you first came, my lords,&#8221; the hostel orderlies replied, &#8220;we were too blind to recognize your illustrious faces. Now we have heard how you are using your outstanding medical powers to treat our king. If His Majesty recovers his health he will share the kingdom with you, so we'll all be your subjects. So it's only proper for us to kowtow to you and to invite you politely to eat.&#8221; On hearing this Monkey cheerfully took the place of honour while Pig and Friar Sand sat to his left and right.</P>
<P>As the vegetarian meal was served Friar Sand asked, &#8220;Where's our master, brother?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The king's kept him as a hostage,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;When the king's cured he'll regard us and send us on our way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Is he being well looked after?&#8221; Friar Sand continued.</P>
<P>&#8220;His host's a king,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;so of course he's in luxury. When I went there he had three senior ministers looking after him and he was invited into the Hall of Literary Splendor.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;the master's still doing much better than us. He's got ministers looking after him, and we've only got a couple of hostel orderlies to serve us. So I'm going to forget about him and eat a good meal.&#8221; Thus the three of them enjoyed their meal at ease.</P>
<P>It was now late. &#8220;Tidy the dishes away,&#8221; Monkey said to the hostel orderlies, &#8220;and fetch me plenty of oil and candles. The best time for us to make up the medicine will be in the quiet of the night.&#8221;</P>
<P>The orderlies brought oil and candles as instructed and were then dismissed. In the still silence of the middle of the night Pig asked, &#8220;Brother, what, medicines are we going to make? Let's get on with it. I need my shut-eye.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Get an ounce of rhubarb and grind it to a fine powder with a roller,&#8221; said Brother Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Rhubarb has a bitter taste and a cold nature and isn't noxious,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;Its nature is deep, not superficial; it's an active medicine, not a defensive one. It removes stagnations and clears obstructions, settles disorder, and brings about peace, and they call it 'the general'. It's a cathartic drug. But perhaps it's wrong for someone in an empty, weakened state after a long illness.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's something you don't know, brother,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;This drug helps phlegm, makes the vital forces travel smoothly, and calms the heat and cold that become congested in the stomach. Just leave me alone and fetch me an ounce of croton seeds. Shell them, peel them, hammer the poisonous oil out of them, then grind them to a fine powder with a roller.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Croton seed is acrid, hot by nature and poisonous,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;It cuts away hard accumulations, deals with submerged cold in the lungs and bowels, and clears obstructions. It smooths the way for water and grain. It's a warrior for storming passes and gates. You must be very careful how you use it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;what you don't understand is that this is a drug that destroys knots, opens the intestine and can cure swelling of the heart and dropsy. Hurry up and get it ready. And I'll want an adjuvant to back it up.&#8221;</P>
<P>The two of them started work on grinding the two drugs to a fine powder. &#8220;You'll need dozens more, brother,&#8221; they said, &#8220;so which'll they be?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's all,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;But you've got three pounds of each of 808 different medicinal ingredients,&#8221; Pig said. &#8220;If all you're going to use is two ounces you've been making a fool of these people.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey then produced a patterned porcelain dish and said, &#8220;Stop talking, brothers. Take this dish and fill it half full with soot scraped from a cooking pot.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Whatever for?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I need it for the medicine,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;I never heard of soot from a cooking pot being used in medicine,&#8221; said Friar Sand.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's called 'frost on the flowers,'&#8220; said Monkey, &#8220;and it helps treat all kinds of illness. Didn't you know that?&#8221; The idiot then scraped off half a dishful and ground it up to a fine powder.</P>
<P>Monkey then handed him another dish and said, &#8220;Now fetch me half a dishful of our horse's piss.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What for?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;To make the medicine up into pills with.&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand with a smile, &#8220;this is no joking matter. Horse piss stinks. You can't use it in medicine. I've only seen vinegar paste, old rice paste, refined honey and clean water used for making pills. Who ever heard of horse piss used to make pills? It's got a terrible stink. Anyone with a weak spleen would throw up at the first sniff. If he goes on and takes the rhubarb and croton seeds he'll be vomiting at one end and having the runs at the other. That'll be no joke.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't know the inside story,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;That horse of ours is no ordinary horse. He used to be a dragon in the Western Ocean. If he'll give us some of his piss it'll cure any illness you could have. My only worry is that he might refuse.&#8221; When Pig heard this he went and stood beside the horse, who was lying down asleep. The idiot kicked the horse till he got to his feet then pressed himself against the horse's stomach for a very long time but without seeing any sign of piss. He ran back to Monkey to say, &#8220;Brother, never mind about treating the king. Hurry up and cure the horse. He's done for: he's dried right up. There's no way we're going to get a drop of piss out of him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll go with you,&#8221; smiled Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll come and have a look too,&#8221; said Friar Sand.</P>
<P>When the three of them reached the horse he started to jump about and shout in human language at the top of his voice, &#8220;How can you be so ignorant, brother? I used to be a flying dragon in the Western Ocean. The Bodhisattva Guanyin saved me after I'd offended against the Heavenly Code. She sawed off my horns, removed my scales and turned me into a horse to carry the master to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures. This way I'll be able to redeem my crimes. If I pissed into any river I was crossing the fish in the water would drink it and turn into dragons. The grass on any mountain we were going over that got a taste of it would become magic fungus for immortal boys to gather and give themselves eternal life. So of course I can't casually drop it in a vulgar, worldly place like this.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Watch your words, brother,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;This is the city of a Western king, not some vulgar, worldly place. You wouldn't be casually dropping it here. As the saying goes, many hands make light work. We've got to cure the king. When we do we'll all be covered in glory. If we fail I'm afraid we won't be able to leave this country with any credit.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wait a moment,&#8221; the horse finally said. Look at him as he springs forward then squats back on his haunches, grinds his teeth noisily and only with the greatest strain manages to squeeze out a few drops before standing up again.</P>
<P>&#8220;What a deadbeat,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;You could give us a few more even if they were drops of gold.&#8221;</P>
<P>Seeing that the dish was now about a third full Monkey said, &#8220;That'll do, that'll do. Take it away.&#8221; Only then did Friar Sand feel cheerful.</P>
<P>The three of them then returned to the main hall, mixed the piss with the ingredients that had already been prepared, and rolled the mixture into three large round balls. &#8220;They're too big, brothers,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;They're only walnut-sized,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;That wouldn't be enough for a single mouthful if I were taking them.&#8221; The three disciples then put the pills into a large box and went to bed fully dressed.</P>
<P>It was soon dawn, and despite his sickness the king held court, asking the Tang Priest to come to see him and sending all his officials straight to the Hostel of Meeting to pay their respects to the holy monk, the Venerable Sun, and fetch the medicine.</P>
<P>When the officials reached the hostel they prostrated themselves before Brother Monkey with the words, &#8220;His Majesty has sent us to pay our respects and fetch the miraculous medicine.&#8221; Monkey told Pig to fetch the box, which he opened and handed to the officials.</P>
<P>&#8220;What is this medicine called?&#8221; they asked. &#8220;We would like to be able to inform His Majesty when we see him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's called Black Gold Elixir,&#8221; Monkey replied, at which Pig and Friar Sand had to hide their grins as they thought, &#8220;of course they're black gold&#8212;they were made with soot scraped off cooking pots.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What should be taken with the pills to guide them on their way?&#8221; the officials asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;There are two kinds of guide that can be taken with them,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;One's easily got hold of. That is a decoction of six ingredients to be taken as a hot potion.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What six ingredients?&#8221; the officials asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;A fart from a flying crow,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;piss from a carp in a fast-flowing stream, some of the face-powder used by the Queen Mother of the West, soot from elixir refined in Lord Lao's furnace, three pieces of a worn-out head cloth of the Jade Emperor's, and five whiskers from a trapped dragon's beard. A decoction of those six ingredients taken with the pills would clear up your king's illness straight away.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the officials heard this they replied, &#8220;Those are things that are not to be found in this world, so please tell us what the other guide is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The pills should be taken with rootless water,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;That's very easily got hold of,&#8221; smiled the officials.</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you be so sure?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;We have a saying here,&#8221; the officials replied, &#8220;that if you need rootless water you take a bowl or a dish to a well or a stream, fill it with water, and hurry back with it. Don't spill a drop, don't look behind you, and give it to the patient to take with the medicine.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But well water and stream water both have roots,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;The rootless water I'm talking about has to fall from the sky and be drunk before it touches the ground. Only then can it be called rootless.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's easily got too,&#8221; the officials said. &#8220;The medicine shouldn't be taken till the next cloudy, wet day.&#8221;</P>
<P>The officials then kowtowed to thank Monkey and took the medicine back with them to present to the king, who delightedly ordered his attendants to bring it to him.</P>
<P>&#8220;What are these pills?&#8221; he asked when he saw them.</P>
<P>&#8220;The holy monk says they are Black Gold Elixir and have to be taken with rootless water,&#8221; the officials replied. The king then sent some of his palace women to fetch rootless water.</P>
<P>&#8220;The holy monk says that rootless water can't be got from wells or streams,&#8221; the officials said. &#8220;It has to be water that has come down from the sky and not yet touched the ground.&#8221; The king then ordered his aides to issue a decree inviting magicians to summon rain. The officials then issued a proclamation as the king had ordered.</P>
<P>Back in the hall of the Hostel of Meeting Brother Monkey said to Pig, &#8220;He must be given some rain now so he can take his medicine. This is very urgent. How are we going to get some? I reckon he's a very virtuous and worthy king, so why don't we help him get a little rainwater to take his medicine with?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But how are we going to help him get some rootless water?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Stand on my left and be my Sustainer Star,&#8221; Monkey said to him, then told Friar Sand, &#8220;stand on my right as my Straightener Star while I help him to get some rootless water.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage then paced out a magic pattern and said the words of a spell. Soon a dark cloud appeared to their East that came closer till it was over their heads. &#8220;Great Sage,&#8221; called a voice from it, &#8220;Ao Guang, the Dragon King of the Eastern Sea, is here to call on you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I wouldn't have troubled you if it hadn't been important,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;Could I ask you to help by giving the king here some rootless water to take his medicine with?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When you summoned me, Great Sage,&#8221; the dragon king replied, &#8220;you said nothing about water. I have only come by myself. I haven't brought any rain-making equipment, to say nothing of wind, clouds, thunder and lightning. So how can I make it rain?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There'll be no call for wind, clouds, thunder or lightning this time,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;and we don't need much rain either. We just need enough water for someone to take his medicine with.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case I'll do a couple of sneezes and spit out some saliva,&#8221; the dragon king said. &#8220;That ought to be enough for him to take his medicine.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Terrific,&#8221; said Monkey, delighted. &#8220;Don't waste a moment. Do it as soon as you can.&#8221;</P>
<P>The ancient old dragon gradually brought his dark cloud down till it was just over the palace, though he kept himself entirely concealed. He spat out a mouthful of saliva that turned into timely rain, whereupon all the officials at court exclaimed, &#8220;Ten million congratulations, Your Majesty. Heaven is sending down timely rain.&#8221;</P>
<P>The king then ordered, &#8220;Take vessels out to hold the rain. All officials, whether inside or outside the palace and irrespective of their rank, must gather this sacred water to save our life.&#8221; Just watch as all the civil and military officials as well as the consorts, concubines, three thousand beauties, and eight hundred charming ladies-in-waiting of the three harems and the six compounds of the inner palace all stood there holding cups, dishes, bowls and plates to catch the timely rain. Up in the sky the ancient dragon so controlled his saliva that all of it fell within the palace. After about two hours the dragon king took his leave of the Great Sage and went back to the sea. When the officials gathered all the cups, dishes, bowls and plates together they found that some had caught one or two drops of water, some three to five, and some none at all. When it was all put together there were a little over three dishes full of it, and this was all presented to the king. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The throne hall was filled with exquisite fragrance;</P>
<P>Fine scents were wafting round the Son of Heaven's court.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The king then dismissed the Master of the Law and had the Black Gold Elixir and the timely rain carried into the inner quarters, where he took the first pill with the first dish of timely rain, then the second pill with the second dish. In three efforts he finished all three pills and all three dishfuls. Soon afterwards there was a noise from his stomach like the endless turning of a windlass. He sent for his chamber pot and evacuated four or five times before taking some rice porridge and collapsing on his dragon bed. When two of his consorts inspected the chamber pot they saw it contained huge amounts of feces and mucus, and amid it all a ball of glutinous rice.</P>
<P>&#8220;The root of the disorder has come out,&#8221; the consorts reported, going over to the royal bed. The king was very pleased to hear this and ate some rice. A little later his chest felt eased and his natural forces and blood were in harmonious balance once more. He was full of vigor and the strength came back to his legs, so he rose from his bed, dressed in his court clothes and went into the throne hall, where he greeted the Tang Priest by prostrating himself. The venerable elder returned this courtesy as quickly as he could.</P>
<P>When this had been done the king helped Sanzang to his feet with his own hands and told his courtiers, &#8220;Write a note at once sending our personal and respectful greetings and have an official go to invite the three illustrious disciples of the Master of the Law to come here. Meanwhile the Eastern hall of the palace is to be opened up and the department of foreign relations is to arrange a banquet of thanksgiving.&#8221; Having been given these commands the officials carried them out. The scribes wrote out the note and the caterers prepared the meal. A state is indeed strong enough to overturn a mountain, and everything was done in an instant.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Pig saw the officials come to deliver the note he was beside himself with delight. &#8220;Brother,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it really must be miracle medicine. From the way they're coming to thank you you must have pulled it off.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've got it all wrong, brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;As the saying goes, 'One man's good fortune affects his whole household.' We two made up the pills, so we take a share of the credit. So just enjoy yourself and stop talking.&#8221; Hey! Just look at the three brothers as they all happily go straight to the palace, where all the officials received them and led them to the Eastern hall.</P>
<P>Here they saw the Tang Priest with the king and his ministers and the banquet all set out ready. Brother Monkey, Pig and Friar Sand all chanted a &#8220;na-a-aw&#8221; of respect to their master, after which the officials all came in. In the best place there were set out four tables of vegetarian food. It was the sort of banquet at which there are ten times as many dishes as you can eat. In front of these tables was one of meat dishes, and on this too you could see ten dishes of rare delicacies while you ate one. To either side four or five hundred more single tables were most neatly set out.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As the ancients had it:</P>
<P>&#8220;A hundred rare delicacies,</P>
<P>A thousand goblets of fine wine,</P>
<P>Rich cream and yogurt,</P>
<P>Fat, red meat like brocade.&#8221;</P>
<P>Precious and many-coloured decorations,</P>
<P>Heavy fragrances of fruit.</P>
<P>Huge sugar dragons coil round sweet lions and immortals:</P>
<P>Ingots of cake draw furnaces escorted by phoenixes.</P>
<P>For meat there was pork and mutton, goose, chicken, duck and fish;</P>
<P>For vegetables, bamboo shoots, beansprouts, fungus and button mushrooms.</P>
<P>Delicious noodles in soup,</P>
<P>Translucent creamy sweets,</P>
<P>Succulent millet,</P>
<P>Fresh wild rice congee,</P>
<P>Pungent, tasty soup with rice noodles,</P>
<P>Dishes in which sweetness vied with beauty.</P>
<P>Monarch and subjects raised their cups as the diners took their seats;</P>
<P>Officials seated by rank slowly passed the jugs.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Holding a cup in his hand the king first seated the Tang Priest, who said, &#8220;As a monk I may not drink liquor.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is alcohol-free wine,&#8221; the king said. &#8220;Could you not drink one cup of this, Master of the Law?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But wine is the first prohibition for us monks,&#8221; said Sanzang. The king felt awkward.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you may not drink, Master of the Law, how can I congratulate you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My three badly-behaved disciples will drink on my behalf,&#8221; Sanzang replied. The king then happily passed the golden goblet to Monkey, who took it, made a courteous gesture to the assembly, and downed a cupful. Seeing how cheerfully he downed it the king offered him another cup. Monkey did not decline it but drank again.</P>
<P>&#8220;Have a third goblet,&#8221; said the king with a smile, and Monkey accepted and drank for a third time. The king then ordered that the cup be refilled and said, &#8220;Have another to make it four for the four seasons.&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig, who was standing beside Monkey, had to put up with the saliva gurgling inside him as the wine would not come his way; and now that the king was pressing Monkey so hard to drink he started to shout, &#8220;Your Majesty, that medicine you took owes something to me. Those pills include horse&#8212;&#8221; When Monkey heard this he was terrified that the idiot was going to give the game away, so he handed Pig the cup. Pig took the cup, drank and stopped talking.</P>
<P>&#8220;Holy monk,&#8221; said the king, &#8220;just now you said there was horse in the pills. What sort of horse?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This brother of mine has a very loose tongue,&#8221; said Monkey, cutting in. &#8220;We've got a really good formula that has been tried and tested, and he wants to give it away. The pills Your Majesty took this morning included not horse but Aristolochia.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What class of medicine is Aristolochia?&#8221; the king asked. &#8220;What conditions can it cure?&#8221;</P>
<P>One of the fellows of the Royal College of Medicine who was standing beside the king said, &#8220;Your Majesty,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Aristolochia is bitter, cold and free of poison,</P>
<P>Ends shortness of breath and cures phlegm well,</P>
<P>Circulates the energy, removes blood infections,</P>
<P>Fills emptiness, soothes coughs and eases the heart.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;It was the right thing to use, the right thing to use,&#8221; the king said. &#8220;The Venerable Pig must have another cup.&#8221; The idiot said nothing more, but downed three goblets. The king then gave three cupfuls to Friar Sand, who drank them. Everyone then sat down.</P>
<P>When they all had been feasting and drinking for a long time the king raised a large goblet once more and handed it to Monkey. &#8220;Please sit down, Your Majesty,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;I've been drinking hard in every round. I'd never refuse.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Holy monk,&#8221; the king said, &#8220;we are under a profound debt of gratitude to you that we will never be able to repay. Please drain this great goblet: we have something to say to you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Say what you will first,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;I'll drink after.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We suffered from that melancholia for years on end,&#8221; the king said, &#8220;and one dose of your miraculous pills cured it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When I saw Your Majesty yesterday I realized you were suffering from melancholia,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;but I don't know what's getting you down.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's an old saying that a family doesn't talk about its dirt to strangers,&#8221; the king replied. &#8220;As you are our benefactor, holy monk, we shall tell you, but please don't laugh.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'd never dare,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;Please speak freely.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How many countries did you holy monks come through on your way here from the East?&#8221; the king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Five or six,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;What titles do the queens of the other kings have?&#8221; the king went on to ask.</P>
<P>&#8220;They're called the queens of the Main Palace, East Palace and West Palace,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;We don't use titles like that,&#8221; the king said. &#8220;We call the principal queen the Queen of the Sacred Golden Palace, the Eastern queen the Queen of the Sacred Jade Palace and the Western queen the Queen of the Sacred Silver Palace. But now only the Jade and Silver Queen are here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why isn't the Golden Queen in the palace?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;She has been gone for three whole years,&#8221; the king replied in tears.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where did she go?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;At the Dragon-boat Festival three years ago,&#8221; the king said, &#8220;we were in the Pomegranate Pavilion of the palace gardens with our queens and consorts, unwrapping rice dumplings, putting artemisia out, drinking calamus and realgar wine and watching the dragon boats race when all of a sudden there was a gust of wind. An evil spirit appeared in mid-air. He said he was the Evil Star Matcher who lives in the Horndog Cave on Mount Unicorn and was short of a wife. Seeing how beautiful and charming our Golden Queen is he wanted her for his wife and insisted we should hand her over at once. If we did not do so by the time he had asked three times he was going to eat us up first, then our officials and all the commoners living in the city. We were so concerned over the fate of our country and our people that there was no alternative: the Golden Queen had to be pushed outside the pavilion to be carried noisily off by the evil spirit. All this gave us such a fright that the rice dumpling we were eating turned solid inside us. On top of that we have been unable to sleep for worrying, which is why we were ill for three years. Since taking you holy monks' miraculous pills we have evacuated our bowels three times, and the accumulations from three years ago have all been passed. That is why our body now feels light and strong and our spirit is restored to what it was. Our life has today been given to us by you holy monks; this is a gift more weighty than Mount Tai.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Brother Monkey heard this he was very happy indeed and he downed the huge goblet of wine in two gulps. &#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; he said with a smile to the king, &#8220;so that's what caused your shock and your depression. Today you've been lucky: you met me and you were cured. But I don't know whether you want the Golden Queen back in the palace.&#8221;</P>
<P>To this the king answered with tears, &#8220;We have been longing for her night and day, but nobody has ever been able to catch the evil spirit. Of course we want her back in our country.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What if I go to deal with that evil creature for you?&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>The king fell to his knees and replied, &#8220;If you can rescue our queen we will gladly take our three queens and nine consorts away from the capital and go to live as commoners, leaving the whole kingdom to be yours to reign over, holy monk.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Pig, who was sitting beside them, heard all this being said and such great honors being done he could not help bursting into noisy laughter.</P>
<P>&#8220;This king's got no sense of what's proper,&#8221; he chortled. &#8220;Fancy giving up his kingdom and going on his knees to a monk for the sake of his old woman.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey hurried forward to help the king back on his feet and ask, &#8220;Your Majesty, has the evil spirit been back since he got the Golden Queen?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In the fifth month of the year before last,&#8221; the king said, &#8220;he carried off the Golden Queen. In the tenth month he came back to demand a couple of ladies in waiting to serve her, and we presented him with a couple. In the third month of last year he came to demand another couple, and two more in the seventh month. Then in the second month of this year it was a fourth pair. We do not know when he will be back again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If he comes that often you must be terrified of him,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Because he has come so frequently we are afraid of him and of his murderous intentions,&#8221; said the king. &#8220;In the fourth month last year we ordered the building of a demon shelter, so that whenever we hear the wind and know that he's coming we can shelter there with our two queens and nine consorts.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Would Your Majesty mind taking me to see the shelter?&#8221; Monkey asked, and the king led Monkey by his left hand from the table. All the officials rose to their feet.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; protested Pig, &#8220;you're very unreasonable. Why leave this royal wine and break up the banquet to go looking at something?&#8221;</P>
<P>Hearing this and realizing that Pig was worried for his stomach the king told his attendants to have two tables of vegetarian food brought along so that Pig could go on being wined outside the demon shelter. Only then did the idiot stop making a fuss and join in with his master and Friar Sand saying, &#8220;Let's break up the banquet.&#8221;</P>
<P>As a column of civil and military officials led the way the king and Monkey went arm-in-arm through the living quarters of the palace to the back of the royal gardens, but there were no great buildings to be seen.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where's the demon shelter?&#8221; Monkey asked, and before the words were out of his mouth two eunuchs levered open a square flagstone with red lacquered crowbars.</P>
<P>&#8220;Here it is,&#8221; said the king. &#8220;Twenty feet or more below us a large underground palace hall has been excavated. In it there are four great vats of purified oil in which lights burn night and day. When we hear the wind we take shelter here and the flagstone is put on again from outside.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So the evil spirit doesn't want to kill you,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile. &#8220;If he did this would give you no protection.&#8221; Just as he was speaking there came the roaring of a wind from due South that made the dust fly.</P>
<P>In their alarm all the officials complained, &#8220;That monk has the mouth of an oracle. The moment he mentions the evil spirit it turns up.&#8221; The panic-stricken monarch abandoned Monkey and scuttled into his underground shelter. The Tang Priest went with him, and all the officials fled for cover.</P>
<P>Pig and Friar Sand wanted to hide too, but Monkey grabbed one of them with each hand and said, &#8220;Don't be afraid, brothers. You and I are going to identify him and see what sort of evil spirit he is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;What do we want to identify him for? The officials have all hidden and the king's shut himself away. Why don't we clear off? What kind of hero are you trying to be?&#8221; But struggle though he might the idiot could not break free. When Monkey had been holding on to him for some time an evil spirit suddenly appeared in mid-air. Just see what it looked like:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A loathsome great body nine feet tall,</P>
<P>Round eyes flashing like lamps of gold.</P>
<P>Two huge ears sticking out as if they were round fans,</P>
<P>Four steel fangs like very long nails.</P>
<P>Red hair curled at his temples; his brows were as flames;</P>
<P>His nose was a hanging trough; his nostrils flared.</P>
<P>His whiskers were strands of cinnabar thread,</P>
<P>And jutting cheekbones shaped his green face.</P>
<P>On red-muscled arms were hands of indigo blue,</P>
<P>And ten sharp claws grasped a spear.</P>
<P>A leopardskin kilt was tied round his waist.</P>
<P>Bare feet and tangled hair completed his fiendish looks.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Friar Sand,&#8221; asked Monkey when he saw the evil spirit, &#8220;can you recognize him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I don't know who he is,&#8221; Friar Sand replied. &#8220;I've never seen him before.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Pig,&#8221; Monkey next asked, &#8220;do you know?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've never had a cup or a drink with him,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;He's no friend or neighbour of mine. How could I know?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He reminds me of the sallow-faced golden-eyed gate keeper ghost under the Equal of Heaven of the Eastern Peak.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No he isn't, no he isn't,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;How do you know he isn't?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Because ghosts are spirits of the dark and the underworld,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;They only come out at night, between five and midnight. It's only ten in the morning, and no ghost would ever dare come out now. And even if it was a devil it'd never ride a cloud. Ghosts that stir up winds make whirlwinds, not gales. Perhaps he's the Evil Star Matcher.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're not such an idiot after all,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;That sounds sensible, so you two look after the master while I go to ask him his name. That'll help me rescue the Golden Queen and bring her back to the palace for the king.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Go if you must,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;but don't tell him anything about us.&#8221; Monkey did not deign to answer, but leapt straight up on his magic light. Goodness!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>To settle the nation he started by curing the king;</P>
<P>To preserve the Way love and hatred had to go.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know who won the battle that followed when Monkey rose up into the sky or how the evil monster was captured and the Golden Queen rescued listen to the explanation in the next chapter.</P>

<p>心主夜间修药物</p>
<p>君王筵上论妖邪</p>
</div>
<p>话表孙大圣同近侍宦官，到于皇宫内院，直至寝宫门外立定，将三条金线与宦官拿入里面，吩咐：“教内宫妃后，或近侍太监，先系在圣躬左手腕下，按寸关尺三部上，却将线头从窗棂儿穿出与我。”真个那宦官依此言，请国王坐在龙床，按寸关尺以金线一头系了，一头理出窗外。行者接了线头，以自己右手大指先托着食指，看了寸脉；次将中指按大指，看了关脉；又将大指托定无名指，看了尺脉；调停自家呼吸，分定四气五郁、七表八里九候、浮中沉、沉中浮，辨明了虚实之端；又教解下左手，依前系在右手腕下部位。行者即以左手指，一一从头诊视毕，却将身抖了一抖，把金线收上身来，厉声高呼道：“陛下左手寸脉强而紧，关脉涩而缓，尺脉芤且沉；右手寸脉浮而滑，关脉迟而结，尺脉数而牢。夫左寸强而紧者，中虚心痛也；关涩而缓者，汗出肌麻也；尺芤而沉者，小便赤而大便带血也。右手寸脉浮而滑者，内结经闭也；关迟而结者，宿食留饮也；尺数而牢者，烦满虚寒相持也。诊此贵恙是一个惊恐忧思，号为双鸟失群之证。”那国王在内闻言满心欢喜，打起精神高声应道：“指下明白！指下明白！果是此疾！请出外面用药来也。”大圣却才缓步出宫。早有在旁听见的太监，已先对众报知。须臾行者出来，唐僧即问如何，行者道：“诊了脉，如今对证制药哩。”众官上前道：“神僧长老，适才说双鸟失群之证，何也？”行者笑道：“有雌雄二鸟，原在一处同飞，忽被暴风骤雨惊散，雌不能见雄，雄不能见雌，雌乃想雄，雄亦想雌：这不是双鸟失群也？”</p>

<p>众官闻说，齐声喝采道：“真是神僧！真是神医！”称赞不已。当有太医官问道：“病势已看出矣，但不知用何药治之？”行者道：</p>

<p>“不必执方，见药就要。”医官道：“经云药有八百八味，人有四百四病。病不在一人之身，药岂有全用之理！如何见药就要？”</p>

<p>行者道：“古人云，药不执方，合宜而用，故此全征药品，而随便加减也。”那医官不复再言，即出朝门之外，差本衙当值之人，遍晓满城生熟药铺，即将药品，每味各办三斤，送与行者。行者道：“此间不是制药处，可将诸药之数并制药一应器皿，都送入会同馆，交与我师弟二人收下。”医官听命，即将八百八味每味三斤及药碾、药磨、药罗、药乳并乳钵、乳槌之类都送至馆中，一一交付收讫。</p>

<p>行者往殿上请师父同至馆中制药。那长老正自起身，忽见内宫传旨，教阁下留住法师，同宿文华殿，待明朝服药之后，病痊酬谢，倒换关文送行。三藏大惊道：“徒弟啊，此意是留我做当头哩。若医得好，欢喜起送；若医不好，我命休矣。你须仔细上心，精虔制度也！”行者笑道：“师父放心在此受用，老孙自有医国之手。”</p>

<p>好大圣，别了三藏，辞了众臣，径至馆中。八戒迎着笑道：</p>

<p>“师兄，我知道你了。”行者道：“你知甚么？”八戒道：“知你取经之事不果，欲作生涯无本，今日见此处富庶，设法要开药铺哩。”行者喝道：“莫胡说！医好国王，得意处辞朝走路，开甚么药铺！”八戒道：“终不然，这八百八味药，每味三斤，共计二千四百二十四斤，只医一人，能用多少？不知多少年代方吃得了哩！”行者道：“那里用得许多？他那太医院官都是些愚盲之辈，所以取这许多药品，教他没处捉摸，不知我用的是那几味，难识我神妙之方也。”正说处，只见两个馆使，当面跪下道：“请神僧老爷进晚斋。”行者道：“早间那般待我，如今却跪而请之，何也？”馆使叩头道：“老爷来时，下官有眼无珠，不识尊颜。今闻老爷大展三折之肱，治我一国之主，若主上病愈，老爷江山有分，我辈皆臣子也，礼当拜请。”行者见说，欣然登堂上坐，八戒、沙僧分坐左右，摆上斋来。沙僧便问道：“师兄，师父在那里哩？”行者笑道：“师父被国王留住作当头哩，只待医好了病，方才酬谢送行。”沙僧又问：“可有些受用么？”行者道：“国王岂无受用！我来时，他已有三个阁老陪侍左右，请入文华殿去也。”</p>

<p>八戒道：“这等说，还是师父大哩。他倒有阁老陪侍，我们只得两个馆使奉承。且莫管他，让老猪吃顿饱饭也。”兄弟们遂自在受用一番。</p>

<p>天色已晚，行者叫馆使：“收了家火，多办些油蜡，我等到夜静时方好制药。”馆使果送若干油蜡，各命散讫。至半夜，天街人静，万籁无声。八戒道：“哥哥，制何药？赶早干事。我瞌睡了。”行者道：“你将大黄取一两来，碾为细末。”沙僧乃道：</p>

<p>“大黄味苦，性寒无毒，其性沉而不浮，其用走而不守，夺诸郁而无壅滞，定祸乱而致太平，名之曰将军。此行药耳，但恐久病虚弱，不可用此。”行者笑道：“贤弟不知，此药利痰顺气，荡肚中凝滞之寒热。你莫管我，你去取一两巴豆，去壳去膜，捶去油毒，碾为细末来。”八戒道：“巴豆味辛，性热有毒，削坚积，荡肺腑之沉寒，通闭塞，利水谷之道路，乃斩关夺门之将，不可轻用。”行者道：“贤弟，你也不知，此药破结宣肠，能理心膨水胀。</p>

<p>快制来，我还有佐使之味辅之也。”他二人即时将二药碾细道：</p>

<p>“师兄，还用那几十味？”行者道：“不用了。”八戒道：“八百八味，每味三斤，只用此二两，诚为起夺人了。”行者将一个花磁盏子道：“贤弟莫讲，你拿这个盏儿，将锅脐灰刮半盏过来。”八戒道：“要怎的？”行者道：“药内要用。”沙僧道：“小弟不曾见药内用锅灰。”行者道：“锅灰名为百草霜，能调百病，你不知道。”</p>

<p>那呆子真个刮了半盏，又碾细了。行者又将盏子，递与他道：</p>

<p>“你再去把我们的马尿等半盏来。”八戒道：“要他怎的？”行者道：“要丸药。”沙僧又笑道：“哥哥，这事不是耍子。马尿腥臊，如何入得药品？我只见醋糊为丸，陈米糊为丸，炼蜜为丸，或只是清水为丸，那曾见马尿为丸？那东西腥腥臊臊，脾虚的人，一闻就吐；再服巴豆大黄，弄得人上吐下泻，可是耍子？”行者道：</p>

<p>“你不知就里，我那马不是凡马，他本是西海龙身。若得他肯去便溺，凭你何疾，服之即愈，但急不可得耳。”八戒闻言，真个去到马边。那马斜伏地下睡哩，呆子一顿脚踢起，衬在肚下，等了半会，全不见撒尿。他跑将来对行者说：“哥啊，且莫去医皇帝，且快去医医马来。那亡人干结了，莫想尿得出一点儿！”行者笑道：“我和你去。”沙僧道：“我也去看看。”三人都到马边，那马跳将起来，口吐人言，厉声高叫道：“师兄，你岂不知？我本是西海飞龙，因为犯了天条，观音菩萨救了我，将我锯了角，退了鳞，变作马，驮师父往西天取经，将功折罪。我若过水撒尿，水中游鱼食了成龙；过山撒尿，山中草头得味，变作灵芝，仙僮采去长寿。我怎肯在此尘俗之处轻抛却也？”行者道：“兄弟谨言，此间乃西方国王，非尘俗也，亦非轻抛弃也。常言道，众毛攒裘，要与本国之王治病哩。医得好时，大家光辉，不然，恐惧不得善离此地也。”那马才叫声“等着！”你看他往前扑了一扑，往后蹲了一蹲，咬得那满口牙龁支支的响喨，仅努出几点儿，将身立起。八戒道：“这个亡人！就是金汁子，再撒些儿也罢！”那行者见有少半盏，道：“彀了！彀了！拿去罢。”沙僧方才欢喜。</p>

<p>三人回至厅上，把前项药饵搅和一处，搓了三个大丸子。行者道：“兄弟，忒大了。”八戒道：“只有核桃大，若论我吃，还不彀一口哩！”遂此收在一个小盒儿里。兄弟们连衣睡下，一夜无词。</p>

<p>早是天晓，却说那国王耽病设朝，请唐僧见了，即命众官快往会同馆参拜神僧孙长老取药去。多官随至馆中，对行者拜伏于地道：“我王特命臣等拜领妙剂。”行者叫八戒取盒儿，揭开盖子，递与多官。多官启问：“此药何名？好见王回话。”行者道：“此名乌金丹。”八戒二人暗中作笑道：“锅灰拌的，怎么不是乌金！”多官又问道：“用何引子？”行者道：“药引儿两般都下得。有一般易取者，乃六物煎汤送下。”多官问：“是何六物？”行者道：“半空飞的老鸦屁，紧水负的鲤鱼尿，王母娘娘搽脸粉，老君炉里炼丹灰，玉皇戴破的头巾要三块，还要五根困龙须：</p>

<p>六物煎汤送此药，你王忧病等时除。”多官闻言道：“此物乃世间所无者，请问那一般引子是何？”行者道：“用无根水送下。”</p>

<p>众官笑道：“这个易取。”行者道：“怎见得易取？”多官道：“我这里人家俗论；若用无根水，将一个碗盏，到井边，或河下，舀了水急转步，更不落地，亦不回头，到家与病人吃药便是。”行者道：“井中河内之水，俱是有根的。我这无根水，非此之论，乃是天上落下者，不沾地就吃，才叫做无根水。”多官又道：“这也容易。等到天阴下雨时，再吃药便罢了。”遂拜谢了行者，将药持回献上。国王大喜，即命近侍接上来。看了道：“此是甚么丸子？”多官道：“神僧说是乌金丹，用无根水送下。”国王便教宫人取无根水，众官道：“神僧说，无根水不是井河中者，乃是天上落下不沾地的才是。”国王即唤当驾官传旨，教请法官求雨。</p>

<p>众官遵依出榜不题。</p>

<p>却说行者在会同馆厅上叫猪八戒道：“适间允他天落之水，才可用药，此时急忙，怎么得个雨水？我看这王，倒也是个大贤大德之君，我与你助他些儿雨下药，如何？”八戒道：“怎么样助？”行者道：“你在我左边立下，做个辅星。”又叫沙僧，“你在我右边立下，做个弼宿，等老孙助他些无根水儿。”好大圣，步了罡诀，念声咒语，早见那正东上，一朵乌云，渐近于头顶上。叫道：“大圣，东海龙王敖广来见。”行者道：“无事不敢捻烦，请你来助些无根水与国王下药。”龙王道：“大圣呼唤时，不曾说用水，小龙只身来了，不曾带得雨器，亦未有风云雷电，怎生降雨？”行者道：“如今用不着风云雷电，亦不须多雨，只要些须引药之水便了。”龙王道：“既如此，待我打两个喷涕，吐些涎津溢，与他吃药罢。”行者大喜道：“最好！最好！不必迟疑，趁早行事。”那老龙在空中，渐渐低下乌云，直至皇宫之上，隐身潜象，噀一口津唾，遂化作甘霖。那满朝官齐声喝采道：“我主万千之喜！天公降下甘雨来也！”国王即传旨，教：“取器皿盛着，不拘宫内外及官大小，都要等贮仙水，拯救寡人。”你看那文武多官并三宫六院妃嫔与三千彩女，八百娇娥，一个个擎杯托盏，举碗持盘，等接甘雨。那老龙在半空，运化津涎，不离了王宫前后，将有一个时辰，龙王辞了大圣回海。众臣将杯盂碗盏收来，也有等着一点两点者，也有等着三点五点者，也有一点不曾等着者，共合一处，约有三盏之多，总献至御案。真个是异香满袭金銮殿，佳味熏飘天子庭！</p>

<p>那国王辞了法师，将着乌金丹并甘雨至宫中，先吞了一丸，吃了一盏甘雨；再吞了一丸，又饮了一盏甘雨；三次，三丸俱吞了，三盏甘雨俱送下。不多时，腹中作响，如辘轳之声不绝，即取净桶，连行了三五次，服了些米饮，敧倒在龙床之上。</p>

<p>有两个妃子，将净桶捡看，说不尽那秽污痰涎，内有糯米饭块一团。妃子近龙床前来报：“病根都行下来也！”国王闻此言甚喜，又进一次米饭。少顷，渐觉心胸宽泰，气血调和，就精神抖擞，脚力强健。下了龙床，穿上朝服，即登宝殿见了唐僧，辄倒身下拜。那长老忙忙还礼。拜毕以御手搀着，便教阁下：“快具简帖，帖上写朕再拜顿首字样，差官奉请法师高徒三位。一壁厢大开东阁，光禄寺排宴酬谢。”多官领旨，具简的具简，排宴的排宴，正是国家有倒山之力，霎时俱完。</p>

<p>却说八戒见官投简，喜不自胜道：“哥啊，果是好妙药！今来酬谢，乃兄长之功。”沙僧道：“二哥说那里话！常言道，一人有福，带挈一屋。我们在此合药，俱是有功之人，只管受用去，再休多话。”咦！你看他弟兄们俱欢欢喜喜，径入朝来。众官接引，上了东阁，早见唐僧、国王、阁老，已都在那里安排筵宴哩。</p>

<p>这行者与八戒、沙僧，对师父唱了个喏，随后众官都至，只见那上面有四张素桌面，都是吃一看十的筵席；前面有一张荤桌面，也是吃一看十的珍馐。左右有四五百张单桌面，真个排得齐整：古云珍馐百味，美禄千锺。琼膏酥酪，锦缕肥红。宝妆花彩艳，果品味香浓。斗糖龙缠列狮仙，饼锭拖炉摆凤侣。荤有猪羊鸡鹅鱼鸭般般肉，素有蔬肴笋芽木耳并蘑菇。几样香汤饼，数次透酥糖。滑软黄粱饭，清新菰米糊。色色粉汤香又辣，般般添换美还甜。君臣举盏方安席，名分品级慢传壶。那国王御手擎杯，先与唐僧安坐，三藏道：“贫僧不会饮酒。”国王道：</p>

<p>“素酒，法师饮此一杯，何如？”三藏道：“酒乃僧家第一戒。”国王甚不过意道：“法师戒饮，却以何物为敬？”三藏道：“顽徒三众代饮罢。”国王却才欢喜，转金卮，递与行者。行者接了酒，对众礼毕，吃了一杯。国王见他吃得爽利，又奉一杯。行者不辞，又吃了。国王笑道：“吃个三宝锺儿。”行者不辞，又吃了。国王又叫斟上，“吃个四季杯儿。”八戒在旁见酒不到他，忍得他啯啯咽唾，又见那国王苦劝行者，他就叫将起来道：“陛下，吃的药也亏了我，那药里有马——”这行者听说，恐怕呆子走了消息，却将手中酒递与八戒。八戒接着就吃，却不言语。国王问道：“神僧说药里有马，是甚么马？”行者接过口来道：“我这兄弟，是这般口敞，但有个经验的好方儿，他就要说与人。陛下早间吃药，内有马兜铃。”国王问众官道：“马兜铃是何品味？能医何证？”时有太医院官在旁道：“主公：兜铃味苦寒无毒，定喘消痰大有功。通气最能除血盅，补虚宁嗽又宽中。”国王笑道：“用得当！用得当！猪长老再饮一杯。”呆子亦不言语，却也吃了个三宝锺。国王又递了沙僧酒，也吃了三杯，却俱叙坐。</p>

<p>饮宴多时，国王又擎大爵奉与行者。行者道：“陛下请坐，老孙依巡痛饮，决不敢推辞。”国王道：“神僧恩重如山，寡人酬谢不尽，好歹进此一巨觥，朕有话说。”行者道：“有甚话说了，老孙好饮。”国王道：“寡人有数载忧疑病，被神僧一贴灵丹打通，所以就好了。”行者笑道：“昨日老孙看了陛下，已知是忧疑之疾，但不知忧惊何事？”国王道：“古人云，家丑不可外谈，奈神僧是朕恩主，惟不笑方可告之。”行者道：“怎敢笑话，请说无妨。”国王道：“神僧东来，不知经过几个邦国？”行者道：“经有五六处。”又问：“他国之后，不知是何称呼。”行者道：“国王之后，都称为正宫、东宫、西宫。”国王道：“寡人不是这等称呼：将正宫称为金圣宫，东宫称为玉圣宫，西宫称为银圣宫。现今只有银、玉二后在宫。”行者道：“金圣宫因何不在宫中？”国王滴泪道：“不在已三年矣。”行者道：“向那厢去了？”国王道：“三年前，正值端阳之节，朕与嫔后都在御花园海榴亭下解粽插艾，饮菖蒲雄黄酒，看斗龙舟。忽然一阵风至，半空中现出一个妖精，自称赛太岁，说他在麒麟山獬豸洞居住，洞中少个夫人，访得我金圣宫生得貌美姿娇，要做个夫人，教朕快早送出。如若三声不献出来，就要先吃寡人，后吃众臣，将满城黎民，尽皆吃绝。那时节，朕却忧国忧民，无奈将金圣宫推出海榴亭外，被那妖响一声摄将去了。寡人为此着了惊恐，把那粽子凝滞在内，况又昼夜忧思不息，所以成此苦疾三年。今得神僧灵丹服后，行了数次，尽是那三年前积滞之物，所以这会体健身轻，精神如旧。今日之命，皆是神僧所赐，岂但如泰山之重而已乎！”行者闻得此言，满心喜悦，将那巨觥之酒，两口吞之，笑问国王曰：“陛下原来是这等惊忧！今遇老孙，幸而获愈，但不知可要金圣宫回国？”那国王滴泪道：“朕切切思思，无昼无夜，但只是没一个能获得妖精的。岂有不要他回国之理！”行者道：“我老孙与你去伏妖邪，那时何如？”国王跪下道：“若救得朕后，朕愿领三宫九嫔，出城为民，将一国江山尽付神僧，让你为帝。”八戒在旁见出此言行此礼，忍不住呵呵大笑道：“这皇帝失了体统！怎么为老婆就不要江山，跪着和尚？”行者急上前，将国王搀起道：“陛下，那妖精自得金圣宫去后，这一向可曾再来？”国王道：“他前年五月节摄了金圣宫，至十月间来，要取两个宫娥，是说伏侍娘娘，朕即献出两个。至旧年三月间，又来要两个宫娥；七月间，又要去两个；今年二月里，又要去两个；不知到几时又要来也。”行者道：“似他这等频来，你们可怕他么？”国王道：“寡人见他来得多遭，一则惧怕，二来又恐有伤害之意，旧年四月内，是朕命工起了一座避妖楼，但闻风响，知是他来，即与二后九嫔入楼躲避。”行者道：“陛下不弃，可携老孙去看那避妖楼一番，何如？”那国王即将左手携着行者出席，众官亦皆起身。猪八戒道：“哥哥，你不达理！这般御酒不吃，摇席破坐的，且去看甚么哩？”国王闻说，情知八戒是为嘴，即命当驾官抬两张素桌面，看酒在避妖楼外伺候。呆子却才不嚷，同师父沙僧笑道：“翻席去也。”</p>

<p>一行文武官引导，那国王并行者相搀，穿过皇宫到了御花园后，更不见楼台殿阁。行者道：“避妖楼何在？”说不了，只见两个太监，拿两根红漆扛子，往那空地上掬起一块四方石板。</p>

<p>国王道：“此间便是。这底下有三丈多深，槃成的九间朝殿，内有四个大缸，缸内满注清油，点着灯火，昼夜不息。寡人听得风响，就入里边躲避，外面着人盖上石板。”行者笑道：“那妖精还是不害你，若要害你，这里如何躲得？”正说间，只见那正南上呼呼的，吹得风响，播土扬尘，唬得那多官齐声报怨道：“这和尚盐酱口，讲起甚么妖精，妖精就来了！”慌得那国王丢了行者，即钻入地穴，唐僧也就跟入，众官亦躲个干净。八戒、沙僧也都要躲，被行者左右手扯住他两个道，“兄弟们，不要怕得，我和你认他一认，看是个甚么妖精。”八戒道：“可是扯淡！认他怎的？众官躲了，师父藏了，国王避了，我们不去了罢，炫的是那家世！”那呆子左挣右挣，挣不得脱手，被行者拿定多时，只见那半空里闪出一个妖精。你看他怎生模样：九尺长身多恶狞，一双环眼闪金灯。两轮查耳如撑扇，四个钢牙似插钉。鬓绕红毛眉竖焰，鼻垂精准孔开明，髭髯几缕朱砂线，颧骨崚嶒满面青。两臂红筋蓝靛手，十条尖爪把枪擎。豹皮裙子腰间系，赤脚蓬头若鬼形。行者见了道：“沙僧，你可认得他？”沙僧道：</p>

<p>“我又不曾与他相识，那里认得！”又问：“八戒，你可认得他？”</p>

<p>八戒道：“我又不曾与他会茶会酒，又不是宾朋邻里，我怎么认得他！”行者道：“他却象东岳天齐手下把门的那个醮面金睛鬼。”八戒道：“不是！不是！”行者道：“你怎知他不是？”八戒道：</p>

<p>“我岂不知，鬼乃阴灵也，一日至晚，交申酉戌亥时方出。今日还在巳时，那里有鬼敢出来？就是鬼，也不会驾云。纵会弄风，也只是一阵旋风耳，有这等狂风？或者他就是赛太岁也。”行者笑道：“好呆子！倒也有些论头！既如此说，你两个护持在此，等老孙去问他个名号，好与国王救取金圣宫来朝。”八戒道：</p>

<p>“你去自去，切莫供出我们来。”行者昂然不答，急纵祥光，跳将上去。咦！正是：安邦先却君王病，守道须除爱恶心。毕竟不知此去，到于空中，胜败如何，怎么擒得妖怪，救得金圣宫，且听下回分解。</p>
