<P>The Buddha-Nature Traveling West Enters Womankind</P>
<P>The Mind-Ape Makes a Plan to Escape from the Beauties</P>
</div>
<P>When Sanzang and his disciples left the cottage they headed West, and about a dozen miles later they entered the country of Western Liang. &#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said the Tang Priest on his horse, &#8220;there is a city not far ahead, and I can hear a great hubbub of voices from the marketplace. You must all be very, very careful and on your best behavior. Do not make nonsense of the teachings of our Buddhist faith by running wild or becoming infatuated.&#8221; The three disciples were determined to obey his instructions.</P>
<P>Before the Tang Priest had finished speaking they reached the street leading in from the Eastern gate. Everyone they saw was wearing a skirt and a woman's jacket, a powdered face and oiled hair. All the people, young and old, were women. When those buying and selling in the street saw the four of them coming they started to applaud, laugh and say with smiles all over their faces, &#8220;Men, men!&#8221; Sanzang was so alarmed that he reined in his horse, unable to go any further forward. In a moment the streets were packed and the air was ringing with happy voices.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm a gelded pig, a gelded pig!&#8221; yelled Pig in a panic.</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop that nonsense, idiot,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Just show them your face the way it used to be.&#8221; Pig then shook his head a couple of times, stuck up his ears shaped like reed fans, twisted his bristly, dropping snout and give a roar that made all the women collapse with fright. There is a poem to prove it that goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The monk came to Western Liang on his way to the Buddha;</P>
<P>The streets were a feminine world where males were not seen.</P>
<P>Peasants, scholars and artisans, merchants and fisherfolk,</P>
<P>Woodcutters, tillers and stock-raisers&#8212;all were women.</P>
<P>The beauties poured into the streets to welcome the men;</P>
<P>Young women come in crowds to hail the handsome groom.</P>
<P>If Wuneng had not made full use of his hideous face,</P>
<P>The pilgrims could not have withstood a siege by the ladies.</P>
<P>The women were then all so frightened that they dared not approach.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Clutching their hands, stooping, shaking their heads, chewing at their fingers, trembling and shaking they blocked the streets to look at the Tang Priest. The Great Sage Monkey also pulled a hideous face to clear a way for them, helped by grimaces from Friar Sand. Leading the horse, pig stuck out his snout and was flapping his ears. As they moved forward they saw that the buildings along the city streets were well-built and the shop fronts imposing. There were grocers and corn-chandlers, bars and teahouses, multi-storied shops where everything was sold, towers and fine mansions with well-draped windows.</P>
<P>Master and disciples turned one corner to come up against a female official standing in the street and shouting. &#8220;Envoys from afar, you may not enter the city gates without permission. Please go to the government post station and register your names so that I can report them to Her Majesty. When they have been examined you will be allowed to proceed.&#8221; Hearing this, Sanzang dismounted and saw that the words MALE-WELCOMING POST STATION were written on a board across the door of the official building.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said the venerable elder, &#8220;what the village people told us was true. There really is a Male-welcoming Post Station.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother Pig,&#8221; chuckled Friar Sand, &#8220;you'd better look in the Pregnancy-revealing Spring to see if you have a double reflection.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop trying to make a fool of me,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;I aborted after drinking the water from Miscarriage Spring. What would I need to look for?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Watch your words, Wuneng, watch your words,&#8221; said Sanzang, turning back to give Pig his instructions before going forward and greeting the official.</P>
<P>She led them into the main hall of the post station, where they sat down and tea was sent for. Here too the staff all had their hair in bunches and wore skirts. There were many smiles as the tea was brought. A little later, when it had been drunk, the official gave a slight bow as she sat there and asked, &#8220;On what business have you emissaries come?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We are envoys sent to the Western Heaven by the Great Tang emperor in the East to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;My master Tang Sanzang is the Tang emperor's younger brother. I am Sun Wukong, his senior disciple, and these two are my fellows, Zhu Wuneng, Pig, and Sha Wujing, Friar Sand. If you count the horse there are five of us altogether. We are carrying a passport with us that we beg to have inspected so that we may be allowed to continue on our way.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the woman official had finished writing all this down she dropped to her knees to kowtow to them and said, &#8220;Forgive me, my lords. I am only the superintendent of the Male-welcoming Post Station and I did not realize that you were gentlemen from a superior country who deserved to be met at a great distance from here.&#8221; She rose to her feet and ordered the staff to provide them with food and drink. &#8220;Please make yourselves comfortable, my lords, while I go into the city to report to our queen. Then your document will be dealt with and you will be seen on your way West with rich presents.&#8221; Sanzang was happy to sit there.</P>
<P>The superintendent neatened her clothes and went straight into the city to the Tower of Five Phoenixes at the palace entrance, where she said to the gate officer, &#8220;I am the superintendent of the Male-welcoming Post Station and I would like an audience with Her Majesty on a certain matter.&#8221; The gate officer reported this to the queen at once, at which the superintendent was summoned straight to the throne hall to be asked what it was she had come to say.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your humble subject,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;has received in her post station Tang Sanzang the younger brother of the Tang emperor in the East. He has three disciples called Sun Wukong, Zhu Wuneng and Sha Wujing and a horse, making five of them altogether. They wish to go to the Western Heaven to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures. I have come especially to submit a memorial to Your Majesty asking whether they may be allowed to submit their passport for approval and proceed on their way.&#8221;</P>
<P>The queen was delighted at his report, and she said to her civil officials, &#8220;We dreamed last night of a gold screen shining with colours and a jade mirror full of light. They must have been good omens of what has happened today.&#8221;</P>
<P>The women officials crowded round the steps of the throne and said with kowtows, &#8220;Your Majesty, how can you tell that they were good omens for today?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This man from the East,&#8221; the queen replied, &#8220;is the younger brother of the Tang emperor. Since primal chaos was first cleared we have never seen a man in our country under all the queens who have reigned here. The fortunate arrival of the Tang emperor's younger brother must be a gift from Heaven. I have decided to use our country's wealth to persuade the emperor's brother to become king with me as his queen. Then we can unite the male and the female and produce sons and grandsons to pass the throne on to. So weren't they good omens?&#8221; The joyful women officials all performed dances of obeisance.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty's idea of passing the throne on to future generations in an excellent one,&#8221; the superintendent of the post station further submitted, &#8220;but the three hideous disciples of the emperor's younger brother are not at all attractive.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What does the emperor's brother look like,&#8221; the queen asked, &#8220;and how are the disciples so unattractive?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The emperor's brother has a handsome face and an impressive bearing,&#8221; the superintendent replied. &#8220;He really does look like a man from a great country ruled by a heaven-sent dynasty, a son of China in the Southern Jambu continent. But the three disciples look thoroughly vicious with faces like demons.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said the queen, &#8220;give presents to his disciples, return their passport, and send them on their way to the Western Heaven. Keep only the emperor's brother here. Is there any reason why we should not?&#8221;</P>
<P>To this the officials bowed low and replied, &#8220;Your Majesty's ideas are completely right and your subjects will respectfully implement them. The only difficulty is that we have no matchmaker to arrange the marriage. As the old saying goes</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Marriage and mating depend on red leaves;</P>
<P>A matchmaker ties the threads between husband and wife.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;From what you suggest,&#8221; the queen replied, &#8220;the royal tutor should be invited to be matchmaker, and the superintendent of the Male-welcoming Post Station will be the mistress of ceremonies. Go to the post station and ask for the consent of the emperor's younger brother. When he has agreed we shall go out of the city in our carriage to greet him.&#8221; The tutor and the superintendent left the palace to carry out their instructions.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sanzang and his disciples were just enjoying a vegetarian meal in the hall of the post station when someone was heard outside announcing the arrival of the queen's tutor and the superintendent.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why is the queen's tutor here?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Perhaps it's an invitation from the queen,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;It's either that or a proposal of marriage,&#8221; said Brother Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;But if she tries to force me to marry her and refuses to let us go what am I to do, Wukong?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Just agree, Master,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'll find a way to cope.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before, they had finished their conversation the two women officials entered and bowed low to the venerable elder, who returned their courtesies and said, &#8220;I am a humble monk. What wonderful powers do I have that you should bow to me thus?&#8221;</P>
<P>The queen's tutor was discreetly delighted with his noble bearing, thinking, &#8220;Our country will indeed be very fortunate if this man is to become our queen's husband.&#8221; When the two officials had finished bowing they stood on either side of Sanzang and said, &#8220;Imperial brother, many, many congratulations.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am a monk,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;so what good fortune is there to congratulate me on?&#8221;</P>
<P>Bowing again, the queen's tutor said, &#8220;This is Womanland of Western Liang, and no man has ever come here before. As Your Excellency the emperor's brother has graced us with your presence I am here on the orders of Her Majesty the queen to propose marriage.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Good gracious!&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;I have come to your distinguished country with no children apart from my three boorish disciples. Which of them is it that Her Majesty wishes to marry?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have just been to the palace to report,&#8221; the superintendent of the post station said, &#8220;and our queen was very, very happy. She said that last night she had an auspicious dream in which a golden screen shone with many colours, and a jade mirror was full of light. When she learned that Your Excellency the emperor's brother was a man from the great land of Tang she decided to offer you all the wealth of our country to persuade you to stay here as her husband and sit on the throne. Her Majesty would become queen consort. The royal tutor was commissioned to act as matchmaker and I was made mistress of ceremonies. We are here to ask for your hand.&#8221; At this Sanzang bowed his head in silence.</P>
<P>&#8220;A true man does not throw away his chance,&#8221; the queen's tutor said. &#8220;There is nothing unusual about a man being asked to marry a woman and live in her house, but rarely does it happen that one is offered the wealth of a state to do so. I beg the emperor's brother to assent quickly so that I may report back to Her Majesty.&#8221; The venerable elder seemed to have been struck dumb.</P>
<P>Pig, who was standing beside them, put his hands to his snout and called, &#8220;Tutor, please report back to Her Majesty that my master is an arhat who has long cultivated the Way. He's not interested in your country's wealth or in Her Majesty's great beauty. Hurry up and return our passport and send him on his way to the West. You can keep me here to be her husband. What about it?&#8221; The suggestion made the tutor tremble. She was speechless with shock.</P>
<P>&#8220;You may be a man,&#8221; the superintendent said, &#8220;but you are much too ugly for Her Majesty.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't understand,&#8221; said pig. &#8220;Thick willow twigs make dustpans and fine ones make funnels. There's a use for everything. There's not a man in all the world who's really ugly.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Idiot,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;stop that nonsense. Let our master decide. If he agrees the wedding is on, and if he doesn't it's off. Don't waste the matchmaker's time.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;you decide.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you ask me,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;you'd be very well off here. As the old saying goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A thousand miles can't keep apart</P>
<P>A couple that's fated to wed:</P>
<P>Their lives and destinies are tied</P>
<P>By a long and invisible thread.</P>
<P>Where else will you find a place that offers you this much?&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;if we stay here out of a love for wealth and status who will go to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures? Would that not be a terrible thing to do to our Great Tang emperor?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Excellency,&#8221; the royal tutor replied, &#8220;I must tell you the truth. Our queen only intends to marry you, the emperor's brother. Your three disciples will be invited to the wedding banquet, given presents, have their passport returned, and be allowed to go on their journey to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What the royal tutor says is right,&#8221; replied Monkey. &#8220;We three mustn't make difficulties. We'll let our master stay here as the queen's husband. Hurry up and return us our travel document so that we can be on our way West. We will pay our respects to Her Majesty on our way back with the scriptures, and ask for some money for the journey back to the Great Tang.&#8221;</P>
<P>The royal tutor and the superintendent both bowed to Monkey and said, &#8220;We are very grateful to you, sir, for your helpfulness.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Tutor,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;don't just talk about feeding us. Now that we've agreed, get your mistress to lay on a banquet so that we can all drink a cup of betrothal wine. What about it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said the tutor, &#8220;a banquet will be provided.&#8221; The superintendent and the tutor returned in great delight to report back to the queen.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sanzang meanwhile grabbed Monkey and started abusing him. &#8220;You're trying to kill me, you ape. How could you say things like that? Making me stay here to be her husband while you go to the Western Heaven to worship the Buddha! I'd die before I agreed to do that.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry, Master,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Of course I know your nature. But faced with people like that in a place like this I had to play them at their own game.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean by playing them at their own game?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you had been obstinate and refused her she would not have returned our travel paper or let us continue on our way,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;If she had turned vicious and called on all her underlings to slice your flesh off to make perfume bags or whatever we'd never have earned a good reward. We'd have had to use our magic powers for subduing and killing demons. You know how hard we hit and how murderous our weapons are. Once we got going we'd have wiped out everyone in the whole country. But they're people, not demons, even if they are blocking our way. And all along this journey you've been good and merciful&#8212;you haven't killed a single soul. How could you bear to kill so many innocent people? That really would be evil.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; replied Sanzang, &#8220;that is a very fine argument. But I'm afraid that when the queen takes me into her palace she will want me to perform my conjugal duties. I could not possibly lose my primal masculinity and ruin my conduct as a Buddhist monk, or let my true seed escape and destroy my status in the faith.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As you have agreed to the marriage she is bound to treat you as king and come out in her carriage to fetch you,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;You must on no account refuse. Take your seat in the phoenix and dragon carriage, enter the throne hall, and sit on the throne facing South as monarch. Tell the queen to fetch her royal seals and write an invitation summoning us to court. Stamp our travel permit with the official seal and ask her to sign it herself and return it to us. Have a banquet laid on as a celebration for yourself and the queen and to say farewell to us too. When the banquet is over have the carriage got ready and tell her that when you have seen us three out of the city you will be coming back to sleep with her. This will put the queen and her subjects into such a good mood that they won't try to keep us any more, let alone have any evil intentions towards us. When you have escorted us out of the city, get out of the carriage. Tell Friar Sand to stay with you and help you mount the white horse while I use some immobilizing magic to stop the queen and her subjects from moving. Then we can carry on West along the main road, and when we've been travelling for a day and a night I'll say a spell to undo the magic and revive them so that they can go back into the city. This way none of them will be killed and you won't have to harm your essential spirit. This is what they call a plan to 'slip through the net with a false marriage.' It works both ways, doesn't it?&#8221;</P>
<P>These words sobered Sanzang up and woke him from his dream. He forgot his worries and thanked Monkey profusely: &#8220;I am profoundly grateful to you, good disciple, for your brilliant suggestion.&#8221; Now that the four of them had agreed on a plan we shall leave them discussing it.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The queen's tutor and the post station superintendent went straight through the gates of the palace to the steps of the throne without waiting to be summoned. &#8220;Your Majesty's auspicious dream was completely justified,&#8221; they announced. &#8220;You two will be as happy together as fish and water.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the queen heard their report she lifted the pearl curtain, came down from her dragon throne, and gave a smile that opened her cherry lips and showed her silvery teeth as she asked in her charming voice, &#8220;What did the emperor's brother say when you spoke to him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When we reached the post station and had bowed to the emperor's brother,&#8221; the queen's tutor replied, &#8220;we told him of the proposal of marriage. He tried to decline it, but fortunately his senior disciple agreed on his behalf. He would like his master to marry Your Majesty and sit on the throne as king. He asked that you should first return their passport and send the three disciples on their way West. When they come back with the scriptures they will pay their respects to their master and Your Majesty and ask for some money for their journey back to Great Tang.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What did the emperor's brother say to that?&#8221; the queen asked with a smile.</P>
<P>&#8220;He did not speak,&#8221; the tutor replied, &#8220;but he is willing to marry Your Majesty. The only thing is that his second disciple wants a betrothal feast first.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the queen heard this she ordered the office that dealt with foreign relations to lay on a banquet. She also had the state carriage prepared to take her out of the city to welcome her lord and husband. The female officials obediently swept the palace clean and laid on a banquet in the hall. Those who were setting out the banquet moved as fast as fire, and those who were preparing the chariot did so with the speed of shooting stars. Western Liang was a country of women, but its state carriage was no less splendid than a Chinese one:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Six dragons snorting out coloured clouds,</P>
<P>A pair of phoenixes full of good omen.</P>
<P>The six dragons supported the carriage as it came out,</P>
<P>The pair of phoenixes were riding upon it.</P>
<P>Fragrant were the perfumes,</P>
<P>Dense the clouds of auspicious vapor.</P>
<P>Officials with goldfish-shaped pendants of jade now crowded around;</P>
<P>The women were all drawn up with their hair full of ornaments.</P>
<P>Mandarin-duck fans gave shade to the carriage,</P>
<P>While curtains of jade and pearl did shelter the queen.</P>
<P>Beautifully sounded the songs to the panpipes</P>
<P>While strings and woodwinds all played in harmony.</P>
<P>A surge of joy soared up to the heavens;</P>
<P>Boundless bliss poured out from the heart.</P>
<P>The triple silken canopy shook the sky;</P>
<P>Brilliant banners cast their light on the throne steps.</P>
<P>Never before had the marriage cup here been drunk;</P>
<P>Today the queen would be taking a husband.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The carriage soon left the city and reached the Male-welcoming Post Station. At once the queen's arrival was announced to Sanzang and his disciples, who straightened up their clothes and came out to meet the queen's carriage. The queen raised the curtain and came out. &#8220;Which of these gentlemen is the Tang emperor's brother?&#8221; she asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The gentleman in front of the post station who is wearing a long gown,&#8221; the tutor replied. The queen took a very careful look at him with her phoenix eyes, her moth-eyebrows raised. He was indeed an exceptional sight. Look at him:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A noble manner,</P>
<P>Distinguished features.</P>
<P>White teeth as if made of silver,</P>
<P>A square-cut mouth with lips of red.</P>
<P>The top of the head flat, the forehead broad and ample;</P>
<P>Fine eyes, a clear brow, and a long jaw.</P>
<P>His ears had the round lobes of a great man;</P>
<P>His body was that of one with no ordinary talent.</P>
<P>A handsome, intelligent and gallant gentleman;</P>
<P>The ideal consort for the graceful queen.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As the queen was gazing at him with delight and admiration she felt a great surge of desire and passion. Opening her cherry lips she said, &#8220;Younger brother of the Great Tang emperor, won't you ride in my royal carriage?&#8221; This made Sanzang blush from ear to ear. He was too embarrassed to look up at her.</P>
<P>Pig, who was standing beside him, put his hands to his snout and devoured the queen with his eyes. She was a slim beauty:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Brows like green willow,</P>
<P>Flesh like mutton fat,</P>
<P>Cheeks set off with plum blossom,</P>
<P>Hair like the plumage of a golden phoenix.</P>
<P>The autumn waves of her eyes were full of charm;</P>
<P>Like bamboo shoot in spring was her graceful posture.</P>
<P>Red tassels floated with elegance over her temples,</P>
<P>Pearls and kingfisher feathers adorned her high-piled hair.</P>
<P>Why talk now of the Princess Zhaojun's beauty?</P>
<P>This queen is lovelier than the legendary Xi Shi.</P>
<P>As her willow waist gently bends gold pendants tinkle;</P>
<P>Her lotus feet move lightly with her limbs of jade.</P>
<P>The Lady of the Moon could not compare with her;</P>
<P>No heavenly fairy could be her match.</P>
<P>Her exquisite palace clothes were not those of a mere mortal;</P>
<P>She was the Queen Mother of the West come to the Jade Pool.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Seeing how beautiful she was the idiot could not help drooling. His heart pounded and his limbs went weak; he melted like a snow lion next to a bonfire.</P>
<P>When the queen came closer to Sanzang she took hold of him and said in a most beguiling voice, &#8220;Dear emperor's brother, won't you come into my dragon coach, ride back with me to the throne hall and marry me?&#8221; The venerable elder trembled, feeling unsteady on his feet. It was as if he were drunk or stupefied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be so shy and modest, Master,&#8221; urged monkey, who was standing beside him. &#8220;Please get into the carriage with your future wife. Have our passport returned to us as soon as possible so that we can continue on our journey to fetch the scriptures.&#8221; Sanzang could not bring himself to reply as he put his hand on Monkey, unable to hold back his tears.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be so upset, Master,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;Here's your chance to enjoy wealth and honour, so make the most of it.&#8221; Sanzang had no choice but to do as Monkey bade him. Wiping his tears away he forced himself to smile as he stepped forward to</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Hold the queen's white hand</P>
<P>Sitting in the dragon carriage.</P>
<P>The queen was in raptures at the prospect of a husband;</P>
<P>The elder in his terror wanted only to worship the Buddha.</P>
<P>One longed to embrace her man in the candle-lit bedroom;</P>
<P>The other wanted to see the</P>
<P>World-honoured on Vulture Peak.</P>
<P>The queen was sincere,</P>
<P>The holy monk was pretending.</P>
<P>The queen in her sincerity</P>
<P>Hoped that they would grow old in harmony together.</P>
<P>The holy monk pretending</P>
<P>Controlled his tender feeling to nourish his primal spirit.</P>
<P>One was so happy to see her husband</P>
<P>She wished they could be man and wife in broad daylight.</P>
<P>The other was afraid of woman's beauty,</P>
<P>Longing to escape her clutches and climb to the Thunder Monastery.</P>
<P>The two ascended the carriage together,</P>
<P>But the Tang Priest's intentions were far away.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the civil and military officers saw their mistress enter the royal coach with the venerable Sanzang sitting beside her their faces were all wreathed in smiles. The procession turned around and went back into the city. Monkey told Friar Sand to carry the luggage while he led the horse as they followed behind the coach. Pig rushed wildly ahead, and when he reached the Tower of Five Phoenixes he started shouting, &#8220;This is very fine and splendid, but it won't do, it won't do at all. We've got to have some wedding drinks to toast the groom.&#8221;</P>
<P>He so alarmed the women officials carrying ceremonial insignia who were leading the procession that they all went back to the queen's carriage to report, &#8220;Your Majesty, the one with big ears and a long snout is making a row in front of the Tower of Five Phoenixes and demanding wedding drinks.&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing this the queen leant her fragrant shoulder against Sanzang, pressed her peach-blossom cheek against his, and opened her sandalwood-scented mouth to murmur in her seductive voice, &#8220;Dear emperor's brother, is the one with big ears and a long snout one of your distinguished disciples?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He is my second disciple,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;He has an enormous appetite, and he has spent all his life trying to get good things to eat. We must lay on some food and drink for him before we can get on with things.&#8221; The queen then asked anxiously if the office dealing with foreign relation had yet prepared the banquet.</P>
<P>&#8220;It is ready,&#8221; the women officials reported. &#8220;It is set out on the Eastern hall and includes both meat and vegetarian dishes.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why both sorts?&#8221; the queen asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your subjects thought that the Tang emperor's brother and his distinguished disciples might be vegetarians,&#8221; the officials replied. &#8220;That was why we had both sorts of food provided.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Dear emperor's brother,&#8221; said the queen with another little laugh of pleasure as she rubbed herself against Sanzang's fragrant cheek, &#8220;do you eat meat or vegetarian food?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I eat vegetarian food,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;but I have never given up wine. We must have a few cups of light wine for my second disciple to drink.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before he had finished speaking the queen's tutor said to the queen, &#8220;If it pleases Your Majesty, will you come to the Eastern hall for the banquet? Today is an auspicious day, and at a lucky hour tonight you may marry the emperor's brother. Tomorrow a new ecliptic begins, and I beg that the emperor's younger brother will enter the throne hall tomorrow to take his throne facing South as monarch and inaugurate a new reign.&#8221;</P>
<P>The queen was delighted by this suggestion. Descending from the coach hand-in-hand with Sanzang she went in through the palace's main gate. This is what they saw and heard:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Magic music wafting down from a gallery,</P>
<P>As the turquoise carriage came within the palace.</P>
<P>The phoenix gates stood wide open amid gentle light;</P>
<P>The harem in all its splendor was not closed.</P>
<P>Incense smoke curled aloft in the unicorn hall;</P>
<P>Shadows were moving behind the peacock screen.</P>
<P>The buildings were magnificent as those of a mighty state;</P>
<P>The jade halls and golden horses were even more splendid.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When they reached the Eastern hall the harmonious sounds of panpipes and singing could be heard and two rows of powdered beauties seen. In the middle of the hall two sumptuous banquets were set out; a vegetarian one to the left and a meat one on the right. Below were two rows of individual places. The queen folded back her sleeves, took a jade goblet with her ten delicate fingers, and led Sanzang to the feast. Monkey went up to her and said, &#8220;We are all vegetarians, so would you ask my master to sit at the vegetarian feast to the left while three places are set below him for us three disciples?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, that's right,&#8221; said the queen's tutor. &#8220;Master and disciples are like father and sons. It would be wrong to seat them side by side.&#8221; The women officials quickly rearranged the seating, and the queen gave goblets to each of them as she led them to their places. Monkey gave the Tang Priest a look to remind him to return her courtesies, at which he came down from his seat with a jade goblet in his hand and led the queen to her place. The civil and military officials all kowtowed to the queen in gratitude and took their seats in order of precedence on either side. Only then did the music cease and the toasts begin.</P>
<P>Pig did not worry about anything as he relaxed his belly and ate for all he was worth. He did not care whether it was jadeflake rice, steamed buns, sweet cakes, mushrooms, gill fungus, bamboo shoots, tree-ear fungus, day lilies, agar, laver, turnips, taro, devilpepper, yams or sealwort: he wolfed the whole lot down together. Then he drank some six or seven goblets of wine and shouted, &#8220;Fill it up, bring me another. I want a big goblet. Give me a few more drinks, then we can all go off and do what we've got to do.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What is there so important that makes us have to leave this fine banquet?&#8221; Friar Sand asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;There's an old saying,&#8221; replied the idiot with a grin, &#8220;'that each man should stick to his trade. Some of us are getting married now, and others of us have to be on our way to fetch the scriptures. We mustn't ruin everything for the sake of a few more drinks. We want our passport returned as soon as possible. As they say, 'The warriors stay on their horses, all of them pressing ahead.'&#8220; When the queen heard this she sent for big cups, and the officials in attendance quickly fetched some parrot-shaped goblets, cormorant ladles, golden baskets, silver beakers, glass chargers, crystal dishes, immortals' bowls and amber goblets. Ambrosial liquor was now served out and everybody drank of it.</P>
<P>Sanzang then bowed, rose to his feet, put his hands together in front of his chest and said to the queen, &#8220;Your Majesty, I am very grateful for this sumptuous banquet. We have had enough now. Could you now go to the throne hall and return the passport so that I may see the three of them off from the city tomorrow morning?&#8221; Doing as he asked, the queen led Sanzang by the hand as they ended the banquet and climbed the steps to the throne hall, where she invited the Tang Priest to sit on the throne.</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it would be wrong. As Your Majesty's tutor said, a new ecliptic begins tomorrow: only then will I dare to take the throne. Today the passport must be stamped so that they can be sent on their way.&#8221;</P>
<P>The queen accepted his suggestions, sat on the dragon throne again, had a gilt chair placed to the left of it for Sanzang to sit on, and told the disciples to bring the passport. The Great Sage asked Friar Sand to open the cloth wrapper and take it out, then offered it with both hands to the queen, who examined it carefully. At the top were nine stamps from the Great Tang emperor's seals, and underneath were the seals of the countries of Elephantia, Wuji and Tarrycart. When she had looked at them the queen said with a delightful, tinkling smile in her voice, &#8220;Is your surname Chen, emperor's brother?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My lay surname was Chen,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;and my religious name is Xuanzang. It was when the Tang emperor in his wisdom and mercy took me as his younger brother that he granted me the surname Tang.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why do your illustrious disciples' names not appear on the passport?&#8221; the queen asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;My three stupid disciples are not men of Tang.&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;But if they are not from Tang why have they come here with you?&#8221; the queen asked again.</P>
<P>&#8220;My senior disciple,&#8221; Sanzang answered, &#8220;was originally from the country of Aolai in the Eastern Continent of Superior Body. My second disciple is from Gao Village in Stubet in the Western Continent of Cattle-gift. My third disciple is from the Flowing Sands River. They were all punished for offences against the laws of Heaven until the Bodhisattva Guanyin delivered them from their sufferings. Since then they have been converted to the faith and have volunteered to escort me on my journey to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven to redeem their past crimes. I won each of them during the journey, which is why their religious names have not been entered on the passport.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Would you like me to add their names to it?&#8221; said the queen.</P>
<P>&#8220;If that is Your Majesty's pleasure,&#8221; Sanzang replied. The queen then sent for brush and inkstone, and when she had rubbed the ink-stick on the stone to produce a thick and fragrant ink with which she filled the hairs of her writing brush she wrote the names of the three disciples&#8212;Sun Wukong, Zhu Wuneng and Sha Wujing&#8212;at the bottom of the passport. Then she stamped it fair and square with her royal seal, wrote her signature, and handed it down to Monkey, who told Friar Sand to wrap it up again carefully.</P>
<P>The queen then presented them with a dish of small pieces of gold and silver, came down from her throne and said to Monkey, &#8220;You three must take this to help with the costs of your journey and go to the Western Heaven as quickly as you can. When you come back with the scriptures we shall richly reward you again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We are men of religion,&#8221; said Brother Monkey, &#8220;and we do not accept gold and silver. There will be places along the way for us to beg food from.&#8221; Seeing that they were not going to accept it the queen had ten bolts of damask and brocade brought out that she gave to Monkey with the words, &#8220;You are in such a hurry that we do not have time for this to be made up. Please take this to have some clothes made on the journey to keep you warm.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We monks may not wear damask or brocade,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;We are only allowed to cover ourselves with cotton cloth.&#8221; Seeing that he would not accept the silk either, the queen ordered that three pints of rice be brought out to provide them with a meal on their journey. The moment Pig heard the word &#8220;rice&#8221; he took it and put it with the bundles of luggage. &#8220;Brother,&#8221; Monkey said to him, &#8220;the luggage is very heavy now. Will you be able to carry the rice as well?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You wouldn't know that rice is best eaten the same day it's cooked,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;One meal and it'll be finished.&#8221; He then put his hands together in thanks.</P>
<P>&#8220;May I trouble Your Majesty to come with me while I escort my disciples out of the city?&#8221; Sanzang asked. &#8220;When I have given them some parting instructions about their journey West I shall come back to enjoy perpetual glory with Your Majesty. Only when I am freed from these cares and worries will we be able to join together like a pair of phoenixes.&#8221; Not realizing that this was a trick, the queen sent for her coach and climbed into it, leaning her fragrant shoulder against Sanzang as they rode Westwards out of the city. Bowls has been filled with clean water and fine incense put in all the burners. This was because the people were seeing their queen in her carriage and also because they were seeing a man, the emperor's younger brother. All of them, young and old alike, were women with powdered and lovely faces, and green-black hair piled high in cloud coiffures. The coach was soon out of the town and outside the Western gate.</P>
<P>Monkey, Pig and Friar Sand, joined in a common cause, neatened up their clothes and went to meet the carriage. &#8220;There is no need to escort us a long way, Your Majesty. We shall take our leave of you here.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang stepped down from the royal carriage, raised his hands together to the queen, and said, &#8220;Please go back now, Your Majesty, and allow me to fetch the scriptures.&#8221; When the queen heard this her face went pale with shock. She grabbed hold of the Tang Priest and said, &#8220;Dear emperor's brother, I have offered you the wealth of my realm to become my husband. Tomorrow you are going to take the throne as monarch, and I am going to be your consort. We have already eaten the wedding feast. How can you go back on your word now?&#8221;</P>
<P>This was too much for Pig, who went wild. Thrusting his snout about and waving his ears he rushed to the royal coach shouting. &#8220;What would monks like us want to marry a powdered skeleton like you for? Let my master go!&#8221; This rough and violent behavior so frightened the queen that her souls all went flying and she collapsed in the coach. Friar Sand pulled Sanzang out of the crowd and helped him mount the horse. Just then a woman shot forward from the roadside shouting, &#8220;Don't go, Tang emperor's brother. You and I are going to make love.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You ignorant, wicked creature,&#8221; Friar Sand shouted at her, striking at her head with his staff. The woman then made a whirlwind that carried the Tang Priest off with a great roar. He had disappeared without shadow or trace. Indeed</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He escaped from the net of beauties</P>
<P>To encounter a lecherous ogress.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know whether the woman was a human being or a monster, or whether the master lived or died, then listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>法性西来逢女国</p>
<p>心猿定计脱烟花</p>
</div>
<p>话说三藏师徒别了村舍人家，依路西进，不上三四十里，早到西梁国界。唐僧在马上指道：“悟空，前面城池相近，市井上人语喧哗，想是西梁女国。汝等须要仔细，谨慎规矩，切休放荡情怀，紊乱法门教旨。”三人闻言，谨遵严命。言未尽，却至东关厢街口。那里人都是长裙短袄，粉面油头，不分老少，尽是妇女，正在两街上做买做卖，忽见他四众来时，一齐都鼓掌呵呵，整容欢笑道：“人种来了！人种来了！”慌得那三藏勒马难行，须臾间就塞满街道，惟闻笑语。八戒口里乱嚷道：“我是个销猪！</p>

<p>我是个销猪！”行者道：“呆子，莫胡谈，拿出旧嘴脸便是。”八戒真个把头摇上两摇，竖起一双蒲扇耳，扭动莲蓬吊搭唇，发一声喊，把那些妇女们唬得跌跌爬爬。有诗为证，诗曰：圣僧拜佛到西梁，国内衠阴世少阳。农士工商皆女辈，渔樵耕牧尽红妆。</p>

<p>娇娥满路呼人种，幼妇盈街接粉郎。不是悟能施丑相，烟花围困苦难当！遂此众皆恐惧，不敢上前，一个个都捻手矬腰，摇头咬指，战战兢兢，排塞街旁路下，都看唐僧。孙大圣却也弄出丑相开路。沙僧也装吓虎维持，八戒采着马，掬着嘴，摆着耳朵。</p>

<p>一行前进，又见那市井上房屋齐整，铺面轩昂，一般有卖盐卖米、酒肆茶房，鼓角楼台通货殖，旗亭候馆挂帘栊。师徒们转湾抹角，忽见有一女官侍立街下，高声叫道：“远来的使客，不可擅入城门，请投馆驿注名上簿，待下官执名奏驾，验引放行。”</p>

<p>三藏闻言下马，观看那衙门上有一匾，上书迎阳驿三字。长老道：“悟空，那村舍人家传言是实，果有迎阳之驿。”沙僧笑道：</p>

<p>“二哥，你却去照胎泉边照照，看可有双影。”八戒道：“莫弄我！</p>

<p>我自吃了那盏儿落胎泉水，已此打下胎来了，还照他怎的？”三藏回头吩咐道：“悟能，谨言！谨言！”遂上前与那女官作礼。女官引路，请他们都进驿内，正厅坐下，即唤看茶。又见那手下人尽是三绺梳头、两截穿衣之类，你看他拿茶的也笑。少顷茶罢，女官欠身问曰：“使客何来？”行者道：“我等乃东土大唐王驾下钦差上西天拜佛求经者。我师父便是唐王御弟，号曰唐三藏，我乃他大徒弟孙悟空，这两个是我师弟猪悟能沙悟净，一行连马五口。随身有通关文牒，乞为照验放行。”那女官执笔写罢，下来叩头道：“老爷恕罪，下官乃迎阳驿驿丞，实不知上邦老爷，知当远接。”拜毕起身，即令管事的安排饮馔，道：“爷爷们宽坐一时，待下官进城启奏我王，倒换关文，打发领给，送老爷们西进。”三藏欣然而坐不题。</p>

<p>且说那驿丞整了衣冠，径入城中五凤楼前，对黄门官道：</p>

<p>“我是迎阳馆驿丞，有事见驾。”黄门即时启奏，降旨传宣至殿，问曰：“驿丞有何事来奏？”驿丞道：“微臣在驿，接得东土大唐王御弟唐三藏，有三个徒弟，名唤孙悟空、猪悟能、沙悟净，连马五口，欲上西天拜佛取经。特来启奏主公，可许他倒换关文放行？“女王闻奏满心欢喜，对众文武道：“寡人夜来梦见金屏生彩艳，玉镜展光明，乃是今日之喜兆也。”众女官拥拜丹墀道：“主公，怎见得是今日之喜兆？”女王道：“东土男人，乃唐朝御弟。我国中自混沌开辟之时，累代帝王，更不曾见个男人至此。幸今唐王御弟下降，想是天赐来的。寡人以一国之富，愿招御弟为王，我愿为后，与他阴阳配合，生子生孙，永传帝业，却不是今日之喜兆也？”众女官拜舞称扬，无不欢悦。驿丞又奏道：“主公之论，乃万代传家之好。但只是御弟三徒凶恶，不成相貌。”女王道：“卿见御弟怎生模样？他徒弟怎生凶丑？”驿丞道：“御弟相貌堂堂，丰姿英俊，诚是天朝上国之男儿，南赡中华之人物。那三徒却是形容狞恶，相貌如精。”女王道：“既如此，把他徒弟与他领给，倒换关文，打发他往西天，只留下御弟，有何不可？”众官拜奏道：“主公之言极当，臣等钦此钦遵。</p>

<p>但只是匹配之事，无媒不可，自古道，姻缘配合凭红叶，月老夫妻系赤绳。”女王道：“依卿所奏，就着当驾太师作媒，迎阳驿丞主婚，先去驿中与御弟求亲。待他许可，寡人却摆驾出城迎接。”那太师驿丞领旨出朝。</p>

<p>却说三藏师徒们在驿厅上正享斋饭，只见外面人报：“当驾太师与我们本官老姆来了。”三藏道：“太师来却是何意？”八戒道：“怕是女王请我们也。”行者道：“不是相请，就是说亲。”</p>

<p>三藏道：“悟空，假如不放，强逼成亲，却怎么是好？”行者道：</p>

<p>“师父只管允他，老孙自有处治。”</p>

<p>说不了，二女官早至，对长老下拜。长老一一还礼道：“贫僧出家人，有何德能，敢劳大人下拜？”那太师见长老相貌轩昂，心中暗喜道：“我国中实有造化，这个男子，却也做得我王之夫。”二官拜毕起来，侍立左右道：“御弟爷爷，万千之喜了！”</p>

<p>三藏道：“我出家人，喜从何来？”太师躬身道：“此处乃西梁女国，国中自来没个男子。今幸御弟爷爷降临，臣奉我王旨意，特来求亲。”三藏道：“善哉！善哉！我贫僧只身来到贵地，又无儿女相随，止有顽徒三个，不知大人求的是那个亲事？”驿丞道：</p>

<p>“下官才进朝启奏，我王十分欢喜，道夜来得一吉梦，梦见金屏生彩艳，玉镜展光明，知御弟乃中华上国男儿，我王愿以一国之富，招赘御弟爷爷为夫，坐南面称孤，我王愿为帝后。传旨着太师作媒，下官主婚，故此特来求这亲事也。”三藏闻言，低头不语。太师道：“大丈夫遇时不可错过，似此招赘之事，天下虽有；托国之富，世上实稀。请御弟速允，庶好回奏。”长老越加痴哑。八戒在旁掬着碓挺嘴叫道：“太师，你去上复国王：我师父乃久修得道的罗汉，决不爱你托国之富，也不爱你倾国之容，快些儿倒换关文，打发他往西去，留我在此招赘，如何？”太师闻说，胆战心惊，不敢回话。驿丞道：“你虽是个男身，但只形容丑陋，不中我王之意。”八戒笑道：“你甚不通变，常言道，粗柳簸箕细柳斗，世上谁见男儿丑。”行者道：“呆子，勿得胡谈，任师父尊意，可行则行，可止则止，莫要担阁了媒妁工夫。”三藏道：“悟空，凭你怎么说好！”行者道：“依老孙说，你在这里也好，自古道，千里姻缘似线牵哩，那里再有这般相应处？”三藏道：“徒弟，我们在这里贪图富贵，谁却去西天取经？那不望坏了我大唐之帝主也？”太师道：“御弟在上，微臣不敢隐言。我王旨意，原只教求御弟为亲，教你三位徒弟赴了会亲筵宴，发付领给，倒换关文，往西天取经去哩。”行者道：“太师说得有理，我等不必作难，情愿留下师父，与你主为夫，快换关文，打发我们西去，待取经回来，好到此拜爷娘，讨盘缠，回大唐也。”那太师与驿丞对行者作礼道：“多谢老师玉成之恩！”八戒道：“太师，切莫要口里摆菜碟儿，既然我们许诺，且教你主先安排一席，与我们吃锺肯酒，如何？”太师道：“有有有，就教摆设筵宴来也。”那驿丞与太师欢天喜地回奏女主不题。</p>

<p>却说唐长老一把扯住行者，骂道：“你这猴头，弄杀我也！</p>

<p>怎么说出这般话来，教我在此招婚，你们西天拜佛，我就死也不敢如此。”行者道：“师父放心，老孙岂不知你性情，但只是到此地，遇此人，不得不将计就计！”三藏道：“怎么叫做将计就计？”行者道：“你若使住法儿不允他，他便不肯倒换关文，不放我们走路。倘或意恶心毒，喝令多人割了你肉，做甚么香袋啊，我等岂有善报？一定要使出降魔荡怪的神通。你知我们的手脚又重，器械又凶，但动动手儿，这一国的人尽打杀了。他虽然阻当我等，却不是怪物妖精，还是一国人身；你又平素是个好善慈悲的人，在路上一灵不损，若打杀无限的平人，你心何忍！</p>

<p>诚为不善了也。”三藏听说，道：“悟空，此论最善。但恐女主招我进去，要行夫妇之礼，我怎肯丧元阳，败坏了佛家德行；走真精，坠落了本教人身？”行者道：“今日允了亲事，他一定以皇帝礼，摆驾出城接你。你更不要推辞，就坐他凤辇龙车，登宝殿，面南坐下，问女王取出御宝印信来，宣我们兄弟进朝，把通关文牒用了印，再请女王写个手字花押，佥押了交付与我们。一壁厢教摆筵宴，就当与女王会喜，就与我们送行。待筵宴已毕，再叫排驾，只说送我们三人出城，回来与女王配合。哄得他君臣欢悦，更无阻挡之心，亦不起毒恶之念，却待送出城外，你下了龙车凤辇，教沙僧伺候左右，伏侍你骑上白马，老孙却使个定身法儿，教他君臣人等皆不能动，我们顺大路只管西行。行得一昼夜，我却念个咒，解了术法，还教他君臣们苏醒回城。一则不伤了他的性命，二来不损了你的元神。这叫做假亲脱网之计，岂非一举两全之美也？”三藏闻言，如醉方醒，似梦初觉，乐以忘忧，称谢不尽，道：“深感贤徒高见。”四众同心合意，正自商量不题。</p>

<p>却说那太师与驿丞不等宣诏，直入朝门白玉阶前奏道：</p>

<p>“主公佳梦最准，鱼水之欢就矣。”女王闻奏，卷珠帘，下龙床，启樱唇，露银齿，笑吟吟娇声问曰：“贤卿见御弟，怎么说来？”</p>

<p>太师道：“臣等到驿，拜见御弟毕，即备言求亲之事。御弟还有推托之辞，幸亏他大徒弟慨然见允，愿留他师父与我王为夫，面南称帝，只教先倒换关文，打发他三人西去；取得经回，好到此拜认爷娘，讨盘费回大唐也。”女王笑道：“御弟再有何说。”</p>

<p>太师奏道：“御弟不言，愿配我主，只是他那二徒弟，先要吃席肯酒？”女王闻言，即传旨教光禄寺排宴，一壁厢排大驾，出城迎接夫君。众女官即钦遵王命，打扫宫殿，铺设庭台。一班儿摆宴的，火速安排；一班儿摆驾的，流星整备。你看那西梁国虽是妇女之邦，那銮舆不亚中华之盛，但见：六龙喷彩，双凤生祥。六龙喷彩扶车出，双凤生祥驾辇来。馥蘛异香蔼，氤氲瑞气开。金鱼玉佩多官拥，宝髻云鬟众女排。鸳鸯掌扇遮銮驾，翡翠珠帘影凤钗。笙歌音美，弦管声谐。一片欢情冲碧汉，无边喜气出灵台。三檐罗盖摇天宇，五色旌旗映御阶。此地自来无合卺，女王今日配男才。</p>

<p>不多时，大驾出城，早到迎阳馆驿。忽有人报三藏师徒道：</p>

<p>“驾到了。”三藏闻言，即与三徒整衣出厅迎驾。女王卷帘下辇道：“那一位是唐朝御弟？”太师指道：“那驿门外香案前穿襕衣者便是。”女王闪凤目，簇蛾眉，仔细观看，果然一表非凡，你看他：丰姿英伟，相貌轩昂。齿白如银砌，唇红口四方。顶平额阔天仓满，目秀眉清地阁长。两耳有轮真杰士，一身不俗是才郎。</p>

<p>好个妙龄聪俊风流子，堪配西梁窈窕娘。女王看到那心欢意美之外，不觉淫情汲汲，爱欲恣恣，展放樱桃小口，呼道：“大唐御弟，还不来占凤乘鸾也？”三藏闻言，耳红面赤，羞答答不敢抬头。猪八戒在旁，掬着嘴，饧眼观看那女王，却也袅娜，真个眉如翠羽，肌似羊脂。脸衬桃花瓣，鬟堆金凤丝。秋波湛湛妖娆态，春笋纤纤妖媚姿。斜軃红绡飘彩艳，高簪珠翠显光辉。说甚么昭君美貌，果然是赛过西施。柳腰微展鸣金珮，莲步轻移动玉肢。月里嫦娥难到此，九天仙子怎如斯。宫妆巧样非凡类，诚然王母降瑶池。那呆子看到好处，忍不住口嘴流涎，心头撞鹿，一时间骨软筋麻，好便似雪狮子向火，不觉的都化去也。</p>

<p>只见那女王走近前来，一把扯住三藏，俏语娇声，叫道：</p>

<p>“御弟哥哥，请上龙车，和我同上金銮宝殿，匹配夫妇去来。”这长老战兢兢立站不住，似醉如痴。行者在侧教道：“师父不必太谦，请共师娘上辇，快快倒换关文，等我们取经去罢。”长老不敢回言，把行者抹了两抹，止不住落下泪来，行者道：“师父切莫烦恼，这般富贵，不受用还待怎么哩？”三藏没及奈何，只得依从，揩了眼泪，强整欢容，移步近前，与女主：同携素手，共坐龙车。那女主喜孜孜欲配夫妻，这长老忧惶惶只思拜佛。一个要洞房花烛交鸳侣，一个要西宇灵山见世尊。女帝真情，圣僧假意。女帝真情，指望和谐同到老；圣僧假意，牢藏情意养元神。一个喜见男身，恨不得白昼并头谐伉俪；一个怕逢女色，只思量即时脱网上雷音。二人和会同登辇，岂料唐僧各有心！</p>

<p>那些文武官，见主公与长老同登凤辇，并肩而坐，一个个眉花眼笑，拨转仪从，复入城中。孙大圣才教沙僧挑着行李，牵着白马，随大驾后边同行。猪八戒往前乱跑，先到五凤楼前，嚷道：“好自在！好现成呀！这个弄不成！这个弄不成！吃了喜酒进亲才是！”唬得些执仪从引导的女官，一个个回至驾边道：</p>

<p>“主公，那一个长嘴大耳的，在五凤楼前嚷道要喜酒吃哩。”女主闻奏，与长老倚香肩，偎并桃腮，开檀口，俏声叫道：“御弟哥哥，长嘴大耳的是你那个高徒？”三藏道：“是我第二个徒弟，他生得食肠宽大，一生要图口肥。须是先安排些酒食与他吃了，方可行事。”女主急问：“光禄寺安排筵宴完否？”女官奏道：“已完，设了荤素两样，在东阁上哩。”女王又问：“怎么两样？”女官奏道：“臣恐唐朝御弟与高徒等平素吃斋，故有荤素两样。”女王却又笑吟吟，偎着长老的香腮道：“御弟哥哥，你吃荤吃素？”</p>

<p>三藏道：“贫僧吃素，但是未曾戒酒，须得几杯素酒，与我二徒弟吃些。”说未了，太师启奏：“请赴东阁会宴，今宵吉日良辰，就可与御弟爷爷成亲，明日天开黄道，请御弟爷爷登宝殿，面南改年号即位。”女王大喜，即与长老携手相搀，下了龙车，共入端门里，但见那：风飘仙乐下楼台，阊阖中间翠辇来。凤阙大开光蔼蔼，皇宫不闭锦排排。麒麟殿内炉烟袅，孔雀屏边房影回。亭阁峥嵘如上国，玉堂金马更奇哉！</p>

<p>既至东阁之下，又闻得一派笙歌声韵美，又见两行红粉貌娇娆。正中堂排设两般盛宴：左边上首是素筵，右边上首是荤筵，下两路尽是单席。那女王敛袍袖，十指尖尖，奉着玉杯，便来安席。行者近前道：“我师徒都是吃素。先请师父坐了左手素席，转下三席，分左右，我兄弟们好坐。”太师喜道：“正是，正是。师徒即父子也，不可并肩。”众女官连忙调了席面。女王一一传杯，安了他弟兄三位。行者又与唐僧丢个眼色，教师父回礼。三藏下来，却也擎玉杯，与女王安席。那些文武官，朝上拜谢了皇恩，各依品从，分坐两边，才住了音乐请酒。那八戒那管好歹，放开肚子，只情吃起。也不管甚么玉屑米饭、蒸饼、糖糕、蘑菇、香蕈、笋芽，木耳、黄花菜、石花菜、紫菜、蔓菁、芋头、萝菔、山药、黄精、一骨辣噇了个罄尽，喝了五七杯酒。口里嚷道：</p>

<p>“看添换来！拿大觥来！再吃几觥，各人干事去。”沙僧问道：</p>

<p>“好筵席不吃，还要干甚事？”呆子笑道：“古人云，造弓的造弓，造箭的造箭。我们如今招的招，嫁的嫁，取经的还去取经，走路的还去走路，莫只管贪杯误事，快早儿打发关文，正是将军不下马，各自奔前程。”女王闻说，即命取大杯来。近侍官连忙取几个鹦鹉杯、鸬鹚杓、金叵罗、银凿落、玻璃盏、水晶盆、蓬莱碗、琥珀锺，满斟玉液，连注琼浆，果然都各饮一巡。</p>

<p>三藏欠身而起，对女王合掌道：“陛下，多蒙盛设，酒已彀了。请登宝殿，倒换关文，赶天早，送他三人出城罢。”女王依言，携着长老，散了筵宴，上金銮宝殿，即让长老即位。三藏道：</p>

<p>“不可！不可！适太师言过，明日天开黄道，贫僧才敢即位称孤。</p>

<p>今日即印关文，打发他去也。”女王依言，仍坐了龙床，即取金交椅一张，放在龙床左手，请唐僧坐了，叫徒弟们拿上通关文牒来。大圣便教沙僧解开包袱，取出关文。大圣将关文双手捧上。那女王细看一番，上有大唐皇帝宝印九颗，下有宝象国印，乌鸡国印，车迟国印。女王看罢，娇滴滴笑语道：“御弟哥哥又姓陈？”三藏道：“俗家姓陈，法名玄奘。因我唐王圣恩认为御弟，赐姓我为唐也。”女王道：“关文上如何没有高徒之名？”三藏道：“三个顽徒，不是我唐朝人物。”女王道：“既不是你唐朝人物，为何肯随你来？”三藏道：“大的个徒弟，祖贯东胜神洲傲来国人氏；第二个乃西牛贺洲乌斯庄人氏；第三个乃流沙河人氏。他三人都因罪犯天条，南海观世音菩萨解脱他苦，秉善皈依，将功折罪，情愿保护我上西天取经。皆是途中收得，故此未注法名在牒。”女王道：“我与你添注法名，好么？”三藏道：“但凭陛下尊意。”女王即令取笔砚来，浓磨香翰，饱润香毫，牒文之后，写上孙悟空、猪悟能、沙悟净三人名讳，却才取出御印，端端正正印了，又画个手字花押，传将下去。孙大圣接了，教沙僧包裹停当。那女王又赐出碎金碎银一盘，下龙床递与行者道：“你三人将此权为路费，早上西天。待汝等取经回来，寡人还有重谢。”行者道：“我们出家人，不受金银，途中自有乞化之处。”女王见他不受，又取出绫锦十匹，对行者道：“汝等行色匆匆，裁制不及，将此路上做件衣服遮寒，”行者道：“出家人穿不得绫锦，自有护体布衣。”女王见他不受，教：“取御米三升，在路权为一饭。”八戒听说个饭字，便就接了，捎在包袱之间。行者道：“兄弟，行李见今沉重，且倒有气力挑米？”八戒笑道：“你那里知道，米好的是个日消货，只消一顿饭，就了帐也。”遂此合掌谢恩。</p>

<p>三藏道：“敢烦陛下相同贫僧送他三人出城，待我嘱付他们几句，教他好生西去，我却回来，与陛下永受荣华，无挂无牵，方可会鸾交凤友也。”女王不知是计，便传旨摆驾，与三藏并倚香肩，同登凤辇，出西城而去。满城中都盏添净水，炉降真香，一则看女王銮驾，二来看御弟男身。没老没小，尽是粉容娇面、绿鬓云鬟之辈。不多时，大驾出城，到西关之处，行者、八戒、沙僧、同心合意，结束整齐，径迎着銮舆，厉声高叫道：“那女王不必远送，我等就此拜别。”长老慢下龙车，对女王拱手道：“陛下请回，让贫僧取经去也。”女王闻言，大惊失色，扯住唐僧道：“御弟哥哥，我愿将一国之富，招你为夫，明日高登宝位，即位称君，我愿为君之后，喜筵通皆吃了，如何却又变卦？”</p>

<p>八戒听说，发起个风来，把嘴乱扭，耳朵乱摇，闯至驾前，嚷道：</p>

<p>“我们和尚家和你这粉骷髅做甚夫妻！放我师父走路！”那女王见他那等撒泼弄丑，唬得魂飞魄散，跌入辇驾之中。沙僧却把三藏抢出人丛，伏侍上马。只见那路旁闪出一个女子，喝道：</p>

<p>“唐御弟，那里走！我和你耍风月儿去来！”沙僧骂道：“贼辈无知！”掣宝杖劈头就打。那女子弄阵旋风，呜的一声，把唐僧摄将去了，无影无踪，不知下落何处。咦！正是：脱得烟花网，又遇风月魔。毕竟不知那女子是人是怪，老师父的性命得死得生，且听下回分解。</p>
