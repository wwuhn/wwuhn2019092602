<P>Three Monks Wage a Great Fight on Green Dragon Mountain</P>
<P>Four Stars Seize the Rhinoceros Monsters</P>
</div>
<P>The story tells how after the Great Sage Monkey took his two brother disciples by gale and cloud to the Northeast they were soon bringing their cloud down at the entrance to the Dark Essence Cave on Green Dragon Mountain. Pig was just about to smash the doors in when Monkey said, &#8220;Wait a moment. I'll go in and find out whether the master's still alive before we have it out with him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But the doors are shut very tightly,&#8221; said Friar Sand. How will you get in?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've got my methods,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage then put his cudgel away, made a spell with his fingers while saying the magic words, called &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned into a fire-fly. He was really nimble. Just look at him:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Wings that shine like shooting stars:</P>
<P>The ancients say fire-flies grow from rotting plants.</P>
<P>His powers of transformation are truly great,</P>
<P>And he loves to wander all around.</P>
<P>When he flies to the stone doors to look within</P>
<P>A draft blows through the crack beside him.</P>
<P>A single jump and he is in the dark courtyard,</P>
<P>Watching the movements of the evil spirits.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As he flew in he saw some cattle sprawled around on the ground, fast asleep and snoring like thunder. In the main hall nothing was moving, and all the doors were closed. Not knowing where the three evil spirits were sleeping, he went through the hall and shone with his light into the back, where he heard sobs. The Tang Priest was chained to a pillar under the eaves at the back and weeping. Monkey kept out of sight as he listened to what he was crying about, and this is what he heard:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Since I left Chang'an in China some ten years back and more,</P>
<P>I have had to suffer much crossing all those rivers and mountains.</P>
<P>I came out to the West at a very happy season,</P>
<P>Arriving in the city for the festival of lanterns.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;I failed to understand that the Buddhas were impostors</P>
<P>All because my fate seems to doom me to distress.</P>
<P>My disciples gave pursuit and will use their mighty powers:</P>
<P>I pray they will be able to achieve a great success.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Delighted to hear this, Monkey spread his wings and flew closer to his master, who wiped away his tears and observed, &#8220;Goodness, the West really is different. This is only the first month of the year, when dormant insects are just beginning to wake up. Fancy seeing a fire-fly now!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Brother Monkey, unable to keep quiet any longer, &#8220;I'm here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I was just wondering how there could be a fire-fly at this time of year, and it's you,&#8221; the Tang Priest replied with delight.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Monkey, turning back into himself, &#8220;the journey's been held up so long and so much effort has been wasted because you can't tell true from false. All the way along I've told you demons are no good, but you will kowtow to them. When those devils covered up the lamps to steal the refined butter oil they carried you off too. I told Pig and Friar Sand to go back to the monastery and keep an eye on our things while I followed the smell of the wind here. I didn't know what the place was called, but luckily the four Duty Gods told me that this is Dark Essence Cave on Green Dragon Mountain. I fought the monsters all day long till I went back at evening, told my brother-disciples the full story, and came back here with them instead of going to bad. As I thought it was too late at night to fight and didn't know where you were I transformed myself to come in and find out what's going on.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Are Pig and Friar Sand outside?&#8221; the happy Tang Priest asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;I've just had a look around and seen that the evil spirits are all asleep. I'll unlock you, smash the doors down and get you out.&#8221; The Tang Priest nodded his head in gratitude.</P>
<P>Using his unlocking magic, Monkey made the lock open at a touch. He was just leading his master to the front of the cave when the demon kings could be heard shouting from their bedrooms, &#8220;Shut the doors tight, little ones, and be careful of fire. Why can't we hear the watchmen calling the watches? Where are the clappers and bells?&#8221;</P>
<P>After a day's hard fighting the junior demons were all asleep, exhausted; and they only woke up when they heard the shout. To the sound of clappers and bells several of them came out from the back holding weapons and beating gongs, and they just happened to bump into Monkey and his master.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where do you think you're going, my fine monks, now you've broken the locks?&#8221; the junior devils all shouted together, and with no further argument Monkey pulled out his cudgel, shook it to make it as thick as a rice bowl and struck, killing two of them at a blow. The rest of them dropped their weapons, went to the central hall, beat on the doors and shouted, &#8220;Disaster, Your Majesties, disaster. The hairy-faced monk's got inside and he's killing people.&#8221;</P>
<P>The moment the three demons heard this they tumbled out of their beds and ordered, &#8220;Catch them! Catch them!&#8221; This gave the Tang Priest such a fright that his hands and legs turned weak. Monkey abandoned him and stormed his way forward, swinging his cudgel.</P>
<P>The junior devils could not stop him as, pushing two or three aside here and knocking two or three over there, he smashed several pairs of doors open and rushed straight out, shouting, &#8220;Where are you, brothers?&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig and Friar Sand greeted him, rake and staff raised for action, with the question, &#8220;What's up, brother?&#8221; Monkey told them all about how he had transformed himself to rescue the master, been found by the spirits when they woke up, and been forced to abandon him and fight his way out.</P>
<P>Now that they had recaptured the Tang Priest, the demon kings had him locked up in chains again and questioned him in the glare of lamplight, as they brandished cutlass and axe. &#8220;How did you open the lock, damn you,&#8221; they asked, &#8220;and how did that ape get inside? Confess this moment and we'll spare your life, or else we'll cut you in half.&#8221;</P>
<P>This so terrified the Tang Priest that he fell to his knees shivering and shaking and said, &#8220;Your Majesties, my disciple Sun Wukong can do seventy-two kinds of transformations. Just now he turned into a fire-fly and flew in to rescue me. We never realized that Your Majesties would wake up or that we would bump into Their Junior Majesties. My wicked disciple wounded a couple of them, and when they all started shouting and going for us with weapons and torches he abandoned me and escaped.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If we'd woken up earlier he'd never have got away,&#8221; the three demon kings said with loud guffaws. They then told their underlings to fasten the doors firmly at front and back and stop shouting.</P>
<P>&#8220;As they've shut the doors and stopped shouting I think they must be going to murder the master,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;We must act.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;Let's smash the doors,&#8221; The idiot showed off his magical powers by smashing the stone doors to smithereens with a blow from his rake then shouted at the top of his voice, &#8220;Thieving, oil-stealing monsters! Send my master out right now!&#8221;</P>
<P>This gave the junior devils inside the doors such a fright that they tumbled and ran inside to report, &#8220;Disaster, Your Majesties, disaster. The monks have smashed the front doors.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They're outrageous, damn them,&#8221; the three demon kings said in a great fury, and when they had sent for their armor and fastened it on they took their weapons and led their underlings into battle. It was now about the third watch of the night, and the moon in the middle of the sky made all as bright as day. As they led their forces out they wasted no more words and started fighting. Monkey held off the battle-axe, Pig blocked the cutlass, and Friar Sand took on the flail.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Three monks with cudgel, staff and rake;</P>
<P>Three evil monsters both brave and angry.</P>
<P>The battle-axe, the cutlass and the flail</P>
<P>Made howling winds and set the sand flying.</P>
<P>In their first clashes they breathed out baleful mists,</P>
<P>Then as they flew around they scattered coloured clouds.</P>
<P>The nailed rake went through its routines round the body,</P>
<P>The iron cudgel was even more splendidly heroic,</P>
<P>And the demon-quelling staff was something rarely seen on earth;</P>
<P>But the unrepentant ogres would not yield a foot of ground.</P>
<P>The bright-bladed axe had a sharp-pointed butt,</P>
<P>The whirling flail made a pattern of flowers,</P>
<P>And the flashing cutlass swung like a painted door;</P>
<P>But the monks were their match.</P>
<P>One side was fighting with fury for their master's life;</P>
<P>The other hit at their faces so as not to release the Tang Priest.</P>
<P>The axe hacked and the cudgel blocked in the struggle for mastery;</P>
<P>The rake swung and the cutlass struck as they fought;</P>
<P>The knotted flail and the demon-quelling staff,</P>
<P>Coming and going in a splendid display.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the three monks and the three monsters had been fighting for a long time without either side coming out on top King Cold-avoider shouted, &#8220;Come on, little ones!&#8221; The monsters all charged at Pig, quickly tripping him up and bringing him to the ground. Several water-buffalo spirits dragged and pulled him inside the cave, where they tied him up. When Friar Sand saw that Pig had disappeared and heard the mooing of all the cattle he then raised his staff, feinted at King Dust-avoider and tried to flee, only to be rushed by another crowd of spirits who pulled at him, sending him staggering. However hard he struggled he could not get up, and he too was carried off to be tied up. Realizing that he was in an impossible situation, Monkey escaped by somersault cloud.</P>
<P>When Pig and Friar Sand were dragged to him the Tang Priest said with tears welling up in his eyes at the sight of them, &#8220;Poor things! You two have been caught too. Where's Wukong?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When he saw we'd been caught he ran away,&#8221; Friar Sand replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wherever he has gone he will certainly have gone to fetch help,&#8221; said the Tang Priest. &#8220;But who knows when we will be delivered?&#8221; Master and disciples felt thoroughly miserable.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story tells how Brother Monkey rode his somersault cloud back to the Clouds of Compassion Monastery, where the monks met him with the question, &#8220;Have you been able to rescue Lord Tang?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's difficult,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;very difficult. Those three evil spirits have tremendous magical powers, and when we three had fought them for a long time they called up their underlings to capture Pig and Friar Sand. I was lucky to get away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; said the monks with horror, &#8220;if someone who can ride mists and clouds as you can couldn't catch them, your master is bound to be killed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No problem,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;no problem. My master's under the secret protection of the Protectors, the Guardians, the Dings and the Jias. He has besides eaten Grass-returning Cinnabar. I'm sure his life will be safe. The only trouble is that those demons really know their stuff. You people look after the horse and the luggage while I go up to Heaven to get some troops.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Can you go up to Heaven, my lord?&#8221; asked the terrified monks.</P>
<P>&#8220;I used to live there,&#8221; replied Monkey with a smile. &#8220;Because I wrecked the Peach Banquet when I was Great Sage Equaling Heaven, our Buddha subdued me, so that now I've no option but to redeem my crimes by guarding the Tang Priest while he fetches the scriptures. All along the journey I've been helping the good and fighting against the evil. What you don't realize is that the master is fated to have these troubles.&#8221; When the monks heard this they kowtowed in worship, while Monkey went outside and disappeared with a whistle.</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage was soon outside the Western Gate of Heaven, where the Metal Planet, Heavenly King Virudhaka and the four spirit officers Yin, Zhu, Tao and Xu were talking to each other. As soon as they saw Monkey coming they hastily bowed to him and said, &#8220;Where are you going, Great Sage?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;After we reached Mintian County in Jinping Prefecture on the Eastern borders of India,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;my master, the Tang Priest who I'm escorting, was being entertained by the monks of the Clouds of Compassion Monastery for the Full Moon Festival. When we went to the Bridge of Golden Lamps there were three golden lamps full of over fifty thousand ounces of silver's worth of scented refined butter oil that the Buddhas came down to take every year. While we were admiring the lamps three Buddha images did come down to earth, and my master was gullible enough to go on the bridge to worship them. I told him they were a bad lot, but by then the lamps had been covered up and the master carried off with the oil by a wind. When I'd followed the wind till dawn I reached a mountain, where the four Duty Gods fortunately told me that it was called Green Dragon Mountain with a Dark Essence Cave in it where three monsters lived: King Cold-avoider, King Heat-avoider and King Dust-avoider. I hurried to their doors to demand the master and fought them for a while without success, so I got in by transforming myself to find the master locked up but unharmed. I released him and was just taking him out when they woke up and I had to flee again. Later I fought hard against them with Pig and Friar Sand, but the two of them were both captured and tied up. That's why I've come up to inform the Jade Emperor, find out about the monsters' background and ask him to give orders to have them suppressed.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this the Metal Planet burst out laughing and said, &#8220;If you've been fighting the monsters why can't you tell where they're from?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I can see that,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;They're a bunch of rhino spirits. But they have such enormous magical powers that I can't beat them and I'm desperate.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They are three rhinoceros spirits,&#8221; the Metal Planet explained. &#8220;Because their form is seen in heaven they cultivated their awareness for many years and became true spirits able to fly on clouds and walk in mists. Those monsters are fanatical about cleanliness and don't like the look of their own bodies, and are always going into the water to bathe. They have lots of different names: there are she-rhinos, he-rhinos, gelded rhinos, spotted rhinos,<I> humao</I> rhinos,<I> duoluo</I> rhinos and heaven-connected brindled rhinos. They all have a single nostril, three types of hair and two horns. They roam the rivers and seas and can travel through water. It looks as though Cold-avoider, Heat-avoider and Dust-avoider have nobility in their horns, which is why they call themselves kings. If you want to catch them, they will submit to the four beast stars belonging to the element wood.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Which four wood stars?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;Could I trouble you, venerable sir, to spell it out for me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Those stars are spread out in space outside the Dipper and Bull Palace,&#8221; the planet replied with a smile. &#8220;If you submit a memorial to the Jade Emperor he will give you detailed instructions.&#8221; Raising his clasped hands as he expressed his thanks, Monkey went straight in through the heavenly gates.</P>
<P>He was soon outside the Hall of Universal Brightness, where he saw the heavenly teachers Ge, Qiu, Zhang and Xu, who asked, &#8220;Where are you going?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We've just reached Jinping Prefecture,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;where my master relaxed his dhyana nature by going to enjoy the Moon Festival lanterns and was carried off by evil monsters. As I can't subdue them myself I've come to ask the Jade Emperor to save him.&#8221; The four heavenly teachers then took Monkey to the Hall of Miraculous Mist to submit his memorial, and when all the ceremonials had been performed he explained his business. The Jade Emperor then asked which units of heavenly soldiers he wanted to help him.</P>
<P>&#8220;When I arrived at the Western Gate of Heaven just now,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;the Metal Planet told me they were rhinoceros spirits that could only be subdued by the four beast stars belonging to the element wood.&#8221; The Jade Emperor then told Heavenly Teacher Xu to go to the Dipper and Bull Palace with Monkey to fetch the four beast stars and take them down to the lower world to make the capture.</P>
<P>By the time they arrived outside the Dipper and Bull Palace the Twenty-eight Constellations were there to greet them. &#8220;We are here by imperial command to order four beast stars belonging to the element wood to go down to the lower world with the Great Sage Sun,&#8221; the heavenly teacher explained. The Wooden Lesser Dragon of the Constellation Horn, the Wooden Unicorn of the Dipper, the Wooden Wolf of the Strider, and the Wooden Hyena of the Well all stepped forward from the side to ask, &#8220;Where are you sending us to subdue demons, Great Sage?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So you're the ones,&#8221; said Brother Monkey with a smile. &#8220;That old man Metal Planet kept your names secret, and I didn't realize what he was driving at. If he'd told me before that it was you four wooden animals from the Twenty-eight Constellations I'd have come here to invite you myself: there'd have been no need to trouble His Majesty for an edict.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a thing to say, Great Sage,&#8221; the four wooden animals replied. &#8220;We'd never have dared to leave on our own authority in the absence of an imperial decree. Where are they? Let's go right away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They are rhinoceros spirits in the Dark Essence Cave in Green Dragon Mountain to the Northeast of Jinping Prefecture.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If they're really rhinoceros spirits,&#8221; said the Wooden Unicorn of the Dipper, the Wooden Wolf of the Strider and the Wooden Lesser Dragon of the Horn, &#8220;you'll only need Wooden Hyena from the Well Constellation. He can eat tigers on mountains and capture rhinos in the sea.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But these aren't ordinary rhinos who gaze at the moon,&#8221; replied Monkey. &#8220;They have cultivated their conduct and found the Way and are a thousand years old. All four of you gentlemen must come: no excuses. If one of you can't capture them single-handed it'll be wasted effort.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You people are talking nonsense,&#8221; the heavenly teacher added. &#8220;The imperial command is that all four of you go, so go you must. Fly there at once while I report back.&#8221; The heavenly teacher then took his leave of Monkey and went.</P>
<P>&#8220;Delay no more, Great Sage,&#8221; the four wooden ones said. &#8220;You challenge them to battle and lure them out so we can come from behind you and get them.&#8221; Monkey then went up to the cave and shouted abusively, &#8220;Oil-thieving ogres! Give my master back!&#8221; The doors, which Pig had smashed open, had been barricaded with a few planks by a number of junior devils, and when they heard his insults they rushed inside to report, &#8220;Your Majesties, the monk Sun is outside insulting us again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We beat him and he ran away,&#8221; said Dust-avoider, &#8220;so why's he back again today? I think he must have got some reinforcements from somewhere.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We're not scared of any reinforcements he could get,&#8221; said Cold-avoider and Heat-avoider scornfully. &#8220;Let's get into our armor at once. Little ones, surround him carefully and don't let him get away.&#8221; Not caring about their lives, the evil spirits came out of the cave holding spears and swords, with banners waving and drums beating. &#8220;Back again, are you, macaque?&#8221; they shouted at Brother Monkey. &#8220;Not afraid of another beating?&#8221;</P>
<P>Nothing infuriated Monkey so much as the word &#8220;macaque,&#8221; and he was grinding his teeth in rage as he lifted his cudgel to hit them. The three demon kings brought their junior devils up to surround him, at which the four wooden beasts who were waiting to one side swung their weapons with shouts of, &#8220;Don't move, animals!&#8221;</P>
<P>The three demon kings were of course most alarmed at the sight of the four stars, and they all said, &#8220;This is terrible, terrible. He's found the people who can beat us. Run for your lives, little ones!&#8221; With that there was much roaring, lowing, panting and sighing as the junior devils all resumed their original appearances as yak, water-buffalo and ox spirits running all over the mountain. The three demon kings also turned back into their true selves, put their hands down to become four-hoofed creatures like iron cannons, and galloped off to the Northeast, to be followed hard by the Great Sage leading the Wooden Hyena of the Well and the Wooden Lesser Dragon of the Horn. While they were not going to relax for a moment, the Wooden Unicorn of the Dipper and the Wooden Wolf of the Strider were mopping up all the cattle spirits among the hollows, summits, ravines and valleys of the Eastern mountain. Some were killed and others taken alive. They then went into the Dark Essence Cave to free the Tang Priest, Pig and Friar Sand.</P>
<P>Recognizing the two stars, Friar Sand bowed to them in thanks and asked, &#8220;What brought you two gentlemen here to rescue us?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We came to rescue you because the Great Sage Monkey submitted a request to the Jade Emperor that we be sent,&#8221; the two stars replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why has my disciple Wukong not come in?&#8221; the Tang Priest asked with tears in his eyes.</P>
<P>&#8220;The three old demons are rhinoceroses,&#8221; the stars explained, &#8220;and when they saw us they fled for their lives to the Northeast. The Great Sage Sun has gone after them with the Wooden Hyena of the Well and the Wooden Lesser Dragon of the Horn. We two wiped out the oxen then came here to rescue you, holy monk.&#8221; The Tang Priest once again kowtowed in thanks then kowtowed to heaven.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;overdone courtesy is hypocrisy. Stop kowtowing all the time. The four star officers came at the Jade Emperor's command and as a favour to big brother. The ordinary demons have all been wiped out, but we still don't know how the senior demons are to be put down. Let's clear all the valuables out of the cave, wreck the place so as to dig out their roots, then go back to the monastery to wait for Monkey.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Marshal Tian Peng, your suggestion is right,&#8221; said the Wooden Wolf of the Strider. &#8220;You and the Curtain-lifting General escort your master back to the monastery to sleep while we head Northeast to fight the enemy.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;With you two to help you're bound to wipe them all out. Then you'll be able to report back on your mission.&#8221; The two star officers immediately joined the chase. After Pig and Friar Sand had found a bushel of valuables in the cave&#8212;there was much coral, agate, pearls, amber, precious shells, jade and gold&#8212;they carried them outside and invited the master to sit on the top of a crag while they started a fire that burned the whole cave to ashes. Only then did they take the master back to the Clouds of Compassion Monastery in Jinping Prefecture. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The classic says, &#8220;Disaster comes at the height of success.&#8221;</P>
<P>Indeed one can meet with evil in happiness.</P>
<P>For love of the lanterns the dhyana nature was disturbed;</P>
<P>The heart set on the Way was weakened by a beautiful sight.</P>
<P>The great elixir has always had to be permanently guarded;</P>
<P>Once it is lost one always comes to grief.</P>
<P>Shut it up tight; bind it fast; never idle.</P>
<P>A moment's lack of care can lead one astray.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We will tell not of how the three of them went back to the monastery, their lives saved, but of how the Wooden Unicorn of the Dipper and the Wooden Wolf of the Strider were riding their clouds Northeast in pursuit of the demons when they lost sight of them in mid air. On reaching the Western Ocean they saw the Great Sage Monkey down by the sea a long way away, shouting.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where have the monsters gone, Great Sage?&#8221; they asked, bringing their clouds down. &#8220;Why didn't you two come after them and help put them down?&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;How can you have the nerve to ask that question?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When we saw that you and the stars from the Well and the Horn had routed the demons and were going after them, Great Sage,&#8221; the Wooden Unicorn of the Dipper replied, &#8220;we were sure you'd capture them, so we two wiped out the rest of the devils, rescued your master and fellow-disciples from the cave, searched the mountain, burned the cave out, and entrusted your master to your two fellow-disciples to take back to the Clouds of Compassion Monastery in the city. We only came after you this way when you had been gone for such a long time.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case you did very well,&#8221; said Brother Monkey, his wrath now turned to pleasure. &#8220;Thank you for going to so much trouble. The only thing is that when we'd chased the three ogres this far they plunged into the sea. The two stars from the Well and the Horn followed close behind them while I stayed on the shore to cut off their escape. Now you're here you can block them on the shore while I go there.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage then swung his cudgel and made a spell with his fingers as he cleared a way through the waters, plunging deep into the waves, where the three monsters were locked in a life-and-death struggle with the Wooden Hyena of the Well and the Wooden Lesser Dragon of the Horn.</P>
<P>&#8220;Monkey's here,&#8221; he shouted, springing forward. The evil spirits could barely hold off the two star officers, so when they heard Monkey's great yell at this moment of crisis they turned and fled for their lives into the middle of the sea. Their horns were very good at parting the waters, and they cleared their way through the sea with a whooshing noise, the two star officers and the Great Sage Monkey chasing after them.</P>
<P>A yaksha who was patrolling the Western Ocean with a shelled warrior saw from a distance the way the rhinoceroses were parting the waters, recognized Monkey and the two stars, and rushed back to the crystal palace to report to the dragon king in alarm, &#8220;Your Majesty, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven and two stars from the sky are chasing three rhinoceroses this way.&#8221; When the old dragon king Ao Shun heard this he said to his heir, Prince Mo'ang, &#8220;Muster our water forces at once. I'm sure it must be the three rhinoceros spirits Cold-avoider, Heat-avoider and Dust-avoider who've provoked Sun the Novice. As they're in the sea now we'd better lend a hand.&#8221; Having been given his orders Ao Mo'ang hastened to muster his troops.</P>
<P>A moment later a fully-armed force of tortoises, soft-shelled turtles, alligators, bream, mackerel, mandarin fish, carp, and prawn and crab soldiers charged out of the crystal palace shouting their battle-cries together to stop the rhinoceros spirits. Unable to go any further forward, the rhinoceroses made a hasty retreat, only to find their escape blocked by the stars from the Well and the Horn as well as the Great Sage. In their panic they failed to stay in a group, but scattered as they fled for their lives. Dust-avoider was soon surrounded by the old dragon king's men.</P>
<P>A delighted Monkey called out, &#8220;Stop! Stop! Take him alive! Don't kill him!&#8221; When Mo'ang heard this order he rushed forward, knocked Dust-avoider to the ground, put an iron hook through his snout and tied all his hoofs together.</P>
<P>The old dragon king then divided his forces into two to help the star officers capture the other two monsters. As the young dragon prince led his men forward the Wooden Hyena of the Well reverted to his real form to hold Cold-avoider down and start eating him in big and little bites.</P>
<P>&#8220;Well Star!&#8221; Mo'ang shouted. &#8220;Don't kill him! The Great Sage Monkey wants him alive, not dead.&#8221; Mo'ang shouted several times, but by then the Hyena had already gnawed right through the monster's throat.</P>
<P>Mo'ang ordered his prawn and crab soldiers to carry the dead rhinoceros back to the palace of crystal, then joined the Wooden Hyena of the Well in the pursuit. Heat-avoider, who was being driven back towards them by the Wooden Lesser Dragon of the Horn, ran straight into the star from the Well, at which Mo'ang ordered his tortoises, soft-shelled turtles and alligators to spread out in the winnowing-fan formation to encircle the monster.</P>
<P>&#8220;Spare me, spare me!&#8221; the monster pleaded. The wooden Hyena of the Well sprang forward, grabbed the monster by the ear, seized his sword, and shouted, &#8220;I won't kill you. I won't kill you. I'll take you to the Great Sage Monkey for him to deal with you.&#8221;</P>
<P>The troops then went back to the crystal palace, where they reported, &#8220;We've got them both.&#8221; Monkey saw that one was lying headless and gory on the ground, while the other was being forced to kneel by the Wooden Hyena of the Well twisting his ear.</P>
<P>&#8220;That head wasn't cut off with a weapon,&#8221; Monkey said on going up for a closer look.</P>
<P>&#8220;If I hadn't shouted so hard the star officer of the Well would have eaten the whole of him up,&#8221; replied Mo'ang with a smile. &#8220;Very well then,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case you'd better get a saw to cut off his horns and have his hide removed for us to take. We'll leave the flesh for your worthy father the dragon king and yourself to enjoy.&#8221; A chain was then run through Dust-avoider's nose for the Wooden Lesser Dragon of the Horn to lead him by, and the same was done to Heat-avoider for the Wooden Hyena of the Well.</P>
<P>&#8220;Take them to the prefect of Jinping,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Investigate them, question them about all the years they masqueraded as Buddhas to harm the people, then off with their heads.&#8221;</P>
<P>They all then did as Monkey told them, taking their leave of the dragon king and his son and emerging from the Western Ocean, leading the rhinoceroses with them. When they met the other two stars from the Strider and the Dipper they went by cloud straight back to Jinping Prefecture.</P>
<P>Here Monkey called out as he stood in mid air on a beam of auspicious light, &#8220;Mr. Prefect, subordinate officials, soldiers and civilians of Jinping, listen to what I say. We are holy monks sent by the Great Tang in the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven. In this prefecture and its counties you have had to make offerings in golden lamps every year to these rhinoceros monsters pretending to be Buddhas coming down to earth. When we came here and were admiring the lamps at the Moon Festival these monsters carried the oil and our master off together. I asked for some gods from heaven to capture them. We've cleaned out their cave and wiped out the monsters. They won't be able to give you any more trouble. You needn't waste the people's money making offerings in golden lamps here any more.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Pig and Friar Sand, who were just escorting the master back into the Clouds of Compassion Monastery, heard Monkey talking from up in the sky they abandoned their master, dropped the luggage and shot up into the air by cloud to ask Monkey about how the demons had been beaten.</P>
<P>&#8220;One of them was chewed to death by the star from the Well,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and we've got his sawn-off horns and his hide with us. The other two we've brought back alive.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Throw the pair of them down into the city,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;for the officials and everyone else to see. Then they'll know we're gods and sages. I'll trouble you four star officers to put your clouds away, land, and come into the prefectural court with us to execute the monsters. The facts are clear and the penalty's the right one. There's nothing else to be said.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Marshal Tian Peng is right, and he knows the laws too,&#8221; the four stars said.</P>
<P>&#8220;I have learned a bit during my years as a monk,&#8221; Pig replied.</P>
<P>The gods then pushed the rhinoceroses, which fell wreathed in coloured clouds into the prefectural court, to the astonishment of the prefectutal officials and everyone else inside and outside the walled city, who all set up incense tables outside their houses, and bowed their heads to worship the gods from heaven. A little later the monks of the Clouds of Compassion Monastery carried the venerable elder into the court in a sedan chair.</P>
<P>When Sanzang met Monkey he kept thanking him, adding, &#8220;I am very grateful for the trouble I have put the star officers to in rescuing us. I had been very anxious when I did not see you, worthy disciple, but now you have returned in triumph. I wonder where you had to chase the monsters to before you caught them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;After I left you the day before yesterday,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;I went up to heaven to make some enquiries. The Metal Planet knew that the monsters were rhinoceroses, so he told me to ask for the four beast stars that belong to the element wood. So I submitted a memorial to the Jade Emperor and he sent them straight to the mouth of the cave, where they gave battle. When the demon kings fled, the stars from the Dipper and the Strider rescued you, Master, I chased the demons with the Well and the Horn stars straight to the Western Ocean, where the dragon king sent his son out with their troops to help us. That's how the monsters were captured and brought here for questioning.&#8221; The venerable elder was full of endless praise and thanks. The prefectural and county officials and their subordinates all lit precious candles and whole containers of incense sticks as they kowtowed in respect,</P>
<P>A little later Pig lost his temper, pulled out his monastic knife and beheaded first Dust-avoider, then Heat-avoider, each with a single stroke. Then he removed their four horns with a saw. The Great Sage Monkey then had another suggestion to make: &#8220;You four star officers must take these four rhinoceros horns to the upper world to offer to the Jade Emperor as trophies when you report back on your mission.&#8221; As for the two horns he had brought back from the sea, he said, &#8220;We'll leave one here to guard the storehouses of the prefectural palace and as evidence that from now on no more lamp-oil will ever be levied. We'll take the other to offer to the Lord Buddha on Vulture Peak.&#8221; The four stars were delighted, and after bowing to take their leave of the Great Sage they rose by coloured cloud to report back to the Jade Emperor.</P>
<P>The prefectural and county officials kept the master and his disciples for a great vegetarian banquet to which all the rural officials were also invited. Notices were issued to tell the military and civil population that golden lamps were not to be lit the next year, and that the duty of serving as an oil-purchasing household was abolished for ever. Butchers meanwhile were instructed to remove the rhinoceros skins to be steeped in saltpeter and smoked dry for making into armor, while the flesh was to be distributed to the officials. At the same time money and grain that had been raised by unjust fines on innocent people were spent to buy a plot of privately-owned empty land. On this a temple to the four stars who had put the demons down, as well as a shrine to the Tang Priest and his three disciples, were to be built. Stone tablets with inscriptions were to be set up for each of them to record their deeds for ever as a mark of gratitude.</P>
<P>Master and disciples relaxed and enjoyed the offerings. They had hardly a moment to themselves as they had so many invitations from the 240 lamp-oil households. Pig was delighted to have so much to eat, and he always kept in his sleeve some of the treasures he had collected in the cave to give to all his hosts to thank them for their banquets. When they had stayed there for a month and were still unable to get away the Tang Priest ordered Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong, give all the remaining valuables to the monks in the Clouds of Compassion Monastery. Let's leave before dawn, without letting the rich families here know. If we are so eager to enjoy ourselves here that we delay in fetching the scriptures we may offend the Lord Buddha and cause some catastrophe. That would be terrible.&#8221; Monkey then disposed of all the objects.</P>
<P>When they got up early the next morning at the fifth watch Pig was woken up to get the horse ready. The idiot had eaten and drunk so well that he was still half asleep as he said, &#8220;Why get the horse ready so early?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The master says we've got to be going,&#8221; Monkey shouted.</P>
<P>&#8220;That reverend gentleman doesn't do things right,&#8221; the idiot said, rubbing his eyes. &#8220;We've had invitations from all 240 of the big families, but only had thirty or so good vegetarian meals so far. How can he be making me go hungry again?&#8221;</P>
<P>When the venerable elder heard this he retorted abusively, &#8220;Dreg-guzzling idiot! Stop talking such nonsense! Get up at once! If you go on arguing back like that I'll tell Wukong to smash your teeth in with his gold-banded cudgel.&#8221;</P>
<P>At the mention of a beating the idiot gesticulated frantically as he said, &#8220;The master's changed. Usually he favours me and likes me and protects me because I'm so stupid. When you want to hit me, brother, he usually persuades you not to. So why's he dead set on telling you to hit me today?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The master's angry with you for being so greedy,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and holding us up on our journey. If you don't want me to hit you, pack the luggage and get the horse ready.&#8221;</P>
<P>As the idiot really was scared of being hit he jumped out of bed, got dressed and shouted to Friar Sand, &#8220;Get up right now! He's going to start hitting.&#8221; Friar Sand then jumped up too, and they both got everything packed.</P>
<P>&#8220;Keep quiet,&#8221; said the Tang Priest, waving his hands about, &#8220;and don't disturb the monks.&#8221; He quickly mounted, after which they opened the gate of the monastery and found their way out. Indeed, this departure was</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Letting the phoenix escape from the birdcage of jade;</P>
<P>Secretly opening locks so the dragon goes free.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know what the households who still wanted to thank them did at daybreak, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>三僧大战青龙山</p>
<p>四星挟捉犀牛怪</p>
</div>
<p>却说孙大圣挟同二弟滚着风，驾着云，向东北艮地上，顷刻至青龙山玄英洞口，按落云头。八戒就欲筑门，行者道：“且消停，待我进去看看师父生死如何，再好与他争持。”沙僧道：</p>

<p>“这门闭紧，如何得进？”行者道：“我自有法力。”好大圣，收了棒，捻着诀，念声咒语，叫“变！”即变做个火焰虫儿。真个也疾伶！你看他：展翅星流光灿，古云腐草为萤。神通变化不非轻，自有徘徊之性。飞近石门悬看，旁边瑕缝穿风。将身一纵到幽庭，打探妖魔动静。他自飞入，只见几只牛横敧直倒，一个个呼吼如雷，尽皆睡熟。又至中厅里面，全无消息。四下门户通关，不知那三个妖精睡在何处。才转过厅房，向后又照，只闻得啼泣之声，乃是唐僧锁在后房檐柱上哭哩。行者暗暗听他哭甚，只见他哭道：“一别长安十数年，登山涉水苦熬煎。幸来西域逢佳节，喜到金平遇上元。不识灯中假佛像，概因命里有灾愆。贤徒追袭施威武，但愿英雄展大权。”行者闻言，满心欢喜，展开翅，飞近师前。唐僧揩泪道：“呀！西方景象不同，此时正月，蛰虫始振，为何就有萤飞？”行者忍不住，叫声：“师父，我来了！”</p>

<p>唐僧喜道：“悟空，我心说正月怎得萤火，原来是你。”行者即现了本相道：“师父啊，为你不识真假，误了多少路程，费了多少心力。我一行说不是好人，你就下拜，却被这怪侮暗灯光，盗取酥合香油，连你都摄将来了。我当吩咐八戒沙僧回寺看守，我即闻风追至此间，不识地名，幸遇四值功曹传报，说此山名青龙山玄英洞。我日间与此怪斗至天晚方回，与师弟辈细道此情，却就不曾睡，同他两个来此。我恐夜深不便交战，又不知师父下落，所以变化进来，打听师情。”唐僧喜道：“八戒沙僧如今在外边哩？”行者道：“在外边，才子老孙看时，妖精都睡着。我且解了锁，搠开门，带你出去罢。”唐僧点头称谢。</p>

<p>行者使个解锁法，用手一抹，那锁早自开了，领着师父往前正走，忽听得妖王在中厅内房里叫道：“小的们，紧闭门户，小心火烛。这会怎么不叫更巡逻，梆铃都不响了？”原来那伙小妖征战一日，俱辛辛苦苦睡着，听见叫唤，却才醒了。梆铃响处，有几个执器械的，敲着锣从后而走，可可的撞着他师徒两个。众小妖一齐喊道：“好和尚啊！扭开锁往那里去！”行者不容分说，掣出棒幌一幌，碗来粗细，就打。棒起处，打死两个，其余的丢了器械，近中厅打着门叫：“大王！不好了！不好了！毛脸和尚在家里打杀人了！”那三怪听见，一毂辘爬将起来，只教“拿住！拿住！”唬得个唐僧手软脚软。行者也不顾师父，一路棒，滚向前来。众小妖遮架不住，被他放倒三两个，推倒两三个，打开几层门，径自出来，叫道：“兄弟们何在？”八戒沙僧正举着钯杖等待，道：“哥哥，如何了？”行者将变化入里解放师父正走，被妖惊觉，顾不得师父，打出来的事，讲说一遍不题。</p>

<p>那妖王把唐僧捉住，依然使铁索锁了，执着刀，轮着斧，灯火齐明，问道：“你这厮怎样开锁，那猴子如何得进，快早供来，饶你之命！不然，就一刀两段！”慌得那唐僧，战战兢兢的跪道：</p>

<p>“大王爷爷！我徒弟孙悟空，他会七十二般变化。才变个火焰虫儿，飞进来救我。不期大王知觉，被小大王等撞见，是我徒弟不知好歹，打伤两个，众皆喊叫，举兵着火，他遂顾不得我，走出去了。”三个妖王，呵呵大笑道：“早是惊觉，未曾走了！”叫小的们把前后门紧紧关闭，亦不喧哗。沙僧道：“闭门不喧哗，想是暗弄我师父，我们动手耶！”行者道：“说的是，快早打门。”那呆子卖弄神通，举钯尽力筑去，把那石门筑得粉碎，却又厉声喊骂道：“偷油的贼怪！快送吾师出来也！”唬得那门内小妖滚将进去报道：“大王，不好了！不好了！前门被和尚打破了！”三个妖王十分烦恼道：“这厮着实无礼！”即命取披挂结束了，各持兵器，帅小妖出门迎敌。此时约有三更时候，半天中月明如昼。走出来，更不打话，便就轮兵。这里行者抵住钺斧，八戒敌住大刀，沙僧迎住大棍。这场好杀：僧三众，棍杖钯，三个妖魔胆气加。钺斧钢刀藤纥褡，只闻风响并尘沙。初交几合喷愁雾，次后飞腾散彩霞，钉钯解数随身滚，铁棒英豪更可夸。降妖宝杖人间少，妖怪顽心不让他。钺斧口明尖鐏利，藤条节懞一身花。大刀幌亮如门扇，和尚神通偏赛他。这壁厢因师性命发狠打，那壁厢不放唐僧劈脸挝。斧剁棒迎争胜负，钯轮刀砍两交搽。扢挞藤条降怪杖，翻翻复复逞豪华。三僧三怪，赌斗多时，不见输赢。那辟寒大王喊一声，叫：“小的们上来！”众精各执兵刃齐来，早把个八戒绊倒在地，被几个水牛精，揪揪扯扯，拖入洞里捆了。沙僧见没了八戒，只见那群牛发喊咙声。即掣宝杖，望辟尘大王虚丢了架子要走，又被群精一拥而来，拉了个躘踵，急挣不起，也被捉去捆了。行者觉道难为，纵筋斗云，脱身而去。当时把八戒沙僧拖至唐僧前。唐僧见了，满眼垂泪道：</p>

<p>“可怜你二人也遭了毒手！悟空何在？”沙僧道：“师兄见捉住我们，他就走了。”唐僧道：“他既走了，必然那里去求救。但我等不知何日方得脱网。”师徒们凄凄惨惨不题。</p>

<p>却说行者驾筋斗云复至慈云寺，寺僧接着，来问：“唐老爷救得否？”行者道：“难救！难救！那妖精神通广大，我弟兄三个，与他三个斗了多时，被他呼小妖先捉了八戒，后捉了沙僧，老孙幸走脱了。”众僧害怕道：“爷爷这般会腾云驾雾，还捉获不得，想老师父被倾害也。”行者道：“不妨！不妨！我师父自有伽蓝、揭谛、丁甲等神暗中护佑，却也曾吃过草还丹，料不伤命，只是那妖精有本事。汝等可好看马匹行李，等老孙上天去求救兵来。”众僧胆怯道：“爷爷又能上天？”行者笑道：“天宫原是我的旧家。当年我做齐天大圣，因为乱了蟠桃会，被我佛收降，如今没奈何，保唐僧取经，将功折罪。一路上辅正除邪，我师父该有此难，汝等却不知也。”众僧听此言，又磕头礼拜。行者出得门，打个唿哨，即时不见。</p>

<p>好大圣，早至西天门外，忽见太白金星与增长天王，殷、朱、陶、许四大灵官讲话。他见行者来，都慌忙施礼道：“大圣那里去？”行者道：“因保唐僧行至天竺国东界金平府旻天县，我师被本县慈云寺僧留赏元宵。比至金灯桥，有金灯三盏，点灯用酥合香油，价贵白金五万余两，年年有诸佛降祥受用。正看时，果有三尊佛像降临，我师不识好歹，上桥就拜。我说不是好人，早被他侮暗灯光，连油并我师一风摄去。我随风追袭，至天晓到一山，幸四功曹报道，那山名青龙山，山有玄英洞，洞有三怪，名辟寒大王、辟暑大王、辟尘大王。老孙急上门寻讨，与他赌斗一阵，未胜。是我变化入里，见师父锁住未伤，随解了欲出，又被他知觉，我遂走了。后又同八戒沙僧苦战，复被他将二人也捉去捆了。老孙因此特启玉帝，查他来历，请命将降之。”</p>

<p>金星呵呵冷笑道：“大圣既与妖怪相持，岂看不出他的出处？”</p>

<p>行者道：“认便认得，是一伙牛精。只是他大有神通，急不能降也。”金星道：“那是三个犀牛之精。他因有天文之象，累年修悟成真，亦能飞云步雾。其怪极爱干净，常嫌自己影身，每欲下水洗浴。他的名色也多：有兕犀，有雄犀，有牯犀，有斑犀，又有胡冒犀、堕罗犀、通天花文犀，都是一孔三毛二角，行于江海之中，能开水道。似那辟寒、辟暑、辟尘都是角有贵气，故以此为名而称大王也。若要拿他，只是四木禽星见面就伏。”行者连忙唱喏问道：“是那四木禽星？烦长庚老一一明示明示。”金星笑道：“此星在斗牛宫外，罗布乾坤。你去奏闻玉帝，便见分晓。”</p>

<p>行者拱拱手称谢，径入天门里去。</p>

<p>不一时，到于通明殿下，先见葛邱张许四大天师。天师问道：“何往？”行者道：“近行至金平府地方，因我师宽放禅性，元夜观灯，遇妖魔摄去。老孙不能收降，特来奏闻玉帝求救。”四天师即领行者至灵霄宝殿启奏。各各礼毕，备言其事，玉帝传旨：“教点那路天兵相助？”行者奏道：“老孙才到西天门，遇长庚星说，那怪是犀牛成精，惟四木禽星可以降伏。”玉帝即差许天师同行者去斗牛宫点四木禽星下界收降。</p>

<p>及至宫外，早有二十八宿星辰来接，天师道：“吾奉圣旨，教点四木禽星与孙大圣下界降妖。”旁即闪过角木蛟、斗木獬、奎木狼、井木犴应声呼道：“孙大圣，点我等何处降妖？”行者笑道：“原来是你。这长庚老儿却隐匿，我不解其意，早说是二十八宿中的四木，老孙径来相请，又何必劳烦旨意？”四木道：“大圣说那里话！我等不奉旨意，谁敢擅离？端的是那方？快早去来。”行者道：“在金平府东北艮地青龙山玄英洞，犀牛成精。”</p>

<p>斗木獬、奎木狼、角木蛟道：“若果是犀牛成精，不须我们，只消井宿去罢。他能上山吃虎，下海擒犀。”行者道：“那犀不比望月之犀，乃是修行得道，都有千年之寿者。须得四位同去才好，切勿推调，倘一时一位拿他不住，却不又费事了？”天师道：“你们说得是甚话！旨意着你四人，岂可不去？趁早飞行，我回旨去也。”那天师遂别行者而去。四木道：“大圣不必迟疑，你先去索战，引他出来，我们随后动手。”行者即近前骂道：“偷油的贼怪！还我师来！”原来那门被八戒筑破，几个小妖弄了几块板儿搪住，在里边听得骂詈，急跑进报道：“大王，孙和尚在外面骂哩！”辟尘儿道：“他败阵去了，这一日怎么又来？想是那里求些救兵来了。”辟寒、辟暑道：“怕他甚么救兵！快取披挂来！小的们，都要用心围绕，休放他走了。”那伙精不知死活，一个个各执枪刀，摇旗擂鼓，走出洞来，对行者喝道：“你个不怕打的猢狲儿，你又来了！”行者最恼得是这猢狲二字，咬牙发狠举铁棒就打。三个妖王，调小妖，跑个圈子阵，把行者圈在垓心。那壁厢四木禽星一个个各轮兵刃道：“孽畜！休动手！”那三个妖王看他四星，自然害怕，俱道：“不好了！不好了！他寻将降手儿来了！小的们，各顾性命走耶！”只听得呼呼吼吼，喘喘呵呵，众小妖都现了本身：原来是那山牛精、水牛精、黄牛精，满山乱跑。那三个妖王，也现了本相，放下手来，还是四只蹄子，就如铁炮一般，径往东北上跑。这大圣帅井木犴、角木蛟紧追急赶，略不放松。惟有斗木獬、奎木狼在东山凹里、山头上、山涧中、山谷内，把些牛精打死的、活捉的，尽皆收净。却向玄英洞里解了唐僧、八戒、沙僧。沙僧认得是二星，随同拜谢，因问：“二位如何到此相救？”二星道：“吾等是孙大圣奏玉帝请旨调来收怪救你也。”唐僧又滴泪道：“我悟空徒弟怎么不见进来？”二星道：“那三个老怪是三只犀牛，他见吾等，各各顾命，向东北艮方逃遁。孙大圣帅井木犴、角木蛟追赶去了。我二星扫荡群牛到此，特来解放圣僧。”唐僧复又顿首拜谢，朝天又拜，八戒搀起道：“师父，礼多必诈，不须只管拜了。四星官一则是玉帝圣旨，二则是师兄人情。今既扫荡群妖，还不知老妖如何降伏，我们且收拾些细软东西出来，掀翻此洞，以绝其根，回寺等候师兄罢。”奎木狼道：“天蓬元帅说得有理。你与卷帘大将保护你师回寺安歇，待吾等还去艮方迎敌。”八戒道：“正是，正是，你二位还协同一捉，必须剿尽，方好回旨。”二星官即时追袭。八戒与沙僧将他洞内细软宝贝，有许多珊瑚、玛瑙、珍珠、琥珀、琗琚、宝贝、美玉、良金，搜出一石，搬在外面，请师父到山崖上坐了，他又进去放起火来，把一座洞烧成灰烬，却才领唐僧找路回金平慈云寺去。正是：经云泰极还生否，好处逢凶实有之。</p>

<p>爱赏花灯禅性乱，喜游美景道心漓。大丹自古宜长守，一失原来到底亏。紧闭牢拴休旷荡，须臾懈怠见参差。</p>

<p>且不言他三众得命回寺，却表斗木獬、奎木狼二星官驾云直向东北艮方赶妖怪来。二人在那半空中，寻看不见，直到西洋大海，远望见孙大圣在海上吆喝。他两个按落云头道：“大圣，妖怪那里去了？”行者恨道：“你两个怎么不来追降？这会子却冒冒失失的问甚？”斗木獬道：“我见大圣与井、角二星战败妖魔追赶，料必擒拿。我二人却就扫荡群精，入玄英洞救出你师父、师弟。搜了山，烧了洞，把你师父付托与你二弟领回府城慈云寺。多时不见车驾回转，故又追寻到此也。”行者闻言，方才喜谢道：“如此，却是有功，多累！多累！但那三个妖魔，被我赶到此间，他就钻下海去。当有井、角二星，紧紧追拿，教老孙在岸边抵挡。你两个既来，且在岸边把截，等老孙也再去来。”</p>

<p>好大圣，轮着棒，捻着诀，辟开水径，直入波涛深处，只见那三个妖魔在水底下与井木犴、角木蛟舍死忘生苦斗哩。他跳近前喊道：“老孙来也！”那妖精抵住二星官，措手不及，正在危难之处，忽听得行者叫喊，顾残生，拨转头往海心里飞跑。原来这怪头上角，极能分水，只闻得花花花，冲开明路。这后边二星官并孙大圣并力追之。</p>

<p>却说西海中有个探海的夜叉，巡海的介士，远见犀牛分开水势，又认得孙大圣与二天星，即赴水晶宫对龙王慌慌张张报道：“大王！有三只犀牛，被齐天大圣和二位天星赶来也！”老龙王敖顺听言，即唤太子摩昂：“快点水兵，想是犀牛精辟寒、辟暑、辟尘儿三个惹了孙行者。今既至海，快快拔刀相助。”敖摩昂得令，即忙点兵。顷刻间，龟鳖鼋鼍，鯾鱼白鳜鲤，与虾兵蟹卒等，各执枪刀，一齐呐喊，腾出水晶宫外，挡住犀牛精。犀牛精不能前进，急退后，又有井、角二星并大圣拦阻，慌得他失了群，各各逃生，四散奔走，早把个辟尘儿被老龙王领兵围住。孙大圣见了心欢，叫道：“消停消停！捉活的，不要死的。”摩昂听令，一拥上前，将辟尘儿扳翻在地，用铁钩子穿了鼻，攒蹄捆倒。</p>

<p>老龙王又传号令，教分兵赶那两个，协助二星官擒拿。即时小龙王帅众前来，只见井木犴现原身，按住辟寒儿，大口小口的啃着吃哩。摩昂高叫道：“井宿！井宿！莫咬死他，孙大圣要活的，不要死的哩。”连喊数喊，已是被他把颈项咬断了。摩昂吩咐虾兵蟹卒，将个死犀牛抬转水晶宫，却又与井木犴向前追赶。只见角木蛟把那辟暑儿倒赶回来，只撞着井宿。摩昂帅龟鳖鼋鼍，撒开簸箕阵围住，那怪只教：“饶命！饶命！”井木犴走近前，一把揪住耳朵，夺了他的刀，叫道：“不杀你！不杀你！</p>

<p>拿与孙大圣发落去来。”当即倒干戈，复至水晶宫外报道：“都捉来也。”行者见一个断了头，血淋津的倒在地下，一个被井木犴拖着耳朵，推跪在地，近前仔细看了道：“这头不是兵刀伤的啊。”摩昂笑道：“不是我喊得紧，连身子都着井星官吃了。”行者道：“既是如此，也罢，取锯子来，锯下他的这两只角，剥了皮带去。犀牛肉还留与龙王贤父子享之。”又把辟尘儿穿了鼻，教角木蛟牵着；辟暑儿也穿了鼻，教井木犴牵着：“带他上金平府见那刺史官，明究其由，问他个积年假佛害民，然后的决。”</p>

<p>众等遵言，辞龙王父子，都出西海，牵着犀牛，会着奎、斗二星，驾云雾，径转金平府。行者足踏祥光，半空中叫道：“金平府刺史、各佐贰郎官并府城内外军民人等听着：吾乃东土大唐差往西天取经的圣僧。你这府县每年家供献金灯，假充诸佛降祥者，即此犀牛之怪。我等过此，因元夜观灯，见这怪将灯油并我师父摄去，是我请天神收伏。今已扫清山洞，剿尽妖魔，不得为害，以后你府县再不可供献金灯，劳民伤财也。”那慈云寺里，八戒沙僧方保唐僧进得山门，只听见行者在半空言语，即便撇了师父，丢下担子，纵风云起到空中，问行者降妖之事。行者道：“那一只被井星咬死，已锯角剥皮带来，两只活拿在此。”</p>

<p>八戒道：“这两个索性推下此城，与官员人等看看，也认得我们是圣是神，左右累四位星官收云下地，同到府堂，将这怪的决。</p>

<p>已此情真罪当，再有甚讲！”四星道：“天蓬帅近来知理明律，却好呀！”八戒道：“因做了这几年和尚，也略学得些儿。”</p>

<p>众神果推落犀牛，一簇彩云，降至府堂之上。唬得这府县官员，城里城外人等，都家家设香案，户户拜天神。少时间，慈云寺僧把长老用轿抬进府门，会着行者，口中不离“谢”字道：</p>

<p>“有劳上宿星官救出我等，因不见贤徒，悬悬在念，今幸得胜而回！然此怪不知赶向何方才捕获也！”行者道：“自前日别了尊师，老孙上天查访，蒙太白金星识得妖魔是犀牛，指示请四木禽星。当时奏闻玉帝，蒙旨差委，直至洞口交战。妖王走了，又蒙斗、奎二宿救出尊师。老孙与井、角二宿并力追妖，直赶到西洋大海，又亏龙王遣子帅兵相助，所以捕获到此审究也。”长老赞扬称谢不已。又见那府县正官并佐贰首领，都在那里高烧宝烛，满斗焚香，朝上礼拜。少顷间，八戒发起性来，掣出戒刀，将辟尘儿头一刀砍下，又一刀把辟暑儿头也砍下，随即取锯子锯下四只角来。孙大圣更有主张，就教：“四位星官，将此四只犀角拿上界去，进贡玉帝，回缴圣旨。”把自己带来的二只：“留一只在府堂镇库，以作向后免征灯油之证；我们带一只去，献灵山佛祖。”四星心中大喜，即时拜别大圣，忽驾彩云回奏而去。</p>

<p>府县官留住他师徒四众，大排素宴，遍请乡官陪奉。一壁厢出给告示，晓谕军民人等，下年不许点设金灯，永蠲买油大户之役；一壁厢叫屠子宰剥犀牛之皮，硝熟熏干，制造铠甲，把肉普给官员人等；又一壁厢动支枉罚无碍钱粮，买民间空地，起建四星降妖之庙；又为唐僧四众建立生祠，各各树碑刻文，用传千古，以为报谢。师徒们索性宽怀领受，又被那二百四十家灯油大户，这家酬，那家请，略无虚刻。八戒遂心满意受用，把洞里搜来的宝物，每样各笼些须在袖，以为各家斋筵之赏。</p>

<p>住经个月，犹不得起身，长老吩咐：“悟空，将余剩的宝物，尽送慈云寺僧，以为酬礼。瞒着那些大户人家，天不明走罢。恐只管贪乐，误了取经，惹佛祖见罪、又生灾厄，深为不便。”行者随将前件一一处分。</p>

<p>次日五更早起，唤八戒备马。那呆子吃了自在酒饭，睡得梦梦乍道：“这早备马怎的？”行者喝道：“师父教走路哩！”呆子抹抹脸道：“又是这长老没正经！二百四十家大户都请，才吃了有三十几顿饱斋，怎么又弄老猪忍饿！”长老听言骂道：“馕糟的夯货！莫胡说！快早起来！再若强嘴，教悟空拿金箍棒打牙！”</p>

<p>那呆子听见说打，慌了手脚道：“师父今番变了，常时疼我爱我，念我蠢夯护我，哥要打时，他又劝解；今日怎么发狠转教打么？”行者道：“师父怪你为嘴误了路程，快早收拾行李备马，免打！”那呆子真个怕打，跳起来穿了衣服，吆喝沙僧：“快起来！</p>

<p>打将来了！”沙僧也随跳起，各各收拾皆完。长老摇手道：“寂寂悄悄的，不要惊动寺僧。”连忙上马，开了山门，找路而去。这一去，正所谓：暗放玉笼飞彩凤，私开金锁走蛟龙。毕竟不知天明时，酬谢之家端的如何，且听下回分解。</p>
