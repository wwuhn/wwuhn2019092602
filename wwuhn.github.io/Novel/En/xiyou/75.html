<P>Li Changgeng Reports the Demons' Vicious Nature</P>
<P>The Novice Displays His Powers of Transformation</P>
</div>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Emotions and desires are in origin all the same;</P>
<P>Both emotions and desires are completely natural.</P>
<P>Many a gentleman refines himself in the Buddhist faith;</P>
<P>When desire and emotions are forgotten, dhyana conies.</P>
<P>Don't be impatient; be firm of heart;</P>
<P>Be free of dust like the moon in the sky.</P>
<P>Make no mistake in your labors and your progress;</P>
<P>When your efforts are completed you will be an enlightened immortal.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story tells how Sanzang and his disciples, having broken through the net of desires and escaped from the prison-house of the emotions, let the horse travel West. Before they had been going for very long the summer was over and the new coolness of early autumn was refreshing their bodies. What they saw was:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Driving rains sweeping away the last of the heat,</P>
<P>Alarming the leaf of the parasol tree.</P>
<P>At evening glow-worms flew by the sedge path</P>
<P>While crickets sang beneath the moon.</P>
<P>The golden mallows opened in the dew;</P>
<P>Red knotweed covered the sandbanks.</P>
<P>Rushes and willows were the first to lose their leaves</P>
<P>As cold cicadas sang in tune.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As Sanzang was travelling along a high mountain appeared in front of him. Its peak thrust up into the azure void, touching the stars and blocking out the sun. In his alarm the venerable elder said to Monkey, &#8220;Look at that mountain in front of us. It's very high. I don't know whether the path will take us across.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a thing to say, Master,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile. &#8220;As the old saying goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>However high the mountain there will be a way across;</P>
<P>However deep the river there's always a ferryman.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>There's no reason why we shouldn't get over it. Stop worrying and carry on.&#8221; When Sanzang heard this his face broke out in smiles and he whipped his horse forward to climb straight up the high crag.</P>
<P>After a mile or two an old man appeared. His white hair was tangled and flying in the wind while his sparse whiskers were being blown about like silver threads. He wore a string of prayer-beads round his neck and held a dragon-headed walkingstick as he stood far away at the top of the slope shouting, &#8220;Venerable gentleman travelling West, stop your worthy steed. Rein in. There is a band of demons on this mountain who have eaten all the people in the continent of Jambu. Go no further!&#8221;</P>
<P>At this Sanzang turned pale with terror, and because the horse was not standing steadily and he himself was not well seated in the carved saddle he crashed to the ground and lay in the grass, moaning but unable to move.</P>
<P>Monkey went over to help him to his feet with the words, &#8220;Don't be afraid, don't be afraid. I'm here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Did you hear the old man up on the crag telling us that there's a band of demons on this mountain who have eaten everyone in the continent of Jambu?&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;Who'll dare go to ask him what this is really all about?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Sit there while I go and ask him,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;With your ugly face and coarse language I'm afraid you may shock him,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;so you won't get the truth from him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll make myself a bit better looking before questioning him,&#8221; laughed Brother Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Do a change to show me,&#8221; said Sanzang, and the splendid Great Sage made a spell with his fingers, shook himself, and turned into a very neat little monk, clear-eyed, fine-browed, round-headed and regular of features. He moved in a most refined way and said nothing vulgar when he opened his mouth.</P>
<P>Brushing his brocade tunic he stepped forward and said to the Tang Priest, &#8220;Master, have I changed for the better?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the delighted Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;Marvellous,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;but the rest of us look shabby by comparison. Even if I rolled around for two or three years on end I couldn't make myself look as elegant as that.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage left them behind as he went straight up to the old man, bowed to him and said, &#8220;Greetings, venerable sir.&#8221; Seeing how young and cultivated he looked, the old man returned his greeting and stroked his head in an offhand way.</P>
<P>&#8220;Little monk,&#8221; the old man said with a smile, &#8220;where have you come from?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We are from the Great Tang in the East,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;going to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures. When we came here and heard you tell us that there are demons here my master was terrified. He sent me to ask you about them. What sort of evil spirits would dare go in for that sort of crime? I would trouble you, venerable sir, to tell me all the details so that I can put them in their place and send them on their way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're much too young, little monk,&#8221; said the old man with a smile, &#8220;to know what's good for you. Your remarks aren't helpful. Those evil spirits have tremendous magical powers. How can you have the nerve to talk of putting them in their place and sending them on their way?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;From what you are saying,&#8221; Monkey replied with a smile, &#8220;you seem to be trying to protect them. You must be a relation of theirs, or else a neighbour or a friend. Why else would you be promoting their prestige and boosting their morale, and refusing to pour out everything you know about their background?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You certainly know how to talk, monk,&#8221; said the old man, nodding and smiling. &#8220;I suppose you must have learned some magic arts while travelling with your master. Perhaps you know how to drive away and capture goblins, or have exorcised people's houses for them. But you've never come up against a really vicious monster.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What sort of vicious?&#8221; Monkey said.</P>
<P>&#8220;If those evil spirits send a letter to Vulture Mountain the five hundred arhats all come out to meet them,&#8221; the old man said. &#8220;If they send a note to the Heavenly Palace the Ten Bright Shiners all turn out to pay their respects. The dragons of the Four Oceans were their friends and they often meet the immortals of the Eight Caves. The Ten Kings of the Underworld call them brothers; the local gods and city gods are good friends of theirs.</P>
<P>When the Great Sage heard this he could not help bursting into loud guffaws. &#8220;Stop talking,&#8221; he said, grabbing hold of the old man, &#8220;stop talking. Even if that demon is friends with all those young whippersnappers, my juniors, that's nothing really remarkable. If he knew I was coming he'd clear off the same night.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're talking nonsense, little monk,&#8221; the old man said. &#8220;How can any of those sages be juniors and young whippersnappers to you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;To be truthful with you,&#8221; Monkey replied with a grin, &#8220;my people have lived for many generations in the Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit in the land of Aolai. My name is Sun Wukong. In the old days I used to be an evil spirit too and did some great things. Once I fell asleep after drinking too much at a feast with the other demons and dreamed that two men came to drag me off to the World of Darkness. I got so angry that I wounded the demon judges with my gold-banded cudgel. The kings of the Underworld were terrified and I practically turned the Senluo Palace upside-down. The judges in charge of the case were so scared that they fetched some paper for the Ten Kings to sign. They promised to treat me as their senior if I let them off a beating.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Amitabha Buddha!&#8221; exclaimed the old man when he heard this. &#8220;If you talk big like that you won't be able to grow any older.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm old enough, fellow,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;How old are you then?&#8221; the old man asked. &#8220;Guess,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Six or seven,&#8221; the old man said. &#8220;I'm ten thousand times as old as that,&#8221; laughed Monkey, &#8220;I'll show you my old face, then you'll believe me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you have another face?&#8221; the old man asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;This little monk has seventy-two faces,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>Not realizing that Monkey really had these powers the old man went on questioning him till Monkey rubbed his face and turned back into himself, with his protruding teeth, big mouth, red thighs and tigerskin kilt round his waist. As he stood there at the foot of the rocky scar, holding his gold-banded cudgel, he was the living image of a thunder god. The sight of him made the old man turn pale with terror and go so weak at the knees that he could not keep himself upright but collapsed to the ground. When he got to his feet again he lost his balance once more.</P>
<P>&#8220;Old man,&#8221; said the Great Sage, going up to him, &#8220;don't get yourself so frightened over nothing. I may look evil but I'm good inside. Don't be afraid! You were kind enough just now to tell us that there are demons here. Could I trouble you to let me know how many of them there are? I'll thank you very much if you do.&#8221; The old man trembled, unable to speak and acting as if deaf. He replied not a word.</P>
<P>Getting no answer from him, Monkey went back down the slope.</P>
<P>&#8220;So you are back, Wukong,&#8221; Sanzang said. &#8220;What did you find out?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's nothing,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile, &#8220;nothing. Even if there are one or two evil spirits on the way to the Western Heaven, the people here only worry so much about them because they're such cowards. No problem! I'm here!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Did you ask him what mountain this was and what cave,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;how many monsters there are, and which is the way to Thunder Monastery?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please excuse me if I speak frankly, Master,&#8221; put in Pig. &#8220;When it comes to transformations, trickery and deception, then four or five of us would be no match for Brother Monkey. But a whole parade of Monkeys couldn't touch me for honesty.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's right,&#8221; said the Tang Priest, &#8220;that's right. You're honest.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Goodness knows why,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;but he just rushed in without a second thought, asked a couple of questions, and came running back in an awful mess. I'm going to find out the truth.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do be careful, Wuneng,&#8221; said the Tang Priest.</P>
<P>The splendid idiot put his rake in his belt, straightened up his tunic, and swaggered straight up the slope to call to the old man, &#8220;Respectful greetings, sir.&#8221; The old man had finally managed to get back on his feet with the help of his stick after seeing that Monkey had gone, and was still shaking and about to depart when Pig suddenly appeared.</P>
<P>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; he said, more shocked than ever, &#8220;whatever kind of nightmare am I in the middle of? The first monk was ugly enough, but at least he looked a little bit human. But this one's got a snout like a pestle, ears like rush fans, a face like iron plates, and a neck covered in bristles. It doesn't look at all human.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You must be in a very bad mood to run me down like that, old man,&#8221; laughed Pig. &#8220;Is that how you see me? Ugly I may be, but if you can bear to look at me for a while you'll find I get quite handsome.&#8221;</P>
<P>Only when the old man heard Pig using human speech did he address him by asking, &#8220;Where are you from?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm the Tang Priest's second disciple,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;and my Buddhist names are Wuneng or Bajie. The one who came and asked you questions just now was Sun Wukong the Novice, the senior disciple. My master has sent me to pay my respects to you because he's angry with Sun Wukong for offending you and not finding out the truth. Could you please tell me, sir, what mountain this is, what caves there are on it, what demons live in them, and which is the main route West?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Are you honest?&#8221; the old man asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I've never been false in all my life,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;You mustn't talk a whole lot of fancy nonsense like the other monk just now,&#8221; said the old man.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm not like him,&#8221; Pig replied.</P>
<P>Leaning on his stick, the old man said to Pig, &#8220;This is Lion Ridge, and it is 250 miles around. In it there is a Lion Cave where there are three demon chieftains.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're worrying over nothing, old man,&#8221; said Pig, spitting. &#8220;Why go to all that trouble just to tell us about three demons?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Aren't you afraid?&#8221; the old man said.</P>
<P>&#8220;To tell you the truth,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;my elder brother'll kill one with one swing of his cudgel, I'll kill another with one bash from my rake, and the other disciple will kill the third one with his demon-quelling staff. And with the three of them dead our master will be able to cross the ridge. No problem!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't know the whole story, monk,&#8221; said the old man with a smile. &#8220;Those three demon chiefs have the most tremendous magic powers. As for the little demons under their command, there are five thousand on the Southern end of the ridge, five thousand on the Northern end, ten thousand on the road East, ten thousand on the road West, four or five thousand patrollers, and another ten thousand on the gates. Then there are any number who work in the kitchen and gather firewood. There must be 47,000 or 48,000 altogether. They all have names and carry passes, and all they do is eat people.&#8221;</P>
<P>On learning this the idiot ran back, shivering and shaking. As soon as he was near the Tang Priest he put down his rake and started shitting instead of reporting back. &#8220;What are you squatting there for instead of making your report?&#8221; shouted Monkey when he saw the idiot.</P>
<P>&#8220;Because I'm shit scared,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;No time to talk now. The sooner we all run for our lives the better.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stupid fool,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I wasn't frightened when I questioned him, so why should you be in such a witless panic?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What is the situation?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The old man says that this is Lion Mountain,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;and that there's Lion Cave in it. There are three chief demons there, and they have 48,000 little devils under them. All they do is eat people. So if we step on their mountain we'll just be serving ourselves up as a meal to them. Let's forget about it.&#8221; On hearing this Sanzang shivered, his hairs standing on end.</P>
<P>&#8220;What are we to do, Wukong?&#8221; he asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry, Master,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;It can't be anything much. There are bound to be a few evil spirits here. It's just that the people here are such cowards that they exaggerate about how many demons there are and how powerful they are. They get themselves into a funk. I can cope.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're talking nonsense, brother,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;I'm not like you. What I found out was the truth. I wasn't making any of it up. The hills and valleys are all crawling with demons. How are we going to move ahead?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're talking like an idiot,&#8221; said Monkey with a grin. Don't scare yourself over nothing. Even if the hills and valleys were crawling with demons I'd only need half a night to wipe them all out with my cudgel.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're shameless,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;quite shameless. Stop talking so big. It would take seven or eight days just to call the roll. How could you wipe them all out?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Tell me how you'd do it,&#8221; laughed Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;However you grabbed them, tied them up, or fixed them where they are with fixing magic you'd never be able to do it so fast,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;I wouldn't need to grab them or tie them up,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'll give my cudgel a tug at both ends, say 'Grow!,' and make it over four hundred feet long. Then I'll wave it, say 'Thicken!,' and make it eighty feet around. I'll roll it down the Southern slope and that'll kill five thousand of them. I'll roll it down the Northern slope and kill another five thousand. Then I'll roll it along the ridge from East to West, and even if there are forty or fifty thousand of them I'll squash them all to a bloody pulp.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;if you kill them that way, like rolling out dough for noodles, you could do it in four hours.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Friar Sand with a laugh, &#8220;as my elder brother has such divine powers we've got nothing to fear. Please mount up so that we can be on our way.&#8221; Having heard them discussing Monkey's powers Sanzang could not but mount with an easy heart and be on his way.</P>
<P>As they traveled along the old man disappeared. &#8220;He must have been an evil spirit himself,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;deliberately coming to frighten us with cunning and intimidation.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Take it easy,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'm going to take a look.&#8221; The splendid Great Sage leapt up to a high peak but saw no trace of the old man when he looked around. Then he suddenly turned back to see a shimmering coloured glow in the sky, shot up on his cloud to look, and saw that it was the Great White Planet. Walking over and grabbing hold of him, Monkey kept addressing him by his personal name: &#8220;Li Changgeng! Li Changgeng! You rascal! If you had something to say you should have said it to my face. Why did you pretend to be an old man of the woods and make a fool of me?&#8221;</P>
<P>The planet hastened to pay him his respects and said, &#8220;Great Sage, I beg you to forgive me for being late in reporting to you. Those demon chiefs really have tremendous magical abilities and their powers are colossal. With your skill in transformations and your cunning you may just be able to get over, but if you slight them it will be very hard.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm very grateful,&#8221; Monkey thanked him, &#8220;very grateful. If I really can't get across this ridge I hope that you'll go up to Heaven and put in a word with the Jade Emperor so he'll lend me some heavenly soldiers to help me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes, yes,&#8221; said the Great White Planet. &#8220;Just give the word and you can have a hundred thousand heavenly troops if you want them.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Great Sage then took his leave of the planet and brought his cloud down to see Sanzang and say, &#8220;The old man we saw just now was actually the Great White Planet come to bring us a message.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang, putting his hands together in front of his chest, &#8220;catch up with him quick and ask him where there's another path we could make a detour by.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no other way round,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;This mountain is 250 miles across, and goodness knows how much longer it would be to go all the way around it. How ever could we?&#8221; At this Sanzang could not restrain himself from weeping.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if it's going to be as hard as this how are we going to worship the Buddha?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't cry,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;don't cry. If you cry you're a louse. I'm sure he's exaggerating. All we have to do is be careful. As they say, forewarned is forearmed. Dismount and sit here for now.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you want to talk about now?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; replied Monkey. &#8220;You stay here and look after the master carefully while Friar Sand keeps a close eye on the baggage and the horse. I'm going up the ridge to scout around. I'll find out how many demons there are in the area, capture one, ask him all the details, and get him to write out a list with all of their names. I'll check out every single one of them, old or young, and tell them to shut the gates of the cave and not block our way. Then I can ask the master to cross the mountain peacefully and quietly. That'll show people my powers.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Be careful,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;do be careful!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No need to tell me,&#8221; Brother Monkey replied with a smile. &#8220;On this trip I'd force the Eastern Ocean to make way for me, and I'd smash my way in even if it were a mountain of silver cased in iron.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage went whistling straight up to the peak by his somersault cloud. Holding on to the vines and creepers, he surveyed the mountain only to find it silent and deserted. &#8220;I was wrong,&#8221; he said involuntarily, &#8220;I was wrong. I shouldn't have let that old Great White Planet go. He was just trying to scare me. There aren't any evil spirits here. If there were they'd be out leaping around in the wind, thrusting with their spears and staves, or practicing their fighting skills. Why isn't there a single one?&#8221;</P>
<P>As he was wondering about this there was a ringing of a bell and a banging of clappers. He turned round at once to see a little devil boy with a banner on which was written BY ORDER over his shoulder, a bell at his waist and clappers in his hands that he was sounding. He was coming from the North and heading South. A close look revealed that he was about twelve feet tall.</P>
<P>&#8220;He must be a runner,&#8221; thought Monkey, grinning to himself, &#8220;delivering messages and reports. I'll take a listen to what he's talking about.&#8221; The splendid Great Sage made a spell with his hands, said the magic words, shook himself and turned into a fly who landed lightly on the devil's hat and tilted his head for a good listen.</P>
<P>This is what the little devil was saying to himself as he headed along the main road, sounding his clappers and ringing his bell: &#8220;All we mountain patrollers must be careful and be on our guard against Sun the Novice. He can even turn into a fly!&#8221; Monkey was quietly amazed to hear this. &#8220;That so-and-so must have seen me before. How else could he know my name and know that I can turn into a fly?&#8221; Now the little devil had not in fact seen him before. The demon chief had for some reason given him these instructions that he was reciting blindly. Monkey, who did not know this, thought that the devil must have seen him and was on the point of bringing the cudgel out to hit him with when he stopped.</P>
<P>&#8220;I remember Pig being told,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;when he questioned the planet that there were three demon chieftains and 47,000 or 48,000 junior devils like this one. Even if there were tens of thousands more juniors like this it would be no problem. But I wonder how great the three leaders' powers are. I'll question him first. There'll be time to deal with them later.&#8221;</P>
<P>Splendid Great Sage! Do you know how he questioned the demon? He jumped off the devil's hat and landed on a tree top, letting the junior devil go several paces ahead. Then Monkey turned round and did a quick transformation into another junior devil, sounding clappers, ringing a bell and carrying a flag over his shoulder just like the real one. He was also dressed identically. The only difference was that he was a few inches taller.</P>
<P>He was muttering the same things as the other as he caught him up, shouting, &#8220;Hey, you walking ahead, wait for me.&#8221;</P>
<P>Turning round, the junior devil asked, &#8220;Where have you come from?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're a nice bloke,&#8221; Monkey said with a smile, &#8220;not even recognizing one of your own people.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're not one of ours,&#8221; said the demon.</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;Take a look and see if you can recognize me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've never seen you before,&#8221; the demon said. &#8220;I don't know you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's not surprising you don't know me,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I work in the kitchens. We've rarely met.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't,&#8221; said the demon, shaking his head, &#8220;you don't. None of the brothers who do the cooking has got a pointy face like yours.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I must have made my face too pointy when I did the transformation,&#8221; thought Monkey, so he rubbed it with his hands and said, &#8220;It isn't pointy.&#8221; Indeed it was not.</P>
<P>&#8220;But it was pointy just now,&#8221; the little devil said. &#8220;How did you stop it being pointy just by rubbing it? You're a very shady character. I don't have the faintest idea who you are. You're not one of us. I've never met you. Very suspicious. Our kings run the household very strictly. The kitchen staff only work in the kitchen and the mountain patrols keep to patrolling the mountain. How could you possibly be a cook and a patroller?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's something you don't know,&#8221; said Monkey, improvising a clever answer. &#8220;I was promoted to patrolling because the kings saw how well I'd worked in the kitchens.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well then,&#8221; said the little devil. &#8220;We patrollers are divided into ten companies of forty each, which makes four hundred in all. We're all known by our ages, appearances, names and descriptions. Because Their Majesties want to keep the organization neat and roll-calls convenient they've given us all passes. Have you got one?&#8221; Monkey, who had seen what the devil looked like and heard what he had said, had been able to turn himself into the devil's double. But not having seen the devil's pass he was not carrying one himself. Instead of saying that he did not have one the splendid Great Sage claimed that he had.</P>
<P>&#8220;Of course I've got one,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But it's a new one that's only just been issued to me. Show me yours.&#8221;</P>
<P>Not realizing what Monkey was up to, the little devil lifted his clothes to reveal a gold-lacquered pass with a silken cord through it fastened next to his skin that he lifted out to show Monkey. Monkey saw that on the back of it were the words &#8220;Demon-suppresser,&#8221; while on the front was handwritten &#8220;Junior Wind-piercer.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Goes without saying,&#8221; Brother Monkey thought, &#8220;all the ones in mountain patrols have 'Wind' at the end of their names. Put your clothes down now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and come over here while I show you my pass.&#8221; With that he turned away, put a hand down to pull a little hair from the tip of his tail, rubbed it between his fingers, called &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned it into another gold-lacquered pass on a green silken cord on which were handwritten the words &#8220;Senior Wind-piercer.&#8221;</P>
<P>With his liking for taking things to extremes and his gift of finding the right thing to say, Monkey remarked, &#8220;There's something you don't know. When Their Majesties promoted me to patrolling for doing so well in the kitchen they gave me a new pass as a Senior Patroller and put me in charge of you forty lads in this company.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this the demon at once gave a &#8220;na-a-aw&#8221; of respect and said, &#8220;Sir, I didn't recognize you as you've only just been appointed. Please forgive me if anything I said offended you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm not angry with you,&#8221; said Monkey, returning his courtesy. &#8220;There's just one thing. I want some money from you all to mark our first meeting: five ounces of silver each.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please be patient, sir,&#8221; the little devil replied. &#8220;When I get back to the Southern end of the ridge to meet the rest of our company we'll all give it to your together.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case I'm coming with you,&#8221; said Monkey, and he followed behind as the demon led the way.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After a mile or two a writing-brush peak was seen. Why was it called a writing-brush peak? Because on the top of the mountain there was a pinnacle about forty or fifty feet high that looked just like a writing brush standing upright on a brush stand.</P>
<P>Going up to it Monkey lifted his tail, jumped to the top of the pinnacle, sat down and called, &#8220;Come here, all of you.&#8221;</P>
<P>The young Wind-piercers all bowed low beneath him and said, &#8220;We're at your service, sir.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do you know why Their Majesties appointed me?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; they replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Their Majesties want to eat the Tang Priest,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;but they're worried about Sun the Novice's tremendous magic powers. They've heard that he can do transformations and are worried that he might turn himself into a young Wind-piercer and come along the path here to find out what's going on. That's why they're made me Senior Wind-piercer to check up on you and find out if there are any impostors among you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We're all genuine, sir,&#8221; the junior Wind-piercers all replied at once.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you're all genuine do you know what powers His Senior Majesty has?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; one of the young Wind-piercers said.</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;tell me about them at once. If what you say matches what I know, you're genuine. If it's at all wrong you're impostors, and I'll take you to Their Majesties for punishment.&#8221;</P>
<P>Seeing him sitting up on high, playing wise and cunning as he shouted at them, the young devils had nothing for it but to tell him the truth. &#8220;His Majesty has vast magical abilities and enormous powers,&#8221; one of the young devils replied. &#8220;He once devoured a hundred thousand heavenly warriors in a single mouthful.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're an impostor,&#8221; Monkey spat out when he heard this.</P>
<P>&#8220;Sir, Your Honour,&#8221; said the young devil in panic, &#8220;I'm real. How can you call me an impostor?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you're genuine why did you talk such nonsense?&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;No matter how big he is His Majesty couldn't have swallowed a hundred thousand heavenly soldiers in a single mouthful.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is something you don't know about, sir,&#8221; the young devil replied. &#8220;His Majesty can do transformations. He can make himself tall enough to hold up the sky or as small as a cabbage seed. Some years ago when the Queen Mother invited all the immortals to a peach banquet she didn't send him an invitation, so His Majesty wanted to fight Heaven. The Jade Emperor sent a hundred thousand heavenly soldiers to subdue His Majesty, gave himself a magical body and opened his mouth that was as big as a city gate. He made as if to swallow hard, which frightened the heavenly soldiers so much that they dared not give battle, and the Southern Gate of Heaven was shut. That's how he could have swallowed a hundred thousand heavenly soldiers at a single mouthful.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey grinned to himself and thought, &#8220;Frankly, I've done that too. What powers does His Second Majesty have?&#8221; he asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;His Second Majesty is thirty feet tall with brows like sleeping silkworms, phoenix eyes, a voice like a beautiful woman, tusks like carrying-poles and a nose like a dragon. If he's in a fight he only needs to wrinkle his nose for his enemy to be scared witless even if he's covered in bronze and iron.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Evil spirits who get people with their noses are easy enough to catch,&#8221; said Monkey, who then asked, &#8220;and what powers does His Third Majesty have?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He's no monster from the mortal world,&#8221; the young devil replied. &#8220;His name is Ten Thousand Miles of Cloud Roc. When he moves he rolls up the wind and shifts the waves, shaking the North as he heads for the South. He carries a treasure about with him called the Male and Female Vital Principles Jar. Anyone who's put in that jar is turned liquid in a few moments.&#8221;</P>
<P>That news gave Monkey something to worry about. &#8220;I'm not scared of the monsters,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;but I'll have to watch out for his jar.&#8221; Then he said aloud, &#8220;Your account of Their Majesties' powers isn't bad&#8212;it fits exactly with what I know. But which of them wants to eat the Tang Priest?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't you know, sir?&#8221; said the young Wind-piercer.</P>
<P>&#8220;As if I didn't know better than you!&#8221; shouted Monkey. &#8220;I was told to come and question you because they're worried that you don't know all the details.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Our Senior King and Second King have long lived in Lion Cave on Lion Mountain,&#8221; the young devil replied, &#8220;but the Third King doesn't live here. He used to live over a hundred miles to the West of here in the capital of a country called Leonia. Five hundred years ago he ate the king of the country, his civil and military officials, and everybody else in the city, young and old, male and female. So he seized their country, and now all the people there are evil monsters. I don't know which year it was in which he heard that the Tang court has sent a priest to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures. They say this priest is a good man who has cultivated his conduct for ten incarnations, and anyone who eats a piece of his flesh will live for ever and never grow old. But the Third King is worried about the priest's disciple Sun the Novice who's a real terror, so he's come to swear brotherhood with our two kings, all three are now working together to catch the Tang Priest.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Damn this thoroughly ill-behaved monster,&#8221; thought Brother Monkey with great fury. &#8220;I'm protecting the Tang Priest while he works for the true achievement. How dare they plot to eat my man?&#8221; With a snort of fury he ground his steel teeth and brandished his iron cudgel as he leapt down from the high pinnacle and smashed the poor young devil's head into a lump of meat. When he saw what he had done Monkey felt sorry.</P>
<P>&#8220;Oh dear,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;he meant well, telling me all about the house. Why did I finish him off all of a sudden like that? Oh well! Oh well! That's that.&#8221; The splendid Great Sage had been forced to do this because his master's way ahead had been blocked. He took the little devil's pass off him, tied it round his own waist, put the &#8220;By order&quot; flag over his shoulder, hung the bell from his waist and sounded the clappers with his hand. Then he made a hand-spell into the wind, said a spell, shook himself, turned into the exact likeness of the junior Wind-piercer, and went straight back the way he had come, looking for the cave to find out about the three demon chieftains. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Handsome Monkey King had a thousand transformations</P>
<P>And the true power of magic to make ten thousand changes.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey was rushing deep into the mountains along the way he had come when suddenly he heard shouts and whinnies. As he looked up he saw tens of thousands of little devils drawn up outside the entrance to the Lion Cave with their spears, sabers, swords, halberds, flags and banners. Monkey was delighted.</P>
<P>&#8220;Li Changgeng, the planet, was telling the truth,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;He wasn't lying at all.&#8221; The devils were drawn up in a systematic way, each 250 forming a company, so that from the forty standards in many colours that were dancing in the wind he could tell that there were ten thousand infantry and cavalry there.</P>
<P>&#8220;If I go into the cave disguised as a junior Wind-piercer and one of the demon chiefs questions me about my mountain patrol,&#8221; Monkey thought, &#8220;I'll have to make up answers on the spur of the moment. The moment I say anything at all wrong he'll realize who I am and I won't be able to get away. That army on the gates would stop me and I'd never get out. If I'm going to catch the demon kings I'll have to get rid of the devils on the gates first.&#8221;</P>
<P>Do you know how he was going to do that? &#8220;The old demons have never seen me,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;they've only heard of my reputation. I'll talk big and scare them with my fame and prestige. If it's true that all living beings in the middle land are destined to have the scriptures brought to them, then all I need do is talk like a hero and scare those monsters on the gate away. But if they're not destined to have the scriptures brought to them I'll never get rid of the spirits from the gates of this cave in the West even if I talk till lotus flowers appear.&#8221; Thus he thought about his plans, his mind questioning his mouth and his mouth questioning his mind, as he sounded the clappers and rang the bell.</P>
<P>Before he could rush in through the entrance to Lion Cave he was stopped by the junior devils of the forward camp, who said, &#8220;You're back, young Wind-piercer.&#8221; Monkey said nothing but kept going with his head down.</P>
<P>When he reached the second encampment more young devils grabbed hold of him and said, &#8220;You're back, young Wind-piercer.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;On your patrol this morning did you meet a Sun the Novice?&#8221; they asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I did,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;He was polishing his pole.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What's he like?&#8221; the terrified devils asked. &#8220;What sort of pole was he polishing?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He was squatting beside a stream,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;He looked like one of those gods that clear the way. If he'd stood up I'm sure he'd have been hundreds of feet tall, and the iron cudgel he was holding was a huge bar as thick as a rice-bowl. He'd put a handful of water on a rocky scar and was polishing the cudgel on it muttering, 'Pole, it's ages since I got you out to show your magic powers: This time you can kill all the demons for me, even if there are a hundred thousand of them. Then I'll kill the three demon chiefs as a sacrificial offering to you.' He's going to polish it till it shines then start by killing the ten thousand of you on the gates.&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing this the little devils were all terror-struck and their souls all scattered in panic. &#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; Monkey continued, &#8220;that Tang Priest has only got a few pounds of flesh on him. We won't get a share. So why should we have to carry the can for them? We'd do much better to scatter.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right,&#8221; the demons said. &#8220;Let's all run for our lives.&#8221; If they had been civilized soldiers they would have stayed and fought to the death, but as they were all really wolves, tigers and leopards, running beasts and flying birds, they all disappeared with a great whoosh. Indeed, it wasn't as if the Great Sage Sun had merely talked big: it was like the time when Xiang Yu's army of eight thousand soldiers disappeared, surrounded by foes who were former comrades.</P>
<P>&#8220;Splendid,&#8221; said monkey to himself with self-congratulation, &#8220;the old devils are as good as dead now. If this lot run away at the sound of me they'll never dare look me in the face. I'll use the same story when I go in there. If I said anything different and one or two of the young devils had got inside and heard me that would give the game away.&#8221; Watch him as he carefully approaches the ancient cave and boldly goes deep inside.</P>
<P>If you don't know what of good or ill was to come from the demon chieftains listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>长庚传报魔头狠</p>
<p>行者施为变化能</p>
</div>
<p>情欲原因总一般，有情有欲自如然。沙门修炼纷纷士，断欲忘情即是禅。须着意，要心坚，一尘不染月当天。行功进步休教错，行满功完大觉仙。话表三藏师徒们打开欲网，跳出情牢，放马西行。走多时，又是夏尽秋初，新凉透体，但见那：急雨收残暑，梧桐一叶惊。萤飞莎径晚，蛩语月华明。黄葵开映露，红蓼遍沙汀。蒲柳先零落，寒蝉应律鸣。三藏正然行处，忽见一座高山，峰插碧空，真个是摩星碍日。长老心中害怕，叫悟空道：“你看前面这山，十分高耸，但不知有路通行否。”行者笑道：“师父说那里话。自古道，山高自有客行路，水深自有渡船人，岂无通达之理？可放心前去。”长老闻言，喜笑花生，扬鞭策马而进，径上高岩。</p>

<p>行不数里，见一老者，鬓蓬松，白发飘搔；须稀朗，银丝摆动。项挂一串数珠子，手持拐杖现龙头。远远的立在那山坡上高呼：“西进的长老，且暂住骅骝，紧兜玉勒。这山上有一伙妖魔，吃尽了阎浮世上人，不可前进！”三藏闻言，大惊失色。一是马的足下不平，二是坐个雕鞍不稳，扑的跌下马来，挣挫不动，睡在草里哼哩。行者近前搀起道：“莫怕莫怕！有我哩！”长老道：“你听那高岩上老者，报道这山上有伙妖魔，吃尽阎浮世上人，谁敢去问他一个真实端的？”行者道：“你且坐地，等我去问他。”三藏道：“你的相貌丑陋，言语粗俗，怕冲撞了他，问不出个实信。”行者笑道：“我变个俊些儿的去问他。”三藏道：“你是变了我看。”好大圣，捻着诀，摇身一变，变做个干干净净的小和尚几，真个是目秀眉清，头圆脸正，行动有斯文之气象，开口无俗类之言辞，抖一抖锦衣直裰，拽步上前，向唐僧道：“师父，我可变得好么？”三藏见了大喜道：“变得好！”八戒道：“怎么不好！只是把我们都比下去了。老猪就滚上二三年，也变不得这等俊俏！”</p>

<p>好大圣，躲离了他们，径直近前对那老者躬身道：“老公公，贫僧问讯了。”那老儿见他生得俊雅，年少身轻，待答不答的还了他个礼，用手摸着他头儿笑嘻嘻问道：“小和尚，你是那里来的？”行者道：“我们是东土大唐来的，特上西天拜佛求经。</p>

<p>适到此间，闻得公公报道有妖怪，我师父胆小怕惧，着我来问一声：端的是甚妖精，他敢这般短路！烦公公细说与我知之，我好把他贬解起身。”那老儿笑道：“你这小和尚年幼，不知好歹，言不帮衬。那妖魔神通广大得紧，怎敢就说贬解他起身！”行者笑道：“据你之言，似有护他之意，必定与他有亲，或是紧邻契友。不然，怎么长他的威智，兴他的节概，不肯倾心吐胆说他个来历？”公公点头笑道：“这和尚倒会弄嘴！”想是跟你师父游方，到处儿学些法术，或者会驱缚魍魉，与人家镇宅降邪，你不曾撞见十分狠怪哩！”行者道：“怎的狠？”公公道：“那妖精一封书到灵出，五百阿罗都来迎接；一纸简上天宫，十一大曜个个相钦。四海龙曾与他为友，八洞仙常与他作会，十地阎君以兄弟相称，社令城隍以宾朋相爱。”大圣闻言，忍不住呵呵大笑，用手扯着老者道：“不要说！不要说！那妖精与我后生小厮为兄弟朋友，也不见十分高作。若知是我小和尚来啊，他连夜就搬起身去了！”公公道：“你这小和尚胡说！不当人子！那个神圣是你的后生小厮？”行者笑道：“实不瞒你说，我小和尚祖居傲来国花果山水帘洞，姓孙，名悟空。当年也曾做过妖精，干过大事。曾因会众魔，多饮了几杯酒睡着，梦中见二人将批勾我去到阴司。一时怒发，将金箍棒打伤鬼判，唬倒阎王，几乎掀翻了森罗殿。吓得那掌案的判官拿纸，十阎王佥名画字，教我饶他打，情愿与我做后生小厮。”那公公闻说道：“阿弥陀佛！这和尚说了这过头话，莫想再长得大了。”行者道：“官儿，似我这般大也彀了。”公公道：“你年几岁了？”行者道：“你猜猜看。”老者道：“有七八岁罢了。”行者笑道：“有一万个七八岁！我把旧嘴脸拿出来你看看，你即莫怪。”公公道：“怎么又有个嘴脸？”行者道：“我小和尚有七十二副嘴脸哩。”那公公不识窍，只管问他，他就把脸抹一抹，即现出本象，咨牙倈嘴，两股通红，腰间系一条虎皮裙，手里执一根金箍棒，立在石崖之下，就象个活雷公。那老者见了，吓得面容失色，腿脚酸麻站不稳，扑的一跌；爬起来，又一个躘蹲。大圣上前道：“老官儿，不要虚惊，我等面恶人善。莫怕！莫怕！适间蒙你好意，报有妖魔。委的有多少怪，一发累你说说，我好谢你。”那老儿战战兢兢，口不能言，又推耳聋，一句不应。</p>

<p>行者见他不言，即抽身回坡。长老道：“悟空，你来了？所问如何？”行者笑道：“不打紧！不打紧！西天有便有个把妖精儿，只是这里人胆小，把他放在心上。没事，没事！有我哩！”长老道：“你可曾问他此处是甚么山，甚么洞，有多少妖怪，那条路通得雷音？”八戒道：“师父，莫怪我说。若论赌变化，使促掐，捉弄人，我们三五个也不如师兄；若论老实，象师兄就摆一队伍，也不如我。“唐僧道：“正是！正是！你还老实。”八戒道：</p>

<p>“他不知怎么钻过头不顾尾的，问了两声，不狤不魀的就跑回来了。等老猪去问他个实信来。”唐僧道：“悟能，你仔细着。”</p>

<p>好呆子，把钉钯撒在腰里，整一整皂直裰，扭扭捏捏，奔上山坡，对老者叫道：“公公，唱喏了。”那老儿见行者回去，方拄着杖挣得起来，战战兢兢的要走，忽见八戒，愈觉惊怕道：“爷爷呀！今夜做的甚么恶梦，遇着这伙恶人！为先的那和尚丑便丑，还有三分人相；这个和尚，怎么这等个碓梃嘴，蒲扇耳朵，铁片脸，毧毛颈项，一分人气儿也没有了！”八戒笑道：“你这老公公不高兴，有些儿好褒贬人，你是怎的看我哩？丑便丑，奈看，再停一时就俊了。”那老者见他说出人话来，只得开言问他：“你是那里来的？”八戒道：“我是唐僧第二个徒弟，法名叫做悟能八戒。才自先问的，叫做悟空行者，是我师兄。师父怪他冲撞了公公，不曾问得实信，所以特着我来拜问。此处果是甚山甚洞，洞里果是甚妖精，那里是西去大路，烦公公指示指示。”老者道：“可老实么？”八戒道：“我生平不敢有一毫虚的。”</p>

<p>老者道：“你莫象才来的那个和尚走花弄水的胡缠。”八戒道：</p>

<p>“我不象他。”</p>

<p>公公拄着杖，对八戒说：“此山叫做八百里狮驼岭，中间有座狮驼洞，洞里有三个魔头。”八戒啐了一声：“你这老儿却也多心！三个妖魔，也费心劳力的来报遭信！”公公道：“你不怕么？”八戒道：“不瞒你说，这三个妖魔，我师兄一棍就打死一个，我一钯就筑死一个，我还有个师弟，他一降妖杖又打死一个。三个都打死，我师父就过去了，有何难哉！”那老者笑道：</p>

<p>“这和尚不知深浅！那三个魔头，神通广大得紧哩！他手下小妖，南岭上有五千，北岭上有五千，东路口有一万，西路口有一万；巡哨的有四五千，把门的也有一万；烧火的无数，打柴的也无数：共计算有四万七八千。这都是有名字带牌儿的，专在此吃人。”那呆子闻得此言，战兢兢跑将转来，相近唐僧，且不回话，放下钯，在那里出恭。行者见了喝道：“你不回话，却蹲在那里怎的？”八戒道：“唬出屎来了！如今也不消说，赶早儿各自顾命去罢！”行者道：“这个呆根！我问信偏不惊恐，你去问就这等慌张失智！”长老道：“端的何如？”八戒道：“这老儿说：此山叫做八百里狮驼山，中间有座狮驼洞，洞里有三个老妖，有四万八千小妖，专在那里吃人。我们若躧着他些山边儿，就是他口里食了，莫想去得！”三藏闻言，战兢兢，毛骨悚然道：“悟空，如何是好？”行者笑道：“师父放心，没大事。想是这里有便有几个妖精，只是这里人胆小，把他就说出许多人，许多大，所以自惊自怪。有我哩！”八戒道：“哥哥说的是那里话！我比你不同，我问的是实，决无虚谬之言。满出满谷都是妖魔，怎生前进？”行者笑道：“呆子嘴脸，不要虚惊！若论满山满谷之魔，只消老孙一路棒，半夜打个罄尽！”八戒道：“不羞，不羞，莫说大话！那些妖精点卯也得七八日，怎么就打得罄尽？”行者道：“你说怎样打？”八戒道：“凭你抓倒，捆倒，使定身法定倒，也没有这等快的。”行者笑道：“不用甚么抓拿捆缚。我把这棍子两头一扯叫长，就有四十丈长短；幌一幌叫粗，就有八丈围圆粗细。往山南一滚，滚杀五千；山北一滚，滚杀五千；从东往西一滚，只怕四五万砑做肉泥烂酱！”八戒道：“哥哥，若是这等赶面打，或者二更时也都了了。”沙僧在旁笑道：“师父，有大师兄恁样神通，怕他怎的！请上马走啊。”唐僧见他们讲论手段，没奈何，只得宽心上马而走。</p>

<p>正行间，不见了那报信的老者，沙僧道：“他就是妖怪，故意狐假虎威的来传报，恐唬我们哩。”行者道：“不要忙，等我去看看。”好大圣，跳上高峰，四顾无迹，急转面，见半空中有彩霞幌亮，即纵云赶上看时，乃是太白金星。走到身边，用手扯住，口口声声只叫他的小名道：“李长庚！李长庚！你好惫懒！有甚话，当面来说便好，怎么装做个山林之老魇样混我！”金星慌忙施礼道：“大圣，报信来迟，乞勿罪！乞勿罪！这魔头果是神通广大，势要峥嵘，只看你挪移变化，乖巧机谋，可便过去；如若怠慢些儿，其实难去。”行者谢道：“感激！感激！果然此处难行，望老星上界与玉帝说声，借些天兵帮助老孙帮助。”金星道：“有！有！有！你只口信带去，就是十万天兵，也是有的。”</p>

<p>大圣别了金星，按落云头，见了三藏道：“适才那个老儿，原是太白星来与我们报信的。”长老合掌道：“徒弟，快赶上他，问他那里另有个路，我们转了去罢。”行者道：“转不得，此山径过有八百里，四周围不知更有多少路哩，怎么转得？”三藏闻言，止不住眼中流泪道：“徒弟，似此艰难，怎生拜佛！”行者道：“莫哭莫哭！一哭便脓包行了！他这报信，必有几分虚话，只是要我们着意留心，诚所谓以告者，过也。你且下马来坐着。”八戒道：</p>

<p>“又有甚商议？”行者道：“没甚商议，你且在这里用心保守师父，沙僧好生看守行李马匹，等老孙先上岭打听打听，看前后共有多少妖怪，拿住一个，问他个详细，教他写个执结，开个花名，把他老老小小，一一查明，吩咐他关了洞门，不许阻路，却请师父静静悄悄的过去，方显得老孙手段！”沙僧只教：“仔细！</p>

<p>仔细！”行者笑道：“不消嘱咐，我这一去，就是东洋大海也荡开路，就是铁裹银山也撞透门！”</p>

<p>好大圣，唿哨一声，纵筋斗云，跳上高峰，扳藤负葛，平山观看，那山里静悄无人。忽失声道：“错了！错了！不该放这金星老儿去了，他原来恐唬我，这里那有个甚么妖精！他就出来跳风顽耍，必定拈枪弄棒，操演武艺，如何没有一个？”正自家揣度，只听得山背后，叮叮当当、辟辟剥剥梆铃之声。急回头看处，原来是个小妖儿，掮着一杆“令”字旗，腰间悬着铃子，手里敲着梆子，从北向南而走。仔细看他，有一丈二尺的身子。行者暗笑道：“他必是个铺兵，想是送公文下报帖的。且等我去听他一听，看他说些甚话。”好大圣，捻着诀，念个咒，摇身一变，变做个苍蝇儿，轻轻飞在他帽子上，侧耳听之。只见那小妖走上大路，敲着梆，摇着铃，口里作念道：“我等寻山的，各人是谨慎堤防孙行者：他会变苍蝇！”行者闻言，暗自惊疑道：“这厮看见我了，若未看见，怎么就知我的名字，又知我会变苍蝇！”原来那小妖也不曾见他，只是那魔头不知怎么就吩咐他这话，却是个谣言，着他这等胡念。行者不知，反疑他看见，就要取出棒来打他，却又停住，暗想道：“曾记得八戒问金星时，他说老妖三个，小妖有四万七八千名。似这小妖，再多几万，也不打紧，却不知这三个老魔有多大手段。等我问他一问，动手不迟。”好大圣！你道他怎么去问？跳下他的帽子来，钉在树头上，让那小妖先行几步，急转身腾那，也变做个小妖儿，照依他敲着梆，摇着铃，掮着旗，一般衣服，只是比他略长了三五寸，口里也那般念着，赶上前叫道：“走路的，等我一等。”那小妖回头道：“你是那里来的？”行者笑道：“好人呀！一家人也不认得！”小妖道：</p>

<p>“我家没你呀。”行者道：“怎的没我？你认认看。”小妖道：“面生，认不得！认不得！”行者道：“可知道面生，我是烧火的，你会得我少。”小妖摇头道：“没有！没有！我洞里就是烧火的那些兄弟，也没有这个嘴尖的。”行者暗想道：“这个嘴好的变尖了些了。”即低头，把手侮着嘴揉一揉道：“我的嘴不尖啊。”真个就不尖了。那小妖道：“你刚才是个尖嘴，怎么揉一揉就不尖了？疑惑人子！大不好认！不是我一家的！少会少会！可疑可疑！我那大王家法甚严，烧火的只管烧火，巡山的只管巡山，终不然教你烧火，又教你来巡山？”行者口乖，就趁过来道：“你不知道，大王见我烧得火好，就升我来巡山。”小妖道：“也罢！</p>

<p>我们这巡山的，一班有四十名，十班共四百名，各自年貌，各自名色。大王怕我们乱了班次，不好点卯，一家与我们一个牌儿为号。你可有牌儿？”行者只见他那般打扮，那般报事，遂照他的模样变了，因不曾看见他的牌儿，所以身上没有。好大圣，更不说没有，就满口应承道：“我怎么没牌？但只是刚才领的新牌。拿你的出来我看。”那小妖那里知这个机括，即揭起衣服，贴身带着个金漆牌儿，穿条绒线绳儿，扯与行者看看。行者见那牌背是个威镇诸魔的金牌，正面有三个真字，是小钻风，他却心中暗想道：“不消说了！但是巡山的，必有个风字坠脚。”便道：“你且放下衣走过，等我拿牌儿你看。”即转身，插下手，将尾巴梢儿的小毫毛拔下一根，捻他把，叫“变！”即变做个金漆牌儿，也穿上个绿绒绳儿，上书三个真字，乃总钻风，拿出来，递与他看了。小妖大惊道：“我们都叫做个小钻风，偏你又叫做个甚么总钻风！”行者干事找绝，说话合宜，就道：“你实不知，大王见我烧得火好，把我升个巡风，又与我个新牌，叫做总巡风，教我管你这一班四十名兄弟也。”那妖闻言，即忙唱喏道：</p>

<p>“长官，长官，新点出来的，实是面生，言语冲撞，莫怪！”行者还着礼笑道：“怪便不怪你，只是一件：见面钱却要哩。每人拿出五两来罢。”小妖道：“长官不要忙，待我向南岭头会了我这一班的人，一总打发罢。”行者道：“既如此，我和你同去。”那小妖真个前走，大圣随后相跟。</p>

<p>不数里，忽见一座笔峰。何以谓之笔峰？那山头上长出一条峰来，约有四五丈高，如笔插在架上一般，故以为名。行者到边前，把尾巴掬一掬，跳上去坐在峰尖儿上，叫道：“钻风！都过来！”那些小钻风在下面躬身道：“长官，伺候。”行者道：“你可知大王点我出来之故？”小妖道：“不知。”行者道：“大王要吃唐僧，只怕孙行者神通广大，说他会变化，只恐他变作小钻风，来这里躧着路径，打探消息，把我升作总钻风，来查勘你们这一班可有假的。”小钻风连声应道：“长官，我们俱是真的。”行者道：“你既是真的，大王有甚本事，你可晓得？”小钻风道：“我晓得。”行者道：“你晓得，快说来我听。如若说得合着我，便是真的；若说差了一些儿，便是假的，我定拿去见大王处治。”那小钻风见他坐在高处，弄獐弄智，呼呼喝喝的，没奈何，只得实说道：“我大王神通广大，本事高强，一口曾吞了十万天兵。”行者闻说，吐出一声道：“你是假的！”小钻风慌了道：“长官老爷，我是真的，怎么说是假的？”行者道：“你既是真的，如何胡说！大王身子能有多大，一口都吞了十万天兵？”小钻风道：“长官原来不知，我大王会变化：要大能撑天堂，要小就如菜子。因那年王母娘娘设蟠桃大会，邀请诸仙，他不曾具柬来请，我大王意欲争天，被玉皇差十万天兵来降我大王，是我大王变化法身，张开大口，似城门一般，用力吞将去，唬得众天兵不敢交锋，关了南天门，故此是一口曾吞十万兵。”行者闻言暗笑道：“若是讲手头之话，老孙也曾干过。”又应声道：“二大王有何本事？”</p>

<p>小钻风道：“二大王身高三丈，卧蚕眉，丹凤眼，美人声，匾担牙，鼻似蛟龙。若与人争斗，只消一鼻子卷去，就是铁背铜身，也就魂亡魄丧！”行者道：“鼻子卷人的妖精也好拿。”又应声道：“三大王也有几多手段？”小钻风道：“我三大王不是凡间之怪物，名号云程万里鹏，行动时，抟风运海，振北图南。随身有一件儿宝贝，唤做阴阳二气瓶。假若是把人装在瓶中，一时三刻，化为浆水。”行者听说，心中暗惊道：“妖魔倒也不怕，只是仔细防他瓶儿。”又应声道：“三个大王的本事，你倒也说得不差，与我知道的一样。但只是那个大王要吃唐僧哩？”小钻风道：“长官，你不知道？”行者喝道：“我比你不知些儿！因恐汝等不知底细，吩咐我来着实盘问你哩！”小钻风道：“我大大王与二大王久住在狮驼岭狮驼洞。三大王不在这里住，他原住处离此西下有四百里远近。那厢有座城，唤做狮驼国。他五百年前吃了这城国王及文武官僚，满城大小男女也尽被他吃了干净，因此上夺了他的江山，如今尽是些妖怪。不知那一年打听得东土唐朝差一个僧人去西天取经，说那唐僧乃十世修行的好人，有人吃他一块肉，就延寿长生不老。只因怕他一个徒弟孙行者十分利害，自家一个难为，径来此处与我这两个大王结为兄弟，合意同心，打伙儿捉那个唐僧也。”行者闻言，心中大怒道：</p>

<p>“这泼魔十分无礼！我保唐僧成正果，他怎么算计要吃我的人！”恨一声，咬响钢牙，掣出铁棒，跳下高峰，把棍子望小妖头上砑了一砑，可怜，就砑得象一个肉陀！自家见了，又不忍道：</p>

<p>“咦！他倒是个好意，把些家常话儿都与我说了，我怎么却这一下子就结果了他？也罢也罢，左右是左右！”好大圣，只为师父阻路，没奈何干出这件事来。就把他牌儿解下，带在自家腰里，将“令”字旗掮在背上，腰间挂了铃，手里敲着梆子，迎风捻个诀，口里念个咒语，摇身一变，变的就象小钻风模样，拽回步，径转旧路，找寻洞府，去打探那三个老妖魔的虚实。这正是：千般变化美猴王，万样腾那真本事。</p>

<p>闯入深山，依着旧路正走处，忽听得人喊马嘶之声，即举目观之，原来是狮驼洞口有万数小妖排列着枪刀剑戟，旗帜旌旄。这大圣心中暗喜道：“李长庚之言，真是不妄！真是不妄！”</p>

<p>原来这摆列的有些路数：二百五十名作一大队伍。他只见有四十名杂彩长旗，迎风乱舞，就知有万名人马，却又自揣自度道：</p>

<p>“老孙变作小钻风，这一进去，那老魔若问我巡山的话，我必随机答应。倘或一时言语差讹，认得我啊，怎生脱体？就要往外跑时，那伙把门的挡住，如何出得门去？要拿洞里妖王，必先除了门前众怪！”你道他怎么除得众怪？好大圣想着：“那老魔不曾与我会面，就知我老孙的名头，我且倚着我的这个名头，仗着威风，说些大话，吓他一吓看。果然中土众僧有缘有分，取得经回，这一去，只消我几句英雄之言，就吓退那门前若干之怪；</p>

<p>假若众僧无缘无分，取不得真经啊，就是纵然说得莲花现，也除不得西方洞外精。”心问口，口问心，思量此计，敲着梆，摇着铃，径直闯到狮驼洞口，早被前营上小妖挡住道：“小钻风来了？”行者不应，低着头就走。走至二层营里，又被小妖扯住道：</p>

<p>“小钻风来了？”行者道：“来了。”众妖道：“你今早巡风去，可曾撞见甚么孙行者么？”行者道：“撞见的，正在那里磨扛子哩。”</p>

<p>众妖害怕道：“他怎么个模样？磨甚么扛子？”行者道：“他蹲在那涧边，还似个开路神；若站起来，好道有十数丈长！手里拿着一条铁棒，就似碗来粗细的一根大扛子，在那石崖上抄一把水，磨一磨，口里又念着：“扛子啊！这一向不曾拿你出来显显神通，这一去就有十万妖精，也都替我打死！等我杀了那三个魔头祭你！他要磨得明了，先打死你门前一万精哩！”那些小妖闻得此言，一个个心惊胆战，魂散魄飞。行者又道：“列位，那唐僧的肉也不多几斤，也分不到我处，我们替他顶这个缸怎的！</p>

<p>不如我们各自散一散罢。”众妖都道：“说得是，我们各自顾命去来。”假若是些军民人等，服了圣化，就死也不敢走。原来此辈都是些狼虫虎豹，走兽飞禽，呜的一声都哄然而去了。这个倒不象孙大圣几句铺头话，却就如楚歌声吹散了八千兵！行者暗自喜道：“好了！老妖是死了！闻言就走，怎敢觌面相逢？这进去还似此言方好；若说差了，才这伙小妖有一两个倒走进去听见，却不走了风讯？”你看他存心来古洞，仗胆入深门。毕竟不知见那个老魔头有甚吉凶，且听下回分解。</p>
