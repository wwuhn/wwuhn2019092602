<P>Heterodoxy Confuses the True Nature</P>
<P>The Primal Deity Helps the Original Heart</P>
</div>
<P>Taking Pig into the cave the monster said, &#8220;Here's one, brother.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Let me have a look at him,&#8221; said the older demon with delight.</P>
<P>&#8220;Isn't this the one?&#8221; asked the younger demon.</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; the other replied, &#8220;you've caught the wrong one. He's useless.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; said Pig, taking his chance, &#8220;I'm just a useless monk, so let me go. I'm scarcely human.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No, don't let him go, brother,&#8221; said the younger monster. &#8220;He may be no use himself, but he's with the Tang Priest. Pig's his name. We can soak him in the drinking-water pool at the back till his bristles come out, salt him and dry him to eat with our wine some rain day.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Dammit,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;I would have to run into a devil who's a salt-pork peddler.&#8221; The junior demons carried Pig inside and threw him into the pool.</P>
<P>Sanzang meanwhile was sitting on the slope feeling uneasy. His ears were hot and his eyes twitched. &#8220;Wukong,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Pig's been a long time patrolling the mountain. Why isn't he back?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't you understand his mentality yet, Master?&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;What mentality?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;If there were monsters in the mountains he'd be completely helpless,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;He'd make a tremendous fuss and come rushing back to tell me. I don't think that there can be any monsters. I expect he found the path easy and went straight ahead.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If he has gone ahead,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;where shall we meet him? This is a vast wilderness. It won't be like finding him in a city or a market-place.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Mount your horse and stop worrying,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;That lazy idiot won't be walking fast, so you only have to make your horse get a move on. We're bound to catch him up and continue our journey together.&#8221; The Tang Priest mounted his horse as asked, and Monkey led the way into the mountains as Friar Sand carried the baggage.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Gold Horn the senior demon king to Silver Horn the junior demon king, &#8220;as you've captured Pig we can be sure that the Tang Priest is here. Make another search and don't get the wrong one this time.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Right away,&#8221; said Silver Horn, who immediately mustered fifty junior demons and set out on patrol.</P>
<P>As they went along they saw an auspicious cloud drifting and circling around. &#8220;The Tang Priest is here,&#8221; said the junior demon king.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where?&#8221; the other demons asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;An auspicious cloud always shines above a good man's head and an evil effluence rises over a bad man,&#8221; said Silver Horn. &#8220;The Tang Priest is an incarnation of the Venerable Golden Cicada. He's a holy man who has cultivated his conduct for ten lives. That's why he has that auspicious cloud.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the others still could not see it the junior demon king pointed again and said, &#8220;There it is.&#8221; Sanzang shuddered thrice in the saddle, once each time the demon pointed.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why did I shudder, disciples?&#8221; he asked uneasily.</P>
<P>&#8220;Probably it's indigestion,&#8221; said Friar Sand.</P>
<P>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;it must be because these steep mountains make the master feel nervous. Don't be frightened. You'll feel better when I've cleared the path with my cudgel.&#8221; Monkey then ran through all the routines in the military manuals as he swung his cudgel up and down and all around in front of his master's horse. The Tang Priest watched as he displayed divine powers unmatched on earth.</P>
<P>At the sight of Monkey hacking his way forward the demon almost died of terror; his souls went flying as he watched from the mountain top. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he found himself saying, &#8220;now I know that all I've been hearing about Sun the Novice for years is absolutely true.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; said the junior demons, coming up to him, &#8220;you're boosting your enemy and making yourself small. Why? Who is it who's so terrific?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;With Monkey's magic powers we'll never be able to eat the Tang Priest,&#8221; said Silver Horn.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you're not up to it,&#8221; said the junior demons, &#8220;we'll send some of us to ask the senior king to send all the troops in our cave into battle. If we all work together they can't possibly get away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've never seen that iron cudgel,&#8221; said the junior king. &#8220;He's more than a match for a whole army, so with only four or five hundred of us we wouldn't have a hope against that cudgel of his.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said the other demons, &#8220;we'll never be able to eat the Tang Priest. There was no point in capturing Pig. Let's free him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We were right to capture him and shouldn't let him go,&#8221; said the junior king. &#8220;We may not be able to eat the Tang Priest yet but sooner or later we will.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How many years will that take?&#8221; the others asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;It won't be a matter of years,&#8221; replied the junior king. &#8220;In my opinion we must catch him by cunning, not by being vicious. Try to grab him by force and we won't get so much as a smell of him. But if we make friends with him by kindness we'll be able to get him by trickery.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please find a place for us in your plan, Your Majesty,&#8221; said the little demons.</P>
<P>&#8220;Go back to the camp,&#8221; the junior demon king told them, &#8220;but don't let on to His Senior Majesty. If he gets alarmed and gives the game away our plan will be ruined. I can catch the Tang Priest through magical transformations.&#8221; As the other demons went away he leapt down the mountainside to the path, shook himself and changed into a aged Taoist. This is what he looked like:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A gleaming star-hat,</P>
<P>Unkempt white hair.</P>
<P>An embroidered belt round a cloak of feathers,</P>
<P>Cloud sandals tied with yellow coir.</P>
<P>Clear of spirit and bright-eyed as an immortal,</P>
<P>Strong and light like one who will live for ever.</P>
<P>He could be compared to the Taoist Riding a Buffalo,</P>
<P>But is more like the Master of the White Scroll.</P>
<P>This false image could be a real one;</P>
<P>His deception appears to be the truth.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>There he was, beside the path, pretending to be a Taoist who had broken his leg. His feet were covered in blood. &#8220;Help help,&#8221; he shouted.</P>
<P>Just as Sanzang was happily walking along, supported by the Great Sage Monkey and Friar Sand, he heard a shout of &#8220;Help me, Father.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Well I never,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;Who could that be shouting in these wild and uninhabited mountains? It must be someone who's been frightened by tigers, leopards or wolves.&#8221; Reining in his horse he called, &#8220;Who's that in trouble? Come out.&#8221; The demon crawled out from the undergrowth and kowtowed noisily for all he was worth before the Tang Priest, who was most upset to see that he was a Taoist and of such advanced years at that. He dismounted rapidly and helped the old man to his feet, begging him to rise.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's agony,&#8221; said the demon, &#8220;agony.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the Tang Priest released his hold and looked down he saw that blood was pouring from the old man's foot. &#8220;Where have you come from, sir,&#8221; asked a shocked Sanzang. &#8220;and how did you injure your foot?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;West of this mountain, Father,&#8221; lied the demon, &#8220;there is a pure and quiet Taoist temple. I am a priest there.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What were you doing, wandering around here instead of looking after the incense and reciting the scriptures and the law in your temple?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The other day a benefactor of ours from South of the mountain invited all us priests to perform a service for his natal star and spread blessings for him. I was about halfway there with my disciple&#8212;we were late&#8212;when a ferocious and strongly patterned tiger carried my disciple off. As I staggered along shaking with terror and not knowing where to go I lost my balance on a scree and injured my foot. I can't find my way back. Thank heavens I have met you today, Father. I beg you in your great mercy to save me. If we find our way back to the temple, I'd even sell myself into slavery to repay your kindness.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; replied Sanzang, completely taken in, &#8220;you and I share a common destiny. I an a Buddhist priest and you are a Taoist. Although we wear different robes, we cultivate our conduct according to the same principles. Were I to fail to save you I would not be a true monk. But help you though I would, you can't walk.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I can't even stand, let alone walk,&#8221; replied the demon.</P>
<P>&#8220;Never mind, never mind,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;I can walk, so you can ride my horse for a while and give it back when we reach your temple.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You are very generous and I am most grateful,&#8221; said the demon, &#8220;but I have hurt my thigh and couldn't ride.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Indeed,&#8221; said Sanzang, who then instructed Friar Sand to put the luggage on the horse and carry the Taoist over his shoulders. Friar Sand assented.</P>
<P>The monster turned round at once and looked closely at Friar Sand. &#8220;Father,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I got such a scare from that tiger, but this terrible-looking monk frightens me even more. I'd be too afraid to let him carry me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong, you carry him,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;Certainly, certainly,&#8221; replied Monkey. The demon recognized him and docilely allowed himself to be carried by him, saying no more.</P>
<P>&#8220;That old Taoist doesn't know what he's doing,&#8221; chuckled Friar Sand. &#8220;Fancy refusing to let me carry you and wanting Monkey to instead. If it wasn't for our master he'd smash you against a sharp boulder and break all your sinews.&#8221;</P>
<P>As Monkey carried the demon on his shoulders he muttered to himself with some amusement, &#8220;Wretched demon, how dare you try to provoke me? Do you think I'm a mere child? Your devilish nonsense may be good enough to hoodwink the Tang Priest but it won't fool me. I can see that you are a local mountain demon. I reckon you want to eat my master. He's no ordinary person&#8212;he's not for you to eat. Besides, if you want to eat him you'll have to give a good half to me.&#8221;</P>
<P>Hearing Monkey's mutterings the monster replied, &#8220;Father, I'm a Taoist monk from a decent family who was unlucky enough to meet that tiger today. I'm no evil spirit.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you were afraid of the tiger why didn't you recite the Great Bear Scripture?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>Sanzang, hearing Monkey's grumbling just as he was mounting the horse, chastised him: &#8220;Insolent ape. 'Better to save a human life than to build a seven-storied pagoda.' If you're carrying him, just get on with it. Stop talking about 'Great Bear Scriptures' or 'Little Bear Scriptures.'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're in luck, damn you,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Merciful and pious my master may be, but he's a bit rough under his kindly manner. He'll be angry if I don't carry you with me. I'll do it if I must, but there's something I want to tell you first: warn me if you want a piss or a shit. If you do it down my back the stench will be more than I can stand. Besides, there's nobody to wash my clothes if they get dirty.&#8221;</P>
<P>To which the demon replied, &#8220;Of course. I'm old enough to understand that.&#8221; At last Monkey hauled the demon up on his back and hastened Westwards with the Tang Priest and Friar Sand. When the going became very uneven in the mountains Monkey walked slowly and carefully, letting the Tang Priest get ahead.</P>
<P>Before they had gone a couple of miles the Master and Friar Sand dropped out of Monkey's sight into a hollow on the mountainside. &#8220;The Master doesn't have any sense of how things should be done despite his great age,&#8221; he grumbled to himself. &#8220;On this long journey I'd feel overloaded even if I were empty-handed. I wish I'd smashed this evil monster. I would have to carry him. Even he's not a monster but a good man he ought to die at his age. Why should I carry him? I'll fling him down and kill him.&#8221;</P>
<P>The demon realized that the Great Sage was deciding to kill him so he used his power to shift mountains and made mountain-moving sea-overturning magic on Monkey's back. He recited the words of the spell, bringing Mount Sumeru flying through the air to come crashing down on Monkey's head. The Great Sage twisted his head to one side in a flash, and the mountain landed on his left shoulder.</P>
<P>&#8220;Tell me, son,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;what magic have you used to make yourself so heavy? You're crushing me. I don't mind the weight, but 'a badly-balanced carrying-pole is much harder to manage than a well-balanced one.'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;A mountain's not enough to crush him,&#8221; thought the demon, and he recited another spell to bring Mount Emei hurtling down through the air on Monkey's head. Monkey turned aside again, so that the mountain landed on his right shoulder. Just watch him as, with the two mountains on his shoulders, he hurries like a shooting star after his master. The monster broke into a cold sweat all over when he saw that Monkey could carry mountains. Then he pulled himself together recited another spell, and brought Mount Tai down from the sky on Monkey's head. By now the Great Sage was so weak with exhaustion that this mountain landing on his head pinned him down: his three corpse-spirits exploded, and blood spurted from his seven orifices.</P>
<P>When he had crushed Monkey with his magical powers the splendid evil spirit mounted a fast wind and caught up with Sanzang. The monster reached down from his cloud and made a grab for the Tang Priest as he rode his horse. Friar Sand threw down the luggage in horror and rushed forward wielding his demon-subduing staff to stop him. The evil demon raised his Seven-star Sword to face Friar Sand. It was a fierce battle:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A sword of seven stars,</P>
<P>A demon-quelling staff,</P>
<P>Flash and gleam with golden light.</P>
<P>The one has glaring eyes, a black demon of death;</P>
<P>The iron-faced other is indeed a General of the Curtain.</P>
<P>Before the mountain the demon displays his powers,</P>
<P>Determined to capture Tang Sanzang.</P>
<P>His foe fights hard to save the worthy priest,</P>
<P>Ready to die before he lets him go.</P>
<P>Both belch fogs that Bide the heavenly palace,</P>
<P>And kick up clouds of dust to blot out stars.</P>
<P>The red sun pales before their battle,</P>
<P>Heaven and earth are thrown into confusion.</P>
<P>But after nine clashes yielding no result</P>
<P>Friar Sand, alas, is suddenly defeated.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The ferocious demon wielded his sword like a shooting star as he fought till Friar Sand was exhausted. Friar Sand turned to flee, but the monster parried his staff and brought a great hand wheeling round to grab him. Tucking the friar under his left arm, the demon pulled Sanzang from his horse with his right hand, hooked their luggage with his toes, opened his mouth to get his teeth into the horse's mane, and used his magic to levitate them and carry them in a puff of wind back to the Lotus Flower Cave.</P>
<P>&#8220;Elder brother,&#8221; he yelled, &#8220;I've got all the monks.&#8221;</P>
<P>The older monster was delighted. &#8220;Bring them here; I want to see them,&#8221; he said.</P>
<P>&#8220;These are the ones, aren't they?&#8221; said the younger.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; sighed the older monster, &#8220;you've got the wrong ones again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But you told me to get the Tang Priest,&#8221; said the younger. &#8220;This is the Tang Priest all right,&#8221; said the older monster, &#8220;but you still haven't caught that very powerful Sun the Novice. We can't eat the Tang Priest before we get him. Until we've got him we must on no account touch any of his people. That Monkey King has enormous magical powers and can turn himself into all sorts of things. There's no way he'll let us eat his master. If he comes to our door looking for a fight you can forget all about a quiet life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Elder brother,&#8221; said the younger monster with a laugh, &#8220;you're overrating him. From the way you're going on about how marvellous he is anyone would think that there were none like him on earth and few enough in the heavens. As I see it he's nothing special: he hasn't any powers.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Did you catch him?&#8221; the elder demon asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;He can't move an inch,&#8221; the other replied. &#8220;He's crushed under three mountains I dropped on him. It was only when I'd done that to him I collected the Tang Priest, Friar Sand, the horse and the baggage and brought them all here.&#8221;</P>
<P>The news filled the old monster's heart with pleasure. &#8220;What luck! What luck! Now you've dealt with that wretched Sun the Tang Priest is as good as food in our mouths.&#8221; Saying this the older monster ordered the young devils, &#8220;Bring wine at once, and give the Junior King a drink to celebrate his success.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No, I won't have a drink,&#8221; said the younger demon. &#8220;Tell the little devils to pull Pig out of the water and hang him up.&#8221; Pig was then hung up in the Eastern wing of the cave, Friar Sand in the West, and Tang Priest in the middle. The white horse was sent off to the stables, and the luggage was stored away.</P>
<P>&#8220;You have great powers, my brother,&#8221; said the older monster with a laugh. &#8220;You've caught the three monks twice. But even though you've crushed him under a mountain you'll need some magic to get that Sun into our cooking pot. That'll be the day.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please sit down, elder brother,&#8221; said the younger monster. &#8220;I can get Monkey without lifting a finger. I just need to send two little devils with a couple of treasures to bring him back in.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What treasures?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My gold and red gourd and your vase of mutton-fat jade.&#8221; The older monster fetched the two treasures, handed them to him, and asked which two little devils were to be sent. &#8220;Send Dexterous Ghost and Skillful Beast,&#8221; replied the younger monster. He then instructed them, &#8220;Take the two treasures straight to the top of a high mountain, put them there upside-down and call out to Sun. If he responds he'll go straight inside. You must immediately paste this label on: 'Supreme Lord Lao: to be dealt with urgently in accordance with the Statutes and Ordinances.' Within three and a half hours he'll just be pus.&#8221; The two little devils kowtowed and went off with treasures to catch Monkey.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As he lay crushed under the three mountains the Great Sage thought in his distress of the holy priest Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; he wailed, &#8220;I remember how you removed the paper sealing me under the Double Boundary Mountain, delivered me from terrible agony, and brought me into the Buddhist faith. The Bodhisattva ordered me to stay with you and improve myself, sharing you fate, your appearance, and your knowledge. I never thought I'd have this demon trouble here and be crushed by mountains again. Oh dear, oh dear. If you die it serves you right. But I do feel sorry about Friar Sand, Pig, and the little dragon who was turned into a horse. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A tall tree invites the wind;</P>
<P>The wind then shakes the tree.</P>
<P>Whoever strives for fame</P>
<P>By fame destroyed is he.&#8221;</P>
<P>Then he sighed and the tears flowed like rain.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>All this had alarmed the mountain spirits, the local gods and the Protectors of the four quarters and the center. &#8220;Whose mountains are these?&#8221; asked the Gold-headed Protector.</P>
<P>&#8220;Ours,&#8221; said the local gods.</P>
<P>&#8220;And who is it pinned under your mountains?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We don't know,&#8221; said the local gods.</P>
<P>&#8220;You lot wouldn't,&#8221; said the Protector.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's Sun Wukong, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven who made havoc in the palaces of Heaven five hundred years ago. Now he's found religion and become the Tang Priest's disciple. Why ever did you let that demon use your mountains to crush him? You've had it now. He'll not spare you if ever he gets free. Even if he decides to let you off lightly it'll be exile for the local gods and hard labor for the mountain spirits. And I'll get a severe reprimand.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We didn't know, really we didn't,&#8221; said the gods and spirits, now terrified. &#8220;When the chief demon recited the mountain-moving spell we just moved them here. We never knew it was the Great Sage Sun.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be afraid,&#8221; said the Protector. &#8220;The Legal Code says that you cannot be punished for what you are unaware of. We'll have to work out a plan to let him out in such a way that he won't kill us all.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It would be very unfair of him to kill us if we set him free,&#8221; said the local gods.</P>
<P>&#8220;There's something else you don't know,&#8221; said the Protector. &#8220;He has a truly lethal As-You-Will gold-banded cudgel. If he hits you with that you've dead, and just a touch of it will wound. A tap will shatter your sinews, and a graze from it rip your skin to shreds.&#8221;</P>
<P>The terrified local gods and mountain spirits then conferred with the Protectors, approached the gates of the three mountains, and called, &#8220;Great Sage, the mountain spirits, local gods and Protectors from the four quarters and the center have come to see you.&#8221;</P>
<P>Splendid Monkey. He was like a tiger who though skinny was as always full of spirit. &#8220;So what?&#8221; he called in a loud, clear voice.</P>
<P>&#8220;We have a communication for the Great Sage,&#8221; replied the local gods. &#8220;If we remove the mountains and set you free, Great Sage, will you forgive us humble spirits for our discourtesy?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Move these mountains,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;and I won't hit you.&#8221; Then he shouted, &#8220;Get up.&#8221; It was just like the authorities giving an order: the deities all said the magic words and the mountains went back to where they had come from. Monkey was free. He jumped up, shook the dirt off his body, tightened his kilt, pulled out his cudgel from behind his ear, and said to the local gods and mountain spirits, &#8220;All hold out your feet. I'm going to give you two strokes each to work off my bad temper.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But you promised just a moment ago, Great Sage,&#8221; said the deities in horror, &#8220;to forgive us. How can you go back on your word and hit us?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My dear local gods and mountain spirits,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you're more afraid of that monster than of me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But that demon has great and powerful magic arts! When he says his true spells he forces us to take it in turns to be on duty in his cave every day.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey was shocked to hear them talk about being on duty. He looked up to the skies and shouted, &#8220;Heaven, Heaven, when the primal chaos was first differentiated and heaven divided from earth I was born on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. I visited many a wise teacher and learned the secrets of eternal life. I could change as swiftly as the winds, subdued tigers and dragons, and made great havoc in the palaces of Heaven. But never did I bully mountain spirits and local gods or make them run my errands. What a disgrace, when these evil monsters have the effrontery to treat mountain spirits and local gods as their slaves, and make them take turns to serve them. Heaven! If you created me, why ever did you create them?&#8221;</P>
<P>Just as the Great Sage was in the middle of his complaint a rosy light began to shine in the mountain hollow. &#8220;Mountain spirits, local gods,&#8221; asked Monkey, &#8220;you serve in the cave, so what is it that's shining?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The monsters' treasures,&#8221; replied the local gods, &#8220;some of the demons must have brought them to catch you out with.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Just what I need to play a little trick on them,&#8221; said Monkey: &#8220;Tell me, who comes to see them in the cave?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What they're interested in is refining elixirs of immortality, and their best friends are Taoist masters of the Quanzhen School,&#8221; replied the local gods.</P>
<P>&#8220;No wonder he turned himself into an old Taoist priest to trick my master,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Very well then, I'll let you off for now. Back you go. I'll get them myself.&#8221; The spirits all rose into the air and made off.</P>
<P>The Great Sage shook himself and turned himself into an old Taoist master. Do you know what he made himself like?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>His hair drawn into two tufts,</P>
<P>A motley robe of a hundred patches.</P>
<P>He tapped a fisherman's drum,</P>
<P>A Lord Lu sash around his waist.</P>
<P>He leaned beside the path,</P>
<P>Awaiting the little devils.</P>
<P>Soon the devils arrived</P>
<P>To be prey for the Monkey King's tricks.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>It was not long before the two little devils arrived. Monkey thrust his gold-banded cudgel out and tripped up the two demons, who were taken right off guard. It was only as they picked themselves up that they saw Monkey. &#8220;You villain. If our Great King weren't such an admirer of the likes of you we'd soon sort you out.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean, sort me out?&#8221; asked Monkey with a forced smile. &#8220;We're all Taoists&#8212;one big happy family.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why are you lying here, and why did you trip us up?&#8221; asked the devils.</P>
<P>&#8220;A little fall is a way for you boys to show your respect on meeting a Taoist elder like me,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Our Great King only demands a few ounces of silver when people first meet him,&#8221; said the little devils, &#8220;so why do you expect us to fall over for you? That's not the custom here. You must be from somewhere else.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Indeed I am,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I'm from Mount Penglai.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But that's an island in the sea where immortals live,&#8221; said the devils.</P>
<P>&#8220;If I'm not an immortal,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;I don't know who is.&#8221; By now the devils' anger had given way to delight.</P>
<P>&#8220;Venerable immortal,&#8221; they said, &#8220;venerable immortal, please don't take offence at our rudeness. It was only because our common mortal eyes failed to recognize you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I don't hold it against you,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;As the saying goes, 'An immortal body does not tread the common ground.' You couldn't be expected to know. I've come to your mountain today to bring over a virtuous man who has become an immortal and completed the Way. Anyone want to come with me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll go with you, Master,&#8221; said Dexterous Ghost.</P>
<P>&#8220;Me too,&#8221; said Skilful Beast.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where have you two gentlemen come from?&#8221; asked Monkey, as if he did not know already.</P>
<P>&#8220;From the Lotus Flower Cave,&#8221; they said. &#8220;Where are you going?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We are under orders from our Great King to capture Sun the Novice,&#8221; the devils replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Who?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Sun the Novice,&#8221; they repeated.</P>
<P>&#8220;The Sun the Novice who's going with the Tang Priest to fetch the scriptures?&#8221; asked Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, that one,&#8221; the devils replied. &#8220;Do you know him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That ape's outrageous,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I know him, and I'm very angry with him too. Let me come along with you and help you catch him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Thank you, Master,&#8221; they replied, &#8220;but we won't be needing your help. Our Junior King used his magic arts to bring three mountains here to crush him. Now he can't move an inch. We two have been sent here with treasures to pack him into.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What treasures?&#8221; asked Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;I've got the red gourd,&#8221; said Dexterous Ghost, &#8220;and he's got the jade vase.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How are you going to fit him into them?&#8221; asked Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;We'll set them upside down,&#8221; said the little devils, &#8220;and call to him. If he responds we'll put him inside and stick on a label saying: 'Supreme Lord Lao: to be dealt with urgently in accordance with the Statutes and Ordinances.' Three and a half hours later he'll be just so much pus.&#8221; This news shocked Monkey, who remarked to himself what a deadly plot this was.</P>
<P>&#8220;The Duty God of the Day told me that there were five treasures altogether,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;These are two of them. I wonder what the other three are.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; he said aloud, &#8220;would you let me have a look at your treasures?&#8221; Not realizing that this was a trick the two little devils produced them from their sleeves and offered them respectfully with both hands to Money. He was delighted, though he did now show it. &#8220;Splendid things,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;splendid. I just have to flick my tail in the air and go whizzing off with a jump. They've given them to me.&#8221; Then he had second thoughts: &#8220;No, that's no good. Stealing them would be easy enough, but it would destroy my reputation. It'd be daylight robbery.&#8221; So he handed them back with the words, &#8220;But you haven't seen my treasure yet.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; the devils asked. &#8220;Would you let us common mortals see it? It'd bring us luck.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Monkey put his hand down, pulled a hair from his tail, made a spell, and called &#8220;Change!&#8221; It turned into a big gold and red gourd one foot seven inches long that he produced from his waist. &#8220;Would you like to see my gourd?&#8221; he asked.</P>
<P>Skillful Beast took it, looked at it, and said, &#8220;It's a very big gourd, Master, shapely, and very fine to look at, but it's useless.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean, useless?&#8221; asked Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Each of our treasures can contain a thousand people,&#8221; the devils replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;What's so special about being able to contain people?&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Mine can hold the sky itself.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The sky?&#8221; asked the devils.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, it really can,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;You must be lying,&#8221; said the little devils. &#8220;We could only believe that if we saw you do it. There's no way we're going to believe you otherwise.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If the sky annoys me,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;I pack it in here seven or eight times a month; but if it doesn't annoy me I might leave it alone for half a year.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Let's see if he'll swap his sky-holding treasure with us,&#8221; said Skilful Beast to the other demon.</P>
<P>&#8220;But he'd never swap his sky-holder for our one that can only hold people,&#8221; replied Dexterous Ghost. &#8220;If he won't swap we can throw our vase in too,&#8221; said Skilful Beast.</P>
<P>Concealing his delight, Monkey thought, &#8220;A gourd for a gourd and the vase too is two for one: I'll certainly agree to that.&#8221; So he went up to Skilful Beast, clutched him, and asked, &#8220;Will you swap them if it can hold the sky?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, we'll swap them as long as it can hold the sky,&#8221; said the devil, &#8220;and I'll be your son if we don't.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well then,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;I'll put the sky in it to show you.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage bowed his head to make the spell and say the words of it. He called on the Patroller of the Day, the Patroller of the Night together with the Protector of the Four Quarters and the Centre: &#8220;Report on my behalf to the Jade Emperor that I have now found the true faith and am escorting the Tang Priest to the Western Heaven to fetch the Scriptures. We are now hold up on a high mountain and my master is in dire distress. I want to trick the devils into swapping their treasures with me, so I most humbly beg that I be lent the sky to put away for an hour. This will enable me to succeed. If there's so much as a hint of a refusal then I'll be coming up to the Hall of Miraculous Mist to give battle.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Patroller of the Day went straight in through the Southern Gate of Heaven to the Hall of Miraculous Mist, where he reported everything to the Jade Emperor.</P>
<P>&#8220;Outrageous ape,&#8221; said the Jade Emperor. &#8220;This is insolence. Previously it was Bodhisattva Guanyin who persuaded us to release him to escort the Tang Priest. We sent the Protectors of the Four Quarters and the Centre and the Four Duty Gods to take it in turns to protect him. Now he wants to put the sky away. It can't be done.&#8221;</P>
<P>As soon as he had said that the sky could not be put away Prince Nezha stepped forward from the officials at court and submitted a memorial: &#8220;Your Majesty, it is possible to contain the sky.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How?&#8221; the Jade Emperor asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;When the primal chaos was first differentiated,&#8221; Prince Nezha replied, &#8220;the light and pure became the sky, and the heavy and dirty became the earth. The sky is a ball of pure vapor that holds up the palaces of Heaven, and by rights it should be impossible to contain it. But now that Sun the Novice is escorting the Tang Priest to fetch the Scriptures from the Western Heaven this will be a source of blessings as great as Mount Tai, a good deed as profound as the ocean. Today we ought to help him succeed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How would you help him?&#8221; the Jade Emperor asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I beg for the issue of an Imperial Edict to the Northern Gate of Heaven asking the True Martial God to lend us his Black Vulture Banner to spread outside the Southern Gate and block out the sun, moon and starts. Down there they will be unable to see each other and not even able to tell back from white. That will fool the devils into thinking that the sky has been packed into the gourd, and enable Sun the Novice to succeed.&#8221; The Jade Emperor ordered that this suggestion be implemented. Bearing the imperial command Prince Nezha went to see the True Martial God at the Northern Gate of Heaven and tell him what had happened. The True Martial God handed the prince the banner.</P>
<P>By now a patroller had hurried down to whisper in the Great Sage's ear, &#8220;Prince Nezha is coming to help you.&#8221; Monkey looked up to see swirling clouds of good omen, a sure sign of the presence of a god, then turned to the little devils and said, &#8220;We'll put the sky away then.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Put it away if you like,&#8221; said the little devils, &#8220;but why all this playing for time?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I was just saying the spell and calling up the magic powers,&#8221; said Monkey. The little devils gazed wide-eyed, wondering how he was going to put the sky away. Monkey threw his imitation gourd up into the air. It was only a hair really, so you can imagine how light it was. As the winds round the mountain peak caught it, it floated in the air for an hour before landing. Meanwhile Prince Nezha was noisily spreading the Black Vulture Banner out at the Southern Gate of Heaven, obscuring the sun, the moon and the stars. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Heaven and earth were dyed as black as ink;</P>
<P>The cosmos into darkness then did sink.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The two little devils were terrified. &#8220;When we were talking a moment ago,&#8221; they said, &#8220;it was midday. How could it be dusk now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When the sky is put away,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;distinctions of time disappear. Of course it's murky.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But why's it so dark now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The sun and the moon and the stars have all been put inside, so there's no light outside. It's bound to be dark.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said the little devils, &#8220;where is your voice coming from?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm just in front of you, aren't I?&#8221; said Monkey. The little devils stretched their hands out and felt him.</P>
<P>&#8220;We can hear you but we still can't see you. Where are we, Master?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't fidget,&#8221; said Monkey, hoodwinking them, &#8220;you're on the coast of the Bohai Sea. One slip and you'd fall for seven or eight days before hitting the bottom.&#8221;</P>
<P>The little devils were panic-struck. &#8220;Enough, enough. Let the sky out again. Now we know how it's put away. If you go on a moment too long and we fall into the sea we'll never get home.&#8221;</P>
<P>Splendid Monkey. As they were both convinced he said another spell that had an impact on Prince Nezha, who rolled the banner up again, revealing the noonday sun once more. &#8220;Fantastic,&#8221; exclaimed the little devils in delight, &#8220;fantastic. If we don't do a swap for this treasure we won't be looking after our family's interest.&#8221;</P>
<P>Dexterous Ghost handed over the gourd and Skilful Beast produced the vase. When they gave them both to Monkey he gave them his imitation gourd. The exchange had now been made, but Monkey wanted it to be final, so he plucked a hair from under his navel, blew a magic breath on it, and turned it into a copper coin. &#8220;Boys,&#8221; he said, &#8220;take this coin and buy a sheet of paper.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why?&#8221; they asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;We'll write a legal contract for the exchange of your two man-holding treasures for my sky-holder,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;We each need a written agreement to prevent later regrets with the passage of time.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But there's no brush or ink here to write a contract with,&#8221; said the two little devils. &#8220;Let's swear an oath instead.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What sort of oath?&#8221; asked Monkey. &#8221;</P>
<P>We exchange our two man-holding treasures for your sky-holder,&#8221; said the devils, &#8220;and if we ever have any regrets may we be struck with pestilence in all four seasons.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I certainly won't have any regrets,&#8221; chuckled Monkey. &#8220;If I do, may I too be struck with pestilence in all four seasons.&#8221; Having sworn his oath he leapt up, his tail in the air, and landed in front of the Southern Gate of Heaven, where he thanked Prince Nezha for helping him with the banner. The prince reported back to the palace and returned the banner to the True Martial God, leaving Monkey standing amid the stars and clouds, gazing at the little devils.</P>
<P>If you don't know how things turned out, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>	</div>

<p>外道迷真性</p>
<p>元神助本心</p>
</div>
<p>却说那怪将八戒拿进洞去道：“哥哥啊，拿将一个来了。”</p>

<p>老魔喜道：“拿来我看。”二魔道：“这不是？”老魔道：“兄弟，错拿了，这个和尚没用。”八戒就绰经说道：“大王，没用的和尚，放他出去罢，不当人子！”二魔道：“哥哥，不要放他，虽然没用，也是唐僧一起的，叫做猪八戒。把他且浸在后边净水池中，浸退了毛衣，使盐腌着，晒干了，等天阴下酒。”八戒听言道：“蹭蹬啊！撞着个贩腌腊的妖怪了！”那小妖把八戒抬进去，抛在水里不题。</p>

<p>却说三藏坐在坡前，耳热眼跳，身体不安，叫声：“悟空！怎么悟能这番巡山，去之久而不来？”行者道：“师父还不晓得他的心哩。”三藏道：“他有甚心？”行者道：“师父啊，此山若是有怪，他半步难行，一定虚张声势，跑将回来报我；想是无怪，路途平静，他一直去了。”三藏道：“假若真个去了，却在那里相会？此间乃是山野空阔之处，比不得那店市城井之间。”行者道：“师父莫虑，且请上马。那呆子有些懒惰，断然走的迟慢。你把马打动些儿，我们定赶上他，一同去罢。”真个唐僧上马，沙僧挑担，行者前面引路上山。</p>

<p>却说那老怪又唤二魔道：“兄弟，你既拿了八戒，断乎就有唐僧。再去巡巡山来，切莫放过他去。”二魔道：“就行，就行。”</p>

<p>你看他急点起五十名小妖，上山巡逻。正走处，只见祥云缥缈，瑞气盘旋，二魔道：“唐僧来了。”众妖道：“唐僧在那里？”二魔道：“好人头上祥云照顶，恶人头上黑气冲天。那唐僧原是金蝉长老临凡，十世修行的好人，所以有这样云缥缈。”众怪都不看见，二魔用手指道：“那不是？”那三藏就在马上打了一个寒噤，又一指，又打个寒噤。一连指了三指，他就一连打了三个寒噤，心神不宁道：“徒弟啊，我怎么打寒噤么？”沙僧道：“打寒噤想是伤食病发了。行者道：“胡说，师父是走着这深山峻岭，必然小心虚惊。莫怕！莫怕！等老孙把棒打一路与你压压惊。”好行者，理开棒，在马前丢几个解数，上三下四，左五右六，尽按那六韬三略，使起神通。那长老在马上观之，真个是寰中少有，世上全无。剖开路一直前行，险些儿不唬倒那怪物。他在山顶上看见，魂飞魄丧，忽失声道：“几年间闻说孙行者，今日才知话不虚传果是真。”众怪上前道：“大王，怎么长他人之志气，灭自己之威风？你夸谁哩？”二魔道：“孙行者神通广大，那唐僧吃他不成。”众怪道：“大王，你没手段，等我们着几个去报大大王，教他点起本洞大小兵来，摆开阵势，合力齐心，怕他走了那里去！”二魔道：“你们不曾见他那条铁棒，有万夫不当之勇，我洞中不过有四五百兵，怎禁得他那一棒？”众妖道：“这等说，唐僧吃不成，却不把猪八戒错拿了？如今送还他罢。”二魔道：“拿便也不曾错拿，送便也不好轻送。唐僧终是要吃，只是眼下还尚不能。”众妖道：“这般说，还过几年么？”二魔道：“也不消几年。我看见那唐僧，只可善图，不可恶取。若要倚势拿他，闻也不得一闻，只可以善去感他，赚得他心与我心相合，却就善中取计，可以图之。”众妖道：“大王如定计拿他，可用我等？”二魔道：“你们都各回本寨，但不许报与大王知道。若是惊动了他，必然走了风讯，败了我计策。我自有个神通变化，可以拿他。”</p>

<p>众妖散去，他独跳下山来，在那道路之旁，摇身一变，变做个年老的道者，真个是怎生打扮？但见他：星冠晃亮，鹤发蓬松。羽衣围绣带，云履缀黄棕。神清目朗如仙客，体健身轻似寿翁。说甚么清牛道士，也强如素券先生。妆成假象如真象，捏作虚情似实情。他在那大路旁妆做个跌折腿的道士，脚上血淋津，口里哼哼的，只叫“救人！救人！”</p>

<p>却说这三藏仗着孙大圣与沙僧，欢喜前来，正行处，只听得叫“师父救人！”三藏闻得道：“善哉！善哉！这旷野山中，四下里更无村舍，是甚么人叫？想必是虎豹狼虫唬倒的。”这长老兜回俊马，叫道：“那有难者是甚人？可出来。”这怪从草科里爬出，对长老马前，乒乓的只情磕头。三藏在马上见他是个道者，却又年纪高大，甚不过意，连忙下马搀道：“请起，请起。”那怪道：“疼！疼！疼！”丢了手看处，只见他脚上流血，三藏惊问道：“先生啊，你从那里来？因甚伤了尊足？”那怪巧语花言，虚情假意道：“师父啊，此山西去，有一座清幽观宇，我是那观里的道士。”三藏道：“你不在本观中侍奉香火，演习经法，为何在此闲行？”那魔道：“因前日山南里施主家，邀道众禳星，散福来晚，我师徒二人，一路而行。行至深衢，忽遇着一只斑斓猛虎，将我徒弟衔去，贫道战兢兢亡命走，一跤跌在乱石坡上，伤了腿足，不知回路。今日大有天缘，得遇师父，万望师父大发慈悲，救我一命。若得到观中，就是典身卖命，一定重谢深恩。”三藏闻言，认为真实，道：“先生啊，你我都是一命之人，我是僧，你是道，衣冠虽别，修行之理则同。我不救你啊，就不是出家之辈。救便救你，你却走不得路哩。”那怪道：“立也立不起来，怎生走路？”三藏道：“也罢，也罢。我还走得路，将马让与你骑一程，到你上宫，还我马去罢。”那怪道：“师父，感蒙厚情，只是腿胯跌伤，不能骑马。”三藏道：“正是。”叫沙和尚：“你把行李捎在我马上，你驮他一程罢。”沙僧道：“我驮他。”那怪急回头，抹了他一眼道：“师父啊，我被那猛虎唬怕了，见这晦气色脸的师父，愈加惊怕，不敢要他驮。”三藏叫道：“悟空，你驮罢。”行者连声答应道：“我驮我驮！”那妖就认定了行者，顺顺的要他驮，再不言语。沙僧笑道：“这个没眼色的老道！我驮着不好，颠倒要他驮。他若看不见师父时，三尖石上，把筋都掼断了你的哩！”行者驮了，口中笑道：“你这个泼魔，怎么敢来惹我？你也问问老孙是几年的人儿！你这般鬼话儿，只好瞒唐僧，又好来瞒我？我认得你是这山中的怪物，想是要吃我师父哩。我师父又非是等闲之辈，是你吃的！你要吃他，也须是分多一半与老孙是。”那魔闻得行者口中念诵，道：“师父，我是好人家儿孙，做了道士。</p>

<p>今日不幸，遇着虎狼之厄，我不是妖怪。”行者道：“你既怕虎狼，怎么不念《北斗经》？”三藏正然上马，闻得此言，骂道：“这个泼猴！救人一命，胜造七级浮屠。你驮他驮儿便罢了，且讲甚么北斗经南斗经！”行者闻言道：“这厮造化哩！我那师父是个慈悲好善之人，又有些外好里枒槎。我待不驮你，他就怪我。</p>

<p>驮便驮，须要与你讲开：若是大小便，先和我说。若在脊梁上淋下来，臊气不堪，且污了我的衣服，没人浆洗。”那怪道：“我这般一把子年纪，岂不知你的话说？”行者才拉将起来，背在身上，同长老、沙僧，奔大路西行。那山上高低不平之处，行者留心慢走，让唐僧前去。行不上三五里路，师父与沙僧下了山凹之中，行者却望不见，心中埋怨道：“师父偌大年纪，再不晓得事体。这等远路，就是空身子也还嫌手重，恨不得捽了，却又教我驮着这个妖怪！莫说他是妖怪，就是好人，这们年纪，也死得着了，掼杀他罢，驮他怎的？”这大圣正算计要掼，原来那怪就知道了，且会遣山，就使一个移山倒海的法术，就在行者背上捻诀，念动真言，把一座须弥山遣在空中，劈头来压行者。这大圣慌的把头偏一偏，压在左肩背上，笑道：“我的儿，你使甚么重身法来压老孙哩？这个倒也不怕，只是正担好挑，偏担儿难挨。”那魔道：“一座山压他不住！”却又念咒语，把一座峨眉山遣在空中来压。行者又把头偏一偏，压在右肩背上。看他挑着两座大山，飞星来赶师父！那魔头看见，就吓得浑身是汗，遍体生津道：“他却会担山！”又整性情，把真言念动，将一座泰山遣在空中，劈头压住行者。那大圣力软筋麻，遭逢他这泰山下顶之法，只压得三尸神咋，七窍喷红。</p>

<p>好妖魔，使神通压倒行者，却疾驾长风，去赶唐三藏，就于云端里伸下手来，马上挝人。慌得个沙僧丢了行李，掣出降妖棒，当头挡住。那妖魔举一口七星剑，对面来迎。这一场好杀：</p>

<p>七星剑，降妖杖，万映金光如闪亮。这个圜眼凶如黑杀神，那个铁脸真是卷帘将。那怪山前大显能，一心要捉唐三藏。这个努力保真僧，一心宁死不肯放。他两个喷云嗳雾照天宫，播土扬尘遮斗象。杀得那一轮红日淡无光，大地乾坤昏荡荡。来往相持八九回，不期战败沙和尚。那魔十分凶猛，使口宝剑，流星的解数滚来，把个沙僧战得软弱难搪，回头要走，早被他逼住宝杖，轮开大手，挝住沙僧，挟在左胁下，将右手去马上拿了三藏，脚尖儿钩着行李，张开口，咬着马鬃，使起摄法，把他们一阵风，都拿到莲花洞里，厉声高叫道：“哥哥！这和尚都拿来了！”老魔闻言大喜道：“拿来我看。”二魔道：“这不是？”老魔道：“贤弟呀，又错拿来了也。”二魔道：“你说拿唐僧的。”老魔道：“是便就是唐僧，只是还不曾拿住那有手段的孙行者。须是拿住他，才好吃唐僧哩。若不曾拿得他，切莫动他的人。那猴王神通广大，变化多般，我们若吃了他师父，他肯甘心？来那门前吵闹，莫想能得安生。”二魔笑道：“哥啊，你也忒会抬举人。</p>

<p>若依你夸奖他，天上少有，地下全无，自我观之，也只如此，没甚手段。”老魔道：“你拿住了？”二魔道：“他已被我遣三座大山压在山下，寸步不能举移，所以才把唐僧、沙和尚连马行李，都摄将来也。”那老魔闻言满心欢喜道：“造化！造化！拿住这厮，唐僧才是我们口里的食哩。”叫小妖：“快安排酒来，且与你二大王奉一个得功的杯儿。”二魔道：“哥哥，且不要吃酒，叫小的们把猪八戒捞上水来吊起。”遂把八戒吊在东廊，沙僧吊在西边，唐僧吊在中间，白马送在槽上，行李收将进去。老魔笑道：“贤弟好手段！两次捉了三个和尚。但孙行者虽是有山压住，也须要作个法，怎么拿他来凑蒸才好哩。”二魔道：“兄长请坐。</p>

<p>若要拿孙行者，不消我们动身，只教两个小妖，拿两件宝贝，把他装将来罢。”老魔道：“拿甚么宝贝去？”二魔道：“拿我的紫金红葫芦，你的羊脂玉净瓶。”老魔将宝贝取出道：“差那两个去？”二魔道：“差精细鬼、伶俐虫二人去。”吩咐道：“你两个拿着这宝贝，径至高山绝顶，将底儿朝天，口儿朝地，叫一声孙行者！他若应了，就已装在里面，随即贴上太上老君急急如律令奉敕的帖儿，他就一时三刻化为脓了。”二小妖叩头，将宝贝领出去拿行者不题。</p>

<p>却说那大圣被魔使法压住在山根之下，遇苦思三藏，逢灾念圣僧，厉声叫道：“师父啊！想当时你到两界山，揭了压帖，老孙脱了大难，秉教沙门，感菩萨赐与法旨，我和你同住同修，同缘同相，同见同知，乍想到了此处，遭逢魔障，又被他遣山压了。可怜！可怜！你死该当，只难为沙僧八戒与那小龙化马一场！这正是树大招风风撼树，人为名高名丧人！”叹罢，那珠泪如雨。早惊了山神土地与五方揭谛神众，会金头揭谛道：“这山是谁的？”土地道：“是我们的。”“你山下压的是谁？”土地道：“不知是谁。”揭谛道：“你等原来不知。这压的是五百年前大闹天宫的齐天大圣孙悟空行者，如今皈依正果，跟唐僧做了徒弟。你怎么把山借与妖魔压他？你们是死了。他若有一日脱身出来，他肯饶你！就是从轻，土地也问个摆站，山神也问个充军，我们也领个大不应是。”那山神、土地才怕道：“委实不知不知，只听得那魔头念起遣山咒法，我们就把山移将来了，谁晓得是孙大圣？”揭谛道：“你且休怕，律上有云，不知者不坐。我与你计较，放他出来，不要教他动手打你们。”土地道：“就没理了，既放出来又打？”揭谛道：“你不知，他有一条如意金箍棒，十分利害：打着的就死，挽着的就伤。磕一磕儿筋断，擦一擦儿皮塌哩！”那土地山神，心中恐惧，与五方揭谛商议了，却来到三山门外叫道：“大圣！山神土地五方揭谛来见。”好行者，他虎瘦雄心还在，自然的气象昂昂，声音朗朗道：“见我怎的？”土地道：“告大圣得知，遣开山，请大圣出来，赦小神不恭之罪。”行者道：“遣开山，不打你。”喝声“起去！”就如官府发放一般。那众神念动真言咒语，把山仍遣归本位，放起行者。行者跳将起来，抖抖土，束束裙，耳后掣出棒来，叫山神土地：“都伸过孤拐来，每人先打两下，与老孙散散闷！”众神大惊道：“刚才大圣已吩咐，恕我等之罪，怎么出来就变了言语要打？”行者道：“好土地！好山神！你倒不怕老孙，却怕妖怪！”土地道：“那魔神通广大，法术高强，念动真言咒语，拘唤我等在他洞里，一日一个轮流当值哩！”行者听见当值二字，却也心惊，仰面朝天，高声大叫道：“苍天！苍天！自那混沌初分，天开地辟，花果山生了我，我也曾遍访明师，传授长生秘诀。想我那随风变化，伏虎降龙，大闹天宫，名称大圣，更不曾把山神、土地欺心使唤。今日这个妖魔无状，怎敢把山神、土地唤为奴仆，替他轮流当值？天啊！</p>

<p>既生老孙，怎么又生此辈？”</p>

<p>那大圣正感叹间，又见山凹里霞光焰焰而来，行者道：“山神土地，你既在这洞中当值，那放光的是甚物件？”土地道：“那是妖魔的宝贝放光，想是有妖精拿宝贝来降你。”行者道：“这个却好耍子儿啊！我且问你，他这洞中有甚人与他相往？”土地道：“他爱的是烧丹炼药，喜的是全真道人。”行者道：“怪道他变个老道士，把我师父骗去了。既这等，你都且记打，回去罢，等老孙自家拿他。”那众神俱腾空而散。这大圣摇身一变，变做个老真人。你道他怎生打扮：头挽双髽髻，身穿百衲衣。手敲渔鼓简，腰系吕公绦。斜倚大路下，专候小魔妖。顷刻妖来到，猴王暗放刁。不多时，那两个小妖到了。行者将金箍棒伸开，那妖不曾防备，绊着脚，扑的一跌。爬起来，才看见行者，口里嚷道：“惫懒！惫懒！若不是我大王敬重你这行人，就和比较起来。”行者陪笑道：“比较甚么？道人见道人，都是一家人。”那怪道：“你怎么睡在这里，绊我一跌？”行者道：“小道童见我这老道人，要跌一跌儿做见面钱。”那妖道：“我大王见面钱只要几两银子，你怎么跌一跌儿做见面钱？你别是一乡风，决不是我这里道士。”行者道：“我当真不是，我是蓬莱山来的。”那妖道：“蓬莱山是海岛神仙境界。”行者道：“我不是神仙，谁是神仙？”</p>

<p>那妖却回嗔作喜，上前道：“老神仙，老神仙！我等肉眼凡胎，不能识认，言语冲撞，莫怪，莫怪。”行者道：“我不怪你，常言道，仙体不踏凡地，你怎知之？我今日到你山上，要度一个成仙了道的好人。那个肯跟我去？”精细鬼道：“师父，我跟你去。”伶俐虫道：“师父，我跟你去。”行者明知故问道：“你二位从那里来的？”那怪道：“自莲花洞来的。”要往那里去？”那怪道：“奉我大王教命，拿孙行者去的。”行者道：“拿那个？”那怪又道：“拿孙行者。”孙行者道：“可是跟唐僧取经的那个孙行者么？”那妖道：“正是，正是。你也认得他？”行者道：“那猴子有些无礼。我认得他，我也有些恼他，我与你同拿他去，就当与你助功。”那怪道：“师父，不须你助功，我二大王有些法术，遣了三座大山把他压在山下，寸步难移，教我两个拿宝贝来装他的。”行者道：“是甚宝贝？”精细鬼道：“我的是红葫芦，他的是玉净瓶。”</p>

<p>行者道：“怎么样装他？”小妖道：“把这宝贝的底儿朝天，口儿朝地，叫他一声，他若应了，就装在里面，贴上一张太上老君急急如律令奉敕的帖子，他就一时三刻化为脓了。”行者见说，心中暗惊道：“利害！利害！当时日值功曹报信，说有五件宝贝，这是两件了，不知那三件又是甚么东西？”行者笑道：“二位，你把宝贝借我看看。”那小妖那知甚么诀窍，就于袖中取出两件宝贝，双手递与行者。行者见了，心中暗喜道：“好东西！好东西！我若把尾子一抉，飕的跳起走了，只当是送老孙。”忽又思道：“不好！不好！抢便抢去，只是坏了老孙的名头，这叫做白日抢夺了。”复递与他去道：“你还不曾见我的宝贝哩。”那怪道：“师父有甚宝贝？也借与我凡人看看压灾。”好行者，伸下手把尾上毫毛拔了一根，捻一捻，叫“变”！即变做一个一尺七寸长的大紫金红葫芦，自腰里拿将出来道：“你看我的葫芦么？”</p>

<p>那伶俐虫接在手，看了道：“师父，你这葫芦长大，有样范，好看，却只是不中用。”行者道：“怎的不中用？”那怪道：“我这两件宝贝，每一个可装千人哩。”行者道：“你这装人的，何足稀罕？我这葫芦，连天都装在里面哩！”那怪道：“就可以装天？”行者道：“当真的装天。”那怪道：“只怕是谎。就装与我们看看才信，不然决不信你。”行者道：“天若恼着我，一月之间，常装他七八遭；不恼着我，就半年也不装他一次。”伶俐虫道：“哥啊，装天的宝贝，与他换了罢。”精细鬼道：“他装天的，怎肯与我装人的相换？伶俐虫道：“若不肯啊，贴他这个净瓶也罢。”行者心中暗喜道：“葫芦换葫芦，余外贴净瓶，一件换两件，其实甚相应！”即上前扯住那伶俐虫道：“装天可换么？”那怪道：“但装天就换，不换，我是你的儿子！”行者道：“也罢，也罢，我装与你们看看。”</p>

<p>好大圣，低头捻诀，念个咒语，叫那日游神、夜游神、五方揭谛神：“即去与我奏上玉帝，说老孙皈依正果，保唐僧去西天取经，路阻高山，师逢苦厄。妖魔那宝，吾欲诱他换之，万千拜上，将天借与老孙装闭半个时辰，以助成功。若道半声不肯，即上灵霄殿，动起刀兵！”那日游神径至南天门里灵霄殿下，启奏玉帝，备言前事，玉帝道：“这泼猴头，出言无状，前者观音来说，放了他保护唐僧，朕这里又差五方揭谛、四值功曹，轮流护持，如今又借天装，天可装乎？”才说装不得，那班中闪出哪吒三太子，奏道：“万岁，天也装得。”玉帝道：“天怎样装？”哪吒道：“自混沌初分，以轻清为天，重浊为地。天是一团清气而扶托瑶天宫阙，以理论之，其实难装；但只孙行者保唐僧西去取经，诚所谓泰山之福缘，海深之善庆，今日当助他成功。”玉帝道：“卿有何助？”哪吒道：“请降旨意，往北天门问真武借皂雕旗在南天门上一展，把那日月星辰闭了。对面不见人，捉白不见黑，哄那怪道，只说装了天，以助行者成功。”玉帝闻言：“依卿所奏。”那太子奉旨，前来北天门，见真武备言前事。那祖师随将旗付太子。</p>

<p>早有游神急降大圣耳边道：“哪吒太子来助功了。”行者仰面观之，只见祥云缭绕，果是有神，却回头对小妖道：“装天罢。”小妖道：“要装就装，只管阿绵花屎怎的？”行者道：“我方才运神念咒来。”那小妖都睁着眼，看他怎么样装天。这行者将一个假葫芦儿抛将上去。你想，这是一根毫毛变的，能有多重？</p>

<p>被那山顶上风吹去，飘飘荡荡，足有半个时辰，方才落下。只见那南天门上，哪吒太子把皂旗拨喇喇展开，把日月星辰俱遮闭了，真是乾坤墨染就，宇宙靛装成。二小妖大惊道：“才说话时，只好向午，却怎么就黄昏了？”行者道：“天既装了，不辨时候，怎不黄昏！”“如何又这等样黑？”行者道：“日月星辰都装在里面，外却无光，怎么不黑！”小妖道：“师父，你在那厢说话哩？”</p>

<p>行者道：“我在你面前不是？”小妖伸手摸着道：“只见说话，更不见面目。师父，此间是甚么去处？”行者又哄他道：“不要动脚，此间乃是渤海岸上，若塌了脚，落下去啊，七八日还不得到底哩！”小妖大惊道：“罢！罢！罢！放了天罢。我们晓得是这样装了。若弄一会子，落下海去，不得归家！”好行者，见他认了真实，又念咒语，惊动太子，把旗卷起，却早见日光正午。小妖笑道：“妙啊！妙啊！这样好宝贝，若不换啊，诚为不是养家的儿子！”那精细鬼交了葫芦，伶俐虫拿出净瓶，一齐儿递与行者，行者却将假葫芦儿递与那怪。行者既换了宝贝，却又干事找绝：脐下拔一根毫毛，吹口仙气，变作一个铜钱，叫道：“小童，你拿这个钱去买张纸来。”小妖道：“何用？”行者道：“我与你写个合同文书。你将这两件装人的宝贝换了我一件装天的宝贝，恐人心不平，向后去日久年深，有甚反悔不便，故写此各执为照。”小妖道：“此间又无笔墨，写甚文书？我与你赌个咒罢。”行者道：“怎么样赌？”小妖道：“我两件装人之宝，贴换你一件装天之宝，若有反悔，一年四季遭瘟。”行者笑道：“我是决不反悔，如有反悔，也照你四季遭瘟。”说了誓，将身一纵，把尾子翘了一翘，跳在南天门前，谢了哪吒太子麾旗相助之功。太子回宫缴旨，将旗送还真武不题。这行者伫立霄汉之间，观看那个小妖。毕竟不知怎生区处，且听下回分解。</p>
