<P>In the Land of Purpuria the Tang Priest Discusses History</P>
<P>Sun the Pilgrim in His Charity Offers to Be a Doctor</P>
</div>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When good is right all causes disappear;</P>
<P>Its fame is spread through all four continents.</P>
<P>In the light of wisdom they climb the other shore;</P>
<P>Soughing dark clouds are blown from the edge of the sky.</P>
<P>All the Buddhas give them help,</P>
<P>Sitting for ever on their thrones of jade.</P>
<P>Smash the illusions of the human world,</P>
<P>Cease!</P>
<P>Cleanse the dirt; provoke no misery.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story tells how Sanzang and his disciples cleaned the lane of its filth and pressed far ahead along the road. Time passed quickly and the weather was scorching again. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The begonias spread their globes of brocade;</P>
<P>Lotus leaves split their own green dishes.</P>
<P>Fledgling swallows hide in the roadside willows;</P>
<P>Travelers wave their silken fans for relief from the heat.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As they carried on their way a walled and moated city appeared before them. Reining in his horse, Sanzang, said, &#8220;Disciples, can you see where this is?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You can't read, Master,&#8221; Monkey exclaimed. &#8220;How ever did you get the Tang Emperor to send you on this mission?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have been a monk since I was a boy and read classics and scriptures by the thousand,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;How could you say I can't read?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;if you can, why ask where we are instead of reading the big clear writing on the apricot-yellow flag over the city wall?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wretched ape,&#8221; Sanzang shouted, &#8220;you're talking nonsense. The flag is flapping much too hard in the wind for anyone to read what, if anything, is on it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Then how could I read it?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't rise to his bait, Master,&#8221; Pig and Friar Sand said. &#8220;From this distance we can't even see the walls and moat clearly, never mind words in a banner.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But doesn't it say Purpuria?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Purpuria must be a Western kingdom,&#8221; Sanzang said. &#8220;We shall have to present our passport.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Goes without saying,&#8221; Monkey observed.</P>
<P>They were soon outside the city gates, where the master dismounted, crossed the bridge, and went in through the triple gates. It was indeed a splendid metropolis. This is what could be seen:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Lofty gate-towers,</P>
<P>Regular battlements,</P>
<P>Living waters flowing around,</P>
<P>Mountains facing to North and South.</P>
<P>Many are the goods in the streets and markets,</P>
<P>And all the citizens do thriving business.</P>
<P>This is a city fit for a monarch.</P>
<P>A capital endowed by heaven.</P>
<P>To this distant realm come travelers by land and water;</P>
<P>Jade and silk abound in this remoteness.</P>
<P>It is more beautiful than the distant ranges;</P>
<P>The palace rises to the purity of space.</P>
<P>Closely barred are the passes leading here,</P>
<P>When peace and prosperity have lasted for ever.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As master and disciples walked along the highways and through the markets they saw that the people were tall, neatly dressed and well spoken. Indeed, they were not inferior to those of the Great Tang. When the traders who stood on either side of the road saw how ugly Pig was, how tall and dark-featured Friar Sand was, and how hairy and wide-browed Monkey was they all dropped their business and came over to see them.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't provoke trouble,&#8221; Sanzang called to them. &#8220;Hold your heads down.&#8221; Pig obediently tucked his snout into his chest and Friar Sand did not dare look up. Monkey, however, stared all around him as he kept close to the Tang Priest. The more sensible people went away again after taking a look, but the idlers, the curious and the naughty children among the spectators jeered, threw bricks and tiles at the strangers, and mocked Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;Whatever you do, don't get into a row,&#8221; Sanzang said again in great anxiety. The idiot kept his head down.</P>
<P>Before long they turned a corner and saw a gate in a wall over which was written HOSTEL OF MEETING in large letters. &#8220;We are going into this government office,&#8221; Sanzang said.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The Hostel of Meeting is a place where people from all over the world are received, so we can go and disturb them,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;Let's rest there. When I have seen the king and presented our passport we can leave the city and be on our way again.&#8221; When Pig heard this he brought his snout out, so terrifying the people following behind that dozens of them collapsed.</P>
<P>&#8220;The master's right,&#8221; said Pig, stepping forward. &#8220;Let's shelter inside there and get away from these damned mockers.&#8221; They went inside, after which the people began to disperse.</P>
<P>There were two commissioners in the hostel, a senior one and his assistant, and they were in the hall checking over their personnel before going to receive an official when, to their great consternation, the Tang Priest suddenly appeared.</P>
<P>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; they asked together. &#8220;Who are you? Where are you going?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have been sent by His Majesty the Tang Emperor to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven,&#8221; the Tang Priest replied, putting his hands together in front of his chest. &#8220;Having reached your illustrious country I did not dare to try to sneak through. I would like to submit my passport for inspection so that we may be allowed to continue our way. Meanwhile we would like to rest in your splendid hostel.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the two commissioners heard this they dismissed their subordinates, put on their full official dress and went down from the main hall to greet the visitors. They instructed that the guest rooms be tidied up for them to sleep in and ordered vegetarian provisions for them. Sanzang thanked them, and the two officials led their staff out of the hall. Some of their attendants invited the visitors to sleep in the guest rooms.</P>
<P>Sanzang went with them, but Monkey complained bitterly, &#8220;Damned cheek. Why won't they let me stay in the main hall?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The people here don't come under the jurisdiction of our Great Tang and they have no connections with our country either. Besides, their superiors often come to stay. It is difficult for them to entertain us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case.&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;I insist on them entertaining us properly.&#8221;</P>
<P>As they were talking the manager brought their provisions: a dish each of white rice and wheat flour, two cabbages, four pieces of beancurd, two pieces of wheat gluten, a dish of dried bamboo shoots and a dish of &#8220;tree-ear&#8221; fungus. Sanzang told his disciples to receive the provisions and thanked the manager.</P>
<P>&#8220;There's a clean cooking-stove in the Western room,&#8221; the manager said, &#8220;and it's easy to light the firewood in it. Would you please cook your own food?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;May I ask you if the king is in the palace?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;His Majesty has not attended court for a long time,&#8221; the manager replied. &#8220;But today is an auspicious one, and he is discussing the issue of a notice with his civil and military officials. You'd better hurry if you want to get there in time to submit your passport to him. Tomorrow will be too late to do it, and goodness knows how long you'll have to wait.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;you three prepare the meal while I hurry there to have our passport inspected. After we have eaten we can be on our way.&#8221; Pig quickly unpacked the cassock and passport for Sanzang, who dressed himself and set out for the palace, instructing his disciples not to leave the hostel or make trouble.</P>
<P>Before long the Tang Priest was outside the Tower of Five Phoenixes at the outer palace gate. The towering majesty of the halls and the splendor of the tall buildings and terraces beggared description. When he reached the main Southern gate he requested the reporting officer to announce to the court his wish to have his passport inspected.</P>
<P>The eunuch officer at the gate went to the steps of the throne, where he submitted the following memorial: &#8220;There is a monk at the palace gate sent by the Great Tang in the East to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures at the Thunder Monastery in the Western Heaven. He wishes to submit his passport for approval. I await Your Majesty's command.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the king heard this he replied happily, &#8220;For a long time we have been too ill to sit on our throne. Today we are in the throne room to issue a notice sending for doctors, and now a distinguished monk has arrived in our country.&#8221; He ordered that the monk be summoned to the steps of the throne. Sanzang abased himself in reverence. The king then summoned him into the throne room, invited him to sit down, and ordered the department of foreign relations to arrange a vegetarian meal. Sanzang thanked the king for his kindness and presented his passport.</P>
<P>When he had read it through the king said with great delight, &#8220;Master of the Law, how many dynasties have ruled in your land of Great Tang? How many generations of wise ministers have there been? After what illness did the Tang emperor come back to life, so that he sent you on this long and difficult journey to fetch the scriptures?&#8221;</P>
<P>On being asked all these questions the venerable elder bowed, put his hands together and said, &#8220;In my country,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Three Emperors ruled,</P>
<P>The Five Rulers established morality.</P>
<P>Yao and Shun took the throne,</P>
<P>Yu and Tang gave the people peace.</P>
<P>Many were the offspring of Chengzhou</P>
<P>Who each established their own states,</P>
<P>Bullying the weak with their own strength,</P>
<P>Dividing the realm and proclaiming themselves rulers.</P>
<P>Eighteen such lords of local states</P>
<P>Divided the territory up to the borders.</P>
<P>Later they became a dozen,</P>
<P>Bringing peace to the cosmic order.</P>
<P>But those who had no chariots of war</P>
<P>Were swallowed up by others.</P>
<P>When the seven great states contended</P>
<P>Six of them had to surrender to Qin.</P>
<P>Heaven gave birth to Liu Bang and Xiang Yu,</P>
<P>Each of whom cherished wicked ideas.</P>
<P>The empire then belonged to Han</P>
<P>According to the stipulations agreed between the two.</P>
<P>Power passed from Han to the Sima clan,</P>
<P>Till Jin in its turn fell into chaos.</P>
<P>Twelve states ruled in North and South,</P>
<P>Among them Song, Qi, Liang and Chen.</P>
<P>Emperors ruled in succession to each other</P>
<P>Till the Great Sui restored the true unity.</P>
<P>Then it indulged in evil and wickedness.</P>
<P>Inflicting misery on the common people.</P>
<P>Our present rulers, the House of Li,</P>
<P>Have given the name of Tang to the state.</P>
<P>Since the High Ancestor passed on the throne</P>
<P>The reigning monarch has been Li Shimin.</P>
<P>The rivers have run clear and the seas been calm</P>
<P>Thanks to his great virtue and his benevolence.</P>
<P>North of the city of Chang'an</P>
<P>Lived a wicked river dragon</P>
<P>Who gave the timely rain in short measure,</P>
<P>For which he deserved to pay with his death.</P>
<P>One night he came in a dream to the emperor,</P>
<P>Asking the monarch to spare his life.</P>
<P>The emperor promised to grant a pardon</P>
<P>And sent for his wise minister early next day.</P>
<P>He kept him there inside the palace,</P>
<P>Filling his time with a long game of chess.</P>
<P>But at high noon the minister</P>
<P>Slept, and in a dream cut off the dragon's head.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On hearing this the king groaned and asked, &#8220;Master of the Law, which country did that wise minister come from?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He was our emperor's prime minister Wei Zheng, astrologer, geographer, master of the Yin and Yang, and one of the great founders and stabilizers of our state,&#8221; Sanzang explained. &#8220;Because he beheaded the Dragon King of the Jing River in his dream, the dragon brought a case in the Underworld against our emperor for having him decapitated after granting a pardon. The emperor became very ill and his condition was critical. Wei Zhang wrote him a letter to take to the Underworld and give to Cui Jue, the judge of Fengdu. Soon after that the emperor died, only to come back to life on the third day. It was thanks to Wei Zheng that Judge Cui was persuaded to alter a document and give His Majesty an extra twenty years of life. He held a great Land and Water Mass and dispatched me on this long journey to visit many lands, worship the Buddha and fetch the Three Stores of Mahayana scriptures that will raise all the sufferers from evil up to Heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this the king groaned and sighed again. &#8220;Yours is indeed a heavenly dynasty and a great nation,&#8221; he said, &#8220;with a just ruler and wise ministers. We have long been ill, but not one minister do we have who will save us.&#8221; On hearing this the venerable elder stole a glance at the king and saw that his face was sallow and emaciated; his appearance was going to pieces and his spirits were very low. The venerable elder was going to ask him some questions when an official of the department of Foreign relations came to invite the Tang Priest to eat. The king ordered that his food should be set out with Sanzang's in the Hall of Fragrance so that he could eat with the Master of the Law. Thanking the king for his kindness Sanzang took his meal with him.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Meanwhile, back in the Hostel of Meeting, Brother Monkey told Friar Sand to prepare the tea, the grain and the vegetarian dishes. &#8220;There's no problem about the tea and the rice,&#8221; Friar Sand said, &#8220;but the vegetable dishes will be difficult.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no oil, salt, soya sauce or vinegar,&#8221; Friar Sand replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;I've got a few coins here,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;so we can send Pig out to buy them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I wouldn't dare,&#8221; said the idiot, who was feeling too lazy to go. &#8220;My ugly mug could cause trouble, and then the master would blame me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you buy the stuff at a fair price and don't try to get it by asking for alms or theft there couldn't possibly by any trouble,&#8221; said Brother Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Didn't you see the commotion just now?&#8221; asked Pig. &#8220;I only showed my snout outside the gate and about a dozen of them collapsed with fright. Goodness only knows how many I'd scare to death in a busy shopping street.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;as you know so much about the busy shopping streets did you notice what was being sold in them?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;The master told me to keep my head down and cause no trouble. Honest, I didn't see anything.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I won't need to tell you about the bars, grain merchants, mills, silk shops and grocers,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;But there are marvellous teahouses and noodle shops selling big sesame buns and steamed bread. You can buy terrific soup, rice, spices and vegetables in the restaurants. Then there are all the exotic cakes, yogurts, snacks, rolls, fries, and honey sweets. Any number of goodies. Shall I go out and buy you some?&#8221;</P>
<P>This description had the idiot drooling; the saliva gurgled in his throat. &#8220;Brother,&#8221; he said, jumping to his feet, &#8220;I'll let you pay this time. Next time I'm in the money I'll treat you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Friar Sand,&#8221; said Monkey, hiding his amusement, &#8220;cook the rice while I go out to buy some other ingredients.&#8221;</P>
<P>Realizing that Monkey was only fooling the idiot, Friar Sand agreed. &#8220;Off you go,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Buy plenty and have a good feed.&#8221; Grabbing a bowl and a dish the idiot went out with Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you reverend gentlemen going?&#8221; two officials asked him.</P>
<P>&#8220;To buy some groceries,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Go West along this street, turn at the drum tower, and you'll be at Zheng's grocery,&#8221; they said. &#8220;You can buy as much oil, salt, soya sauce, vinegar, ginger, pepper and tea as you like there: they've got them all.&#8221;</P>
<P>The two of them headed West along the road hand in hand. Monkey went past several teahouses and restaurants but did not buy any of the things on sale or eat any of the food. &#8220;Brother,&#8221; called Pig, &#8220;why don't we make do with what we can buy here?&#8221; This was the last thing that Monkey, who had only been fooling him, intended to do.</P>
<P>&#8220;My dear brother,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you don't know how to get a good bargain. If we go a little further you can choose bigger ones.&#8221; As the two of them were talking a lot of people followed jostling behind them. Before long they reached the drum tower, where a huge and noisy crowd was pushing and shoving and filling the whole road.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm not going any further, brother,&#8221; said Pig when he saw this. &#8220;From the way they're shouting they sound as though they're out to catch monks. And we're suspicious-looking strangers. What'll we do if they arrest us?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop talking such nonsense,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;We monks haven't broken the law, so monk-catchers would have no reason to arrest us. Let's carry on and buy the ingredients we need at Zheng's.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;never. I'm not going to ask for trouble. If I try to squeeze through that crowd and my ears get pulled out to their full length they'll collapse with fright. Several of them might get trampled to death, and it would cost me my life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well then,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;You stand at the foot of this wall while I go and buy the things. I'll bring you back some wheaten cakes.&#8221; The idiot handed the bowl and dish to Monkey then stood with his back to the crowd and his snout against the foot of the wall. He would not have moved for anything in the world.</P>
<P>When Monkey reached the drum tower he found that the crowds really were very dense. As he squeezed his way through them he heard people saying that a royal proclamation had been posted at the tower: this was what all the people were struggling to see. Monkey pushed forward till he was close to it, then opened wide his fiery eyes with golden pupils to read it carefully. This is what was written:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We, the King of Purpuria in the Western Continent of Cattle-gift, from the beginning of our reign gave peace to the four quarters and tranquillity to the people. Recently the state's misfortunes have confined us to our bed with a chronic illness that has continued for a very long time. Recovery has proved impossible, and the many excellent prescriptions of our country's Royal College of Medicine have not yet effected a cure. We hereby issue an invitation to all experts in medicine and pharmacy among the wise men of the world, whether from the North or the East, from China or from foreign countries, to ascend to the throne hall and heal our sickness, in the event of a recovery we will give half our kingdom. This is no empty promise. All those who can offer cures should come to this notice.</P>
<P>When Monkey had read this he exclaimed with delight, &#8220;As they used to say in the old days, 'Make a move and your fortune's one third made.' I was wrong to stay put in the hostel. There's no need to buy groceries, and fetching the scriptures can wait for a day while I go and have a bit of fun as a doctor.&#8221; The splendid Great Sage bent low, got rid of the bowl and dish, took a pinch of dust, threw it into the air, said the words of a spell and made himself invisible. He then went up to the notice, quietly took it down, and blew towards the Southeast with a magic breath.</P>
<P>Immediately a whirlwind arose that scattered all the people there. Monkey then went straight back to where Pig was standing, his nose propped against the foot of the wall as if he were fast asleep. Brother Monkey folded the notice up, slipped it inside the lapel of Pig's tunic without disturbing him, turned and went back to the hostel.</P>
<P>As soon as the whirlwind started blowing all the people in the crowd at the foot of the drum tower covered their heads and shut their eyes, never imagining that when the wind fell the royal proclamation would have disappeared. They were horrorstruck. That morning twelve palace eunuchs and twelve guards officers had come out to post it, and now it had been blown away after less than six hours. In fear and trembling the people searched all around for it until a piece of paper was spotted sticking out of Pig's lapel.</P>
<P>&#8220;So you took the proclamation down, did you?&#8221; they asked, going up to him.</P>
<P>Looking up with a start the idiot thrust his nose up at them, making the guards officers stagger about and collapse with terror. He turned to flee, only to be grabbed by several bold spirits who blocked his way.</P>
<P>&#8220;You've taken down the royal proclamation inviting doctors, so you're coming to the palace to cure His Majesty,&#8221; they said. &#8220;Where else d'you think you're going?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm your son if I tore the poster down,&#8221; said Pig in panic. &#8220;I'd be your grandson if I could cure disease.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What's that sticking out of your tunic?&#8221; one of the officers asked.</P>
<P>Only then did the idiot look down and see that there really was a piece of paper there. Opening it he ground his teeth and swore, &#8220;That macaque is trying to get me killed!&#8221; He gave an angry roar and was just about to tear it up when they all stopped him.</P>
<P>&#8220;You're a dead man,&#8221; they said. &#8220;That's a proclamation His Majesty issued today. How dare you tear it up? As you've put it in your tunic you're no doubt a brilliant doctor. Come with us at once!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't understand,&#8221; shouted Pig. &#8220;It wasn't me that took it down. It was my fellow disciple Sun Wukong. He sneaked it into my tunic then abandoned me. We'll all have to go and find him to get to the bottom of this.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; they said. &#8220;We've got a bell here&#8212;we're not going off to play one that's still being cast. You can say what you like. Drag him off to see His Majesty.&#8221; Not bothering to get to the truth of the matter they pushed and pulled the idiot, who stood his ground as firmly as if he had taken root there. Over ten of them tried to move him without any success. &#8220;You've got no respect,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;If you go on pulling at me and make me lose my temper I'll go berserk, and don't blame me then.&#8221;</P>
<P>It had not taken long for this commotion to stir up the whole neighbourhood, and Pig was now surrounded. Two elderly palace eunuchs in the crowd said, &#8220;You look very odd and you sound wrong too. Where are you from, you ruffian?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We're pilgrims sent from the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;My master is the younger brother of the Tang emperor and a Master of the Law. He's just gone to the palace to hand his passport over for inspection. I came here with my brother disciple to buy some groceries, but there were so many people by the tower that I was scared to go any further. He told me to wait here. When he saw the proclamation he made a whirlwind, took it down, sneaked it into my tunic and went away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We did see a monk with a plump white face going in through the palace gates,&#8221; one of the eunuchs said. &#8220;Perhaps that was your master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where did your fellow disciple go?&#8221; the eunuch asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;There are four of us altogether,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;When the master went to present his passport the other three of us stayed with our luggage and our horse in the Hostel of Meeting. My brother's played a trick on me and gone back there ahead of me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Let go of him, officers,&#8221; the eunuch said. &#8220;We'll all go to the hostel together and find out what's really happening.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You two ladies are very sensible,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;Monk, you don't know about anything,&#8221; said the officers. &#8220;How can you address gentlemen as ladies?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're shameless,&#8221; laughed Pig. &#8220;You've made them change sex. Fancy calling these two old females gentlemen instead of women or ladies!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's enough of your insolence,&#8221; they all said. &#8220;Find your fellow disciple at once.&#8221;</P>
<P>The noisy crowd in the street, which was not to be numbered in mere hundreds, carried him to the hostel gates. &#8220;Don't come any further, gentlemen,&#8221; Pig said. &#8220;My brother won't let you make a fool of him the way I do. He's a ferocious and serious character. When you meet him you'll have to bow deeply to him and call him 'Lord Sun,' then he'll look after you. If you don't he'll turn nasty and this business will fail.&#8221;</P>
<P>To this the eunuchs and officers replied, &#8220;If your brother really has the power to cure our king he'll be given half the country and we will all bow to him.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idlers were still making a commotion outside the hostel gates as Pig led the eunuchs and officers straight inside, where Monkey could be heard laughing with pleasure as he told Friar Sand about how he had taken the proclamation down.</P>
<P>Pig went up to him, grabbed him and yelled, &#8220;Why won't you act like a man? You said you'd buy me noodles, buns, and steamed bread to lure me out, but it was only an empty promise. Then you made a whirlwind, took down the royal proclamation, and sneakily put it in my tunic. You made a real idiot of me. What kind of brother are you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Idiot,&#8221; laughed Monkey, &#8220;you must have got lost and gone the wrong way. I couldn't find you when I rushed back from buying the groceries the other side of the drum tower, so I came back ahead. Where did I tear any royal proclamations down?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The officials who were guarding it are here,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>Before he had finished speaking the eunuchs and officers came up, bowed low and said, &#8220;Lord Sun, His Majesty is very fortunate today as Heaven has sent you down to us. We are sure that you will display your great skill and give him the benefit of your outstanding medical knowledge. If you cure our king you will receive half the country and half the state.&#8221; On hearing this Monkey composed his face, took the proclamation from Pig and said, &#8220;I suppose you are the officials who were guarding the notice.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We slaves are eunuchs in the Bureau of Ritual,&#8221; said the eunuchs, kowtowing, &#8220;and these gentlemen are officers in the royal guard.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I did take the royal proclamation down,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;and I used my younger brother to bring you here. So your lord is ill. As the saying goes, 'Don't sell medicine carelessly, and don't send for any old doctor when you're ill.' Tell your king to come here and ask me himself to help him. I can get rid of his illness at a touch.&#8221; This shocked all the eunuchs.</P>
<P>&#8220;That is very big talk, so you must be a man of great breadth of spirit,&#8221; the officers said. &#8220;Half of us will remain here to press the invitation in silence while the other half go back to the palace to report.&#8221;</P>
<P>Four of the eunuchs and six of the guards officers went straight into the palace without waiting to be summoned and said at the steps of the throne room, &#8220;Congratulations, Your Majesty.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the king, who was in the middle of a cultivated conversation with Sanzang after their meal together, heard this he asked, &#8220;What on?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When we, your slaves, took out Your Majesty's proclamation sending for doctors this morning and posted it at the foot of the drum tower, a holy monk from Great Tang in the East took it down,&#8221; they replied. &#8220;He is now in the Hostel of Meeting and wants Your Majesty to go in person to ask his help. He can get rid of illness at a touch. That is why we have come to submit this report.&#8221;</P>
<P>This news delighted the king. &#8220;How many distinguished disciples do you have, Master of the Law?&#8221; he asked.</P>
<P>Putting his hands together in front of his chest Sanzang replied, &#8220;I have three stupid followers.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Which of them is a medical expert?&#8221; the king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;To be frank with Your Majesty,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;they are all country bumpkins fit only for carrying baggage, leading the horse, finding their way along streams, or leading me over mountains and rivers. In dangerous places they can defeat monsters, capture demons, and subdue tigers and dragons. None of them knows anything about medicines.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Aren't you being too hard on them?&#8221; the king asked. &#8220;It was very fortunate that you came to court when we entered the throne hall this morning: this was surely destined by Heaven. If your disciple knows nothing about medicine why would he have taken down our proclamation and demanded that we go to greet him in person? He must surely be a great physician.&#8221;</P>
<P>He then called, &#8220;Civilian and military officers, we are much too weak to ride in our carriage. You must all leave the palace and go on our behalf to invite the Venerable Sun to treat our disease. When you meet him you must on no account show him any disrespect. You must address him as 'Holy monk, Venerable Sun' and treat him with the deference due to your own sovereign.&#8221;</P>
<P>Having received these orders the officials went straight to the Hostel of Meeting with the eunuchs and guards officers responsible for the proclamation. There they arranged themselves in their companies to kowtow to Monkey. Pig was so frightened that he hid in the wing, while Friar Sand slipped behind the wall. Just look at the Great Sage sitting solemnly and unmoving in the middle of the room.</P>
<P>&#8220;That macaque is really asking to have his head cut off,&#8221; Pig thought resentfully. &#8220;All those officials bowing to him, and he's not bowing back or standing up either.&#8221;</P>
<P>Soon afterwards, when the rituals had been performed, the officials addressed Monkey as if he were their monarch: &#8220;We report to the holy monk, the Venerable Sun, that we officials of the Kingdom of Purpuria have come at the command of our king to do respectful homage to the holy monk and invite him to the palace to treat our sick king.&#8221;</P>
<P>Only then did Brother Monkey stand up and reply, &#8220;Why hasn't your king come?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;His Majesty is too weak to ride in his carriage,&#8221; the officials all replied, &#8220;which is why he ordered us to pay homage to you, holy monk, as if you were our sovereign, kowtow to you and invite you to come.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;will you gentlemen please lead the way. I'll follow you.&#8221; The officials then formed themselves into a column in accordance with their ranks and set out. Monkey tidied his clothes and got to his feet.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;whatever you do, don't drag us in.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I won't,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;provided you two accept the medicine for me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What medicine?&#8221; Friar Sand asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;You must accept all the medicine people send me,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;I'll collect it when I come back.&#8221; The two of them undertook this commission.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey was soon at the palace with the officials, who went in first to inform the king. He raised high the curtains of pearls, flashed his dragon and phoenix eyes, opened his golden mouth and spoke majestically, &#8220;Which gentleman is the holy monk, the Venerable Sun?&#8221;</P>
<P>Taking a step forward, Monkey shouted at the top of his voice, &#8220;I am.&#8221;</P>
<P>The voice was so ugly and the face so hideous that the king fell back on his dragon throne. In their alarm the female officials and the palace eunuchs helped him to the inner quarters.</P>
<P>&#8220;He's terrified His Majesty to death,&#8221; they said.</P>
<P>&#8220;Monk,&#8221; all the officials said angrily to Monkey, &#8220;how could you be so rough and crude? Why did you dare take the proclamation down?&#8221;</P>
<P>When Brother Monkey heard this he replied with a smile, &#8220;You shouldn't be angry with me. If you're going to be so rude to me your king won't get better in a thousand years.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But how long does human life last?&#8221; the officials asked. &#8220;How is it that he won't get better even in a thousand years?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He's a sick ruler now,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;When he dies he'll be a sick ghost, and whenever he's reincarnated he'll be a sick man again. That's why he won't get better even in a thousand years.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've got no sense of respect at all,&#8221; the infuriated officials replied. &#8220;How dare you talk such nonsense!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's not nonsense,&#8221; Monkey laughed. &#8220;Listen and I'll explain:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Mysterious indeed are the principles of medicine;</P>
<P>Flexibility of mind is a quality required.</P>
<P>Use eyes and ears, ask questions, take the pulses:</P>
<P>Omit but one and the examination's incomplete.</P>
<P>First look for outward signs of the patient's vital energy.</P>
<P>Dried? Smooth? Fat? Thin? Active? Does he sleep well?</P>
<P>Secondly, listen to whether the voice is clear or harsh:</P>
<P>Determine if the words he speaks are true or crazed.</P>
<P>Third, you must ask how long the disease has lasted,</P>
<P>And how the patient eats, drinks and relieves himself.</P>
<P>Fourth, feel the pulses and be clear about the veins:</P>
<P>Are they deep, shallow, external or inside?</P>
<P>Should I not look and listen, ask questions, and take the pulses,</P>
<P>Never in all his days will the king be well again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In the ranks of the civil and military officials there were some fellows of the Royal College of Medicine who when they heard these words praised Monkey publicly: &#8220;The monk is right. Even a god or an immortal would have to look, listen, ask questions and take the pulses before treating a patient successfully with his divine gifts.&#8221;</P>
<P>All the officials agreed with these remarks, then went up to the king and submitted: &#8220;The reverend gentleman wishes to look, listen, ask questions and take the pulses before he can prescribe properly.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Send him away,&#8221; the king said over and over again as he lay on his dragon bed. &#8220;We cannot bear to see any strangers.&#8221;</P>
<P>His attendants then came out from the inner quarters and announced, &#8220;Monk, His Majesty commands that you go away. He cannot bear to see a stranger.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If he won't see a stranger,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;I know the art of taking the pulses with hanging threads.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That is something of which we have only heard,&#8221; exclaimed all the officials, concealing their delight, &#8220;but that we have never seen with our own eyes. Please go back in and submit another report.&#8221;</P>
<P>The personal attendants then went back into the inner quarters and reported, &#8220;Your Majesty, the Venerable Sun can take your pulses with hanging threads: he does not need to see Your Majesty's face.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this the king reflected, &#8220;In the three years we have been ill we have never tried this technique. Send him in.&#8221;</P>
<P>At once the courtiers in attendance announced, &#8220;His Majesty has consented to pulse-taking by the hanging threads. Send the Venerable Sun to the inner quarters at once to make his diagnosis.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey then entered the throne hall, where the Tang Priest met him with abuse: &#8220;Wretched ape! You will be the death of me!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My good master,&#8221; Monkey replied with a smile, &#8220;I'm bringing you credit. How can you say I'll be the death of you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In all the years you've been with me,&#8221; Sanzang shouted, &#8220;I have never seen you cure a single person. You know nothing about the nature of drugs, and you have never studied medical books. How can you be so reckless and bring this disaster on us?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't realize, Master,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile, &#8220;that I do know the odd herbal remedy and can treat serious illnesses. I guarantee I can cure him. Even if the treatment kills him I'll only be guilty of manslaughter through medical incompetence. That's not a capital offence. What are you afraid of? There's nothing to worry about, nothing. You sit here and see what my pulse diagnosis is like.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you talk all this rubbish,&#8221; Sanzang asked, &#8220;when you have never read the<I> Plain Questions,</I> the<I> Classic of Difficulties,</I> the<I> Pharmacopoeia</I> and the<I> Mysteries of the Pulses,</I> or studied the commentaries to them? How could you possibly diagnose his pulses by hanging threads?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I've got golden threads on me that you've never seen,&#8221; Monkey replied, putting out his hand to pull three hairs from his tail, hold them in a bunch, call, &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turn them into three golden threads each twenty-four feet long to match the twenty-four periods of the solar year. Holding these in his hand he said to the Tang Priest, &#8220;These are golden threads, aren't they?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop talking, reverend gentleman,&#8221; said the eunuchs in attendance on the king. &#8220;Please come inside and make your diagnosis.&#8221; Taking his leave of the Tang Priest Monkey followed the attendants into the inner quarters to see his patient. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The heart has a secret prescription that will save a country;</P>
<P>The hidden and wonderful spell gives eternal life.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you do not know what illness was diagnosed or what medicines were used and wish to learn the truth listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>朱紫国唐僧论前世</p>
<p>孙行者施为三折肱</p>
</div>
<p>善正万缘收，名誉传扬四部洲。智慧光明登彼岸，飕飕，叆叆云生天际头。诸佛共相酬，永住瑶台万万秋。打破人间蝴蝶梦，休休，涤净尘氛不惹愁。话表三藏师徒，洗污秽之胡同，上逍遥之道路，光阴迅速，又值炎天，正是：海榴舒锦弹，荷叶绽青盘。两路绿杨藏乳燕，行人避暑扇摇绔。进前行处，忽见有一城池相近。三藏勒马叫：“徒弟们，你看那是甚么去处？”行者道：“师父原来不识字，亏你怎么领唐王旨意离朝也！”三藏道：</p>

<p>“我自幼为僧，千经万典皆通，怎么说我不识字？”行者道：“既识字，怎么那城头上杏黄旗，明书三个大字，就不认得，却问是甚去处何也？”三藏喝道：“这泼猴胡说！那旗被风吹得乱摆，纵有字也看不明白！”行者道：“老孙偏怎看见？”八戒沙僧道：“师父，莫听师兄捣鬼。这般遥望，城池尚不明白，如何就见是甚字号？”行者道：“却不是朱紫国三字？”三藏道：“朱紫国必是西邦王位，却要倒换关文。”行者道：“不消讲了。”</p>

<p>不多时，至城门下马过桥，入进三层门里，真个好个皇州！</p>

<p>但见：门楼高耸，垛迭齐排。周围活水通流，南北高山相对。六街三市货资多，万户千家生意盛。果然是个帝王都会处，天府大京城。绝域梯航至，遐方玉帛盈。形胜连山远，宫垣接汉清。</p>

<p>三关严锁钥，万古乐升平。师徒们在那大街市上行时，但见人物轩昂，衣冠齐整，言语清朗，真不亚大唐世界。那两边做买做卖的，忽见猪八戒相貌丑陋，沙和尚面黑身长，孙行者脸毛额廓，丢了买卖，都来争看。三藏只叫：“不要撞祸！低着头走！”</p>

<p>八戒遵依，把个莲蓬嘴揣在怀里，沙僧不敢仰视，惟行者东张西望紧随唐僧左右。那些人有知事的，看看儿就回去了。有那游手好闲的，并那顽童们，烘烘笑笑，都上前抛瓦丢砖，与八戒作戏。唐僧捏着一把汗，只教：“莫要生事！”那呆子不敢抬头。</p>

<p>不多时，转过隅头，忽见一座门墙，上有会同馆三字。唐僧道：“徒弟，我们进这衙门去也。”行者道：“进去怎的？”唐僧道：</p>

<p>“会同馆乃天下通会通同之所，我们也打搅得，且到里面歇下。</p>

<p>待我见驾，倒换了关文，再赶出城走路。”八戒闻言，掣出嘴来，把那些随看的人唬倒了数十个，他上前道：“师父说的是，我们且到里边藏下，免得这伙鸟人吵嚷。”遂进馆去，那些人方渐渐而退。</p>

<p>却说那馆中有两个馆使，乃是一正一副，都在厅上查点人夫，要往那里接官，忽见唐僧来到，个个心惊，齐道：“是甚么人？是甚么人？往那里走？”三藏合掌道：“贫僧乃东土大唐驾下，差往西天取经者，今到宝方，不敢私过，有关文欲倒验放行，权借高衙暂歇。”那两个馆使听言，屏退左右，一个个整冠束带，下厅迎上相见，即命打扫客房安歇，教办清素支应，三藏谢了。二官带领人夫，出厅而去。手下人请老爷客房安歇，三藏便走，行者恨道：“这厮惫懒！怎么不让老孙在正厅？”三藏道：“他这里不服我大唐管属，又不与我国相连，况不时又有上司过客往来，所以不好留此相待。”行者道：“这等说，我偏要他相待！”正说处，有管事的送支应来，乃是一盘白米、一盘白面、两把青菜、四块豆腐、两个面筋、一盘干笋、一盘木耳。三藏教徒弟收了，谢了管事的，管事的道：“西房里有干净锅灶，柴火方便，请自去做饭。”三藏道：“我问你一声，国王可在殿上么？”</p>

<p>管事的道：“我万岁爷爷久不上朝，今日乃黄道良辰，正与文武多官议出黄榜。你若要倒换关文，趁此急去还赶上。到明日，就不能彀了，不知还有多少时伺候哩。”三藏道：“悟空，你们在此安排斋饭，等我急急去验了关文回来，吃了走路。”八戒急取出袈裟关文。三藏整束了进朝，只是吩咐徒弟们，切不可出外去生事。</p>

<p>不一时，已到五凤楼前，说不尽那殿阁峥嵘，楼台壮丽。直至端门外，烦奏事官转达天廷，欲倒验关文。那黄门官果至玉阶前启奏道：“朝门外有东土大唐钦差一员僧，前往西天雷音寺拜佛求经，欲倒换通关文牒，听宣。”国王闻言喜道：“寡人久病，不曾登基，今上殿出榜招医，就有高僧来国！”即传旨宣至阶下，三藏即礼拜俯伏。国王又宣上金殿赐坐，命光禄寺办斋，三藏谢了恩，将关文献上。国王看毕，十分欢喜道：“法师，你那大唐，几朝君正？几辈臣贤？至于唐王，因甚作疾回生，着你远涉山川求经？”这长老因问，即欠身合掌道：“贫僧那里三皇治世，五帝分伦。尧舜正位，禹汤安民。成周子众，各立乾坤。倚强欺弱，分国称君。邦君十八，分野边尘。后成十二，宇宙安淳。</p>

<p>因无车马，却又相吞。七雄争胜，六国归秦。天生鲁沛，各怀不仁。江山属汉，约法钦遵。汉归司马，晋又纷纭。南北十二，宋齐梁陈。列祖相继，大隋绍真。赏花无道，涂炭多民。我王李氏，国号唐君。高祖晏驾，当今世民。河清海晏，大德宽仁。兹因长安城北，有个怪水龙神，刻减甘雨，应该损身。夜间托梦，告王救迍。王言准赦，早召贤臣。款留殿内，慢把棋轮。时当日午，那贤臣梦斩龙身。”国王闻言，忽作呻吟之声问道：“法师，那贤臣是那邦来者？”三藏道：“就是我王驾前丞相，姓魏名徵。他识天文，知地理，辨阴阳，乃安邦立国之大宰辅也。因他梦斩了泾河龙王，那龙王告到阴司，说我王许救又杀之，故我王遂得促病，渐觉身危。魏徵又写书一封，与我王带至冥司，寄与酆都城判官崔玨。少时，唐王身死，至三日复得回生。亏了魏徵，感崔判官改了文书，加王二十年寿。今要做水陆大会，故遣贫僧远涉道途，询求诸国，拜佛祖，取大乘经三藏，超度孽苦升天也。”那国王又呻吟叹道：“诚乃是天朝大国，君正臣贤！似我寡人久病多时，并无一臣拯救。”长老听说，偷睛观看，见那皇帝面黄肌瘦，形脱神衰。长老正欲启问，有光禄寺官奏请唐僧奉斋。王传旨教：“在披香殿，连朕之膳摆下，与法师同享。”</p>

<p>三藏谢了恩，与王同进膳进斋不题。</p>

<p>却说行者在会同馆中，着沙僧安排茶饭，并整治素菜。沙僧道：“茶饭易煮，蔬菜不好安排。”行者问道：“如何？”沙僧道：</p>

<p>“油盐酱醋俱无也。”行者道：“我这里有几文衬钱，教八戒上街买去。”那呆子躲懒道：“我不敢去，嘴脸欠俊，恐惹下祸来，师父怪我。”行者道：“公平交易，又不化他，又不抢他，何祸之有！”八戒道：“你才不曾看见獐智？在这门前扯出嘴来，把人唬倒了十来个；若到闹市丛中，也不知唬杀多少人是！”行者道：</p>

<p>“你只知闹市丛中，你可曾看见那市上卖的是甚么东西？”八戒道：“师父只教我低着头，莫撞祸，实是不曾看见。”行者道：“酒店、米铺、磨坊，并绫罗杂货不消说，着然又好茶房、面店，大烧饼、大馍馍，饭店又有好汤饭，好椒料、好蔬菜，与那异品的糖糕、蒸酥、点心、卷子、油食、蜜食，无数好东西，我去买些儿请你如何？”那呆子闻说，口内流涎，喉咙里啯啯的咽唾，跳起来道：“哥哥！这遭我扰你，待下次趱钱，我也请你回席。”行者暗笑道：“沙僧，好生煮饭，等我们去买调和来。”沙僧也知是耍呆子，只得顺口应承道：“你们去，须是多买些，吃饱了来。”那呆子捞个碗盏拿了，就跟行者出门。有两个在官人问道：“长老那里去？”行者道：“买调和。”那人道：“这条街往西去，转过拐角鼓楼，那郑家杂货店，凭你买多少，油盐酱醋、姜椒茶叶俱全。”</p>

<p>他二人携手相搀，径上街西而去。行者过了几处茶房，几家饭店，当买的不买，当吃的不吃。八戒叫道：“师兄，这里将就买些用罢。”那行者原是耍他，那里肯买，道：“贤弟，你好不经纪！再走走，拣大的买吃。”两个人说说话儿，又领了许多人跟随争看。不时，到了鼓楼边，只见那楼下无数人喧嚷，挤挤挨挨，填街塞路。八戒见了道：“哥哥，我不去了，那里人嚷得紧，只怕是拿和尚的。又况是面生可疑之人，拿了去，怎的了？”行者道：“胡谈！和尚又不犯法，拿我怎的？我们走过去，到郑家店买些调和来。”八戒道：“罢罢罢！我不撞祸。这一挤到人丛里，把耳朵躧了两躧，唬得他跌跌爬爬，跌死几个，我倒偿命哩！”行者道：“既然如此，你在这壁根下站定，等我过去买了回来，与你买素面烧饼吃罢。”那呆子将碗盏递与行者，把嘴拄着墙根，背着脸，死也不动。这行者走至楼边，果然挤塞，直挨入人丛里听时，原来是那皇榜张挂楼下，故多人争看。行者挤到近处，闪开火眼金睛，仔细看时，那榜上却云：“朕西牛贺洲朱紫国王，自立业以来，四方平服，百姓清安。近因国事不祥，沉疴伏枕，淹延日久难痊。本国太医院，屡选良方，未能调治。今出此榜文，普招天下贤士。不拘北往东来，中华外国，若有精医药者，请登宝殿，疗理朕躬。稍得病愈，愿将社稷平分，决不虚示。为此出给张挂，须至榜者。”览毕，满心欢喜道：“古人云，行动有三分财气。早是不在馆中呆坐。即此不必买甚调和，且把取经事宁耐一日，等老孙做个医生耍耍。”好大圣，弯倒腰丢了碗盏，拈一撮土，往上洒去，念声咒语，使个隐身法，轻轻的上前揭了榜，又朝着巽地上吸口仙气吹来，那阵旋风起处，他却回身，径到八戒站处，只见那呆子嘴拄着墙根，却是睡着了一般。行者更不惊他，将榜文折了，轻轻揣在他怀里，拽转步先往会同馆去了不题。</p>

<p>却说那楼下众人，见风起时，各各蒙头闭眼。不觉风过时，没了皇榜，众皆悚惧。那榜原有十二个太监，十二个校尉，早朝领出，才挂不上三个时辰，被风吹去，战兢兢左右追寻，忽见猪八戒怀中露出个纸边儿来，众人近前道：“你揭了榜来耶？”那呆子猛抬头，把嘴一噘，唬得那几个校尉踉踉蹡蹡跌倒在地。</p>

<p>他却转身要走，又被面前几个胆大的扯住道：“你揭了招医的皇榜，还不进朝医治我万岁去，却待何往？”那呆子慌慌张张道：“你儿子便揭了皇榜！你孙子便会医治！”校尉道：“你怀中揣的是甚？”呆子却才低头看时，真个有一张字纸，展开一看，咬着牙骂道：“那猢狲害杀我也！”恨一声便要扯破，早被众人架住道：“你是死了！此乃当今国王出的榜文，谁敢扯坏？你既揭在怀中，必有医国之手，快同我去！”八戒喝道：“汝等不知，这榜不是我揭的，是我师兄孙悟空揭的。他暗暗揣在我怀中，他却丢下我去了。若得此事明白，我与你寻他去。”众人道：“说甚么乱话，现钟不打打铸钟？你现揭了榜文，教我们寻谁！不管你！扯了去见主上！”那伙人不分清白，将呆子推推扯扯。这呆子立定脚，就如生了根一般，十来个人也弄他不动。八戒道：</p>

<p>“汝等不知高低！再扯一会，扯得我呆性子发了，你却休怪！”</p>

<p>不多时，闹动了街人，将他围绕，内有两个年老的太监道：</p>

<p>“你这相貌稀奇，声音不对，是那里来的，这般村强？”八戒道：</p>

<p>“我们是东土差往西天取经的，我师父乃唐王御弟法师，却才入朝，倒换关文去了。我与师兄来此买办调和，我见楼下人多，未曾敢去，是我师兄教我在此等候。他原来见有榜文，弄阵旋风揭了暗揣我怀内先去了。”那太监道：“我头前见个白面胖和尚，径奔朝门而去，想就是你师父？”八戒道：“正是，正是。”太监道：“你师兄往那里去了？”八戒道：“我们一行四众，师父去倒换关文，我三众并行囊马匹俱歇在会同馆。师兄弄了我，他先回馆中去了。”太监道：“校尉，不要扯他，我等同到馆中，便知端的。”八戒道：“你这两个奶奶知事。”众校尉道：“这和尚委不识货！怎么赶着公公叫起奶奶来耶？”八戒笑道：“不羞！你这反了阴阳的！他二位老妈妈儿，不叫他做婆婆奶奶，倒叫他做公公！”众人道：“莫弄嘴！快寻你师兄去。”那街上人吵吵闹闹，何止三五百，共扛到馆门首。八戒道：“列位住了，我师兄却不比我任你们作戏，他却是个猛烈认真之士。汝等见了，须要行个大礼，叫他声孙老爷，他就招架了。不然啊，他就变了嘴脸，这事却弄不成也。”众太监校尉俱道：“你师兄果有手段，医好国王，他也该有一半江山，我等合该下拜。”</p>

<p>那些闲杂人都在门外喧哗，八戒领着一行太监校尉，径入馆中，只听得行者与沙僧在客房里正说那揭榜之事耍笑哩。八戒上前扯住乱嚷道：“你可成个人！哄我去买素面、烧饼、馍馍我吃，原来都是空头！又弄旋风，揭了甚么皇榜，暗暗的揣在我怀里，拿我装胖！这可成个弟兄！”行者笑道：“你这呆子，想是错了路，走向别处去。我过鼓楼，买了调和，急回来寻你不见，我先来了，在那里揭甚皇榜？”八戒道：“现在看榜的官员在此。”说不了，只见那几个太监校尉朝上礼拜道：孙老爷，今日我王有缘，天遣老爷下降，是必大展经纶手，微施三折肱，治得我王病愈，江山有分，社稷平分也。”行者闻言，正了声色，接了八戒的榜文，对众道：“你们想是看榜的官么？”太监叩头道：</p>

<p>“奴婢乃司礼监内臣，这几个是锦衣校尉。”行者道：“这招医榜，委是我揭的，故遣我师弟引见。既然你主有病，常言道，药不跟卖，病不讨医。你去教那国王亲来请我，我有手到病除之功。”太监闻言，无不惊骇，校尉道：“口出大言，必有度量。我等着一半在此哑请，着一半入朝启奏。”当分了四个太监，六个校尉，更不待宣召，径入朝当阶奏道：“主公万千之喜！”那国王正与三藏膳毕清谈，忽闻此奏，问道：“喜自何来？”太监奏道：“奴婢等早领出招医皇榜，鼓楼下张挂，有东土大唐远来取经的一个圣僧孙长老揭了，现在会同馆内，要王亲自去请他，他有手到病除之功，故此特来启奏。”国王闻言满心欢喜，就问唐僧道：“法师有几位高徒？”三藏合掌答曰：“贫僧有三个顽徒。”国王问：“那一位高徒善医？”三藏道：“实不瞒陛下说，我那顽徒俱是山野庸才，只会挑包背马，转涧寻波，带领贫僧登山涉岭，或者到峻险之处，可以伏魔擒怪，捉虎降龙而已，更无一个能知药性者。”国王道：“法师何必太谦？朕当今日登殿，幸遇法师来朝，诚天缘也。高徒既不知医，他怎肯揭我榜文，教寡人亲迎？断然有医国之能也。”叫：“文武众卿，寡人身虚力怯，不敢乘辇；汝等可替寡人，俱到朝外，敦请孙长老看朕之病。汝等见他，切不可轻慢，称他做神僧孙长老，皆以君臣之礼相见。”那众臣领旨，与看榜的太监、校尉径至会同馆，排班参拜。唬得那八戒躲在厢房，沙僧闪于壁下。那大圣，看他坐在当中端然不动，八戒暗地里怨恶道：“这猢狲活活的折杀也！怎么这许多官员礼拜，更不还礼，也不站将起来！”不多时，礼拜毕，分班启奏道：“上告神僧孙长老，我等俱朱紫国王之臣，今奉王旨，敬以洁礼参请神僧，入朝看病。”行者方才立起身来对众道：“你王如何不来？”众臣道：“我王身虚力怯，不敢乘辇，特令臣等行代君之礼，拜请神僧也。”行者道：“既如此说，列位请前行，我当随至。”众臣各依品从，作队而走。行者整衣而起，八戒道：“哥哥，切莫攀出我们来。”行者道：“我不攀你，只要你两个与我收药。”沙僧道：“收甚么药？”行者道：“凡有人送药来与我，照数收下，待我回来取用。”二人领诺不题。</p>

<p>这行者即同多官，顷间便到。众臣先走，奏知那国王，高卷珠帘，闪龙睛凤目，开金口御言便问：“那一位是神僧孙长老？”</p>

<p>行者进前一步，厉声道：“老孙便是。”那国王听得声音凶狠，又见相貌刁钻，唬得战兢兢，跌在龙床之上。慌得那女官内宦，急扶入宫中，道：“唬杀寡人也！”众官都嗔怨行者道：“这和尚怎么这等粗鲁村疏！怎敢就擅揭榜！”行者闻言笑道：“列位错怪了我也。若象这等慢人，你国王之病，就是一千年也不得好。”</p>

<p>众臣道：“人生能有几多阳寿？就一千年也还不好？”行者道：</p>

<p>“他如今是个病君，死了是个病鬼，再转世也还是个病人，却不是一千年也还不好？”众臣怒曰：“你这和尚，甚不知礼！怎么敢这等满口胡柴！”行者笑道：“不是胡柴，你都听我道来：医门理法至微玄，大要心中有转旋。望闻问切四般事，缺一之时不备全：第一望他神气色，润枯肥瘦起和眠；第二闻声清与浊，听他真语及狂言；三问病原经几日，如何饮食怎生便；四才切脉明经络，浮沉表里是何般。我不望闻并问切，今生莫想得安然。”</p>

<p>那两班文武丛中有太医院官，一闻此言，对众称扬道：“这和尚也说得有理。就是神仙看病，也须望闻问切，谨合着神圣功巧也。”众官依此言，着近侍传奏道：“长老要用望闻问切之理，方可认病用药。”那国王睡在龙床上，声声唤道：“叫他去罢！寡人见不得生人面了！”近侍的出宫来道：“那和尚，我王旨意，教你去罢，见不得生人面哩。”行者道：“若见不得生人面啊，我会悬丝诊脉。”众官暗喜道：“悬丝诊脉，我等耳闻，不曾眼见。再奏去来。”那近侍的又入宫奏道：“主公，那孙长老不见主公之面，他会悬丝诊脉。”国王心中暗想道：“寡人病了三年，未曾试此，宣他进来。”近侍的即忙传出道：“主公已许他悬丝诊脉，快宣孙长老进宫诊视。”行者却就上了宝殿，唐僧迎着骂道：“你这泼猴，害了我也！”行者笑道：“好师父，我倒与你壮观，你返说我害你？”三藏喝道：“你跟我这几年，那曾见你医好谁来！你连药性也不知，医书也未读，怎么大胆撞这个大祸！”行者笑道：</p>

<p>“师父，你原来不晓得。我有几个草头方儿，能治大病，管情医得他好便是。就是医死了，也只问得个庸医杀人罪名，也不该死，你怕怎的！不打紧，不打紧，你且坐下看我的脉理如何。”长老又道：“你那曾见《素问》、《难经》、《本草》、《脉诀》，是甚般章句，怎生注解，就这等胡说散道，会甚么悬丝诊脉！”行者笑道：</p>

<p>“我有金线在身，你不曾见哩。”即伸手下去，尾上拔了三根毫毛，捻一把，叫声“变！”即变作三条丝线，每条各长二丈四尺，按二十四气，托于手内，对唐僧道：“这不是我的金线？”近侍宦官在旁道：“长老且休讲口，请入宫中诊视去来。”行者别了唐僧，随着近侍入宫看病。正是那：心有秘方能治国，内藏妙诀注长生。毕竟这去不知看出甚么病来，用甚么药品。欲知端的，且听下回分解。</p>
