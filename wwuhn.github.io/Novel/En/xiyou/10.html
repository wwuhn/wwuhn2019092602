	<p>多少帝王兴此处，古来天下说长安。</p>

<p>此单表陕西大国长安城，乃历代帝王建都之地。自周、秦、汉以来，三州花似锦，八水绕城流。三十六条花柳巷，七十二座管弦楼。华夷图上看，天下最为头，真是奇胜之方。今却是大唐太宗文皇帝登基，改元龙集贞观。此时已登极十三年，岁在己巳。且不说他驾前有安邦定国的英豪，与那创业争疆的杰士。</p>

<P><sup><a href="#" title="查了英文，前面内容无">①</a></sup>We shall not discuss how Chen Guangrui performed his duties or Xuanzang cultivated his conduct; instead we shall talk about two wise men who lived beside the banks of the River Jing outside the city of Chang'an. One was an old fisherman called Zhang Shao and the other was a woodcutter called Li Ding. They were both advanced scholars who had never taken the official examination, lettered men of the mountains. One day, when Li Ding had sold his load of firewood and Zhang Shao had sold his basketful of carp in Chang'an city, they went into a tavern, drank till they were half tipsy, and strolled slowly home along the banks of the Jing, each holding a bottle in his hand.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother Li,&#8221; said Zhang Shao, &#8220;it seems to me that people who struggle for fame kill themselves for it; those who compete for profit die for it; those who accept honors sleep with a tiger in their arms; and those who receive imperial favours walk around with snakes in their sleeves. Taking all in all, we are much better off living free among our clear waters and blue hills: we delight in our poverty and follow our destinies.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You are right, Brother Zhang,&#8221; said Li Ding, &#8220;but your clear waters have nothing on my blue hills.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your blue hills are not a patch on my clear waters,&#8221; retorted Zhang Shao, &#8220;and here is a lyric to the tune of<I> The Butterfly Loves the Flowers</I> to prove it:</P>

<div class="right">
<p>却说长安城外泾河岸边，有两个贤人：一个是渔翁，名唤张稍；一个是樵子，名唤李定。他两个是不登科的进士，能识字的山人。</p>
<p>一日，在长安城里，卖了肩上柴，货了篮中鲤，同入酒馆之中，吃了半酣，各携一瓶，顺泾河岸边，徐步而回。张稍道：“李兄，我想那争名的，因名丧体；夺利的，为利亡身；受爵的，抱虎而眠；承恩的，袖蛇而去。算起来，还不如我们水秀山青，逍遥自在，甘淡薄，随缘而过。”李定道：“张兄说得有理。但只是你那水秀，不如我的山青。”张稍道：你山青不如我的水秀。有一《蝶恋花》词为证，词曰：</p>

<P>Under the shining autumn moon I often fish alone;</P>
<P>I meet nobody on the solitary mountain in spring.</P>
<P>I trade my surplus fish for wine and drink it with my wife;</P>
<P>When I've wood to spare I buy a bottle and share it with my sons.</P>
<P>Singing and musing to myself I'm as wild as I care to be;</P>
<P>Long songs, long sighs, I can let myself be crazy.</P>

<P>When the sun rises I carry firewood across the road.</P>

<P>When the two of them had recited their verses and matched couplets they came to the place where their ways parted and bowed to each other to take their leave. &#8220;Brother Li,&#8221; said Zhang Shao, &#8220;look after yourself on your way home and keep a sharp look-out for tigers up in the hills. If you met with an accident then 'an old friend would be missing on the road tomorrow.'&#8220; This made Li Ding angry.</P>
<P>&#8220;You scoundrel,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I'm your friend; I'd die for you. How could you put such a curse on me? If I'm killed by a tiger, you'll be capsized by a wave.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll never be capsized!&#8221; retorted Zhang Shao.</P>
<P>&#8220;'In nature there are unexpected storms and in life unpredictable vicissitudes,'&#8220; quoted Li Ding, &#8220;so how can you be sure you'll never have an accident?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother Zhang,&#8221; replied the fisherman, &#8220;despite what you just said, it's your life that's insecure, whereas my life is certain: I'm sure that I shan't have an accident.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your life on the water is very dangerous and insecure,&#8221; said the woodcutter, &#8220;so how can you be so certain?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's something you don't know,&#8221; said Zhang Shao. &#8220;Every day I give a golden carp to a fortune-teller on the West Gate Street in Chang'an, and he passes a slip into my sleeve telling me I'll catch something every time provided I go to the right place. I went to buy a forecast from him today, and he told me that if I cast my nets to the East of the bend in the Jing River and lowered my lines on the Western bank, I would be bound to get a full load of fish and shrimps to take home. Tomorrow I shall go into town to sell them to buy wine, and we can continue our talk then, brother.&#8221; With this they parted.</p>

<p>他二人既各道词章，又相联诗句，行到那分路去处，躬身作别。张稍道：“李兄呵，途中保重！上山仔细看虎。假若有些凶险，正是明日街头少故人！”李定闻言，大怒道：“你这厮惫懒！好朋友也替得生死，你怎么咒我？我若遇虎遭害，你必遇浪翻江！”张稍道：“我永世也不得翻江。”李定道：“天有不测风云，人有暂时祸福。你怎么就保得无事？”张稍道：“李兄，你虽这等说，你还没捉摸。不若我的生意有捉摸，定不遭此等事。”李定道：“你那水面上营生，极凶极险，隐隐暗暗，有什么捉摸？”张稍道：“你是不晓得。这长安城里，西门街上，有一个卖卦的先生。我每日送他一尾金色鲤，他就与我袖传一课，依方位，百下百着。今日我又去买卦，他教我在泾河湾头东边下网，西岸抛钓，定获满载鱼虾而归。明日上城来，卖钱沽酒，再与老兄相叙。”二人从此叙别。</p>

<P>How true it is that if you talk on the road there will be someone listening in the grass. A patrolling yaksha from the Jing River Palace overheard Zhang Shao's remark about always catching fish and rushed straight back to the palace of crystal to make an urgent report of disaster to the dragon king.</P>
<P>&#8220;What disaster?&#8221; asked the dragon king, and the yaksha replied, &#8220;Your subject was patrolling in the water by the river's edge when I heard a fisherman and a woodcutter talking. Just when they were parting they sounded very dangerous. The fisherman said that there is a soothsayer on West Gate Street in Chang'an city whose predictions are very accurate. The fisherman gives him a golden carp every day, and he hands the fisherman a slip saying that he'll catch fish at every attempt. If his calculations are so accurate, won't all we water folk be wiped out? Shall we fortify the water palace, or shall we make some leaping waves to strengthen Your Majesty's prestige?&#8221;</P>
<P>The dragon king seized his sword in a great rage, intending to go straight to Chang'an city and destroy this fortune-teller, but then his dragon sons and grandsons, shrimp officials, crab soldiers, shad generals, mandarin-fish ministers, and carp premier submitted a joint memorial that read: &#8220;We beg Your Majesty not to act in anger. As the saying goes, 'words overheard are not to be trusted.' If Your Majesty were to go now you would have to be accompanied by clouds and helped by rain; and if this frightens the common people of Chang'an, Heaven may take offence. Your Majesty is capable of making all sorts of transformations, and of appearing and vanishing unexpectedly; so you should change into a scholar for this visit to Chang'an. If you find that it is true, you will be able to punish him at your leisure; and if it turns out to be false, you will avoid killing an innocent man.&#8221; Taking their advice, the dragon king put aside his sword, and without raising clouds or rain he climbed out on the back, shook himself, and turned into a scholar dressed in white. He was</P>

Although the cyclical characters are supposed to be in concordance, I'm afraid that the Year Planet may be offended by the Sun.&#8221; As soon as he heard this the dragon king knew that this was the place where fortunes were told, so he pushed through the crowds to look inside.

<P>Who was he? He was Yuan Shoucheng, the uncle of Yuan Tiangang the Imperial Astrologer. He was famous throughout the country, and the leading member of his profession in Chang'an. The dragon king went in to see him, and when they had greeted each other he asked the dragon king to sit down, while a servant brought tea.</P>
<P>&#8220;What have you come to ask about, sir?&#8221; asked the soothsayer, and the dragon king replied, &#8220;I beg you to uncover the secrets of the sky for me.&#8221; The soothsayer passed him a slip of paper from his sleeve and said, &#8220;Clouds obscure the mountain peak, mist covers the tree tops. If there is to be rain, it will certainly come tomorrow.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When will it rain tomorrow,&#8221; asked the dragon king, &#8220;and how many inches of rain will fall?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Tomorrow the clouds will gather at mid-morning; late in the morning there will be thunder; at noon it will start to rain; and in the early afternoon the rain will finish, after 3 feet 3.48 inches have fallen,&#8221; replied the soothsayer.</P>
<P>&#8220;I trust that you are not fooling,&#8221; said the dragon king. &#8220;If it rains tomorrow at the time and to the depth you have predicted I shall pay you a fee of fifty pieces of gold. If it does not rain, or if it does not rain at the time and to the depth you say it will, then I'm telling you straight that I'll smash up your shopfront, tear down your sign and run you out of Chang'an so that you won't be able to deceive the people a moment longer.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That is entirely up to you,&#8221; replied the other cheerfully. &#8220;We shall meet again tomorrow after the rain.&#8221;</p>

<p>此人是谁？原来是当朝钦天监台正先生袁天罡的叔父，袁守诚是也。那先生果然相貌稀奇，仪容秀丽，名扬大国，术冠长安。龙王入门来，与先生相见。礼毕，请龙上坐，童子献茶。先生问曰：“公来问何事？”龙王曰：“请卜天上阴晴事如何。”先生即袖传一课，断曰：“云迷山顶，雾罩林梢。若占雨泽，准在明朝。”龙王曰：“明日甚时下雨？雨有多少尺寸？”先生道：“明日辰时布云，巳时发雷，午时下雨，未时雨足，共得水三尺三寸零四十八点”。龙王笑曰：“此言不可作戏。如是明日有雨，依你断的时辰数目，我送课金五十两奉谢。若无雨，或不按时辰数目，我与你实说，定要打坏你的门面，扯碎你的招牌，即时赶出长安，不许在此惑众！”先生欣然而答：“这个一定任你。请了，请了，明朝雨后来会。”</p>

<P>The dragon king took his leave and went back to his watery palace from Chang'an. The greater and lesser water spirits greeted him with the question, &#8220;How did Your Majesty's visit to the soothsayer go?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It was all right,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;but he was a smooth-tongued fortune-teller. When I asked him when it would rain, he said tomorrow. When I asked what time of day it would be and how much would fall, he said that at mid-morning the clouds would gather, late in the morning it would thunder, at noon it would start to rain, and early in the afternoon it would stop raining. He also said that 3 feet 3.48 inches of rain would fall. I made a wager with him that if his prediction turned out to be true, I'd give him fifty ounces of gold; but if he got it at all wrong, I'd smash up his shopfront id drive him out, so that he wouldn't be able to deceive the public any longer. The watery tribe laughed and said, &#8220;Your Majesty is the General Superintendent of the Eight Rivers and the Great Dragon God of the Rain, so only you can know whether there will be rain. How dare he talk such nonsense? That fortune-teller is bound to lose, absolutely bound to.&#8221;</p>

<p>龙王辞别，出长安，回水府。大小水神接着，问曰：“大王访那卖卦的如何？”龙王道：“有，有，有！但是一个掉嘴口讨春的先生。我问他几时下雨，他就说明日下雨；问他什么时辰，什么雨数，他就说辰时布云，巳时发雷，午时下雨，未时雨足，得水三尺三寸零四十八点，我与他打了个赌赛；若果如他言，送他谢金五十两；如略差些，就打破他门面，赶他起身，不许在长安惑众。”众水族笑曰：“大王是八河都总管，司雨大龙神，有雨无雨，惟大王知之，他怎敢这等胡言？那卖卦的定是输了，定是输了！”</p>

<P>Just as all the dragon sons and grandsons were laughing and talking about this with the fish ministers and crab soldiers a shout was heard from the sky: &#8220;Dragon King of the Jing River, prepare to receive an Imperial Decree.&#8221; They all looked up and saw a warrior in golden clothes coming towards the watery palace with a decree from the Jade Emperor in his hands. This alarmed the dragon king, who straightened his clothes, stood up solemnly, burnt incense and received the decree. The gold-clad warrior returned to the sky. Giving thanks for the imperial grace the dragon king opened the letter and read:</P>


<P>&#8220;We order the Superintendent of the Eight Rivers to travel with thunder and lightning and succor the city of Chang'an with rain.&#8221;</P>


<P>The time and the amount on the decree were exactly the same as those foretold by the soothsayer, which so startled the dragon king that he passed out. When he came round a moment later he said to the watery tribe, &#8220;How can there be a man of such powers in the mortal world? He is really someone who knows everything about Heaven and Earth&#8212;I'm bound to be beaten by him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty should not worry,&#8221; submitted General Shad in a memorial. &#8220;There will be no difficulty about beating him. Your subject has a humble plan that I can guarantee will shut that scoundrel's mouth.&#8221; When the dragon king asked what the plan was, the general replied, &#8220;Make it rain at the wrong time and not quite enough, so that his predictions are wrong, and then you will surely beat him. There will be nothing to stop you smashing his sign to smithereens and running him out of town.&#8221; The dragon king accepted his advice and stopped worrying.</p>

<p>此时龙子龙孙与那鱼鲫蟹士，正欢笑谈此事未毕，只听得半空中叫：“泾河龙王接旨。”众抬头上看，是一个金衣力士，手擎玉帝敕旨，径投水府而来。慌得龙王整衣端肃，焚香接了旨。金衣力士回空而去。龙王谢恩，拆封看时，上写着：“敕命八河总，驱雷掣电行；明朝施雨泽，普济长安城。”旨意上时辰数目，与那先生判断者毫发不差，唬得那龙王魂飞魄散。少顷苏醒，对众水族曰：“尘世上有此灵人，真个是能通天彻地，却不输与他呵！”鲥军师奏曰：“大王放心。要赢他有何难处？臣有小计，管教灭那厮的口嘴。”龙王问计，军师道：“行雨差了时辰，少些点数，就是那厮断卦不准，怕不赢他？那时扌卒碎招牌，赶他跑路，果何难也？”龙王依他所奏，果不担忧。</p>

<P>The next day he ordered Viscount Wind, Duke Thunder, the Cloud Youth and Mother Lightning to go to the sky above the city of Chang'an. He waited till late in the morning before spreading the clouds, unleashed the thunder at noon, started the rain in the early afternoon, and stopped it in the late afternoon, when only three feet and 0.4 inches had fallen. He had thus changed the times by two hours and reduced the amount of rain by .08 inches. After the rain he dismissed his generals and his hosts and put away his clouds; then he changed back into a white-clad scholar and charged into Yuan Shoucheng's fortune-telling stall on West Gate Street. Without even asking for an explanation he smashed up Yuan's sign, his brush, his inkstone, and everything else, while the fortune-teller remained calmly in his chair without moving.</P>
<P>The dragon king brandished the door in the air, ready to hit him with it, and began to pour abuse on him: &#8220;You evil man, with all your reckless talk about blessings and disasters; you stinking deceiver of the masses. Your predictions are false, and you talk nonsense. You got the time and the amount of today's rain quite wrong, but you still sit there so high and mighty. Get out at once if you want me to spare your life.&#8221; Yuan Shoucheng, who was as calm and unfrightened as ever, looked up to the sky with a mocking smile.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm not afraid,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I'm not afraid. I've committed no capital offence, but I fear that you have. You may be able to fool other people, but you can't fool me. I know who you are. You're no scholar; you're the Dragon King of the River Jing. You flouted a decree of the Jade Emperor by changing the time of the rain and cutting down the amount, which is a crime against the laws of Heaven. I'm afraid that you're for the executioner's blade on the Dragon-slicing Scaffold. Are you going to keep up that abuse of me?&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing this the dragon king trembled from fear and his hair stood on end. Dropping the door at once he straightened his clothes and made gestures of submission, kneeling to the soothsayer and saying, &#8220;Please do not be angry with me, sir; I was only joking. I never thought that it would be taken seriously. Whatever am I to do if I have broken the laws of Heaven? I beg you to save me, sir. If you don't I shall haunt you after my death.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I can't save you,&#8221; replied Yuan Shoucheng, &#8220;but I can suggest one way by which you may be able to save your skin.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I beg you to tell me,&#8221; implored the dragon king.</P>
<P>&#8220;Tomorrow afternoon at half past one you will have to go to the office of the official in charge of personnel, Wei Zheng, to be beheaded. If you want to stay alive you must report at once to the present Tang Emperor, Taizong, as Wei Zheng is a minister of his; and if you can get him to speak for you, you will be all right.&#8221; The dragon king took his leave of the soothsayer with tears in his eyes and went away. The sun was setting in the West, and the moon and stars were coming out.</p>

<P>&nbsp;As clouds settle round the mountains the crows fly back to roost,</P>
<P>The travelers on long journeys find inns for the night.</P>
<P>The returning geese sleep on a sandbank by the ford,</P>
<P>As the Milky Way appears.</P>
<P>While the hours push on</P>
<P>A lamp in the lonely village burns with barely a flame.</P>
<P>Pure is the monastery as the reed smoke curls in the breeze;</P>
<P>Men disappear in the butterfly dream.</P>
<P>As the moon sinks, flower shadows climb the rails,</P>
<P>The stars are a jumble of light.</P>
<P>The hours are called,</P>
<P>The night is already half way through.</p>

<P>The Dragon King of the River Jing did not return to his watery palace but stayed in the sky until the small hours of the morning, when he put away his cloud and his mist horn, and went straight to the gate of the Imperial Palace. At this very moment the Tang Emperor dreamt that he went out of the palace gate to stroll among the flowers in the moonlight. The dragon king at once took human form, went up to him and knelt and bowed before him, crying, &#8220;Save me, Your Majesty, save me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Who are you, that we should save you?&#8221; asked Taizong.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty is a true dragon,&#8221; replied the dragon king, &#8220;and I am a wicked dragon. As I have offended against the laws of Heaven, I am due to be beheaded by Your Majesty's illustrious minister Wei Zheng, the official in charge of personnel, so I have come to beg you to save me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you are supposed to be beheaded by Wei Zheng, we can save you, so set your mind at rest and go along now,&#8221; said the Tang Emperor. The dragon king, who was extremely happy, kowtowed in thanks and went away.</P>
<P>Taizong remembered his dream when he woke up. It was now half past four in the morning, so Taizong held court before the assembled civil and military officials.</P>

<p>这泾河龙王也不回水府，只在空中，等到子时前后，收了云头，敛了雾角，径来皇宫门首。此时唐王正梦出宫门之外，步月花阴，忽然龙王变作人相，上前跪拜。口叫“陛下，救我，救我！”太宗云：“你是何人？朕当救你。”龙王云：“陛下是真龙，臣是业龙。臣因犯了天条，该陛下贤臣人曹官魏征处斩，故来拜求，望陛下救我一救！”太宗曰：“既是魏征处斩，朕可以救你。你放心前去。”龙王欢喜，叩谢而去。</p>


<p>却说那太宗梦醒后，念念在心。早已至五鼓三点，太宗设朝，聚集两班文武官员。但见那——</p>

<P>When the officials had all done homage they divided into their groups. The Tang Emperor looked at them one by one with his dragon and phoenix eyes. Among the civil officials he observed Fang Xuanling, Du Ruhui, Xu Shiji, Xu Jingzong, Wang Gui and others; and among the military officers he saw Ma Sanbao, Duan Zhixian, Yin Kaishan, Cheng Yaojin, Liu Hongji, Hu Jingde, and Qin Shubao among others. Every one of them was standing there solemnly and with dignity, but he could not see Minister Wei Zheng among them.</P>
<P>He summoned Xu Shiji into the palace hall and said to him, &#8220;We had a strange dream last night in which a man came and bowed to us, claiming that he was the Dragon King of the River Jing. He had broken the laws of Heaven, and was due to be beheaded by the official in the personnel department, Wei Zheng. He begged us to save him, and we agreed. Why is it that the only official missing at court today is Wei Zheng?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If this dream is true,&#8221; replied Xu Shiji, &#8220;Wei Zheng must be summoned to the palace, and Your Majesty must not let him out of doors. Once today is over the Dragon King will be saved.&#8221; The Tang Emperor was overjoyed and he sent a personal aide with a decree summoning Wei Zheng to court.</p>

<div class="right">
<p>众官朝贺已毕，各各分班。唐王闪凤目龙睛，一一从头观看，只见那文官内是房玄龄、杜如晦、徐世卞、许敬宗、王圭等，武官内是马三宝、段志贤、殷开山、程咬金、刘洪纪、胡敬德、秦叔宝等，一个个威仪端肃，却不见魏征丞相。唐王召徐世勣上殿道：“朕夜间得一怪梦，梦见一人迎面拜谒，口称是泾河龙王，犯了天条，该人曹官魏征处斩，拜告寡人救他，朕已许诺。今日班前独不见魏征，何也？”世勣对曰：“此梦告准，须臾魏征来朝，陛下不要放他出门。过此一日，可救梦中之龙。”唐王大喜，即传旨，着当驾官宣魏征入朝。</p>

<P>That night the minister Wei Zheng had been reading the stars in his residence and was just burning some precious incense when he heard a crane calling in the sky. It was a messenger from Heaven with a decree from the Jade Emperor ordering him to behead the Dragon King of the River Jing in a dream at half past one the following afternoon. The minister thanked Heaven for its grace, fasted and bathed himself, tried out the sword of his wisdom, and exercised his soul. This was why he did not go to court. When the imperial aide came with a summons he was frightened and nonplussed; but he did not dare to delay in obeying an order from his monarch, so he hurriedly tidied his clothes, tightened his belt, and went to the palace with the summons in his hands. He kowtowed to the Emperor and admitted his fault.</P>
<P>&#8220;We forgive you,&#8221; said the Emperor. The officials had not yet withdrawn, so the Emperor now ordered the curtains to be lowered and dismissed them. The only one of them he kept behind was Wei Zheng, whom he ordered to mount the golden chariot and come to his private quarters with him, where they discussed the policies to bring peace and stability to the country.</P>
<P>At about noon he ordered the palace ladies to bring a large<I> weiqi</I> chess set and said, &#8220;We shall now have a game of chess.&#8221; The Imperial concubines brought in a chess board and set it on the Emperor's table. Thanking the Tang Emperor for his grace, Wei Zheng started to play with him. </P>

<p>却说魏征丞相在府，夜观乾象，正爇宝香，只闻得九霄鹤唳，却是天差仙使，捧玉帝金旨一道，着他午时三刻，梦斩泾河老龙。这丞相谢了天恩，斋戒沐浴，在府中试慧剑，运元神，故此不曾入朝。一见当驾官赍旨来宣，惶惧无任；又不敢违迟君命，只得急急整衣束带，同旨入朝，在御前叩头请罪。唐王出旨道：“赦卿无罪。”那时诸臣尚未退朝，至此，却命卷帘散朝，独留魏征，宣上金銮，召入便殿，先议论安邦之策，定国之谋。将近巳末午初时候，却命宫人取过大棋来，“朕与贤卿对弈一局。”众嫔妃随取棋枰，铺设御案。魏征谢了恩，即与唐王对弈。毕竟不知胜负如何，且听下回分解。</p>
