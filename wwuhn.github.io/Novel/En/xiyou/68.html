<P>The Dhyana-Nature Is Stable and Tuoluo Village Is Saved</P>
<P>The Mind of the Way Is Purified As Corruption Is Removed</P>
</div>
<P>The story tells how Sanzang and his three disciples happily continued along their way after leaving the Lesser Western Heaven. They had been going for over a month, and it was now late spring. The flowers were in bloom and all the woods they could see were full of green shade. After a spell of wind and rain dusk was falling once more.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang, reining in his horse, &#8220;it's getting late. Which way shall we go to look for somewhere to spend the night?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry, Master,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile. &#8220;Even if we can't find anywhere to stay we three all have our skills. Tell Pig to cut some grass and Friar Sand to fell some pines. I know a bit of carpentry. We can make ourselves a hut by the road here good enough to stay in for a year. Why the rush?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But this is no place to stay, brother,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;The mountain's crawling with wild beasts like tigers, leopards and wolves. Mountain ogres and hobgoblins are all over the place. It's hard enough travelling by daylight. I wouldn't dare spend the night here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Idiot!&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;You're getting more and more hopeless. I'm not just shooting my mouth off. With this cudgel in my hands I could hold up the sky itself if it collapsed.&#8221;</P>
<P>Master and disciples were in the middle of their conversation when they noticed a hill farm not far away. &#8220;Good,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;a place for the night.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where?&#8221; the venerable elder asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Isn't that a house in the trees over there?&#8221; asked Monkey, pointing. &#8220;Let's ask if we can put up for the night there. We can be on our way first thing in the morning.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang was so delighted he urged his horse forward. Dismounting outside the wicker gates he found them firmly fastened.</P>
<P>&#8220;Open up, open up,&#8221; he called, knocking on the gates. They were opened from the inside by an old man with a stick who was wearing rush sandals, a black turban and a plain gown.</P>
<P>&#8220;Who's that shouting?&#8221; he asked.</P>
<P>Putting his hands together in front of his chest, Sanzang bowed in polite greeting and said, &#8220;Venerable patron, I am a monk sent from the East to fetch scriptures from the Western Heaven. As I have reached this distinguished place so late in the day I have come to your residence to ask for a night's lodging. I beg you to be charitable to us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Monk,&#8221; the elder said, &#8220;you may want to go to the West, but you'll never get there. This is the Lesser Western Heaven, and it's a very long way from here to the Great Western Heaven. This place alone is hard enough to get out of, to say nothing of the difficulties of the rest of the journey.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why is it hard to get out of?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>The old man put his hands together and replied, &#8220;About a dozen miles West of our village is a Runny Persimmon Lane and a mountain called Seven Perfections.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why 'Seven Perfections?'&#8220; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's 250 miles across,&#8221; the old man replied, &#8220;and covered with persimmons. There's an old saying that persimmon trees have seven perfections:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>1. They prolong life.</P>
<P>2. They are very shady.</P>
<P>3. No birds nest in them.</P>
<P>4. They are free of insects.</P>
<P>5. Their leaves are very beautiful after frost.</P>
<P>6. The fruit is excellent.</P>
<P>7. The branches and leaves are big and fat.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>That's why it's called Mount Seven Perfections. This is a big, thinly populated area, and nobody has ever been deep into the mountain. Every year over-ripe, rotten persimmons fall on the path, and they fill the rocky lane right up. The rain, dew, snow and frost attack them, and they rot all through the summer until the whole path is a mass of putrefaction. The people round here call it Runny Shit, or Runny Persimmon, Lane. When there's a West wind it smells even worse than a cesspit being emptied. As it's now high spring and there's strong Southeasterly blowing you can't smell it yet.&#8221; Sanzang felt too depressed to speak.</P>
<P>Monkey could not contain himself. &#8220;Silly old fool,&#8221; he shouted at the top of his voice. &#8220;We're here late at night to find somewhere to stay, and you're trying to scare us with all that talk. If your house really is so poky that there's no room for us to sleep indoors we'll spend the night squatting under this tree. So cut the cackle.&#8221; At the sight of Monkey's hideous face the old man shut his mouth, petrified with fear.</P>
<P>Then he plucked up his courage, pointed his stick at Monkey and shouted, &#8220;Damn you, you bony-faced, pointy-browed, flat-nosed, sunken-cheeked, hairy-eyed, sickly-looking devil. You've got no sense of respect, sticking your mouth out like that and insulting an old gentleman.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're not very perceptive, old chap,&#8221; Monkey replied, putting on a smile. &#8220;You don't realize who this sickly-looking devil is. As the manual of physiognomy says, 'A freakish face is like a rock in which fine jade is hidden.' You're completely wrong to judge people on their looks. Ugly I certainly am, but I know a trick or two.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you from?&#8221; the old man asked. &#8220;What's your name? What powers do you have?&#8221; To this Monkey replied with a smile:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;My home is in the Eastern Continent of Superior Body;</P>
<P>My conduct I cultivated on the Mount of Flowers and Fruit.</P>
<P>After studying with the Patriarch of the Spirit-tower Heart Mountain</P>
<P>I learned complete and perfect skill in the martial arts.</P>
<P>I can stir up the oceans, subdue mother dragons,</P>
<P>Carry mountains on my shoulders, and drive the sun along.</P>
<P>At capturing monsters and demons I'm champion;</P>
<P>Ghosts and gods are terrified when I shift the stars.</P>
<P>Great is my fame as sky-thief and earth-turner;</P>
<P>I'm the Handsome Stone Monkey of infinite transformations.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This turned the old man's anger to delight. Bowing to them he said, &#8220;Please come into my humble abode and make yourselves comfortable.&#8221; The four of them then went in together, leading the horse and carrying the load. All that could be seen to either side of the gates were prickly thorns. The inner gates were set in a wall of brick and stone that had more thorns on top of it, and only when they had gone through them did they see a three-roomed tiled house. The old man pulled up chairs for them to sit on while they waited for tea to be brought and gave orders for a meal. Soon a table was brought in and set with wheat gluten, beancurd, sweet potatoes, radishes, mustard greens, turnips, rice and sour-mallow soup.</P>
<P>Master and disciples all ate their fill. After the meal Pig pulled Monkey aside and whispered, &#8220;Brother, the old bloke wasn't going to let us stay at first. Now he's given us this slap-up meal. Why?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It wasn't worth very much, was it?&#8221; Brother Monkey replied. &#8220;Tomorrow we'll make him give us ten kinds of fruit and ten dishes of food.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've got a nerve,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;You talked him into giving us a meal all right with all that boasting. But we'll be on our way tomorrow. How can he give you things?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be so impatient,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;I've got a way to cope.&#8221;</P>
<P>Dusk soon started to draw in. The old man brought a lamp, and Monkey asked with a bow, &#8220;What is your surname, sir?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Li,&#8221; the old man replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;I suppose this must be Li Village,&#8221; Monkey continued.</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the old man, &#8220;this is Tuoluo Village. Over five hundred families live here. Most of them have other surnames. I am the only one called Li.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Benefactor Li,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;with what kind intentions did you give us that ample meal?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Just now you said that you could capture evil monsters,&#8221; said the old man. &#8220;We have a monster here that we'd like you to capture for us, and we will of course reward you generously.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey then chanted a &#8220;na-a-aw&#8221; of respect and said, &#8220;I accept your commission.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Just look at him,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;asking for trouble. The moment he hears there's a demon to catch he's nicer to him than he would be to his own grandfather. He even chanted a 'na-a-aw' first.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't understand, brother,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;My 'na-a-aw' clinched the deal. Now he won't hire anyone else.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Sanzang heard this he said, &#8220;You monkey, you always want to grab things for yourself. If that evil spirit's powers are too great for you to capture him then we monks will be shown up as liars.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be cross with me, Master,&#8221; Monkey said with a smile. &#8220;Let me ask some more questions.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What else?&#8221; the old man asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;This fine village is on an open plain and a lot of people live here,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;It's not remote and isolated. What evil spirit would dare come to your door?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I will be frank with you,&#8221; the old man replied. &#8220;We had long lived in peace and prosperity here till a sudden, strong wind blew three and a half years ago. Everyone was busy at the time threshing the wheat on the threshing floor or transplanting rice in the paddy fields. We thought it was just a change in the weather. We never imagined that when the wind had blown by an evil spirit would eat the horses and cattle that people had put out to pasture as well as the pigs and the sheep. He swallowed hens and geese whole, and any men or women he found he devoured alive. Since then he's come again each of the last two years to murder us. Venerable sir, if you really do have magic powers to capture the evil spirit and cleanse the place of him, we will most certainly reward you generously and with great respect.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But the monster will be hard to catch,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;very hard. We're pilgrim monks only here for the night. We'll be on our way tomorrow. We can't catch any monsters.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So you monks just tricked that meal out of me,&#8221; the old man said. &#8220;When we first met you talked very big. You said you could move the stars and capture evil monsters. But now I've told you about this you pretend he can't be caught.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Old man,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;it would be easy to catch the evil spirit, except that you people here don't work together. That's why it's hard.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you be so sure that we don't work together?&#8221; the old man asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;If the monster has been harassing you for three years, goodness only knows how many lives he's taken,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;I reckon that if every family put up one ounce of silver the five hundred households could raise five hundred ounces, and with that you could find a priest somewhere who'd exorcise the monster. Why did you cheerfully put up with three years of such cruelty from him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You talk of spending money,&#8221; the old man said. &#8220;You're trying to shame us to death. Every family here has spent four or five ounces of silver. The year before last we went to invite a Buddhist monk South of the mountains here to catch the monster, but he failed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How did the monk try to do it?&#8221; Brother Monkey asked. To this the old man replied:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;The monk wore a cassock</P>
<P>And recited the scriptures;</P>
<P>First the Peacock Sutra</P>
<P>And then the Lotus.</P>
<P>He burned incense in a burner,</P>
<P>Held a bell between his hands.</P>
<P>His reading of the scriptures</P>
<P>Alarmed the evil spirit,</P>
<P>Who came straight to the farm</P>
<P>Amid his wind and clouds.</P>
<P>The monk fought with the spirit</P>
<P>And it was a splendid sight:</P>
<P>One of them landed a punch,</P>
<P>The other grabbed at his foe.</P>
<P>The monk had the advantage of</P>
<P>Having a hairless head.</P>
<P>But soon the demon had won,</P>
<P>And gone straight back to his clouds.</P>
<P>When the wound had dried in the sun</P>
<P>We went up close for a look;</P>
<P>The monk's bald head was smashed open</P>
<P>Just like a ripe watermelon.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;In other words,&#8221; laughed Monkey, &#8220;he lost.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He just paid with his life,&#8221; the old man replied. &#8220;We were the ones who lost. We had to buy his coffin, pay for his funeral, and give compensation to his disciple. That silver wasn't enough for the disciple. He's still trying to sue us. He won't call it a day.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Did you hire anyone else to catch the demon?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Last year we invited a Taoist priest to do it,&#8221; the old man answered.</P>
<P>&#8220;How did he try?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The Taoist,&#8221; the old man replied,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wore a golden crown on his head,</P>
<P>And magic robes on his body,</P>
<P>He sounded his magic wand,</P>
<P>Used charms and water too.</P>
<P>He made gods and generals do his will,</P>
<P>Captured demons and goblins.</P>
<P>A wild wind howled and roared,</P>
<P>While black fog blotted all out.</P>
<P>Demon and Taoist</P>
<P>Were evenly matched;</P>
<P>They fought till nightfall,</P>
<P>When the fiend went back to the clouds.</P>
<P>Heaven and earth were clear</P>
<P>And all of us people were there.</P>
<P>We went out to search for the priest,</P>
<P>Found him drowned in the mountain stream.</P>
<P>When we fished him out to look</P>
<P>He was like a drenched chicken.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;In other words,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile, &#8220;he lost too.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He only paid with his life, but we had to spend a lot of money that wasn't really necessary,&#8221; the old man replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;It doesn't matter,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;It doesn't matter. Wait till I catch the demon for you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you've got the power to catch him I'll ask some of the village elders to write an undertaking to give you as much silver as you want when you've defeated him. You'll not be a penny short. But if you lose don't try to extort money out of us. We must each accept the will of heaven.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Old man,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;they've got you terrified of extortion. We're not like that. Send for the elders.&#8221;</P>
<P>The old man was delighted. He sent his slaves to invite seven or eight old men from among his next-door neighbors, his cousins, his wife's family and his friends. They all came to meet the strangers, and when they had greeted the Tang Priest they cheerfully discussed the capture of the demon.</P>
<P>&#8220;Which of your distinguished disciples will do it?&#8221; they asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I will,&#8221; said Monkey, putting his hands together in front of his chest.</P>
<P>&#8220;You'll never do, never,&#8221; said the old man with horror. &#8220;The evil spirit's magic powers are enormous, and it's huge too. Venerable sir, you're so tiny and skinny you'd slip through one of the gaps between its teeth.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Old man,&#8221; said Monkey with a smile, &#8220;You're no judge of people. Small I may be, but I'm solid. There's a lot more to me than meets the eye.&#8221; When the elders heard this they had to take him at his word.</P>
<P>&#8220;Venerable sir,&#8221; they said, &#8220;how big a reward will you want for capturing the demon?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why do you have to talk about a reward?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;As the saying goes, 'Gold dazzles, silver is white and stupid, and copper coins stink.' We're virtuous monks and we definitely won't take money.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case you must all be lofty monks who obey your vows,&#8221; the elders said. &#8220;But even if you won't accept money we can't let you work for nothing. We all live by agriculture. If you subdue the demon and clean the place up, every family here will give you a third of an acre of good farmland, which will make over 150 acres altogether. Your master and you disciples can build a monastery there and sit in meditation. That would be much better than going on your long journey.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It would be even worse,&#8221; replied brother Monkey with a smile. &#8220;If we asked for land we'd have to raise horses, do labor service, pay grain taxes and hand over hay. We'll never be able to go to bed at dusk or lie in after the fifth watch. It'd be the death of us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you won't accept anything, how are we to express our thanks?&#8221; the elders asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;We're men of religion,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Some tea and a meal will be thanks enough for us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's easy,&#8221; said the elders. &#8220;But how are you going to catch the demon?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Once it comes I'll get it,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;But it's enormous,&#8221; the elders said. &#8220;It stretches from the earth to the sky. It comes in wind and goes in mist. How are you ever going to get close to it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When it comes to evil spirits who can summon winds and ride on clouds,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;I treat them as mere kids. It makes no difference how big it is&#8212;I have ways of beating it.&#8221;</P>
<P>As they were talking the howl of a great wind made the eight or nine elders start shaking with fear. &#8220;Monk, you've asked for trouble and you've got it,&#8221; they said. &#8220;You talked about the monster and here he is.&#8221;</P>
<P>Old Mr. Li opened the door and said to his relations and the Tang Priest, &#8220;Come in, come in, the demon's here.&#8221;</P>
<P>This so alarmed Pig and Friar Sand that they wanted to go inside too, but Monkey grabbed each of them with one of his hands and said, &#8220;You're a disgrace. You're monks and you ought to know better. Stay where you are, and don't try to run away. Come into the courtyard with me. We're going to see what kind of evil spirit this is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;they've been through this before. The noise of the wind means that the demon's coming. They've all gone to hide. We're not friends or relations of the demon. We've had no business dealings with him. What do we want to see him for?&#8221; Monkey was so strong that with no further argument he hauled them into the courtyard and made them stand there while the wind blew louder and louder. It was a splendid wind that</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Uprooted trees and flattened woods, alarming wolves and tigers,</P>
<P>Stirred up the rivers and oceans to the horror of ghosts and gods,</P>
<P>Blowing the triple peaks of the great Mount Hua all upside down,</P>
<P>Shaking the earth and sky through the world's four continents.</P>
<P>Every village family shut fast its gates,</P>
<P>While boys and girls all fled for cover.</P>
<P>Black clouds blotted out the Milky Way;</P>
<P>Lamps lost their brightness and the world went dark.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Pig was shaking with terror. He lay on the ground, rooted into the earth with his snout and buried his head. He looked as if he had been nailed there. Friar Sand covered his face and could not keep his eyes open. Monkey knew from the sound of the wind that the demon was in it. A moment later, when the wind had passed, all that could be vaguely made out in the sky were two lamps.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brothers,&#8221; he said, looking down, &#8220;the wind's finished. Get up and look.&#8221; The idiot tugged his snout out, brushed the dirt off himself and looked up into the sky, where he saw the two lamps.</P>
<P>&#8220;What a laugh,&#8221; Pig said, laughing aloud, &#8220;What a laugh. It's an evil spirit with good manners. Let's make friends with it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's a very dark night,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;and you haven't even seen it, so how can you tell whether it's good or bad?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As they used to say in the old days,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;'Take a candle when you're out at night, and stay where you are if you haven't one.' You can see that it's got a pair of lanterns to light its way. It must be a good spirit.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're wrong,&#8221; Friar Sand said. &#8220;That's not a pair of lanterns: they're the demon's eyes.&#8221; This gave the idiot such a fright that he shrank three inches.</P>
<P>&#8220;Heavens,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If its eyes are that size goodness knows how big its mouth is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be scared, brother,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;You two guard the master while I go up and see what sort of mood it's in and what kind of evil spirit it is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;don't tell the monster about us.&#8221;</P>
<P>Splendid Monkey sprang up into mid-air with a whistle. &#8220;Not so fast,&#8221; he yelled at the top of his voice, brandishing his cudgel, &#8220;not so fast. I'm here.&#8221; When the monster saw him it took a firm stance and began to wield a long spear furiously.</P>
<P>Parrying with his cudgel, Monkey asked, &#8220;What part do you come from, monster? Where are you an evil spirit?&#8221; The monster ignored the questions and continued with its spearplay. Monkey asked again, and again there was no answer as the wild spearplay continued.</P>
<P>&#8220;So it's deaf and dumb,&#8221; Monkey smiled to himself. &#8220;Don't run away! Take this!&#8221; Unperturbed, the monster parried the cudgel with more wild spearplay. The mid-air battle ebbed and flowed until the middle of the night as first one then the other was on top, but still there was no victor. Pig and Friar Sand had a very clear view from the Li family courtyard, and they could see that the demon was only using its spear to defend itself and not making any attacks, while Monkey's cudgel was never far from the demon's head.</P>
<P>&#8220;Friar Sand,&#8221; said Pig with a grin, &#8220;you keep guard here. I'm going up to join in the fight. I'm not going to let Monkey keep all the credit for beating the monster to himself. He won't be the first to be given a drink.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid idiot leapt up on his cloud and joined in the fight, taking a swing with his rake. The monster fended this off with another spear. The two spears were like flying snakes or flashes of lightning. Pig was full of admiration.</P>
<P>&#8220;This evil spirit is a real expert with the spears. This isn't 'behind the mountain' spearplay; it's 'tangled thread' spearplay. It's not Ma Family style. It's what's called soft-shaft style.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't talk such nonsense, idiot,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;There's no such thing as soft-shaft style.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Just look,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;He's parrying us with the blades. You can't see the shafts. I don't know where he's hiding them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;All right then,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;perhaps there is a soft-shaft style. But this monster can't talk. I suppose it's not yet humanized: it's still got a lot of the negative about it. Tomorrow morning, when the positive is dominant, it's bound to run away. When it does we've got to catch up with it and not let it go.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>When the fight had gone on for a long time the East grew light. The monster didn't dare fight any longer, so it turned and fled, with Monkey and Pig both after it. Suddenly they smelled the putrid and overwhelming stench of Runny Persimmon Lane on Mount Seven Perfections.</P>
<P>&#8220;Some family must be emptying its cesspit,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;Phew! What a horrible stink!&#8221;</P>
<P>Holding his nose, Brother Monkey said, &#8220;After the demon, after the demon!&#8221; The monster went over the mountain and turned back into himself: a giant red-scaled python. Just look at it:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Eyes shooting stars,</P>
<P>Nostrils gushing clouds,</P>
<P>Teeth like close-set blades of steel,</P>
<P>Curving claws like golden hooks.</P>
<P>On its head a horn of flesh</P>
<P>Like a thousand pieces of agate;</P>
<P>Its body clad in scales of red</P>
<P>Like countless patches of rouge.</P>
<P>When coiled on the ground it might seem a brocade quilt;</P>
<P>When flying it could be mistaken for a rainbow.</P>
<P>From where it sleeps a stench rises to the heavens,</P>
<P>And in movement its body is wreathed in red clouds.</P>
<P>Is it big?</P>
<P>A man could not be seen from one side to the other.</P>
<P>Is it long?</P>
<P>It can span a mountain from North to South.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;So it's a long snake,&#8221; Pig said. &#8220;If it's a man-eater it could gobble up five hundred for a meal and still not be full.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Its soft-shafted spears are its forked tongue,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;It's exhausted by the chase. Attack it from behind.&#8221; Pig leapt up and went for it, hitting it with his rake. The monster dived into a cave, but still left seven or eight feet of tail sticking outside.</P>
<P>Pig threw down his rake, grabbed it and shouted, &#8220;Hold on, hold on!&#8221; He pulled with all his strength, but could not move it an inch.</P>
<P>&#8220;Idiot,&#8221; laughed Monkey, &#8220;let it go in. We'll find a way of dealing with it. Don't pull so wildly at the snake.&#8221; When Pig let go the monster contracted itself and burrowed inside.</P>
<P>&#8220;But we had half of it before I let go,&#8221; he grumbled. &#8220;Now it's shrunk and gone inside we're never going to get it out. We've lost the snake, haven't we?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The wretched creature is enormous and the cave is very narrow,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;It won't possibly be able to turn round in there. It definitely went straight inside, so the cave must have an exit at the other end for it to get out through. Hurry round and block the back door while I attack at the front.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot shot round to the other side of the mountain, where there was indeed another hole that he blocked with his foot. But he had not steadied himself when Monkey thrust his cudgel in at the front of the cave, hurting the monster so much that it wriggled out through the back. Pig was not ready, and when a flick of the snake's tail knocked him over he could not get back up: he lay on the ground in agony. Seeing that the cave was now empty Monkey rushed round to the other side, cudgel in hand, to catch the monster. Monkey's shouts made Pig feel so ashamed that he pulled himself to his feet despite the pain and started lashing out wildly with his rake.</P>
<P>At the sight of this Monkey said with a laugh, &#8220;What do you think you're hitting? The monster's got away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm 'beating the grass to flush out the snake.'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Cretin!&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;After it!&#8221;</P>
<P>The two of them crossed a ravine, where they saw the monster coiled up, its head held high and its enormous mouth gaping wide. It was about to devour Pig, who fled in terror. Monkey, however, went straight on towards it and was swallowed in a single gulp.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; wailed Pig, stamping his feet and beating his chest, &#8220;you've been destroyed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't fret, Pig,&#8221; called Monkey from inside the monster's belly, which he was poking around with his cudgel. &#8220;I'll make it into a bridge. Watch!&#8221; As he spoke the monster arched its back just like a rainbow-shaped bridge.</P>
<P>&#8220;It looks like a bridge all right,&#8221; Pig shouted, &#8220;but nobody would ever dare cross it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Then I'll make it turn into a boat,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Watch!&#8221; He pushed out the skin of the monster's belly with his cudgel, and with the skin against the ground and its head uplifted it did look like a river boat.</P>
<P>&#8220;It may look like a boat,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;but without a mast or sail it wouldn't sail very well in the wind.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Get out of the way then,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;and I'll make it sail for you.&#8221; He then jabbed his cudgel out as hard as he could through the monster's spine from the inside and made it stand some sixty or seventy feet high, just like a mast. Struggling for its life and in great pain the monster shot forward faster than the wind, going down the mountain and back the way it had come for over seven miles until it collapsed motionless in the dust. It was dead.</P>
<P>When Pig caught up with the monster he raised his rake and struck wildly at it. Monkey made a big hole in the monster's side, crawled out and said, &#8220;Idiot! It's dead and that's that. Why go on hitting it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;don't you realize that all my life I've loved killing dead snakes?&#8221; Only then did he put his rake away, grab the snake's tail and start pulling it backwards.</P>
<P>Meanwhile back at Tuoluo Village old Mr. Li and the others were saying to the Tang Priest, &#8220;Your two disciples have been gone all night, and they're not back yet. They must be dead.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm sure that there can be no problem,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;Let's go and look.&#8221; A moment later Monkey and Pig appeared, chanting as they dragged an enormous python behind them. Only then did everyone feel happy.</P>
<P>All the people in the village, young and old, male and female, knelt down and bowed to Sanzang, saying, &#8220;Good sirs, this is the evil spirit that has been doing so much damage. Now that you have used your powers to behead the demon and rid us of this evil we will be able to live in peace again.&#8221; Everyone was very grateful, and all the families invited them to meals as expressions of their gratitude, keeping master and disciples there for six or seven days, and only letting them go when they implored to be allowed to leave. As they would not accept money or any other gifts the villagers loaded parched grain and fruit on horses and mules hung with red rosettes and caparisoned with flags of many colours to see them on their way. From the five hundred households in the village some seven or eight hundred people set out with them.</P>
<P>On the journey they were all very cheerful, but before they reached Runny Persimmon Lane on Mount Seven Perfections Sanzang smelled the terrible stench and could see that their way was blocked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; he said to Monkey, &#8220;how are we going to get through?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's going to be hard,&#8221; replied Monkey, covering his nose. When even Monkey said that it was going to be hard Sanzang began to weep.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't upset yourself so, my lord,&#8221; said old Mr. Li and the other elders as they came up to him. &#8220;We have all come here with you because we're already decided what to do. As your illustrious disciples have defeated the evil spirit and rid the village of this evil we have all made up our minds to clear a better path for you over the mountain.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's nonsense, old man,&#8221; said Monkey with a grin. &#8220;You told us before that the mountain is some 250 miles across. You aren't Yu the Great's heavenly soldiers, so how could you possibly make a path across it? If my master is to get across it'll have to be through our efforts. You'll never do it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But how can we do it through our efforts?&#8221; Sanzang asked after dismounting.</P>
<P>&#8220;It'd certainly be hard to cross the mountain as it is now,&#8221; Monkey said, still smiling, &#8220;and it would be even harder to cut a new path. We'll have to go by the old lane. The only thing that worries me is that there may be nobody to provide the food.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a thing to say, venerable sir,&#8221; old Mr. Li said. &#8220;We can support you gentlemen for as long as you care to stay here. You can't say that nobody will provide the food.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case, go and prepare two hundredweight of parched grain, as well as some steamed cakes and buns,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;When our long-snouted monk has eaten his fill he'll turn into a giant boar and clear the old lane with his snout. Then my master will be able to ride his horse over the mountain while we support him. He'll certainly get across.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;you want to keep all the rest of you clean. Why should I be the only one to stink?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wuneng,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;if you can clear the lane with your snout and get me across the mountain that will be a very great good deed to your credit.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master, benefactors, please don't tease me,&#8221; said Pig with a smile. &#8220;I can do thirty-six transformations. If you ask me to become something that's light or delicate or beautiful or that flies I just can't. But ask me to turn into a mountain, a tree, a rock, a mound of earth, an elephant, a hog, a water buffalo or a camel and I can manage any of them. The only thing is that the bigger I make myself the bigger my belly gets. I can't do things properly unless it's full.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We've got plenty,&#8221; the people said, &#8220;We've got plenty. We've brought parched grain, fruit, griddle cakes and ravioli. We were going to give them to you when we'd made a path across the mountain. They can all be brought out for you to eat now. When you've transformed yourself and started work we'll send some people back to prepare more food to send you on your way with.&#8221; Pig was beside himself with delight.</P>
<P>Taking off his tunic and putting down his nine-pronged rake he said to them all, &#8220;Don't laugh at me. Just watch while I win merit doing this filthy job.&#8221; The splendid idiot made a spell with his hands, shook himself, and turned himself into a giant hog. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>His snout was long, his bristles short, and half of him was fat;</P>
<P>As a piglet in the mountains he had fed on herbs and simples.</P>
<P>Black was his face and his eyes as round as sun or moon;</P>
<P>The great ears on his head were just like plantain leaves.</P>
<P>His bones he'd made so strong he would live as long as heaven;</P>
<P>His thick skin had been tempered till it was hard as iron.</P>
<P>He grunted with a noise that came from a blocked-up nose;</P>
<P>His gasping breath rasped harshly in his throat.</P>
<P>Each of his four white trotters was a thousand feet high;</P>
<P>Every sword-like bristle was hundreds of yards in length.</P>
<P>Since pigs were first kept and fattened by mankind</P>
<P>Never had such a monster porker been seen as this today.</P>
<P>The Tang Priest and the rest were full of admiration</P>
<P>For Marshal Tian Peng and his magic powers.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Seeing what Pig had turned into, Brother Monkey asked the people who had come to see them off to pile up all the parched grain at once and told Pig to eat it. Not caring whether it was cooked or raw, the idiot downed it all at one gulp, then went forward to clear the way. Monkey told Friar Sand to take his sandals off and carry the luggage carefully and advised his master to sit firm in the carved saddle.</P>
<P>Then he took off his own tall boots and told everyone else to go back: &#8220;Could you be very kind and send some more food as soon as possible to keep my brother's strength up?&#8221;</P>
<P>Of the seven or eight hundred who were seeing the pilgrims off most had come on mules or horse and they rushed back to the village like shooting stars. The three hundred who were on foot stood at the bottom of the mountain to watch the travelers as they went away. Now it was ten miles or more from the village to the mountain, and another journey of over ten miles each way to fetch the food, making over thirty in all, so by the time they were back master and disciples were already far ahead of them. Not wanting to miss the pilgrims, the villagers drove their mules and horses into the lane and carried on after them through the night, only catching them up the next morning.</P>
<P>&#8220;Pilgrims,&#8221; they shouted, &#8220;wait a moment, wait a moment, sirs. We've brought food for you.&#8221; When Sanzang heard this he thanked them profusely, said that they were good and faithful people, and told Pig to rest and eat something to build up his strength. The idiot, who was on the second day of clearing the way with his snout, was by now ravenously hungry. The villagers had brought much more than seven or eight hundredweight of food, which he scooped up and devoured all at once, not caring whether it was rice or wheat. When he had eaten his fill he went back to clearing the way, while Sanzang, Monkey and Friar Sand thanked the villagers and took leave of them. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The peasants all went back to Tuoluo Village;</P>
<P>Across the mountain Pig had cleared the way.</P>
<P>Sanzang's faith was backed up by great power;</P>
<P>Sun's demon-quelling arts were on display.</P>
<P>A thousand years of filth went in a single morning;</P>
<P>The Seven Perfections Lane was opened up today,</P>
<P>The dirt of six desires all now removed,</P>
<P>Towards the Lotus Throne they go to pray.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know how much longer their journey was going to be or what evil monsters they would meet listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>拯救驼罗禅性稳</p>
<p>脱离秽污道心清</p>
</div>
<p>话说三藏四众，躲离了小西天，欣然上路。行经个月程途，正是春深花放之时，见了几处园林皆绿暗，一番风雨又黄昏。</p>

<p>三藏勒马道：“徒弟啊，天色晚矣，往那条路上求宿去？”行者笑道：“师父放心，若是没有借宿处，我三人都有些本事，叫八戒砍草，沙和尚扳松，老孙会做木匠，就在这路上搭个蓬庵，好道也住得年把，你忙怎的！”八戒道：“哥呀，这个所在，岂是住场！</p>

<p>满山多虎豹狼虫，遍地有魑魅魍魉。白日里尚且难行，黑夜里怎生敢宿？”行者道：“呆子！越发不长进了！不是老孙海口，只这条棒子揝在手里，就是塌下天来，也撑得住！”</p>

<p>师徒们正然讲论，忽见一座山庄不远。行者道：“好了！有宿处了！”长老问：“在何处？”行者指道：“那树丛里不是个人家？我们去借宿一宵，明早走路。”长老欣然促马，至庄门外下马。只见那柴扉紧闭，长老敲门道：“开门，开门。”里面有一老者，手拖藜杖，足踏蒲鞋，头顶乌巾，身穿素服，开了门便问：</p>

<p>“是甚人在此大呼小叫？”三藏合掌当胸，躬身施礼道：“老施主，贫僧乃东土差往西天取经者。适到贵地，天晚特造尊府假宿一宵，万望方便方便。”老者道：“和尚，你要西行，却是去不得啊。此处乃小西天，若到大西天，路途甚远。且休道前去艰难，只这个地方，已此难过。”三藏问：“怎么难过？”老者用手指道：“我这庄村西去三十余里，有一条稀柿衕，山名七绝。”三藏道：“何为七绝？”老者道：“这山径过有八百里，满山尽是柿果。</p>

<p>古云柿树有七绝：一益寿，二多阴，三无鸟巢，四无虫，五霜叶可玩，六嘉实，七枝叶肥大，故名七绝山。我这敝处地阔人稀，那深山亘古无人走到。每年家熟烂柿子落在路上，将一条夹石胡同，尽皆填满；又被雨露雪霜，经霉过夏，作成一路污秽。这方人家，俗呼为稀屎衕。但刮西风，有一股秽气，就是淘东圊也不似这般恶臭。如今正值春深，东南风大作，所以还不闻见也。”三藏心中烦闷不言。行者忍不住，高叫道：“你这老儿甚不通便！我等远来投宿，你就说出这许多话来唬人！十分你家窄逼没处睡，我等在此树下蹲一蹲，也就过了此宵，何故这般絮聒？”那老者见了他相貌丑陋，便也拧住口，惊嘬嘬的，硬着胆，喝了一声，用藜杖指定道：“你这厮，骨挝脸，磕额头，塌鼻子，凹颉腮，毛眼毛睛，痨病鬼，不知高低，尖着个嘴，敢来冲撞我老人家！”行者陪笑道：“老官儿，你原来有眼无珠，不识我这痨病鬼哩！相法云形容古怪，石中有美玉之藏。你若以言貌取人，干净差了，我虽丑便丑，却倒有些手段。”老者道：“你是那方人氏？姓甚名谁？有何手段？”行者笑道：“我祖居东胜大神洲，花果山前自幼修。身拜灵台方寸祖，学成武艺甚全周。也能搅海降龙母，善会担山赶日头；缚怪擒魔称第一，移星换斗鬼神愁。</p>

<p>偷天转地英名大，我是变化无穷美石猴！”老者闻言，回嗔作喜，躬着身便教：请入寒舍安置。遂此，四众牵马挑担一齐进去，只见那荆针棘刺，铺设两边；二层门是砖石垒的墙壁，又是荆棘苫盖，入里才是三间瓦房。老者便扯椅安坐待茶，又叫办饭。少顷，移过桌子，摆着许多面筋、豆腐、芋苗、萝白、辣芥、蔓菁、香稻米饭、醋烧葵汤，师徒们尽饱一餐。吃毕，八戒扯过行者背云：“师兄，这老儿始初不肯留宿，今返设此盛斋，何也？”</p>

<p>行者道：“这个能值多少钱！到明日，还要他十果十菜的送我们哩！”八戒道：“不羞！凭你那几句大话，哄他一顿饭吃了，明日却要跑路，他又管待送你怎的？”行者道：“不要忙，我自有个处治。”</p>

<p>不多时，渐渐黄昏，老者又叫掌灯。行者躬身问道：“公公高姓？”老者道：“姓李。”行者道：“贵地想就是李家庄？”老者道：“不是，这里唤做驼罗庄，共有五百多人家居住。别姓俱多，惟我姓李。”行者道：“李施主，府上有何善意，赐我等盛斋？”那老者起身道：“才闻得你说会拿妖怪，我这里却有个妖怪，累你替我们拿拿，自有重谢。”行者就朝上唱个喏道：“承照顾了！”</p>

<p>八戒道：“你看他惹祸！听见说拿妖怪，就是他外公也不这般亲热，预先就唱个喏！”行者道：“贤弟，你不知，我唱个喏就是下了个定钱，他再不去请别人了。”三藏闻言道：“这猴儿凡事便要自专，倘或那妖精神通广大，你拿他不住，可不是我出家人打诳语么？”行者笑道：“师父莫怪，等我再问了看。”那老者道：</p>

<p>“还问甚？”行者道：“你这贵处，地势清平，又许多人家居住，更不是偏僻之方，有甚么妖精，敢上你这高门大户？”老者道：“实不瞒你说，我这里久矣康宁。只这三年六月间，忽然一阵风起，那时人家甚忙，打麦的在场上，插秧的在田里，俱着了慌，只说是天变了。谁知风过处，有个妖精将人家牧放的牛马吃了，猪羊吃了，见鸡鹅囫囵咽，遇男女夹活吞。自从那次，这二年常来伤害。长老啊，你若有手段，拿了他，扫净此土，我等决然重谢，不敢轻慢。”行者道：“这个却是难拿。”八戒道：“真是难拿，难拿！我们乃行脚僧，借宿一宵，明日走路，拿甚么妖精！”老者道：“你原来是骗饭吃的和尚！初见时夸口弄舌，说会换斗移星，降妖缚怪，及说起此事，就推却难拿！”行者道：“老儿，妖精好拿。只是你这方人家不齐心，所以难拿。”老者道：“怎见得人心不齐？”行者道：“妖精搅扰了三年，也不知伤害了多少生灵。</p>

<p>我想着每家只出银一两，五百家可凑五百两银子，不拘到那里，也寻一个法官把妖拿了，却怎么就甘受他三年磨折？”老者道：“若论说使钱，好道也羞杀人！我们那家不花费三五两银子！前年音访着山南里有个和尚，请他到此拿妖，未曾得胜。”</p>

<p>行者道：“那和尚怎的拿来？”老者道：“那个僧伽，披领袈裟。先谈《孔雀》，后念《法华》。香焚炉内，手把铃拿。正然念处，惊动妖邪。风生云起，径至庄家。僧和怪斗，其实堪夸：一递一拳捣，一递一把抓。和尚还相应，相应没头发。须臾妖怪胜，径直返烟霞，原来晒干疤。我等近前看，光头打的似个烂西瓜！”行者笑道：“这等说，吃了亏也。”老者道：“他只拚得一命，还是我们吃亏：与他买棺木殡葬，又把些银子与他徒弟。那徒弟心还不歇，至今还要告状，不得干净！”行者道：“再可曾请甚么人拿他？”老者道：“旧年又请了一个道士。”行者道：“那道士怎么拿他？”老者道：“那道士：头戴金冠，身穿法衣。令牌敲响，符水施为。驱神使将，拘到妖魑。狂风滚滚，黑雾迷迷。即与道士，两个相持。斗到天晚，怪返云霓。乾坤清朗朗，我等众人齐。出来寻道士，渰死在山溪。捞得上来大家看，却如一个落汤鸡！”</p>

<p>行者笑道：“这等说，也吃亏了。”老者道：“他也只舍得一命，我们又使彀闷数钱粮。”行者道：“不打紧，不打紧，等我替你拿他来。”老者道：“你若果有手段拿得他，我请几个本庄长者与你写个文书。若得胜，凭你要多少银子相谢，半分不少；如若有亏，切莫和我等放赖，各听天命。”行者笑道：“这老儿被人赖怕了。我等不是那样人，快请长者去。”</p>

<p>那老者满心欢喜，即命家僮请几个左邻右舍，表弟姨兄，亲家朋友，共有八九位老者，都来相见。会了唐僧，言及拿妖一事，无不欣然。众老问：“是那一位高徒去拿？”行者叉手道：“是我小和尚。”众老悚然道：“不济！不济！那妖精神通广大，身体狼犺。你这个长老，瘦瘦小小，还不彀他填牙齿缝哩！”行者笑道：“老官儿，你估不出人来。我小自小，结实，都是吃了磨刀水的，秀气在内哩！”众老见说只得依从道：“长老，拿住妖精，你要多少谢礼？”行者道：“何必说要甚么谢礼！俗语云，说金子幌眼，说银子傻白，说铜钱腥气！我等乃积德的和尚，决不要钱。”</p>

<p>众老道：“既如此说，都是受戒的高僧。既不要钱，岂有空劳之理！我等各家俱以鱼田为活，若果降了妖孽，净了地方，我等每家送你两亩良田，共凑一千亩，坐落一处，你师徒们在上起盖寺院，打坐参禅，强似方上云游。”行者又笑道：“越不停当！但说要了田，就要养马当差，纳粮办草，黄昏不得睡，五鼓不得眠，好倒弄杀人也！”众老道：“诸般不要，却将何谢？”行者道：</p>

<p>“我出家人，但只是一茶一饭，便是谢了。”众老喜道：“这个容易，但不知你怎么拿他。”行者道：“他但来，我就拿住他。”众老道：“那怪大着哩！上拄天，下拄地；来时风，去时雾，你却怎生近得他？”行者笑道：“若论呼风驾雾的妖精，我把他当孙子罢了；若说身体长大，有那手段打他！”</p>

<p>正讲处，只听得呼呼风响，慌得那八九个老者，战战兢兢道：“这和尚盐酱口！说妖精，妖精就来了！”那老李开了腰门，把几个亲戚连唐僧都叫：“进来！进来！妖怪来了！”唬得那八戒也要进去，沙僧也要进去。行者两只手扯住两个道：“你们忒不循理！出家人，怎么不分内外！站住！不要走！跟我去天井里，看看是个甚么妖精。”八戒道：“哥啊，他们都是经过帐的，风响便是妖来。他都去躲，我们又不与他有亲，又不相识，又不是交契故人，看他做甚？”原来行者力量大，不容说，一把拉在天井里站下。那阵风越发大了，好风：倒树摧林狼虎忧，播江搅海鬼神愁。掀翻华岳三峰石，提起乾坤四部洲。村舍人家皆闭户，满庄儿女尽藏头。黑云漠漠遮星汉，灯火无光遍地幽。慌得那八戒战战兢兢，伏之于地，把嘴拱开土，埋在地下，却如钉了钉一般。沙僧蒙着头脸，眼也难睁。</p>

<p>行者闻风认怪，一霎时风头过处，只见那半空中隐隐的两盏灯来，即低头叫道：“兄弟们！风过了，起来看！”那呆子扯出嘴来，抖抖灰土，仰着脸朝天一望，见有两盏灯光，忽失声笑道：“好耍子！好耍子！原来是个有行止的妖精！该和他做朋友！”沙僧道：“这般黑夜，又不曾觌面相逢，怎么就知好歹？”八戒道：“古人云，夜行以烛，无烛则止。你看他打一对灯笼引路，必定是个好的。”沙僧道：“你错看了，那不是一对灯笼，是妖精的两只眼亮。”这呆子就唬矮了三寸，道：“爷爷呀！眼有这般大啊，不知口有多少大哩！”行者道：“贤弟莫怕。你两个护持着师父，待老孙上去讨他个口气，看他是甚妖精。”八戒道：“哥哥，不要供出我们来。”好行者，纵身打个唿哨跳到空中，执铁棒厉声高叫道：“慢来！慢来！有吾在此！”那怪见了，挺住身躯，将一根长枪乱舞。行者执了棍势问道：“你是那方妖怪？何处精灵？”那怪更不答应，只是舞枪。行者又问，又不答，只是舞枪。</p>

<p>行者暗笑道：“好是耳聋口哑！不要走！看棍！”那怪更不怕，乱舞枪遮拦。在那半空中，一来一往，一上一下，斗到三更时分，未见胜败。八戒沙僧在李家天井里看得明白，原来那怪只是舞枪遮架，更无半分儿攻杀，行者一条棒不离那怪的头上。八戒笑道：“沙僧，你在这里护持，让老猪去帮打帮打，莫教那猴子独干这功，领头一钟酒。”好呆子，就跳起云头，赶上就筑，那怪物又使一条枪抵住。两条枪，就如飞蛇掣电。八戒夸奖道：“这妖精好枪法！不是山后枪，乃是缠丝枪，也不是马家枪，却叫做个软柄枪！”行者道：“呆子莫胡谈！那里有个甚么软柄枪！”八戒道：“你看他使出枪尖来架住我们，不见枪柄，不知收在何处。”行者道：“或者是个软柄枪。但这怪物还不会说话，想是还未归人道，阴气还重，只怕天明时阳气胜，他必要走。但走时，一定赶上，不可放他。”八戒道：“正是！正是！”</p>

<p>又斗多时，不觉东方发白，那怪不敢恋战，回头就走。行者与八戒一齐赶来，忽闻得污秽之气旭人，乃是七绝山稀柿衕也。八戒道：“是那家淘毛厕哩！哏！臭气难闻！”行者侮着鼻子只叫：“快快赶妖精！快快赶妖精！”那怪物撺过山去，现了本象，乃是一条红鳞大蟒。你看他：眼射晓星，鼻喷朝雾。密密牙排钢剑，弯弯爪曲金钩。头戴一条肉角，好便似千千块玛瑙攒成；身披一派红鳞，却就如万万片胭脂砌就。盘地只疑为锦被，飞空错认作虹霓。歇卧处有腥气冲天，行动时有赤云罩体。大不大，两边人不见东西；长不长，一座山跨占南北。八戒道：“原来是这般一个长蛇！若要吃人啊，一顿也得五百个，还不饱足！”行者道：“那软柄枪乃是两条信菾。我们赶他软了，从后打出去！”这八戒纵身赶上，将钯便筑。那怪物一头钻进窟里，还有七八尺长尾巴丢在外边。八戒放下钯，一把挝住道：“着手！</p>

<p>着手！”尽力气往外乱扯，莫想扯得动一毫。行者笑道：“呆子！</p>

<p>放他进去，自有处置，不要这等倒扯蛇。”八戒真个撒了手，那怪缩进去了。八戒怨道：“才不放手时，半截子已是我们的了！</p>

<p>是这般缩了，却怎么得他出来？这不是叫做没蛇弄了？”行者道：“这厮身体狼犺，窟穴窄小，断然转身不得，一定是个照直撺的，定有个后门出头。你快去后门外拦住，等我在前门外打。”那呆子真个一溜烟，跑过山去，果见有个孔窟，他就扎定脚。还不曾站稳，不期行者在前门外使棍子往里一捣，那怪物护疼，径往后门撺出。八戒未曾防备，被他一尾巴打了一跌，莫能挣挫得起，睡在地下忍疼。行者见窟中无物，搴着棍，穿进去叫赶妖怪。那八戒听得吆喝，自己害羞，忍着疼爬起来，使钯乱扑。行者见了笑道：“妖怪走了，你还扑甚的了？”八戒道：“老猪在此打草惊蛇哩！”行者道：“活呆子！快赶上！”</p>

<p>二人赶过涧去，见那怪盘做一团，竖起头来，张开巨口，要吞八戒，八戒慌得往后便退。这行者反迎上前，被他一口吞之。</p>

<p>八戒捶胸跌脚大叫道：“哥耶！倾了你也！”行者在妖精肚里，支着铁棒道：“八戒莫愁，我叫他搭个桥儿你看！”那怪物躬起腰来，就似一道路东虹，八戒道：“虽是象桥，只是没人敢走。”行者道：“我再叫他变做个船儿你看！”在肚里将铁棒撑着肚皮。</p>

<p>那怪物肚皮贴地，翘起头来，就似一只赣保船，八戒道：“虽是象船，只是没有桅篷，不好使风。”行者道：“你让开路，等我叫他使个风你看。”又在里面尽着力把铁棒从脊背上一搠将出去，约有五七丈长，就似一根桅杆。那厮忍疼挣命，往前一撺，比使风更快，撺回旧路，下了山有二十余里，却才倒在尘埃，动荡不得，呜呼丧矣。八戒随后赶上来，又举钯乱筑。行者把那物穿了一个大洞，钻将出来道：“呆子！他死也死了，你还筑他怎的？”八戒道：“哥啊，你不知我老猪一生好打死蛇？”遂此收了兵器，抓着尾巴，倒拉将来。</p>

<p>却说那驼罗庄上李老儿与众等对唐僧道：“你那两个徒弟，一夜不回，断然倾了命也。”三藏道：“决不妨事，我们出去看看。”须臾间，只见行者与八戒拖着一条大蟒，吆吆喝喝前来，众人却才欢喜。满庄上老幼男女都来跪拜道：“爷爷！正是这个妖精，在此伤人！今幸老爷施法，斩怪除邪，我辈庶各得安生也！”众家都是感激，东请西邀，各各酬谢。师徒们被留住五七日，苦辞无奈，方肯放行。又各家见他不要钱物，都办些干粮果品，骑骡压马，花红彩旗，尽来饯行。此处五百人家，到有七八百人相送。</p>

<p>一路上喜喜欢欢，不时到了七绝山稀柿同口。三藏闻得那般恶秽，又见路道填塞，道：“悟空，似此怎生度得？”行者侮着鼻子道：“这个却难也。”三藏见行者说难，便就眼中垂泪。李老儿与众上前道：“老爷勿得心焦。我等送到此处，都已约定意思了。令高徒与我们降了妖精，除了一庄祸害，我们各办虔心，另开一条好路，送老爷过去。”行者笑道：“你这老儿，俱言之欠当。你初然说这山径过有八百里，你等又不是大禹的神兵，那里会开山凿路！若要我师父过去，还得我们着力，你们都成不得。”三藏下马道：“悟空，怎生着力么！”行者笑道：“眼下就要过山，却也是难，若说再开条路，却又难也。须是还从旧胡同过去，只恐无人管饭。”李老儿道：“长老说那里话！凭你四位担搁多少时，我等俱养得起，怎么说无人管饭！”行者道：“既如此，你们去办得两石米的干饭，再做些蒸饼馍馍来，等我那长嘴和尚吃饱了，变了大猪，拱开旧路，我师父骑在马上，我等扶持着，管情过去了。”八戒闻言道：“哥哥，你们都要图个干净，怎么独教老猪出臭？”三藏道：“悟能，你果有本事拱开胡同，领我过山，注你这场头功。”八戒笑道：“师父在上，列位施主们都在此休笑话，我老猪本来有三十六般变化，若说变轻巧华丽飞腾之物，委实不能；若说变山，变树，变石块，变土墩，变赖象、科猪、水牛、骆驼，真个全会。只是身体变得大，肚肠越发大，须是吃得饱了，才好干事。”众人道：“有东西！有东西！我们都带得有干粮果品，烧饼馉饳在此。原要开山相送的，且都拿出来，凭你受用。待变化了，行动之时，我们再着人回去做饭送来。”八戒满心欢喜，脱了皂直裰，丢了九齿钯，对众道：“休笑话，看老猪干这场臭功。”好呆子，捻着诀，摇身一变，果然变做一个大猪，真个是嘴长毛短半脂膘，自幼山中食药苗。黑面环睛如日月，圆头大耳似芭蕉。修成坚骨同天寿，炼就粗皮比铁牢。齆齆鼻音呱诂叫，喳喳喉响喷喁哮。白蹄四只高千尺，剑鬣长身百丈饶。从见人间肥豕彘，未观今日老猪魈。唐僧等众齐称赞，羡美天蓬法力高。孙行者见八戒变得如此，即命那些相送人等，快将干粮等物推攒一处，叫八戒受用。那呆子不分生熟，一涝食之，却上前拱路。行者叫沙僧脱了脚，好生挑担，请师父稳坐雕鞍，他也脱了靴鞋，吩咐众人回去：“若有情，快早送些饭来与我师弟接力。”那些人有七八百相送随行，多一半有骡马的，飞星回庄做饭；还有三百人步行的，立于山下遥望他行。原来此庄至山，有三十余里，待回取饭来，又三十余里，往回担搁，约有百里之遥，他师徒们已此去得远了。众人不舍，催趱骡马进胡同，连夜赶至，次日方才赶上，叫道：“取经的老爷，慢行慢行！我等送饭来也！”长老闻言，谢之不尽道：“真是善信之人！”叫八戒住了，再吃些饭食壮神。那呆子拱了两日，正在饥饿之际，那许多人何止有七八石饭食，他也不论米饭、面饭，收积来一涝用之，饱餐一顿，却又上前拱路。三藏与行者、沙僧谢了众人，分手两别。正是：驼罗庄客回家去，八戒开山过同来。</p>

<p>三藏心诚神力拥，悟空法显怪魔衰。千年稀柿今朝净，七绝胡同此日开。六欲尘情皆剪绝，平安无阻拜莲台。这一去不知还有多少路程，还遇甚么妖怪，且听下回分解。</p>
