<P>All the Gods Meet a Vicious Foe</P>
<P>Maitreya Binds the Evil Monster</P>
</div>
<P>The story tells how the Great Sage Sun, finding himself at his wit's end, somersaulted by auspicious cloud straight to Mount Wudang in the Southern Continent of Jambu to ask the Heavenly Honoured Demon Suppressor to save Sanzang, Pig, Friar Sand, the heavenly soldiers and all the rest of them. He flew non-stop and was soon in sight of the patriarch's immortal domain. As he brought his cloud gently down to land and took a good look around this is what he saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The great fortress of the Southeast,</P>
<P>A divine pillar of the central heaven.</P>
<P>Lotus Pinnacle soared in its majesty,</P>
<P>Purple-covered Ridge rose to a great height.</P>
<P>The nine rivers ended here, far from Jing and Yang;</P>
<P>A hundred mountains touch the stars in Wing and Axletree.</P>
<P>Above was the precious cave of Emptiness,</P>
<P>And the spirit tower of Zhu and Lu.</P>
<P>In the thirty-six palaces golden chimes rang,</P>
<P>As thousands of worshippers offered their incense.</P>
<P>Here the emperors of antiquity patrolled and worshipped,</P>
<P>Officials held jade tablets inscribed in gold.</P>
<P>Blue birds flew over lofty towers;</P>
<P>Under the canopies red gowns were worn.</P>
<P>The place was set on a mountain that towered over the cosmos,</P>
<P>An immortal domain suffused with emptiness.</P>
<P>Some plum trees were just in blossom,</P>
<P>And the hillside was covered in a blaze of color from the flowers.</P>
<P>Dragons hid at the bottom of ravines</P>
<P>While tigers lurked on the precipices.</P>
<P>The pheasants seemed to be talking;</P>
<P>Tame deer came up to people.</P>
<P>White cranes perched in cloud-topped junipers;</P>
<P>Green and red phoenixes sang to the sun.</P>
<P>Jade-pure, it resembles a land of immortals;</P>
<P>The compassion of the golden gateway rules the age.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The True Martial Lord had been born after King Purejoy and his wife Queen Victoria had dreamed one night that she conceived by swallowing the light of the sun. After fourteen months of pregnancy she had given birth in the royal palace on the first day of the third month of the year<I> jiachen,</I> the first of the reign period of<I> Kaihuang.</I> The prince</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Was brave from his boyhood,</P>
<P>Grew into perception.</P>
<P>Did not take the throne,</P>
<P>But practised religion.</P>
<P>His parents could not stop him.</P>
<P>He gave up the palace</P>
<P>For mysteries and trance</P>
<P>Here in the mountains.</P>
<P>When all was completed</P>
<P>He could fly by broad daylight.</P>
<P>The Jade Emperor named him</P>
<P>The True Martial Lord.</P>
<P>He responds to dark emptiness,</P>
<P>Joining with tortoise and snake.</P>
<P>In all quarters of the compass</P>
<P>Is his excellence proclaimed.</P>
<P>He penetrates all mysteries,</P>
<P>Achieves every glory.</P>
<P>From beginning to end</P>
<P>He exterminates demons.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>While admiring the splendid view the Great Sage Sun was soon through the first, second and third gates to his heaven. When he arrived outside the Palace of Great Peace he saw five hundred spirit officers standing crowded together in the auspicious light and atmosphere. They stepped forward to ask, &#8220;Who is it who has come?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am Sun Wukong, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and I would like to see the Teacher.&#8221; The spirit officers reported this at once to the patriarch, who came from his throne hall to welcome Monkey into the palace hall.</P>
<P>After paying his respects Monkey said, &#8220;I have a request to trouble you with.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am in trouble escorting the Tang priest on his journey to seek scriptures in the Western Heaven,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;There is an evil monster who lives in the Lesser Thunder Monastery on a mountain called the Lesser Western Heaven in the Western Continent of Cattle-gift. When my master went in through the monastery gates and saw all the arhats, protectors, monks and priests line up there he thought that the Buddha was a real one, threw himself to the ground and started kowtowing to him. Then they caught him. Because I was too careless I let him trap me inside a pair of golden cymbals that were joined tight together without the slightest crack between them, just as if they were clamped together. Very luckily for me the Gold-headed Protector requested the Jade Emperor to send the Twenty-eight Constellations to come down to earth that very night. They couldn't prise the cymbals apart, but the Metal Dragon of the Gullet managed to push his horn between the cymbals and bring me out, thank goodness. Then I smashed the cymbals, which woke up the monster. When he came after us he caught us all&#8212;me, the Twenty-eight Constellations and the Five Protectors&#8212;and tied us all up with rope. I got out that night and rescued the constellations, the Tang Priest and the rest of them. Later I woke the old demon up again while I was looking for our things and he went after the heavenly soldiers to fight them again. When he took his pouch off to use it this time I recognized it and got away, but all the rest of them were caught. As I'm at my wit's end I've come to pay my respects to you, Teacher, and ask your help.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In the old days,&#8221; said the patriarch, &#8220;I garrisoned the North. My position was that of True Martial God, and I wiped out evil spirits all over the world on the orders of the Jade Emperor. Later I rode barefoot and with my hair loose on the leaping snake and the divine tortoise, and led the five thunder generals, young giant dragons, lions, ferocious beasts and vicious dragons to put an end to the black demonic atmosphere in the Northeast. That was when I was acting under the orders of the Original Heavenly Honoured One. Now I live in tranquility and ease on Mount Wudang in the Hall of Great Peace. The mountains and seas have long been at peace, and heaven and earth are very calm. In our Southern Continent of Jambu and the Northern Continent of Kuru all evil monsters have been exterminated and wicked demons are seen no more. I am very grateful that you've come to see me, Great Sage: the only trouble is that in the absence of instructions from Heaven I can't fight on my own authority alone. If I sent all my gods the Jade Emperor might well take offence; but if I turned your request down flat, Great Sage, I'd be showing a lack of finer feeling. I'm sure that even if there are evil creatures on that road West they cannot be really terrible. So I'll send General Tortoise, General Snake, and five magic dragons to help you. I guarantee that they will capture the evil spirit and rescue your master.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey then bowed in thanks to the patriarch and went with Tortoise, Snake and the magic dragons, all carrying the finest and sharpest of weapons, back to the West. Before long they were back at the Lesser Thunder Monastery, where they landed their clouds and went straight to the gate to challenge them to battle.</P>
<P>Meanwhile King Yellow Brow had called all his demonic hosts together before the main hall of the monastery to say to them, &#8220;Sun the Novice hasn't been here for the last couple of days. I wonder where he's gone for reinforcements.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before the words were out of his mouth a little devil came from the main gates to report, &#8220;Sun the Novice is here with some dragon, snake and tortoise officers. They're demanding battle outside the main gates.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How ever did that monkey get them?&#8221; the demon king asked. &#8220;Where are they from?&#8221;</P>
<P>With that he put on his armor and went out through the main gate, shouting, &#8220;Which dragon gods are you? How dare you invade my immortal domain?&#8221;</P>
<P>Looking majestic and summoning up their spirits, the five dragons and Generals Tortoise and Snake shouted, &#8220;Damned monster! We're five dragon gods, and Generals Tortoise and Snake who stand before the Heavenly Honoured Demon Suppressor, the Patriarch of the Indiffirentiated Unity, from the Palace of Great Peace on Mount Wudang. We are here at the invitation of the Great Sage Equaling Heaven and on the authority of the Heavenly Honoured One to arrest you. Hand over the Tang Priest, the constellations and all the rest of them and your life will be spared, you evil spirit. Otherwise we'll hack the bodies of every one of you devils on this mountain into little pieces, and burn all your buildings to ashes.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the demon heard this he was furious. &#8220;Animals!&#8221; he retorted. &#8220;How dare you talk like that? What sort of powers do you think you have? Stay where you are, and take this!&#8221; The five dragons turned their clouds over to make rain while the two generals raised dust and sand as they all charged into the attack with their spears, sabers, swords and halberds. Monkey followed them into action wielding his iron cudgel. It was a fine fight.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The evil demon used his might;</P>
<P>Monkey went for help.</P>
<P>When the evil demon used his might</P>
<P>He occupied the monastery and created Buddha images.</P>
<P>When Monkey went for help</P>
<P>He traveled far to a precious land to borrow the dragons.</P>
<P>Tortoise and Snake created water and fire;</P>
<P>The evil spirits took to arms.</P>
<P>The five dragons went to the West as instructed,</P>
<P>While Monkey hung behind for his master's sake.</P>
<P>Sword and halberd flashed like coloured lightning;</P>
<P>The spears and sabers gleamed like rainbows.</P>
<P>The wolf-toothed mace</P>
<P>Was powerful, short and flexible;</P>
<P>The gold-banded cudgel</P>
<P>Could change at its owner's will.</P>
<P>There were crashes like firecrackers,</P>
<P>And the rhythmic clang of metal being struck.</P>
<P>The monster was attacked by fire and water,</P>
<P>And weapons crowded close around the spirits.</P>
<P>The cries of battle frightened wolves and tigers;</P>
<P>The din disturbed both gods and devils.</P>
<P>Just when the battle was still unresolved</P>
<P>The evil spirit fetched out his treasure again.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Monkey had been leading the five dragons and two generals in fight against the demon king for an hour the demon took off his pouch and held it in his hand. &#8220;Watch out, gentlemen,&#8221; exclaimed Monkey in horror. Not realizing what was happening, they all stopped attacking with their weapons and surged forward. There was a loud swish as the demon king threw his pouch into the air. Abandoning the five dragons and the two generals to be wrapped up in the pouch, the Great Sage Monkey escaped by somersaulting up above the ninth heaven. The evil spirits returned in triumph once more, tied them up too, took them down into the pit and put the lid on it.</P>
<P>Monkey landed his cloud and lay sprawled out under the peak, listless and dispirited. &#8220;That demon is a terror,&#8221; he thought with bitter regret, and without realizing what was happening he shut his eyes as if he were going to sleep.</P>
<P>Just then there came a call: &#8220;Great Sage, don't go to sleep. Get up and rescue them as soon as you can. Your master's life is in great danger.&#8221; At once Monkey opened his eyes again and sprang to his feet to see that it was the Duty God of the Day.</P>
<P>&#8220;You wretched little god,&#8221; Monkey shouted, &#8220;you were so greedy for your blood and sacrifices over there that you haven't reported for duty for days. Why are you coming to disturb me now? Put out your foot. I'm going to hit you a couple of times to cheer myself up. I'm feeling low.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Duty God hastily bowed and said, &#8220;Great Sage, you are one of the happy immortals in the human world. How could you possibly be feeling low? We've been here for a long time on the Bodhisattva's orders to keep secret guard over the Tang Priest. We and the local gods have never left him for a moment, which is why we can't pay our respects to you often enough. You can't hold that against me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you're guarding him,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;tell me where the evil spirit has imprisoned the constellations, the protectors, the guardians, my master and the rest of them. What are they suffering?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your master and your fellow-disciples have been hung up in the cloister outside the main hall,&#8221; the Duty God replied. &#8220;The constellations are all in agony in a pit. For the last couple of days I've had no news of you, Great Sage, but I've just seen that the evil spirits have captured the divine dragons, Tortoise and Snake and put them in the pit too. It was only then that we realized you must have fetched some reinforcements, Great Sage, which is why we came specially to look for you. Whatever you do you must rescue them at once, Great Sage, no matter how tired you are.&#8221;</P>
<P>Hearing this, Monkey said to the duty god, the tears streaming down his face, &#8220;I'm too ashamed to go up to Heaven, and I haven't the nerve to go to the sea. I'm afraid of asking for the Bodhisattva's help and too miserable to look the Buddha in the face. The ones who were captured just now were the True Martial God's Tortoise, Snake and five dragons and their forces. There's nowhere else I can turn for help. What am I to do?&#8221;</P>
<P>The Duty God smiled as he replied, &#8220;Relax, Great Sage, I've thought of some elite troops who are bound to be able to subdue these demons. You went to Wudang just now that was in the Southern Jambu Continent. The troops I have in mind come from the same continent, from Bincheng on Mound Xuyi. It's what's now called Sizhou. There's a Great Sage Bodhisattva King Teacher there who has enormous magical powers. He has a disciple called Little Prince Zhang and four divine generals: the other year they subdued the Water Mother Goddess. You should go there yourself to ask him. If he in his kindness is willing to help you're bound to be able to catch the demon and save the master.&#8221;</P>
<P>The news delighted Monkey, who said, &#8220;You look after the master and don't let him come to any harm while I go off to ask his help.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey then set off on his somersault and left that demon-infested place to go straight to Mount Xuyi. He was soon there, and when he looked around he saw that it was a fine place.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Yangtse was not far to the South,</P>
<P>To the North it faced the Huai River.</P>
<P>To the East it led to the islands in the sea,</P>
<P>To the West it was connected with Fengfou.</P>
<P>On the mountain-top was a lofty temple</P>
<P>While springs gushed forth from its sides.</P>
<P>Grotesquely-shaped rocks towered high;</P>
<P>Lofty pines were elegantly angular.</P>
<P>There was always fresh fruit in season,</P>
<P>And every kind of flower opened in the sun.</P>
<P>People moved around like armies of ants</P>
<P>While boats came from far and wide like flights of geese.</P>
<P>On it there stood</P>
<P>The Auspicious Crag Temple,</P>
<P>The Palace of the Eastern Peak,</P>
<P>The Shrine of the Five Illustrious Ones,</P>
<P>The Tortoise Mountain Monastery.</P>
<P>Rhythmic bells and incense smoke rose to the heavens.</P>
<P>There were also</P>
<P>The Crystal Spring,</P>
<P>The Valley of Five Stupas,</P>
<P>The Terrace of Eight Immortals,</P>
<P>The Apricot Orchard.</P>
<P>The colours of the mountain and trees lit up Bincheng.</P>
<P>Boundless were the stretches of cloud,</P>
<P>While hidden birds still sang when they were tired.</P>
<P>Never mind mounts Tai, Song, Heng or Hua;</P>
<P>Here was the beauty of an earthly paradise.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Great Sage enjoyed the view enormously as he crossed the Huai River, entered the city of Bincheng, and arrived at the gates of the Great Sage's Dhyana Monastery. Over the majestic halls and colorful cloisters there towered a pagoda. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>It rose ten thousand feet through clouds to the sky;</P>
<P>The golden vase penetrated the heavens above.</P>
<P>The light from it filled the universe;</P>
<P>No shadows were cast on its windows.</P>
<P>Heavenly music was heard when the wind rang the bells;</P>
<P>The sun shone on roof-dragons facing the Buddha-hall.</P>
<P>Birds constantly came here to sing their complaints;</P>
<P>Endlessly beautiful was the view of the Huai River.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey looked at it all as he went in to the inner gates, where the Bodhisattva King Teacher, who was expecting him, had come out to meet him with Little Prince Zhang. After they had greeted each other and exchanged polite remarks Monkey said, &#8220;I'm escorting the Tang Priest to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven. We have come to the Lesser Thunder Monastery where there's a Yellow-browed Demon who's pretending to be a Buddha. Not realizing he was an impostor, my master kowtowed to him and was captured. Then I was caught inside a pair of golden cymbals until, thank goodness, the constellations who had been sent down from heaven rescued me. I smashed the cymbals, but when we fought him again he wrapped the heavenly gods, the protectors, the guardians, my master and my fellow-disciples up in a cloth bag. As I have nowhere else to turn, Bodhisattva, I've come to call on you and ask you to give play to your great strength. Use the magic powers with which you put down the Water Mother and saved the common people to go with me to rescue my master. Then he can take the scriptures back to China to be transmitted forever, praise the wisdom of our Buddha and make the prajna-paramita better known.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What you ask today is indeed for the greater glory of our Buddha,&#8221; said King Teacher, &#8220;and I really ought to go myself. But it's early summer now, just the time when the Huai River floods. The Great Sage Water Ape I subdued recently gets active when there's water, and I'm worried that he'd take advantage of my absence to make so much trouble that no divine powers could bring him back under control. I'll send my disciple with four generals to help you force the demon into submission.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey thanked him then headed back by cloud with the four generals and Little Prince Zhang to the Lesser Western Heaven, where they went straight to the Lesser Thunder Monastery. Here Little Prince Zhang brandished his paper-white spear and the four generals swung their superb swords as they shouted abuse to challenge the demons to battle.</P>
<P>When the little devils ran inside to report this, the demon king led his devils out once more, had his drums beaten and replied, &#8220;Who've you persuaded to come this time?&#8221;</P>
<P>Before the words were all out of his mouth Little Prince Zhang at the head of the four generals shouted, &#8220;Damned evil spirit! Do you have no eyes in your head? Don't you recognize who we are?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Whose underlings are you?&#8221; the demon king said. &#8220;How dare you help him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am the disciple of the Great Sage of Sizhou, the Bodhisattva King Teacher, and I'm here on his orders with four divine generals to capture you,&#8221; the prince replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;What sort of martial arts do you have,&#8221; replied the demon king with a sneer, &#8220;that give you the nerve to be so insulting?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;As you want to know about my martial powers,&#8221; the prince replied, &#8220;let me tell you:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>My people come from the Flowing Sands River,</P>
<P>Where my father used to be king of Sandland.</P>
<P>I was a weak and sickly child,</P>
<P>Born under a bad influence and an unlucky star.</P>
<P>Long had I admired my master's immortal powers,</P>
<P>When in a chance meeting he taught me the secret.</P>
<P>Half a pill of elixir cured my sickness;</P>
<P>I abandoned my throne to cultivate my conduct.</P>
<P>Once I knew bow to live as long as heaven;</P>
<P>My face became youthful and will remain so forever.</P>
<P>I have been to the assemblies under the dragon-flower tree,</P>
<P>And ridden by cloud to the Buddha's hall.</P>
<P>Seizing the fogs and winds I subdued the watery tribe;</P>
<P>I defended the mountain by subduing dragons and tigers.</P>
<P>The dutiful people raised a lofty pagoda</P>
<P>To calm the seas through the glow of its relics.</P>
<P>My paper-white spear can capture all demons;</P>
<P>Evil spirits are caught in the gray sleeve of my coat.</P>
<P>Now peace and joy reign in the city of Bincheng,</P>
<P>And all the world praises Little Zhang's fame.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the demon king heard this he replied with a touch of a mocking smile, &#8220;Prince, when you abandoned your throne to follow the Bodhisattva King Teacher what sort of arts of immortality did you learn? All you're good for is capturing water monsters in the Huai River. You shouldn't have believed all the nonsense Sun the Novice talked and have come across all those mountains and rivers to offer your life. We'll soon find out whether you're immortal or not.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Little Zhang heard this he was very angry and thrust straight for the demon's face with his spear. The four generals all rushed into the attack together and so did the Great Sage Monkey, wielding his iron cudgel. The splendid evil spirit was not afraid in the least as he blocked, parried and struck back with his short and flexible wolf-tooth mace. It was a fine battle:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The little prince with his paper-white spear,</P>
<P>Made stronger by the four generals' swords,</P>
<P>Wukong using his gold-banded cudgel,</P>
<P>With one heart they surrounded the demon king.</P>
<P>Truly his magical powers were great</P>
<P>As without a trace of fear he resisted their attacks.</P>
<P>The wolf-tooth mace was a Buddha weapon</P>
<P>Preserving him from wounds by swords or spear.</P>
<P>Wile howled the wind</P>
<P>Through the turbid swirl of evil vapors.</P>
<P>One used his skill for love of mortal things;</P>
<P>The other's heart was set on the Buddha and the scriptures.</P>
<P>They charged and they raged,</P>
<P>Shrouding sun, moon and stars in cloud,</P>
<P>Each of them evil and vicious in anger.</P>
<P>For long the Three Vehicles could not assert dominance:</P>
<P>Bitter and well-matched was the battle of rival skills.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After the fight had been going on for a long time and was still inconclusive the evil spirit undid his pouch and Monkey once more shouted, &#8220;Look out, gentlemen.&#8221; The prince and his followers did not realize what he was telling them to look out for, so with a swish the demon king had them caught in his pouch. Only Monkey escaped in time. We will not describe how once more the demon king returned in triumph, sent for ropes, and had them tied up and put into the pit under lock and lid.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Monkey leapt up into the sky and saw the demon leading his troops back and fastening the gates he brought his auspicious light down to land and stood on the Western slope of the mountain. &#8220;Master!&#8221; he wept aloud in his misery,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Since being converted and becoming a monk</P>
<P>I've been grateful to Guanyin for ending my woes.</P>
<P>In escorting you West to seek the great Way</P>
<P>I have helped you towards the Buddha's own temple.</P>
<P>Who would have thought when the going looked easy</P>
<P>That we'd be attacked by so mighty a monster.</P>
<P>None of my tricks or devices succeed;</P>
<P>All the help I have looked for has just been in vain.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As Monkey was in the very depths of misery a brightly-coloured cloud suddenly landed to the Southwest and the whole mountain peak was lashed with a torrential rainstorm. &#8220;Wukong,&#8221; a voice called, &#8220;do you know who I am?&#8221; Monkey hurried forward to look and this is what he saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Big ears, a broad jaw and a square face;</P>
<P>Wide shoulders, a deep chest and a fat body.</P>
<P>A jolly voice that was full of fun,</P>
<P>A pair of bright and sparkling eyes.</P>
<P>His clothes hung open; luck was all about him.</P>
<P>His straw sandals were comfortable and his spirits high.</P>
<P>He was the lord of the land of bliss,</P>
<P>The laughing monk Maitreya.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As soon as Monkey saw him he kowtowed immediately and said, &#8220;Where are you going, Lord Buddha from the East? I beg you to forgive me for failing to keep out of your way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm here because of the demon in the Lesser Thunder Monastery,&#8221; the Buddha replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;I am very grateful for your great kindness, my lord,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;May I ask where the demon is from and where he became an evil spirit? What sort of treasure is that pouch of his? Please tell me, my lord.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He was a yellow-browed page who used to strike my stone chime,&#8221; the Buddha Maitreya replied. &#8220;On the third day of the third month this year I left him looking after my palace when I went to an assembly of the Primal One. That was when he stole some of my treasures and became a spirit as an imitation Buddha. That pouch is my future heaven bag, or what's generally called a human seed bag. The wolf-tooth cudgel was originally the stick for striking the chime.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he shouted, &#8220;You're a splendid laughing monk, I must say. By letting that boy escape you let him masquerade as a Buddha and ruin things for me. You ought to be charged with slack management of your household.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I was careless,&#8221; Maitreya replied. &#8220;Besides, your master and you disciples have not yet come to the end of the demons you will have to deal with. That is why every kind of spiritual creature has been coming down to earth. It's right that you should suffer. Now I'm here to capture him for you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That evil spirit has very great magic powers,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;and you haven't got any weapons. How can you possibly subdue him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'll make a little hut under the mountain,&#8221; said Maitreya, &#8220;where I grow fruit and melons. You challenge him to battle, lose in the fight that follows, and lure him into my melon patch. All my melons are still unripe, so you're to change into a big ripe melon. When he gets there he's bound to want a melon and I'll give you to him. Once you're in his stomach you can do what you like to him. Then I'll get his pouch and we can put him inside it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's a very good plan,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;but how will you know which is the ripe melon I'll have turned into? And why should he be willing to go there after me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm the ruler of the world,&#8221; laughed Maitreya, &#8220;and I have miraculous vision. Of course I'll know which one is you. I'd recognize you whatever you turned into. The only worry is that the demon won't come after you. I'll have to teach you some new magic.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But he's bound to catch me in his pouch,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;not come after me. What magic power could I use?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stretch your hand out,&#8221; Maitreya said. Monkey stretched out his left hand. Maitreya moistened the forefinger of his own right hand with some magic saliva, wrote &#8220;stop&#8221; on it, and told Monkey to make a fist. If he opened that hand again in the demon's face the demon would certainly come after him.</P>
<P>Monkey cheerfully made the fist as he had been instructed and went back to the monastery gates, brandishing his cudgel with one hand as he shouted, &#8220;Evil spirit, your lord and master Monkey's here. Come out at once and we'll see who's the champion.&#8221; When the little devils rushed inside to report the demon king asked how many soldiers Monkey had brought with him this time.</P>
<P>&#8220;None,&#8221; they replied. &#8220;He's here by himself.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That Monkey's at his wit's end and exhausted,&#8221; the demon king laughed, &#8220;and he can't get anyone else to help. He's just throwing his life away now.&#8221; Once he was in his armor again he took his treasure and his flexible wolf-tooth mace and went out through the monastery gates shouting, &#8220;You won't be able to hold out this time, Sun Wukong.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Damned demon,&#8221; Monkey replied abusively. &#8220;What do you mean, I won't be able to hold out?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Look at you,&#8221; the demon replied. &#8220;You're at your wit's end and exhausted. There's nobody else you can turn to for help. Now you're here again to try to resist me there won't be any more divine soldiers or anything like that to help you. That's why I said you wouldn't be able to hold out.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Fiend,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you don't even know whether you want to live or to die. Stop all that talk and take this!&#8221;</P>
<P>Seeing that Monkey was wielding his cudgel single-handed, the demon burst out laughing: &#8220;What a clever little ape! Do you think you'll be able to hold me off by using your cudgel one-handed?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My dear boy,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;if I used both hands it would be too much for you. Even with four or five hands you wouldn't be able to beat me even if I had one hand tied behind my back. That is, as long as you didn't use that pouch of yours.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well then,&#8221; the demon king replied, &#8220;I won't use my treasure. I'll give you a straight fight and we'll see who's the best man.&#8221; With that he raised his wolf-tooth mace and attacked Monkey, who opened his clenched fist in the demon's face before wielding the cudgel in both hands. Once the demon was under the spell he put all thought of retreat out of his mind and indeed did not use his pouch, but went for Monkey with his mace. Monkey feinted then turned and fled in defeat, pursued by the evil spirit down the Western slopes of the mountain.</P>
<P>As soon as he saw the melon field Monkey rolled himself into a ball to go into it and turn himself into a big, ripe, sweet watermelon. The evil spirit stopped to look all around, not knowing where Monkey had gone.</P>
<P>He rushed over to the hut and asked, &#8220;Who's growing these melons?&#8221;</P>
<P>Maitreya, who had turned himself into an old melon grower, came out of the thatched hut and said, &#8220;I am, Your Majesty.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Have you got any ripe ones?&#8221; the demon king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Maitreya replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Pick me a ripe one then,&#8221; said the demon. &#8220;I'm thirsty.&#8221;</P>
<P>Maitreya then picked the melon that was Monkey transformed and handed it to the demon king respectfully with both hands. The demon king did not stop to examine it, but took it and bit into it. This was Monkey's chance to go straight down the demon's throat. Without any more ado he started hitting out and kicking, grabbing and clawing at the monster's entrails and stomach, turning somersaults, standing on his head, and doing just as he liked. The evil spirit ground his teeth and grimaced in agony, the tears flowing down his face, as he rolled around the melon field till it looked like a threshing floor.</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop, stop!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Save me, save me.&#8221;</P>
<P>Maitreya then reverted to his true form and said with a jolly smile, &#8220;Evil beast, do you recognize me?&#8221;</P>
<P>When the evil spirit looked up he fell to his knees on the ground, rubbing his stomach with both hands and kowtowing as he said, &#8220;Spare me,. master, spare me. I'll never do it again.&#8221;</P>
<P>Maitreya then stepped forward, seized him with one hand, undid the future heaven pouch, took back the stick for beating the stone chime, and said, &#8220;Sun Wukong, spare his life for my sake.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey, who was still beside himself with loathing and hatred, went on punching, kicking, and making havoc in the demon's insides until the demon collapsed in unbearable agony.</P>
<P>&#8220;He's had all he can take, Wukong,&#8221; Maitreya said. &#8220;Spare him now.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Open your mouth wide,&#8221; Sun Wukong finally said, &#8220;and let me out.&#8221; Although the demon's insides had been tied up into agonizing knots his heart had not yet been damaged, and as the saying goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Until the heart is damaged nobody dies;</P>
<P>Leaves only fall when the trunk's sap dries.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As soon as he was told to open his mouth wide he did so, in spite of the pain. Only then did Monkey jump out and turn back into himself. He at once seized his cudgel and was about to strike again, but the Buddha Maitreya had already put the evil spirit into the pouch and slung it at his waist. Holding the chime-stick in his hand Maitreya said, &#8220;Evil beast, where are the golden cymbals you stole?&#8221;</P>
<P>The monster, who was desperate to live, could be heard mumbling inside the future heaven bag, &#8220;Sun Wukong smashed them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If they're broken give me my gold back,&#8221; said Maitreya.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's piled up on the lotus throne in the main hall,&#8221; the monster replied.</P>
<P>Holding the bag in one hand and the stick in the other the Buddha laughed as he said, &#8220;Wukong, you and I are going to get my gold back.&#8221; After the display of such dharma power Sun Wukong dared not be at all remiss, but took the master back up the mountain and into the monastery, where they gathered all the pieces of gold.</P>
<P>Although the monastery gates were firmly shut one push with the stick was enough to open them wide, and when they looked inside they saw that all the little devils had taken the monastery's wealth and were now fleeing in all directions. When Monkey found one he killed one; when he found two he killed two; and so on until he had killed all the six or seven hundred little devils, who resumed their real forms as mountain spirits, tree monsters, evil beasts and animal demons.</P>
<P>The Buddha gathered all the pieces of gold together, blew on them with magic breath, and said the words of a spell. At once they were the two golden cymbals again. He then took his leave of Monkey and headed straight back to his paradise by auspicious cloud. The Great Sage then released the Tang Priest, Pig and Friar Sand.</P>
<P>After being hung up there for several days the idiot was desperately hungry. Without waiting to thank Monkey he ran straight to the kitchen, his back bent, to find some food. As it happened the demon had sent for his lunch but not had time to eat it when Monkey challenged him to battle. The moment he saw it Pig ate half a saucepan of rice before fetching a pair of bowls for the master and Friar Sand each to eat two bowlfuls. Only then did he thank Monkey and ask about the evil spirit.</P>
<P>Monkey told him all about how he had asked the help of King Teacher, Tortoise and Snake, then borrowed the prince from the True Lord, and about how Maitreya had subdued the demon. When Sanzang heard this he expressed his gratitude at great length and kowtowed to all the heavens. &#8220;Disciple,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;where are all the gods imprisoned?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The Duty God of the Day told me yesterday that they were all in the pit,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Pig,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;you and I are going to rescue them.&#8221;</P>
<P>Now that he had eaten, the idiot was full of strength and energy again as he found his rake and went with Monkey to open up the pit, untie the prisoners, and ask them to come out to under the tower. Sanzang, who had now put his cassock back on, bowed to each of them in thanks, after which the Great Sage saw the five dragons and two generals off on their way back to Wudang, Little Prince Zhang and the four generals on their way to Bincheng, and the Twenty-eight Constellations on their way back to the palaces of Heaven. He also released the Protectors and Guardians so that each could return to his own territory.</P>
<P>Master and disciples stayed on in the monastery to rest for a few hours. Then, after the horse had eaten its fill and the luggage all been packed, they set out again the next morning. Before leaving they burnt the towers, thrones, halls and preaching chambers to ashes. Thus it was that</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Without any cares from their troubles they flee,</P>
<P>From disasters and obstacles finally free.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know when they reached the Great Thunder Monastery, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>诸神遭毒手</p>
<p>弥勒缚妖魔</p>
</div>
<p>话表孙大圣无计可施，纵一朵祥云，驾筋斗，径转南赡部洲去拜武当山，参请荡魔天尊，解释三藏、八戒、沙僧、天兵等众之灾。他在半空里无停止，不一日，早望见祖师仙境，轻轻按落云头，定睛观看，好去处：巨镇东南，中天神岳。芙蓉峰竦杰，紫盖岭巍峨。九江水尽荆扬远，百越山连翼轸多。上有太虚之宝洞，朱陆之灵台。三十六宫金磬响，百千万客进香来。舜巡禹祷，玉简金书。楼阁飞青鸟，幢幡摆赤裾。地设名山雄宇宙，天开仙境透空虚。几树榔梅花正放，满山瑶草色皆舒。龙潜涧底，虎伏崖中。幽含如诉语，驯鹿近人行。白鹤伴云栖老桧，青鸾丹凤向阳鸣。玉虚师相真仙地，金阙仁慈治世门。上帝祖师，乃净乐国王与善胜皇后梦吞日光，觉而有孕，怀胎一十四个月，于开皇元年甲辰之岁三月初一日午时降诞于王宫。那爷爷；幼而勇猛，长而神灵。不统王位，惟务修行。父母难禁，弃舍皇宫。参玄入定，在此山中。功完行满，白日飞升。玉皇敕号，真武之名。玄虚上应，龟蛇合形。周天六合，皆称万灵。无幽不察，无显不成。劫终劫始，剪伐魔精。</p>

<p>孙大圣玩着仙境景致，早来到一天门、二天门、三天门，却至太和宫外，忽见那祥光瑞气之间，簇拥着五百灵官。那灵官上前迎着道：“那来的是谁？”大圣道：“我乃齐天大圣孙悟空，要见师相。”众灵官听说，随报。祖师即下殿，迎到太和宫。行者作礼道：“我有一事奉劳。”问：“何事？”行者道：“保唐僧西天取经，路遭险难。至西牛贺洲，有座山唤小西天，小雷音寺有一妖魔。我师父进得山门，见有阿罗揭谛，比丘圣僧排列，以为真佛，倒身才拜，忽被他拿住绑了。我又失于防闲，被他抛一副金铙，将我罩在里面，无纤毫之缝，口合如钳。甚亏金头揭谛请奏玉帝，钦差二十八宿，当夜下界，掀揭不起。幸得亢金龙将角透入铙内，将我度出，被我打碎金铙，惊醒怪物。赶战之间，又被撒一个白布搭包儿，将我与二十八宿并五方揭谛，尽皆装去，复用绳捆了。是我当夜脱逃，救了星辰等众与我唐僧等。后为找寻衣钵，又惊醒那妖，与天兵赶战。那怪又拿出搭包儿，理弄之时，我却知道前音，遂走了，众等被他依然装去。我无计可施，特来拜求师相一助力也。”祖师道：“我当年威镇北方，统摄真武之位，剪伐天下妖邪，乃奉玉帝敕旨。后又披发跣足，踏腾蛇神龟，领五雷神将、巨虬狮子、猛兽毒龙，收降东北方黑气妖氛，乃奉元始天尊符召。今日静享武当山，安逸太和殿，一向海岳平宁，乾坤清泰。奈何我南赡部洲并北俱芦洲之地，妖魔剪伐，邪鬼潜踪。今蒙大圣下降，不得不行；只是上界无有旨意，不敢擅动干戈。假若法遣众神，又恐玉帝见罪，十分却了大圣，又是我逆了人情。我谅着那西路上纵有妖邪，也不为大害。我今着龟、蛇二将并五大神龙与你助力，管教擒妖精，救你师之难。”行者拜谢了祖师，即同龟、蛇、龙神各带精锐之兵，复转西洲之界。不一日，到了小雷音寺，按下云头，径至山门外叫战。</p>

<p>却说那黄眉大王聚众怪在宝阁下说：“孙行者这两日不来，又不知往何方去借兵也。”说不了，只见前门上小妖报道：</p>

<p>“行者引几个龙蛇龟相，在门外叫战！”妖魔道：“这猴儿怎么得个龙蛇龟相？此等之类，却是何方来者？”随即披挂，走出山门高叫：“汝等是那路龙神，敢来造吾仙境？”五龙二将相貌峥嵘，精神抖擞喝道：“那泼怪！我乃武当山太和宫混元教主荡魔天尊之前五位龙神、龟、蛇二将。今蒙齐天大圣相邀，我天尊符召，到此捕你这妖精，快送唐僧与天星等出来，免你一死！不然，将这一山之怪，碎劈其尸；几间之房，烧为灰烬！”那怪闻言，心中大怒道：“这畜生有何法力，敢出大言！不要走！吃吾一棒！”这五条龙，翻云使雨，那两员将，播土扬沙，各执枪刀剑戟，一拥而攻，孙大圣又使铁棒随后。这一场好杀：凶魔施武，行者求兵。凶魔施武，擅据珍楼施佛象；行者求兵，远参宝境借龙神。龟蛇生水火，妖怪动刀兵。五龙奉旨来西路，行者因师在后收。剑戟光明摇彩电，枪刀晃亮闪霓虹。这个狼牙棒，强能短软；那个金箍棒，随意如心。只听得扢扑响声如爆竹，叮当音韵似敲金。水火齐来征怪物，刀兵共簇绕精灵。喊杀惊狼虎，喧哗振鬼神。浑战正当无胜处，妖魔又取宝和珍。行者帅五龙二将，与妖魔战经半个时辰，那妖精即解下搭包在手。行者见了心惊，叫道：“列位仔细！”那龙神蛇龟不知甚么仔细，一个个都停住兵，近前抵挡。那妖精幌的一声，把搭包儿撇将起去。孙大圣顾不得五龙二将，驾筋斗，跳在九霄逃脱。他把个龙神龟蛇一搭包子又装将去了。妖精得胜回寺，也将绳捆了，抬在地窖子里盖住不题。</p>

<p>你看那大圣落下云头，斜敧在山巅之上，没精没采，懊恨道：“这怪物十分利害！”不觉的合着眼，似睡一般，猛听得有人叫道：“大圣，休推睡，快早上紧求救。你师父性命，只在须臾间矣！”行者急睁睛跳起来看，原来是日值功曹。行者喝道：“你这毛神，这向在那方贪图血食，不来点卯，今日却来惊我！伸过孤拐来，让老孙打两棒解闷！”功曹慌忙施礼道：“大圣，你是人间之喜仙，何闷之有！我等早奉菩萨旨令，教我等暗中护佑唐僧，乃同土地等神，不敢暂离左右，是以不得常来参见，怎么反见责也？”行者道：“你既是保护，如今那众星、揭谛、伽蓝并我师等，被妖精困在何方？受甚罪苦？”功曹道：“你师父师弟都吊在宝殿廊下，星辰等众都收在地窖之间受罪。这两日不闻大圣消息，却才见妖精又拿了神龙、龟、蛇，又送在地窖里去了，方知是大圣请来之兵，小神特来寻大圣。大圣莫辞劳倦，千万再急急去求救援。”行者闻言及此，不觉对功曹滴泪道：“我如今愧上天宫，羞临海藏！怕问菩萨之原由，愁见如来之玉象！才拿去者，乃真武师相之龟、蛇、五龙圣众。教我再无方求救，奈何？”功曹笑道：“大圣宽怀，小神想起一处精兵，请来断然可降。适才大圣至武当，是南赡部洲之地。这枝兵也在南赡部洲盱眙山蠙城，即今泗洲是也。那里有个大圣国师王菩萨，神通广大。他手下有一个徒弟，唤名小张太子，还有四大神将，昔年曾降伏水母娘娘。你今若去请他，他来施恩相助，准可捉怪救师也。”行者心喜道：“你且去保护我师父，勿令伤他，待老孙去请也。”</p>

<p>行者纵起筋斗云，躲离怪处，直奔盱眙山。不一日早到，细观真好去处：南近江津，北临淮水。东通海峤，西接封浮。山顶上有楼观峥嵘，山凹里有涧泉浩涌。嵯峨怪石，槃秀乔松。百般果品应时新，千样花枝迎日放。人如蚁阵往来多，船似雁行归去广。上边有瑞岩观、东岳宫、五显祠、龟山寺，钟韵香烟冲碧汉；又有玻璃泉、五塔峪、八仙台、杏花园，山光树色映蠙城。</p>

<p>白云横不度，幽鸟倦还鸣。说甚泰嵩衡华秀，此间仙景若蓬瀛。</p>

<p>大圣点玩不尽，径过了淮河，入蠙城之内，到大圣禅寺山门外，又见那殿宇轩昂，长廊彩丽，有一座宝塔峥嵘。真是：插云倚汉高千丈，仰视金瓶透碧空。上下有光凝宇宙，东西无影映帘栊。</p>

<p>风吹宝铎闻天乐，日映冰虬对梵宫。飞宿灵禽时诉语，遥瞻淮水渺无穷。</p>

<p>行者且观且走，直至二层门下。那国师王菩萨早已知之，即与小张太子出门迎迓。相见叙礼毕，行者道：“我保唐僧西天取经，路上有个小雷音寺，那里有个黄眉怪，假充佛祖。我师父不辨真伪就下拜，被他拿了。又将金铙把我罩了，幸亏天降星辰救出。是我打碎金铙，与他赌斗，又将一个布搭包儿，把天神、揭谛、伽蓝与我师父、师弟尽皆装了进去。我前去武当山请玄天上帝救援，他差五龙龟蛇拿怪，又被他一搭包子装去。弟子无依无倚，故来拜请菩萨，大展威力，将那收水母之神通，拯生民之妙用，同弟子去救师父一难！取得经回，永传中国，扬我佛之智慧，兴般若之波罗也。”国师王道：“你今日之事，诚我佛教之兴隆，理当亲去，奈时值初夏，正淮水泛涨之时，新收了水猿大圣，那厮遇水即兴，恐我去后，他乘空生顽，无神可治。今着小徒领四将和你去助力，炼魔收伏罢。”行者称谢，即同四将并小张太子，又驾云回小西天，直至小雷音寺。小张太子使一条楮白枪，四大将轮四把锟鋘剑，和孙大圣上前骂战。小妖又去报知，那妖王复帅群妖，鼓噪而出道：“猢狲！你今又请得何人来也？”说不了，小张太子指挥四将上前喝道：“泼妖精！你面上无肉，不认得我等在此！”妖王道：“是那方小将，敢来与他助力？”太子道：“吾乃泗州大圣国师王菩萨弟子，帅领四大神将，奉令擒你！”妖王笑道：“你这孩儿有甚武艺，擅敢到此轻薄？”</p>

<p>太子道：“你要知我武艺，等我道来：祖居西土流沙国，我父原为沙国王。自幼一身多疾苦，命干华盖恶星妨。因师远慕长生诀，有分相逢舍药方。半粒丹砂祛病退，愿从修行不为王。学成不老同天寿，容颜永似少年郎。也曾赶赴龙华会，也曾腾云到佛堂。捉雾拿风收水怪，擒龙伏虎镇山场。抚民高立浮屠塔，静海深明舍利光。楮白枪尖能缚怪，淡缁衣袖把妖降。如今静乐蠙城内，大地扬名说小张！”妖王听说，微微冷笑道：“那太子，你舍了国家，从那国师王菩萨，修的是甚么长生不老之术？</p>

<p>只好收捕淮河水怪，却怎么听信孙行者诳谬之言，千山万水，来此纳命！看你可长生可不老也！”小张闻言，心中大怒，缠枪当面便刺，四大将一拥齐攻，孙大圣使铁棒上前又打。好妖精，公然不惧，轮着他那短软狼牙棒，左遮右架，直挺横冲。这场好杀：小太子，楮白枪，四柄锟鋘剑更强。悟空又使金箍棒，齐心围绕杀妖王。妖王其实神通大，不惧分毫左右搪。狼牙棒是佛中宝，剑砍枪轮莫可伤。只听狂风声吼吼，又观恶气混茫茫。那个有意思凡弄本事，这个专心拜佛取经章。几番驰骋，数次张狂。喷云雾，闭三光，奋怒怀嗔各不良。多时三乘无上法，致令百艺苦相将。概众争战多时，不分胜负，那妖精又解搭包儿。行者又叫：“列位仔细！”太子并众等不知“仔细”之意。那怪滑的一声，把四大将与太子，一搭包又装将进去，只是行者预先知觉走了，那妖王得胜回寺，又教取绳捆了，送在地窖，牢封固锁不题。</p>

<p>这行者纵筋斗云，起在空中，见那怪回兵闭门，方才按下祥光，立于西山坡上，怅望悲啼道：“师父啊！我自从秉教入禅林，感荷菩萨脱难深。保你西来求大道，相同辅助上雷音。只言平坦羊肠路，岂料崔巍怪物侵。百计千方难救你，东求西告枉劳心！”大圣正当凄惨之时，忽见那西南上一朵彩云坠地，满山头大雨缤纷，有人叫道：“悟空，认得我么？”行者急走前看处，那个人：大耳横颐方面相，肩查腹满身躯胖。一腔春意喜盈盈，两眼秋波光荡荡。敞袖飘然福气多，芒鞋洒落精神壮。极乐场中第一尊，南无弥勒笑和尚。行者见了，连忙下拜道：“东来佛祖那里去？弟子失回避了，万罪！万罪！”佛祖道：“我此来，专为这小雷音妖怪也。”行者道：“多蒙老爷盛德大恩。敢问那妖是那方怪物，何处精魔，不知他那搭包儿是件甚么宝贝，烦老爷指示指示。”佛祖道：“他是我面前司磬的一个黄眉童儿。</p>

<p>三月三日，我因赴元始会去，留他在宫看守，他把我这几件宝贝拐来，假佛成精。那搭包儿是我的后天袋子，俗名唤做人种袋。那条狼牙棒是个敲磬的槌儿。”行者听说，高叫一声道：“好个笑和尚！你走了这童儿，教他诳称佛祖，陷害老孙，未免有个家法不谨之过！”弥勒道：“一则是我不谨，走失人口，二则是你师徒们魔障未完，故此百灵下界，应该受难。我今来与你收他去也。”行者道：“这妖精神通广大，你又无些兵器，何以收之？”</p>

<p>弥勒笑道：“我在这山坡下，设一草庵，种一田瓜果在此，你去与他索战。交战之时，许败不许胜，引他到我这瓜田里。我别的瓜都是生的，你却变做一个大熟瓜。他来定要瓜吃，我却将你与他吃。吃下肚中，任你怎么在内摆布他，那时等我取了他的搭包儿，装他回去。”行者道：“此计虽妙，你却怎么认得变的熟瓜？他怎么就肯跟我来此？”弥勒笑道：“我为治世之尊，慧眼高明，岂不认得你！凭你变作甚物，我皆知之，但恐那怪不肯跟来耳。我却教你一个法术。”行者道：“他断然是以搭包儿装我，怎肯跟来！有何法术可来也？”弥勒笑道：“你伸手来。”行者即舒左手递将过去，弥勒将右手食指蘸着口中神水，在行者掌上写了一个禁字，教他捏着拳头，见妖精当面放手，他就跟来。</p>

<p>行者揝拳，欣然领教，一只手轮着铁棒，直至山门外，高叫道：“妖魔，你孙爷爷又来了！可快出来，与你见个上下！”小妖又忙忙奔告，妖王问道：“他又领多少兵来叫战？”小妖道：“别无甚兵，止他一个。”妖王笑道：“那猴儿计穷力竭，无处求人，断然是送命来也。”随又结束整齐，带了宝贝，举着那轻软狼牙棒，走出站来叫道：“孙悟空，今番挣挫不得了！”行者骂道：“泼怪物！我怎么挣挫不得？”妖王道：“我见你计穷力竭，无处求人，独自个强来支持，如今拿住，再没个甚么神兵救拔，此所以说你挣挫不得也。”行者道：“这怪不知死活！莫说嘴！吃吾一棒！”那妖王见他一只手轮棒，忍不住笑道：“这猴儿，你看他弄巧！怎么一只手使棒支吾？”行者道：“儿子！你禁不得我两只手打！若是不使搭包子，再着三五个，也打不过老孙这一只手！”妖王闻言道：“也罢！也罢！我如今不使宝贝，只与你实打，比个雌雄。”即举狼牙棒，上前来斗。孙行者迎着面，把拳头一放，双手轮棒。那妖精着了禁，不思退步，果然不弄搭包，只顾使棒来赶。行者虚幌一下，败阵就走，那妖精直赶到西山坡下。</p>

<p>行者见有瓜田，打个滚，钻入里面，即变做一个大熟瓜，又熟又甜。那妖精停身四望，不知行者那方去了，他却赶至庵边叫道：</p>

<p>“瓜是谁人种的？”弥勒变作一个种瓜叟，出草庵答道：“大王，瓜是小人种的。”妖王道：“可有熟瓜么？”弥勒道：“有熟的。”妖王叫：“摘个熟的来，我解渴。”弥勒即把行者变的那瓜，双手递与妖王。妖王更不察情，到此接过手，张口便啃。那行者乘此机会，一毂辘钻入咽喉之下，等不得好歹，就弄手脚抓肠蒯腹，翻根头，竖蜻蜓，任他在里面摆布。那妖精疼得傞牙倈嘴，眼泪汪汪，把一块种瓜之地，滚得似个打麦之场，口中只叫：“罢了！</p>

<p>罢了！谁人救我一救！”弥勒却现了本象，嘻嘻笑叫道：“孽畜！</p>

<p>认得我么？”那妖抬头看见，慌忙跪倒在地，双手揉着肚子，磕头撞脑，只叫：“主人公！饶我命罢！饶我命罢！再不敢了！”弥勒上前一把揪住，解了他的后天袋儿，夺了他的敲磬槌儿，叫：</p>

<p>“孙悟空，看我面上，饶他命罢。”行者十分恨苦，却又左一拳，右一脚，在里面乱掏乱捣。那怪万分疼痛难忍，倒在地下。弥勒又道：“悟空，他也彀了，你饶他罢。”行者才叫：“你张大口，等老孙出来。”那怪虽是肚腹绞痛，还未伤心。俗语云，人未伤心不得死，花残叶落是根枯。他听见叫张口，即便忍着疼，把口大张。行者方才跳出，现了本象，急掣棒还要打时，早被佛祖把妖精装在袋里，斜跨在腰间，手执着磬槌，骂道：“孽畜！金铙偷了那里去了？”那怪却只要怜生，在后天袋内哼哼喷喷的道：</p>

<p>“金铙是孙悟空打破了。”佛祖道：“铙破，还我金来。”那怪道：</p>

<p>“碎金堆在殿莲台上哩。”那佛祖提着袋子，执着磬槌，嘻嘻笑叫道：“悟空，我和你去寻金还我。”行者见此法力，怎敢违误，只得引佛上山，回至寺内，收取金碴。只见那山门紧闭，佛祖使槌一指，门开入里看时，那些小妖，已得知老妖被擒，各自收拾囊底，都要逃生四散。被行者见一个，打一个；见两个，打两个，把五七百个小妖尽皆打死，各现原身，都是些山精树怪，兽孽禽魔。佛祖将金收攒一处，吹口仙气，念声咒语，即时返本还原，复得金铙一副，别了行者，驾祥云径转极乐世界。</p>

<p>这大圣却才解下唐僧、八戒、沙僧。那呆子吊了几日，饿得慌了，且不谢大圣，却就虾着腰，跑到厨房寻饭吃。原来那怪正安排了午饭，因行者索战，还未得吃。这呆子看见，即吃了半锅，却拿出两钵头叫师父、师弟们各吃了两碗，然后才谢了行者。问及妖怪原由，行者把先请祖师龟、蛇，后请大圣借太子，并弥勒收降之事，细陈了一遍。三藏闻言，谢之不尽，顶礼了诸天，道：“徒弟，这些神圣，困于何所？”行者道：“昨日日值功曹对老孙说，都在地窖之内。”叫：“八戒，我与你去解脱他等。”</p>

<p>那呆子得食力壮，抖擞精神，寻着他的钉钯，即同大圣到后面，打开地窖，将众等解了绳，请出珍楼之下。三藏披了袈裟，朝上一一拜谢。这大圣才送五龙二将回武当，送小张太子与四将回蠙城，后送二十八宿归天府，发放揭谛伽蓝各回境。</p>

<p>师徒们却宽住了半日，喂饱了白马，收拾行囊，至次早登程。临行时，放上一把火，将那些珍楼、宝座、高阁、讲堂，俱尽烧为灰烬。这里才无挂无牵逃难去，消灾消障脱身行。毕竟不知几时才到大雷音，且听下回分解。</p>
