<P>The Girl Seeks the Male</P>
<P>The Primal Deity Guards the Way</P>
</div>
<P>The story tells how Pig leapt down the mountainside and found a narrow path. After following it for nearly two miles he came across two she-monsters drawing water from a well. How did he know that they both were monsters? Each of them had on her head an extremely unfashionable hair-style held up by bamboo slivers that stood one foot two or three inches high.</P>
<P>&#8220;Evil monsters,&#8221; Pig called, going up to them.</P>
<P>The two of them looked at each other and said. &#8220;What an outrageous monk. We don't know him and we've never had words with him. So why did he call us evil monsters?&#8221; In their fury the monsters raised the pole with which they were going to carry the water and struck at Pig's head.</P>
<P>After a few blows that he could not ward off as he was unarmed, the idiot rushed back up the mountain with his head covered by both hands shouting, &#8220;Brother! Go back! The monsters are vicious.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What's so vicious about them?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;There were two evil spirits drawing water from the well in the hollow,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;and they hit me three or four times with their carrying-pole just because I spoke to them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What did you call them?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Evil monsters,&#8221; Pig replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;You got off lightly then,&#8221; laughed Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm most obliged for your concern,&#8221; replied Pig. &#8220;My head has swollen up where they hit it, and you tell me I've got off lightly.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Soft words will get you anywhere on earth; act rough and you won't move a single step,&#8221; replied Monkey. &#8220;As they're local fiends from round here and we're monks from far away you'd have had to be a bit polite even if you'd had fists growing all over your body. Do you think they should have hit me instead of you? You were the one who called them evil monsters. Courtesy first!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I never realized,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;Living on human flesh in the mountains since childhood as you have,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;can you recognize two kinds of tree?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I don't know,&#8221; Pig said. &#8220;Which two trees?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The willow and the sandalwood,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;The willow has a very soft nature, so that craftsmen can carve it into holy images or make statues of the Tathagata out of it. It's gilded, painted, set with jewels, decorated with flowers, and many worshippers burn incense to it. It receives unbounded blessings. But the sandalwood is so hard that it's used as the pressing-beam in the oil-press with iron hoops round its head, and it's hit with iron hammers too. The only reason it suffers like this is because it's to hard.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You should have told me all this before,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;then I wouldn't have been beaten.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Now go back and find out the truth,&#8221; said Brother Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;But if I go there again they'll recognize me,&#8221; Pig replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Then turn into something else,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;But even if I do turn into something else, brother, how am I to question them?&#8221; asked Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;When you look different go up to them and bow to them,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;See how old they are. If they're about the same age as us call them 'Miss,' and if they're a lot older call them 'Lady.'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a terrible climb-down: why should we be treating them as our relations when they're strangers from this far away?&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;That's not treating them as relations,&#8221; replied Monkey. &#8220;Its just a way of getting the truth out of them. If they're the ones who've got our master we'll be able to act; and if it isn't them we won't lose any time before going to fight elsewhere.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;I'm going back.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid idiot tucked his rake in his belt, went down into the hollow, shook himself and turned into a far, dark-skinned monk. He swaggered as he went up to the monsters, chanted a loud &#8220;na-a-aw&#8221; of respect and said, &#8220;Respectful greetings, ladies.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This monk's much better,&#8221; the two monsters said with delight. &#8220;He expresses his respects and knows how to address us properly.&#8221; Then they asked him, &#8220;Where are you from, venerable elder?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;From somewhere,&#8221; Pig replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;And where are you going?&#8221; they asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Somewhere,&#8221; Pig replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;What's your name?&#8221; they asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;What it is,&#8221; Pig replied again.</P>
<P>&#8220;Better he may be,&#8221; the monsters said with a laugh, &#8220;but he won't tell us about himself. He just echoes our questions.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Ladies,&#8221; Pig asked, &#8220;why are you fetching water?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You wouldn't know, monk,&#8221; the demons replied with smiles. &#8220;Our lady brought a Tang Priest back to the cave last night and she wants to look after him well. As the water in our cave is none too clean she's sent us two to fetch some of this good water produced by the mating of the Yin and the Yang. She's laid on a vegetarian banquet as well for the Tang Priest; she's going to marry him this evening.&#8221;</P>
<P>As soon as he heard this the idiot rushed straight back up the mountain shouting. &#8220;Friar Sand, bring the luggage here at once. We're dividing it up.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why, brother?&#8221; Friar Sand asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;When we've divided it up you can go back to man-eating in the Flowing Sands River,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;I'll return to Gao Village to see my wife, Big Brother can play the sage on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit, and the white dragon can be a dragon in the ocean again. The master's getting married in this evil spirits cave. Let's all go and settle down.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're talking nonsense again, you idiot,&#8221; replied Brother Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;I bloody well am not,&#8221; Pig retorted. &#8220;Those two evil spirits who were carrying water said a moment ago that a vegetarian wedding feast is being laid on for the master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How can you say things like that when the evil spirits are holding the master prisoner in the cave and he's longing for us to go in and rescue him?&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;How can we rescue him?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;You two bring the horse and the luggage, while we go with the two she-monsters as our guides,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;When we reach the entrance we can act together.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot could only go with Monkey as he followed the two monsters for five or six miles deep into the mountains before suddenly disappearing. &#8220;So the master was captured by a devil in broad daylight,&#8221; exclaimed Pig with surprise.</P>
<P>&#8220;You've got good eyesight,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;How can you possibly tell what they really were?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Those two monsters were carrying the water along when suddenly they disappeared. They must be daytime devils.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I think they went into a cave,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Wait while I go to have a look.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage opened his fiery eyes with their golden pupils and scanned the whole mountain. He saw no movement, but did spot a ceremonial archway most intricately made with many flowers and colours, triple eaves and fourfold decorations in front of the cliff. Going closer with Pig and Friar Sand he saw four large words written on it:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>PITFALL MOUNTAIN: BOTTOMLESS CAVE</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brothers,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;here's the evil spirits' archway, but I still don't know where the entrance is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Can't be far,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;can't be far. Let's have a good look for it.&#8221; When they turned round to look they saw a great rock over three miles around at the foot of the mountain beneath the archway. In the middle of it was a hole the size of a water-vat, which had become very slippery by repeated climbing.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;that's where the evil spirits go in and out of their cave.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's very strange,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;To be frank with the two of you, I've captured quite a few evil spirits since I started escorting the Tang Priest, but I've never seen a cave palace like this one before. Pig, you go down first and find out how deep it is. Then I'll be able to go in and rescue the master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It'll be hard,&#8221; said Pig with a shake of his head, &#8220;very hard. I'm very clumsy. If I tripped and fell in it might take me two or three years to reach the bottom.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How deep is it then?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Look,&#8221; Pig replied, and as the Great Sage leant over the edge of the hole to take a careful look he saw to his astonishment that it was very deep indeed and must have measured over a hundred miles around.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's very, very deep, brother,&#8221; he turned round to say.</P>
<P>&#8220;Go back then,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;The master's beyond saving.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What a thing to say!&#8221; Monkey retorted. &#8220;'Have no thoughts of being lazy; put idleness out of your mind.' Put the luggage down, and tether the horse to one of the legs of the archway. You and Friar Sand must block the entrance with your rake and staff while I go inside to explore. If the master really is inside I'll drive the evil spirits out with my iron cudgel, and when they reach the entrance you mustn't let them out. We'll only be able to kill the evil spirits and rescue the master if we work together.&#8221; The other two accepted their orders.</P>
<P>Monkey sprang into the hole, and under his feet tea thousand coloured clouds appeared, while a thousand layers of auspicious mist shielded him. He was soon at the bottom, which was a very long way down. Inside all was bright; there was the same sunshine, winds, flowers, fruit and trees as in the world above.</P>
<P>&#8220;What a splendid place,&#8221; Monkey thought. &#8220;It reminds me of the Water Curtain Cave that Heaven gave me in the place where I was born. This is another cave paradise.&#8221; As he looked around he saw a gate-tower with double eaves around which grew many clumps of pine and bamboo. Inside were many buildings.</P>
<P>&#8220;This must be where the evil spirit lives,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;I'll go in and find out what's up. No, wait. If I go in like this she'll recognize me. I'd better transform myself.&#8221; With a shake and a hand-spell he turned himself into a fly and flew lightly up to land on the gate-tower and listen in. From here he saw the monster sitting at her ease in a thatched pavilion. She was dressed far more beautifully than she had been when they rescued her in the pine forest or when she had tried to catch Monkey in the monastery:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Her hair was piled in a crow-black coiffure;</P>
<P>She wore a green velvet waistcoat.</P>
<P>Her feet were a pair of curving golden lotuses;</P>
<P>Her fingers were as delicate as bamboo shoots in spring.</P>
<P>Her powdered face was like a silver dish,</P>
<P>And her red lips were as glossy as a cherry.</P>
<P>She was a regular beauty,</P>
<P>Even more lovely than the lady on the moon.</P>
<P>After capturing the pilgrim monk that morning</P>
<P>She was going to know the pleasure of sharing his bed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey said nothing as he listened out for what she might say. Before long the cherry of her lips parted as she said with great pleasure, &#8220;Lay on a vegetarian feast, my little ones, and quick. My darling Tang Priest and I are going to be man and wife afterwards.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So it's true,&#8221; thought Brother Monkey, grinning to himself. &#8220;I thought Pig was just joking. I'd better fly in and find the master. I wonder what state of mind he's in. If he's been led astray I'm leaving him here.&#8221; When he spread his wings and flew inside to look he saw the Tang Priest sitting in a corridor behind a trellis covered with opaque red paper below and left clear above.</P>
<P>Butting a hole through the trellis paper Monkey landed on the Tang Priest's bald head and called, &#8220;Master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Save me, disciple,&#8221; replied Sanzang, who recognized Monkey's voice.</P>
<P>&#8220;You're useless, Master,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;The evil spirit is laying on a feast, and when you've eaten it you two are getting married. I expect you'll have a son or a daughter to start another generation of monks and nuns. What have you got to be so upset about?&#8221;</P>
<P>When the venerable elder heard this he gnashed his teeth and said, &#8220;Disciple, in all the time since I left Chang'an, accepted you as my follower at the Double Boundary Mountain and started my journey West, when have I ever eaten meat or had any wicked ideas? Now the evil spirit has captured me she is insisting that I mate with her. If I lose my true masculine essence may I fall from the wheel of reincarnation and be fixed for ever behind the Dark Mountains, never to rise again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No need to swear any oaths,&#8221; said Monkey with a grin. &#8220;If you really want to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven I'll take you there.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I can't remember the way I came in,&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Never mind about forgetting,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;You won't get out of here as easily as you came in, which was from the top downwards. If I save you now you'll have to go from the bottom upwards. If you're very lucky you'll squeeze out through the entrance and get away. But if your luck's out you won't be able to squeeze through and sooner or later you'll die of suffocation.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is terrible,&#8221; said Sanzang, the tears pouring from his eyes. &#8220;What are we to do?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No problem,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;no problem. The evil spirit's getting some wine prepared for you. You'll have to drink a goblet of it whether you want to or not. But you must pour it out quickly so that it makes a lot of froth. Then I can turn myself into a tiny insect and fly under the bubbles. When she gulps me down into her belly I'll tear her heart and liver to shreds and rip her guts apart. Once I've killed her you'll be able to escape.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But that would be an inhuman thing to do, disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;If all you're interested in is being kind you're done for,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;The evil spirit's a murderess. What do you care so much about her for?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Oh well,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;never mind. But you will have to stay with me.&#8221; Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Great Sage Sun guarded Tang Sanzang well;</P>
<P>The pilgrim priest depended on the Handsome Monkey King.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Master and disciple had not even finished their discussion when the evil spirit, who had arranged everything, came in along the corridor, unlocked the doors and called, &#8220;Reverend sir.&#8221; The Tang Priest dared not reply. She addressed him again, and again he dared not reply. Why was that? He was thinking that</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Divine energy is dispersed by an open mouth;</P>
<P>Trouble starts when the tongue begins to move.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He was thinking with all his heart that if he obstinately refused to open his mouth she might turn vicious and murder him in an instant. Just when he was feeling confused, wondering which difficult alternative to choose and asking himself what to do, the evil spirit addressed him as &#8220;Reverend sir&#8221; for the third time.</P>
<P>The Tang Priest had no choice but to answer, &#8220;Here I am, madam.&#8221; For him to give this reply was to make all the flesh fall off him. Now everybody says that the Tang Priest is a sincere monk, so how could he reply to the she-devil when he was on his way to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven? What you would not realize is that this was a crisis in which his very survival was at stake, that he had absolutely no alternative; and although he went through the form of replying he was free of desire inside. But when the evil spirit heard his reply she pushed the door open, helped the Tang Priest to his feet, held his hand, stood with her side pressed against his and whispered in his ear. Just look at her as she lays on the charm and makes herself alluring in every possible way. She did not realize that Sanzang was full of revulsion.</P>
<P>&#8220;From the way she's making herself so seductive,&#8221; Monkey thought with a wry grin to himself, &#8220;I'm worried that she might get the master interested.&#8221; Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The monk in demon trouble met a pretty girl;</P>
<P>The she-devil's beauty was truly superb.</P>
<P>Her slender jade eyebrows were like two willow leaves;</P>
<P>Her round face was set off with peach blossom.</P>
<P>Embroidered shoes gave a sight of a pair of phoenixes;</P>
<P>Her crow-black hair was piled high at the temples.</P>
<P>As smiling she led the master by his hand</P>
<P>His cassock was tinged with orchid and musk.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Her arms around him, the she-devil took the master to a thatched pavilion and said, &#8220;Reverend sir, I've had a drink brought here to have with you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Lady,&#8221; said the Tang Priest, &#8220;as a monk I can take no impure food.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I know,&#8221; the evil spirit replied. &#8220;As the water in the cave isn't clean I've sent for some of the pure water from the mating of the Yin and the Yang up on the mountain, and had a banquet of fruit and vegetables prepared. After that you and I are going to have some fun.&#8221; When the Tang Priest went into the pavilion with her this is what could be seen:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>All within the gates</P>
<P>Was decked in silks and embroideries;</P>
<P>Throughout the hall</P>
<P>Incense rose from golden lion censers.</P>
<P>Black-painted inlaid tables were set in rows,</P>
<P>On which stood dark-lacquered bamboo dishes.</P>
<P>On the inlaid tables</P>
<P>Were all kinds of delicacies;</P>
<P>In the bamboo dishes</P>
<P>Were vegetarian delights:</P>
<P>Crab apples, olives, lotus seeds, grapes, torreya-nuts,</P>
<P>hazelnuts, pine-nuts, lichees, longans, chestnuts, water caltrops, jujubes, persimmons, walnuts, gingko nuts, kumquats and oranges.</P>
<P>There was the fruit that grows on every hill,</P>
<P>The fresh vegetables of each season;</P>
<P>Beancurd, wheat gluten, tree-ear fungus, fresh bamboo shoots, button mushrooms, gill fungus, yams, sealwort, agar, day lily fried in vegetable oil,</P>
<P>Hyacinth beans, cowpeas prepared with mature sauces.</P>
<P>Cucumbers, gourds, gingko, turnip greens.</P>
<P>Peeled aubergines were cooked like quails;</P>
<P>Seeded wax gourds</P>
<P>Taro stewed tender and sprinkled with sugar,</P>
<P>Turnips boiled in vinegar.</P>
<P>Pungent chili and ginger made it all delicious;</P>
<P>All the dishes were a balance of bland and salty.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Revealing the tips of her jade fingers she raised a dazzling golden goblet that she filled with fine wine. &#8220;Dearest reverend gentleman,&#8221; she said, handing it to him, &#8220;my darling, have a drink to celebrate our happy union.&#8221; Sanzang was covered with embarrassment as he took the wine.</P>
<P>He poured a libation into the air as he prayed silently, &#8220;Devas who guard the Dharma, Guardians of the Four Quarters and the Centre, Four Duty Gods: your disciple Chen Xuanzang has benefited from the secret protection of all you deities sent by the Bodhisattva Guanyin on my journey to pay my respects at the Thunder Monastery, see the Buddha and seek the scriptures. I have now been captured by an evil spirit on my way. She is forcing me to marry her and has now handed me this cup of wine to drink. If this really is pure wine I can force myself to drink it and still be able to succeed and see the Buddha. But if it is impure wine I will be breaking my vows and fall for ever into the bitterness of the wheel of rebirth.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Great Sage Sun made himself tiny and was like a secret informant behind his master's ear. When he spoke Sanzang was the only one who could hear him. Knowing that his master was normally fond of the pure wine of grapes he told him to drain the goblet. Sanzang had no choice but to do so, quickly refill the goblet and hand it back to the evil spirit. As he filled it bubbles of happiness formed on the surface of the wine. Brother Monkey turned himself into the tiniest of insects and flew lightly under the bubbles. But when the spirit took the goblet she put it down instead of drinking from it, bowed twice to the Tang Priest and spoke loving words to him with charming bashfulness. By the time she lifted the cup the bubbles had burst and the insect was revealed. Not realizing that it was Monkey transformed the evil spirit took it for a real insect, lifted it out with her little finger and flicked it away.</P>
<P>Seeing that as things were not going as he intended he would be unable to get into her belly Monkey turned himself into a hungry eagle.</P>
<P>Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Jade claws, gold eyes and iron wings;</P>
<P>In terrible might he rose above the clouds.</P>
<P>Cunning hares and foxes felt faint at just the sight,</P>
<P>And hid among mountains and rivers for hundred of miles around.</P>
<P>When hungry it chased small birds into the wind,</P>
<P>And rose to the gate of heaven when replete.</P>
<P>Murderous were its talons of steel;</P>
<P>In times of triumph it stayed aloof in the clouds.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey flew up, swung his jade claws, and noisily overturned the tables, smashing all the fruit, vegetables and crockery, and leaving the Tang Priest alone there as he flew off. This was so terrifying that the she-devil's heart and gall were split open, and the Tang Priest's flesh and bones were turned crisp. Shivering and shaking, the evil spirit threw her arms round the Tang Priest and said, &#8220;Dearest reverend gentleman, wherever did that come from?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I don't know,&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;I went to a great deal of trouble to arrange this vegetarian feast for you,&#8221; the she-devil said. &#8220;Goodness only knows where that feathered brute flew in from and smashed our crockery.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Smashing the crockery doesn't really matter,&#8221; the junior demons said, &#8220;but all the food has been spilt on the floor. It's too dirty to eat now.&#8221; Sanzang by now realized that this was all the result of Monkey's magic, but he dared not say so.</P>
<P>&#8220;Little ones,&#8221; said the she-devil, &#8220;I realize now. It must be heaven and earth that sent that thing down here because they can't tolerate my holding the Tang Priest prisoner. Clear all the broken dishes up and lay on another banquet. Never mind whether it's vegetarian or not. Heaven can be our matchmaker and the earth our guarantor. After that the Tang Priest and I will become man and wife.&#8221; We will say no more of her as she took the Tang Priest to sit in the East corridor.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Instead the story tells of how Monkey flew out, turned back into himself, reached the entrance to the cave and shouted, &#8220;Open up!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Friar Sand,&#8221; Pig shouted, &#8220;our big brother's here.&#8221; As the two of them drew their weapons away Monkey sprang out.</P>
<P>&#8220;Is there an evil spirit in there?&#8221; Pig asked, grabbing hold of him. &#8220;Is the master in there?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;The master must be having a hard time in there,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;Are his arms tied behind his back? Or is he all roped up? Is she going to steam him or boil him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;None of them,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;She'd just had a vegetarian feast served and was going to do it with him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So you've been lucky then,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;You must have drunk a wedding toast.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Idiot!&#8221; retorted Monkey, &#8220;Never mind about having a wedding drink. I can hardly keep him alive.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Then why are you here?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>Monkey told how he had seen the master and done his transformations, ending, &#8220;Don't let your fears run away with you, brothers. The master's here, and when I go back in this time I'll definitely rescue him.&#8221;</P>
<P>Going back inside, Monkey turned into a fly and landed on the gate-tower to listen. He could hear the she-devil snorting with fury as she gave instructions within the pavilion.</P>
<P>&#8220;Little ones, bring whatever there is, vegetarian or not, and burn paper as offerings to the deities. I'll ask heaven and earth to be the matchmakers. I'm definitely going to marry him.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard this he smiled to himself and thought, &#8220;That she-devil's completely shameless. She's locked a monk up in her home and now she's going to mess around with him in broad daylight. But don't be in too much of a hurry. Give me time to go in and have a look round.&#8221; With a buzz he flew along the corridor to see the master sitting inside, tears streaming down his face.</P>
<P>Monkey squeezed in, landed on Sanzang's head and called, &#8220;Master.&#8221; Recognizing the voice, Sanzang sprang to his feet and said with tooth-gnashing fury, &#8220;Macaque! Other people get their courage from a big gall, but they have to wrap their bodies around it. Your gall is so big that you wrap it round your body. You used your magical powers of transformation to smash the crockery, but what use is that? By fighting that she-devil you've only made her more sex-crazed than ever. She is arranging a banquet with vegetarian and impure food all mixed up and is determined to mate with me. Where will this all end?&#8221;</P>
<P>Smiling to himself again, Monkey replied, &#8220;Don't be angry with me, Master. I've got a way to save you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How will you save me?&#8221; the Tang Priest asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;When I flew up just now,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;I saw that she has a garden behind here. You must lure her into the garden to fool around and I'll rescue you from there.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How will you rescue me from the garden?&#8221; the Tang Priest asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Go to the peach trees in the garden with her and stay there. Wait till I've flown to a branch of the peach tree and turned into a red peach. When you want to eat a peach pick the red one first&#8212;that will be me. She'll be bound to pick one too. You must insist on giving her the red one. Once she's swallowed it I'll be in her stomach. When I tear her stomach to pieces and rip her guts to shreds she'll be dead and you'll be freed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;With your powers you ought to fight her,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;Why do you want to get into her stomach?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't understand, Master,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;If it were easy to get in and out of this cave of hers I would be able to fight her. But this place is very hard to get into or out of: the way out is complicated and difficult. If I started a fight with her all the fiends in her den, young and old, would overpower me. Then how would it end? We must act carefully if we're all to make a clean getaway.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang nodded, believing all that Monkey said, adding only, &#8220;You must stay with me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said monkey, &#8220;I know. I'll be on your head.&#8221;</P>
<P>When master and disciple had settled their plan Sanzang leaned forward, took hold of the bars in the corridor's gates and called out, &#8220;Lady, lady.&#8221;</P>
<P>As soon as she heard this the evil spirit came rushing over, a simpering smile on her face, to ask, &#8220;What do you have to say to me, my wonderful darling?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Lady,&#8221; replied Sanzang, &#8220;ever since leaving Chang'an and starting on my journey to the West I have had to cross mountains and rivers every single day. When I was staying in the Zhenhai Monastery last night I caught a bad chill and I have been in a sweat today. I was just beginning to feel a little better today when in your kindness, good lady, you brought me into your immortals' palace. As I have been sitting here all day I am now feeling in rather low spirits again. Could you take me somewhere to cheer myself up and have a little fun?&#8221;</P>
<P>The evil spirit was utterly delighted. &#8220;So you're feeling a bit interested, are you, my wonderful darling?&#8221; she said. &#8220;You and I will go into the garden for some fun. Little ones,&#8221; she called, &#8220;fetch the key, open the garden gates, and sweep the paths in the garden.&#8221; The demons all hurried off to open the gates and tidy the place up.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the evil spirit was opening the screen and helping the Tang Priest out. Just watch the many young demons&#8212;all willowy beauties with oiled hair and powdered faces&#8212;crowding around the Tang Priest as they head for the garden. What a splendid monk he was, walking amid these beauties in their gauze and brocade for no other purpose than to be deaf and dumb. If instead of having an iron heart set on the Buddha he had been any ordinary man susceptible to wine and women he would never have succeeded in fetching the scriptures.</P>
<P>When they reached the entrance to the garden the evil spirit whispered seductively, &#8220;My wonderful darling, let's have some fun here&#8212;it'll cheer you up.&#8221; They went into the garden hand in hand, and when he looked up he saw that it was indeed a splendid place. This is what could be seen:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>All over the winding paths</P>
<P>Bluish lichens grow.</P>
<P>Secluded gauze windows</P>
<P>Kept dark by embroidered curtains.</P>
<P>When the breeze arises</P>
<P>Silks and brocades float in the air.</P>
<P>When the gentle rain stops falling</P>
<P>The smooth white skin and jade-like flesh are revealed.</P>
<P>The sun-scorched apricot</P>
<P>Is red as an immortal's rainbow clothes spread out to dry;</P>
<P>The plantain in the moonlight</P>
<P>Is bluer than Lady Taizhen waving her feather fan.</P>
<P>Whitewashed walls enclose</P>
<P>The golden orioles that sing in ten thousand willows.</P>
<P>Within the empty halls</P>
<P>Butterflies flit among begonias in the courtyard.</P>
<P>Look at the Hall of Crystallized Perfumes,</P>
<P>The Green Moth Hall,</P>
<P>The Hall to Recover from Drunkenness,</P>
<P>The Hall of Longing,</P>
<P>Rolling up the brilliance, one behind the other.</P>
<P>On the red curtains</P>
<P>Hooks hold tassels like prawn whiskers.</P>
<P>Now look at the Pavilion to Ease Pain</P>
<P>The Pavilion of Simplicity,</P>
<P>The Pavilion of Thrushes,</P>
<P>The Four Rains Pavilion,</P>
<P>All towering and lofty,</P>
<P>And bearing on decorated tablets</P>
<P>Their names in archaic script.</P>
<P>Look too at the Pool Where Cranes Bathe,</P>
<P>The Goblet-washing Pool,</P>
<P>The Pool of Delight in the Moon,</P>
<P>The Pool for Cleansing Tassels,</P>
<P>Where amid duckweed and algae the gold scales shine.</P>
<P>Then there is the Kiosk of Ink Flowers,</P>
<P>The Kiosk of Strange Boxes,</P>
<P>The Interesting Kiosk,</P>
<P>The Kiosk for Admiring the Clouds</P>
<P>Where bubbles like green ants float on the wine in jade ladles and goblets.</P>
<P>Around the pools and pavilions</P>
<P>Stand rocks from Lake Taihu,</P>
<P>Rocks of purple crystal,</P>
<P>Yingluo rocks,</P>
<P>Jin River rocks,</P>
<P>Greenish and overgrown with tiger-whisker rushes.</P>
<P>East and West of the kiosks and balls are found</P>
<P>A Wooden Mountain,</P>
<P>A Turquoise Screen Mountain,</P>
<P>A Howling Wind Mountain,</P>
<P>A Jade Mushroom Mountain,</P>
<P>All covered in phoenix-tail bamboo.</P>
<P>Trellises of briar roses,</P>
<P>And garden roses,</P>
<P>Growing by a swing,</P>
<P>As a curtain of silk and brocade.</P>
<P>A Pine Pavilion,</P>
<P>A Magnolia Pavilion,</P>
<P>Opposite a Saussurea Pavilion,</P>
<P>Forming a wall of jade with embroidered hangings.</P>
<P>Herbaceous and tree peonies are rivals in luxuriance;</P>
<P>The night-closing magnolias and the jasmine</P>
<P>Are charming every year.</P>
<P>Moist with dewdrops are the purple buds:</P>
<P>They ought to be painted or drawn.</P>
<P>The red hibiscus fills the sky with flaming splendor,</P>
<P>A marvellous subject for poetry.</P>
<P>When it comes to fine scenery</P>
<P>This makes Lang Garden or Penglai not worth a mention;</P>
<P>And as for the flowers,</P>
<P>The finest peonies of Luoyang count for nothing beside them.</P>
<P>In the battle of the blossoms late in the spring</P>
<P>The garden lacks only the flowers of jade.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The venerable elder led the she-devil by the hand as they strolled in the garden, admiring the endless displays of rare and exotic blooms. As they went through many a hall and pavilion he really did seem to be going into an exquisite place. Looking up, he realized that he was by the peach grove. Monkey pinched his master's head to remind him.</P>
<P>Flying to a branch of a peach tree Brother Monkey shook himself and turned into a red peach, and a most fetchingly red one at that. &#8220;Lady,&#8221; the venerable elder said to the evil spirit, &#8220;what beautifully scented flowers and ripe fruit you have in this garden.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The blooms are so fragrant bees vie for their nectar;</P>
<P>The birds all compete for the fruit on the branches.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Why are some of the peaches on the trees red and some green?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If there were no Yin and Yang in the heavens the sun and moon would not be bright,&#8221; the evil spirit replied with a smile. &#8220;If there were no Yin and Yang in the earth the plants and trees would not grow. And if there were no Yin and Yang among people there would be no sexual difference. The peaches on the Southern Yang side of these trees are red because they ripen first in the sun's heat. The peaches on the Northern Yin side are green because they get no sun and are still unripe. It's all because of the Yin and the Yang.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Thank you, lady, for your explanation,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;I did not know that.&#8221; He then reached out and picked a red peach, while the evil spirit also picked a green one.</P>
<P>Sanzang bowed as he handed the red one respectfully to the evil spirit with the words, &#8220;Lady, you love what is attractive, so won't you take this red peach and give me the green one?&#8221;</P>
<P>The she-devil made the exchange, thinking with concealed delight, &#8220;What a nice monk. He really is a good man. He is being so loving to me even before we're man and wife.&#8221; With great pleasure she paid him her affectionate respects. As the Tang Priest started to eat the green peach at once the evil spirit was delighted to do likewise, opening her mouth to bite into the red one. When she parted her red lips and revealed her silver teeth the impatient Monkey did not give her time to bite him but rolled straight down her throat into her stomach.</P>
<P>&#8220;Reverend gentleman,&#8221; the terrified evil spirit said, &#8220;that peach is a terror. Why did it roll straight down and not let me bite it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Lady,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;the first ripe fruits of a garden are very delicious. That is why it went down so fast.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But it shot straight down before I'd had time to spit the stone out,&#8221; the evil spirit replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Because you are such a lover of what is fine and beautiful and enjoyed it so much,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;you swallowed it before you could bring the stone out.&#8221;</P>
<P>Once inside her stomach Monkey turned back into himself. &#8220;Master,&#8221; he called, &#8220;no need to argue with her now. I've succeeded.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be too hard on her, disciple,&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Who are you talking to?&#8221; the evil spirit asked when she heard this. &#8220;I am talking to my disciple Sun Wukong,&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221; the evil spirit asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;In your stomach,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;He was the red peach you have just eaten.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's the end of me,&#8221; exclaimed the evil spirit in horror. &#8220;If that ape's got into my stomach I'm dead. Sun the Novice, why did you go to such lengths to get into my stomach?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No particular reason,&#8221; replied Monkey from inside her. &#8220;I just wanted to eat the six leaves of your liver and your lungs, and your heart with its three hairs and seven apertures. I'm going to clean your insides right out and leave you a skeleton spirit.&#8221;</P>
<P>This sent the evil spirit's souls scattering in terror and shivering and shaking she clung tightly to the Tang Priest and said, &#8220;Reverend gentleman, I had thought that</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Our destinies were from former lives joined by a red thread;</P>
<P>Our love was as close as the water and the fish.</P>
<P>I never imagined that we lovebirds would be parted</P>
<P>Or that the phoenixes would fly to East and West.</P>
<P>When the waters rose under Lan Bridge the rendezvous failed;</P>
<P>The meeting came to nothing in the misty temple.</P>
<P>After brief joy we are parted once more;</P>
<P>In whatever year will I meet you again?&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Monkey heard all this from inside her stomach he was afraid that the venerable elder would have another attack of benevolence and let her talk her way out of the problem. Thereupon he started to wield fist and foot, striking out in martial postures and leveling everything around him. He punched her stomach almost to ribbons. Unable to bear the pain, the evil spirit collapsed in the dust, not daring to utter a single word for some time. As she was not speaking Monkey imagined that she must be dead and eased off.</P>
<P>She then recovered her breath to some extent and called out, &#8220;Where are you, little ones?&#8221; Now once in the garden, the creatures had all had the understanding to go off picking flowers, playing in the grass and amusing themselves, leaving the she-devil alone with the Tang Priest for a romantic conversation. As soon as they heard her calling they rushed over to see the evil spirit lying on the ground, her face a terrible color as she groaned, unable to move.</P>
<P>They hurriedly helped her up, crowding round and asking, &#8220;What's wrong, madam? Have you had a heart attack?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; the evil spirit replied. &#8220;Don't ask any questions. I've got someone inside me. Take the monk outside if you want to save my life.&#8221;</P>
<P>The junior devils actually did start to carry the Tang Priest, at which Monkey yelled from inside her belly, &#8220;Don't any of you dare carry him. You must take my master out yourself. I'll only spare your life when you've carried him outside.&#8221;</P>
<P>This left the evil spirit with no choice as all she cared about was saving her skin. At once she struggled to her feet, lifted the Tang Priest on her back and headed outside, followed by the junior devils asking, &#8220;Where are you going, Madam?&#8221;</P>
<P>To this the evil spirit replied,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;'As long as the lakes and the bright moon remain</P>
<P>I'll surely find somewhere to put my golden hook.'</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Once I've taken this wretch outside I'll find myself another man.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid evil spirit went straight by cloud to the mouth of the cave, where the clang of weapons and wild shouts could be heard.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;why can I hear weapons outside?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's Pig rubbing his rake,&#8221; replied Monkey. &#8220;Give him a shout.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Bajie,&#8221; Sanzang shouted.</P>
<P>&#8220;Friar Sand,&#8221; said Pig when he heard this, &#8220;the master's out.&#8221; The two of them drew back their rake and staff, letting the evil spirit carry the Tang Priest out. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Mind Ape had subdued a monster from the inside;</P>
<P>The Earth and Wood door guards welcomed the holy monk.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know whether the evil spirit's life was spared listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>姹女求阳</p>
<p>元神护道</p>
</div>
<p>却说八戒跳下山，寻着一条小路，依路前行，有五六里远近，忽见二个女怪，在那井上打水。他怎么认得是两个女怪？见他头上戴一顶一尺二三寸高的篾丝鬏髻，甚不时兴。呆子走近前叫声妖怪，那怪闻言大怒，两人互相说道：“这和尚惫懒！我们又不与他相识，平时又没有调得嘴惯，他怎么叫我们做妖怪！”那怪恼了，轮起抬水的杠子，劈头就打。这呆子手无兵器，遮架不得，被他捞了几下，侮着头跑上山来道：“哥啊，回去罢！</p>

<p>妖怪凶！”行者道：“怎么凶？”八戒道：“山凹里两个女妖精在井上打水，我只叫了他一声，就被他打了我三四杠子！”行者道：</p>

<p>“你叫他做甚么的？”八戒道：“我叫他做妖怪。”行者笑道：“打得还少。”八戒道：“谢你照顾！头都打肿了，还说少哩！”行者道：“‘温柔天下去得，刚强寸步难移’。他们是此地之怪，我们是远来之僧，你一身都是手，也要略温存。你就去叫他做妖怪，他不打你，打我？人将礼乐为先。”八戒道：“一发不晓得！”行者道：“你自幼在山中吃人，你晓得有两样木么？”八戒道：“不知，是甚么木？”行者道：“一样是杨木，一样是檀木。杨木性格甚软，巧匠取来，或雕圣象，或刻如来，装金立粉，嵌玉装花，万人烧香礼拜，受了多少无量之福。那檀木性格刚硬，油房里取了去，做柞撒，使铁箍箍了头，又使铁锤往下打，只因刚强，所以受此苦楚。”八戒道：“哥啊，你这好话儿，早与我说说也好，却不受他打了。”行者道：“你还去问他个端的。”八戒道：“这去他认得我了。”行者道：“你变化了去。”八戒道：“哥啊，且如我变了，却怎么问么？”行者道：“你变了去，到他跟前，行个礼儿，看他多大年纪，若与我们差不多，叫他声姑娘；若比我们老些儿，叫他声奶奶。”八戒笑道：“可是蹭蹬！这般许远的田地，认得是甚么亲！”行者道：“不是认亲，要套他的话哩。若是他拿了师父，就好下手；若不是他，却不误了我们别处干事？”八戒道：</p>

<p>“说得有理，等我再去。”好呆子，把钉钯撒在腰里，下山凹，摇身一变，变做个黑胖和尚，摇摇摆摆走近怪前，深深唱个大喏道：“奶奶，贫僧稽首了。”那两个喜道：“这个和尚却好，会唱个喏儿，又会称道一声儿。”问道：“长老，那里来的？”八戒道：“那里来的。”又问：“那里去的？”又道：“那里去的。”又问：“你叫做甚么名字？”又答道：“我叫做甚么名字。”那怪笑道：“这和尚好便好，只是没来历，会说顺口话儿。”八戒道：“奶奶，你们打水怎的？”那怪道：“和尚，你不知道。我家老夫人今夜里摄了一个唐僧在洞内，要管待他，我洞中水不干净，差我两个来此打这阴阳交媾的好水，安排素果素菜的筵席，与唐僧吃了，晚间要成亲哩。”那呆子闻得此言，急抽身跑上山叫：“沙和尚，快拿将行李来，我们分了罢！”沙僧道：“二哥，又分怎的？”八戒道：“分了便你还去流沙河吃人，我去高老庄探亲，哥哥去花果山称圣，白龙马归大海成龙，师父已在这妖精洞内成亲哩！我们都各安生理去也！”行者道：“这呆子又胡说了！”八戒道：“你的儿子胡说！才那两个抬水的妖精说，安排素筵席与唐僧吃了成亲哩！”行者道：“那妖精把师父困在洞里，师父眼巴巴的望我们去救，你却在此说这样话！”八戒道：“怎么救？”行者道：“你两个牵着马，挑着担，我们跟着那两个女怪，做个引子，引到那门前，一齐下手。”真个呆子只得随行。行者远远的标着那两怪，渐入深山，有一二十里远近，忽然不见。八戒惊道：“师父是日里鬼拿去了！”行者道：“你好眼力！怎么就看出他本相来？”八戒道：“那两个怪，正抬着水走，忽然不见，却不是个日里鬼？”</p>

<p>行者道：“想是钻进洞去了，等我去看。”</p>

<p>好大圣，急睁火眼金睛，漫山看处，果然不见动静，只见那陡崖前，有一座玲珑剔透细妆花、堆五采、三檐四簇的牌楼。他与八戒沙僧近前观看，上有六个大字，乃陷空山无底洞。行者道：“兄弟呀，这妖精把个架子支在这里，这不知门向那里开哩。”沙僧说：“不远！不远！好生寻！”都转身看时，牌楼下山脚下有一块大石，约有十余里方圆；正中间有缸口大的一个洞儿，爬得光溜溜的。八戒道：“哥啊，这就是妖精出入洞也。”行者看了道：“怪哉！我老孙自保唐僧，瞒不得你两个，妖精也拿了些，却不见这样洞府。八戒，你先下去试试，看有多少浅深，我好进去救师父。”八戒摇头道：“这个难！这个难！我老猪身子夯夯的，若塌了脚吊下去，不知二三年可得到底哩！”行者道：“就有多深么？”八戒道：“你看！”大圣伏在洞边上，仔细往下看处，咦！深啊！周围足有三百余里，回头道：“兄弟，果然深得紧！”八戒道：“你便回去罢。师父救不得耶！”行者道：“你说那里话！莫生懒惰意，休起怠荒心，且将行李歇下，把马拴在牌楼柱上，你使钉钯，沙僧使杖，拦住洞门，让我进去打听打听。</p>

<p>若师父果在里面，我将铁棒把妖精从里打出，跑至门口，你两个却在外面挡住，这是里应外合。打死精灵，才救得师父。”二人遵命。</p>

<p>行者却将身一纵，跳入洞中，足下彩云生万道，身边瑞气护千层。不多时，到于深远之间，那里边明明朗朗，一般的有日色，有风声，又有花草果木。行者喜道：“好去处啊！想老孙出世，天赐与水帘洞，这里也是个洞天福地！”正看时，又见有一座二滴水的门楼，团团都是松竹，内有许多房舍，又想道：“此必是妖精的住处了，我且到那里边去打听打听。且住！若是这般去啊，他认得我了，且变化了去。”摇身捻诀，就变做个苍蝇儿，轻轻的飞在门楼上听听。只见那怪高坐在草亭内，他那模样，比在松林里救他，寺里拿他，便是不同，越发打扮得俊了：</p>

<p>发盘云髻似堆鸦，身着绿绒花比甲。一对金莲刚半折，十指如同春笋发。团团粉面若银盆，朱唇一似樱桃滑。端端正正美人姿，月里嫦娥还喜恰。今朝拿住取经僧，便要欢娱同枕榻。行者且不言语，听他说甚话。少时，绽破樱桃，喜孜孜的叫道：“小的们，快排素筵席来。我与唐僧哥哥吃了成亲。”行者暗笑道：</p>

<p>“真个有这话！我只道八戒作耍子乱说哩！等我且飞进去寻寻，看师父在那里。不知他的心性如何。假若被他摩弄动了啊，留他在这里也罢。”即展翅飞到里边看处，那东廊下上明下暗的红纸格子里面，坐着唐僧哩。行者一头撞破格子眼，飞在唐僧光头上丁着，叫声“师父。”三藏认得声音，叫道：“徒弟，救我命啊！”行者道：“师父不济呀！那妖精安排筵宴，与你吃了成亲哩。或生下一男半女，也是你和尚之后代，你愁怎的？”长老闻言，咬牙切齿道：“徒弟，我自出了长安，到两界山中收你，一向西来，那个时辰动荤？那一日子有甚歪意？今被这妖精拿住，要求配偶，我若把真阳丧了，我就身堕轮回，打在那阴山背后，永世不得翻身！”行者笑道：“莫发誓，既有真心往西天取经，老孙带你去罢。”三藏道：“进来的路儿，我通忘了。”行者道：“莫说你忘了。他这洞，不比走进来走出去的，是打上头往下钻。如今救了你，要打底下往上钻。若是造化高，钻着洞口儿，就出去了；若是造化低，钻不着，还有个闷杀的日子了。”三藏满眼垂泪道：“似此艰难，怎生是好？”行者道：“没事！没事！那妖精整治酒与你吃，没奈何，也吃他一锺；只要斟得急些儿，斟起一个喜花儿来，等我变作个蟭蟟虫儿，飞在酒泡之下，他把我一口吞下肚去，我就捻破他的心肝，扯断他的肺腑，弄死那妖精，你才得脱身出去。”三藏道：“徒弟这等说，只是不当人子。”行者道：“只管行起善来，你命休矣。妖精乃害人之物，你惜他怎的！”三藏道：“也罢，也罢！你只是要跟着我。”正是那孙大圣护定唐三藏，取经僧全靠美猴王。</p>

<p>他师徒两个，商量未定，早是那妖精安排停当，走近东廊外，开了门锁，叫声：“长老。”唐僧不敢答应。又叫一声，又不敢答应。他不敢答应者何意？想着口开神气散，舌动是非生。却又一条心儿想着，若死住法儿不开口，怕他心狠，顷刻间就害了性命。正是那进退两难心问口，三思忍耐口问心，正自狐疑，那怪又叫一声“长老。”唐僧没奈何，应他一声道：“娘子，有。”</p>

<p>那长老应出这一句言来，真是肉落千斤。人都说唐僧是个真心的和尚，往西天拜佛求经，怎么与这女妖精答话？不知此时正是危急存亡之秋，万分出于无奈，虽是外有所答，其实内无所欲。妖精见长老应了一声，他推开门，把唐僧搀起来，和他携手挨背，交头接耳，你看他做出那千般娇态，万种风情，岂知三藏一腔子烦恼！行者暗中笑道：“我师父被他这般哄诱，只怕一时动心。”正是：真僧魔苦遇娇娃，妖怪娉婷实可夸。淡淡翠眉分柳叶，盈盈丹脸衬桃花。绣鞋微露双钩凤，云髻高盘两鬓鸦。含笑与师携手处，香飘兰麝满袈裟。妖精挽着三藏，行近草亭道：</p>

<p>“长老，我办了一杯酒，和你酌酌。”唐僧道：“娘子，贫僧自不用荤。”妖精道：“我知你不吃荤，因洞中水不洁净，特命山头上取阴阳交媾的净水，做些素果素菜筵席，和你耍子。”唐僧跟他进去观看，果然见那：盈门下，绣缠彩结；满庭中，香喷金猊。摆列着黑油垒钿桌，朱漆篾丝盘。垒钿桌上，有异样珍羞；篾丝盘中，盛稀奇素物。林檎、橄榄、莲肉、葡萄、榧、柰、榛、松、荔枝、龙眼、山栗、风菱、枣儿、柿子、胡桃、银杏、金桔、香橙，果子随山有；蔬菜更时新：豆腐、面筋、木耳、鲜笋、蘑菇、香蕈、山药、黄精。石花菜、黄花菜，青油煎炒；扁豆角、豇豆角，熟酱调成。</p>

<p>王瓜、瓠子，白果、蔓菁。镟皮茄子鹌鹑做，剔种冬瓜方旦名。烂煨芋头糖拌着，白煮萝卜醋浇烹。椒姜辛辣般般美，咸淡调和色色平。那妖精露尖尖之玉指，捧晃晃之金杯，满斟美酒，递与唐僧，口里叫道：“长老哥哥妙人，请一杯交欢酒儿。”三藏羞答答的接了酒，望空浇奠，心中暗祝道：“护法诸天、五方揭谛、四值功曹：弟子陈玄奘，自离东土，蒙观世音菩萨差遣列位众神暗中保护，拜雷音见佛求经，今在途中，被妖精拿住，强逼成亲，将这一杯酒递与我吃。此酒果是素酒，弟子勉强吃了，还得见佛成功；若是荤酒，破了弟子之戒，永堕轮回之苦！”孙大圣，他却变得轻巧，在耳根后，若象一个耳报，但他说话，惟三藏听见，别人不闻。他知师父平日好吃葡萄做的素酒，教吃他一锺。</p>

<p>那师父没奈何吃了，急将酒满斟一锺，回与妖怪，果然斟起有一个喜花儿。行者变作个蟭蟟虫儿，轻轻的飞入喜花之下。那妖精接在手，且不吃，把杯儿放住，与唐僧拜了两拜，口里娇娇怯怯，叙了几句情话。却才举杯，那花儿已散，就露出虫来。妖精也认不得是行者变的，只以为虫儿，用小指挑起，往下一弹。</p>

<p>行者见事不谐，料难入他腹，即变做个饿老鹰。真个是：玉爪金睛铁翮，雄姿猛气抟云。妖狐狡兔见他昏，千里山河时遁。饥处迎风逐雀，饱来高贴天门。老拳钢硬最伤人，得志凌霄嫌近。</p>

<p>飞起来，轮开玉爪，响一声掀翻桌席，把些素果素菜、盘碟家火尽皆捽碎，撇却唐僧，飞将出去。唬得妖精心胆皆裂，唐僧的骨肉通酥。妖精战战兢兢，搂住唐僧道：“长老哥哥，此物是那里来的？”三藏道：“贫僧不知。”妖精道：“我费了许多心，安排这个素宴与你耍耍，却不知这个扁毛畜生，从那里飞来，把我的家火打碎！”众小妖道：“夫人，打碎家火犹可，将些素品都泼散在地，秽了怎用？”三藏分明晓得是行者弄法，他那里敢说。那妖精道：“小的们，我知道了，想必是我把唐僧困住，天地不容，故降此物。你们将碎家火拾出去，另安排些酒肴，不拘荤素，我指天为媒，指地作订，然后再与唐僧成亲。”依然把长老送在东廊里坐下不题。</p>

<p>却说行者飞出去，现了本相，到于洞口，叫声“开门”八戒笑道：“沙僧，哥哥来了。”他二人撒开兵器。行者跳出，八戒上前扯住道：“可有妖精？可有师父？”行者道：“有！有！有！”八戒道：“师父在里边受罪哩？绑着是捆着？要蒸是要煮？”行者道：“这个事倒没有，只是安排素宴，要与他干那个事哩。”八戒道：“你造化，你造化！你吃了陪亲酒来了！”行者道：“呆子啊！</p>

<p>师父的性命也难保，吃甚么陪亲酒！”八戒道：“你怎的就来了？”行者把见唐僧施变化的上项事说了一遍，道：“兄弟们，再休胡思乱想。师父已在此间，老孙这一去，一定救他出来。”复翻身入里面，还变做个苍蝇儿，丁在门楼上听之，只闻得这妖怪气呼呼的，在亭子上吩咐：“小的们，不论荤素，拿来烧纸。借烦天地为媒订，务要与他成亲。”行者听见暗笑道：“这妖精全没一些儿廉耻！青天白日的，把个和尚关在家里摆布。且不要忙，等老孙再进去看看。”嘤的一声，飞在东廊之下，见那师父坐在里边，清滴滴腮边泪淌。行者钻将进去，丁在他头上，又叫声“师父。长老认得声音，跳起来咬牙恨道：“猢狲啊！别人胆大，还是身包胆；你的胆大，就是胆包身！你弄变化神通，打破家火，能值几何！斗得那妖精淫兴发了，那里不分荤素安排，定要与我交媾，此事怎了！”行者暗中陪笑道：“师父莫怪，有救你处。”唐僧道：“那里救得我？”行者道：“我才一翅飞起去时，见他后边有个花园。你哄他往园里去耍子，我救了你罢。”唐僧道：“园里怎么样救？”行者道：“你与他到园里，走到桃树边，就莫走了。等我飞上桃枝，变作个红桃子。你要吃果子，先拣红的儿摘下来。红的是我，他必然也要摘一个，你把红的定要让他。他若一口吃了，我却在他肚里，等我捣破他的皮袋，扯断他的肝肠，弄死他，你就脱身了。”三藏道：“你若有手段，就与他赌斗便了，只要钻在他肚里怎么？”行者道：“师父，你不知趣。</p>

<p>他这个洞，若好出入，便可与他赌斗；只为出入不便，曲道难行，若就动手，他这一窝子，老老小小，连我都扯住，却怎么了？</p>

<p>须是这般捽手干，大家才得干净。”三藏点头听信，只叫：“你跟定我。”行者道：“晓得！晓得！我在你头上。”</p>

<p>师徒们商量定了，三藏才欠起身来，双手扶着那格子叫道：“娘子，娘子。”那妖精听见，笑唏唏的跑近跟前道：“妙人哥哥，有甚话说？”三藏道：“娘子，我出了长安，一路西来，无日不山，无日不水。昨在镇海寺投宿，偶得伤风重疾，今日出了汗，略才好些；又蒙娘子盛情，携入仙府，只得坐了这一日，又觉心神不爽。你带我往那里略散散心，耍耍儿去么？”那妖精十分欢喜道：“妙人哥哥倒有些兴趣，我和你去花园里耍耍。”叫：“小的们，拿钥匙来开了园门，打扫路径。”众妖都跑去开门收拾。</p>

<p>这妖精开了格子，搀出唐僧。你看那许多小妖，都是油头粉面，嬝娜娉婷，簇簇拥拥，与唐僧径上花园而去。好和尚！他在这绮罗队里无他故，锦绣丛中作哑聋，若不是这铁打的心肠朝佛去。第二个酒色凡夫也取不得经。一行都到了花园之外，那妖精俏语低声叫道：“妙人哥哥，这里耍耍，真可散心释闷。”唐僧与他携手相搀，同入园内，抬头观看，其实好个去处。但见那：</p>

<p>萦回曲径，纷纷尽点苍苔；窈窕绮窗，处处暗笼绣箔。微风初动，轻飘飘展开蜀锦吴绫；细雨才收，娇滴滴露出冰肌玉质。日灼鲜杏，红如仙子晒霓裳；月映芭蕉，青似太真摇羽扇。粉墙四面，万株杨柳啭黄鹂；闲馆周围，满院海棠飞粉蝶。更看那凝香阁；青蛾阁、解酲阁、相思阁，层层卷映，朱帘上，钩控虾须；又见那养酸亭、披素亭、画眉亭、四雨亭、个个峥嵘，华扁上，字书鸟篆。看那浴鹤池、洗觞池、怡月池、濯缨池，青萍绿藻耀金鳞；</p>

<p>又有墨花轩、异箱轩、适趣轩、慕云轩，玉斗琼卮浮绿蚁。池亭上下，有太湖石、紫英石、鹦落石、锦川石，青青栽着虎须蒲；轩阁东西，有木假山、翠屏山、啸风山、玉芝山，处处丛生凤尾竹。</p>

<p>荼蘼架、蔷薇架，近着秋千架，浑如锦帐罗帏；松柏亭、辛夷亭，对着木香亭，却似碧城绣幕。芍药栏，牡丹丛，朱朱紫紫斗秾华；夜合台，茉藜槛，岁岁年年生妩媚。涓涓滴露紫含笑，堪画堪描，艳艳烧空红拂桑，宜题宜赋。论景致，休夸阆苑蓬莱；较芳菲，不数姚黄魏紫。若到三春闲斗草，园中只少玉琼花。长老携着那怪，步赏花园，看不尽的奇葩异卉。行过了许多亭阁，真个是渐入佳境。忽抬头，到了桃树林边，行者把师父头上一掐，那长老就知。</p>

<p>行者飞在桃树枝儿上，摇身一变，变作个红桃儿，其实红得可爱。长老对妖精道：“娘子，你这苑内花香，枝头果熟，苑内花香蜂竞采，枝头果熟鸟争衔。怎么这桃树上果子青红不一，何也？”妖精笑道：“天无阴阳，日月不明；地无阴阳，草木不生；</p>

<p>人无阴阳，不分男女。这桃树上果子，向阳处有日色相烘者先熟，故红；背阴处无日者还生，故青：此阴阳之道理也。”三藏道，“谢娘子指教，其实贫僧不知。”即向前伸手摘了个红桃。妖精也去摘了一个青桃。三藏躬身将红桃奉与妖怪道：“娘子，你爱色，请吃这个红桃，拿青的来我吃。”妖精真个换了，且暗喜道：“好和尚啊！果是个真人！一日夫妻未做，却就有这般恩爱也。”那妖精喜喜欢欢的，把唐僧亲敬。这唐僧把青桃拿过来就吃，那妖精喜相陪，把红桃儿张口便咬。启朱唇，露银牙，未曾下口，原来孙行者十分性急，毂辘一个跟头，翻入他咽喉之下，径到肚腹之中。妖精害怕对三藏道：“长老啊，这个果子利害。</p>

<p>怎么不容咬破，就滚下去了？”三藏道：“娘子，新开园的果子爱吃，所以去得快了。”妖精道：“未曾吐出核子，他就撺下去了。”</p>

<p>三藏道：“娘子意美情佳，喜吃之甚，所以不及吐核，就下去了。”行者在他肚里，复了本相，叫声：“师父，不要与他答嘴，老孙已得了手也！”三藏道：“徒弟方便着些。”妖精听见道：“你和那个说话哩？”三藏道：“和我徒弟孙悟空说话哩。”妖精道：“孙悟空在那里？”三藏道：“在你肚里哩，却才吃的那个红桃子不是？”妖精慌了道：“罢了，罢了！这猴头钻在我肚里，我是死也！</p>

<p>孙行者！你千方百计的钻在我肚里怎的？”行者在里边恨道：</p>

<p>“也不怎的！只是吃了你的六叶连肝肺，三毛七孔心；五脏都淘净，弄做个梆子精！”妖精听说，唬得魂飞魄散，战战兢兢的，把唐僧抱住道：“长老啊！我只道夙世前缘系赤绳，鱼水相和两意浓。不料鸳鸯今拆散，何期鸾凤又西东！蓝桥水涨难成事，佛庙烟沉嘉会空。着意一场今又别，何年与你再相逢！行者在他肚里听见说时，只怕长老慈心，又被他哄了，便就轮拳跳脚，支架子，理四平，几乎把个皮装儿捣破了。那妖精忍不得疼痛，倒在尘埃，半晌家不敢言语。行者见不言语，想是死了，却把手略松一松，他又回过气来，叫：“小的们！在那里？”原来那些小妖，自进园门来，各人知趣，都不在一处，各自去采花斗草，任意随心耍子，让那妖精与唐僧两个自在叙情儿。忽听得叫，却才都跑将来，又见妖精倒在地上，面容改色，口里哼哼的爬不动，连忙搀起，围在一处道：“夫人，怎的不好？想是急心疼了？”妖精道：“不是！不是！你莫要问，我肚里已有了人也！快把这和尚送出去，留我性命！”那些小妖，真个都来扛抬。行者在肚里叫道：“那个敢抬！要便是你自家献我师父出去，出到外边，我饶你命！”那怪精没计奈何，只是惜命之心，急挣起来，把唐僧背在身上，拽开步，往外就走。小妖跟随道：“老夫人，往那里去？”</p>

<p>妖精道：“留得五湖明月在，何愁没处下金钩！把这厮送出去，等我别寻一个头儿罢！”好妖精，一纵云光，直到洞口。又闻得叮叮当当，兵刃乱响，三藏道：“徒弟，外面兵器响哩。”行者道：</p>

<p>“是八戒揉钯哩，你叫他一声。”三藏便叫：“八戒！”八戒听见道：“沙和尚！师父出来也！”二人掣开钯杖，妖精把唐僧驮出。</p>

<p>咦！正是：心猿里应降邪怪，土木司门接圣僧。毕竟不知那妖精性命如何，且听下回分解。</p>
