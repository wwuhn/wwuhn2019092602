<P>The Young Girl Seeks a Mate to Build Up the Male</P>
<P>Protecting His Master the Mind-Ape Sees Through a Demon</P>
</div>
<P>The story tells how the king, ministers and common people of Bhiksuland escorted the Tang Priest and his three disciples out of the city. Seven miles later they were still unwilling to part from the pilgrims, but Sanzang insisted on getting out of the coach, mounting the horse and taking his leave of them. The people who had been seeing him off did not return to the city until the travelers had vanished from view.</P>
<P>When the four had been travelling for a long time the winter and the spring too were over. There was no end of wild flowers and mountain trees to be seen; fragrant blossoms filled the view. To Sanzang's alarm another towering mountain appeared in front of them.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciples,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;is there a way across the high mountain before us? We must be careful.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; laughed Brother Monkey, &#8220;that's not what a seasoned traveler should be saying. You sound much more like some pampered prince trying to look at the whole sky from the bottom of a well. As the old saying goes, a mountain can't stop the road: it can find its own way across. So why ask whether there's a way?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Even if this mountain cannot block the road,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;I am afraid that there may be monsters on the mountain precipices and evil spirits that will emerge from its deep recesses.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't worry,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;don't worry. We're not far from Paradise here. I guarantee it'll all be nice and peaceful&#8212;there won't be any trouble.&#8221; As they were talking master and disciples reached the foot of the mountain without even noticing. Taking out his gold-banded cudgel Monkey climbed the rock-face.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; he called, &#8220;there's a path that goes round the mountain. The going's very easy. Hurry up!&#8221; The Tang Priest now put his worries aside and whipped the horse forward. &#8220;Carry the luggage for a while, brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand to Pig, who did so while Friar Sand held the horse's reins and the master sat in the carved saddle. They hurried along the main path up the steep slope after Monkey. This was what the mountain looked like:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The peak was wrapped in clouds;</P>
<P>Torrents rushed down ravines.</P>
<P>The paths were heavy with the scent of flowers,</P>
<P>And dense grew the countless trees.</P>
<P>Blue were the gages, white the plums,</P>
<P>Green the willows and red the peaches.</P>
<P>Spring was all but over where the cuckoo sang;</P>
<P>When fledgling swallows chirped the festival was finished.</P>
<P>Craggy boulders,</P>
<P>Blue-green pines shaped like parasols.</P>
<P>The track leading across the ridge</P>
<P>Climbed high over a tracery of rocks;</P>
<P>The beetling precipice</P>
<P>Was overgrown with creepers, grass and trees.</P>
<P>Peaks like a row of halberds vied in elegance;</P>
<P>Far from the ocean wave streams competed in gullies.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As the master was taking an unhurried look at the mountain scenery he was moved to homesickness by the sound of a bird singing. &#8220;Disciples,&#8221; he said,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;After receiving His Majesty's command</P>
<P>I was given my passport in front of the brocade screen.</P>
<P>Watching lanterns on the fifteenth night I left the Eastern land,</P>
<P>And then was parted from the emperor of Tang.</P>
<P>Just when the dragon and tiger winds both met</P>
<P>I and my disciples had to struggle with the horse.</P>
<P>Twelve may be the peaks of Mount Wu;</P>
<P>But when shall I face and see you again?&#8221;'</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you're always suffering from homesickness. You're not like a monk at all. Stop worrying and keep going: don't upset yourself so. As the old saying goes, you've got to work hard if you want to be rich and successful.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What you say is quite right, disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;but I do not know where the road to the West runs.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;it's all because our Tathagata Buddha can't bring himself to give those scriptures away. He must have removed the path because he knows we're coming to fetch them. Why else can't we get to the end of the journey?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't talk such nonsense,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;Just keep going with big brother. As long as we stick with him we're bound to get there in the end.&#8221;</P>
<P>As they were talking master and disciples came in sight of a great expanse of dark pine forest. In his fear the Tang Priest called out, &#8220;Wukong, no sooner have we taken that precipitous track over the mountain than we come to this deep, dark pine forest. Why? We must be careful.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's nothing to be scared of,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;Never trust what appears to be absolutely upright, and be on your guard against evil masquerading as goodness. I have been through quite a few pine woods with you, but never one as vast and deep as this. Just look at the trees:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Dense-packed to East and West,</P>
<P>In lines to North and South.</P>
<P>Dense-packed to East and West they reach the end of the clouds;</P>
<P>In lines to North and South they touch the azure firmament.</P>
<P>Thorns and brambles grow close-tangled all about;</P>
<P>Knotweed wraps itself around the branches.</P>
<P>Liana coils round kudzu vine,</P>
<P>Kudzu coils around liana.</P>
<P>Where liana coils around kudzu</P>
<P>Travelers cannot move between East and West;</P>
<P>Where kudzu coils round liana</P>
<P>Merchants may not ply between North and South.</P>
<P>In this forest</P>
<P>You could spend half a year,</P>
<P>Not knowing whether sun or moon was out,</P>
<P>Or travel for miles</P>
<P>And never see the stars.</P>
<P>Where the outlook is to the North the view is unbounded;</P>
<P>On Southern slopes the bushes are in flower.</P>
<P>There are thousand-year-old locust trees,</P>
<P>Ten-thousand-year-old junipers,</P>
<P>Pines that endure the winter cold,</P>
<P>Mountain peaches that bear fruit,</P>
<P>Wild peonies,</P>
<P>And hibiscus,</P>
<P>All growing in a close-packed profusion,</P>
<P>So wild that not even a god could paint it.</P>
<P>Bird-song could be heard:</P>
<P>Parrots shrieking,</P>
<P>Cuckoos calling,</P>
<P>Magpies in the branches,</P>
<P>Crows feeding their mothers,</P>
<P>Orioles with their aerial dance,</P>
<P>As the mynas adjust their voices.</P>
<P>Quails singing,</P>
<P>Swallows chirping,</P>
<P>Mynas imitating people,</P>
<P>And thrushes that could recite sutras.</P>
<P>Then there were:</P>
<P>Great beasts swishing their tails,</P>
<P>Tigers gnashing their teeth.</P>
<P>Aged foxes and raccoon-dogs disguised as ladies,</P>
<P>Ancient gray wolves at whose baying the forest shook.</P>
<P>Had the Pagoda-carrying Heavenly King come here</P>
<P>His power to suppress demons would have been of no avail.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Great Sage Sun was unafraid. Clearing the way ahead with his cudgel, he led the Tang Priest into the depths of the forest.</P>
<P>They had been travelling in this carefree style for many hours without seeing any sign of a way out of the forest when the Tang Priest called out, &#8220;Disciples, we have been through no end of steep and dangerous mountain woods on our journey West. Thank goodness we have found this purity and elegance and a smooth path. The rare and unusual flowers here are truly delightful. I intend to sit here for a moment to let the horse have a rest. I am, besides, famished. Go and beg me some meat-free food from somewhere.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;please dismount while I go begging.&#8221; This the venerable elder did. While Pig tied the horse to a tree Friar Sand put the luggage down, brought out the begging-bowl and handed it to Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Sit still here, Master,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;and don't even say the word 'fear'. I'll be back in a moment.&#8221; While Sanzang sat upright in the shade of the pines Pig and Friar Sand amused themselves looking for flowers and fruit.</P>
<P>Let us tell of the Great Sage who somersaulted into mid air, brought his cloud to a hall and looked back. All he could see coming from the pine forest were auspicious clouds and auras that coiled and spread all around. &#8220;Good, good,&#8221; he found himself saying. Do you know why? He was expressing his admiration for the Tang Priest, the reincarnation of the Venerable Golden Cicada and a holy man who had cultivated his conduct for ten successive lifetimes, which explained there was such an aura of good omen above his head.</P>
<P>&#8220;Five hundred years ago, when I made havoc in heaven,&#8221; Monkey thought, &#8220;I wandered to the very corners of the oceans and ran wild at the end of the sky. I led a host of spirits and called myself the Great Sage Equaling Heaven. We subdued dragons and tigers, and I took us off the registers of death. I used to wear a triple golden crown and a coat of golden mail, and with my gold-banded cudgel in my hands and my cloud-treading shoes on my feet I had 47,000 demons under me. They all used to call me Lord Great Sage. I really was someone in those days. But ever since being rescued from Heaven's punishment I've been a small-time nobody as his disciple. I reckon that as the master has such an aura of auspicious clouds over his head things are sure to turn out well for us on our way back to the East and I'm bound to win the true achievement.&#8221;</P>
<P>As Brother Monkey was congratulating himself along these lines he saw a column of black vapor rising from the South of the forest. &#8220;That black vapor means evil for sure,&#8221; he thought with alarm. &#8220;No black vapors could come from our Pig or Friar Sand.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>While the Great Sage was still trying to make out exactly what the vapors were coming from, Sanzang was sitting in the forest clarifying his mind and contemplating the Buddha-nature as he recited the<I> Mahaprajnaparamita Heart Sutra</I> when suddenly he heard a high-pitched cry of &#8220;Help!&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is all very well,&#8221; said Sanzang with astonishment, &#8220;but who could that be calling so deep in the forest?&#8221; It must be someone terrified by a wolf, a tiger, a leopard or some other wild beast. I shall go to take a look.&#8221; The venerable elder rose to his feet and walked through the thousand-year-old cypresses and even more ancient pines, holding on to vines and creepers, as he went close enough to see a woman tied to a big tree. The top half of her body was bound to the trunk with creepers and her lower half buried in the ground. Sanzang stopped to ask, &#8220;Why are you tied up here, lady Bodhisattva?&#8221;</P>
<P>It was quite obvious that the wretched creature was an evil monster, but with his mortal eyes in a worldling's body Sanzang was unable to perceive this. The monster's response to the question was to weep copiously. Just look at the tears rolling down her peachy cheeks. She was so lovely that fish would have sunk and wild geese fallen out of the sky at the sight of her; the beauty of her sorrowing and sparkling eyes would have made the moon hide away and put the flowers to shame. Sanzang did not dare go any closer to her as he opened his mouth to ask, &#8220;What crime have you committed, lady Bodhisattva? Tell me so that I can rescue you.&#8221;</P>
<P>The evil spirit then quickly put together a pack of lies as she replied, &#8220;Master, my home is in the country of Pinpo, which is some seventy miles from here. Both my parents are at home, and they are very great lovers of goodness. All their lives they have been on good terms with their relations and devoted to their friends. At the Clear and Bright Festival they invited all their relations and members of their own family to pay their respects at and sweep the ancestral graves. A whole procession of carrying-chairs and horses all went to the graves in the wilds outside the city. Here we set out our offerings and had just burnt the paper models of horses when a band of brigands sprang upon us with the sound of gongs and drums. They charged us shouting 'kill!' My parents and relations all got hold of horses and carrying-chairs and fled for their lives. Because I am so young I was too frightened to run: I just collapsed and was carried back to the mountains by the brigands. The top chieftain wanted me for his lady, the number two chieftain wanted me for his woman, and the third and fourth ones both fancied me for my looks. There were seventy or eighty of them all quarrelling over me and none of them would give way. So they tied me up here in the forest and broke up the band. I've been here for five days and five nights now and I'm only just alive now. I'll soon be dead. Goodness only knows which ancestor however many generations back accumulated the virtue that brought you here to me today, reverend sir. I beg you in your great mercy to save my life. I won't forget your goodness to me even when I lie dead under the nine springs of the underworld.&#8221; When she had finished speaking her tears flowed like rain.</P>
<P>As Sanzang really did have a merciful heart he could not help weeping and sobbing himself. &#8220;Disciples,&#8221; he shouted. Pig and Friar Sand were still looking for flowers and fruit in the forest when suddenly they heard their master's anguished cry.</P>
<P>&#8220;Friar Sand,&#8221; said the idiot, &#8220;the master's found a relation here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What nonsense, brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand with a smile. &#8220;In all the time we've been going we haven't met a single good person, so where could any relation of his have come from?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If it's not a relation why's the master crying for them?&#8221; Pig asked, adding, &#8220;You and I had better go to take a look.&#8221; Friar Sand did indeed go back to where they had been before. Leading the horse and carrying the luggage they went up to the master and asked, &#8220;What's up, Master?&#8221;</P>
<P>The Tang Priest pointed at the tree as he replied, &#8220;Pig, untie this lady Bodhisattva and save her life.&#8221; Without caring whether this was the right or the wrong thing to do, the idiot set to.</P>
<P>The Great Sage meanwhile saw from up in the air the dense black vapors completely obscuring the auspicious glow. &#8220;This is bad,&#8221; he said, &#8220;this is bad. If the black vapors are covering the auspicious glow that means something evil is threatening my master. Never mind about begging for food&#8212;I'm going back to see the master.&#8221; He turned his cloud back and landed in the forest, where he saw Pig recklessly untying the ropes. Going up to him Monkey grabbed an ear and threw him to the ground. &#8220;The master told me to rescue her,&#8221; the idiot protested, looking up to see Monkey as he scrambled back to his feet, &#8220;so why did you push me over like that? You're just throwing your weight about.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; replied Monkey with a smile, &#8220;don't untie her. She's an evil spirit who's been putting on an act to fool us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wretched ape,&#8221; shouted Sanzang, &#8220;talking nonsense again. How can you possibly take a girl like this for an evil spirit?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's something you don't know, Master.&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;In the old days I tried all these tricks myself when I wanted some human flesh. You couldn't possibly tell what she is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Pig, pouting sulkily, &#8220;don't let that Protector of the Horses take you in. She's a local girl. We've never had dealings with her before on our long journey from the East and she's no relation or in-law of ours, so how can you say she's an evil spirit? He's trying to get rid of us by making us go ahead so he can turn a somersault and get back here by magic. Then he's going to have a bit of fun with her and ruin our reputation.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You cretin,&#8221; shouted Brother Monkey, &#8220;stop talking such rubbish. I've never done any such outrageous thing on all our journey to the West. I reckon it must have been some reckless womanizer like yourself who forgot his principles when he saw a good chance. I expect you tricked some family into taking you as their son-in-law and tied her up here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That's enough of that,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;that's enough. Now then, Bajie. Your elder brother usually sees things very clearly. Ignore what he is saying. Let us be on our way.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Splendid,&#8221; said Monkey with great delight, &#8220;you have a good destiny, Master. Please mount. Once we're out of the pine forest there will be a house where we can beg for some food for you.&#8221; The four of them then pressed on together, leaving the monster behind.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story tells how the monster gnashed her teeth with fury as she was left tied there to the tree. &#8220;I've heard tell of Sun Wukong's tremendous magic powers for years,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and now that I've seen him today I know that his reputation's well-founded. As that Tang Priest has been cultivating his conduct ever since he was a boy he has never lost a drop of his primal masculinity. I was longing to mate with him so that I could become a golden immortal of the Supreme Ultimate. I never expected that monkey to see through my magic and save him. If I'd been untied and released I could have carried him off whenever I chose and he'd have been mine. Now that Sun Wukong has made those damaging remarks and taken the Tang Priest away my efforts have all been for nothing. Let's see what happens when I give him another couple of shouts.&#8221;</P>
<P>Not shifting her ropes, the evil spirit made the most of the wind being in the right direction to carry some high-pitched words of morality into the Tang Priest's ear. Do you know what she was shouting? &#8220;Master,&#8221; she called, &#8220;if you forget your conscience and refuse to save a living being's life what's the use of your fetching the scriptures from the Buddha?&#8221;</P>
<P>When the Tang Priest heard this call he reined the horse in and said, &#8220;Wukong, go and rescue that girl.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've started on your way, Master,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;What made you think of her again?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;She is shouting again there,&#8221; the Tang Priest said.</P>
<P>&#8220;Did you hear, Pig?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;My big lugs cover my ear-holes,&#8221; Pig replied, &#8220;and I didn't hear anything.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Did you hear, Friar Sand?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I was walking ahead, carrying the pole with the luggage,&#8221; Friar Sand replied. &#8220;I wasn't paying attention and I didn't hear anything either.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Neither did I,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;What did she say, Master? You were the only one who heard.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What she called was quite right,&#8221; the Tang Priest called. &#8220;She asked what was the use of fetching scriptures when I went to visit the Buddha if I forgot my conscience and refused to save a living being's life. To save a human life is better than building a seven-storied pagoda. Rescuing her straight away would be even better than worshipping the Buddha and fetching the scriptures.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you're wanting to be charitable, Master,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;you're incurable. Just think of all the demons you've met in all the mountains you've crossed on your journey West since leaving the East. They've often taken you into their caves and I've had to rescue you. I've killed tens of thousands of them with this iron cudgel of mine. So why can't you bring yourself to let a single devil die today? Why do you have to rescue her?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; the Tang Priest replied, &#8220;there's an old saying, 'Do not fail to do a good deed because it is small; do not commit a bad deed because it is small.' You're still to go and save her.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If that's the way you're going to be, Master, I can't accept that responsibility,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;You insist on rescuing her and I dare not try too hard to dissuade you. When I did make a little attempt to do so you lost your temper again. You can go and rescue her if you want to.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Watch your tongue, ape,&#8221; Sanzang retorted. &#8220;Sit here while Bajie and I go to rescue her.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Tang Priest went back into the forest and told Pig to undo the ropes around the top half of her body and dig the lower half out with his rake. The demon stamped her feet, fastened her skirt and happily followed the Tang Priest out of the pine forest. When she met Monkey all he did was to wear a mocking smile.</P>
<P>&#8220;Impudent ape,&#8221; said the Tang Priest abusively, &#8220;what are you smiling at?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm laughing at you,&#8221; Monkey replied:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;You meet up with good friends when your luck is going well;</P>
<P>And when it's going badly you find yourself a belle.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Impudent macaque!&#8221; said Sanzang, being abusive again. &#8220;What nonsense! I have been a monk ever since I came out of my mother's womb. I am now making this journey West at His Majesty's command with the devout intention of worshipping the Buddha and fetching the scriptures. I am not the sort of person to care about wealth and office, so what do you mean by my luck going badly?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; replied Monkey with a grin, &#8220;you may have been a monk since you were a child, and you may be good at reading sutras and invoking the Buddha, but you have never studied the text of royal laws. This girl is young and beautiful. If monks like us travel with her we may well meet with evil people who arrest us and turn us in to the authorities. They won't care about worshipping Buddhas or fetching scriptures. They'll treat it as a case of illicit sex, and even if that isn't proved we'll still be convicted of abduction. You will lose your ordination license, Master, and be beaten half to death. Pig will be sent into exile and Friar Sand sentenced to penal servitude. Even I won't get off scot-free. No matter how I try to talk my way out of it I'll still be found guilty of wrongdoing.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't talk such rubbish,&#8221; Sanzang shouted. &#8220;After all, I did save her life. There will be no trouble. We are taking her with us. I will be responsible for whatever happens.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You may say you'll be responsible, Master,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;but what you don't realize is that so far from rescuing her you're destroying her.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I saved her life by rescuing her from the forest,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;so how can I be destroying her?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If she had stayed tied up in the forest without any food for three to five days, ten days or even half a month and starved to death,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;she would at least have gone to the Underworld with her body in one piece. But now you've taken her away from there. You're on a fast horse and travelling like the wind. The rest of us have to follow you. How will she be able to keep up on her tiny feet? She can barely walk. If she gets left behind and a wolf, a tiger or a leopard eats her up you'll have killed her.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; Sanzang said. &#8220;Thank you for thinking of it. What are we to do about it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Lift her up and let her ride on the horse with you,&#8221; replied Monkey with a grin.</P>
<P>&#8220;I could not possibly ride on the same horse as her,&#8221; moaned Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;Then how is she to travel?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;Bajie can carry her on his back,&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;You're in luck, idiot,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no such thing as a light load on a long journey,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;Having to carry her isn't luck.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;With your long snout you'll be able to turn it round and chat her up on the quiet while you're carrying her,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;which will be very convenient for you.&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig's reaction to hearing this was to beat his chest and jump about in fury. &#8220;That's terrible,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that's terrible, I'd sooner put up with the pain of a flogging from the master. If I carry her I won't possibly come out of it clean. You've always been a slanderer. I'm not carrying her.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well then,&#8221; Sanzang said, &#8220;very well then. I can walk a little further. I shall come down and walk slowly with you. Bajie can lead the horse with nobody riding it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've got yourself a good bargain there, idiot,&#8221; said Monkey, roaring with laughter. &#8220;The master's done you a favour by letting you lead the horse.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You are talking nonsense again, ape,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;As the ancients said, 'When a horse is to travel three hundred miles it cannot get there by itself.' If I walk slowly are you going to leave me behind? When I go slowly you will have to go slowly too. We shall all take the lady Bodhisattva down the mountain together. We can leave her in some convent, temple, monastery or house that we come to. Then we will still have rescued her.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right, Master,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Let's press on quickly.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang took the lead while Friar Sand carried the luggage, Pig led the riderless horse and the girl, and Monkey carried his iron cudgel as they carried on together. Within seven to ten miles the evening was drawing in and a tall building came into sight.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;that must be a temple of some sort. We shall ask to spend the night here and be on our way first thing tomorrow.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What you say is right, Master,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Let's all get a move on.&#8221;</P>
<P>They were soon at the gates, where Sanzang told them, &#8220;Keep well out of the way while I go in first to ask if we can stay for the night. If it looks suitable I shall send someone to call to you.&#8221; So they all stood in the shadows of the poplars while Monkey kept an eye on the girl, his iron cudgel in his hand.</P>
<P>The venerable elder walked forward to see that the gates were hanging crooked and falling to pieces. What he saw when he pushed the gates open chilled him to the heart:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The cloisters were deserted,</P>
<P>The ancient shrine left desolate.</P>
<P>The courtyard was overgrown with moss;</P>
<P>Sagebrush and brambles choked the paths.</P>
<P>The only lanterns came from the fireflies</P>
<P>While the croaking of frogs had replaced the water-clock.</P>
<P>The venerable elder started crying. Indeed:</P>
<P>The desolate halls were falling down,</P>
<P>The lonely cloisters collapsing.</P>
<P>Broken bricks and tiles lay in a dozen heaps,</P>
<P>And all the pillars and beams were askew.</P>
<P>Grass was growing all around;</P>
<P>The kitchens were crumbling and buried in dust.</P>
<P>In derelict towers the drums had lost their skins;</P>
<P>Broken was the glass lamp.</P>
<P>The color had gone from the Buddha's golden statue;</P>
<P>The figures of arhats lay strewn upon the floor.</P>
<P>Guanyin had turned to mud in the soaking rain,</P>
<P>Her pure vase with a willow spray fallen to the ground.</P>
<P>No monk was to be seen there by day,</P>
<P>And only foxes slept there at night.</P>
<P>As the wind roared with the sound of thunder</P>
<P>This was a place for tiger and leopard to shelter.</P>
<P>The walls around had collapsed</P>
<P>And no gates could be closed to guard it.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>There is a poem about this that goes</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>For many a year had the temple been unrepaired;</P>
<P>In its derelict state it had gone from bad to worse.</P>
<P>The gales had destroyed the faces of the temple guardians,</P>
<P>And rainstorms had washed the heads off the Buddha statues.</P>
<P>The vajrapani had collapsed and been soaked through.</P>
<P>The local god had lost his shrine and stayed outside at night.</P>
<P>Two other things were even more depressing:</P>
<P>Bell and drums lay on the ground instead of hanging in their towers.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Summoning up his courage, Sanzang went in through the inner gates where he saw that the bell-tower and drum-tower had both collapsed, leaving only a single bronze bell planted in the ground, its bottom half the color of indigo. With the passage of the years the top half of the bell had been bleached in the rain while the earth's vapors had greened the lower part.</P>
<P>&#8220;Bell,&#8221; Sanzang called aloud as he touched it,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Once you roared from high in the tower,</P>
<P>Calling afar from the painted beam where you hung.</P>
<P>At cockcrow you used to ring in the dawn,</P>
<P>And at evening you announced the dusk.</P>
<P>Where now are the lay brothers who begged for the copper,</P>
<P>Or the craftsman who cast it to form you?</P>
<P>Both, I imagine, are now in the Underworld;</P>
<P>They have gone without trace and you are left silent.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The venerable elder's loud sighs had by now disturbed someone in the monastery. A lay brother who was offering incense heard the voice, climbed to his feet, picked up a broken brick and threw it at the bell. The bell's clang gave the venerable elder such a fright that he fell over then scrambled up again to flee, only to trip over the root of a tree and go flying again.</P>
<P>As he lay on the ground Sanzang raised his head and said, &#8220;Bell,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I was just lamenting your fate</P>
<P>When suddenly you clanged.</P>
<P>On this deserted route to the West</P>
<P>Over the years you have turned into a spirit.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The lay brother came over to Sanzang and steadied him as he said, &#8220;Please get up, reverend sir. The bell hasn't become a spirit. It was I who struck it just now.&#8221; Looking up and seeing how dark and ugly the other was Sanzang said, &#8220;I suppose you are a goblin or some other evil creature. I am no ordinary man. I come from Great Tang and I have disciples who can subdue dragons and tigers. If you run into them your life will be lost.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be afraid, my lord,&#8221; replied the lay brother, falling to his knees. I'm no evil being. I'm a lay brother who looks after the incense here. When I heard those fine things you were saying just now I wanted to come out and welcome you but I was afraid that it might be some demon knocking at the gates. That was why I didn't dare come out until I'd thrown a piece of brick at the bell to calm my fears. Please rise, my lord.&#8221;</P>
<P>Only then did Sanzang calm himself sufficiently to reply, &#8220;Lay brother, that fright was almost the death of me. Take me inside.&#8221; The lay brother led Sanzang straight in through the third pair of gates. What the Tang Priest saw here was quite different from outside:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A cloud-patterned wall built of blue bricks,</P>
<P>Halls roofed with green glazed tiles.</P>
<P>The holy statues were sheathed in gold,</P>
<P>The steps made of pure white jade.</P>
<P>Blue light danced in the Buddha hall;</P>
<P>Fine vapors rose from the Vairocana chapel.</P>
<P>Above the Manjusri hall</P>
<P>Were decorations of flying clouds;</P>
<P>In the Library of Scriptures</P>
<P>Were patterns of flowers and green leaves.</P>
<P>On the roof above the triple eaves stood a precious jar;</P>
<P>In the Tower of Five Blessings embroidered covers were spread.</P>
<P>A thousand bright bamboos waved over the dhyana seat;</P>
<P>Ten thousand bluish pines threw their light on the gates.</P>
<P>Jade-coloured clouds reflected gold on this palace;</P>
<P>Auspicious clouds drifted round the woods full of purple mist.</P>
<P>Each morning the fragrant breezes could be smelled all around;</P>
<P>In the evening painted drums were heard on the high hills.</P>
<P>There should be morning sunshine to patch torn robes;</P>
<P>How can the sutra be finished by the light of the moon?</P>
<P>The courtyard at the back is lit by half a wall of lamps;</P>
<P>A column of fragrant smoke shines in the hall.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sanzang saw this but did not dare go inside. &#8220;Lay brother,&#8221; he called, &#8220;why is the front of the monastery so dilapidated but the back so neat and tidy?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; said the lay brother with a smile, &#8220;these mountains are full of evil creatures and brigands. On clear days they roam the mountains to rob and on dull ones they shelter in the monastery. They knock the Buddha statues down to use as seats and burn the wooden pillars for firewood. The monks here are too feeble to argue with them, which is why they have abandoned the wrecked buildings at the front for the brigands to stay in. They have found some new benefactors to build the new monastery for them. Now there is one for the pure and one for the impure. This is how we do things in the West.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;So that is the way things are,&#8221; said Sanzang.</P>
<P>As he walked further Sanzang saw written over the gate in large letters SEA-GUARDING MONASTERY OF MEDITATION. Only then did he stride in through the gates, where a monk appeared coming towards him. Just see what the monk looked like:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>His hat of velvet and brocade was held with a pin,</P>
<P>And a pair of bronze rings hung from his ears.</P>
<P>His tunic was made of woolen stuff,</P>
<P>And his eyes were white and bright as silver.</P>
<P>He held in his hand a self-beating drum</P>
<P>As he recited scriptures in an unknown tongue.</P>
<P>Sanzang did not know before</P>
<P>That he was a lama on the road to the West.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As the lama came out he saw how very handsome and elegant Sanzang was: clear-browed and fine-eyed with a broad forehead and level top to his skull, ears hanging to his shoulders and arms so long they came below his knees. He looked like an arhat come down to earth. The lama, his face wreathed in smiles, went up to Sanzang chuckling with delight to grab hold of him, feel his hands and feet, rub his nose and tug at his ears as ways of showing his friendliness.</P>
<P>After leading Sanzang into the abbot's lodgings and going through the rituals of greeting the lama asked him, &#8220;Where have you come from, venerable Father?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have been sent by His Majesty the Emperor of Great Tang in the East to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures from Thunder Monastery in India in the West,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;As we were passing this way when it was becoming dark I have come to your distinguished monastery to put up here for the night before leaving early tomorrow morning. I beg you to grant me this expeditious help.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You shouldn't say that,&#8221; replied the lama with a smile, &#8220;you shouldn't say that. We didn't really want to become monks. We were all given life by our mothers and fathers and only cut our ties with them because we had unlucky destinies and our families could not afford to keep us. Even though we are now disciples of the Buddhist faith you must not talk empty words.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I spoke in all sincerity,&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;However far is the journey from the East to the Western Heaven?&#8221; the monk said. &#8220;Along the way there are mountains, there are caves in the mountains and there are spirits in the caves. I don't think that a lone traveler looking as delicate as you could possibly be a pilgrim going to fetch the scriptures.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You are quite right, abbot,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;I could never have got here alone. I have three disciples who clear my way across the mountains and build me bridges over rivers. It is only because they have protected me that I have been able to reach your monastery.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are your three distinguished disciples?&#8221; the lama asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Waiting outside the gates of the monastery,&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Father,&#8221; said the lama with alarm, &#8220;you don't realize that there are dangerous tigers, wolves, evil bandits, ghosts and demons here. We don't dare roam far even by day and we shut the gates before nightfall. How can you leave people outside this late?&#8221; He then told his disciples to ask them in at once.</P>
<P>Two young lamas hurried outside. At the sight of Monkey they fell over, and then fell over again when they saw Pig. Scrambling to their feet they ran back in as fast as they could and said, &#8220;My lord, your luck is out. Your disciples have disappeared. There are only three or four evil monsters standing outside the gates.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do they look like?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;One has a face like a thunder god,&#8221; the young lamas replied, &#8220;one has a face like a tilt-hammer, and one has a green face and terrible fangs. There is a girl with them too&#8212;she has oiled hair and a powdered face.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You would not know who they are,&#8221; replied Sanzang with a smile. &#8220;The three ugly ones are my disciples and the girl is someone I rescued in the pine forest.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; the lama said, &#8220;how can a master as handsome as you have found yourself such ugly disciples?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Ugly they may be,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;but they are all useful. Ask them in straight away. If you take any longer the one who looks like a thunder god is a bit of a trouble-maker. He was not born to a mother and father and he will fight his way in.&#8221;</P>
<P>The young lamas then hurried outside again and fell to their knees, shivering and shaking, as they said, &#8220;My lords, Lord Tang invites you in.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;if he's invited us, that's that. Why are they shivering and shaking?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;They're scared because we're so ugly,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Rubbish,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;We were born that way. None of us is ugly from choice.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Make yourself look a bit less ugly,&#8221; said Monkey, and the idiot really did tuck his snout into his tunic and keep his head down as he led the horse while Friar Sand carried the pole and Brother Monkey brought up the rear, holding his cudgel in his hand and dragging the girl along. They went past the ruined buildings and cloisters and in through the third part of gates. When they had tethered the horse they went into the abbot's lodgings to meet the lama and take their seats in order of precedence. The lama then went inside to lead seventy or eighty young lamas to greet them, tidy their rooms, give them a vegetarian meal and look after them. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In storing up achievement be mindful of mercy;</P>
<P>When the Buddha's Dharma flourishes monks admire each other.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you do not know how they left the monastery, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>姹女育阳求配偶</p>
<p>心猿护主识妖邪</p>
</div>
<p>却说比丘国君臣黎庶，送唐僧四众出城，有二十里之远，还不肯舍。三藏勉强下辇，乘马辞别而行，目送者直至望不见踪影方回。四众行彀多时，又过了冬残春尽，看不了野花山树，景物芳菲，前面又见一座高山峻岭。三藏心惊问道：“徒弟，前面高山，有路无路，是必小心！”行者笑道：“师父这话，也不象个走长路的，却似个公子王孙，坐井观天之类。自古道：山不碍路，路自通山。何以言有路无路？”三藏道：“虽然是山不碍路，但恐险峻之间生怪物，密林深处出妖精。”八戒道：“放心，放心！这里来相近极乐不远，管取太平无事！”师徒正说，不觉的到了山脚下。行者取出金箍棒，走上石崖叫道：“师父，此间乃转山的路儿，忒好步，快来快来！”长老只得放怀策马。沙僧教：</p>

<p>“二哥，你把担子挑一肩儿。”真个八戒接了担子挑上。沙僧拢着缰绳，老师父稳坐雕鞍，随行者都奔山崖上大路。但见那山：</p>

<p>云雾笼峰顶，潺湲涌涧中。百花香满路，万树密丛丛。梅青李白，柳绿桃红。杜鹃啼处春将暮，紫燕呢喃社已终。峨峨石，翠盖松。崎岖岭道，突兀玲珑。削壁悬崖峻，藤萝草木秾。千岩竞秀如排戟，万壑争流远浪洪。老师父缓观山景，忽闻啼鸟之声，又起思乡之念。兜马叫道：“徒弟！我自天牌传旨意，锦屏风下领关文。观灯十五离东土，才与唐王天地分，甫能龙虎风云会，却又师徒拗马军。行尽巫山峰十二，何时对子见当今？”</p>

<p>行者道：“师父，你常以思乡为念，全不似个出家人。放心且走，莫要多忧，古人云，欲求生富贵，须下死工夫。”三藏道：“徒弟，虽然说得有理，但不知西天路还在那里哩！”八戒道：“师父，我佛如来舍不得那三藏经，知我们要取去，想是搬了；不然，如何只管不到？”沙僧道：“莫胡谈！只管跟着大哥走，只把工夫捱他，终须有个到之之日。”</p>

<p>师徒正自闲叙，又见一派黑松大林。唐僧害怕，又叫道：</p>

<p>“悟空，我们才过了那崎岖山路，怎么又遇这个深黑松林？是必在意。”行者道：“怕他怎的！”三藏道：“说那里话！不信直中直，须防仁不仁。我也与你走过好几处松林，不似这林深远。你看：</p>

<p>东西密摆，南北成行。东西密摆彻云霄，南北成行侵碧汉。密查荆棘周围结，蓼却缠枝上下盘。藤来缠葛，葛去缠藤。藤来缠葛，东西客旅难行；葛去缠藤，南北经商怎进。这林中，住半年，那分日月；行数里，不见斗星。你看那背阴之处千般景，向阳之所万丛花。又有那千年槐，万载桧，耐寒松，山桃果、野芍药，旱芙蓉，一攒攒密砌重堆，乱纷纷神仙难画。又听得百鸟声：鹦鹉哨，杜鹃啼，喜鹊穿枝，乌鸦反哺，黄鹂飞舞，百舌调音，鹧鸪鸣，紫燕语，八哥儿学人说话，画眉郎也会看经。又见那大虫摆尾，老虎磕牙，多年狐狢妆娘子，日久苍狼吼振林。就是托塔天王来到此，纵会降妖也失魂！”孙大圣公然不惧，使铁棒上前臂开大路，引唐僧径入深林，逍逍遥遥，行经半日，未见出林之路。唐僧叫道：“徒弟，一向西来，无数的山林崎险，幸得此间清雅，一路太平。这林中奇花异卉，其实可人情意！我要在此坐坐：一则歇马，二则腹中饥了，你去那里化些斋来我吃。”行者道：“师父请下马，老孙化斋去来。”那长老果然下了马。八戒将马拴在树上，沙僧歇下行李，取了钵盂，递与行者。</p>

<p>行者道：“师父稳坐，莫要惊怕，我去了就来。”三藏端坐松阴之下，八戒沙僧却去寻风觅果闲耍。</p>

<p>却说大圣纵筋斗，到了半空，伫定云光，回头观看，只见松林中祥云缥缈，瑞霭氤氲，他忽失声叫道：“好啊！好啊！”你道他叫好做甚？原来夸奖唐僧，说他是金蝉长老转世，十世修行的好人，所以有此祥瑞罩头。“若我老孙，方五百年前大闹天宫之时，云游海角，放荡天涯，聚群精自称齐天大圣，降龙伏虎，消了死籍；头戴着三额金冠，身穿着黄金铠甲，手执着金箍棒，足踏着步云履，手下有四万七千群怪，都称我做大圣爷爷，着实为人。如今脱却天灾。做小伏低，与你做了徒弟，想师父头顶上有祥云瑞霭罩定，径回东土，必定有些好处，老孙也必定得个正果。”正自家这等夸念中间，忽然见林南下有一股子黑气，骨都都的冒将上来。行者大惊道：“那黑气里必定有邪了！</p>

<p>我那八戒沙僧却不会放甚黑气。”那大圣在半空中，详察不定。</p>

<p>却说三藏坐在林中，明心见性，讽念那《摩诃般若波罗密多心经》，忽听得嘤嘤的叫声“救人”。三藏大惊道：“善哉！善哉！这等深林里，有甚么人叫？想是狼虫虎豹唬倒的，待我看看。”那长老起身挪步，穿过千年柏，隔起万年松，附葛攀藤，近前视之，只见那大树上绑着一个女子，上半截使葛藤绑在树上，下半截埋在土里。长老立定脚，问他一句道：“女菩萨，你有甚事，绑在此间？”咦！分明这厮是个妖怪，长老肉眼凡胎，却不能认得。那怪见他来问，泪如泉涌。你看他桃腮垂泪，有沉鱼落雁之容；星眼含悲，有闭月羞花之貌。长老实不敢近前，又开口问道：“女菩萨，你端的有何罪过？说与贫僧，却好救你。”那妖精巧语花言，虚情假意，忙忙的答应道：“师父，我家住在贫婆国。离此有二百余里。父母在堂，十分好善，一生的和亲爱友。时遇清明，邀请诸亲及本家老小拜扫先茔，一行轿马，都到了荒郊野外。至茔前，摆开祭礼，刚烧化纸马，只闻得锣鸣鼓响，跑出一伙强人，持刀弄杖，喊杀前来，慌得我们魂飞魄散。</p>

<p>父母诸亲，得马得轿的，各自逃了性命；奴奴年幼，跑不动，唬倒在地，被众强人拐来山内，大大王要做夫人，二大王要做妻室，第三第四个都爱我美色，七八十家一齐争吵，大家都不忿气，所以把奴奴绑在林间，众强人散盘而去。今已五日五夜，看看命尽，不久身亡！不知是那世里祖宗积德，今日遇着老师父到此。千万发大慈悲，救我一命，九泉之下，决不忘恩！”说罢，泪下如雨。三藏真个慈心，也就忍不住吊下泪来，声音哽咽，叫道：“徒弟”。那八戒沙僧正在林中寻花觅果，猛听得师父叫得凄怆，呆子道：“沙和尚，师父在此认了亲耶。”沙僧笑道：“二哥胡缠！我们走了这些时，好人也不曾撞见一个，亲从何来？”八戒道：“不是亲，师父那里与人哭么？我和你去看来。”沙僧真个回转旧处，牵了马，挑了担，至跟前叫：“师父，怎么说？”唐僧用手指定那树上，叫：“八戒，解下那女菩萨来，救他一命。”呆子不分好歹，就去动手。</p>

<p>却说那大圣在半空中，又见那黑气浓厚，把祥光尽情盖了，道声：“不好，不好！黑气罩暗祥光，怕不是妖邪害俺师父！</p>

<p>化斋还是小事，且去看我师父去。”即返云头，按落林里，只见八戒乱解绳儿。行者上前，一把揪住耳朵，扑的捽了一跌。呆子抬头看见，爬起来说道：“师父教我救人，你怎么恃你有力，将我掼这一跌！”行者笑道：“兄弟，莫解他。他是个妖怪，弄喧儿骗我们哩。”三藏喝道：“你这泼猴，又来胡说了！怎么这等一个女子，就认得他是个妖怪！”行者道：“师父原来不知。这都是老孙干过的买卖，想人肉吃的法儿，你那里认得！”八戒唝着嘴道：“师父，莫信这弼马温哄你！这女子乃是此间人家。我们东土远来，不与相较，又不是亲眷，如何说他是妖精！他打发我们丢了前去，他却翻筋斗，弄神法转来和他干巧事儿，倒踏门也！”行者喝道：“夯货！莫乱谈！我老孙一向西来，那里有甚惫懒处？似你这个重色轻生，见利忘义的馕糟，不识好歹，替人家哄了招女婿，绑在树上哩！”三藏道：“也罢，也罢。八戒啊，你师兄常时也看得不差。既这等说，不要管他，我们去罢。”行者大喜道：“好了！师父是有命的了！请上马，出松林外，有人家化斋你吃。”四人果一路前进，把那怪撇了。</p>

<p>却说那怪绑在树上，咬牙恨齿道：“几年家闻人说孙悟空神通广大，今日见他，果然话不虚传。那唐僧乃童身修行，一点元阳未泄，正欲拿他去配合，成太乙金仙，不知被此猴识破吾法，将他救去了。若是解了绳，放我下来，随手捉将去，却不是我的人儿也？今被他一篇散言碎语带去，却又不是劳而无功？</p>

<p>等我再叫他两声，看是如何。”好妖精，不动绳索，把几声善言善语，用一阵顺风，嘤嘤的吹在唐僧耳内。你道叫的甚么？他叫道：“师父啊，你放着活人的性命还不救，昧心拜佛取何经？”</p>

<p>唐僧在马上听得又这般叫唤，即勒马叫：“悟空，去救那女子下来罢。”行者道：“师父走路，怎么又想起他来了？”唐僧道：“他又在那里叫哩。”行者问：“八戒，你听见么？”八戒道：“耳大遮住了，不曾听见。”又问：“沙僧，你听见么？”沙僧道：“我挑担前走，不曾在心，也不曾听见。”行者道：“老孙也不曾听见。师父，他叫甚么？偏你听见。”唐僧道：“他叫得有理，说道活人性命还不救，昧心拜佛取何经？救人一命，胜造七级浮屠。快去救他下来，强似取经拜佛。”行者笑道：“师父要善将起来，就没药医。你想你离了东土，一路西来，却也过了几重山场，遇着许多妖怪，常把你拿将进洞，老孙来救你，使铁棒，常打死千千万万；今日一个妖精的性命舍不得，要去救他？”唐僧道：“徒弟呀，古人云，勿以善小而不为，勿以恶小而为之，还去救他救罢。”行者道：“师父既然如此，只是这个担儿，老孙却担不起。</p>

<p>你要救他，我也不敢苦劝你，劝一会，你又恼了。任你去救。”唐僧道：“猴头莫多话！你坐着，等我和八戒救他去。”</p>

<p>唐僧回至林里，教八戒解了上半截绳子，用钯筑出下半截身子。那怪跌跌鞋，束束裙，喜孜孜跟着唐僧出松林，见了行者，行者只是冷笑不止。唐僧骂道：“泼猴头！你笑怎的？”行者道：“我笑你时来逢好友，运去遇佳人。”三藏又骂道：“泼猢狲！</p>

<p>胡说！我自出娘肚皮，就做和尚。如今奉旨西来，虔心礼佛求经，又不是利禄之辈，有甚运退时！”行者笑道：“师父，你虽是自幼为僧，却只会看经念佛，不曾见王法条律。这女子生得年少标致，我和你乃出家人，同他一路行走，倘或遇着歹人，把我们拿送官司，不论甚么取经拜佛，且都打做奸情；纵无此事，也要问个拐带人口。师父追了度牒，打个小死；八戒该问充军；沙僧也问摆站；我老孙也不得干净，饶我口能，怎么折辩，也要问个不应。”三藏喝道：“莫胡说！终不然，我救他性命，有甚贻累不成！带了他去，凡有事，都在我身上。”行者道：“师父虽说有事在你，却小知你不是救他，反是害他。”三藏道：“我救他出林，得其活命，怎么反是害他？”行者道：“他当时绑在林间，或三五日，十日半月，没饭吃饿死了，还得个完全身体归阴；如今带他出来，你坐得是个快马，行路如风，我们只得随你，那女子脚小，挪步艰难，怎么跟得上走？一时把他丢下，若遇着狼虫虎豹，一口吞之，却不是反害其生也？”三藏道：“正是呀，这件事却亏你想，如何处置？”行者笑道：“抱他上来，和你同骑着马走罢。”三藏沉吟道：“我那里好与他同马！……他怎生得去？”三藏道：“教八戒驮他走罢。”行者笑道：“呆子造化到了！”八戒道：“远路没轻担，教我驮人，有甚造化？”行者道：“你那嘴长，驮着他，转过嘴来，计较私情话儿，却不便益？”八戒闻此言，捶胸爆跳道：“不好！不好！师父要打我几下，宁可忍疼，背着他决不得干净，师兄一生会赃埋人。我驮不成！”三藏道：“也罢，也罢。我也还走得几步，等我下来，慢慢的同走，着八戒牵着空马罢。”行者大笑道：“呆子倒有买卖，师父照顾你牵马哩。”三藏道：“这猴头又胡说了！古人云，马行千里，无人不能自往。假如我在路上慢走，你好丢了我去？我若慢，你们也慢。大家一处同这女菩萨走下山去，或到庵观寺院，有人家之处，留他在那里，也是我们救他一场。”行者道：“师父说得有理，快请前进。”三藏拽步前走，沙僧挑担，八戒牵着空马，行者拿着棒，引着女子，一行前进。不上二三十里，天色将晚，又见一座楼台殿阁。三藏道：“徒弟，那里必定是座庵观寺院，就此借宿了，明日早行。”行者道：“师父说得是，各各走动些。”霎时到了门首。吩咐道：“你们略站远些，等我先去借宿。若有方便处，着人来叫你。”众人俱立在柳阴之下，惟行者拿铁棒，辖着那女子。</p>

<p>长老拽步近前，只见那门东倒西歪，零零落落。推开看时，忍不住心中凄惨：长廊寂静，古刹萧疏；苔藓盈庭，蒿蓁满径；</p>

<p>惟萤火之飞灯，只蛙声而代漏。长老忽然吊下泪来，真个是：殿宇凋零倒塌，廊房寂寞倾颓。断砖破瓦十余堆，尽是些歪梁折柱。前后尽生青草，尘埋朽烂香厨。钟楼崩坏鼓无皮，琉璃香灯破损。佛祖金身没色，罗汉倒卧东西。观音淋坏尽成泥，杨柳净瓶坠地。日内并无僧入，夜间尽宿狐狸，只听风响吼如雷，都是虎豹藏身之处。四下墙垣皆倒，亦无门扇关居。有诗为证，诗曰：多年古刹没人修，狼狈凋零倒更休。猛风吹裂伽蓝面，大雨浇残佛象头。金刚跌损随淋洒，土地无房夜不收。更有两般堪叹处，铜钟着地没悬楼。三藏硬着胆，走进二层门，见那钟鼓楼俱倒了，止有一口铜钟，札在地下。上半截如雪之白，下半截如靛之青，原来是日久年深，上边被雨淋白，下边是土气上的铜青。三藏用手摸着钟，高叫道：“钟啊！你也曾悬挂高楼吼，也曾鸣远彩梁声。也曾鸡啼就报晓，也曾天晚送黄昏。不知化铜的道人归何处，铸铜匠作那边存。想他二命归阴府，他无踪迹你无声。”长老高声赞叹，不觉的惊动寺里之人。那里边有一个侍奉香火的道人，他听见人语，扒起来，拾一块断砖，照钟上打将去。那钟当的响了一声，把个长老唬了一跌，挣起身要走，又绊着树根，扑的又是一跌。长老倒在地下，抬头又叫道：“钟啊！贫僧正然感叹你，忽的叮当响一声。想是西天路上无人到，日久多年变作精。”那道人赶上前，一把搀住道：“老爷请起。不干钟成精之事，却才是我打得钟响。”三藏抬头见他的模样丑黑，道：“你莫是魍魉妖邪？我不是寻常之人，我是大唐来的，我手下有降龙伏虎的徒弟。你若撞着他，性命难存也！”道人跪下道：“老爷休怕，我不是妖邪，我是这寺里侍奉香火的道人。却才听见老爷善言相赞，就欲出来迎接；恐怕是个邪鬼敲门，故此拾一块断砖，把钟打一下压惊，方敢出来。老爷请起。”那唐僧方然正性道：“住持，险些儿唬杀我也，你带我进去。”</p>

<p>那道人引定唐僧，直至三层门里看处，比外边甚是不同，但见那：青砖砌就彩云墙，绿瓦盖成琉璃殿。黄金装圣象，白玉造阶台。大雄殿上舞青光，毗罗阁下生锐气。文殊殿，结采飞云：轮藏堂，描花堆翠。三檐顶上宝瓶尖，五福楼中平绣盖。千株翠竹摇禅榻，万种青松映佛门。碧云宫里放金光，紫雾丛中飘瑞霭。朝闻四野香风远，暮听山高画鼓鸣。应有朝阳补破衲，岂无对月了残经？又只见半壁灯光明后院，一行香雾照中庭。</p>

<p>三藏见了不敢进去，叫：“道人，你这前边十分狼狈，后边这等齐整，何也？”道人笑道：“老爷，这山中多有妖邪强寇，天色清明，沿山打劫，天阴就来寺里藏身，被他把佛象推倒垫坐，木植搬来烧火。本寺僧人软弱，不敢与他讲论，因此把这前边破房都舍与那些强人安歇，从新另化了些施主，盖得那一所寺院。</p>

<p>清混各一，这是西方的事情。”三藏道：“原来是如此。</p>

<p>正行间，又见山门上有五个大字，乃镇海禅林寺。才举步跨入门里，忽见一个和尚走来。你看他怎生模样：头戴左笄绒锦帽，一对铜圈坠耳根。身着颇罗毛线服，一双白眼亮如银。手中摇着播郎鼓，口念番经听不真。三藏原来不认得，这是西方路上喇嘛僧。那喇嘛和尚走出门来，看见三藏眉清目秀，额阔顶平，耳垂肩，手过膝，好似罗汉临凡，十分俊雅。他走上前扯住，满面笑唏唏的与他捻手捻脚，摸他鼻子，揪他耳朵，以示亲近之意。携至方丈中，行礼毕却问：“老师父何来？”三藏道：“弟子乃东土大唐驾下钦差往西方天竺国大雷音寺拜佛取经者。</p>

<p>适行至宝方天晚，特奔上刹借宿一宵，明日早行，望垂方便一二。”那和尚笑道：“不当人子！不当人子！我们不是好意要出家的，皆因父母生身，命犯华盖，家里养不住，才舍断了出家，既做了佛门弟子，切莫说脱空之话。”三藏道：“我是老实话。”</p>

<p>和尚道：“那东土到西天，有多少路程！路上有山，山中有洞，洞内有精。象你这个单身，又生得娇嫩，那里象个取经的！”三藏道：“院主也见得是，贫僧一人，岂能到此？我有三个徒弟，逢山开路，遇水叠桥，保我弟子，所以到得上刹。”那和尚道：“三位高徒何在？”三藏道：“现在山门外伺候。”那和尚慌了道：“师父，你不知我这里有虎狼、妖贼、鬼怪伤人。白日里不敢远出，未经天晚，就关了门户。这早晚把人放在外边！”叫：“徒弟，快去请将进来。”</p>

<p>有两个小喇嘛儿跑出外去，看见行者唬了一跌，见了八戒又是一跌，扒起来往后飞跑道：“爷爷！造化低了！你的徒弟不见，只有三四个妖怪站在那门首也。”三藏问道：“怎么模样？”</p>

<p>小和尚道：“一个雷公嘴，一个碓挺嘴，一个青脸獠牙。旁有一个女子，倒是个油头粉面。”三藏笑道：“你不认得。那三个丑的，是我徒弟，那一个女子，是我打松林里救命来的。”那喇嘛道：“爷爷呀，这们好俊师父，怎么寻这般丑徒弟？”三藏道：“他丑自丑，却俱有用。你快请他进来，若再迟了些儿，那雷公嘴的有些闯祸，不是个人生父母养的，他就打进来也。”那小和尚即忙跑出，战兢兢的跪下道：“列位老爷，唐老爷请哩。”八戒笑道：“哥啊，他请便罢了，却这般战兢兢的，何也？”行者道：“看见我们丑陋害怕。”八戒道：“可是扯淡！我们乃生成的，那个是好要丑哩！”行者道：“把那丑且略收拾收拾！呆子真个把嘴揣在怀里，低着头，牵着马，沙僧挑着担，行者在后面，拿着棒，辖着那女子，一行进去。穿过了倒塌房廊，入三层门里。拴了马，歇了担，进方丈中，与喇嘛僧相见，分了坐次。那和尚入里边，引出七八十个小喇嘛来，见礼毕，收拾办斋管待。正是：积功须在慈悲念，佛法兴时僧赞僧。毕竟不知怎生离寺，且听下回分解。
