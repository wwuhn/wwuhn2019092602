<P>Searching the Cave to Capture the Fiend They Meet Longevity</P>
<P>The Reigning Monarch Saves the Little Boys</P>
</div>
<P>The story tells how the royal aide dragged the imitation Tang Priest out of the government hostel and marched him, heavily surrounded by royal guardsmen, straight to the gates of the palace, where he said to the eunuch gate officer, &#8220;Please be so good as to report to His Majesty that we have brought the Tang Priest.&#8221; The eunuch officer hurried into the palace to pass this on to the deluded king, who ordered that they be brought in.</P>
<P>All the officials knelt at the foot of the steps to the throne hall, leaving the imitation Tang Priest standing alone in the middle of them.</P>
<P>&#8220;King of Bhiksuland,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;what have you summoned me here to say to me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We are sick with a chronic illness that has dragged on for many a day without any improvement,&#8221; the king replied. &#8220;Now the Elder of the Nation has to our good fortune presented us with a prescription that has been made up. All that is needed now is an adjuvant. The reason we have sent for you, reverend sir, is to ask you for the adjuvant. If we recover we will build a temple to you in which offerings will be made in all four seasons and incense will be burnt to you in perpetuity by our country.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am a man of religion,&#8221; the imitation Tang Priest replied, &#8220;and have brought nothing with me. I do not know what adjuvant the Elder of the Nation has told Your Majesty you need.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your heart, reverend sir,&#8221; the deluded monarch replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;I will be frank with Your Majesty,&#8221; the imitation Tang Priest said. &#8220;I have a number of hearts. I don't know which you want.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Monk,&#8221; pronounced the Elder of the Nation, who was standing beside the king. &#8220;I want your black heart.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well then,&#8221; the imitation Tang Priest replied. &#8220;Produce your knife at once and open up my chest. If there is a black heart there I shall offer it to you obediently.&#8221;</P>
<P>The deluded monarch thanked him delightedly and ordered an official in attendance to bring a small knife with a blade shaped like a cow's ear that was handed to the imitation Tang Priest. Taking the knife, the imitation Tang Priest undid his clothes, thrust out his chest, pressed his left hand against his abdomen and cut the skin of his stomach open with the knife in his right hand. There was a whoosh, and out rolled a whole pile of hearts. The civilian officials all turned pale with fright; the military officers were numbed.</P>
<P>When the Elder of the Nation saw this from inside the throne hall he said, &#8220;This monk is a suspicious-minded character. He has too many hearts.&#8221;</P>
<P>The imitation Tang Priest then held up the hearts one by one, each dripping with blood, for all to see. They included a loyal red heart, a pure white heart, a yellow heart, an avaricious heart, a fame-hungry heart, a jealous heart, a calculating heart, an over-competitive heart, an ambitious heart, an overbearing heart, a murderous heart, a vicious heart, a frightened heart, a cautious heart, a heretical heart and a heart full of indefinable gloom. There was every kind of evil heart except a black one. The deluded ruler was horror-struck, unable to speak until he said in trembling tones, &#8220;Put them away! Put them away!&#8221;</P>
<P>The imitation Tang Priest had taken as much as he could, so he put his magic away and turned back into himself to say to the deluded monarch, &#8220;Your Majesty, you're not at all perceptive. We monks all have good hearts. It's only this Elder of the Nation of yours who has a black heart. His would make a good adjuvant for the medicine. If you don't believe me I'll take his out to show you.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the Elder of the Nation heard this he opened his eyes wide to take a careful look. He saw that the monk's face had changed to something quite different. Heavens! Recognizing him as the Great Sage Monkey who had been so famous five hundred years ago he made a getaway by cloud. Monkey did a somersault and sprang up into mid-air to shout, &#8220;Where do you think you're going? Take this from me!&#8221; The Elder used his stick with a dragon on its head to meet the blow from Monkey's cudgel. The two of them fought a fine battle up in the sky:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The As-You-Will cudgel</P>
<P>And the dragon stick</P>
<P>Making clouds up in the sky.</P>
<P>The Elder of the Nation was really an evil spirit,</P>
<P>Using his fiendish daughter's seductive charms.</P>
<P>The king had made himself ill through his lust;</P>
<P>The monster wanted to butcher the boys.</P>
<P>There was no escape from the Great Sage's divine powers</P>
<P>To catch demons and to rescue their victims.</P>
<P>The cudgel's blows to the head were really vicious;</P>
<P>Splendid was the way in which the stick met them.</P>
<P>They fought so hard that the sky was full of mist,</P>
<P>Casting city and people into darkness and fear.</P>
<P>The souls of civil and military officials went flying;</P>
<P>The faces of the queens and concubines turned pale.</P>
<P>The deluded king tried desperately to hide,</P>
<P>Trembling and shaking, unable to do anything.</P>
<P>The cudgel was as fierce as a tiger from the mountains;</P>
<P>The staff whirled round like a dragon leaving the sea.</P>
<P>Now they made havoc in Bhiksuland</P>
<P>As good and evil were clearly set apart.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the evil spirit had fought over twenty hard rounds with Monkey his dragon staff was no longer a match for the gold-banded cudgel. Feinting with his staff, the spirit turned himself into a beam of cold light and dropped into the inner quarters of the palace to take the demon queen he had presented to the king out through the palace gates with him. She too turned into cold light and disappeared.</P>
<P>Bringing his cloud down, the Great Sage landed in the palace and said to the officials, &#8220;That's a fine Elder of the Nation you have!&#8221; The officials, all bowed to him, thanking the holy monk.</P>
<P>&#8220;No need for that,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Go and see where your deluded king is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When our monarch saw the fighting he hid in terror,&#8221; the officials replied. &#8220;We do not know which of the palaces he is in.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Find him at once,&#8221; Monkey ordered them. &#8220;Perhaps Queen Beauty has carried him off.&#8221; As soon as the officials heard this they rushed with Monkey straight to the rooms of Queen Beauty, ignoring the fact that these were the inner quarters. They were deserted and there was no sign of the king. Queen Beauty was nowhere to be seen either. The queens of the main, the Eastern and the Western palaces and the consorts of the six compounds all came to kowtow in thanks to the Great Sage.</P>
<P>&#8220;Please get up,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;It's too early for thanks now. Go and find your sovereign lord.&#8221;</P>
<P>A little later four or five eunuchs appeared from behind the Hall of Caution supporting the deluded king. All the ministers prostrated themselves on the ground and called out in union, &#8220;Sovereign lord! Sovereign lord! We are grateful that this holy monk came here to uncover the impostor. The Elder of the Nation was an evil spirit and Queen Beauty has vanished too.&#8221; When the king heard this he invited Monkey to come from the inner quarters of the palace to the throne hall, where he kowtowed in thanks to Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Venerable sir,&#8221; he said, &#8220;when you came to court this morning you were so handsome. Why have you made yourself look different now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I can tell you for a fact, Your Majesty,&#8221; replied Monkey with a grin, &#8220;that the one who came this morning was my master Sanzang, the younger brother of the Tang Emperor. I'm his disciple Sun Wukong. There are two more of us disciples, Zhu Wuneng, or Pig, and Sha Wujing, or Friar Sand, who are both now in the government hostel. I turned myself into my master's double and came here to defeat the monster because I knew that you had been deluded by his evil suggestions and were going to take my master's heart to use as an adjuvant for your elixir.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the king heard this he ordered his ministers in attendance to go straight to the hostel to fetch Monkey's master and fellow-disciples. The news that Brother Monkey had turned back into himself and had fought the evil spirit in mid-air gave Sanzang such a fright that his souls scattered. It was lucky that Pig and Friar Sand were able to hold him up. His face was still plastered with stinking mud and he was feeling thoroughly depressed and miserable when he heard someone call, &#8220;Master of the Law, we are ministers in attendance sent by the king of Bhiksuland to invite you to court to receive His Majesty's thanks.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be afraid, master,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;don't be afraid. This time he's not sending for you to take your heart out. I'm sure that elder brother has succeeded and they're inviting you there to thank you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Even if they have come to invite me there because he has succeeded I could not face anyone with this stinking mask on,&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;We've got no option,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;We'll just have to go to see my elder brother. He's bound to have a solution.&#8221; The venerable elder really did have no choice but to go to the main hall of the hostel with Pig and Friar Sand carrying the luggage and leading the horse. When the ministers saw him they were all terrified.</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; they said, &#8220;they both have heads like monsters.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Please don't take offence at our ugliness,&#8221; Friar Sand replied. &#8220;Both of us have the bodies that were left after an earlier life. If my master could see my elder brother he'd become handsome straight away.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the three of them reached the palace they went straight to the throne hall without waiting to be summoned. As soon as Monkey saw them he turned round and came down from the hall to meet them. Pulling the mud mask off his master's face he blew on him with magic breath, called &#8220;Change!&#8221; and turned the Tang Priest back into himself. Sanzang was now in better spirits. The king came down from the throne hall to greet him as &#8220;Master of the Law&#8221; and &#8220;ancient Buddha.&#8221; Master and disciples then tethered the horse and went into the throne hall to be presented.</P>
<P>&#8220;Does Your Majesty know where the monsters came from?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;Let me go and catch them both for you. Then we will have eliminated future catastrophe.&#8221;</P>
<P>When all the queens, consorts and concubines of the three palaces and six compounds, who were behind the screen of bright green jade, heard Monkey saying that he was going to eliminate future catastrophe they cast aside all their inhibitions about appearing in front of an outsider, and a male one at that, as they came out to bow to him and say, &#8220;We beg you, holy monk and venerable Buddha, to destroy them completely, root and branch, with your dharma powers. That would be an act of the greatest kindness, and we would of course reward you richly.&#8221; Quickly responding to their bows Monkey insisted that the king tell him where the monsters lived.</P>
<P>&#8220;We asked him when he came here three years ago,&#8221; the king replied shamefacedly, &#8220;and he told us that it was only some twenty miles to the South of the city, in Pure Splendor Grange on Willow Slope. The Elder of the Nation was old and had no son, only the daughter that his second wife had given him. She was just fifteen and unmarried. He offered to present her to us, and because we fancied the girl we accepted her. She was the favorite among all the palace women. We never expected that we would fall so ill that all the prescriptions of the Royal College of Physicians would be of no avail. Then he told us that he had a formula for an elixir for which a decoction of boiled little boys' hearts was needed as the adjuvant. In our folly we believed him and chose some boys from among the common people. At noon today we were going to operate and take out their hearts. We never expected that you would come down to us, holy monk, and that at that very moment all the boys would disappear in their coops. Then he said that as you were a holy monk who had cultivated the truth for ten lifetimes and not yet dissipated your primal masculinity your heart would be ten thousand times more effective than the little boys' ones. In our temporary delusion we did not realize that you would see through the evil monster, holy monk. We hope that you will make full use of your great dharma to eliminate any future catastrophe. All the wealth of the nation will be given to you as your reward.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I will tell you the truth,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Because my master took pity on the little boys in the coops he told me to hide them. Don't say anything about giving us wealth. When I capture the evil monsters that will be a good deed to my credit. Come with me, Pig.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Whatever you say, elder brother,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;The only thing is that I've got an empty belly: I'll be rather weak.&#8221; The king then ordered the department of foreign affairs to prepare a vegetarian meal at once. Before long the food arrived.</P>
<P>Having eaten his fill, Pig braced his spirits and rose by cloud with Monkey. The king, queens, consorts and civil and military officials were all so astonished that they all kowtowed to the sky, exclaiming, &#8220;They really are immortals and Buddhas come down to earth.&#8221; The Great Sage led Pig twenty miles due South, stopped their wind and cloud and started searching for the demons' home. All he could see was a clear stream running between banks on which grew thousands of willows: he had no idea where the Pure Splendor Grange might be. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Endless expanses stretched out in his gaze;</P>
<P>The embankment had vanished amid willows and haze.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When he could not find the grange the Great Sage Sun made a spell with his hands, said the magic word &#8220;<I>Om</I>&#8221; and summoned the local deity, who approached shivering and shaking, fell to his knees and called out, &#8220;Great Sage, the local god of Willow Bank kowtows to you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't be afraid,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;I'm not going to hit you. Tell me this: is there a Pure Splendor Grange on Willow Hill? And where is it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There is a Pure Splendor Cave,&#8221; the local deity replied, &#8220;but there has never been a Pure Splendor Grange. I suppose you have come from Bhiksuland, Great Sage.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;The king of Bhiksuland was hoodwinked by an evil spirit till I turned up, saw through the monster, defeated him and drove him away. He turned into a beam of cold light and I don't know where he went. When I asked the king of Bhiksuland about it he told me that when the demon first presented him with the girl three years ago he asked the spirit about his background. The demon said that he lived in Pure Splendor Grange on Willow Hill twenty miles South of the city. I've found this place with its wooded hill but can't see any Pure Splendor Grange. That's why I asked you about it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I beg your forgiveness, Great Sage,&#8221; said the local god, kowtowing. &#8220;This is part of the domain of the king of Bhiksuland, and I should have kept a closer watch on things. But the evil spirit had such terrible magical powers. If I had given away what he was doing he would have come and given me a bad time. That is why he has never been caught. Now that you are here, Great Sage, you need only go to the foot of the nine-forked willow on the Southern bank, walk round it three times to the left and three times to the right, hit the tree with both hands and shout 'Open up' three times. The Pure Splendor Cave Palace will then appear.&#8221;</P>
<P>On learning this the Great Sage sent the local god away again, jumped over the stream with Pig and went to look for that willow tree. There was indeed a tree with nine forks on a single trunk. &#8220;Stand well back,&#8221; Monkey ordered Pig, &#8220;while I make the gates open. When I've found the demon and chased him out you're to help.&#8221;</P>
<P>In response to this order Pig took up his stand about three hundred yards from the tree while the Great Sage followed the local god's advice and went round the tree three times to the left and three times to the right then hit it with both hands, shouting, &#8220;Open up! Open up!&#8221; An instant later a pair of double doors opened with a noisy whoosh and the tree was nowhere to be seen. Inside the doors was bright light of many colours but no sign of human life. Confident in his divine might, Monkey charged in. He could see that it was a fine place:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Shimmering clouds, from which</P>
<P>Sun and moon stole their brightness.</P>
<P>White clouds billowing from the caves,</P>
<P>Bright green lichens running wild in the courtyard.</P>
<P>Along the path rare flowers competed in beauty,</P>
<P>While plants on the steps vied in fragrant blossom.</P>
<P>Warm was the air</P>
<P>Where it was ever spring.</P>
<P>This was just like a fairyland,</P>
<P>Or Penglai, the paradise of immortals.</P>
<P>Creepers grew all over the benches;</P>
<P>Vines ran wild across the bridge.</P>
<P>Bees flew into the cave carrying flowers;</P>
<P>Butterflies flirted with orchids as they passed the screen of stone.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Hurrying forward for a closer look Monkey saw that on the stone screen was carved IMMORTAL PALACE OF PURE SPLENDOR. Unable to restrain himself, he jumped over the stone screen to see the old monster embracing a beautiful woman and telling her breathlessly what had happened in Bhiksuland.</P>
<P>&#8220;That was our chance,&#8221; they said together. &#8220;Three years' efforts should have paid off today, but that ape's ruined everything.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey charged up to them, brandishing his cudgel and shouting, &#8220;I'll get you, you fools. What do you mean, that was your chance? Take that!&#8221; Pushing the woman aside, the old monster swung his dragon-headed stick to block the cudgel. It was a fine battle that the two of them fought in front of the cave, and quite unlike the previous one:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The upraised cudgel spat out golden light;</P>
<P>Vicious vapors came from the swinging staff.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The monster said,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;How dare you in your ignorance come to my home?&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey replied,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;I intend to subdue evil monsters.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Said the monster,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;My love for the king was no business of yours,</P>
<P>So why did you come to bully and interfere?&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Answered Monkey,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;A compassionate monk should bring misrule to an end:</P>
<P>We could not endure the slaughter of children.&#8221;</P>
<P>As they flung words at each other hostility grew:</P>
<P>Staff parried cudgel as blows struck at the heart.</P>
<P>Precious flowers were destroyed as they fought for their lives;</P>
<P>Green moss became slippery when trampled underfoot.</P>
<P>Pale grew the light in the cave as they struggled:</P>
<P>Crushed were the fragrant blooms on the crags.</P>
<P>At the clash of their weapons the birds dared not fly;</P>
<P>Their shouts sent the beauties all running in terror.</P>
<P>Only the monster and Monkey were left</P>
<P>To stir up a hurricane that roared over the earth.</P>
<P>Slowly their battle took them out of the cave</P>
<P>Where Wuneng gave play to his mindless wrath.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The sound of the commotion they were making inside so excited Pig where he was waiting outside that his heart itched. As he could get no relief from scratching he raised his rake, smashed the nine-forked willow to the ground, then hit it several times so hard that blood gushed straight out with a barely audible sound. &#8220;This tree's become a spirit,&#8221; he said, &#8220;this tree's a spirit.&#8221; Pig had just raised his rake for another blow when he saw Monkey drawing the monster after him. Without another word the idiot rushed forward, raised his rake and struck. The old monster was already finding Monkey too much to cope with, so that Pig's rake made him more desperate than ever. Abandoning the fight he shook himself, turned back into a beam of cold light, and headed East again. The two of them would not let the demon go but headed Eastwards in pursuit.</P>
<P>Above the shouts of battle they heard the calls of the phoenix and the crane and looked up to see that it was the Star of Longevity from the Southern pole of the heavens. Placing a cover over the cold light the old man called out, &#8220;Don't be in such a hurry, Great Sage; stop chasing him now, Marshal Tian Peng. This old Taoist offers his greetings.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey returned his courtesy and asked, &#8220;Where have you come from, Longevity my brother?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've capped the cold light, so you must have caught the monster, old fat chops,&#8221; said Pig with a grin.</P>
<P>&#8220;Here he is, here he is,&#8221; said the Star of Longevity, smiling back. &#8220;I trust you two gentlemen will spare his life.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The old devil's nothing to do with you, brother,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;so why have you come to plead for him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He's a messenger of mine,&#8221; replied the star with a smile. &#8220;I carelessly let him escape to become a monster here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Since he's yours make him turn back into what he really looks like for us to see,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>The Star of Longevity then let the cold light out and shouted, &#8220;Evil beast! Turn back into yourself at once if you want to be spared the death penalty.&#8221; The demon turned himself round and revealed that he was really a white deer. Picking the staff up the Star of Longevity said, &#8220;You've even stolen my staff, evil beast.&#8221; The deer lay down in submission, unable to speak, but only kowtowing and weeping. Look at him:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Brindled like a tablet of jade,</P>
<P>And carrying a pair of seven-branched antlers.</P>
<P>When hungry he used to find the herb garden;</P>
<P>On mornings when thirsty he drank from the misty stream.</P>
<P>In his lengthening years he had taught himself to fly</P>
<P>And through many a day had mastered transformation.</P>
<P>Now that he heard the call of his master</P>
<P>He resumed his own form and lay down in the dust.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Thanking Monkey, the Star of Longevity mounted his deer and was just leaving when Monkey grabbed hold of him and said, &#8220;Not so fast, brother. There are a couple more jobs still to be done.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What jobs?&#8221; the star asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;The girl hasn't been caught yet and I don't know what sort of monster she is,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;We've also got to go back to Bhiksuland together to see the deluded ruler and show him what they really are.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case I'll be patient,&#8221; the star replied. &#8220;You and Marshal Tian Peng can go down into the cave to capture the girl and take her back to show the king what she really is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Just wait a little while,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;We'll soon be back.&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig then summoned up his spirits and went straight into the Immortal Palace of Pure Splendor with Monkey. &#8220;Catch the evil spirit,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;catch the evil spirit.&#8221; Hearing this great roar the beauty, who was trembling with fear and unable to escape, rushed behind the stone screen, but there was no rear exit.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where do you think you're going?&#8221; Pig shouted. &#8220;I'll get you, you man-trap, you whore spirit. Try my rake!&#8221; As the beauty was unarmed she could not fight back, so she dodged the blow and turned herself into a beam of cold light and fled, only to be stopped by the Great Sage, who with two thumping blows of his cudgel knocked her off her feet and laid her low in the dust. She turned back into her real form as a white-faced vixen. Unable to restrain himself, the idiot lifted his rake and struck her a blow on the head. The great beauty of so many smiles was now a hairy fox.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't smash her to pulp,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;keep her in that shape to show her to the deluded king.&#8221; The idiot grabbed her by the tail, not minding the filth, and dragged her out through the cave entrance with Monkey. Here he saw the Star of Longevity stroking the deer's head and giving him a dressing-down.</P>
<P>&#8220;Evil beast,&#8221; he was saying, &#8220;why did you run away from me and come here to turn yourself into a spirit? If I hadn't turned up the Great Sage Sun would certainly have killed you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What's that you're saying, brother?&#8221; asked Monkey, springing out of the cave.</P>
<P>&#8220;I was telling the deer off,&#8221; the star explained, &#8220;telling the deer off.&#8221;</P>
<P>Throwing the body of the dead fox in front of the deer, Pig said, &#8220;Your daughter, I suppose.&#8221;</P>
<P>The deer nodded then stretched its head out to sniff the body and whimpered as if with grief at its bereavement until the Star of Longevity cuffed its head and said, &#8220;Evil beast. You're lucky to have got away with your life. What are you sniffing her for?&#8221; He then took off the belt he wore round his gown, fastened it round the deer's neck, and led it off with the words, &#8220;Great Sage, let's go to Bhiksuland.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wait a moment,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;I feel like cleaning the whole place up so that no other evil creatures can ever live here again.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Pig heard this he raised his rake and started to smash the willow down wildly. Monkey then said the magic word &#8220;<I>Om</I>&#8221; and summoned the local deity once more. &#8220;Gather some dried firewood,&#8221; Monkey ordered him, &#8220;and start a roaring fire that will rid this place of yours of evil. Then you won't be bullied any more.&#8221;</P>
<P>The local deity then turned around and with a roaring negative wind led his spirit soldiers to gather all sorts of withered vegetation that had dried out since the previous year: frostbitten grass, autumn grass, knotweed grass, mountain grass, dragonbone grass, rushes and reeds. Once set alight they would burn like oil or grease.</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no need to go knocking trees over, Pig,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Fill the mouth of the cave with all this and set it alight: that'll burn the place clean out.&#8221; And indeed once they were lit they turned the evil demons' Pure Splendor home into a fiery furnace. Only then did Monkey dismiss the local god and go with the Star of Longevity as they dragged the fox to the steps of the throne hall where he said to the king, &#8220;Here's your Queen Beauty. Do you want to fool around with her now?&#8221;</P>
<P>This caused the king a terrible shock. At the sight of the Great Sage Monkey bringing the Star of Longevity with the white deer before the throne hall, monarch, ministers, consorts and queens all dropped to the ground to kowtow. Monkey went up to the king and held him up. &#8220;Don't kowtow to me,&#8221; he said with a smile. &#8220;This deer is the Elder of the Nation. It's him you should be kowtowing to.&#8221;</P>
<P>The king was now so overcome with shame that he could only say, &#8220;Thank you, holy monk, for saving the boys in my kingdom. It truly was an act of heavenly kindness.&#8221; He then ordered the department of foreign relations to prepare a vegetarian feast, had the Eastern hall of the palace opened up and invited the star, the Ancient of the Southern Pole, to take part in a thanksgiving feast with the Tang Priest and his three disciples. Sanzang bowed in greeting to the Star of Longevity, as did Friar Sand.</P>
<P>&#8220;If the white deer is one of your creatures, Star of Longevity,&#8221; they both asked, &#8220;how did he get here to become such a nuisance?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Some time ago the Lord of Eastern Splendor came to my mountain,&#8221; the Star of Longevity replied with a smile, &#8220;and I persuaded him to sit down for some chess. The wicked creature escaped before our first game was over. It was only when I couldn't find him after my visitor had gone that I worked out by calculating on my fingers that he must have come here. I had just reached here in my search for him when I met the Great Sage Sun using his mighty powers. If I had been any later this beast would be dead.&#8221; Before he could finish his remarks it was announced that the banquet was ready. It was a splendid vegetarian feast:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The room was overflowing with color;</P>
<P>Exotic fragrances filled the hall.</P>
<P>Embroidered hangings made the tables magnificent;</P>
<P>Red carpets on the floor shimmered like the glow of dawn.</P>
<P>From duck-shaped censers</P>
<P>Curled the scented smoke of eaglewood;</P>
<P>Before the king's place</P>
<P>Were fragrant vegetables.</P>
<P>See how high the towers of fruit were piled;</P>
<P>Sugar dragons and prowling animals.</P>
<P>Molded mandarin ducks,</P>
<P>Lion confections,</P>
<P>Looking quite lifelike.</P>
<P>Parrot goblets,</P>
<P>Cormorant ladles,</P>
<P>Shaped like the real thing.</P>
<P>Every kind of fruit in abundance,</P>
<P>Each exquisite dish a delicacy.</P>
<P>Giant longans and tender bamboo-shoots,</P>
<P>Fresh lichees and peaches.</P>
<P>Sweet smelled the jujubes and persimmon cakes;</P>
<P>More fragrant than wine were the pine-nuts and grapes.</P>
<P>Many a sweet dish made with honey,</P>
<P>Steamed pastries of various kinds,</P>
<P>Sugar-drenched doughnuts</P>
<P>Piled up like bouquets of flowers,</P>
<P>Mountains of rolls on golden dishes,</P>
<P>Fragrant rice heaped high in silver bowls,</P>
<P>Long bean noodles in hot chili soup,</P>
<P>Tasty dishes came in succession.</P>
<P>There was no end of button mushrooms,</P>
<P>&#8220;Tree-ear&#8221; fungus,</P>
<P>Tender bamboo shoots,</P>
<P>Sealwort,</P>
<P>Vegetables of many flavors,</P>
<P>A hundred kinds of rare delights.</P>
<P>They came and went in endless succession,</P>
<P>All the abundant dishes offered at the feast.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The seating was arranged on the spot, the seat of honour going to the Star of Longevity and the next best place to the Tang Priest. The king sat between them while Brother Monkey, Pig and Friar Sand sat at the side places. There were also three senior ministers present to keep them company, and the musicians and singers of the court theatre were ordered to perform. Holding his purple cloud goblet, the king, toasted them one by one.</P>
<P>The only person who would not drink was the Tang Priest. &#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig to Monkey, &#8220;I'll leave the fruit for you, but you must let me have a good feed of the soup, bread and rice.&#8221; With no further thought the idiot ate everything all at once. He devoured everything that was brought in and left nothing behind.</P>
<P>When the banquet was coming to an end the Star of Longevity took his leave of them. The king went up to him, knelt, kowtowed and begged the star to tell him the secret of eliminating disease and prolonging life. &#8220;I didn't bring any elixir as I was here to search for my deer,&#8221; the Star of Longevity replied. &#8220;I would like to teach you the techniques of self-cultivation, but you are so weak in body and ruined in spirit that you would not be able to convert the elixir. All I have in my sleeve is these three jujubes that I was intending to offer to the Lord of Eastern Splendor to take with tea. As they haven't been eaten I can offer them to you now.&#8221;</P>
<P>The king swallowed them, and he gradually began to feel lighter in body as the illness was cured. This was the origin of his later success in achieving immortality. As soon as Pig saw this he called, &#8220;Longevity, old pal, if you've got any fire jujubes give me some.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I didn't bring any,&#8221; the star replied, &#8220;but I'll give you several pounds of them next time.&#8221; The Star of Longevity then went out of the Eastern pavilion, expressed his thanks, called to the white deer, sprang on his back and departed by cloud. We will not relate how the king, queens and consorts in the palace and the common people in the city all burnt incense and kowtowed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciples,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;let us pack up and take our leave of His Majesty.&#8221; The king pleaded with them to stay and instruct him. &#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;from now on you should be less greedy for your sexual pleasures and accumulate more hidden merit. In whatever you do you should use your strong points to make up for your weaknesses. This is the way to get rid of your illness and prolong your life. That's what we'll tell you.&#8221; Two dishes full of small pieces of gold and silver were then offered to the pilgrims to help with the expenses of their journey, but the Tang Priest refused to accept a single penny. The king then had no choice but to order the royal carriage and invite the Tang Priest to sit in the dragon and phoenix coach while he, his queens and his consorts pushed the wheels. Thus they escorted him out of the palace. In the streets and markets the common people also came with bowls of pure water and incense-burners to see them on their way from the city.</P>
<P>Suddenly there was the sound of a wind in the sky and 1,111 goose coops landed on both sides of the road. The little boys in them were crying. Unseen in the sky were the deities who had been looking after them: the city and the local gods, the deities of the altars, the True Officials, the Guardians of the Four Quarters and the Centre, the Four Duty Gods, the Six Dings and Six Jias, the Protectors of the Faith and the rest of them, who all responded with a loud shout of, &#8220;Great Sage, on your earlier instructions we carried the boys away in the goose coops. Now that we have learned of your success in your task and your departure we have brought every one of them back again.&#8221; The king, his queens and consorts and all his ministers and subjects fell to their knees to kowtow.</P>
<P>&#8220;Thank you for your efforts, gentlemen,&#8221; Monkey shouted to the sky. &#8220;Please all return to your shrines now. I'll get the people to make thanksgiving offerings to you.&#8221; With a soughing noise the magic wind then arose again and departed.</P>
<P>Monkey then told the people of the city to come and collect their children. The news was spread at once, and the people all came to claim the boys in the baskets. They were very happy indeed. Holding the boys in their arms they called them dear ones and darlings. Dancing and laughing they told their children to take hold of the lords from Tang and bring them home so that they could express their thanks for the boys' rescue. Nobody, young or old, male or female, was frightened by the disciples' ugly faces as they all carried Pig, Friar Sand, Monkey and the Tang Priest back to the city in the middle of a crowd that also brought their luggage and led the horse. The king could not stop them. Family after family laid on a banquet or a feast, and those who could not offer hospitality made monkish hats, shoes, tunics, cotton socks, and other inner and outer garments in different sizes that they presented to the pilgrims. Only when they had been entertained in this way for nearly a month were the travelers able to leave the city. Portraits of them were painted and tablets bearing their names set up; to these the people could kowtow, burn incense and make offerings. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Great was the gratitude for their enormous kindness,</P>
<P>In saving the lives of infants by the thousand.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<p>寻洞擒妖逢老寿</p>
<p>当朝正主救婴儿</p>
</div>
<p>却说那锦衣官把假唐僧扯出馆驿，与羽林军围围绕绕，直至朝门外，对黄门官言：“我等已请唐僧到此，烦为转奏。”黄门官急进朝，依言奏上昏君，遂请进去。众官都在阶下跪拜，惟假唐僧挺立阶心，口中高叫：“比丘王，请我贫僧何说？”君王笑道：“朕得一疾，缠绵日久不愈。幸国丈赐得一方，药饵俱已完备，只少一味引子，特请长老求些药引。若得病愈，与长老修建祠堂，四时奉祭，永为传国之香火。”假唐僧道：“我乃出家人，只身至此，不知陛下问国丈要甚东西作引。”昏君道：“特求长老的心肝。”假唐僧道：“不瞒陛下说，心便有几个儿，不知要的甚么色样。”那国丈在旁指定道：“那和尚，要你的黑心。”假唐僧道：“既如此，快取刀来。剖开胸腹，若有黑心，谨当奉命。”那昏君欢喜相谢，即着当驾官取一把牛耳短刀，递与假僧。假僧接刀在手，解开衣服，挺起胸膛，将左手抹腹，右手持刀，唿喇的响一声，把腹皮剖开，那里头就骨都都的滚出一堆心来。唬得文官失色，武将身麻。国丈在殿上见了道：“这是个多心的和尚！”假僧将那些心，血淋淋的，一个个捡开与众观看，却都是些红心、白心、黄心、悭贪心、利名心、嫉妒心、计较心、好胜心、望高心、侮慢心、杀害心、狠毒心、恐怖心、谨慎心、邪妄心、无名隐暗之心、种种不善之心，更无一个黑心。那昏君唬得呆呆挣挣，口不能言，战兢兢的教：“收了去！收了去！”那假唐僧忍耐不住，收了法，现出本相，对昏君道：“陛下全无眼力！我和尚家都是一片好心，惟你这国丈是个黑心，好做药引。你不信，等我替你取他的出来看看。”那国丈听见，急睁睛仔细观看，见那和尚变了面皮，不是那般模样。咦！认得当年孙大圣，五百年前旧有名。却抽身，腾云就起，被行者翻筋斗，跳在空中喝道：</p>

<p>“那里走！吃吾一棒！”那国丈即使蟠龙拐杖来迎。他两个在半空中这场好杀如意棒，蟠龙拐，虚空一片云叆叆。原来国丈是妖精，故将怪女称娇色。国主贪欢病染身，妖邪要把儿童宰。相逢大圣显神通，捉怪救人将难解。铁棒当头着实凶，拐棍迎来堪喝采。杀得那满天雾气暗城池，城里人家都失色。文武多官魂魄飞，嫔妃绣女容颜改。唬得那比丘昏主乱身藏，战战兢兢没布摆。棒起犹如虎出山，拐轮却似龙离海。今番大闹比丘城，致令邪正分明白。那妖精与行者苦战二十余合，蟠龙拐抵不住金箍棒，虚幌了一拐，将身化作一道寒光，落入皇宫内院，把进贡的妖后带出宫门，并化寒光，不知去向。</p>

<p>大圣按落云头，到了宫殿下，对多官道：“你们的好国丈啊！”多官一齐礼拜，感谢神僧，行者道：“且休拜，且去看你那昏主何在。”多官道：“我主见争战时，惊恐潜藏，不知向那座宫中去也。”行者即命：“快寻！莫被美后拐去！”多官听言，不分内外，同行者先奔美后宫，漠然无踪，连美后也通不见了。正宫、东宫、西宫、六院，概众后妃，都来拜谢大圣。大圣道：“且请起，不到谢处哩，且去寻你主公。”少时，见四五个太监，搀着那昏君自谨身殿后面而来。众臣俯伏在地，齐声启奏道：“主公！主公！感得神僧到此，辨明真假。那国丈乃是个妖邪，连美后亦不见矣。”国王闻言，即请行者出皇宫，到宝殿拜谢了道：“长老，你早间来的模样，那般俊伟，这时如何就改了形容？”行者笑道：“不瞒陛下说，早间来者，是我师父，乃唐朝御弟三藏。我是他徒弟孙悟空，还有两个师弟，猪悟能沙悟净，见在金亭馆驿。因知你信了妖言，要取我师父心肝做药引，是老孙变作师父模样，特来此降妖也。”那国王闻说，即传旨着阁下太宰快去驿中请师众来朝。</p>

<p>那三藏听见行者现了相，在空中降妖，吓得魂飞魄散，幸有八戒沙僧护持，他又脸上戴着一片子臊泥，正闷闷不快，只听得人叫道：“法师，我等乃比丘国王差来的阁下太宰，特请入朝谢恩也。”八戒笑道：“师父。莫怕莫怕！这不是又请你取心，想是师兄得胜，请你酬谢哩。”三藏道：“虽是得胜来请，但我这个臊脸，怎么见人？”八戒道：“没奈何，我们且去见了师兄，自有解释。”真个那长老无计，只得扶着八戒沙僧挑着担，牵着马，同去驿庭之上。那太宰见了，害怕道：“爷爷呀！这都相似妖头怪脑之类！”沙僧道：“朝士休怪丑陋，我等乃是生成的遗体。若我师父来见了我师兄，他就俊了。”他三人与众来朝，不待宣召，直至殿下。行者看见，即转身下殿，迎着面把师父的泥脸子抓下，吹口仙气，叫“正！”那唐僧即时复了原身，精神愈觉爽利。国王下殿亲迎，口称：“法师老佛。”师徒们将马拴住，都上殿来相见。行者道：“陛下可知那怪来自何方？等老孙去与你一并擒来，剪除后患。”三宫六院，诸嫔群妃，都在那翡翠屏后，听见行者说剪除后患，也不避内外男女之嫌，一齐出来拜告道：“万望神僧老佛大施法力，斩草除根，把他剪除尽绝，诚为莫大之恩，自当重报！”行者忙忙答礼，只教国王说他住居。</p>

<p>国王含羞告道：“三年前他到时，朕曾问他。他说离城不远，只在向南去七十里路，有一座柳林坡湾华庄上。国丈年老无儿，止后妻生一女，年方十六，不曾配人，愿进与朕。朕因那女貌娉婷，遂纳了，宠幸在宫。不期得疾，太医屡药无功。他说我有仙方，止用小儿心煎汤为引。是朕不才，轻信其言，遂选民间小儿，选定今日午时开刀取心。不料神僧下降，恰恰又遇笼儿都不见了。他就说神僧十世修真，元阳未泄，得其心，比小儿心更加万倍。一时误犯，不知神僧识透妖魔。敢望广施大法，剪其后患，朕以倾国之资酬谢！”行者笑道：“实不相瞒，笼中小儿，是我师慈悲，着我藏了。你且休题甚么资财相谢，待我捉了妖怪，是我的功行。”叫：“八戒，跟我去来。”八戒道：“谨依兄命。</p>

<p>但只是腹中空虚，不好着力。”国王即传旨教：“光禄寺快办斋供。”不一时斋到。八戒尽饱一餐，抖擞精神，随行者驾云而起。</p>

<p>唬得那国王、妃后，并文武多官，一个个朝空礼拜，都道：“是真仙真佛降临凡也！”那大圣携着八戒，径到南方七十里之地，住下风云，找寻妖处。但只见一股清溪，两边夹岸，岸上有千千万万的杨柳，更不知清华庄在于何处。正是那：万顷野田观不尽，千堤烟柳隐无踪。</p>

<p>孙大圣寻觅不着，即捻诀，念一声“唵”字真言，拘出一个当坊土地，战兢兢近前跪下叫道：“大圣，柳林坡土地叩头。”行者道：“你休怕，我不打你。我问你：柳林坡有个清华庄，在于何方？”土地道：“此间有个清华洞，不曾有个清华庄。小神知道了，大圣想是自比丘国来的？”行者道：“正是正是。比丘国王被一个妖精哄了，是老孙到那厢，识得是妖怪，当时战退那怪，化一道寒光，不知去向。及问比丘王，他说三年前进美女时，曾问其由，怪言居住城南七十里柳林坡清华庄。适寻到此，只见林坡，不见清华庄，是以问你。”土地叩头道：“望大圣恕罪。比丘王亦我地之主也，小神理当鉴察，奈何妖精神威法大，如我泄漏他事，就来欺凌，故此未获。大圣今来，只去那南岸九叉头一颗杨树根下，左转三转，右转三转，用两手齐扑树上，连叫三声开门，即现清华洞府。”</p>

<p>大圣闻言，即令土地回去，与八戒跳过溪来，寻那颗杨树。</p>

<p>果然有九条叉枝，总在一颗根上。行者吩咐八戒：“你且远远的站定，待我叫开门，寻着那怪，赶将出来，你却接应。”八戒闻命，即离树有半里远近立下。这大圣依土地之言，绕树根，左转三转，右转三转，双手齐扑其树，叫：“开门！开门！”霎时间，一声响喨，唿喇喇的门开两扇，更不见树的踪迹。那里边光明霞采，亦无人烟。行者趁神威，撞将进去，但见那里好个去处：烟霞幌亮，日月偷明。白云常出洞，翠藓乱漫庭。一径奇花争艳丽，遍阶瑶草斗芳荣。温暖气，景常春，浑如阆苑，不亚蓬瀛。滑凳攀长蔓，平桥挂乱藤。蜂衔红蕊来岩窟，蝶戏幽兰过石屏。行者急拽步，行近前边细看，见石屏上有四个大字：“清华仙府”。</p>

<p>他忍不住，跳过石屏看处，只见那老怪怀中搂着个美女，喘嘘嘘的，正讲比丘国事，齐声叫道：“好机会来！三年事，今日得完，被那猴头破了！”行者跑近身，掣棒高叫道：“我把你这伙毛团，甚么好机会！吃吾一棒！”那老怪丢放美人，轮起蟠龙拐，急架相迎。他两个在洞前，这场好杀，比前又甚不同：棒举迸金光，拐轮凶气发。那怪道：“你无知敢进我门来！”行者道：“我有意降邪怪！”那怪道：“我恋国主你无干，怎的欺心来展抹？”行者道：“僧修政教本慈悲，不忍儿童活见杀。”语去言来各恨仇，棒迎拐架当心札。促损琪花为顾生，踢破翠苔因把滑。只杀得那洞中霞采欠光明，岩上芳菲俱掩压。乒乓惊得鸟难飞，吆喝吓得美人散。只存老怪与猴王，呼呼卷地狂风刮。看看杀出洞门来，又撞悟能呆性发。原来八戒在外边，听见他们里面嚷闹，激得他心痒难挠，掣钉钯，把一棵九叉杨树刨倒，使钯筑了几下，筑得那鲜血直冒，嘤嘤的似乎有声。他道：“这棵树成了精也！这棵树成了精也！”按在地下，又正筑处，只见行者引怪出来。那呆子不打话，赶上前，举钯就筑。那老怪战行者已是难敌，见八戒钯来，愈觉心慌，败了阵，将身一幌，化道寒光，径投东走。他两个决不放松，向东赶来。</p>

<p>正当喊杀之际，又闻得鸾鹤声鸣，祥光缥缈，举目视之，乃南极老人星也，那老人把寒光罩住，叫道：“大圣慢来，天蓬休赶，老道在此施礼哩。”行者即答礼道：“寿星兄弟，那里来”？八戒笑道：“肉头老儿，罩住寒光，必定捉住妖怪了。”寿星陪笑道：“在这里，在这里，望二公饶他命罢。”行者道：“老怪不与老弟相干，为何来说人情？”寿星笑道：“他是我的一副脚力，不意走将来，成此妖怪。”行者道：“既是老弟之物，只教他现出本相来看看。”寿星闻言，即把寒光放出，喝道：“孽畜！快现本相，饶你死罪！”那怪打个转身，原来是只白鹿，寿星拿起拐杖道：“这孽畜！连我的拐棒也偷来也！”那只鹿俯伏在地，口不能言，只管叩头滴泪。但见他：一身如玉简斑斑，两角参差七汊湾。几度饥时寻药圃，有朝渴处饮云潺。年深学得飞腾法，日久修成变化颜。今见主人呼唤处，现身珉耳伏尘寰。寿星谢了行者，就跨鹿而行，被行者一把扯住道：“老弟，且慢走，还有两件事未完哩。”寿星道：“还有甚么未完之事？”行者道：“还有美人未获，不知是个甚么怪物；还又要同到比丘城见那昏君，现相回旨也。”寿星道：“既这等说，我且宁耐。你与天蓬下洞擒捉那美人来，同去现相可也。”行者道：“老弟略等等儿，我们去了就来。”那八戒抖擞精神，随行者径入清华仙府，呐声喊叫：“拿妖精！拿妖精！”那美人战战兢兢，正自难逃，又听得喊声大振，即转石屏之内，又没个后门出头，被八戒喝声：“那里走！我把你这个哄汉子的臊精！看钯”！那美人手中又无兵器，不能迎敌，将身一闪，化道寒光，往外就走，被大圣抵住寒光，乒乓一棒，那怪立不住脚，倒在尘埃，现了本相，原来是一个白面狐狸。呆子忍不住手，举钯照头一筑，可怜把那个倾城倾国千般笑，化作毛团狐狸形！行者叫道：“莫打烂他，且留他此身去见昏君。”</p>

<p>那呆子不嫌秽污，一把揪住尾子，拖拖扯扯，跟随行者出得门来。只见那寿星老儿手摸着鹿头骂道：“好孽畜啊！你怎么背主逃去，在此成精！若不是我来，孙大圣定打死你了。”行者跳出来道：“老弟说甚么？”寿星道：“我嘱鹿哩！我嘱鹿哩！”八戒将个死狐狸掼在鹿的面前道：“这可是你的女儿么？”那鹿点头幌脑，伸着嘴闻他几闻，呦呦发声，似有眷恋不舍之意，被寿星劈头扑了一掌道：“孽畜！你得命足矣，又闻他怎的？”即解下勒袍腰带，把鹿扣住颈项，牵将起来，道：“大圣，我和你比丘国相见去也。”行者道：“且住！索性把这边都扫个干净，庶免他年复生妖孽。”八戒闻言，举钯将柳树乱筑。行者又念声“唵”字真言，依然拘出当坊土地，叫：“寻些枯柴，点起烈火，与你这方消除妖患，以免欺凌。”那土地即转身，阴风飒飒，帅起阴兵，搬取了些迎霜草、秋青草、蓼节草、山蕊草、篓蒿柴、龙骨柴、芦荻柴，都是隔年干透的枯焦之物，见火如同油腻一般。行者叫：</p>

<p>“八戒，不必筑树，但得此物填塞洞里，放起火来，烧得个干净。”火一起，果然把一座清华妖怪宅，烧作火池坑。</p>

<p>这里才喝退土地，同寿星牵着鹿，拖着狐狸，一齐回到殿前，对国王道：“这是你的美后，与他耍子儿么？”那国王胆战心惊。又只见孙大圣引着寿星，牵着白鹿，都到殿前，唬得那国里君臣妃后，一齐下拜。行者近前搀住国王笑道：“且休拜我，这鹿儿却是国丈，你只拜他便是。”那国王羞愧无地，只道：“感谢神僧救我一国小儿，真天恩也！”即传旨教光禄寺安排素宴，大开东阁，请南极老人与唐僧四众，共坐谢恩。三藏拜见了寿星，沙僧亦以礼见，都问道：“白鹿既是老寿星之物，如何得到此间为害？”寿星笑道：“前者，东华帝君过我荒山，我留坐着棋，一局未终，这孽畜走了。及客去寻他不见，我因屈指询算，知他走在此处，特来寻他，正遇着孙大圣施威。若果来迟，此畜休矣。”</p>

<p>叙不了，只见报道：“宴已完备。”好素宴：五彩盈门，异香满座。</p>

<p>桌挂绣纬生锦艳，地铺红毯幌霞光。宝鸭内，沉檀香袅；御筵前，蔬品香馨。看盘高果砌楼台，龙缠斗糖摆走兽。鸳鸯锭，狮仙糖，似模似样；鹦鹉杯，鹭鹚杓，如相如形。席前果品般般盛，案上斋肴件件精。魁圆茧栗，鲜荔桃子。枣儿柿饼味甘甜，松子葡萄香腻酒。几般蜜食，数品蒸酥。油札糖浇，花团锦砌。金盘高垒大馍馍，银碗满盛香稻饭。辣煼煼汤水粉条长，香喷喷相连添换美。说不尽蘑菇、木耳、嫩笋、黄精，十香素菜，百味珍馐。往来绰摸不曾停，进退诸般皆盛设。当时叙了坐次，寿星首席，长老次席，国王前席，行者、八戒、沙僧侧席，旁又有两三个太师相陪左右。即命教坊司动乐，国王擎着紫霞杯，一一奉酒，惟唐僧不饮。八戒向行者道：“师兄，果子让你，汤饭等须请让我受用受用。”那呆子不分好歹，一齐乱上，但来的吃个精空。一席筵宴已毕，寿星告辞。那国王又近前跪拜寿星，求祛病延年之法，寿星笑道：“我因寻鹿，未带丹药。欲传你修养之方，你又筋衰神败，不能还丹。我这衣袖中，只有三个枣儿，是与东华帝君献茶的，我未曾吃，今送你罢。”国王吞之，渐觉身轻病退。后得长生者，皆原于此。八戒看见就叫道：“老寿，有火枣，送我几个吃吃。”寿星道：“未曾带得，待改日我送你几斤。”遂出了东阁，道了谢意，将白鹿一声喝起，飞跨背上，踏云而去。这朝中君王妃后，城中黎庶居民，各各焚香礼拜不题。</p>

<p>三藏叫：“徒弟，收拾辞王。”那国王又苦留求教，行者道：</p>

<p>“陛下，从此色欲少贪，阴功多积。凡百事将长补短，自足以祛病延年，就是教也。”遂拿出两盘散金碎银，奉为路费。唐僧坚辞，分文不受。国王无已，命摆銮驾，请唐僧端坐凤辇龙车，王与嫔后，俱推轮转毂，方送出朝。六街三市，百姓群黎，亦皆盏添净水，炉降真香，又送出城。忽听得半空中一声风响，路两边落下一千一百一十一个鹅笼，内有小儿啼哭，暗中有原护的城隍、土地、社令、真官、五方揭谛、四值功曹、六丁六甲、护教伽蓝等众，应声高叫道：“大圣，我等前蒙吩咐，摄去小儿鹅笼，今知大圣功成起行，一一送来也。”那国王妃后与一应臣民，又俱下拜。行者望空道：“有劳列位，请各归祠，我着民间祭祀谢你。”呼呼淅淅，阴风又起而退。行者叫城里人家来认领小儿。</p>

<p>当时传播，俱来各认出笼中之儿，欢欢喜喜，抱出叫哥哥，叫肉儿，跳的跳，笑的笑，都叫：“扯住唐朝爷爷，到我家奉谢救儿之恩！”无大无小，若男若女，都不怕他相貌之丑，抬着猪八戒，扛着沙和尚，顶着孙大圣，撮着唐三藏，牵着马，挑着担，一拥回城，那国王也不能禁止。这家也开宴，那家也设席。请不及的，或做僧帽、僧鞋、褊衫、布袜，里里外外，大小衣裳，都来相送。</p>

<p>如此盘桓将有个月，才得离城。又有传下影神，立起牌位，顶礼焚香供养。这才是：阴功高垒恩山重，救活千千万万人。毕竟不知向后又有甚么事体，且听下回分解。</p>
