<P>An Evil Monster Harms the True Law</P>
<P>The Mind-Horse Remembers the Heart-Ape</P>
</div>
<P>Now that he had tied up Friar Sand, the monster did not kill him, hit him, or even swear at him. Instead he raised his sword and thought, &#8220;Coming from so great a country the Tang priest must have a sense of propriety&#8212;he can't have sent his disciples to capture me after I spared his life. Hmm. That wife of mine must have sent some kind of letter to her country and let the secret out. Just wait till I question her.&#8221; The monster became so furious that he was ready to kill her.</P>
<P>The unwitting princess, who had just finished making herself up, came out to see the ogre knitting his brows and gnashing his teeth in anger.</P>
<P>&#8220;What is bothering you, my lord?&#8221; she asked with a smile. The monster snorted and started to insult her.</P>
<P>&#8220;You low bitch,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you haven't a shred of human decency. You never made the slightest complaint when I first brought you here. You wear clothes of brocade and a crown of gold, and I go out to find anything you need. You live in luxury all four seasons of the year, and we've always been very close to each other. So why do you think only of your mother and father? Why do you have no wifely feelings?&#8221;</P>
<P>This so frightened the princess that she fell to her knees and said, &#8220;What makes you start talking as if you are going to get rid of me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm not sure whether I'm getting rid of you or you're getting rid of me,&#8221; the monster replied. &#8220;I captured that Tang Priest and brought him here to eat, but you released him without asking me first. You must have secretly written a letter and asked him to deliver it for you. There's no other explanation for why these two monks should have made an attack on this place and be demanding your return. It's all your fault, isn't it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't blame me for this, my lord,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;I never wrote such a letter.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Liar,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I've captured one of my enemies to prove it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Who?&#8221; she asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Friar Sand, the Tang Priest's second disciple.&#8221; Nobody likes to accept their death, even at their last gasp, so she could only try to keep up the pretence.</P>
<P>&#8220;Please don't lose your temper, my lord,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Let's go and ask him about it. If there really was a letter I'll gladly let you kill me; but if there wasn't, you'd be killing your slave unjustly.&#8221; With no further argument the monster grabbed her by her bejeweled hair with his fist the size of a basket and threw her to the floor in front of him. Then he seized his sword to question Friar Sand.</P>
<P>&#8220;Friar Sand,&#8221; he roared, &#8220;When you two had the impertinence to make your attack was it because the king of her country sent you here after getting a letter from her?&#8221;</P>
<P>When the bound Friar Sand saw the evil spirit throw the princess to the ground in his fury then take hold of his sword to kill her, he thought, &#8220;It's obvious she must have sent a letter. But she did us a very great favour by sparing our master. If I tell him about it, he'll kill her. No, that would be a terrible thing to do after what she did for us. Besides, I haven't done any good deeds all the time I have been with our master, so as a prisoner here I can pay back my master's goodness to me with my life.&#8221;</P>
<P>His mind made up, he shouted, &#8220;Behave yourself, evil monster. She sent no letter, so don't you mistreat her or murder her. I'll tell you why we came to demand the princess. When my master was your prisoner in this cave he saw what the princess looked like. Later on when he presented his credentials to the King of Elephantia, the king showed him her picture and asked him if he'd seen her on his journey. The king had this picture of her painted long ago, and made enquiries about her all over the place. My master told the king about her, and when he heard this news of his daughter the king gave us some of his imperial wine and sent us to bring her back to the palace. This is the truth. There was no letter. If you want to kill anybody, kill me, and don't be so wicked as to slaughter an innocent woman.&#8221;</P>
<P>Impressed by Friar Sand's noble words, the monster put aside his sword and took the princess in his arms, saying, &#8220;Please forgive me for being so boorishly rude.&#8221; Then he put her hair up again for her, and turning tender again, urged her to go inside with him. He asked her to take the seat of honour and apologized to her. In her female fickleness the princess was prompted by his excess of courtesy to think of an idea.</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; she said, &#8220;could you have Friar Sand's bonds loosened a little for the sake of our love?&#8221; The old fiend ordered his underlings to untie Friar Sand and lock him up there instead.</P>
<P>On being untied and locked up, Friar Sand got up and thought, &#8220;The ancients said that a good turn to someone else is a good turn to yourself. If I hadn't helped her out, she wouldn't have had me untied.&#8221;</P>
<P>The old fiend then had a banquet laid on to calm his wife and make it up to her. When he had drunk himself fairly tipsy he put on a new robe and girded a sword to his waist. Then he fondled the princess and said, &#8220;You stay at home and drink, wife. Look after our two sons and don't let Friar Sang get away. While the Tang Priest is in Elephantia I'm going to get to know my relations.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What relations?&#8221; she asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your father,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I'm his son-in-law and he's my father-in-law, so why shouldn't we get acquainted?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You mustn't go,&#8221; was her reply.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; he asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;My father,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;didn't win his country by force of arms; it was handed down to him by his ancestors. He came to the throne as a child and has never been far from the palace gates, so he's never seen a tough guy like you. You are a bit on the hideous side with that face of yours, and it would be very bad if a visit from you terrified him. You'd do better not to go and meet him.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Then I'll make myself handsome,&#8221; he said.</P>
<P>&#8220;Try it and show me,&#8221; said the princess.</P>
<P>The splendid fiend shook himself, and in the middle of the banquet he changed himself into a handsome man.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Elegant he was, and tall.</P>
<P>He spoke like a high official,</P>
<P>His movements were those of a youth.</P>
<P>He was as brilliant as the poet Cao Zhi,</P>
<P>Handsome as Pan An to whom the women threw fruit.</P>
<P>On his head was a hat with magpie feathers,</P>
<P>To which the black clouds submitted;</P>
<P>He wore a robe of jade-coloured silk</P>
<P>With wide and billowing sleeves.</P>
<P>On his feet were black boots with patterned tops,</P>
<P>And at his waist hung a gleaming sword.</P>
<P>He was a most imposing man,</P>
<P>Tall, elegant and handsome.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The princess was thoroughly delighted at the sight of him. &#8220;Isn't this a good transformation?&#8221; he asked her with a smile.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wonderful,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;wonderful. When you go to court like that the king will be bound to accept you as his son-in-law and make his civil and military officials give you a banquet, so if you have anything to drink you must be very careful not to show your real face&#8212;it wouldn't do to let the secret out.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't need to tell me that,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I understand perfectly well myself.&#8221;</P>
<P>He sprang away on his cloud and was soon in Elephantia, where he landed and walked to the palace gates. &#8220;Please report,&#8221; he said to the High Custodian of the gate, &#8220;that His Majesty's third son-in-law has come for an audience.&#8221;</P>
<P>A eunuch messenger went to the steps of the throne and reported, &#8220;Your Majesty's third son-in-law has come for an audience and is waiting for your summons outside the palace gates.&#8221; When the king, who was talking with Sanzang, heard the words &#8220;third son-in-law&#8221; he said to the assembled officials, &#8220;I only have two sons-in-law&#8212;there can't be a third.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It must be that the monster has come,&#8221; the officials replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Then should I send for him?&#8221; the king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; said Sanzang in alarm, &#8220;he is an evil spirit, so we mortals can do nothing about him. He knows about the past and the future and rides on the clouds. He will come whether you send for him or not, so it would be better to send for him and avoid arguments.&#8221;</P>
<P>The king accepted the proposal and sent for him. The fiend came to the bottom of the steps and performed the usual ritual of dancing and chanting. His handsome looks prevented any of the officials from realizing that he was a demon; instead they took him in their mortal blindness for a good man. At the sight of his imposing figure the king thought that he would be a pillar and the savior of the state. &#8220;Son-in-law,&#8221; he asked him, &#8220;where do you live? Where are you from? When did you marry the princess? Why haven't you come to see me before?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I come,&#8221; the monster replied, knocking his head on the ground, &#8220;from the Moon Waters Cave in Bowl Mountain.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How far is that from here?&#8221; asked the king.</P>
<P>&#8220;Not far,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;only a hundred miles.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If it's a hundred miles away,&#8221; said the king, &#8220;how did the princess get there to marry you?&#8221;</P>
<P>The monster gave a cunning and deceptive answer. &#8220;My lord,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I have been riding and shooting since childhood, and I support myself by hunting. Thirteen years ago as I was out hunting one day with falcons, hounds, and a few score retainers when I saw a ferocious striped tiger carrying a girl on its back down the mountainside. I fitted an arrow to my bow and shot the tiger, then took the girl home and revived her with hot water, which saved her life. When I asked her where she was from she never mentioned the word 'princess'&#8212;had she said that she was Your Majesty's daughter, I would never have had the effrontery to marry her without your permission. I would have come to your golden palace and asked for some appointment in which I might have distinguished myself. As she said she was the daughter of ordinary folk I kept her in my home. With her beauty and my ability we fell in love, and we have been married all these years. When we were married I wanted to kill the tiger and serve him up at a banquet for all my relations, but she asked me not to. There was a verse that explained why I should not:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;'Thanks to Heaven and Earth we are becoming man and wife;</P>
<P>We will marry without matchmaker or witnesses.</P>
<P>A red thread must have united us in a former life,</P>
<P>So let us make the tiger our matchmaker.'</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;When she said that I untied the tiger and spared its life. The wounded beast swished its tail and was off. Little did I realize that after escaping with its life it would have spent the past years making itself into a spirit whose sole intention is to deceive and kill people. I believe that there was once a group of pilgrims going to fetch scriptures who said that they were priests from the Great Tang. The tiger must have killed their leader, taken his credentials, and made himself look like the pilgrim. He is now in this palace trying to deceive Your Majesty. That man sitting on an embroidered cushion is in fact the very tiger who carried the princess off thirteen years ago. He is no pilgrim.&#8221;</P>
<P>The feeble-minded king, who in his mortal blindness could not recognize the evil spirit, believed that his tissue of lies were the truth and said, &#8220;Noble son-in-law, how can you tell that this monk is the tiger who carried the princess off?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Living in the mountains,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;I eat tiger, dress in tiger, sleep amid tigers, and move among tigers. Of course I can tell.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Even if you can tell,&#8221; said the king, &#8220;turn him back into his real form to show me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If I may borrow half a saucer of water,&#8221; answered the fiend, &#8220;I will turn him back into his real form.&#8221; The king sent an officer to fetch some water for his son-in-law. The monster put the water in his hand, leapt forward, and did an Eye-deceiving Body-fixing Spell. He recited the words of the spell, spurted a mouthful of water over the Tang Priest, and shouted &#8220;Change!&#8221; Sanzang's real body was hidden away on top of the hall, and he was turned into a striped tiger. To the king's mortal eyes the tiger had:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A white brow and a rounded head,</P>
<P>A patterned body and eyes of lightning.</P>
<P>Four legs,</P>
<P>Straight and tall;</P>
<P>Twenty claws,</P>
<P>Hooked and sharp.</P>
<P>Jagged fangs ringed his mouth,</P>
<P>Pointed ears grew from his brow.</P>
<P>Fierce and powerful, formed like a giant cat,</P>
<P>Wild and virile as a brown bull-calf.</P>
<P>His bristling whiskers shone like silver,</P>
<P>Acrid breath came from his spike tongue.</P>
<P>He was indeed a savage tiger</P>
<P>Whose majesty dominated the palace hall.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>One look at him sent the king's souls flying from his body, and all the officials fled in terror except for a handful of gallant generals. They charged the tiger at the head of a group of officers, hacking wildly with every kind of weapon. If the Tang Priest had not been fated to survive, even twenty of him would have been chopped to mince. Luckily for him the Six Dings, the Six Jias, the Revealers of the Truth, the Duty Gods, and the Protectors of the Faith were all protecting him in mid-air and preventing him from being wounded by any of the weapons. After a turmoil that continued until evening they finally caught the tiger, chained it, and put it in an iron cage in the room where officials waited for audience.</P>
<P>The king then ordered his household department to lay on a large banquet to thank his son-in-law for saving his daughter from being killed by the monk. That evening, when the court had been dismissed, the monster went to the Hall of Silvery Peace. Eighteen Palace Beauties and Junior Concubines had been selected, and they made music, sang and danced, urging the fiend to drink and be merry. The ogre sat alone in the seat of honour, and to left and right of him were all these voluptuous women. When he had been drinking until the second watch of the night he became too intoxicated to restrain his savagery and longer. He jumped up, bellowed with laughter, and turned back into his real self. A murderous impulse came upon him, and stretching out his hand as big as a basket he seized a girl who was playing a lute, dragged her towards him, and took a bite from her head. The seventeen other palace women fled in panic and hid themselves.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Palace Beauties were terrified,</P>
<P>The Junior Concubines were panic-stricken.</P>
<P>The terrified Palace Beauties</P>
<P>Were like lotuses beaten by the rain at night;</P>
<P>The panic-stricken Concubines</P>
<P>Were like peonies swaying in the spring breezes.</P>
<P>Smashing their lutes, they fled for their lives,</P>
<P>Trampling on zithers as they ran away.</P>
<P>As they went out through the doors they knew not where they went;</P>
<P>In their flight from the hall they rushed everywhere,</P>
<P>Damaging their faces of jade</P>
<P>And bumping their pretty heads.</P>
<P>Every one of them fled for her life;</P>
<P>All of them ran away to safety.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The women who had fled did not dare to shout as they did not want to disturb the king in the middle of the night, so they all hid trembling under the eaves of walls, where we shall leave them.</P>
<P>The monster, still in his seat of honour, thought for a moment then drank another bowl of wine, dragged the woman towards him, and took two more gory mouthfuls of her. While he was enjoying himself inside the palace the news was being spread outside that the Tang Priest was really a tiger spirit. The rumour spread like wildfire, and it soon reached the government hostel. Nobody else was there but the white horse, who was eating fodder from a trough. This horse had once been a young dragon prince from the Western Sea who as a punishment for offending against the Heavenly Code had lost his horns and scales and been turned into a white horse to carry Sanzang to the West to fetch the scriptures.</P>
<P>When he heard it being said that the Tang Priest was a tiger spirit he thought, &#8220;My master is clearly a good man. That evil spirit must have changed him into a tiger to harm him, whatever shall I do? Monkey's been gone for ages, and there's no news of the other two.&#8221; By the middle of the night he could wait no longer.</P>
<P>He jumped up and said, &#8220;If I don't rescue the Tang Priest I'll win no merit at all.&#8221; He could restrain himself no longer, so he snapped his halter, shook his bridle and girths loose, and changed himself back into a dragon. Then he went straight up on a black cloud to the Ninth Heaven. There is a poem to prove it that goes:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On his journey West to worship the Buddha</P>
<P>Sanzang met an evil demon.</P>
<P>Now that he had been changed into a tiger</P>
<P>The white horse came to his rescue, trailing its halter.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>From up in the air the dragon saw the bright lights in the Hall of Silvery Peace, where eight wax candles were burning on eight great candlesticks. Bringing his cloud down for a closer look he saw the monster sitting by himself in the seat of honour and drinking as he ate human flesh. &#8220;Hopeless beast,&#8221; thought the dragon with a grin, &#8220;giving his game away like that. He's broken the counterpoise of his steelyard&#8212;he has exposed himself! A man-eater can't be a good fellow. Now I know what has happened to our master: he's met this foul ogre. I'll try to fool him. If it comes off there's still time to rescue our master.&#8221;</P>
<P>With a shake the splendid dragon king turned himself into a slim and seductive Palace Beauty. Hurrying inside he greeted the ogre and said, &#8220;If you spare my life, Your Highness, I'll hold your cup for you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Pour me out more wine,&#8221; he said. The young dragon took the pot and used a Water-controlling Spell to fill his cup so full that the wine stood several inches higher than the rim without spilling.</P>
<P>The monster, who did not know this piece of magic, was delighted with the trick; and when the dragon asked, &#8220;Shall I fill it higher still?&#8221; he replied, &#8220;Yes, yes.&#8221; The dragon lifted the pot and poured and poured. The wine rose till it towered as tall as a thirteen-storied pagoda, and still hardly any spilled over. The ogre opened his mouth wide and swallowed the lot, then pulled the dead girl towards him and took another bite.</P>
<P>&#8220;Can you sing?&#8221; he asked, and the dragon replied, &#8220;Yes, in a way.&#8221; He sang a short song and handed the ogre another cup of wine.</P>
<P>&#8220;Can you dance?&#8221; the ogre asked. &#8220;Yes, in a way,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;but I can't dance well empty-handed.&#8221; The ogre pushed his robe aside, brought out the sword he wore at his waist, unsheathed it, and handed it to the dragon, who took it and did a sword dance in front of the banqueting table.</P>
<P>As the monster gazed pop-eyed the dragon stopped dancing and hacked at his face. The ogre side-stepped and immediately seized a cast-iron lantern, that must have weighed a good hundredweight with its stand, with which to parry the sword. As the pair of them came out of the Hall of Silvery Peace, the dragon reverted to his true form and went up into mid-air on a cloud to continue the fight. It was a really vicious combat:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>One was a monster born and bred on Bowl Mountain;</P>
<P>The other was an exiled dragon from the Western Sea.</P>
<P>One shone as if he were breathing out lightning;</P>
<P>The other's vigor seemed to burst through the clouds.</P>
<P>One was like a white-tusked elephant in a crowd;</P>
<P>The other was a golden-clawed wildcat leaping down to earth.</P>
<P>One was a pillar of jade, towering to heaven,</P>
<P>The other was one of the ocean's golden beams.</P>
<P>The silver dragon danced,</P>
<P>The yellow monster soared,</P>
<P>As the blade cut tirelessly to left and right,</P>
<P>And the lantern flashed to and fro without a pause.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The old monster was as strong as ever, after eight or nine rounds of their battle in the clouds the young dragon was tiring and unable to keep up the fight, so he hurled his sword at the monster. The ogre used a magic trick to catch it, went for the helpless dragon, throwing the lantern at him and hitting him on the hind leg. The dragon brought his cloud straight down to earth, where the canal in the palace saved his life: once he had dived in, the ogre could not find him. Instead he went back to the Hall of Silvery Peace, clutching the sword and the candlestick. There he drank himself to sleep.</P>
<P>The dragon hid at the bottom of the canal for an hour, by which time all was quiet. Gritting his teeth against the pain from his leg, he leapt out of the water and went back to the hostel on a black cloud, where he turned himself back into a horse and bent over the trough once more. The poor animal was covered with sweat, and his leg was scarred.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Thought-horse and the Mind-ape had scattered,</P>
<P>The Lord of Metal and the Mother of Wood were dispersed.</P>
<P>The Yellow Wife was damaged, her powers divided,</P>
<P>The Way was finished, and how could it be saved?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We will leave Sanzang in danger and the dragon in defeat to return to Pig who had been hiding in the undergrowth ever since he abandoned Friar Sand. He had made himself a pigsty there, and slept through to the middle of the night. When he woke up he could not remember where he was. He rubbed his eyes, pulled himself together, and cocked up his ear. In these wild mountains no dogs barked and no cocks crowed. From the position of the stars he worked out that it was around midnight, and thought, &#8220;I must go back and rescue Friar Sand. It's all too true that 'You cannot make thread with a single strand, or clap with a single had,' No, no. I'd better go back to the city, see the master, and report on this to the king. He can give me some more brave soldiers to help me rescue Friar Sand.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot went back to the city on his cloud as fast as he could, and in an instant he was back at the hostel. It was a still, moonlit night, and he could not find his master in either wing of the building. There was only the white horse asleep there, his body covered in sweat, and with a greenish wound the size of a dish on his hind leg.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is double trouble,&#8221; thought Pig in horror. &#8220;Why is this wretch covered with sweat and injured on his leg? He hasn't been anywhere. Some crooks must have carried off the master and wounded the horse.&#8221;</P>
<P>Seeing Pig, the horse suddenly called out, &#8220;Elder brother.&#8221; Pig collapsed from shock, got up again, and was about to flee when the horse took his clothes between his teeth and said, &#8220;Brother, don't be afraid of me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why ever have you started to talk today?&#8221; asked Pig, who was shaking all over. &#8220;Something terrible must have happened to make you do it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Do you know that our master is in danger?&#8221; the horse asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; Pig replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;You wouldn't,&#8221; said the horse. &#8220;When you and Friar Sand were showing off in front of the king you thought you'd be able to catch the monster and be rewarded for it. Little did you imagine that his powers would be too much for you. You should be ashamed of the way you've come back by yourself without even having any news to report. That monster turned himself into a handsome scholar, came to the palace, and made the king accept him as his son-in-law. He changed our master into a tiger, who was captured by the officials and put in a cage in the court waiting room. The news made me feel as if my heart were being sliced to pieces. It was already two days since you two went, and for all I knew you might have been killed, so I had to turn back into a dragon and try to rescue our master. When I reached the court I couldn't find him, though I saw the monster outside the Hall of Silvery Peace. I changed into a Palace Beauty to trick him. He made me do a sword dance for him, and when I had him fascinated I took a cut at him. He dodged the blow, picked up a giant lantern in both hands, and soon had me on the run. I flung my sword at him, but he caught it, and wounded me on the hind leg by throwing the lantern at me. I escaped with my life by hiding in the palace canal. The scar is where he hit me with the candlestick.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Is this all true?&#8221; asked Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't think I'm trying to fool you,&#8221; said the dragon.</P>
<P>&#8220;What are we to do?&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;Can you move?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What if I can?&#8221; said the dragon.</P>
<P>&#8220;If you can move,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;then make your way back to the sea: I'll take the luggage back to Gao Village and be a married man again.&#8221; The dragon's reaction to this was to bite hard on Pig's tunic and not let him go. Tears rolled down his face as he said, &#8220;Please don't give up, elder brother.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What else can I do but give up?&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;Friar Sand has been captured by him, and I can't beat him, so what can we do but break up now?&#8221;</P>
<P>The dragon thought for a moment before replying, still in tears, &#8220;Don't even talk about breaking up, brother. All you need do to rescue the master is to ask someone to come here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Who?&#8221; asked Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;Take a cloud back to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit as fast as you can, and ask our eldest brother Monkey to come here. With his tremendous ability to beat demons he ought to be able to rescue the master and avenge your defeat.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Can't we ask someone else?&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;He hasn't been on the best of terms with me since he killed the White Bone Spirit on White Tiger Ridge. He's angry with me for encouraging the master to say the Band-tightening Spell. I only meant it as a joke&#8212;how was I to know the old monk would really say it and drive him away? Goodness knows how furious he is with me. He definitely won't come. I'm no match for him with my tongue, and if he's disrespectful enough to hit me a few times with that murderous great cudgel of his, it'll be the death of me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Of course he won't hit you,&#8221; said the dragon. &#8220;He's a kind and decent Monkey King. When you see him don't tell him that the master's in trouble. Just say, 'The master's missing you.' Once you've lured him here and he sees the situation he won't possibly be angry. He's bound to want to fight the monster. I guarantee that he'll capture the monster and save our master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Oh well,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;oh well. As you're so determined I'll have to go, or else I'll look half-hearted. If Monkey's prepared to come, I'll come back with him; but if he isn't, then don't expect me&#8212;I won't be back.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Go,&#8221; said the dragon. &#8220;I promise he'll come.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot picked up his rake, straightened his tunic, leapt up on a cloud, and headed East. Sanzang was fated to live. Pig had a following wind, so he stuck up his ears for sails and was at the Eastern Ocean in no time. He landed his cloud. Without his noticing it the sun rose as he made his way into the mountains.</P>
<P>As he was going along he suddenly heard voices. He looked carefully and saw Monkey in a mountain hollow with hordes of demons. He was perched on a rock, and in front of him over twelve hundred monkeys were drawn up in ranks and chanting, &#8220;Long live His Majesty the Great Sage.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He's doing very nicely,&#8221; thought Pig, &#8220;very nicely indeed. No wonder he wanted to come home instead of staying a monk. He has it really nice here, with a big place like this and all those little monkeys at his beck and call. If I'd had a mountain like this I'd never have become a monk. But what am I to do now I'm here? I must go and see him.&#8221; As he was rather overawed, Pig did not dare walk boldly over to see him. Instead he made his way round a grassy cliff, slipped in among the twelve hundred monkeys, and started to kowtow with them.</P>
<P>Little did he expect that the sharp-eyed Monkey would see him from his high throne and say, &#8220;There's a foreigner bowing all wrong among the ranks. Where's he from? Bring him here.&#8221; The words were hardly out of his mouth before some junior monkeys swarmed round him, shoved him forward, and threw him to the ground. &#8220;Where are you from, foreigner?&#8221; asked Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;If I may be permitted to argue,&#8221; replied Pig, his head bowed, &#8220;I'm no foreigner, I'm an old friend of yours.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;All my monkey hordes look exactly the same,&#8221; replied the Great Sage, &#8220;but from the look of your stupid face you must be an evil demon from somewhere else. Never mind though. If, as an outsider, you want to join my ranks you must first hand in a curriculum vitae and tell us your name before we can put you on the books. If I don't take you on, you've no business to be bowing to me like a madman.&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig put his arms round his head, which he still kept low, and replied, &#8220;I'm sorry. It's an ugly mug. But you and I were brothers for several years; you can't pretend not to recognize me and say that I'm a foreigner.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Raise your head,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>The idiot did so and said, &#8220;Look, even if you won't recognize the rest of me, you'll remember my face.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Pig!&#8221; said Monkey with a smile. When Pig heard this he leapt to his feet and said, &#8220;Yes, yes. I'm Pig,&#8221; thinking that Monkey would be easier to deal with now he had recognized him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why have you come here instead of going to fetch the scriptures with the Tang Priest?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;Have you offended the master and been sent back too? Show me your letter of dismissal.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I haven't offended him,&#8221; Pig replied. &#8220;He hasn't given me a letter of dismissal, or driven me away.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Then why have you come here?&#8221; asked Monkey. &#8220;The master sent me here to ask you back as he's missing you,&#8221; answered Pig. &#8220;He hasn't asked me back,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;and he doesn't miss me. He swore an oath by Heaven and wrote a letter of dismissal, so he couldn't possibly miss me or have sent you all this way to ask me back. It certainly wouldn't be right for me to go.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He's really missing you,&#8221; said Pig, lying desperately, &#8220;he really is.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;He called out 'disciple' when he was riding along. I didn't hear, and Friar Sand is deaf, so he started missing you and saying that we two were hopeless. He said that you were intelligent and clever, and that you always answered whenever he called. This made him miss you so badly that he sent me over here specially to ask you to come back. Please, please come back with me. You'll save him from disappointment and me from a long, wasted journey.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey jumped down from his rock, lifted Pig to his feet, and said, &#8220;Dear brother, it's been good of you to come so far. Won't you come and take a look round with me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's been a long journey,&#8221; replied Pig, &#8220;and I'm afraid that the master would miss me, so I'd better not.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Now that you're here,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you really should have a look at my mountain.&#8221; Not wanting to insist too hard, the idiot went off with him.</P>
<P>The two of them walked hand in hand with the monkey horde following behind as they climbed to the summit of the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. It was a beautiful mountain. In the few days since he had been back, Monkey had made it as neat as it ever had been.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>It was as green as flakes of malachite,</P>
<P>So high it touched the clouds.</P>
<P>All around it tigers crouched and dragons coiled,</P>
<P>Amid the calls of apes and cranes.</P>
<P>In the morning the peak was covered with cloud,</P>
<P>The evening sun would set between the trees.</P>
<P>The streams splashed like a tinkle of jade,</P>
<P>Waterfalls tumbled with the sound of lutes.</P>
<P>In the front of the mountain were cliffs and rock-faces</P>
<P>At the back were luxuriant plants and trees.</P>
<P>Above it reached to the Jade Girl's washing bowl,</P>
<P>Below it jointed the watershed of the River of Heaven.</P>
<P>In its combination of Earth and Heaven it rivaled the Penglai paradise;</P>
<P>Its blend of pure and solid made it a true cave palace.</P>
<P>It defied a painter's brush and colours;</P>
<P>Even a master could not have drawn it.</P>
<P>Intricate were the strange-shaped boulders,</P>
<P>Adorning the mountain peak.</P>
<P>In the sun's shadow shimmered a purple light;</P>
<P>A magical glow shone red throughout the sea of clouds.</P>
<P>Cave-heavens and paradises do exist on Earth,</P>
<P>Where the whole mountainside is covered with fresh trees and new blossoms.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As Pig gazed at it he said with delight, &#8220;What a wonderful place, brother. It's the finest mountain in the world.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Could you get by here?&#8221; asked Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;What a question,&#8221; said Pig with a grin. &#8220;This mountain of yours is an earthly paradise, so how could you talk about 'getting by?'&#8221;</P>
<P>The two talked and joked for a while then went back down. They saw some young monkeys kneeling beside the path and holding huge, purple grapes, fragrant dates and pears, deep golden loquats, and rich, red tree-strawberries.</P>
<P>&#8220;Please take some breakfast, Your Majesty,&#8221; they said.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother Pig,&#8221; replied Monkey with a smile, &#8220;Your big appetite won't be satisfied with fruit. Never mind though&#8212;if you don't think it too poor you can eat a little as a snack.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Although I do have a big appetite,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;I always eat the local food. Bring me a few to taste.&#8221;</P>
<P>As the pair of them ate the fruit the sun was rising, which made the idiot worry that he might be too late to save the Tang Priest. &#8220;Brother,&#8221; he said, trying to hurry Monkey up, &#8220;the master is waiting for us. He wants us back as soon as possible.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Come and look round the Water Curtain Cave,&#8221; was Monkey's reply.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's very good of you to offer,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;but I mustn't keep the master waiting, so I'm afraid I can't visit the cave.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Then I won't waste your time,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Goodbye.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Aren't you coming?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where to?&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;There's nobody to interfere with me here and I'm free to do just as I like. Why should I stop having fun and be a monk? I'm not going. You can go and tell the Tang Priest that as he's driven me away he can just I forget about me.&#8221; The idiot did not dare press Monkey harder in case he lost his temper and hit him a couple of blows with his cudgel. All he could do was mumble a farewell and be on his way.</P>
<P>As Monkey watched him go he detailed two stealthy young monkeys to follow him and listen to anything he said. The idiot had gone hardly a mile down the mountainside when he turned round, pointed towards Monkey, and started to abuse him.</P>
<P>&#8220;That ape,&#8221; he said, &#8220;he'd rather be a monster than a monk. The baboon. I asked him in all good faith and he turned me down. Well, if you won't come, that's that.&#8221; Every few paces he cursed him some more. The two young monkeys rushed back to report, &#8220;Your Majesty, that Pig is a disgrace. He's walking along cursing you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Arrest him,&#8221; shouted Monkey in a fury. The monkey hordes went after Pig, caught him, turned him upside-down, grabbed his bristles, pulled his ears, tugged his tail, twisted his hair, and thus brought him back. If you don't know how he was dealt with or whether he survived, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>	</div>

<p>邪魔侵正法</p>
<p>意马忆心猿</p>
</div>
<p>却说那怪把沙僧捆住，也不来杀他，也不曾打他，骂也不曾骂他一句，绰起钢刀，心中暗想道：“唐僧乃上邦人物，必知礼义，终不然我饶了他性命，又着他徒弟拿我不成？噫！这多是我浑家有甚么书信到他那国里，走了风讯！等我去问他一问。”那怪陡起凶性，要杀公主。</p>

<p>却说那公主不知，梳妆方毕，移步前来，只见那怪怒目攒眉，咬牙切齿。那公主还陪笑脸迎道：“郎君有何事这等烦恼？”</p>

<p>那怪咄的一声骂道：“你这狗心贱妇，全没人伦！我当初带你到此，更无半点儿说话。你穿的锦，戴的金，缺少东西我去寻，四时受用，每日情深。你怎么只想你父母，更无一点夫妇心？”那公主闻说，吓得跪倒在地，道：“郎君啊，你怎么今日说起这分离的话？”那怪道：“不知是我分离，是你分离哩！我把那唐僧拿来，算计要他受用，你怎么不先告过我，就放了他？原来是你暗地里修了书信，教他替你传寄；不然，怎么这两个和尚又来打上我门，教还你回去？这不是你干的事？”公主道：“郎君，你差怪我了，我何尝有甚书去？”老怪道：“你还强嘴哩！现拿住一个对头在此，却不是证见？”公主道：“是谁？”老妖道：“是唐僧第二个徒弟沙和尚。”原来人到了死处，谁肯认死，只得与他放赖。公主道：“郎君且息怒，我和你去问他一声。果然有书，就打死了，我也甘心；假若无书，却不枉杀了奴奴也？”那怪闻言，不容分说，轮开一只簸箕大小的蓝靛手，抓住那金枝玉叶的发万根，把公主揪上前，捽在地下，执着钢刀，却来审沙僧，咄的一声道：“沙和尚！你两个辄敢擅打上我们门来，可是这女子有书到他那国，国王教你们来的？”沙僧已捆在那里，见妖精凶恶之甚，把公主掼倒在地，持刀要杀。他心中暗想道：“分明是他有书去，救了我师父，此是莫大之恩。我若一口说出，他就把公主杀了，此却不是恩将仇报？罢罢罢！想老沙跟我师父一场，也没寸功报效，今日已此被缚，就将此性命与师父报了恩罢。”</p>

<p>遂喝道：“那妖怪不要无礼！他有甚么书来，你这等枉他，要害他性命！我们来此问你要公主，有个缘故，只因你把我师父捉在洞中，我师父曾看见公主的模样动静。及至宝象国，倒换关文，那皇帝将公主画影图形，前后访问，因将公主的形影，问我师父沿途可曾看见，我师父遂将公主说起，他故知是他儿女，赐了我等御酒，教我们来拿你，要他公主还宫。此情是实，何尝有甚书信？你要杀就杀了我老沙，不可枉害平人，大亏天理！”</p>

<p>那妖见沙僧说得雄壮，遂丢了刀，双手抱起公主道：“是我一时粗卤，多有冲撞，莫怪莫怪。”遂与他挽了青丝，扶上宝髻，软款温柔，怡颜悦色，撮哄着他进去了，又请上坐陪礼，那公主是妇人家水性，见他错敬，遂回心转意道：“郎君啊，你若念夫妇的恩爱，可把那沙僧的绳子略放松些儿。”老妖闻言，即命小的们把沙僧解了绳子，锁在那里。沙僧见解缚锁住，立起来，心中暗喜道：“古人云，与人方便，自己方便。我若不方便了他，他怎肯教把我松放松放？”</p>

<p>那老妖又教安排酒席，与公主陪礼压惊。吃酒到半酣，老妖忽的又换了一件鲜明的衣服，取了一口宝刀，佩在腰里，转过手，摸着公主道：“浑家，你且在家吃酒，看着两个孩儿，不要放了沙和尚。趁那唐僧在那国里，我也赶早儿去认认亲也。”公主道：“你认甚亲？”老妖道：“认你父王。我是他驸马，他是我丈人，怎么不去认认？”公主道：“你去不得。’老妖道：“怎么去不得？”公主道：“我父王不是马挣力战的江山，他本是祖宗遗留的社稷。自幼儿是太子登基，城门也不曾远出，没有见你这等凶汉。你这嘴脸相貌，生得这等丑陋，若见了他，恐怕吓了他，反为不美，却不如不去认的还好。”老妖道：“既如此说，我变个俊的儿去便罢。”公主道：“你试变来我看看。”好怪物，他在那酒席间，摇身一变，就变做一个俊俏之人，真个生得：形容典雅，体段峥嵘。言语多官样，行藏正妙龄。才如子建成诗易，貌似潘安掷果轻。头上戴一顶鹊尾冠，乌云敛伏；身上穿一件玉罗褶，广袖飘迎。足下乌靴花摺，腰间鸾带光明。丰神真是奇男子，耸壑轩昂美俊英。公主见了，十分欢喜。那妖笑道：“浑家，可是变得好么？”公主道：“变得好！变得好！你这一进朝啊，我父王是亲不灭，一定着文武多官留你饮宴。倘吃酒中间，千千仔细，万万个小心，却莫要现出原嘴脸来，露出马脚，走了风讯，就不斯文了。”老妖道：“不消吩咐，自有道理。’你看他纵云头，早到了宝象国，按落云光，行至朝门之外，对阁门大使道：“三驸马特来见驾，乞为转奏转奏。”那黄门奏事官来至白玉阶前，奏道：“万岁，有三驸马来见驾，现在朝门外听宣。”那国王正与唐僧叙话，忽听得三驸马，便问多官道：</p>

<p>“寡人只有两个驸马，怎么又有个三驸马？”多官道：“三驸马，必定是妖怪来了。”国王道：“可好宣他进来？”那长老心惊道：</p>

<p>“陛下，妖精啊，不精者不灵。他能知过去未来，他能腾云驾雾，宣他也进来，不宣他也进来，倒不如宣他进来，还省些口面。”</p>

<p>国王准奏叫宣，把怪宣至金阶，他一般的也舞蹈山呼的行礼。</p>

<p>多官见他生得俊丽，也不敢认他是妖精，他都是些肉眼凡胎，却当做好人。那国王见他耸壑昂霄，以为济世之梁栋，便问他：</p>

<p>“驸马，你家在那里居住？是何方人氏？几时得我公主配合？怎么今日才来认亲？”那老妖叩头道：“主公，臣是城东碗子山波月庄人家。”国王道：“你那山离此处多远？”老妖道：“不远，只有三百里。”国王道：“三百里路，我公主如何得到那里，与你匹配？”那妖精巧语花言虚情假意的答道：“主公，微臣自幼儿好习弓马，采猎为生。那十三年前，带领家童数十，放鹰逐犬，忽见一只斑斓猛虎，身驮着一个女子，往山坡下走。是微臣兜弓一箭，射倒猛虎，将女子带上本庄，把温水温汤灌醒，救了他性命。因问他是那里人家，他更不曾题公主二字。早说是万岁的三公主，怎敢欺心，擅自配合？当得进上金殿，大小讨一个官职荣身。只因他说是民家之女，才被微臣留在庄所，女貌郎才，两相情愿，故配合至此多年。当时配合之后，欲将那虎宰了，邀请诸亲，却是公主娘娘教且莫杀。其不杀之故，有几句言词，道得甚好，说道托天托地成夫妇，无媒无证配婚姻。前世赤绳曾系足，今将老虎做媒人。臣因此言，故将虎解了索子，饶了他性命。那虎带着箭伤，跑蹄剪尾而去。不知他得了性命，在那山中修了这几年，炼体成精，专一迷人害人。臣闻得昔年也有几次取经的，都说是大唐来的唐僧，想是这虎害了唐僧，得了他文引，变作那取经的模样，今在朝中哄骗主公。主公啊，那绣墩上坐的，正是那十三年前驮公主的猛虎，不是真正取经之人！”</p>

<p>你看那水性的君王，愚迷肉眼不识妖精，转把他一片虚词，当了真实，道：“贤驸马，你怎的认得这和尚是驮公主的老虎？”那妖道：“主公，臣在山中，吃的是老虎，穿的也是老虎，与他同眠同起，怎么不认得？”国王道：“你既认得，可教他现出本相来看。”怪物道：“借半盏净水，臣就教他现了本相。”国王命官取水，递与驸马。那怪接水在手，纵起身来，走上前，使个黑眼定身法，念了咒语，将一口水望唐僧喷去，叫声“变！”那长老的真身，隐在殿上，真个变作一只斑斓猛虎。此时君臣同眼观看，那只虎生得：白额圆头，花身电目。四只蹄，挺直峥嵘；二十爪，钩弯锋利。锯牙包口，尖耳连眉。狞狰壮若大猫形，猛烈雄如黄犊样。刚须直直插银条，刺舌騂騂喷恶气。果然是只猛斑斓，阵阵威风吹宝殿。国王一见，魄散魂飞，唬得那多官尽皆躲避。有几个大胆的武将，领着将军校尉一拥上前，使各项兵器乱砍，这一番，不是唐僧该有命不死，就是二十个僧人，也打为肉酱。此时幸有丁甲、揭谛、功曹、护教诸神，暗在半空中护佑，所以那些人，兵器皆不能打伤。众臣嚷到天晚，才把那虎活活的捉了，用铁绳锁了，放在铁笼里，收于朝房之内。</p>

<p>那国王却传旨，教光禄寺大排筵宴，谢驸马救拔之恩，不然，险被那和尚害了。当晚众臣朝散，那妖魔进了银安殿。又选十八个宫娥彩女，吹弹歌舞，劝妖魔饮酒作乐。那怪物独坐上席，左右排列的，都是那艳质娇姿，你看他受用。饮酒至二更时分，醉将上来，忍不住胡为，跳起身大笑一声，现了本相，陡发凶心，伸开簸箕大手，把一个弹琵琶的女子，抓将过来，扢咋的把头咬了一口。吓得那十七个宫娥，没命的前后乱跑乱藏，你看那：宫娥悚惧，彩女忙惊。宫娥悚惧，一似雨打芙蓉笼夜雨；彩女忙惊，就如风吹芍药舞春风。捽碎琵琶顾命，跌伤琴瑟逃生。出门那分南北，离殿不管西东。磕损玉面，撞破娇容。人人逃命走，各各奔残生。那些人出去又不敢吆喝，夜深了又不敢惊驾，都躲在那短墙檐下，战战兢兢不题。</p>

<p>却说那怪物坐在上面，自斟自酌。喝一盏，扳过人来，血淋淋的啃上两口。他在里面受用，外面人尽传道：“唐僧是个虎精！”乱传乱嚷，嚷到金亭馆驿。此时驿里无人，止有白马在槽上吃草吃料。他本是西海小龙王，因犯天条，锯角退鳞，变白马，驮唐僧往西方取经，忽闻人讲唐僧是个虎精，他也心中暗想道：“我师父分明是个好人，必然被怪把他变做虎精，害了师父。怎的好！怎的好？大师兄去得久了，八戒、沙僧又无音信！”</p>

<p>他只捱到二更时分，万籁无声，却才跳将起来道：“我今若不救唐僧，这功果休矣！休矣！”他忍不住，顿绝缰绳，抖松鞍辔，急纵身，忙显化，依然化作龙，驾起乌云，直上九霄空里观看。有诗为证，诗曰：三藏西来拜世尊，途中偏有恶妖氛。今宵化虎灾难脱，白马垂缰救主人。</p>

<p>小龙王在半空里，只见银安殿内，灯烛辉煌，原来那八个满堂红上，点着八根蜡烛。低下云头，仔细看处，那妖魔独自个在上面，逼法的饮酒吃人肉哩。小龙笑道：“这厮不济！走了马脚，识破风讯，躧匾秤铊了吃人，可是个长进的！却不知我师父下落何如，倒遇着这个泼怪。且等我去戏他一戏，若得手，拿住妖精再救师父不迟。”好龙王，他就摇身一变，也变做个宫娥，真个身体轻盈，仪容娇媚，忙移步走入里面，对妖魔道声万福：</p>

<p>“驸马啊，你莫伤我性命，我来替你把盏。”那妖道：“斟酒来。”</p>

<p>小龙接过壶来，将酒斟在他盏中，酒比锺高出三五分来，更不漫出，这是小龙使的逼水法。那怪见了不识，心中喜道：“你有这般手段！”小龙道：“还斟得有几分高哩。”那怪道：“再斟上！</p>

<p>再斟上！”他举着壶，只情斟，那酒只情高，就如十三层宝塔一般，尖尖满满，更不漫出些须。那怪物伸过嘴来，吃了一锺，扳着死人，吃了一口，道：“会唱么？”小龙道：“也略晓得些儿。”依腔韵唱了一个小曲，又奉了一锺。那怪道：“你会舞么？”小龙道：“也略晓得些儿，但只是素手，舞得不好看。”那怪揭起衣服，解下腰间所佩宝剑，掣出鞘来，递与小龙。小龙接了刀，就留心，在那酒席前，上三下四、左五右六，丢开了花刀法。那怪看得眼咤，小龙丢了花字，望妖精劈一刀来。好怪物，侧身躲过，慌了手脚，举起一根满堂红，架住宝刀。那满堂红原是熟铁打造的，连柄有八九十斤。两个出了银安殿，小龙现了本相，却驾起云头，与那妖魔在那半空中相杀。这一场，黑地里好杀！怎见得：那一个是碗子山生成的怪物，这一个是西洋海罚下的真龙。一个放毫光，如喷白电：一个生锐气，如迸红云。一个好似白牙老象走人间，一个就如金爪狸猫飞下界。一个是擎天玉柱，一个是架海金梁。银龙飞舞，黄鬼翻腾。左右宝刀无怠慢，往来不歇满堂红。他两个在云端里，战彀八九回合，小龙的手软筋麻，老魔的身强力壮。小龙抵敌不住，飞起刀去，砍那妖怪，妖怪有接刀之法，一只手接了宝刀，一只手抛下满堂红便打，小龙措手不及，被他把后腿上着了一下，急慌慌按落云头，多亏了御水河救了性命。小龙一头钻下水去，那妖魔赶来寻他不见，执了宝刀，拿了满堂红，回上银安殿，照旧吃酒睡觉不题。</p>

<p>却说那小龙潜于水底，半个时辰听不见声息，方才咬着牙，忍着腿疼跳将起去，踏着乌云，径转馆驿，还变作依旧马匹，伏于槽下。可怜浑身是水，腿有伤痕，那时节：意马心猿都失散，金公木母尽凋零。黄婆伤损通分别，道义消疏怎得成！</p>

<p>且不言三藏逢灾，小龙败战，却说那猪八戒，从离了沙僧，一头藏在草科里，拱了一个猪浑塘。这一觉，直睡到半夜时候才醒。醒来时，又不知是甚么去处，摸摸眼，定了神思，侧耳才听，噫！正是那山深无犬吠，野旷少鸡鸣。他见那星移斗转，约莫有三更时分，心中想道：“我要回救沙僧，诚然是单丝不线，孤掌难鸣。罢！罢！罢！我且进城去见了师父，奏准当今，再选些骁勇人马，助着老猪明日来救沙僧罢。”</p>

<p>那呆子急纵云头，径回城里，半霎时，到了馆驿。此时人静月明，两廊下寻不见师父，只见白马睡在那厢，浑身水湿，后腿有盘子大小一点青痕。八戒失惊道：“双晦气了！这亡人又不曾走路，怎么身上有汗，腿有青痕？想是歹人打劫师父，把马打坏了。”那白马认得是八戒，忽然口吐人言，叫声“师兄！”这呆子吓了一跌，扒起来往外要走，被那马探探身，一口咬住皂衣，道：“哥啊，你莫怕我。”八戒战兢兢的道：“兄弟，你怎么今日说起话来了？你但说话，必有大不祥之事。”小龙道：“你知师父有难么！”八戒道：“我不知。”小龙道：“你是不知！你与沙僧在皇帝面前弄了本事，思量拿倒妖魔，请功求赏，不想妖魔本领大，你们手段不济，禁他不过。好道着一个回来，说个信息是，却更不闻音。那妖精变做一个俊俏文人，撞入朝中，与皇帝认了亲眷，把我师父变作一个斑斓猛虎，见被众臣捉住，锁在朝房铁笼里面。我听得这般苦恼，心如刀割。你两日又不在不知，恐一时伤了性命。只得化龙身去救，不期到朝里，又寻不见师父。</p>

<p>及到银安殿外，遇见妖精，我又变做个宫娥模样，哄那怪物。那怪叫我舞刀他看，遂尔留心，砍他一刀，早被他闪过，双手举个满堂红，把我战败。我又飞刀砍去，他又把刀接了，捽下满堂红，把我后腿上着了一下，故此钻在御水河，逃得性命。腿上青是他满堂红打的。”八戒闻言道：“真个有这样事？”小龙道：“莫成我哄你了！”八戒道：“怎的好？怎的好！你可挣得动么？”小龙道：“我挣得动便怎的？”八戒道：“你挣得动，便挣下海去罢。</p>

<p>把行李等老猪挑去高老庄上，回炉做女婿去呀。”小龙闻说，一口咬住他直裰子，那里肯放，止不住眼中滴泪道：“师兄啊！你千万休生懒惰！”八戒道：“不懒惰便怎么？沙兄弟已被他拿住，我是战不过他，不趁此散火，还等甚么？”小龙沉吟半晌，又滴泪道：“师兄啊，莫说散火的话，若要救得师父，你只去请个人来。”八戒道：“教我请谁么？”小龙道：“你趁早儿驾云回上花果山，请大师兄孙行者来。他还有降妖的大法力，管教救了师父，也与你我报得这败阵之仇。”八戒道：“兄弟，另请一个儿便罢了，那猴子与我有些不睦。前者在白虎岭上，打杀了那白骨夫人，他怪我撺掇师父念《紧箍儿咒》。我也只当耍子，不想那老和尚当真的念起来，就把他赶逐回去，他不知怎么样的恼我，他也决不肯来。倘或言语上，略不相对，他那哭丧棒又重，假若不知高低，捞上几下，我怎的活得成么？”小龙道：“他决不打你，他是个有仁有义的猴王。你见了他，且莫说师父有难，只说师父想你哩，把他哄将来，到此处见这样个情节，他必然不忿，断乎要与那妖精比并，管情拿得那妖精，救得我师父。”八戒道：“也罢也罢，你倒这等尽心，我若不去，显得我不尽心了。我这一去，果然行者肯来，我就与他一路来了；他若不来，你却也不要望我，我也不来了。”小龙道：“你去你去，管情他来也。”</p>

<p>真个呆子收拾了钉钯，整束了直裰，跳将起去，踏着云，径往东来。这一回，也是唐僧有命，那呆子正遇顺风，撑起两个耳朵，好便似风篷一般，早过了东洋大海，按落云头。不觉的太阳星上，他却入山寻路。正行之际，忽闻得有人言语。八戒仔细看时，看来是行者在山凹里，聚集群妖。他坐在一块石头崖上，面前有一千二百多猴子，分序排班，口称“万岁！大圣爷爷！”八戒道：“且是好受用，且是好受用！怪道他不肯做和尚，只要来家哩！原来有这些好处，许大的家业，又有这多的小猴伏侍！若是老猪有这一座山场，也不做甚么和尚了。如今既到这里，却怎么好？必定要见他一见是。”那呆子有些怕他，又不敢明明的见他，却往草崖边，溜阿溜的溜在那一千二三百猴子当中挤着，也跟那些猴子磕头。</p>

<p>不知孙大圣坐得高，眼又乖滑，看得他明白，便问：“那班部中乱拜的是个夷人，是那里来的？拿上来！”说不了，那些小猴一窝蜂把个八戒推将上来，按倒在地。行者道：“你是那里来的夷人？”八戒低着头道：“不敢，承问了。不是夷人，是熟人熟人。”行者道：“我这大圣部下的群猴，都是一般模样。你这嘴脸生得各样，相貌有些雷堆，定是别处来的妖魔。既是别处来的，若要投我部下，先来递个脚色手本，报了名字，我好留你在这随班点扎。若不留你，你敢在这里乱拜！”八戒低着头，拱着嘴道：“不羞，就拿出这副嘴脸来了！我和你兄弟也做了几年，又推认不得，说是甚么夷人！”行者笑道：“抬起头来我看。”那呆子把嘴往上一伸道：“你看么！你认不得我，好道认得嘴耶！”行者忍不住笑道：“猪八戒。”他听见一声叫，就一毂辘跳将起来道：“正是！正是！我是猪八戒！”他又思量道：“认得就好说话了。”行者道：“你不跟唐僧取经去，却来这里怎的？想是你冲撞了师父，师父也贬你回来了？有甚贬书，拿来我看。”八戒道：</p>

<p>“不曾冲撞他，他也没甚么贬书，也不曾赶我。”行者道：“既无贬书，又不曾赶你，你来我这里怎的？”八戒道：“师父想你，着我来请你的。”行者道：“他也不请我，他也不想我。他那日对天发誓，亲笔写了贬书，怎么又肯想我，又肯着你远来请我？我断然也是不好去的。”八戒就地扯个谎，忙道：“委实想你！委是想你！”行者道：“他怎的想我来？”八戒道：“师父在马上正行，叫声徒弟，我不曾听见，沙僧又推耳聋。师父就想起你来，说我们不济，说你还是个聪明伶俐之人，常时声叫声应，问一答十。因这般想你，专专教我来请你的，万望你去走走，一则不孤他仰望之心，二来也不负我远来之意。”行者闻言，跳下崖来，用手搀住八戒道：“贤弟，累你远来，且和我耍耍儿去。”八戒道：“哥啊，这个所在路远，恐师父盼望去迟，我不耍子了。”行者道：</p>

<p>“你也是到此一场，看看我的山景何如。”那呆子不敢苦辞，只得随他走走。</p>

<p>二人携手相搀，概众小妖随后，上那花果山极巅之处。好山！自是那大圣回家，这几日，收拾得复旧如新，但见那：青如削翠，高似摩云。周围有虎踞龙蟠，四面多猿啼鹤唳。朝出云封山顶，暮观日挂林间。流水潺潺鸣玉珮，涧泉滴滴奏瑶琴。山前有崖峰峭壁，山后有花木秾华。上连玉女洗头盆，下接天河分派水。乾坤结秀赛蓬莱，清浊育成真洞府。丹青妙笔画时难，仙子天机描不就。玲珑怪石石玲珑，玲珑结彩岭头峰。日影动千条紫艳，瑞气摇万道红霞。洞天福地人间有，遍山新树与新花。八戒观之不尽，满心欢喜道：“哥啊，好去处！果然是天下第一名山！”行者道：“贤弟，可过得日子么？”八戒笑道：“你看师兄说的话，宝山乃洞天福地之处，怎么说度日之言也？“二人谈笑多时，下了山，只见路旁有几个小猴，捧着紫巍巍的葡萄，香喷喷的梨枣，黄森森的枇杷，红艳艳的杨梅，跪在路旁叫道：</p>

<p>“大圣爷爷，请进早膳。”行者笑道：“我猪弟食肠大，却不是以果子作膳的。也罢也罢，莫嫌菲薄，将就吃个儿当点心罢。”八戒道：“我虽食肠大，却也随乡入乡是。拿来拿来，我也吃几个儿尝新。”二人吃了果子，渐渐日高。那呆子恐怕误了救唐僧，只管催促道：“哥哥，师父在那里盼望我和你哩。望你和我早早儿去罢。”行者道：“贤弟，请你往水帘洞里去耍耍。”八戒坚辞道：“多感老兄盛意，奈何师父久等，不劳进洞罢。”行者道：“既如此，不敢久留，请就此处奉别。”八戒道：“哥哥，你不去了？”</p>

<p>行者道：“我往哪里去？我这里天不收地不管，自由自在，不耍子儿，做甚么和尚？我是不去，你自去罢。但上复唐僧：既赶退了，再莫想我。”呆子闻言，不敢苦逼，只恐逼发他性子，一时打上两棍，无奈，只得喏喏告辞，找路而去。行者见他去了，即差两个溜撒的小猴，跟着八戒，听他说些甚么。真个那呆子下了山，不上三四里路，回头指着行者，口里骂道：“这个猴子，不做和尚，倒做妖怪！这个猢狲，我好意来请他，他却不去！你不去便罢！”走几步，又骂几声。那两个小猴，急跑回来报道：“大圣爷爷，那猪八戒不大老实，他走走儿，骂几声。”行者大怒，叫：</p>

<p>“拿将来！”那众猴满地飞来赶上，把个八戒，扛翻倒了，抓鬃扯耳，拉尾揪毛，捉将回去，毕竟不知怎么处治，性命死活若何，且听下回分解。
