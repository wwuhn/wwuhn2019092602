<P>The story goes on to tell how after being given a name the Handsome Monkey King jumped for joy and bowed to Subhuti to express his thanks. The Patriarch then ordered the others to take Sun Wukong out through the double doors and teach him how to sprinkle and sweep the floor, answer orders, and deport himself properly. All the Immortals went out in obedience to this command. When Sun Wukong was outside the doors he bowed to all his spiritual elder brothers and laid out his bed on the verandah. The next morning and every following day he studied language and deportment under his spiritual elder brothers, expounded the scriptures, discussed the Way, practiced calligraphy, and burnt incense. When he had any spare time he would sweep the grounds, dig the vegetable patch, grow flowers, tend trees, look for kindling, light the fire, carry water, and fetch soy. Everything he needed was provided. Thus six or seven years slipped by in the cave without his noticing them. One day the Patriarch took his seat on the dais, called all the Immortals together, and began to explain the Great Way.</p>

<P>As Monkey sat at the side listening to the exposition he was so delighted that he tugged at his ear, scratched his cheek and smiled. He could not help waving his hands and stamping. When the Patriarch noticed this he said to Monkey, &#8220;Why are you leaping around like a madman in class instead of listening to the lesson?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your disciple is listening to the exposition with all his attention,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;but your marvellous words made me so happy that I started jumping around without realizing what I was doing. Please forgive me.&#8221;</P>
<P>To this the Patriarch replied, &#8220;If you really understand my marvellous words, then answer this question. How long have you been in my cave?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You disciple was born stupid,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;so I've no idea how long I've been here. All I know is that whenever the fire in the stove goes out I go to the other side of the mountain to collect firewood and there I see a hill covered with fine peach trees. I've had seven good feeds of peaches there.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That hill is called Tender Peach Hill. If you have eaten there seven times you must have been here seven years. What sort of Way do you want to learn from me?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That depends what you teach me, master. As long as there's a whiff of Way to it, your disciple will learn it.&#8221;</p>

<p>孙悟空在旁闻讲，喜得他抓耳挠腮，眉花眼笑，忍不住手之舞之，足之蹈之。忽被祖师看见，叫孙悟空道：“你在班中，怎么颠狂跃舞，不听我讲？”悟空道：“弟子诚心听讲，听到老师父妙音处，喜不自胜，故不觉作此踊跃之状。望师父恕罪！”祖师道：“你既识妙音，我且问你，你到洞中多少时了？”悟空道：“弟子本来懵懂，不知多少时节，只记得灶下无火，常去山后打柴，见一山好桃树，我在那里吃了七次饱桃矣。”祖师道：“那山唤名烂桃山。你既吃七次，想是七年了。你今要从我学些什么道？”悟空道：“但凭尊师教诲，只是有些道气儿，弟子便就学了。”</p>

<P>&#8220;There are three hundred and sixty side-entrances to the Way, and they all lead to a True Result,&#8221; the Patriarch said. &#8220;Which branch would you like to study?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I will do whatever you think best, master,&#8221; replied Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;What about teaching you the Way of Magic Arts?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What does 'the Way of Magic Arts' mean?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Magic arts,&#8221; the Patriarch replied, &#8220;include summoning Immortals, using the magic sandboard, and divining by milfoil. With them one can learn how to bring on good fortune and avert disaster.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Can you become immortal this way?&#8221; asked Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;No, certainly not,&#8221; replied the Patriarch.</P>
<P>&#8220;No. Shan't learn it.&#8221;</p>

<p>祖师道：“‘道’字门中有三百六十旁门，旁门皆有正果。不知你学那一门哩？”悟空道：“凭尊师意思，弟子倾心听从。”祖师道：“我教你个‘术’字门中之道如何？”悟空道：“术门之道怎么说？”祖师道：“术字门中，乃是些请仙扶鸾，问卜揲蓍，能知趋吉避凶之理。”悟空道：“似这般可得长生么？”祖师道：“不能，不能！”悟空道：“不学，不学！”</p>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<P>&#8220;Shall I teach you the Way of Sects?&#8221; the Patriarch asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;What are the principles of the Sects?&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Within the branch of Sects, there is Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, the study of the Negative and Positive, Mohism, medicine, reading scriptures and chanting the name of a Buddha. You can also summon Immortals and Sages with this branch.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Can you attain immortality that way?&#8221; asked Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;To try and attain immortality that way,&#8221; the Patriarch replied, &#8220;is like 'putting a pillar in the wall.'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;I'm a simple chap and I can't understand your technical jargon. What do you mean by 'putting a pillar in the wall?'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;When a man builds a house and wants to make it strong he puts a pillar in the wall. But when the day comes for his mansion to collapse the pillar is bound to rot.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;From what you say,&#8221; Monkey observed, &#8220;it's not eternal. No. Shan't learn it.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>祖师又道：“教你‘流’字门中之道如何？”悟空又问：“流字门中是甚义理？”祖师道：“流字门中，乃是儒家、释家、道家、阴阳家、墨家、医家，或看经，或念佛，并朝真降圣之类。”悟空道：“似这般可得长生么？”祖师道：“若要长生，也似壁里安柱。”悟空道：“师父，我是个老实人，不晓得打市语。怎么谓之‘壁里安柱’？”祖师道：“人家盖房欲图坚固，将墙壁之间立一顶柱，有日大厦将颓，他必朽矣。”悟空道：“据此说，也不长久。不学，不学！”

<P>&#8220;Shall I teach you the Way of Silence?&#8221; the Patriarch then asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;What True Result can be got from Silence?&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;It involves abstaining from grain, preserving one's essence, silence, inaction, meditation, abstaining from speech, eating vegetarian food, performing certain exercises when asleep or standing up, going into trances, and being walled up in total isolation.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Is this a way of becoming immortal?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's like building the top of a kiln with sun-dried bricks,&#8221; the patriarch replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;You do go on, master,&#8221; said Sun Wukong. &#8220;I've already told you that I can't understand your technical jargon. What does 'building the top of a kiln with sun-dried bricks' mean?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you build the top of a kiln with sun-dried bricks they may make it look all right, but if they have not been hardened with fire and water, then they will crumble away in the first heavy rainstorm.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's nothing eternal about that either, then,&#8221; replied Monkey. &#8220;No. Shan't learn that.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>祖师道：“教你‘静’字门中之道如何？”悟空道：“静字门中是甚正果？”祖师道：“此是休粮守谷，清静无为，参禅打坐，戒语持斋，或睡功，或立功，并入定坐关之类。”悟空道：“这般也能长生么？”祖师道：“也似窑头土坯。”悟空笑道：“师父果有些滴<span style="background-color:#ccc;">氵达</span>。一行说我不会打市语。怎么谓之‘窑头土坯’？”祖师道：“就如那窑头上，造成砖瓦之坯，虽已成形，尚未经水火锻炼，一朝大雨滂沱，他必滥矣。”悟空道：“也不长远。不学，不学！”

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<P>&#8220;Shall I teach you the Way of Action then?&#8221; the Patriarch asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;What's that like?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;It involves acting and doing, extracting the Negative and building up the Positive, drawing the bow and loading the crossbow, rubbing the navel to make the subtle humors flow, refining elixirs according to formulae, lighting fires under cauldrons, consuming 'Red lead,' purifying 'Autumn Stone,' and drinking women's milk.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Can doing things like that make me live for ever?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;To try and attain immortality that way is like 'lifting the moon out of water.'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What does 'lifting the moon out of water' mean?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The moon is in the sky,&#8221; the Patriarch replied, &#8220;and only its reflection is in the water. Although you can see it there, you will try in vain to lift it out.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No. Shan't learn that,&#8221; Monkey exclaimed.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>祖师道：“教你‘动’字门中之道如何？”悟空道：“动门之道却又怎么？”祖师道：“此是有为有作，采阴补阳，攀弓踏弩，摩脐过气，用方炮制，烧茅打鼎，进红铅，炼秋石，并服妇乳之类。”悟空道：“似这等也得长生么？”祖师道：“此欲长生，亦如水中捞月。”悟空道：“师父又来了。怎么叫做‘水中捞月’？”祖师道：“月在长空，水中有影，虽然看见，只是无捞摸处，到底只成空耳。”悟空道：“也不学，不学！”

<div class="left">
<P>When the Patriarch heard this he gasped and climbed down from his dais. Pointing at Sun Wukong with his cane he said, &#8220;You won't study this and you won't study that, so what do you want, you monkey?&#8221; He went up to Monkey and hit him three times on the head, then went inside with his hands behind his back and shut the main door, abandoning them all. The class was shocked, and they all blamed Sun Wukong.</P>
<P>&#8220;You cheeky ape, you've no idea how to behave. The master was teaching you the Way, so why did you have to argue with him instead of learning from him? Now you've offended him we don't know when he'll come out again.&#8221; They were all very angry with him and regarded him with loathing and contempt. But Sun Wukong was not bothered in the least, and his face was covered with smiles.</P>
<P>The Monkey King had understood the riddle, and had the answer hidden away in his mind. So he did not argue with the others but bore it all without a word. When the Patriarch hit him three times he had been telling him to pay attention at the third watch; and when he went inside with his hands behind his back and shut the main door he had told the Monkey King to go in through the back door and be taught the Way in secret.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
<p>祖师闻言，咄的一声，跳下高台，手持戒尺，指定悟空道：“你这猢狲，这般不学，那般不学，却待怎么？”走上前，将悟空头上打了三下，倒背着手，走入里面，将中门关了，撇下大众而去。唬得那一班听讲的，人人惊惧，皆怨悟空道：“你这泼猴，十分无状！师父传你道法，如何不学，却与师父顶嘴！这番冲撞了他，不知几时才出来呵！”此时俱甚报怨他，又鄙贱嫌恶他。悟空一些儿也不恼，只是满脸陪笑。原来那猴王已打破盘中之谜，暗暗在心。所以不与众人争竞，只是忍耐无言。祖师打他三下者，教他三更时分存心；倒背着手走入里面，将中门关上者，教他从后门进步，秘处传他道也。

<P>The delighted Sun Wukong spent the rest of that day with the others in front of the Three Stars Cave, looking at the sky and impatient for night to come. At dusk he went to bed like all the others, pretended to close his eyes, controlled his breathing, and calmed himself down. Nobody beats the watches or calls out the hour in the mountains, so he had no way of knowing the time except by regulating the breath going in and out of his nose. When he reckoned that it was about the third watch he got up very quietly, dressed, and slipped out through the front door away from the others. When he was outside he looked up and saw</p>

<P>Watch the Monkey King as he follows the old path to the back door, which he found to be ajar. &#8220;The Patriarch has left the door open, so he really intends to teach me the Way,&#8221; he exclaimed in delight. He tiptoed toward, went in sideways through the door, and walked over to the Patriarch's bed, where he saw the Patriarch sleeping curled up, facing the inside of the room. Not daring to disturb him, Sun Wukong knelt in front of the bed. Before long the Patriarch woke up, stretched out both his legs, and mumbled to himself:</p>

<P>Sun Wukong said in reply, &#8220;Master, your disciple has been kneeling here for a long time.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the Patriarch heard that it was Sun Wukong who was speaking he pulled some clothes on, sat up cross-legged, and shouted, &#8220;It's that monkey. Why have you come into my room instead of sleeping out in front?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master, you told me publicly in front of the altar yesterday that your disciple was to come in here through the back gate at the third watch as you were going to teach me the Way. That is why I made so bold as to come to pay my respects beside my master's bed.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Patriarch was very pleased to hear this and said to himself, &#8220;This wretch was indeed born of Heaven and Earth. Otherwise he wouldn't have been able to understand my cryptic message.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sun Wukong said, &#8220;There is no third pair of ears in this room; your disciple is the only other person here. I hope, master, that in your great mercy you will teach me the Way of Immortality. If you do, I'll always be grateful to you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You are predestined,&#8221; the Patriarch said, &#8220;so I shall be happy to tell you. Since you understood my cryptic message, come over here and listen carefully while I teach you the miraculous Way of Immortality.&#8221; Sun Wukong kowtowed with gratitude and knelt before the bed, listening with all his attention.

He bowed to the Patriarch to express his deep gratitude and went out of the back door to look. He saw that there was a trace of white in the East, while the golden light of the moon was shining in the West. He went to the front door by the old path, pushed it open gently, and went in.</P>

<P>After three years had passed in this way the Patriarch once more sat on his lecturing throne and expounded the Dharma to the students. He recounted famous sayings and parables, and discussed external phenomena and external appearances.</P>
<P>Without warning he asked, &#8220;Where is Sun Wukong?&#8221; Sun Wukong went forward, knelt down and replied, &#8220;Your disciple is present.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What Way have you cultivated since coming here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your disciple is now fairly well conversant with the Dharma,&#8221; Sun Wukong replied, &#8220;and my Source is getting gradually stronger.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you are conversant with the Dharma and you know about the Source,&#8221; the Patriarch replied, &#8220;and if the spirit has already flowed into you, then you must beware of the 'Three Disasters.'&#8221;</P>
<P>Sun Wukong thought for a long time, then he said, &#8220;Patriarch, you're talking rubbish. I have often heard that the Way is lofty and its power mighty, that it is as eternal as Heaven, that it can overcome fire and water, and prevent all illnesses from arising, so how could there be &#8220;Three Disasters?'&#8221;</P>
<P>To this the Patriarch replied, &#8220;This is not the ordinary Way: it involves seizing the very creation of Heaven and Earth, and encroaching on the hidden workings of the sun and moon. Once the elixir is made, devils and spirits cannot tolerate it. Although it will preserve the youthfulness of your face and prolong your life, in five hundred years' time Heaven will strike you with a thunderbolt. You must be clear-sighted in nature and mind, so that you can hide from it before it comes. If you succeed in avoiding it you will live as long as Heaven; and if you don't, it will kill you. Another five hundred years later Heaven will burn you with fire. This fire will be not heavenly fire or ordinary fire but 'hidden fire'. It will burn you from the soles of your feet to the crown of your head; your five viscera will be reduced to ashes, your four limbs will be destroyed, and a thousand years of asceticism will have been so much wasted time. Yet another five hundred years later a wind will blow at you. It will not be the North, South, East, or West wind, nor will it be a warm, fragrant wind from the Northwest; nor will it be the kind of wind that blows among flowers, willows, pine, and bamboo. It will be what is called a 'monster wind'. It will blow through the crown of your head down into your six entrails. It will go through the Cinnabar Field below your navel and penetrate your nine orifices. Your flesh and your bones will be destroyed and your body will disintegrate. So you must avoid all three of these disasters.&#8221;</P>
<P>When he heard this Sun Wukong's hair stood on end, and he kowtowed with the words, &#8220;I implore you, my lord, to show pity and teach me how to avoid these three disasters. If you do I will be grateful to you for ever.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;That would be easy,&#8221; the Patriarch replied, &#8220;but for the fact that you are different from other people&#8212;which means that I can't.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have a head that faces the sky and feet standing on earth,&#8221; said Sun Wukong. &#8220;I have nine orifices and four limbs, five viscera and six entrails. How am I different from anyone else?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Although you are quite like other people, your cheeks are too small.&#8221; Now the Monkey had a funny face, with cheeks that caved inwards and a sharp chin.</P>
<P>Sun Wukong felt it with his hand and replied with a laugh, &#8220;Master, you didn't take everything into account. Although I'm a bit short of jaw, I've got more dewlap than other people to make up for it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well then,&#8221; the Patriarch said, &#8220;which would you prefer to learn: the thirty-six heavenly transformations or the seventy-two earthly ones?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your disciple wants to get as much out of it as he can, so I would like to learn the seventy-two earthly ones.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If that's what you want,&#8221; the Patriarch replied, &#8220;come here and I'll teach you the spells.&#8221; Thereupon he whispered into Sun Wukong's ear, and who knows what miraculous spells he taught him? The Monkey King was the sort of person who understands everything once he is told a tiny part, and he learned the spells on the spot. He practiced and trained until he had mastered all seventy-two transformations. </p>

<p>却早过了三年，祖师复登宝座，与众说法。谈的是公案比语，论的是外像包皮。忽问：“悟空何在？”悟空近前跪下：“弟子有。”祖师道：“你这一向修些什么道来？”悟空道：“弟子近来法性颇通，根源亦渐坚固矣。”祖师道：“你既通法性，会得根源，已注神体，却只是防备着三灾利害。”悟空听说，沉吟良久道：“师父之言谬矣。我尝闻道高德隆，与天同寿，水火既济，百病不生，却怎么有个‘三灾利害’？”祖师道：“此乃非常之道，夺天地之造化，侵日月之玄机。丹成之后，鬼神难容。虽驻颜益寿，但到了五百年后，天降雷灾打你，须要见性明心，预先躲避。躲得过寿与天齐，躲不过就此绝命。再五百年后，天降火灾烧你。这火不是天火，亦不是凡火，唤做阴火。自本身涌泉穴下烧起，直透泥垣宫，五脏成灰，四肢皆朽，把千年苦行，俱为虚幻。再五百年，又降风灾吹你。这风不是东南西北风，不是和熏金朔风，亦不是花柳松竹风，唤做鸹风。自囟门中吹入六腑，过丹田，穿九窍，骨肉消疏，其身自解。所以都要躲过。”悟空闻说，毛骨悚然，叩头礼拜道：“万望老爷垂悯，传与躲避三灾之法，到底不敢忘恩。”祖师道：“此亦无难，只是你比他人不同，故传不得。”悟空道：“我也头圆顶天，足方履地，一般有九窍四肢，五脏六腑，何以比人不同？”祖师道：“你虽然像人，却比人少腮。”原来那猴子孤拐面，凹脸尖嘴。悟空伸手一摸，笑道：“师父没成算。我虽少腮，却比人多这个素袋，亦可准折过也。”祖师说：“也罢，你要学那一般？有一般天罡数，该三十六般变化；有一般地煞数，该七十二般变化。”悟空道：“弟子愿多里捞摸，学一个地煞变化罢。”祖师道：“既如此，上前来，传与你口诀。”遂附耳低言，不知说了些什么妙法。这猴王也是他一窍通时百窍通，当时习了口诀，自修自炼，将七十二般变化都学成了。</p>

<P>One day the Patriarch and all his disciples were enjoying the sunset outside the Three Stars Cave.The Patriarch asked Sun Wukong, &#8220;Have you succeeded yet?&#8221;</P>
<P>Sun Wukong replied, &#8220;Thanks to your infinite mercy, master, your disciple's results have been perfect, and I can now rise on the clouds and fly.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Let me see you try a flight,&#8221; the Patriarch said. Sun Wukong used his skill to perform a series of somersaults that carried him fifty or sixty feet into the air, then walked around on the clouds for about as long as it takes to eat a meal.</P>
<P>He covered about a mile altogether before landing in front of the Patriarch, folding his arms across his chest, and saying, &#8220;Master, that's flying and soaring in the clouds.&#8221; The Patriarch laughed.</P>
<P>&#8220;That's not soaring on the clouds&#8212;it's just climbing up them. There is an old saying that 'an Immortal visits the Northern Sea in the morning and Cangwu in the evening'. But to take as long as you did just to go a mile doesn't count as climbing on the clouds.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How can it be possible to visit the Northern Sea in the morning and Cangwu in the evening?&#8221; Sun Wukong asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;All cloud-soarers start off from the Northern Sea early in the morning, visit the Eastern, Western and Southern Seas, and then come back to Cangwu; Cangwu is what the Northern Sea is called in the Lingling language. When you can go beyond all four seas in a single day you can regard yourself as a cloud-soarer.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But that must be very difficult,&#8221; Sun Wukong observed.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where there's a will there's a way,&#8221; the Patriarch replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;Nothing by halves, master,&#8221; replied Sun Wukong with bows and kowtows, &#8220;I beg of you in your great mercy to teach me the art of cloud-soaring. I promise that I will always be grateful.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Immortals take off with a stamp of their feet,&#8221; said the Patriarch, &#8220;but you do it differently&#8212;just now I saw you pull yourself up. As that is the way you do it, I'll show you how to do it your own way and teach you the 'somersault cloud.'&#8220; Sun Wukong bowed again, imploring him to do so, and the Patriarch taught him the spell.</P>

<P>&#8220;For this kind of cloud,&#8221; the Patriarch said, &#8220;you make the magic by clasping your hands in the special way, recite the words of the spell, clench your fist, shake yourself, and jump. With one somersault you can go sixty thousand miles.&#8221; When the others heard this they all exclaimed with a laugh.</P>
<P>&#8220;Lucky old Sun Wukong. With magic like this he could be-a messenger delivering official letters and reports, and he'd never go short of a meal.&#8221; When it was dark the Patriarch and his pupils returned to the cave. That night Sun Wukong moved his spirit, practiced the technique, and mastered the cloud somersault. From then on he was free from all restraint and he enjoyed the delights of immortality, drifting around as he pleased.</p>

The other day our teacher whispered to you how to do the transformations to avoid the Three Disasters. Can you do them all yet?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's true, brothers,&#8221; said Sun Wukong with a grin, &#8220;I can do them all. In the first place, it's because our master taught me; and in the second place, it's because I practiced them hard day and night.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This would be a good time for you to give us a demonstration.&#8221; At this suggestion Sun Wukong braced his spirit to show off his skill.</P>
<P>&#8220;What's it to be, brothers? Tell me what you'd like me to turn myself into.&#8221;</P>

<P>When the students saw it they clapped their hands and chuckled aloud, saying, &#8220;Good old monkey, good old monkey.&#8221; They did not realize that the row they were making had disturbed the Patriarch, who rushed out through the door, dragging his stick behind him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Who's making a row out here?&#8221; he asked. The students hurriedly pulled themselves together, straightened their clothes and went over to him.</P>
<P>Sun Wukong, who had now resumed his real appearance, said from the forest, &#8220;Master, we were holding a discussion here, and there were no outsiders making a din.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Yelling and shouting like that,&#8221; the Patriarch angrily roared, &#8220;is no way for those cultivating their conduct to behave. If you are cultivating your conduct, the subtle vapours escape when you open your mouth, and when you wag your tongue, trouble starts. What was all the laughing and shouting about&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Just now Sun Wukong did a transformation for fun. We told him to turn himself into a pine tree, and he did. We all praised and applauded him, which was why we disturbed you with the noise, master. We beg you to forgive us.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Patriarch sent them all away except for Sun Wukong, to whom he said, &#8220;Come here. Is that a way to use your spirit? To change into a pine tree? Is this a skill you should be showing off in front of people? If you saw somebody else doing that, wouldn't you ask him to teach you? If other people see you doing it, they're bound to ask you to teach them, and if you want to keep out of trouble you'll have to do so; otherwise they may do you harm, and then your life will be in danger.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sun Wukong kowtowed and said, &#8220;Please forgive me, master.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I shan't punish you,&#8221; the Patriarch replied, &#8220;but you'll have to go.&#8221; Sun Wukong's eyes filled with tears.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master, where am I to go?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Go back to where you came from.&#8221; Sun Wukong had a sudden awakening, and he said, &#8220;I came from the Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit in the country of Aolai in the Eastern Continent of Superior Body.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you hurry back there,&#8221; the Patriarch replied, &#8220;you will be able to preserve your life. If you stay here it will be absolutely impossible to do so.&#8221; Sun Wukong accepted his punishment.</P>
<P>&#8220;Yes, master,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I've been away from home for twenty years and I do miss the old days and my children and grandchildren. But when I remember that I have not yet repaid your enormous generosity to me, I can't bring myself to go.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What sort of kindness would you be doing me if you stayed? I'll be happy enough if you keep me out of any disasters you cause.&#8221;</P>

<P>Seeing that there was nothing else for it, Sun Wukong bowed and took leave of him, saying good-bye to all the other students.</P>
<P>&#8220;Now that you're going,&#8221; the Patriarch said, &#8220;I'm sure that your life will not be a good one. Whatever disasters you cause and crimes you commit, I forbid you under any circumstances to call yourself my disciple. If you so much as hint at it I'll know at once, and I'll tear off your monkey skin, chop up your bones, and banish your soul to the Ninth Darkness. I won't let you out for ten thousand aeons.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I promise never to give away a single letter of your name,&#8221; said Sun Wukong. &#8220;I'll just say that I taught myself.&#8221;</p>

We've been desperate for you to come back. A demon has been mistreating us terribly. He's occupied our Water Curtain Cave, and we've been fighting for our lives with him. Recently he's been stealing our things and carrying off many of our youngsters. We've had to stay awake all night to guard our families. Thank goodness you've come back!

<P>As the Handsome Monkey King stood gazing in silence at this view, he heard voices. When he went down the mountainside to look he found the Cave in the Belly of the Water facing the cliff.

<P>&#8220;Wait a moment,&#8221; Sun Wukong said. &#8220;I want you to take a message for me. I am the King of the Water Curtain Cave in the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit that lies due South of here.

<P>&#8220;There's a monkey outside the cave,&#8221; the minor demons reported, &#8220;who says that he's the King of the Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. He says that you have been bullying his children and grandchildren, and that he's come specially to find you to have it out with you.&#8221; The demon king laughed.</P>
<P>&#8220;Those monkey devils are always going on about a king of theirs who renounced the world to cultivate his conduct; I suppose it must be him who's here now. Did you see how he was dressed or what weapons he was carrying?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He hasn't got any weapons. He's bareheaded, and he's wearing a red gown belted with a yellow silk sash, and a pair of black boots. He isn't dressed like a monk, or a layman, or an Immortal. He's bare-handed and empty-fisted, and he's standing outside the doors yelling.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Bring me my armour and weapons,&#8221; said the demon king when he heard this. The minor demons produced them at once, and when he had donned his armour he went out of the door with all the demons, his sword in his hand.</P>
<P>&#8220;Who is the King of the Water Curtain Cave?&#8221; he roared. Sun Wukong took a quick look at him and saw that</p>

<p>那小妖听说，疾忙跑入洞里报道：“大王，祸事了！”魔王道：“有甚祸事？”小妖道：“洞外有猴头称为花果山水帘洞洞主，他说你屡次欺他儿孙，特来寻你，见个上下哩！”魔王笑道：“我常闻得那些猴精说他有个大王，出家修行去，想是今番来了。你们见他怎生打扮，有甚器械？”小妖道：“他也没甚么器械，光着个头，穿一领红色衣，勒一条黄丝绦，足下踏一对乌靴，不僧不俗，又不像道士神仙，赤手空拳，在门外叫哩。”魔王闻说：“取我披挂兵器来！”那小妖即时取出。那魔王穿了甲胄，绰刀在手，与众妖出得门来，即高声叫道：“那个是水帘洞洞主？”悟空急睁睛观看，只见那魔王——</p>

<P>&#8220;You insolent demon,&#8221; shouted the Monkey King. &#8220;Your eyes may be big but you can't see who I am.&#8221;</P>
<P>The demon king laughed at him. &#8220;You don't even stand four feet from the ground, you're still in your twenties, and you've got no weapon in your hand. What sort of mad courage makes you challenge me to a fight?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You insolent demon,&#8221; retorted Sun Wukong, &#8220;how blind you are. You may think I'm small, but I can grow easily enough. You may think I'm unarmed, but I could pull the moon down from the sky with my two hands. Don't worry, old Sun Wukong will sock you one.&#8221; Sun Wukong gave a jump and leapt into the air, taking a swing at his face.</P>
<P>The demon king put out his hand to stop him and said, &#8220;Look how big I am, you dwarf. If you use your fists, I'll use my sword. But I'd only make myself look ridiculous if I killed you with a sword. Wait till I've put my sword down and then I'll give you a display of boxing.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Well said,&#8221; exclaimed Sun Wukong, &#8220;spoken like a man. Come on then.&#8221; The demon king dropped his guard to throw a punch, and Sun Wukong rushed in towards him, punching and kicking. When he spread out his hand it was enormous, and when he clenched his fist it was very hard. Sun Wukong hit the demon king in the ribs, kicked his backside, and smashed several of his joints. The demon king seized his steel sword that was as big as a plank, and swung it at Sun Wukong's skull. Sun Wukong dodged the blow, and the sword only split air. Seeing how ugly the demon king had turned, Sun Wukong used his magic art of getting extra bodies. He pulled out one of his hairs, popped it in his mouth, chewed it up, and blew it out into the air, shouting, &#8220;Change!&#8221; It turned into two or three hundred little monkeys, who all crowded round him.</p>

<p>猴王喝道：“这泼魔这般眼大，看不见老孙！”魔王见了，笑道：“你身不满四尺，年不过三旬，手内又无兵器，怎么大胆猖狂，要寻我见什么上下？”悟空骂道：“你这泼魔，原来没眼！你量我小，要大却也不难。你量我无兵器，我两只手彀着天边月哩！你不要怕，只吃老孙一拳！”纵一纵跳上去，劈脸就打。那魔王伸手架住道：“你这般矬矮，我这般高长，你要使拳，我要使刀，使刀就杀了你，也吃人笑，待我放下刀，与你使路拳看。”悟空道：“说得是。好汉子，走来！”那魔王丢开架子便打，这悟空钻进去相撞相迎。他两个拳捶脚踢，一冲一撞。原来长拳空大，短簇坚牢，那魔王被悟空掏短胁，撞丫裆，几下筋节，把他打重了。他闪过，拿起那板大的钢刀，望悟空劈头就砍。悟空急撤身，他砍了一个空。悟空见他凶猛，即使身外身法，拔一把毫毛，丢在口中嚼碎，望空喷去，叫一声：“变！”即变做三二百个小猴，周围攒簇。</p>

<P>Sun Wukong now had an immortal body, and there was no magic transformation of which he was not capable. Since he had followed the Way he could change each of the eighty-four thousand hairs on his body into anything he wanted. The little monkeys were too quick and nimble for sword or spear.</P>
<P>Look at them, leaping forwards and jumping backwards, rushing up and surrounding the demon king, grabbing him, seizing him, poking him in the backside, pulling at his feet, punching him, kicking him, tearing his hair out, scratching at his eyes, twisting his nose, all picking him up together and throwing him to the ground. They went on until they had beaten him to a pulp. Sun Wukong snatched his sword from him, told the little monkeys to get out of the way, and brought it down on the crown of his head, splitting it into two.</P>
<P>Then he led his forces charging into the cave, where they exterminated all the demons, big and small. He shook his hair and put it back on his body. The monkeys who did not go back on his body were the little monkeys the demon king had carried off from the Water Curtain Cave. Sun Wukong asked them how they had got there.</P>
<P>There were thirty of forty of them, and they replied with tears in their eyes, &#8220;It was after Your Majesty went off to become an Immortal. He has been fighting with us for the last two years. He brought us all here by force. All the things here&#8212;the stone bowls and plates&#8212;were stolen from our cave by that beast.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If it's our stuff, take it all out,&#8221; said Sun Wukong. He then set fire to the Cave in the Belly of the Water and burnt it to a cinder.</P>
<P>&#8220;Come back with me,&#8221; he ordered the monkeys.</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; they replied, &#8220;when we came here all we could hear was the wind howling in our ears as it blew us here, so we don't know the way. How are we ever going to get back?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's nothing at all to that spell he used,&#8221; said Sun Wukong. &#8220;I can do it too, as now I only have to know the smallest bit about something to understand it completely. Shut your eyes and don't worry.&#8221;</p>

<p>原来人得仙体，出神变化无方。不知这猴王自从了道之后，身上有八万四千毛羽，根根能变，应物随心。那些小猴，眼乖会跳，刀来砍不着，枪去不能伤。你看他前踊后跃，钻上去把个魔王围绕，抱的抱，扯的扯，钻裆的钻裆，扳脚的扳脚，踢打挦毛，抠眼睛，捻鼻子，抬鼓弄，直打做一个攒盘。这悟空才去夺得他的刀来，分开小猴，照顶门一下，砍为两段，领众杀进洞中，将那大小妖精，尽皆剿灭。却把毫毛一抖，收上身来，又见那收不上身者，却是那魔王在水帘洞擒去的小猴，悟空道：“汝等何为到此？”约有三五十个，都含泪道：“我等因大王修仙去后，这两年被他争吵，把我们都摄将来，那不是我们洞中的家火？石盆石碗都被这厮拿来也。”悟空道：“既是我们的家火，你们都搬出外去。”随即洞里放起火来，把那水脏洞烧得枯干，尽归了一体。对众道：“汝等跟我回去。”众猴道：“大王，我们来时，只听得耳边风响，虚飘飘到于此地，更不识路径，今怎得回乡？”悟空道：“这是他弄的个术法儿，有何难也！我如今一窍通，百窍通，我也会弄。你们都合了眼，休怕！”</p>

<P>Splendid Monkey King. He recited a spell, took them riding on a hurricane, then brought the cloud down to the ground.</P>
<P>&#8220;Open your eyes and look, children,&#8221; he shouted. As soon as the monkeys' feet touched the ground they recognized their home. In their delight they all ran along the familiar path to the cave, and the monkeys who had stayed in the cave all crowded in as well. They divided themselves into age-groups and bowed in homage to the Monkey King. Wine and food was laid out to celebrate, and they asked him how he had defeated the demon king and saved their children. When Sun Wukong had told them the whole story the monkeys were full of admiration.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where did you learn such arts, Your Majesty?&#8221; they asked insistently.</P>
<P>&#8220;When I left you,&#8221; Sun Wukong replied, &#8220;I followed the waves and the currents, and drifted across the Eastern Ocean to the Southern Jambu Continent. Here I taught myself to take human form and to wear these clothes and boots. I swaggered around for eight or nine years, but I never found the Way, so I sailed across the Western Ocean to the Western Continent of Cattle-gift. After long enquiries I was lucky enough to meet a venerable Immortal, who taught me the True Result, which makes me as immortal as heaven, and the great Dharma Gate to eternal youth.&#8221; The monkeys all congratulated him and exclaimed that his like could not be found in a billion years.</P>
<P>Sun Wukong laughed and said, &#8220;Children, we should congratulate ourselves on having a surname.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What is Your Majesty's surname?&#8221; the monkey masses asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;My surname is now Sun, and my Buddhist name is Wukong.&#8221;</P>
<P>The monkeys all clapped their hands with joy and said, &#8220;Your Majesty is Old Sun, and we are Second Sun, Third Sun, Thin Sun, Little Sun&#8212;a family of Suns, a nation of Suns, a den of Suns.&#8221; They all offered Old Sun their respects, with big plates and small bowls of coconut toddy, grape wine, magic flowers, and magic fruit. The whole household was happy. My word!</P>

<P>By uniting themselves with a single surname</P>
<P>They are waiting to be transferred to the Register of Immortals.</P>

<p>好猴王，念声咒语，驾阵狂风，云头落下，叫：“孩儿们，睁眼。”众猴脚髹实地，认得是家乡，个个欢喜，都奔洞门旧路。那在洞众猴，都一齐簇拥同入。分班序齿，礼拜猴王。安排酒果，接风贺喜。启问降魔救子之事，悟空备细言了一遍，众猴称扬不尽道：“大王去到那方，不意学得这般手段。”悟空又道：“我当年别汝等，随波逐流，飘过东洋大海，径至南赡部洲，学成人像。着此衣，穿此履，摆摆摇摇，云游了八九年余，更不曾有道。又渡西洋大海，到西牛贺洲地界，访问多时，幸遇一老祖，传了我与天同寿的真功果，不死长生的大法门。”众猴称贺，都道：“万劫难逢也！”悟空又笑道：“小的们，又喜我这一门皆有姓氏。”众猴道：“大王姓甚？”悟空道：“我今姓孙，法名悟空。”众猴闻说，鼓掌忻然道：“大王是老孙，我们都是二孙三孙细孙小孙，一家孙，一国孙，一窝孙矣！”都来奉承老孙，大盆小碗的椰子酒、葡萄酒、仙花仙果，真个是合家欢乐！咦！贯通一姓身归本，只待荣迁仙箓名。毕竟不知怎生结果，居此界终始如何，且听下回分解。   	</div>
