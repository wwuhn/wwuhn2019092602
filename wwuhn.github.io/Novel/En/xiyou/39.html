<P>Questioning His Mother, the Boy Sorts Right from Wrong</P>
<P>When Metal and Wood Join in the Mystery, Truth and Falsehood Are Clear</P>
</div>

<P>If you speak only of the causation arising from birth,</P>
<P>You can be present at the Buddha's assembly.</P>
<P>The Buddha of the dusty world thinks only peaceful thoughts;</P>
<P>People of all quarters watch while the spirit is subdued.</P>
<P>If you wish to know who is the true monarch,</P>
<P>You must ask the mother who bore you.</P>
<P>You have never yet seen another world;</P>
<P>At every step a new flower appears.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Soon after taking his leave of the Great Sage, the crown prince of Wuji was back in the city. As instructed, he did not make for the main palace gates or announce his arrival, but went straight to a back gate that was kept by some eunuchs. Not daring to stop him, they let him in. The splendid prince rode his horse straight to the foot of the Brocade Fragrance Pavilion, in which sat the queen attended by some dozens of consorts and concubines holding fans. The queen was in tears, leaning against a carved balustrade. Do you know why? It was because she half remembered but had half forgotten a dream she had had in the small hours of the morning. Now she was deep in thought.</P>
<P>The prince dismounted, knelt at the foot of the pavilion and called, &#8220;Mother.&#8221;</P>
<P>The queen forced herself to look cheerful and called to him, &#8220;What a pleasure to see you, my child, what a pleasure. I've been worried about you for two or three years. Despite all my requests to His Majesty your father in the hall of audience I haven't been able to see you. How ever were you able to get leave to see me today? I'm so, so happy. But why do you sound so sad, child? Your father is getting on now. One day the dragon will have to return to the jade-green sea and the phoenix to the crimson clouds. Then the throne will be yours. So why be so miserable?&#8221;</P>
<P>To this the prince replied with a kowtow, &#8220;Mother, who is it who now occupies the throne? Who is it who uses the royal 'we?'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The boy's gone mad,&#8221; exclaimed the queen. &#8220;It's your father who's king. Why do you ask?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I beg you, Mother,&#8221; said the prince, kowtowing again, &#8220;to forgive your son's crime so that I may ask once more. If you can't pardon me, I can't ask.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There can't be criminal proceedings between mother and son,&#8221; the queen said. &#8220;You're forgiven. Now, hurry up and ask.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; said the prince, &#8220;I want to ask you whether there is any difference in the affection between you and my father now compared with three years ago.&#8221;</P>
<P>The moment the queen heard this her souls went flying and she rushed down to the foot of the pavilion to hug the prince close to her. &#8220;Child,&#8221; she said as tears flowed from her eyes, &#8220;why do you come to the harem after we've been kept apart for such a long time to ask me this?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; said the prince in great anger, &#8220;tell me at once what you have to say or you will ruin everything.&#8221;</P>
<P>The queen ordered her attendants to withdraw, then said in a low and tearful voice, &#8220;If you hadn't asked me about it I would have taken the secret to the grave with me. Now that you have asked, listen while I tell you:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He used to be so passionate and tender,</P>
<P>But three years later on he's turned to frost.</P>
<P>If I whisper to him warmly on the pillow</P>
<P>He pleads old age and says the urge is lost.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>At this the crown prince broke away from his mother's embrace and remounted his horse. &#8220;What's up, child?&#8221; the queen asked, holding on to him. &#8220;Why are you off before we've even finished our conversation?&#8221;</P>
<P>The prince then knelt before her and said, &#8220;I hardly dare tell you, Mother. When I went out hunting this morning with the falcons and hounds His Majesty kindly lent me I happened to meet a holy monk who was on his way to fetch the scriptures. His senior disciple is Sun the Novice, or Brother Sun. He is very good at exorcising demons. It appears that His Majesty my father is dead in the eight-sided well with glazed tiles in the palace gardens, and that the wizard turned himself into my father's double in order to usurp the throne. In the middle of last night my father came to him in a dream. He asked the priest to come here to capture the fiend. I came to ask you that question because I couldn't quite bring myself to believe them. From what you have just told me, Mother, I'm now sure he is an evil spirit.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You shouldn't believe what strangers tell you, my son,&#8221; said the queen.</P>
<P>&#8220;I wouldn't have believed him at all,&#8221; replied the crown prince, &#8220;except that His Majesty my father left proof with him.&#8221; When the queen asked what it was, the prince produced the gold-bordered white jade scepter from his sleeve and handed it to her. The queen saw it and recognized it as the king's treasure. She could not hold back her tears.</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; she cried out, &#8220;why did you never come to me in the three years since you died? Why did you appear to the holy monk and then to the prince first?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean, Mother?&#8221; the prince asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;My child,&#8221; said the queen, &#8220;I too had a dream in the small hours of the morning. I saw your father standing soaking wet in front of me. He told me himself that he had been killed and that his ghost had called on the Tang Priest to ask him to capture the impostor on the throne and rescue him. I can remember him saying all this, but only very vaguely. I was just wondering about it when you came, asked that question, and showed me the scepter. I'll keep it, and you go and ask that holy monk to be as quick as possible. Then the evil mists can be swept away, truth can be separated from falsehood, and you can repay His Majesty your father for his kindness in raising you.&#8221;</P>
<P>The prince quickly remounted and went out through the back gate of the palace to get away from the city. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>With tears in his eyes he took leave of his mother;</P>
<P>Bowed down with grief he returned to Sanzang.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He was soon out of the city and back at the gate of the Precious Wood Monastery, where he dismounted amid the greetings of the whole army. It was now almost sunset. The crown prince ordered that the soldiers were to make no unnecessary movements. He then went back into the monastery, neatened up his clothes, and went to pay his respects to Brother Monkey just as he was swaggering out of the main hall.</P>
<P>The prince fell to his knees and said, &#8220;Master, I'm back.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey went over to him to raise him to his feet and said, &#8220;Please get up. Who did you question when you went into town?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I questioned my mother,&#8221; the crown prince replied, going on to tell him everything that had happened.</P>
<P>Monkey grinned slightly as he said, &#8220;If he's that cold he must be a transformation of something icy. Never mind. It doesn't matter. I'll wipe him out for you. The only trouble is that it's a bit late to do anything today. Go back now and wait till I come to see you tomorrow.&#8221;</P>
<P>The prince knelt down again, kowtowed and said, &#8220;Let me stay here to be at your beck and call till I go in with you tomorrow.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;that would be no good. If we two went into town together the fiend would have his suspicions. He wouldn't think that I'd just met you by chance. He'd say that you'd asked me to come, and then be angry with you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But&#8212;he's going to be angry with me anyhow if I go back to the city now,&#8221; replied the prince.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Because I'll have no way to face him when I go back without having caught a single thing after taking out so many men, horses, falcons and hounds on his orders this morning,&#8221; said the prince. &#8220;If he punishes me for incompetence I'll be thrown into jail and you'll have nobody to help you when you go into town tomorrow. And in this whole force there isn't a single friend of mine.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No problem,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;If you'd told me earlier I'd have a good bag ready for you now.&#8221;</P>
<P>Splendid Great Sage. Watch him as he shows off his powers in front of the prince, leaping up into the clouds with a single bound, making the magic with his fingers, and saying the esoteric words,<I> &#8220;Om ram</I> Pure Dharma World.&#8221;</P>
<P>He made the mountain gods and local deities of the place bow to him in mid-air and say, &#8220;Great Sage, what orders do you have for us humble deities?&#8221;</P>
<P>To this Brother Monkey replied, &#8220;I've escorted the Tang Priest this far and now I want to capture a demon. The trouble is that the crown prince has caught nothing on his hunt, so he doesn't dare return to the palace. I'd like to ask a favour of you all. Will you fetch some river-deer, antelopes, deer, hares, other birds and beasts to send him back with?&#8221; None of the mountain gods or local deities dared not to accept this order.</P>
<P>When they asked how many of each were wanted the Great Sage replied, &#8220;It doesn't matter. Just get some.&#8221;</P>
<P>The gods then mustered their invisible soldiers and made a magical animal-gathering wind blow. They caught hundreds and thousands of pheasants, deer, antelopes, river-deer, foxes, badgers, raccoon dogs, hares, tigers, leopards and wolves, which they presented to Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;I don't want them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I'd like you to hamstring them and set them out on both sides of the fifteen miles of the road back so that the hunters can take them to the capital without having to use their falcons or hounds. That will redound to your credit.&#8221; The gods did as they were told, put their magic wind away, and set the prey out beside the road.</P>
<P>Only then did Brother Monkey bring his cloud down to land and say to the prince, &#8220;You may go back now, Your Highness. Your bag is set out by the road for you to collect.&#8221; After the mid-air display of Monkey's amazing powers the prince was utterly convinced that this had happened, so he could but kowtow and take his leave. He then went out of the monastery and ordered the soldiers back to the city. There were indeed no end of wild animals by the road that the soldiers could catch with their bare hands, not needing the falcons or dogs. They all cheered the prince and said that this was due to his very good luck, not realizing that it was Monkey's magical achievement. Just listen to the triumphant songs as they swarm back to the capital.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Monkey, meanwhile, was guarding Sanzang. Seeing how well the two of them were getting on with the prince, the monks of the monastery had to treat them with great respect. They provided them with vegetarian meals and looked after the Tang Priest, who was still resting in the meditation hall. For nearly a whole watch, or about two hours, Monkey was too troubled to sleep.</P>
<P>He jumped up, went over to the Tang priest's bed and called, &#8220;Master.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang was still awake too, but he pretended to be asleep because he knew that Monkey was someone who caused alarms and trouble. So Monkey rubbed Sanzang's shaven pate and shouted wildly, &#8220;Why are you asleep, Master?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Wicked creature,&#8221; said the Tang Priest angrily, &#8220;what are you shouting for at this time of night when you ought to be asleep?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But Master,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;there's something I want to talk about with you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I can't sleep,&#8221; Brother Monkey replied, &#8220;because when I was boasting to the crown prince yesterday about how my magical powers were higher than mountains and deeper than the sea I said that I could catch that fiend as easily as taking something out of a bag. I'd only have to stretch out my hand to grab him. Thinking about it I realize it would be difficult.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If it is difficult,&#8221; said the Tang Priest, &#8220;then give up the idea of catching the monster.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He's certainly got to be caught,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;but it isn't right.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're talking nonsense, ape,&#8221; said the Tang Priest. &#8220;The fiend has usurped a throne. What do you mean by 'it isn't right?'&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;All you know about is reciting sutras, worshipping the Buddha, sitting in contemplation and seeking religious instruction,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;You've never seen the Legal Code. As the saying goes, 'You can't arrest someone for theft without the loot as evidence.' That fiend has been king for three years now without giving the game away. He sleeps with the consorts and concubines in the harem and shares the pleasures of the civil and military officials at court. I have the power to catch him all right; but it'll be hard to make the charges against him stick.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; asked the Tang Priest.</P>
<P>&#8220;Even if he normally kept his mouth as shut as an unopened gourd,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;he'll brazen it out with you and say, 'I'm the monarch of Wuji. What crime have I committed against Heaven that you should come to arrest me?' What written documentation have you got to back up your case against him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How would you cope?&#8221; asked Sanzang.</P>
<P>&#8220;My plan's already made,&#8221; said Brother Monkey with a laugh. &#8220;The only thing is that it affects Your Reverence and your favoritism.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How do I show favoritism?&#8221; the Tang Priest asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Because Pig is so stupid he's rather a pet of yours.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; the Tang Priest asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Well, if he's not your favorite, be a bit bolder today and agree to stay here with Friar Sand while Pig and I go ahead to the capital of Wuji, find the palace gardens, open up the glazed-tile well, fish out the remains of the dead king, and wrap them up in a carrying-cloth. Then when we go into town tomorrow never mind about the travel documents&#8212;as soon as I see the fiend I'll have my cudgel out to kill him. If he tries to argue, show him the remains and the clothes and say, 'This is the man you murdered.' Then bring the crown prince in to mourn his father and the queen to identify the remains of her husband. Let all the civil and military officials see their true lord, and then Pig and I will set to. That's the only way we'll be able to win a contested lawsuit afterwards.&#8221;</P>
<P>On hearing this the Tang Priest concealed his delight and said, &#8220;But Pig might not be willing to go.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There you are,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;I said you showed favoritism. How do you know he won't want to go? It's just like the way you refused to respond for a whole hour when I kept trying to wake you. My three inches of tongue could make Pig come with me even if he were a Pig-and-a-half.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;call him if you like.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey then took his leave of the master, went straight to Pig's bed, and called his name. The idiot was lying with his head hanging down, snoring heavily after his exhausting journey. Mere calling was not going to wake him. Monkey grabbed him by his ears and his bristles, pulled him up, and shouted &#8220;Pig!&#8221; again. The idiot was still fast asleep.</P>
<P>When Monkey called him again Pig said, &#8220;Go to sleep, and stop fooling around. We've got to be on our way again tomorrow.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm not fooling,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;There's a piece of business for us two to do.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What sort of business?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Didn't you hear the prince telling us?&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;I didn't even see him,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;let alone hear him say anything.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The prince told me that the fiend has a treasure that makes him a match for ten thousand men in a fight,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;When we go into town we'll have to fight him, and if he has that treasure he'll beat us. That would be terrible. I reckon that if the other side is stronger than you the best thing to do is to strike first. Wouldn't be best if the two of us went and stole his treasure?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're trying to trick me into thieving, brother,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;I'll come in on this bit of business, and I'll be very useful to you too, but first I want to get something clear with you. When we've stolen the treasure and captured the demon I won't stand for any mean, small-minded sharing out of the treasure. I want the lot.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Monkey asked. &#8220;I haven't got your gift of the gab. I can't wheedle food out of people. I'm clumsy and rough-spoken, and I can't recite sutras. When I'm really on my uppers I can always swap it for food.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;All I'm interested in is fame,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I don't care about treasures. You can have it if you like.&#8221; The idiot was so happy to be promised the treasure that he rolled himself out of bed, dressed, and set out with Monkey. It was a case of</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Clear wine makes the cheeks go red;</P>
<P>Gold turns everybody's head.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The two of them opened the door very quietly, left Sanzang and took an auspicious cloud straight to the city.</P>
<P>They were soon there, and as they brought their cloud down to land they heard the drum on the tower being beaten twice. &#8220;It's the second watch, brother,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Just right,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;just right. Everybody's fast asleep.&#8221; The two of them avoided the main gate and went round to the back gate of the palace, where clappers and bells were being sounded. &#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;it sounds as though there's an alarm at both front and back gates. How are we going to get in?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Who ever heard of burglars going in through the gates?&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;Let's go over the wall so that nobody sees us.&#8221; Monkey accepted his suggestion, and with a bound he was on top of the inner wall. Pig jumped up too, then the pair of them crept inside and tried to find their way to the palace gardens.</P>
<P>As they walked along they saw a gate-tower in front of them with triple eaves and white ornaments. On it were two huge words, gleaming bright: ROYAL GARDENS. Going up to it for a closer look Brother Monkey saw that layer after layer of sealing paper had been pasted over the gates, and the locks on them had rusted hard. He then told Pig to get moving. The idiot raised his iron rake and brought it down with all his might on the gates, smashing them to splinters. Monkey was just going to step inside when he was seized with an irresistible urge to leap about and shout, to the horror of Pig who went up to him, grabbed him and said, &#8220;You'll be the death of me, brother. Who ever heard of burglars yelling like that? You'll wake them up and get us arrested and handed over to for trial. Then it'll be either a death sentence or being sent home as convicts.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;do you know why I'm so upset? Just look!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Carved and painted balustrades all in a mess,</P>
<P>Precious pavilions leaning awry.</P>
<P>The sedge and nutweed on the bank are buried.</P>
<P>The peonies and raspberries have been ruined.</P>
<P>Gone is the fragrance of rose and jasmine;</P>
<P>Tree peony and wild lily flower in vain.</P>
<P>Hibiscus and rose of Sharon are overgrown,</P>
<P>And all the precious flowers choked.</P>
<P>The hillocks built from strange-shaped rocks have collapsed;</P>
<P>The fish are dead in the dried-up ponds.</P>
<P>Dry as tinder the pine and bamboo;</P>
<P>Mugwort and wormwood carpet the paths.</P>
<P>Broken the branches of peach and osmanthus,</P>
<P>Twisted the trunks of pomegranate and kerria.</P>
<P>Moss grows on the zigzag way to the bridge:</P>
<P>A desolate garden scene.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;What are you getting so upset about?&#8221; Pig asked. &#8220;Let's get on with our bit of business.&#8221; Despite his distress Monkey remembered how in his dream the Tang Priest had been told that the well was under a plantain. As he went further he did indeed see a plantain that was most luxuriant, unlike all the other flowers and trees. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>It was a divine shoot</P>
<P>Born with an empty nature.</P>
<P>Papery strips came from every branch,</P>
<P>And all the leaves wrapped up fragrance.</P>
<P>A thousand fine stands of emerald green,</P>
<P>A touch of red at the heart.</P>
<P>It grieved in the cold of autumn rain;</P>
<P>It withered with fear of the autumn winds.</P>
<P>It was grown through the efforts of the gardener,</P>
<P>Raised through the Creator's work.</P>
<P>Wonderful its value as writing paper,</P>
<P>Marvellous its use for dripping water.</P>
<P>Would that phoenix feathers could have compared;</P>
<P>A phoenix tail was no match for its leaves.</P>
<P>When the ample dew dripped gently</P>
<P>The tree was lightly wreathed in mist.</P>
<P>Its green shade covered the window,</P>
<P>Its jade shadow fell on the frame.</P>
<P>The wild goose could not perch in its fronds,</P>
<P>Nor the charger be tethered to its trunk.</P>
<P>On a frosty day it looked withered;</P>
<P>It was dim in the moonlight.</P>
<P>It could only refresh one in summer's heat</P>
<P>And offer some shelter from the blazing sun.</P>
<P>It lacked the beauty of peach or plum,</P>
<P>Standing lonely to the East of the whitewashed wall.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Set to, Pig,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;The treasure's buried under the plantain.&#8221; The idiot raised his rake in both hands and sent the tree crashing down. Then he rooted in with his snout to a depth of three or four feet, revealing a stone cover.</P>
<P>&#8220;We're in luck, brother,&#8221; exclaimed the idiot with delight. &#8220;There really is a treasure here under this stone cover. I wonder whether it's inside a jar or a box.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Lift the cover and we'll see,&#8221; said Monkey. With another root of his snout the idiot prized it open. There was a glow of multicolored light, and a bright, white vapor.</P>
<P>&#8220;We're in luck, we're in luck,&#8221; chortled Pig. &#8220;The treasure's shining.&#8221;</P>
<P>Going nearer for a closer look they saw that it was in fact the starlight and the moonlight reflected by the water in a well.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;you ought to think ahead.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean, think ahead?&#8221; asked Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is a well,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;If you'd told me back in the monastery that the treasure was hidden in a well I'd have brought a couple of the luggage ropes along with me and we could have worked out a way of letting me down the well. But how am I going to go down there to fetch the thing empty-handed?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Are you willing to go down?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;I would if I could,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;but there's no rope.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Take that garment off&#8212;I know what to do,&#8221; said Monkey with a grin.</P>
<P>&#8220;I've got nothing good enough to be called a garment,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;The only thing I could take off is this tunic.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage brought out his gold-tipped cudgel, pulled it at both ends, and said, &#8220;Grow!&#8221; It grew seventy or eighty feet long. &#8220;You hold one end, Pig, and I'll lower you in,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Let me down till I reach the water, brother, and then stop,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;Understood,&#8221; said Monkey. As the idiot clung to the tip of the cudgel Monkey lightly lifted him up and lowered him into the well. Before long Pig had reached the water. As soon as Monkey heard him call out that he was there, Monkey thrust the cudgel down, making the idiot let go of it and tumble in with a splash.</P>
<P>&#8220;Heavens, I'm being murdered,&#8221; Pig mumbled in the water. &#8220;I told you not to let me go when I got to the water, but you pushed me in.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey pulled his cudgel out and asked with a laugh, &#8220;Can you find the treasure, brother?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What treasure?&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;There's only a wellful of water.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The treasure's at the bottom,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;so go down and have a feel around.&#8221; The idiot, who really was a good swimmer, did a surface dive and plunged down. Wow! The well was extremely deep, so he thrust himself even further down, and was suddenly gazing in astonishment at an ornamental arch on which were written the word WATER CRYSTAL PALACE.</P>
<P>&#8220;That's enough of this,&#8221; said Pig with horror. &#8220;I've taken the wrong turning. I must have blundered into the sea. There are water crystal palaces in the sea, but there couldn't possibly be one in a well.&#8221; What Pig did not realize was that this was the water crystal palace of the Dragon King of the Well.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As Pig was talking to himself a patrolling yaksha opened the gates and shot straight back inside again at the sight of him to report, &#8220;A disaster, Your Majesty. A monk with big ears and a long snout has just fallen into the well. He's dripping wet and stark naked. He's still alive and is talking for all he's worth.&#8221;</P>
<P>The news was a great shock to the Dragon King of the Well, who thought, &#8220;This must be Marshal Tian Peng. Yesterday evening the Patroller of the Night came with an edict ordering me to send the soul of the king of Wuji to visit the Tang Priest and ask that the Great Sage Equaling Heaven be sent to capture the fiend. I suppose that the Great Sage and the Marshal must be here now. I must be very polite to them and go straight out to welcome them.&#8221;</P>
<P>The dragon king neatened up his clothes and went out through the gates at the head of his watery tribe. &#8220;Please come in and take a seat, Marshal Tian Peng,&#8221; he called at the top of his voice.</P>
<P>This made Pig feel a great deal happier. &#8220;So it's an old friend,&#8221; he thought. Without any further thought the idiot went straight into the water crystal palace. He really had no sense of proper behavior, and sat, stark naked as he was, in the place of honour.</P>
<P>&#8220;Marshal,&#8221; said the dragon king, &#8220;I hear that you have been given a new life, been converted to the Buddhist faith, and are escorting the Tang Priest on his journey West to fetch the scriptures. What bring you here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's just as you say. My senior fellow-disciple Monkey sends his respects and has told me to come here to ask you for some kind of treasure.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Oh dear,&#8221; said the dragon king, &#8220;we don't have any treasure here. I'm no match for the dragon kings of the Yangtse, Yellow, Huai or Ji rivers, who can fly around, do transformations, and get treasure that way. I've been stuck here for ages, and not been able to broaden my horizons for many a long month, so how could I possibly get any treasures?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop trying to fob me off,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;Bring out whatever you've got.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It's true I do have one treasure,&#8221; admitted the dragon king, &#8220;but I can't move it. Perhaps you would like to come and see it for yourself, Marshal.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Splendid, splendid, splendid,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;I really must have a look.&#8221;</P>
<P>The idiot followed as the dragon king led the way. As they left the halls of the water crystal palace they saw a body six feet long lying in an open corridor. &#8220;There's the treasure,&#8221; said the dragon king, pointing to it. When Pig took a closer look he saw to his astonishment that it was the body of a king stretched ramrod-straight and wearing a heaven-touching crown, a robe of yellow ochre, no-worry shoes and a belt of Lantain jade.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is no good at all,&#8221; chuckled Pig, &#8220;no good at all. Can't call that a treasure. I remember that when I was an ogre in the mountains I often used to make a meal out of things like that. Never mind how many of them I've seen&#8212;I've eaten a lot. There's no way you could call that a treasure.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There are some things you don't know, Marshal,&#8221; said the dragon king. &#8220;It's the body of the king of Wuji. When he fell into the well I put a face-preserving pearl on him and he has not decomposed. If you were to carry the body up to see the Great Sage Equaling Heaven, and if it could be brought back to life, then you'd get anything you asked for, never mind just treasures.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If what you say is right and I carry him up for you, tell me how much you'll pay me for arranging his funeral,&#8221; Pig said.</P>
<P>&#8220;Honestly, I don't have any money,&#8221; the dragon king replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;So you like making people work for nothing, do you?&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;No money, no carriage.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you won't, then please be on your way,&#8221; replied the dragon king. Pig left with two hefty yakshas who carried the body outside the palace gates, where they put it down and removed the water-repelling pearl.</P>
<P>At once there was a watery noise. Pig turned straight back to look, but the water crystal palace had disappeared. After feeling the king's corpse he floundered around until he was weak from exhaustion, then surfaced and took hold of the wall of the well. &#8220;Brother,&#8221; he yelled, &#8220;lower the cudgel and rescue me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Got a treasure?&#8221; asked Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;No way,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;All I found under the water was the Dragon King of the Well who wanted me to carry a corpse up. When I refused he saw me out and the water crystal palace disappeared. I could only grasp that corpse. I was in such a panic that I went weak all over and I can't move it. Brother, for goodness' sake rescue me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;But that is the treasure,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Why didn't you bring it up?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I knew he'd been dead for ages,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;so what would have been the point?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you won't bring it up I'm going back,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where to?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Back to the monastery and our master to go to bed,&#8221; replied Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;Can't I come?&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;You're welcome if you can climb out, but if you can't, tough luck,&#8221; said Monkey. This threw Pig into a panic as he could not climb out.</P>
<P>&#8220;Just think,&#8221; he called, &#8220;a city wall is hard enough to climb. This well narrows towards the top. It's got round, overhanging walls, all overgrown with very slippery moss because nobody's drawn water from it for years. How d'you expect me to climb it? Brother, don't forget we're good friends. I'm going down to get it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Bring it up quick and we'll go back to bed.&#8221; The idiot then did another surface dive and plunged straight down. He groped around till he found the body, dragged it over and carried it up till he surfaced again.</P>
<P>&#8220;I've brought it up, brother,&#8221; Pig called as he supported himself at the side of the well. When Monkey took a good look and saw that Pig really had brought the body up he lowered the gold-banded cudgel back into the well. Pig was so angry that he opened his mouth and bit on the cudgel while Monkey gently lifted him out.</P>
<P>Pig put the corpse down, retrieved his own clothes, and put them back on. Monkey examined the king's face and saw that it was exactly as it had been in life. &#8220;Brother,&#8221; he said, &#8220;he's been dead three years. Why is his face so well preserved?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You wouldn't know about that,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;The Dragon King of the Well told me that he'd used a face-preserving pearl to stop the body from decomposing.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What luck,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;what luck. He hasn't had his revenge yet, and we're going to succeed. Put him over your shoulder, brother.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where shall I take him?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Take him to see the master,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;What a way to treat me,&#8221; grumbled Pig, &#8220;what a way. I was fast asleep when that baboon used his slippery tongue to fool me with that talk of a bit of business. Now I've done it for him I've got to carry this dead body. All this dirty water is dripping down on me and making my tunic filthy. There's nobody to wash it for me. The patches on the shoulders will get damp on overcast days. I won't possibly be able to wear it.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You carry him to the monastery,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;and I'll give you something else to wear instead.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're shameless,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;You have well-nigh nothing to wear yourself and you talk of giving me something else.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you're going to moan like this then don't carry it,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;I won't then,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;Then put your ankles out for twenty strokes of the cudgel,&#8221; said Monkey.</P>
<P>&#8220;But, brother, your cudgel hits very hard,&#8221; protested Pig in panic. &#8220;Twenty strokes and I'll be like this king.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If you don't want a beating then get on with carrying him,&#8221; said Monkey. As he really was afraid of a beating Pig dragged the body over, put it across his shoulder and walked out of the palace gardens with an ill grace.</P>
<P>The splendid Great Sage made magic with his hands, said a spell, and blew towards the direction of the wind trigram. At once a tremendous gust of wind plucked Pig out of the palace grounds and over the city wall and moat. The wind then fell, dropping the pair of them on the ground to continue on their way more slowly. The idiot, who was still feeling very hard done by and wanted to get his own back on Monkey, said to himself, &#8220;That ape put one over on me, and when we get back to the monastery I'm going to get my own back on him. I'll tell the master that Monkey can bring the body back to life. When he fails the master will say the Band-tightening Spell and all the brains will be squeezed out of that ape's head. That's the only way I'll be satisfied. No, that's no good,&#8221; he went on to think as he walked along. &#8220;If I ask him to revive the body that'll be too easy for him. He'll only have to call on the King of Hell and ask for the king's soul back. The best way will be to ban him from going to the Underworld. He'll have to bring the king back to life in the world of the living.&#8221;</P>
<P>While he was still thinking these thoughts he arrived back at the monastery gates. He went straight in, flung the corpse to the ground right in front of the doors to the meditation hall, and shouted, &#8220;Master, come and see a freak.&#8221; The Tang Priest, unable to sleep, was talking to Friar Sand about how Monkey had tricked Pig into going and how long they'd been gone when he heard Pig's shout. The Tang Priest got straight out of bed and said, &#8220;See what?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother Monkey's grandpa, and I've had to carry him back,&#8221; said Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;You dreg-guzzling idiot,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;I've got no grandpa.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Well, brother,&#8221; replied Pig, &#8220;if he isn't your grandpa, why did you make me carry him? It was damned hard work.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Sanzang and Friar Sand opened the doors to look they saw that the king's face was quite unchanged from what it had been in life. &#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; said the Tang Priest sorrowfully, &#8220;who knows in what earlier life you earned the wizard's hatred? That must be why when you met in this one he murdered you and snatched you from your wives and children unbeknown to any of the civilian or military officials. What a pity it was that in their ignorance your wives and children should never have burnt incense and offered tea to your spirit.&#8221; He broke into sobs and his tears poured down like rain.</P>
<P>&#8220;What's his death to you?&#8221; asked Pig, laughing at Sanzang. &#8220;He's not your father or grandfather, so why weep for him?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciple,&#8221; sighed Sanzang, &#8220;compassion is the fundamental quality of a monk, and helping others is a monk's way. How can you be so hard-hearted?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I'm not hard-hearted,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;Monkey told me that he could bring this body back to life. Otherwise I wouldn't have carried it here.&#8221; The venerable elder, as easily swayed as ever, was taken in by the idiot.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wukong,&#8221; he called, &#8220;if you have the power to bring this king back to life, it would be a case of saving a single human life being better than building a seven-storied pagoda. For us it would be even better than worshipping the Buddha on Thunder Peak.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Don't believe that idiot's nonsense, Master,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;By the time people have been dead for three weeks, then five weeks, and finally for seven hundred days, they've paid for all their sins in this life and go off to be reborn. He's been dead for three years now. He's beyond saving.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this the Tang Priest said, &#8220;Oh well, forget it.&#8221; Pig was still burning with a sense of injustice. &#8220;Master,&#8221; he said, &#8220;don't be taken in by him. He's talking rubbish. You just recite your spell and I guarantee he'll bring the king back to life for you.&#8221; The Tang Priest did indeed say the Band-tightening Spell, which squeezed Monkey so badly that his eyes bulged and his head ached.</P>
<P>If you don't know how the king was revived, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>婴儿问母知邪正</p>
<p>金木参玄见假真</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<p>逢君只说受生因，便作如来会上人。一念静观尘世佛，十方同看降威神。欲知今日真明主，须问当年嫡母身。别有世间曾未见，一行一步一花新。却说那乌鸡国王太子，自别大圣，不多时回至城中，果然不奔朝门，不敢报传宣诏，径至后宰门首，见几个太监在那里把守。见太子来，不敢阻滞，让他进去了。好太子，夹一夹马，撞入里面，忽至锦香亭下，只见那正宫娘娘坐在锦香亭上，两边有数十个嫔妃掌扇，那娘娘倚雕栏儿流泪哩。你道他流泪怎的？原来他四更时也做了一梦，记得一半，含糊了一半，沉沉思想。这太子下马，跪于亭下，叫：“母亲！”那娘娘强整欢容，叫声“孩儿，喜呀！喜呀！这二三年在前殿与你父王开讲，不得相见，我甚思量，今日如何得暇来看我一面？诚万千之喜！诚万千之喜！孩儿，你怎么声音悲惨？你父王年纪高迈，有一日龙归碧海，凤返丹霄，你就传了帝位，还有甚么不悦？”太子叩头道：“母亲，我问你：即位登龙是那个？称孤道寡果何人？”娘娘闻言道：“这孩儿发风了！做皇帝的是你父王，你问怎的？”太子叩头道：“万望母亲敕子无罪，敢问；不敕，不敢问。”娘娘道：“子母家有何罪？敕你，敕你，快快说来。”太子道：“母亲，我问你三年前夫妻宫里之事与后三年恩爱同否，如何？”娘娘见说，魂飘魄散，急下亭抱起，紧搂在怀，眼中滴泪道：“孩儿！我与你久不相见，怎么今日来宫问此？”太子发怒道：“母亲有话早说，不说时，且误了大事。”娘娘才喝退左右，泪眼低声道：“这桩事，孩儿不问，我到九泉之下，也不得明白。</p>

<p>既问时，听我说：三载之前温又暖，三年之后冷如冰。枕边切切将言问，他说老迈身衰事不兴！”太子闻言，撒手脱身，攀鞍上马。那娘娘一把扯住道：“孩儿，你有甚事，话不终就走？”太子跪在面前道：“母亲，不敢说！今日早期，蒙钦差架鹰逐犬，出城打猎，偶遇东土驾下来的个取经圣僧，有大徒弟乃孙行者，极善降妖。原来我父王死在御花园八角琉璃井内，这全真假变父王，侵了龙位。今夜三更，父王托梦，请他到城捉怪。孩儿不敢尽信，特来问母，母亲才说出这等言语，必然是个妖精。”那娘娘道：“儿啊，外人之言，你怎么就信为实？”太子道：“儿还不敢认实，父王遗下表记与他了。”娘娘问是何物，太子袖中取出那金厢白玉圭，递与娘娘。那娘娘认得是当时国王之宝，止不住泪如泉涌，叫声：“主公！你怎么死去三年，不来见我，却先见圣僧，后来见我？”太子道：“母亲，这话是怎的说？”娘娘道：“儿啊，我四更时分，也做了一梦，梦见你父王水淋淋的，站在我跟前，亲说他死了，鬼魂儿拜请了唐僧降假皇帝，救他前身。记便记得是这等言语，只是一半儿不得分明，正在这里狐疑，怎知今日你又来说这话，又将宝贝拿出。我且收下，你且去请那圣僧急急为之。果然扫荡妖氛，辨明邪正，庶报你父王养育之恩也。”</p>

<p>太子急忙上马，出后宰门，躲离城池，真个是噙泪叩头辞国母，含悲顿首复唐僧。不多时，出了城门，径至宝林寺山门前下马。众军士接着太子，又见红轮将坠。太子传令，不许军士乱动，他又独自个入了山门，整束衣冠，拜请行者。只见那猴王从正殿摇摇摆摆走来，那太子双膝跪下道：“师父，我来了。”行者上前搀住道：“请起，你到城中，可曾问谁么？”太子道：“问母亲来。”将前言尽说了一遍。行者微微笑道：“若是那般冷啊，想是个甚么冰冷的东西变的。不打紧！不打紧！等我老孙与你扫荡。却只是今日晚了，不好行事。你先回去，待明早我来。”</p>

<p>太子跪地叩拜道：“师父，我只在此伺候，到明日同师父一路去罢。”行者道：“不好！不好！若是与你一同入城，那怪物生疑，不说是我撞着你，却说是你请老孙，却不惹他反怪你也？”太子道：“我如今进城，他也怪我。”行者道：“怪你怎么？”太子道：“我自早朝蒙差，带领若干人马鹰犬出城，今一日更无一件野物，怎么见驾？若问我个不才之罪，监陷羑里，你明日进城，却将何倚？况那班部中更没个相知人也。”行者道：“这甚打紧！你肯早说时，却不寻下些等你？”</p>

<p>好大圣！你看他就在太子面前，显个手段，将身一纵，跳在云端里，捻着诀，念一声“唵蓝净法界”的真言，拘得那山神土地在半空中施礼道：“大圣，呼唤小神，有何使令？”行者道：“老孙保护唐僧到此，欲拿邪魔，奈何那太子打猎无物，不敢回朝。</p>

<p>问汝等讨个人情，快将獐鹿兔，走兽飞禽，各寻些来，打发他回去。”山神土地闻言，敢不承命？又问各要几何。大圣道：“不拘多少，取些来便罢。”那各神即着本处阴兵，刮一阵聚兽阴风，捉了些野鸡山雉，角鹿肥獐，狐獾狢兔，虎豹狼虫，共有百千余只，献与行者。行者道：“老孙不要，你可把他都捻就了筋，单摆在那四十里路上两旁，教那些人不纵鹰犬，拿回城去，算了汝等之功。”众神依言，散了阴风，摆在左右。行者才按云头，对太子道：“殿下请回，路上已有物了，你自收去。”太子见他在半空中弄此神通，如何不信，只得叩头拜别，出山门传了令，教军士们回城。只见那路旁果有无限的野物，军士们不放鹰犬，一个个俱着手擒捉喝采，俱道是千岁殿下的洪福，怎知是老孙的神功？你听凯歌声唱，一拥回城。</p>

<p>这行者保护了三藏，那本寺中的和尚，见他们与太子这样绸缪，怎不恭敬？却又安排斋供，管待了唐僧，依然还歇在禅堂里。将近有一更时分，行者心中有事，急睡不着。他一毂辘爬起来，到唐僧床前叫：“师父。”此时长老还未睡哩，他晓得行者会失惊打怪的，推睡不应。行者摸着他的光头，乱摇道：“师父怎睡着了？”唐僧怒道：“这个顽皮！这早晚还不睡，吆喝甚么？”</p>

<p>行者道：“师父，有一桩事儿和你计较计较。”长老道：“甚么事？”行者道：“我日间与那太子夸口，说我的手段比山还高，比海还深，拿那妖精如探囊取物一般，伸了手去就拿将转来，却也睡不着，想起来，有些难哩。”唐僧道：“你说难，便就不拿了罢。”行者道：“拿是还要拿，只是理上不顺。”唐僧道：“这猴头乱说！妖精夺了人君位，怎么叫做理上不顺！”行者道：“你老人家只知念经拜佛，打坐参禅，那曾见那萧何的律法？常言道，拿贼拿赃。那怪物做了三年皇帝，又不曾走了马脚，漏了风声。他与三宫妃后同眠，又和两班文武共乐，我老孙就有本事拿住他，也不好定个罪名。”唐僧道：“怎么不好定罪？”行者道：“他就是个没嘴的葫芦，也与你滚上几滚。他敢道：我是乌鸡国王，有甚逆天之事，你来拿我？将甚执照与他折辩？”唐僧道：“凭你怎生裁处？”行者笑道：“老孙的计已成了，只是干碍着你老人家，有些儿护短。”唐僧道：“我怎么护短？”行者道：“八戒生得夯，你有些儿偏向他。”唐僧道：“我怎么向他？”行者道：“你若不向他啊，且如今把胆放大些，与沙僧只在这里。待老孙与八戒趁此时先入那乌鸡国城中，寻着御花园，打开琉璃井，把那皇帝尸首捞将上来，包在我们包袱里。明日进城，且不管甚么倒换文牒，见了那怪，掣棍子就打。他但有言语，就将骨榇与他看，说你杀的是这个人！却教太子上来哭父，皇后出来认夫，文武多官见主，我老孙与兄弟们动手。这才是有对头的官事好打。”唐僧闻言暗喜道：“只怕八戒不肯去。”行者笑道：“如何？</p>

<p>我说你护短，你怎么就知他不肯去？你只象我叫你时不答应，半个时辰便了！我这去，但凭三寸不烂之舌，莫说是猪八戒，就是猪九戒，也有本事教他跟着我走。”唐僧道：“也罢，随你去叫他。”</p>

<p>行者离了师父，径到八戒床边，叫：“八戒！八戒！”那呆子是走路辛苦的人，丢倒头只情打呼，那里叫得醒？行者揪着耳朵，抓着鬃，把他一拉，拉起来，叫声“八戒。”那呆子还打棱挣，行者又叫一声，呆子道：“睡了罢，莫顽！明日要走路哩！”行者道：“不是顽，有一桩买卖，我和你做去。”八戒道：“甚么买卖？”</p>

<p>行者道：“你可曾听得那太子说么？”八戒道：“我不曾见面，不曾听见说甚么。”行者说：“那太子告诵我说，那妖精有件宝贝，万夫不当之勇。我们明日进朝，不免与他争敌，倘那怪执了宝贝，降倒我们，却不反成不美，我想着打人不过，不如先下手。</p>

<p>我和你去偷他的来，却不是好？”八戒道：“哥哥，你哄我去做贼哩。这个买卖，我也去得，果是晓得实实的帮寸，我也与你讲个明白：偷了宝贝，降了妖精，我却不奈烦甚么小家罕气的分宝贝，我就要了。”行者道：“你要作甚？”八戒道：“我不如你们乖巧能言，人面前化得出斋来，老猪身子又夯，言语又粗，不能念经，若到那无济无生处，可好换斋吃么！”行者道：“老孙只要图名，那里图甚宝贝，就与你罢便了。”那呆子听见说都与他，他就满心欢喜，一毂辘爬将起来，套上衣服，就和行者走路。这正是清酒红人面，黄金动道心。两个密密的开了门，躲离三藏，纵祥光，径奔那城。</p>

<p>不多时到了，按落云头，只听得楼头方二鼓矣。行者道：“兄弟，二更时分了。”八戒道：“正好！正好！人都在头觉里正浓睡也。”二人不奔正阳门，径到后宰门首，只听得梆铃声响。</p>

<p>行者道：“兄弟，前后门皆紧急，如何得入？”八戒道：“那见做贼的从门里走么？瞒墙跳过便罢。”行者依言，将身一纵，跳上里罗城墙，八戒也跳上去。二人潜入里面，找着门路，径寻那御花园。正行时，只见有一座三檐白簇的门楼，上有三个亮灼灼的大字，映着那星月光辉，乃是御花园。行者近前看了，有几重封皮，公然将锁门锈住了，即命八戒动手。那呆子掣铁钯，尽力一筑，把门筑得粉碎。行者先举步插入，忍不住跳将起来，大呼小叫，唬得八戒上前扯住道：“哥呀，害杀我也！那见做贼的乱嚷，似这般吆喝！惊醒了人，把我们拿住，发到官司，就不该死罪，也要解回原籍充军。”行者道：“兄弟啊，你却不知我发急为何，你看这：“彩画雕栏狼狈，宝妆亭阁敧歪。莎汀蓼岸尽尘埋，芍药荼蘼俱败。茉莉玫瑰香暗，牡丹百合空开。芙蓉木槿草垓垓，异卉奇葩壅坏。巧石山峰俱倒，池塘水涸鱼衰。青松紫竹似干柴，满路茸茸蒿艾。丹桂碧桃枝损，海榴棠棣根歪。桥头曲径有苍苔，冷落花园境界！”八戒道：“且叹他做甚？快干我们的买卖去来！”行者虽然感慨，却留心想起唐僧的梦来，说芭蕉树下方是井。正行处，果见一株芭蕉，生得茂盛，比众花木不同，真是：一种灵苗秀，天生体性空。枝枝抽片纸，叶叶卷芳丛。翠缕千条细，丹心一点红。凄凉愁夜雨，憔悴怯秋风。长养元丁力，栽培造化工。缄书成妙用，挥洒有奇功。凤翎宁得似，鸾尾迥相同。薄露瀼瀼滴，轻烟淡淡笼。青阴遮户牖，碧影上帘栊。不许栖鸿雁，何堪系玉骢。霜天形槁悴，月夜色朦胧。仅可消炎暑，犹宜避日烘。愧无桃李色，冷落粉墙东。行者道：“八戒，动手么！宝贝在芭蕉树下埋着哩。”那呆子双手举钯，筑倒了芭蕉，然后用嘴一拱，拱了有三四尺深，见一块石板盖住。呆子欢喜道：“哥呀！造化了！果有宝贝，是一片石板盖着哩！不知是坛儿盛着，是柜儿装着哩。”行者道：“你掀起来看看。”那呆子果又一嘴，拱开看处，又见有霞光灼灼，白气明明。八戒笑道：“造化！造化！宝贝放光哩！”又近前细看时，呀！原来是星月之光，映得那井中水亮。八戒道：“哥呀，你但干事，便要留根。”</p>

<p>行者道：“我怎留根？”八戒道：“这是一眼井。你在寺里，早说是井中有宝贝，我却带将两条捆包袱的绳来，怎么作个法儿，把老猪放下去。如今空手，这里面东西，怎么得下去上来耶？”行者道：“你下去么？”八戒道：“正是要下去，只是没绳索。”行者笑道：“你脱了衣服，我与你个手段。”八戒道：“有甚么好衣服？</p>

<p>解了这直裰子就是了。”</p>

<p>好大圣，把金箍棒拿出来，两头一扯，叫“长！”足有七八丈长。教：“八戒，你抱着一头儿，把你放下井去。”八戒道：“哥呀，放便放下去，若到水边，就住了罢。”行者道：“我晓得。”那呆子抱着铁棒，被行者轻轻提将起来，将他放下去。不多时，放至水边，八戒道：“到水了！”行者听见他说，却将棒往下一按。那呆子扑通的一个没头蹲，丢了铁棒，便就负水，口里哺哺的嚷道：“这天杀的！我说到水莫放，他却就把我一按！”行者擎上棒来，笑道：“兄弟，可有宝贝么？”八戒道：“见甚么宝贝，只是一井水！”行者道：“宝贝沉在水底下哩，你下去摸一摸来。”呆子真个深知水性，却就打个猛子，淬将下去，呀！那井底深得紧！他却着实又一淬，忽睁眼见有一座牌楼，上有水晶宫三个字。八戒大惊道：“罢了！罢了！错走了路了！蹡下海来也！海内有个水晶宫，井里如何有之？”原来八戒不知此是井龙王的水晶宫。</p>

<p>八戒正叙话处，早有一个巡水的夜叉，开了门，看见他的模样，急抽身进去报道：“大王，祸事了！井上落一个长嘴大耳的和尚来了！赤淋淋的，衣服全无，还不死，逼法说话哩。”那井龙王忽闻此言，心中大惊道：“这是天蓬元帅来也。昨夜夜游神奉上敕旨，来取乌鸡国王魂灵去拜见唐僧，请齐天大圣降妖。</p>

<p>这怕是齐天大圣、天蓬元帅来了，却不可怠慢他，快接他去也。”那龙王整衣冠，领众水族，出门来厉声高叫道：“天蓬元帅，请里面坐。”八戒却才欢喜道：“原来是个故知。”那呆子不管好歹，径入水晶宫里。其实不知上下，赤淋淋的，就坐在上面。龙王道：“元帅，近闻你得了性命，皈依释教，保唐僧西天取经，如何得到此处？”八戒道：“正为此说，我师兄孙悟空多多拜上，着我来问你取甚么宝贝哩。”龙王道：“可怜，我这里怎么得个宝贝？比不得那江河淮济的龙王，飞腾变化，便有宝贝。我久困于此，日月且不能长见，宝贝果何自而来也？”八戒道：“不要推辞，有便拿出来罢。”龙王道：“有便有一件宝贝，只是拿不出来，就元帅亲自来看看，何如？”八戒道：“妙妙妙！须是看看来也。”那龙王前走，这呆子随后，转过了水晶宫殿，只见廊庑下，横軃着一个六尺长躯。龙王用手指定道：“元帅，那厢就是宝贝了。”八戒上前看了，呀！原来是个死皇帝，戴着冲天冠，穿着赭黄袍，踏着无忧履，系着蓝田带，直挺挺睡在那厢。八戒笑道：“难难难！算不得宝贝！想老猪在山为怪时，时常将此物当饭，且莫说见的多少，吃也吃够无数，那里叫做甚么宝贝！”龙王道：“元帅原来不知，他本是乌鸡国王的尸首，自到井中，我与他定颜珠定住，不曾得坏。你若肯驮他出去，见了齐天大圣，假有起死回生之意啊，莫说宝贝，凭你要甚么东西都有。”八戒道：“既这等说，我与你驮出去，只说把多少烧埋钱与我？”龙王道“其实无钱。”八戒道：“你好白使人？果然没钱，不驮！”龙王道：“不驮，请行。”八戒就走。龙王差两个有力量的夜叉，把尸抬将出去，送到水晶宫门外，丢在那厢，摘了辟水珠，就有水响。</p>

<p>八戒急回头看，不见水晶宫门，一把摸着那皇帝的尸首，慌得他脚软筋麻，撺出水面，扳着井墙，叫道：“师兄！伸下棒来救我一救！”行者道：“可有宝贝么？”八戒道：“那里有！只是水底下有一个井龙王，教我驮死人，我不曾驮，他就把我送出门来，就不见那水晶宫了，只摸着那个尸首，唬得我手软筋麻，挣搓不动了！哥呀！好歹救我救儿！”行者道：“那个就是宝贝，如何不驮上来？”八戒道：“知他死了多少时了，我驮他怎的？”行者道：“你不驮，我回去耶。”八戒道：“你回那里去？”行者道：“我回寺中，同师父睡觉去。”八戒道：“我就不去了？”行者道：“你爬得上来，便带你去，爬不上来，便罢。”八戒慌了：“怎生爬得动！你想，城墙也难上，这井肚子大，口儿小，壁陡的圈墙，又是几年不曾打水的井，团团都长的是苔痕，好不滑也，教我怎爬？哥哥，不要失了兄弟们和气，等我驮上来罢。”行者道：“正是，快快驮上来，我同你回去睡觉。”那呆子又一个猛子，淬将下去，摸着尸首，拽过来，背在身上，撺出水面，扶井墙道：“哥哥，驮上来了。”那行者睁睛看处，真个的背在身上，却才把金箍棒伸下井底，那呆子着了恼的人，张开口，咬着铁棒，被行者轻轻的提将出来。八戒将尸放下，捞过衣服穿了。行者看时，那皇帝容颜依旧，似生时未改分毫。行者道：“兄弟啊，这人死了三年，怎么还容颜不坏？”八戒道：“你不知之，这井龙王对我说，他使了定颜珠定住了，尸首未曾坏得。”行者道：“造化！造化！一则是他的冤仇未报，二来该我们成功，兄弟快把他驮了去。”八戒道：“驮往那里去？”行者道：“驮了去见师父。”八戒口中作念道：“怎的起！怎的起！好好睡觉的人，被这猢狲花言巧语，哄我教做甚么买卖，如今却干这等事，教我驮死人！驮着他，腌脏臭水淋将下来，污了衣服，没人与我浆洗。上面有几个补丁，天阴发潮，如何穿么？”行者道：“你只管驮了去，到寺里，我与你换衣服。”八戒道：“不羞！连你穿的也没有，又替我换！”</p>

<p>行者道：“这般弄嘴，便不驮罢！”八戒道：“不驮！”“便伸过孤拐来，打二十棒！”八戒慌了道：“哥哥，那棒子重，若是打上二十，我与这皇帝一般了。”行者道：“怕打时，趁早儿驮着走路！”八戒果然怕打，没好气把尸首拽将过来，背在身上，拽步出园就走。</p>

<p>好大圣，捻着诀，念声咒语，往巽地上吸一口气，吹将去就是一阵狂风，把八戒撮出皇宫内院，躲离了城池，息了风头，二人落地，徐徐却走将来。那呆子心中暗恼，算计要报恨行者道：“这猴子捉弄我，我到寺里也捉弄他捉弄，撺唆师父，只说他医得活；医不活，教师父念《紧箍儿咒》，把这猴子的脑浆勒出来，方趁我心！”走着路，再再寻思道：“不好！不好！若教他医人，却是容易：他去阎王家讨将魂灵儿来，就医活了。只说不许赴阴司，阳世间就能医活，这法儿才好。”说不了，却到了山门前，径直进去，将尸首丢在那禅堂门前，道：“师父，起来看邪。”那唐僧睡不着，正与沙僧讲行者哄了八戒去久不回之事，忽听得他来叫了一声，唐僧连忙起身道：“徒弟，看甚么？”八戒道：“行者的外公，教老猪驮将来了。”行者道：“你这馕糟的呆子！我那里有甚么外公？”八戒道：“哥，不是你外公，却教老猪驮他来怎么？也不知费了多少力了！”那唐僧与沙僧开门看处，那皇帝容颜未改，似活的一般。长老忽然惨凄道：“陛下，你不知那世里冤家，今生遇着他，暗丧其身，抛妻别子，致令文武不知，多官不晓！可怜你妻子昏蒙，谁曾见焚香献茶？”忽失声泪如雨下。</p>

<p>八戒笑道：“师父，他死了可干你事？又不是你家父祖，哭他怎的！”三藏道：“徒弟啊，出家人慈悲为本，方便为门，你怎的这等心硬？”八戒道：“不是心硬，师兄和我说来，他能医得活。若是医不活，我也不驮他来了。”那长老原来是一头水的，被那呆子摇动了，也便就叫：“悟空，若果有手段医活这个皇帝，正是救人一命，胜造七级浮图，我等也强似灵山拜佛。”行者道：“师父，你怎么信这呆子乱谈！人若死了，或三七五七，尽七七日，受满了阳间罪过，就转生去了，如今已死三年，如何救得！”三藏闻其言道：“也罢了。”八戒苦恨不息道：“师父，你莫被他瞒了，他有些夹脑风。你只念念那话儿，管他还你一个活人。”真个唐僧就念《紧箍儿咒》，勒得那猴子眼胀头疼。毕竟不知怎生医救，且听下回分解。</p>
