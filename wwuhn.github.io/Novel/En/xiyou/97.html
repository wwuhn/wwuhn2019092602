<P>Squire Kou Entertains the Lofty Monk</P>
<P>The Tang Priest Does Not Covet Wealth and Honour</P>
</div>
<P>All kinds of matter are really without matter;</P>
<P>No emptiness is truly empty.</P>
<P>Stillness and clamour, speech and silence, all are the same:</P>
<P>Why bother to dream-talk in one's dreams?</P>
<P>The useful includes the useless in its application;</P>
<P>Achievement lurks within failure.</P>
<P>When the fruit is ripe it reddens of itself;</P>
<P>Do not ask how the seed is to be grown.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The story has told how the Tang Priest and his disciples used their magic powers to stop the monks of the Spread Gold Monastery. When the monks saw after the black wind had passed that the master and his disciples had disappeared they thought that their visitors must have been living Buddhas come down to earth, so they kowtowed and went back. Of them we tell no more. As master and disciples traveled West spring was giving way to early summer:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The air was clear, mild and refreshing;</P>
<P>Water chestnuts and lotuses were growing in the pool.</P>
<P>Plums were ripening after the rain;</P>
<P>The wheat was forming as the breezes blew.</P>
<P>Flowers were fragrant where blossoms fell from trees;</P>
<P>The oriole grew tired amid the willow's light branches.</P>
<P>Swallows over the river taught their young to fly;</P>
<P>The pheasants fed their chirping chicks.</P>
<P>South of the Dipper the sun was always seen;</P>
<P>All of creation shone with brightness.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We could never describe in full how they ate at dawn, found shelter at dusk, rounded ravines and climbed hills as they went along their way without incident for a fortnight. Then another city wall appeared in front of them. As they came closer to it Sanzang asked, &#8220;What sort of place is this, disciple?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I don't know,&#8221; Brother Monkey replied, &#8220;I don't know.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've been this way before,&#8221; put in Pig, &#8220;so how can you claim that you don't know? I suppose you're being crafty and just pretending you can't recognize the place to make fools of us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're being completely unreasonable, you idiot,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Although I've been this way several times I've always come and gone by cloud high up in the sky. I've never landed here. I had no interest in the place, so why should I have looked it over? That's why I didn't know. I'm not being crafty, and not trying to make a fool of you either.&#8221;</P>
<P>While they were talking they came close to the city before they realized it. Sanzang dismounted, crossed the drawbridge and went straight in through the gates. As they went along the main street there were two old men to be seen sitting under a portico and talking.</P>
<P>&#8220;Disciples,&#8221; said Sanzang, &#8220;stand here in the middle of the road, keep your heads bowed and don't run wild. I am going under that portico to ask where we are.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey and the others stood still as they had been told while the venerable elder went up to the two men, put his hands together and called out, &#8220;Greetings, benefactors.&#8221; The two old men were idly chatting about such things as prosperity and decay, success and failure, sages and good men, their heroic deeds in ancient times, and where such men were now. Really, they said, it was enough to make you sigh.</P>
<P>When they suddenly heard Sanzang's greeting they returned it and asked, &#8220;What do you have to say to us, reverend sir?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am a monk who has come from far away to worship the Lord Buddha,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;and I have just arrived here. I wonder what this place is called, and where there are any pious folk from whom I might beg a meal.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is the prefecture of Brazentower,&#8221; one of the old men said, &#8220;and this is the county of Diling near Brazentower city. If you want vegetarian food, reverend sir, you won't need to beg. Go past this archway to the street running North-south. There's a gate-tower shaped like a sitting tiger facing the East, and that's Squire Kou's house. In front of it is a sign that says 'All monks welcome'. A monk from far away such as yourself will be given all you want. Off you go, and stop interrupting our conversation.&#8221;</P>
<P>Sanzang thanked them, turned to Monkey and said, &#8220;This is Diling county in the prefecture of Brazentower. The two old men said that on the street running North-south past this archway there is a gate-tower shaped like a sitting tiger that is Squire Kou's house. In front of it is a sign that says 'All monks welcome'. They told me to go there for a vegetarian meal.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The West is a land of Buddhists,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;and they really do feed monks. As this is only a seat of local government we don't need to present our passport. Let's go and beg ourselves a meal; that'll be all the better for travelling with.&#8221; The master and his three disciples walked slowly along the main street, filling all the people in the market with alarm and suspicion as they crowded around, struggling to see what the strangers looked like.</P>
<P>Sanzang told his disciples to keep their mouths shut, saying, &#8220;Behave yourselves! Behave yourselves!&#8221; The three of them kept their heads bowed, not daring to look up. Then they turned a corner and did indeed see a main road running North-south.</P>
<P>As they were walking along it they saw a gate-tower like a sitting tiger. On a screen wall inside the gateway hung a great sign on which were written the words &#8220;All monks welcome.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The West is indeed the land of the Buddha,&#8221; said Sanzang. &#8220;Nobody, however clever or stupid, is dishonest. I did not believe what the two old men told me. Now I know it is just as they said.&#8221; Being the boor that he was, Pig wanted to go straight in.</P>
<P>&#8220;Just a moment, idiot,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Wait till someone comes out so we can ask what to do before we go in.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Big brother's right,&#8221; said Friar Sand. &#8220;If we don't show respect for his privacy we might irritate the benefactor.&#8221; They let the horse rest and put down the luggage outside the gates. A little later a slave came out with a steelyard and a basket in his hands that the sudden sight of the strangers made him drop in alarm.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; he reported, running inside, &#8220;here are four strange-looking monks outside.&#8221; At the time the gentleman was walking with a stick in the inner courtyard, reciting the name of the Buddha. When he heard the report he dropped his stick and went out to welcome them. Their ugliness did not frighten him.</P>
<P>&#8220;Come in, come in,&#8221; he said. Behaving with all courtesy, Sanzang went inside with him.</P>
<P>The gentleman led them along a passageway and into a house, where he said, &#8220;The upper building includes a Buddha hall, a surra library and a refectory for you gentlemen. The lower building is where your disciple's family lives.&#8221; Sanzang expressed endless admiration. He brought out and put on his cassock to worship the Buddha, then went up into the hall to have a look. What he saw was:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Clouds of incense,</P>
<P>Dazzling candles.</P>
<P>The-ball was filled with a brocade of flowers;</P>
<P>All around was gold and many colours.</P>
<P>From red frames</P>
<P>Hung a bell of purple gold;</P>
<P>On a lacquered stand</P>
<P>Was set a matching decorated drum.</P>
<P>Several pairs of banners</P>
<P>Were embroidered with the eight treasures;</P>
<P>A thousand Buddha statues</P>
<P>Were all covered in gold.</P>
<P>Ancient bronze incense-burners,</P>
<P>Ancient bronze vases,</P>
<P>Carved lacquer tables,</P>
<P>Carved lacquer boxes.</P>
<P>In the ancient bronze incense-burners</P>
<P>Was always eaglewood incense;</P>
<P>In the ancient bronze vases</P>
<P>Were the colours of lotus blossoms.</P>
<P>On the carved lacquer tables</P>
<P>Were fresh fruits;</P>
<P>In the carved lacquer boxes</P>
<P>Fragrant petals were piled.</P>
<P>In glass bowls</P>
<P>Was pure, clear water;</P>
<P>In crystal lamps</P>
<P>The fragrant oil shone bright.</P>
<P>A metal chime</P>
<P>Resounded long and slow.</P>
<P>This was like a treasure house untouched by the world,</P>
<P>A family Buddha hall rivaling a monastery.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The venerable elder washed his hands, took a pinch of incense, kowtowed and worshipped, then turned back to greet the gentleman.</P>
<P>&#8220;Wait a moment,&#8221; Mr. Kou replied. &#8220;Let us make our introductions in the sutra library.&#8221; What they saw there was:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A square stand and upright cupboards,</P>
<P>Jade boxes and golden caskets.</P>
<P>On the square stand and in the upright cupboards</P>
<P>Were piled up countless scriptures;</P>
<P>In the jade boxes and golden caskets</P>
<P>Were stored many a manuscript.</P>
<P>On lacquered tables</P>
<P>Were paper, ink, brushes and inkstones,</P>
<P>All the finest treasures of the study.</P>
<P>Before the scented screen</P>
<P>Were calligraphy, paintings, a lute and chess,</P>
<P>All for the most refined of interests.</P>
<P>A magic chime of light jade covered with gold,</P>
<P>And a copper tripod in the wind and under the moon.</P>
<P>The clear breeze freshens the spirit;</P>
<P>The purified heart is aware; the mind set on the Way is at ease.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the venerable elder had reached the library and was going to bow to him Mr. Kou held on to prevent this and said, &#8220;Won't you take off your cassock?&#8221; Sanzang then took off his cassock, after which he greeted Mr. Kou. He then told Monkey and the other two to greet him too. Orders were given for the horse to be fed and the luggage put in a corridor. The gentleman asked about their background.</P>
<P>&#8220;I have been sent by the emperor of Great Tang in the East,&#8221; Sanzang said, &#8220;to the Vulture Peak in your splendid country to see the Lord Buddha and ask for the true scriptures. I am here to request a meal because I have heard that in your distinguished household you honour monks. After that we will be on our way.&#8221;</P>
<P>The gentleman's face was suffused with pleasure as he replied with a chuckle, &#8220;My name is Kou Hong, my other name is Kou Dakuan, and I have lived for sixty-four wasted years. When I was forty I made a vow to feed ten thousand monks, and you will complete the number. In the twenty-four years during which I have been feeding monks I have kept a record of their names. Having nothing else to do in recent days I have counted the names of all the monks I've fed, and the score is now 9,996. I was only short of four to make up the full number. Then today heaven has you four teachers down to me to complete the ten thousand. Will you be so good as to tell me your names? I hope that you will stay for a month or more until I have celebrated the completion, after which I will send you teachers up the mountain in carrying-chairs or on horses. Vulture Peak is only some 250 miles from here, not at all far away.&#8221; Sanzang was thoroughly delighted to hear this, and he agreed to it all at once.</P>
<P>Several young and old servants fetched firewood, drew water, and brought rice, flour and vegetables into the house with which to prepare them a meal. All this disturbed the gentleman's wife, who said, &#8220;Where have these monks come from, and why is everyone so busy?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Four eminent monks have just arrived,&#8221; the servants told her, &#8220;and when the master asked them where they were from they said they'd been sent by the emperor of the Great Tang in the East to go to worship the Lord Buddha on Vulture Peak. Goodness only knows how far it is to here from there. The master said that they had been sent down from heaven and told us to get them a vegetarian meal quickly.&#8221;</P>
<P>The old woman was also very pleased to hear this, so she told a maid to fetch her clothes so that she too could go to see them. &#8220;Only one of them is handsome, ma'am,&#8221; the servant said. &#8220;The other three don't bear looking at. They're really hideous.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What you people don't realize,&#8221; the old woman replied, &#8220;is that if they look ugly, strange and freakish they must be heavenly beings come down to earth. Hurry and tell your master straight away.&#8221;</P>
<P>The servant ran straight to the surra hall, where he said to the gentleman, &#8220;The old lady's here to pay her respects to the lords from the East.&#8221; On hearing this Sanzang rose from his seat. Before the words had all been spoken the old woman was already before the hall, where she lifted her eyes to see the Tang Priest's majestic countenance and his splendid bearing. When she turned to see the extraordinary appearance of Monkey and the other two she was somewhat alarmed even though she knew they were heavenly beings come down to earth; she fell to her knees and bowed.</P>
<P>Sanzang quickly returned her courtesy, saying, &#8220;Bodhisattva, the honour you do me is undeserved.&#8221; The old woman then asked her husband why the four reverend gentlemen were not all sitting together.</P>
<P>&#8220;We three are disciples,&#8221; said Pig, thrusting his snout forward. Goodness! His voice was like the roar of a tiger deep in the mountains. The old woman was terrified.</P>
<P>As they were talking another servant appeared to announce, &#8220;The two young masters are here too.&#8221; When Sanzang turned quickly round to look he saw that they were two young scholars, who prostrated themselves to the venerable elder after walking into the sutra hall. Sanzang was quick to return their courtesy. Mr. Kou then came up to take hold of him and say, &#8220;These are my two sons. Their names are Kou Liang and Kou Dong. They have just come back from their school and have not yet had their lunch. They are here to pay their respects because they have heard that you teachers have come down to earth.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What fine sons,&#8221; said Sanzang with delight, &#8220;what fine sons. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you want to make a lofty match you must do good:</P>
<P>The success of your sons and grandsons depends on study.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The two scholars then asked their father, &#8220;Where have these lords come from?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;From a long way away,&#8221; Mr. Kou replied with a smile. &#8220;The emperor of Great Tang in the East of the Southern Continent of Jambu has sent them to Vulture Peak to worship the Lord Buddha and fetch the scriptures.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We have read in the<I> Compendious Forest of Facts</I> that there are four continents in the world,&#8221; the scholars said. &#8220;This continent of ours is the Western Continent of Cattle-gift. There is also an Eastern Continent of Superior Body. How many years did it take you to get here?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I have been a long time on the journey,&#8221; Sanzang replied with a smile, &#8220;met many vicious demons and monsters, and suffered greatly. I have been greatly indebted to my three disciples for their protection. Altogether it has taken me fourteen winters and summers to reach your splendid country.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the scholars heard this they said with unbounded admiration, &#8220;You really are holy monks, you really are.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before they had finished speaking a servant came in to invite them to eat: &#8220;The vegetarian banquet has been set out, so will you eat, my lords?&#8221; The gentleman then sent his wife and sons back to the house, while he went with the four monks into the refectory for the meal. Everything was set out very neatly. There were gold-lacquered tables and black-lacquered chairs. In front were fine cakes of many colours that skilled chefs had made up in up-to-date styles. The second row contained five dishes of hors-d'oeuvres, in the third row there were five dishes of fruit, and in the fourth were five large dishes of snacks. Everything tasted good, looked good and smelt good. Vegetable soup, rice and steamed breadrolls were all spicy, piping hot, and most delicious. There was plenty to fill one's stomach. Seven or eight servants rushed around waiting on them, while four of five cooks were kept constantly busy. Just watch while some poured soup and others filled the rice bowls, coming and going like shooting stars chasing the moon. Pig was finishing up bowls in single mouthfuls, like a gale blowing the clouds away. Thus master and disciples ate their fill. Sanzang then rose to thank Mr. Kou for the meal before setting out again.</P>
<P>The gentleman blocked his way saying, &#8220;Teacher, won't you take things easy and spend a few days here? As the saying goes, it's nothing to start a journey but it's hard to end one. I will send you on your way when we have celebrated the completion of my vow.&#8221; Seeing how sincere and determined he was, Sanzang had no option but to stay.</P>
<P>Five to seven days quickly passed before Mr. Kou engaged twenty-four local Buddhist monks to perform a mass to celebrate the fulfillment of the vow. The monks spent three or four days writing texts out and chose a lucky day on which to begin the Buddhist service. The way they did it was like in the Great Tang. There was</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A great display of banners,</P>
<P>Where the golden countenance was set out;</P>
<P>Rows of candles</P>
<P>And incense burnt in offering.</P>
<P>Drums and gongs were beaten,</P>
<P>Pipes and shawms were played.</P>
<P>Cloud-cymbals,</P>
<P>Pure-toned flutes,</P>
<P>Sounded in tune;</P>
<P>To the beat of the drum,</P>
<P>And the woodwind's notes,</P>
<P>The words of sutras were recited in unison.</P>
<P>First the local god was put at ease,</P>
<P>Then spirit generals were invited to come.</P>
<P>The documents were sent out,</P>
<P>And they bowed low to the Buddha statues,</P>
<P>Reciting the Peacock Sutra,</P>
<P>Each word of which could sweep away disasters,</P>
<P>A stand of lamps was lit for Bhaisajya-guru,</P>
<P>To shine with flames of dazzling brightness.</P>
<P>They performed the Water Ceremony</P>
<P>To end any sense of grievance.</P>
<P>Then they intoned the Avatamsaka Sutra</P>
<P>To do away with slander.</P>
<P>The Three Vehicles of the Wonderful Law are very fine:</P>
<P>Different monks are all the same.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The mass lasted for three days and nights before it ended. In his longing to go to the Thunder Monastery the Tang Priest was determined to be on his way, so he took his leave of them and thanked them.</P>
<P>&#8220;Teacher, you are very eager to say good-bye,&#8221; Mr. Kou said. &#8220;I suppose you must have taken offence because for days on end we have been so busy with our service that we have treated you very offhandedly.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We have put your noble house to a great deal of trouble,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;and I do not know how we will ever repay you. How could we possibly have taken offence? But when my wise monarch saw me off through the passes all those years ago he asked me when I would be back. I wrongly told him that I would return in three years, never imagining that the journey would be so badly delayed that it has already lasted fourteen years. I do not even know whether I will succeed in fetching the scriptures, and it will take me another twelve or thirteen years to get back. How am I to face the penalty for breaking my monarch's sage command? I beg you, sir, to let me go to fetch the scriptures and return. Next time I come to your mansion I will be able to stay much longer.&#8221;</P>
<P>This was more than Pig could bear. &#8220;You don't care at all about what we want, Master,&#8221; he shouted at the top of his voice. &#8220;You're showing no consideration at all. The old gentleman's very rich, and now he's fulfilled his vow to feed monks. Besides, he's really sincere about wanting to keep us here. It'd do no harm if we stayed here for a year or so. Why be so set on going? Why leave all this good food to go begging for meals elsewhere? Is it your parents' home ahead?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;All you care about is food, you cretin,&#8221; shouted Sanzang angrily. &#8220;You don't care at all about the transference of cause and effect. Really, you're such an animal you'd eat from the trough to scratch the itch in your belly. If you people are going to be so greedy and stupid I'll go by myself tomorrow.&#8221;</P>
<P>Seeing that the master's attitude had changed, Monkey grabbed hold of Pig and punched his head. &#8220;You've got no sense, you idiot,&#8221; he said abusively. &#8220;You've made the master angry with us too.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;He deserved that,&#8221; said Friar Sand with a grin, &#8220;he deserved that. He's disgusting enough even if he doesn't say a word, but he would have to interrupt.&#8221; Breathing heavily, the idiot stood to one side, not daring to say another word.</P>
<P>Seeing the anger of master and disciple, Mr. Kou said, his face wreathed in smiles, &#8220;Do not be so short-tempered, teacher. Make yourself comfortable for the rest of the day. Tomorrow I will have banners and drums brought here and ask some relations and neighbors to come to see you off.&#8221;</P>
<P>As they were talking the old woman come out again to say. &#8220;Venerable teacher, as you have come to our house you should not refuse too insistently. How many days have you spent here now?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;It is already a fortnight,&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;That fortnight is my gentleman's achievement,&#8221; the old woman said. &#8220;I have a little pin-money with which I would like to entertain you gentlemen for another fortnight.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before she had finished speaking Kou Dong and his brother came out again to say, &#8220;Your four lordships, in the twenty and more years during which our father has been feeding monks he has never met better ones than yourselves. Now that by your gracious condescension you have made up the total you really have brought glory to our thatched hovel. We two are too young to understand about cause and effect, but we have often heard it said,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The husband gets what he has merited,</P>
<P>The wife gets what she has merited;</P>
<P>Nothing is got when nothing is merited.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Our father and mother each want to make a humble offering in order that each of them may merit a reward, so why must you refuse so insistently? And as we two brothers have saved a little of our school fees we hope to be allowed to support you gentlemen for another fortnight before seeing you on your way.</P>
<P>&#8220;I dare not accept even the lavish hospitality of the venerable Bodhisattva your mother,&#8221; Sanzang replied, &#8220;so how could I accept you brothers' generosity? I could not possibly do so. I really must set out today. Please, please do not take offence. If I do not go now I will be unable to avoid execution for exceeding my emperor's time-limit by so long.&#8221;</P>
<P>When the old woman and her two sons realized that Sanzang was determined not to stay they started losing their patience.</P>
<P>&#8220;We invite you very nicely to stay,&#8221; they said, &#8220;but you're obstinately set on going. If you're going, go, and cut out this chatter.&#8221; Mother and sons then left to go back to the house. Pig could hold his tongue no longer.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; he said to the Tang Priest, &#8220;don't overdo it. As the saying goes, 'If you can stay, don't go away.' Let's stay here for another month to let the mother and her sons fulfil their wishes. Why do you have to be in such a rush?&#8221; The Tang Priest made another angry noise at him and shouted again.</P>
<P>The idiot then slapped his own face twice, saying, &#8220;Tut, tut, tut. Don't talk out of turn. You spoke again.&#8221; Brother Monkey and Friar Sand, who were standing to one side, started spluttering with laughter. The Tang Priest was angry with Monkey again.</P>
<P>&#8220;What are you laughing at?&#8221; he asked, and made the hand magic, ready to recite the Band-tightening Spell.</P>
<P>This so terrified Monkey that he fell to his knees at once and said, &#8220;I didn't laugh, Master. Whatever you do, don't say the spell! Don't say it!&#8221;</P>
<P>Seeing that master and disciples were getting into a worse and worse temper with each other Mr. Kou gave up his insistence on their staying. &#8220;Don't quarrel, teachers,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I'll definitely see you on your way tomorrow morning.&#8221; He then left the sutra hall and told his secretary to write a hundred or so invitations to his neighbors and relations to see the Tang Priest off to the West early the next morning. He told the cooks to lay on a parting banquet, while also instructing his steward to have twenty pairs of coloured flags made, hire a band of musicians, and engage a group of Buddhist monks from the Monastery from the South and another group of Taoist priests from the Eastern Peak Temple. Everything was to be ready and in order by ten in the morning. All the gentleman's staff went off to carry out their orders. Soon it was evening again, and after supper everyone went to bed. It was the time when</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Dots of homegoing rooks pass the lonely village;</P>
<P>Drum and bell can be heard from each other's distant towers.</P>
<P>In streets and markets the bustle is stilled;</P>
<P>In all the houses the lamps shine dimly.</P>
<P>Flowers in the breeze throw shadows under the moon;</P>
<P>The stars shine bright against the Milky Way.</P>
<P>Where the cuckoo sings the night seems deeper;</P>
<P>All natural sounds are stilled across the earth.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>During the third and fourth watches of the night all the household servants in charge of various matters got up early to attend to their tasks. Just watch. The cooks preparing the banquet were busy in the kitchen. The people who had to buy coloured flags were bustling in front of the hall. Those engaging Buddhist and Taoist clergy were hurrying about as fast as their legs could carry them. Those hiring musicians were in a great rush. The messengers delivering invitations ran all over the place, while the servants preparing the carrying-chairs and horses were calling to each other. They were all shouting from the middle of the night until dawn, and by around ten o'clock everything was prepared. This was all because the family was rich.</P>
<P>The story tells how the Tang Priest and his disciples got up early to be waited on once more by that crowd of servants. The venerable elder told them to pack the baggage and saddle the horse. When the idiot heard that they were about to go he pulled a face, pouted and grumbled, but he still had to pack the clothes and begging bowls then go to look for the carrying pole. Friar Sand brushed the horse, saddled and harnessed it, and stood waiting. Brother Monkey put the nine-ringed monastic staff in his master's hand and hung the passport in a bag in front of his chest. They were now all ready to set out. Mr. Kou then invited them into the large hall at the back, where a feast was set out that excelled even the one they had eaten in the refectory.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Curtains hung from on high;</P>
<P>Screens stood all around.</P>
<P>In the middle was a picture:</P>
<P>A mountain of long life and a sea of blessings.</P>
<P>On both walls were displayed.</P>
<P>Scrolls of spring, summer, autumn and winter.</P>
<P>From the dragon-patterned tripod came clouds of incense;</P>
<P>Above magpie-tailed burners rose auspicious vapors.</P>
<P>In bowls were bunches of color,</P>
<P>Fresh and brilliant flowers of splendid form.</P>
<P>The tables were piled with gold:</P>
<P>Lines of confections shaped like lions and immortals.</P>
<P>Music and dancing before the steps were in true harmony;</P>
<P>The dishes in the hall were like a brocade.</P>
<P>Exquisite soup and rice, both free of meat;</P>
<P>The finest tea and the best of wines.</P>
<P>Although they were only commoners</P>
<P>Their home was fine enough for a prince.</P>
<P>All that could be heard were happy sounds</P>
<P>So loud they surprised the sky and shook the earth.</P>
<P>The venerable elder was just exchanging courtesies with Mr. Kou when a servant came in to report, &#8220;The guests are all here.&#8221; These were the people who had been invited&#8212;neighbors, relations by marriage, and some of his pious friends who also fed monks and recited the name of the Buddha&#8212;and all of them bowed to the venerable elder. After the greetings had been made everyone sat down. Outside the hall zithers and panpipes were played, while inside the hall pipas and songs accompanied the banquet. Pig paid great attention to this rich banquet.</P>
<P>&#8220;Brother,&#8221; he said to Friar Sand, &#8220;relax and eat as much as you can. There won't be anything as good as this to eat after we leave the Kou house.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; Friar Sand replied with a laugh. &#8220;As the saying goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>No matter how splendid the banquet you eat,</P>
<P>For only a while can it keep you replete.</P>
<P>Your savings may meet the expense of the road,</P>
<P>But savings can never in bellies be stowed.&#8221;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're hopeless,&#8221; said Pig, &#8220;hopeless. If I eat my fill today I won't feel hungry for the next three days.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Idiot,&#8221; said Monkey, who had heard this. &#8220;Don't fill your belly till it bursts. We've got to start walking now.&#8221;</P>
<P>They were still talking, and it was almost noon when Sanzang raised his chopsticks and said grace. Pig grabbed a bowl, filled it with desperate speed, and ate five or six bowlfuls in succession, gulping down a whole bowlful at a time. Without any qualms at all he filled both his sleeves with steamed bread, twists, pancakes and cooked dishes before rising with his master. Sanzang thanked the gentleman and everyone else, then they all went outside together. Just look at the coloured banners, splendid canopies, drummers and instrumentalists outside. Only then did two groups of clergy, one Buddhist and one Taoist, arrive.</P>
<P>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; said Mr. Kou, &#8220;you are late. Our teacher is in a hurry to leave, so I will not be able to offer you a meal. I'll show you my gratitude when we come back.&#8221; Everyone then opened a way to let them through, the carriers carrying their chairs, the riders on their horses and the walkers on foot all let Sanzang and his three disciples go first. The heavens rang with drumming and music, the flags and banner blotted out the sun, crowds pressed around, and carriages and horses were all packed close together as everyone came to watch Mr. Kou seeing the Tang Priest off. The splendor all around was more magnificent than pearls or jade, and no less fine than brocade screens behind which spring lies hidden.</P>
<P>The Buddhist monks playing Buddhist tunes and the Taoist priests their Taoist airs all escorted the travelers out of the prefecture. When they reached the three-mile pavilion, baskets of food and jars of drink were set out, cups were raised, and they all drank parting toasts.</P>
<P>Mr. Kou, loath to let them go, said as he choked back his tears, &#8220;Teacher, you must spend some more days with us on your way back with the scriptures to fulfil my longing.&#8221; Overcome with gratitude, Sanzang thanked him at great length.</P>
<P>&#8220;If I reach Vulture Peak,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and see the Lord Buddha the first thing I will do will be to praise your great virtue. We will certainly come to kowtow to you in thanks on our return journey.&#8221; As they talked they covered another mile or so without noticing it. Then the venerable elder insisted on taking his leave, at which Mr. Kou turned back, sobbing aloud. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He who had vowed to feed the clergy found enlightenment:</P>
<P>He was not fated to see the Tathagata Buddha.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We will tell not of how Mr. Kou went home with everyone after seeing the travelers off as far as the three-mile pavilion, but of how the master and his three disciples went on for some twelve or fifteen miles. By now it was growing dark.</P>
<P>&#8220;It's late,&#8221; Sanzang said. &#8220;Where are we to spend the night?&#8221;</P>
<P>Pig, who was carrying the pole, pulled a face and said, &#8220;You would have to leave ready-cooked meals behind and refuse to stay in a nice cool brick house so as to go wherever it is we're going. That's just asking for trouble. It's very late now. What'll we do if it starts raining?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Evil, insolent beast,&#8221; cursed Sanzang, &#8220;complaining again. As the saying goes,</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The capital may be remarkably fine,</P>
<P>But we can't linger here for a very long time.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If we are fated to visit the Lord Buddha, fetch the true scriptures, go back to Great Tang and report to the emperor I will let you eat in the imperial kitchens for years on end. Then, you evil beast, you will swell up till you burst. That will teach you to be such a greedy devil.&#8221; The idiot chortled quietly to himself, but did not dare say another word.</P>
<P>When Brother Monkey raised his eyes to look around he saw some buildings beside the road and asked his master urgently, &#8220;Can we spend the night here? Can we?&#8221; Sanzang went over to the place, where he saw a ruined memorial arch on which was inscribed</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>THE VIHARA OF PADMAPRABHA</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;The Bodhisattva Padmaprabha was a disciple of the Buddha Sikhin,&#8221; said Sanzang, dismounting. &#8220;He was dismissed for eliminating the Demon King of Poison Fire and turned into the Spirit Officer of the Five Manifests. There must be a shrine here.&#8221; They then all went in together. The cloisters had all collapsed, the walls had fallen down, and there was no trace of anybody around, only of vegetation running wild. They would have gone out again, but the sky had filled with dark clouds and it had started to pour with rain. There was nothing for it but to find a place in the ruins where they could shelter from the storm. They kept completely silent, not daring to speak aloud for fear that some evil demon might hear them. Thus it was that they endured a sleepless night sitting or standing there. Oh dear! How true it is that</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Disaster strikes at triumph's height;</P>
<P>In time of joy comes sorrow's blight.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know what happened when they carried on with their journey, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>寇员外喜待高僧</p>
<p>唐长老不贪富贵</p>
</div>
<p>色色原无色，空空亦非空。静喧语默本来同，梦里何劳说梦。有用用中无用，无功功里施功。还如果熟自然红，莫问如何修种。话表唐僧师众，使法力，阻住那布金寺僧。僧见黑风过处，不见他师徒，以为活佛临凡，磕头而回不题。他师徒们西行，正是春尽夏初时节：清和天气爽，池沼芰荷生。梅逐雨余熟，麦随风里成。草香花落处，莺老柳枝轻。江燕携雏习，山鸡哺子鸣。斗南当日永，万物显光明，说不尽那朝餐暮宿，转涧寻坡。在那平安路上，行经半月，前边又见一城垣相近。三藏问道：“徒弟，此又是甚么去处！”行者道：“不知，不知。”八戒笑道：“这路是你行过的，怎说不知！却是又有些儿跷蹊。故意推不认得，捉弄我们哩。”行者道：“这呆子全不察理！这路虽是走过几遍，那时只在九霄空里，驾云而来，驾云而去，何曾落在此地？事不关心，查他做甚，此所以不知。却有甚跷蹊，又捉弄你也？”</p>

<p>说话间，不觉已至边前，三藏下马，过吊桥，径入门里。长街上，只见廊下坐着两个老儿叙话。三藏叫：“徒弟，你们在那街心里站住，低着头，不要放肆，等我去那廊下问个地方。”行者等果依言立住，长老近前合掌叫声“老施主，贫僧问讯了。”</p>

<p>那二老正在那里闲讲闲论，说甚么兴衰得失，谁圣谁贤，当时的英雄事业，而今安在，诚可谓大叹息，忽听得道声问讯，随答礼道：“长老有何话说？”三藏道：“贫僧乃远方来拜佛祖的，适到宝方，不知是甚地名，那里有向善的人家，化斋一顿？”老者道：“我敝处是铜台府，府后有一县叫做地灵县。长老若要吃斋，不须募化，过此牌坊，南北街，坐西向东者，有一个虎坐门楼，乃是寇员外家，他门前有个万僧不阻之牌。似你这远方僧，尽着受用。去！去！去！莫打断我们的话头。”三藏谢了，转身对行者道：“此处乃铜台府地灵县。那二老道：‘过此牌坊，南北街，向东虎坐门楼，有个寇员外家，他门前有个万僧不阻之牌。’教我到他家去吃斋哩。”沙僧道：“西方乃佛家之地，真个有斋僧的。此间既是府县，不必照验关文，我们去化些斋吃了，就好走路。长老与三人缓步长街，又惹得那市口里人，都惊惊恐恐，猜猜疑疑的。围绕争看他们相貌。长老吩咐闭口，只教“莫放肆！莫放肆！”三人果低着头，不取仰视。转过拐角，果见一条南北大街。正行时，见一个虎坐门楼，门里边影壁上挂着一面大牌，书着万僧不阻四字。三藏道：“西方佛地，贤者愚者俱无诈伪。那二老说时，我犹不信，至此果如其言。”八戒村野，就要进去。行者道：“呆子且住，待有人出来，问及何如，方好进去。”沙僧道：“大哥说得有理，恐一时不分内外，惹施主烦恼。”</p>

<p>在门口歇下马匹行李。须臾间，有个苍头出来，提着一把秤，一只篮儿，猛然看见，慌的丢了，倒跑进去报道：“主公！外面有四个异样僧家来也！”那员外拄着拐，正在天井中闲走，口里不住的念佛，一闻报道，就丢了拐，出来迎接，见他四众，也不怕丑恶，只叫：“请进，请进。”三藏谦谦逊逊，一同都入。转过一条巷子，员外引路，至一座房里，说道：“此上手房宇，乃管待老爷们的佛堂、经堂、斋堂、下手的，是我弟子老小居住。”三藏称赞不已，随取袈裟穿了拜佛，举步登堂观看，但见那：香云叆叇，烛焰光辉。满堂中锦簇花攒，四下里金铺彩绚。朱红架，高挂紫金钟；彩漆檠，对设花腔鼓。几对幡，绣成八宝；千尊佛，尽戗黄金。古铜炉；古铜瓶；雕漆桌，雕漆盒。古铜炉内，常常不断沉檀；古铜瓶中，每有莲花现彩。雕漆桌上五云鲜，雕漆盒中香瓣积。玻璃盏，净水澄清；瑠璃灯；香油明亮。一声金磬，响韵虚徐。真个是红尘不到赛珍楼，家奉佛堂欺上刹。长老净了手，拈了香，叩头拜毕，却转回与员外行礼。员外道：“且住！请到经堂中相见。”又见那：“方台竖柜，玉匣金函。方台竖柜，堆积着无数经文；玉匣金函，收贮着许多简札。彩漆桌上，有纸墨笔砚，都是些精精致致的文房；椒粉屏前，有书画琴棋，尽是些妙妙玄玄的真趣。放一口轻玉浮金之仙磬，挂一柄披风披月之龙髯。清气令人神气爽，斋心自觉道心闲。长老到此，正欲行礼，那员外又搀住道：“请宽佛衣”。三藏脱了袈裟，才与长老见了，又请行者三人见了，又叫把马喂了，行李安在廊下，方问起居。</p>

<p>三藏道：“贫僧是东土大唐钦差，诣宝方谒灵山见佛祖求真经者。闻知尊府敬僧，故此拜见，求一斋就行。”员外面生喜色，笑吟吟的道：“弟子贱名寇洪，字大宽，虚度六十四岁。自四十岁上，许斋万僧，才做圆满。今已斋了二十四年，有一簿斋僧的帐目。连日无事，把斋过的僧名算一算，已斋过九千九百九十六员，止少四众，不得圆满。今日可可的天降老师四位，完足万僧之数，请留尊讳，好歹宽住月余，待做了圆满，弟子着轿马送老师上山。此间到灵山只有八百里路，苦不远也。”三藏闻言，十分欢喜，都就权且应承不题。</p>

<p>他那几个大小家僮，往宅里搬柴打水，取米面蔬菜，整治斋供，忽惊动员外妈妈问道：“是那里来的僧，这等上紧？”僮仆道：“才有四位高僧，爹爹问他起居，他说是东土大唐皇帝差来的，往灵山拜佛爷爷，到我们这里，不知有多少路程。爹爹说是天降的，吩咐我们快整斋，供养他也。”那老妪听说也喜，叫丫鬟：“取衣服来我穿，我也去看看。”僮仆道：“奶奶，只一位看得，那三位看不得，形容丑得狠哩。老妪道：“汝等不知，但形容丑陋，古怪清奇，必是天人下界。快先去报你爹爹知道。”那僮仆跑至经堂对员外道：“奶奶来了，要拜见东土老爷哩。”三藏听见，即起身下座。说不了，老妪已至堂前，举目见唐僧相貌轩昂，丰姿英伟。转面见行者三人模样非凡，虽知他是天人下界，却也有几分悚惧，朝上跪拜。三藏急急还礼道：“有劳菩萨错敬。”老妪问员外说道：“四位师父，怎不并坐？”八戒掬着嘴道：</p>

<p>“我三个是徒弟。”噫！他这一声，就如深山虎啸，那妈妈一发害怕。</p>

<p>正说处，又见一个家僮来报道：“两个叔叔也来了。三藏急转身看时，原来是两个少年秀才。那秀才走上经堂，对长老倒身下拜，慌得三藏急便还礼。员外上前扯住道：“这是我两个小儿，唤名寇梁、寇栋，在书房里读书方回，来吃午饭，知老师下降，故来拜也。”三藏喜道：“贤哉！贤哉！正是欲高门第须为善，要好儿孙在读书。”二秀才启上父亲道：“这老爷是那里来的？”</p>

<p>员外笑道：“来路远哩，南赡部洲东土大唐皇帝钦差到灵山拜佛祖爷爷取经的。”秀才道：“我看《事林广记》上，盖天下只有四大部洲。我们这里叫做西牛贺洲，还有个东胜神洲。想南赡部洲至此，不知走了多少年代？”三藏笑道：“贫僧在路，耽阁的日子多，行的日子少。常遭毒魔狠怪，万苦千辛，甚亏我三个徒弟保护，共计一十四遍寒暑，方得至宝方。”秀才闻言，称奖不尽道：“真是神僧！真是神僧！说未毕，又有个小的来请道：“斋筵已摆，请老爷进斋。”员外着妈妈与儿子转宅，他却陪四众进斋堂吃斋。那里铺设的齐整，但见：金漆桌案，黑漆交椅。前面是五色高果，俱巧匠新装成的时样。第二行五盘小菜，第三行五碟水果，第四行五大盘闲食。般般甜美，件件馨香。素汤米饭，蒸卷馒头，辣辣灶灶腾腾，尽皆可口，真足充肠。七八个僮仆往来奔奉，四五个庖丁不住手。你看那上汤的上汤，添饭的添饭，一往一来，真如流星赶月。这猪八戒一口一碗，就是风卷残云，师徒们尽受用了一顿。长老起身对员外谢了斋，就欲走路。那员外拦住道：“老师，放心住几日儿。常言道，起头容易结梢难。只等我做过了圆满，方敢送程。”三藏见他心诚意恳，没奈何住了。</p>

<p>早经过五七遍朝夕，那员外才请了本处应佛僧二十四员，办做圆满道场。众僧们写作有三四日，选定良辰，开启佛事，他那里与大唐的世情一般，却倒也：大扬幡，铺设金容；齐秉烛，烧香供养。擂鼓敲铙。吹笙捻管。云锣儿，横笛音清，也都是尺工字样。打一回，吹一荡，朗言齐语开经藏。先安土地，次请神将。发了文书，拜了佛像。谈一部《孔雀经》，句句消灾障；点一架药师灯，焰焰辉光亮。拜水忏，解冤愆；讽《华严》。除诽谤。</p>

<p>三乘妙法甚精勤，一二沙门皆一样。如此做了三昼夜，道场已毕。唐僧想着雷音，一心要去，又相辞谢。员外道：“老师辞别甚急，想是连日佛事冗忙，多致简慢，有见怪之意。”三藏道：</p>

<p>“深扰尊府，不知何以为报，怎敢言怪！但只当时圣君送我出关，问几时可回，我就误答三年可回，不期在路耽阁，今已十四年矣！取经未知有无，及回又得十二三年，岂不违背圣旨？罪何可当！望老员外让贫僧前去，待取得经回，再造府久住些时，有何不可！”八戒忍不住高叫道：“师父忒也不从人愿！不近人情！老员外大家巨富，许下这等斋僧之愿，今已圆满，又况留得至诚，须住年把，也不妨事，只管要去怎的？放了这等现成好斋不吃，却往人家化募！前头有你甚老爷、老娘家哩？”长老咄的喝了一声道：“你这夯货，只知要吃，更不管回向之因，正是那槽里吃食，胃里擦痒的畜生！汝等既要贪此嗔痴，明日等我自家去罢。”行者见师父变了脸，即揪住八戒，着头打一顿拳，骂道：“呆子不知好歹，惹得师父连我们都怪了！”沙僧笑道：“打得好！打得好！只这等不说话，还惹人嫌，且又插嘴！”那呆子气呼呼的立在旁边，再不敢言。员外见他师徒们生恼，只得满面陪笑道：“老师莫焦燥，今日且少宽容，待明日我办些旗鼓，请几个邻里亲戚，送你们起程。”</p>

<p>正讲处，那老妪又出来道：“老师父，既蒙到舍，不必苦辞。</p>

<p>今到几日了？”三藏道：“已半月矣。”老妪道：“这半月算我员外的功德，老身也有些针线钱儿，也愿斋老师父半月。”说不了，寇栋兄弟又出来道：“四位老爷，家父斋僧二十余年，更不曾遇着好人，今幸圆满，四位下降，诚然是蓬屋生辉。学生年幼，不知因果，常闻得有云，公修公得，婆修婆得，不修不得。我家父家母各欲献芹者，正是各求得些因果，何必苦辞？就是愚兄弟，也省得有些束修钱儿，也只望供养老爷半月，方才送行。”三藏道：“令堂老菩萨盛情，已不敢领，怎么又承贤昆玉厚爱？决不敢领。今朝定要起身，万勿见罪，不然，久违钦限，罪不容诛矣。”那老妪与二子见他执一不住，便生起恼来道：“好意留他，他这等固执要去，要去便就去了罢！只管劳叨甚么！”母子遂抽身进去。八戒忍不住口，又对唐僧道：“师父，不要拿过了班儿。</p>

<p>常言道，留得在，落得怪。我们且住一个月儿，了了他母子的愿心也罢了，只管忙怎的？”唐僧又咄了一声喝道，那呆子就自家把嘴打了两下道：“啐！啐！啐！”说道：“莫多话！又做声了！”</p>

<p>行者与沙僧欷欷的笑在一边。唐僧又怪行者道：“你笑甚么？”ｗωｗ奇Qisuu書com网</p>

<p>即捻诀要念紧箍儿咒，慌得个行者跪下道：“师父，我不曾笑，我不曾笑！千万莫念，莫念！”员外又见他师徒们渐生烦恼，再也不敢苦留，只叫：“老师不必吵闹，准于明早送行。”遂此出了经堂，吩咐书办，写了百十个简帖儿，邀请邻里亲戚，明早奉送唐朝老师西行；一壁厢又叫庖人安排饯行的筵宴；一壁厢又叫管办的做二十对彩旗，觅一班吹鼓手乐人，南来寺里请一班和尚，东岳观里请一班道士，限明日已时，各项俱要整齐。众执事领命去讫，不多时，天又晚了。吃了晚斋，各归寝处，正是那：几点归鸦过别村，楼头钟鼓远相闻。六街三市人烟静，万户千门灯火昏。月皎风清花弄影，银河惨淡映星辰。子规啼处更深矣，天籁无声大地钧。当时三四更天气，各管事的家僮，尽皆早起，买办各项物件。你看那办筵席的厨上慌忙，置彩旗的堂前吵闹，请僧道的两脚奔波，叫鼓乐的一声急纵，送简帖的东走西跑，备轿马的上呼下应。这半夜，直嚷至天明，将已时前后，各项俱完，也只是有钱不过。</p>

<p>却表唐僧师徒们早起，又有那一班人供奉。长老吩咐收拾行李，扣备马匹。呆子听说要走，又努嘴胖唇，唧唧哝哝，只得将衣钵收拾，找启高肩担子。沙僧刷鞄马匹，套起鞍辔伺候。行者将九环杖递在师父手里，他将通关文牒的引袋儿，挂在胸前，只是一齐要走。员外又都请至后面大厂厅内，那里面又铺设了筵宴，比斋堂中相待的更是不同。但见那：帘幕高挂，屏围四绕，正中间，挂一幅寿山福海之图；两壁厢，列四轴春夏秋冬之景。龙文鼎内香飘霭，鹊尾炉中瑞气生。看盘簇彩，宝妆花色色鲜明；排桌堆金，狮仙糖齐齐摆列。阶前鼓舞按宫商，堂上果肴铺锦绣。素汤素饭甚清奇，香酒香茶多美艳。虽然是百姓之家，却不亚王侯之宅。只听得一片欢声，真个也惊天动地。长老正与员外作礼。只见家僮来报：“客俱到了。”却是那请来的左邻、右舍、妻弟、姨兄、姐夫、妹丈，又有那些同道的斋公，念佛的善友，一齐都向长老礼拜。拜毕各各叙坐，只见堂下面鼓瑟吹笙，堂上边弦歌酒宴。这一席盛宴，八戒留心对沙僧道：</p>

<p>“兄弟，放怀放量吃些儿。离了寇家，再没这好丰盛的东西了！”</p>

<p>沙僧笑道：“二哥说那里话！常言道，珍馐百味，一饱便休。只有私房路，那有私房肚！”八戒道：“你也忒不济！不济！我这一顿尽饱吃了，就是三日也急忙不饿。行者听见道：“呆子，莫胀破了肚子！如今要走路哩！”</p>

<p>说不了，日将中矣，长老在上举箸，念揭斋经。八戒慌了，拿过添饭来，一口一碗，又丢彀有五六碗，把那馒头、卷儿、饼子、烧果，没好没歹的，满满笼了两袖，才跟师父起身。长老谢了员外，又谢了众人，一同出门。你看那门外摆着彩旗宝盖，鼓手乐人。又见那两班僧道方来，员外笑道：“列位来迟，老师去急，不及奉斋，俟回来谢罢。”众等让叙道路，抬轿的抬轿，骑马的骑马，步行的步行，都让长老四众前行。只闻得鼓乐喧天，旗幡蔽日，人烟凑集，车马骈填，都来看寇员外迎送唐僧。这一场富贵，真赛过珠围翠绕，诚不亚锦帐藏春！那一班僧，打一套佛曲；那一班道，吹一道玄音，俱送出府城之外。行至十里长亭，又设着箪食壶浆，擎杯把盏，相饮而别。那员外犹不忍舍，噙着泪道：“老师取经回来，是必到舍再住几日，以了我寇洪之心。”</p>

<p>三藏感之不尽，谢之无已道：“我若到灵山，得见佛祖，首表员外之大德。回时定踵门叩谢，叩谢！”说说话儿，不觉的又有二三里路，长老恳切拜辞，那员外又放声大哭而转。这正是“有愿斋僧归妙觉，无缘得见佛如来。</p>

<p>且不说寇员外送至十里长亭，同众回家。却说他师徒四众，行有四五十里之地，天色将晚。长老道：“天晚了，何方借宿？”八戒挑着担，努着嘴道：“放了现成茶饭不吃，清凉瓦屋不住，却要走甚么路，象抢丧踵魂的！如今天晚，倘下起雨来，却如之何！”三藏骂道：“泼孽畜，又来报怨了！常言道，长安虽好，不是久恋之家。待我们有缘拜了佛祖，取得真经，那时回转大唐，奏过主公，将那御厨里饭，凭你吃上几年，胀死你这孽畜，教你做个饱鬼！”那呆子吓吓的暗笑，不敢复言。行者举目遥观，只见大路旁有几间房宇，急请师父道：“那里安歇，那里安歇。”长老至前，见是一座倒塌的牌坊，坊上有一旧扁，扁上有落颜色积尘的四个大字，乃华光行院。长老下了马道：“华光菩萨是火焰五光佛的徒弟，因剿除毒火鬼王，降了职，化做五显灵官，此间必有庙祝。”遂一齐进去，但见廊房俱倒，墙壁皆倾，更不见人之踪迹，只是些杂草丛菁。欲抽身而出，不期天上黑云盖顶，大雨淋漓。没奈何，却在那破房之下，拣遮得风雨处，将身躲避。密密寂寂，不敢高声，恐有妖邪知觉。坐的坐，站的站，苦捱了一夜未睡。咦！真个是：泰极还生否，乐处又逢悲。</p>

<p>毕竟不知天晓向前去还是如何，且听下回分解。</p>
