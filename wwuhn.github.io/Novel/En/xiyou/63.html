<div class="title">
<P>Cleansed and with a Washed Heart He Sweeps the Pagoda</P>
<P>The Devils Are Captured and Converted; the Body Is Cultivated</P>
</div>
<P>Through all the hours it must never be forgotten:</P>
<P>When success is won all time will be put away.</P>
<P>For five years and sixty thousand miles</P>
<P>Do not let the holy water dry up,</P>
<P>Do not allow the fire to flag.</P>
<P>When water and fire are in balance no harm will arise;</P>
<P>The Five Elements are joined as if with hooks.</P>
<P>Ying and Yang in harmony climb the cloud tower,</P>
<P>Riding the phoenix to the purple palace,</P>
<P>And flying on the crane to magical Yingzhou.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This lyric is set to the tune<I> Lin jiang xian.</I> It tells how Tang Sanzang and his disciples with the help of water and fire cooled their natures and borrowed the fan that was pure Yin to blow out the flames on the distant mountains. It took them many days to cover the 250 miles as they made their way West feeling relaxed and free of care. It was now the time when late autumn was becoming early winter, and this is what they saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The petals of wild chrysanthemums wilting,</P>
<P>The tender new blossom of the plum.</P>
<P>In all the villages crops are gathered in;</P>
<P>Delicious broth is everywhere enjoyed.</P>
<P>As the trees are stripped of leaves distant forests can be seen;</P>
<P>Ravines are thickly frosted and the quiet valleys pure.</P>
<P>In response to the cold season</P>
<P>The silkworms are put away to hibernate.</P>
<P>In pure Yin and Yang</P>
<P>The moon rules over the primal ocean;</P>
<P>Where water is at the full</P>
<P>Shun's sun shines with merciful brightness.</P>
<P>Earth vapors sink,</P>
<P>Sky vapors rise.</P>
<P>The rainbow is no more to be seen,</P>
<P>While slowly ice forms over the pond.</P>
<P>Flowers fall from the creepers on the cliff,</P>
<P>While bamboo and pine show still greener in the cold.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When the four of them had traveled a lot further they approached a walled and moated city. Reining in the horse the Tang Priest spoke to his disciples: &#8220;Wukong, what sort of place is that with all those tall and magnificent buildings?&#8221; Monkey looked and saw that the city was like this:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A wall of bronze, shaped like a dragon,</P>
<P>And in the form of a crouching tiger,</P>
<P>From all directions fine carriages approach</P>
<P>And many a wheel has smoothed the roads to it.</P>
<P>Amazing beasts are carved on the balustrades of marble;</P>
<P>Statues of great men stand on pedestals of gold.</P>
<P>This is indeed a blessed capital,</P>
<P>A true metropolis.</P>
<P>Its vast domains are firmly held;</P>
<P>The dynasty has flourished for a thousand years.</P>
<P>To the monarch's goodness the barbarians submit;</P>
<P>Here is the holy gathering from islands and from sea.</P>
<P>Before the palace steps is purity;</P>
<P>Peace reigns on the highways.</P>
<P>The bars are full of noise and song;</P>
<P>Bliss is found in the houses of pleasure.</P>
<P>Outside the palace grow trees of eternal spring</P>
<P>Where phoenixes sing their greetings to the dawn.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;that city is a royal capital.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;The world is full of prefectural cities and county seats,&#8221; laughed Pig. &#8220;What makes you so sure that this is a royal capital?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You don't seem to realize that royal capitals are different from prefectural cities and county towns,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;Just look. It's got over ten gates and the wall must measure twenty or thirty miles around. Those towers are so high they disappear into the clouds. How could anything except a royal capital be as grand as that?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You're right, brother,&#8221; said Friar Sand, &#8220;it is a royal city. But what's it called?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How can I tell?&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;There aren't any signs or banners. We'll have to go into it and ask.&#8221;</P>
<P>The venerable elder whipped on his horse and was soon at a gate, where he dismounted to cross the bridge and go in to look. They saw the six main streets and the three markets, where commerce was flourishing, as well as the imposing clothes of the noble and great. Then as they were walking along they saw a dozen or so Buddhist monks in chains and cangues, heavy boards locked round their necks, begging from door to door. They were dressed in rags.</P>
<P>&#8220;The fox mourns for the death of the hare,&#8221; sighed Sanzang. &#8220;All things are sorry for their own kind. Go and ask them, Wukong, why they are being punished like that.&#8221;</P>
<P>Doing as he had been told, Monkey asked, &#8220;What monastery are you from, monks? Why are you in cangues and chains?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; said the monks, all falling to their knees, &#8220;we are from the Golden Light Monastery and we have been wronged.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where is the Golden Light Monastery?&#8221; Monkey asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Just round the corner,&#8221; they replied.</P>
<P>Monkey led them to the Tang Priest and asked them, &#8220;How have you been wronged? Tell me.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We don't know where you're from, but you look a little familiar to us, my lords,&#8221; the monks replied. &#8220;We don't dare talk here. Please come to our poor monastery where we can tell you our woes.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the venerable elder, &#8220;we shall go to their monastery and ask them all the details.&#8221; They went with them to the monastery gate, over which was a board on which was written in letters of gold</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>NATION-PROTECTING GOLDEN LIGHT MONASTERY</P>
<P>FOUNDED BY ROYAL COMMAND</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When master and disciples went inside to look around this is what they saw:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Cold were the lamps in the ancient hall;</P>
<P>Wind blew the leaves along deserted cloisters.</P>
<P>A thousand-foot pagoda touched the clouds;</P>
<P>Pine trees grew to nourish the nature.</P>
<P>Fallen blooms carpeted the unvisited grounds;</P>
<P>Spiders span cobwebs all over the eaves.</P>
<P>The drum-stand was empty,</P>
<P>The bell hung in vain,</P>
<P>And the frescoes could barely be seen through the dust.</P>
<P>Still was the pulpit where no priest could be seen,</P>
<P>Silent the dhyana hall except for the birds.</P>
<P>The desolation made one long to sigh;</P>
<P>Its dreariness caused great pain.</P>
<P>Although an incense burner stood before the Buddha</P>
<P>All was cold ash, withered flowers and desolation.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>All this made Sanzang miserable, and he could not help his tears flowing. The monks in their cangues and chains pushed open the doors of the main Buddha-hall and invited him to step inside and worship the Buddha. Sanzang entered, offered the incense of his heart and said the recitation three times. Then he turned round again to see six or seven young monks locked to the pillars outside the abbot's lodgings. It was more than he could bear.</P>
<P>When he entered the abbot's lodgings and all the monks came to kowtow to him they asked, &#8220;You reverend gentlemen look rather different. Are you from Great Tang in the East?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You must have second sight,&#8221; Monkey said with a laugh. &#8220;We are indeed, but how could you tell?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We don't have second sight, my lords,&#8221; the monks replied. &#8220;It's just that because we're so distressed at the injustice we've suffered and because there's nowhere else we can turn, we have been calling on heaven and earth for days on end. Some heavenly deity must have been moved by us because last night we all had the same dream. We were told that a holy monk was coming from Great Tang in the East who would save our lives and right our wrongs. We knew who you were today because you looked rather unusual.&#8221;</P>
<P>This pleased Sanzang greatly. &#8220;What country is this, and what injustice have you suffered?&#8221; he asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; said the monks on their knees, &#8220;this country is called Jisai, and it's one of the biggest in the West. In the old days the foreign states all around used to send tribute: Yuetuo in the South, Gaochang to the North, Western Liang in the East, and Benbo to the West. Every year they used to offer fine jade, bright pearls, beautiful women and magnificent horses. We never had to resort to arms or send expeditions against them: they naturally acknowledged us as their suzerain.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;If they did that your king must understand the Way and your civil and military officials be wise and good,&#8221; Sanzang said.</P>
<P>&#8220;My lord,&#8221; the monks replied to Sanzang's question, &#8220;our country's civil officials are not wise, our generals are not good, and our monarch does not understand the Way. Auspicious clouds used to gather round the pagoda of our monastery and mists of good omen rose high above it. The glow above it at night could once be seen from thousands of miles away; the coloured vapors were admired by the countries all around. That was why this was a divinely-appointed capital to which all the foreigners sent tribute. But three years ago at midnight on the first day of the first month of autumn it rained blood. The next morning everyone was terrified and miserable. All the ministers submitted a memorial to the throne: they didn't understand why heaven was so angry with us. Taoists were asked to perform purifications and Buddhist monks to recite sutras as an offering to heaven and earth. Goodness only knows why, but our golden pagoda has been contaminated, and for the last two years no foreign countries have sent tribute. Our king wanted to send armies to punish them, but the officials said that the reason why foreign countries weren't sending tribute was that the auspicious clouds and mists of good omen had disappeared, and this was because we monks had stolen the treasure from the pagoda in our monastery. The stupid king did not investigate, and those corrupt officials had all us monks arrested. We have been beaten and tortured in every possible way. There used to be three generations of us monks in this monastery, but the two older generations both died off because they couldn't take the beating and torture. Now we've been arrested and made to wear these cangues and chains. Your Honour, we could never be so wicked as to steal the treasure from the pagoda. We implore you to take pity on your fellows and in your great mercy and compassion make wide use of your dharma powers and save our lives.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this Sanzang nodded and said with a sigh, &#8220;This is an obscure business that will be hard to sort out. The court is ruling badly, and you are suffering a calamity. If it was the rain of blood that contaminated your pagoda why did you not report the fact to your king at the time? Instead you let yourselves in for this calamity.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We are only common mortals, your lordship, and had no way-of telling what heaven had in mind. Besides, our elders didn't understand. What could we be expected to do about it?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What's the time, Wukong?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;About four in the afternoon,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;I would like to see the king to present our passport,&#8221; Sanzang said, &#8220;but I cannot solve these monks' problem and report on it to His Majesty. When I left Chang'an I made a vow in the Famen Monastery that on my journey West I would burn incense at every temple I passed, worship the Buddha in every monastery I came across, and sweep every pagoda I saw. Today I have met these monks who have been wronged on account of their pagoda. Will you get me a new broom while I take a bath? I shall then go up to sweep it and find out what has contaminated it and why it does not gleam any longer. Once I have found out the truth it will be much easier to report on it in person to the king and rescue them from their misery.&#8221;</P>
<P>As soon as the monks in cangues and chains heard this they hurried to the kitchen to fetch a big vegetable chopper that they handed to Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;Take this chopper, your lordship,&#8221; they said, &#8220;and cut through the iron locks holding the young monks to the pillars so that they can prepare you some food and tea and wait on your master while he eats and bathes. Meanwhile we shall go out on the streets again to beg for a new broom for your master to sweep the pagoda with.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;There's no problem about opening locks,&#8221; laughed Pig. &#8220;We don't need knives or axes. Just ask the hairy-faced gentleman: he's been opening locks for years.&#8221; Monkey then stepped forward and used lock-opening magic: one touch and the locks all fell open. The young monks all ran into the kitchen to clean up the cooking pots and stove and prepare the meal. When Sanzang and his disciples had eaten and it was gradually getting dark the monks in cangues and chains came in with two brooms to Sanzang's great delight.</P>
<P>As they were talking a young monk came in to light the lamp and invite Sanzang to take his bath. By now the sky was bright with the moon and the stars, and from the look-out towers the watches of the night were being beaten out on the drum. It was indeed the time when</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Cold breezes blow around the walls,</P>
<P>And lamps are lit in every house.</P>
<P>Along the streets all the doors are shut;</P>
<P>The gates of the three markets are all closed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The fishing boat is sheltered under the trees;</P>
<P>The ploughing ox is let off its rope.</P>
<P>The woodman gives his axe a rest,</P>
<P>While the schoolboy can be heard reciting his lessons.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Sanzang had bathed he put on a narrow-sleeved tunic, tightened the belt around his waist, put on a pair of boots, and took the new brooms. &#8220;You sleep here while I sweep the pagoda,&#8221; he said to the monks.</P>
<P>&#8220;The pagoda was contaminated by the rain of blood,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;and it hasn't shone for many a long day. There may be evil things living up there. If you go up by yourself on this cold and windy night I'm worried that something might go wrong. Why don't I go with you?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very good idea,&#8221; Sanzang replied, and each carrying a broom they first went up into the main Buddha hall, where Sanzang lit the glazed lamp, burned incense, and bowed to the Buddha saying, &#8220;Your disciple Chen Xuanzang has been sent by the Great Tang in the East to worship out Tathagata Buddha on Vulture Peak and fetch the scriptures. I have now reached the Golden Light Monastery in the kingdom of Jisai, where the monks tell me that their pagoda has been contaminated and that they have been unjustly punished because the king suspects them of having stolen the treasure. Your disciple is now going devoutly to sweep the tower in the hope that my Buddha in his great responsiveness will reveal the cause of the contamination and spare these folk from injustice.&#8221;</P>
<P>When he had prayed he and Brother Monkey opened the door of the pagoda and began to sweep it from the ground upwards. That pagoda</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Towered to the stars,</P>
<P>Thrust up into space.</P>
<P>It was called the glazed tile pagoda,</P>
<P>The golden sarira spire.</P>
<P>The stairway spiraled like the inside of a cave;</P>
<P>The door seemed to be the door of a coop.</P>
<P>The gleam of the vase reached the moon at the horizon;</P>
<P>The sea breeze carried the sound of its bells.</P>
<P>Look at the eaves and corbel brackets,</P>
<P>The finial in the clouds.</P>
<P>The eaves and corbel brackets</P>
<P>Were of masonry through which the scented breezes blew.</P>
<P>The finial in the clouds</P>
<P>Had mist dragons coiling around the pagoda.</P>
<P>The view stretched out for hundreds of miles;</P>
<P>To climb it was to climb to the heavens.</P>
<P>At the doors of every story were set glazed lamps,</P>
<P>But full of dust, not light.</P>
<P>All around under the eaves ran marble balustrades,</P>
<P>Covered with filth and insects.</P>
<P>Inside the tower,</P>
<P>By the Buddha statues,</P>
<P>Incense no longer burned.</P>
<P>Outside the windows,</P>
<P>In front of the divine face,</P>
<P>Cobwebs covered all.</P>
<P>The incense-burners were full of mouse-droppings,</P>
<P>The lamps untouched by oil.</P>
<P>Because the treasure had been spirited away</P>
<P>Many a monk had died for nothing.</P>
<P>Sanzang was determined to sweep out the pagoda</P>
<P>And restore to it the beauty that it had before.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When he had swept one story the Tang Priest went on to sweep the next, and so he continued till he reached the seventh story. By now it was the second watch of the night and he was beginning to feel exhausted.</P>
<P>&#8220;You're tired,&#8221; Monkey said. &#8220;Sit here and let me sweep it for you.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;How many stories does it have?&#8221; Sanzang asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;About thirteen I suppose,&#8221; Monkey replied. Overcoming his weariness the Tang Priest said, &#8220;I must sweep it myself to fulfil the vow.&#8221; By the time he had swept another three stories his back and his legs were aching. At the tenth he collapsed and said, &#8220;Sweep the last three floors for me, Wukong.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey summoned up his energy, went to the eleventh floor, and a moment later up to the twelfth. As he was sweeping there he heard voices from in the roof. &#8220;That's odd,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;Very odd indeed. It's the third watch. They can't be people talking up there as late as this. I'm sure it's evil spirits. Let's have a look.&#8221;</P>
<P>The splendid Monkey King put his broom quietly under his arm, tucked up his clothes, slipped out through the door, and stepped on a cloud to take a better look. Sitting in the middle of the thirteenth story were two evil spirits with a dish of food, a bowl, and a jug of wine. They were playing the finger-guessing game and drinking.</P>
<P>Monkey used his magic powers to get rid of the broom and bring out his gold-banded cudgel, with which he barricaded the entrance to the pagoda and shouted, &#8220;So you're the ones who stole the pagoda's treasure, you monsters.&#8221; The two of them jumped up in their panic, grabbed the jug and bowl, and flung them at him. Monkey deflected them with his iron cudgel and said, &#8220;I won't kill you because I need you to give evidence.&#8221;</P>
<P>He just used his cudgel to force them to talk. The devils were pinned against the wall, unable to struggle or even move. All they could do was to repeat, &#8220;Spare us, spare us. It was nothing to do with us. The thief isn't here.&#8221;</P>
<P>Monkey used holding magic to carry them single-handed down to the tenth story, where he said, &#8220;Master, I've got the thieves.&#8221;</P>
<P>This news woke up Sanzang, who had been dozing, with a start of pleasure. &#8220;Where did you catch them?&#8221; he asked.</P>
<P>Dragging the demons over and forcing them to kneel to his master Monkey replied, &#8220;They were drinking and playing finger-guessing up in the roof. When I heard the din they were making I shot up by cloud to the roof and blocked their escape. I wasn't rough with them because I was worried that a single blow would kill them and we'd have nobody to give evidence. That's why I brought them here nice and gently. You can take statements from them, Master, and find out where they're from and where the stolen treasure has been hidden.&#8221;</P>
<P>The demons were still shivering and shaking and saying, &#8220;Spare us!&#8221; Then they made this true statement. &#8220;We were sent by the Infinitely Sage Dragon King of the Green Wave Pool on the Ragged Rock Mountain. His name's Benborba and mine is Baborben. He's catfish spirit and I'm a snakehead fish spirit. Our Infinitely Sage Ancient Dragon has a daughter called the Infinitely Sage Princess. She is as lovely as flowers or the moon and brilliant as well. The Ancient Dragon got a husband for her who would live in the palace. He has tremendous magic powers and he's called Prince Ninehead. He came here the other year with the dragon king to demonstrate his powers by making a blood rain that contaminated the pagoda and stealing the precious sarira relic of the Buddha. The princess then went up to the Daluo Heaven and stole the Queen Mother's nine-lobed magic fungus plant from in front of the Hall of Miraculous Mist. We keep it at the bottom of the pool, and it shines day and night with golden light and a coloured glow. Recently we've heard that Sun Wukong is on his way to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven. They say his powers are enormous, and that all along the way he has been looking out for wrongs to right. That's why we keep getting sent here to patrol and stop him when the comes. If that Sun Wukong turns up we're ready for him.&#8221;</P>
<P>At this Monkey gave a mocking laugh. &#8220;What an evil beast,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He's unspeakable. No wonder he invited the Bull Demon King to his place for a banquet the other day. He's been extending his contacts among all these damned demons because he's up to no good.&#8221;</P>
<P>Before he had finished speaking Pig and two or three of the young monks came up the steps from the bottom of the pagoda with lanterns.</P>
<P>&#8220;Master,&#8221; Pig said, &#8220;why don't you go to bed now that you've swept the pagoda instead of staying here talking?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;You've come at just the right moment, brother,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;The pagoda's treasure was stolen by the Infinitely Sage Ancient Dragon. He sent these two little devils I've just captured to patrol the pagoda and keep their ears open for news of us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What are they called, and what sort of spirits are they?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;They've just confessed everything,&#8221; Monkey replied. &#8220;This one's called Benborba and he's a catfish spirit, and that one's Baborben and he's a snakehead fish spirit.&#8221; Pig then lifted his rake to strike them.</P>
<P>&#8220;If they're evil spirits and they've already confessed,&#8221; he said, &#8220;what are we waiting for? Let's kill them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;you don't understand. Keep them alive so that they can tell it all to the king and lead us to catch the thieves and get the treasure back.&#8221; The splendid idiot then put his rake down again. He and Monkey each carried one of them down the stairs.</P>
<P>&#8220;Spare us,&#8221; the demons kept pleading.</P>
<P>&#8220;I'd like to turn you two fish into soup for those monks who've been mistreated so unjustly,&#8221; muttered Pig.</P>
<P>The two or three young monks, who were thoroughly delighted, led the venerable elder down the pagoda stairs with their lanterns. One of them ran ahead to tell the other monks.</P>
<P>&#8220;Good news,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;good news! Our troubles are over. The reverend gentlemen have caught the evil spirits who stole the treasure.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Fetch chains,&#8221; Monkey said, &#8220;run them through their shoulder-bones, and lock them up here. Watch over them while we get some sleep. We'll decide what to do next tomorrow.&#8221; The monks then kept a very close watch on the demons while Sanzang and his disciples slept.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Before they knew it it was dawn. &#8220;Wukong and I will go to court to present the passport,&#8221; Sanzang said, and he put on his brocade cassock and Vairocana mitre. When he was dressed in his majestic vestments he strode forward, accompanied by Monkey, who had tightened his tigerskin kilt and straightened up his tunic and was carrying the passport.</P>
<P>&#8220;Why aren't you taking those two demons with you?&#8221; Pig asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;We'll submit a memorial to the throne first,&#8221; Monkey replied, &#8220;then I expect the king will send men for them.&#8221; They then went to the palace gates, seeing no end of red birds and golden dragons adorning the deep red gateways of the pure capital.</P>
<P>At the Gate of Eastern Splendor Sanzang bowed to the officer in charge and said, &#8220;May I trouble Your Honour to report that a monk sent from Great Tang in the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven begs an audience with His Majesty to present his passport?&#8221;</P>
<P>The gate officer did indeed make this report, going to the steps of the throne to say, &#8220;There are two Buddhist monks with strange faces and strange clothes outside who say they have been sent by the Tang court in the East of the Southern Continent of Jambu to go to the West to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures. They request an audience with Your Majesty in order to present their passport.&#8221; The king then sent for them.</P>
<P>As the Tang Priest took him into the palace all the civilian and military officials were alarmed at the sight of Monkey. Some called him the monkey monk, and others the thunder-god monk; they were all too terrified to look at him for very long. The Tang Priest bowed to the king with a dance and a loud chant of obeisance, while the Great Sage stood leaning to one side with his arms crossed, not moving.</P>
<P>The venerable elder then submitted this memorial: &#8220;I am a priest who has been sent by the Great Tang in the East of the Southern Continent of Jambu to worship the Buddha and fetch the true scriptures in Thunder Monastery in the land of India in the West. As my route lies across your distinguished country I would not dare cross without authorization, and I beg you to verify the passport I have with me and allow me to proceed.&#8221;</P>
<P>The king was very pleased to hear all this, so he summoned the holy priest from Tang to the throne hall, where an embroidered stool was set for him to sit on. Sanzang went into the hall by himself and handed over the passport before gratefully accepting the courtesy stool.</P>
<P>When the king read the passport through he was delighted. &#8220;It appears that when your Great Tang emperor was ill he could choose an eminent monk who would not flinch from a long journey to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures. But all the monks in our country want to do is to steal, thus destroying the country and ruining their sovereign.&#8221;</P>
<P>When Sanzang heard this he put his hands together and replied, &#8220;How can you be so sure they are destroying the country and ruining their sovereign?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This country of ours is the leading one in the Western Regions. The foreign states all around always used to send tribute because of the golden pagoda in the Golden Light Monastery in this capital. A multicolored glow used to shine from the pagoda right up to the sky. But recently the pagoda's treasure has been stolen by the wicked monks in the monastery, and for three years now there has been no coloured glow and no tribute from the foreigners. It is all extremely upsetting for us.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Your Majesty,&#8221; said Sanzang, smiling as he put his hands together in front of his chest, &#8220;a little mistake can lead to a great disaster. Soon after entering the gates of your heavenly capital yesterday I saw a dozen or so monks in cangues. When I asked them why they told me that they were from the Golden Light Monastery and were the victims of injustice. On close investigation in the monastery I found that it was no fault of the monks there. When I swept the pagoda in the middle of the night I captured the thieving devils who had stolen the treasure.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are they?&#8221; asked the delighted king.</P>
<P>&#8220;My disciples have them locked up in the Golden Light Monastery,&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>The king ordered royal guards to be sent at once to the Golden Light Monastery to fetch the thieving devils so that he could interrogate them himself. &#8220;Your Majesty, I think it would be best if my disciple went with the guards.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221; the king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;Standing by the steps of the throne,&#8221; Sanzang replied.</P>
<P>The king was shocked by what he saw. &#8220;How can your disciple be so ugly when you, reverend sir, are so handsome?&#8221; he asked.</P>
<P>When he heard this the Great Sage Sun shouted at the top of his voice, &#8220;Your Majesty, you should no more judge people by their faces than you'd measure the sea with a bucket. Good looks would never have captured the thieving devils.&#8221;</P>
<P>This calmed the king's alarm, and he said, &#8220;You are right, holy monk. We do not know how to select men of talent here. The ones who catch the thieves and recover the treasure are best.&#8221; He then ordered his aides to have a carriage prepared and told the royal guards to look after the holy monk as he went to fetch the thieving devils. The aides had a large palanquin with a yellow canopy got ready in which eight guardsmen carried Monkey with eight more as escorts who shouted to clear the way to the Golden Light Monastery. By now the whole city had heard the news; everyone came out to see the holy monk and the thieving devils.</P>
<P>Hearing the shouts Pig and Friar Sand, imagining that the king must have sent some of his officials, hurried out to meet them, only to see Monkey riding in the palanquin. &#8220;Now you're yourself again, brother,&#8221; laughed Pig.</P>
<P>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; Monkey asked, putting his hand on Pig to steady himself as he stepped out of the chair.</P>
<P>&#8220;There you are, being carried by eight men in a carrying chair under a royal yellow canopy,&#8221; said Pig. &#8220;Isn't that the way the Handsome Monkey King should travel? That's why I said you're yourself again.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Stop joking,&#8221; said Monkey, who then had the two devils brought for him to escort to the king.</P>
<P>&#8220;Won't you take me along too?&#8221; Friar Sand asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;You stay here and look after the luggage and the horse,&#8221; Monkey replied.</P>
<P>&#8220;My lords,&#8221; said the monks in cangues and chains, &#8220;why don't you all go to see His Majesty? We can look after your things here.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;In that case we'll all go to report to the king,&#8221; said Monkey, &#8220;and then have you released.&#8221; With Pig manhandling one devil and Friar Sand the other, Monkey got back into the palanquin, and led the devils to the court.</P>
<P>They were soon at the steps of the throne hall, where the king was told that the devils had arrived. He came down from his dragon throne to examine them with the Tang Priest and his civil and military officials. One of the devils had bulging cheeks, black scales, a pointed mouth and sharp teeth. The other had slimy skin, a fat belly, a big mouth and long whiskers. Although they had legs and could walk it was obvious that they had only assumed a certain appearance of humanity through transformation.</P>
<P>&#8220;Where are you from, you thieving devils, you evil spirits?&#8221; the king asked. &#8220;How long have you been preying on this country? Which year did you steal our treasure? How many of you bandits are there? What are your names? I want it all, and I want the truth.&#8221; The two devils fell to their knees before him, and although blood was gushing from their necks they did not feel the pain. This was what they had to say:</P>
<P>&#8220;Three years ago, on the first day of the seventh month, the Infinitely Sage Dragon King brought a crowd of his relations to live in the Southeast corner of this country, in the Green Wave Pool on Ragged Rock Mountain about forty miles from here. He has an extremely attractive daughter for whom he found a husband to live in our palace, Prince Ninehead. His magic powers are unbeatable. He knew that you had a rare treasure in your tower, so he plotted with the dragon king to steal it. First he made it rain blood and then he stole the Buddha relic. Now it lights up the dragon palace, which is as bright as day even in the darkest night. Then the princess used her powers to sneak up and steal the Queen Mother's magic fungus to keep the treasure warm in the pool. We two aren't the bandit chiefs. We're just private soldiers sent here by the dragon king who were captured last night. This is the truth.&#8221;</P>

<P>&#8220;As you have made this confession,&#8221; the king said, &#8220;why don't you tell me your names?&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;I am Benborba,&#8221; one of them replied, &#8220;and he is Baborben. I am a catfish monster and he is a snakehead monster.&#8221;</P>
<P>The king then told the royal guards to keep them safely behind bars and ordered, &#8220;Release all the monks of the Golden Light Monastery from their cangues and chains, and have the Office of Foreign Affairs prepare a banquet in the Unicom Hall to congratulate the holy monks on their great achievements in catching the thieves. We shall now invite them to capture the ringleaders.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Office of Foreign Affairs then laid on a double banquet of both meat and vegetarian food, for which the king invited Sanzang and his disciples to take their places in the Unicorn Hall.</P>
<P>&#8220;May I ask your title, holy monk?&#8221; he said to Sanzang, who replied, his hands together, &#8220;My lay surname is Chen, and my Buddhist name Xuanzang. My emperor granted me the surname Tang and the title Sanzang.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;What are your disciple's titles?&#8221; the king asked.</P>
<P>&#8220;They do not have titles,&#8221; Sanzang replied. &#8220;The senior one is called Sun Wukong, the second one Zhu Wuneng, and the third Sha Wujing. These were the names the Bodhisattva Guanyin of the Southern Sea gave them. When they became my disciples I called Wukong Sun the Novice, Wuneng Bajie and Wujing Friar Sand.&#8221;</P>
<P>The king then asked Sanzang to take the place of honour while Monkey sat at his left and Pig and Friar Sand at his right. Their banquet was all vegetarian: fruit, vegetables, tea and rice. In front of them was a table of meat dishes at which sat the king, and below him were a hundred or more tables set with meat dishes for all the civil and military officials. The officials all thanked the king for his kindness, and the disciples sat down with the permission of their master. When all were seated the king raised his goblet, and though Sanzang would not drink his three disciples all drank to the success of the banquet. Woodwinds and strings then began to sound as the court musicians performed.</P>
<P>Just watch Pig as he eats for all he is worth, gobbling his food down whole like a tiger or a wolf and emptying the table. Soon more soup and food was brought, only to disappear in the same way. Every time servants brought more wine he drained the cup, never refusing. The feast went on till after midday before it broke up.</P>
<P>When Sanzang expressed his thanks for the sumptuous banquet the king wanted to keep him longer. &#8220;It was just a gesture to thank you holy monks for catching the demons.&#8221; He then ordered the Office of Foreign Affairs to move the banquet to the Jianzhang Palace so that he could discuss with the holy monks how the ringleaders were to be captured and the treasure brought back to the pagoda.</P>
<P>&#8220;If we are to capture the thieves and recover the treasure,&#8221; Sanzang said, &#8220;another banquet won't be needed. We shall take our leave of Your Majesty now and set off to catch the demons.&#8221;</P>
<P>But the king insisted on taking them to the Jianzhang Palace for another banquet. &#8220;Which of you holy monks will lead the force that is to capture the monsters?&#8221; he asked, raising his goblet.</P>
<P>&#8220;Send my senior disciple Sun Wukong,&#8221; Sanzang replied. The Great Sage raised his clasped hands and bowed in acknowledgement.</P>
<P>&#8220;If the venerable Sun is going how big a force of cavalry and foot will he need,&#8221; the king asked, &#8220;and when will he be setting out?&#8221;</P>
<P>At this Pig could not restrain himself from shouting, &#8220;We won't need any soldiers, and we don't care when we go. With a good meal and a few drinks inside us he and I can go and catch them right now, just by laying our hands on them.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Bajie,&#8221; said Sanzang with delight, &#8220;you're getting very keen.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Very well then,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;Friar Sand, you guard the master while we two go.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;Even if you two venerable elders don't need troops,&#8221; the king said, &#8220;surely you need weapons.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;We don't need your weapons,&#8221; laughed Pig. &#8220;We carry our own.&#8221; On hearing this the king fetched two huge goblets and drank a toast to them on their journey.</P>
<P>&#8220;We won't have any more to drink,&#8221; said Monkey. &#8220;But we'd like the royal guards to bring those little demons to us. We need them as guides.&#8221; The king gave the order and they were brought out at once. Then Monkey and Pig, each firmly grasping a demon, rode the wind and used carrying magic to take them off to the Southeast. Indeed:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Only when king and court saw the magical clouds</P>
<P>Did they realize that the four of them were truly holy monks.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>If you don't know how the capture went and what they found, listen to the explanation in the next installment.</P>

<p>十二时中忘不得，行功百刻全收。五年十万八千周，休教神水涸，莫纵火光愁。水火调停无损处，五行联络如钩。阴阳和合上云楼，乘鸾登紫府，跨鹤赴瀛洲。这一篇词，牌名《临江仙》。单道唐三藏师徒四众，水火既济，本性清凉，借得纯阴宝扇，扇息燥火过山，不一日行过了八百之程，师徒们散诞逍遥，向西而去，正值秋末冬初时序，见了些：野菊残英落，新梅嫩蕊生。村村纳禾稼，处处食香羹。平林木落远山现，曲涧霜浓幽壑清。应锺气，闭蛰营，纯阴阳，月帝玄溟，盛水德，舜日怜晴。</p>

<p>地气下降，天气上升。虹藏不见影，池沼渐生冰。悬崖挂索藤花败，松竹凝寒色更青。四众行彀多时，前又遇城池相近。唐僧勒住马叫徒弟：“悟空，你看那厢楼阁峥嵘，是个甚么去处？”</p>

<p>行者抬头观看，乃是一座城池。真个是：龙蟠形势，虎踞金城。</p>

<p>四垂华盖近，百转紫墟平。玉石桥栏排巧兽，黄金台座列贤明。</p>

<p>真个是神洲都会，天府瑶京。万里邦畿固，千年帝业隆。蛮夷拱服君恩远，海岳朝元圣会盈。御阶洁净，辇路清宁。酒肆歌声闹，花楼喜气生。未央宫外长春树，应许朝阳彩凤鸣。</p>

<p>行者道：“师父，那座城池，是一国帝王之所。”八戒笑道：</p>

<p>“天下府有府城，县有县城，怎么就见是帝王之所？”行者道：</p>

<p>“你不知帝王之居，与府县自是不同。你看他四面有十数座门，周围有百十余里，楼台高耸，云雾缤纷。非帝京邦国，何以有此壮丽？”沙僧道：“哥哥眼明，虽识得是帝王之处，却唤做甚么名色？”行者道：“又无牌匾旌号，何以知之？须到城中询问，方可知也。”长老策马，须臾到门。下马过桥，进门观看，只见六街三市，货殖通财，又见衣冠隆盛，人物豪华。正行时，忽见有十数个和尚，一个个披枷戴锁，沿门乞化，着实的蓝缕不堪。三藏叹曰：“兔死狐悲，物伤其类。”叫：“悟空，你上前去问他一声，为何这等遭罪？”行者依言，即叫：“那和尚，你是那寺里的？为甚事披枷戴锁？”众僧跪倒道：“爷爷，我等是金光寺负屈的和尚。”行者道：“金光寺坐落何方？”众僧道：“转过隅头就是。”行者将他带在唐僧前，问道：“怎生负屈，你说我听。”众僧道：“爷爷，不知你们是那方来的，我等似有些面善。此问不敢在此奉告，请到荒山，具说苦楚。”长老道：“也是，我们且到他那寺中去，仔细询问缘由。”同至山门，门上横写七个金字：“敕建护国金光寺”。师徒们进得门来观看，但见那：古殿香灯冷，虚廊叶扫风。凌云千尺塔，养性几株松。满地落花无客过，檐前蛛网任攀笼。空架鼓，枉悬钟，绘壁尘多彩象朦。讲座幽然僧不见，禅堂静矣鸟常逢。凄凉堪叹息，寂寞苦无穷。佛前虽有香炉设，灰冷花残事事空。三藏心酸，止不住眼中出泪。众僧们顶着枷锁，将正殿推开，请长老上殿拜佛。长老进殿，奉上心香，叩齿三咂。却转于后面，见那方丈檐柱上又锁着六七个小和尚，三藏甚不忍见。及到方丈，众僧俱来叩头问道：“列位老爷象貌不一，可是东土大唐来的么？”行者笑道：“这和尚有甚未卜先知之法？我们正是。你怎么认得？”众僧道：“爷爷，我等有甚未卜先知之法，只是痛负了屈苦，无处分明，日逐家只是叫天叫地。</p>

<p>想是惊动天神，昨日夜间，各人都得一梦，说有个东土大唐来的圣僧，救得我等性命，庶此冤苦可伸。今日果见老爷这般异象。故认得也。”三藏闻言大喜道：“你这里是何地方？有何冤屈？”众僧跪告：“爷爷，此城名唤祭赛国，乃西邦大去处。当年有四夷朝贡：南月陀国，北高昌国，东西梁国，西本钵国，年年进贡美玉明珠，娇妃骏马。我这里不动干戈，不去征讨，他那里自然拜为上邦。”三藏道：“既拜为上邦，想是你这国王有道，文武贤良。”众僧道：“爷爷，文也不贤，武也不良，国君也不是有道。我这金光寺，自来宝塔上祥云笼罩，瑞霭高升，夜放霞光，万里有人曾见；昼喷彩气，四国无不同瞻。故此以为天府神京，四夷朝贡。只是三年之前，孟秋朔日，夜半子时，下了一场血雨。天明时，家家害怕，户户生悲。众公卿奏上国王，不知天公甚事见责。当时延请道士打醮，和尚看经，答天谢地。谁晓得我这寺里黄金宝塔污了，这两年外国不来朝贡。我王欲要征伐，众臣谏道：“我寺里僧人偷了塔上宝贝，所以无祥云瑞霭，外国不朝。”昏君更不察理，那些赃官，将我僧众拿了去，千般拷打，万样追求。当时我这里有三辈和尚，前两辈已被拷打不过死了，如今又捉我辈问罪枷锁。老爷在上，我等怎敢欺心盗取塔中之宝！万望爷爷怜念，方以类聚，物以群分，舍大慈大悲，广施法力，拯救我等性命！”</p>

<p>三藏闻言，点头叹道：“这桩事暗昧难明。一则是朝廷失政，二来是汝等有灾。既然天降血雨，污了宝塔，那时节何不启本奏君，致令受苦？”众僧道：“爷爷，我等凡人，怎知天意？况前辈俱未辨得，我等如何处之！”三藏道：“悟空，今日甚时分了？”</p>

<p>行者道：“有申时前后。”三藏道：“我欲面君倒换关文，奈何这众僧之事，不得明白，难以对君奏言。我当时离了长安，在法门寺里立愿：上西方逢庙烧香，遇寺拜佛，见塔扫塔。今日至此，遇有受屈僧人，乃因宝塔之累。你与我办一把新笤帚，待我沐浴了，上去扫扫，即看这污秽之事何如，不放光之故何如，访着端的，方好面君奏言，解救他们这苦难也。”这些枷锁的和尚听说，连忙去厨房取把厨刀，递与八戒道：“爷爷，你将此刀打开那柱子上锁的小和尚铁锁，放他去安排斋饭香汤，伏侍老爷进斋沐浴。我等且上街化把新笤帚来与老爷扫塔。”八戒笑道：</p>

<p>“开锁有何难哉？不用刀斧，教我那一位毛脸老爷，他是开锁的积年。”行者真个近前，使个解锁法，用手一抹，几把锁俱退落下。那小和尚俱跑到厨中，净刷锅灶，安排茶饭。三藏师徒们吃了斋，渐渐天昏，只见那枷锁的和尚，拿了两把笤帚进来，三藏甚喜。</p>

<p>正说处，一个小和尚点了灯，来请洗澡。此时满天星月光辉，谯楼上更鼓齐发，正是那：四壁寒风起，万家灯火明。六街关户牖，三市闭门庭。钓艇归深树，耕犁罢短绳。樵夫柯斧歇，学子诵书声。三藏沐浴毕，穿了小袖褊衫，束了环绦，足下换一双软公鞋，手里拿一把新笤帚，对众僧道：“你等安寝，待我扫塔去来。”行者道：“塔上既被血雨所污，又况日久无光，恐生恶物，一则夜静风寒，又没个伴侣，自去恐有差池，老孙与你同上如何？”三藏道：“甚好！甚好！”两人各持一把，先到大殿上，点起琉璃灯，烧了香，佛前拜道：“弟子陈玄奘奉东土大唐差往灵山参见我佛如来取经，今至祭赛国金光寺，遇本僧言宝塔被污，国王疑僧盗宝，衔冤取罪，上下难明。弟子竭诚扫塔，望我佛威灵，早示污塔之原因，莫致凡夫之冤屈。”祝罢，与行者开了塔门，自下层望上而扫。只见这塔，真是峥嵘倚汉，突兀凌空。正唤做五色琉璃塔，千金舍利峰。梯转如穿窟，门开似出笼。宝瓶影射天边月，金铎声传海上风。但见那虚檐拱斗，绝顶留云。虚檐拱斗，作成巧石穿花凤；绝顶留云，造就浮屠绕雾龙。远眺可观千里外，高登似在九霄中。层层门上琉璃灯，有尘无火；步步檐前白玉栏，积垢飞虫。塔心里，佛座上，香烟尽绝；窗棂外，神面前，蛛网牵蒙。炉中多鼠粪，盏内少油熔。只因暗失中间宝，苦杀僧人命落空。三藏发心将塔扫，管教重见旧时容。唐僧用帚子扫了一层，又上一层。如此扫至第七层上，却早二更时分。那长老渐觉困倦，行者道：“困了，你且坐下，等老孙替你扫罢。”三藏道：“这塔是多少层数？”行者道：“怕不有十三层哩。”长老耽着劳倦道：“是必扫了，方趁本愿。”又扫了三层，腰酸腿痛，就于十层上坐倒道：“悟空，你替我把那三层扫净下来罢。”行者抖擞精神，登上第十一层，霎时又上到第十二层。正扫处，只听得塔顶上有人言语，行者道：“怪哉！怪哉！</p>

<p>这早晚有三更时分，怎么得有人在这顶上言语？断乎是邪物也！且看看去。”</p>

<p>好猴王，轻轻的挟着笤帚，撒起衣服，钻出前门，踏着云头观看，只见第十三层塔心里坐着两个妖精，面前放一盘下饭，一只碗，一把壶，在那里猜拳吃酒哩。行者使个神通，丢了笤帚，掣出金箍棒，拦住塔门喝道：“好怪物！偷塔上宝贝的原来是你！”两个怪物慌了，急起身拿壶拿碗乱掼，被行者横铁棒拦住道：“我若打死你，没人供状。”只把棒逼将去。那怪贴在壁上，莫想挣扎得动，口里只叫：“饶命饶命！不干我事！自有偷宝贝的在那里也。”行者使个拿法，一只手抓将过来，径拿下第十层塔中。报道：“师父，拿住偷宝贝之贼了！”三藏正自盹睡，忽闻此言，又惊又喜道：“是那里拿来的？”行者把怪物揪到面前跪下道：“他在塔顶上猜拳吃酒耍子，是老孙听得喧哗，一纵云，跳到顶上拦住，未曾着力。但恐一棒打死，没人供状，故此轻轻捉来。师父可取他个口词，看他是那里妖精，偷的宝贝在于何处。”那怪物战战兢兢，口叫“饶命！”遂从实供道：“我两个是乱石山碧波潭万圣龙王差来巡塔的。他叫做奔波儿灞，我叫做灞波儿奔。他是鲇鱼怪，我是黑鱼精。因我万圣老龙生了一个女儿，就唤做万圣公主。那公主花容月貌，有二十分人才，招得一个驸马，唤做九头驸马，神通广大。前年与龙王来此，显大法力，下了一阵血雨，污了宝塔，偷了塔中的舍利子佛宝。公主又去大罗天上灵霄殿前，偷了王母娘娘的九叶灵芝草，养在那潭底下，金光霞彩，昼夜光明。近日闻得有个孙悟空往西天取经，说他神通广大，沿路上专一寻人的不是，所以这些时常差我等来此巡拦，若还有那孙悟空到时，好准备也。”行者闻言嘻嘻冷笑道：“那孽畜等这等无礼，怪道前日请牛魔王在那里赴会！原来他结交这伙泼魔，专干不良之事！”</p>

<p>说未了，只见八戒与两三个小和尚，自塔下提着两个灯笼，走上来道：“师父，扫了塔不去睡觉，在这里讲甚么哩？”行者道：“师弟，你来正好。塔上的宝贝，乃是万圣老龙偷了去。今着这两个小妖巡塔，探听我等来的消息，却才被我拿住也。”八戒道：“叫做甚么名字，甚么妖精？”行者道：“才然供了口词，一个叫做奔波儿灞，一个叫做灞波儿奔；一个是鲇鱼怪，一个是黑鱼精。”八戒掣钯就打，道：“既是妖精，取了口词，不打死何待？”行者道：“你不知，且留着活的，好去见皇帝讲话，又好做凿眼去寻贼追宝。”好呆子，真个收了钯，一家一个，都抓下塔来。那怪只叫：“饶命！”八戒道：“正要你鲇鱼黑鱼做些鲜汤，与那负冤屈的和尚吃哩！”两三个小和尚喜喜欢欢，提着灯笼引长老下了塔。一个先跑报众僧道：“好了！好了！我们得见青天了！偷宝贝的妖怪，已是爷爷们捉将来矣！”行者教：“拿铁索来，穿了琵琶骨，锁在这里。汝等看守，我们睡觉去，明日再做理会，”那些和尚都紧紧的守着，让三藏们安寝。</p>

<p>不觉的天晓，长老道：“我与悟空入朝，倒换关文去来。”长老即穿了锦襕袈裟，戴了毗卢帽，整束威仪，拽步前进。行者也束一束虎皮裙，整一整绵布直裰，取了关文同去。八戒道：“怎么不带这两个妖贼？”行者道：“待我们奏过了，自有驾帖着人来提他。”遂行至朝门外，看不尽那朱雀黄龙，清都绛阙。三藏到东华门，对阁门大使作礼道：“烦大人转奏，贫僧是东土大唐差去西天取经者，意欲面君，倒换关文。”那黄门官果与通报，至阶前奏道：“外面有两个异容异服僧人，称言南赡部洲东土唐朝差往西方拜佛求经，欲朝我王，倒换关文。”国王闻言，传旨教宣，长老即引行者入朝。文武百官，见了行者，无不惊怕，有的说是猴和尚，有的说是雷公嘴和尚，个个悚然，不敢久视。</p>

<p>长老在阶前舞蹈山呼的行拜，大圣叉着手，斜立在旁，公然不动。长老启奏道：“臣僧乃南赡部洲东土大唐国差来拜西方天竺国大雷音寺佛求取真经者，路经宝方，不敢擅过，有随身关文，乞倒验方行。”那国王闻言大喜。传旨教宣唐朝圣僧上金銮殿，安绣墩赐坐。长老独自上殿，先将关文捧上，然后谢恩敢坐。那国王将关文看了一遍，心中喜悦道：“似你大唐王有疾，能选高僧，不避路途遥远，拜我佛取经；寡人这里和尚，专心只是做贼，败国倾君！”三藏闻言合掌道：“怎见得败国倾君？”国王道：“寡人这国，乃是西域上邦，常有四夷朝贡，皆因国内有个金光寺，寺内有座黄金宝塔，塔上有光彩冲天，近被本寺贼僧，暗窃了其中之宝，三年无有光彩，外国这二年也不来朝，寡人心痛恨之。”三藏合掌笑道：“万岁，差之毫厘，失之千里矣。</p>

<p>贫僧昨晚到于天府，一进城门，就见十数个枷纽之僧。问及何罪，他道是金光寺负冤屈者。因到寺细审，更不干本寺僧人之事。贫僧入夜扫塔，已获那偷宝之妖贼矣。”国王大喜道：“妖贼安在？”三藏道：“现被小徒锁在金光寺里。”那国王急降金牌：</p>

<p>“着锦衣卫快到金光寺取妖贼来，寡人亲审。”三藏又奏道：“万岁，虽有锦衣卫，还得小徒去方可。”国王道：“高徒在那里？”三藏用手指道：“那玉阶旁立者便是。”国王见了，大惊道：“圣僧如此丰姿，高徒怎么这等象貌？”孙大圣听见了，厉声高叫道：</p>

<p>“陛下，人不可貌相，海水不可斗量。若爱丰姿者，如何捉得妖贼也？”国王闻言，回惊作喜道：“圣僧说的是，朕这里不选人材，只要获贼得宝归塔为上。”再着当驾官看车盖，教锦衣卫好生伏侍圣僧去取妖贼来。那当驾官即备大轿一乘，黄伞一柄，锦衣卫点起校尉，将行者八抬八绰，大四声喝路，径至金光寺。</p>

<p>自此惊动满城百姓，无处无一人不来看圣僧及那妖贼。</p>

<p>八戒、沙僧听得喝道，只说是国王差官，急出迎接，原来是行者坐在轿上。呆子当面笑道：“哥哥，你得了本身也！”行者下了轿，搀着八戒道：“我怎么得了本身？”八戒道：“你打着黄伞，抬着八人轿，却不是猴王之职分？故说你得了本身。”行者道：</p>

<p>“且莫取笑。”遂解下两个妖物，押见国王。沙僧道：“哥哥，也带挈小弟带挈。”行者道：“你只在此看守行李马匹。”那枷锁之僧道：“爷爷们都去承受皇恩，等我们在此看守。”行者道：“既如此，等我去奏过国王，却来放你。”八戒揪着一个妖贼，沙僧揪着一个妖贼，孙大圣依旧坐了轿，摆开头搭，将两个妖怪押赴当朝。须臾至白玉阶，对国王道：“那妖贼已取来了。”国王遂降龙床，与唐僧及文武多官同目视之，那怪一个是暴腮乌甲，尖嘴利牙；一个是滑皮大肚，巨口长须，虽然是有足能行，大抵是变成的人象。国王问曰：“你是何方贼怪，那处妖精，几年侵吾国土，何年盗我宝贝，一盘共有多少贼徒，都唤做甚么名字，从实一一供来！”二怪朝上跪下，颈内血淋淋的，更不知疼痛，供道：“三载之外，七月初一，有个万圣龙王，帅领许多亲戚，住居在本国东南，离此处路有百十，潭号碧波，山名乱石。生女多娇，妖娆美色，招赘一个九头驸马，神通无敌。他知你塔上珍奇，与龙王合盘做贼，先下血雨一场，后把舍利偷讫。见如今照耀龙宫，纵黑夜明如白日。公主施能，寂寂密密，又偷了王母灵芝，在潭中温养宝物。我两个不是贼头，乃龙王差来小卒。今夜被擒，所供是实。”国王道：“既取了供，如何不供自家名字？”</p>

<p>那怪道：“我唤做奔波儿灞，他唤做灞波儿奔，奔波儿灞是个鲇鱼怪，灞波儿奔是个黑鱼精。”国王教锦衣卫好生收监，传旨：</p>

<p>“赦了金光寺众僧的枷锁，快教光禄寺排宴，就于麒麟殿上谢圣僧获贼之功，议请圣僧捕擒贼首。”</p>

<p>光禄寺即时备了荤素两样筵席，国王请唐僧四众上麒麟殿叙坐，问道：“圣僧尊号？”唐僧合掌道：“贫僧俗家姓陈，法名玄奘。蒙君赐姓唐，贱号三藏。”国王又问：“圣僧高徒何号？”三藏道：“小徒俱无号，第一个名孙悟空，第二个名猪悟能，第三个名沙悟净，此乃南海观世音菩萨起的名字。因拜贫僧为师，贫僧又将悟空叫做行者，悟能叫做八戒，悟净叫做和尚。”国王听毕，请三藏坐了上席，孙行者坐了侧首左席，猪八戒沙和尚坐了侧首右席，俱是素果、素菜、素茶、素饭。前面一席荤的，坐了国王，下首有百十席荤的，坐了文武多官。众臣谢了君恩，徒告了师罪，坐定。国王把盏，三藏不敢饮酒，他三个各受了安席酒。下边只听得管弦齐奏，乃是教坊司动乐。你看八戒放开食嗓，真个是虎咽狼吞，将一席果菜之类，吃得罄尽。少顷间，添换汤饭又来，又吃得一毫不剩，巡酒的来，又杯杯不辞。这场筵席，直乐到午后方散。三藏谢了盛宴，国王又留住道：“这一席聊表圣僧获怪之功。”教光禄寺：“快翻席到建章宫里，再请圣僧定捕贼首，取宝归塔之计。”三藏道：“既要捕贼取宝，不劳再宴，贫僧等就此辞王，就擒捉妖怪去也。”国王不肯，一定请到建章宫，又吃了一席。国王举酒道：“那位圣僧帅众出师，降妖捕贼？”三藏道：“教大徒弟孙悟空去。”大圣拱手应承。国王道：</p>

<p>“孙长老既去，用多少人马？几时出城？”八戒忍不住高声叫道：</p>

<p>“那里用甚么人马！又那里管甚么时辰！趁如今酒醉饭饱，我共师兄去，手到擒来！”三藏甚喜道：“八戒这一向勤紧啊！”行者道：“既如此，着沙僧弟保护师父，我两个去来。”那国王道：</p>

<p>“二位长老既不用人马，可用兵器？”八戒笑道：“你家的兵器，我们用不得。我弟兄自有随身器械。”国王闻说，即取大觥来，与二位长老送行。孙大圣道：“酒不吃了，只教锦衣卫把两个小妖拿来，我们带了他去做凿眼。”国王传旨，即时提出。二人挟着两个小妖，驾风头，使个摄法，径上东南去了。噫！他那君臣一见腾风雾，才识师徒是圣僧。毕竟不知此去如何擒获，且听下回分解。</p>
