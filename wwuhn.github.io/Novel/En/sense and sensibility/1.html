<div class='layout'><p>1</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex. Their estate was large, and their residence was at Norland Park, in the centre of their property, where, for many generations, they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance. The late owner of this estate was a single man, who lived to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his life, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister. But her death, which happened ten years before his own, produced a great alteration in his home; for to supply her loss, he invited and received into his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal inheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended to bequeath it. In the society of his nephew and niece, and their children, the old Gentleman's days were comfortably spent. His attachment to them all increased. The constant attention of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from interest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid comfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of the children added a relish to his existence.</p><p>达什伍德家在苏塞克斯定居，可有些年代了。家里置下一个偌大的田庄，府第就设在田庄中心的诺兰庄园。祖祖辈辈以来，一家人一直过着体面日子，赢得了四近乡邻的交口称誉。已故庄园主是个单身汉，活到老大年纪。在世时，妹妹长年陪伴他，替他管管家务。不想妹妹早他十年去世，致使府上发生巨变。为了填补妹妹的空缺，他将侄儿亨利·达什伍德一家接到府上。亨利·达什伍德先生是诺兰田庄的法定继承人，老达什伍德打算把家业传给他。这位老绅士有侄儿、侄媳及其子女作伴，日子过得倒也舒心。他越来越喜爱他们。亨利·达什伍德夫妇不仅出自利害关系，而且由于心地善良，对他总是百般照应，使他晚年享尽了天伦之乐。而那些天真烂漫的孩子也给他的生活增添了乐趣。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son: by his present lady, three daughters. The son, a steady respectable young man, was amply provided for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large, and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age. By his own marriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards, he added to his wealth. To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was not so really important as to his sisters; for their fortune, independent of what might arise to them from their father's inheriting that property, could be but small. Their mother had nothing, and their father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal; for the remaining moiety of his first wife's fortune was also secured to her child, and he had only a life-interest in it.</p><p>亨利·达什伍德先生同前妻生下一个儿子，同现在的太太生了三个女儿。儿子是个踏实体面的青年。当年他母亲留下一大笔遗产，到他成年时有一半交给了他，为他奠定了厚实的家底。此后不久，他成了亲，又增添了一笔财产。所以，对他说来，父亲是不是继承诺兰田庄，远不像对他几个妹妹那样至关紧要。这几个妹妹假若不依赖父亲继承这笔家业可能给她们带来的进益，她们的财产便将微乎其微。她们的母亲一无所有，父亲仅仅掌管着七千镑，而对前妻另一半遗产的所有权只在生前有效，他一去世，这一半财产也归儿子承袭。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The old gentleman died: his will was read, and like almost every other will, gave as much disappointment as pleasure. He was neither so unjust, nor so ungrateful, as to leave his estate from his nephew;—but he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest. Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife and daughters than for himself or his son;—but to his son, and his son's son, a child of four years old, it was secured, in such a way, as to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear to him, and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate, or by any sale of its valuable woods. The whole was tied up for the benefit of this child, who, in occasional visits with his father and mother at Norland, had so far gained on the affections of his uncle, by such attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three years old; an imperfect articulation, an earnest desire of having his own way, many cunning tricks, and a great deal of noise, as to outweigh all the value of all the attention which, for years, he had received from his niece and her daughters. He meant not to be unkind, however, and, as a mark of his affection for the three girls, he left them a thousand pounds a-piece.</p><p>老绅士死了，开读遗嘱，发现跟其他遗嘱一样，叫人既高兴，也失望。他并非那样偏颇无情，还是把田庄传给了侄儿。但是，因为附有条件，这份遗产便失去了一半价值。本来，达什伍德先生想要这笔财产，只是顾念妻子和女儿，而不是为自己和儿子着想。但财产却偏偏要世袭给他儿子和四岁的孙子，这样一来，他便无权动用田庄的资财，或者变卖田庄的资财，来赡养他那些最亲近、最需要赡养的家眷。为了那个孩子，全盘家业都被冻结了。想当初，这孩子只是偶尔随父母亲到诺兰庄园来过几趟，跟其他两三岁娃娃一样，也没有什么异常逗人喜爱的地方，大不过正牙牙学语，禀性倔强，好恶作剧，爱大吵大闹，却博得了老绅士的欢心。相形之下，侄媳母女多年关照的情分，倒变得无足轻重了。不过，老人也不想太苛刻，为了表示他对三个站娘的一片心意，好歹分给了每人一千镑。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mr. Dashwood's disappointment was, at first, severe; but his temper was cheerful and sanguine; and he might reasonably hope to live many years, and by living economically, lay by a considerable sum from the produce of an estate already large, and capable of almost immediate improvement. But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was his only one twelvemonth. He survived his uncle no longer; and ten thousand pounds, including the late legacies, was all that remained for his widow and daughters.</p><p>达什伍德先生起初极为失望。他性情开朗，满以为自己能多活些年岁，凭着这么大的一个田庄，只要马上改善经营，省吃俭用“历史”中的“布哈林”，就能从收入中攒下一大笔钱，然而，这笔迟迟到手的财产在他名下只持续了一年工夫，因为叔父死后不久，他也一命归天，给他的遗嘱和女儿们留下的财产，包括叔父的遗产在内，总共不过一万镑。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>His son was sent for as soon as his danger was known, and to him Mr. Dashwood recommended, with all the strength and urgency which illness could command, the interest of his mother-in-law and sisters.</p><p>当时，家人看他病危了，便打发人去叫他儿子。达什伍德先生竭尽最后一点气力，向儿子做了紧急交代，嘱托他照应继母和三个妹妹。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mr. John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the family; but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at such a time, and he promised to do every thing in his power to make them comfortable. His father was rendered easy by such an assurance, and Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might prudently be in his power to do for them.</p><p>约翰·达什伍德先生不像家里其他人那样多情善感。可是，此时此刻受到这般嘱托，他也深为感动，答应尽力让她们母女生活得舒舒适适的。父亲听到这番许诺，便也放宽心了。一时间，约翰·达什伍德先生有空算计起来：若是精打细算，他到底能为她们尽多大力量。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He was not an ill-disposed young man, unless to be rather cold hearted and rather selfish is to be ill-disposed: but he was, in general, well respected; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of his ordinary duties. Had he married a more amiable woman, he might have been made still more respectable than he was:—he might even have been made amiable himself; for he was very young when he married, and very fond of his wife. But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricature of himself;—more narrow-minded and selfish.</p><p>这位年轻人心眼并不坏，除非你把冷漠无情和自私自利视为坏心眼。总的说来，他很受人尊敬，因为他平常办起事来，总是十分得体。他若是娶个和蔼一点的女人，也许会更受人尊重，甚至他自己也会和蔼一些。无奈他结婚时太年轻，太偏爱妻子了。不过，约翰·达什伍德夫人倒也活像她丈夫，只是更狭隘，更自私罢了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When he gave his promise to his father, he meditated within himself to increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand pounds a-piece. He then really thought himself equal to it. The prospect of four thousand a-year, in addition to his present income, besides the remaining half of his own mother's fortune, warmed his heart, and made him feel capable of generosity.— "Yes, he would give them three thousand pounds: it would be liberal and handsome! It would be enough to make them completely easy. Three thousand pounds! he could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience."— He thought of it all day long, and for many days successively, and he did not repent.</p><p>他向父亲许诺的时候，心里就在盘算，想给他妹妹每人再补贴一千镑的收入。当时，他确实觉得这是他力所能及的。他除了目前的收入和母亲另—半遗产以外，还可望每年再添四千镑。一想到这里，心里不禁热乎乎的，他认为自己可以慷慨一点。“是的，我可以给她们三千镑，这多么慷慨大方啊：可以确保她们安安生生地过日子啦。三千镑呀，我可以毫不费劲地省出这么一笔巨款。”他整天这么想着，接连想了好多天，一点也没反悔。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>No sooner was his father's funeral over, than Mrs. John Dashwood, without sending any notice of her intention to her mother-in-law, arrived with her child and their attendants. No one could dispute her right to come; the house was her husband's from the moment of his father's decease; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater, and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood's situation, with only common feelings, must have been highly unpleasing;—but in HER mind there was a sense of honor so keen, a generosity so romantic, that any offence of the kind, by whomsoever given or received, was to her a source of immovable disgust. Mrs. John Dashwood had never been a favourite with any of her husband's family; but she had had no opportunity, till the present, of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort of other people she could act when occasion required it.</p><p>父亲的丧事刚办完，约翰·达什伍德夫人也不打个招呼，就带着孩子、仆人来到婆婆家里。谁也无法怀疑她有权来这里，因为从她公公死去的时刻起，这房子就属于她丈夫的了。不过，她的行为实在太不文雅，按照人之常情，任何一个女人处在达什伍德太太当婆母的位置上，都会感到很不愉快。何况，达什伍德太太是个自尊心很强、慷慨大方、落拓不羁的女入，对这种唐突无礼的事情，无论是谁干的或者对谁干的，她都会感到深恶痛绝。约翰·达什伍德夫人在婆家从未受过任何人的喜爱，可是直到今天她才有机会向她们摆明：在必要时，她为人行事可以全然不顾别入的痛痒。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>So acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour, and so earnestly did she despise her daughter-in-law for it, that, on the arrival of the latter, she would have quitted the house for ever, had not the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the propriety of going, and her own tender love for all her three children determined her afterwards to stay, and for their sakes avoid a breach with their brother.</p><p>达什伍德太太厌恶这种蛮横无礼的行径，并因此而鄙视她的儿媳。一见儿媳进门，她就恨不得永远离开这个家。怎奈大女儿一再恳求，她开始考虑一走了之是否妥当。后来硬是出自对三个女儿的爱怜，她才决定留下来。看在女儿们的份上，还是不跟那个做哥哥的闹翻为好。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so effectual, possessed a strength of understanding, and coolness of judgment, which qualified her, though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother, and enabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage of them all, that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led to imprudence. She had an excellent heart;—her disposition was affectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern them: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn; and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.</p><p>大女儿埃丽诺的劝解奏效了。埃丽诺思想敏锐，头脑冷静，虽然年仅十九岁，却能为母亲出谋划策。达什伍德太太性情急躁，做事总是冒冒失失。埃丽诺为大家着想，经常出来劝阻劝阻。她心地善良，性格温柔，感情强烈，然而她会克制自己，—一对于这—手，她母亲还有待学习，不过她有个妹妹决计一辈子也不要学。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Marianne's abilities were, in many respects, quite equal to Elinor's. She was sensible and clever; but eager in everything: her sorrows, her joys, could have no moderation. She was generous, amiable, interesting: she was everything but prudent. The resemblance between her and her mother was strikingly great.</p><p>玛丽安各方面的才干都堪与埃丽诺相媲美。她聪慧善感，只是做什么事情都心急火燎的。她伤心也罢，高兴也罢，都没有个节制。她为人慷慨，和蔼可亲，也很有趣，可就是一点也不谨慎，与她母亲一模一样。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Elinor saw, with concern, the excess of her sister's sensibility; but by Mrs. Dashwood it was valued and cherished. They encouraged each other now in the violence of their affliction. The agony of grief which overpowered them at first, was voluntarily renewed, was sought for, was created again and again. They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it, and resolved against ever admitting consolation in future. Elinor, too, was deeply afflicted; but still she could struggle, she could exert herself. She could consult with her brother, could receive her sister-in-law on her arrival, and treat her with proper attention; and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion, and encourage her to similar forbearance.</p><p>埃丽诺见妹妹过于感情用事，不免有些担心，可达什伍德太太却觉得这很难能可贵。现在，她们两人极度悲痛的情绪，互相感染，互相助长。最初的那种悲痛欲绝的情状，一触即发，说来就来，反反复复地没完没了。她们完全沉湎于悲恸之中，真是哪里伤心往哪里想，越想越痛不欲生，认定这辈子就这么了结啦，谁来解劝也无济于事。埃丽诺也很悲痛，不过她尚能顶得住，尽量克制自己。她遇事能同哥哥商量着办，嫂子来了能以礼相待。她还能劝说母亲也这样做，请她多加忍让。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Margaret, the other sister, was a good-humored, well-disposed girl; but as she had already imbibed a good deal of Marianne's romance, without having much of her sense, she did not, at thirteen, bid fair to equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life.</p><p>三妹玛格丽特是个快活厚道的小姑娘，不过由于她已经染上了不少玛丽安的浪漫气质，而又不像她那么聪明，处在十三岁的年纪，还不可能赶上涉世较深的姐姐。</p></div>
