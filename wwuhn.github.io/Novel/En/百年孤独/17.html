<div class='layout'><p>17</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>úRSULA HAD to make a great effort to fulfill her promise to die when it cleared. The waves of lucidity that were so scarce during the rains became more frequent after August, when an and wind began to blow and suffocated the rose bushes and petrified the piles of mud, and ended up scattering over Macon-do the burning dust that covered the rusted zinc roofs and the age-old almond trees forever. úrsula cried in lamentation when she discovered that for more than three years she had been a plaything for the children. She washed her painted face, took off the strips of brightly colored cloth, the dried lizards and frogs, and the rosaries and old Arab necklaces that they had hung all over her body, and for the first time since the death of Amaranta she got up out of bed without anybody's help to join in the family life once more. The spirit of her invincible heart guided her through the shadows. Those who noticed her stumbling and who bumped into the archangelic arm she kept raised at head level thought that she was having trouble body, but they still did not think she was blind. She did not need to see to realize that the flower beds, cultivated with such care since the first rebuilding, had been destroyed by the rain and ruined by Aureli-ano Segun-do's excavations, and that the walls and the cement of the floors were cracked, the furniture mushy and discolored, the doors off their hinges, and the family menaced by a spirit of resignation and despair that was inconceivable in her time. Feeling her way along through the empty bedrooms she perceived the continuous rumble of the termites as they carved the wood, the snipping of the moths in the clothes closets, and the devastating noise of the enormous red ants that had prospered during the deluge and were undermining the foundations of the house. One day she opened the trunk with the saints and had to ask Santa Sofía de la Piedad to get off her body the cockroaches that jumped out and that had already turned the clothing to dust. "A person can't live in neglect like this," she said. "If we go on like this we'll be devoured by animals." From then on she did not have a moment of repose. Up before dawn, she would use anybody available, even the children. She put the few articles of clothing that were still usable out into the sun, she drove the cockroaches off with powerful insecticide attacks, she scratched out the veins that the termites had made on doors and windows and asphyxiated the ants in their anthills quicklime. The fever of restoration finally brought her to the forgotten rooms. She cleared out the rubble cobwebs in the room where José Arcadio Buendía had lost his wits looking for the Philosopher's stone, she put the silver shop which had been upset by the soldiers in order, and lastly she asked for the keys to Melquíades' room to see what state it was in. Faithful to the wishes of José Arcadio Segun-do, who had forbidden anyone to come in unless there was a clear indication that he had died, Santa Sofía de la Piedad tried all kinds of subterfuges to throw úrsula off the track. But so inflexible was her determination not to surrender even the most remote corner of the house to the insects that she knocked down every obstacle in her path, and after three days of insistence she succeeded in getting them to open the door for her. She had to hold on to the doorjamb so that the stench would not knock her over, but she needed only two seconds to remember that the school-girls' seventy-two chamberpots were in there and that on one of the rainy nights a patrol of soldiers had searched the house looking for José Arcadio Segun-do and had been unable to find him.</p><p>八月里开始刮起了热风。这种热风不但窒息了玫瑰花丛，使所有的沼泽都干涸了，而且给马孔多生锈的锌板屋顶和它那百年杏树都撒上了一层灼热的尘土。下雨的时候，乌苏娜意识中突发的闪光是十分罕见的，但从八月开始，却变得频繁了。看来，乌苏娜还要过不少日子才能实现自己的诺言，在雨停之后死去。她知道自己给孩子们当了三年多的玩偶，就无限自怜地哭泣起来。她拭净脸上的污垢，脱掉身上的花布衣服，抖掉身上的干蜥蜴和癞蛤蟆，扔掉颈上的念珠和项链，从阿玛兰塔去世以来，头一次不用旁人搀扶，自己下了床，准备重新投身到家庭生活中去。她那颗不屈服的心在黑暗中引导着她。无论谁看到她那颤巍巍的动作，或者突然瞧见她那总是伸得与头一般高的天使似的手，都会对老太婆弱不禁凤的身体产生恻隐之心，可是谁也不会想到乌苏娜的眼睛完全瞎了。但这并没有妨碍乌苏娜发现，她从房子第一次改建以来那么细心照料的花坛，已被雨水冲毁了，又让奥雷连诺第二给掘过了，地板和墙壁裂开一道道缝，家具摇摇晃晃，全褪了色，房门也从铰链上脱落下来。家中出现了从未有过的消沉和沮丧的气氛。乌苏娜摸着走过一间间空荡荡的卧室时，传进她耳里的只是蚂蚁不停地啃蚀木头的磁哦声。蛀虫在衣柜里的活动声和雨天滋生的大红蚂蚁破坏房基的安全声。有一次，她打开一只衣箱，箱子里突然爬出一群蟑螂，里面的衣服几乎都被它们咬破了，她不得不求救似的把圣索菲娅·德拉佩德叫来。“在这样的废墟上怎能生活呢？”她说。“到头来这些畜生会把咱们也消灭的，”从这一天起，乌苏娜心里一刻也没宁静过。清早起来，她便把所有能召唤的人都叫来帮忙，小孩子也不例外。她在太阳下晒干最后一件完好无损的外套和一些还可穿的内衣，用各种毒剂突然袭击蟑螂，赶跑它们，堵死门缝和窗框上白蚂蚁开辟的一条条通路，拿生石灰把蚂蚁直接闷死在洞穴里。由于怀着一种力图恢复一切的狂热愿望，乌苏娜甚至来到那些被遗忘的房间跟前。她先叫人清除了一个房间里的垃圾和蜘蛛网，在这个房间里，霍·阿布恩蒂亚曾绞尽脑汁，不遗余力地寻找过点金石。接着，她又亲自把士兵们翻得乱七八糟的首饰作坊整理一番；最后，她要了梅尔加德斯房间的钥匙，打算看一下里面的情况，可是霍·阿卡蒂奥第二在自己死亡之前是绝对禁止人们走进这个房间的。圣索菲娅·德拉佩德尊重他的意愿，试图用一些妙计和借口促使乌苏娜放弃自己的打算。但是老太婆固执己见，决心消灭房中偏僻角落里的虫子，毅然决然地排除了她碰到的一切困难，三天之后便达到了目的——打开了梅尔加德斯的房间。房间里发出冲鼻的臭气，乌苏娜抓住门框，才站稳了脚跟。然而她立即想起，这房间里放着为梅梅的女同学买的七十二只便盆，想起最初的一个雨夜里，士兵们为了寻找霍·阿卡蒂奥第二，搜遍了整座房子，始终没有找到。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Lord save us!" she exclaimed, as if she could see everything. "So much trouble teaching you good manners and you end up living like a pig."</p><p>“我的天啊！”她若看得见梅尔加德斯房间里的一切，准会这样惊叫一声。“我花了那么多力气教你养成整洁的习惯，可你却在这儿脏得象只猪。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>José Arcadio Segun-do was still reading over the parchments. The only thing visible in the intricate tangle of hair was the teeth striped with green dime and his motionless eyes. When he recognized his great--grandmother's voice he turned his head toward the door, tried to smile, and without knowing it repeated an old phrase of úrsula's.</p><p>霍·阿卡蒂奥第二正在继续考证羊皮纸手稿。他那凌乱不堪、又长又密的头发垂到了额上，透过头发只望得见微绿的牙齿和呆滞的眼睛。听出曾祖母的声音，他就朝房门掉过头去，试图微笑一下，可他自己也不知怎的重复了乌苏娜从前讲过的一句话。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What did you expect?" he murmured. "Time passes."</p><p>“你在想什么呢？”他叨咕道。“时光正在流逝嘛。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That's how it goes," úrsula said, "but not so much."</p><p>“当然，”乌苏娜说，“可毕竟是…”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When she said it she realized that she was giving the same reply that Colonel Aureli-ano Buendía had given in his death cell, and once again she shuddered with the evidence that time was not passing, as she had just admitted, but that it was turning in a circle. But even then she did not give resignation a chance. She scolded José Arcadio Segun-do as if he were a child and insisted that he take a bath and shave and lend a hand in fixing up the house. The simple idea of abandoning the room that had given him peace terrified José Arcadio Segun-do. He shouted that there was no human power capable of making him go out because he did not want to see the train with two hundred cars loaded with dead people which left Macon-do every day at dusk on its way to the sea. "They were all of those who were at the station," he shouted. "Three thousand four hundred eight." Only then did úrsula realize that he was in a world of shadows more impenetrable than hers, as unreachable and solitary as that of his great-grandfather. She left him in the room, but she succeeded in getting them to leave the padlock off, clean it every day, throw the chamberpots away except for one, and to keep José Arcadio Segun-do as clean and presentable as his great--grandfather had been during his long captivity under the chestnut tree. At first Fernanda interpreted that bustle as an attack of senile madness and it was difficult for her to suppress her exasperation. But about that time José Arcadio told that he planned to come to Macon-do from Rome before taking his final vows, and the good news filled her with such enthusiasm that from morning to night she would be seen watering the flowers four times a day so that her son would not have a bad impression of the house. It was that same incentive which induced her to speed up her correspondence with the invisible doctors and to replace the pots of ferns and oregano and the begonias on the porch even before úrsula found out that they had been destroyed by Aureli-ano Segun-do's exterminating fury. Later on she sold the silver service and bought ceramic dishes, pewter bowls and soup spoons, and alpaca tablecloths, and with them brought poverty to the cupboards that had been accustomed to India Company chinaware and Bohemian crystal. úrsula always tried to go a step beyond. "Open the windows and the doors," she shouted. "Cook some meat and fish, buy the largest turtles around, let strangers come and spread their mats in the corners and urinate in the rose bushes and sit down to eat as many times as they want and belch and rant and muddy everything with their boots, and let them do whatever they want to us, because that's the only way to drive off rain." But it was a vain illusion. She was too old then and living on borrowed time to repeat the miracle of the little candy animals, and none of her descendants had inherited her strength. The house stayed closed on Fernanda's orders.</p><p>这时，她忽然想起奥雷连诺上校在死刑犯牢房里也曾这么回答过她。一想到时光并没有象她最后认为的那样消失，而在轮回往返，打着圈子，她又打了个哆嗦。然而这一次乌苏娜没有泄气。她象训斥小孩儿似的，把霍·阿卡蒂奥第二教训了一顿，逼着他洗脸、刮胡子，还要他帮助她完成房子的恢复工作。自愿与世隔绝的霍·阿卡蒂奥第二，想到自己必须离开这个使他得到宁静的房间就吓坏了。他忍不住叫嚷起来，说是没有什么力量能够使他离开这儿，说他不想看到两百节车厢的列车，因为列车上装满了尸体，每晚都从马孔多向海边驶去。“在车站上被枪杀的人都在那些车厢里，三千四百零八个。”乌苏娜这才明白，霍·阿卡蒂奥第二生活在比她注定要碰上的黑暗更不可洞察的黑暗中，生活在跟他曾祖父一样闭塞和孤独的天地里。她不去打扰霍·阿卡蒂奥第二，只是叫人从他的房门上取下挂锁，除留下一个便盆外，把其它的便盆都扔掉，每天到那儿打扫一遍，让霍·阿卡蒂奥第二保持整齐清洁，甚至不逊于他那长期呆在栗树下面的曾祖父。起先，菲兰达把乌苏娜总想活动的愿望看做是老年昏聩症的发作，勉强压住自己的怒火。可是就在这时，威尼斯来了一封信——霍·阿卡蒂奥向她说，他打算在实现终身的誓言之前回一次马孔多。这个好消息使得菲兰达那么高兴，她自己也开始从早到晚收拾屋子，一天浇四次花，只要老家不让她的儿子产生坏印象就成。她又开始跟那些没有见过的医生通信，并且把欧洲蕨花盆、牛至花盆以及秋海棠花盆都陈列在长廊上，很久以后乌苏娜才知道它们都让奥雷连诺第二在一阵破坏性的愤怒中摔碎了。后来，菲兰达卖掉了一套银制餐具，买了一套陶制餐具、一些锡制汤碗和大汤勺，还有一些锡制器皿；从此，一贯保存英国古老瓷器、波希米亚水晶玻璃器皿的壁橱，就显得很可怜了。可是乌苏娜觉得这还不够。“把门窗都打开吧，”她大声说。“烤一些肉，炸一些鱼，买一些最大的甲鱼，让外国人来作客，让他们在所有的角落里铺床，干脆在玫瑰花上撒尿，让他们坐在桌边，想吃多少就吃多少，让他们连打响嗝、胡说八道，让他们穿着大皮鞋径直闯进一个个房间，把到处都踩脏，让他们跟我们一起干他们愿干的一切事儿，因为我们只有这样才能驱除破败的景象。”可是乌苏娜想干的是不可能的事。她已经太老了，在人世间活得太久了，再也不能制作糖动物了，而子孙后代又没继承她那顽强的奋斗精神。于是，按照菲兰达的吩咐，一扇扇房门依然紧紧地闭着。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Aureli-ano Segun-do, who had taken his trunks back to the house of Petra Cotes, barely had enough means to see that the family did not starve to death. With the raffling of the mule, Petra Cotes and he bought some more animals with which they managed to set up a primitive lottery business. Aureli-ano Segun-do would go from house to house selling the tickets that he himself painted with colored ink to make them more attractive and convincing, and perhaps he did not realize that many people bought them out of gratitude and most of them out of pity. Nevertheless, even the most pitying purchaser was getting a chance to win a pig for twenty cents or a calf for thirty-two, and they became so hopeful that on Tuesday nights Petra Cotes's courtyard overflowed with people waiting for the moment when a child picked at random drew the winning number from a bag. It did not take long to become a weekly fair, for at dusk food and drink stands would be set up in the courtyard and many of those who were favored would slaughter the animals they had won right there on the condition that someone else supply the liquor and music, so that without having wanted to, Aureli-ano Segun-do suddenly found himself playing the accordion again and participating in modest tourneys of voracity. Those humble replicas of the revelry of former times served to show Aureli-ano Segun-do himself how much his spirits had declined and to what a degree his skill as a masterful carouser had dried up. He was a changed man. The two hundred forty pounds that he had attained during the days when he had been challenged by The Elephant had been reduced to one hundred fifty-six; the glowing and bloated tortoise face had turned into that of an iguana, and he was always on the verge of boredom and fatigue. For Petra Cotes, however, he had never been a better man than at that time, perhaps because the pity that he inspired was mixed with love, and because of the feeling of solidarity that misery aroused in both of them. The broken-down bed ceased to be the scene of wild activities and was changed into an intimate refuge. Freed of the repetitious mirrors, which had been auctioned off to buy animals for the lottery, and from the lewd damasks and velvets, which the mule had eaten, they would stay up very late with the innocence of two sleepless grandparents, taking advantage of the time to draw up accounts and put away pennies which they formerly wasted just for the sake of it. Sometimes the cock's crow would find them piling unpiling coins, taking a bit away from here to put there, to that this bunch would be enough to keep Fernanda happy and that would be for Amaranta úrsula's shoes, and that other one for Santa Sofía de la Piedad, who had not had a new dress since the time of all the noise, and this to order the coffin if úrsula died, and this for the coffee which was going up a cent a pound in price every three months, and this for the sugar which sweetened less every day, and this for the lumber which was still wet from the rains, and this other one for the paper and the colored ink to make tickets with, and what was left over to pay off the winner of the April calf whose hide they had miraculously saved when it came down with a symptomatic carbuncle just when all of the numbers in the raffle had already been sold. Those rites of poverty were so pure that they nearly always set aside the largest share for Fernanda, and they did not do so out of remorse or charity, but because her wellbeing was more important to them than their own. What was really happening to them, although neither of them realized it, was that they both thought of Fernanda as the daughter that they would have liked to have and never did, to the point where on a certain occasion they resigned themselves to eating crumbs for three days, so that she could buy a Dutch tablecloth. Nevertheless, no matter how much they killed themselves with work, no matter how much money they eked out, and no matter how many schemes they thought of, their guardian angels were asleep with fatigue while they put in coins and took them out trying to get just enough to live with. During the waking hours when the accounts were bad. they wondered what had happened in the world for the animals not to breed with the same drive as before, why money slipped through their fingers, and why people who a short time before had burned rolls of bills in the carousing considered it highway robbery to charge twelve cents for a raffle of six hens. Aureli-ano Segun-do thought without saying so that the evil was not in the world but in some hidden place in the mysterious heart of Petra Cotes, where something had happened during the deluge that had turned the animals sterile and made money scarce. Intrigued by that enigma, he dug so deeply into her sentiments that in search of interest he found love, because by trying to make her love him he ended up falling in love with her. Petra Cotes, for her part, loved him more and more as she felt his love increasing, and that was how in the ripeness of autumn she began to believe once more in the youthful superstition that poverty was the servitude of love. Both looked back then on the wild revelry, the gaudy wealth, the unbridled fornication as an annoyance and they lamented that it had cost them so much of their lives to fund the paradise of shared solitude. Madly in love after so many years of sterile complicity, they enjoyed the miracle of loving each other as much at the table as in bed, and they grew to be so happy that even when they were two wornout old people they kept on blooming like little children and playing together like dogs.</p><p>奥雷里亚诺第二又把衣箱搬回了佩特拉·科特斯家，他此时只能勉强维持不致让家人饿死。用卖骡子彩票挣的钱，佩特拉·科特斯和他又买了别的牲畜，由此起家经营起彩票生意。奥雷里亚诺第二走街串户兜售彩票，那些彩票都是他自己用彩笔所画，以求更吸引人也更有说服力，但他或许没有觉察到有些人购买是出于感激，大多数人是出于怜悯。不过，即使是最富于同情心的购买者，也不会放弃花二十生太伏得一头猪或三十二生太伏得一头小牛的机会，每到星期二晚上都满怀希望，挤满佩特拉·科特斯家的院子，等待那个随机选出的孩子从袋子里抽出中奖号码。不久这里就变为每星期一次的集市，一到星期二傍晚院中便支起油炸食品摊子和饮料台，很多中奖者只要有人奏乐和上酒就当场杀掉牲畜，而奥雷里亚诺第二也不曾想到自己又拉起手风琴，加入因陋就简的饕餮比赛。这些宴席仿佛昔日盛况的寒酸翻版，也令奥雷里亚诺第二发现自己当年的活力荡然无存，昔日的昆比安巴舞高手雄风不再。他己然变了一个人。当年遭遇“母象”挑战时高达一百二十公斤的体重如今己减至七十八公斤，当年快活圆鼓的乌龟脸变成了鬣蜥脸，总是带着无聊和疲惫。然而对佩特拉·科特斯来说，他从来没有现在这样好，她或许是将他在自己心中激起的同情，以及贫困引发的患难与共当作了爱情。光秃秃的大床不再是纵情欢愉的地方，而变成私密的避难所。天花板上的照影镜己被卖掉换来做奖品的牲畜，引人绮念的锦缎和天鹅绒也己被骡子啃光，他们好像一对欲望全无的老夫老妻，直到夜深仍不能成眠，便将以前白白浪费的时间用在算账和摆弄零钱上。有时他们一直忙到听见第一声鸡叫，把一堆堆零钱搬来弄去，这里减一点儿那里加一点儿：这些用来哄费尔南达开心，那些用来给阿玛兰妲·乌尔苏拉买鞋，还有这些给桑塔索菲亚·德拉·彼达，她自从混乱时期起就再没穿过新衣服，这些用来给乌尔苏拉预备寿材，那些用来购买隔三个月每磅就涨上一生太伏的咖啡，这些用来买越来越没甜味的白糖，这些用来买暴雨过后还没干透的木柴，那些用来买画彩票用的纸和彩墨，剩下的补上四月份那头小牛造成的亏损，它在彩票卖光的时候突然患上红斑症，最后只侥幸落下一张牛皮。在这些无私的贫寒弥撒中，他们总把最多的一部分留给费尔南达，倒不是出于愧疚或善心，而是因为比起自己来他们更在乎她能否过得舒适。尽管两人都没察觉，他们其实都把费尔南达当成了求之不得的女儿，甚至有一次甘心情愿连喝三天玉米糊，只为了能让她买下一块荷兰桌布。然而，他们拼命劳作，努力省钱，想出无数花样，守护天使却依然在疲倦中沉睡，任他们怎样把硬币挪来移去也仅仅勉强糊口而己。因入不敷出而彻夜难眠时，他们不禁自问这世界是怎么了，为什么牲畜不再像当年那样疯狂繁殖，为什么钱从手中溜走，为什么不久前人们还肯为昆比安巴舞花上大沓钞票，现今却认为能得六只母鸡的彩票定价十二生太伏就是抢劫。奥雷里亚诺第二嘴上没有说，心里却相信不是世界的问题，而是佩特拉·科特斯神秘心灵的某个隐秘角落在暴雨期间出了毛病，使牲畜不再多产，令钱财滑不留手。他带着这个谜团，深入她的心灵反复探究，想要找寻利益却找到了爱情，他本想让她爱自己结果自己却爰上了她。而佩特拉·科特斯见他越发亲热也就越发爱他，于是在暮年将至时又重拾青春时代的迷信，相信贫穷是爱情的奴仆。想起往昔，两人都把荒唐的欢宴、离奇的财富和毫无节制的私情当作妨碍，一同感慨浪掷了多少时光才找到共享孤独的天堂。两人在无儿无女的多年相伴之后疯狂相爱，奇迹般从桌上到床上都如胶似漆无比幸福，直到年老体衰时仍像小兔一样嬉戏，像狗一般打闹。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The raffles never got very far. At first Aureli-ano Segun-do would spend three days of the week shut up in what had been his rancher's office drawing ticket after ticket, Painting with a fair skill a red cow, a green pig, or a group of blue hens, according to the animal being raffled, and he would sketch out a good imitation of printed numbers and the name that Petra Cotes thought good to call the business: Divine Providence Raffles. But with time he felt so tired after drawing up to two thousand tickets a week that he had the animals, the name, and the numbers put on rubber stamps, and then the work was reduced to moistening them on pads of different colors. In his last years it occurred to him to substitute riddles for the numbers so that the prize could be shared by all of those who guessed it, but the system turned out to be so complicated and was open to so much suspicion that he gave it up after the second attempt.</p><p>从一次次抽彩中赚得的钱并没增加多少。最初，每星期有三天，奥雷连诺第二把自己关在经营牲畜的老办事处里，绘制一张又一张彩票，按照抽彩要发的奖，维妙维肖地绘出一头火红色的母牛、三头草绿色的乳猪或者一群天蓝色的母鸡，还悉心地用印刷体字母标上公司名称：“天意彩票公司”，那是佩特娜·柯特为公司起的名称。后来，他一星期不得不绘制二千多张彩票，不久他感到实在太累，便去定做了一些刻有公司名称、牲畜画像和号码的橡皮图章。从此，他的工作只是把图章在浸透了各种彩色墨水的印垫上蘸湿，再盖在一张张彩票纸上。在自己一生的最后几年里，奥雷连诺第二忽然想用谜语代替彩票上的号码，并在猜中谜语的那些人之间平分奖品。可是这种做法太复杂，再说，它又容易引起各种可能有的怀疑，在第二次试行之后，他就只好放弃了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Aureli-ano Segun-do was so busy trying to maintain the prestige of his raffles that he barely had time to see the children. Fernanda put Amaranta úrsula in a small private school where they admitted only six girls, but she refused to allow Aureli-ano to go to public school. She considered that she had already relented too much in letting him leave the room. Besides, the schools in those days accepted only the legitimate offspring of Catholic marriages on the birth certificate that had been pinned to Aureli-ano's clothing when they brought him to the house he was registered as a foundling. So he remained shut In at the mercy of Santa Sofía de la Piedad's loving eyes and úrsula's mental quirks, learning in the narrow world of the house whatever his grandmothers explained to him. He was delicate, thin, with a curiosity that unnerved the adults, but unlike the inquisitive and sometimes clairvoyant look that the colonel had at his age, his look was blinking and somewhat distracted. While Amaranta úrsula was in kindergarten, he would hunt earthworms torture insects in the garden. But once when Fernanda caught him putting scorpions in a box to put in úrsula's bed, she locked him up in Meme's old room, where he spent his solitary hours looking through the pictures in the encyclopedia. úrsula found him there one afternoon when she was going about sprinkling the house with distilled water and a bunch of nettles, and in spite of the fact that she had been with him many times she asked him who he was.</p><p>每天从清晨到深夜，奥雷连诺第二都在为巩固彩票公司的威望忙碌，他差不多没剩下什么时间去看望孩子们。菲兰达干脆把阿玛兰塔·乌苏娜送进一所一年只收六名女生的私立学校，却不同意小奥雷连诺去上市立学校。她允许他在房子里自由地游逛，这种让步已经太大了，何况当时学校只收合法出生的孩子，父母要正式举行过宗教婚礼，出生证明必须和橡皮奶头一起，系在人们把婴儿带回家的那种摇篮上，而小奥雷连诺偏偏列入了弃婴名单。这样，他就不得不继续过着闭塞的生活，纯然接受圣索菲娅·德拉佩德和乌苏娜在神志清醒时的亲切监督。在聆听了两个老太婆的各种介绍之后，他了解的只是以房屋围墙为限的一个狭窄天地。他渐渐长成一个彬彬有礼、自尊自爱的孩子，生就一种孜孜不倦的求知欲，有时使成年人都不知所措，跟少年时代的奥雷连诺上校不同的是，他还没有明察秋毫的敏锐目光，瞧起什么来甚至有些漫不经心，不时眨巴着眼睛。阿玛兰塔·乌苏娜在学校里念书时，他还在花园里挖掘蚯蚓，折磨昆虫。有一次，他正把一些蝎子往一只小盒子里塞，准备悄悄扔进乌苏娜的铺盖，不料菲兰达一把抓住了他；为了这桩事，她把他关在梅梅昔日的卧室里。他为了寻找摆脱孤独的出路，开始浏览起百科全书里的插图来。在那儿他又碰上了乌苏娜，乌苏娜手里拿着一束荨麻，正顺着一个个房间走动，一边往墙壁上稍稍撒点圣水。尽管她已经多次跟他相遇，却依然问他是谁。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I’m Aureliano Buendía。"he said.</p><p>“我是奥雷连诺·布恩蒂亚，”他说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That’s right，"she replied. "And now it’s time for you to start learning how to be a silversmith."</p><p>“不错，”她答道。“你已经到了开始学做首饰的时候啦。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She had confused him with her son again, because the hot wind that came after the deluge and had brought occasional waves of lucidity to úrsula's brain had passed. She never got her reason back. When she went into the bedroom she found Petronila Iguarán there with the bothersome crinolines and the beaded jacket that she put on for formal visits, and she found Tranquilina Maria Miniata Alacoque Buendía, her grand-mother, fanning herself with a peacock feather in her invalid's rocking chair, and her great-grandfather Aure-liano Arcadio Buendía, with his imitation dolman of the viceregal guard, and Aureli-ano Iguarán, her father, who had invented a prayer to make the worms shrivel up and drop off cows, and her timid mother, and her cousin with the pig's tail, and José Arcadio Buendía, and her dead sons, all sitting in chairs lined up against the wall as if it were a wake and not a visit. She was tying a colorful string chatter together, commenting on things from many separate places and many different times, so that when Amaranta úrsula returned from school Aureli-ano grew tired of the encyclopedia, they would find her sitting on her bed, talking to herself and lost in a labyrinth of dead people. "Fire!" she shouted once in terror and for an instant panic spread through the house, but what she was telling about was the burning of a barn that she had witnessed when she was four years old. She finally mixed up the past with the present in such a way that in the two or three waves of lucidity that she had before she died, no one knew for certain whether she was speaking about she felt or what she remembered. Little by little she was shrinking, turning into a fetus, becoming mummified in life to the point that in her last months she was a cherry raisin lost inside of her nightgown, and the arm that she always kept raised looked like the paw of a marimonda monkey. She was motionless for several days, and Santa Sofía de la Piedad had to shake her to convince herself that she was alive and sat her on her lap to feed her a few spoonfuls of sugar water. She looked like a newborn old woman. Amaranta úrsula Aureli-ano would take her in and out of the bedroom, they would lay her on the altar to see if she was any larger than the Christ child, and one afternoon they hid her in a closet in the Pantry where the rats could have eaten her. One Palm Sunday they went into the bedroom while Fernanda was in church and carried úrsula out by the neck and ankles.</p><p>她又把他错当成了自己的儿子，因为代替暴雨使她神智清醒了一阵子的热风刚刚过去。老太婆的判断又不清楚了。走进卧室，她好象每一次都会遇到一些跟她交往过的人：佩特罗尼娜·伊古阿兰令人注目地穿着一条华丽的钟式裙，披着一块用珠子装饰的绣花披肩，都是她出入上流社会时的装束；瘫痪的外祖母特兰吉林娜·马里雅·米尼亚塔·阿拉柯克·布恩蒂亚庄重地坐在摇椅里，挥着一把孔雀羽毛扇；那儿还有乌苏娜的曾祖父——奥雷连诺·阿卡蒂奥·布恩蒂亚——穿着一套总督禁卫军的制服，她的父亲奥雷连诺·伊古阿兰（牛虻的幼虫一听到他作的祷文就会丧命），从牛背上摔下来；此外还有她那位笃信神灵的母亲；长着一条猪尾巴的堂弟霍塞·奥雷连诺·布恩蒂亚和他那些已故的儿子们——他们一个个都端坐在沿墙摆着的椅子上，仿佛不是来作客，而是来听安魂祈祷的。她开始娓娓动听地跟他们谈话，讨论一些在时间和地点上彼此都无联系的事情。从学校回来的阿玛兰塔·乌苏娜，看厌了百科全书的奥雷连诺·布恩蒂亚，走进她的卧宝时，也常常见她坐在床上大声地自言自语，在回忆死者的迷宫里瞎碰乱撞。有一次，她突然拉开吓人的嗓子，叫喊起来：“失火啦！”喊声惊动了整座房子。事实上，她回忆起了自己四岁时见到的一次马厩失火。她就这样把过去跟现在混在一起。没死之前，她还有过两三次神智清醒的时候，但即使在那种时候，大概谁也不知道她讲的是此时此刻的感觉，还是对往事的回忆，乌苏娜渐渐枯槁了，还没死就变成了一具木乃伊，在她一生最后的几个月里，干瘪得犹如掉在睡衣里的一块黑李子干，她那只总是僵硬的手也变得好象长尾猴的爪子。她可以整整几天呆在那儿，一动也不动，圣索菲娅·德拉佩德只好把她摇了又摇，在确信她还活着之后，就让她坐在自己膝上，喂她一小匙糖水。这时，乌苏娜看上去就象一个获得新生的老太婆。阿玛兰塔·乌苏娜和奥雷连诺·布恩蒂亚架起她，在卧室里拍着她，把她放在祭坛上，想证实一下她是否只比耶稣婴儿时稍大一点儿。有一天晚上，他们甚至把她藏在储藏室的一只柜子里，在那儿，她差一点让老鼠吃掉。在复活节前的那个礼拜日，趁菲兰达正在做弥撒，他们又走进乌苏娜的卧室，一下子抬起她的头和脚。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Poor great-great-grandmother," Amaranta úrsula said. "She died of old age."</p><p>“可怜的高祖母，”阿玛兰塔·乌苏娜脱口而出，“她老死了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>úrsula was startled.</p><p>乌苏娜猝然一动。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm alive!" she said.</p><p>“我还活着哩，”她反驳了一句。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You can see." Amaranta úrsula said, suppressing her laughter, "that she's not even breathing."</p><p>“你瞧，”阿玛兰塔·乌苏娜抑住笑声说：“呼吸都没有啦。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm talking!" úrsula shouted.</p><p>“我不是在讲话吗？”乌苏娜叫道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"She can't even talk," Aureli-ano said. "She died like a little cricket."</p><p>“连话也讲不动啦！”奥雷连诺·布恩蒂亚说。“象一支蜡烛燃尽了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Then úrsula gave in to the evidence. "My God," she exclaimed in a low voice. "So this is what it's like to be dead." She started an endless, stumbling, deep prayer that lasted more than two days, and that by Tuesday had degenerated into a hodgepodge of requests to God and bits of practical advice to stop the red ants from bringing the house down, to keep the lamp burning by Remedios' daguerreotype, and never to let any Buendía marry a person of the same blood because their children would be born with the tail of a pig. Aureli-ano Segun-do tried to take advantage of her delirium to get her to ten him where the gold was buried, but his entreaties were useless once more "When the owner appears," úrsula said, "God will illuminate him so that he will find it." Santa Sofía de la Piedad had the certainty that they would find her dead from one moment to the next, because she noticed during those days a certain confusion in nature: the roses smelled like goosefoot, a pod of chick peas fell down and the beans lay on the ground in a perfect geometrical pattern in the shape of a starfish and one night she saw a row of luminous orange disks pass across the sky.</p><p>在这明确的事实面前，乌苏娜只好屈服。“我的天呀！”她轻轻地感叹一声。“这就是死吗？”她不由得开始念祷文，这是一篇毫无联系的长祷文，持续了两天多，直到星期二终于变成了杂乱无章的呓语：有向上帝的呼吁，也有殷切的教诲：要消灭红蚂蚁啦，否则房子就会轰隆一声倒塌；别让雷麦黛丝圣像前的神灯灭掉啦，别让布恩蒂亚家的任何一个人娶亲戚作妻子啦，不然生出的儿女会有一条猪尾巴。奥雷连诺第二总想利用她的呓语状态探出金子藏放的地方，可是他的一次次纠缠都无收获。“等主人回来以后，”乌苏娜说，“上帝会启示他，让他找到财宝的。”圣索菲娅·德拉佩德确信乌苏娜随时都可能与世长辞，因为这几天自然界出现了一些不可理解的现象：玫瑰花忽然散发出阵阵苦艾味儿；圣索菲娅·德拉佩德不小心碰倒一只南瓜形碟子，碟子里撒落下来的菜豆种子在地板上组成一幅精确的海星几何图；有一天夜里，天空中骤然掠过一长串橙黄色的小光盘。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They found her dead on the morning of Good Friday. The last time that they had helped her calculate her age, during the time the banana company, she had estimated it as between one hundred fifteen and one hundred twenty-two. They buried her in a coffin that was not much larger than the basket in which Aureli-ano had arrived, and very few people were at the funeral, partly because there wet not many left who remembered her, and partly because it was so hot that noon that the birds in their confusion were running into walls like day pigeons and breaking through screens to die in the bedrooms.</p><p>果然，在那稣蒙难周的星期四清早，乌苏娜去世了。在乌苏娜最后一次想靠家人帮助计算她究竟活了多少岁时当时香蕉公司还在，她就算过自己不小于一百一十五岁，但也不大于一百二十二岁。最后她被安放在一口小小的棺材里，棺材尺寸只比奥雷连诺·布恩蒂亚睡过的摇篮稍大一点儿。参加葬礼的人寥寥无几，一则是许多人都已忘记了乌苏娜，二则是天气发疯似的热，那天晌午热得那么厉害，竟使鸟儿都迷失了方向：有的象一颗颗子弹飞快地钻进屋里，有的穿过窗上的铁丝网，死在一间间卧室里。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>At first they thought it was a plague. Housewives were exhausted from sweeping away so many dead birds, especially at siesta time, and the men dumped them into the river by the cartload. On Easter Sunday the hundred--year-old Father Antonio Isabel stated from the pulpit that the death of the birds was due to the evil influence of the Wandering Jew, whom he himself had seen the night before. He described him as a cross between a billy goat and a female heretic, an infernal beast whose breath scorched the air and whose look brought on the birth of monsters in newlywed women. There were not many who paid attention to his apocalyptic talk, for the town was convinced that the priest was rambling because of his age. But one woman woke everybody up at dawn on Wednesday because she found the tracks of a biped with a cloven hoof. They were so clear and unmistakable that those who went to look at them had no doubt about the existence of a fearsome creature similar to the one described by the parish priest and they got together to set traps in their courtyards. That was how they managed to capture it. Two weeks after úrsula's death, Petra Cotes and Aureli-ano Segun-do woke up frightened by the especially loud bellowing of a calf that was coming from nearby. When they got there a group of men were already pulling the monster off the sharpened stakes they had set in the bottom of a pit covered with dry leaves, and it stopped lowing. It was as heavy as an ox in spite of the fact that it was no taller than a young steer, and a green and greasy liquid flowed from its wounds. Its body was covered with rough hair, plagued with small ticks, and the skin was hardened with the scales of a remora fish, but unlike the priest's description, its human parts were more like those of a sickly angel than a man, for its hands were tense and agile, its eyes large and gloomy, and on its shoulder blades it had the scarredover and calloused stumps of powerful wings which must have been chopped off by a woodsman's ax. They hung it to an almond tree in the square by its ankles so that everyone could see it, and when it began to rot they burned it in a bonfire, for they could not determine whether its bastard nature was that of an animal to be thrown into the river or a human being to be buried. It was never established whether it had really caused the death of the birds, but the newly married women did not bear the predicted monsters, nor did the intensity the heat decrease.</p><p>最初，人们都认为鸟是死于瘟疫的。家庭主妇们忙拿出全身的劲儿，清扫房间里的死鸟，午休的时候鸟死得特别多：男人们则一车一车地把死鸟扔下河去。在明朗的基督复活节那一天，百岁神父安东尼奥·伊萨贝尔忽然在讲台上宣告说，他昨天夜里曾亲眼看见一个流浪的犹太人把瘟疫传到了鸟身上，他把流浪的犹太人描绘成一个公山羊和女异教徒的杂种，一个面目可憎的怪物，他的气息能使空气变得滚烫，他的出现能使年轻女人身怀怪胎。这些启示性的说教，并没有多少人当真，因为整个市镇的人都已确信，这位教区牧师由于年老变成了疯子。可是星期二清晨，一个妇女拼命的喊声把左邻右舍都惊醒起来，她发现了一些分成两瓣的爪印，这些爪印既清晰又鲜明，不知是属于哪一种两足动物的，凡是看到它们的人，谁也不怀疑它们是神父描绘的那种可怕的怪物留下的。于是每一家的院子里都设置了陷阱，没过多少日子，神秘的外来者就被逮住了，在乌苏娜死后两星期的一天半夜里，隔壁院子突然传来一阵吓人的恸哭声，犹如一头小公牛的哞哞叫声，吵醒了佩特娜·柯特和奥雷连诺第二。他俩连忙跑出去看到底发生了什么事，只见一群男人已把怪物从原先插在洞底、用于树叶遮住的尖桩上拖了下来，怪物再也不会叫了。它象一头大公牛那样吊挂着，尽管它的身材并没超过一个未成年的小孩子；伤口流着粘乎乎的绿血，全身都是爬满壁虱的粗毛和疥癣。跟神父看见的那个怪物不同的是，它的身体有些部分象人；但与其说它象人，还不如说它更象孱弱的天使；它有一双干净纤细的手，一对眼睛又大又朦胧，两个肩胛上伤痕累累、长着老茧的部分显然是樵夫用斧头砍断的一对翅膀的残余。为了使大家都能看到这个怪物，人们又把尸体倒挂在广场的一棵杏树上。等它开始腐烂时，就点起一堆火把它烧掉了，因为无法肯定：这个败类如果是个动物，就该扔到河里，如果是个基督徒，理应享受棺葬。就这样，人们依然不清楚鸟儿是否真的死在它手里；不过，正象神父所预言的，从此没有一个新娘不身怀怪胎，炎热也始终不见减退。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Rebeca died at the end of that year. Argénida, her lifelong servant, asked the authorities for help to knock down the door to the bedroom where her mistress had been locked in for three days, and they found her, on her solitary bed, curled up like a shrimp, with her head bald from ringworm and her finger in her mouth. Aureli-ano Segun-do took charge of the funeral and tried to restore the house in order to sell it, but the destruction was so far advanced in it that the walls became scaly as soon as they were painted and there was not enough mortar to stop the weeds from cracking the floors the ivy from rotting the beams.</p><p>年底，雷贝卡相继去世。三天前她就把自己锁在卧室里，跟随她多年的女仆阿金尼达不得不向当局提出破门的请求。门一打开，只见雷贝卡歪着由于生癣而秃了顶的脑袋，躺在自己那张孤零零的床上，象小虾似地蜷缩着身子，嘴里还含着自己的一只大拇指。奥雷连诺第二独自承担了安葬事宜，他想把她的屋子整修一下，卖掉它。无奈这间屋子里渗透了毁灭的气息：油漆刚一涂上墙壁，就又剥落下来，用厚厚的一层石灰水也无法阻挡；杂草冒出了地面；房柱在闷热的常春藤包围中一根一根地腐烂。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>That was how everything went after the deluge. The indolence of the people was in contrast to the voracity of oblivion, which little by little was undermining memories in a pitiless way, to such an extreme that at that time, on another anniversary of the Treaty of Neerlandia, some emissaries from the president of the republic arrived in Macon-do to award at last the decoration rejected several times by Colonel Aureli-ano Buendía, and they spent a whole afternoon looking for someone who could tell them where they could find one of his descendants. Aureli-ano Segun-do was tempted to accept it, thinking that it was a medal of solid gold, but Petra Cotes convinced him that it was not proper when the emissaries already had some proclamations and speeches ready for the ceremony. It was also around that time that the gypsies returned, the last heirs to Melquíades' science, and they found the town so defeated and its inhabitants so removed from the rest of the world that once more they went through the houses dragging magnetized ingots as if that really were the Babylonian wise men's latest discovery, and once again they concentrated the sun's rays with the giant magnifying glass, and there was no lack of people standing open-mouthed watching kettles fall and pots roll and who paid fifty cents to be startled as a gypsy woman put in her false teeth took them out again. A broken-down yellow train that neither brought anyone in nor took anyone out and that scarcely paused at the deserted station was the only thing that was left of the long train to which Mr. Brown would couple his glass-topped coach with the episcopal lounging chairs and of the fruit trains with one hundred twenty cars which took a whole afternoon to pass by. The ecclesiastical delegates who had come to investigate the report of the strange death of the birds and the sacrifice the Wandering Jew found Father Antonio Isabel playing blind man's buff with the children, and thinking that his report was the product of a hallucination, they took him off to an asylum. A short time later they sent Father Augusto Angel, a crusader of the new breed, intransigent, audacious, daring, who personally rang the bells several times a day so that the peoples spirits would not get drowsy, and who went from house to house waking up the sleepers to go to mass but before a year was out he too was conquered by the negligence that one breathed in with the air, by the hot dust that made everything old and clogged up, and by the drowsiness caused by lunchtime meatballs in the unbearable heat of siesta time.</p><p>这就是雨停后马孔多的生活。萎靡迟钝的人哪里抵得住健忘症，这种健忘症使他们逐渐忘记了所有的往事。突然，在尼兰德投降周年纪念日那天，共和国总统的几个使者奉命来到了马孔多，无论如何要把奥雷连诺上校多次拒绝的勋章授予英雄的后代。使者们为了找到一个了解这些后代踪迹的人，整整辗转了一个晚上。奥雷连诺第二差点鬼迷心窍地接受那个勋章，以为它毕竟是纯金的。佩特娜？柯特却告诫他说，这将是一种不体面的行为，他才放弃了自己的打算，尽管总统的代表们已经雇来乐队，在隆重的授勋仪式上的发言也已准备好了。就在这个时候，一些吉卜赛人最后一批继承梅尔加德斯学问的人，来到了马孔多。他们发现这个市镇荒芜不堪，它的居民跟外面的世界完全隔绝；于是吉卜赛人又拿着一块块吸铁石，把它们充作巴比伦学者的最新发明，走家串户，而且又开始用放大镜聚集阳光。有不少好奇的人张大嘴巴，盯着脸盆跳下木架，锅子向吸铁石滚去；也有不少人准备付出五十个生丁，不胜惊讶地瞧着一个吉卜赛女人从嘴里取出假牙，接着又把它装回原处。在空荡荡的火车站旁，现在只有旧式蒸汽机车停留片刻，拖着几节不载人、不载货的黄色车厢这就是昔日铁路上残留下来的一切，看不到一列客车载满旅客、挂着布劳恩先生的专用车厢，那种车厢里放着主教安乐椅，装着玻璃顶；也看不到一列货车，载着一百二十节车厢的水果，通宵达旦、络绎不绝地驶近车站。有一天，法官们来到马孔多，调查安东尼奥·伊萨贝尔神父关于离奇的瘟疫袭击鸟儿流浪的犹太人遇害的报告，正遇上可敬的神父在跟一群娃娃玩捉迷藏，他们便认定他的报告是老年人幻觉的结果，把他送进了痴人收容所。几天以后，奥古斯托·安格尔神父，一个最新炼丹术的专家，来到这个市镇，他一本正经、大胆粗鲁，一天几次亲手敲打各式各样的钟，使教徒的心灵一直处于振奋状态；他还从这一家走到那一家，唤醒一个个贪睡的人去听弥撒。然而没过一年，奥古斯托·安格尔神父就不得不承认自己失败了：他也无力抵御滞留在空气中的惰气，无力抵御滚烫的灰尘，它到处弥漫，使得一切都显出衰老的样子。热得不堪忍受的午休时刻，摆到午餐桌上的肉丸子，总要使他昏昏欲睡。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>With úrsula's death the house again fell into a neglect from which it could not be rescued even by a will as resolute and vigorous as that of Amaranta úrsula, who many years later, being a happy, modern woman without prejudices, with her feet on the ground, opened doors and windows in order to drive away the rain, restored the garden, exterminated the red ants who were already walking across the porch in broad daylight, and tried in vain to reawaken the forgotten spirit of hospitality. Fernanda's cloistered passion built in impenetrable dike against úrsula's torrential hundred years. Not only did she refuse to open doors when the arid wind passed through, but she had the windows nailed shut with boards in the shape of a cross, obeying the paternal order of being buried alive. The expensive correspondence with the invisible doctors ended in failure. After numerous postponements, she shut herself up in her room on the date and hour agreed upon, covered only by a white sheet and with her head pointed north, and at one o'clock in the morning she felt that they were covering her head with a handkerchief soaked in a glacial liquid. When she woke up the sun was shining in the window and she had a barbarous stitch in the shape of an arc that began at her crotch and ended at her sternum. But before she could complete the prescribed rest she received a disturbed letter from the invisible doctors, who mid they had inspected her for six hours without finding anything that corresponded to the symptoms so many times and so scrupulously described by her. Actually, her pernicious habit of not calling things by their names had brought about a new confusion, for the only thing that the telepathic surgeons had found was a drop in the uterus which could be corrected by the use of a pessary. The disillusioned Fernanda tried to obtain more precise information, but the unknown correspondents did not answer her letters any more. She felt so defeated by the weight of an unknown word that she decided to put shame behind her and ask what a pessary was, and only then did she discover that the French doctor had hanged himself to a beam three months earlier and had been buried against the wishes the townspeople by a former companion in arms of Colonel Aureli-ano Buendía. Then she confided in her son José Arcadio and the latter sent her the pessaries from Rome along with a pamphlet explaining their use, which she flushed down the toilet after committing it to memory so that no one would learn the nature of her troubles. It was a useless precaution because the only people who lived in the house scarcely paid any attention to her. Santa Sofía de la Piedad was wandering about in her solitary old age, cooking the little that they ate and almost completely dedicated to the care of José Arcadio Segun-do. Amaranta úrsula, who had inherited certain attractions of Remedios the Beauty, spent the time that she had formerly wasted tormenting úrsula at her schoolwork, and she began to show good judgment and a dedication to study that brought back to Aureli-ano Segun-do the high hopes that Meme had inspired in him. He had promised her to send her to finish her studies in Brussels, in accord with a custom established during the time of the banana company, and that illusion had brought to attempt to revive the lands devastated by the deluge. The few times that he appeared at the house were for Amaranta úrsula, because with time he had become a stranger to Fernan-da and little Aureli-ano was becoming withdrawn as he approached puberty. </p><p>乌苏娜死后，整座房子又变成了废墟。即使象阿玛兰塔乌苏娜这么一个刚强的人，再过许多年也不可能把房子从废墟中搭救出来。那时，她将是一个成年妇女，毫无偏见，快快活活，富有时代感，脚踏实地，却依然不可能敞开门窗，驱散毁灭的气氛，不可能重建家园，不可能消灭在大白天放肆地顺着长廊爬行的红蚂蚁，不可能使布恩蒂亚家恢复那种已经消失的好客精神；这个家庭对闭关自守的偏爱，犹如一个不可逾越的拦河坝，屹立在乌苏娜风风雨雨的百年生活道路上，也占据了菲兰达的心灵。在热风停息之后，菲兰达不但拒不同意打开房门，还叫人把一个个木十字架钉在窗棂上，为的是遵从父母的遗教，活生生地埋葬自己。她跟没有见过的医生之间代价高昂的通信，也以彻底失败告终。在月经多次延期之后，菲兰达便在规定的那一天、那个时刻，把自己锁在自己的卧室里，头朝北躺在床上，全身只盖一条白被单。到了半夜，她忽然感到有一条不知用什么冰冷的液体浸湿的餐布搁在自己脸上，醒来以后，只见太阳照进了窗户，她那肚子上的一块弧形伤疤正在泛红－一从腹股沟开始，一直红到胸骨。可是，早在规定的手术休息期还没过去之前，菲兰达就收到没有见过的医生一封令人不愉快的来信。信中告诉她说，他们曾为她作过一次仔细的检查，检查持续了六小时，但是没有发现她的内脏有任何毛病能够引起她不止一次十分详尽地描述过的那些症状。菲兰达总是不爱说出任何东西的名称，这个坏习惯又使她上了当，心灵感应术的医生唯一发现的是子宫下垂，即使不动手术，靠宫托的帮助也能治愈。灰心丧气的菲兰达希望得到更明确的诊断，谁知那些没有见过的医生却不再回她的信。她心里对“宫托”这个不可理解的词儿感到沉重，便决定不顾羞愧去问那位法国医生，宫托究竟是什么东西。这时她才听说法国医生在三个月前吊死在仓库横梁上了，奥雷连诺上校的一个老战友违背大家的意愿，把他埋葬在坟地上。于是，菲兰达只好依靠自己的儿子，儿子从罗马给她寄来一些宫托和一份使用说明书。菲兰达开头还背诵这份说明书，后来为了对所有的人隐瞒自己的病情，又把它扔进了厕所。其实，这是一种不必要的预防措施，因为这座房子里的最后几个人根本就不注意菲兰达。圣索菲娅·德拉佩德沉湎在孤独的老年生活中，除了为全家做点简单的午餐，她把其它的时间都用来照料霍·阿卡蒂奥第二了。在一定程度上继承了俏姑娘雷麦黛丝美貌的阿玛兰塔·乌苏娜，如今也把以往用去折磨乌苏娜的时间，用来准备功课。奥雷连诺第二的女儿开始显露与众不同的聪明才智，而且特别用功。这些素质使她父亲心里又产生了从前梅梅在他心里引起过的那些希望。他答应阿玛兰塔·乌苏娜，要按照香蕉公司时期的惯例，送她到布鲁塞尔去完成学业。这个理想使他又想耕耘洪水冲毁的土地。不过，人们难得在家里看到他，他只是为了阿玛兰塔·乌苏娜才去那儿，因为对菲兰达来说，随着时光的流逝，他已成了外人。那个已成青年的小奥雷连诺也越来越热衷于与世隔绝的孤独生活。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Aureli-ano Segun-do had faith that Fernanda's heart would soften with old age so that the child could join in the life of the town where no one certainly would make any effort to speculate suspiciously about his origins. But Aureli-ano himself seemed to prefer the cloister of solitude and he did not show the least desire to know the world that began at the street door of the house. When úrsula had the door of Melquíades' room opened he began to linger about it, peeping through the half-opened door, and no one knew at what moment he became close to José Arcadio Segun-do in a link of mutual affection. Aureli-ano Segun-do discovered that friendship a long time after it had begun, when he heard the child talking about the killing at the station. It happened once when someone at the table complained about the ruin into which the town had sunk when the banana company had abandoned it, and Aureli-ano contradicted him with maturity and with the vision of a grown person. His point of view, contrary to the general interpretation, was that Macon-do had been a prosperous place and well on its way until it was disordered and corrupted and suppressed by the banana company, whose engineers brought on the deluge as a pretext to avoid promises made to the workers. Speaking with such good sense that to Fernanda he was like a sacrilegious parody of Jews among the wise men, the child described with precise and convincing details how the army had machine-gunned more than three thousand workers penned up by the station and how they loaded the bodies onto a two-hundred-car train and threw them into the sea. Convinced as most people were by the official version that nothing had happened, Fernanda was scandalized with the idea that the child had inherited the anarchist ideas of Colonel Aureli-ano Buendía and told him to be quiet. Aureli-ano Segun-do, on the othand, recognized his twin brother's version. Actually, in spite the fact that everyone considered him mad, José Arcadio Segun-do was at that time the most lucid inhabitant of the house. He taught little Aureli-ano how to read and write, initiated him in the study of the parchments, and he inculcated him with such a personal interpretation of what the banana company had meant to Macon-do that many years later, when Aureli-ano became part of the world, one would have thought that he was telling a hallucinated version, because it was radically opposed to the false one that historians had created and consecrated in the schoolbooks. </p><p>奥雷连诺第二相信，菲兰达迟早会由于年老软下心来，让没有得到承认的孙子投身到城市生活中去：在城市里，当然谁也不会想去翻他的家谱。但小奥雷连诺显然爱上了远离尘嚣的孤独生活，他从未表示任何一点愿望，去认识家门以外的世界。乌苏娜叫人打开梅尔加德斯的房间之后，他便开始在这个房间附近转来转去，不时往门缝里窥视，不知什么时候，也不知怎的，他忽然跟霍·阿卡蒂奥第二相互交谈起来，彼此十分同情，成了朋友。过了许多个星期，有一天小奥雷连诺讲起火车站上的血腥大屠杀，奥雷连诺第二这才发现了他俩建立的友谊。那一天，不知是谁在桌子旁边对撇下马孔多的香蕉公司表示惋惜，因为从那时起，这个市镇就开始走下坡路；小奥雷连诺立即跟他争论起来，他的话使人感到他简直象是一个善于表达思想的成年人。他的观点跟一般人的看法不同，他认为，要不是香蕉公司使马孔多偏离了正确的轨道，让它受到了毒化，把它劫掠一空，而且香蕉公司的工程师们不愿向工人们让步，又酿起一场大水，那么马孔多准是一个有着伟大前途的城镇。小奥雷连诺还谈到了一些确凿可靠的详细情节：军队怎样用机枪打死一群聚集在车站上的工人总共有三千多人，怎样把尸体装上一列有二百节车厢的火车，把他们扔到海里，他讲得头头是道，但在菲兰达看来，他的话无异是读书人亵渎耶稣的污秽言词。跟大多数人一样，她深信不疑的是官方的报导，他们说车站广场上似乎什么事也没发生。她有点反感地认为这孩子继承了奥雷连诺上校无政府主义的倾向，便叫他闭起嘴来。相反地，奥雷连诺第二却证实了孪生兄弟的话是可靠的。实际上，被人看做疯子的霍·阿卡蒂奥第二，当时是家里所有的人中最有头脑的人，是他教会小奥雷连诺读书写字的，是他引导这孩子研究羊皮纸手稿的，也是他向这孩子灌输自己的见解的，是他说香蕉公司给马孔多带来灾难的，他的这种见解跟历史学家们采纳的、教科书中阐述的那种习惯说法迎然不同。不知过了多少年，当小奥雷连诺长大成人时，大家还把他的话错当成一种谬论。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In the small isolated room where the arid air never penetrated, nor the dust, nor the heat, both had the atavistic vision of an old man, his back to the window, wearing a hat with a brim like the wings of a crow who spoke about the world many years before they had been born. Both described at the same time how it was always March there and always Monday, and then they understood that José Arcadio Buendía was not as crazy as the family said, but that he was the only one who had enough lucidity to sense the truth of the fact that time also stumbled and had accidents and could therefore splinter and leave an eternalized fragment in a room. José Arcadio Segun-do had managed, furthermore, to classify the cryptic letters of the parchments. He was certain that they corresponded to an alphabet of forty-seven to fifty-three characters, which when separated looked like scratching and scribbling, and which in the fine hand of Melquíades looked like pieces of clothing put out to dry on a line. Aureli-ano remembered having seen a similar table in the English encyclopedia, so he brought it to the room to compare it with that of José Arcadio Segun-do. They were indeed the same.</p><p>在热风、灰尘和炎热都渗透不进的小房间里，他俩还回忆起很久以前一个幽灵似的老头儿，戴着一顶乌鸦翅膀似的宽边帽，背朝窗户坐在这儿说古道今，他俩同时发现，在这个房间里，始终是三月，始终是星期一。这时，他俩才明白全家把霍·阿·布恩蒂亚看成疯子是错误的，恰恰相反，他是家里唯一头脑清醒的人，清楚地了解这样一个真理：时间在自己的运动中也会碰到挫折，遇到障碍，所以某一段时间也会滞留在哪一个房间里。另外，霍·阿卡蒂奥第二还给羊皮纸手稿的密码符号分了类，把它们排成一张表。他深信，这张表相当于四十六个到五十三个字母组成的字母表，这些字母单独写出来就象小蜘蛛和小壁虱，把它们联成行又象是晒在铅丝上的内衣。小奥雷连诺不由得想起自己曾在英国百科全书里见到过这类东西，便把书拿来比较了一下，两张表果然相符。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Around the time of the riddle lottery, Aureli-ano Segun-do began waking up with a knot in his throat, as if he were repressing a desire to weep. Petra Cotes interpreted it as one more of so many upsets brought on by the bad situation, and every morning for over a year she would touch his palate with a dash of honey and give him some radish syrup. When the knot in his throat became so oppressive that it was difficult for him to breathe, Aureli-ano Segun-do visited Pilar Ternera to see if she knew of some herb that would give him relief. The dauntless grandmother, who had reached a hundred years of age managing a small, clandestine brothel, did not trust therapeutic superstitions, so she turned the matter over to her cards. She saw the queen of diamonds with her throat wounded by the steel of the jack of spades, and she deduced that Fernanda was trying to get her husband back home by means the discredited method of sticking pins into his picture but that she had brought on an internal tumor because clumsy knowledge of the black arts. Since Aureli-ano Segun-do had no other pictures except those of his wedding and the copies were all in the family album, he kept searching all through the house when his wife was not looking, and finally, in the bottom of the dresser, he came across a half-dozen pessaries in their original boxes. Thinking that the small red rubber rings were objects witchcraft he put them in his pocket so that Pilar Ternera could have a look at them. She could not determine their nature, but they looked so suspicious to her that in any case she burned them in a bonfire she built in the courtyard. In order to conjure away Fernanda's alleged curse, she told Aureli-ano Segun-do that he should soak a broody hen and bury her alive under the chestnut tree, and he did it with such good faith that when he finished hiding the turned-up earth with dried leaves he already felt that he was breathing better. For part, Fernanda interpreted the disappearance as a reprisal by the invisible doctors and she sewed a pocket of casing to the inside of her camisole where she kept the new pessaries that son sent her.</p><p>在奥雷连诺第二打算推行谜语抽彩的时候，每天早上他都觉得咽喉有点发紧，似乎那儿有一口痰卡住了。佩特娜·柯特断定这只是恶劣的天气引起的一种不舒服之感，便在每天早上拿一把小刷子给他的上颚抹一层蜂蜜和萝卜汁，抹了一年多。不料奥雷连诺第二咽喉里的肿瘤越长越大，连呼吸都开始发生困难，他只好去拜访皮拉·苔列娜，问她知不知道有什么草药能治肿瘤。他的这位曾在妓院里当过老鸨的外祖母，精神矍铄，已经活到一百岁，却依然把医学看成一种迷信。她连忙向纸牌请教。抽出的一张是被黑桃杰克的长剑刺中咽喉的红桃老开，占卜老妇由此推论，菲兰达在丈夫的照片上扎了一根别针，想靠这种陈旧的方式迫使他回家，可她又缺乏巫术知识，这就引起了丈夫体内的肿瘤。除了完整地保存在家庭影集里的那些结婚照片之外，奥雷连诺第二记不得他还有什么照片，就瞒着自己的妻子，翻遍了整座房子，只在五斗橱的深处发现了半打包装特殊的宫托。他以为这些橡皮制的漂亮玩意儿准跟巫术有关，连忙在口袋里藏了一只，拿去给皮拉·苔列娜看。皮拉·苔列娜也不能断定这种神秘玩意儿的用途和性质，不过觉得它们实在令人可疑，便叫奥雷连诺第二把半打宫托都拿来给她，为了以防万一，她在院子里生起一堆火，把它们烧了个精光。她建议奥雷连诺第二抓一只生蛋的母鸡，往鸡身上撒尿，然后把它活埋在栗树下面的泥地里，就可以消除菲兰达可能造成的灾害。奥雷连诺第二由衷地相信事情准会成功，就采纳了这些建议。他刚给掘出的土坑盖上一层干树叶，就感到呼吸好象顺畅些了。不明真相的菲兰达把宫托的失踪解释成没有见过的医生对她的报复，就赶紧在内衣背面缝上一只贴身口袋，把儿子寄给她的一些新宫托藏在里面。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Six months after he had buried the hen, Aureli-ano Segun-do woke up at midnight with an attack coughing and the feeling that he was being strangled within by the claws of a crab. It was then that he understood that for all of the magical pessaries that he destroyed and all the conjuring hens that he soaked, the single and sad piece of truth was that he was dying. He did not tell anyone. Tormented by the fear of dying without having sent Amaranta úrsula to Brussels, he worked as he had never done, and instead of one he made three weekly raffles. From very early in the morning he could be seen going through the town, even in the most outlying and miserable sections, trying to sell tickets with an anxiety that could only be conceivable in a dying man. "Here's Divine Providence," he hawked. "Don't let it get away, because it only comes every hundred years." He made pitiful efforts to appear gay, pleasant, talkative, but it was enough to see his sweat and paleness to know that his heart was not in it. Sometimes he would go to vacant lots, where no one could see him, and sit down to rest from the claws that were tearing him apart inside. Even at midnight he would be in the red-light district trying to console with predictions of good luck the lonely women who were weeping beside their phonographs. "This number hasn't come up in four months," he told them, showing them the tickets. "Don't let it get away, life is shorter than you think." They finally lost respect for him, made fun of him, and in his last months they no longer called him Don Aureli-ano, as they had always done, but they called him Mr. Divine Providence right to his face. His voice was becoming filled with wrong notes. It was getting out of tune, and it finally diminished into the growl of a dog, but he still had the drive to see that there should be no diminishing of the hope people brought to Petra Cates's courtyard. As he lost his voice, however, and realized that in a short time he would be unable to bear the pain, he began to understand that it was not through raffled pigs and goats that his daughter would get to Brussels, so he conceived the idea of organizing the fabulous raffle the lands destroyed by the deluge, which could easily be restored by a person the money to do so. It was such a spectacular undertaking that the mayor himself lent his aid by announcing it in a proclamation, and associations were formed to buy tickets at one hundred pesos apiece and they were sold out in less than a week. The night of the raffle the winners held a huge celebration, comparable only to those of the good days of the banana company, Aureli-ano Segun-do, for the last time, played the forgotten songs of Francisco the Man on the accordion, but he could no longer sing them.</p><p>奥雷连诺第二活埋抱蛋母鸡之后过了六个月，一天半夜里，他咳嗽一阵醒了过来，感到似乎有一只大蟹在用铁螯乱挟他的内脏。这时他才开始明白，不管他烧掉了多少今人迷惑的宫托，也不管他在多少母鸡身上撒尿，他照样面临着死亡，这才是唯一确凿而又可悲的现实。他没向任何人透露这个想法。由于担心死亡可能在他送阿玛兰塔·乌苏娜去布鲁塞尔之前来临，他不由得拿出一生中从未有过的劲头，一星期搞了三次抽彩，代替过去的一次抽彩，天还没亮，他就起床，怀着只有即将死亡的人才能理解的痛苦心情，跑遍了全镇，连最偏僻、最贫穷的居民区也不放过，一心想把自己的小彩票卖光。“请看天意呀！”他一路叫喊。“不要错过机会，百年才有一次呀！\"他令人感动地装出一副高高兴兴、彬彬有礼、十分健谈的样子，但从他那沁出汗珠的死灰色脸上，一眼就可看出，他很快就不再是这个世界上的居民了，那对正在折磨他内脏的蟹螯使他不得不偶尔溜到一块荒地上去，避开旁人的目光，坐下来喘一口气，哪怕只有一分钟也好。可是半夜里，一想到在那些酒吧旁边长吁短叹的孤身女人身上可能赚得一大笔钱，他就又起床，在人们寻欢作乐的那条街上转来转去。”请看，这个号码已经四个月没有人抽到了！“他指着自己的彩票向她们说。”不要错过机会，生命比我们想象的还短促呀：“最后，大家失去了对他的敬意，开始挖苦他；在他一生的最后几个月里，人家再也不象从前那样尊敬地称他”奥雷连诺先生，，而是毫不客气地当面叫他“天意先生”。他的嗓音也变得越来越微弱、低沉，终于变成了狗的嘶叫声。虽然奥雷连诺第二还能在佩特娜·柯特的院子里保持人们对发奖的兴趣，但是由于嗓门越来越低，疼痛日益加剧，眼看就要痛得不堪忍受，他就越来越明白拿猪和山羊来抽彩也不能帮助他的女儿去布鲁塞尔了。这时他忽然想出一个主意，搞一次神话般的抽彩：把自己那块被大水冲毁的土地作为奖品，反正有钱的人可以想法平整土地。这个主意对每一个人都有诱惑力。镇长亲自用特别通告宣布了这次抽彩，每张彩票一百个比索，人们一群群地组织起来，合伙购买彩票，不到一个星期，全部彩票就销售一空。一天晚上，发奖以后，那些走运的人举行了一次豪华的酒会，有点象从前香蕉公司鼎盛时期热闹的庆祝会，奥雷连诺第二最后一次用手风琴演奏了弗兰西斯科人的歌曲，只是他再也不能唱这些歌了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Two months later Amaranta úrsula went to Brussels. Aureli-ano Segun-do gave her not only the money from the special raffle, but also what he had managed to put aside over the previous months and what little he had received from the sale of the pianola, the clavichord, and other junk that had fallen into disrepair. According to his calculations, that sum would be enough for her studies, so that all that was lacking was the price of her fare back home. Fernanda was against the trip until the last moment, scandalized by the idea that Brussels was so close to Paris and its perdition, but she calmed down with the letter that Father Angel gave addressed to a boardinghouse run by nuns for Catholic young ladies where Amaranta úrsula promised to stay until her studies were completed. Furthermore, the parish priest arranged for her to travel under the care of a group of Franciscan nuns who were going to Toledo, where they hoped to find dependable people to accompany her to Belgium. While the urgent correspondence that made the coordination possible went forward, Aureli-ano Segun-do, aided by Petra Cates, prepared Amaranta úrsula's baggage. The night on which they were packing one Fernanda's bridal trunks, the things were so well organized that the school-girl knew by heart which were the suits and cloth slippers she could wear crossing the Atlantic and the blue cloth coat with copper buttons and the cordovan shoes she would wear when she landed. She also knew how to walk so as not to fall into the water as she went up the gangplank, that at no time was she to leave the company of the nuns or leave cabin except to eat, and that for no reason was she to answer the questions asked by people of any sex while they were at sea. She carried a small bottle with drops for seasickness and a notebook written by Father Angel in his own hand containing six prayers to be used against storms. Fernan-da made her a canvas belt to keep her money in, and she would not have to take it off even to sleep. She tried to give her the chamberpot, washed out with lye and disinfected with alcohol, but Amaranta úrsula refused it for fear that her schoolmates would make fun her. A few months later, at the hour of his death, Aureli-ano Segun-do would remember her as he had seen for the last time as she tried unsuccessfully to lower the window of the second-class coach to hear Fernanda's last piece of advice. She was wearing a pink silk dress with a corsage of artificial pansies pinned to her left shoulder, cordovan shoes with buckles and low heels, and sateen stockings held up at the thighs with elastic garters. Her body was slim, her hair loose and long, she had the lively eyes that úrsula had had at her age and the way in which she said goodbye, without crying but without smiling either, revealed the same strength of character. </p><p>两个月后，阿玛兰塔·乌苏娜准备去布鲁塞尔。奥雷连诺第二交给女儿的钱，不仅有他从不同寻常的抽彩中赚得的一切，而且包括他在一生的最后几个月里的全部积蓄，还有他卖掉自动钢琴、旧式风琴和各种不再讨人喜欢的旧家具所得到的一小笔钱。根据他的计算，这些钱足够她整个念书时期花销，不清楚的只有一点，回来的路费是不是够。菲兰达一想到布鲁塞尔距离罪恶的巴黎那么近，内心深处就冒火，她坚决反对女儿的布鲁塞尔之行。不过安格尔神父的一封推荐信使她心里又平静了。信是写给一个修道院附设的天主教女青年寄宿中学的，这个学校答应阿玛兰塔·乌苏娜在那儿一直住到学习结束。另外，神父还找到一群去托莱多的圣芳济派的修女，她们同意带着姑娘一起去，在托莱多再给她联系直接到布鲁塞尔去的可靠旅伴。当这件事正在书来信往地加紧进行时，奥雷连诺第二就在佩特娜·柯特的帮助下，为阿玛兰塔·乌苏娜作准备。等到那天晚上，她的东西放进菲兰达年轻时放置嫁妆的一只大箱子以后，一切都已考虑周到了，未来的女大学生也已记住：该穿怎样的衣服和绒布拖鞋横渡大西洋；她上岸时要穿的配有铜钮扣的天蓝色呢大衣和那双精制的山羊皮鞋应当放在哪儿。她又牢牢地记住，从舷梯上船时应该怎样迈步，免得摔到水里；记住自己不可离开那些女修士一步，记住自己只能吃饭时走出自己的船舱；在公海上，无论遇到怎样的景致，她都不该回答男男女女可能向她提出的一切问题。她随身带了一瓶预防晕船的药水和一个小本子，小本子上有安格尔神父亲笔记的六段抵御暴风雨的祷词。菲兰达给她缝了一条藏钱的帆布腰带，并且示范了一下怎样束在腰里，晚上也可以不取下来；她还想送给女儿一只金便盆，是用漂白剂洗净、用酒精消过毒的，可是阿玛兰塔·乌苏娜没有接受她的礼品，说她担心大学里的女同学会取笑她。再过几个月，奥雷连诺第二在临死的床上将回忆起的女儿，就跟他最后一次见到的阿玛兰塔·乌苏娜一样。她身穿一件粉红色绸上衣，右肩上别着一朵假三色茧，脚上穿着一双精制的薄膜平底的山羊皮鞋和一双有橡皮圆吊带的丝袜。她身材不高，披着长头发，她那滴溜溜的目光，就象乌苏娜年轻时的目光，她那既无眼泪又无笑容的告别举止，证明她继承了高祖母的坚毅性格。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Walking beside the coach as it picked up speed holding Fernanda by the arm so that she would not stumble, Aureli-ano scarcely had time to wave at his daughter as she threw him a kiss with the tips of her fingers. The couple stood motionless under the scorching sun, looking at the train as it merged with the black strip of the horizon, linking arms for the first time since the day of their wedding.</p><p>她听完菲兰达最后的教诲，没来得及放下二等车厢那扇满是灰尘的玻璃窗，列车就开动了。随着列车速度的逐渐加快，奥雷连诺第二也加紧了脚步，他在列车旁边小跑，拉着菲兰达的一只手，免得她跌跤。女儿用手指尖向他投来一个飞吻，他好不容易赶了上去，挥了挥手，表示回答。一对老夫妇一动不动地长久站在灼人的太阳下，望着列车怎样变成地平线上的一个小黑点。他们婚后还是头一次手携着手地站在一起哩。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>On the ninth of August, before they received the first letter from Brussels, José Arcadio Segun-do was speaking to Aureli-ano in Melquíades' room and, without realizing it, he said:</p><p>八月九日，布鲁塞尔来的第一封信还没到达之前，霍·阿卡蒂奥第二在梅尔加德斯的房间里跟小奥雷连诺谈话，谈着谈着，他就前言不搭后语地说：</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Always remember that they were more than three thousand and that they were thrown into the sea."</p><p>“你要永远记住：他们有三千多人，全部扔进了海里。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Then he fell back on the parchments and died with his eyes open. At that same instant, in Fernanda's bed, his twin brother came to the end of the prolonged and terrible martyrdom of the steel crabs that were eating his throat away. One week previously he had returned home, without any voice, unable to breathe, and almost skin and bones, with his wandering trunks and his wastrel's accordion, to fulfill the promise of dying beside his wife. Petra Cotes helped him pack his clothes and bade him farewell without shedding a tear, but she forgot to give him the patent leather shoes that he wanted to wear in his coffin. So when she heard that he had died, she dressed in black, wrapped the shoes up in a newspaper, and asked Fernanda for permission to see the body. Fernanda would not let through the door.</p><p>说完，他便一头扑倒在羊皮纸手稿上，睁着眼睛死了。同一时刻，在菲兰达床上也结束了一场长时间的痛苦斗争，那是霍·阿卡蒂奥第二的孪生兄弟跟挟住他咽喉的蟹螯之间进行的一场斗争。一星期之前，皮包骨的奥雷连诺第二带着自己的旅行箱和破手风琴，悄然无声地回到了父母亲的房子里，他是回来履行自己死在妻子身旁的诺言的。佩特娜·柯特帮他收拾好了衣服，一滴眼泪也没落，就跟他分了手，但是忘记把他躺在棺材里要穿的一双漆皮鞋装进旅行箱了。所以，在知道奥雷连诺第二去世之后，她穿上丧服，用报纸把漆皮鞋包好，便来要求菲兰达同意她跟遗体告别，菲兰达连门坎都不让她跨过。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Put yourself in my place," Petra Cotes begged. "Imagine how much I must have loved him to put up with this humiliation."</p><p>“请您为我考虑考虑吧，”佩特娜·柯特恳求她。“我这么屈辱地来，可见我多么爱他。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"There is no humiliation that a concubine does not deserve," Fernanda replied. "So wait until another one of your men dies and put the shoes on him."</p><p>“姘头活该受到这种屈辱，”菲兰达答道。“跟你睡过觉的许多男人中间，还有人要死的，你就等他死时拿这双皮鞋给他穿吧。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In fulfillment of her promise, Santa Sofía de la Piedad cut the throat of José Arcadio Segun-do's corpse with a kitchen knife to be sure that they would not bury him alive. The bodies were placed in identical coffins, then it could be seen that once more in death they had become as Identical as they had been until adolescence. Aureli-ano Segun-do's old carousing comrades laid on his casket a wreath that had a purple ribbon with the words: Cease, cows, life is short. Fernanda was so indignant with such irreverence that she had the wreath thrown onto the trash heap. In the tumult of the last moment, the sad drunkards who carried them out of the house got the coffins mixed up and buried them in the wrong graves.</p><p>为了履行自己的誓言，圣索菲娅·德拉佩德拿来一把菜刀，割断霍·阿卡蒂奥第二尸体的喉管，这才相信他不是被活埋的。一对孪生兄弟的尸体安放在两个同样的棺材里，这时，只见他们死后又变得象青年时代那样相象了。奥雷连诺第二的酒友们在他的棺材上放了一个花圈，花圈上系着一条深紫色缎带，上面写着一句题词：“繁殖吧，母牛，生命短促呀！”这种污辱死者的行为激怒了菲兰达，她忙叫人把花圈扔到污水坑里去。几个伤心的酒徒从房子里抬出棺材，在最后一阵仓促的准备中把它们搞错了，把奥雷连诺第二的尸体埋在为霍·阿卡蒂奥第二挖掘的坟墓里，而将霍·阿卡蒂奥第二的尸体埋葬在他兄弟的坟墓里了。</p></div>
