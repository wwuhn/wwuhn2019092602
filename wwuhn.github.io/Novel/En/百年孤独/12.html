<div class='layout'><p>DAZZLED BY SO MANY and such marvelous inventions, the people of Macondo did not know where their amazement began. They stayed up all night looking at the pale electric bulbs fed by the plant that Aureliano Triste had brought back when the train made its second trip, and it took time and effort for them to grow accustomed to its obsessive toom-toom. They be. came indignant over the living images that the prosperous merchant Bruno Crespi projected in the theater with the lion-head ticket windows, for the character who had died and was buried in one film and for whose misfortune tears of affliction had been shed would reappear alive and transformed into an Arab in the next one. The audience, who paid two cents apiece to share the difficulties of the actors, would not tolerate that outlandish fraud and they broke up the seats. The mayor, at the urging of Bruno Crespi, explained in a proclamation that the cinema was a machine of illusions that did not merit the emotional outbursts of the audience. With that discouraging explanation many felt that they had been the victims of some new and showy gypsy business and they decided not to return to the movies, considering that they already had too many troubles of their own to weep over the acted-out misfortunes of imaginary beings. </p><p>马孔多居民被许多奇异的发明弄得眼花缭乱，简直来不及表示惊讶。他们望着淡白的电灯，整夜都不睡觉；电机是奥雷连诺·特里斯特第二次乘火车旅行之后带回来的，——它那无休无止的嗡嗡声，要好久才能逐渐习惯。生意兴隆的商人布鲁诺·克列斯比先生，在设有狮头式售票窗口的剧院里放映的电影，搞得马孔多的观众恼火已极，因为他们为之痛哭的人物，在一部影片里死亡和埋葬了，却在另一部影片里活得挺好，而且变成了阿拉伯人。花了两分钱去跟影片人物共命运的观众，忍受不了这种空前的欺骗，把坐椅都砸得稀烂。根据布鲁诺·克列斯比先生的坚决要求，镇长在一张布告中说明：电影机只是一种放映幻象的机器，观众不应予以粗暴的对待；许多人以为自己受了吉卜赛人新把戏的害，就决定不再去看电影了，因为自己的倒霉事儿已经够多，用不着去为假人假事流泪。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Something similar happened with the cylinder phonographs that the merry matrons from France brought with them as a substitute for the antiquated hand organs and that for a time had serious effects on the livelihood of the band of musicians. At first curiosity increased the clientele on the forbidden street and there was even word of respectable ladies who disguised themselves as workers in order to observe the novelty of the phonograph from first hand, but from so much and such close observation they soon reached the conclusion that it was not an enchanted mill as everyone had thought and as the matrons had said, but a mechanical trick that could not be compared with something so moving, so human, and so full of everyday truth as a band of musicians. It was such a serious disappointment that when phonographs became so popular that there was one in every house they were not considered objects for amusement for adults but as something good for children to take apart. On the other hand, when someone from the town had the opportunity to test the crude reality of the telephone installed in the railroad station, which was thought to be a rudimentary version of the phonograph because of its crank, even the most incredulous were upset. </p><p>快活的法国艺妓带来的留声机也出现了类似的情况，此种留声机代替了过时的手风琴，使得地方乐队的收入受到了损失，最初大家好奇，前来“禁街”(指花天酒地的街道）参观的人很多，甚至传说一些高贵妇女也乔装男人，希望亲眼看看这种神秘的新鲜玩意儿，但她们就近看了半天以后认为：这并不象大家所想的和艺妓们所说的是个“魔磨”，而是安了发条的玩具，它的音乐根本不能跟乐队的音乐相比，因为乐队的音乐是动人的、有人味的，充满了生活的真实。大家对留声机深感失望，尽管它很快得到了广泛的推广，每个家庭都有一架，但毕竟不是供成年人消遣，而是给孩子们拆来拆去玩耍的。不过，镇上的什么人见到了火车站上的电话机，面对这种严峻的现实，最顽固的怀疑论者也动摇了。这种电话机有一个需要转动的长把手，因此大家最初把它看作是一种原始的留声机。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was as if God had decided to put to the test every capacity for surprise and was keeping the inhabitants of Macondo in a permanent alternation between excitement and disappointment, doubt and revelation, to such an extreme that no one knew for certain where the limits of reality lay. It was an intricate stew of truths and mirages that convulsed the ghost of Jos?Arcadio Buendía under the chestnut tree with impatience and made him wander all through the house even in broad daylight. Ever since the railroad had been officially inaugurated and had begun to arrive with regularity on Wednesdays at eleven o’clock and the primitive wooden station with a desk, a telephone, and a ticket window had been built, on the streets of Macondo men and women were seen who had adopted everyday and normal customs and manners but who really looked like people out of a circus. In a town that had chafed under the tricks of the gypsies there was no future for those ambulatory acrobats of commerce who with equal effrontery offered a whistling kettle and a daily regime that would assure the salvation of the soul on the seventh day; but from those who let themselves be convinced out of fatigue and the ones who were always unwary, they reaped stupendous benefits. Among those theatrical creatures, wearing riding breeches and leggings, a pith helmet and steel-rimmed glasses, with topaz eyes and the skin of a thin rooster, there arrived in Macondo on one of so many Wednesdays the chubby and smiling Mr. Herbert, who ate at the house.</p><p>上帝似乎决定试验一下马孔多居民们惊愕的限度，让他们经常处于高兴与失望、怀疑和承认的交替之中，以致没有一个人能够肯定他说现实的限度究竟在哪里。这是现实和幻想的混合，犹如栗树下面霍·阿·布恩蒂亚不安的幽灵甚至大白天也在房子里踱来踱去。铁路正式通车之后，每个星期三的十一点钟，一列火车开始准时到达，车站上建立了一座房子——一个简陋的木亭，里面有一张桌子和一台电话机，还有一个售票的小窗口；马孔多街道上出现了外来的男男女女，他们装做是从事一般买卖的普通人，但是很象杂技演员。这些沿街表演的流动杂技演员，也鼓簧弄舌地硬要别人观看啸叫的铁锅，并且传授大斋第七天拯救灵魂的摄生方法。（注：指节欲规则，节欲方法）在已经厌恶吉卜赛把戏的这个市镇上，这些杂技演员是无法指望成功的，但他们还是想尽巧招赚了不少钱，主要靠那些被他们说得厌烦的人和容易上当的人。在一个星期三，有一位笑容可掬的矮小的赫伯特先生，和这些杂技演员一块儿来到了马孔多，然后在布恩蒂亚家里吃饭。他穿着马裤，系着护腿套，戴着软木头盔和钢边眼镜；眼镜后面是黄玉似的眼睛。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>No one had noticed him at the table until the first bunch of bananas had been eaten. Aureliano Segundo had come across him by chance as he protested In broken Spanish because there were no rooms at the Hotel Jacob, and as he frequently did with strangers, he took him home. He was in the captive-balloon business, which had taken him halfway around the world with excellent profits, but he had not succeeded in taking anyone up in Macondo because they considered that invention backward after having seen and tried the gypsies?flying carpets. He was leaving, therefore, on the next train. </p><p>赫伯特先生在桌边吃完第一串香蕉之前，谁也没有注意他。奥雷连诺第二是在雅各旅馆里偶然遇见他的，他在那儿用半通不通的西班牙语抱怨没有空房间，奥雷连诺第二就象经常对待外来人那样，把他领到家里来了。赫伯特先生有几个气球，他带着它们游历了半个世界，到处都得到极好的收入，但他未能把任何一个马孔多居民升到空中，因为他们看见过和尝试过吉卜赛人的飞毯，就觉得气球是倒退了。因此，赫伯特先生已买好了下一趟列车的车票。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When they brought to the table the tiger-striped bunch of bananas that they were accustomed to hang in the dining room during lunch, he picked the first piece of fruit without great enthusiasm. But he kept on eating as he spoke, tasting, chewing, more with the distraction of a wise man than with the delight of a good eater, and when he finished the first bunch he asked them to bring him another. Then he took a small case with optical instruments out of the toolbox that he always carried with him. With the auspicious attention of a diamond merchant he examined the banana meticulously, dissecting it with a special scalpel, weighing the pieces on a pharmacist’s scale, and calculating its breadth with a gunsmith’s calipers. Then he took a series of instruments out of the chest with which he measured the temperature, the level of humidity in the atmosphere, and the intensity of the light. It was such an intriguing ceremony that no one could eat in peace as everybody waited for Mr. Herbert to pass a final and revealing judgment, but he did not say anything that allowed anyone to guess his intentions. On the days that followed he was seen with a net and a small basket hunting butterflies on the outskirts of town. </p><p>一串虎纹香蕉拿上桌子的时候（这种香蕉通常是拿进饭厅供午餐用的），赫伯特先生兴致不大地掰下了第一个香蕉。接着又掰下一个，再掰下一个；他不停地一面谈，一面吃；一面咀嚼，一面品味，但没有食客的喜悦劲儿，只有学者的冷淡神态。吃完了第一串香蕉，他又要了第二串。然后，他从经常带在身边的工具箱里，掏出一个装着精密仪器的小盒子。他以钻石商人的怀疑态度仔细研究了一个香蕉：用专门的柳叶刀从香蕉上剖下一片，放在药秤上称了称它的重量，拿军械技师的卡规量了量它的宽度。随后，他又从箱子里取出另一套仪器，测定温度、空气湿度和阳光强度。这些繁琐的手续是那样引人入胜，以致谁也不能平静地吃，都在等待赫伯特先生发表最后意见，看看究竟是怎么一回事，但他并没有说出一句能够使人猜到他的心思的话来。随后几天，有人看见赫伯特先生拿着捕蝶网和小篮子在市镇郊区捕捉蝴蝶。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>On Wednesday a group of engineers, agronomists, hydrologists, topographers, and surveyors arrived who for several weeks explored the places where Mr. Herbert had hunted his butterflies. Later on Mr. Jack Brown arrived in an extra coach that had been coupled onto the yellow train and that was silver-plated all over, with seats of episcopal velvet, and a roof of blue glass. Also arriving on the special car, fluttering around Mr. Brown, were the solemn lawyers dressed in black who in different times had followed Colonel Aureliano Buendía everywhere, and that led the people to think that the agronomists, hydrologists, topographers, and surveyors, like Mr. Herbert with his captive balloons and his colored butterflies and Mr. Brown with his mausoleum on wheels and his ferocious German shepherd dogs, had something to do with the war. There was not much time to think about it, however, because the suspicious inhabitants of Macondo barely began to wonder what the devil was going on when the town had already become transformed into an encampment of wooden houses with zinc roofs inhabited by foreigners who arrived on the train from halfway around the world, riding not only on the seats and platforms but even on the roof of the coaches. </p><p>下星期三，这儿来了一批工程师、农艺师、水文学家、地形测绘员和土地丈量员，他们在几小时内就勘探了赫伯特先生捕捉蝴蝶的地方。然后，一个叫杰克？布劳恩先生的也乘火车来了；他乘坐的银色车厢是加挂在黄色列车尾部的，有丝绒软椅和蓝色玻璃车顶。在另一个车厢里，还有一些身穿黑衣服的重要官员，全都围着布劳恩先生转来转去；他们就是从前到处都跟随着奥雷连诺上校的那些律师，这使人不得不想到，这批农艺师、水文学家、地形测绘员和土地丈量员，象赫伯特先生跟他的气球和花蝴蝶一样，也象布劳恩先生跟他那安了轮子的陵墓与凶恶的德国牧羊犬一样，是同战争有某种关系的。然而没有多少时间加以思考，多疑的马孔多居民刚刚提出问题：到底会发生什么事，这市镇已经变成了一个营地，搭起了锌顶木棚，棚子里住满了外国人，他们几乎是从世界各地乘坐火车——不仅坐在车厢里和平台上，而且坐在车顶上——来到这儿的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The gringos, who later on brought their languid wives in muslin dresses and large veiled hats, built a separate town across the railroad tracks with streets lined with palm trees, houses with screened windows, small white tables on the terraces, and fans mounted on the ceilings, and extensive blue lawns with peacocks and quails. The section was surrounded by a metal fence topped with a band of electrified chicken wire which during the cool summer mornings would be black with roasted swallows. No one knew yet what they were after, or whether they were actually nothing but philanthropists, and they had already caused a colossal disturbance, much more than that of the old gypsies, but less transitory and understandable. Endowed with means that had been reserved for Divine Providence in former times, they changed the pattern of the rams, accelerated the cycle of harvest, and moved the river from where it had always been and put it with its white stones and icy currents on the other side of the town, behind the cemetery. It was at that time that they built a fortress of reinforced concrete over the faded tomb of Jos?Arcadio, so that the corpses smell of powder would not contaminate the waters. For the foreigners who arrived without love they converted the street of the loving matrons from France into a more extensive village than it had been, and on one glorious Wednesday they brought in a trainload of strange whores, Babylonish women skilled in age-old methods and in possession of all manner of unguents and devices to stimulate the unaroused, to give courage to the timid, to satiate the voracious, to exalt the modest man, to teach a lesson to repeaters, and to correct solitary people. </p><p>没过多久，外国佬就把没精打采的老婆接来了，这些女人穿的是凡而纱衣服，戴的是薄纱大帽，于是，他们又在铁道另一边建立了一个市镇；镇上有棕榈成荫的街道，还有窗户安了铁丝网的房屋，阳台上摆着白色桌子，天花板上吊着叶片挺大的电扇，此外还有宽阔的绿色草坪，孔雀和鹌鹑在草坪上荡来荡去。整个街区围上了很高的金属栅栏，活象一个硕大的电气化养鸡场。在凉爽的夏天的早晨，栅栏上边蹲着一只只燕子，总是显得黑压压的。还没有人清楚地知道：这些外国人在马孔多寻找什么呢，或者他们只是一些慈善家；然而，他们已在这儿闹得天翻地覆——他们造成的混乱大大超过了从前吉卜赛人造成的混乱，而且这种混乱根本不是短时间的、容易理解的。他们借助上帝才有的力量，改变了雨水的状况，缩短了庄稼成熟的时间，迁移了河道，甚至把河里的白色石头都搬到市镇另一头的墓地后面去了。就在那个时候，在霍·阿卡蒂奥坟冢褪了色的砖石上面，加了一层钢筋混凝土，免得河水染上尸骨发出的火药气味。对于那些没带家眷的外国人，多情的法国艺妓们居住的一条街就变成了他们消遣的地方，这个地方比金属栅栏后面的市镇更大，有个星期三开到的一列火车，载来了一批十分奇特的妓女和善于勾引的巴比伦女人，她们甚至懂得各种古老的诱惑方法，能够刺激阳萎者，鼓舞胆怯者，满足贪婪者，激发文弱者，教训傲慢者，改造遁世者。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Street of the Turks, enriched by well-lit stores with products from abroad, displacing the old bazaars with their bright colors, overflowed on Saturday nights with the crowds of adventurers who bumped into each other among gambling tables, shooting galleries, the alley where the future was guessed and dreams interpreted, and tables of fried food and drinks, and on Sunday mornings there were scattered on the ground bodies that were sometimes those of happy drunkards and more often those of onlookers felled by shots, fists, knives, and bottles during the brawls. It was such a tumultuous and intemperate invasion that during the first days it was impossible to walk through the streets because of the furniture and trunks, and the noise of the carpentry of those who were building their houses in any vacant lot without asking anyone’s permission, and the scandalous behavior of couples who hung their hammocks between the almond trees and made love under the netting in broad daylight and in view of everyone. The only serene corner had been established by peaceful West Indian Negroes, who built a marginal street with wooden houses on piles where they would sit in the doors at dusk singing melancholy hymns in their disordered gabble. So many changes took place in such a short time that eight months after Mr. Herbert’s visit the old inhabitants had a hard time recognizing their own town.</p><p>土耳其人街上是一家家灯火辉煌的舶来品商店，这些商店代替了古老的阿拉伯店铺，星期六晚上这儿都虞集着一群群冒险家：有的围在牌桌旁，有的站在靶场上，有的在小街小巷里算命和圆梦，有的在餐桌上大吃大喝，星期天早晨，地上到处都是尸体，有些死者是胡闹的醉汉，但多半是爱看热闹的倒霉蛋，都是在夜间斗殴时被枪打死的、拳头揍死的、刀子戳死的或者瓶子砸死的。马孔多突然涌进那么多的人，最初街道都无法通行，因为到处都是家具、箱子和各种建筑材料。有些人没有得到许可，就随便在什么空地上给自己盖房子；此外还会撞见一种丑恶的景象——成双成对的人大白天在杏树之间挂起吊床，当众乱搞。唯一宁静的角落是爱好和平的西印度黑人开辟的——他们在镇郊建立了整整一条街道，两旁是木桩架搭的房子，每天傍晚，他们坐在房前的小花园里，用古怪的语言唱起了抑郁的圣歌。在短时间里发生了那么多的变化，以致在赫伯特先生访问之后过了八个月，马孔多的老居民已经认不得自己的市镇了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Look at the mess we've got ourselves into," Colonel Aureli-ano Buendía said at that time, "just because we invited a gringo to eat some bananas."</p><p>“瞧，咱们招惹了多少麻烦，”奥雷连诺上校那时常说，“都是因为咱们用香蕉招待了一个外国佬。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Aureli-ano Segun-do, on the other hand, could not contain his happiness over the avalanche foreigners. The house was suddenly filled with unknown guests, with invincible and worldly carousers, and it became necessary to add bedrooms off the courtyard, widen the dining room, and exchange the old table for one that held sixteen people, with new china and silver, and even then they had to eat lunch in shifts. Fernanda had to swallow her scruples and their guests of the worst sort like kings as they muddied the porch with their boots, urinated in the garden. laid their mats down anywhere to take their siesta, and spoke without regard for the sensitivities of ladies or the proper behavior of gentlemen. Amaranta, was so scandalized with the plebeian invasion that she went back to eating in the kitchen as in olden days. Colonel Aureli-ano Buendía, convinced that the majority of those who came into his workshop to greet him were not doing it because of sympathy or regard but out of the curiosity to meet a historical relic, a museum fossil, decided to shut himself in by barring the door and he was not seen any more except on very rare occasions when he would sit at the street door. </p><p>恰恰相反，奥雷连诺第二看见外国人洪水般地涌来，就控制不住自己的高兴。家中很快挤满了各式各样的陌生人，挤满了世界各地来的不可救药的二流子，因此需要在院子里增建新的住房，扩大饭厅，用一张能坐十六个人的餐桌代替旧的桌子，购置新的碗碟器皿；即使如此，吃饭还得轮班。菲兰达只好克制自己的厌恶，象侍候国王一样侍候这些最无道德的客人：他们把靴底的泥土弄在廊上，直接在花园里撒尿，午休时想把席子铺在哪儿就铺在哪儿，想说什么就说什么，根本就不注意妇女的羞涩和男人的耻笑。阿玛兰塔被这帮鄙俗的家伙弄得气恼已极，又象从前那样在厨房里吃饭了。奥雷连诺上校相信，他们大多数人到作坊里来向他致意，并不是出于同情或者尊敬他，而是好奇地希望看看历史的遗物，看看博物馆的古董，所以他就闩上了门，现在除了极少的情况，再也看不见他坐在当街的门口了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>úrsula, on the other hand, even during the days when she was already dragging her feet and walking about groping along the walls, felt a juvenile excitement as the time for the arrival of the train approached. "We have to prepare some meat and fish," she would order the four cooks, who hastened to have everything ready under the imperturbable direction of Santa Sofía de la Piedad. "We have to prepare everything," she insisted, "because we never know what these strangers like to eat." The train arrived during the hottest time of day. At lunchtime the house shook with the bustle of a marketplace, and the perspiring guests-who did not even know who their hosts were-trooped in to occupy the best places at the table, while the cooks bumped into each other with enormous kettles of soup, pots of meat, large gourds filled with vegetables, and troughs of rice, and passed around the contents of barrels of lemonade with inexhaustible ladles. The disorder was such that Fernanda was troubled by the idea that many were eating twice and on more than one occasion she was about to burst out with a vegetable hawker's insults because someone at the table in confusion asked her for the check. More than a year had gone by since Mr. Herbert's visit and the only thing that was known was that the gringos were planning to plant banana trees in the enchanted region that José Arcadio Buendía and his men had crossed in search of the route to the great inventions. Two other sons Colonel Aureli-ano Buendía, with the cross of ashes on their foreheads, arrived, drawn by that great volcanic belch, and they justified their determination with a phrase that may have explained everybody's reasons.</p><p>相反地，乌苏娜甚至已经步履瞒珊、摸着墙壁走路了，但在每一列火车到达的前夜，她都象孩子一般高兴。“咱们得预备一些鱼肉，”她向四个厨娘吩咐道，她们急于在圣索菲娅·德拉佩德沉着的指挥下把一切都准备好。“咱们得预备一切东西，”她坚持说，“因为咱们压根儿不知道这些外国人想吃啥。”在一天最热的时刻，列车到达了。午餐时，整座房子象市场一样闹哄哄的，汗流浃背的食客甚至还不知道谁是慷慨的主人，就闹喳喳地蜂拥而入，慌忙在桌边占据最好的座位，而厨娘们却彼此相撞，她们端来了一锅锅汤、一盘盘肉菜、一碗碗饭，用长柄勺把整桶整桶的柠檬水舀到玻璃杯里。房子里混乱已极，菲兰达想到许多人吃了两次就很恼火，所以，当漫不经心的食客把她的家当成小酒馆，向她要账单的时候，她真想用市场上菜贩的语言发泄自己的愤怒。赫伯特先生来访之后过了一年多时间，大家只明白了一点：外国佬打算在一片魔力控制的土地上种植香蕉树，这片土地就是霍·阿·布恩蒂亚一帮人去寻找伟大发明时经过的土地。奥雷连诺上校的另外两个脑门上仍有灰十字的儿子又到了马孔多，他们是被涌入市镇的火山熔岩般的巨大人流卷来的，为了证明自己来得有理，他们讲的一句话大概能够说明每个人前来这儿的原因。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We came," they said, "because everyone is coming."</p><p>“我们到这儿来，”他俩说，“因为大家都来嘛。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Remedios the Beauty was the only one who was immune to the banana plague. She was becalmed in a magnificent adolescence, more and more impenetrable to formality, more and more indifferent to malice and suspicion, happy in her own world of simple realities. She did not understand why women complicated their lives with corsets and petticoats, so she sewed herself a coarse cassock that she simply put over her and without further difficulties resolved the problem of dress, without taking away the feeling of being naked, which according to her lights was the only decent way to be when at home. They bothered her so much to cut the rain of hair that already reached to her thighs and to make rolls with combs and braids with red ribbons that she simply shaved her head and used the hair to make wigs for the saints. The startling thing about her simplifying instinct was that the more she did away with fashion in a search for comfort and the more she passed over conventions as she obeyed spontaneity, the more disturbing her incredible beauty became and the more provocative she became to men. </p><p>俏姑娘雷麦黛丝是唯一没有染上“香蕉热”的人。她仿佛停留在美妙的青春期，越来越讨厌各种陈规，越来越不在乎别人的嫌厌和怀疑，只在自己简单的现实世界里寻求乐趣。她不明白娘儿们为什么要用乳罩和裙子把自己的生活搞得那么复杂，就拿粗麻布缝了一件肥大的衣服，直接从头上套下去，一劳永逸地解决了穿衣服的问题，这样既穿了衣服，又觉得自己是裸体的，因为她认为裸体状态在家庭环境里是唯一合适的。家里的人总是劝她把长及大腿的蓬松头发剪短一些，编成辫子，别上篦子，扎上红色丝带；她听了腻烦，干脆剃光了头，把自己的头发做成了圣像的假发。她下意识地喜欢简单化，但最奇怪的是，她越摆脱时髦、寻求舒服，越坚决反对陈规、顺从自由爱好，她那惊人之美就越动人，她对男人就越有吸引力。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When the sons of Colonel Aureli-ano Buendía were in Macon-do for the first time, úrsula remembered that in their veins they bore the same blood as her great-granddaughter she shuddered with a forgotten fright. "Keep your eyes wide open," she warned her. "With any of them your children will come out with the tail of a pig." The girl paid such little attention to the warning that she dressed up as a man and rolled around in the sand in order to climb the greased pole, and she was at the point of bringing on a tragedy among the seventeen cousins, who were driven mad by the unbearable spectacle. That was why none of them slept at the house when they visited the town and the four who had stayed lived in rented rooms at úrsula's insistence. Remedios the Beauty, however, would have died laughing if she had known about that precaution. Until her last moment on earth she was unaware that her irreparable fate as a disturbing woman was a daily disaster. </p><p>奥雷连诺上校的儿子们第一次来到马孔多的时候，乌苏娜想到他们的血管里流着跟曾孙女相同的血，就象从前那样害怕得发抖。“千万小心啊，”她警告俏姑娘雷麦黛丝。“跟他们当中的任何一个人瞎来，你的孩子都会有猪尾巴。”俏姑娘雷麦黛丝不太重视曾祖母的话，很快穿上男人的衣服，在沙地上打了打滚，想爬上抹了油脂的竿子，这几乎成了十二个亲戚之间发生悲剧的缘由，因为他们都给这种忍受不了的景象弄疯了。正由于这一点，他们来到的时候，乌苏娜不让他们任何一个在家里过夜，而留居马孔多的那四个呢，按照她的吩咐，在旁边租了几个房间。如果有人向俏姑娘雷麦黛丝说起这些预防措施，她大概是会笑死的。直到她在世上的最后一刻，她始终都不知道命运使她成了一个扰乱男人安宁的女人，犹如寻常的天灾似的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Every time she appeared in the dining room, against úrsula's orders, she caused a panic of exasperation among the outsiders. It was all too evident that she was completely naked underneath her crude nightshirt and no one could understand that her shaved perfect skull was not some kind of challenge, and that the boldness with which she uncovered her thighs to cool off was not a criminal provocation, nor was her pleasure when she sucked her fingers after. eating. What no member of the family ever knew was that the strangers did not take long to realize that Remedios the Beauty gave off a breath of perturbation, a tormenting breeze that was still perceptible several hours after she had passed by. Men expert in the disturbances of love, experienced all over the world, stated that they had never suffered an anxiety similar to the one produced by the natural smell of Remedios the Beauty. On the porch the begonias, in the parlor, in any place in the house, it was possible to point out the exact place where she had been and the time that had passed since she had left it. It was a definite, unmistakable trace that no one in the family could distinguish because it had been incorporated into the daily odors for a long time, but it was one that the outsiders identified immediately. They were the only ones, therefore, who understood how the young commander of the guard had died of love and how a gentleman from a faraway lhad been plunged into desperation. </p><p>每一次，她违背乌苏娜的禁令，出现在饭厅里的时候，外国人中间都会发生骚乱。一切都太显眼了，除了一件肥大的粗麻布衣服，俏姑娘雷麦黛丝是赤裸裸的，而且谁也不能相信，她那完美的光头不是一种挑衅，就象她露出大腿来乘凉的那种无耻样儿和饭后舔手指的快活劲儿不是罪恶的挑逗。布恩蒂亚家中没有一个人料到，外国人很快就已发觉：俏姑娘雷麦黛丝身上发出一种引起不安的气味，令人头晕的气味，在她离开之后，这些气味还会在空气中停留几个小时。在世界各地经历过情场痛苦的男人认为，俏姑娘雷麦黛丝的天生气味在他们身上激起的欲望，他们从前是不曾感到过的。在秋海棠长廊上，在客厅里，在房中的任何一个角落里，他们经常能够准确地指出俏姑娘雷麦黛丝呆过的地方，断定她离开之后过了多少时间，她在空气中留下了清楚的痕迹，这种痕迹跟任何东西都不会相混：家里的人谁也没有觉出它来，因为它早已成了家中日常气味中的一部分，可是外人立刻就把它嗅出来了。所以只有他们明白，那个年轻的军官为什么会死于爱情，而从远地来的那个绅士为什么会陷于绝望。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Unaware of the restless circle in which she moved, of the unbearable state intimate calamity that she provoked as she passed by, Remedios the Beauty treated the men without the least bit malice and in the end upset them with her innocent complaisance. When úrsula succeeded in imposing the commthat she eat with Amaranta in the kitchen so that the outsiders would not see her, she felt more comfortable, because, after all, she was beyond all discipline. In reality, it made no difference to her where she ate, and not at regular hours but according to the whims appetite. Sometimes she would get up to have lunch at three in the morning, sleep all day long, and she spent several months with her timetable all in disarray until some casual incident would bring her back into the order things. When things were going better she would get up at eleven o'clock in the morning and shut herself up until two o'clock, completely nude, in the bathroom, killing scorpions as she came out of her dense prolonged sleep. Then she would throw water from the cistern over herself with a gourd. It was an act so prolonged, so meticulous, so rich in ceremonial aspects that one who did not know well would have thought that she was given over to the deserved adoration of her own body. For her, however, that solitary rite lacked all sensuality and was simply a way of passing the time until she was hungry. One day, as she began to bathe herself, a stranger lifted a tile from the roof and was breathless at the tremendous spectacle of her nudity. She saw his desolate eyes through the broken tiles and had no reaction of shame but rather one of alarm.</p><p>俏姑娘雷麦黛丝由于不知道自己身上有一种引起不安的自然力量，她在场时就会激起男人心中难以忍受的慌乱感觉，所以她对待他们是没有一点虚假的，她的天真热情终于弄得他们神魂颠倒起来。乌苏娜为了不让外国人看见自己的曾孙女，要她跟阿玛兰塔一起在厨房里吃饭，这一点甚至使她感到高兴，因为她毕竟用不着服从什么规矩了。其实，什么时候在哪其他儿吃饭，她是不在乎的，她宁愿不按规定的时间吃饭，想吃就吃。有时，她会忽然在清晨三点起来吃点东西，然后一直睡到傍晚，连续几个月打乱作息时间表，直到最后某种意外的情况才使她重新遵守家中规定的制度。然而，即使情况有了好转，她也早上十一点起床，一丝不挂地在浴室里呆到下午两点，一面打蝎子，一面从深沉和长久的迷梦中逐渐清醒过来。然后，她才用水瓢从贮水器里舀起水来，开始冲洗身子。这种长时间的、细致的程序，夹了许多美妙的动作，不大了解俏姑娘雷麦黛丝的人可能以为她在理所当然地欣赏自己的身姿。然而，实际上，这些奇妙的动作没有任何意义，只是俏姑娘雷麦黛丝吃饭之前消磨时光的办法。有一次，她刚开始冲洗身子，就有个陌生人在屋顶上揭开一块瓦：他一瞅见俏姑娘雷麦黛丝赤身露体的惊人景象，连气都喘不过来人她在瓦片之间发现了他那凄凉的眼睛，并不害臊，而是不安。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Be careful,"she exclaimed. "You’ll fall."</p><p>“当心，”她惊叫一声。“你会掉下来的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I just wanted to see you," the foreigner murmured.</p><p>“我光想瞧瞧你，”陌生人咕噜说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Oh, all right," she said. "But be careful, those tiles are rotten."</p><p>“哦，好吧，”她说，“可你得小心点儿，屋顶完全腐朽啦。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The stranger's face had a pained expression of stupor and he seemed to be battling silently against his primary instincts so as not to break up the mirage. Remedios the Beauty thought that he was suffering from the fear that the tiles would break and she bathed herself more quickly than usual so that the man would not be in danger. While she was pouring water from the, cistern she told him that the roof was in that state because she thought that the bed of leaves had been rotted by the rain and that was what was filling the bathroom with scorpions. The stranger thought that her small talk was a way of covering her complaisance, so that when she began to soap herself he gave into temptation went a step further.</p><p>陌生人脸上露出惊异和痛苦的表情，他似乎在闷不作声地跟原始本能搏斗，生怕奇妙的幻景消失。俏姑娘雷麦黛丝却以为他怕屋顶塌下，就尽量比平常洗得快些，不愿让这个人长久处在危险之中。姑娘一面冲洗身子，一面向他说，这屋顶的状况很糟，因为瓦上铺的树叶被雨水淋得腐烂了，蝎子也就钻进浴室来了。陌生人以为她嘀嘀咕咕是在掩饰她的青睐，所以她在身上擦肥皂时，他就耐不住想碰碰运气。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Let me soap you," he murmured.</p><p>“让我给你擦肥皂吧，”他嘟嚷说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Thank you for your good intentions," she said, "but my two hands are quite enough."</p><p>“谢谢你的好意，”她回答，“可我的两只手完全够啦。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Even if it's just your back," the foreigner begged.</p><p>“嗨，哪怕光给你擦擦背也好，”陌生人恳求。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That would be silly," she said. "People never soap their backs."</p><p>“为啥？”她觉得奇怪。“哪儿见过用肥皂擦背的？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Then, while she was drying herself, the stranger begged her, with his eyes full of tears, to marry him. She answered him sincerely that she would never marry a man who was so simple that he had wasted almost an hour and even went without lunch just to see a woman taking a bath. Finally, when she put on her cassock, the man could not bear the proof that, indeed, she was not wearing anything underneath, as everyone had suspected, and he felt himself marked forever with the white-hot iron of that secret. Then he took two more tiles off in order to drop down into the bathroom.</p><p>接着，当地擦干身子的时候，陌生人泪汪汪地央求她嫁给他。她坦率地回答他说，她决不嫁给一个憨头憨脑的人，因为他浪费了几乎一个小时，连饭都不吃，光是为了观看一个洗澡的女人。俏姑娘雷麦黛丝最后穿上肥大衣服时，陌生人亲眼看见，正象许多人的猜测，她的确是把衣服直接套在光身上的，他认为这个秘密完全得到了证实。他又挪开两块瓦，打算跳进浴室。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It's very high," she warned him in fright. "You'll kill yourself!"</p><p>“这儿挺高，”姑娘惊骇地警告他，“你会摔死的！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The rotten tiles broke with a noise of disaster and the man barely had time to let out a cry of terror as he cracked his skull and was killed outright on the cement floor. The foreigners who heard the noise in the dining room and hastened to remove the body noticed the suffocating odor of Remedios the Beauty on his skin. It was so deep in his body that the cracks in his skull did not give off blood but an amber-colored oil that was impregnated with that secret perfume, and then they understood that the smell of Remedios the Beauty kept on torturing men beyond death, right down to the dust of their bones. Nevertheless, they did not relate that horrible accident to the other two men who had died because of Remedios the Beauty. A victim was still needed before the outsiders and many of the old inhabitants of Macon-do would credit the legend that Remedios Buendía did not give off a breath of love but a fatal emanation. </p><p>腐朽的屋顶象山崩一样轰然塌下，陌生人几乎来不及发出恐怖的叫声，就掉到洋灰地上，撞破脑袋，立即毙命。从饭厅里闻声跑来的一群外国人，连忙把尸体搬出去时．觉得他的皮肤发出俏姑娘雷麦黛丝令人窒息的气味。这种气味深深地钻进了死者的身体内部：从他的脑壳裂缝里渗出来的甚至也不是血，而是充满了这种神秘气味的玻璃色油：大家立即明白，一个男人即使死了，在他的骸骨化成灰之前，俏姑娘雷麦黛丝的气味仍在折磨他，然而，谁也没有把这件可怕的事跟另外两个为俏姑娘雷麦黛丝丧命的男人联系起来。在又一个人牺牲之后，外国人和马孔多的许多老居民才相信这么个传说：俏姑娘雷麦黛丝身上发出的不是爱情的气息，而是死亡的气息。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The occasion for the proof of it came some months later on one afternoon when Remedios the Beauty went with a group of girl friends to look at the new plantings. For the girls of Macon-do that novel game was reason for laughter and surprises, frights and jokes, at night they would talk about their walk as if it had been an experience in a dream. Such was the prestige of that silence that úrsula did not have the heart to take the fun away from Remedios the Beauty, and she let her go one afternoon, providing that she wore a hat and a decent dress. As soon as the group of friends went into the plantings the air became impregnated with a fatal fragrance. The men who were working along the rows felt possessed by a strange fascination, menaced by some invisible danger, and many succumbed to a terrible desire to weep. Remedios the Beauty and her startled friends managed to take refuge in a nearby house just as they were about to be assaulted by a pack of ferocious males. A short time later they were rescued by the flour Aureli-anos, whose crosses of ash inspired a sacred respect, as if they were caste marks, stamps of invulnerability. Remedios the Beauty did not tell anyone that one of the men, taking advantage of the tumult, had managed to attack her stomach with a hand that was more like the claw of an eagle clinging to the edge a precipice. She faced the attacker in a kind of instantaneous flash and saw the disconsolate eyes, which remained stamped on her heart like the hot coals of pity. That night the man boasted of his audacity and swaggered over his good luck on the Street of the Turks a few minutes before the kick of a horse crushed his chest and a crowd of outsiders saw him die in the middle of the street, drowned in his own bloody vomiting.</p><p>几个月以后的一桩事情证实了这种说法。有一天下午，俏姑娘雷麦黛丝和女友们一起去参观新的香蕉园。马孔多居民有一种时髦的消遣，就是在一行行香蕉树之间的通道上遛哒，通道没有尽头，满是潮气，宁静极了；这种宁静的空气是挺新奇的，仿佛是从什么地方原封不动移来的，那里的人似乎还没享受过它，它还不会清楚地传达声音，有时在半米的距离内，也听不清别人说些什么，可是从种植园另一头传来的声音却绝对清楚。马孔多的姑娘们利用这种奇怪的现象来做游戏，嬉闹呀，恐吓呀，说笑呀，晚上谈起这种旅游，仿佛在谈一场荒唐的梦。马孔多香蕉林的宁静是很有名气的，乌苏娜不忍心阻拦俏姑娘雷麦黛丝去玩玩，那天下午叫她戴上帽子、穿上体面的衣服，就让她去了。姑娘们刚刚走进香蕉园，空气中马上充满了致命的气味，正在挖灌溉渠的一伙男人，觉得自己被某种神奇的魔力控制住了，遇到了什么看不见的危险，其中许多人止不住想哭。俏姑娘和惊惶失措的女友们好不容易钻进最近的一座房子，躲避一群向她们凶猛扑来的男人。过了一阵，姑娘们才由四个奥雷连诺救了出来，他们额上的灰十字使人感到一种神秘的恐怖，好象它们是等级符号，是刀枪不入的标志。俏姑娘雷麦黛丝没告诉任何人，有个工人利用混乱伸手抓住她的肚子，犹如鹰爪抓住悬崖的边沿。瞬息间，仿佛有一道明亮的白光使她两眼发花，她朝这人转过身去，便看见了绝望的目光，这目光刺进她的心房，在那里点燃了怜悯的炭火。傍晚，在土耳其人街上，这个工人吹嘘自己的勇敢和运气，可是几分钟之后。马蹄就踩烂了他的胸膛；一群围观的外国人看见他在马路中间垂死挣扎，躺在自己吐出的一摊血里。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The supposition that Remedios the Beauty Possessed powers of death was then borne out by four irrefutable events. Although some men who were easy with their words said that it was worth sacrificing one's life for a night of love with such an arousing woman, the truth was that no one made any effort to do so. Perhaps, not only to attain her but also to conjure away her dangers, all that was needed was a feeling as primitive and as simple as that of love, but that was the only thing that did not occur to anyone. úrsula did not worry about her any more. On another occasion, when she had not yet given up the idea of saving her for the world, she had tried to get her interested in basic domestic affairs. "Men demand much more than you think," she would tell her enigmatically. "There's a lot of cooking, a lot of sweeping, a lot of suffering over little things beyond what you think." She was deceiving herself within, trying to train her for domestic happiness because she was convinced that once his passion was satisfied them would not be a man on the face of the earth capable of tolerating even for a day a negligence that was beyond all understanding. The birth of the latest José Arcadio and her unshakable will to bring up to be Pope finally caused her to cease worrying about her great--granddaughter. She abandoned her to her fate, trusting that sooner or later a miracle would take place that in this world of everything there would also be a man -with enough sloth to put up with her. For a long time already Amaranta had given up trying to make her into a useful woman. Since those forgotten afternoons when her niece barely had enough interest to turn the crank on the sewing machine, she had reached the conclusion that she was simpleminded. </p><p>俏姑娘雷麦黛丝拥有置人死地的能力，这种猜测现在已由四个不可辩驳的事例证实了。虽然有些喜欢吹牛的人说，跟这样迷人的娘儿们睡上一夜，不要命也是值得的，但是谁也没有这么干。其实，要博得她的欢心，又不会受到她的致命伤害，只要有一种原始的、朴素的感情——爱情就够了，然而这一点正是谁也没有想到的。乌苏娜不再关心自己的曾孙女儿了。以前，她还想挽救这个姑娘的时候，曾让她对一些简单的家务发生兴趣。“男人需要的比你所想的多，”她神秘地说。“除了你所想的，还需要你没完没了地做饭啦，打扫啦，为鸡毛蒜皮的事伤脑筋啦。”乌苏娜心里明白，她竭力教导这个姑娘如何获得家庭幸福，是她在欺骗自己，因为她相信：世上没有那么一个男人，满足自己的情欲之后，还能忍受俏姑娘雷麦黛丝叫人无法理解的疏懒。最后一个霍·阿卡蒂奥刚刚出世，乌苏娜就拼命想使他成为一个教皇，也就不再关心曾孙女儿了。她让姑娘听天由命，相信无奇不有的世界总会出现奇迹，迟早能够找到一个很有耐性的男人来承受这个负担，在很长的时期里，阿玛兰塔已经放弃了使悄姑娘雷麦黛丝适应家务的一切打算。在很久以前的那些晚上，在阿玛兰塔的房间里，她养育的姑娘勉强同意转动缝纫机把手的时候，她就终于认为俏姑娘雷麦黛丝只是一个笨蛋。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Were going to have to raffle you off," she would tell her, perplexed at the fact that men's words would not penetrate her. Later on, when úrsula insisted that Remedios the Beauty go to mass with her face covered with a shawl, Amaranta thought that a mysterious recourse like that would turn out to be so provoking that soon a man would come who would be intrigued enough to search out patiently for the weak point of her heart. But when she saw the stupid way in which she rejected a pretender who for many reasons was more desirable than a prince, she gave up all hope. Fernanda did not even make any attempt to understand her. When she saw Remedios the Beauty dressed as a queen at the bloody carnival she thought that she was an extraordinary creature. But when she saw her eating with her hands, incapable of giving an answer that was not a miracle of simplemindedness, the only thing that she lamented was the fact that the idiots in the family lived so long. In spite the fact that Colonel Aureli-ano Buendía kept on believing and repeating that Remedios the Beauty was in reality the most lucid being that he had ever known and that she showed it at every moment with her startling ability to put things over on everyone, they let her go her own way. Remedios the Beauty stayed there wandering- through the desert of solitude, bearing no cross on her back, maturing in her dreams without nightmares, her interminable baths, her unscheduled meals, her deep and prolonged silences that had no memory until one afternoon in March, when Fernanda wanted to fold her brabant sheets in the garden and asked the women in the house for help. She had just begun when Amaranta noticed that Remedios the Beauty was covered all over by an intense paleness.</p><p>“我们得用抽彩的办法把你卖出去，”她担心姑娘对男人无动于衷，就向她说。后来，俏姑娘雷麦黛丝去教堂时，乌苏娜嘱咐她蒙上面纱，阿玛兰塔以为这种神秘办法倒是很诱人的，也许很快就会出现一个十分好奇的男人，耐心地在她心中寻找薄弱的地方。但是，在这姑娘轻率地拒绝一个在各方面都比任何王子都迷人的追求者之后，阿玛兰塔失去了最后的希望。而菲兰达呢，她根本不想了解俏姑娘雷麦黛丝。她在血腥的狂欢节瞧见这个穿着女王衣服的姑娘时，本来以为这是一个非凡的人物。可是，当她发现雷麦黛丝用手吃饭，而且只能回答一两句蠢话时，她就慨叹布恩蒂亚家的白痴存在太久啦。尽管奥雷连诺上校仍然相信，并且说了又说，俏姑娘雷麦黛丝实际上是他见过的人当中头脑最清醒的人，她经常用她挖苫别人的惊人本领证明了这一点，但家里的人还是让她走自己的路。于是，俏姑娘雷麦黛丝开始在孤独的沙漠里徘徊，但没感到任何痛苦，并且在没有梦魇的酣睡中，在没完没了的沐浴中，在不按时的膳食中，在长久的沉思中，逐渐成长起来。直到三月里的一天下午，菲兰达打算取下花园中绳子上的床单，想把它们折起来，呼唤家中的女人来帮忙。她们刚刚动手，阿玛兰塔发现俏姑娘雷麦黛丝突然变得异常紧张和苍白。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Don't you feel well?" she asked her.</p><p>“你觉得不好吗？”她问。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Remedios the Beauty, who was clutching the sheet by the other end, gave a pitying smile.</p><p>悄姑娘雷麦黛丝双手抓住床单的另一头，惨然地微笑了一下。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Quite the opposite," she said, "I never felt better."</p><p>“完全相反，我从来没有感到这么好。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She had just finished saying it when Fernanda felt a delicate wind of light pull the sheets out of her hands and open them up wide. Amaranta felt a mysterious trembling in the lace on her petticoats and she tried to grasp the sheet so that she would not fall down at the instant in which Remedios the Beauty began to rise. ?rsula, almost blind at the time, was the only person who was sufficiently calm to identify the nature of that determined wind and she left the sheets to the mercy of the light as she watched Remedios the Beauty waving good-bye in the midst of the flapping sheets that rose up with her, abandoning with her the environment of beetles and dahlias and passing through the air with her as four o’clock in the afternoon came to an end, and they were lost forever with her in the upper atmosphere where not even the highest-flying birds of memory could reach her.</p><p>俏姑娘雷麦黛丝话刚落音，菲兰达突然发现一道闪光，她手里的床单被一阵轻风卷走，在空中全幅展开。悄姑娘雷麦黛丝抓住床单的一头，开始凌空升起的时候，阿玛兰塔感到裙子的花边神秘地拂动。乌苏娜几乎已经失明，只有她一个人十分镇定，能够识别风的性质——她让床单在闪光中随风而去，瞧见俏姑娘雷麦黛丝向她挥手告别；姑娘周围是跟她一起升空的、白得耀眼的、招展的床单，床单跟她一起离开了甲虫飞红、天竺牡丹盛开的环境，下午四点钟就跟她飞过空中，永远消失在上层空间，甚至飞得最高的鸟儿也迫不上她了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The outsiders, of course, thought that Remedios the Beauty had finally succumbed to her irrevocable fate of a queen bee and that her family was trying to save her honor with that tale of levitation. Fernanda, burning with envy, finally accepted the miracle, for a long time she kept on praying to God to send her back her sheets. Most people believed in the miracle and they even lighted candles and celebrated novenas. Perhaps there might have been talk of nothing else for a long time if the barbarous extermination of the Aureli-anos had not replaced amazement with honor. Although he had never thought of it as an omen, Colonel Aureli-ano Buendía had foreseen the tragic end of his sons in a certain way. When Aureli-ano Serrador and Aureli-ano Arcaya, the two who arrived during the tumult, expressed a wish to stay in Macon-do, their father tried to dissuade them. He could not understand what they were going to do in a town that had been transformed into a dangerous place overnight. But Aureli-ano Centeno and Aureli-ano Triste, backed by Aureli-ano Segun-do. gave them work in their businesses. Colonel Aureli-ano Buendía had reasons that were still very confused and were against that determination. </p><p>外国人当然认为雷麦黛丝终于屈从了蜂王难免的命运，而她家里的人却想用升天的神话挽回她的面子。菲兰达满怀嫉妒，最终承认了这个奇迹，很长时间都在恳求上帝送回她的床单。马孔多的大多数土著居民也相信这个奇迹，甚至点起蜡烛举行安魂祈祷。大概，如果不是所有的奥雷连诺惨遭野蛮屠杀的恐怖事件代替了大家的惊讶，大家长久都不会去谈其他的事情。在某种程度上，奥雷连诺上校预感到了儿子们的悲惨结局，虽然没有明确这种感觉就是预兆。跟成群的外国人一起来到马孔多的，还有奥雷连诺·塞拉多和奥雷连诺·阿卡亚，他俩希望留在马孔多的时候，父亲却想劝阻他们。现在，天一黑走路就很危险，他不明白这两个儿子将在镇上干些什么。可是，奥雷连诺·森腾诺和奥雷连诺·特里斯特在奥雷连诺第二的支持下，却让两个兄弟在自己的工厂里干活。奥雷连诺上校是有理由反对这种决定的，虽说他的理由还很不清楚。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When he saw Mr. Brown in the first automobile to reach Macon-do-an orange convertible with a horn that frightened dogs with its bark--the old soldier grew indignant with the servile excitement of the people and he realized that something had changed in the makeup of the men since the days when they would leave their wives and children and toss a shotgun on their shoulders to go off to war. The local authorities, after the armistice of Neerlandia, were mayors without initiative, decorative judges picked from among the peaceful and tired Conservatives of Macon-do. "This is a regime wretches," Colonel Aureli-ano Buendía would comment when he saw the barefoot policemen armed with wooden clubs pass. "We fought all those wars and all of it just so that we didn't have to paint our houses blue." When the banana company arrived, however, the local functionaries were replaced by dictatorial foreigners whom Mr. Brown brought to live in the electrified chicken yard so that they could enjoy, as he explained it, the dignity that their status warranted so that they would not suffer from the heat and the mosquitoes and the countless discomforts and privations of the town. The old policemen were replaced by hired assassins machetes. Shut up in his workshop, Colonel Aureli-ano Buendía thought about those changes and for the first time in his quiet years solitude he was tormented by the definite certainty that it had been a mistake not to have continued the war to its final conclusion. During that time a brother of the forgotten Colonel Magnífico Visbal was taking his seven-year-old grandson to get a soft drink at one of the pushcarts on the square and because the child accidentally bumped into a corporal of police and spilled the drink on his uniform, the barbarian cut him to pieces with his machete, and with one stroke he cut off the head of the grandfather as he tried to stop him. The whole town saw the decapitated man pass by as a group of men carried him to his house, with a woman dragging the head along by its hair, and the bloody sack with the pieces of the child.</p><p>布劳恩先生是坐着第一辆小汽车来到马孔多的——这是一辆桔黄色的小汽车，装有可以折起的顶篷，嘟嘟的喇叭声吓得镇上的狗狺狺直叫；奥雷连诺上校看见这个外国佬的时候，就对镇上的人在这个外国佬面前的卑躬样儿感到愤怒，知道他们自从扔下妻子儿女、扛起武器走向战争以来，精神面貌已经发生了变化。在尼兰德停战协定以后，掌管马孔多的是一个失去了独立性的镇民，是从爱好和平的、困倦的保守党人中间选出的一些无权的法官。“这是残废管理处，”奥雷连诺上校看见手持木棒的赤足警察，就说。“我们打了那么多的仗，都是为了不把自己的房子刷成蓝色嘛。”然而，香蕉公司出现以后，专横傲慢的外国人代替了地方官吏，布劳恩先生让他们住在 “电气化养鸡场”里，享受高等人士的特权，不会象镇上其他的人那样苦于酷热和蚊子，也不会象别人那样感到许多不便和困难。手执大砍刀的雇佣刽子手取代了以前的警察。奥雷连诺上校关在自己的作坊里思考这些变化，在长年的孤独中第一次痛切地坚信，没把战争进行到底是他的错误。正巧有一天，大家早已忘却的马格尼菲柯·维斯巴尔的弟弟，带着一个七岁的孙子到广场上一个小摊跟前去喝柠檬水。小孩儿偶然把饮料洒到旁边一个警士班长的制服上，这个野蛮人就用锋利的大砍刀把小孩儿剁成了碎块，并且一下子砍掉了试图搭救孙子的祖父的脑袋。当几个男人把老头儿的尸体搬走的时候，全镇的人都看见了无头的尸体，看见了一个妇人手里拎着的脑袋，看见了一个装着孩子骸骨的、血淋淋的袋子。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>For Colonel Aureli-ano Buendía it meant the limits of atonement. He suddenly found himself suffering from the same indignation that he had felt in his youth over the body the woman who had been beaten to death because she had been bitten by a rabid dog. He looked at the groups of bystanders in front of the house his old stentorian voice, restored by a deep disgust with himself, he unloaded upon them the burden of hate that he could no longer bear in his heart.</p><p>这个景象结束了奥雷连诺上校的悔罪心情。年轻时，看见一个疯狗咬伤的妇人被枪托打死，他曾恼怒已极；现在他也象那时一样，望着街上一群麇集的观众，就用往常那种雷鸣般的声音（因他无比地憎恨自己，他的声音又洪亮了），向他们发泄再也不能遏制的满腔怒火。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"One of these days," he shouted, I'm going to arm my boys so we can get rid of these shitty gringos!"</p><p>“等着吧，”他大声叫嚷。“最近几天我就把武器发给我的一群孩子，让他们除掉这些坏透了的外国佬。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>During the course of that week, at different places along the coast, his seventeen sons were hunted down like rabbits by invisible criminals who aimed at the center of their crosses of ash. Aureli-ano Triste was leaving the house with his mother at seven in the evening when a rifle shot came out of the darkness and perforated his forehead. Aureli-ano Centeno was found in the hammock that he was accustomed to hang up in the factory with an icepick between his eyebrows driven in up to the handle. Aureli-ano Serrador had left his girl friend at her parents' house after having taken her to the movies and was returning through the well-lighted Street of the Turks when someone in the crowd who was never identified fired a revolver shot which knocked over into a caldron of boiling lard. A few minutes later someone knocked at the door of the room where Aureli-ano Arcaya was shut up with a woman and shouted to him: "Hurry up, they're killing your brothers." The woman who was with him said later that Aureli-ano Arcaya jumped out of bed and opened the door and was greeted with the discharge of a Mauser that split his head open. On that night of death, while the house was preparing to hold a wake for the four corpses, Fernanda ran through the town like a madwoman looking for Aureli-ano Segun-do, whom Petra Cotes had locked up in a closet, thinking that the order of extermination included all who bore the colonel's name. She would not let him out until the fourth day, when the telegrams received from different places along the coast made it clear that the fury of the invisible enemy was directed only at the brothers marked with the crosses of ash. Amaranta fetched the ledger where she had written down the facts about her nephews and as the telegrams arrived she drew lines through the names until only that of the eldest remained. They remembered him very well because of the contrast between his dark skin and his green eyes. His name was Aureli-ano Amador and he was a carpenter, living in a village hidden in the foothills. After waiting two weeks for the telegram telling of his death, Aureli-ano Segun-do sent a messenger to him in order to warn him, thinking that he might not know about the threat that hung over him. The emissary returned with the news that Aureli-ano Amador was safe. The night the extermination two men had gone to get him at his house and had shot at him with their revolvers but they had missed the cross of ashes. Aureli-ano Amador had been able to leap over the wall of the courtyard and was lost in the labyrinth of the mountains, which he knew like the back of his hand thanks to the friendship he maintained with the Indians, from whom he bought wood. Nothing more was heard of him.</p><p>随后整整一个星期，在海边不同的地方，奥雷连诺的十七个儿子都象兔子一样遭到隐蔽的歹徒袭击，歹徒专门瞄准灰十字的中心。晚上七时，奥雷连诺·特里斯特从自己的母亲家里出来，黑暗中突然一声枪响，子弹打穿了他的脑门。奥雷连诺·森腾诺是在工厂里他经常睡觉的吊床上被发现的，他的双眉之间插着一根碎冰锥，只有把手露在外面。奥雷连诺·塞拉多看完电影把女朋友送回了家，沿着灯火辉煌的上耳其人街回来的时候，藏在人群中的一个凶手用手枪向前看他射击，使得他直接倒在一口滚沸的油锅里。五分钟之后，有人敲了敲奥雷连诺·阿卡亚和他妻子的房门，呼叫了一声：“快，他们正在屠杀你的兄弟们啦，”后来这个女人说，奥雷连诺·阿卡亚跳下床，开了门，门外的一支毛瑟枪击碎了他的脑壳。在这死亡之夜里，家中的人准备为四个死者祈祷的时候，菲兰达象疯子似的奔过市镇去寻找自己的丈夫；佩特娜·柯特以为黑名单包括所有跟上校同名的人，已把奥雷连诺第二藏在衣橱里，直到第四天，从沿海各地拍来的电报知道，暗敌袭击的只是画了灰十字的弟兄。阿玛兰塔找出一个记录了侄儿们情况的小本子，收到一封封电报之后，她就划掉一个个名字，最后只剩了最大的一个奥雷连比的名字。家里的人清楚地记得他，因为他的黑皮肤和绿眼睛是对照鲜明的，他叫奥需连诺·阿马多，是个木匠，住在山麓的一个村子里，奥雷连诺上校等候他的死汛空等了两个星期，就派了一个人去警告奥雷连诺·阿马多，以为他可能不知道自己面临的危险。这个人回来报告说，奥雷连诺·阿马多安全无恙。在大屠杀的夜晚，有两个人到他那儿去，用手枪向他射击，可是未能击中灰十字。奥雷连诺·阿马多跳过院墙，就在山里消失了；由于跟出售木柴给他的印第安人一直友好往来，他知道那里的每一条小径，以后就再也没有听到他的消息了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Those were dark days for Colonel Aureli-ano Buendía. The president of the republic sent him a telegram of condolence in which he promised an exhaustive investigation and paid homage to the dead men. At his command, the mayor appeared at the services with four funeral wreaths, which he tried to place on the coffins, but the colonel ordered him into the street. After the burial he drew up personally submitted to the president of the republic a violent telegram, which the telegrapher refused to send. Then he enriched it terms of singular aggressiveness, put it in an envelope, and mailed it. As had happened the death of his wife, as had happened to him so many times during the war with the deaths of his best friends, he did not have a feeling of sorrow but a blind and directionless rage, a broad feeling of impotence. He even accused Father Antonio Isabel of complicity for having marked his sons with indelible ashes so that they-could be identified by their enemies. The decrepit priest, who could no longer string ideas together and who was beginning to startle his parishioners with the wild interpretations he gave from the pulpit, appeared one afternoon at the house with the goblet in which he had prepared the ashes that Wednesday and he tried to anoint the whole family with them to show that they could be washed off with water. But the horror of the misfortune had penetrated so deeply that not even Fernanda would let him experiment on her and never again was a Buendía seen to kneel at the altar rail on Ash Wednesday.</p><p>对奥雷连诺上校来说，这是黑暗的日子。共和国总统用电报向他表示慰问，答应进行彻底调查，并且赞扬死者。根据总统的指示，镇长带着四个花圈参加丧礼，想把它们放在棺材上，上校却把它们摆在街上。安葬之后，他拟了一份措词尖锐的电报给共和国总统，亲自送到邮电局，可是电报员拒绝拍发。于是，奥雷连诺上校用极不友好的问句充实了电文。放在信封里邮寄，就象妻子死后那样，也象战争中他的好友们死亡时多次经历过的那样，他感到的不是悲哀，而是盲目的愤怒和软弱无能，他甚至指责安东尼奥.伊萨贝尔是同谋犯，故意在他的儿子们脸上抹上擦洗不掉的十字，使得敌人能够认出他们。老朽的神父已经有点儿头脑昏馈，在讲坛上布道时竟胡乱解释《圣经》，吓唬教区居民；有一天下午，他拿着一个通常在大斋第一天用来盛圣灰的大碗，来到布恩蒂亚家里，想给全家的人抹上圣灰，表明圣灰是容易擦掉的。可是大家心中生怕倒霉，甚至菲兰达也不让他在她身上试验；以后，在大斋的第一天，再也没有一个布恩蒂亚家里的人跪在圣坛栏杆跟前了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Colonel Aureli-ano Buendía did not recover his calm for a long time. He abandoned the manufacture of little fishes, ate with great difficulty, and wandered all through the house as if walking in his sleep, dragging his blanket and chewing on his quiet rage. At the end of three months his hair was ashen, his old waxed mustache poured down beside his colorless lips, but, on the other hand, his eyes were once more the burning coals that had startled those who had seen him born that in other days had made chairs rock with a simple glance. In the fury of his torment he tried futilely to rouse the omens that had guided his youth along dangerous paths into the desolate wasteland of glory. He was lost, astray in a strange house where nothing and no one now stirred in him the slightest vestige of affection. Once he opened Melquíades' room, looking for the traces of a past from before the war, and he found only rubble, trash, piles of waste accumulated over all the years of abandonment. Between the covers of the books that no one had ever read again, in the old parchments damaged by dampness, a livid flower had prospered, and in the air that had been the purest and brightest in the house an unbearable smell of rotten memories floated. One morning he found úrsula weeping under the chestnut tree at the knees of her dead husband. Colonel Aureli-ano Buendía was the only inhabitant of the house who still did not see the powerful old man who had been beaten down by half a century in the open air. "Say hello to your father," úrsula told him. He stopped for an instant in front of the chestnut tree and once again he saw that the empty space before him did not arouse an affection either.</p><p>在很长时间里，奥雷连诺上校未能恢复失去的平静。他怀着满腔的怒火不再制作全鱼，勉强进点饮食，在地上拖着斗篷，象梦游人一样在房子里踱来踱去。到了第三个月末尾，他的头发完全白了，从前卷起的胡梢垂在没有血色的嘴唇两边，可是两只眼睛再一次成了两块燃烧的炭火；在他出生时，这两只眼睛曾把在场的人吓了一跳，而且两眼一扫就能让椅子移动。奥雷连诺上校满怀愤怒，妄图在自己身上找到某种预感，那种预感曾使他年轻时沿着危险的小道走向光荣的荒漠。他迷失在这座陌生的房子里，这里的任何人和任何东西都已激不起他的一点儿感情。有一次他走进梅尔加德斯的房间，打算找出战前的遗迹，但他只看见垃圾、秽物和各种破烂，这些都是荒芜多年之后堆积起来的。那些早已无人阅读的书，封面和羊皮纸已被潮气毁坏，布满了绿霉，而房子里往日最明净的空气，也充溢着难以忍受的腐烂气味。另一天早晨，他发现乌苏娜在栗树底下——她正把头伏在已故的丈夫膝上抽泣。在半个世纪的狂风暴雨中弄弯了腰的这个老头儿，奥雷连诺是个家长久没有看见过他的唯一的人。“向你父亲问安吧，”乌苏娜说。他在栗树前面停了片刻，再一次看见，即使这块主地也没激起他的任何感情。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“What does he say?”he asked.</p><p>“他在说什么呀！”奥雷连诺上校问道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"He's very sad," úrsula answered, "because he thinks that you're going to die."</p><p>“他很难过，”乌苏娜回答。“他以为你该死啦。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Tell him,”the colonel said, smiling, “that a person doesn’t die when he should but when he can.”</p><p>“告诉他吧，”上校笑着说。“人不是该死的时候死的，而是能死的时候死的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The omen of the, dead father stirred up the last remnant of pride that was left in his heart, but he confused it with a sudden gust of strength. It was for that reason that he hounded úrsula to tell him where in the courtyard the gold coins that they had found inside the plaster Saint Joseph were buried. "You'll never know," she told him with a firmness inspired by an old lesson. "One day," she added, "the owner of that fortune will appear and only he can dig it up." No one knew why a man who had always been so generous had begun to covet money with such anxiety, and not the modest amounts that would have been enough to resolve an emergency, but a fortune of such mad size that the mere mention of it left Aureli-ano Segun-do awash in amazement. His old fellow party members, to whom he went asking for help, hid so as not to receive him. It was around that time that he was heard to say. "The only difference today between Liberals and Conservatives is that the Liberals go to mass at five o'clock and the Conservatives at eight." Nevertheless he insisted with such perseverance, begged in such a way, broke his code dignity to such a degree, that with a little help from here and a little more from there, sneaking about everywhere, with a slippery diligence and a pitiless perseverance, he managed to put together in eight months more money than úrsula had buried. Then he visited the ailing Colonel Geri-neldo Márquez so that he would help him start the total war.</p><p>亡父的预言激起了他心中最后剩下的一点儿傲气，可是他把这种刹那间的傲气错误地当成了突然进发的力量。他向母亲追问，在圣约瑟夫石膏像里发现的金币究竟 藏在哪儿。“这你永远不会知道，”由于过去的痛苦教训，她坚定地说。“有朝一日财主来了，他才能把它挖出来，谁也无法理解，一个经常无私的人，为什么突然 贪婪地渴望钱财，渴望的不是日常需要的少数钱，而是一大笔财产只要提起这笔财产的数量，甚至奥雷连诺第二也惊得发呆。过去的党内同僚，奥雷连访问他们要钱，他们都避免跟他相见。下面这句话正是他这时说的：”现在，自由党人和保守党人之间的区别是：自由党人举行早祷，保守党人举行晚祷。“然而，他那么坚持不懈地努力，那么苦苦地恳求，那么不顾自尊心，四处奔走，每处都得到一点儿帮助，在八个月中弄到的钱就超过了乌苏娜所藏的数目。随后，他去患病的格林列尔多·马克斯上校，希望上校帮助他重新发动全面战争。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>At a certain time Colonel Geri-neldo Márquez was really the only one who could have pulled, even from his paralytics chair, the musty strings of rebellion. After the armistice of Neerlandia, while Colonel Aureli-ano Buendía took refuge with his little gold fishes, he kept in touch with the rebel officers who had been faithful to him until the defeat. With them he waged the sad war of daily humiliation, of entreaties and petitions, of come-back-tomorrow, of any-time-now, of we're-studying--your-case-with-the-proper-attention; the war hopelessly lost against the many yours-most-trulys who should have signed and would never sign the lifetime pensions. The other war, the bloody one of twenty years, did not cause them as much damage as the corrosive war of eternal postponements. Even Colonel Geri-neldo Márquez, who escaped three attempts on his life, survived five wounds, and emerged unscathed from innumerable battles, succumbed to that atrocious siege of waiting and sank into the miserable defeat of old age, thinking of Amaranta among the diamond-shaped patches of light in a borrowed house. </p><p>有一段时间，格林列尔多上校虽然瘫倒在摇椅里，却真是唯一能够拉动起义操纵杆的人。 在尼兰德停故协定之后，当奥雷连诺上校躲在小金鱼中间的时候，格林列尔多·马克斯上校仍跟那些最终没有背弃他的起义军官保持着联系。他跟他们又经历了一场战争，这场战争就是经常丢脸、祈求、申请，就是没完没了的回答：“明天来吧”，“已经快啦”，“我们正公认真研究你的问题”；这场注定失败的战争是反对 “敬启者”的，反对“你的忠实仆人”的，他们一直答应发给老兵终身养老金，可是始终不给。前一场血腥的二十年战争给予老兵的损害，都比不上这一场永远拖延的毁灭性战争。格林列尔多·马克斯上校本人逃脱过三次谋杀，五次负伤未死，在无数次战斗中安然无损，由于忍受不了无穷等待的折磨，就接受了最终的失败衰老；他坐在自己的摇椅里，望着地板上透进的阳光，思念着阿玛兰塔。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The last veterans of whom he had word had appeared photographed in a newspaper with their faces shamelessly raised beside an anonymous president of the republic who gave them buttons with his likeness on them to wear in their lapels and returned to them a flag soiled with blood and gunpowder so that they could place it on their coffins. The others, more honorable. were still waiting for a letter in the shadow of public charity, dying of hunger, living through rage, ratting of old age amid the exquisite shit of glory. So that when Colonel Aureli-ano Buendía invited him to start a mortal conflagration that would wipe out all vestiges of a regime of corruption and scandal backed by the foreign invader, Colonel Geri-neldo Márquez could not hold back a shudder of compassion.</p><p>他再也没有见到自己的战友们，只有一次在报上看见一张照片，几个老兵站在一个不知名的共和国总统旁边，无耻地仰着面孔；总统拿自己的像章赠给他们，让他们戴在翻领上面，并且归还他们一面沾满尘土和鲜血的旗帜，让他们能把它 放在自己的棺材上。其他最体面的老兵，仍在社会慈善团体的照顾下等待养老金的消息；其中一些人饿得要死，另一些人继续在恼怒中过着晚年生活，并且在光荣的 粪堆里慢慢地腐烂。因此，奥雷连诺上校前来找他，主张誓死点燃无情的战火，推翻外国侵略者支持的腐败透顶的可耻的政府时，格林列尔多简直无法压抑自己怜悯 的感情。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Oh, Aureli-ano," he sighed. "I already knew that you were old, but now I realize that you're a lot older than you look."</p><p>“唉，奥雷连诺，”他叹了口气。“我知道你老了，可我今天才明白，你比看上去老得多了。”</p></div>
