<div class='layout'><p>Chapter 1</p><p>十月文艺出版社高长荣版</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>MANY YEARS LATER as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice. At that time Macondo was a village of twenty adobe houses, built on the bank of a river of clear water that ran along a bed of polished stones, which were white and enormous, like prehistoric eggs. </p><p>多年以后，奥雷连诺上校站在行刑队面前，准会想起父亲带他去参观冰块的那个遥远的下午。当时，马孔多是个二十户人家的村庄，一座座土房都盖在河岸上，河水清澈，沿着遍布石头的河床流去，河里的石头光滑、洁白，活象史前的巨蛋。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The world was so recent that many things lacked names, and in order to indicate them it was necessary to point. Every year during the month of March a family of ragged gypsies would set up their tents near the village, and with a great uproar of pipes and kettledrums they would display new inventions. First they brought the magnet. A heavy gypsy with an untamed beard and sparrow hands, who introduced himself as Melquíades, put on a bold public demonstration he himself called the eighth wonder of the learned alchemists of Macedonia. He went from house to house dragging two metal ingots and everybody was amazed to see pots, pans, tongs, and braziers tumble down from their places and beams creak from the desperation of nails and screws trying to emerge, and even objects that had been lost for a long time appeared from where they had been searched for most and went dragging along in turbulent confusion behind Melquíades' magical irons. "Things have a life of their own," the gypsy proclaimed with a harsh accent. "It's simply a matter of waking up their souls." José Arcadio Buendía, whose unbridled imagination always went beyond the genius of nature and even beyond miracles and magic, thought that it would be possible to make use of that useless invention to extract gold from the bowels of the earth. </p><p>这块天地还是新开辟的，许多东西都叫不出名字，不得不用手指指点点。每年三月，衣衫褴楼的吉卜赛人都要在村边搭起帐篷，在笛鼓的喧嚣声中，向马孔多的居民介绍科学家的最新发明。他们首先带来的是磁铁。一个身躯高大的吉卜赛人，自称梅尔加德斯，满脸络腮胡子，手指瘦得象鸟的爪子，向观众出色地表演了他所谓的马其顿炼金术士创造的世界第八奇迹。他手里拿着两大块磁铁，从一座农舍走到另一座农舍，大家都惊异地看见，铁锅、铁盆、铁钳、铁炉都从原地倒下，木板上的钉子和螺丝嘎吱嘎吱地拼命想挣脱出来，甚至那些早就丢失的东西也从找过多次的地方兀然出现，乱七八糟地跟在梅尔加德斯的魔铁后面。“东西也是有生命的，”吉卜赛人用刺耳的声调说，“只消唤起它们的灵性。”霍·阿·布恩蒂亚狂热的想象力经常超过大自然的创造力，甚至越过奇迹和魔力的限度，他认为这种暂时无用的科学发明可以用来开采地下的金子。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Melquíades, who was an honest man, warned him: "It won't work for that." But José Arcadio Buendía at that time did not believe in the honesty of gypsies, so he traded his mule and a pair of goats for the two magnetized ingots. úrsula Iguarán, his wife, who relied on those animals to increase their poor domestic holdings, was unable to dissuade him. "Very soon well have gold enough and more to pave the floors of the house," her husband replied. For several months he worked hard to demonstrate the truth of his idea. He explored every inch of the region, even the riverbed, dragging the two iron ingots along and reciting Melquíades' incantation aloud. The only thing he succeeded in doing was to unearth a suit fifteenth-century armor which had all of its pieces soldered together with rust and inside of which there was the hollow resonance of an enormous stone-filled gourd. </p><p>梅尔加德斯是个诚实的人，他告诫说： “磁铁干这个却不行。”可是霍·阿·布恩蒂亚当时还不相信吉卜赛人的诚实，因此用自己的一匹骡子和两只山羊换下了两块磁铁。这些家畜是他的妻子打算用来振兴破败的家业的，她试图阻止他，但是枉费工夫。“咱们很快就会有足够的金子，用来铺家里的地都有余啦。”--丈夫回答她。在好儿个月里，霍·阿·布恩蒂亚都顽强地努力履行自己的诺言。他带者两块磁铁，大声地不断念着梅尔加德斯教他的咒语，勘察了周围整个地区的一寸寸土地，甚至河床。但他掘出的唯一的东西，是十五世纪的一件铠甲，它的各部分都已锈得连在一起，用手一敲，皑甲里面就发出空洞的回声，仿佛一只塞满石子的大葫芦。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When José Arcadio Buendía and the four men of his expedition managed to take the armor apart, they found inside a calcified skeleton with a copper locket containing a woman's hair around its neck.</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In March the gypsies returned. This time they brought a telescope and a magnifying glass the size of a drum, which they exhibited as the latest discovery of the Jews of Amsterdam. They placed a gypsy woman at one end of the village and set up the telescope at the entrance to the tent. For the price of five reales, people could look into the telescope see the gypsy woman an arm's length away. "Science has eliminated distance," Melquíades proclaimed. "In a short time, man will be able to see what is happening in any place in the world without leaving his own house." A burning noonday sun brought out a startling demonstration with the gigantic magnifying glass: they put a pile of dry hay in the middle of the street and set it on fire by concentrating the sun's rays. </p><p>三月间，吉卜赛人又来了。现在他们带来的是一架望远镜和一只大小似鼓的放大镜，说是阿姆斯特丹犹太人的最新发明。他们把望远镜安在帐篷门口，而让一个吉卜赛女人站在村子尽头。花五个里亚尔，任何人都可从望远镜里看见那个仿佛近在飓尺的吉卜赛女人。“科学缩短了距离。”梅尔加德斯说。“在短时期内，人们足不出户，就可看到世界上任何地方发生的事儿。”在一个炎热的晌午，吉卜赛人用放大镜作了一次惊人的表演：他们在街道中间放了一堆干草，借太阳光的焦点让干草燃了起来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>José Arcadio Buendía, who had still not been consoled for the failure of big magnets, conceived the idea of using that invention as a weapon of war. Again Melquíades tried to dissuade him, but he finally accepted the two magnetized ingots and three colonial coins in exchange for the magnifying glass. úrsula wept in consternation. That money was from a chest of gold coins that her father had put together ova an entire life of privation and that she had buried underneath her bed in hopes of a proper occasion to make use of it. José Arcadio Buendía made no attempt to console her, completely absorbed in his tactical experiments with the abnegation of a scientist and even at the risk of his own life. In an attempt to show the effects of the glass on enemy troops, he exposed himself to the concentration of the sun's rays and suffered burns which turned into sores that took a long time to heal. Over the protests of his wife, who was alarmed at such a dangerous invention, at one point he was ready to set the house on fire. </p><p>磁铁的试验失败之后，霍·阿·布恩蒂亚还不甘心，马上又产生了利用这个发明作为作战武器的念头。梅尔加德斯又想劝阻他，但他终于同意用两块磁铁和三枚殖民地时期的金币交换放大镜。乌苏娜伤心得流了泪。这些钱是从一盒金鱼币拿出来的，那盒金币由她父亲一生节衣缩食积攒下来，她一直把它埋藏在自个儿床下，想在适当的时刻使用。霍·阿·布恩蒂亚无心抚慰妻子，他以科学家的忘我精神，甚至冒着生命危险，一头扎进了作战试验。他想证明用放大镜对付敌军的效力，把阳光的焦点射到自己身上，因此受到灼伤，伤处溃烂，很久都没痊愈。这种危险的发明把他的妻子吓坏了，但他不顾妻子的反对，有一次甚至准备点燃自己的房子。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He would spend hours on end in his room, calculating the strategic possibilities of his novel weapon until he succeeded in putting together a manual of startling instructional clarity and an irresistible power of conviction. He sent it to the government, accompanied by numerous descriptions of his experiments and several pages of explanatory sketches; by a messenger who crossed the mountains, got lost in measureless swamps, forded stormy rivers, and was on the point of perishing under the lash of despair, plague, and wild beasts until he found a route that joined the one used by the mules that carried the mail. In spite of the fact that a trip to the capital was little less than impossible at that time, José Arcadio Buendía promised to undertake it as soon as the government ordered him to so that he could put on some practical demonstrations of his invention for the military authorities and could train them himself in the complicated art of solar war. For several years he waited for an answer. </p><p>霍·阿·布恩蒂亚待在自己的房间里总是一连几个小时，计算新式武器的战略威力，甚至编写了一份使用这种武器的《指南》，阐述异常清楚，论据确凿有力。他把这份《指南》连同许多试验说明和几幅图解，请一个信使送给政府；这个信使翻过山岭，涉过茫茫苍苍的沼地，游过汹涌澎湃的河流，冒着死于野兽和疫病的危阶，终于到了一条驿道。当时前往首都尽管是不大可能的，霍·阿·布恩蒂亚还是答应，只要政府一声令下，他就去向军事长官们实际表演他的发明，甚至亲自训练他们掌握太阳战的复杂技术。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Finally, tired of waiting, he bemoaned to Melquíades the failure of his project and the gypsy then gave him a convincing proof of his honesty: he gave him back the doubloons in exchange for the magnifying glass, and he left him in addition some Portuguese maps and several instruments of navigation. In his own handwriting he set down a concise synthesis of the studies by Monk Hermann. which he left José Arcadio so that he would be able to make use of the astrolabe, the compass, and the sextant. José Arcadio Buendía spent the long months of the rainy season shut up in a small room that he had built in the rear the house so that no one would disturb his experiments. Having completely abandoned his domestic obligations, he spent entire nights in the courtyard watching the course of the stars and he almost contracted sunstroke from trying to establish an exact method to ascertain noon. When he became an expert in the use and manipulation of his instruments, he conceived a notion of space that allowed him to navigate across unknown seas, to visit uninhabited territories, and to establish relations with splendid beings without having to leave his study. That was the period in which he acquired the habit of talking to himself, of walking through the house without paying attention to anyone, as úrsula and the children broke their backs in the garden, growing banana and caladium, cassava and yams, ahuyama roots and eggplants. </p><p>他等待答复等了几年。最后等得厌烦了，他就为这新的失败埋怨梅尔加德斯，于是吉卜赛人令人信服地证明了自己的诚实：他归还了金币，换回了放大镜，并且给了霍·阿·布恩蒂亚几幅葡萄牙航海图和各种航海仪器。梅尔加德斯亲手记下了修道士赫尔曼著作的简要说明，把记录留给霍·阿·布恩蒂亚，让他知道如何使用观象仪、罗盘和六分仪。在雨季的漫长月份里，霍·阿·布恩蒂亚部把自己关在宅子深处的小房间里，不让别人打扰他的试验。他完全抛弃了家务，整夜整夜呆在院子里观察星星的运行；为了找到子午线的确定方法，他差点儿中了暑。他完全掌握了自己的仪器以后，就设想出了空间的概念，今后，他不走出自己的房间，就能在陌生的海洋上航行，考察荒无人烟的土地，并且跟珍禽异兽打上交道了。正是从这个时候起，他养成了自言自语的习惯，在屋子里踱来踱去，对谁也不答理，而乌苏娜和孩子们却在菜园里忙得喘不过气来，照料香蕉和海芋、木薯和山药、南瓜和茄子。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Suddenly, without warning, his feverish activity was interrupted and was replaced by a kind of fascination. He spent several days as if he were bewitched, softly repeating to himself a string of fearful conjectures without giving credit to his own understanding. Finally, one Tuesday in December, at lunchtime, all at once he released the whole weight of his torment. The children would remember for the rest of their lives the august solemnity with which their father, devastated by his prolonged vigil and by the wrath of his imagination, revealed his discovery to them:</p><p>可是不久，霍·阿·布恩蒂亚紧张的工作突然停辍，他陷入一种种魄颠倒的状态。好几天，他仿佛中了魔，总是低声地嘟嚷什么，并为自己反复斟酌的各种假设感到吃惊，自己都不相信。最后，在十二月里的一个星期、吃午饭的时候，他忽然一下子摆脱了恼人的疑虑。孩子们至死部记得，由于长期熬夜和冥思苦想而变得精疲力竭的父亲，如何洋洋得意地向他们宣布自己的发现：</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The earth is round, like an orange."</p><p>“地球是圆的，象橙子。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>úrsula lost her patience. "If you have to go crazy, please go crazy all by yourself!" she shouted. "But don't try to put your gypsy ideas into the heads of the children." José Arcadio Buendía, impassive, did not let himself be frightened by the desperation of his wife, who, in a seizure of rage, mashed the astrolabe against the floor. He built another one, he gathered the men of the village in his little room, and he demonstrated to them, with theories that none of them could understand, the possibility of returning to where one had set out by consistently sailing east. The whole village was convinced that José Arcadio Buendía had lost his reason, when Melquíades returned to set things straight. He gave public praise to the intelligence of a man who from pure astronomical speculation had evolved a theory that had already been proved in practice, although unknown in Macondo until then, and as a proof of his admiration he made him a gift that was to have a profound influence on the future of the village: the laboratory of an alchemist.</p><p>乌苏娜失去了耐心，“如果你想发癫，你就自个几发吧！”她嚷叫起来，“别给孩子们的脑瓜里灌输古卜赛人的胡思乱想。”霍·阿·布恩蒂亚一动不动，妻子气得把观象仪摔到地上，也没有吓倒他。他另做了一个观象仪，并且把村里的一些男人召到自己的小房间里，根据在场的人谁也不明白的理论，向他们证明说，如果一直往东航行，就能回到出发的地点。马孔多的人以为霍·阿·布恩蒂亚疯了，可兄梅尔加德斯回来之后，马上消除了大家的疑虑。他大声地赞扬霍·阿·布恩蒂亚的智慧：光靠现象仪的探测就证实了一种理论，这种理论虽是马孔多的居民至今还不知道的，但实际上早就证实了；梅尔加德斯为了表示钦佩，赠给霍·阿·布恩蒂亚一套东西－－炼金试验室设备，这对全村的未来将会产生深远的影响。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>By then Melquíades had aged with surprising rapidity. On his first trips he seemed to be the same age as José Arcadio Buendía. But while the latter had preserved his extraordinary strength, which permitted him to pull down a horse by grabbing its ears, the gypsy seemed to have been worn dowse by some tenacious illness. It was, in reality, the result of multiple and rare diseases contracted on his innumerable trips around the world. According to what he himself said as he spoke to José Arcadio Buendía while helping him set up the laboratory, death followed him everywhere, sniffing at the cuffs of his pants, but never deciding to give him the final clutch of its claws. He was a fugitive from all the plagues and catastrophes that had ever lashed mankind. He had survived pellagra in Persia, scurvy in the Malayan archipelago, leprosy in Alexandria, beriberi in Japan, bubonic plague in Madagascar, an earthquake in Sicily, and a disastrous shipwreck in the Strait of Magellan. </p><p>这时，梅尔加德斯很快就衰老了。这个吉卜赛人第一次来到村里的时候，仿佛跟霍·阿·布思蒂亚同样年岁。可他当时仍有非凡的力气，揪住马耳朵就能把马拉倒，现在他却好象被一些顽固的疾病折磨坏了。确实，他衰老的原因是他在世界各地不断流浪时得过各种罕见的疾病，帮助霍·阿·布恩蒂亚装备试验室的时候，他说死神到处都紧紧地跟着他，可是死神仍然没有最终决定要他的命。从人类遇到的各种瘟疫和灾难中，他幸存下来了。他在波斯患过癞病，在马来亚群岛患过坏血病，在亚历山大患过麻疯病，在日本患过脚气病，在马达加斯加患过淋巴腺鼠疫，在西西里碰到过地震，在麦哲伦海峡遇到过牺牲惨重的轮船失事。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>That prodigious creature, said to possess the keys of Nostradamus, was a gloomy man, enveloped in a sad aura, with an Asiatic look that seemed to know what there was on the other side of things. He wore a large black hat that looked like a raven with widespread wings, and a velvet vest across which the patina of the centuries had skated. But in spite of his immense wisdom and his mysterious breadth, he had a human burden, an earthly condition that kept him involved in the small problems of daily life. He would complain of the ailments of old age, he suffered from the most insignificant economic difficulties, and he had stopped laughing a long time back because scurvy had made his teeth drop out. On that suffocating noontime when the gypsy revealed his secrets, José Arcadio Buendía had the certainty that it was the beginning of a great friendship. The children were startled by his fantastic stories. Aureliano, who could not have been more than five at the time, would remember him for the rest of his life as he saw him that afternoon, sitting against the metallic and quivering light from the window, lighting up with his deep organ voice the darkest reaches of the imagination, while down over his temples there flowed the grease that was being melted by the heat. José Arcadio, his older brother, would pass on that wonderful image as a hereditary memory to all of his descendants. úrsula on the other hand, held a bad memory of that visit, for she had entered the room just as Melquíades had carelessly broken a flask of bichloride of mercury.</p><p>这个不寻常的人说他知道纳斯特拉马斯的秘诀。此人面貌阴沉，落落寡欢，戴着一顶大帽子，宽宽的黑色帽沿宛如乌鸦张开的翅膀，而他身上的丝绒坎肩却布满了多年的绿霉。然而，尽管他无比聪明和神秘莫测，他终归是有血打肉的人，摆脱不了人世间日常生活的烦恼和忧虑。他抱怨年老多病，苦于微不足道的经济困难，早就没有笑容，因为坏血病已使他的牙齿掉光了。霍·阿·布恩蒂亚认为，正是那个闷热的晌午，梅尔加德斯把白己的秘密告诉他的时候，他们的伟大友谊才开了头。吉卜赛人的神奇故事使得孩子们感到惊讶。当时不过五岁的奥雷连诺一辈子都记得，梅尔加德斯坐在明晃晃的窗子跟前，身体的轮廓十分清晰；他那风琴一般低沉的声音透进了最暗的幻想的角落，而他的两鬓却流着汗水，仿佛暑热熔化了的脂肪。奥雷连诺的哥哥霍·阿卡蒂奥，将把这个惊人的形象当作留下的回忆传给他所有的后代。至于乌苏娜，恰恰相反，吉卜赛人的来访给她留下了最不愉快的印象，因为她跨进房间的时候，正巧梅尔加德斯不小心打碎了一瓶升汞。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It's the smell of the devil," she said.</p><p>“这是魔鬼的气味，”她说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Not at all," Melquíades corrected her. "It has been proven that the devil has sulphuric properties and this is just a little corrosive sublimate."</p><p>“根本不是，”梅尔加德斯纠正她。“别人证明魔鬼只有硫磺味，这儿不过是一点点升汞。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Always didactic, he went into a learned exposition of the diabolical properties of cinnabar, but úrsula paid no attention to him, although she took the children off to pray. That biting odor would stay forever in her mind linked to the memory of Melquíades.</p><p>接着，他用同样教诲的口吻大谈特谈朱砂的特性。乌苏娜对他的话没有任何兴趣，就带着孩子祈祷去了。后来，这种刺鼻的气味经常使她想起梅尔加德斯。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The rudimentary laboratory—in addition to a profusion of pots, funnels, retorts, filters, and sieves—was made up of a primitive water pipe, a glass beaker with a long, thin neck, a reproduction of the philosopher’s egg, and a still the gypsies themselves had built in accordance with modern descriptions of the three-armed alembic of Mary the Jew. Along with those items, Melquíades left samples of the seven metals that corresponded to the seven planets, the formulas of Moses and Zosimus for doubling the quantity of gold, and a set of notes and sketches concerning the processes of the Great Teaching that would permit those who could interpret them to undertake the manufacture of the philosopher’s stone. Seduced by the simplicity of the formulas to double the quantity of gold, Jos?Arcadio Buendía paid court to ?rsula for several weeks so that she would let him dig up her colonial coins and increase them by as many times as it was possible to subdivide mercury. ?rsula gave in, as always, to her husband’s unyielding obstinacy. Then Jos?Arcadio Buendía threw three doubloons into a pan and fused them with copper filings, orpiment, brimstone, and lead. He put it all to boil in a pot of castor oil until he got a thick and pestilential syrup which was more like common caramel than valuable gold. In risky and desperate processes of distillation, melted with the seven planetary metals, mixed with hermetic mercury and vitriol of Cyprus, and put back to cook in hog fat for lack of any radish oil, ?rsula’s precious inheritance was reduced to a large piece of burnt hog cracklings that was firmly stuck to the bottom of the pot.</p><p>除了许多铁锅、漏斗、曲颈瓶、筛子和过滤器，简陋的试验室里还有普通熔铁炉、长颈玻璃烧瓶、点金石仿制品以及三臂蒸馏器；此种蒸馏器是犹太女人马利姬曾经用过的，现由吉卜赛人自己按照最新说明制成。此外，梅尔加德斯还留下了七种与六个星球有关的金属样品、摩西和索西莫斯的倍金方案、炼金术笔记和图解，谁能识别这些笔记和图解，谁就能够制作点金石。霍·阿·布恩蒂亚认为倍金方案比较简单，就入迷了。他一连几个星期缠住乌苏娜，央求她从密藏的小盒子里掏出旧金币来，让金子成倍地增加，水银能够分成多少份，金子就能增加多少倍。象往常一样，乌苏娜没有拗过大夫的固执要求。于是，霍·阿·布恩蒂亚把三十枚金币丢到铁锅里，拿它们跟雌黄、铜屑、水银和铅一起熔化。然后又把这一切倒在蓖麻油锅里，在烈火上熬了一阵。直到最后熬成一锅恶臭的浓浆，不象加倍的金子，倒象普通的焦糖。经过多次拼命的、冒阶的试验：蒸馏啦，跟七种天体金属一起熔炼啦，加进黑梅斯水银和塞浦路斯硫酸盐啦，在猪油里重新熬煮啦（因为没有萝卜油），乌苏娜的宝贵遗产变成了一大块焦糊的渣滓，粘在锅底了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When the gypsies came back, ?rsula had turned the whole population of the village against them. But curiosity was greater than fear, for that time the gypsies went about the town making a deafening noise with all manner of musical instruments while a hawker announced the exhibition of the most fabulous discovery of the Naciancenes. So that everyone went to the tent and by paying one cent they saw a youthful Melquíades, recovered, unwrinkled, with a new and flashing set of teeth. Those who remembered his gums that had been destroyed by scurvy, his flaccid cheeks, and his withered lips trembled with fear at the final proof of the gypsy’s supernatural power. The fear turned into panic when Melquíades took out his teeth, intact, encased in their gums, and showed them to the audience for an instant—a fleeting instant in which he went back to being the same decrepit man of years past—and put them back again and smiled once more with the full control of his restored youth. Even Jos?Arcadio Buendía himself considered that Melquíades?knowledge had reached unbearable extremes, but he felt a healthy excitement when the gypsy explained to him atone the workings of his false teeth. It seemed so simple and so prodigious at the same time that overnight he lost all interest in his experiments in alchemy. He underwent a new crisis of bad humor. He did not go back to eating regularly, and he would spend the day walking through the house. “Incredible things are happening in the world,?he said to ?rsula. “Right there across the river there are all kinds of magical instruments while we keep on living like donkeys.?Those who had known him since the foundation of Macondo were startled at how much he had changed under Melquíades' influence.</p><p>吉卜赛人回来的时候，乌苏娜唆使全村的人反对他们，可是好奇战胜了恐惧，因为吉卜赛人奏着各式各样的乐器，闹嚷嚷地经过街头，他们的宣传员说是要展出纳希安兹人最奇的发明。大家都到吉卜赛人的帐篷去，花一分钱，就可看到返老还童的梅尔加德斯－－身体康健，没有皱纹，满口漂亮的新牙。有些人还记得他坏血病毁掉的牙床、凹陷的面颊、皱巴巴的嘴唇，一见吉卜赛人神通广大的最新证明，都惊得发抖。接着，梅尔加从嘴里取出一副完好的牙齿，刹那间又变成往日那个老朽的人，并且拿这副牙齿给观众看了一看，然后又把它装上牙床，微微一笑，似乎重新恢复了青春，这时大家的惊愕却变成了狂欢。甚至霍·阿·布恩蒂亚本人也认为，梅尔加德斯的知识到了不大可能达到的极限，可是当吉卜赛人单独向他说明假牙的构造时，他的心也就轻快了，高兴得放声大笑。霍·阿·布恩蒂亚觉得这一切既简单又奇妙，第二天他就完全失去了对炼金术的兴趣，陷入了沮丧状态，不再按时进餐，从早到晚在屋子里踱来踱去。“世界上正在发生不可思议的事，”他向乌苏娜唠叨。“咱们旁边，就在河流对岸，已有许多各式各样神奇的机器，可咱们仍在这儿象蠢驴一样过日子。”马孔多建立时就了解他的人都感到惊讶，在梅尔加德斯的影响下，他的变化多大啊！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>At first Jose Arcadio Buendía had been a kind of youthful patriarch who would give instructions for planting and advice for the raising of children and animals, and who collaborated with everyone, even in the physical work, for the welfare of the community. Since his house from the very first had been the best in the village, the others had been built in its image and likeness. It had a small, well-lighted living roost, a dining room in the shape of a terrace gaily colored flowers, two bedrooms, a courtyard with a gigantic chestnut tree, a well kept garden, and a corral where goats, pigs, and hens lived in peaceful communion. The only animals that were prohibited, not just in his house but in the entire settlement, were fighting cocks.</p><p>从前，霍·阿·布恩蒂亚好象一个年轻的族长，经常告诉大家如何播种，如何教养孩子，如何饲养家畜；他跟大伙儿一起劳动，为全村造福。布恩蒂亚家的房子是村里最好的，其他的人都力求象他一样建筑自己的住所。他的房子有一个敞亮的小客厅、摆了一盆盆鲜花的阳台餐室和两间卧室，院子里栽了一棵挺大的栗树，房后是一座细心照料的菜园，还有一个畜栏，猪、鸡和山羊在栏里和睦相处。他家里禁养斗鸡，全村也都禁养斗鸡。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>úrsula's capacity for work was the same as that of her husband. Active, small, severe, that woman of unbreakable nerves who at no moment in her life had been heard to sing seemed to be everywhere, from dawn until quite late at night, always pursued by the soft whispering stiff, starched petticoats. Thanks to her the floors of tamped earth, the unwhitewashed mud walls, the rustic, wooden furniture they had built themselves were always dean, and the old chests where they kept their clothes exhaled the warm smell of basil.</p><p>乌苏娜象丈夫一样勤劳。她是一个严肃、活跃和矮小的女人，意志坚强，大概一辈子都没唱过歌，每天从黎明到深夜，四处都有她的踪影，到处都能听到她那浆过的荷兰亚麻布裙子轻微的沙沙声。多亏她勤于照料，夯实的泥土地面、未曾粉刷的上墙、粗糙的自制木器，经常都是千干净净的，而保存衣服的旧箱子还散发出紫苏轻淡的芳香。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>José Arcadio Buendía, who was the most enterprising man ever to be seen in the village, had set up the placement of the houses in such a way that from all of them one could reach the river and draw water with the same effort, and he had lined up the streets with such good sense that no house got more sun than another during the hot time of day. Within a few years Macondo was a village that was more orderly and hard working than any known until then by its three hundred inhabitants. It was a truly happy village where no one was over thirty years of age and where no one had died.</p><p>霍·阿·布恩蒂亚是村里最有事业心的人，他指挥建筑的房屋，每家的主人到河边去取水都同样方便；他合理设计的街道，每座住房白天最热的时刻都能得到同样的阳光。建村之后过了几年，马孔多已经成了一个最整洁的村子，这是跟全村三百个居民过去住过的其他一切村庄都不同的。这是一个真正幸福的村子；在这村子里，谁也没有超过三十岁，也还没有死过一个人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Since the time of its founding, José Arcadio Buendía had built traps and cages. In a short time he filled not only his own house but all of those in the village with troupials, canaries, bee eaters, and redbreasts. The concert of so many different birds became so disturbing that úrsula would plug her ears with beeswax so as not to lose her sense of reality. The first time that Melquíades' tribe arrived, selling glass balls for headaches, everyone was surprised that they had been able to find that village lost in the drowsiness of the swamp, and the gypsies confessed that they had found their way by the song of the birds.</p><p>建村的时候，霍·阿·布恩蒂亚开始制作套索和鸟笼。很快，他自己和村中其他的人家都养了拟椋鸟、金丝雀、蜂虎和知更鸟。许多各式各样的鸟儿不断地嘁嘁喳喳，乌苏娜生怕自己震得发聋，只好用蜂蜡把耳朵塞上。梅尔加德斯一伙人第一次来到马孔多出售玻璃球头痛药时，村民们根本就不明白这些吉卜赛人如何能够找到这个小小的村子，因为这个村子是隐没在辽阔的沼泽地带的；吉卜赛人说，他们来到这儿是由于听到了鸟的叫声。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>That spirit of social initiative disappeared in a short time, pulled away by the fever of the magnets, the astronomical calculations, the dreams transmutation, the urge to discover the wonders of the world. From a clean and active man, José Arcadio Buendía changed into a man lazy in appearance, careless in his dress, with a wild beard that úrsula managed to trim great effort and a kitchen knife. There were many who considered him the victim of some strange spell. But even those most convinced of his madness left work family to follow him when he brought out his tools to clear the land and asked the assembled group to open a way that would put Macondo in contact with the great inventions.</p><p>可是，霍·阿·布恩蒂亚为社会造福的精神很快消失，他迷上了磁铁和天文探索，幻想采到金子和发现世界的奇迹。精力充沛、衣着整洁的霍·阿·布恩蒂业逐渐变成一个外表疏懒、衣冠不整的人，甚至满脸胡髭，乌苏娜费了大劲才用一把锋利的菜刀把他的胡髭剃掉。村里的许多人都认为，霍·阿·布恩蒂亚中了邪。不过，他把一个袋子搭在肩上，带着铁锹和锄头，要求别人去帮助他开辟一条道路，以便把马孔多和那些伟大发明连接起来的时候，甚至坚信他发了疯的人也扔下自己的家庭与活计，跟随他去冒险。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>José Arcadio Buendía was completely ignorant of the geography of the region. He knew that to the east there lay an impenetrable mountain chain and that on the other side of the mountains there was the ardent city of Riohacha, where in times past-according to what he had been told by the first Aureliano Buendía, his grandfather-Sir Francis Drake had gone crocodile hunting with cannons and that he repaired hem and stuffed them with straw to bring to Queen Elizabeth. In his youth, José Arcadio Buendía and his men, with wives and children, animals and all kinds of domestic implements, had crossed the mountains in search of an outlet to the sea, and after twenty-six months they gave up the expedition and founded Macondo, so they would not have to go back. It was, therefore, a route that did not interest him, for it could lead only to the past. To the south lay the swamps, covered with an eternal vegetable scum and the whole vast universe of the great swamp, which, according to what the gypsies said, had no limits. The great swamp in the west mingled a boundless extension of water where there were soft-skinned cetaceans that had the head and torso of a woman, causing the ruination of sailors with the charm of their extraordinary breasts. The gypsies sailed along that route for six months before they reached the strip of land over which the mules that carried the mail passed. According to José Arcadio Buendía's calculations, the only possibility contact with civilization lay along the northern route. So he handed out clearing tools and hunting weapons to the same men who had been with him during the founding of Macondo. He threw his directional instruments and his maps into a knapsack, and he undertook the reckless adventure.</p><p>霍·阿·布恩蒂亚压根儿不了解周围地区的地理状况。他只知道，东边耸立着难以攀登的山岭，山岭后面是古城列奥阿察，据他的祖父--奥雷连诺·布恩蒂亚第一说，从前有个弗兰西斯·德拉克爵士，曾在那儿开炮轰击鳄鱼消遣；他叫人在轰死的鳄鱼肚里填进干草，补缀好了就送去献给伊丽莎白女王。年轻的时候，霍·阿·布恩蒂亚和其他的人一起，带着妻子、孩子、家畜和各种生活用具，翻过这个山岭，希望到海边去，可是游荡了两年又两个月，就放弃了自己的打算；为了不走回头路，才建立了马孔乡村。因此，往东的路是他不感兴趣的--那只能重复往日的遭遇，南边是一个个永远杂草丛生的泥潭和一大片沼泽地带--据吉卜赛人证明，那是一个无边无涯的世界。西边呢，沼泽变成了辽阔的水域，那儿栖息着鲸鱼状的生物：这类生物，皮肤细嫩，头和躯干都象女了，宽大、迷人的胸脯常常毁掉航海的人。据吉卜赛人说，他们到达驿道经过的陆地之前，航行了几乎半年。霍·阿·布恩蒂亚认为，跟文明世界接触，只能往北前进。于是，他让那些跟他一起建立马孔多村的人带上铁锹、锄头和狩猎武器，把自己的定向仪具和地图放进背囊，就去从事鲁莽的冒险了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>During the first days they did not come across any appreciable obstacle. They went down along the stony bank of the river to the place where years before they had found the soldier's armor, and from there they went into the woods along a path between wild orange trees. At the end of the first week they killed and roasted a deer, but they agreed to eat only half of it and salt the rest for the days that lay ahead. With that precaution they tried to postpone the necessity of having to eat macaws, whose blue flesh had a harsh and musky taste. Then, for more than ten days, they did not see the sun again. The ground became soft and damp, like volcanic ash, and the vegetation was thicker and thicker, and the cries of the birds and the uproar of the monkeys became more more remote, and the world became eternally sad. The men on the expedition felt overwhelmed by their most ancient memories in that paradise of dampness and silence, going back to before original sin, as their boots sank into pools of steaming oil and their machetes destroyed bloody lilies and golden salamanders. For a week, almost without speaking, they went ahead like sleepwalkers through a universe of grief, lighted only by the tenuous reflection of luminous insects, and their lungs were overwhelmed by a suffocating smell of blood. They could not return because the strip that they were opening as they went along would soon close up with a new vegetation that. almost seemed to grow before their eyes.</p><p>最初几天，他们没有遇到特殊的困难。他们顺着遍布石头的河岸下去，到了几年前发现古代铠甲的地方，并且沿着野橙子树之间的小径进入一片树林。到第一个周未，他们侥幸打死了一只牡鹿，拿它烤熟，可是决定只吃一半，把剩下的储备起来。他们采取这个预防措施，是想延缓以金刚鹦鹉充饥的时间；这种鹦鹉的肉是蓝色的，有强烈的麝香味儿。在随后的十几天中，他们根本没有见到阳光。脚下的土地变得潮湿、松软起来，好象火山灰似的，杂草越来越密，飞禽的啼鸣和猴子的尖叫越来越远--四周仿佛变得惨谈凄凉了。这个潮湿和寂寥的境地犹如“原罪”以前的蛮荒世界；在这儿，他们的鞋子陷进了油气腾腾的深坑，他们的大砍刀乱劈着血红色的百合花和金黄色的蝾螈，远古的回忆使他们受到压抑。整整一个星期，他们几乎没有说话，象梦游人一样在昏暗、悲凉的境地里行进，照明的只有萤火虫闪烁的微光，难闻的血腥气味使他们的肺部感到很不舒服。回头的路是没有的，因为他们开辟的小径一下了就不见了，几乎就在他们眼前长出了新的野草。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> "It's all right," José Arcadio Buendía would say. "The main thing is not to lose our bearings." Always following his compass, he kept on guiding his men toward the invisible north so that they would be able to get out of that enchanted region. It was a thick night, starless, but the darkness was becoming impregnated with a fresh and clear air. Exhausted by the long crossing, they hung up their hammocks and slept deeply for the first time in two weeks. When they woke up, with the sun already high in the sky, they were speechless with fascination. Before them, surrounded by ferns and palm trees, white and powdery in the silent morning light, was an enormous Spanish galleon. Tilted slightly to the starboard, it had hanging from its intact masts the dirty rags of its sails in the midst of its rigging, which was adorned with orchids. The hull, covered with an armor of petrified barnacles and soft moss, was firmly fastened into a surface stones. The whole structure seemed to occupy its own space, one of solitude and oblivion, protected from the vices of time and the habits of the birds. Inside, where the expeditionaries explored with careful intent, there was nothing but a thick forest of flowers.</p><p>“不要紧，”霍·阿·布恩蒂亚说。“主要是不迷失方向。”他不断地盯住罗盘的指针，继续领着大伙儿往看不见的北方前进，终于走出了魔区。他们周围是没有星光的黑夜，但是黑暗里充满了新鲜空气，经过长途跋涉，他们已经疲惫不堪，于是悬起吊床，两星期中第一次安静地睡了个大觉。醒来的时候，太阳已经升得很高，他们因此惊得发呆。在宁静的晨光里，就在他们前面，矗立着一艘西班牙大帆船，船体是白色、腐朽的，周围长满了羊齿植物和棕榈。帆船微微往右倾斜，在兰花装饰的索具之间，桅杆还很完整，垂着肮脏的船帆碎片，船身有一层石化贝壳和青苔形成的光滑的外壳，牢牢地陷入了坚实的土壤。看样子，整个船身处于孤寂的地方，被人忘却了，没有遭到时光的侵蚀，也没有受到飞禽的骚扰，探险队员们小心地察看了帆船内部，里面除了一大簇花卉，没有任何东西。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The discovery of the galleon, an indication of the proximity of the sea, broke José Arcadio Buendía's drive. He considered it a trick of his whimsical fate to have searched for the sea without finding it, at the cost of countless sacrifices and suffering, and to have found it all of a sudden without looking for it, as if it lay across his path like an insurmountable object. Many years later Colonel Aureliano Buendía crossed the region again, when it was already a regular mail route, and the only part of the ship he found was its burned-out frame in the midst of a field of poppies. Only then, convinced that the story had not been some product of his father's imagination, did he wonder how the galleon had been able to get inland to that spot. But José Arcadio Buendía did not concern himself with that when he found the sea after another four days' journey from the galleon. His dreams ended as he faced that ashen, foamy, dirty sea, which had not merited the risks and sacrifices of the adventure.</p><p>帆船的发现证明大海就在近旁，破坏了霍·阿·布恩蒂亚的战斗精神。他认为这是狡诈的命运在捉弄他：他千幸万苦寻找大海的时候，没有找到它；他不想找它的时候，现在却发现了它－－它象一个不可克服的障碍横在他的路上。多年以后，奥雷连诺上校也来到这个地区的时候（那时这儿已经开辟了驿道），他在帆船失事的地方只能看见一片罂粟花中间烧糊的船骨。那时他相信，这整个故事并不是他父亲虚构的，于是向自己提出个问题：帆船怎会深入陆地这么远呢？可是，再经过四天的路程，在离帆船十二公里的地方，霍·阿·布恩蒂亚看见大海的时候，并没有想到这类问题。在大海面前，他的一切幻想都破灭了；大海翻着泡沫，混浊不堪，灰茫茫一片，根本不值得他和伙伴们去冒险和牺牲。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"God damn it!" he shouted. "Macondo is surrounded by water on all sides."</p><p>“真他妈的！”霍·阿·布思蒂亚叫道。“马孔多四面八方都给海水围住啦！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The idea of a peninsular Macondo prevailed for a long time, inspired by the arbitrary map that José Arcadio Buendía sketched on his return from the expedition. He drew it in rage, evilly, exaggerating the difficulties communication, as if to punish himself for the absolute lack of sense with which he had chosen the place. "We'll never get anywhere," he lamented to úrsula. "We're going to rot our lives away here without receiving the benefits of science." That certainty, mulled over for several months in the small room he used as his laboratory, brought him to the conception of the plan to move Maeondo to a better place. But that time úrsula had anticipated his feverish designs. With the secret and implacable labor of a small ant she predisposed the women of the village against the flightiness of their husbands, who were already preparing for the move. José Arcadio Buendía did not know at what moment or because of what adverse forces his plan had become enveloped in a web of pretexts, disappointments, and evasions until it turned into nothing but an illusion. úrsula watched him with innocent attention and even felt some pity for him on the morning when she found him in the back room muttering about his plans for moving as he placed his laboratory pieces in their original boxes. She let him finish. She let him nail up the boxes and put his initials on them with an inked brush, without reproaching him, but knowing now that he knew (because she had heard him say so in his soft monologues) that the men of the village would not back him up in his undertaking. Only when he began to take down the door of the room did úrsula dare ask him what he was doing, and he answered with a certain bitterness. "Since no one wants to leave, we'll leave all by ourselves." úrsula did not become upset.</p><p>探险回来以后，霍·阿·布恩蒂亚绘了一幅地图：由于这张主观想出的地图，人们长时期里都以为马孔多是在一个半岛上面，他是恼怒地画出这张地图的，故意夸大跟外界往来的困难，仿佛想惩罚自己轻率地选择了这个建村的地点，“咱们再也去不了任何地方啦，”他向乌苏娜叫苦，“咱们会在这儿活活地烂掉，享受不到科学的好处了。”在自己的小试验室里，他把这种想法反刍似的咀嚼了几个月，决定把马孔多迁到更合适的地方去，可是妻子立即警告他，破坏了他那荒唐的计划。村里的男人已经开始准备搬家，乌苏娜却象蚂蚁一样悄悄地活动，一鼓作气唆使村中的妇女反对男人的轻举妄动。霍·阿·布恩蒂亚说不清楚，不知什么时候，由于什么对立的力量，他的计划遭到一大堆借口和托词的阻挠，终于变成没有结果的幻想。有一夭早晨乌苏娜发现，他一面低声叨咕搬家的计划，一面把白己的试验用具装进箱子，她只在旁边装傻地观察他，甚至有点儿怜悯他。她让他把事儿子完，在他钉上箱子，拿蘸了墨水的刷子在箱子上写好自己的缩写姓名时，她一句也没责备他，尽管她已明白（凭他含糊的咕噜），他知道村里的男人并不支持他的想法。只当霍·阿·布恩蒂亚开始卸下房门时，乌苏娜才大胆地向他要干什么，他有点难过地回答说：“既然谁也不想走，咱们就单独走吧。”乌苏娜没有发慌。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We will not leave," she said. "We will stay here, because we have had a son here."</p><p>“不，咱们不走，”他说。“咱们要留在这儿．因为咱们在这儿生了个儿子。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We have still not had a death," he said. "A person does not belong to a place until there is someone dead under the ground."</p><p>“可是，咱们还没有一个人死在这儿，”霍·阿·布恩蒂亚反驳说，“一个人如果没有亲属埋在这儿，他就不属于这个地方的人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>úrsula replied with a soft firmness:</p><p>乌苏娜温和而坚决他说：</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"If I have to die for the rest of you to stay here, I will die."</p><p>“为了咱们留在这儿，如果要我死，我就死。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>José Arcadio Buendía had not thought that his wife's will was so firm. He tried to seduce her with the charm of his fantasy, with the promise of a prodigious world where all one had to do was sprinkle some magic liquid on the ground and the plants would bear fruit whenever a man wished, and where all manner of instruments against pain were sold at bargain prices. But úrsula was insensible to his clairvoyance.</p><p>霍·阿·布恩蒂亚并不相信妻子那么坚定，他试图用自己的幻想迷住她，答应带她去看一个美妙的世界；那儿，只要在地里喷上神奇的药水，植物就会按照人的愿望长出果实；那儿，可以贱价买到各种治病的药物。可是他的幻想并没有打动她。</p></div>
"<div class='layout'><p>“Instead of going around thinking about your crazy inventions, you should be worrying about your sons? She replied. “Look at the state they’re in, running wild just like donkeys.""
   </p><p>“不要成天想入非非，最好关心关心孩子吧，”她回答。“你瞧，他们象小狗儿似的被扔在一边，没有人管。”</p></div>"
<div class='layout'><p>Jose Arcadio Buendía took his wife’s words literally. He looked out the window and saw the barefoot children in the sunny garden and he had the impression that only at that instant had they begun to exist, conceived by úrsula’s spell, Something occurred inside of him then, something mysterious and definitive that uprooted him from his own time and carried him adrift through an unexplored region of his memory. While ?rsula continued sweeping the house, which was safe now from being abandoned for the rest of her life, he stood there with an absorbed look, contemplating the children until his eyes became moist and he dried them with the back of his hand, exhaling a deep sigh of resignation.</p><p>霍·阿·布恩蒂亚一字一句体会妻子的话，他望了望窗外，看见两个赤足的孩子正在烈日炎炎的莱园里；他觉得，他们仅在这一瞬间才开始存在，仿佛是乌苏娜的咒语呼唤出来的。这时，一种神秘而重要的东西在他心中兀然出现，使他完全脱离了现实，浮游在住事的回忆里。当乌苏娜打扫屋子、决心一辈子也不离开这儿时，霍·阿·布恩蒂亚继续全神贯注地望着两个孩子，终于望得两眼湿润，他就用手背擦了擦眼睛，无可奈何地发出一声深沉的叹息。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"All right," he said. "Tell them to come help me take the things out of the boxes."</p><p>“好啦，”他说，“叫他们来帮我搬出箱子里的东西吧。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>José Arcadio, the older of the children, was fourteen. He had a square head, thick hair, and his father's character. Although he had the same impulse for growth and physical strength, it was early evident that he lacked imagination. He had been conceived and born during the difficult crossing of the mountains, before the founding of Macondo, and his parents gave thanks to heaven when they saw he had no animal features. Aureliano, the first human being to be born in Macondo, would be six years old in March. He was silent and withdrawn. He had wept in his mother's womb and had been born with his eyes open. As they were cutting the umbilical cord, he moved his head from side to side, taking in the things in the room examining the faces of the people with a fearless curiosity. Then, indifferent to those who came close to look at him, he kept his attention concentrated on the palm roof, which looked as if it were about to collapse under the tremendous pressure of the rain. úrsula did not remember the intensity of that look again until one day when little Aureliano, at the age of three, went into the kitchen at the moment she was taking a pot of boiling soup from the stove and putting it on the table. The child, Perplexed, said from the doorway, "It's going to spill." The pot was firmly placed in the center of the table, but just as soon as the child made his announcement, it began an unmistakable movement toward the edge, as if impelled by some inner dynamism, and it fell and broke on the floor. úrsula, alarmed, told her husband about the episode, but he interpreted it as a natural phenomenon. That was the way he always was alien to the existence of his sons, partly because he considered childhood as a period of mental insufficiency, and partly because he was always too absorbed in his fantastic speculations.</p><p>大儿子霍·阿卡蒂奥满了十四岁，长着方方的脑袋和蓬松的头发，性情象他父亲一样执拗。他虽有父亲那样的体力，可能长得象父亲一般魁伟，但他显然缺乏父亲那样的想象力。他是在马孔多建村之前翻山越岭的艰难途程中诞生的。父母确信孩子没有任何牲畜的特征，都感谢上帝。奥雷连诺是在马孔多出生的第一个人，三月间该满六岁了。这孩子性情孤僻、沉默寡言。他在母亲肚子里就哭哭啼啼，是睁着眼睛出世的。人家给他割掉脐带的时候，他把脑袋扭来扭去，仿佛探察屋里的东西，并且好奇地瞅着周围的人，一点儿也不害怕。随后，对于走到跟前来瞧他的人，他就不感兴趣了，而把自己的注意力集中在棕搁叶铺盖的房顶上；在倾盆大雨下，房顶每分钟都有塌下的危险。乌苏娜记得后来还看见过孩子的这种紧张的神情。有一天，三岁的小孩儿奥雷连诺走进厨房，她正巧把一锅煮沸的汤从炉灶拿到桌上。孩子犹豫不决地站在门槛边，惊惶地说：“马上就要摔下啦。”汤锅是稳稳地放在桌子中央的，可是孩子刚说出这句话，它仿佛受到内力推动似的，开始制止不住地移到桌边，然后掉到地上摔得粉碎。不安的乌苏娜把这桩事情告诉丈夫，可他把这种事情说成是自然现象。经常都是这样：霍·阿·布恩蒂亚不关心孩子的生活，一方面是因为他认为童年是智力不成熟的时期，另一方面是因为他一头扎进了荒唐的研究。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But since the afternoon when he called the children in to help him unpack the things in the laboratory, he gave them his best hours. In the small separate room, where the walls were gradually being covered by strange maps and fabulous drawings, he taught them to read and write and do sums, and he spoke to them about the wonders of the world, not only where his learning had extended, but forcing the limits of his imagination to extremes. It was in that way that the boys ended up learning that in the southern extremes of Africa there were men so intelligent and peaceful that their only pastime was to sit and think, and that it was possible to cross the Aegean Sea on foot by jumping from island to island all the way to the port of Salonika. Those hallucinating sessions remained printed on the memories of the boys in such a way that many years later, a second before the regular army officer gave the firing squad the command to fire, Colonel Aureliano Buendía saw once more that warm March afternoon on which his father had interrupted the lesson in physics and stood fascinated, with his hand in the air and his eyes motionless, listening to the distant pipes, drums, and jingles of the gypsies, who were coming to the village once more, announcing the latest and most startling discovery of the sages of Memphis.</p><p>但是，从他招呼孩子们帮他取出箱子里的试验仪器的那天下午起，他就把他最好的时间用在他们身上了。在僻静的小室墙壁上，难以置信的地图和稀奇古怪的图表越来越多；在这间小宝里，他教孩子们读书、写字和计算：同时，不仅依靠自己掌握的知识，而已广泛利用自己无限的想象力，向孩子们介绍世界上的奇迹。孩子们由此知道，非洲南端有一种聪明、温和的人，他们的消遣就是坐着静思，而爱琴海是可以步行过去的，从一个岛屿跳上另一个岛屿，一直可以到达萨洛尼卡港。这些荒诞不经的夜谈深深地印在孩子们的脑海里，多年以后，政府军的军官命令行刑队开枪之前的片刻间，奥雷连诺上校重新忆起了那个暖和的三月的下午，当时他的父亲听到远处吉卜赛人的笛鼓声，就中断了物理课，两眼一动不动，举着手愣住了；这些吉卜赛人再一次来到村里，将向村民介绍孟菲斯学者们惊人的最新发明。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They were new gypsies, young men and women who knew only their own language, handsome specimens with oily skins and intelligent hands, whose dances and music sowed a panic of uproarious joy through the streets, with parrots painted all colors reciting Italian arias, and a hen who laid a hundred golden eggs to the sound of a tambourine, and a trained monkey who read minds, and the multi-use machine that could be used at the same time to sew on buttons reduce fevers, the apparatus to make a person forget his bad memories, and a poultice to lose time, and a thousand more inventions so ingenious and unusual that José Arcadio Buendía must have wanted to invent a memory machine so that he could remember them all. In an instant they transformed the village. The inhabitants of Macondo found themselves lost is their own streets, confused by the crowded fair.</p><p>这是另一批吉卜赛人。男男女女部都挺年青，只说本族话，是一群皮肤油亮、双手灵巧的漂亮人物。他们载歌载舞，兴高采烈，闹嚷嚷地经过街头，带来了各样东西：会唱意大利抒情歌曲的彩色鹦鹅；随着鼓声一次至少能下一百只金蛋的母鸡；能够猜出人意的猴子；既能缝钮扣、又能退烧的多用机器；能够使人忘却辛酸往事的器械，能够帮助消磨时间的膏药，此外还有其他许多巧妙非凡的发明，以致霍·阿·布恩蒂亚打算发明一种记忆机器，好把这一切全都记住。瞬息间，村子里的面貌就完全改观,人群熙攘，闹闹喧喧，马孔多的居民在自己的街道上也迷失了方向。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Holding a child by each hand so as not to lose them in the tumult, bumping into acrobats with gold-capped teeth and jugglers with six arms, suffocated by the mingled breath of manure and sandals that the crowd exhaled, José Arcadio Buendía went about everywhere like a madman, looking for Melquíades so that he could reveal to him the infinite secrets of that fabulous nightmare. He asked several gypsies, who did not understand his language. Finally he reached the place where Melquíades used to set up his tent and he found a taciturn Armenian who in Spanish was hawking a syrup to make oneself invisible. He had drunk down a glass of the amber substance in one gulp as José Arcadio Buendía elbowed his way through the absorbed group that was witnessing the spectacle, and was able to ask his question. The gypsy wrapped him in the frightful climate of his look before he turned into a puddle of pestilential and smoking pitch over which the echo of his reply still floated: "Melquíades is dead." Upset by the news, José Arcadio Buendía stood motionless, trying to rise above his affliction, until the group dispersed, called away by other artifices, and the puddle of the taciturn Armenian evaporated completely. Other gypsies confirmed later on that Melquíades had in fact succumbed to the fever on the beach at Singapore and that his body had been thrown into the deepest part of the Java Sea. </p><p>霍·何·布恩蒂亚象疯子一样东窜西窜，到处寻找梅尔加德斯，希望从他那儿了解这种神奇梦景的许多秘密。他手里牵着两个孩了，生怕他们在拥挤的人群中丢失，不时碰见镶着金牙的江湖艺人或者六条胳膊的魔术师。人群中发出屎尿和檀香混合的味儿，叫他喘不上气。他向吉卜赛人打听梅尔加德斯，可是他们不懂他的语言。最后，他到了梅尔加德斯往常搭帐篷的地方。此刻，那儿坐着一个脸色阴郁的亚美尼亚吉卜赛人，正在用西班牙语叫卖一种隐身糖浆，当这吉卜赛人刚刚一下子喝完一杯琥珀色的无名饮料时，霍·阿·布恩蒂亚挤过一群看得出神的观众，向吉卜赛人提出了自己的问题。吉卜赛人用奇异的眼光瞅了瞅他，立刻变成一滩恶臭的、冒烟的沥青，他的答话还在沥青上发出回声：“梅尔加德斯死啦。”霍·阿·布恩蒂亚听到这个消息，不胜惊愕，呆若木鸡，试图控制自己的悲伤，直到观众被其他的把戏吸引过去，亚美尼亚吉卜赛人变成的一滩沥青挥发殆尽。然后，另一个吉卜赛人证实，梅尔加德斯在新加坡海滩上患疟疾死了，尸体抛入了爪哇附近的大海。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The children had no interest in the news. They insisted that their father take them to see the overwhelming novelty of the sages of Memphis that was being advertised at the entrance of a tent that, according to what was said, had belonged to King Solomon. They insisted so much that José Arcadio Buendía paid the thirty reales and led them into the center of the tent, where there was a giant with a hairy torso and a shaved head, with a copper ring in his nose and a heavy iron chain on his ankle, watching over a pirate chest. When it was opened by the giant, the chest gave off a glacial exhalation. Inside there was only an enormous, transparent block with infinite internal needles in which the light of the sunset was broken up into colored stars. </p><p>孩子们对这个消息并无兴趣，就拉着父亲去看写在一个帐这招牌上的孟菲斯学者的新发明，如果相信它所写的，这个脓篷从前属于所罗门王。孩子们纠缠不休，霍· 阿·布恩蒂亚只得付了三十里亚尔，带着他们走进帐篷，那儿有个剃光了脑袋的巨人，浑身是毛，鼻孔里穿了个铜环，脚跺上拴了条沉重的铁链，守着一只海盗用的箱子，巨人揭开盖子，箱子里就冒出一股刺骨的寒气。箱子坠只有一大块透明的东西，这玩意儿中间有无数白色的细针，傍晚的霞光照到这些细针，细针上面就现出了许多五颜六色的星星。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Disconcerted, knowing that the children were waiting for an immediate explanation, José Arcadio Buendía ventured a murmur:</p><p>霍·阿·布恩蒂亚感到大惑不解，但他知道孩子们等着他立即解释，便大胆地嘟嚷说：</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“It’s the largest diamond in the world.</p><p>“这是世界上最大的钻石。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No," the gypsy countered. "It's ice."</p><p>“不，”吉卜赛巨人纠正他。“这是冰块。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>José Arcadio Buendía, without understanding, stretched out his hand toward the cake, but the giant moved it away. "Five reales more to touch it," he said. José Arcadio Buendía paid them and put his hand on the ice and held it there for several minutes as his heart filled with fear and jubilation at the contact with mystery. Without knowing what to say, he paid ten reales more so that his sons could have that prodigious experience. Little José Arcadio refused to touch it. Aureliano, on the other hand, took a step forward and put his hand on it, withdrawing it immediately. "It's boiling," he exclaimed, startled. But his father paid no attention to him. Intoxicated by the evidence of the miracle, he forgot at that moment about the frustration of his delirious undertakings Melquíades' body, abandoned to the appetite of the squids. He paid another five reales and with his hand on the cake, as if giving testimony on the holy scriptures, he exclaimed:</p><p>莫名其妙的霍·阿·布恩蒂亚向这块东西伸过手去，可是巨人推开了他的手。“再交五个里亚尔才能摸。”巨人说。霍·阿·布恩蒂亚付了五个里亚尔，把手掌放在冰块上呆了几分钟；接触这个神秘的东西，他的心里充满了恐惧和喜悦，他不知道如何向孩子们解释这种不太寻常的感觉，又付了十个里亚尔，想让他们自个儿试一试，大儿子霍·阿卡蒂奥拒绝去摸。相反地，奥雷连诺却大胆地弯下腰去，将手放在冰上，可是立即缩回手来。“这东西热得烫手！”他吓得叫了一声。父亲没去理会他。这时，他对这个显然的奇迹欣喜若狂，竞忘了自己那些幻想的失败，也忘了葬身鱼腹的梅尔加德斯。霍·阿·布恩蒂亚又付了五个里亚尔，就象出庭作证的人把手放在《圣经》上一样，庄严地将手放在冰块上，说道：</p></div>
