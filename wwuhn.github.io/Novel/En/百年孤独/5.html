<div class='layout'><p>AURELIANO BUENDíA and Remedios Moscote were married one Sunday in March before the altar Father Nicanor Reyna had set up in the parlor. It was the culmination of four weeks of shocks in the Moscote household because little Remedios had reached puberty before getting over the habits of childhood. In spite of the fact that her mother had taught her about the changes adolescence, one February afternoon she burst shouting into the living room, where her sisters were chatting with Aureliano, and showed them her panties, smeared with a chocolate-colored paste. A month for the wedding was agreed upon. There was barely enough time to teach how to wash herself, get dressed by herself, and understand the fundamental business of a home. They made her urinate over hot bricks in order to cure her of the habit of wetting her bed. It took a good deal of work to convince her of the inviolability of the marital secret, for Remedios was so confused and at the same time so amazed at the revelation that she wanted to talk to everybody about the details of the wedding night. It was a fatiguing effort, but on the date set for the ceremony the child was as adept in the ways of the world as any of her sisters. </p><p>根据尼康诺·莱茵纳神父的指示，客厅里搭了个圣坛；三月里的一个星期天，奥雷连诺和雷麦黛丝·摩斯柯特在圣坛前面举行了婚礼。在摩斯柯特家中，这一天是整整一个月不安的结束，因为小雷麦黛丝到了成熟时期，却还没有抛弃儿童的习惯。母亲及时把青春期的变化告诉了她，但在二月间的一个下午，几个姐姐正在客厅里跟奥雷连诺谈话，雷麦黛丝却尖声怪叫地冲进客厅，让大家瞧她的裤子，这裤子已给粘搭搭的褐色东西弄脏了。婚礼定于一月之后举行。教她学会自己洗脸、穿衣、做些最简单的家务，是费了不少时间的。为了治好她尿床的毛病，家里的人就要她在热砖上撒尿。而且，让她保守合欢床上的秘密，也花了不少工夫，因为她一知道初夜的细节，就那么惊异，同时又那么兴奋，甚至想把自己知道的这些细节告诉每一个人。在她身上是伤了不少脑筋的。但是，到了举行婚礼的一天，这姑娘对日常生活的了解就不亚于她的任何一个姐姐了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Don Apolinar Moscote escorted by the arm down the street that was decorated with flowers and wreaths amidst the explosion of rockets and the music of several bands, and she waved with her hand and gave her thanks with a smile to those who wished her good luck from the windows. Aureliano, dressed in black, wearing the same patent leather boots with metal fasteners that he would have on a few years later as he faced the firing squad, had an intense paleness and a hard lump in his throat when he met the bride at the door of the house and led her to the altar. She behaved as naturally, such discretion, that she did not lose her composure, not even when Aureliano dropped the ring as he tried to put it on her finger. In the midst of the. murmurs and confusion of the guests, she kept her arm with the fingerless lace glove held up and remained like that with her ring finger ready until the bridegroom managed to stop the ring with his foot before it rolled to the door, and came back blushing to the altar. Her mother and sisters suffered so much from the fear that the child would do something wrong during the ceremony that in the end they were the ones who committed the impertinence of picking her up to kiss her. </p><p>在噼哩啪啦的花炮声中，在几个乐队的歌曲声中，阿·摩斯柯特先生牵着女儿，走过彩花烂漫的街头，左邻右舍的人从自家的窗口向雷麦黛丝祝贺，她就挥手含笑地表示感谢。奥雷连诺身穿黑呢服装，脚踩金属扣子的漆皮鞋（几年以后，他站在行刑队面前的时候，穿的也是这双皮鞋），在房门前面迎接新娘，把她领到圣坛前去--他紧张得脸色苍白，喉咙发哽。雷麦黛丝举止自然，大大方方；奥雷连诺给她戴戒指时，即使不慎把它掉到地上，她仍镇定自若。宾客们却惊惶失措，周围响起了一片窃窃私语，可是雷麦黛丝把戴着花边手套的手微微举起，伸出无名指，继续泰然自若地等着，直到未婚夫用脚踩住戒指，阻止它滚向房门，然后满脸通红地回到圣坛跟前。雷麦黛丝的母亲和姐姐们生怕她在婚礼上违反规矩，终于很不恰当地暗示她首先去吻未婚夫。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>From that day on the sense of responsibility, the natural grace, the calm control that Remedios would have in the face of adverse circumstances was revealed. It was she who, on her own initiative, put aside the largest piece that she had cut from the wedding cake and took it on a plate with a fork to José Arcadio Buendía. Tied to the trunk of the chestnut tree, huddled on a wooden stool underneath the palm shelter, the enormous old man, discolored by the sun and rain, made a vague smile of gratitude and at the piece cake with his fingers, mumbling an unintelligible psalm. </p><p>正是从这一天起，在不利的情况下，雷麦黛丝都表现了责任心、天生的温厚态度和自制能力。她自动分出一大块结婚蛋糕，连同叉子一起放在盘子里，拿给霍·阿·布恩蒂亚。这个身躯魁梧的老人，蜷缩在棕榈棚下，捆在栗树上，由于日晒雨淋，已经变得十分萎靡，但却感激地微微一笑，双手抓起蛋糕就吃，鼻子里还哼着什么莫名其妙的圣歌。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The only unhappy person in that noisy celebration, which lasted until dawn on Monday, was Rebeca Buendía. It was her own frustrated party. By an arrangement of úrsula's, her marriage was to be celebrated on the same day, but that Friday Pietro Crespi received a letter with the news of his mother's imminent death. The wedding was postponed. Pietro Crespi left for the capital of the province an hour after receiving the letter, and on the road he missed his mother, who arrived punctually Saturday night and at Aureliano's wedding sang the sad aria that she had prepared for the wedding of her son. Pietro Crespi returned on Sunday midnight to sweep up the ashes of the party, after having worn out five horses on the road in an attempt to be in time for his wedding. It was never discovered who wrote the letter. Tormented by úrsula, Amaranta wept with indignation and swore her innocence in front of the altar, which the carpenters had not finished dismantling.</p><p>热闹的婚礼一直延续到星期一早晨，婚礼上唯一不幸的人是雷贝卡。她的婚事遭到了破坏。照乌苏娜的安排，雷贝卡是应当在这同一天结婚的，可是皮埃特罗·克列斯比星期五收到一封信，信中说他母亲病危。婚礼也就推延了。收信之后过了一小时，皮埃特罗·克列斯比就回省城去了。她的母亲却在星期六晚上按时到达，路上没有跟他相遇；她甚至在奥雷连诺的婚礼上唱了一支歌儿，这支歌儿本来是她为儿子的婚礼准备的。皮埃特罗·克列斯比打算回来赶上自己的婚礼，路上把五匹马部累得精疲力尽，可是星期天半夜到达时，别人的婚礼就要结束了。那封倒霉的信究竟是谁写的，始终没弄清楚。阿玛兰塔受到乌苏娜的盘问，气得痛哭流涕，在木匠还没拆除的圣坛前面发誓说她没有过错。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>FatNicanor Reyna-whom Don Apolinar Moscote had brought from the swamp to officiate at the wedding--was an old man hardened by the ingratitude of his ministry. His skin was sad, with the bones almost exposed, and he had a pronounced round stomach and the expression of an old angel, which came more from, simplicity than from goodness. He had planned to return to his pariah after the wedding, but he was appalled at the hardness of the inhabitants of Macondo, who were prospering in the midst of scandal, subject to the natural law, without baptizing their children or sanctifying their festivals. Thinking that no land needed the seed of God so much, he decided to stay on for another week to Christianize both circumcised and gentile, legalize concubinage, and give the sacraments to the dying. But no one paid any attention to him. They would answer him that they had been many years without a priest, arranging the business of their souls directly with God, and that they had lost the evil of original sin. Tired of preaching in the open, </p><p>为了举行婚礼，阿·摩斯柯特先生从邻近的城市请来了尼康诺·莱茵纳神父；由于自己的职业得不到奉承，这老头儿总是阴阴沉沉。他的皮肤是浅灰色的，几乎皮包骨，圆鼓鼓的肚子很突出，他那老朽的面孔所显露的与其说是善良，不如说是憨厚。他准备婚礼之后就返回自己的教区，但他见到马孔多居民一切无所顾忌的样子就感到惊愕，因为他们虽然安居乐业，却生活在罪孽之中：他们仅仅服从自然规律，不给孩子们举行洗礼，不承认宗教节日。神父认为这块土地急切需要上帝的种子，就决定在马孔多再留一个星期，以便给行过割礼的人和异教徒举行一次洗礼，让非法的同居合法化，并且给垂死的人一顿圣餐。可是谁也不愿听他的。大家回答他说，他们多年没有教士也过得挺好，可以直接找上帝解决拯救灵魂的问题，而且不会犯不可宽恕之罪。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Father Nicanor decided to undertake the building of a church, the largest in the world, with life-size saints and stained-glass windows on the sides, so that people would come from Rome to honor God in the center of impiety. He went everywhere begging alms with a copper dish. They gave him a large amount, but he wanted more, because the church had to have a bell that would raise the drowned up to the surface of the water. He pleaded so much that he lost his voice. His bones began to fill with sounds. </p><p>尼康诺神父讨厌在旷地上继续布道，决定竭尽全力建筑一座世界上最大的教堂，有圣徒的等身雕像和彩绘玻璃窗，以便罗马来的人也能在无神论者的中心地区向上帝祈祷。他拿着一个铜盘，四处募捐。人行慷慨布施，可是未能满足他的要求，因为教堂要有一个大钟，此种钟声能使淹死的人浮到水面。他向大家苦苦哀求，甚至嗓子都哑了，疲乏得骨头都酸痛了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>One Saturday, not even having collected the price of the doors, he fell into a desperate confusion. He improvised an altar in the square and on Sunday he went through the town with a small bell, as in the days of insomnia, calling people to an openair mass. Many went out of curiosity. Others from nostalgia. Others so that God would not take the disdain for His intermediary as a personal insult. So that at eight in the morning half the town was in the square, where Father Nicanor chanted the gospels in a voice that had been lacerated by his pleading. At the end, when the congregation began to break up, he raised his arms signaling for attention.</p><p>一个星期六，他估量捐款甚至不够做教堂的门，就陷入了绝望状态。星期天，他在市镇广场上搭了个圣坛，象失眠症流行时那样，拿着一个小铃铛，跑遍了所有的街道，招呼人们去参加旷地弥撒。许多人是出于好奇而来的，另一些人是由于无事可干，还有一些人唯恐上帝把他们藐视神父看做是冒犯他自己。就这样，早上八点钟，全镇一半的人都聚在广场上，尼康诺神父朗诵了福音书，声嘶力竭地恳求大家捐助。弥撒结束时，在场的人己经开始四散，他就举起手来要大家注意。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Just a moment," he said. "Now we shall witness an undeniable proof of the infinite power of God."</p><p>“等一下，”他说。“你们马上可以得到上帝威力无穷的确凿证明。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The boy who had helped him with the mass brought him a cup of thick and steaming chocolate, which he drank without pausing to breathe. Then he wiped his lips with a handkerchief that he drew from his sleeve, extended his arms, and closed his eyes. Thereupon Father Nicanor rose six inches above the level of the ground. It was a convincing measure. He went among the houses for several days repeating the demonstration of levitation by means of chocolate while the acolyte collected so much money in a bag that in less than a month he began the construction of the church. No one doubted the divine origin of the demonstration except José Arcadio Buendía, who without changing expression watched the troop of people who gathered around the chestnut tree one morning to witness the revelation once more. He merely stretched on his stool a little and shrugged his shoulders when Father Nicanor began to rise up from the ground along with the chair he was sitting on.</p><p>协助尼康诺神父做弥撒的一个孩子，端来一杯浓稠、冒气的巧克力茶。神父一下子就把整杯饮料喝光了。然后，他从长袍袖子里掏出一块手帕，擦干了嘴唇，往前伸出双手，闭上了眼睛。接着，尼康诺神父就在地上升高了六英寸。证据是十分令人信服的。在几天中，神父都在镇上来来去去，利用热腾腾的巧克力茶一再重复升空的把戏，小帮手把那么多的钱收到袋子里，不过一个月工夫，教堂的建筑就已动工了。谁都不怀疑尼康诺神父表演的奇迹是上帝在发挥威力。只有霍·阿·布恩蒂亚不以为然。有一天早上，一群人聚在离栗树不远的地方，参观另一次升空表演，他一个人仍然完全无动于衷，看见尼康诺神父连同坐椅一起升到地面上头以后，他只在自己的凳子上微微挺直身子，耸了耸肩。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Hoc est simplicissimus," José Arcadio Buendía said. "Homo iste statum quartum materiae invenit."</p><p>“这很简单。这个人发现了物质的第四种状态。”霍·阿·布恩蒂亚说。（注：拉丁语）</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Father Nicanor raised his hands and the four legs of the chair all landed on the ground at the same time. "Nego," he said. "Factum hoc existentiam Dei probat sine dubio."</p><p>尼康诺神父一举手，椅子的四条小腿同时着地。“我否认，”神父反驳说。“这个事实无可辩驳地证明上帝的存在。”（注：拉丁语）</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Thus it was discovered that Jose Arcadio Buendía’s devilish jargon was Latin. Father Nicanor took advantage of the circumstance of his being the only person who had been able to communicate with him to try to inject the faith into his twisted mind. Every afternoon he would sit by the chestnut tree preaching in Latin, but Jos?Arcadio Buendía insisted on rejecting rhetorical tricks and the transmutation of chocolate, and he demanded the daguerreotype of God as the only proof. Father Nicanor then brought him medals and pictures and even a reproduction of the Veronica, but Jose Arcadio Buendía rejected them as artistic objects without any scientific basis. He was so stubborn that Father Nicanor gave up his attempts at evangelization and continued visiting him out of humanitarian feelings. But then it was Jose Arcadio Buendía who took the lead and tried to break down the priest’s faith with rationalist tricks. On a certain occasion when Father Nicanor brought a checker set to the chestnut tree and invited him to a game, Jos?Arcadio Buendía would not accept, because according to him he could never understand the sense of a contest in which the two adversaries have agreed upon the rules. Father Nicanor, who had never seen checkers played that way, could not play it again. Ever more startled at Jos?Arcadio Buendía’s lucidity, he asked him how it was possible that they had him tied to a tree.</p><p>大家这才知道，霍·阿·布恩蒂亚的鬼活其实是拉丁语。尼康诺神父终于发现了一个能够跟他交谈的人，决定利用这种幸运的情况，向这个精神病人灌输宗教信仰。每天下午他都坐在栗树旁边，用拉丁语传道，可是霍·阿·布恩蒂亚拒不接受他的花言巧语，也不相信他的升空表演，只要求拿上帝的照片当作无可辩驳的唯一证明。于是，尼康诺神父给他拿来了一些圣像和版画，甚至一块印有耶稣像的手帕，然而霍·阿·布恩蒂亚加以拒绝，认为它们都是没有任何科学根据的手工艺品。他是那么顽固，尼康诺神父也就放弃了向他传道的打算，只是出于人道主义感情继续来看望他。这样，霍·阿·布恩蒂亚取得了主动权，试图用理性主义的诡谲道理动摇神父的信仰。有一次，尼康诺神父带来一盒跳棋和棋盘，要霍·阿·布恩蒂亚跟他下棋，霍·阿·布恩蒂亚拒绝了，因为据他解释，敌对双方既然在重要问题上彼此一致，他看不出他们之间的争斗有什么意义。尼康诺神父对于下棋从来没有这种观点，但又无法把他说服。他对霍·阿·布恩蒂亚的智慧越来越惊异，就问他怎么会捆在树上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Hoc est simplicissimus," he replied. "Because I'm Crazy."</p><p>他回答，“因为我是个疯子。”（注：拉丁语）</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>From then on, concerned about his own faith, the priest did not come back to visit him and dedicated himself to hurrying along the building of the church. Rebeca felt her hopes being reborn. Her future was predicated on the completion of the work, for one Sunday when Father Nicanor was lunching at the house and the whole family sitting at the table spoke of the solemnity and splendor that religious ceremonies would acquire when the church was built, Amaranta said: "The luckiest one will be Rebeca." And since Rebeca did not understand what she meant, she explained it to her with an innocent smile:</p><p>这次谈话之后，神父担心自己的信仰遭到动摇，就不再来看望他了，全神贯注在教堂的建筑上。雷贝卡感到自己又有了希望。她的未来是跟教堂的竣工有关系的，因为有一个星期天，尼康诺神父在她们家中吃午饭的时候，曾在全家的人面前说，教堂建成以后，就能隆重而堂皇地举行宗教仪式了。“最幸运的是雷贝卡，”阿玛兰塔说。因为雷贝卡不明白她的意思，她就天真地微笑着说：</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You're going to be the one who will inaugurate the church with your wedding."</p><p>“因为你可以拿自己的婚礼为教堂揭幕啦。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Rebeca tried to forestall any comments. The way the construction was going the church would not be built before another ten years. Father Nicanor did not agree: the growing generosity of the faithful permitted to make more optimistic calculations. To the mute Indignation of Rebeca, who could not finish her lunch, úrsula celebrated Amaranta's idea contributed a considerable sum for the work to move faster. Father Nicanor felt that with another contribution like that the church would be ready within three years. From then on Rebeca did not say another word to Amaranta, convinced that her initiative had not the innocence that she attempted to give it. "That was the least serious thing I could have done," Amaranta answered her during the violent argument they had that night. "In that way I won't have to kill you for three years." Rebeca accepted the challenge.</p><p>雷贝卡试图阻止这样的议论。她认为建筑进度很慢，教堂最快十年才能竣工。尼康诺神父不同意她的看法：因为信徒们越慷慨，他就越能作出乐观的估计。雷贝卡心中不快，饭也没有吃完，而乌苏娜却赞成阿玛兰塔的想法，答应捐助一大笔款子。加快工程进度。尼康诺神父声称：再有这样一笔捐款，教堂三年就能落成。从那一天起，雷贝卡就不跟阿玛兰塔说一句话了，因为她确信，妹妹心里想的并不象嘴里说的那么单纯。“算啦，我没干更坏的事，”那天晚上她俩之间发生激烈争论时，阿玛兰塔说。“起码最近三年我不必杀死你。”雷贝卡接受了挑战。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When Pietro Crespi found out about the new postponement, he went through a crisis of disappointment, but Rebeca gave a final proof of her loyalty. "We'll elope whenever you say," she told him. Pietro Crespi, however, was not a man of adventure. He lacked the impulsive character of his fiancée and he considered respect for one's given word as a wealth that should not be squandered. Then Rebeca turned to more audacious methods. A mysterious wind blew out the lamps in the parlor and úrsula surprised the lovers kissing in the dark. Pietro Crespi gave some confused explanations about the poor quality of modern pitch lamps and he even helped her install a more secure system of illumination for the room. But the fuel failed again or the wicks became clogged and úrsula found Rebeca sitting on her fiancé's lap. This time she would accept no explanation. She turned the responsibility of the bakery over to the Indian woman and sat in a rocking chair to watch over the young people during the visits, ready to win out over maneuvers that had already been old when she was a girl. "Poor Mama," Rebeca would say with mock indignation, seeing úrsula yawn during the boredom of the visits. "When she dies she'll go off to her reward in that rocking chair." </p><p>知道又延期了，皮埃特罗·克列斯比陷入了绝望，但是未婚妻最后向他证明了自己的坚贞。“你啥时候愿意，咱们可以离开这儿，”她说。然而皮埃特罗·克列斯比并不是冒险家。他没有未婚妻那种冲动的性格，但是认为妻子的话应当重视。接着，雷贝卡采取了更加放肆的办法。不知哪儿刮来的风吹灭了客厅里的灯，乌苏娜惊异地发现未婚夫妇在黑暗中接吻。皮埃特罗·克列斯比慌乱地向她抱怨新的煤油灯质量太差，甚至答应帮助在客厅里安装更加可靠的照明设备。可是现在，这灯不是煤油完了，就是灯芯卡住了，于是乌苏娜又发现雷贝卡在未婚夫膝上。最后，乌苏娜再也不听任何解释。每逢这个未婚夫来访的时候，乌苏娜都把面包房交给印第安女人照顾，自己坐在摇椅里，观察未婚夫妇的动静，打算探出她年轻时就已司空见惯的花招。“可怜的妈妈，”看见乌苏娜在未婚夫来访时打呵欠，生气的雷贝卡就嘲笑他说。“她准会死在这把摇椅里，得到报应。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>After three months of supervised love, fatigued by the slow progress of the construction, which he went to inspect every day, Pietro Crespi decided to give Father Nicanor the money he needed to finish the church. Amaranta did not grow impatient. As she conversed with her girl friends every afternoon when they came to embroider on the porch, she tried to think of new subterfuges. A mistake in calculation spoiled the one she considered the most effective: removing the mothballs that Rebeca had put in her wedding dress before she put it away in the bedroom dresser. She did it when two months were left for the completion the church. But Rebeca was so impatient the approach of the wedding that she wanted to get the dress ready earlier than Amaranta had foreseen. When she opened the dresser and unfolded first the papers and then the protective cloth, she found the fabric of the dress and the stitches of the veil and even the crown of orange blossoms perforated by moths. Although she was sure that she had put a handful of mothballs in the wrappings, the disaster seemed so natural that she did not dare blame Amaranta. There was less than a month until the wedding, but Amparo Moscote promised to sew a new dress within a week. Amaranta felt faint that rainy noontime when Amparo came to the house wrapped in the froth of needlework for Rebeca to have the final fitting of the dress. She lost her voice and a thread cold sweat ran down the path of her spine. For long months she had trembled with fright waiting for that hour, because if she had not been able to conceive the ultimate obstacle to Rebeca's wedding, she was sure that at the last moment, when all the resources of her imagination had failed, she would have the courage to poison her. That afternoon, while Rebeca was suffocating with heat inside the armor of thread that Amparo Moscote was putting about her body with thousands of pins and infinite patience, Amaranta made several mistakes in her crocheting and pricked her finger with the needle, but she decided with frightful coldness that the date would be the last Friday before the wedding and the method would be a dose of laudanum in her coffee.</p><p>过了三个月受到监视的爱情生活，皮埃特罗·克列斯比每天都检查工程状况，对教堂建筑的缓慢感到苦恼，决定捐给尼康诺神父短缺的钱，使他能把事情进行到底。这个消息丝毫没使阿玛兰塔着急。每天下午，女友们聚在长廊上绣花的时候，她一面跟她们聊天，一面琢磨新的诡计。可是她的估计错了，她认为最有效的一个阴谋也就失败了；这个阴谋就是掏出卧室五斗橱里的樟脑球，因为雷贝卡是把结婚的衣服保藏在橱里的。阿玛兰塔是在教堂竣工之前两个月干这件事的。然而婚礼迫近，雷贝卡就急于想准备好自己的服装，时间比阿玛兰塔预料的早得多。雷贝卡拉开衣橱的抽屉，首先揭开几张纸，然后揭起护布，发现缎子衣服、花边头纱、甚至香橙花花冠，都给虫子蛀坏了，变成了粉末。尽管她清楚地记得，她在衣服包卷下面撒了一把樟脑球，但是灾难显得那么偶然，她就不敢责怪阿玛兰塔了。距离婚礼不到一个月，安芭萝·摩斯柯特却答应一星期之内就把新衣服缝好。一个雨天的中午，镇长的女儿抱着一堆泡沫似的绣装走进屋来，让雷贝卡最后试穿的时候，阿玛兰塔差点儿昏厥过去。她说不出话，一股冷汗沿着脊椎往下流。几个月来，阿玛兰塔最怕这个时刻的来临，因她坚信：如果她想不出什么办法来最终阻挠这场婚礼，那么到了一切幻想都已破灭的最后时刻，她就不得不鼓起勇气毒死雷贝卡了。安芭萝·摩斯柯特非常耐心地千针万线缝成的缎子衣服，雷贝卡穿在身上热得直喘气，阿玛兰塔却把毛线衣的针数数错了几次，并且拿织针扎破了自己的手指，但她异常冷静地作出决定：日期--婚礼之前的最后一个星期五，办法--在一杯咖啡里放进一些鸦片酊。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>A greater obstacle, as impassable as it was unforeseen, obliged a new and indefinite postponement. One week before the date set for the wedding, little Remedios woke up in the middle of the night soaked in a hot broth which had exploded in her insides with a kind of tearing belch, and she died three days later, poisoned by her own blood, a pair of twins crossed in stomach. Amarante suffered a crisis conscience. She had begged God with such fervor for something fearful to happen so that she would not have to poison Rebeca that she felt guilty of Remedios' death. That was not the obstacle that she had begged for so much. Remedios had brought a breath of merriment to the house. She had settled down with her husband in a room near the workshop, which she decorated with the dolls and toys of her recent childhood, merry vitality overflowed the four walls of the bedroom and went like a whirlwind of good health along the porch with the begonias: She would start singing at dawn. She was the only person who dared intervene in the arguments between Rebeca and Amaranta. She plunged into the fatiguing chore of taking care of José Arcadio Buendía. She would bring him his food, she would help him with his daily necessities, wash him with soap and a scrubbing brush, keep his hair and beard free of lice and nits, keep the palm shelter in good condition and reinforce it with waterproof canvas in stormy weather. In her last months she had succeeded in communicating with him in phrases of rudimentary Latin. </p><p>然而，新的障碍是那么不可预料、难以克服，婚礼又无限期地推迟了。在雷贝卡和皮埃特罗·克列斯比的婚期之前七天，年轻的雷麦黛丝半夜醒来，浑身被内脏里排出的屎尿湿透，还发出一种打嗝似的声音，三天以后就血中毒死了，--有一对双胞胎横梗在她肚子里。阿玛兰塔受到良心的谴责。她曾热烈祈求上帝降下什么灾难，免得她向雷贝卡下毒，现在她对雷麦黛丝之死感到自己有罪了。她祈求的并不是这样的灾难。雷麦黛丝给家里带来了快活的气氛。她跟丈夫住在作坊旁边的房间里，给整个卧室装饰了不久之前童年时代的木偶和玩具，可是她的欢乐溢出了卧室的四壁，象有益健康的和风拂过秋海棠长廊。太阳一出，她就唱歌。家中只有她一个人敢于干预雷贝卡和阿玛兰塔之间的纷争。为了照拂霍·阿·布恩蒂亚，她承担了不轻的劳动。她送吃的给他，拿肥皂和刷子给他擦擦洗洗，注意他的头发和胡子里不止虱子和虱卵，保持棕榈棚的良好状态，遇到雷雨天气，还给棕榈棚遮上一块不透水的帆布。在生前的最后几个月里，她学会了用粗浅的拉丁语跟霍·阿·布恩蒂亚谈话。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When the son of Aureliano and Pilar Ternera was born and brought to the house and baptized in an intimate ceremony with the name Aureliano José, Remedios decided that he would be considered their oldest child. Her maternal instinct surprised úrsula. Aureliano, for his part, found in the justification that he needed to live. He worked all day in his workshop and Remedios would bring him a cup of black coffee in the middle the morning. They would both visit the Moscotes every night. Aureliano would play endless games of dominoes with his father-in-law while Remedios chatted with her sisters or talked to her motabout more important things. The link with the Buendías consolidated Don Apolinar Moscote's authority in the town. On frequent trips to the capital of the province he succeeded in getting the government to build a school so that Arcadio, who had inherited the educational enthusiasm of his grandfather, could take charge of it. Through persuasion he managed to get the majority of houses painted blue in time for the date of national independence. At the urging of Father Nicanor, he arranged for the transfer of Catarino's store to a back street and he closed down several scandalous establishments that prospered in the center of town. Once he returned with six policemen armed with rifles to whom he entrusted the maintenance of order, and no one remembered the original agreement not to have armed men in the town. Aureliano enjoyed his father-in-law's efficiency. "You're going to get as fat as he is," his friends would say to him. But his sedentary life, which accentuated his cheekbones and concentrated the sparkle of his eyes, did not increase his weight or alter the parsimony of his character, but, on the contrary, it hardened on his lips the straight line of solitary meditation and implacable decision. So deep was the affection that he and his wife had succeeded in arousing in both their families that when Remedios announced that she was going to have a child. even Rebeca and Amaranta declared a truce in order to knit items in blue wool if it was to be a boy and in pink wool in case it was a girl. She was the last person Arcadio thought about a few years later when he faced the firing squad.</p><p>奥雷连诺和皮拉·苔列娜的孩子出世以后，给领到了家里，在家庭仪式上命名为奥雷连诺·霍塞，雷麦黛丝决定把他认做自己的大儿子。她做母亲的本能使得乌苏娜吃惊。奥雷连诺在干活上更是需要雷麦黛丝的。他整天在作坊里干活，雷麦黛丝每天早晨部给他送去一杯黑咖啡。每天晚上，他俩都去摩斯柯特家里。奥雷连诺和岳父没完没了地玩多米诺骨牌，雷麦黛丝就跟姐姐们聊天，或者跟母亲一起议论大人的事。跟布恩蒂亚家的亲戚关系，巩固了阿·摩斯柯特在马孔多的威望。他经常去省城，已经说服政府当局在马孔多开办一所学校，由继承了祖父教育热情的阿卡蒂奥管理。为了庆祝国家独立节，阿·摩斯柯特先生通过说服使得大部分房屋都刷成了蓝色。根据尼康诺神父的坚决要求，他命令卡塔林诺游艺场迁到偏僻的街道，并且关闭小镇中心区另外几个花天酒地的场所。有一次，阿·摩斯柯特先生从省城回来，带来了六名持枪的警察，由他们维持社会秩序，甚至谁也没有想起马孔多不留武装人员的最初的协议了。奥雷连诺欢喜岳父的活力。“你会变得象他那么肥胖，’--朋友们向他说。可是，由于经常坐在作坊里，他只是颧骨比较凸出，眼神比较集中，体重却没增加，拘谨的性格也没改变；恰恰相反，嘴边比较明显地出现了笔直的线条--独立思考和坚强决心的征象。奥雷连诺和他的妻子都得到了两家的深爱，所以，当雷麦黛丝说她将有孩子的时候，甚至阿玛兰塔和雷贝卡都暂时停止了扯皮，为孩子加紧编织两种颜色的毛线衣：蓝色的--如果生下的是男孩；粉红色的－－如果生下的是女孩。几年以后，奥雷连诺站在行刑队面前的时候，想到的最后一个人就是雷麦黛丝。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>úrsula ordered a mourning period of closed doors and windows, with no one entering or leaving except on matters of utmost necessity. She prohibited any talking aloud for a year and she put Remedios' daguerreotype in the place where her body had been laid out, with a black ribbon around it and an oil lamp that was always kept lighted. Future generations, who never let the lamp go out, would be puzzled at that girl in a pleated skirt, white boots, and with an organdy band around her head, and they were never able to connect her with the standard image of a great-grandmother. </p><p>乌苏娜宣布了严格的丧事，关闭了所有的门窗，如果没有极端的必要，决不允许任何人进出屋子；在一年之中，她禁止大家高声说话；殡丧日停放棺材的地方，墙上挂了雷麦黛丝的厢片，照片周围加了黑色缎带，下面放了一盏长明灯。布恩蒂亚的后代一直是让长明灯永不熄灭的，他们看见这个姑娘的照片就感到杌隍不安；这姑娘身着百褶裙，头戴蝉翼纱花巾，脚上穿了一双白皮鞋，子孙们简直无法把照片上的姑娘跟“曾祖母”本来的形象联系起来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Amaranta took charge of Aureliano José. She adopted him as a son who would share her solitude and relieve her from the involutary laudanum that her mad beseeching had thrown into Remedios' coffee. Pietro Crespi would tiptoe in at dusk, with a black ribbon on his hat, and he would pay a silent visit to Rebeca, who seemed to be bleeding to death inside the black dress with sleeves down to wrists. Just the idea of thinking about a new date for the wedding would have been so irreverent that the engagement turned into an eternal relationship, a fatigued love that no one worried about again, as if the lovers, who in other days had sabotaged the lamps in order to kiss, had been abandoned to the free will of death. Having lost her bearings, completely demoralized, Rebeca began eating earth again.</p><p>阿玛兰塔自动收养了奥雷连诺·霍塞。她希望拿他当儿子，分担她的孤独，减轻她的痛苦，因为她把疯狂弄来的鸦片酊偶然放到雷麦黛丝的咖啡里了。每天晚上，皮埃特罗·克列斯比都在帽上戴着黑色丝带，踮着脚走进屋来，打算悄悄地探望雷贝卡；她穿着黑色衣服，袖子长到手腕，显得萎靡不振。现在要想确定新的婚期，简直就是亵渎神灵了；他俩虽已订婚，却无法使关系往前推进，他俩的爱情令人讨厌、得不到关心，仿佛这两个灭了灯、在黑暗中接吻的情人只能听凭死神的摆布。雷贝卡失去了希望，精神萎顿，又开始吃土。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Suddenly-when the mourning had gone on so long that the needlepoint sessions began again-someone pushed open the street door at two in the afternoon in the mortal silence of the heat and the braces in the foundation shook with such force that Amaranta and her friends sewing on the porch, Rebeca sucking finger in her bedroom, úrsula in the kitchen, Aureliano in the workshop, and even José Arcadio Buendía under the solitary chestnut tree had the impression that an earthquake was breaking up the house. A huge man had arrived. His square shoulders barely fitted through the doorways. He was wearing a medal of Our Lady of Help around his bison neck, his arms and chest were completely covered with cryptic tattooing, and on his right wrist was the tight copper bracelet of the ni?osen-cruz amulet. His skin was tanned by the salt of the open air, his hair was short and straight like the mane of a mule, his jaws were of iron, and he wore a sad smile. He had a belt on that was twice as thick as the cinch of a horse, boots with leggings and spurs and iron on the heels, and his presence gave the quaking impression of a seismic tremor. He went through the parlor and the living room, carrying some half-worn saddlebags in his hand, and he appeared like a thunderclap on the porch with the begonias where Amaranta and her friends were paralyzed, their needles in the air. "Hello," he said to them in a tired voice, threw the saddlebags on a worktable, and went by on his way to the back of the house. "Hello," he said to the startled Rebecca, who saw him pass by the door of her bedroom. "Hello," he said to Aureliano, who was at his silversmith's bench with all five senses alert. He did not linger with anyone. He went directly to the kitchen and there he stopped for the first time at the end of a trip that had begun the other side of the world. "Hello," he said. úrsula stood for a fraction of a second with her mouth open, looked into his eyes, gave a cry, and flung her arms around his neck, shouting and weeping with joy. It was José Arcadio. He was returning as poor as when he had left, to such an extreme that úrsula had to give him two pesos to pay for the rental of his horse. He spoke a Spanish that was larded with sailor slang. They asked where he had been he answered: "Out there." </p><p>丧事开始之后过了不少时间，刺绣的人又聚在长廊上的时候，在一个死寂的炎热天，下午两点正，忽然有个人猛力推开了房屋的正门，使得整座房子都晃动起来；坐在长廊上的阿玛兰塔和她的女友们，在房间里咂吮手指的雷贝卡，厨房里的乌苏娜，作坊里的奥雷连诺，甚至栗树下的霍·阿·布恩蒂亚--全部觉得地震已经开始，房子就要倒塌了。门槛边出现了一个样子非凡的人。他那宽阔的肩膀勉强才挤过门洞，粗脖子上挂着一个“救命女神”像，胳膊和胸脯都刺满了花纹，右腕紧紧地箍着一个护身的铜镯。他的皮肤被海风吹成了棕褐包，头发又短又直，活象骡子的鬃毛，下巴显得坚毅，神情却很悒郁。他的腰带比马肚带粗一倍，高统皮靴钉了马刺，后跟包了铁皮；他一走动，一切都颤抖起来，犹如地震时一样。他手里拎着一个相当破烂的鞍囊，走过客厅和起居室，象雷霆一样出现在秋海棠长廊上，使得阿玛兰塔和她的女伴们把针拿在空中都呆住了。“哈罗！”--他用疲惫的声音打了个招呼，就把鞍囊扔在她们面前的桌上，继续朝房子深处走去。“哈罗！”他向惶恐地探望室外的雷贝卡说。“哈罗！”--他向全神贯注干活的奥雷连诺说。这人哪儿也没耽搁，一直走到厨房才停了下来，结束了他从世界另一边开始的旅行。 “哈罗！”--他说。刹那间，乌苏娜张着嘴巴发楞，然后看了看来人的眼睛，才“噢唷”一声，抱住他的脖子，高兴得又哭又叫。这是霍·阿卡蒂奥。他回家时也象离家时一样穷困，乌苏娜甚至不得不给他两个比索，偿付租马的费用。他说的是两班牙语，其中夹了许多水手行话。大家问他到过哪儿，他只同答：“那儿。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He hung his hammock in the room they assigned him and slept for three days. When he woke up, after eating sixteen raw eggs, he went directly to Catarino's store, where his monumental size provoked a panic of curiosity among the women. He called for music and cane liquor for everyone, to be put on his bill. He would Indian-wrestle with five men at the same time. "It can't be done," they said, convinced that they would not be able to move his arm. "He has ni?os-en-cruz." Catarino, who did not believe in magical tricks of strength, bet twelve pesos that he could not move the counter. José Arcadio pulled it out of its place, lifted it over his head, and put it in the street. It took eleven men to put it back. </p><p>在指定给他的房间里，他悬起吊床，一连睡了三天，醒来以后，他一口气吃了十六只生鸡蛋，就径直去卡塔林诺游艺场，他那粗壮的身抠在好奇的娘儿们中间引起了惊愕。他请在场的人听音乐、喝酒，全都记在他的账上，并且跟五个男人打赌，说他们加在一起也无法把他的手扳到桌上。“不行，”他们相信自己动不了他的手，就说。“因为他身上有魔镯。”卡塔林诺不相信他那神奇的力气，就拿十二个比索跟他打赌，说他搬动不了柜台。可他把柜台从地里拔了起来，举到头上，并且将它放在街上。为了搬回柜台，需要十一个男人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In the heat the party he exhibited his unusual masculinity on the bar, completely covered with tattoos of words in several languages intertwined in blue and red. To the women who were besieging him and coveting him he put the question as to who would pay the most. The one who had the most money offered him twenty pesos. Then he proposed raffling himself off among them at ten pesos a chance. It was a fantastic price because the most sought-after woman earned eight pesos a night, but they all accepted. They wrote their names on fourteen pieces of paper which they put into a hat and each woman took one out. When there were only two pieces left to draw, it was established to whom they belonged.</p><p>在兴味正浓的时候，他让大家参观他那异乎寻常的男性器官，上面刺了蓝色和红色的各种文字。他周围的娘儿们都兴致勃勃，他就问她们谁能多给点钱，一个最有钱的女人给了他二十个比索。接着，他主张拿他抽彩，每张彩票十个比索，看看谁能把他抽到。这个价格是大得惊人的，因为最红的女人一夜才能挣到八个比索，然而大家都同意了。十四张彩票写好之后，都放在一顶帽子里，大家开始抽——每个女人抽一张。最后只剩两张可能抽中的了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Five pesos more from each one," José Arcadio proposed, "and I'll share myself with both.</p><p>“每人多给五个比索，”霍·阿卡蒂奥向两个幸运的女人说。“我就让自己在你们之间平分。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He made his living that way. He had been around the world sixty-five times, enlisted in a crew of sailors without a country. The women who went to bed that night in Catarino's store brought him naked into the dance salon so that people could see that there was not a square inch of his body that was not tattooed, front and back, and from his neck to his toes.</p><p>他就是以此为生的。他充当一名水手，跟其他同样离乡背井的人一起作过六十五次环球航行。那天夜晚在卡塔林诺游艺场里跟他睡觉的女人，把他赤身露体地带到舞厅里给大家参观，他的身体——从面孔到脊背、从脖子到脚后跟——每一平方英寸都刺了花纹。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> He did not succeed in becoming incorporated into the family. He slept all day and spent the night in the red-light district, making bets on his strength. On the rare occasions when úrsula got him to sit down at the table, he gave signs of radiant good humor, especially when he told about his adventures in remote countries. He had been shipwrecked and spent two weeks adrift in the Sea of Japan, feeding on the body of a comrade who had succumbed to sunstroke and whose extremely salty flesh as it cooked in the sun had a sweet and granular taste. Under a bright noonday sun in the Gulf of Bengal his ship had killed a sea dragon, in the stomach of which they found the helmet, the buckles, and the weapons of a Crusader. In the Caribbean he had seen the ghost of the pirate ship of Victor Hugues, its sails torn by the winds of death, the masts chewed by sea worms, and still looking for the course to Guadeloupe. </p><p>霍·阿卡蒂奥几乎不跟家里的人来往，他白天睡觉，夜晚都在妓馆区度过，在少有的情况下，母亲让他坐在家中的桌子旁边时，他才引起了大家的注意，尤其是他谈起自己在遥远地区的那些冒险经历。他遇到过船舶失事，乘着舢板在日本海上漂泊了两个星期，拿中暑死去的同伴的尸体充饥——人肉好好地用盐腌透、晒干，比较粗硬，有点儿甜味。在一个晴朗的晌午，轮船在孟加拉湾航行时，船员们杀死了一条海龙，在它的肚子里，他们发现了十字军骑士的钢盔、钮扣和武器。在加勒比海，他瞧见了维克多·雨果（注：维克多·雨果，法国议会的瓜德罗普岛代表，曾同英国人进行过海盗式的战争。古巴作家阿列科·卡尔宾蒂耶的长篇小说《启蒙时代》就是描写他的。）海盗船的怪影：船帆被致命的飓风撕成了碎片，横桁和桅杆都被海蟑螂咬坏了，轮船仍然驶往瓜德罗普，但却永远迷失了航向。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>úrsula would weep at the table as if she were reading the letters that had never arrived and in which José Arcadio told about his deeds and misadventures. "And there was so much of a home here for you, my son," she would sob, "and so much food thrown to the hogs!" But underneath it an she could not conceive that the boy the gypsies took away was the same lout who would eat half a suckling pig for lunch and whose flatulence withered the flowers. Something similar took place with the rest of the family. Amaranta could not conceal the repugnance that she felt at the table because of his bestial belching. Arcadio, who never knew the secret of their relationship, scarcely answered the questions that he asked with the obvious idea of gaining his affection. Aureliano tried to relive the times when they slept in the same room, tried to revive the complicity of childhood, but José Arcadio had forgotten about it, because life at sea had saturated his memory with too many things to remember. </p><p>乌苏娜在桌边马上哭了起来，仿佛读了望眼欲穿的信似的，在这些信里，霍·阿卡蒂奥谈到了自己浪迹天涯的冒险遭遇。“咱们这儿有这么大的房子嘛，儿子，”她叹息地说。“而且咱们还把那么多的东西扔给猪吃！”但她怎么也不明白，吉卜赛人带走的这个孩子，已经成了一个野人，一次能吃半只猪崽，猛然呼出一口气就能使花儿枯萎。家里其他的人是有这种感觉的。对于他吃东西时打响嗝的习惯，阿玛兰塔无法掩饰自己的厌恶。阿卡蒂奥从来都不知道自己的出身秘密，对霍·阿卡蒂奥所提的问题只是勉强张张嘴巴，霍·阿卡蒂奥显然力图取得这青年的好感。奥雷连诺打算让哥哥忆起他俩同住一室的那些时光，恢复童年时代的亲密关系，可是霍·阿卡蒂奥把一切都忘到了九霄云外，——海洋生活中的许多事情已经占据了他的脑海。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Only Rebeca succumbed to the first impact. The day that she saw him pass by bedroom she thought that Pietro Crespi was a sugary dandy next to that protomale whose volcanic breathing could be heard all over the house. She tried to get near him under any pretext. On a certain occasion José Arcadio looked at her body with shameless attention and said to her "You're a woman, little sister." Rebeca lost control of herself. She went back to eating earth and the whitewash on the walls with the avidity of previous days, and she sucked her finger so much anxiety that she developed a callus on her thumb. She vomited up a green liquid with dead leeches in it. She spent nights awake shaking with fever, fighting against delirium, waiting until the house shook with the return of José Arcadio at dawn. </p><p>只有雷贝卡一人第一个眼就被击中了。那天晚上，霍·阿卡蒂奥经过她的卧室门前时，她觉得，皮埃特罗·克列斯比跟这个壮汉相比，不过是穿着漂亮的文弱书生；这个壮汉火山爆发似的声音，整座宅子都能听到。她打算利用各种借口跟他相见。有一次，霍·阿卡蒂奥不知羞耻地注意打量她的身姿，说道：“你完全成了个娘儿啦，小妹妹。”雷贝卡失去了自制，又象往日一样，开始贪馋地大吃泥土和墙上的石灰，而且拼命咂吮指头，以致指头上出现了茧子。有一回，她呕吐出了绿色的液体和死了的水蛭。夜里，她不睡觉，哆哆嗦嗦，仿佛患了热病，狂烈挣扎，一直等到天亮时房子震动，霍·阿卡蒂奥来到。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>One afternoon, when everyone was having a siesta, she could no longer resist and went to his bedroom. She found him in his shorts, lying in the hammock that he had hung from the beams with a ship's hawser. She was so impressed by his enormous motley nakedness that she felt an impulse to retreat. "Excuse me," she said, "I didn't know you were here." But she lowered her voice so as not to wake anyone up. "Come here," he said. Rebeca obeyed. She stopped beside the hammock in an icy sweat, feeling knots forming in her intestines, while José Arcadio stroked her ankles with the tips of his fingers, then her calves, then her thighs, murmuring: "Oh, little sister, little sister." She had to make a supernatural effort not to die when a startlingly regulated cyclonic power lifted her up by the waist and despoiled her of her intimacy with three clashes of its claws and quartered her like a little bird. She managed to thank God for having been born before she lost herself in the inconceivable pleasure of that unbearable pain, splashing in the steaming marsh of the hammock which absorbed the explosion of blood like a blotter.</p><p>有一次午睡的时候，雷贝卡再也按捺不住，就走进了霍·阿卡蒂奥的卧室。她发现他只穿着裤衩躺在一个吊床上，这吊床是用粗大的船索悬在梁上的。他那粗壮、裸露的躯体把她吓了一跳，她想后退。“对不起，”她抱歉地说。“我不知道你在这儿。”可她说得声音很低，不想吵醒别人。“到这儿来吧，”他说。她听从地站在吊床跟前，浑身直冒冷汗，觉得自己五脏六腑都缩紧了，而霍·阿卡蒂奥却用指尖抚摸她的脚踝，然后又抚摸她的小腿，最后又抚摸她的大腿，低声说：“唉，小妹妹，唉，小妹妹。”接着，一种异常准确的、飓风似的强大力量把她拦腰抱起，三两下脱掉了她的衣服，就将她象小鸟儿一样压扁了；这时她作了非凡的努力，才没有一命呜呼。她刚刚感谢上帝让她生在人世，就由于难以忍受的疼痛加上不可思议的快感而失去知觉，在吊床上热气腾腾的泥淖里挣扎，这片泥淖犹如吸墨纸吸去了她体内排出的精髓。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Three days later they were married during the five-o’clock mass. Jos?Arcadio had gone to Pietro Crespi’s store the day before. He found him giving a zither lesson and did not draw him aside to speak to him. “I’m going to marry Rebeca,?he told him. Pietro Crespi turned pale, gave the zither to one of his pupils, and dismissed the class. When they were alone in the room that was crowded with musical instruments and mechanical toys, Pietro Crespi said:</p><p>三天之后，他们在晚祷时结婚了。前一天，霍·阿卡蒂奥前往皮埃特罗·克列斯比的商店。这意大利人正在教齐特拉琴，霍·阿卡蒂奥甚至没有把他叫到一边去，就向他说：“我要跟雷贝卡结婚了。”皮埃特罗·克列斯比黯然失色，把齐特拉琴交给一个学生，就宣布下课。屋子里满是乐器和自动玩具，他俩单独留下以后，皮埃特罗·克列斯比说：</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"She's your sister."</p><p>“她是你的妹妹呀！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I don't care," José Arcadio replied.</p><p>“这不要紧，”霍·阿卡蒂奥说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Pietro Crespi mopped his brow with the handkerchief that was soaked in lavender.</p><p>皮埃特罗·克列斯比拿洒了薰衣草香水的手绢擦了擦脑门。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It's against nature," he explained, "and besides, it's against the law."</p><p>“这是违反自然的，”他解释说。“此外，也是法律禁止的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>José Arcadio grew impatient, not so much at the argument as over Pietro Crespi's paleness.</p><p>让霍·阿卡蒂奥生气的，与其说是皮埃特罗·克列斯比所讲的理由，不如说是他的苍白脸色。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Fuck nature two times over," he said. "And I've come to tell you not to bother going to ask Rebeca anything."</p><p>“我不在乎自然，”他说。“我把一切都告诉你，是让你别为自己操心，也别向雷贝卡问些什么。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But his brutal deportment broke down when he saw Pietro Crespi's eyes grow moist.</p><p>但是，发现皮埃特罗·克列斯比眼里的泪水之后，他缓和了下来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Now," he said to him in a different tone, "if you really like the family, there's Amaranta for you."</p><p>“现在，”他用另一种口吻向他说，“如果你真喜欢这个家庭，那么阿玛兰塔就留给你。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Father Nicanor revealed in his Sunday sermon that José Arcadio and Rebeca were not brother and sister. úrsula never forgave what she considered an inconceivable lack of respect and when they came back from church she forbade the newlyweds to set foot in the house again. For her it was as if they were dead. So they rented a house across from the cemetery and established themselves there with no other furniture but José Arcadio's hammock. On their wedding night a scorpion that had got into her slipper bit Rebeca on the foot. Her tongue went to sleep, but that did not stop them from spending a scandalous honeymoon. The neighbors were startled by the cries that woke up the whole district as many as eight times in a single night and three times during siesta, and they prayed that such wild passion would not disturb the peace of the dead.</p><p>尽管尼康诺神父在礼拜日布道时当众宣布，霍·阿卡蒂奥和雷贝卡并不是兄妹，但是乌苏娜根本就不原谅他俩的婚姻。她认为这种对她不尊重的婚姻是不能容忍的，所以就在那一天，在新婚夫妇从教堂回来的时候，她就禁止他俩跨进她家的门坎。在她看来，他俩等于死了。于是，新婚夫妇在墓地对面租了间小房子，住在那儿，除了霍·阿卡蒂奥的吊床，没有其他任何家具。在新婚之夜，藏在新娘鞋子里的蝎子把她的一只脚给螫了，雷贝卡说不出话来，但这并没有妨碍夫妇俩丑恶地度蜜月。邻居们对他俩的叫声十分惊愕，这种叫声一夜吵醒整个街区八次，午睡时吵醒邻居三次，大家都祈求这种放荡的情欲不要破坏死人的安宁。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Aureliano was the only one who was concerned about them. He bought them some furniture and gave them some money until José Arcadio recovered his sense of reality and began to work the noman's-land that bor-dered the courtyard of the house. Amaranta, on the other hand, never did overcome her rancor against Rebeca, even though life offered her a satisfaction of which she had not dreamed: at the initiative of úrsula, who did not know how to repair the shame, Pietro Crespi continued having lunch at the house on Tuesdays, rising above his defeat with a serene dignity. He still wore the black ribbon on his hat as a sign of respect for the family, and he took pleasure in showing his affection for úrsula by bringing her exotic gifts: Portuguese sardines, Turkish rose marmalade, and on one occasion a lovely Manila shawl. Amaranta looked after him with a loving diligence. She anticipated his wants, pulled out the threads on the cuffs of his shirt, and embroidered a dozen handkerchiefs with his initials for his birthday. On Tuesdays, after lunch, while she would embroider on the porch, he would keep her happy company. For Pietro Crespi, that woman whom he always had considered and treated as a child was a revelation. Although her temperament lacked grace, she had a rare sensibility for appreciating the things of the world had a secret tenderness. One Tuesday, when no one doubted that sooner or later it had to happen, Pietro Crespi asked her to marry him. She did not stop her work. She waited for the hot blush to leave her ears and gave her voice a serene stress of maturity.</p><p>只有奥雷连诺关心年轻的夫妇。他给他俩买了一点家具，给了他们一点儿钱，直到霍·阿卡蒂奥恢复了现实感，开始耕耘同他的房子毗连的一块荒地。至于阿玛兰塔，她始终克制不了对雷贝卡的仇恨，虽然生活给了她梦想不到的快乐。乌苏娜不知如何洗刷家里的耻辱，可是按照她的愿望，皮埃特罗·克列斯比每星期二继续在他们家里吃午饭，宽宏大量地忍受了自已的不幸。为了表示对这个家庭的尊重，他仍在帽子上戴着黑带子，高兴地赠送乌苏娜一些外国礼品，如葡萄牙沙丁鱼或者土耳其玫瑰果酱，借以表示自己对她的忠诚；有一次，他甚至赠给她一张漂亮的马尼拉披巾。阿玛兰塔对他既殷勤又温存。她猜到了他的意思，抢先剪掉了他的衬衫袖口上绽开的缝线；为了庆祝他的生日，她在一打手帕上绣了他的简写姓名。每逢星期二，午饭之后，当她正在长廊上刺绣的时候，他都陪着她，尽量使她快活。皮埃特罗·克列斯比一贯把这姑娘看做一个小娃儿，但他在她身上发现了一些新的特点。她不够雅致，然而却有不寻常的见识和潜在的温情。谁也不会怀疑，皮埃特罗·克列斯比会向阿玛兰塔求婚的。的确，在一个星期二，他就要求她嫁给他了。她没中止自己的活儿，等耳朵发烧过了之后，才象成年人那样，给自己的嗓音加上一种平静和稳定的调子。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Of course, Crespi," she said. "But when we know each other better. It's never good to be hasty in things."</p><p>“当然罗，克列斯比，”她说。“但要等咱们彼此更加了解以后，过急不好嘛。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>úrsula was confused. In spite of the esteem she had for Pietro Crespi, she could not tell whether his decision was good or bad from the moral point of view after his prolonged and famous engagement to Rebeca. But she finally accepted it as an unqualified fact because no one shared her doubts. Aureliano, who was the man of the house, confused her further with his enigmatic and final opinion:</p><p>乌苏娜给弄得糊里糊涂。她虽尊重皮埃特罗·克列斯比，但是怎么也闹不明白，从道德观点来说，他的决定不知是好是坏，因为他跟雷贝卡早就订过婚，而他俩的婚事是可耻地告终的。最后，她把他的求婚当成了既成事实——未作任何评价，因为谁也不赞同她的疑虑。家中唯一的男人——奥雷连诺表示神秘、断然的意见，只是加重了她的混乱。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"These are not times to go around thinking about weddings."</p><p>“现在不是考虑结婚的时候。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>That opinion, which úrsula understood only some months later, was the only sincere one that Aureliano could express at that moment, not only with respect to marriage, but to anything that was not war. </p><p>这句话的含义是乌苏娜几个月以后才理解的，不仅就结婚来说，而且就其他任何事情来说（只有战争除外），它都是奥雷连诺那时能够表达的唯一真实的见解。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He himself, facing a firing squad, would not understand too well the concatenation of the series of subtle but irrevocable accidents that brought him to that point. The death of Remedios had not produced the despair that he had feared. It was, rather, a dull feeling of rage that grades ally dissolved in a solitary and passive frustration similar to the one he had felt during the time he was resigned to living without a woman. He plunged into his work again, but he kept up the custom of playing dominoes with his father-in-law. In a house bound up in mourning, the nightly conversations consolidated the friendship between the two men. "Get married again. Aurelito," his father-in-law would tell him. "I have six daughters for you to choose from." </p><p>站在行刑队面前的时候，他自己也不大明白，一连串不可捉摸的、难以避免的偶然事件如何使他到了这个地步。雷麦黛丝之死使他受到的震动，比他担心的事情还小一些。她的死在他心中引起的狂乱感觉，逐渐溶化成了孤独的、消极的失望感，就象他决定不再跟女人来往时的那种感觉，他一头扎进工作，但是保持了跟岳父玩多米诺骨牌的习惯。在这座充满哀悼气氛的房子里，夜间的交谈增强了两个男人的感情。“再结婚吧，奥雷连诺！”岳父向他说。“我还有六个女儿，任你挑选一个。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>On one occasion on the eve of the elections, Don Apolinar Moscote returned from one of his frequent trips worried about the political situation in the country. The Liberals were determined to go to war. Since Aureliano at that time had very confused notions about the difference between Conservatives and Liberals, his father-in-law gave him some schematic lessons. The Liberals, he said, were Freemasons, bad people, wanting to hang priests, to institute civil marriage and divorce, to recognize the rights of illegitimate children as equal to those of legitimate ones, and to cut the country up into a federal system that would take power away from the supreme authority. The Conservatives, on the other hand, who had received their power directly from God, proposed the establishment public order and family morality. They were the defenders of the faith of Christ, of the principle of authority, and were not prepared to permit the country to be broken down into autonomous entities. Because of his humanitarian feelings Aureliano sympathized with the Liberal attitude with respect to the rights of natural children, but in any case, he could not understand how people arrived at the extreme of waging war over things that could not be touched with the hand. </p><p>有一次，在选举之前不久，马孔多镇长公务旅行回来，对国内的政治局势非常忧虑。自由党人准备发动战争。由于当时奥雷连诺时保守党人和自由党人的观念十分模糊，岳父就向他简单地说明了两党之间的区别。他说，自由党人是共济会会员，是坏人，他们主张绞死教土，实行自由的结婚和离婚，承认婚生子和非婚生子的平等权利，并且打算推翻最高政权，把国家分割开来，实行联邦制。相反地，保守党人直接从上帝那儿接受权力，维护稳定的社会秩序和家庭道德，保护基督——政权的基础，不容许国家分崩离析。奥雷连诺出于人道主义精神，同情自由党人有关非婚生子权利的主张，但他不明白的是，由于双手都摸不到的东西，为什么需要走上极端、发动战争。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It seemed an exaggeration to him that for the elections his father-in--law had them send six soldiers armed with rifles under the comma sergeant to a town with no political passions. They not only arrived, but they went from house to house confiscating hunting weapons, machetes, and even kitchen knives before they distributed among males over twenty-one the blue ballots with the names of the Conservative candidates and the red ballots the names of the Liberal candidates. On the eve of the elections Don Apolinar Moscote himself read a decree that prohibited the sale of alcoholic beverages and the gathering together of more than three people who were not of the same family. The elections took place without incident. At eight o'clock on Sunday morning a wooden ballot box was set up in the square, which was watched over by the six soldiers. The voting was absolutely free, as Aureliano himself was able to attest since he spent almost the entire day with his father-in-law seeing that no one voted more than once. At four in the afternoon a roll drums in the square announced the closing of the polls and Don Apolinar Moscote sealed the ballot box with a label crossed by his signature. That night, while he played dominoes with Aureliano, he ordered the sergeant to break the seal in order to count the votes. There were almost as many red ballots as blue, but the sergeant left only ten red ones made up the difference with blue ones. Then they sealed the box again with a new label and the first thing on the following day it was taken to the capital of the province. </p><p>他觉得岳父过于热心了，因为选举期间，在这毫无政治热情的市镇上，他的岳父竟调来了一个军士率领的六名带枪的士兵。士兵们到了这儿，就挨家挨户没收猎枪、砍刀、甚至菜刀，然后向二十一岁以上的男人分发选票：写有保守党候选人姓名的蓝票和写有自由党候选人姓名的红票。选举前一天——星期六，阿·摩斯柯特先生亲自宣读了一项命令：从午夜起，在四十八小时内，禁止出售酒类，如果不是一家人，还禁止三人以上聚在一起。选举之前没有发生事故。星期天上午八时，广场上安了个木制的投票箱，由六名士兵守卫。投票是绝对自由的，奥雷连诺自己就相信这一点，因为他几乎整天站在岳父身边，没有看见任何人多投一次票。午后四时，咚咚的鼓声宣布投票结束，阿·摩斯柯特先生给投票箱贴上了他署名的封条。晚上，跟奥雷连诺玩多米诺骨牌时，他命令军士撕去封条，统计选票。红票跟蓝票几乎相等，可是军士只留下十张红票，加多了蓝票。然后，他们给选票箱贴上新的封条，第二天拂晓，就把它送到省城去了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The Liberals will go to war," Aureliano said. Don Apolinar concentrated on his domino pieces. "If you're saying that because of the switch in ballots, they won't," he said.</p><p>“自由党人就要发动战争啦，”奥雷连诺说。阿·摩斯柯特先生甚至没从自己的筹码上抬起眼来。“如果你以为原因是偷换选票，那就不会发生战争，”他说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> "We left a few red ones in so there won't be any complaints." Aureliano understood the disadvantages of being in the opposition. "I were a Liberal," he said, "I'd go to war because of those ballots." His father-in-law looked at him over his glasses.</p><p>“因为选票箱里留下了一些红票，他们就无从抱怨了。”奥雷连诺明白反对党的处境是不利的。“如果我是自由党人，”他说，“我就会由于这种选票的把戏发动战争”岳父从眼镜上方瞥了他一眼。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Come now, Aurelito," he said, "if you were a Liberal, even though you're my son-in-law, you wouldn't have seen the switching of the ballots."</p><p>“哎，奥雷连诺，”他说，“如果你是自由党人，你就看不到掉换选票的事了，即使你是我的女婿。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>What really caused indignation in the town was. not the results of the elections but the fact that the soldiers had not returned the weapons. A group of women spoke with Aureliano so that he could obtain the return of their kitchen knives from his father-in-law. Don Apolinar Moscote explained to him, in strictest confidence, that the soldiers had taken the weapons off as proof that the Liberals were preparing for war. The cynicism of the remark alarmed him. He said nothing, but on a certain night when Gerineldo Márquez and Magnífico Visbal were speaking with some other friends about the incident of the knives, they asked him if he was a Liberal or a Conservative. Aureliano did not hesitate.</p><p>引起全镇愤怒的不是选举结果，而是士兵们拒绝归还收走的刀子和猎枪。妇女们请求奥雷连诺向岳父说说情，哪怕把菜刀还给她们也成。阿·摩斯柯特先生十分机密地向他说，士兵们已经运走了没收的武器，拿去当作自由党人准备打仗的物证。这种说法的可耻使奥雷连诺吃了一惊。他没吭声，可是有一天晚上，格林列尔多·马克斯和马格尼菲柯·维斯巴尔跟其他几个朋友谈论菜刀的事情时，问他是自由党人还是保守党人，他一分钟也没犹豫。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"If I have to be something I'll be a Liberal," he said, "because the Conservatives are tricky."</p><p>“如果非要是个什么人不可，那我宁愿做一个自由党人，因为保守党人是骗子。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>On the following day, at the urging of his friends, he went to see Dr. Alirio Noguera to be treated for a supposed pain in his liver. </p><p>第二天，根据朋友们的嘱咐，他去见阿里吕奥·诺格拉医生，借口是治肝病。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He did not even understand the meaning of the subterfuge. Dr. Alirio Noguera had arrived in Macondo a few years before with a medicine chest of tasteless pills and a medical motto that convinced no one: One nail draws another. </p><p>奥雷连诺根本就不明白为什么需要这样撒谎。阿里吕奥·诺格拉医生是几年前来到马孔多的，随身带着一箱无味的药丸；他有一句谁也不懂的医学名言：“以毒攻毒。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In reality he was a charlatan. Behind his innocent fa?ade of a doctor without prestige there was hidden a terrorist who with his short legged boots covered the scars that five years in the stocks had left on his legs. Taken prisoner during the first federalist adventure, he managed to escape to Cura?ao disguised in the garment he detested most in this world: a cassock. At the end of a prolonged exile, stirred up by the exciting news that exiles from all over the Caribbean brought to Cura?ao, he set out in a smuggler’s schooner and appeared in Riohacha with the bottles of pills that were nothing but refined sugar and a diploma from the University of Leipzig that he had forged himself. He wept with disappointment. The federalist fervor, which the exiles had pictured as a powder keg about to explode, had dissolved into a vague electoral illusion. Embittered by failure, yearning for a safe place where he could await old age, the false homeopath took refuge in Macondo. In the narrow bottle-crowded room that he rented on one side of the square, he lived several years off the hopelessly ill who, after having tried everything, consoled themselves with sugar pills. </p><p>其实，诺格拉只是个冒牌的医生。从平庸的外表看来，他是个不走运的医生，实际上是个恐怖分子。他那高高的护腿套遮住了五年苦役中脚镣留在脚踝上的伤疤。他在联邦主义者的第一次暴动之后被捕，但他穿上自己最讨厌的衣服——教士的长袍——逃到了库拉索岛（注：在西印度群岛）。在他长时间的流亡之后，加勒比海群岛的政治流亡者把一些愉快消息带到了库拉索岛，使他受到很大的鼓舞，他就坐上一条走私纵帆船，带着一些药瓶到了列奥阿察，瓶子里装的不过是用纯糖做成的药丸，而且他身上还有他亲手伪造的莱比锡大学毕业证书。在列奥阿察，由于绝望，他甚至痛哭了。流亡者们曾把联邦主义者描绘成就要爆炸的火药桶，但在选举之前模糊的幻想中，联邦主义者的热情冷却了。这个伪装的医生由于失败而感到沮丧，现在只想找到一个安全的地方宁静地度过余年，所以就隐居马孔多了。在市镇广场旁边的一座房子里，他租了一个狭小的房间，房间里摆满了小药瓶；他已在这儿住了几年，靠绝望的病人为生一－这些病人用尽了一切办法，只好在糖球里寻求安慰了。</p></div>
"<div class='layout'><p>His instincts of an agitator remained dormant as long as Don Apolinar Moscote was a figurehead. He passed the time remembering and fighting against asthma. The  approach of the elections was the thread that led him once more to the skein of subversion. He made contact with the young people in the town, who lacked political knowledge, and he embarked on a stealthy campaign of instigation. The numerous red ballots that appeared is the box and that were attributed by Don Apolinar Moscote to the curiosity that came from youth were part of his plan: he made his disciples vote in order to show them that elections were a farce. “The only effective thing,?he would say, “is violence.?The majority of Aureliano’s friends were enthusiastic over the idea of liquidating the Conservative establishment, but no one had dared include him in the plans, not only because of his ties with the magistrate, but because of his solitary and elusive character. It was known, furthermore, that he had voted blue at his father-in-law’s direction. So it was a simple matter of chance that he revealed his political sentiments, and it was purely a matter of curiosity, a caprice, that brought him to visit the doctor for the treatment of a pain that he did not have. In the den that smelled of camphorated cobwebs he found himself facing a kind of dusty iguana whose lungs whistled when he breathed. Before asking him any questions the doctor took him to the window and examined the inside of his lower eyelid. “It’s not there,?Aureliano said, following what they told him. He pushed the tips of his fingers into his liver and added: “Here’s where I have the pain that won’t let me sleep.?Then Dr. Noguera closed the window with the pretext that there was too much sun, and explained to him in simple terms that it was a patriotic duty to assassinate Conservatives. For several days Aureliano carried a small bottle of pills in his shirt pocket. He would take it out every two hours, put three pills in the palm of his hand, and pop them into his mouth for them to be slowly dissolved on his tongue. Don Apolinar Moscote made fun of his faith in homeopathy, but those who were in on the plot recognized another one of their people in him. Almost all of the sons of the founders were implicated, although none of them knew concretely what action they were plotting. Nevertheless, the day the doctor revealed the secret to Aureliano, the latter elicited the whole plan of the conspiracy. Although he was convinced at that time of the urgency of liquidating the Conservative regime, the plot horrified him. Dr. Noguera had a mystique of personal assassination. His system was reduced to coordinating a series of individual actions which in one master stroke covering the whole nation would liquidate the functionaries of the regime along with their respective families, especially the children, in order to exterminate Conservatism at its roots. Don Apolinar Moscote, his wife, and his six daughters, needless to say, were on the list.
</p><p>阿·摩斯柯特是个有名无实的镇长时，医生的煽动本领还没表现出来。他把一切时间用于回忆往事，并且跟气喘病进行斗争。对他来说，临近的选举是引路的线索，可以帮助他重新找到颠覆活动的纽结。他跟镇上缺乏政治经验的年轻人联系，并且展开了秘密的、不懈的挑唆活动。阿·摩斯柯特先生认为，选票箱里出现许多红色选票是出于年轻人特有的轻率，但这些选票却是诺格拉按照计划让自己的学生们去投的，想让他们自己看看选举不过是无耻的把戏。“有效的是暴力，”他向他们说。奥雷连诺的大多数朋友热衷于消灭保守制度，但他们不敢把自己的计划告诉奥雷连诺，担心的不仅是他跟镇长的亲戚关系，还有他那难以捉摸的孤僻性格。何况大家知道，奥雷连诺根据岳父的嘱咐投了蓝票。所以，只是在一种偶然情况下，他表露了他的政治观点，而且纯粹由于好奇，他才跨出了这疯狂的一步——去找医生治疗他没有的疾病。在猪圈一样肮脏的小房间里，蛛网密布，洋溢着樟脑气味，他看见了一个骸蜥似的衰朽老头儿，他的肺部呼吸时发出咝咝的声音。老医生什么也没问，就把奥雷连诺领到窗口，检查他的下眼皮内部。“不是这儿，”奥雷连诺依照别人给他的嘱咐说，然后用指尖按住肝脏，补充道：“我感到这儿痛，痛得睡不着觉。”于是，诺格拉医生借口室内阳光太强，关上了窗子，言简意赅地向他说明，爱国者的义务就是杀死保守党人。在几天之中，奥雷连诺都在衬衣口袋里带着一只小药瓶。每两小时，他都拿出药瓶来，把三枚药丸倾入手心，一下子将它们投到嘴里，然后在舌头上慢慢地溶化。阿·摩斯柯特先生笑他相信“顺势疗法”，而参加密谋的人却承认他是自己人。马孔多所有老居民的儿子几乎都卷入了阴谋，虽然其中没有一个人清楚地知道，他们面临的究竟是什么行动。然而，医生刚向奥雷连诺吐露了这个秘密，他立即退出了阴谋。尽管奥雷连诺当时相信消灭保守制度是必要的，但是医生的阴谋却使他不寒而栗。阿里吕奥·诺格拉是个人恐怖的信徒。他的计划就是在全国范围内协同一致地同时大肆谋杀，一下子消灭所有的政府官吏和他们的家庭，尤其是他们的男孩子，从而彻底铲除保守主义的根苗。阿·摩斯柯特先生、他的夫人和六个女儿当然都在名单之内。</p></div>"
<div class='layout'><p>"You're no Liberal or anything else," Aureliano told him without getting excited. "You're nothing but a butcher."</p><p>“你不是什么自由党人，”奥雷连诺甚至面不改色，向他说道，“你只是一个屠夫。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"In that case," the doctor replied with equal calm, "give me back the bottle. You don't need it any more."</p><p>“那么，”医生同样平静地回答他，“把药瓶还我。你再也不需要它了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Only six months later did Aureliano learn that the doctor had given up on him as a man of action because he was a sentimental person with no future, with a passive character, and a definite solitary vocation. They tried to keep him surrounded, fearing that he would betray the conspiracy. Aureliano calmed them down: he would not say a word, but on the night they went to murder the Moscote family they would find him guarding the door. He showed such a convincing decision that the plan was postponed for an indefinite date. It was during those days that úrsula asked his opinion about the marriage between Pietro Crespi and Amaranta, and he answered that these were not times to be thinking about such a thing. For a week he had been carrying an old-fashioned pistol under his shirt. He kept his eyes on his friends. In the afternoon he would go have coffee with José Arcadio and Rebeca, who had begun to put their house in order, and from seven o'clock on he would play dominoes with his father-in-law. At lunchtime he was chatting with Arcadio, who was already a huge adolescent, and he found him more and more excited over the imminence of war. In school, where Arcadio had pupils older than himself mixed in with children who were barely beginning to talk, the Liberal fever had caught on. There was talk of shooting Father Nicanor, of turning the church into a school, of instituting free love. Aureliano tried to calm down his drive. He recommended discretion and prudence to him. Deaf to his calm reasoning, to his sense of reality, Arcadio reproached him in public for his weakness of character. Aureliano waited. Finally, in the beginning of December, úrsula burst into the workshop all upset.</p><p>奥雷连诺半年以后才知道，医生认为他是一个很不适于干事的人，温情脉脉，性格消沉，喜欢孤独。朋友们担心他把阴谋泄露出去，试图吓他一下。奥雷连诺叫他们放心，说他不会向任何人透露一句；可是那天夜里，朋友们前去暗杀摩斯柯特一家人时，他却在门口把守。阴谋分子见他下了决心，就不敢动手，只好不定期地推迟了计划的执行。正是那时，乌苏娜跟儿子商量皮埃特罗·克列斯比和阿玛兰塔的婚事，儿子回答他说现在不是考虑这种事情的时候。已经整整一个星期，奥雷连诺怀里藏着旧式手枪，监视着自己的一伙朋友。现在，午饭以后，他都去霍·阿卡蒂奥和雷贝卡那儿喝咖啡，他俩已把自己的家稍微整顿好了一些；下午六时以后，奥雷连诺都跟岳父玩多米诺骨牌。每天早上，早餐的时候，他都跟已经成了高大青年的阿卡蒂奥聊天，发现这小伙子对于战争显然不可避免而日益高兴。他在自己的学校里也染上了自由主义的热病；在他的学校里，除了刚会说话的小孩儿，还有年岁比老师还大的高个子。他高谈阔论地说：应当枪毙尼康诺神父，把教堂变成学校；应当宣布恋爱自由。奥雷连诺竭力抑制他的激烈情绪，劝他谨慎小心。可是阿卡蒂奥却对他冷静的规劝和健全的想法充耳不闻，当众指责他性格脆弱。奥雷连诺只好等待。十二月上旬，乌苏娜终于惊惶不安地冲进作坊。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"War's broken out!"</p><p>“战争爆发啦！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>War, in fact, had broken out three months before. Martial law was in effect in the whole country. The only one who knew it immediately was Don Apolinar Moscote, but he did not give the news even to his wife while the army platoon that was to occupy the town by surprise was on its way. They entered noiselessly before dawn, with two pieces of light artillery drawn by mules, and they set up their headquarters in the school. A 6 P.M. curfew was established. A more drastic search than the previous one was undertaken, house by house, and this time they even took farm implements. They dragged out Dr. Noguera, tied him to a tree in the square, and shot him without any due process of law. FatNicanor tried to impress the military authorities with the miracle of levitation and had his head split open by the butt of a soldier's rifle. The Liberal exaltation had been extinguished into a silent terror. Aureliano, pale, mysterious, continued playing dominoes with his father-in-law. He understood that in spite of his present title of civil and military leader of the town, Don Apolinar Moscote was once more a figurehead. The decisions were made by the army captain, who each morning collected an extraordinary levy for the defense of public order. Four soldiers under his command snatched a woman who had been bitten by a mad dog from her family and killed her with their rifle butts. One Sunday, two weeks after the occupation, Aureliano entered Gerineldo Márquez's house his usual terseness asked for a mug of coffee without sugar. When the two of them were alone in the kitchen, Aureliano gave his voice an authority that had never been heard before. "Get the boys ready," he said. "We're going to war." Gerineldo Márquez did not believe him.</p><p>其实，战争已经进行了三个月。全国都处于战时状态。马孔多只有阿·摩斯柯特先生一个人及时知道了这个消息，但他甚至避免把它告诉自己的妻子，直到奉命进入这个市镇的军队突然来临。士兵们是在拂晓之前悄悄地进来的，带着骡子拉的两门轻炮，把指挥所设在学校里，宣布下午六时以后为戒严时间。他们在每座房子里都进行了比前次更严厉的搜查——这一次连农具都给拿走了。他们从房子里拖出诺格拉医生，把他绑在市镇广场的一棵树上，未经审讯就将他枪决了。尼康诺神父试图用“升空”的奇迹影响这帮军人，可是一个士兵却拿枪托敲他的脑袋。自由党人的激烈情绪消失了，变成了无声的恐怖。奥雷连诺脸色苍白，神秘莫测。继续跟岳父玩多米诺骨牌。他明白，阿·摩斯柯特先生虽然拥有市镇军政长官的头衔，但又成了有名无实的镇长。一切都是指挥警备队的一个上尉决定的，他每天早上都想出一种新鲜的特别税，以满足公共秩序保卫者的需要。他的四个士兵从一户人家拖出疯狗咬伤的一个女人，就在街道中间用枪托把她打死了。市镇被占之后过了两周的一个星期天，奥雷连诺走进格林列尔多·马克斯的住所，象往常一样温和地要了一杯无糖的咖啡。他俩单独呆在厨房里的时候，奥雷连诺用他从来没有过的威严口吻说，“叫朋友们准备吧，咱们要去打仗啦。”格林列尔多·马克斯不相信他的话。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"With what weapons?" he asked.</p><p>“用什么武器？”他问。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"With theirs," Aureliano replied.</p><p>“用他们的武器，”奥雷连诺回答。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Tuesday at midnight in a mad operation, twenty-one men under the age of thirty commanded by Aureliano Buendía, armed with table knives and sharpened tools, took the garrison by surprise, seized the weapons, and in the courtyard executed the captain and the four soldiers who had killed the woman.</p><p>星期二夜晚，在不顾一切的大胆行动中，二十一个三十岁以下的人，在奥雷连诺的指挥下，拿着菜刀和利器，出其不意地袭击了警备队，夺取了枪支，在广场上枪决了上尉和打死女人的那四个士兵。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>That same night, while the sound of the firing squad could be heard, Arcadio was named civil and military leader of the town. The married rebels barely had time to take leave of their wives, whom they left to their our devices. They left at dawn, cheered by the people who had been liberated from the terror, to join the forces of the revolutionary general Victorio Medina, who, according to the latest reports, was on his way to Manaure. Before leaving, Aureliano brought Don Apolinar Moscote out of a closet. "Rest easy, father-in-law," he told him. "The new government guarantees on its word of honor your personal safety and that of your family." Don Apolinar Moscote had trouble identifying that conspirator in high boots and with a rifle slung over his shoulder with the person he had played dominoes with until nine in the evening.</p><p>就在那天夜里，广场上还传来行刑队枪声的时候，阿卡蒂奥被任命为马孔多的军政长官。那些已有家室的暴动者几乎没有时间跟妻子告别，就让她们听天由命了。黎明时分，在摆脱了恐怖的居民们欢呼之下，奥雷连诺的队伍离开马孔多，去同革命将军维克多里奥·麦丁纳的部队会合，据最近的消息，他的部队正向马诺尔移动。在离开之前，奥雷连诺从一个衣橱里把阿·摩斯柯特先生拉了出来。“别怕，岳父，”他说，“新政府说话算数，保证您和全家的人身安全。”阿·摩斯柯特先生好不容易才闹明白，这个脚穿高统皮靴、肩挎步枪的暴动分子，就是经常跟他玩多米诺骨牌玩到晚上九点的女婿。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"This is madness, Aurelito," he exclaimed.</p><p>“奥雷连诺，这是发疯，”他说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Not madness,”Aureliano said. “War. And don’t call me Aurelito any more. Now I’m Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</p><p>“这不是发疯，”奥雷连诺说。“这是战争。别再叫我奥雷连诺；从现在起，我是奥雷连诺上校了。”</p></div>
