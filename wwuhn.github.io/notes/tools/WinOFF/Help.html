<a name="ShutDownPlanning"></a><h3>Shutdown planning tab</h3>
<h4>Shutdown modes/conditions</h4>

<ul>
  <li><span class="option-title">Date/time:</span> Shut down at the selected time. If you check the
  <span class="option">Date</span> box, the shutdown will be performed only on the selected date.

  <p>Tip: If you don't use the date option and check <span class="option">Auto-reactivate last planned shutdown</span>
  in the <a href="#GeneralOptions">General options</a> tab, the shutdown will be performed every day at the selected time.</p></li>


  <li><span class="option-title">Interval:</span> Shut down when the selected interval of time has elapsed.</li>


  <li><span class="option-title">User activity:</span> Shut down when there is no user input (from the
  keyboard and/or mouse) for the selected period of time.

  <p>If the option of <span class="option">Observe system/display low power blocks</span> is checked the shut down won't
  be performed if there is any low power block set. Some applications like media players or recording software block
  the computer or the display from enter in an low power mode when they need the system in an active state
  (so it won't be put in low power while watching a video or recording a DVD, for example). It's common also having a block
  when a shared folder is opened from another computer.</p>
  </li>


  <li><span class="option-title">CPU load:</span> Shut down when the activity (load)
  of the CPU is equal or below than the selected percentage for the selected period of time. This option is intended
  for shutting down the computer after finishing a CPU-intensive task like video compression.

  <p>Note that the computer can be shut down too early if you choose a high value for CPU load or a low value for the
  period of time. The boxes will turn yellow on warning values, and will change to red on non recommended values.</p>

  <p>If you check <span class="option">Disable the screen saver while monitoring the CPU load</span> the screen saver
  will be temporarily disabled (but maintaining the monitor low power mode), as some screen savers use complex and/or 3D
  graphics and could increase a lot the CPU load.</p>

  <p>The option of <span class="option">Average CPU load</span> instructs the program to use the average CPU load of the
  last five seconds, so the inactivity counter is not reset by sporadic peaks.</p>
  </li>


  <li><span class="option-title">Network transfer:</span> Shut down when the network transfer is equal or
  below than the selected amount for the selected period of time. You can choose between three types of transfer:
  <ul>
    <li><span class="option-title">Input transfer:</span> the program monitors the data received from the net.</li>
    <li><span class="option-title">Output transfer:</span> the program monitors the data sent from the computer.</li>
    <li><span class="option-title">Combined transfer:</span> the program monitors both input and output transfer (using the sum of both values).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Also, you need to select what network adapter will be monitored, since most computers have more that one
  type of adapter available for connecting to the net (for example, modern laptops usually have a network adapter (wired),
  a wireless adapter and a Bluetooth adapter).</p>

  <p>Note that the computer can be shut down too early if you choose a high value for network transfer or a low value for
  the period of time. The boxes will turn yellow on warning values, and will change to red on non recommended values.</p>

  <p>The option of <span class="option">Average network transfer</span> instructs the program to use the average network
  transfer of the last five seconds, so the inactivity counter is not reset by sporadic peaks.</p>
  </li>

</ul>

<h4>Shutdown behaviour</h4>

<ul>
  <li><span class="option-title">Shutdown type:</span> Use this box for selecting the shutdown type that will be peformed.</li>

  <li><span class="option-title">Multi-condition behaviour:</span> When multi-condition planning is enabled, this option controls how it works:
    <ul>
      <li><span class="option-title">At least one condition must be triggered:</span> The shutdown will be performed when
      any of the selected conditions is triggered. E.g.: if you select "at 08:00 PM" and "no user activity for 15 minutes"
      with this option selected, the shutdown will be performed either at 08:00 PM or as soon as the user inactivity
      counter reaches 15 minutes, using the first condition that is triggered.</li>

      <li><span class="option-title">All the conditions must be triggered:</span> The shutdown will be performed when all
      of the selected conditions are triggered (in any order). E.g.: if you select "no network activity for (at least)
      5 minutes" and "no user activity for (at least) 15 minutes" with this option selected, the shutdown will be performed
      at the momment that both conditions are met.

      <p>Note that although each of the conditions could be triggered at different moments, all the conditions must be met
      at certain point in order to perform the shutdown. Following the previous example, if there is no user activity
      for at least 15 minutes condition two will be triggered, but if an user starts to use the computer while there is
      still network activity, the system won't be shut down until the user stops using the computer for 15 minutes, even if
      the network activity stops before that time.</p></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<a name="GeneralOptions"></a><h3>General options</h3>

  local computer will be used.
  <p>Take into account that you need to have remote shutdown privileges in the target computer:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If your network uses a workgroup you need to create in the target computer an account with the same username and
     password as the one used for the computer in which WinOFF is running (although you can use any other account for
     opening local sessions in that computer)</li>
    <li>If your network uses a domain, you need to use a domain administrator account or assign the necessary privileges
    to the account that is used for running WinOFF.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><span class="option-title">Message to user:</span> Message that will be presented

<a name="CommandLine"></a><h2>4. Command line support
&nbsp; <a title="Go to contents" href="#Contents" class="return">^</a>
</h2>


<p>AMP WinOFF supports several parameters for performing shutdowns using command line arguments, allowing to use it in
batch processing or from other programs. In this mode, the program performs the selected action immediately without
showing any cancel dialogs. The supported arguments are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>"-batch":</strong> The program shuts down the system using the shutdown type of last saved options.</li>
  <li><strong>"-poweroff":</strong> The program powers off the computer.</li>
  <li><strong>"-reboot'":</strong> The program reboots the computer.</li>
  <li><strong>"-logoff":</strong> The program closes the current session.</li>
  <li><strong>"-shutdown":</strong> Equivalent to "-poweroff" (maintained for compatibility with previous versions of the program).</li>
  <li><strong>"-adm_shutdown":</strong> The program performs an administrative shutdown.</li>
  <li><strong>"-adm_reboot'":</strong> The program performs an administrative restart.</li>
  <li><strong>"-suspend":</strong> The program suspends the computer (sleep mode).</li>
  <li><strong>"-hibernate":</strong> The program hibernates the computer.</li>
  <li><strong>"-lock":</strong> The program locks the current session (in Windows XP and later the user selection screen is shown by default).</li>
  <li><strong>"-hangup":</strong> The program hangs up the modem.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to those parameters, you can combinate them with these ones:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>"-force":</strong> The computer is forced to perform the selected shutdown type.</li>
  <li><strong>"-noforce":</strong> The selected shutdown type is performed without forcing it.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, if you wish to perform an immediate reboot and enforce it, you need to type this in the
command line:</p>

<pre>WinOFF -reboot -force</pre>

<p>You can also use the <strong>"-quiet"</strong> parameter for starting the program without showing the main window.</p>



<a name="Troubleshooting"></a><h2>5. Troubleshooting
&nbsp; <a title="Go to contents" href="#Contents" class="return">^</a>
</h2>


<ul>
  <li>The password and other settings are stored in the Windows Registry, so if you want to ensure that the
  configuration is not modified by other users you should activate the option of
  <span class="option">Use the same administrative settings for all Windows users</span> which made the program
  store the settings in the LOCAL_MACHINE section of the registry, which by default only can be modified by administrators.
  Note that in Windows Vista/7 this will cause a UAC confirmation prompt when you change any administrative setting.</li>

  <li>If you receive the error message "Unable to locate the 'Processor' performance object" when trying to use
  the CPU activity condition, that is caused by having disabled the system performance counters. You can follow the next steps
  for enabling them:
  <ul>
    <li>Download and install the
    <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=7ff99683-b7ec-4da6-92ab-793193604ba4&displaylang=en"
