<p>1   NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON:   Once there was a world    not so very different   from our own.</p>

<p>There were occasional   natural catastrophes,    massive volcanic eruptions    and, every once in a while,   an asteroid would come    barreling out of the blue   to do some damage.</p>

<p>But for the first   billion years or so,    it would've seemed   like a paradise.</p>

<p>This is what we think   the planet Venus    might have looked like when   our solar system was young.</p>

<p>Then things started   to go horribly wrong.</p>

<p>DEGRASSE TYSON:   The planet Venus,    which once   may have seemed like a heaven,    turned into a kind of hell.</p>

<p>The difference between the two   can be a delicate balance,    far more delicate   than you might imagine.</p>

<p>Once things began to unravel,   there was no way back.</p>

<p>This is what Venus,   our nearest planetary neighbor,    looks like today.</p>

<p>Venus's oceans are long gone.</p>

<p>The surface is hotter   than a broiling oven,    hot enough to melt lead.</p>

<p>Why? You might think   it's because Venus    is 30% closer to the Sun   than the Earth is,    but that's not the reason.</p>

<p>Venus is completely    covered by clouds   of sulfuric acid that keep    almost all the sunlight   from reaching the surface.</p>

<p>That ought to make Venus   much colder than the Earth.</p>

<p>So why is Venus scorching hot?    It's because   the small amount of sunlight    that trickles in through   the clouds to reach the surface    can't get back out again.</p>

<p>The flow of energy is blocked   by a dense atmosphere    of carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>That carbon dioxide gas--   or CO2 for short--    acts like a smothering blanket   to keep the heat in.</p>

<p>No one is burning coal    or driving   big gas-guzzlers on Venus.</p>

<p>Nature can destroy   an environment    without any help   from intelligent life.</p>

<p>Venus is in the grip   of a runaway greenhouse effect.</p>

<p>Why does it look like   we're inside a bowl?    It's due to the intense   atmospheric pressure.</p>

<p>That's the wreck of Venera 13.</p>

<p>In 1982, the scientists   and engineers    of what was then   the Soviet Union    successfully landed   this spacecraft on Venus.</p>

<p>They managed   to keep it refrigerated    for over two hours,    so it could photograph   its surroundings    and transmit the images   back to Earth    before the onboard electronics   were fried.</p>

<p>Venus and Earth started out   with about the same amount    of carbon, but the two worlds   were propelled    along radically different paths,    and carbon was the decisive   element in both stories.</p>

<p>On Venus, it's almost all   in the form of gas--    carbon dioxide--   in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Most of the carbon on Earth   has been stored for eons    in solid vaults   of carbonate rock,    like this one,   part of a chain that forms    the celebrated   White Cliffs of Dover,    right on the English Channel.</p>

<p>What titan built   this wonder of the world?    A creature a thousand times   smaller than a pinhead.</p>

<p>Trillions of them.</p>

<p>One-celled algae.</p>

<p>Volcanoes supply carbon dioxide   to the atmosphere,    and the oceans slowly absorb it.</p>

<p>Working over the course   of millions of years,    the microscopic algae harvested   the carbon dioxide    and turned it   into these tiny shells.</p>

<p>They accumulated   in thick deposits of chalk,    or limestone,   on the ocean floor.</p>

<p>Later, the restless Earth   pushed up the seafloor    and carved out   these massive cliffs.</p>

<p>Other marine creatures    took in carbon dioxide   to build enormous coral reefs.</p>

<p>And the oceans converted   dissolved CO2 into limestone    even without any help from life.</p>

<p>As a result, only a trace amount   was left as a gas    in Earth's atmosphere.</p>

<p>Not even three-hundredths   of one percent.</p>

<p>Think of it--   fewer than three molecules    out of every ten thousand.</p>

<p>And yet, it makes   the critical difference    between a barren wasteland   and a garden of life on Earth.</p>

<p>With no CO2 at all,    the Earth would be frozen.</p>

<p>And with twice as many,    we're still talking   about only six molecules    out of ten thousand.</p>

<p>Things would get   uncomfortably hot    and cause us   some serious problems    but never as hot as Venus;   not even close.</p>

<p>That planet lost   its ocean to space    billions of years ago.</p>

<p>Without an ocean,   it had no way to capture CO2    from the atmosphere   and store it as a mineral.</p>

<p>The CO2 from erupting volcanoes    just continued to build up.</p>

<p>Today, that atmosphere   is 90 times heavier than ours.</p>

<p>Almost all of it is   heat-trapping carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>That's why Venus is   such a ferocious inferno    so hostile to life.</p>

<p>The Earth,   in stunning contrast,    is alive.</p>

<p>It breathes    but very slowly.</p>

<p>A single breath   takes a whole year.</p>

<p>The forests contain   most of Earth's life,    and most forests   are in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>

<p>When spring comes to the north,    the forests inhale   carbon dioxide from the air    and grow,   turning the land green.</p>

<p>The amount of CO2   in the atmosphere goes down.</p>

<p>When fall comes and the plants   drop their leaves, they decay,    exhaling the carbon dioxide   back into the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The same thing happens   in the Southern Hemisphere    at the opposite time   of the year.</p>

<p>But the Southern Hemisphere   is mostly ocean.</p>

<p>So it's the forests of the north    that control the annual changes   in the global CO2.</p>

<p>The Earth has been   breathing like this    for tens of millions of years.</p>

<p>But nobody noticed until 1958,    when an oceanographer   named Charles David Keeling    devised a way   to accurately measure    the amount of carbon dioxide   in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Keeling discovered the Earth's   exquisite respiration.</p>

<p>But he also discovered   something shocking--    a rapid rise,   unprecedented in human history,    in the overall level of CO2,    one that has continued   ever since.</p>

<p>It's a striking departure from   the CO2 levels that prevailed    during the rise of agriculture   and civilization.</p>

<p>In fact, the Earth has seen   nothing like it    for three million years.</p>

<p>How can we be so sure?    The evidence is written   in water.</p>

<p>DEGRASSE TYSON: The Earth keeps   a detailed diary    written in the snows   of yesteryear.</p>

<p>Climate scientists   have drilled ice cores    from the depths of glaciers   in Greenland and Antarctica.</p>

<p>The ice layers have ancient air   trapped inside them.</p>

<p>We can read the unbroken record   of Earth's atmosphere    that extends back over   the last 800,000 years.</p>

<p>In all that time,    the amount of carbon dioxide   in the air never rose    above three-hundredths   of one percent.</p>

<p>That is, until the turn   of the 20th century.</p>

<p>And it's been going up steadily   and rapidly ever since.</p>

<p>It's now more than 40% higher    than before   the Industrial Revolution.</p>

<p>By burning coal, oil and gas,    our civilization   is exhaling carbon dioxide    much faster   than Earth can absorb it.</p>

<p>So CO2 is building up   in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The planet is heating up.</p>

<p>Every warm object radiates   a kind of light    we can't see   with the naked eye--    thermal infrared light.</p>

<p>We all glow with invisible heat   radiation, even in the dark.</p>

<p>This is what the Earth   looks like in the infrared.</p>

<p>You're seeing the planet's   own body heat.</p>

<p>Incoming light   from the Sun hits the surface.</p>

<p>The Earth absorbs much   of that energy,    which heats the planet up    and makes the surface glow   in infrared light.</p>

<p>But the carbon dioxide   in the atmosphere    absorbs most of that outgoing   heat radiation,    sending much of it   right back to the surface.</p>

<p>This makes the planet   even warmer.</p>

<p>That's all there is   to the greenhouse effect.</p>

<p>It's basic physics,    just bookkeeping   of the energy flow.</p>

<p>There's nothing   controversial about it.</p>

<p>If we didn't have any carbon   dioxide in our atmosphere,    the Earth would just be   a great big snowball,    and we wouldn't be here.</p>

<p>So, a little greenhouse effect   is a good thing.</p>

<p>But a big one can destabilize   the climate    and wreck our way of life.</p>

<p>All right but how do we know   that we're the problem?    Maybe the Earth itself is   causing the rise in CO2.</p>

<p>Maybe it has nothing to do   with the coal and oil we burn.</p>

<p>Maybe it's those   damn volcanoes.</p>

<p>(deep rumbling)    Every few years, Mount Etna,   in Sicily, blows its stack.</p>

<p>Each big eruption sends millions   of tons of CO2    into the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Now, combine that   with the output    of all the other volcanic   activity on the planet.</p>

<p>Let's take the largest   scientific estimate--    about 500 million tons   of volcanic CO2    entering the atmosphere   ever year.</p>

<p>Sounds like a lot, right?    But that's not even two percent   of the 30 billion tons of CO2    that our civilization   is cranking out every year.</p>

<p>And, funny thing,    the measured increase in CO2   in the atmosphere    tallies with the known amount   we're dumping there    by burning coal, oil and gas.</p>

<p>Volcanic CO2 has   a distinct signature--    it's slightly heavier   than the kind produced    by burning fossil fuels.</p>

<p>We can tell the difference   between the two    when we examine them   at the atomic level.</p>

<p>It's clear that   the increased CO2 in the air    is not from volcanoes.</p>

<p>What's more, the observed   warming is as much as predicted    from the measured increase   in carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>It's a pretty tight case.</p>

<p>Our fingerprints   are all over this one.</p>

<p>How much is 30 billion tons   of CO2 per year?    If you compressed it   into solid form,    it would occupy   about the same volume    as the White Cliffs of Dover.</p>

<p>And we're adding that much CO2   to the air every year,    relentlessly, year after year.</p>

<p>Unlucky for us,   the main waste product    of our civilization   is not just any substance.</p>

<p>It happens to be the chief   climate-regulating gas    of our global thermostat,   year in, year out.</p>

<p>Too bad CO2 is an invisible gas.</p>

<p>Maybe if we could see it    (car engine starts)    If our eyes were sensitive   to CO2--    and perhaps there are   such beings in the cosmos--    if we could see all   that carbon dioxide,    then we would overcome   the denial    and grasp the magnitude of   our impact on the atmosphere.</p>

<p>But the evidence   that the world is getting warmer    is all around us.</p>

<p>For starters, let's just   check the thermometers.</p>

<p>Weather stations   around the world    have been keeping   reliable temperature records    since the 1880s,    and NASA has used the data   to compile a map    tracking   the average temperatures    around the world through time.</p>

<p>Yellow means   warmer temperatures    than the average,   for any region in the 1880s.</p>

<p>Orange means hot.</p>

<p>And red means hotter.</p>

<p>The world is warmer than it was   in the 19th century.</p>

<p>Back then, at the greatest fair   the world has ever seen,    a forgotten genius demonstrated   the solution to this problem.</p>

<p>Come with me.</p>

<p>DEGRASSE TYSON:   Once there was a world    that was not too hot   and not too cold.</p>

<p>It was just right.</p>

<p>Then there came a time   when the life it sustained    began to notice   our lovely planet was changing.</p>

<p>And it's not   as if we didn't see it coming.</p>

<p>As far back as 1896,    the Swedish scientist   Svante Arrhenius    calculated   that doubling the amount    of CO2 in the atmosphere   would melt the Arctic ice.</p>

<p>In the 1930s, the American   physicist EO Hulburt,    at the Naval   Research Laboratory,    confirmed that result.</p>

<p>So far, it was still   just theoretical.</p>

<p>But then, the English engineer   Guy Callendar    assembled the evidence to show    that both the CO2 and   the average global temperature    were actually increasing.</p>

<p>Even now, man may be unwittingly   changing the world's climate    through the waste products   of his civilization.</p>

<p>Due to our release,   through factories    and automobiles every year,   of more than    six billion tons   of carbon dioxide,    which helps air absorb heat   from the Sun,    our atmosphere seems   to be getting warmer.</p>

<p>This is bad?    Well, it's been calculated,   a few degrees rise    in the Earth's temperature    would melt the polar ice caps.</p>

<p>DEGRASSE TYSON: In 1960,   Carl Sagan's PhD thesis    included the first calculation    of the runaway   greenhouse effect on Venus.</p>

<p>This was part   of a career-long interest    in the atmospheres of   the planets, including our own.</p>

<p>In the original Cosmos series,   in 1980, Carl Sagan warned    SAGAN: We are releasing vast   quantities of carbon dioxide,    increasing   the greenhouse effect.</p>

<p>It may not take much    to destabilize   the Earth's climate,    to convert this heaven,   our only home in the cosmos,    into a kind of hell.</p>

<p>Since Carl spoke those words,    we've burdened the atmosphere   of our world with an additional    of carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>If we don't change our ways,    what will the planet be like   in our children's future?    Based on scientific   projections,    if we just keep   on doing business as usual,    our kids are in   for a rough ride.</p>

<p>Killer heat waves,   record droughts,    rising sea levels,   mass extinction of species.</p>

<p>We inherited a bountiful world    made possible   by a relatively stable climate.</p>

<p>Agriculture   and civilization flourished    for thousands of years.</p>

<p>And now, our carelessness and   greed put all of that at risk.</p>

<p>Okay, so if we scientists   are so good    at making these dire, long-term   predictions about the climate,    how come we're so lousy   about predicting the weather?    Besides, this year, we had   a colder winter in my town.</p>

<p>For all us scientists know,    we could be in   for global cooling.</p>

<p>Here's the difference   between weather and climate    Weather is what the atmosphere   does in the short term--    hour to hour, day to day.</p>

<p>Weather is chaotic,   which means that even    a microscopic disturbance can   lead to large-scale changes.</p>

<p>That's why those ten-day   weather forecasts are useless.</p>

<p>A butterfly flaps its wings   in Bali, and six weeks later,    your outdoor wedding   in Maine is ruined.</p>

<p>Climate is the long-term average    of the weather,   over a number of years.</p>

<p>It's shaped by global forces   that alter the energy balance    in the atmosphere,   such as changes in the Sun,    the tilt of the Earth's axis,    the amount of sunlight   the Earth reflects back to space    and the concentration   of greenhouse gases in the air.</p>

<p>A change in any of them   affects the climate    in ways   that are broadly predictable.</p>

<p>My friend's meandering    represents   the short-term fluctuations--    that's weather.</p>

<p>It's almost impossible   to predict    what'll attract   his interest next,    but not hard to know what the   range of his meandering will be,    because I'm holding him   on a leash.</p>

<p>We can't   observe climate directly--    all we see is the weather--    but the average weather,   over the course of years,    reveals a pattern.</p>

<p>I represent   that long-term trend,    which is climate.</p>

<p>Keep your eye on the man,   not the dog.</p>

<p>Weather is hard to predict,   like my friend here,    but climate is predictable.</p>

<p>Climate has changed many times   in the long history of the Earth    but always in response   to a global force.</p>

<p>The strongest force driving   climate change right now    is the increasing CO2 from   the burning of fossil fuels,    which is trapping more heat   from the Sun.</p>

<p>All that additional energy   has to go somewhere.</p>

<p>Some of it warms the air.</p>

<p>Most of it ends up   in the oceans.</p>

<p>All over the world,   the oceans are getting warmer.</p>

<p>It's most obvious   in the Arctic Ocean    and the lands that surround it.</p>

<p>Okay, so we're losing   the summer sea ice    in a place   where hardly anyone ever goes.</p>

<p>What do I care if there's   no ice around the North Pole?    Ice is the brightest   natural surface on the Earth,    and open ocean water   is the darkest.</p>

<p>Ice reflects incoming sunlight   back to space.</p>

<p>Water absorbs sunlight    and gets warmer,   which melts even more ice,    which exposes   still more ocean surface    to absorb even more sunlight.</p>

<p>This is what we call   a positive feedback loop.</p>

<p>It's one of many natural   mechanisms that magnify    any warming caused   by CO2 alone.</p>

<p>We're at Drew Point, Alaska,    on the edge of the Arctic Ocean.</p>

<p>DEGRASSE TYSON: When I was born, the   shoreline was a mile farther out,    and it was breaking off at a   rate of about 20 feet per year.</p>

<p>Now    it's being eaten away   at about 50 feet per year.</p>

<p>The Arctic Ocean is warming    and at an increasing rate.</p>

<p>So it's ice-free   during more of the year.</p>

<p>That leaves the shore here    more exposed to erosion   from storms,    which are also getting   more powerful,    another effect   of climate change.</p>

<p>The northern reaches of Alaska,   Siberia and Canada    are mostly permafrost,    ground that has been frozen   year-round for millennia.</p>

<p>It contains lots   of organic matter,    old leaves and roots   from plants    that grew thousands   of years ago.</p>

<p>Because the Arctic regions   are warming faster    than anywhere else on Earth,    the permafrost is thawing    and its contents are rotting,    just like when you unplug   the freezer.</p>

<p>The thawing permafrost   is releasing carbon dioxide    and methane, an even more   potent greenhouse gas,    into the atmosphere.</p>

<p>This is making things   even warmer,    another example of a positive   feedback mechanism.</p>

<p>The world's permafrost stores   enough carbon    to more than double the CO2   in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>At the rate we're going,    global warming   could release most of it    by the end of the century.</p>

<p>We might be tipping the climate   past a point of no return    into an unpredictable slide.</p>

<p>Okay, the air, the water    and the land   are all getting warmer,    so global warming   is really happening.</p>

<p>But maybe it's not our fault.</p>

<p>Maybe it's just nature.</p>

<p>Maybe it's the Sun.</p>

<p>No, it's not the Sun.</p>

<p>We've been monitoring the Sun   very closely for decades,    and the solar energy output   hasn't changed.</p>

<p>What's more, the Earth   is warming more at night    than in daytime,    and more in winter   than in summer.</p>

<p>That's exactly what we expect   from greenhouse warming,    but the opposite of what   increased solar output    would cause.</p>

<p>It's now clear beyond   any reasonable doubt    that we are changing   the climate.</p>

<p>The Sun isn't the problem.</p>

<p>But it is the solution,    and we've known this   for a long time,    much longer   than you might think.</p>

<p>Paris, September 1878.</p>

<p>The Eiffel Tower won't be built   for years to come.</p>

<p>Witness one   of the most glorious spectacles    the world has ever seen.</p>

<p>The magnificent head   of the Statue of Liberty    has just been completed.</p>

<p>Thousands of exhibitors   from around the planet    covered 66 acres of Paris    with their inventions   and goods.</p>

<p>Edison's first public   demonstration of the lightbulb    will not take place   for another year.</p>

<p>There's no such thing   as electrical appliances.</p>

<p>People don't flick switches   and press buttons.</p>

<p>It's a hand-cranked,   horse-drawn world.</p>

<p>That's the guy we came to see,    the one   with the crazy moustache.</p>

<p>He's a math teacher   named Augustin Mouchot.</p>

<p>Remember, it's 1878.</p>

<p>This is a world   lit mostly by gaslight.</p>

<p>The automobile   is still years away.</p>

<p>But Mouchot, here,   is dazzling the crowd    with his solar power   concentrator.</p>

<p>The Sun belongs to all of us!    Even though it is 150 million   kilometers away from us,    feel its awesome power!    My invention concentrates   the free energy of the Sun    and converts it   into mechanical motion.</p>

<p>It can power any kind   of machine.</p>

<p>It can produce electricity   or run a printing press    or make ice on a hot day.</p>

<p>Et voilÃ  !    (spectators gasp, chatter)    (chuckles)    Think of it,    sunlight converted into ice.</p>

<p>You see, my friends,   what wonders we can work    if we harness   the bounteous energy of the Sun.</p>

<p>The world will someday   run out of coal,    but the magnificent Sun   will always be there for us.</p>

<p>Mouchot took home the gold medal   from the fair.</p>

<p>But the price of coal tumbled,    becoming so cheap that there was   no interest in solar energy.</p>

<p>Besides,   no one understood, back then,    what the true cost was   of burning fossil fuel.</p>

<p>Mouchot's research funding   was cut off.</p>

<p>years of the 20th century,    another door opened   to an alternative future.</p>

<p>It happened in Egypt,   on the banks of the Nile.</p>

<p>DEGRASSE TYSON:   Memo to future time travelers    this would be   an excellent entry point    for averting climate change.</p>

<p>Egypt, 1913.</p>

<p>That's Frank Shuman   of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>He's only had   three years of schooling,    but his genius for innovation   more than makes up for that.</p>

<p>Before he was 30, Shuman   had invented safety glass.</p>

<p>Its use in automobiles and   skylights saved countless lives    and made him a very rich man,    rich enough   to pursue his real passion,    solar energy.</p>

<p>Shuman led the team   that designed and built    an array   of solar energy concentrators.</p>

<p>It could power a steam engine.</p>

<p>Shuman is hoping   to use the Sun's power    to irrigate the desert    and turn it green.</p>

<p>The official inauguration    of Shuman's solar power plant,   in 1913,    was a dazzling success.</p>

<p>He had invented a practical way   to tap the Sun's energy    on an industrial scale,    making solar energy   even cheaper than coal.</p>

<p>The British   and German governments    both offered Shuman   generous funding    to develop his invention.</p>

<p>It was the ideal source   of abundant power    in tropical regions,    where imported coal   was prohibitively expensive.</p>

<p>But Shuman was dreaming   even bigger.</p>

<p>In a letter   to Scientific American,    he calculated   that his solar power plants,    if deployed in an area   of the Sahara Desert    only 150 miles on a side,   could supply as much power    as consumed by all   the industries of the world.</p>

<p>But it was not to be.</p>

<p>The market for a liquid   fossil fuel, petroleum,    was exploding for shipping,    home heating,   and cars and trucks.</p>

<p>Oil was abundant,   cheaper even than coal,    and much easier to get   out of the ground and process.</p>

<p>It took 100 men a week   to fuel a ship with coal,    but with oil,   one man could do the job    in a single day.</p>

<p>A year after Shuman's   triumph in the desert,    World War I broke out.</p>

<p>His solar collectors   were recycled into weapons.</p>

<p>Frank Shuman's dream   of a solar-powered civilization    would have to wait   another century    before it was reborn.</p>

<p>There's another inexhaustible   source of clean energy    for the world.</p>

<p>The winds themselves   are solar powered,    because our star drives   the winds and the waves.</p>

<p>Unlike solar collectors,    wind farms take up   very little land,    and none at all, if offshore,    where the winds are strongest.</p>

<p>If we could tap even   one percent of their power,    we'd have enough energy   to run our civilization.</p>

<p>And more solar energy   falls on Earth in one hour    than all the energy   our civilization consumes    in an entire year.</p>

<p>If we could harness   a tiny fraction    of the available   solar and wind power,    we could supply   all our energy needs forever,    and without adding   any carbon to the atmosphere.</p>

<p>It's not too late.</p>

<p>There's a future   worth fighting for.</p>

<p>How do I know?    Every one of us comes   from a long line of survivors.</p>

<p>Our species is nothing   if not adaptive.</p>

<p>It was only because   our ancestors learned    to think long-term,   and act accordingly,    that we're here at all.</p>

<p>We've had our backs   to the wall before,    and we came through   to scale new heights.</p>

<p>In fact, the most mythic   human accomplishments of all    came out of our darkest hour.</p>

<p>DEGRASSE TYSON:   Once there was a world    rigged with 60,000   hair-triggered nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>The combatants were    the two most powerful   countries on Earth,    and they were locked   in a deadly embrace,    each vowing that   they would rather see    everything we love destroyed    than submit   to the will of the other.</p>

<p>When I was three years old,    the largest man-made   explosion of all time    was detonated   by the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>That terror has subsided,   to be replaced by new fears.</p>

<p>The danger that the 2,000   largest cities on Earth    would be reduced to rubble   in the space of an afternoon    is no longer one of them.</p>

<p>The nuclear rivalry   between the United States    and the Soviet Union    had another by-product.</p>

<p>The Apollo missions to the Moon   were an extension    of the arms race   that raged between them.</p>

<p>Sending people   to orbit the Earth    or go to the Moon   requires big, reliable,    powerful rockets--   precisely the same technology    you need to carry   a nuclear warhead    halfway around the planet    to destroy your enemy's   largest cities.</p>

<p>PRESIDENT KENNEDY:   I believe that this nation    should commit itself   to achieving the goal,    before this decade is out,   of landing a man on the Moon    and returning him safely   to the Earth.</p>

<p>DEGRASSE TYSON:   President Kennedy's 1961 speech    electrified the nation,    and it contained much   that was remarkably prophetic--    but not a word about   a scientific objective    for going to the Moon.</p>

<p>No questions   about the Moon's origin    or the hope of bringing back   samples to analyze.</p>

<p>No, the Apollo missions   were conceived    as a demonstration   of the superior power    and precision   of our strategic missiles.</p>

<p>But a funny thing   happened to us    on our way to the Moon.</p>

<p>We looked homeward    and discovered another world--    our own.</p>

<p>For the first time,   we inhabitants of Earth    could step back   and see it as it really is--    one world, indivisible,    and kind of small   in the cosmic context.</p>

<p>Whatever the reason we first   mustered the enormous resources    required   for the Apollo program,    however mired it was   in Cold War nationalism    and the instruments of death,    the inescapable recognition   of the unity    and fragility of the Earth    is its clear   and luminous dividend,    the unexpected gift of Apollo.</p>

<p>A project conceived   in deadly competition    made us recognize   our community.</p>

<p>What titan built   this wonder of the world?    It was the Ifugao people   of the Philippines,    working with not much more   than their hands.</p>

<p>About 10,000 years ago,   our ancestors all over the world    took advantage of another form   of climate change,    the gentler climate of the   intermission in the ice age--    they invented agriculture.</p>

<p>They gave up   the ceaseless wandering,    hunting and gathering   that had been their way of life    for a million years or so,    to settle down and produce food.</p>

<p>They found a way to harvest    ten to a hundred times   more solar energy    than the environment naturally   provided for their ancestors.</p>

<p>People all over the world   made the difficult transition    from nomadic cultures   to agricultural ones    that used solar energy   more efficiently.</p>

<p>It gave rise to civilization.</p>

<p>We stand on the shoulders   of those who did the hard work    that such a fundamental   transformation required.</p>

<p>Now it's our turn.</p>

<p>Once there was a world    If life ever existed on Venus,   it would have had no chance    to avert the hellish destiny   of this world.</p>

<p>This runaway greenhouse effect   was unstoppable.</p>

<p>(thunder crashing)    Once    there was a world    ours.</p>

<p>And that world is now.</p>

<p>There are no scientific   or technological obstacles    to protecting our world    and the precious life   that it supports.</p>

<p>It all depends    on what we truly value    and if we can summon   the will to act.</p>

<p>PRESIDENT KENNEDY:   But why, some say, the Moon?    Why choose this as our goal?    And they may well ask,    why climb the highest mountain?    We choose to go to the Moon    we choose to go to the Moon    (applause, cheering)    we choose to go to the Moon   in this decade    and do the other things,    not because they are easy,   but because they are hard.</p>
