<p>The idea that species gradually change over many generations is the cornerstone of biology. This is how we know it's true.</p>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>By Chris Baraniuk</li>
  </ul>
  30 July 2015 </div>
<div>
  <p>Evolution is one of the greatest theories   in all of science. It sets out to explain life: specifically, how the   first simple life gave rise to all the huge diversity we see today, from   bacteria to oak trees to blue whales.</p>
  <p>For scientists, evolution   is a fact. We know that life evolved with the same certainty that we   know the Earth is roughly spherical, that gravity keeps us on it, and   that wasps at a picnic are annoying.</p>
  <p>Not that you would know that   from the media in some countries, where evolution is ferociously argued   about – put down as &quot;just a theory&quot; or dismissed as a flat-out lie.</p>
  <p>Why   are biologists so certain about this? What is the evidence? The short   answer is that there is so much it's hard to know where to start. But   here is a very cursory summary of the evidence that life has, indeed,   evolved.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>It might help to first spell out quickly what   Darwin's theory of evolution actually says. Most of us have the general   idea: species change over time, only the fittest survive, and somehow a   monkey-like creature gave rise to human beings.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> It is hard to accept that you are descended, through countless generations, from a worm </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Darwin's   theory of evolution says that each new organism is subtly different   from its parents, and these differences can sometimes help the offspring   or impede it. As organisms compete for food and mates, those with the   advantageous traits produce more offspring, while those with unhelpful   traits may not produce any. So within a given population, advantageous   traits become common and unhelpful ones disappear.</p>
  <p>Given enough   time, these changes mount up and lead to the appearance of new species   and new types of organism, one small change at a time. Step by step,   worms became fish, fish came onto land and developed four legs, those   four-legged animals grew hair and – eventually – some of them started   walking around on two legs, called themselves &quot;humans&quot; and discovered   evolution.</p>
  <p>This can be hard to believe. It's one thing to realise   that you are not identical to our parents: perhaps your hair is a   different colour, or you are taller, or have a more cheerful nature. But   it is much harder to accept that you are descended, through countless   generations, from a worm.</p>
  <p>Plenty of people certainly don't accept   this. But forget all the drama for a moment. Instead, begin as Charles   Darwin did: on your doorstep.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>Darwin's book <a href="http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1"><em>On the Origin of Species</em></a>,   first published in 1859, begins by asking the reader to look around at   the familiar. Not unexplored tropical islands or faraway jungles, but   the farmyard and garden. There, you can easily see that organisms pass   on characteristics to their offspring, changing the nature of that   organism over time.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> These changes from generation to generation are called &quot;descent with modification&quot; </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Darwin   was highlighting the process of cultivation and breeding. For   generations, farmers and gardeners have purposefully bred animals to be   bigger or stronger, and plants to yield more crops.</p>
  <p>Breeders work   just like Darwin imagined evolution worked. Suppose you want to breed   chickens that lay more eggs. First you must find those hens that lay   more eggs than the others. Then you must hatch their eggs, and ensure   that the resulting chicks reproduce. These chicks should also lay more   eggs.</p>
  <p>If you repeat the process with each generation, eventually   you'll have hens that lay far more eggs than wild chickens do. A female   jungle fowl – the closest wild relative of the domestic chicken – might   lay 30 eggs in a year, whereas farm hens may well produce ten times as   many.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>These changes from generation to generation are called &quot;descent with modification&quot;.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Our oldest domesticated animals are still capable of rapid improvement or modification </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>A   young chick will in many ways be similar to its parents: it will be   recognisably a chicken, and definitely not an aardvark, and it will   probably be more similar to its parents than it is to other chickens.   But it won't be identical.</p>
  <p>&quot;That's what evolution is,&quot; says <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gee/gee-staff/academic-staff/steve-jones">Steve Jones</a> of University College London in the UK. &quot;It's a series of mistakes that build up.&quot;</p>
  <p>You   might think that breeding can only make a few changes, but there seems   to be no end to it. &quot;No case is on record of a variable being ceasing to   be variable under cultivation,&quot; wrote Darwin. &quot;Our oldest cultivated   plants, such as wheat, still often yield new varieties: our oldest   domesticated animals are still capable of rapid improvement or   modification.&quot;</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>Breeding, Darwin argued, is essentially evolution   under human supervision. It shows us that the tiny changes from   generation to generation can add up. &quot;It's inevitable,&quot; says Jones.   &quot;It's bound to happen.&quot;</p>
  <p>Still, it's quite a step from carefully   breeding chickens that lay more eggs to the natural evolution of new   species. According to evolutionary theory, those chickens are ultimately   descended from dinosaurs, and if you go further back, from fish.</p>
  <p>The   answer is simply that evolution takes a long time to make big changes.   To see evidence of that, you have to look at older records. You have to   look at fossils.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>Fossils are the remains of long-dead organisms,   preserved in rock. Because rocks are laid down in layers, one on top of   the other, the fossil record is generally set out in date order: the   oldest fossils are at the bottom.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> I always think that the most convincing case for evolution is in the fossil record </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Running through the fossil record makes it clear that life has changed over time.</p>
  <p>The   oldest fossils of all are the remains of single-celled organisms like   bacteria, with more complicated things like animals and plants only   appearing much later. Among the animal fossils, fish appear much earlier   than amphibians, birds or mammals. Our closest relatives the apes are   only found in the shallowest – youngest – rocks.</p>
  <p>&quot;I always think   that the most convincing case for evolution is in the fossil record,&quot;   says Jones. &quot;It's noticeable that one page in every six in the <em>Origin of Species</em> is to do with the fossil record. [Darwin] knew that that was an irrefutable case that evolution had taken place.&quot;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> How do we really know that one species evolved into another? </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>By   carefully studying fossils, scientists have been able to link many   extinct species with ones that survive today, sometimes indicating that   one descended from another.</p>
  <p>For example, in 2014 <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02724634.2013.793195">researchers described the fossils of a 55-million year old carnivore called <em>Dormaalocyon</em></a>, which may be a common ancestor of all today's lions, tigers and bears. The shapes of <em>Dormaalocyon</em>'s teeth gave it away.</p>
  <p>Still, you may not be convinced. Those animals may all have similar teeth, but lions, tigers and <em>Dormaalocyons</em> are still distinct species. How do we really know that one species evolved into another?</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>The fossil record is only so much help here, because   it is incomplete. &quot;If you look at most fossil records, what you   actually see is one form that lasts quite a long time and then the next   bunch of fossils that you've got is quite different from what you had   before,&quot; says Jones.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> It is also possible to observe the evolution of a new species as it happens </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>But as we have dug up more and more remains, a wealth of &quot;<a href="http://www.transitionalfossils.com">transitional fossils</a>&quot; has been discovered. These &quot;missing links&quot; are halfway houses between familiar species.</p>
  <p>For   instance, earlier we said that chickens are ultimately descended from   dinosaurs. In 2000 a team led by Xing Xu of the Chinese Academy of   Sciences described <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/35047056">a small dinosaur called <em>Microraptor</em></a>, which had feathers similar to modern birds and may have been able to fly.</p>
  <p>It is also possible to observe the evolution of a new species as it happens.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>In 2009, <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/eeb/people/display_person.xml?netid=rgrant">Peter and Rosemary Grant</a> of Princeton University in New Jersey described how <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0911761106">a new species of finch came into being on one of the Galápagos Islands</a>: the same islands visited by Darwin.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> This little group of birds had formed a new species </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In   1981, a single medium ground finch arrived on an island called Daphne   Major. He was unusually large and sang a somewhat different song to the   local birds.</p>
  <p>He managed to breed, and his offspring inherited his   unusual traits. After a few generations, they were reproductively   isolated: they looked different from the other birds, and sang different   songs, so could only breed among themselves. This little group of birds   had formed a new species: they had &quot;speciated&quot;.</p>
  <p>This new species   is only subtly different from its forebears: their beaks are different   and they sing an unusual song. But it is possible to watch far more   dramatic changes as they happen.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p><a href="http://myxo.css.msu.edu/">Richard Lenski</a> of Michigan State University is in charge of the world's longest-running evolution experiment.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> It's a very direct demonstration of Darwin's idea of adaptation by natural selection </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Since 1988, Lenski has been tracking 12 populations of <em>Escherichia coli</em> bacteria in his lab. The bacteria are left to their own devices in storage containers, with nutrients to feed on, and <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn27760-cradle-of-creation-evolution-shapes-up-new-ecosystem-in-the-lab">Lenski's team regularly freezes small samples</a>.</p>
  <p>The <em>E. coli</em> are no longer the same as they were in 1988. &quot;In all 12 populations,   the bacteria have evolved to grow much faster than did their ancestor,&quot;   says Lenski. They have adapted to the specific mix of chemicals he gives   them.</p>
  <p>&quot;It's a very direct demonstration of Darwin's idea of   adaptation by natural selection. Now, 20-some years into the experiment,   the typical lineage grows about 80% faster than did the ancestor.&quot;</p>
  <p>In   2008, Lenski's team reported that the bacteria had made a huge leap   forward. The mixture they live in includes a chemical called citrate,   which <em>E. coli</em> cannot digest. But 31,500 generations into the experiment, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0803151105">one of the 12 populations started feeding on citrate</a>. This would be like humans suddenly developing the ability to eat tree bark.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> All living things carry genes, in the form of DNA </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The   citrate was always there, says Lenski, &quot;so all of the populations have   [had] the opportunity in a sense to evolve the ability to use this...   But only one of the 12 populations has found their way to do this.&quot;</p>
  <p>At   this point, Lenski's habit of regularly freezing samples of the   bacteria proved crucial. He was able to go back through older samples,   and trace the changes that led to the <em>E. coli</em> eating citrate.</p>
  <p>To   do this, he had to look under the hood. He used a tool that wasn't   available in Darwin's day, but which has revolutionised our   understanding of evolution as a whole: genetics.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>All living things carry genes, in the form of DNA.</p>
  <p>Genes   control how an organism grows and develops, and they are passed on from   parent to offspring. When a mother chicken lays lots of eggs, and   passes that trait onto her offspring, she does so through her genes.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> All modern life has descended from a single common ancestor </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Over   the last century scientists have catalogued the genes from different   species. It turns out that all living things store information in their   DNA in the same way: they all use the same &quot;genetic code&quot;.</p>
  <p>What's more, organisms also share many genes. Thousands of genes found in human DNA <a href="http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/%5bhttp:/ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/07/125-explore/shared-genes">may also be found in the DNA of other creatures</a>, including plants and even bacteria.</p>
  <p>These   two facts imply that all modern life has descended from a single common   ancestor, the &quot;last universal ancestor&quot;, which lived billions of years   ago.</p>
  <p>By comparing how many genes organisms share, we can figure   out how they are related. For instance, humans share more genes with   apes like chimps and gorillas than other animals, as much as 96%. That   suggests they are our closest relatives.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> We have a common ancestor with chimpanzees </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Try   to explain that in any other way than the fact that those relationships   are based on a sequence of changes through time,&quot; says <a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/departments-and-staff/staff-directory/chris-stringer.html">Chris Stringer</a> of the Natural History Museum in London. &quot;We have a common ancestor   with chimpanzees, and we and they have diverged since then from that   common ancestor.&quot;</p>
  <p>We can also use genetics to track the detail of evolutionary changes.</p>
  <p>&quot;You can compare different types of bacteria and find the genes that they share,&quot; says <a href="http://web.biosci.utexas.edu/moran/">Nancy Moran</a> at the University of Texas at Austin. &quot;Once you recognise these genes…   you can look at how they have evolved in different kinds of   populations.&quot;</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>When Lenski went back through his <em>E. coli</em> samples, he found that the citrate-eating bacteria had several changes   to their DNA that the other bacteria didn't. These changes are called   mutations.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Lenski's E. coli show us that evolution can give organisms radically new abilities </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Some   of them had happened long before the bacteria developed their new   ability. &quot;In and of themselves, [these mutations] did not confer the   ability to grow on citrate, but set the stage for subsequent mutations   that then conferred that ability,&quot; says Lenski.</p>
  <p>This complex chain of events helps explain why only one population evolved the ability.</p>
  <p>It   also illustrates an important point about evolution. A particular   evolutionary step may seem extremely unlikely, but if there are enough   organisms being pushed to take it, one of them probably will – and it   only takes one.</p>
  <p>Lenski's <em>E. coli</em> show us that evolution   can give organisms radically new abilities. But evolution doesn't always   make things better. Its effects are often, to our eyes at least, rather   random.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>The mutations that lead to changes in an organism   are very rarely for the better, says Moran. In fact, most mutations have   either no impact, or a negative impact, on the way an organism   functions.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Animals that live in dark caves often lose their eyes </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>When   bacteria are confined to isolated environments, they sometimes pick up   unwelcome genetic mutations that get passed on directly to every   generation. Over time, this gradually hampers the species.</p>
  <p>&quot;It   really shows the process of evolution,&quot; says Moran. &quot;It's not all just   adaptation and things getting better, there's also this big potential   for things to get worse.&quot;</p>
  <p>What's more, organisms sometimes lose abilities. For instance, animals that live in dark caves often lose their eyes.</p>
  <p>This   may seem odd. We tend to think of evolution as a process of biological   betterment, of species improving and becoming less primitive. But this   is not necessarily what happens.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>The notion of betterment can be traced back to a   scientist named Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who was pushing the idea that   organisms evolve before Darwin was. His contributions were vital.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> What did he mean they wanted to improve? How would you test that? </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>But   unlike Darwin, Lamarck thought that organisms got better at living in   their environments as a deliberate reaction to those environments, as   though they inherently wanted to improve.</p>
  <p>Lamarck's theory would   say that giraffes have long necks because their ancestors stretched to   reach tall trees, and then passed their newly-acquired long necks on to   their offspring.</p>
  <p>&quot;Darwin wrote about Lamarck privately and said   his theory is complete nonsense, it's untestable,&quot; says Jones. &quot;What did   he mean they wanted to improve? How would you test that?&quot;</p>
  <p>Darwin had an alternative theory: natural selection. It offers a completely different explanation for giraffes' long necks.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>Imagine an ancestor of modern giraffes, something a   bit like a deer or antelope. If there were lots of tall trees where this   animal lived, the animals with the longest necks would get more food,   and do better than those with shorter necks.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Animals like giraffes are so striking because they appear so perfectly adapted </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>After   a few generations, all the animals would have slightly longer necks   than their ancestors did. Again, those with the longest would do best,   so over many years, giraffes' necks would gradually get longer, because   those with short necks tended not to have offspring.</p>
  <p>The mutations   underlying this all happened at random, and were just as likely to   produce short necks as long ones. But those short-neck mutations didn't   tend to last.</p>
  <p>Animals like giraffes are so striking because they   appear so perfectly adapted. They live in areas where the trees are tall   and only have leaves high off the ground, so of course they have long   necks to reach them.</p>
  <p>&quot;That kind of image is actually what confuses   people, I think, because it looks so perfect, it looks designed,&quot; says   Moran. But if you look closer, it is the result of a long chain of   little changes. &quot;You realise, oh, it's not designed, it's actually one   odd event that might have spread and led to another odd event.&quot;</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>We now have all the pieces of evidence that, when put together, show that life has evolved.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Human evolution has always been a concept difficult for some to stomach </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Descent   with modification, which is caused by random mutations in genes,   ultimately leads to gradual changes and the formation of new species –   much of it driven by natural selection, which weeds out those organisms   that are less suited to their environments.</p>
  <p>Finally, let's apply all this to ourselves.</p>
  <p>Human   evolution has always been a concept difficult for some to stomach, but   it's impossible to turn a blind eye to it now, says Stringer.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p><em>Homo sapiens</em> is believed to have evolved in Africa before spreading all over the world.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> People of European and Asian descent carry Neanderthal genes in their DNA </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The   fossil record shows a gradual change from ape-like animals walking on   all fours to bipedal creatures that gradually developed bigger brains.</p>
  <p>The   first humans to leave Africa interbred with other hominin species, such   as the Neanderthals. As a result, people of European and Asian descent   carry Neanderthal genes in their DNA, but people of African descent   don't.</p>
  <p>This all happened thousands of years ago, but the story is not over. We are still evolving.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>For instance, in the 1950s a British doctor called   Anthony Allison was studying a genetic disorder called sickle-cell   anaemia, which is common in some African populations. People with the   disorder have misshapen red blood cells, which don't carry oxygen around   the body as well as they might.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> For those people, it was worth carrying the sickle-cell mutation </p>

  <p>Allison   discovered that the east African populations were divided into groups   of lowland-dwelling people, who were prone to the disease, and people   who lived in the highlands, who were not.</p>
  <p>It turned out that people carrying the sickle-cell trait got an unexpected benefit. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature.2011.9342">It protected them from malaria</a>,   which was only really a threat in the lowlands. For those people, it   was worth carrying the sickle-cell mutation, even if their children   might be anaemic.</p>
  <p>By contrast, people living in highland areas   were not at risk from malaria. That meant there was no advantage to   carrying the sickle-cell trait, so its otherwise-harmful nature had   meant it disappeared.</p>

  <p>Of course, there are all sorts of questions about evolution that we still haven't answered.</p>

  <p>Stringer   offers a simple one: what was the genetic change that allowed humans to   walk upright, and why was that mutation so successful? Right now we   don't know, but with more fossils and better genetics, we might someday.</p>
  <p>What we do know is that evolution is a fact of nature. It is the basis for life on Earth as we know it.</p>
  <p>So   next time you're out and about, whether it's in your garden or on a   farm or just walking down a road, take a look at the animals and plants   around you and think about how they all got there.</p>
  <p>Each of the   organisms you see, whether it's a tiny insect or a great big elephant,   is the latest member of an ancient family. Their ancestors go back in an   unbroken line for over 3 billion years, to the dawn of life itself. So   do yours.</p>
